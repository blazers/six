<span class="headword">Baldwyn,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1745, <em>d.</em> 1817), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and pamphleteer</span>, was baptized on 21 August 1745 in the parish of St Lawrence, Ludlow, Shropshire, the son of William Baldwyn and his wife, Ann. He matriculated from St John's College, Oxford, on 25 June 1762, aged sixteen, and graduated BA in 1767 and MA in 1784. He became a fellow of the college while still an undergraduate, vacating the fellowship only on his marriage in Ludlow on 9 July 1772 to Mary Nash, with whom he had four sons. Baldwyn is described as being of average height, with a light, fresh complexion, bright blue eyes, and sandy hair, with a very upright and sprightly walk but delicate health  (Claridge, 146).<br>
<br>In 1784 Baldwyn was appointed as master of Bradford grammar school. Under his leadership the school flourished. The number of pupils rose to fifty and the school began to make a net profit of about &pound;225 per year. To increase the number of scholars still further, Baldwyn added a modern side to the curriculum. French and geography were introduced as well as writing and accounts, to be taught by a newly appointed master, the students paying extra for the classes. His commercialization of education emulated the developments already seen at Bingley and Leeds grammar schools. Baldwyn's salary was increased to 100 guineas in 1791 and a &#145;proper house&#146;, worth &pound;25 per year, was built for him.<br>
<br>Baldwyn's time in Bradford was, however, dominated by his quarrel with the vicar of Bradford, John Crosse, and with the Sunday lecturer at the parish church, William Atkinson. Since 1703, the master of Bradford grammar school had, save for four years, also held the post of lecturer. Baldwyn regarded the post as a perquisite, but Crosse, who became vicar in the same year that Baldwyn took over the school, appointed Atkinson instead. Baldwyn attributed this to a grudge, for Crosse had also been a candidate for the job as master of Bradford grammar school, but there were also theological differences. Crosse, like Atkinson, was an evangelical, with sympathies for Methodism. Baldwyn was more orthodox.<br>
<br>When Atkinson published a volume of &#145;Poetical Essays&#146; in 1786, Baldwyn could not resist the opportunity to attack. Under the pseudonym Trim he published <span class="italic">A Critique on the Poetical Essays of the Rev. William Atkinson</span> (1787) criticizing both Atkinson's writing and morality. He followed this up with <span class="italic">Remarks on Two of the most Singular Characters of the Age</span> (1788?, 2nd edn 1790), accusing Crosse of simony and embezzling money from the parish. Atkinson's printed replies (and perhaps also a physical skirmish) provoked Trim to write four more pamphlets sarcastically attacking Crosse, Atkinson, and Atkinson's brother Johnson Atkinson Busfeild, one of the grammar school's governors. Busfeild had accused Baldwyn of mismanaging the school and drinking on Sundays, charges which were soon dropped. After a lull from 1791, the hostilities reopened in 1797, perhaps for political reasons. Busfeild was captain of the volunteers, while Baldwyn opposed Pitt and the war with revolutionary France. He was blackballed from the Bradford Coffee Room for his political views by a Major Sturges, and in response published <span class="italic">A Letter to Major Sturges on the Injustice and Illiberality of his Late Conduct</span> (1797), an anti-Pittite pamphlet. Sturges responded by getting up a petition levelling fifteen specific charges of pedagogical misconduct at Baldwyn (he was accused <i>inter alia</i> of leaving school during school hours, of cruelty to the boys, of not taking the boys to church). Since two other governors of the school, in addition to Crosse and Busfeild, had signed the petition, Baldwyn's position was in jeopardy, but his denials and counter-assertions, published in a sixty-eight-page document (now lost) seem to have quieted the opposition and he remained in his post for another five years. Baldwyn is also credited with entering a number of other literary squabbles with several anonymous short pamphlets, perhaps including <span class="italic">A Letter to Richard Hill, Esq. Member for the County of Salop</span> (1782) by &#145;a burgess of Ludlow&#146;. He was not, as is sometimes claimed, the author of those works for children written under the name Edward Baldwin. This was a pseudonym used by William Godwin.<br>
<br>In 1802 Baldwyn returned to Shropshire where he was rector of Abdon and perpetual curate of Clee St Margaret's. He planned to produce an edition of Catullus, writing to Wilkes for advice, but the project was never completed. He died in Kentish Town, London, on 11 February 1817 and was buried in St Pancras churchyard.<br>
