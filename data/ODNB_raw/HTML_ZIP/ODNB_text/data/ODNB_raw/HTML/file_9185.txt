</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Farr,  William</span>  (1807&#150;1883), <span class="occ">statistician and epidemiologist</span>, was born on 30 November 1807 in Kenley, Shropshire, the first of five children of John Farr (1783&#150;1864), farm labourer, and his wife, Catherine (1780&#150;1845). While he was still an infant his parents moved to Dorrington near Shrewsbury and entered the service of John Pryce, a bachelor then about seventy years of age. When his parents moved again soon after, the young child remained with Pryce, and on 28 October 1814 was formally indentured as a parish apprentice to his patron. Pryce's patronage allowed William Farr to leave the working class and to enter a profession; he was the only member of his family to do so. Pryce provided his charge with a modest primary education and local medical training in Shrewsbury. From 1826 to 1828 Farr read medicine with a physician, a Dr Webster of Shrewsbury, served as a dresser to a surgeon at the Shrewsbury Infirmary, and served a nominal apprenticeship to an apothecary. In November 1828 Pryce died and left Farr &pound;500 to complete his education, and the following spring Farr set off for Paris where he attended medical lectures. His study there was cut short by the revolution of 1830. He returned to London and, over the next two years, attended lectures at University College, replaced the house surgeon at the Shrewsbury Infirmary for six months, and on 29 March 1832 became a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries, his only earned medical qualification.<br>
<br>In 1833 Farr married a Miss Langford (<i>d</i>. 1837) (about whom nothing is known today) and tried to establish a practice at 8 Grafton Street, Fitzroy Square, London. To make ends meet the couple took in lodgers, and Farr, who had little taste for ordinary practice, offered a public lecture series on &#145;Hygiology&#146; and took up medical journalism. Between 1835 and 1840 he published four articles in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, helped edit the <span class="italic">British Medical Almanack</span>, and along with R. Dundas Thomson initiated the short-lived weekly <span class="italic">British Annals of Medicine, Pharmacy, Vital Statistics, and General Science</span>. Farr's writings in these years reflect the complaints of ordinary practitioners against the privileges and power of the London medical establishment. He also wrote a series of pieces on vital statistics, which culminated in his chapter &#145;Vital statistics&#146; in John Ramsay McCulloch's <span class="italic">A Statistical Account of the British Empire</span> (1837). This chapter helped establish his reputation as a statistician.<br>
<br>In 1837 Farr's prospects changed. His friend and former teacher Dr Webster died and left Farr his library and &pound;500. Also in that year Farr's first wife died. The four-year marriage had produced no children. Farr married for a second time in 1842. This marriage, to Mary Elizabeth Whittal, lasted until her death in 1876, and resulted in eight children, five of whom survived their father. Their most famous child was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53081/', "Florence Farr")</script>, the actress. Finally, in 1837, Farr received a temporary appointment to the General Register Office to help organize the data from the newly created system of vital registration of births, deaths, and marriages. On 10 July 1839 he joined the official establishment as compiler of abstracts at the modest salary of &pound;350 per year. He spent the remainder of his career at the General Register Office providing the statistical direction of the office and creating unforeseen uses for the registration data. Furthermore, by using his letters to the registrar-general in the latter's annual reports, Farr found a forum that permitted him to transcend the confines of his original duties, to establish himself as a world authority on vital statistics and epidemiology, and to address a wider readership in medicine, government, and social science. In recognition of the importance of his work, his title was changed in 1842 to superintendent of the statistical department and his salary steadily increased so that by the 1870s it nearly equalled that of the registrar-general.<br>
<br>Farr worked on forty-one annual reports, oversaw the <span class="italic">Weekly</span> and the <span class="italic">Quarterly</span> reports, and helped to plan and write the reports for the census enumerations of 1851, 1861, and 1871. Four of his special reports offer the best evidence of his mature statistical work: his two decennial supplements to the registrar-general's annual reports (the supplement to the twentieth-fifth report for the years 1851&#150;60, 1865, and the supplement to the thirty-fifth report for the years 1861&#150;70, 1875), and his two volumes on the cholera epidemics (the special report on the 1848&#150;9 epidemic, 1852, and supplement to the twenty-ninth annual report on the 1866 epidemic, 1868).<br>
<br>During his career Farr developed and popularized methods which have become standard tools in vital statistics and epidemiology. He designed (1839) and twice revised (1842 and 1855) a statistical nosology, or classification of diseases, for tabulating reported deaths. This nosology was used for the remainder of the century, and long influenced the <span class="italic">International List of the Causes of Death</span>. He showed how environmental risks to health could be elucidated by comparing crude mortality rates or, better still, standardized rates, for populations living under different conditions. He also helped to ensure that the life table would be accepted as the best measure of the longevity of a population, and he computed three life tables for England and Wales (for 1841, for 1838&#150;41, and for 1838&#150;54), a life table for the health districts of England, and life tables for special populations, such as British miners. In addition he demonstrated how life table techniques could be employed to study a wide range of phenomena: human fertility, promotions in the army and civil service, the circulation of gold coins, and the duration of English governments.<br>
<br>One of Farr's chief preoccupations was the discovery of laws of disease. This was originally related to his own interest in theoretical medicine, in particular in using organic chemistry to develop a more consistent simple and law-like theory of disease. His approach to this problem was initiated by the discovery that mortality in life tables changed regularly with age during three periods of life, a relationship first brought to his attention in the 1830s by Thomas Rowe Edmonds. Using techniques he had first encountered in the construction of theoretical or model life tables Farr then discovered mathematical expressions to predict the waning of epidemics of smallpox and rinderpest, to describe the relationship of soil elevation to cholera mortality, and to demonstrate that mortality varied inversely with mean proximity of population. The latter two laws helped, in his own view, to confirm his zymotic theory of disease, which attributed epidemic, endemic, and infectious disease to the products of organic decomposition which usually entered the body via the respiratory tract.<br>
<br>Farr was committed to public health reform and used many of his reports to demonstrate the waste of human life caused by preventable conditions in British cities. From the mid-1850s to the mid-1860s he worked closely with Florence Nightingale on hospital and army sanitary reform, preparing appendix 72 for the report of the army sanitary commission (1857&#150;8), serving on the committee of army medical statistics (1861), working as a member and the paid actuary consultant for the Indian sanitary commission (1859&#150;63), and defending Nightingale in the controversy over the third edition of her <span class="italic">Notes on Hospitals</span> (1863).<br>
<br>Farr was a frequent witness before other parliamentary investigations: select committee on insurance associations (1852&#150;3), select committee on income and property tax (1861), royal commissions on mines (1864), and the royal sanitary commission (1868&#150;9). He designed the Post Office insurance scheme (1864) and served as a private actuary consultant as well. He was an active member of the Statistical Society of London and of the International Statistical Congress, and he received during his career many professional honours. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1855. While a fellow he agitated for the society to keep more careful biographical records of its fellowship. When George Graham, the second registrar-general, retired in 1879, Farr applied for the post. When the appointment went to another, he retired (January 1880) amid protests from the medical profession that his talents and contributions had been overlooked. That year he was made companion of the Bath and received the British Medical Association's gold medal. In March 1880 a testimonial fund was begun in his honour to provide support for his three unmarried daughters whose financial future was endangered by some of Farr's unwise investments. He died on 14 April 1883 at his home, 78 Portsdown Road, Maida Vale, London, and was buried on 20 April at Bromley Common church.<br>
