<span class="headword">Bannister,  Saxe</span>  (1790&#150;1877), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, son of John Bannister, was born at Bidlington House, Steyning, Sussex, on 27 June 1790, and attended schools at Lewes and Tonbridge and then Queen's College, Oxford (BA, 1813, MA, 1815). He volunteered for active service when Napoleon escaped from Elba and, with a captain's commission, was on the way to Belgium when the battle of Waterloo ended the war. He retired from the army on half pay, and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn.<br>
<br>In October 1823 Bannister was appointed attorney-general of New South Wales under the <span class="roman">New South Wales Act</span> of that year. With a guaranteed salary of &pound;1200 he was also given the right of private practice as a barrister, and was sworn in at the first sitting of the NSW supreme court on 17 May 1824. Later that year he advised Governor Brisbane that he had no power to license or censor the press without special legislation, and that free persons accused of crime at the court of quarter sessions had to be tried by a civilian jury. He thus introduced such bodies and a free press into New South Wales.<br>
<br>However, Bannister's relationship with Governor Darling was tumultuous, Darling considering that though he was &#145;an upright, conscientious man, the apparent eccentricity of his mind and his want of experience in his profession prevented my depending on his counsel&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historical Records of Australia</span>, dispatch, 1 March 1829, 148). Chief Justice Forbes, like other officials, thought him at times mentally unbalanced.<br>
<br>Bannister's correspondence continually lamented that his salary was inadequate. In July 1825 he informed Lord Bathurst, the secretary of state, that unless it was more than doubled he could not stay in New South Wales. Bathurst refused to sanction any increase, and informed Darling that his majesty had no other alternative but to accept Bannister's resignation. Much aggrieved, Bannister sailed for England nine days later, but not before he became embroiled in a duel with Dr Wardell, editor of <span class="italic">The Australian</span>, from which both men emerged uninjured. On his return to England, Bannister vainly sought re-employment by the Colonial Office for the next seventeen years. In 1848 he accepted the position of gentleman bedel of the Royal College of Physicians at a salary of &pound;50 a year in fees.<br>
<br>Bannister had a keen interest in philanthropic causes, and was concerned with the welfare of children, convicts, and especially Aborigines. He was instrumental in the establishment of the first infants' school in Sydney, and published numerous pamphlets dealing with the subjects of transportation and government policy towards indigenous people. His other written works covered a diverse range of topics including the constitution and laws of the United States, a description of the <span class="italic">Mappa mundi</span> in Hereford Cathedral (1849), and a biography of William Paterson, founder of the Bank of England (1857). He was a lucid and engaging writer whose works reveal an agile and learned mind.<br>
<br>On 16 September 1832 Bannister had married Mary Lambe (<i>b</i>. 1796), and he died on 16 September 1877 at Thornton Lodge, Thornton Heath, Croydon, Surrey, the home of Mrs Wyndham, their only child.<br>
