<span class="headword">Swan,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> after 1445), <span class="occ">canon lawyer</span>, probably came from Southfleet in Kent. A cleric of the diocese of Rochester, he may never have advanced beyond minor orders, thereby remaining free to marry. His wife, Joan, and at least two daughters lived at Southfleet, in a household which also included Swan's mother. In a surviving but undated letter, Joan Swan told her husband that she would be willing to join him at the curia but would not learn the vernacular, German, an indication perhaps that Swan was then with the papal curia at Constance. He had a sister, Agnes, and two brothers, John, a pewterer, and Richard, a skinner of London, who acted as Swan's agent.<br>
<br>Already an Oxford master of arts and <i>licentiatus</i> in canon law, Swan arrived at the papal curia in 1404 during the brief pontificate of Innocent VII (<i>r</i>. 1404&#150;6). It was at this time that Swan was concerned in the intricate business of the marriage suit of John Arundel and Elizabeth Talbot, who after their marriage discovered that they were related within the forbidden degrees, yet wanted to remain married; Swan met the pope to discuss the fee for a new dispensation. He continued in curial employment under Gregory XII, when that pope was under pressure to resolve the stalemated schism. Swan travelled with the papal curia from place to place in Italy, as Pope Gregory flirted with the idea of a meeting with his Avignon rival, Benedict XIII, at Savona. While at Viterbo, Swan became stricken with dysentery and remained there for six weeks, being nursed by Alice Tudor, who had a suit at the curia. Tempted to leave the peripatetic papal entourage headed by an increasingly difficult pope, Swan was persuaded by the papal chamberlain to remain. His loyalty to Gregory survived that pope's deposition by the Council of Pisa in 1409. During the council Swan was with Gregory at Rimini, and he earned displeasure in England by continuing to sue bulls from the deposed Gregory. Clearly disillusioned, possibly stunned by this criticism, Swan returned about 1410 to England, where he continued his studies in canon law at Oxford. Yet when the fathers gathered at Constance in 1414, Swan was once again in the service of Pope Gregory, now as papal secretary, and, during the council (1414&#150;18) was active in the matter of the disputed election of the abbot of Fountains Abbey  (<i>Frank v. Rypon</i>).<br>
<br>After a brief stay in England, Swan returned to the papal curia in 1419 as a <i>scriptor</i> and <i>abbreviator</i> and became increasingly prominent in pursuing English interests, attracting a sizeable clientele of the famous and not-so-famous. He was involved in the difficult negotiations which led to the translation of John Kempe from London to the see of York in 1425 and also represented the interests of Henry Chichele, archbishop of Canterbury, in several matters brought before the papal curia. At an early stage of the Council of Basel (before 30 January 1433), Swan served as proctor for three English bishops: Worcester, Lincoln, and Bath and Wells. There is no evidence of his involvement in the council itself. Although Swan was said to have resigned his curial position by 1442, he seems to have acted as proctor for Christ Church Priory, Canterbury, in 1444. He is known to have rented a large house and garden from the English hospice of St Thomas in Rome. He died some time after 1445.<br>
<br>The letter-book of William Swan is a principal source for Anglo-papal relations in the first half of the fifteenth century. It exists in two somewhat overlapping versions. The Oxford version  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Arch. Selden B.23), written at least in part in Swan's own hand, covers the years from 1406 to 1426 and is particularly rich for the years before the Council of Constance. The London version  (BL, Cotton MS Cleopatra C.iv) contains nothing before the pontificate of Martin V (<i>r</i>. 1417&#150;31) and extends to 1441. A letter in the Oxford collection describes Swan in this fashion: &#145;Master William Swan, bachelor in laws, proctor-general in the Roman curia, who, though young, is yet very wise and circumspect, faithful and diligent, and conducts himself with ability in all his doings&#146;  (Jacob, 68).<br>
