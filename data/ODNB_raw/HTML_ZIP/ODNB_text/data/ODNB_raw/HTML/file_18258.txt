<span class="headword">Mascarene,  (Jean-)Paul</span>  (1685&#150;1760), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial administrator</span>, was born Jean-Paul Mascarene in October or November 1685 in Languedoc, France, the only child of Jean Mascarene and his wife, Margaret de Salavy. Shortly after the birth of his son, Jean Mascarene was imprisoned and then expelled from France as a Huguenot, following the revocation of the edict of Nantes. Jean-Paul was eventually smuggled out of the country and made his way in 1696 to Geneva, where he was cared for by the Rapin family, relatives of his father. He went later to Utrecht, and then to England, where he joined the army. Commissioned as a lieutenant in 1706, he went to North America in 1709 with the expedition intended to capture the French colonies of Acadia and Canada, under the command of Samuel Vetch and Francis Nicholson. The following year Mascarene assisted at the capture of Port Royal (Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia) and mounted the first British guard at the fort. In spite of many attempts to find other avenues of employment&#151;especially in the more congenial environment of Massachusetts, where he married Elizabeth Perry (<i>d</i>. 1728) in 1714&#151;Mascarene spent the remaining forty years of his career tied to the new British colony of Nova Scotia.<br>
<br>Mascarene was commissioned captain in 1717 in Philipps's regiment (later the 40th). He was also appointed one of the members of the new governing council of Nova Scotia, the colony's first civil government, in 1720. Over the next thirty years he was to serve that government in many capacities, especially in attempts to deal with and regulate the Acadians (the French inhabitants) and the native peoples of the region. In 1731 he led an unsuccessful attempt to entice New Englanders to resettle in Nova Scotia. The 1720s and 1730s brought repeated disappointments in Mascarene's efforts at self-advancement. Although nominated for the lieutenant-governorship of Massachusetts by Governor Andrew Belcher, he was passed over, probably owing to his lack of patronage in London. He increasingly spent time in Boston, especially after the death of his wife on 1 January 1728 left him with four young children. A stint as commanding officer at the fishing outport of Canso appears to have involved him briefly in the profitable smuggling business with nearby Louisbourg. When advancement did come, it was ironically not in Boston but in Annapolis Royal, from where he had tried so hard to break free. With Governor Richard Philipps a long-time absentee, the death of Lieutenant-Governor Lawrence Armstrong in 1739 brought Mascarene hastening to Nova Scotia from Boston. After a brief struggle he emerged as president of the governing council, a position he held until 1749. From 1742 he was also the senior military officer. In spite of claims by later historians, he never attained the rank of lieutenant-governor, the parsimonious Philipps repeatedly refusing to pay the necessary salary.<br>
<br>In spite of Mascarene's best efforts, the colony was poorly equipped to deal with the outbreak of the War of the Austrian Succession in 1744, with the Annapolis Royal fortifications in disrepair and the garrison inadequate. Only through the intervention of Massachusetts was Mascarene able to stave off repeated French and native attacks. Even the capture of the French fortress of Louisbourg by New Englanders in 1745 and the subsequent peace treaty of 1748 did not lead to military stability in Nova Scotia. Mascarene's major contribution towards peace in the colony during this difficult period lay in his efforts to conciliate the Acadians. In spite of the religious differences which separated them, Mascarene had developed a strong sympathy for the Acadians' predicament, as both France and Britain attempted to use them as pawns in the struggle for control of north-eastern North America. Among officials in Nova Scotia and Massachusetts, Mascarene was nearly alone in his view that reasonableness and time, not force, would eventually make of these people &#145;good British subjects&#146;, but his ability to keep them largely neutral in the conflict contributed materially to the defence of the colony.<br>
<br>After the conclusion of the war, London for once acted quickly and decisively in respect to Nova Scotia. The founding of the new administrative and military centre of Halifax in 1749 meant that both Annapolis Royal and Paul Mascarene were to be replaced&#151;the latter by a new governor, Edward Cornwallis. Having handed over the reins of government, Mascarene remained in the colony for another year and then in 1750 quietly retired to his home in Boston, where he lived comfortably, surrounded by his children and grandchildren. He sold his lieutenant-colonel's commission (ironically to Charles Lawrence, who in 1755 ordered the expulsion of the Acadians) and received the rank of brevet colonel.<br>
<br>Mascarene's lively intellectual interests&#151;in the classics, in debate on religious issues, and in translating the plays of Moli&egrave;re into English&#151;made it natural for him to prefer cosmopolitan Boston to tiny Annapolis Royal. Yet he had remained an outsider wherever he went: a Huguenot in France, in Britain a military officer without strong patronage connections, a devout Anglican in largely Congregationalist Massachusetts. Able and dedicated officer that he was, nowhere did his talents find full expression. He died in Boston on 22 January 1760.<br>
