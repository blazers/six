<span class="headword">Baird,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1804), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian General Synod of Ulster and Church of Ireland clergyman</span>, a native of Paisley, Renfrewshire, was educated at Edinburgh University, and in 1763 was ordained by the Edinburgh presbytery for a congregation in the Isle of Man. In 1766 he resigned this post and moved to Dublin. He was installed by the Dublin presbytery as minister of Capel Street (St Mary's Abbey) on 11 January 1767. Here he ministered for ten years, but not without considerable contention. In June 1769 the General Synod of Ulster suspended him for two weeks, following complaints from some members of his congregation and the local presbytery. Eight years later, in June 1777, synod was called upon to arbitrate between rival parties in the congregation. One group asked synod to dissolve the relation between the congregation and Baird. The other requested that synod interpose its influence to restore peace and continue Baird as minister. After a full debate synod decided, <i>nemine contradicente</i>, to dissolve the relation between Baird and the congregation, and declare the pulpit vacant. As a result of further investigation by a committee of synod, Baird was admonished by its moderator &#145;to act a part in future more suitable to his character as a man, &amp; a Christian, and particularly as a Minister of the Gospel&#146;, and instructed not to preach or exercise the function of a minister within the bounds of the synod, unless by appointment of that body, and to vacate the manse within a month. Whereupon Baird &#145;renounced all subjection and dependence upon the General Synod and all its subordinate parts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Records</span>, 3, 5&#150;6). The synod in 1778 reacted by declaring that Baird was deposed and deprived of the <i>regium donum</i> from 25 June 1777. To add to his tribulations, his wife died at the height of the controversy.<br>
<br>Shortly after his renunciation of the synod Baird brought out his first and only volume of a proposed series on the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, <span class="italic">Dissertations Chronological, Historical and Critical, of All the Books of the Old Testament</span>, based on Sunday evening lectures given at Capel Street. In the preface he gave his considered opinion of the members of his erstwhile congregation, when he stated that the lectures were &#145;delivered to a certain sort of people whose temper and behaviour in general, must, necessarily, render it very uncomfortable and dangerous to preside over them, in religious affairs&#146;. On 12 November 1777 he dedicated the volume to James Traill, bishop of Down and Connor. Some time later (the actual date is unknown) he conformed and was ordained in the established Church of Ireland. The fact that he preached at an ordination in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, held by the archbishop on 30 May 1779, indicates that his own ordination was prior to that date. On 7 September 1782 he was appointed by the crown rector of Cloghran, near Swords, co. Dublin, and instituted on 17 December. He memorialized the archbishop for permission to erect a glebe house in 1784, and received a grant of &pound;100 for this purpose from the Board of First Fruits. He died in early 1804.<br>
