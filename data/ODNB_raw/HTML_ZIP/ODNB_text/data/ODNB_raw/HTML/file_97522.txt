<span class="headword">Hussey,  Marmaduke James <span class="st"> [Duke]</span></span>, Baron Hussey of North Bradley  (1923&#150;2006), <span class="occ">newspaper and broadcasting executive</span>, was born at Lychwood, Worplesdon Hill, Woking, Surrey, on 29 August 1923, the only son and elder child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63620/', "Eric Robert James Hussey (1885&#150;1958)")</script>, then a Sudan colonial servant, later director of education in Uganda and Nigeria, and his wife, Christine Elizabeth Justice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Morley (1892&#150;1977). He was educated at Rugby School, from where he gained an open scholarship to Trinity College, Oxford. Surrounded by sportsmen on both sides of the family, he too excelled. At Rugby he was in both the cricket eleven and the rugby fifteen. At Oxford he won a cricket blue as a left-arm slow bowler in 1942, and that autumn was selected for the varsity rugby match. However, since he was due to report to the Grenadier Guards the following Monday, he decided not to risk any delay, and so sacrificed&#151;as he put it&#151;&#145;my life's ambition to play &hellip; against Cambridge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chance Governs All</span>, 27).<h2>
<a name="Anzioandearlycareerinnewspaperpublishing"></a>Anzio and early career in newspaper publishing</h2>Hussey deemed the most critical impact on his life the five-year struggle to recover from fearful wounds suffered four days after the allied landing at Anzio, Italy, in January 1944. For forty years he reproached himself for his short war, but later was persuaded that the story might inspire. Machine-gunned at close range, hit in the right hand, right leg, and spine, he had his right leg amputated below the knee at a German field station. In great pain, he was transferred to Rome, then by hospital train northwards. His life's turning point came when he fought off the temptation to sleep. &#145;I knew I could conquer this, whatever it was, the belief never left me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chance Governs All</span>, 44). That self-belief was tested repeatedly. From a prisoner-of-war hospital near Fulda, where the nuns were so certain he would not survive they added his name to those who died there, he was one of a handful repatriated in wartime by the Red Cross. Once he was back in Britain the ensuing five years saw treatment and surgery to the unhealed spinal wound, which had turned to the then incurable osteomyelitis. Finally an unorthodox operation at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford produced a healing, though leaving him permanently crippled. For the rest of his life Hussey, with his cane and distinctive gait, publicly made light of his suffering, appearing invariably ebullient, with a hearty laugh. Back at Oxford in 1946, sport now only a memory, he resumed his history studies and in 1949 completed his final BA paper with distinction&#151;although he did not get the first he had earlier hoped for.<br>
<br>On leaving Oxford in 1949 Hussey joined Associated Newspapers Ltd as a trainee. He started at the bottom&#151;in the advertising department of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> as a copy clerk&#151;and finished at the top. He described his approach thus: &#145;I like a ladder to climb as fast as I can, not worrying too much on whom I step on the way up&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chance Governs All</span>, 74). A prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the owner, Esmond Harmsworth, second Viscount Rothermere, he climbed steadily: manager of the <span class="italic">Evening News</span>, manager of the <span class="italic">Scottish Daily Mail</span> (which he closed), director in 1964, and managing director in 1967. He knew more about newspaper production than journalism but he took credit for recruiting David English in 1969 from the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> to be editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span>, and eventually editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>. Meanwhile, on 25 April 1959, in Bath Abbey, he married Lady Susan Katharine Waldegrave (<i>b</i>. 1939), fifth daughter of Geoffrey Noel Waldegrave, twelfth Earl Waldegrave. They had one son and one daughter. Lady Susan Hussey was a lady-in-waiting to the queen from 1960.<h2>
<a name="ShowdownatTimesNewspapers"></a>Showdown at Times Newspapers</h2>During his time at Associated, Hussey, with responsibility for labour relations, had become spokesman for the Newspaper Proprietors Association, where he first made Rupert Murdoch's acquaintance. At the association he learned much both of the unions' obduracy in defending their ruinously expensive restrictive practices, and of the owners' fecklessness in taking advantage of any rival title with union trouble rather than standing together. Both were to colour his approach to the eventual showdown at Times Newspapers Ltd (TNL), into which <span class="italic">The Times</span>, a chronic loss-maker, had been merged in 1966 with the Thomson-owned money-spinning <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>. Hussey joined TNL in 1971, at the point when Roy Thomson, first Baron Thomson of Fleet, notwithstanding his &#145;open-ended&#146; commitments to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, was expecting its losses to be trimmed to at least break-even point. Hussey was appointed chief executive in place of Thomson's lieutenant, Sir Denis Hamilton, who assumed the lesser job of chairman. The two men never got on. Hussey was also rarely comfortable with Gordon Brunton, the parent Thomson Organisation's chief executive, and this was fateful. It was a calamity for Hussey that Hamilton and Brunton had already initiated moving <span class="italic">The Times</span> from Blackfriars into a building next door to the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> on Gray's Inn Road. The aim was integration but its unintended consequence was that the ruinous malpractices of the latter's mostly casual labour force&#151;whose disruption was such that the paper was dubbed the <span class="italic">Sunday Sometimes</span>&#151;were to infect the whole operation. Also a setback for Hussey was the death in 1976 of Roy Thomson and his succession by his son Kenneth, whose interests always were more in Canada, and who made clear that his own commitment not to sell <span class="italic">The Times</span> was dependent on the introduction of the new computer typesetting technology by the end of that decade.<br>
<br>Hussey's approach to the unending labour problems was to act like an officer dealing with good NCOs. The trouble in this case, as with much of the then turbulent industrial relations besetting the Heath, Wilson, and Callaghan governments, was that the NCOs, the union general secretaries, might mean well but had mostly lost control of the more militant shop stewards. In print unions these were the branch officials known as &#145;chapel fathers&#146;, and Hussey had to deal with fifty-six separate bargaining units at TNL. The accusation that he ignored the chapels is not the whole truth; his plan was to get the general secretaries on his side in the hope that they could help restore union discipline, and then proceed to dot the <i>i</i>s and cross the <i>t</i>s with each chapel father. In the event he could hardly have done worse had he proceeded the other way round, and he might have done better.<br>
<br>The crunch came in 1978, with the Thomson interests prospering in North Sea oil, television, and travel, but haemorrhaging in TNL. Unofficial stoppages cost the group 7,337,000 copies overall in 1977. In the new year's first three months there were twenty-nine failures to complete the print run of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and nine on the Sunday. At a TNL executive board meeting on 16 March chaired by Hussey, with William Rees-Mogg, editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, as his fellow &#145;hawk&#146;, there was a unanimous decision to go for the &#145;big bang&#146;, a shutdown if the unions failed to agree wholesale reforms by 30 November.<blockquote>Basically, if we were going to have a row we might as well have a bloody big row and throw in the kitchen sink &hellip; Yes I did feel a sense of mission in attacking what I saw as the canker of irresponsible trades union activity at the heart of the industry, and, indeed, the country. (<span class="italic">Chance Governs All</span>, 148)</blockquote>Brunton, he reported, was &#145;absolutely delighted&#146;  (ibid.). However, little thought had been given to practicalities. Not until October did TNL's management produce detailed proposals for negotiation, and the November deadline arrived with only two chapels having reached agreement. Despite much attempted negotiation the general secretaries predictably failed to deliver. Hussey lamented later that &#145;I placed too much faith in those printing princes&#146;  (ibid., 154). Both papers and all supplements closed, a shutout if not a complete lockout (Hussey later incorrectly labelled it &#145;a strike&#146;; ibid., 159). The trial of strength was on but there had been a miscalculation of the balance of forces. The unions proved to have alternative resources. Many of the sacked workers were opportunistically re-employed at other titles like <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, and the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, which put on extra pages and even sections. &#145;Almost magically, an industry that was already notoriously over-manned absorbed the staff of <span class="italic">The Times</span> and the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> as it came off the company's payroll&#146;  (Jacobs, 72).<br>
<br>To break the deadlock Michael Mander, whom Hussey had brought from Associated as advertising director, got the board to agree to a secret scheme to outflank the unions, involving printing abroad and selling round the world a weekly edition of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Rees-Mogg was a fervent supporter. Timed for the eve of the British general election, the first edition, written by journalists who remained on the payroll, was to be computer-set in Darmstadt and printed in Frankfurt at a Turkish-owned plant. Alerted by the London unions at the last minute, German pickets and agitators demonstrated outside the plant. After petrol-soaked material was found in an apparent bid to sabotage the main presses the police advised that with the May day holiday imminent they could no longer guarantee the safety of the operation. The full print run of 80,000 was abandoned, though 10,000 copies with the date of 30 April 1979 were run off and distributed around the world. That feat of eluding pickets, albeit with a limited edition, convinced Hussey, supported by Rees-Mogg and his deputies at <span class="italic">The Times</span>, that they at last had the unions on the ropes. But even ahead of Frankfurt there had been some wobbling by Brunton, Hamilton, and Harry Evans, editor of the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>. They wanted contacts with the chapels, which Hussey saw as a stab in the back. Treating Frankfurt as a fiasco rather than a partial success, Brunton now reversed his approval and, seeking compromise, ordered no more international adventures. To Hussey this &#145;robbed us of what was our strongest card&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chance Governs All</span>, 164).<br>
<br>Hussey was even more dismayed when he got wind that Ken Thomson was also giving up, &#145;not prepared to foot the bill any longer&#146;  (Grigg, 491). Thomson came over in June and met the unions. With Hussey cut out of the negotiations, the final surrender still took another five months. Publication resumed on 13 November 1979, virtually on the chapels' terms, or terms they had no intention of implementing, after total TNL losses of &pound;46 million. By the following summer Hussey was moved out and given the non-job, under Hamilton, of vice-chairman of a new TNL holding company. Suddenly, viewing the <span class="italic">Times</span> journalists' strike over pay as the last straw, Ken Thomson had had enough; in 1981 he put the papers up for sale, and they were bought by Rupert Murdoch. Significantly Murdoch cleaned out the TNL management but retained the holding company board with Hussey as consultant. Although not involved in Murdoch's successful showdown with the unions at Wapping in 1986, Hussey took some credit for advice he gave the new owner. Rees-Mogg later asserted that Hussey's defeat was Dunkirk to Murdoch's D-day.<h2>
<a name="TurmoilattheBBC"></a>Turmoil at the BBC</h2>By September 1986 Hussey was mixing various business chairmanships and directorships with good works: he was, among other things, a Rhodes trustee from 1972 to 1991, a member of the board of the British Council from 1983 to 1996, a member of the government working party on artificial limbs and appliance centres in England from 1984 to 1986, chairman of the Royal Marsden Hospital from 1985 to 1998, and in 1985&#150;6 joint chairman of Great Western local radio in Bristol. On the death of Stuart Young, the BBC chairman, he was asked by the head of Margaret Thatcher's number 10 policy unit, Brian Griffiths, to suggest some candidates to replace Young. When they conferred Griffiths threw out that his wife, Rachel, had suggested Hussey do it, but Hussey laughed it off. In fact Griffiths was serious; he discreetly gained Denis Thatcher's approval, and that of the former home secretary William Whitelaw, and moved Hussey to the top of the list. By some Hussey was seen as an old-fashioned Liberal, but by others as a Thatcherite who would stand up to BBC management the way Murdoch had stood up to the unions at Wapping. Hussey was duly phoned by Douglas Hurd, the home secretary, offering the chairmanship, and further persuasion was added by William Waldegrave, a junior minister and Hussey's brother-in-law.<br>
<br>Even before getting to Broadcasting House (he had to check the address in the telephone directory) Hussey judged the corporation to be &#145;out of control with some pretty unreliable characters there&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chance Governs All</span>, 193). A state of war was reckoned to exist between management and the governors, with Alasdair Milne, director-general, and Rees-Mogg, outgoing vice-chairman, leading the opposing forces. Hussey found most of the BBC's top managers out of touch, &#145;marooned &hellip; like a couple of Boer contingents in a laager&#146;  (ibid., 202), and he threw himself into the fray with a hands-on approach not hitherto associated with his more supervisory predecessors. Within days he had gone behind the director-general's back in strictly management matters, and four months later he and the new vice-chairman, Lord Barnett, stealthily gained the consent of their fellow governors to dismiss Milne, the first director-general to be so treated. Hussey considered him &#145;unbalanced and irresponsible&#146;  (ibid., 213). With only cursory explanation that the governors wanted change, Hussey and Barnett told Milne that either he could resign or he would be dismissed. They had a letter ready for his signature. &#145;What terrible people, I thought&#146;  (Milne, 202).<br>
<br>Dismissal was one thing, appointment another, and there were fateful unintended consequences. Hussey then failed to get the governors to agree to his choice of successor, David Dimbleby, a leading television presenter who had little experience of BBC management. They chose instead Milne's deputy, Michael Checkland, an accountant expert in BBC finances. Hussey asked Checkland if he would accept Dimbleby as his deputy. Checkland demurred, and, at Paul Fox's suggestion, with Michael Grade's approval, invited John Birt, who came &#145;expensive&#146;, as Hussey put it  (<span class="italic">Chance Governs All</span>, 271), from London Weekend Television.<br>
<br>Turbulent times ensued, over policy, appointments, and programmes. Hussey was firm in repulsing the attacks on the BBC from Norman Tebbit, the chairman of the Conservative Party, but he did not oppose the government's ban on direct interviews with Sinn F&eacute;in spokesmen&#151;who, comically, were shown with their words spoken by actors. Throughout this time Thatcher had the BBC firmly in her sights. She had always anathematized the licence fee, asking why people who only watched ITV should pay it. She and her supporters were also incensed by current affairs coverage both of the Conservative Party and of Northern Ireland (although it was Thames TV that felt the heaviest blow). Hussey had well-grounded fears that she intended breaking up the corporation with part-privatization, stripping it of TV and radio channels in the projected Broadcasting bill, but her efforts in cabinet committee were talked out by ministers like William Whitelaw, David Mellor, and Hurd himself. The work was incomplete by the time she resigned. Under John Major, who was less aggressive, the BBC's new charter and licence fee settlement were reached.<br>
<br>Much china was broken on the way, however. Birt was no sooner made deputy director-general than he fell out with Grade, who left for Channel 4. Checkland worked mightily to trim spending and reform management practices, but Hussey harassed him for more, and finally schemed with Birt, and Patricia Hodgson, the one open high tory among top BBC executives, to replace him with Birt. In a messy compromise that pleased no one, Hussey made Birt director-general designate, while Checkland was to serve another year, itself foreshortened. Most unusually the post was not advertised for a competitive appointment board, which brought a protest from John Tusa, the managing director of the BBC World Service. In appointing Birt, Hussey had offended against his own axiom: &#145;appoint only a man who has the support and confidence of a good portion of the staff&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chance Governs All</span>, 218). Birt, after five years in charge of news and current affairs, was already seen as the most hated man in broadcasting. Whether in spite of or because of this he launched further rounds of reforms and manning reductions, relying massively (and expensively) on management consultants. Hussey was at first staunchly behind his prot&eacute;g&eacute;. In a public furore prompted by revelations that Hussey had allowed Birt a tax-efficient contract to be paid not as a BBC employee but by Birt's private company, which allowed his Armani suits and his wife's secretarial services to be tax-deductible, Hussey stood firm. <span class="italic">The Observer</span> called in vain for the resignations of both Birt and Hussey. Hussey later inaccurately and unfairly claimed that Birt's contract was identical to that of others&#151;such as John Tusa. This was untrue, since Tusa and others were paid as self-employed freelances.<br>
<br>Yet by the time of the broadcasting white paper of 1994 Hussey and Birt's disenchantment was mutual. Hussey questioned Birt's lack of judgement, while Birt believed that Hussey was ageing and jealous of all the plaudits Birt got for the new licence-fee settlement. In their respective memoirs each claimed total credit for the latter, while Checkland pointed out, in a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> (22 Oct 2002), that the groundwork had been done under his aegis. Hussey and Birt's relationship finally foundered in 1996 on Birt's decision to withhold from Hussey the fact that Diana, princess of Wales, had recorded a TV interview with <span class="italic">Panorama</span>. Birt did not trust Hussey not to sabotage the planned scoop, through his wife's connection to the queen. Hussey was not told until one week before the scheduled transmission, the same day that Diana personally informed the queen, and the BBC publicized the interview. Hussey felt betrayed. All the reinforced procedures for referral of contentious matters to the governors had been defied. Hussey, who maintained that he never previewed programmes and in any case kept his wife's royal duties out of his business, would have been justified in calling for Birt's dismissal, but the interview drew a record audience and was hugely popular. Instead it was Hussey who departed shortly afterwards, after the longest spell of any BBC chairman. He was made a life peer, as Baron Hussey of North Bradley, on John Major's recommendation. His parting shot at Birt in a House of Lords debate in 1999 was seen by some as a belated conversion: &#145;There is too much bureaucracy, over-bloated policy units, and too much spent on expansion and management&#146;, he lamented  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5L</span>, 597.1686, 3 March 1999).<br>
<br>Hussey's final years were clouded by the onset of dementia, and he died on 27 December 2006 at 3 Beatrice Place, Marloes Road, Kensington, London, a nursing home for the elderly. He was survived by his wife and their two children. At the time of his death, his legacy was deeply contested. He bestrode three careers, but perhaps relied too much on instinct rather than deepening knowledge. Yet had he, like Murdoch, had the benefit of Thatcher's laws curbing union power, he could well have saved the Thomson papers. At the BBC his engineering of Birt's appointment backfired on both of them in the end, with considerable fallout for the institution. Michael Grade scoffed in 2002 that all Birt (and Hussey) &#145;paraphernalia &hellip; has come apart and been hastily dismantled&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 26 Oct 2002).<br>
