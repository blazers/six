<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Faber,  Frederick William</span>  (1814&#150;1863), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born on 28 June 1814, the fourth surviving son of Thomas Henry Faber (1779&#150;1833) and his wife, Betty Atkinson (<i>d</i>. 1829), daughter of Thomas Atkinson of Bradford, at Calverley vicarage in Yorkshire, the home of his grandfather the Revd Thomas Faber (1729&#150;1821). Faber had a younger sister, Ellen, and there were three other siblings&#151;two older, who died in 1813, and one younger&#151;who died in infancy. These deaths seem to have intensified his mother's love for him. Faber's uncle, George Stanley Faber (1773&#150;1854), was later the master of Sherburn Hospital near Durham and a prolific evangelical theologian. In December 1814 Thomas Henry Faber was appointed secretary to his brother's patron, Shute Barrington, bishop of Durham, and the family moved to Auckland Castle in Bishop Auckland. Frederick Faber was educated briefly at the grammar school in Bishop Auckland and privately by the Revd John Gibson at Kirkby Stephen, where he first learned his love of the upland moors and fells later expressed in his poem <span class="italic">Sir Lancelot</span> (1844). In 1826 he was sent to Shrewsbury School, but moved in 1827 to Harrow School where, as he afterwards told Lord John Manners, he &#145;felt always quite wild&#151;wild with power of intellect&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Letters</span>, 74), and was considered without intellectual rival. His mother died in 1829, and some of his later Marian hymns show the influence of her early death. He is said to have defied God to strike him dead in a thunderstorm in Harrow churchyard, but his incipient scepticism was arrested by the kindness of his headmaster, Charles Longley (1794&#150;1868), later archbishop of Canterbury, and his faith was given a new turn by John William Cunningham (1780&#150;1861), the evangelical vicar of Harrow and unofficial chaplain to the school.<br>
<br>Faber matriculated at Oxford on 6 July 1832; he failed to win a Balliol scholarship, but came into residence in Balliol in spring 1833. Late in 1834 he was elected a scholar of University College, where he resided from early 1835. His friends included Roundell Palmer (1812&#150;1895), later Lord Selborne, and the eccentric and gifted scholar John Brande Morris (1812&#150;1880); Faber's letters to Palmer and Morris are important sources for his early life. Faber rejected Newman's influence in 1834 in favour of a position leaning towards evangelical Calvinism, but after Pusey's sermon on Septuagesima Sunday of 1836 he began to embrace Tractarianism, and was thoroughly convinced by what he said he had long wanted: the &#145;clear and positive statements of Anglican principles&#146;  (Bowden, 38) of Newman's <span class="italic">Lectures on the Prophetical Office of the Church</span> of 1837.<br>
<br>Having postponed his finals in Easter term 1836 until December, Faber graduated in 1836 with a disappointing second-class honours degree and failed to get a fellowship at University College. After a holiday in Germany with his brother Francis (1804&#150;1876), he was elected a fellow of University in 1837 and won the Johnson divinity scholarship. He was made a deacon by Longley, then bishop of Ripon, on 6 August 1837, and ordained as priest by Bishop Bagot of Oxford on 26 May 1839. In summer 1839 he travelled in Belgium and Germany with Richard Church (1815&#150;1890) and Arthur Penrhyn Stanley (1815&#150;1881), but wrote of Romanism that &#145;it all will not do&#146;, expressing his disgust with the &#145;careless irreverence, the noise, the going in and out, the spitting of the priests on the Altar steps&#146;  (Bowden, 65).<br>
<br>Between 1837 and 1842 Faber kept a cottage in the Lake District, and served as a curate in Ambleside. He befriended Wordsworth, the poet Thomas Whytehead (1815&#150;1843), Lord John Manners (1818&#150;1906), the founder of Young England, and George Smythe (1818&#150;1857), later seventh Viscount Strangford. Faber had an intensely romantic if platonic relationship with Smythe in the fashion of its time, but put Smythe from him on scenting moral danger. Faber was a considerable influence on Manners, and figures as the Revd Aubrey St Lys in Disraeli's novel <span class="italic">Sybil</span>. Faber's productions included <span class="italic">The Cherwell Water-Lily</span> (1840), which earned him the nickname of Water-Lily Faber, a slur on his facial prettiness and charm of manner. One poem, &#145;First Love&#146;, of 1840, expressed his devotion to Dora Harrison, the twelve- or thirteen-year-old daughter of Benson Harrison of Ambleside, whose son, Matthew, Faber tutored from 1840. From February to August 1841 he travelled with Matthew to Italy, Greece, and Constantinople, returning through eastern Europe, Austria, and Germany, and gathering the materials used in <span class="italic">The Styrian Lake, and other Poems</span> (1842) and <span class="italic">Sights and Thoughts in Foreign Churches and among Foreign Peoples</span> (1842), which he dedicated to Wordsworth &#145;in affectionate remembrance of much personal kindness, and many thoughtful conversations on the rites, prerogatives, and doctrines, of the Holy Church&#146;. The work asked the reader to look on Europe in the spirit of the middle ages, and showed an unsettled attitude to Anglicanism and a fascination with Roman Catholicism.<br>
<br>In 1843 Faber was inducted into the University College living of Elton in Huntingdonshire. On another tour to the continent, also in 1843, he read Gabriello Chiabrera's epitaph at Savona, with its exhortation to choose Mount Calvary rather than Mount Parnassus, henceforward the motto of his life. In Rome he was received in audience by Gregory XVI, and acquired a devotion to St Philip Neri, whose life he translated at Elton, where he turned his household servants into a brotherhood, landscaped his garden on Wordsworthian principles, and opened it to his parishioners for Sunday evening promenades, cricket, and football. He acquired an adoring following among the young, restored the church, replaced the old village orchestra with an organ, fasted to the ruin of his health, and introduced confession. He translated the seven books of St Optatus on the Donatists for <span class="roman">The Library of the Fathers</span>, published a poem of nearly 11,000 lines on Sir Lancelot (1844; rev. edn, 1857), and provoked an outcry over his Romanizing &#145;Life of St Wilfrid&#146; in Newman's <span class="italic">Lives of the English Saints</span>, for which he also wrote the lives of nine saints of Northumbria.<br>
<br>Only Newman's influence kept Faber from the Roman Catholic church, and Newman's reception on 9 October 1845 removed that obstacle. A Catholic convert benefactor resident in Florence, F. J. Sloane, offered to pay the debts Faber had incurred in his parish, and on 17 November he left Elton, farewelled by weeping parishioners. With Francis Knox and ten other friends and servants, he was received into the Roman Catholic church at Northampton by Bishop William Wareing, vicar apostolic of the eastern district. Two adolescent followers, William and James Pitts, the former later the Brompton Oratory organist, resisted their father's pleas to come home.<br>
<br>Faber leased a house in Birmingham for his new order, the Brothers of the Will of God of the Congregation of St Wilfrid or &#145;Wilfridians&#146; (mischievously called by Dominic Barberi the Brothers of the Will of Faber). His <span class="italic">Grounds for Remaining in the Anglican Communion</span> (1846) distressed Newman by its polemics, and was at first banned in Rome by censors misled by its title. On a visit to Florence with a rich young disciple, Antony Hutchison, Faber failed to persuade his benefactor, Sloane, to finance his monastery in Birmingham, but he was received again by the pope. He accepted from the earl of Shrewsbury Cotton Hall, near Cheadle, in Staffordshire, founded schools, built a church designed by A. W. N. Pugin and consecrated to St Wilfrid, and vigorously proselytized in the neighbourhood. He was ordained priest at Oscott on 3 April 1847 by Cardinal Wiseman, his carriage being dragged the last three-quarters of a mile home by local people amid fireworks, gunfire, and a brass band.<br>
<br>But Newman's new Oratory at Birmingham was an irresistible attraction, and on 14 February 1847 Faber joined it with seventeen Wilfridians. Newman found a worshipping but difficult follower. In 1848 Faber had a stormy if comic confrontation at Cotton with Ambrose Phillipps (1809&#150;1878) and Pugin over his own preference for the Italian style in religious architecture and worship over Gothic. He had, in 1846, projected a series of <span class="italic">Lives of the Saints</span> (42 vols., 1847&#150;56) of the modern era; the &#145;more than charnel horrors&#146;  (Chapman, 194) of the asceticism of St Rose of Lima provoked a violent attack by the Revd Edward Price in <span class="italic">Dolman's Magazine</span>. The series was suspended, defended by Newman (against his later judgement), and then restarted under the auspices of the Oratory. Although Newman and Faber came briefly together at Cotton Hall in 1848, Newman's return to Birmingham in January 1849 left Faber at the hall as master of novices, and the temperamental difference between the two men was wisely resolved by the division of the community between London and Birmingham.<br>
<br>In 1849 Faber became rector of the London Oratory in a former assembly room and whisky shop in King William Street off the Strand, and attracted a congregation of wealthy English aristocrats and bug-ridden pauper Irish. On 9 October 1850 Newman released the fathers from their obedience and on 12 October Faber became superior of the independent London Oratory. In the excitement over the &#145;papal aggression&#146; of the restoration of the Catholic hierarchy in 1850, the black Oratorian habits and broad-brimmed hats made a metropolitan sensation, not least in <span class="italic">Punch</span>. Faber expounded the character of his institute in <span class="italic">The Spirit and Genius of St Philip Neri</span> (1850). A ticket system had to be introduced for the chapel, but in 1851 Hutchison opened a ragged school for 1000 poor children in Dunn's Passage, Holborn.<br>
<br>Faber lost his looks in the late 1840s, when he became fat and suffered from periodic ill health. His trip to the Holy Land in 1851 was abandoned at Malta through illness, but he was received in audience on the homeward journey by Pius IX. From 1852 he could recuperate from his ailments at his community's rural retreat at Sydenham. In 1854 the Oratory moved to its permanent home in the Brompton Road. The gap between the London and Birmingham oratories, and between Faber and Newman, was widened by a row in 1855, ostensibly over the London Oratory's wish to hear nuns' confessions. It is difficult to see a higher principle at stake in this unhappy <i>querelle des moines</i> between two good men, which was creditable to neither; it was exacerbated by Faber's inability to keep his mouth shut, and sent Newman on a mission of self-defence to Rome. Newman's difficulty in forgiving Faber remains the most signal objection to his canonization.<br>
<br>Faber called the Virgin Mary &#145;Mamma&#146;, and his promotion of devotions to the Madonna, the saints, and the blessed sacrament, more common under skies of Mediterranean blue, also represented a return to the fervour of his early evangelicalism, as did his popular vernacular hymns, which transformed Catholic worship: they include &#145;Jesus, gentlest Saviour&#146; and &#145;Hark, hark, my soul&#146;. Despite their failures of taste and style, they represent the best of Victorian Catholic piety in their power to strengthen, to console, to warm, and to delight. Their stress lies on what Faber called the &#145;wideness in God's mercy&#146;, and in their teaching on purificatory suffering they widened the bounds of purgatory.<br>
<br>Faber's eight religious treatises were long premeditated, but were poured out between 1853 and 1860, their manuscripts flowing on in the author's beautiful hand, almost without corrections. They were intended for his &#145;invalid souls&#146; of the middle class and &#145;poor Belgravians&#146; on the model of Victorian popular science  (Chapman, 296), and are &#145;not pure theology, nor mere devotion &hellip; not explanatory apologetic, but a very individual mixture of the three&#146;, written in the light of the &#145;one large lucid philosophy&#146; of God  (Chapman, 292). <span class="italic">All for Jesus, or, The Easy Ways of Divine Love</span> (1853), the most introductory of them all, was composed for the Confraternity of the Precious Blood, and had sold 100,000 copies by 1869. <span class="italic">Growth in Holiness</span> (1854) maps out the middle way of the wilderness of &#145;temptation, struggle, and fatigue&#146; which most religious men occupy, between the delight of spiritual beginnings and &#145;the beautiful, wooded, watered, yet rocky mountains&#146; of &#145;the land of high prayer&#146;. <span class="italic">The Blessed Sacrament</span> (1855) treats its subject as the highest manifestation of God. It is dedicated to Newman, who thought that its argumentative manner would encourage scepticism. <span class="italic">The Creator and the Creature</span> (1858) is Faber's greatest work in its vision of life as a work of the divine creative love. <span class="italic">The Foot of the Cross</span> (also 1858) is based on the seven dolours of Mary, <span class="italic">The Precious Blood</span> (1860) on the doctrine of redemption, and <span class="italic">Bethlehem</span> (1860) on the infancy of Our Lord. His <span class="italic">Spiritual Conferences</span> (1859) shows signs of tiredness. These books establish Faber's extraordinary knowledge of the mystical theology, hagiography and history of nineteen centuries, even if his emotive combination of romanticism and evangelicalism is a little strong for modern sensibilities. His <span class="italic">Notes on Doctrinal and Spiritual Subjects</span> (1866) was edited by his biographer, John Edward Bowden, in 1866. His letters are a more accessible delight, being as racy and unbuttoned as the man.<br>
<br>Criticism among Catholics of Faber's work was muted after Pius IX's award to him of a doctorate of divinity in 1854, and in his <span class="italic">Devotion to the Pope</span> (1860) he defended the beleaguered papacy, along with Manning and his old Balliol friend William George Ward (1812&#150;1882). Faber died of Bright's disease at the Brompton Oratory aged forty-nine on 26 September 1863 and was buried there on 30 September. More than any other figure, he defined the tone and temper of mid-Victorian ultramontane Catholicism. His legacy is the Brompton Oratory, with its continuing fusion&#151;in music, learning, art, and architecture&#151;of the Catholic faith with the form and spirit of the papal Rome of the high baroque, and of its genius, St Philip Neri.<br>
