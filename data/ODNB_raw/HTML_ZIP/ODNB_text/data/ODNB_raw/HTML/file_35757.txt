<span class="headword">Rigg,  James Harrison</span>  (1821&#150;1909), <span class="occ">Wesleyan Methodist minister and educationist</span>, was born at Newcastle upon Tyne on 16 January 1821, the second son and third child of John Rigg (1786&#150;1857), a Wesleyan Methodist minister there, and his second wife, Anne (<i>b</i>. 1797), daughter of James McMullen, Irish Methodist missionary at Gibraltar. Brought up in straitened circumstances, the boy was for five years (1830&#150;35) a pupil and for four years (1835&#150;9) a junior teacher at the Kingswood School for preachers' sons near Bristol. In 1839 he became assistant in the Revd Mr Firth's academy, Hartstead Moor, near Leeds, and having made an unsuccessful effort to conduct a school of his own in Islington, London, he became in 1843 classical and mathematical master at John Conquest's school at Biggleswade. In July 1845 he entered the Wesleyan Methodist ministry as probationer and, being ordained on 1 August 1849, served in Wesleyan circuits until 1868.<br>
<br>From an early date Rigg read widely and wrote much on religious and theological themes. A vigorous and clear style gave his writings influence in his denomination. He was a chief contributor to the <span class="italic">Biblical Review</span> (1846&#150;9), and frequently wrote in the Wesleyan newspaper <span class="italic">The Watchman</span>. Having contributed to the first number of the <span class="italic">London Quarterly Review</span>, a Wesleyan Methodist periodical, in September 1853, he soon joined its editorial staff (1868), was co-editor with Dr William Burt Pope (1883&#150;6), and ultimately sole editor (1886&#150;98). Rigg explained his theological position in three volumes: <span class="italic">Principles of Wesleyan Methodism</span> (1850; 2nd edn, 1851), <span class="italic">Wesleyan Methodism and Congregationalism Contrasted</span> (1852), and <span class="italic">Modern Anglican Theology</span> (1857; 3rd edn, 1880). In the last he ably criticized the broad-church teaching of Maurice, Kingsley, and Jowett as being pervaded with a non-Christian Neoplatonism, but his differences with Kingsley were so considerately expressed that Kingsley sought his acquaintance. In 1866 he republished many periodical articles as <span class="italic">Essays for the Times on Ecclesiastical and Social Subjects</span>. His literary work was early valued in America. He acted as English correspondent of the <span class="italic">New Orleans Christian Advocate</span> (1851) and of the <span class="italic">New York Christian Advocate</span> (1857&#150;76). In 1865 he received the degree of DD from Dickinson College, USA, and in 1877 from Edinburgh.<br>
<br>In 1868 Rigg was appointed principal of the Westminster (Wesleyan) Training College for day-school teachers, and he held that post until 1903. In matters of education he acquired an expert knowledge and was an active controversialist. When the first <span class="roman">Elementary Education Act</span> was passed in 1870 Rigg took the traditional Wesleyan view, opposing secularism and favouring denominational schools, although without sympathy for sectarian exclusiveness. He was opposed by William Arthur and Hugh Price Hughes, who supported the transfer of Wesleyan schools to the school boards created in 1870. He pressed his views, in correspondence, on the attention of Gladstone and W. E. Forster, and the Wesleyan conference supported him. From 1870 to 1876 he served as a member for Westminster on the first London school board. With the help of Professor Thomas Huxley and W. H. Smith MP he secured the provision of a syllabus of religious instruction. He advocated a broad curriculum open to girls as well as boys. He was a member of the royal commission on elementary education (1886&#150;8), known as the Cross commission, which reported in favour of the school board management as against the voluntary system.<br>
<br>In the general administration of Wesleyan affairs Rigg was recognized to be a statesman-like leader of liberal-conservative temper. He was successively chairman of the Kent and second London districts (1865, 1877), and in 1878 and 1892 was president of the Wesleyan conference. From 1881 to 1909 he was treasurer of the Wesleyan Missionary Society. In controversies concerning the internal organization of the Wesleyan church Rigg took a middle course. He accepted the addition of a representative lay session of conference, but in 1890 successfully advocated its insertion between two sessions restricted to ministers, so that the pastoral element should predominate. Rigg's proposal of 1894, supported by the &#145;progressive&#146; party under Hugh Price to exempt chairmen of districts from circuit duties and leave them free to exercise supervision over the district, was rejected by the conference from a suspicion that Rigg's &#145;separated chairmen&#146; had a colour of episcopacy. With Hughes and the progressive party Rigg's relations were often strained. Writing privately to Cardinal Manning, a colleague on the education commission, on the education question on 17 December 1888, he described Hughes as &#145;your intemperate temperance coadjutor, our methodist firebrand&#146;  (Smith, 212). The unauthorized publication of the letter in Purcell's <span class="italic">Life</span> of the cardinal (1895) led to reprisals by Hughes, who wrote in the <span class="italic">Methodist Times</span> an article entitled &#145;The self-revelation of Dr Rigg&#146; (described by a friend of Rigg as &#145;unscrupulous&#146; and &#145;mendacious&#146;; Methodist Archives, MAM PLP 89-39-2). At Rigg's request the letter was withdrawn from later editions of Purcell's book, and Hughes and he were reconciled.<br>
<br>Rigg never abated his literary energies amid his varied activities. For many years he was a member of the committee of the London Library. To an earlier study entitled <span class="italic">The Churchmanship of John Wesley</span> (1869, 1879) he added <span class="italic">The Living Wesley</span> (1875; reissued as <span class="italic">The Centennial Life of Wesley</span> in 1891). The former played down Wesley's high-church characteristics in the light of current Wesleyan suspicions of Anglo-Catholicism. The latter attempted a fuller account of Wesley's private life. Rigg's <span class="italic">Oxford High Anglicanism and its Chief Leaders</span> (1895; 2nd edn, 1899) is apparently the only attempt made by a nonconformist to write a history of the Oxford Movement. Rigg was a severe critic of Newman, but especially emphasized the influence of Pusey on the development of Anglo-Catholicism. There followed <span class="italic">Reminiscences Sixty Years Ago</span> (1904), covering only his early life; a sympathetic biography of Jabez Bunting (1905); and the article &#145;Methodism&#146; in the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> (9th edn).<br>
<br>Rigg married, on 17 June 1851, Caroline Smith (<i>d</i>. 17 Dec 1889), the daughter of John Smith, alderman of Worcester. They had two schoolmistress daughters (the elder, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51759/', "Caroline Edith Rigg")</script>, became a renowned headmistress and the younger married Rigg's biographer, John Telford) and a barrister son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35758/', "James McMullen Rigg")</script>, who contributed many articles to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. Short, rotund, and bearded, Rigg was aggressive and self-confident, especially in controversy (some compared him to Dr Johnson). Yet he was also an able compromiser in negotiation. He was kindly to individuals and devoted to his wife, who was often in poor health.<br>
<br>For many years Rigg dominated Wesleyan educational policy, which was directed at developing denominational middle-class as well as elementary education. A major influence on policy, however, was fear of Roman and Anglo-Catholic advance (and &#145;infidelity&#146;). This can be seen in Rigg's advocacy of Wesleyan schools, his writings on Anglicanism, and his interpretations of John Wesley. These fears weakened Rigg's inherited conservative Wesleyan sympathies with Anglicanism, and strengthened his assertion of the superiority of Wesleyan doctrine and polity, though he disliked aggressive nonconformity. Both he and Hughes wished to protect Wesleyan children from Roman and Anglo-Catholic &#145;perversion&#146;, though they differed on the best policy for achieving this: the mixed &#145;denominational and secular&#146; system secured in 1870 (Rigg) or a purely &#145;secular&#146; one (Hughes). Both insisted that the secular schools must include non-denominational religious instruction. In Rigg's last years Hughes's more nonconformist policies were clearly gaining ground in Wesleyanism. Rigg died on 17 April 1909 at 79 Brixton Hill, London, and was buried in the city's Norwood cemetery.<br>
