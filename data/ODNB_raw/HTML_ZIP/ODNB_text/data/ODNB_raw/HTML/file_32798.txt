<span class="headword">Vere, Sir  Stephen Edward  De</span>, fourth baronet  (1812&#150;1904), <span class="occ">philanthropist and classical scholar</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7562/', "Sir Aubrey De Vere, second baronet (1788&#150;1846)")</script>, and his wife, Mary Rice (<i>d</i>. 1856); his younger brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32797/', "Aubrey Thomas de Vere")</script>. He was born at Curragh Chase, Adare, co. Limerick, on 26 July 1812. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, and throughout his life shared the literary tastes of his family. After reading at Lincoln's Inn, he was called to the Irish bar in 1836. His life was dedicated to the service of his fellow countrymen, and he worked hard for the relief of the distress during the Irish famine. He believed emigration to be the only panacea, and encouraged the young men to go out to Canada. Hearing of the terrible sufferings of the emigrants on the voyage, in May 1847 he went himself as a steerage passenger to Canada. The emigrant ships were sailing vessels, and the voyage took six weeks or more. Arriving in Canada he wrote a letter (30 November 1847) describing the appalling conditions aboard ship. His revelations were made public by the Colonial Office and had a powerful impact. De Vere's letter was cited in both houses of parliament in 1848, and his recommendations for new regulations were the basis for amendments to the passenger acts ensuring that proper accommodation was provided for emigrants.<br>
<br>De Vere's admiration of the Irish Catholic people led him to embrace the Roman Catholic religion, and his reception into that church took place during his visit to Canada in 1848. In 1851 he wrote a pamphlet defending the creation of a Catholic hierarchy in England.<br>
<br>De Vere was member of parliament for Limerick County (1854&#150;9). He was a Liberal, supporting tenant right and Gladstone's land legislation, but he was opposed to home rule. He succeeded his brother Vere as fourth baronet in 1880. De Vere published <span class="italic">Translations from Horace</span> in 1886, together with some original verse. He died unmarried on 10 November 1904 at Foynes, co. Limerick, an island in the River Shannon and was buried there, by the door of the Roman Catholic church, which was built mainly by his exertions. A fountain was erected in the village during his lifetime to commemorate his work in the district. His kindness to his tenants was remarkable; they were permitted to help themselves to wood from the park, and even, it was said, to the deer. The baronetcy became extinct at his death.<br>
