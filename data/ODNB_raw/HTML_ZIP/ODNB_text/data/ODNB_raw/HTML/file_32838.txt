<span class="headword">Dixon,  Henry Horatio</span>  (1869&#150;1953), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born in Dublin on 19 May 1869, the son of George Dixon (<i>d</i>. 1871), the owner of a soap works who had scientific interests, and his wife, Rebecca, daughter of George Yeates of Dublin, whose family were scientific instrument makers. Following his father's death, Henry, his six brothers, and two sisters were raised by his mother. He was educated at Rathmines School and entered Trinity College in 1887 with an exhibition. He obtained a classical scholarship in 1890 but changed to natural science, in which he obtained a senior moderatorship in 1891. After working in Bonn under Eduard Strasburger he returned in 1894 to Trinity College as assistant to E. P. Wright, whom he succeeded in the university chair of botany in 1904. In 1906 he became director of the botanic garden; in 1910 keeper of the herbarium; and in 1922 professor of plant biology in Trinity College. In 1907 Dixon married Dorothea Mary, daughter of Sir John Franks, secretary of the Irish land commission. They had three sons, all of whom maintained the tradition of academic distinction, one as a neurologist, and two as biochemists and fellows of King's College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>Two of the major fields of work at Bonn were the studies of nuclear division and of transpiration and ascent of sap. The significance of reduction division (meiosis) was just being recognized in the Strasburger school where a great part of the cytological studies was based on hand sections. In a paper to the Royal Irish Academy in 1895 Dixon expressed the view that bivalents owed their appearance to the joining of chromosomes rather than the splitting of some structure. In the school of botany he maintained his interests in cytology and kept a collection of his sections of endosperm made in Bonn until 1926. From these sections he had developed the idea of a mitotic hormone, as the sections appeared to show waves of nuclear division. They showed a zone of prophases, followed by zones of metaphases, anaphases, and telophases. This must have been one of the first demonstrations of synchronous cell divisions. Photographs of the sections, made about 1892, were published by the Royal Dublin Society in 1946.<br>
<br>Dixon's most important work was on transpiration and water relations of plants. This also stemmed from his association with Strasburger who in 1890&#150;93 published work on channels of transport of sap. Dixon's observations of Strasburger's experiments demonstrating that the ascent of sap killed sections of trees posed the problem of possible physical mechanisms. Dixon, together with his great friend John Joly (1857&#150;1933), provided the solution in their classic paper published by the Royal Society of London in 1895, in which they established the role of cohesion of water as an essential factor in plant water relations. Dixon followed this paper with many studies on tensile strength of water and of sap containing gases in solution. Then followed a series of studies with W. R. G. Atkins on osmotic pressures in plant cells. Further studies concerned the resistance to flow of sap presented by the channels of transport and its relation to the detailed structure of wood.<br>
<br>In his presidential address to the botany section of the British Association (1922) Dixon put forward the view that rates of transport of sugar were such that the channel of transport could not possibly be the phloem but must be the xylem. (Later Dixon's former student T. G. Mason, working on the subject of transport of sugar in yams and later in cotton, showed that the phloem was responsible for the transport and that what Dixon regarded as an impossibly fast rate of movement did occur. The mechanism remained to be elucidated.)<br>
<br>Dixon was full of ideas, some of them with terrifying consequences, as when he measured hydrostatic pressures in leaf cells by compressing leafy shoots in glass containers which occasionally blew up. He grew seedlings in sterile culture in 1892, some thirty years before this became a fashionable research procedure. In 1902 he published the compensated manometric technique for study of respiration and photosynthesis in plants, which was subsequently much extended by others. In the very different field of taxonomy, he developed keys for the recognition of timbers, especially mahogany, and worked on the experimental taxonomy of some of the saxifrages of co. Kerry. His publications included <span class="italic">Transpiration and the Ascent of Sap in Plants</span> (1914) and <span class="italic">Practical Plant Biology</span> (1922).<br>
<br>The school of botany in Trinity College, Dublin, was Dixon's creation. The building and laboratory, opened in 1907, were Dixon's design and the school and the activities within it were an expression of his orderly and very active nature. His critical and at the same time cordial personality pervaded it. Visitors travelled there from all over the world.<br>
<br>Dixon, who retired from his chair in 1949, served in many public capacities. He was a commissioner of Irish Lights, a trustee of the National Library of Ireland, and a member of the council of the International Institute of Agriculture. He was elected FRS in 1908 and was Croonian lecturer in 1937; he was awarded the Boyle medal (1916) of the Royal Dublin Society, over which he later presided, and was an honorary fellow of Trinity College. He was an honorary life member of the American Society of Plant Physiologists. He died at his home, Somerset House, Temple Road, Dublin, on 20 December 1953; he was survived by his wife.<br>
