<span class="headword">Price, Sir  Charles</span>, first baronet  (1708&#150;1772), <span class="occ">politician in Jamaica</span>, was born on 20 August 1708, probably in St Catherine's parish, Jamaica, the eldest son of the thirteen children of Colonel Charles Price (1677/8&#150;1730), and Sarah (<i>d</i>. after 1730), daughter of Philip Edmunds of Jamaica. Price's grandfather Francis was one of the early English settlers in Jamaica following its capture by the English in 1658, and his father extensively developed several plots of land as sugar plantations. Price himself was educated in England; he matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, on 21 October 1724, and embarked upon a grand tour. He returned to Jamaica in January 1730, shortly before his father's death on 23 May.<br>
<br>Within a few years of his return Price had married Mary Sharpe. They had four sons, the first being born in 1732 or 1733, if his stated age at matriculation is correct. Price was first elected to the Jamaican assembly on 13 March 1732, and aligned himself with the faction headed by Judge Dennis Kelly. When Price and Kelly quarrelled at the end of the 1730s the governor, Edward Trelawny, won over Price to his interest. On 17 April 1745 he was elected temporary speaker of the assembly when the incumbent was ill, and the following year he became speaker. He acted in close alliance with Governor Trelawny in promoting the interests of the planters. In October 1751 he helped to unite the various political factions in the Jamaica Association. Originally the Jamaica Association was pledged to support the governor as long as he had the interests of the colony at heart, and it continued to have good relations with Charles Knowles for about a year after he replaced Trelawny as governor. However, when political conflict broke out again in 1754, Knowles attempted to move the capital from Spanish Town and imprisoned Price and fifteen of his supporters. Price had excellent contacts with the ministry in London and eventually won the resultant power struggle when Knowles was recalled in 1756. The capital returned to Spanish Town.<br>
<br>In October 1763 Price retired from the assembly on grounds of ill health, his son, also <a href="#cosubject_22744">Charles [<i>see below</i>]</a>, taking over as speaker. He made a brief return in 1765, but in 1768 he was nominated to the council by Governor William Trelawny, and on 13 August he was made a baronet. He died at his house, The Decoy, on 26 July 1772, custos of St Catherine's, judge of the supreme court, and a major-general in the militia.<br>
<br>His eldest son, <a name="cosubject_22744"></a><span class="headword">Sir Charles Price</span>, second baronet  (1732/3&#150;1788), succeeded to an over-extended estate which collapsed as a consequence of the American War of Independence. Having been educated at Trinity College, Oxford (he matriculated 14 May 1752, aged nineteen), he returned to Jamaica, and in 1753 was elected to the Jamaican assembly. He married Elizabeth Hannah (1747/8&#150;1771), daughter of John Hudson Guy, of Berkshire House, chief justice of Jamaica, the widow of John Woodcock. They had no children. Price served as speaker of the assembly from 1763. As speaker in 1765, during the confrontation with Governor William Henry Lyttelton, he refused to apply to the governor to confirm the assembly's privileges, and led the assembly through the crises of repeated dissolutions. He remained speaker until 1775, when he retired to take an extended sojourn in England to try to rescue his near bankrupt estate. He returned to Jamaica in 1779, and by 1786 was forced to appeal to the assembly for assistance. Little was forthcoming and properties had to be sold, including Rose Hall for &pound;18,000. Price died in Spanish Town on 18 October 1788. His widow, Lydia Ann, herself the widow of his brother Rose Price (<i>d</i>. 1765), sold The Decoy for a paltry &pound;2500 in 1789.<br>
