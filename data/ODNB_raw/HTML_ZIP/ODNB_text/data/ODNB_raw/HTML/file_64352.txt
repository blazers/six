<span class="headword">Macready <span class="st"> [M'cready]</span>,  William</span>  (1755&#150;1829), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born in Dublin, where his father was highly esteemed both in his trade as an upholsterer and as a civic leader. Although he served an apprenticeship with his father, William Macready embarked on a stage career, with engagements in Kilkenny (1776) and Edinburgh (1776&#150;7). He played at the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin during 1783&#150;4 and 1784&#150;5, appearing as Egerton alongside Charles Macklin (as Sir Pertinax McSycophant) in that elderly actor's own play <span class="italic">The Man of the World</span>. The two men, who shared an irascible temperament, struck up a rapport, and Macklin helped Macready to secure engagements in Liverpool and Manchester. In Manchester, Macready met Christina Ann Birch (1765&#150;1803), from a genteel family of clergymen, surgeons, and schoolmasters; they acted together&#151;Bob Acres and Julia in Sheridan's <span class="italic">The Rivals</span> was a typical pairing&#151;and on 17 June 1786 they were married at the collegiate church.<br>
<br>On 18 September 1786 Macready began his metropolitan career at Covent Garden, where he remained for ten years. While he never progressed beyond the role of supporting player, he had some success as an adapter of old plays. Christina did not act: she gave birth to eight children, three of whom died in infancy. Following his brief management (1797) at the Royalty Theatre in the East End of London, Macready took the New Theatre, Birmingham, where he had managed a successful summer season in 1796, and finally severed his link with Covent Garden. In the next few years his activities radiated to Leicester, Stafford, Sheffield, and beyond. He was an exacting manager, setting exceptionally high standards for lighting and scenery, attaching great importance to rehearsals (backed up by an elaborate system of fines, strictly enforced), and engaging the most celebrated actors of the day (Mrs Siddons, Thomas King, and Master Betty). By March 1803 he was sufficiently prosperous to send his sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17741/', "William Charles Macready (1793&#150;1873)")</script> and Edward, to Rugby School, where William Birch (a cousin of Christina's) was a master. Christina Macready died on 3 December 1803.<br>
<br>In 1807, with economic depression setting in, Macready took the disastrous decision to abandon Birmingham, where the landlord had doubled the rent, for a newly built theatre in Manchester. His affairs were so parlous in December 1808 that his elder son, William, left Rugby to save money and help his father. Macready managed to extricate himself from Manchester, but within a year he was imprisoned&#151;albeit for only a few weeks&#151;in Lancaster Castle, and the sixteen-year-old William set off to rescue his father's companies in Leicester, Chester, and Newcastle upon Tyne. Back in Birmingham, the young William made his stage d&eacute;but, as Romeo, on 7 June 1810, and for the next four years the fortunes of father and son were contiguous, until their similar temperaments and the latter's burgeoning talents hastened a separation of their ways.<br>
<br>The senior Macready settled first in Carlisle, where he had a theatre built, and thereafter in Berwick, Dumfries, and Newcastle upon Tyne, before descending on Bristol, where with William's help he took the Theatre Royal in 1819. His years in Bristol&#151;with less successful forays to Bath&#151;brought him the respectability and relative prosperity which, Micawber-like, he had always expected to &#145;turn up&#146;. On 26 November 1821, at Whitehaven, he married Kathleen (known as Sarah) Desmond (1789/90&#150;1853), who was certainly his professional partner of several years' standing and, assuming, as most did, that George Macready (<i>b</i>. 8 July 1814) was not the nephew he was claimed to be but the couple's son, already his wife in all but name. A handsome woman, with a commanding stage presence, Sarah Macready was an attraction in her own right, in particular as Meg Merrilies, Lady Macbeth, and Hermione. Macready maintained a strong musical side and a creditable standard of scenery, costumes, and effects; he supplemented his regular company with visiting stars (Maria Foote, John Liston, and Madame Vestris, as well as his increasingly eminent son William, who was always a popular draw), but was not above introducing animal acts.<br>
<br>Irascible, improvident, exacting, and exasperating, William Macready died in Bristol on 11 April 1829, a respected freemason, and was buried in Bristol Cathedral on 18 April. In his will he left all his property and rights in his theatres to his widow, Sarah, their daughter, Mazarina Emily (1824/5&#150;1878), and &#145;the boy known by the name of George William Macready&#146;. His son William, with Richard Brunton, actually held the lease of the Theatre Royal, Bristol, until 1833, when Sarah took it over in her own right. Following her death on 8 March 1853, it passed, in accordance with her wishes, to her son-in-law James Chute, the husband of her daughter Mazarina (Maggie), who formed a minor (at least) theatrical dynasty.<br>
