<span class="headword">Dent,  Peter</span>  (1628/9&#150;1689), <span class="occ">apothecary and naturalist</span>, the son of Peter Dent of Cambridge, was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1649/50. He acquired properties in the parish of St Sepulchre, Cambridge, soon after 1650 and was in practice there by 1657. These properties, which he improved during his tenure, included a small leasehold shop at Bridge Street with adjoining house, warehouse, and other premises, and a separate leasehold garden behind the church, occupied by a house and two or three cottages. Dent's first wife, Katherine, died in 1659 giving birth to their second child, who died shortly afterwards. He married, within fifteen months, Elizabeth Pleys. She was buried on 2 March 1709. From these two marriages, thirteen children were baptized at St Sepulchre, including three named Peter, two of whom died in infancy.<br>
<br>Dent obtained a Lambeth MB degree in 1678, probably on the strength of recommendations from his friends and patients; in the custom of the time, he practised both as apothecary and physician, and may have taken patients into his home for treatment. He obtained a Cambridge degree by incorporation in 1680. Through his interest in botany he became a member of John Ray's (1627&#150;1705) circle of friends. He contributed to Ray's <span class="italic">English Catalogues</span> of 1670 and 1677, and was singled out for mention in the introduction to the latter edition as having recorded nine plants not included in Ray's <span class="italic">Catalogus plantarum circa Cantabrigiam nascentium</span> (1660). He also contributed to Ray's great <span class="italic">Historia plantarum</span> (3 vols., 1686&#150;1704). In its preface Ray expressed his obligation to Dent for many observations. In 1685 a second <span class="italic">Appendix</span> to Ray's Cambridge catalogue appeared anonymously, its sixty plants having been principally communicated by Dent. Raven states that this appendix was not Ray's work, and was uncertain whether it was due to Dent  (Raven, 122), but since Ray would not have sought the credit in these circumstances it is likely to have been Dent's work.<br>
<br>Dent's observations on the structure of the trachea in the male of most ducks were credited by Ray in <span class="italic">The Ornithology</span> (1678), where Ray described Dent as &#145;an ingenious observer&#146;  (Willughby and Ray, <span class="italic">Ornithology</span>, 9). It was the contemporary compliment and Raven remarked that this &#145;is a nice point to find noticed so early&#146;  (Raven, 317). Ray also acknowledged &#145;Dominus Petrus Dent&#146; in his preface to Willughby's <span class="italic">Historia piscium</span> (1686). In English, his acknowledgement reads &#145;Master Peter Dent communicated several observations concerning cartilaginous flat fish, especially of the uterus and eggs of rays, and fine sketches, first of the fish themselves, and then of their inner parts&#146;.<br>
<br>Dent died on 3 September 1689 and was buried two days later at the church of St Sepulchre, Cambridge. He was survived by his widow, at least two sons, Pierce (1663&#150;1727) and William (1665&#150;1694), and three daughters. Pierce Dent inherited his father's practice as apothecary, together with his property, and like his father was interested in botany and entomology, and a friend of Ray. He married Deborah Ewin in 1692 and they had seven children before she died in 1702. There were no children from his second marriage, to Bridgett, who survived him.<br>
<br>Peter Dent (1637/8&#150;1717) was probably a cousin; he joined Dent in Cambridge about 1663, and was admitted to Trinity College in 1671/2. By about 1691 he was described as a &#145;cook&#146;, meaning a catering contractor, probably to one of the Cambridge colleges. He was twice married, and had five children between 1671 and 1708, during which time he lived in one of Dent's houses.<br>
