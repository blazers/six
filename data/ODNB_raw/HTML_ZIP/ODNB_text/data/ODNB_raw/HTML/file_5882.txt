<span class="headword">Coleridge,  Henry Nelson</span>  (1798&#150;1843), <span class="occ">barrister and writer</span>, was born on 25 October 1798 at Ottery St Mary, Devon, the fifth of the six surviving sons of Colonel James Coleridge (1759&#150;1836) and his wife, Frances Duke Taylor, daughter of John Taylor. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5884/', "James Duke Coleridge (1789&#150;1857)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5887/', "Sir John Taylor Coleridge (1790&#150;1876)")</script> were his brothers. He was educated at Eton College, where he became part of the brilliant academic circle, led by W. M. Praed, which produced <span class="italic">The Etonian</span> magazine. This evolved into <span class="italic">Knight's Quarterly</span> when the contributors went up to Cambridge, and Henry Coleridge contributed to it under the pseudonym Gerard Montgomery. He achieved great success at King's College, Cambridge, standing second for the university scholarship in 1819, winning both the Latin and Greek Ode prizes in 1820 and the Greek Ode prize in 1821, and eventually becoming a fellow.<br>
<br>At Christmas 1822 Henry Coleridge met his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5889/', "Sara Coleridge (1802&#150;1852)")</script>, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5888/', "Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772&#150;1834)")</script>, and by March 1823 they were engaged. His only sister Fanny, the only person to know of this, anticipated family disapproval and cautioned that it should be kept secret, but a year later Henry Coleridge told his father and shortly afterwards was sent to the West Indies to accompany his cousin, William Hart Coleridge, who was to become bishop of Barbados. The reason for his trip was ostensibly to improve his health, which was indeed poor throughout his life, but it is likely that the real reason was his family's attempt to break off the engagement. However, in 1826, Henry Coleridge's account of his excursion, <span class="italic">Six Months in the West Indies</span>, was published anonymously and not only upset some members of his family by its flippant tone and lively anecdotes but also included a thinly disguised reference to his love for Sara.<br>
<br>In 1826 Henry Coleridge was called to the bar, but both his salary and health remained precarious. In 1828 he became secretary to the committee of the newly opened King's College, London University, but after nine months had to leave because the college faced financial restraints. Throughout his life apparent success disguised financial insecurity, often caused by generous loans which were never repaid to him. He eventually married Sara, on 3 September 1829, with the family blessing. Their first home was in Hampstead, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge lived near by in Highgate. From 1830 until his father-in-law's death in 1834 he made regular visits and began to record Coleridge's conversation, a labour of love which became <span class="italic">Table Talk</span>, published in 1835. Coleridge's conversation was famously expansive, and Sara praised her husband's ability in this publication to &#145;narrow&#146; him. Some critics disagreed, however, feeling that Henry had not so much &#145;narrowed&#146; Coleridge as distorted him, twisting him into a reflection of his own conservative vision. Opinion on <span class="italic">Table Talk</span> remains divided. As Coleridge's literary executor, Henry Coleridge then began the huge task of collecting and editing his work. He was helped by Sara and she continued the work after his death. He published four volumes of <span class="italic">Literary Remains</span>; new editions of other work including <span class="italic">The Friend</span>, and <span class="italic">Aids to Reflection</span>; and began assembling material for another edition of <span class="italic">Biographia literaria</span>.<br>
<br>In addition to this and his work as a chancery barrister, Coleridge also lectured on equity to the Incorporated Law Society and contributed reviews to the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> and the <span class="italic">British Critic</span>. In 1830 he had written the first volume of <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Study of Greek Classic Poets</span>. It was well received and went into several editions, but his legal career began to flourish at that time and he never found the time to write the proposed second volume.<br>
<br>Contemporary accounts suggest that Henry Coleridge was a man of great wit, irresistible charm, and sociability, adored by children and fond of flying kites. For much of his life he had suffered from rheumatic and spinal complaints and in May 1842 he lost the use of his legs from spinal paralysis. He died on 26 January 1843 at 10 Chester Place, Regent's Park, London, where the family had moved in 1837. He was survived by his wife and two children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5883/', "Herbert Coleridge")</script>, philologist, and Edith. On 3 February he was buried in Highgate cemetery, Middlesex, in the same grave as Samuel Taylor Coleridge, a grave which would later be shared with his wife, his mother-in-law, and his son.<br>
