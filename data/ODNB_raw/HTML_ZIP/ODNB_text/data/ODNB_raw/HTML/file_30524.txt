<span class="headword">Bailey,  Frederick Marshman</span>  (1882&#150;1967), <span class="occ">explorer and naturalist</span>, elder son of Major (later Lieutenant-Colonel) Frederick Bailey of the Royal Engineers, was born on 3 February 1882 at Lahore, where his father served in the Indian army for a few years. Later his father became head of the Indian forestry survey department and, on retirement from the army on health grounds, lecturer in forestry at Edinburgh University. His mother was Florence, daughter of John Clark Marshman, who had landed with his missionary parents in India in 1799. Marshman became the <span class="italic">Times</span> correspondent and was one of the founders of the newspaper the <span class="italic">Pioneer of India</span>.<br>
<br>F. M. Bailey was educated at Edinburgh Academy, where, to his disappointment, he spent only three years before going to Wellington College and then to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. His first commissioned posting was in 1900 to the Middlesex regiment, which was then in the Nilgiri hills in India. There he became interested in birds, butterflies, and plants&#151;an interest which he maintained throughout his travels, and which produced valuable material and many new species for museums in India and Britain. He transferred to the Durham light infantry, in which he developed proficiency in polo. His horsemanship, and the influence of Lord Roberts, a family friend, led to his posting to the 17th Bengal lancers. Hoping to see active service, in 1903 he asked to be transferred to the 32nd Sikh pioneers, whom he accompanied to Sikkim. This introduced him to Tibet, a country which intrigued him for the rest of his life and brought him a high reputation as an explorer.<br>
<br>Bailey was a member of the mission to Lhasa in 1903&#150;4 led by Francis Younghusband to resolve the intransigence of the Tibetan government in implementing the Anglo-Chinese convention of 1890. On successfully completing this mission Bailey, now proficient in Tibetan, was given his first opportunity to explore when sent to report on the trade and trade routes between India and Gartok, in western Tibet. He travelled hundreds of miles, and lived for weeks at a time at a height of over 14,000 feet. Although only twenty-two, he gave a most detailed report on this assignment, which was published by the government of India (1905). In 1905 he applied to be transferred to the political department, and later that year went to Gyantse as trade agent to relieve the official due for leave. After the official's return, Bailey was for two years in the Chumbi valley, a wedge of Tibet which thrusts south of the Himalayas between Sikkim and Bhutan. It was a suitable area in which to pursue his interest in natural history. In 1911, accompanied by his young Tibetan servant, he embarked on an expedition to explore the Tsangpo River, discover its source from the Tibetan plateau, and find out whether, as previously reported, it had falls of some 150 feet in height. An approach from the south was barred by unfriendly hill people and was totally discouraged by the Indian government, so Bailey decided to enter in the east from China; he therefore obtained a passport in Peking (Beijing) which allowed him to travel through Szechwan (Sichuan) and Yunnan. He travelled to Ichang (Yichang) on the Yangtze (Yangzi) by steamer and from there hired a small boat to take him through the Yangtze gorges. He trekked through this most difficult mountainous area to Tatsienlu (Dajianlu) and eventually to Batang on the Tibetan frontier. He did not, however, manage to reach the Tsangpo, but returned to India through Mishmi country. In his book <span class="italic">China&#151;Tibet&#151;Assam</span> (1945) he gave a fine account of this journey.<br>
<br>Hoping to solve the mystery of the Tsangpo Gorge, Bailey set out in 1913 with Captain Henry Treise Morshead, Royal Engineers, who worked on the survey of India and, in defiance of official orders, they entered Tibet from Assam. Their three-and-a-half-month journey has been described as one of the longest and most remarkable journeys of exploration completed on foot in the twentieth century. It proved that the Tsangpo broke through the Himalayan range to emerge on the plains of India as the Brahmaputra. In Bailey's opinion the chief results of this expedition were to map some 380 miles of the Tsangpo, to discover the two portals of the Tsangpo Gorge, and the high mountains Gyala Peri and Namcha Barwa, and to recognize that the Subansiri was another river which had its source in Tibet and pierced the main Himalayan range. On this expedition he discovered the renowned blue poppy, and collected fragmentary flowering specimens on which the species <i>Meconopsis baileyi</i> was based. It was Kingdon Ward who introduced the plant to Britain in 1924 from seeds from the same locality. <span class="italic">No Passport to Tibet</span> (1957) was Bailey's account of the journey. As a result of his discoveries, Bailey was appointed CIE in 1915.<br>
<br>In 1915 Bailey was sent to France with the 31st Sikh pioneers. Wounded at Ypres, he returned to Britain. On recovery he was dispatched to Gallipoli with the Gurkhas, only to be wounded again by a bullet which passed through both his legs. Pronounced unfit for active service, he returned to the political department of the India Office. In 1916 he was posted to India, where he worked for two years as political officer in Kohat and then Charsada. In March 1917 he was sent as a political officer to Shustar, Persia. Early in 1918 he was ordered to Kashgar in Chinese Turkestan and then to Tashkent in Russian territory to report on the conditions in the region following the revolution of 1917 and the collapse of the eastern front under German pressure. Subversive movements seemed likely to affect the equilibrium on the north-west frontier of India; Bailey tried to establish good relations and influence the Tashkent authorities in favour of the allies. Because of the hostility of the Bolshevik government in Russian Turkestan, he had to go underground. Since he understood and could speak limited Russian, he could repeatedly change his identity. Despite having a price on his head, he got himself recruited into the Russian counter-espionage service, with the task, among other duties, of tracking a foreign agent named Bailey. He was thus able to reach Bukhara and finally Mashhad in Persia. His <span class="italic">Mission to Tashkent</span> (1946) tells the fascinating story of these dangerous adventures.<br>
<br>Bailey married on 7 April 1921 Irma, only child of William Hepburn, second Lord Cozens-Hardy, a barrister and secretary to his father, the first Lord Cozens-Hardy, when master of the rolls. There were no children. In the year of his marriage he was appointed political officer in Sikkim and, while living in Gangtok for seven years, he was able to travel into Tibet and Bhutan. He became a personal friend of the Dalai Lama, with whom he could converse freely. He next spent some months as a political officer in central India before going to Srinagar, Kashmir, as resident, and eventually to Nepal as British minister. He retired in 1938. After the outbreak of war in 1939 he joined the Home Guard and was in charge of the north Norfolk auxiliary units. For almost two years he was a king's messenger based at Miami and Washington.<br>
<br>Bailey was an unassuming man of handsome appearance and military bearing and spoke in a soft voice. He was modest and gentle-mannered, with immense charm and persuasiveness, and a fine sense of humour which earned him the nickname Hatter. Although he sometimes defied authority, his results usually justified his resolve. In 1912 the Royal Geographical Society granted him the Gill memorial award and in 1916 its gold medal. He also received in 1920 the premier award of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, the Livingstone gold medal. In natural history his major interest was butterflies, which he collected in all his travels. His specimens were given to the British Museum (Natural History) and his cabinets of duplicates went to the Metropolitan Museum in New York. His fine collection of birds, mostly from Nepal, and his collection of mammals, were donated to the British Museum. He published a number of papers on many aspects of natural history. Bailey died at his home, Warborough House, Stiffkey, Norfolk, on 17 April 1967.<br>
