<span class="headword">Bovill, Sir  William</span>  (1814&#150;1873), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 26 May 1814 at All Hallows Barking, Essex, a younger son of Benjamin Bovill, corn merchant, of Durnford Lodge, Wimbledon. He did not go to university, but began his legal career in articles with solicitors in the city of London. He then practised as a special pleader below the bar, but soon joined Middle Temple. He was called to the bar in 1841, joining the home circuit. On 20 August 1844 he married Maria, eldest daughter of John Henry Bolton, of Lee Park, Blackheath; they had many children.<br>
<br>Bovill's familiarity with solicitors helped him at the bar. Another connection, with a firm of manufacturers in the East End of London, gave him some knowledge of engineering, which led to a considerable patent practice, in addition to the commercial cases which were his bread and butter. He became a QC in 1855 and was elected MP for Guildford in 1857, though he was not active in the House of Commons for several years. He did, however, take an interest in legal reform, and was responsible for two acts, the <span class="roman">Petition of Right Act</span> and the <span class="roman">Partnership Law Amendment Act</span>. In 1865 he pressed for the amalgamation of all the law courts into one building, and in 1866 for a better library at the Patent Office. On 6 July 1866 he was appointed solicitor-general in Lord Derby's last administration; but he held office for only five months. In November 1866 he succeeded Sir William Erle as chief justice of the common pleas, Sir John Karslake replacing him as solicitor-general. He had been elected treasurer of the Middle Temple a few months earlier, but resigned on being raised to the bench. In 1870 he was made honorary DCL of the University of Oxford, and was also elected a fellow of the Royal Society.<br>
<br>Bovill became famous throughout the country as judge in the first Tichborne trial, one of the most celebrated cases of the Victorian period, when he ordered the plaintiff, who claimed to be Roger, the long-lost son of the Tichbornes, to be indicted for perjury. He was much criticized for failing to appear impartial at the trial and was widely believed to have expressed his opinion against the claimant at a lord mayor's dinner before the trial opened. Bovill's admirers claimed that no judge was more learned, forceful, or acute, though even they admitted that he lacked eloquence. He was also praised for his memory and industry, and for scrupulously returning briefs if he did not feel that he could give them due attention. But he was widely believed to leap to conclusions before hearing all of the evidence, and the publicity which was given to his most controversial case continued to tarnish his reputation in public eyes. It was rumoured that he begged people not to mention the case to him, saying &#145;It weighs upon me&#146;  (Woodruff, 393). He fell ill in 1873 and was thought to be recovering when, at noon on 1 November 1873 he died of apoplexy at his home, Coombe House, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey. He had been appointed a member of the judicature commission in the same year, but his work on the midland circuit and then ill health prevented him from taking much part in its activities. His wife survived him.<br>
