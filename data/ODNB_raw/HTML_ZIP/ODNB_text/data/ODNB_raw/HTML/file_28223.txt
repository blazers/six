<span class="headword">Verelst,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1704, <em>d.</em> 1752), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 17 January 1704. He was the fifth of eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74502/', "John Verelst (c.1675&#150;1734)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28222/', "Verelst, Simon Pieterszoon (bap. 1644, d. 1710x)")</script>], portraitist, and his wife, Anne. William Verelst was included in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> in the article on <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28222/', "Simon Verelst")</script> under the name Willem Verelst and was erroneously described as the son of Cornelius Verelst. William presumably studied with his father; he was the executor of the latter's will, and his stylistic traits of clear profile, bright colour, and a slight gawkiness are close to his father's manner. Thieme and Becker identified him with the Guillaume Verelst who received payment for three paintings from members of the Rotterdam wine traders' guild in 1729. Signed works appear from 1732 onwards. His most ambitious painting is the 35 figure group portrait <span class="italic">Representation of the audience given by the trustees for establishing the colony in Georgia in America, to Tomo Chachi Mico of Yamacran and his Indians on the 3rd day of July in the year of Our Lord 1734</span> (Winterthur Museum, Delaware). William's eldest brother, Herman (<i>bap</i>. 24 Jan 1693), was the accountant for the Georgia council, which probably explains why William was chosen as artist; although it seems noteworthy that John Verelst had painted portraits of four Native American chiefs who visited London in 1709. William Verelst's other work includes a few conversation pieces; <span class="italic">The Gough Family</span> of 1741 (priv. coll.) has received praise, its lively expressions, fresh colour, and beautifully rendered draperies masking its awkward perspective and anatomy. Among his portraits of individuals, that of John Dean (NPG) is of anecdotal interest: Dean was the sole survivor of a much-publicized shipwreck. The portrait of a woman identified (incorrectly) by an inscription as Eleanor Mytton (Sothebys, 13 April 1994), dated 1738, shows him at his best; her personable dog and the striking blue of her silk dress make for a very lively effect. A portrait allegedly of Tobias Smollett, and said to be signed and dated 1756  (Kerslake, 254), has presumably had its date misread, since Verelst was buried in the parish of St Christopher-le-Stocks, London, on 20 October 1752.<br>
