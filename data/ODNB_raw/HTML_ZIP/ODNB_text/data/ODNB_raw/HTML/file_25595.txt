<span class="headword">Simpson,  Thomas</span>  (1808&#150;1840), <span class="occ">Arctic explorer</span>, the elder son of Alexander Simpson (<i>d</i>. 1821), schoolmaster of Dingwall in Ross-shire, and his second wife, Mary, was born at Dingwall on 2 July 1808. As a boy he was delicate, with a tendency to consumption. He was destined for the ministry, and at the age of seventeen entered King's College, Aberdeen, whence he graduated MA in 1829. He had developed into a strong, active man, so that, instead of proceeding to the ministry, he took a post with the Hudson's Bay Company. This followed the visit in 1825 of his cousin George Simpson, administrator in the company, whose descriptions of Canadian life inspired Thomas, his brother Alexander, and his half-brother Aemilius all to enter the company's service.<br>
<br>Simpson arrived in Canada in 1829, but caused trouble among the m&eacute;tis (of mixed French and Indian blood) at Fort Garry (Winnipeg). In July 1836 he was appointed second in command, with particular responsibility for surveying and scientific investigations, of an expedition, sent under chief factor Peter Warren Dease, &#145;to complete the discovery and survey of the northern shores of America&#146;. While Dease, with the party of twelve men, started for Great Slave Lake, Simpson went to Red River settlement, where he spent some months refreshing and extending his knowledge of astronomy and practice in observations. On 1 December he started out to join Dease, whom, after an interesting and adventurous winter journey, he found at Fort Chipewyan, on the shore of Lake Athabasca. In June 1837 they continued their journey, and leaving a few men at Fort Norman, to prepare winter quarters by Great Bear Lake, reached the sea on 9 July. They then turned west, along the coast until, in longitude 154&deg;23' W, the boats were stopped by the ice. It was determined that Simpson should try to reach Barrow Point on foot, which he succeeded in doing on 4 August and there took possession of his discoveries for Britain. On the 6th he rejoined Dease, and on the same day they started for the Mackenzie River, which they reached without accident on the 17th. Their progress up the river was slow and laborious, and they did not reach Fort Norman until 4 September. On the 25th they arrived at the station on Great Bear Lake, which they named Fort Confidence, and there they wintered.<br>
<br>On 7 June 1838 the party started up Dease River, but its ascent proved very difficult because of rapids. Then, carrying their baggage and boats over the watershed, they descended the Coppermine River, and endeavoured to examine the coast to the eastward. The season, however, was so bad that they made but little way, and from Point Turnagain returned to their winter quarters at Fort Confidence, which they reached on 14 September. On 15 June 1839 they again started for the Coppermine, where they had left their boats, and with a more favourable season went eastward as far as the Boothia peninsula. They were, however, unable to determine whether there was any passage to the Gulf of Boothia, or to connect their coast navigation with the known King William Sea to the north. They had almost, but not quite, discovered the north-west passage. The advanced season compelled them to return, and by 24 September they were again at Fort Confidence, whence, after a very severe journey, they reached Fort Simpson on the Mackenzie on 14 October. Leaving Dease there, Simpson set out on 2 December, and reached Red River settlement on 2 February 1840. He remained there until the summer, and on 6 June started for the United States and England hoping to ensure that he, not Dease (whom he considered a ditherer), took the credit for their discoveries, and hoping to secure approval for a further expedition. On 14 June he was killed by a gunshot wound in the head. The men of mixed race who were with him deposed that he went mad, killed two of the party, and then committed suicide; others suggested that he was attacked by his own men, two of whom he shot before he was killed. It is clear that he had made himself unpopular because of his petulance and readiness to criticize, although the latter trait makes his writings a rich source of quotations for later historians. In particular, his aversion to those of mixed race, whose &#145;extravagant and profligate habits&#146;  (Simpson, cited in Sampson, <span class="italic">DCB</span>) he censured, made him a difficult member of an exploring party and would have made him an impossible leader.<br>
<br>Simpson's <span class="italic">Narrative of Discoveries on the North Coast of America</span> was edited by his brother Alexander and published in 1843. Alexander corresponded for two years with the London committee of the Hudson's Bay Company to try to clear Thomas's name and to get a pension paid to his mother as a reward for his brother's services. In 1845 he published <span class="italic">The Life and Travels of Thomas Simpson</span> to try to gain public sympathy for his brother. He was largely unsuccessful, partly because the Royal Geographical Society and the establishment in general tended to underestimate the contribution to Arctic exploration of fur traders, preferring to attribute achievements to the Royal Navy, and partly because of Simpson's pushy character and unpleasant death.<br>
