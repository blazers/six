<span class="headword">Calvert,  Frank</span>  (1828&#150;1908), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, was born on 3 September 1828 at strada Zecca, Valletta, Malta, the youngest of seven children of James Calvert (1778&#150;1852), civil servant and grain merchant, and his wife, Louisa Ann (1792&#150;1867), daughter of John and Mary Campbell Lander.<br>
<br>Educated in Valletta until the age of sixteen Calvert moved, in 1845, to the Dardanelles, where his uncle Charles Lander was British consul. The family engaged in a number of agricultural and commercial ventures in the Troad, with Frank's brother Frederick, who took over as British consul in 1846, playing the leading role. Frank assisted in these enterprises but spent much of his free time developing an unrivalled expertise in the topography of the Troad, through exploration, avid reading, and small-scale excavations. Between 1859 and 1865 he published a series of six articles in the <span class="italic">Archaeological Journal</span>; he was clearly preparing himself to tackle the problem of the location of Homeric Troy. Most contemporary scholars regarded P&#305;narba&#351;&#305;/Ball&#305; Dag, at the south end of the plain of Troy, as the most likely candidate but Charles Maclaren, who stayed with the Calverts in 1847, had championed Hisarl&#305;k, 4 miles further north.<br>
<br>Trial excavations on Ball&#305; Dag persuaded Calvert that Troy was not located there. Between 1863 and 1865 he dug four small trenches on the eastern part of Hisarl&#305;k, which he had purchased in 1855. By October 1863 he had uncovered part of the temple of Athena and was convinced that Homeric Troy lay underneath. In a letter to Charles Newton of the British Museum he proposed that the museum sponsor large-scale excavations and offered to donate all finds and the site itself to the museum, provided that he be given direction of the excavations. This generous proposal was not accepted, however, apparently because Frederick Calvert was at that time implicated in a major insurance fraud scandal.<br>
<br>When Heinrich Schliemann was leaving the Troad in August 1868, after disappointing soundings at P&#305;narba&#351;&#305;/Ball&#305; Dag, Calvert suggested that he excavate at Hisarl&#305;k; despite later claims Schliemann appears not to have realized, in 1868, that Hisarl&#305;k was a possible site of Troy. During Schliemann's early excavations at Hisarl&#305;k (1870&#150;73), Calvert provided expert advice and ready assistance in countless practical matters, but Schliemann shamelessly cheated him out of a fair price for the Helios metope in 1872 and for inscriptions in 1873. Calvert's perceptive observation, in 1873, that the strata so far excavated were either far earlier or far later than the Trojan War, angered Schliemann, who ridiculed Calvert in <span class="italic">Troy and its Remains</span> (1875) and misrepresented the extent of his 1863&#150;5 excavations at Hisarl&#305;k.<br>
<br>In 1874 Calvert succeeded his brother James as US consular agent at the Dardanelles, an unsalaried post which he held until his death. Relations with Schliemann remained cool for some years but improved when Schliemann resumed work at Hisarl&#305;k in 1878 and 1879. Calvert allowed Schliemann to excavate on his own land; in return Schliemann funded Calvert's excavation (1879&#150;80) of Hanay Tepe, then held to be another possible site of Troy. Calvert's account of his careful excavations forms an appendix to Schliemann's <span class="italic">Ilios</span> (1881). Throughout his life Calvert acted as host and guide to scholars visiting the Troad; he also had a sophisticated knowledge of the region's geology and botany, on which scholars, such as Rudolf Virchow, gratefully drew.<br>
<br>Over the years Calvert accumulated an important collection of antiquities from various sites in the Troad. Parts of this collection are now in the British Museum, at Boston, and at Worcester, Massachusetts. The bulk, however, was donated to the &Ccedil;anakkale Museum.<br>
<br>Calvert's view, that the stratum held by Schliemann to be that of Homeric Troy (Troy II) was too early, was vindicated in the 1890s, when D&ouml;rpfeld acknowledged that the recently discovered Troy VI level was a much more likely candidate. On 12 August 1908 Calvert died, unmarried, either at Calvert Mansion, &Ccedil;anakkale, or at the family farm, Thymbra, at Ak&ccedil;a K&ouml;y; he was buried a few days later in the consular cemetery &Ccedil;anak at &Ccedil;anakkale.<br>
