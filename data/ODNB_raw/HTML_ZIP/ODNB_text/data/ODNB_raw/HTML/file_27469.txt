<span class="headword">Tipping <span class="st"> [Typing]</span>,  William</span>  (1598&#150;1649), <span class="occ">author</span>, was the second son of Sir George Tipping (1560/61&#150;1627), of Whitfield and Draycott, Oxfordshire, and his wife, Dorothy (1564&#150;1637), daughter of John Burlace of Little Marlow, Buckinghamshire. With his younger brother Samuel he matriculated on 23 June 1615, aged sixteen, from Queen's College, Oxford, where his tutor was John Langhorne and from where he graduated BA on 23 October 1617. The brothers were admitted together on 29 January 1618 to Lincoln's Inn, but while Samuel pursued his legal studies and became a barrister in 1625, William returned to Oxfordshire. On the death of his father in 1627 he inherited land at Draycott and Attington. Anthony Wood, who says that he &#145;lived a single life many years in Canditch&#146;, Oxford, &#145;for the sake of scholastical company and of books&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3rd edn, 3.243&#150;4), also asserts that he never married, but by 5 October 1628, when his daughter Dorothea or Dorothy was baptized, Tipping had married Ursula, daughter of Sir John Brett of Edmonton, Middlesex. Their other children were George (their elder son), William (<i>bap</i>. 1631), and Margaret.<br>
<br>In 1633 Tipping published in Oxford <span class="italic">A Discourse of Eternitie</span>, thereby earning himself the nickname Eternity Tipping in the university. Relying on Latin rather than vernacular biblical quotation, it contends that both the ancients and &#145;newly discovered nations&#146;  (p. 10) possess a knowledge of God and eternity, and exhorts the reader to holiness and to reliance on the mercy of God. Tipping had become a justice of the peace for Oxfordshire, but in 1635 and 1636 he appeared several times before the court of high commission, having been charged with puritan practices. In 1639 he sold part of Draycott Manor.<br>
<br>In 1640 recovery from serious illness prompted Tipping to publish <span class="italic">A Return of Thankfulness</span>. Several sources claim that in the same year he was made vicar of Shabbington, Buckinghamshire, a family living, but it was his cousin John (<i>b</i>. 1601/2), a graduate of Magdalen Hall, Oxford, who was inducted. It is not clear whether Wood's statement that Tipping also took the covenant is correct, but his subsequent publications place him firmly among the godly. <span class="italic">The Father's Counsell</span> (1643) aimed to give &#145;usefull directions, for all young persons, especially elder brothers, whose portion it is &hellip; to be left in a fatherlesse or friendlesse condition&#146;. Addressed to &#145;my son&#146; it is a robust affirmation of the Calvinist doctrine of calling, castigating the &#145;pernicious sin&#146; and &#145;destructive vice&#146; of idleness: &#145;let no elder brother shelter himself under his fair estate, or plead the inheritance of his father, for his sloth&#146;; &#145;better thy son were a basket maker, than an idle drone&#146;  (p. 196). Regular, twice-daily religious exercises and catechizing of children and servants was to be accompanied by frugality, charity, and hospitality. In <span class="italic">The Preachers Plea</span> (1646), Tipping (named Typing on the title-page) deplored the lack of progress &#145;in debate on church-government&#146;  (p. 4) and the &#145;many drunken, ignorant, superstitious, Prophane Ministers [who] are crept into every corner of the land&#146;  (pp. 17&#150;18), criticized those who worried that prelatical power would be replaced by presbyterial power, and called for appropriate maintenance for pastors and for a parliamentary directory for catechizing the kingdom. His <span class="italic">The Remarkable Life and Death of the Lady Apollina Hall</span> (1647) was a conventional puritan &#145;pattern of imitation&#146;  (p. 3).<br>
<br>Tipping died at Waterstock, Oxfordshire, on 2 February 1649, and was buried in the chancel of the church there six days later. By his will, dated 2 October 1648, he left an annuity for an annual Good Friday sermon at All Saints' Church, Oxford, &pound;200 for other charitable uses in the city, and smaller sums for the poor and for maimed soldiers elsewhere. In keeping with his writings, his children were exhorted to industry and godliness. The will was proved by his widow and executor on 23 March 1649.<br>
