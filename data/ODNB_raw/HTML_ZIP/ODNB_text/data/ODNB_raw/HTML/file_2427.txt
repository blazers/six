<span class="headword">Birch,  Charles Bell</span>  (1832&#150;1893), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born in Brixton, Surrey, on 28 September 1832, the son of the author <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2431/', "Jonathan Birch (1783&#150;1847)")</script> and his wife, Esther, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brooke. At the age of twelve he became a pupil at the School of Design at Somerset House, London, where he remained for two years before accompanying his father to Berlin, where he studied at the Kurf&uuml;rstliche Akademie der K&uuml;nste and as an apprentice in the studios of the renowned German sculptors Ludwig Wilhelm Wichmann and Christian Daniel Rauch. While in Germany he produced his first important work: a bust of the then English ambassador, the eleventh earl of Westmorland, which was executed in marble for Friedrich Wilhelm IV, the king of Prussia.<br>
<br>On his return to Britain in 1852, Birch entered the Royal Academy Schools, where he gained two medals. In 1859 he entered the studio of John Henry Foley, whose principal assistant he was for the next ten years; while there he modelled the Arab horse in Foley's statue of General Outram, and after Foley's death in 1874 he succeeded to his studio. Birch's German education and his sympathies in art, along with his father's friendship with the Prussian royal family, initially commended him to the notice of the English court, resulting in crown prince Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia sitting to him for a portrait bust at Buckingham Palace shortly before his marriage to the princess royal in 1858.<br>
<br>Despite inspiring the admiration of the royal family, Birch's artistic progress was relatively slow until 1864, when the Art Union of London awarded him a premium of &pound;600 for his group <span class="italic">A Wood Nymph</span>, his first really popular work, which was later exhibited in Vienna, Philadelphia, and Paris. In 1880 he acknowledged his gratitude for this premium, giving the Art Union twenty original designs illustrating Byron's poem &#145;Lara&#146; which were published in 1880.<br>
<br>Birch was, however, an increasingly successful sculptor in his later life, receiving many civic, political, aristocratic, and imperial commissions. He was also a frequent exhibitor at the Royal Academy in Burlington House, where his realistic and vigorous military groups were much admired, particularly <span class="italic">The Last Call</span> (1879) and <span class="italic">Lieutenant Walter Hamilton</span> (1880); the latter work was sent to Dublin and its popularity led to Birch being elected an ARA in April 1880. In that year, however, he also produced the work by which he is most likely to be remembered: the unfortunate bronze griffin on the Temple Bar memorial (designed by Sir Horace Jones) at the beginning of Fleet Street, London.<br>
<br>Birch's portraiture was much more popular, and it included many imperial heroes; distinguished members of parliament, including Lord Beaconsfield, W. E. Gladstone, and Lord John Russell; various members of the British aristocracy; leading lights of the theatre world; and, on two occasions, Queen Victoria herself, the first statue destined for Aberdeen, the second for Udaipur in India. His work was particularly popular in Liverpool and in Sydney, Australia, where many of his statues were displayed. Alongside his successful work in marble and bronze portraiture he also worked in various other genres and with many other materials. He was commissioned to design and make a variety of silver statuettes for race cups, including an equestrian statuette of William III, ordered by the king of the Netherlands as a prize for the Orange Cup at Goodwood. Birch was also a creditable medallion portraitist, exhibited watercolours at the Royal Academy, and contributed as a draughtsman on stone and wood to the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> and other Victorian periodicals. In 1858 <span class="italic">CVIII Bible Pictures</span> was published from his designs, the first of several biblical works he illustrated for the publisher Bagster. In the early 1870s he joined in the &#145;New Sculptural&#146; vogue for works in terracotta and bronze.<br>
<br>Birch was considered by the majority of his contemporaries to possess good, if not outstanding, chiselling skills, and to be one of the most reliable portraitists of his generation, who was faithful to likeness and accurate in anatomy&#151;the prestige of whose work contributed much to the increasing reputation of the British school. His eighty-two Royal Academy sculptures ensured that his artistic reputation survived well beyond his death (at King's College Hospital, London, on 16 October 1893), though it has diminished considerably since then.<br>
