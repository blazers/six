<span class="headword">Penington,  John</span>  (1655&#150;1710), <span class="occ">Quaker apologist and controversialist</span>, was born in London or at his mother's estate of Worminghurst, Sussex. His parents were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21841/', "Isaac Penington (1616&#150;1679)")</script>, the friend of George Fox and William Penn, and his wife, Mary Springett, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Proude [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45819/', "Penington, Mary (bap. 1623, d. 1682)")</script>], the spiritual autobiographer. John's childhood years must have been turbulent, since his father faced near continual persecution in the early Restoration period. Isaac was in prison for much of the decade of the 1660s, and during this period he lost his estate and suffered significant diminution of his wife's estates in Kent. Nevertheless, John received a good education, first of all as a student of Thomas Ellwood, who was employed as family tutor, then at the Quaker boarding-school at Waltham Abbey. In the early 1670s the family rebuilt Woodside House, near Amersham, Buckinghamshire, and settled there. John seems to have been a favourite of his father, at least after the death at sea of his brother Isaac, for he was often in his company during these years.<br>
<br>In 1679 Penington's father, who was much beloved by the Quaker community, died. Upon his death John inherited Woodside House as well as Goodnestone Court, his mother's estate in Kent. Isaac's Quaker mantle apparently fell to John, too, who seems to have taken a leadership role in the London community from this time on. He joined with other Quaker leaders (as well as his mother) in writing a tribute to Isaac. John's subsequent writings were largely directed to vindicating his father and other Quaker authors. In 1681 he published <span class="italic">John Penington's complaint against William Rogers: relating to the abuse and injury done to the memory of his worthy father Isaac</span>, in which he accused Rogers of deliberately misrepresenting Isaac, who claimed that the latter had said that no &#145;outward Form of Government&#146; was necessary in this life.<br>
<br>In the 1690s serious attacks were levelled at Quaker writings by the &#145;apostate&#146; Quaker George Keith. Keith had been a prominent leader of the sect until he had a falling out with the Quakers of Pennsylvania in the early 1690s. In 1693 he returned to London and started writing against his erstwhile colleagues. Keith applied withering criticism to the writings of William Penn, George Whitehead, and Isaac Penington. John responded by pointing out Keith's own inconsistencies&#151;in his past comments as well as his recent writings&#151;and claimed to be able to quote &#145;Keith against Keith&#146;  (<span class="italic">Keith Against Keith, or, Some More of George Keith's Contradictions and Absurdities</span>, 1696). All told, Penington wrote five books or tracts against Keith, and debated with him publicly at Turner's Hall in June 1696. His most detailed and systematic attacks are <span class="italic">Keith Against Keith</span>, mentioned above, and <span class="italic">The fig-leaf covering discovered, or, George Keith's explications and retractions &hellip; proved insincere</span> (1697). Penington died at Goodnestone Court, Kent, on 8 May 1710 and was buried at the Quaker burial-ground at Jordans, Chalfont St Giles. He never married.<br>
