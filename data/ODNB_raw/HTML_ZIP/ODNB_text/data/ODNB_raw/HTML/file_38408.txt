<span class="headword">Maschwitz,  (Albert) Eric</span>  (1901&#150;1969), <span class="occ">writer and broadcaster</span>, was born on 10 June 1901 at 13 Carpenter Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, the son of Albert Arthur Maschwitz, a general merchant, and his wife, Leontine Hilda Bockemann. He was educated at Arden House preparatory school, Henley in Arden, and Repton School, and went on to read modern languages at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. Maschwitz worked in an editorial capacity with <span class="italic">Hutchinson's Magazine</span> (1922&#150;3), and then undertook a number of assignments as a freelance writer and editor, including a stint in 1925 with a film studio in France. In 1926 he became a publisher's reader with A. M. Heath, the firm of literary agents.<br>
<br>Maschwitz joined the BBC in 1926 in the outside broadcast department but his first important job was in the editorial office of the <span class="italic">Radio Times</span>. In 1927 he became editor of the magazine. Maschwitz graduated from that in 1933 to the variety department of which he became a driving force and innovator. He detached the department (which in later years would be renamed light entertainment) from the stuffy atmosphere of Broadcasting House to the nearby St George's Hall where the atmosphere was more free and easy, and the best of the pre-Second World War entertainment shows were born.<br>
<br>In addition to helping to create the successful magazine programme <span class="italic">In Town Tonight</span> Maschwitz was a songwriter, penning the lyrics of &#145;These foolish things&#146; and &#145;A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square&#146;. He wrote, together with George Posford, the operetta <span class="italic">Goodnight Vienna</span>, which opened a new chapter of entertainment in the expanding world of radio (still called, in the 1930s, the wireless). Many other operettas followed in association with various authors and proved hugely successful with the growing radio audience, as well as on stage. These included <span class="italic">Balalaika</span> and <span class="italic">Magyar Melody</span>. <span class="italic">Balalaika</span>, which ran for 570 performances at the Adelphi from 1936, was a great hit. Less successful was <span class="italic">Waltz without End</span> in 1942, in which he tried to present Chopin in a popular format.<br>
<br>Eric Maschwitz promoted the dance bands of the day and was responsible for ending the monopoly of the so-called BBC Dance Band. He encouraged the BBC to employ the many dance orchestras of the time whose music was popular, and especially those of Ambrose, Billy Cotton, Geraldo, and Joe Loss. From 1933 until 1937, when he briefly joined MGM in Hollywood, his flair and energy helped to promote radio as entertainment. In so doing he helped to dilute the more sombre educational/political view of what should be broadcast beloved of the corporation's director-general, Sir John Reith.<br>
<br>While running variety Maschwitz was constantly looking for new ideas and new talent; &#145;Only occasionally&#146;, he claimed, &#145;did talent &#147;drop as manna out of heaven&#148;&#146;  (Briggs, 2.103). But drop it did and Maschwitz was largely responsible for the broadcasting careers of Arthur Marshall, Beryl Orde, Vic Oliver, Claud Dampier, Sandy Powell, and many others. However, the demands on talent were enormous. When the BBC proved reluctant to install its own talent-spotting department Maschwitz employed the young Canadian Carroll Levis to provide a &#145;discovery&#146; show which would put new and untried talent before the microphone. Levis was an immediate success.<br>
<br>On 25 January 1926 Maschwitz married the intimate revue and cabaret star <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39931/', "Hermione Ferdinanda Gingold (1897&#150;1987)")</script>, daughter of James Gingold, a stockbroker. Appearing on the wireless as herself, or under the pseudonym Mrs Pullpleasure, an itinerant harpist, Gingold was in constant demand. They divorced in April 1945 and on 14 November 1945 Maschwitz married Phyllis Crawford Gordon, daughter of Thomas Crawford Gordon and divorced wife of John Taylor Galey, who died in September 1969. There were no children.<br>
<br>When war came in 1939 Maschwitz joined the army, and from 1940 to 1945 he served in the intelligence corps. In due course he became head of a War Office broadcasting section in the department of welfare and education, where he became involved in army entertainment at home and abroad. He pressed for the creation of a forces programme run in healthy competition with the Home Service. At the end of the war Maschwitz acted as the story editor of the official D-day film, <span class="italic">True Glory</span> (1945). He left the army in 1945 with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. After the war Maschwitz became intimately associated with the Music Publishers' Association, constantly arguing for a greater proportion of British music in the BBC output and a correspondingly smaller American input which he dismissed as merely &#145;the latest fads&#146;.<br>
<br>Maschwitz in 1948 had another great success with <span class="italic">Carissima</span>, its delightful lyrics set to the music of Hans May. Other effective productions were <span class="italic">Belinda Fair</span> (1949), <span class="italic">Zip Goes a Million</span> (1951), <span class="italic">Love from Judy</span> (1952), and <span class="italic">Happy Holiday</span> (1954).<br>
<br>In 1956 Eric Maschwitz rejoined the BBC as head of light entertainment television and was a stimulating force in fighting back against the energetic programme-makers of ITV, newly established in 1955. Between 1961 and 1963 he was assistant and adviser to the controller of television programmes. Under his benign leadership BBC television came up with <span class="italic">The Rag Trade</span>, <span class="italic">Black and White Minstrel Show</span>, and sitcoms for Harry Worth, Charlie Drake, and Eric Sykes. He retired from the BBC in 1963 but re-emerged as a freelance producer of the television series <span class="italic">Our Man at St Marks</span> for Associated Rediffusion. In broadcasting terms his importance to BBC light entertainment cannot be understated. He wrote a novel, <span class="italic">A Taste of Honey</span>, in 1924, and an autobiography, <span class="italic">No Chip on my Shoulder</span>, in 1957. He was appointed OBE in 1936. Eric Maschwitz died on 27 October 1969 at Ascot Nursing Home, Sunninghill, Berkshire.<br>
