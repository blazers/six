<span class="headword">Markyate,  Christina  of</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1096, <em>d.</em> after 1145), <span class="occ">hermit and prioress of Markyate</span>, was born <i>c</i>.1096, the daughter of an Anglo-Saxon nobleman, Auti, whose family had large possessions in Huntingdon, and his wife, Beatrix. Her baptismal name was Theodora, but she later took the name Christina, presumably to underline her position as one vowed to Christ. At an early age she was taken to the abbey of St Albans, where she made a secret vow of virginity and scratched a cross on its walls as a sign. Some years later her aunt, Alveva, who had been the mistress of Ranulf Flambard before he became bishop of Durham, entertained him on his way to London, and after the feast Christina was left with him in his room, where he attempted to seduce her. On the plea that she feared others might intrude, she asked permission to lock the door and promptly did so from the outside. The bishop, enraged at being deluded by a mere girl, determined to have his revenge. About 1115 he persuaded her parents to give her in marriage to a friend of his named Burhred, and by constant threats and ill treatment she was forced to consent. On refusing to consummate the marriage she was brought before the prior of Huntingdon. She defended her case so well that the prior gave judgment in her favour. The parents then appealed to Robert Bloet, bishop of Lincoln, who also declared in her favour. Subsequently he was persuaded by liberal bribes to reverse his judgment. From that time she was kept in close confinement and treated with cruelty. Eventually, she secretly engaged a local hermit to describe her plight to Ralph d'Escures, archbishop of Canterbury, and on hearing that he supported her case, she decided to escape.<br>
<br>Christina arranged with the servant of the hermit to bring horses early one morning while her parents were away, and, dressed in man's garb, she escaped on horseback, riding 30 miles to Flamstead, where she took refuge with Alfwen, a recluse. She stayed hidden at Flamstead for two years, eventually moving to Markyate, another hermitage ruled over by Roger, a former monk of St Albans. She remained there for four years, confined to a cell that would allow her neither to sit nor lie down: it was closed by a large stone that could be moved only by Roger. After four years Roger died and, owing to the enmity of the bishop of Lincoln, she appealed for protection to Thurstan, archbishop of York. Probably about 1120, with Thurstan's help, she obtained the annulment of her marriage.<br>
<br>In 1123 Christina returned to Markyate, where a community which would eventually be formally constituted as a nunnery gathered round her. It may well have been for this community that the celebrated St Albans psalter (now in Hildesheim) was prepared or adapted, with its drawings of episodes in the life of St Alexis (who also made a chaste marriage) and of the appearance of the risen Christ to two disciples as they walked to Emmaus, mirroring events in Christina's own life. By 1130 her reputation had spread far and wide and she was sought after as superior for many communities. Archbishop Thurstan wanted her to rule his foundation of St Clement in York, and suggested her as abbess of Marcigny and Fontevrault in France. By this time she had become friendly with Geoffrey de Gorham, abbot of St Albans, who persuaded her to make her monastic profession before Alexander, bishop of Lincoln. Her life now became peaceful and she gave counsel and encouragement to Abbot Geoffrey when he became involved in the ecclesiastical politics of the early years of Stephen's reign. At this point, apparently around the year 1140, the manuscript containing Christina's biography is cut off, though other sources reveal that a priory was built for her at Markyate in 1145. Gifts of her embroidery were sent to Pope Adrian IV in 1155, but it cannot be safely deduced from this that she was herself still alive at that date and the date of her death is unknown. A contemporary account of her life (which may even have been written before her death) survives in the second volume of BL, Cotton MS Tiberius E.i, which was badly damaged in the fire which devastated the Cottonian Library in 1731, though the fire was not responsible for the loss of the manuscript's concluding folios. Until the mid-twentieth century the story of Christina's life was known only through an abridgement of it made by the recusant writer Nicholas Roscarrock at a date about 1600. However, a careful and prolonged investigation by C. H. Talbot, helped by the resources of modern science, led to the publication in 1959 of as much of the surviving text as remains legible, which is considerably more than might have been expected. As a result, the story of Christina of Markyate has come to be appreciated as one of the fullest and most vivid accounts of a woman's life to survive from the twelfth century.<br>
