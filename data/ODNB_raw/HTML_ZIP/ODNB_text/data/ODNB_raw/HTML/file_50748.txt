<span class="headword">Drakoules <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lambe; <em>other married name </em>Lewis]</span>,  Alice Marie</span>  (<em>c.</em>1850&#150;1933), <span class="occ">humanitarian and campaigner for animal welfare</span>, was born near Brussels, the daughter of Henry Lambe. In 1876 she married William Burrows Lewis (<i>b</i>. 1820/21), the managing director of the Union Assurance Company. They adopted a daughter. After Lewis's death, on 9 October 1907 she married Platon Eustathios Drakoules (<i>b</i>. 1857/8), a journalist, sociologist, and former member of the Greek parliament. Like her, he lived his life according to humanitarian principles, and was a founder of the Greek Anti-Carnivore Society.<br>
<br>Alice Drakoules was a lifelong humanitarian, vegetarian, and campaigner for animals. As Mrs Lewis in 1887 in Weybridge in Surrey she founded the Band of Mercy, the children's group within the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA). In 1891 her London home by Regent's Park became a meeting place for representatives of intellectual and spiritual movements. She played a key role in establishing the Humanitarian League, founded by Henry Salt, to &#145;prevent the perpetration of cruelty and wrong&#151;to redress the suffering, as far as is possible, of all sentient life&#146;  (Henry Salt, <span class="italic">Humanitarianism</span>, 1893, 15). She hosted its inaugural meeting in her fashionable London home and was treasurer of the league at its inception and at its demise in 1919. Although she was known primarily neither for her writing nor for her public eloquence she co-ordinated the work of the league, and was a member of its executive committee for most of its history. When former members of the Humanitarian League regrouped in the 1920s to organize the League for the Prohibition of Cruel Sports (which still exists as the League against Cruel Sports) she was one of its earliest supporters.<br>
<br>Alice Drakoules was also a founder member of the executive council of the Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society, initiated by Louise Lind af Hageby in 1906 to campaign against all forms of cruelty to animals, and remained a member until her death nearly thirty years later. According to her colleague Nina, duchess of Hamilton, in her twenty-seven years of service she scarcely missed a meeting. She was particularly active in the society's campaigns for humane slaughter and the establishment of municipal slaughterhouses, and for legislation to prohibit the use of performing animals.<br>
<br>Alice Drakoules was known for her unswerving commitment to principled, but often unpopular, causes. Her circle of friends and acquaintances included the leading animal rights' activists of her day and the spiritualists Edward Maitland and Anna Kingsford. She subsequently joined the circle of Nina, duchess of Hamilton, and Louise Lind af Hageby with whom she campaigned for many years.<br>
<br>Through her behind the scenes work and steady influence Alice Drakoules was seen as a &#145;spiritual mother&#146; of the humanitarian movement. She died on 15 January 1933 at her London home, 14 Park Square East, Regent's Park. Four years after her death her friends erected an appropriate memorial to her in St John's Wood churchyard, near where she had lived most of her life. As the inscription on it tells, she was &#145;for forty years a devoted and generous worker in London for animal welfare&#146;  (memorial inscription, St John's Wood churchyard gardens). The bird-bath memorial depicts a range of animals&#151;fox, stag, squirrel, horse, bird, cat, dog, and heron&#151;which appropriately epitomizes her concern for the broad spectrum of animals and her opposition to all forms of hunting and experimentation on animals. Alice Drakoules is less well known than many of her Humanitarian League colleagues, but the work and influence of the organization owed much to her commitment and unflinching support.<br>
