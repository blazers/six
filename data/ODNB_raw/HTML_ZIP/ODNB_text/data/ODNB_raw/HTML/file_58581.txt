<span class="headword">Slater <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Leschziner]</span>,  Oscar Joseph</span>  (1872&#150;1948), <span class="occ">victim of miscarriage of justice</span>, was born in Oppeln, Upper Silesia, Germany, on 8 January 1872, the son of Adolph Leschziner (<i>d</i>. 1916), a baker, and his wife, Paula Zweig (<i>d</i>. 1917). The family, which was Jewish, consisted of at least four (and probably six) children. Oscar Leschziner attended the <i>Gymnasium</i> in Beuthen, the town where his father had his bakery. At fifteen he was apprenticed to Schuttenberg, a timber merchant in Beuthen. He parted from Schuttenberg on good terms and left Beuthen to work in Hamburg. His attraction to gambling and prostitutes, and to the buying and selling of jewellery, may have started in Hamburg. In 1893 or 1894 he travelled to London, to evade military service, and later worked as a bookmaker. Once in England, and later in Scotland, Leschziner used various names, such as George, Anderson, Sando, Schmidt, and Slater; and it was the latter he now used for official purposes. In 1896 he was prosecuted at north London sessions for malicious wounding. He was acquitted. In 1897 he was prosecuted for assault. He was discharged by the magistrate at Clerkenwell police court.<br>
<br>By 1899 Slater had moved to Edinburgh. He variously claimed to be a gymnastics instructor, a dentist, and (more realistically) a dealer in precious stones. He was known to the Edinburgh police as a notorious gambler and a &#145;low class foreign bully&#146;, although, in fact, he was always dapper in his attire. In November 1899 he was fined by Edinburgh police court for disorderly conduct. By 1901 he was living in Glasgow, but was constantly changing his address. He walked around with a large dog (which he claimed to be a performing circus dog) and he was known to the police as the associate of prostitutes, thieves, burglars, and &#145;resetters&#146; (the receivers of stolen goods). On 12 July 1901 Slater married in Glasgow Mary Curtis Pryor (<i>b</i>. 1878/9) of Norfolk, the daughter of James Pryor, a farmer. After resettling in London and occasionally visiting the USA (where he had an interest in gaming clubs), Slater returned to Glasgow in 1908.<br>
<br>On 21 December 1908 Marion Gilchrist, a rich but reclusive spinster aged eighty-three, was beaten to death at 15 Queen's Terrace, West Princes Street, Glasgow. Her flat had previously been watched by loiterers, including one man who used the pretext of asking for &#145;Anderson&#146;. This was the name being used by Slater for the purpose of renting premises (a suspected brothel) near by. The motive for the crime, resembling, as it seemed to do, the murder in Dostoyevsky's <span class="italic">Crime and Punishment</span>, was assumed to be robbery. Slater was suspected because he had been trying to sell a pawn ticket to a brooch. A brooch was the only item that appeared to have been stolen from the victim's flat. He had also left Liverpool for New York on 26 December 1908. The police subsequently admitted that the pawn ticket had been a false lead. They nevertheless persisted in identifying Slater as the prime suspect, interpreting Slater's journey as a &#145;flight from justice&#146;. The police travelled to New York to apply for Slater's extradition. Slater's lawyer advised him that this application would probably fail. In the event, Slater decided to return to Scotland voluntarily.<br>
<br>Slater was tried for murder at the High Court in Edinburgh on 3&#150;6 May 1909. He did not give evidence in his own defence. The prosecution made much of the &#145;flight from justice&#146;. They also relied on identification evidence, all of it of a fleeting glimpse nature. Much of it was unreliable, prejudiced, tainted, or coached. Slater's identification parade had consisted of placing Slater (a man of obviously foreign appearance) in a line of nine off-duty policemen and two Scottish railway workers. Many criticisms of the trial were subsequently made by William Roughead in his introduction to <span class="italic">The Trial of Oscar Slater</span> in the <span class="roman">Notable British Trials</span> series (1910): the prison authorities removed these pages from the book before they allowed Slater to borrow it from the prison library. But the transcript alone showed that the trial had transgressed the rule that a defendant should not be brought to a criminal court to answer for his entire past life. The jury's verdict was a majority of nine votes to six (five being in favour of the Scottish verdict of &#145;not proven&#146; and one in favour of &#145;not guilty&#146;).<br>
<br>There was no court of criminal appeal in Scotland in 1909. The secretary for Scotland, Lord Pentland, disregarded the advice of his under-secretary, J. M. Dodds, who advised that the death penalty should be carried out. By means of a conditional pardon Slater's sentence was commuted to one of penal servitude for life. Lord Pentland's recorded reasons included the advice of the trial judge (Lord Guthrie), the prejudice caused by publicity in the press, and the jury's knowledge of Slater's &#145;very abandoned&#146; character. During his imprisonment Slater was recorded to have committed some sixty offences against prison discipline, including idleness, insolence, and destroying library books. Yet during this time Roughead's book continued to impress all who read it. Among those who agitated for Slater's release were his solicitor (Ewing Speirs), Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Sir Edward Marshall Hall, James Ramsay MacDonald, and (in 1927) Viscount Buckmaster.<br>
<br>In 1914 the secretary of state for Scotland, Thomas MacKinnon Wood, encouraged one of the detectives in the case, John Thompson Trench, to transmit information which had allegedly been concealed by the Glasgow police and which implicated one of Miss Gilchrist's relatives as a suspect. Wood then set up an inquiry but failed to protect Trench from the consequences of his actions. He was dismissed from the police and prosecuted on a trumped-up charge, but was acquitted. If Slater's trial exemplified all the criticisms which can be made of the adversarial system, the inquiry which was set up by Wood exemplified all the disadvantages of the inquisitorial system. The inquiry led to the publication of expurgated witness statements in June 1914, but Wood decided that there was no reason to interfere with Slater's sentence. This only inspired Roughead to bring out a second edition of his book (1915), including his criticisms of &#145;the secret inquiry&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1927 William Park published his book <span class="italic">The Truth about Oscar Slater</span>. This proved decisive. The solicitor-general for Scotland, A. M. MacRobert, reported to the secretary of state for Scotland, Sir John Gilmour, that it was no longer proven that Slater had committed the murder. In November 1927 the government secured the passing of a bill to enable the recently established Scottish court of criminal appeal to hear appeals relating to convictions before the original shut-off date of 1 November 1926. Slater was then released from Peterhead prison, on licence, and into the care of Rabbi E. P. Phillips of Glasgow. In July 1928 the Scottish court of criminal appeal quashed Slater's conviction, on the ground that the trial judge had failed to direct the jury, in sufficiently unambiguous terms, about the irrelevance of Slater's supposed character as a pimp. Slater accepted &pound;6000 compensation from the government in August 1928. He lived the remainder of his life in Scotland quietly and respectably, no longer characterized as a &#145;low-class foreign bully&#146;, but resembling a retired army officer.<br>
<br>Slater was 5 feet 7&frac12; inches tall, strongly built, with an apparently distorted nose, memorable to all who saw it. He was briefly interned at the beginning of the Second World War. He had separated from his first wife long before his arrest, and in 1936 he married Lina Wilhelmina Schad (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1902), who was also interned as an enemy alien. There were no children of either marriage. Slater died at 25 St Phillan's Avenue, Ayr, on 31 January 1948, after three years' invalidity from phlebitis, and was cremated. On his death certificate he was described as a retired baker. His second wife survived him.<br>
<br>Slater's wrongful conviction rankled with the Scottish legal system for nearly twenty years and eventually led to a reform of the appellate courts. Slater liked to call himself &#145;the Scottish Dreyfus&#146;. It is more accurate to evaluate Detective-Lieutenant Trench as the Scottish Colonel Picquart. But Trench, who died in 1919, aged fifty, never lived to see the success of his efforts.<br>
