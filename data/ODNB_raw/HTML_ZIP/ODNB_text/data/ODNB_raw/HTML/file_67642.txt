<span class="headword">Harrison,  Julius Allan Greenway</span>  (1885&#150;1963), <span class="occ">conductor and composer</span>, was born on 26 March 1885 in Bewdley Road, Lower Mitton, Worcestershire, the eldest in the family of four sons and three daughters of Walter Henry Harrison (<i>b</i>. 1852), grocer and candle maker, and his wife, Henriette Julien Schoeller (1860&#150;1936), who came from Heidelberg, Germany. His parents had met while his mother was working in England as a governess. He grew up in a musical household: his father conducted the Stourport Glee Union, and he was taught the piano by his mother before taking organ and violin lessons from the organist of Wilden church. He also sang in the church choir, where the future prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, was a fellow chorister.<br>
<br>Educated at Queen Elizabeth's School, Hartlebury, from 1903 to 1907 Harrison trained at the Midland Institute School of Music in Birmingham, where Granville Bantock was principal. From 1905 to 1908 he was organist at Hartlebury parish church, and after winning first prize in the composition class at the 1908 Norwich musical festival for his cantata <span class="italic">Cleopatra</span>, he moved to London to work as a freelance musician. While working for the Orchestrelle Company, correcting and editing piano rolls for player-pianos, he gained conducting experience with amateur musicians, including the Dulwich Philharmonic Society and the Hampstead Op&eacute;ra Comique. He was also organist of the Union Chapel, Highbury, where he had the opportunity to write music for the choir, including <span class="italic">Harvest Cantata</span> (1910) and <span class="italic">Christmas Cantata</span> (1911). He found time for composing other works, including the tone poem <span class="italic">Night on the Mountains</span> (1910), which Hans Richter invited him to conduct at a London Symphony Orchestra concert. On 16 December 1913 he married (Florence) Mary (<i>b</i>. 1886/7), a singer, of Eastbourne, Sussex, daughter of Joseph Cooper Eddison; they had two daughters.<br>
<br>Harrison's career as an opera conductor began in the autumn of 1913, when he was engaged to conduct for the season at Covent Garden, London; he had worked as pianist and coach for the German opera there in the spring, when he was able to observe Arthur Nikisch rehearse Wagner's <span class="italic">Ring</span> cycle. At the end of the season he visited Bayreuth to hear Hans Richter conduct, and in 1914 he went to Paris as a member of the Covent Garden syndicate, which was promoting a German opera season there, to rehearse Wagner's <span class="italic">Parsifal</span> and <span class="italic">Tristan und Isolde</span> for Nikisch, and <span class="italic">Die Meistersinger</span> for Felix Weingartner. He was one of the conductors for the Beecham Opera Company, formed by Thomas Beecham, during its existence from 1915 to 1919, and although he was called up in 1916 and was commissioned into the Royal Flying Corps his postings, first to Northolt to supervise the testing of aeroplane engines and then to the Royal Flying Corps's depot in Regent's Park, allowed him to continue to work for the opera company. In 1920 he was appointed conductor of the Bradford Permanent Orchestra, a post he held until 1927, and from 1920 to 1923 he was also co-conductor, with Landon Ronald, of the Scottish Orchestra, which had a three-month summer season in Glasgow. When Beecham founded the British National Opera Company in 1922, he invited Harrison to be a principal conductor; Harrison worked for several seasons at Covent Garden, specializing in Wagner operas and conducting twenty-two performances of <span class="italic">Tristan und Isolde</span>. He left the company in 1924, when appointed director of opera and professor of composition at the Royal Academy of Music, and for five years prepared the opera class for the academy's annual opera week at the Scala Theatre. He was divorced from his first wife in 1929, and on 28 October that year married Dorothy Helen (<i>b</i>. 1904/5), a musician, of Baldock, Hertfordshire, daughter of Francis William Henry Langston Day; she had been a member of his harmony class at the academy. They had one son.<br>
<br>In 1930 Harrison was appointed conductor of the Hastings Municipal Orchestra, a post that involved organizing an annual festival and conducting as many as twelve concerts a week during the summer season. After the orchestra was disbanded in 1940, he was director of music at Malvern College until 1942, when he became a conductor of the BBC Northern Orchestra in Manchester. As his deafness grew more severe, however, he accepted fewer conducting engagements, and after conducting the final concert of the Malvern Elgar Festival, of which he was artistic director in 1947, he was forced to give up conducting altogether.<br>
<br>Harrison had always resented having to earn his living by conducting, and he was now able to devote most of his time to composition, while doing some teaching at Trinity College of Music and the Birmingham School of Music. Although he had been composing all his life, he had destroyed most of his early unpublished works, and his orchestral <span class="italic">Worcestershire Suite</span> (1917), first performed in 1920, was his first work to attract widespread attention. This was followed by <span class="italic">Requiem of Archangels for the World</span> (1920) for chorus and organ, but it was not until 1938, with <span class="italic">Autumn Landscape</span> for string orchestra, written after the death of his elder daughter in 1935, that Harrison began to emerge as a mature composer with his own voice. Traditional in style, and strongly influenced by the works of Brahms, he was never interested in modernism, and hated the avant-garde. Harrison began working on his mass in C in 1936, as a memorial to his daughter, but this was not finished until 1947. It was performed regularly in his lifetime&#151;he heard twenty-eight performances&#151;and the BBC broadcast it in 1955 in celebration of his seventieth birthday. Other important works include <span class="italic">Bredon Hill</span> (1942), a rhapsody for violin and orchestra often compared to Vaughan Williams's <span class="italic">The Lark Ascending</span>, with the score headed by lines from A. E. Housman's poem &#145;Here of a Sunday Morning&#146;; the viola sonata (1946); and <span class="italic">Missa liturgica</span> (1950). From 1947 to 1957 he was writing his <span class="roman">Requiem</span>, dedicated to Sir Edward Elgar and first performed at the Worcester festival in 1957, the year of the Elgar centenary.<br>
<br>Although he never wrote a symphony himself, Harrison was an expert on the form, and published the monograph <span class="italic">Brahms and his Four Symphonies</span> (1939). He contributed the chapter on Dvo&#345;&aacute;k's orchestral music to <span class="italic">Anton&iacute;n Dvo&#345;&aacute;k: his Achievement</span> (1943), edited by Viktor Fischl, and wrote four chapters for Robert Simpson's symposium <span class="italic">The Symphony</span> (1967), which was dedicated to his memory. He also began an autobiography, &#145;The Red Earth of Worcestershire&#146;, which was completed by his wife but never published.<br>
<br>A quiet, gentle, and sensitive man, Harrison suffered ill health for much of his life. The stress of overwork led to the development of a duodenal ulcer in early middle age at the same time as the onset of deafness, which was possibly caused by his work during the First World War. He died on 5 April 1963 at his home, The Greenwood, 28 Ox Lane, Harpenden, Hertfordshire.<br>
