<span class="headword">Cooper,  Edward Joshua</span>  (1798&#150;1863), <span class="occ">landowner and astronomer</span>, was born in May 1798 at St Stephen's Green, Dublin, the eldest of the three sons of Edward Synge Cooper (<i>d</i>. 1830), a landowner, and his wife, Anne, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28221/', "Harry Verelst")</script>, governor of Bengal. He attended school in Armagh, where he became acquainted with the astronomical observatory, and Eton College, and then spent two years from 1816 at Christ Church, Oxford, without taking a degree. His education was completed by ten years of travel.<br>
<br>By his constant practice of determining with portable instruments the latitudes and longitudes of the places he visited, Cooper accumulated a mass of unpublished geographical data. In the summer of 1820 he met Sir William Drummond at Naples, and, by the latter's interest in ancient zodiacs, was induced to visit Egypt to obtain accurate copies of them. He accordingly ascended the Nile as far as the second cataract in the winter of 1820&#150;21, and brought home with him the materials of a volume entitled <span class="italic">Views in Egypt and Nubia</span>, printed for private circulation at London in 1824. A set of lithographs from drawings by Bossi, a Roman artist engaged by Cooper for the journey, formed its chief interest.<br>
<br>Cooper's eastward excursions reached as far as Turkey and Persia, and in 1824&#150;5 he traversed Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, as far as the North Cape. Following his travels he regarded Munich and Nice as the best adapted spots in Europe for astronomical observation. He subsequently undertook important astronomical work in the vicinity of both cities, and at Nice a large refractor was established in the 1890s.<br>
<br>On his father's death in 1830 Cooper succeeded to his position as manager of the family estates at Markree, Collooney, co. Sligo, Ireland, and decided to erect an observatory there. He visited Cauchoix in Paris in 1829 and by 1831 was able to purchase from him an object-glass 13<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> inches across and 25 feet in focal length, the largest then in existence. Used at first on a wooden stand, it was mounted equatorially by Thomas Grubb of Dublin in 1834. Cast iron was employed for the first time as the material of the tube and stand. A dome of the requisite size was considered then not to be feasible, and the instrument was set up in the open air. A 5 foot transit by Troughton, a meridian circle 3 feet in diameter, fitted with a 7 inch telescope, ordered in 1839 on the occasion of a visit to the works of Ertel in Bavaria, and a comet seeker (a short-focus, wide-angle refracting telescope), likewise by Ertel, acquired in 1842, were successively added to the equipment of what was authoritatively described in 1851 as &#145;undoubtedly the most richly furnished of private observatories&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</span>, 11, 1850&#150;51, 104).<br>
<br>Cooper worked diligently in the observatory himself when at Markree, and obtained in March 1842, in Andrew Graham, an assistant who gave a fresh impulse to its activity. In their joint work in 1842&#150;3 the positions of fifty stars within two degrees of the pole were determined; later the systematic meridian observations of minor planets were set on foot, and on 10&#150;12 August 1847 an experiment was successfully made of determining the difference of longitude between Markree and Killiney, 98 miles distant, by simultaneous observations of shooting stars. A ninth minor planet was discovered by Graham on 25 April 1848 and named Metis, its detection having ensued from the adoption of a plan of work laid down by Cooper. Meteorological registers were continuously kept at Markree for thirty years from 1833, and many of the results were communicated to the Meteorological Society. In 1844&#150;5 Cooper and Graham made together a tour through France, Germany, and Italy. The great refractor formed part of their luggage, and, mounted on a wooden stand with altitude and azimuth movements, was used to sketch the Orion nebula and to detect independently, at Naples on 7 February 1845, a comet already observed in the southern hemisphere.<br>
<br>From the time that the possibility of further planetary discoveries had been recalled to the attention of astronomers by the finding of Astraea on 8 December 1845, Cooper had it in view to extend the star maps then in progress at Berlin so as to include stars of the twelfth or thirteenth magnitude. A detailed acquaintance with ecliptical stars, however, was indispensable for the facilitation of planetary research&#151;Cooper's primary object&#151;and the Berlin maps covered only an equatorial zone of thirty degrees. He accordingly resolved on the construction of a set of ecliptic star charts to twelfth or thirteenth magnitude of four times the linear dimensions of the <i>Horae</i> prepared at Berlin. The intention was to show fainter stars so that fainter minor planets could be detected. Observations for the purpose were begun in August 1848, and continued until Graham's resignation in June 1860. The results were printed at government expense in four volumes with the title <span class="italic">Catalogue of Stars Near the Ecliptic Observed at Markree</span> (1851&#150;6). The approximate places were contained in them of 60,066 stars (epoch 1850) within three degrees of the ecliptic, only 8965 of which were already known. A list of seventy-seven stars missing from recent catalogues, or lost in the course of the observations, formed an appendix. The maps corresponding to this extensive catalogue, presented by his daughters after Cooper's death to the University of Cambridge, have remained unpublished. For this notable service to astronomy, in which he took a large personal share, Cooper received in 1858 the Cunningham gold medal of the Royal Irish Academy. He had been a member of that body from 1832, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 2 June 1853.<br>
<br>The elements and other data relative to 198 cometary bodies, gathered from scattered sources during several years, were arranged and published by Cooper in a volume entitled <span class="italic">Cometic Orbits, with Copious Notes and Addenda</span> (1852). Although partially anticipated by Galle's list of 178 sets of elements appended to the 1847 edition of Olbers's <span class="italic">Abhandlung</span>, the physical and historical information collected in the notes remain of permanent value. The preface contains statistics of the distribution in longitude of the perihelia and nodes of both planetary and cometary orbits, showing what seemed more than a chance aggregation in one semicircle. Communications on the same point were presented by Cooper to the Royal Astronomical Society in 1853, to the Royal Society in 1855, and to the British Association in 1858.<br>
<br>Cooper succeeded to the proprietorship of the Markree estates on the death in 1837 of his uncle Joshua Cooper. He was Conservative member of parliament for co. Sligo from 1830 to 1841, and again from 1857 to 1859. He was twice married, first to Sophia L'Estrange, of Moystown, King's county, who died having given birth to a son who also died, and second to Sarah Frances (<i>d</i>. 1863), the daughter of Owen Wynne of Haslewood, co. Sligo, with whom he had five daughters. Cooper died, shortly after his wife, at Markree Castle on 23 April 1863.<br>
<br>According to W. Doberck, Cooper was a kind as well as an improving landlord; his private life was blameless, and he united attractiveness of manner to varied accomplishments. He kept up to the last his interest in scientific pursuits, and numerous records of his work in astronomy were printed in the <span class="italic">Monthly Notices</span>, the <span class="italic">Astronomische Nachrichten</span>, and other journals. He imparted his observations of the annular eclipse of 15 May 1836 to the Acad&eacute;mie Royale des Sciences in Paris. For some years after his death the Markree observatory was completely neglected. It was restored in 1874, when W. Doberck was appointed director, and the refractor began to be employed, according to Cooper's original intention, for the study of double stars. However, little was done in this field, though meteorological observations were continued into the 1890s. In 1927 the 13 inch telescope, then nearly 100 years old, was sold for use in teaching science at a Jesuit seminary in Hong Kong. It was damaged during the Second World War, and the Cauchoix lens is now preserved in good condition at the Manila observatory. At Markree Castle only the observatory walls remain.<br>
