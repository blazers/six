<span class="headword">Wagstaffe,  Thomas</span>  (1645&#150;1712), <span class="occ">bishop of the nonjuring Church of England</span>, was the son of Thomas Wagstaffe of Binley, Warwickshire, and his wife, Anne Avery of Bishop's Itchington in the same county. He was born either at Binley on 13 February or at Stafford two days later. He studied at Charterhouse School, London, before matriculating at Pembroke College, Cambridge, on 14 May 1660. He then migrated to New Inn Hall, Oxford, on 14 March 1663, graduated BA in 1664, and proceeded MA in 1667. He was ordained deacon by John Hacket, bishop of Lichfield, on 6 June 1669 and priest five months later, on 19 November, by Joseph Henshaw of Peterborough. Henshaw subsequently appointed him rector of Martinsthorpe, Rutland. Made chancellor and canon of Lichfield on 6 December 1684, the following year he was presented by Henry Compton, bishop of London, to the rectory of the united parishes of St Margaret Pattens and St Gabriel Fenchurch.<br>
<br>During this period of advancement Wagstaffe published several sermons which were explicit statements of his tory Anglican loyalism. Those preached at Stowe, Buckinghamshire, in 1683 and at St Margaret Pattens in 1685 were the thanksgiving day sermons for the failure of the Rye House plot and the Monmouth rising. His defence of the Church of England at the Guildhall in November 1684 branded its critics as &#145;Rebels, Schismatics, Seditious, Turbulent, and unquiet&#146;  (T. Wagstaffe, <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached before the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor &hellip; at the Guild-Hall Chappel on November the 23d. 1684</span>, 1685, 29). The sermon that he delivered at St Mary-le-Bow on 24 November 1687 was more eirenic in tone. Its text, &#145;Be ye all of one mind, having compassion&#146;, exhorting his hearers to the spiritual virtues of Christian unity and charity, was no doubt apposite to its audience&#151;the annual feast for Warwickshire men living in London. But it was also the cry of a committed Anglican now urging a common protestant front against the threat posed by James II's Catholicizing policies. Protestant disunity was both shameful in itself and provided ammunition to the common Romish enemy: &#145;We must cease our Dissentions, and be as Good and Peaceable as our Principles. This will effectually answer all the clamors of our Adversaries, and do our Religion more right than all the Arguments of its Friends&#146;  (T. Wagstaffe, <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached at a Meeting of the Natives and Inhabitants of the County of Warwick &hellip; Novemb. 24. 1687</span>, 1688, 25). Their philanthropy, he added, amply disproved the charge that protestants had come to neglect the Christian obligation of charity when they abandoned belief in salvation by good works.<br>
<br>Wagstaffe married Martha Broughton of St Margaret's, Westminster, by licence dated 4 February 1686. They had several children, including a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28401/', "Thomas Wagstaffe (1692&#150;1770)")</script>, who like his father became a leading member of the nonjuring community and served as an Anglican chaplain to the exiled Stuart court at Rome. A daughter married his kinsman, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28402/', "William Wagstaffe")</script>, who became a well-known physician at St Bartholomew's Hospital and a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians.<br>
<br>Wagstaffe continued in his ecclesiastical positions until he was deprived in 1690 for refusing the oaths to William and Mary. Having studied medicine before taking orders, Wagstaffe now supported his family by taking up the practice of medicine in London, allegedly visiting his patients in full canonical attire. He also became a leading participant in the nascent nonjuring community in London, serving as an adviser and possibly as a physician to the deprived archbishop of Canterbury, William Sancroft. Having attended to the deprived archbishop before his death, Wagstaffe published an intimate account of Sancroft's last years and his death entitled <span class="italic">A letter out of Suffolk to a friend in London giving some account of the late sickness and death of Dr. William Sancroft, late lord archbishop of Canterbury</span> (1694). There he gave an account of the archbishop's deportment and faith during his forced retirement, noting that contrary to rumour that Sancroft received pastoral care and the sacraments from conforming clergy, Sancroft received these only from nonjurors such as himself.<br>
<br>Sancroft never accepted his deprivation, believing that the government had acted illegally and that his successor at Canterbury was an illegitimate usurper, thereby setting the stage for the continuation of the nonjuring separation. He granted to William Lloyd, the deprived bishop of Norwich, his metropolitan authority, which included the right to consecrate bishops for the nonjuring line. Therefore, with his primate's sanction, Lloyd and fellow nonjuring bishops Francis Turner of Ely and Thomas White of Peterborough looked to the interregnum for precedent in continuing the succession. Noting that the ageing Laudian bishops had conferred with the exiled Charles II and had gained his permission to continue the historic succession just before the Restoration intervened and made the action unnecessary, Lloyd sent George Hickes to obtain permission from James II to continue the nonjuring line. With approval from the exiled king, the bishops took advantage of Henry VIII's act, setting up two suffragan sees for the diocese of Norwich; they decided to fill these seemingly empty sees, which allowed them to continue the succession but avoid the problem of setting up rival sees. The purpose of continuing the nonjuring line was to offer the established church a pure church to return to when the cause of the schism had been resolved. While Hickes was nominated by Sancroft to fill the see of Thetford, Lloyd nominated Wagstaffe to the see of Ipswich, making them the only nonjuring bishops to fill titular sees. The two men were consecrated on 24 February 1694 by Lloyd, Turner, and White at the home of William Gifford at Southgate, Middlesex.<br>
<br>Although he agreed to his consecration, Wagstaffe did not exercise his episcopal prerogatives, and refrained from participating in any ordinations. He none the less remained active in nonjuring affairs, writing in defence of the movement and helping to raise funds to support impoverished nonjuror clergy. For this activity he was arrested and appeared before the privy council, together with bishops Ken, White, and Lloyd and the nonjuror clergyman Nathaniel Spinckes. Released by order of the council on 23 May 1696, Wagstaffe, whose connections and medical practice provided him with sufficient income to support his family, remained actively involved in the effort to provide financial support for his less fortunate colleagues.<br>
<br>Although he was not a prolific writer, Wagstaffe did write several short works and pamphlets in support of the Stuart dynasty and in defence of the nonjuring and Jacobite cause. A strong Stuart supporter and proponent of the principle of divine-right monarchy, he believed that former colleagues, such as William Sherlock, had acted inconsistently with the principles of the Church of England by taking the oath of allegiance to William and Mary, whom he considered usurpers of James II's proper title. His strong belief in divine-right monarchy is given voice in <span class="italic">An answer to a late pamphlet entitled &#145;Obedience and submission to the present government&#146; demonstrated from Bishop Overall's convocation book</span> (1690), in which he responded to an anonymous pamphlet that charged the nonjurors, such as Sherlock, with &#145;ignorance and malice&#146; for &#145;reproaching those of the Church of <i>England</i>, who have taken the Oaths with deserting their principles&#146;. He responded that it was indeed a malicious thing to be deprived of one's livings for keeping to principle  (Wagstaffe, <span class="italic">Answer</span>, 1). Wagstaffe sought to show that the principal doctrines found in Bishop John Overall's convocation book included passive obedience and non-resistance. Thus, the principles of the Church of England insisted that once a government was settled it should be obeyed, therefore, subjects should &#145;obey their lawful governors, and upon no account whatsoever to resist them&#146;  (ibid., 21).<br>
<br>Wagstaffe's most notable work was his defence of Charles I's authorship of the <span class="italic">Eikon basilike</span>, entitled <span class="italic">A vindication of King Charles the Martyr; proving that his majesty was the author of <i>Eik&#333;n basilik&#275;</i></span> (1691, 1697, 1711), and his later <span class="italic">Defense of the vindication of King Charles the Martyr; justifying his majesty's title to <i>Eik&#333;n basilik&#275;</i></span> (1699). In the controversy that re-emerged shortly after the revolution of 1688 over the book's true author, his was one of those tory and Jacobite voices that maintained it had been written by the martyr-king against the whig attribution of John Gauden.<br>
<br>True to his reluctance to exercise his episcopal authority, Wagstaffe refused to perform any episcopal consecrations when George Hickes sought his assistance, first in December 1711 and then in February 1712, in continuing the endangered nonjuring succession after William Lloyd's and Thomas Ken's return to the established church removed the last of the English bishops consecrated before the schism. Wagstaffe rebuffed his colleague, claiming that age and illness, along with distance from London, prevented him from complying. He also told Hickes that he believed this venture<blockquote>to be impracticable, that it has no foundation to stand on, but that the least opposition that will or hereafter be made to it cannot fail, but it must sink under it and come to nothing, and that consequently we shall destroy and irrecoverably defeat what is designed to be built up. (Yould, 402)</blockquote>With Wagstaffe's refusal to act, Hickes finally turned to the nonjuring Scottish bishops for assistance and continued the nonjuring succession by consecrating Jeremy Collier, Samuel Hawes, and Nathaniel Spinckes.<br>
<br>In his later years, though retaining a London house in Charterhouse Yard, Wagstaffe had returned to Binley, where he continued his writing. It was there that he died on 17 October 1712 and was buried three days later. He was survived by his wife, Martha, and six children. The announcement of his death in the <span class="italic">Postboy</span> spoke of him as:<blockquote>a man of extraordinary judgment, exemplary piety, and unusual learning; and had he not had the misfortune to dissent from the established government by not taking the oaths, as he had all the qualities of a great divine, and a governor of the Church, so he would have filled deservedly some of the highest stations in it. (Overton, 114)</blockquote>The great whig historian Lord Macaulay called Wagstaffe and Hickes &#145;two fierce and uncompromising nonjurors&#146;  (Macaulay, 4.2008). Though there was a bitter barb in his comment&#151;he had just mocked Wagstaffe's providentialist reading of the death of Mary II in December 1694, which drew close parallels in the timing of the turns in her descent to the grave with the timing of her betrayed father's loss of his throne in December 1688&#151;Macaulay also recognized Wagstaffe to be &#145;a writer whom the Jacobite schismatics justly regarded as one of their ablest chiefs&#146;  (ibid., 5.2472).<br>
