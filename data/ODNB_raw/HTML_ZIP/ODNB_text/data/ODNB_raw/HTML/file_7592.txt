<span class="headword">Dick <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Cunyngham]</span>, Sir  Alexander</span>, third baronet  (1703&#150;1785), <span class="occ">physician</span>, born on 22 October 1703, was the third son of Sir William Cunyngham of Caprington, first baronet (<i>d</i>. 1740), and Janet (<i>d</i>. 1753), only child and heir of Sir James Dick, first baronet (1643&#150;1728), of Prestonfield, near Edinburgh. The family name was changed to Dick because of the mother's inheritance. Not sharing in the large fortune inherited by his elder brother William, Alexander Cunyngham decided to qualify for a profession. He began the study of medicine at the University of Edinburgh, and afterwards went to Leiden University, where he became a pupil of Boerhaave, and graduated MD on 31 August 1725. His inaugural dissertation, &#145;De epilepsia&#146;, was published the same year. A similar degree was conferred on him two years later by the University of St Andrews. In 1727 he began practising as a physician in Edinburgh, and on 7 November of the same year he became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. Ten years later he travelled on the continent with his friend Allan Ramsay (1713&#150;1784), the painter, son of the well-known Scottish poet, Allan Ramsay (1686&#150;1758). During his travels Cunyngham added to his scientific and cultural acquirements, keeping an extensive journal of his travels, extracts of which appeared in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> for 1853. On his return home he settled in Pembrokeshire, where he earned a reputation as a successful practitioner. Meanwhile he maintained a constant correspondence with Allan Ramsay the elder and other friends in Scotland. Cunyngham married first in 1736 his cousin, Janet, daughter of Alexander Dick, merchant in Edinburgh: with her he had three daughters. He married second in 1762 Mary, daughter of David Butler of Pembrokeshire, with whom he had three sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1746, on the death of his brother William, husband of the eccentric Anne, Lady Dick (<i>d</i>. 1741), Cunyngham succeeded to the baronetcy as Sir Alexander Dick, and moved to the family mansion of Prestonfield, at the foot of Arthur's Seat, near Edinburgh. While no longer needing to work as a physician, he still practised for scientific purposes, and in 1756 was elected president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, an office which he held for seven successive years. He voluntarily resigned in 1763 on the ground &#145;that it was due to the merits of other gentlemen that there should be some rotation&#146;. Dick continued to devote time to the service of the college; he contributed substantially to the building of the new hall in George Street, and helped to establish the library. His portrait was later placed in the college library as a mark of respect.<br>
<br>Dick helped to obtain a charter for the Royal Society of Edinburgh and was elected a fellow on 3 November 1783. He also promoted the establishment of a medical school in the Royal Infirmary. When James Mounsey of St Petersburg first brought the seeds of the true rhubarb into Britain, Dick, who probably knew the properties of the plant from his old teacher's nephew, A. K. Boerhaave, gave great care to its cultivation and pharmaceutical preparation. The Society of Arts presented him in 1774 with a gold medal &#145;for the best specimen of rhubarb&#146;. Dick corresponded with Dr Johnson and James Boswell, who paid a visit to Prestonfield during their celebrated journey to Scotland. Boswell apparently wished to marry Dick's daughter. Dick died at the age of eighty-two, on 10 November 1785.<br>
