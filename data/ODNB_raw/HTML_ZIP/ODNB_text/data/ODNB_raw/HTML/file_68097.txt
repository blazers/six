<span class="headword">L'Estrange <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Stubbe]</span>,  Alice</span>, Lady L'Estrange  (1585&#150;1656), <span class="occ">keeper of household and estate accounts</span>, was the only child of Richard Stubbe (<i>d</i>. 1619), a lawyer, and his second wife, Anne Goding, formerly widow of John Le Strange (<i>d</i>. 1582). Richard Stubbe had two distinct families and estates. His elder daughter Dionsina, from his first marriage to Elizabeth, the daughter of Anthony Gurney of Ellingham, married Henry Yelverton (1558&#150;1631) of Rougham in 1589. Alice clearly harboured some resentment of her &#145;sister Yelverton&#146;. In one of her account books Alice recorded the details of her father's estate. While her sister received lands worth &pound;498 a year, Alice's estate at Sedgeford which her mother brought to Richard Stubbe at marriage, with property in Kings Lynn and Holme Parsonage, was worth &pound;473. On marriage, both were given cash sums and continuing assistance until Stubbe's death in 1619, but Alice's total of &pound;4669 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. was substantially less than the &pound;6392 allowed to the Yelvertons, largely for the repayment of debt. Despite the apparent unfairness, the entries in the accounts show a close relationship between father and daughter; from her father Alice acquired a sophisticated knowledge of farming and an aptitude for accounting.<br>
<br>Richard Stubbe also played a formative role in the upbringing of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67340/', "Sir Hamon L'Estrange (1583&#150;1654)")</script>, son of Sir Nicholas L'Estrange (1562&#150;1592) and nephew of Anne Stubbe's first husband. Alice and Hamon were married on 8 June 1602 and appear to have enjoyed a highly successful marriage; the paintings they commissioned from John Hoskins in 1617 portray a lively and attractive couple. Hamon frequently prefaced her accounts with encouraging biblical quotations, describing her as a &#145;pearl above price&#146; and one who &#145;overseeth the ways of her household &amp; eateth not the brede of idleness&#146; (allusions to the virtuous woman of <span class="roman">Proverbs</span>: 31) and pointing out that &#145;He that contemneth small things shall fall little by little [as found in] <span class="roman">ecclesiasticus</span>&#146;  (Norfolk RO, LEST/P8). In his will he thanked her for her &#145;ever incessant industry to the just, faithful and laudable advantage and advancement of my estate&#146; and for &#145;the most pious and painful care in the education of my children&#146;  (ibid., LEST/AE8). They had eight children, of whom four survived to adulthood: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16513/', "Sir Nicholas L'Estrange (bap. 1604, d. 1655)")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16507/', "Hamon L'Estrange (1605&#150;1660)")</script>; Dorothy (1608&#150;1609); Jane (1611&#150;1620); Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1613), who in 1636 married William Spring, bt, of Pakenham, Suffolk; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16514/', "Sir Roger L'Estrange (1616&#150;1704)")</script>; John (1618&#150;1619); and Mary (<i>b</i>. and <i>d</i>. 1621). The sons, like their father, all produced published work: Roger became an accomplished pamphleteer, Hamon specialized in theological works, while Nicholas compiled a jest book which attributes forty-three jokes and anecdotes, some of them quite bawdy, to his mother, Alice.<br>
<br>Methodical bookkeeping was Alice's principal contribution to the management of the household and the estate. She began in 1609, taking over the household accounts from Hamon, following the death of their daughter Dorothy. Over the years she branched out into supplementary accounts and estate records. From 1613 she kept weekly kitchen accounts itemizing the purchase, production, and consumption of food and drink by the household, and from 1617 she recorded the profits of her dairy. In 1618, as her father's health declined and he was less able to continue his practice of collecting their rents, auditing accounts, giving them sheep, and offering advice, she assumed responsibility for the Sedgeford estate. This involved not only receiving rents, but keeping the intricate sheep accounts, organizing grazing regimes and crop rotations, drawing up rentals and field books, and commissioning a survey. From 1621 she kept building accounts for Hamon, and from 1631 she rationalized and maintained the records for the entire estate at Hunstanton, Heacham, and Ringstead. During the civil war, when husband and sons were heavily committed to the royalist cause, Alice managed the household and estate single-handed, recording their losses and rising debts. Her accounts only ceased in 1654 on Hamon's death. She died in 1656 at Hunstanton Hall and was buried at Hunstanton church on 9 November.<br>
