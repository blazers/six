<span class="headword">Pickersgill,  William</span>  (1847&#150;1936), <span class="occ">shipbuilder</span>, was born on 28 August 1847 in Dock Street, Monkwearmouth, Sunderland, co. Durham, the eldest child of William Pickersgill (1823&#150;1880), shipbuilder, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bedingfield. His father, who had been apprenticed at Laing's yard, founded a shipyard, Pickersgill and Miller, at Southwick about 1851, and launched his first vessel in 1854. By the time the partnership was dissolved in 1863, the yard had completed more than thirty ships. Pickersgill was apprenticed to a timber yard before working as a carpenter and then as foreman in his father's yard. He became a junior partner in the firm in 1869. On 24 August 1870 he married Ellen (1845/6&#150;1932), daughter of Joseph Lincoln of Southwick, a farmer and butcher.<br>
<br>A traditional shipyard, Pickersgills built forty-six wooden ships, and it was the last firm on the Wear to do so, launching <i>Coppername</i>, the last wooden ship to be built on the Wear, in 1880. The firm had bought more land to extend the yard, in order to be able to build iron ships, but it was while working on its first iron ship that Pickersgill's father was killed in an accident at the yard in 1880. Pickersgill took over as managing director, joined by his two younger brothers, Charles (<i>d</i>. 1895), and Frederick, who left the firm when it became a private company in 1907. Their first iron ship, SS <i>Carmargo</i>, was launched later that year. Pickersgill managed to keep the yard going during the depression of 1885&#150;7, and by the end of the 1880s had changed from iron to steel construction, following the lead of the Clyde shipyards.<br>
<br>The reputation of Pickersgills in the 1880s rested on its sailing ships. Its iron clippers and steel barques competed with the fastest in the world. Pickersgills built several iron clippers for the copper ore and nitrate trade based on Liverpool, including the <i>Chepica</i> (1885), later commemorated by John Masefield in his poem &#145;Ships&#146; as &#145;The <i>Chepica</i>, a steel grey lovely barque&#146;. In the early 1890s they built large sailing ships for the Liverpool trade in coal from New South Wales. The <i>Andhorina</i> (3400 tons) was the largest sailing ship ever built on the Wear. Pickersgills also perfected the clipper for the Newfoundland fishing grounds. The last tall ship built on the Wear, the <i>Marguerita</i>, was launched by Pickersgills in 1893.<br>
<br>Pickersgills also continued to build steamers for many leading shipping lines, and later specialized in cargo steamers. In the twenty years since taking over the management of the yard, Pickersgill succeeded in increasing the annual tonnage of ships built from 3907 tons in 1881, when the yard was eleventh of the Wear yards in tonnage, rising to fifth place in 1900, with 20,845 tons. Although his son William John Pickersgill took over as managing director in 1907, when the firm became William Pickersgill &amp; Sons Ltd, Pickersgill continued to play an active role at the yard until 1915.<br>
<br>Pickersgill was a member of the Bethesda Free Church, an independent evangelical church. A keen cricketer, he also played football for the Sunderland Cricket and Football Club. He died at his home, 3 The Avenue, Sunderland, on 29 May 1936; he was survived by four sons. The company merged with Austins in 1954 to become Austin and Pickersgill Ltd, which became North East Shipbuilders Ltd after the nationalization of the shipbuilding industry in 1977. It survived until 1988 and the closure of the last shipyards on the Wear.<br>
