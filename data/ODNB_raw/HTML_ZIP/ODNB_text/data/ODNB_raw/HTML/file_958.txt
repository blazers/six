</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ayton, Sir  Robert</span>  (1570&#150;1638), <span class="occ">poet and courtier</span>, was born at the castle of Kinaldie, near St Andrews, Fife, the second of four sons, to Andrew Ayton (<i>d</i>. 1589), landowner, and his wife, Mariona London or Lundie, daughter of the laird of Balgonie. Through his father's mother, Marjorie Stewart, he could claim descent on the wrong side of the blanket from James II. A branch of the family of Ayton, originally established at Ayton (&#145;the town on the river&#146;) in the Merse, Berwickshire, had been settled in Fife since the fifteenth century, when Andrew Ayton, &#145;2d sone to the Laird of Aytone in the Merss&#146;, settled in Fife as sheriff-depute (17 October 1496), and was granted letters of take, or lease, to the west half of the lands of the town of Dunmure. In 1501 he was appointed keeper of Stirling Castle and sheriff of Stirlingshire, and further grants of lands followed. This Andrew Ayton, Robert Ayton's great-grandfather, was clearly a man of wealth and power, and he and his wife, Isobel Kincragy, produced three sons to divide the lands he had accumulated, and seven daughters who all married into well-known and landed Fife families.<br>
<br>Like his father, Ayton matriculated at St Leonard's College, St Andrews University, together with his elder brother, John, on 1 March 1584. He is listed in December that year as one of those who had subscribed the articles of religion, and he graduated BA in 1588 and MA probably in 1589, the year of his father's death. Ayton inherited &pound;1000, but little is known of his life between leaving St Andrews and his appearance in London in 1603 after spending some years studying in Paris. Thomas Dempster, historiographer royal to James VI and I  (<span class="italic">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Scotorum</span>, 1627), records that &#145;diu in Galliis bonas artes excoluit&#146;, but what form of fine arts he studied is not known, and Dempster is an unreliable historian (though more reliable on his contemporaries). He also records that Ayton wrote poems in Latin, Greek, French, and Scots; no Greek or French specimens have survived. It was probably during this period that he wrote his earliest-known English poems, including &#145;Diophantus and Charidora&#146;, notable for being much more Scottish in orthography and grammar than most of his work.<br>
<br>That Ayton was established in London and close to the court by the end of 1603 is indicated by his poem &#145;To Queen Anne on a New Year's Day 1604&#146;. Before leaving Paris he had written a long Latin panegyric to King James (&#145;De foelici, et semper augusto, Jacobi VI, Scotiae insularumque adiacentium regis, imperio nunc recens florentissimis Angliae et Hiberniae sceptris amplificato&#146;, 1603) for presentation on his return, and the frequent poems addressed to the king thereafter were no doubt designed to secure royal favour [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95583', "Castalian band")</script>]. In 1608 he was appointed a groom of the privy chamber, a highly desirable post at &pound;20 p.a. with generous livery. There were also Christmas and new year gifts (&pound;100 was divided among the grooms and pages of the privy chamber at Christmas, and grooms got 40<i>s</i>. each at new year), immunity from prosecution, and other rich pickings.<br>
<br>In 1609 Ayton was one of the envoys appointed to deliver James's <span class="italic">Premonition to All Most Mighty Monarchs, Kings, Free Princes and States of Christendom</span>, his answer to the pope's response to his <span class="italic">Apologie for the Oath of Allegiance</span> (1607). Ayton's journey took him to Heidelberg, Wurtemberg, Hesse, Brunswick, Saxony, and Brandenburg, and his good offices were rewarded in 1611 with a life pension of &pound;140 p.a. and a knighthood conferred at Rycot on 30 August 1612. Some time between this date and Prince Henry's funeral on 8 November 1612 he succeeded Sir William Fowler as secretary to Queen Anne, a post of power and privilege which ranked him fourth in order of precedence in the queen's household, which at this time also included Samuel Daniel and John Florio. On 26 February 1615 Ayton obtained a grant of denization  (TNA: PRO, patent rolls, C66/1909/28) which made him a naturalized English citizen.<br>
<br>Queen Anne's death in 1619 did little to depress Ayton's career. In 1619 he secured the reversion of the mastership of the royal hospital and collegiate church of St Katharine by the Tower, though he was not to enjoy this until the death of the incumbent, Sir Julius Caesar, in 1636; also in 1619 he was granted a pension of &pound;500, presumably in recognition of his services to the queen. In 1623, on the death of Thomas Murray of Tullibardine, provost of Eton, Ayton applied to succeed him, though, by his own account, his application was motivated by a desire to provide for Murray's widow and children as much as by personal ambition. There was keen competition for the post, which eventually went to Sir Henry Wotton. On the succession of Charles I in 1625 Ayton resumed his old post of secretary to the queen, which he retained until his death on 25 February 1638. He was buried three days later in the south aisle of the choir in Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>Only Ayton's Latin poems were published in his lifetime, in Arthur Johnston's <span class="italic">Delitiae poetarum Scotorum</span> (1637). His English poems were collected by his nephew and executor, Sir John Ayton, second son of his elder brother, who helped himself to one or two for his own purposes in the process. In the introduction to this manuscript collection he explained that<blockquote>The author of these ensueing Poems did not affect the name of a Poet having neither publish't in print nor kept coppyes of anything he writ, either in lattin or English and which makes this small collection the more difficult and in many things imperfyte and uncorrect especially in the old Scotts peeces which were don in his younger days. (BL, Add. MS 10308)</blockquote>The early poems are indeed the least rewarding of his output. Heavily influenced by the poets of the French <i>Pl&eacute;iade</i>, whom he had encountered in Paris, and too often written in the uninspiring poulter's measure associated with &#145;diers&#146; or laments, these pastoral love complaints make tedious reading today, as do his poems of compliment to James and his queen.<br>
<br>It was not until Ayton was settled in London that he found a lighter, more epigrammatic vein, and a gift for songwriting second to few among his contemporaries. Settings (mostly anonymous) of many of his poems have survived, and it is fairly clear that pieces such as &#145;Wrong not, sweete empress of my heart&#146; (less plausibly attributed to Ralegh), &#145;Thou sent to mee a heart was crown'd&#146;, and &#145;There is none, noe none but I&#146; were written to be sung. Elsewhere, in contrast to his earlier, passionate laments, he affected a light sententiousness and an amiably cynical approach to love, as befitted a middle-aged, cavalier poet in comfortable circumstances who never married:<blockquote>
<div>Yet have I been a lover by report,<br>
</div>
<div>Yea, I have dyed for love as others doe,<br>
</div>
<div>But, prais'd be God, it was in such a sort<br>
</div>
<div>That I revived within an houre or two.<br>
</div> (&#145;On Love&#146;)</blockquote>His authorship of &#145;I do confess thou'rt smooth and fair&#146; has been challenged on behalf of a number of other poets, including Ralegh. The correct attribution of this and other poems is unlikely ever to be firmly established, but the style, the musicality, and the content are certainly close to Ayton's known work, and the possibility that it is indeed his cannot be lightly dismissed. Watson's failure to credit it explicitly to him in his <span class="italic">Choice Collection</span> means little, given the slapdash way in which the collection was compiled, and no other serious evidence has been adduced. His authorship of the very similar &#145;I lov'd the once, I'le love noe more&#146; is unchallenged, and compares well with it.<br>
