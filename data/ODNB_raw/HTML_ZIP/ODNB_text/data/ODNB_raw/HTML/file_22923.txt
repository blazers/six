<span class="headword">Pye, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1708/9&#150;1785), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the son of Henry Pye (1683&#150;1749) and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bathurst. Through his mother he was related to Allen, first Earl Bathurst, a political strength which ensured peacetime commands and steady promotion during a long and undistinguished career. Pye passed his lieutenant's examination on 12 June 1734, his age then being given as twenty-five  (TNA: PRO, ADM 107/3, p. 252), and on 18 April 1735 he was promoted third lieutenant of the <i>Preston</i> (48 guns, Captain Charles Cotterell), cruising in home waters. He transferred with his captain to the <i>Ripon</i> (60 guns), based at the Tagus. For the next three years he served in the <i>Warwick</i> (60 guns) in the Mediterranean before, on 13 April 1741, he was given command of the newly built <i>Seaford</i> (24 guns). Stationed in home waters for a year, the ship then went to the Mediterranean under Admiral Thomas Mathews, who sent her to the Adriatic to disrupt supplies going to the Spanish army in Italy. In August 1744 Mathews appointed Pye to the <i>Norfolk</i> (80 guns), which remained on the station under Vice-Admiral Henry Medley, supporting the Austrian army off the south of France. Pye brought the ship home in March 1748. At the peace he was given the <i>Norwich</i> (50 guns), going to North America, and in the following year he commissioned the <i>Humber</i> (44 guns), cruising to the west coast of Africa. He sailed for Nova Scotia in the <i>Gosport</i> (44 guns) in June 1751, returned the same year, and in February 1752 was appointed to the <i>Advice</i> (50 guns), with a broad pennant as commander-in-chief in the Leeward Islands.<br>
<br>It was at this point that Pye's hasty temperament caused a dispute which nearly ended his career. In October 1755 he was superseded by Commodore Thomas Frankland but Pye, according to Frankland, &#145;excessively angry&#146;, kept his broad pennant flying  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/306, Frankland to John Clevland, 8 Oct 1755). Frankland, reprimanding Pye for not obeying a senior officer, also charged him with financial irregularities, interfering with the purchase of naval stores, and with damaging the <i>Advice</i> by removing parts of her timbers for an unnecessary survey. Pye returned home, claiming that he would not receive a fair hearing in the Leeward Islands. Since he should have been tried there, the Admiralty at first did nothing, though Pye was eventually tried by court martial in the first four days of March 1758. He was reprimanded for the lesser charges and was lucky to escape the charge of disobeying a senior officer. Lord Anson and Edward Boscawen were at sea at the time, and Pye was able to ensure leniency by bringing political pressure to bear on the civilian members of the Admiralty board  (NMM, papers of Sir Gilbert Elliot, ELL/9, Thomas Pye, &#145;An account of my conduct&#146;). On 5 July 1758 he was promoted rear-admiral, but he saw no active service during the Seven Years' War.<br>
<br>In 1762 Pye was made commander-in-chief at Plymouth and promoted vice-admiral (21 October). From 1766 to 1769 he was again made commander-in-chief of the Leeward Islands, flying his flag first in the <i>Lark</i> (32 guns) and then the <i>Chatham</i> (50 guns). On his return Pye made a short and unremarkable foray into politics, being elected as government candidate for Rochester on 9 May 1771. He appears never to have spoken in the Commons and was defeated at the election on 7 October 1774. Philip Stephens, the secretary to the Admiralty, remarked to Lord Hardwicke that the voters of Rochester &#145;had conceived an utter aversion to our Admiral Sir Thomas Pye, and I find they would have taken anybody who offered himself in preference to him&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 35612, fol. 114). From 9 May 1771 to 18 May 1774 he had been commander-in-chief at Portsmouth, during which time the king had reviewed the fleet at Spithead. On 24 June 1773 he had knighted Pye on the quarterdeck of the <i>Barfleur</i> (98 guns) and at the same time ordered his promotion to admiral.<br>
<br>Pye served as commander-in-chief at Portsmouth for most of the American War of Independence, taking up his command on 27 May 1777. He presided at the celebrated court martial of Admiral Augustus Keppel in Portsmouth, in January 1779, which he tried to avoid by pleading ill health. He was made lieutenant-general of marines on 26 September 1780 and retired on 31 March 1783. Pye died on 26 December 1785 at his house on Suffolk Street, London. His wife, details of whom are unknown, had died in 1762; the couple had one daughter, Mary. Pye's will also reveals that for seventeen years he had a mistress, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2117/', "Anna Maria Bennett")</script>, wife of Thomas Bennett, customs officer. At his death Pye left his Suffolk Street residence to Anna Maria and forgave the sizeable debt owed to him by her husband; this relationship produced at least two children, including Harriet [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39766/', "Esten, Harriet Pye")</script>].<br>
<br>Contemporary opinion of Pye's abilities (he was known by junior officers as Goose Pye) is uniformly harsh, while he has been described by a modern authority as &#145;something of a naval grotesque who aroused mingled amusement and contempt&#146;  (Rodger, 76). He was unable to express himself clearly on paper and his handwriting was awkward: when a vice-admiral he wrote to Lord Sandwich, enjoining the first lord<blockquote>not to scrutinize too close either to the spelling or the grammatical part as I allow myself to be no proficient in either. I had the mortification to be neglected in my education, went to sea at 14 without any, and a man of war was my university. (<span class="italic">Private Papers</span>, 1.36)</blockquote>In this and in many other ways Pye was not a typical mid-eighteenth-century naval officer.<br>
