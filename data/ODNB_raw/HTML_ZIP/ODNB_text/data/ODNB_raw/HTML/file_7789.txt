<span class="headword">Taylor,  Silas</span>  (1624&#150;1678), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and antiquary</span>, was born on 16 July 1624 at Harley, near Much Wenlock, Shropshire, the eldest son of Silvanus Taylor, a &#145;grand Oliverian&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1st edn, 1691&#150;2, 464). Wood says that Taylor's surname was Domville, but that he rarely used this alternative name. Nothing is known about the subject's mother but his father was a &#145;busie man against the King's party&#146;  (ibid.). Silvanus Taylor was a member of the high court of justice in 1650, lieutenant of the Tower (1649&#150;50), and a regular member during the 1650s of various committees and commissions in the counties of Herefordshire, Shropshire, Radnorshire, and Middlesex. He appears to have lived in the parish of St Clement Danes, Westminster.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>Silas Taylor entered Shrewsbury School in September 1637; Wood's statement that he was also at Westminster School is unconfirmed. He entered New Inn Hall, Oxford, at the beginning of 1641. On the outbreak of the civil war he joined the parliamentary army, becoming a captain under Colonel Edward Massey, the garrison commander of Gloucester, whose command also included Herefordshire and Monmouthshire. Virtually nothing is known of Taylor's exploits during the war, nor of his marriage, but he was in Hereford in 1645 when his wife was buried in the cathedral (Hereford Cathedral archives, fabric accounts). According to John Aubrey, Taylor's &#145;eldest sonne, wife and children were all burnt in their beds in &hellip; near Lothbury&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 310) presumably the street of this name, near the Guildhall in the City of London. Taylor never remarried. In August 1647, along with Massey and other officers loyal to the Presbyterian parliament, Taylor was in arms in Hyde Park, intending to defend London against the New Model Army.<br>
<br>Taylor's father was active in the Herefordshire land market and purchased for &pound;728 the manor of Bosbury when the lands belonging to the cathedral church of Hereford were auctioned in 1649. Some of this land, according to Wood, was settled upon his son who added to it other church properties including Litley Court in the parish of Hampton Bishop, close to Hereford; the disused &#145;almshall&#146; of the hospital of St Ethelbert, adjoining the cathedral close; and in 1655 the major portion of the bishop's palace at Hereford, which he shared with Colonel John Birch. On the last &#145;he lay'd out much money in building and altering&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 309).<h2>
<a name="HighofficeinHerefordshire"></a>High office in Herefordshire</h2>Early in the 1650s Taylor was appointed joint sequestration commissioner for Herefordshire with Captain Ben Mason. His pragmatic approach to this powerful office made him &#145;beloved by all the King's party&#146; in Herefordshire  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 308) but created friction with his fellow commissioner who was more dogmatic but less scrupulous in accounting for the moneys which passed through his hands. A bitter dispute ensued. Taylor's letters to his masters in London suggest that by means of prevarication he certainly allowed many &#145;papists and delinquents&#146; to enjoy their estates longer than the parliamentary administrators expected, and thus lost them income, as Mason was quick to point out. He drew up a series of articles against Taylor in 1653 who responded with a similar list of Mason's irregularities. After an inquiry held in Gloucestershire in August, Taylor was acquitted and eventually became the sole sequestration officer for Herefordshire. At the root of the dispute with Mason lay Taylor's increasing tendency to become identified with the county community of Herefordshire. During disputed elections in 1656 Taylor is noticed as one of those prominent in supporting the candidature of Colonel Edward Harley and John Scudamore&#151;two members of the most prominent families in Herefordshire and both alienated from the parliamentary regime at this date.<br>
<br>Taylor's religious views, like those of his father, appear to have been Erastian and Presbyterian, favouring the survival of a state church, under lay control. His vicious attack upon the cathedral minister Richard Delamaine, published anonymously as <span class="italic">Imposter magnus</span> (1654), was a response to the latter's apparent radicalism. Taylor says that with his father, Silvanus, and the celebrated divine John Tombes, he witnessed one of Delamaine's sermons, with which he inflamed his congregations. His exploitation of women in his congregations, and his &#145;strange applications&#146; of the scripture, said &#145;farewell to that very genuine sense of the word <span class="italic">Religion</span>, and to all civil society&#146;  (Taylor, <span class="italic">Imposter magnus</span>, 9). Taylor, an educated man, also distrusted a minister who lacked a university education, whose Latin was weak, and who could not even make a scale drawing of an ancient monument! There may have been a hint of intellectual arrogance here, for Wood records that Taylor was especially skilled in &#145;Mathematics and Tongues&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1st edn, 1691&#150;2, 466). Moreover, Delamaine was an ally of Mason and of the governor of Hereford Castle, Colonel Wroth Rogers, and thus represented a threat to Taylor's ascendancy in Herefordshire. They viewed Taylor's new acquaintances with suspicion and when he held a music meeting in January 1652&#151;a few months after Charles II's descent upon Worcester&#151;the presence of many royalists made the garrison of the castle &#145;keep to their arms&#146;  (Taylor, <span class="italic">Imposter magnus</span>, 26). The music was also conducted by Taylor's friend Matthew Locke, &#145;a papist that was in armes amongst the Rebels in Ireland&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Close Hypocrite Discovered</span>, 18).<h2>
<a name="IssuesconcerningHerefordCathedralLibrary"></a>Issues concerning Hereford Cathedral Library</h2>According to Aubrey, Taylor found the cathedral library at Hereford in disorder, the books and archives &#145;lay uncouth and unkiss&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 309). Rawlinson, writing soon after the Restoration, said the library had been &#145;plunder'd and several valuable MANUSCRIPTS taken away, but preserv'd by Silas Taylor&#146;  (Rawlinson, vii). Thus, though Aubrey and Wood insist that Taylor &#145;ransacked&#146; the library, modern commentators have found it difficult to prove this imputation. According to the scrupulous late twentieth-century catalogue of the cathedral library (Mynors), the only manuscript for which evidence exists for Taylor's misappropriation is &#145;De brevis relatio de glorioso Rege Willelmo&#146; bound with Lanfranc's &#145;Constitutiones&#146;, which Taylor may have found unbound, and in this state gave it to the Bodleian Library in 1658, after transcribing it for publication as an appendix to <span class="italic">Gavelkind</span> (1663).<br>
<br>Taylor's antiquarian collections for the history of Herefordshire, contained in BL, Harley MS 6726, show that far from looting the cathedral library he exploited its contents thoroughly, especially the bishop's registers, which are all present in the library at the beginning of the twenty-first century. The &#145;History of the county of Hereford&#146; was prepared for publication and even includes a crude title-page with Celtic, Roman, Saxon, and Norman figures ranged around a canopied opening. There is a general introduction on the &#145;Island of Great Britain&#146; with much sympathy displayed for the indigenous population such as the &#145;stout Silures&#146; while, in keeping with seventeenth-century radical thinking, the Normans are regarded as oppressive usurpers, &#145;outlandish inmates &hellip; strangers (to) the comons of England&#146;. The focus is very much upon Herefordshire and the marches and there are tantalizing references to sources in Taylor's possession, including &#145;a ms chronicle in my custody&#146; relating to Arthur's battles  (Harley MS 6726). A major part of the manuscript is devoted to the topography of the county combining local and national archive material, with published histories and personal observations made by the author between 1655 and 1657. The manuscript seems to have been left for safe keeping in the hands of Colonel Harley at Brampton Bryan in Herefordshire and the spare quire of paper purchased by Taylor for the &#145;History&#146; was later used for recording the militia assessment for Herefordshire of 1663. In 1672 he hoped to persuade John Olgilby to publish his collections in the third volume of &#145;Britannia&#146; only to find that he &#145;desired mee to epitomize my collections into 9 or 10 sheets of paper for Herefordshire, &amp; he would put it into what stile of English he thought fit&#146;  (BL, Egerton MS 2231, fol. 259). It seems likely that the manuscript remained at Brampton Bryan until it found its way into the Harleian collection. It was one of the sources rediscovered and exploited by John Duncumb for his <span class="italic">Collections towards the History and Antiquities of the County of Hereford</span>, vol. 1 (1804).<h2>
<a name="LondonandDunkirk16591663"></a>London and Dunkirk, 1659&#150;1663</h2>From the evidence of Harley MS 6726 Taylor remained resident in Herefordshire until 1659 when &#145;upon the rising of George Booth in Cheshire &hellip; he received a Commission to be Captain of a Troop of Horse for the Militia of the City of Westminster, and showe'd himself very active in that employment&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1st edn, 1691&#150;2, 463). Along with his father he was also commissioner for the Westminster militia and in this role he makes an appearance in the diary of Samuel Pepys on 21 February 1660. While Pepys was listening to &#145;a canon of 8 voices composed by Mr Lock&#146;, Captain Taylor (probably Silas, though Pepys also has another seagoing colleague called Captain Taylor) reported amid the bonfires celebrating the passing of the Rump, that the gates of the city (recently destroyed on the orders of the Rump) were &#145;to be made up again&#146; and those members of the city in prison &#145;were to be set at liberty&#146;  (Pepys, 1.63).<br>
<br>Aubrey says that after the king's return Taylor was &#145;faine to disgorge all he had gott, and was ruined&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 309). But following a brief period in Scotland he found employment as the keeper of armaments at Dunkirk where Colonel Harley (now Sir Edward) was governor between 1660 and 1661. Taylor's practical turn of mind is demonstrated in a brief letter to Harley written in April 1661 reminding him of &#145;those engines that are made to quench fire by casting water&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 3.251). During this time he took refuge from his &#145;daily Turmoyl&#146;  (Taylor, <span class="italic">Gavelkind</span>, preface) in writing <span class="italic">The History of Gavelkind</span> (1663) which was dedicated to Harley. The book explores the tradition that in certain regions of England land tenure was pre-feudal. It was a response to an essay in the same field by M. William Somner of Canterbury, which simply explored &#145;the common Etymologistical notion thereof&#146;  (ibid., 1&#150;2). Taylor, however, set out to prove that the custom of gavelkind was a &#145;British original&#146;  (ibid., preface, 2), which had survived the Roman, Saxon, and Norman invasions of England. He corresponded with John Aubrey about the book and eventually sent him a copy.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsandappointments"></a>Final years and appointments</h2>In November 1664, through the offices of Sir Paul Neile, an active member of the Royal Society and a friend of Pepys, Taylor was appointed by royal warrant commissioner of the king's storehouse at Harwich for the annual fee of &pound;1000. Pepys notes that some of those close to the king felt the choice of an old &#145;fanatique&#146; for such a post was ill-considered. On becoming a member of the corporation in 1672 he had access to the books and records of the borough, and carried out a search among the records of the Tower of London. Another book was prepared for publication but &#145;the Thread of his Life being not long after cut off&#146;  (Dale, i) the manuscript was seized by his creditors. Eventually it found its way into the hands of the antiquarian Samuel Dale who used it as a palimpsest for his own researches, and published Taylor's original text, combined with his own in the form of notes, as <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of Harwich and Dovercourt</span> (1730).<br>
<br>Pepys was regularly in touch with Taylor, and even read a draft of his play&#151;&#145;The Serenade, or, Disappointment&#146;&#151;sent to him in 1669. He was embarrassed in June 1666 when Taylor sent him misleading news of an English victory over the Dutch at Dunkirk. Nevertheless he regarded Taylor as &#145;a good schollar, and among other things a great antiquary&#146;  (Pepys, 6.81) and in 1665 was shown Taylor's copy of the charter of King Edgar, in which the king refers to himself as <i>Rex marium</i> <i>Britanniae</i>. This, according to Aubrey, had been &#145;garbled&#146; from the library at Worcester Cathedral and was offered to the king for &pound;120. After Taylor's death Aubrey tried to interest the secretary of state in the document, since the prebends of Worcester &#145;cared not for such things&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 309). Taylor also tried to sell the king a manuscript on the philosopher's stone, but again with no success.<br>
<br>Pepys, Aubrey, and Taylor also shared a common interest in music. Aubrey noted that he had composed for the king and that in &#145;those unmusicall dayes&#146; after the civil war he possessed a fine chamber organ  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 347). Wood remembered that Taylor had played in the music faculty at Oxford before 1660 while Pepys also commented on his skill as a composer. He was, however, less flattering about an anthem played at the Chapel Royal in June 1668, which he declared was<blockquote>a dull, old-fashioned thing, of six and seven parts, that nobody could understand: and the duke of York, when he came out, told me that he was a better store-keeper than anthem-maker, and that was bad enough too (Pepys, 9.251)</blockquote>Two of his compositions were published in John Playford's <span class="italic">Court Ayres</span> (1655) and several other pieces are known to have existed in manuscript. His younger brother, Sylvanus (<i>d</i>. 1672 in Dublin), also composed and performed music.<br>
<br>Taylor died in straitened circumstances&#151;&#145;his papers lying with him&#146; but some already pawned  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1st edn, 1691&#150;2, 464)&#151;at Harwich on 4 November 1678. He was buried in the chancel of the parish church of St Nicholas and, according to Dale, &#145;without either Grave Stone or Inscription to preserve his Memory to Posterity&#146;  (Dale, 37).<br>
