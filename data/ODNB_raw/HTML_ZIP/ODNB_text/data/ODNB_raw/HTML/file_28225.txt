<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Vermigli,  Pietro Martire <span class="st"> [Peter Martyr]</span></span>  (1499&#150;1562), <span class="occ">evangelical reformer</span>, was born in Florence on 8 September 1499, the son of Stefano Vermigli (<i>c</i>.1456&#150;<i>c</i>.1528) and Maria Fumantina (<i>d</i>. 1511). At his baptism he received the name Piero Mariano, possibly in honour of the contemporary Florentine preacher Fra Mariano Della Barba da Genazzano.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Vermigli was the eldest of three surviving children; his sister Felicit&agrave; Antonia and brother Antonio Lorenzo Romulo were born on 31 July 1501 and 30 April 1504 respectively. His father, a shoemaker, was sufficiently prosperous to leave 200 scudi to the poor of Santa Maria Nuova in his will. Vermigli received his early education from his mother, who taught him Latin, after which he attended a school for the children of the Florentine nobility run by Marcello Virgilio Adriano, a chancellor of the republic and friend of Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli. In 1514&#151;apparently against his father's will&#151;he entered the monastery of San Bartolomeo at Fiesole, a house of the canons regular of St Augustine of the Lateran congregation. On completing his novitiate (probably in March 1518), he assumed the name Pietro Martire. Shortly afterwards he left Fiesole for Padua, where he attended the <i>Studio</i> and was received into the monastery of San Giovanni di Verdara. It was there that he taught himself Greek and acquired the Aristotelian training on which he was to base much of his work as a theologian. He also had contacts with Pietro Bembo's humanist circle, whose members included Reginald Pole and Marcantonio Flaminio.<br>
<br>Vermigli was ordained on 23 September 1525, and probably received his doctorate at about the same time. In April 1526 he was appointed a public preacher by the chapter-general of the Lateran congregation; he gave his first course of sermons in Brescia later that year. The next three years were spent preaching across northern and central Italy. Vermigli also lectured (on Homer as well as scripture) in the congregation's houses in Padua, Ravenna, Bologna, and Vercelli. In summer 1530 he took up the position of vicar to the monastery of San Giovanni in Monte in Bologna, where he began to study Hebrew with the assistance of a Jewish physician named Isaac. Three years later the chapter-general elected him abbot of Spoleto, an appointment which he held until May 1536. In Spoleto Vermigli enhanced his reputation by successfully restoring discipline to the convents of San Matteo and La Stella. His reward was to be elected abbot to the house of San Pietro ad Aram in Naples (April 1537).<h2>
<a name="Controversyandconversiontoprotestantism"></a>Controversy and conversion to protestantism</h2>In Naples Vermigli came into contact with the Spanish exile Juan de Vald&eacute;s, who introduced him to the writings of the protestant reformers. According to his earliest biographer, Josias Simler, Vermigli at this time read Martin Bucer's <span class="italic">Enarrationes perpetuae in sacra quatuor evangelia</span> and <span class="italic">Sacrorum psalmorum libri quinque</span>, and Huldrych Zwingli's <span class="italic">De providentia Dei</span> and <span class="italic">De vera et falsa religione</span>. Under Vald&eacute;s's tutelage Vermigli also embraced the key protestant tenet of justification by faith alone. The intellectual traffic was not all one-way: it has been suggested that Vermigli, for his part, was responsible for Vald&eacute;s's adoption of a strict doctrine of predestination, derived ultimately from Gregorio di Rimini, whose works Vermigli had studied in Padua.<br>
<br>Vermigli's drift away from Catholic orthodoxy soon attracted attention. When, during a series of public lectures on the first epistle to the <span class="roman">Corinthians</span> delivered in late 1539, he failed to expound <span class="roman">1 Corinthians</span> 3: 9&#150;17 along traditional lines&#151;as a proof-text for the doctrine of purgatory&#151;the Theatines denounced him to the Spanish viceroy, Pedro de Toledo, who forbade his further preaching. Vermigli was able to have the ban overturned only after appealing to Rome.<br>
<br>The controversy did not check Vermigli's rise within the Lateran congregation, to which he was elected one of four visitors by a chapter-general in April 1540. The following year he was named prior of San Frediano at Lucca, a house in urgent need of reform. Vermigli responded to the challenge by converting San Frediano into a centre of biblical scholarship, aided by Paolo Lacizi, Celso Martinengo, and the former Jew Emmanuel Tremellius, who taught Latin, Greek, and Hebrew respectively. All three were later to convert to protestantism. Vermigli himself held public lectures on the Pauline epistles, winning a substantial following among the civic aristocracy. In recognition of his achievements, the chapter-general named him to a seven-strong disciplinary commission in May 1542.<br>
<br>However, Vermigli's position was compromised by the activities of some of his more enthusiastic followers, notably Costantino da Carrara, prior of Santa Maria di Fregionaia, who questioned the authority of the pope and church councils, and Girolamo da Pluvio, vicar of San Agostino, who went so far as to celebrate the eucharist according to protestant rites. Under pressure from the curia, the senate of Lucca instituted a crackdown on heretical literature, which had been circulating freely in the city, and imprisoned da Pluvio. On hearing that a warrant had been issued for his own arrest, Vermigli, who had been finding it increasingly difficult to perform his religious duties in good conscience, decided that his only option was to seek sanctuary in protestant territory. On 12 August 1542 he left Lucca with three of his fellow canons, Lacizi, Teodosio Trebelli, and Giulio Santerenziano, who was to become his constant companion in exile. After conducting his first reformed Lord's supper (in Pisa), Vermigli fled via Florence, Ferrara, Verona, and Z&uuml;rich to Basel. There he remained for some weeks in the hope of securing a teaching position at the university, but in mid-October he accepted an invitation to take up the chair of <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> at Strasbourg, which had been left vacant by the death of Wolfgang Capito.<br>
<br>In Strasbourg Vermigli formed a close association with Martin Bucer, the city's reformer, who taught alongside him at the college of St Thomas. His teaching duties consisted in the main of biblical exposition: between late 1542 and 1547 he lectured and presided over disputations on the minor prophets, <span class="roman">Lamentations</span>, <span class="roman">Genesis</span>, <span class="roman">Exodus</span>, and much of <span class="roman">Leviticus</span>, establishing himself in the first rank of continental reformed theologians. Unfortunately only the lectures on <span class="roman">Lamentations</span> and <span class="roman">Genesis</span> 1&#150;42: 25 survive, although theses for disputation on the first three books of the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span> were later included in editions of Vermigli's <span class="italic">Loci communes</span>. It was during this period that Vermigli perfected the method of biblical commentary that was to become his trademark: close textual exposition interspersed with so-called commonplaces (excursuses on specific doctrinal topics of relevance to the text under discussion). Although pre-eminently an academic theologian, Vermigli continued to take an active interest in the fate of the Reformation in Italy. One of his first acts in Strasbourg was to write to the evangelicals of Lucca setting out the reasons for his flight, and his first published work was an exposition of the apostles' creed in Italian (<span class="italic">Una semplice dichiaratione sopra gli XII articoli della fede christiana</span>, 1544).<h2>
<a name="TheyearsinEngland"></a>The years in England</h2>Following the emperor Charles V's victory over the Schmalkaldic League at M&uuml;hlberg in April 1547 and the corresponding downturn of protestant fortunes in Germany, Vermigli's position in Strasbourg became precarious. However, in October he was invited to England by Thomas Cranmer, eager to attract continental protestant theologians to spearhead his drive for reform. Vermigli was accompanied to London by his fellow Italian Bernardino Ochino, who had received a similar invitation, and by the merchant John Abell. After spending the winter with Cranmer at Lambeth, he was appointed regius professor of divinity at Oxford, replacing Richard Smith (March 1548). There he undertook a major series of lectures on <span class="roman">1 Corinthians</span>, in the course of which he condemned clerical celibacy and the doctrine of purgatory. The lectures proceeded smoothly until, commenting on <span class="roman">1 Corinthians</span> 10: 16&#150;17, Vermigli challenged the Catholic understanding of the eucharist. Led by his predecessor Smith, conservative members of the university demanded that Vermigli defend his views in a disputation, which was eventually fixed for 4 May 1549. Before it could be held, however, Smith fled, first to St Andrews and then to Louvain, from where he issued tracts attacking Vermigli's teaching on justification and religious vows. When Vermigli insisted that the disputation go ahead, it was rescheduled for 28 May; Smith was replaced as spokesman for the Catholic party by William Tresham, a canon of Christ Church, William Chedsey, later president of Corpus Christi, and Morgan Phillips, principal of St Mary Hall. The outcome of the disputation, which took place over four days, was inconclusive, but it prompted Vermigli to publish the first systematic exposition of his eucharistic doctrine, the <span class="italic">Tractatio de sacramento eucharistiae</span> (1549), which appeared in an English translation the following year. In this work Vermigli weighed the competing Catholic, Lutheran, and &#145;Zwinglian&#146; interpretations against the evidence of scripture and the fathers, rejecting all three in favour of his own conception of the eucharist as the vehicle for spiritual union with Christ. The <span class="roman">Corinthians</span> lectures that had given rise to the disputation in the first place were published by Christoph Froschauer in Z&uuml;rich in 1551.<br>
<br>In July 1549 Vermigli was forced as a result of local disturbances accompanying the western rebellion to leave Oxford and seek refuge with Cranmer at Lambeth. Two of his sermons denouncing the rebels formed the basis for an address given by Cranmer at St Paul's on 21 July (Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, MS 102). Vermigli also influenced Cranmer's eucharistic thought; the archbishop's <span class="italic">Defence of the True and Catholic Doctrine of the Sacrament</span> (1550) makes considerable use of Theodoret, one of Vermigli's favourite church fathers, and of a manuscript of John Chrysostom's <span class="italic">Ad Caesarium monachum</span> which Vermigli had brought with him from Italy. The remaining years of Edward VI's reign saw Vermigli closely involved in English church politics; his intervention on the side of the church leadership was probably instrumental in persuading John Hooper to drop his opposition to the wearing of vestments in February 1551, for example. Even more significant was Vermigli's contribution to the reform of the liturgy. In late 1550 he and Martin Bucer were asked to suggest revisions to the 1549 prayer book. Although Vermigli's &#145;annotations&#146; on the book do not survive, the general tenor of the revised liturgy is in keeping with his understanding of the sacrament, which emphasized the eucharistic action rather than the elements of bread and wine. The second exhortation to communion that was added to the 1552 prayer book is actually a translation of Vermigli's <span class="italic">Adhortatio ad coenam Domini mysticam</span>. Vermigli also participated in another of Cranmer's key projects, the reform of canon law. In October 1551 he was appointed to the commission of thirty-two scholars charged with this task, and over the winter of 1551&#150;2 he helped produce the draft set of ecclesiastical laws later published by John Foxe as the <span class="italic">Reformatio legum ecclesiasticarum</span>. The manuscript copy of this text in the British Library contains marginal annotations in Vermigli's hand (BL, Harley MS 426.C). His influence has also been detected in the forty-two articles of 1553, especially in article 17, on predestination.<br>
<br>In Oxford, Vermigli began a course of lectures on <span class="roman">Romans</span>, published in 1558 as <span class="italic">In epistolam ad Romanos commentarii</span>. The work contains lengthy commonplaces on justification and predestination, directed against the Catholic theologian Albert Pighius. However, he continued to encounter resistance in the religiously conservative university. On 20 January 1551 he was appointed first canon of Christ Church, but the local population reacted angrily when he attempted to bring his wife, Catherine Dammartin, a former nun from Metz whom he had married in 1545, into college. After the windows of his rooms, which looked out onto Fish Street, had been repeatedly smashed, Vermigli was forced to move to safer lodgings in the cloisters, where he built himself a study (demolished in March 1684). Following Mary's accession in July 1553, he was placed under house arrest, where he remained for six weeks until he was able to secure permission from the privy council to leave England. Once again he was received at Lambeth by Cranmer, who on 14 September advised him to flee to the continent. Some time after Vermigli's departure the body of his wife, who had died on 15 February 1553 and was buried in Christ Church Cathedral, was exhumed on the instructions of Cardinal Pole and placed on a dungheap. In 1558 the remains were reinterred in the cathedral, together with the relics of St Frithuswith.<h2>
<a name="StrasbourgandZrich"></a>Strasbourg and Z&uuml;rich</h2>On 30 October 1553 Vermigli arrived back in Strasbourg, where the orthodox Lutheran party headed by Johann Marbach was now in the ascendant. In order that he might be allowed to resume teaching, Vermigli agreed to sign the Augsburg confession, but not the Wittenberg concord with its affirmation of the substantive presence of Christ in the eucharist. During his second Strasbourg period Vermigli lectured on the book of <span class="roman">Judges</span> and Aristotle's <span class="italic">Nicomachean Ethics</span>, while Girolamo Zanchi, a former prot&eacute;g&eacute; of his from San Frediano in Lucca, expounded the <span class="italic">Physics</span>. Among those attending Vermigli's lectures were numerous English exiles, including the future bishop of Salisbury John Jewel, who later accompanied him to Z&uuml;rich; it is likely that they were the intended audience for the discussion of political questions, such as the right of resistance to tyranny, which dominates his <span class="roman">Judges</span> lectures. An English translation of part of those lectures was published as <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Cohabitacyon of the Faithfull with the Unfaithfull</span> by W. Rihel in 1555. Vermigli's links with the Marian exiles also extended to the English church at Frankfurt, which in August 1554 asked him to arbitrate in disputes over the use of the second Edwardian prayer book and the validity of Lutheran baptism.<br>
<br>In the face of increasing hostility from Marbach and the Strasbourg Lutherans, Vermigli accepted an invitation from Z&uuml;rich to succeed Konrad Pellikan as professor of <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> (July 1556). There he was able to renew his friendship with Ochino, now minister to Z&uuml;rich's Italian church, of which Vermigli was elected an elder. Between August 1556 and his death Vermigli lectured on 1&#150;2 <span class="roman">Samuel</span>, <span class="roman">1 Kings</span> and <span class="roman">2 Kings</span> 1&#150;11. His vigorous support for the doctrine of double predestination in these lectures brought him into conflict with his Erasmian colleague Theodore Bibliander, who defended the freedom of the will. The dispute was only settled by Bibliander's dismissal in February 1560, which some scholars have interpreted as a decisive moment in the theological transition of the Z&uuml;rich church from Zwinglianism to Calvinism  (Staedtke, 536). This was only one of several doctrinal controversies involving Vermigli during his final years. His continued interest in English affairs (evident also from his correspondence with John Jewel, Edmund Grindal, and Richard Cox, all bishops under Elizabeth, who repeatedly sought to entice him back to England) led him in 1559 to publish two polemical works against English Catholics: the <span class="italic">Defensio doctrinae veteris et apostolicae de sacrosancto eucharistiae sacramento</span>, a response to Stephen Gardiner's <span class="italic">Confutatio cavillationum</span>; and the <span class="italic">Defensio ad Riccardi Smythaei duos libellos de caelibatu</span>. The eucharistic tract, which was dedicated to Elizabeth I, runs to more than 800 pages and is widely regarded as the most comprehensive exposition of the reformed doctrine of the Lord's supper produced during this period.<h2>
<a name="Deathandworks"></a>Death and works</h2>The eucharist was again the main point at issue when, in September and October 1561, Vermigli attended the colloquy of Poissy as the representative of the Z&uuml;rich church. There he was conspicuous in his opposition to any agreement between French Catholics and protestants that would have meant compromising the reformed position on the Lord's supper. Another focus of Vermigli's activity was Poland, whose reformed church was split over the doctrine of the mediator proposed by the Mantuan exile Francesco Stancaro. The Z&uuml;rich church's official refutation of Stancaro's errors, the <span class="italic">Epistolae duae ad ecclesias polonicas</span> (1561) is sometimes attributed to Vermigli. Christology, with its implications for the doctrine of the eucharist, was also the theme of Vermigli's last published work, the <span class="italic">Dialogus de utraque in Christo natura</span> (1561), a refutation of the doctrine of ubiquity championed by the Lutheran theologian Johannes Brenz. A second work against Brenz was planned, but before it could be brought to fruition Vermigli fell ill of fever, and died in Z&uuml;rich on 12 November 1562; he was buried in the cloisters of the Z&uuml;rich Grossm&uuml;nster. He was survived by his second wife, Caterina Merenda of Brescia whom he had married on 9 May 1559 and who later married the Locarnese merchant Ludovico Ronco, and by a posthumous daughter, Maria, who married first another Locarnese exile, Bernardo Zanino, and second Georg Ulrich, minister in Thalwil. A portrait of Vermigli, dated 1560 and painted by the Z&uuml;rich artist Hans Asper, hangs in the National Portrait Gallery.<br>
<br>Before his death, Vermigli had published his Strasbourg lectures on <span class="roman">Judges</span> (<span class="italic">In librum Judicum commentarii</span>, 1561), but the task of editing his later works for publication fell mainly to the Z&uuml;rich churchmen Josias Simler, Johannes Wolf, and Rudolf Gwalther. The lectures on the <span class="italic">Ethics</span> (<span class="italic">In primum, secundum, et initium tertii libri ethicorum Aristotelis ad Nicomachum &hellip; commentarius</span>) appeared in 1563, and were followed by the <span class="italic">Preces sacrae ex psalmis Davidis desumptae</span> (1564), a collection of prayers dating from Vermigli's first Strasbourg period; the lectures on 1&#150;2 <span class="roman">Samuel</span> (<span class="italic">In duos libros Samuelis &hellip; commentarii</span>, 1564); the lectures on 1&#150;2 <span class="roman">Kings</span> (<span class="italic">Melachim</span>, 1566); the lectures on <span class="roman">Genesis</span> (<span class="italic">In primum librum Mosis &hellip; commentarii</span>, 1569); and the lectures on <span class="roman">Lamentations</span> (<span class="italic">In Lamentationes &hellip; commentarium</span>, 1629). In 1576 the French minister in London, Robert Masson, published the first edition of the <span class="italic">Loci communes</span>, extracted from Vermigli's published commentaries and arranged according to a scheme based on Calvin's <span class="italic">Institutes</span>. Fourteen editions of the <span class="italic">Loci</span>, which subsequently included a selection of Vermigli's correspondence, sermons, and orations, appeared between 1576 and 1656. Vermigli's works appear to have been especially popular in England and in the English colonies in America. English translations of his commentaries on <span class="roman">Romans</span> and <span class="roman">Judges</span>, the <span class="italic">Loci</span>, the <span class="italic">Preces sacrae</span>, and the exposition of the apostles' creed were published during the later sixteenth century, and his commonplace &#145;On wine and drunkenness&#146; was included in the Elizabethan <span class="roman">Book of Homilies</span>. Vermigli's reputation waned during the course of the seventeenth century, but he has recently become the focus of renewed scholarly interest, focusing on his achievements as an exegete and his contribution to the systematization of reformed doctrine in key areas such as predestination and, above all, the eucharist.<br>
