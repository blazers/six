<span class="headword">Playfair,  James</span>  (1755&#150;1794), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in Benvie, near Dundee, on 5 August 1755, the third son in the family of five sons and three daughters of the Revd James Playfair (1712&#150;1772), minister of Liff and Benvie, and his second wife, Margaret Young (1719/20&#150;1805). His eldest brother was the distinguished mathematician and geologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22367/', "John Playfair (1748&#150;1819)")</script>; a younger brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22370/', "William Playfair (1759&#150;1823)")</script>, the pamphleteer, inventor, and mathematician. After their father's death in 1772 John assumed responsibility for the upbringing of the family and, it appears, for launching James on his career. Where or with whom James Playfair received his training is not known, but by 1783 he was established in London; and in that year he announced himself by publishing a pamphlet on <span class="italic">A Method of Constructing Vapour Baths</span>, and began to exhibit at the Royal Academy.<br>
<br>Playfair's practice, however, was to be mainly in Scotland, and it developed rapidly from that time. In 1785 he won the competition for a public building in his native county of Forfarshire, the town and county hall in Forfar. At about the same time he secured the patronage of Henry Dundas, first Viscount Melville, the most powerful man in Scotland, for whom he designed Melville Castle, Edinburghshire (1786&#150;91); while his small number of English patrons included the collector Sir George Beaumont. By 1789 he was employing five assistants in London, and his brother Robert, a solicitor in Edinburgh, was attending to his Scottish business; and in spite of his Presbyterian background Playfair was working on Sundays to keep up with the pressure of work. In the course of this success he also travelled abroad on at least two occasions: in 1787 he visited Paris, where William Playfair was then the agent of the Scioto Land Company of Ohio&#151;and for whom he later made abortive designs for an ideal &#145;American city&#146;&#151;and in 1792&#150;3 he was in Italy, where his itinerary included the Greek temples of Paestum. This promising start to a career was, however, to be abruptly terminated, for after eleven years in practice Playfair died at the age of thirty-nine.<br>
<br>A significant proportion of Playfair's executed work must therefore be regarded as not fully mature, but in spite of this he is a figure of considerable interest as a pioneering exponent of the spare detail and basic geometrical forms of advanced neo-classicism. These qualities were already present to a degree in certain early works, such as the Forfar town hall (1786&#150;8) and Kirriemuir church, Forfarshire (1786&#150;90), while at Melville the somewhat perfunctory detail in the castellated style is accompanied by other features reminiscent of the work of Sir John Soane. But his style developed rapidly after his Parisian visit of 1787, when he doubtless encountered at first hand the revolutionary architecture of E.-L. Boull&eacute;e and C. N. Ledoux. The results of this experience can be seen, for example, in the Graham mausoleum in Methven, Perthshire (1793), and a number of unexecuted projects of his later years, but most particularly in his finest and best-known work, Cairness House, Aberdeenshire (1791&#150;7). Here the clear-cut geometry of the main block is completed by the extraordinary service range which clearly shows the direct influence of French neo-classicism; it is semicircular in plan with a similarly shaped entrance arch and primitivist Doric details. The whole, with further features such as the &#145;Egyptian&#146; billiard-room, forms one of the most remarkable neo-classical houses in Britain.<br>
<br>Playfair married Jessie Graham, and their children included the well-known Scottish architect <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22371/', "William Henry Playfair (1790&#150;1857)")</script>. Playfair died in Edinburgh on 23 February 1794, according to Joseph Farington, of &#145;a broken heart in consequence of the death of his eldest boy&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 1.180). His wife survived him.<br>
