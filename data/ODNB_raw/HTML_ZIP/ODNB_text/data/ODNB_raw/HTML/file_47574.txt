<span class="headword">Gifford,  (Thomas Johnstone) Carlyle</span>  (1881&#150;1975), <span class="occ">lawyer and investment trust manager</span>, was born at Ingleston, Twynholm, Kirkcudbrightshire, on 14 January 1881, the son of Patrick Gifford, a farmer, and his wife, Barbara Sloan Grierson. He was educated at George Watson's College, Edinburgh, and Edinburgh University. On 11 June 1907 he married Maud Oriel Riata, the daughter of the Hon. Charles Henry Pearson, fellow of Oriel College, Oxford; they had one son.<br>
<br>Gifford undertook his legal apprenticeship with W. J. Cook, writer to the signet, and spent a period as private clerk to Sir Henry Cook. He himself became a writer to the signet on 29 March 1905. He then accepted an offer from Augustus Baillie to go into partnership, and the firm of Baillie and Gifford, writers to the signet, was formed in 1906. Its legal practice was quite small, but the partners had some contacts in the rubber plantation business, from where their future growth was to come. In 1909 the Straits Mortgage and Trust Company was set up to lend money to planters, with Baillie and Gifford as managers and secretaries. Four years later its name was changed to the Scottish Mortgage and Trust Company. Baillie's role was to bring in new business, while Gifford ensured that it was conducted properly.<br>
<br>Gifford specialized in two areas of law: land law, and the rules and regulations of the stock exchange. His talents in these areas led him to be invited to serve on the boards of several investment trusts, and by 1925 he was present on the boards of companies run by all of the Edinburgh fund management groups. On the outbreak of the Second World War he served on the boards of twenty-two companies. As well as investment companies and trusts, these included the Scottish Widows Fund and Life Assurance Society. By 1957 Baillie, Gifford &amp; Co. had become the largest of the Scottish investment trust managers&#151;a position they retained at the time of Gifford's death in 1975. By then he had been semi-retired for several years.<br>
<br>In building up the investment side of the business Gifford was aware of the need to employ non-lawyers. His solution was to split the business between investment and law. Two firms were created, one consisting of lawyers, the other of fund managers, and by 1970 there were no common partners. Gifford's business interests were not confined to Edinburgh, and he set up two investment trusts in London in 1929. His great involvement in the trust business led him to become closely involved in the setting up of the Association of Investment Trust Companies in 1929. Elected the first deputy chairman of this organization, he also served as chairman between 1934 and 1936.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Gifford was called into government service. He served on the committee which advised on the requisition and disposal of overseas investments, and by 1940 he was described in <span class="italic">The Times</span> as &#145;special British Treasury Agent in charge of the sale of British holdings of American securities&#146;  (<span class="italic">DSBB</span>). He spent almost two years in the USA, and was involved in the disposal of other British assets. The only controversy was over the sale of American Viscose, which was owned by Courtaulds: Winston Churchill later claimed that it had been sold at too low a price  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Gifford's sojourn in the USA reinforced an already strong belief in the free enterprise system, and in the immediate post-war years he remained opposed to nationalization and state regulation. It also reaffirmed his view that the USA was likely to be at the forefront of world economic growth. In the post-war years, despite the expense of acquiring overseas investment funds, he invested heavily in the USA, and was rewarded with the growing pre-eminence of his firm among British investment managers.<br>
<br>Beyond the investment world Carlyle Gifford, as he was popularly known, had many other interests. As a lawyer he had a reputation for pleading successfully in tax cases. He also served on the court of Edinburgh University. The owner of a small farm at Humbie in East Lothian, he was a not very successful breeder of Hereford cattle. On 4 May 1960 he married Sophia Mary Wharton Millar; they had one son. Gifford loved sport and played tennis, including real tennis, and golf. He was a member of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers and an enthusiastic bridge player. He was an atheist, and was given to occasional acts of charity.<br>
<br>Gifford died on 24 January 1975 from heart failure at his home, 24 Rothesay Terrace, Edinburgh, survived by his second wife.<br>
