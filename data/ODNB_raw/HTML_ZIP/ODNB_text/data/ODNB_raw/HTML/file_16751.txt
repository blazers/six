<span class="headword">Lipscomb,  William</span>  (1754&#150;1842), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was baptized on 9 July 1754 at St Thomas, Winchester, the son of Thomas Lipscomb, surgeon, of Winchester, and his wife, Sarah. He entered Winchester College in 1765, and matriculated at Oxford as a scholar of Corpus Christi College on 6 July 1770. In 1772 he won the prize for English verse, the subject being the beneficial effects of inoculation, and the poem appeared as a pamphlet that year. It was reprinted in 1793, and in the <span class="italic">Oxford Prize Poems</span> in 1807 and 1810. He graduated BA in 1774, and MA in 1784. On 19 August 1780 he married Margaret, second daughter of Francis Cooke of Gower Street, cashier of the navy; they had a large family. For some years he was private tutor and subsequently chaplain to the earl of Darlington at Raby Castle, Durham. From 1789 to 1832 he was the rector of Welbury in the north riding of Yorkshire, which he was allowed to hand over to his son Francis in 1832. He was also master of St John's Hospital, Barnard Castle, Durham.<br>
<br>Lipscomb, a frequent contributor to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, wrote: <span class="italic">Poems &hellip; to which are Added Translations of Select Italian Sonnets</span> (1784) and <span class="italic">The Canterbury Tales of Chaucer Completed in a Modern Version</span> (3 vols., 1795). This publication was a compilation of the work of several translators, with which Lipscomb combined his own. George Lipscomb MD was his cousin.<br>
<br>Lipscomb died at Brompton, London, on 25 May 1842. He was survived by ten of his children, including <a name="cosubject_16751"></a><span class="headword">Christopher Lipscomb</span>  (1781&#150;1843), who was baptized on 20 November 1781 at Staindrop, Durham. He matriculated at New College, Oxford, on 12 July 1800 at the age of eighteen. He graduated BA in 1804, MA in 1811, and BD and DD in 1825. He was vicar of Sutton Benger, Wiltshire, from 1818, and was appointed the first bishop of Jamaica in 1824, a post which he took up in 1825, and the duties of which he pursued with vigour, &#145;always bearing in mind that the object, as he said, of his mission was to improve the spiritual condition of the slave population&#146;  (Ellis, 65). He was the author of <span class="italic">Church Societies: a Blessing to the Colonies</span> (1840). He died on 4 April 1843, and was buried at St Andrew's Church, in Jamaica. He was survived by at least three sons, Cyril William (<i>b</i>. 1831), Edward Webber (<i>b</i>. 1832), and Arthur Morton (<i>b</i>. 1841).<br>
