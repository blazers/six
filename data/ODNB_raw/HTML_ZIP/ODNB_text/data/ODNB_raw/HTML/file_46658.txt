<span class="headword">Allitsen,  Frances</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Mary Frances Bumpus]</span>  (1848&#150;1912), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 30 December 1848 at 159 Oxford Street, London, one of the seven children of John Bumpus (1817/18&#150;1880), a bookseller, and his wife, Emma Louisa Barton (1824/5&#150;1892). She was baptized Mary Frances Bumpus at St Andrew, Holborn, on 25 December 1853. Little is known about her early life other than that her parents were opposed to the idea of a woman entering the musical profession or studying music seriously. Mary Bumpus was initially interested in writing novels and stories, but with the encouragement of its principal, Weist Hill, studied at the Guildhall School of Music, where she was a corporation exhibitioner for at least four years when she was in her thirties (1881&#150;5). Even as a student she was known as Frances Allitsen, a pseudonym doubtless chosen to assuage her parents' dismay at her choice of career. Nevertheless they may still have refused to help her financially, since she seems to have given singing lessons in order to pay for composition tuition.<br>
<br>Many of Allitsen's early works were performed at Guildhall concerts in the early 1880s, including a piano sonata, a &#145;Slavonic&#146; overture for orchestra, and several songs. It was as a songwriter that she was to become best known, although she continued to write instrumental music throughout her life. Her songs are on a large scale, displaying formal inventiveness, complex harmonies (often with an additional accompanying instrument as well as the piano), and a keen ear for detailed word painting.<br>
<br>Allitsen took great care over the financial details of her career, keeping a precise record of her transactions with various publishers from 1885 to 1896  (BL, Add. MS 50071). For most of her songs she received a 3<i>d.</i> royalty for every copy sold, sometimes with an additional down payment. By the 1890s her passionate and harmonically complex songs were being frequently performed all over Britain by the leading singers of the day, such as David Bispham and Clara Butt, often accompanied by Allitsen herself. A collection of <span class="italic">Six Songs</span> to poems by various authors, including Tennyson and Marie Corelli, was published in 1889 and sold well. But her most popular song was a setting of Charles Mackay's &#145;There's a land&#146;, published in 1896 and widely performed by Clara Butt during the South African War. Other of her bombastically patriotic songs also became particularly popular at this time, as did her religious songs, such as the psalm setting &#145;The Lord is my light&#146; (1897). In addition, Allitsen wrote several works that she regarded as more &#145;artistic&#146;, including the song cycle for baritone and piano <span class="italic">Moods and Tenses</span> (1905).<br>
<br>Allitsen's cantata <span class="italic">For the Queen</span>, to a libretto by Frank Hyde, for baritone, mezzo-soprano, bass, chorus, and orchestra, was first heard at the Crystal Palace, London, in 1911. Several elements of this work, such as details of plot and aspects of musical style, can also be found in <span class="italic">Bindra the Minstrel</span> (1912), her only opera. This is a dramatically engaging work for which she wrote her own libretto, about how a deposed king in tenth-century Asia is saved by his trusty minstrel who rekindles the devotion of the people through the power of his songs.<br>
<br>In 1911 Allitsen kept a short diary  (BL, Add. MS 50071) which shows her unsuccessful attempts at getting <span class="italic">Bindra the Minstrel</span> performed, as well as her depressed state of mind towards the end of her life. A typical entry reads: &#145;As usual&#151;health delicate, people unkind, remiss and neglectful&#151;professional anxieties and indecisions&#146;. She died of pleurisy on 1 October 1912 at her home, 20 Queen's Terrace, St John's Wood Road, London, and was buried in Hampstead cemetery.<br>
