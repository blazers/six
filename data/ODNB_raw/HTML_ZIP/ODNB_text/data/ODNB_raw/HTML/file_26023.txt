<span class="headword">Somerville,  John Southey</span>, fifteenth Lord Somerville  (1765&#150;1819), <span class="occ">agriculturist</span>, was born on 21 September 1765 at Fitzhead Court, near Taunton, Somerset, the only child of Hugh Southey Somerville (1729&#150;1795), younger son of James, thirteenth Lord Somerville, head of the Scottish branch of the family, and his first wife, Elizabeth Cannon (<i>d</i>. 1765), daughter of Christopher Lethbridge, of Westway, Devon. From his father's second marriage there were four sons and three daughters. In 1730 William Somerville, head of the older (English) branch of the family, granted the reversion of his remaining English estates to the thirteenth Lord Somerville, who therefore united the estates of the two families, the Scottish estate in Roxburgh, and the English estate at Aston-Somerville in Warwickshire. William Somerville died childless in 1742. The family hoped to buy the ch&acirc;teau of Somerville, in Normandy, but this plan was abandoned because of the French Revolution.<br>
<br>Somerville was educated at Harrow School, and then studied with a private tutor for three years in Peterborough, before entering St John's College, Cambridge, as a fellow-commoner on 28 June 1782. He graduated MA in 1785, and then went on the grand tour, meeting Francis Russell, fifth duke of Bedford, in Nice, and travelling with him to Leghorn and through Italy, Switzerland, and France. His inheritance of some of his mother's property in Somerset was disputed, but during the six years in which the case was in chancery, he improved the one farm of which he had possession. During the Napoleonic wars he became colonel of the West Somerset yeomanry, and continued to serve until a carriage accident forced him to resign.<br>
<br>Somerville succeeded to the title in 1796, on the death of his uncle, the fourteenth lord, and he was elected a representative peer of Scotland in the House of Lords. He was re-elected to the parliaments of 1802 and 1806. In 1793 he was appointed one of the first members of the board of agriculture, and on 23 March 1798 he was elected president of the board through Pitt's influence, ousting Sir John Sinclair; he remained president until 1800.<br>
<br>In 1799 Somerville became a lord of the king's bedchamber, and this brought him into close contact with George III, who took a keen interest in agriculture. Apart from the king, who was responsible for introducing merino sheep into England in 1788, Somerville became the largest breeder and owner of merinos in England. In 1802 he visited Spain, and managed to buy a flock of pure merinos. He was one of the leaders of the English merino movement; its members were mainly wealthy landowners, who formed the Merino Society of Great Britain in 1811 with Sir Joseph Banks as president. They wanted to cross the Spanish merino, which produced the best wool in Europe, with British Ryeland and Southdown sheep, to produce a superior animal. But English merino fleeces were inferior to the Spanish; moreover, the new crossbreeds could not compete in carcass quality with the improved English breeds such as the Shorthorns, and with the arrival of wool from Australia there was no future for the English merino. By 1850 there were no merino flocks left in Great Britain.<br>
<br>Somerville also invented several improved agricultural implements, including a plough. He was a patron of the Smithfield Club, founded in 1799, which was concerned with the fattening of cattle. In 1802 he started an annual show of cattle, sheep, and pigs in London, which he carried on at his own expense for many years, providing the prizes. He also promoted the replacement of horses as work animals with draught oxen. Among his publications were <span class="italic">The System Followed during the Last Two Years by the Board of Agriculture</span> (1800) and <span class="italic">Facts and Observations Relative to Sheep, Wool, Ploughs, Oxen</span> (1803).<br>
<br>Somerville spent the winter of 1818 in Italy, and the following summer in France, for the benefit of his health, but while travelling through Switzerland he died of dysentery at Vevey, on 5 October 1819. He was buried at Aston-Somerville, Warwickshire. He was unmarried, and was succeeded by his half-brother.<br>
