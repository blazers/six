<span class="headword">Lancastre Saldanha,  Adeline Louisa Maria  de</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Adeline Louisa Maria  De Horsey]</span>, Countess de Lancastre <span class="st"> [<em>other married name </em>Adeline Louisa Maria Brudenell, countess of Cardigan]</span>  (1824&#150;1915), <span class="occ">aristocrat</span>, was born on 24 December 1824, in Charles Street, Berkeley Square, London, the eldest of the three children and only daughter of Spencer Horsey Kilderbee 
    (from 1832, De Horsey; <i>d</i>. 1860)
   and Lady Louisa Maria Judith (<i>d</i>. 1843), daughter of John Rous, first earl of Stradbroke. Educated at home by French governesses, she became fluent in five languages and an accomplished musician. Adeline De Horsey made her society d&eacute;but in the 1842 season, and rapidly acquired a reputation as an unconventional, ambitious flirt, substantiated by her engagement in 1848 to the Carlist pretender to the Spanish throne, the count of Montemolin. His failure to take the throne led directly to the ending of the engagement.<br>
<br>Rumours about De Horsey's morals burgeoned when society observed her blossoming relationship with a friend of her father's, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3765/', "James Thomas Brudenell, seventh earl of Cardigan (1797&#150;1868)")</script>, army officer, who was married (albeit formally separated from his wife). In defiance of social convention, Adeline De Horsey was regularly seen riding in Hyde Park with the earl, without benefit of chaperon. In 1857, the remonstrations of her father caused her to leave his house, initially for a hotel in Hyde Park Square, and subsequently for a furnished house in Norfolk Street, Park Lane, where she was established by Cardigan as his mistress. She remained there until Cardigan arrived with the news of the death of his wife in July 1858. They sailed to the Mediterranean in August and were married in Gibraltar on 28 September. Lady Cardigan joined her husband in his favourite pursuits, hunting, yachting, and racing, and became a notable member of the &#145;sporting set&#146;; the courtesan Skittles referred to her as &#145;the head of our profession&#146;  (Thomas, 306). She was never welcomed in polite circles or at court. After Cardigan's death, childless, on 27 March 1868, Lady Cardigan took over the management of the family estates, which had been left to her for her lifetime; the improvements which she carried out and the repayment of heavy mortgages on the estates were a source of pride to her.<br>
<br>On 28 August 1873, Adeline Cardigan was married again, to Don Antonio Manuelo de Lancastre Saldanha, conde de Lancastre (<i>d</i>. 1898), having unsuccessfully sought to marry Disraeli. Following the marriage, she spent some time in his native Portugal, and in Paris, where the count preferred to live. By 1879, the countess of Cardigan and Lancastre (as she styled herself) had returned to Deene Park, ostensibly to oversee the management of the estates, while her husband remained in Paris, where he died in 1898.<br>
<br>In 1909 she published a volume of memoirs, <span class="italic">My Recollections</span>, which caused tremors to run through high society. Written by a publisher's assistant from notes of conversations, the book is full of scandal and malicious gossip, some half-remembered, some evidently fabricated, from the mid-Victorian period, without the customary discretion as to persons. The timing of the publication&#151;coinciding with anxieties over Lloyd George's budget&#151;was a particular source of concern. Lady Dorothy Nevill remarked: &#145;What people are afraid of is that when the election comes these Radical demons will cut pieces out just to show what the upper classes are&#146;  (Nevill, 194). Lady Cardigan remained unrepentant; eccentric and autocratic to the last, she died at Deene Park on 25 May 1915, and was interred in the parish church at Deene, with her first husband.<br>
