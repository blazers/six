<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dobell,  Bertram</span>  (1842&#150;1914), <span class="occ">bookseller and literary scholar</span>, was born on 9 January 1842 at Battle, Sussex, the eldest son of Edward Dobell, a journeyman tailor, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Eldridge (<i>d</i>. 1899). The family moved to London, where Edward Dobell was stricken with paralysis. In the Dobell MSS Bertram Dobell has recorded that life was in consequence &#145;very hard&#146; and that he himself was compelled &#145;to work at the most laborious and uncongenial tasks&#146;. Apart from that comment he was quite secretive about his early years. Nothing is known of his education. His first job was as a grocer's errand boy and he went on to serve as an assistant in the grocer's shop. He showed an early interest in old books, buying from the penny boxes on bookstalls.<br>
<br>When Dobell was nearly thirty he used his scanty savings to open a shop at 62 Queen's Crescent, Haverstock Hill, selling newspapers and stationery as well as books. He was aided by an advance of &pound;10 from a loan society, which was used to buy stock, &pound;3 being spent on books. From these humble beginnings, aided by a love of literature and a flair for recognizing a rare book when he saw one, and by dint of much hard work, he rose to become the proprietor of two bookshops in Charing Cross Road, held in high esteem by the leading bibliophiles of his day.<br>
<br>The diaries that Dobell kept meticulously throughout his bookselling years show that until a month before his death he attended auction sales assiduously, not infrequently taking in three or even four sales in a week. Dobell was, in modern terms, a workaholic, and family relationships may have suffered in consequence. Even when business was good money seemed always to be in short supply, and this may have led him to excessive restraint where personal expenditure was concerned. As an exception to this rule he regularly indulged his taste for opera. By 1901 he had accumulated stocks and shares worth &pound;2000. On 24 July 1869 Dobell married Eleanor Wymer (<i>d</i>. 1910), daughter of Henry Wymer, a timber merchant. They had five children, three boys and two girls, but in a letter (now in the Bodleian Library) to the New Zealand poet Dora Wilcox he confessed that there was &#145;little sympathy&#146; between himself and his wife, and that they &#145;did not live happily together, though [they] managed to endure the matrimonial yoke to the end&#146;.<br>
<br>As a bookseller Dobell published some 250 catalogues of books and manuscripts, his footnotes giving the catalogues their special flavour. His various catalogues devoted to books printed for private circulation remain useful bibliographical tools because of his annotations. Dobell was the author of <span class="italic">Sidelights on Charles Lamb</span> (1903), <span class="italic">The Laureate of Pessimism: a Sketch of the Life of James Thomson</span> (1910), and various books of verse, notably <span class="italic">Rosemary and Pansies</span> (1901), and <span class="italic">A Century of Sonnets</span> (1910). Other collections of his verse were published posthumously. He contributed articles on various literary topics to such periodicals as <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>, and the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>.<br>
<br>As an editor Dobell was responsible for editions of James Thomson, Shelley, Goldsmith, Strode, and others, but he is chiefly remembered for correctly identifying Thomas Traherne as the author of <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span> and <span class="italic">Centuries of Meditation</span> when their anonymous manuscripts were wrongly attributed to Henry Vaughan. A number of these edited works appeared over Dobell's own imprint. Closest to Dobell's heart were the works of Thomson, who, writing under the pseudonym B. V., first came to his notice in the columns of the <span class="italic">National Reformer</span> in 1868. Six years later, when that journal began serialization of &#145;The City of Dreadful Night&#146;, Dobell wrote to Thomson, urging him to have his poems published in book form, and later offered to bring out such an edition himself. When a business setback prevented him from doing so, he was able to persuade Reeves and Turner to take up the project. Dobell's first letter began a friendship that lasted until Thomson's death. Family legend has it that on occasion Thomson slept on the floor of Dobell's shop.<br>
<br>At seventy-two, although complaining of failing powers, Dobell was regularly going to Charing Cross Road and putting in a few hours' work each day until very shortly before his death. He eschewed the spectacles that had been prescribed for him and likewise found that he managed better without his dentures than with them. At his death from liver cancer at his home, 21 Queen's Crescent, Haverstock Hill, London, on 14 December 1914, his business passed to his sons Percy and Arthur.<br>
