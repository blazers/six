<span class="headword">Stedman,  Charles</span>  (1753&#150;1812), <span class="occ">military historian</span>, was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the second son of Alexander Stedman (1703&#150;1794) and Elizabeth Chancellor, daughter of a colonist originally from Somerset. His father, who had worked in Scotland as an advocate, fled with his two brothers after the Jacobites' defeat at the battle of Culloden. They settled in Philadelphia where he was appointed a supreme court judge. Following the outbreak of the American War of Independence he returned to Britain, and he died at Swansea in 1794. It was through his father that Charles Stedman claimed descent from the Scottish naval commander Andrew Barton (<i>d</i>. 1511).<br>
<br>Charles Stedman was educated in law at William and Mary College in Virginia. Like his father he remained loyal to the British crown, and on the outbreak of hostilities he was appointed commissary to the troops under the command of Sir William Howe. His knowledge of the German language assisted him both as interpreter with the German auxiliaries and afterwards as commander of a rifle corps of colonists from the Palatinate. He was twice taken prisoner, and sentenced to be hanged as a rebel, but on each occasion he managed to escape, once from the same prison that held the ill-fated Major Andr&eacute;. He was also twice severely wounded.<br>
<br>On the conclusion of peace in 1783 Stedman retired to England on the half-pay of a colonel, and was appointed to examine and settle the claims of the American loyalists. In 1794 his <span class="italic">History of the Origin, Progress, and Termination of the American War</span> was published in London and Dublin: it was well reviewed and remained the standard work on the subject for the next century. It was dedicated to Lord Rawdon, earl of Moira, his former commander-in-chief. Shortly after it appeared Sir Henry Clinton printed <span class="italic">Some Observations upon Mr. Stedman's History</span>, which questions the author's accuracy on minor points.<br>
<br>Through the influence of Marquess Cornwallis, Lord Rawdon's predecessor in the command, Stedman was appointed in 1797 to the office of deputy controller and accountant-general of the revenue of stamps, with reversion to the chief controllership, though this failed to materialize. He married Mary Bowen and they had one son, John, who became judge of the court at Gibraltar and compiled a genealogical memoir of the family in 1857. Stedman died on 26 June 1812, and was buried at Paddington, Middlesex.<br>
