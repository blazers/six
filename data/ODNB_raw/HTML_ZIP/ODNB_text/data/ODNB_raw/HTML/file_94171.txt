<span class="headword">Brown,  (Elizabeth) Iona</span>  (1941&#150;2004), <span class="occ">violinist and conductor</span>, was born on 7 January 1941 at the Cedars Nursing Home, Manor Road, Salisbury, Wiltshire, the first of four children of Antony Francis Brown, pianist and organist, and his wife, Fiona Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whitham, violinist. At the time of her birth her parents lived at 27A Canal, Salisbury. As she was born into a musical family it was almost inevitable that she should develop an interest in music at an early age. With the help of supportive parents who understood the pitfalls of the music profession&#151;her father was a respected keyboard player and her mother was a violinist in the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra&#151;her music education and performing career were nurtured carefully. All three of her siblings followed musical careers, Timothy as principal horn with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, Ian as a pianist and conductor with the Nash Ensemble, and Sally as a violist with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra.<br>
<br>Educated at the Cathedral School in Salisbury and Cranborne Chase School, Dorset, Brown began violin lessons at the age of five with Nora Atkinson. She progressed quickly, and in 1955 joined the National Youth Orchestra of Britain, with which she remained for five years. She never attended a conservatoire but instead studied with a string of leading performers and teachers, including Hugh Maguire in London, Remy Principe in Rome, Carlo Van Neste in Brussels, and Henryk Szeryng in Paris. On returning from her studies abroad she played in the pit for the Ballet Rambert and joined the Philharmonia Orchestra in 1963. She quickly came under the spell of the orchestra's conductor, Otto Klemperer, whose deep understanding of music she admired greatly. While still a member of the Philharmonia Orchestra she played with the Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields and joined the Cremona Quartet, the other members of which were Hugh Maguire (first violin), Cecil Aronowitz (viola), and Terence Weil (cello).<br>
<br>On leaving the Philharmonia Orchestra in 1966 Brown pursued a career as a solo violinist. One of her first important solo engagements was a performance of Mendelssohn's violin concerto with Sir Malcolm Sargent at the Promenade Concerts. That concert was of particular significance to her and she later recalled that &#145;the whole evening sticks in my mind &hellip; I nearly passed out from sheer excitement and fright&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 11 June 2004). In 1976 she gave the first performance of David Blake's violin concerto, which had been written for and dedicated to her, with Sir Charles Groves at the Proms. She continued to perform as a soloist at the Proms throughout her career and gave a memorable performance of Walton's violin concerto there with Sir John Pritchard and the BBC Symphony Orchestra in 1983. She was also a regular soloist with the Scottish National Orchestra, after making her d&eacute;but with it in 1967 with Tchaikovsky's violin concerto. As a violinist she amassed a considerable discography and, along with the first recording of Blake's violin concerto with Norman del Mar, she recorded the complete Mozart violin concertos, Bart&oacute;k's violin concerto no. 2 with Simon Rattle and the Philharmonia Orchestra, Vivaldi's <span class="italic">Four Seasons</span>, Vaughan Williams's <span class="italic">The Lark Ascending</span>, Beethoven's violin concerto, and many other works.<br>
<br>In 1974 Neville Marriner invited Brown to replace him as director of the Academy of St-Martin-in-the-Fields, a post that she retained until 1980. By accepting this appointment she took her profile as a performing artist to new heights. Having entered the male-dominated world of conducting, she was soon compared with some of the leading maestri of the period. Although she later remarked in an interview for <span class="italic">The Independent</span> that she occasionally wished she were a man because of the response of some players, she also argued that a conductor's ability was of greater importance than his or her gender. In contrast to contemporary trends, she continued to play baroque works on modern instruments with the Academy, and she was seen by many as a viable foil to period instrument performers. Under her direction the orchestra recorded with many international soloists, including Heinz Holliger, Sabine Meyer, and H&aring;kan Hardenberger, and although she was later tenured with other chamber orchestras she continued to conduct the Academy until the end of 1999.<br>
<br>In 1981 Brown was appointed music director of the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra. While the players often found her difficult personally they respected her drive and ambition. She broadened the orchestra's repertoire to include more romantic and twentieth-century works, and recorded a wide repertoire with the group that included Strauss's <span class="italic">Metamorphosen</span>, Tchaikovsky's <span class="italic">Souvenir de Florence</span>, Schoenberg's <span class="italic">Verkl&auml;rte Nacht</span>, and Britten's <span class="italic">Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge</span>. She led the orchestra on a number of successful tours, including two visits to the USA in the late 1980s. In 1991 she and the orchestra appeared at the Proms and later returned to that series in 1997; she remained with the orchestra until 2001. Between 1985 and 1989 she was also guest director of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, and she was music director of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra between 1987 and 1992. She was reportedly &#145;deeply sad&#146; when her contract with the latter was not renewed, on account of her commitments elsewhere  (<span class="italic">San Francisco Chronicle</span>, 11 June 2004); but she returned in 1995&#150;7 as conductor and music adviser. Although she was associated primarily with chamber orchestras she also conducted many major symphony orchestras, including the London Philharmonic, Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, Hall&eacute;, Bournemouth Symphony, Danish Philharmonic, San Francisco Symphony, and Tokyo Philharmonic orchestras.<br>
<br>Towards the end of her career Brown suffered from rheumatoid arthritis in the wrists. This soon affected her playing and she appeared for the last time as a violinist in Tokyo in 1998. Her health continued to deteriorate and, after being diagnosed with cancer of the colon in May 2002, she also withdrew from the podium. Although she could be outspoken and difficult professionally, she had a good sense of humour. She took great pride in her appearance and was particular about her concert dress. Like the respected Australian pianist Eileen Joyce, she was renowned for reappearing after the interval in a different gown. During her professional career, she played on the &#145;Booth&#146; Stradivarius, which she sold in 1999. In 1986 she was appointed OBE, and in 1991 she was made a knight of first class merit by King Harald of Norway. A first marriage ended in divorce, and on 7 February 2002 she married Bjorn Evan Arnils, a 39-year-old double bass player, and son of Evan Arnils, engineer. There was no child of either marriage. She died of cancer on 5 June 2004 at her home, Little Misselfore Cottage, Bowerchalke, Wiltshire, and was survived by her second husband, Bjorn.<br>
