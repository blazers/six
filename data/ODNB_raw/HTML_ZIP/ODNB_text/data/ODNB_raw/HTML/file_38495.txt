<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Magn&uacute;sson,  Eir&iacute;kur</span>  (1833&#150;1913), <span class="occ">librarian and Icelandic scholar</span>, was born in the parsonage of Berufj&ouml;r&eth;ur in east Iceland on 1 February 1833, the second son and third child of the Revd Magn&uacute;s Bergsson (1799&#150;1892), then curate of Berufj&ouml;r&eth;ur, and his wife, Vilborg Eir&iacute;ksd&oacute;ttir (1804&#150;1862). When his elder brother became ill, he was given the chance of advanced education and, after elementary Latin tuition by his father, entered Reykjav&iacute;k Latin school in 1849 and received his dimissory certificate in 1856. He then attended Reykjav&iacute;k Theological College and received the degree of <i>candidatus theologiae</i> (BD) in 1858 with first-class honours. In 1857 he married Sigr&iacute;&eth;ur Einarsd&oacute;ttir (1831&#150;1915) of Reykjav&iacute;k; they had no living children, but they fostered two children of his brother and sister.<br>
<br>Magn&uacute;sson's initial intention was to offer himself as a curate to his father in his better-endowed living of Kirkjub&aelig;r &iacute; Hr&oacute;arstungu, but events took a different turn. Among the many British travellers who visited Iceland in the mid-nineteenth century was the Quaker Isaac Sharp, who had been sent by the British and Foreign Bible Society to make arrangements for a new Icelandic version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, to be made in Iceland and published by the society. An Icelandic proof-reader well-versed in English was needed in London for this project. Magn&uacute;sson was already noted in Reykjav&iacute;k as an exceptionally skilful linguist, especially in English, and was chosen by the Icelandic church authorities. He left for London (via Copenhagen and Berlin) in 1862&#150;3; he was to remain in Britain for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>On his journey Magn&uacute;sson met A. C. Swinburne's friend George E. J. Powell, with whom he struck up a friendship which was to be extremely profitable for him. Not only was Powell to prove a financial crutch in the next eight lean years, but he also helped Magn&uacute;sson to produce his first English publication, a translation of a large portion of J&oacute;n &Aacute;rnason's classic collection of Icelandic folk-tales (2 vols., 1864&#150;6), and introduced him to William Morris. Morris became Magn&uacute;sson's faithful friend and collaborator for over thirty years, during which the two men laboured hard at making medieval Icelandic literature known to a larger public; their efforts culminated in the six-volume <span class="italic">Saga Library</span> (1891&#150;1905). In order to keep himself and his wife, Magn&uacute;sson also worked on a miscellaneous collection of linguistic and literary projects, such as an edition and translation of the devotional poem <span class="italic">Lilja</span> (1870), and he gradually acquired a circle of influential friends who were to support his election to an under-librarianship at Cambridge University Library, to which he was appointed in 1871, and which he held until his retirement in 1909.<br>
<br>At Cambridge, Magn&uacute;sson proved an enthusiastic member of the small band, led by Henry Bradshaw, who strove to modernize the workings of the university library. His ingenuity in library matters may be seen in the reports of the library syndicate in the 1870s and 1880s, and the numerous papers which he published on various aspects of librarianship show his endless goodwill and remarkable practical sense in his profession.<br>
<br>Not content with library work, Magn&uacute;sson also helped W. W. Skeat to build an Old Icelandic component, which he taught from the early 1880s, into the Anglo-Saxon tripos. He was given the title of lecturer in Icelandic in 1893, and retained it until H. M. Chadwick took it over. He proved an excellent, if pedantic teacher, as Sir Israel Gollancz and Dame Bertha Philpotts were to testify. He also published solid contributions to Scandinavian studies, the most notable (after his work with Morris) being his <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span> edition of <span class="italic">Th&oacute;mas saga erkibiskups</span> (1876&#150;83), a series of papers on runology, work on the <span class="roman">Elder Edda</span>, and on the history of the first Commonwealth. At the very end of his life he produced a remarkable verse translation of J. L. Runeberg's epic poem <span class="italic">King Fialar</span> (1912). Most of this work has been superseded by the efforts of later scholars, but much of it, especially the papers on calendar runes which Magn&uacute;sson published in the 1870s and 1880s in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Cambridge Philological Society</span>, was pioneering work. He also built up a valuable collection of facsimiles of Scandinavian &#145;clog calendars&#146;, which is now held in the Cambridge University Library.<br>
<br>Magn&uacute;sson's fierce patriotism led him to support every move to set Iceland free from its dependence on Denmark, and here he was to prove an unyielding and furious opponent of anyone who was, in his opinion, acting against Iceland's best interests. He did not confine himself to patriotism on paper: twice (in 1875&#150;6 and 1882&#150;3) he promoted collections to buy food and led expeditions to save people in north and east Iceland from starvation, undergoing considerable personal discomfort when chartering cargo vessels, which he himself led to the harbours of the most affected districts. These works of charity were not always popular with other Icelanders, however, as the country had not been universally affected by these natural disasters: in his later effort he was savagely attacked by his main enemy in England, Gu&eth;brandur Vigf&uacute;sson, with whom he had already clashed over the 1866 <span class="roman">Bible</span> translation. However, for over forty years Magn&uacute;sson's home in Cambridge was renowned among Icelanders for the warmth of his and his wife's hospitality.<br>
<br>Magn&uacute;sson died at 7 The Terrace, Camden Square, London, on 24 January 1913 of heart failure after a long urinary illness. His papers and correspondence, both immense, are (other than official papers at Cambridge) in the National University of Iceland Library in Reykjav&iacute;k.<br>
