<span class="headword">Clench,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1535&#150;1607), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the son of John Clench of Wethersfield, Essex, and Jane, daughter of John Amyas of the same county. His grandfather, also John Clench, came from Leeds in Yorkshire. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1556, called to the bar in 1563, and served as reader of Furnival's Inn for three years from 1566 to 1569; these readings were on the <span class="roman">Statutes of Wills</span> and the statute <span class="italic">De conjunctim feoffatis</span>. In 1570 he was called to the bench of Lincoln's Inn, where he delivered a reading in 1574 and was treasurer from 1578 to 1579. He became recorder of Ipswich in 1575. In 1580 he was created serjeant-at-law, his patrons at the ceremony being the earl of Oxford, Lord Wentworth, and Sir William Cordell. A year later, on 27 November 1581, he was appointed one of the barons of the exchequer, and on 29 May 1584 he was translated to the queen's bench.<br>
<br>Clench married Katherine, daughter of Thomas Almot of Creeting All Saints, with whom he had five sons and eight daughters. It was said that Elizabeth I referred to him as &#145;her good judge&#146;, but he was never knighted. By 1602, being &#145;so decrepit that he could not well travel outside his country&#146;  (Yale U., law school, MS G. R29.15, fol. 31), he was discharged from attendance at court; and on 17 September he was granted a pension. He died on 18 or 19 August 1607 at Holbrook, Suffolk, where he was also buried, and where there is a large monument bearing his effigy in robes. A three-quarter-length portrait in oils formerly existed in a number of versions, and was the basis of the quarter-length etching by Hollar dated 1664 for Dugdale's <span class="italic">Origines juridiciales</span>. Clench was a reporter of cases from 1571 to 1592. His autograph reports, never published, together with notes of his Furnival's Inn readings, are now in the British Library (Harley MS 4556); and there is an incomplete copy at Yale. His eldest son, Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1624), followed his father as a barrister of Lincoln's Inn and reader of Furnival's Inn; he served as member of parliament for Suffolk in 1620. Another son, Robert, was principal of Clifford's Inn from 1624.<br>
