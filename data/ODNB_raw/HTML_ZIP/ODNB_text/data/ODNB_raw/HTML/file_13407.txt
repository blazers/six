<span class="headword">Hobson,  Edward</span>  (1782&#150;1830), <span class="occ">botanist and weaver</span>, was born on 23 May 1782 in Ancoats Lane, Manchester. When he was three he was taken in by an uncle in Ashton under Lyne following his father's death and the subsequent alcoholism of his mother, while a younger brother remained in Manchester with his grandfather. Hobson attended schools in Ashton and Manchester, having swapped guardians with his brother after a few years. In 1794 he began to weave, producing muslins until some time after 1812 when, despite engaging in political activity to protect hand-loom weavers, he left the craft. By 1815 he was a warehouseman in Manchester.<br>
<br>Hobson's early enthusiasm for astrological herbalism may have inspired his interest in botany. About 1809 he began to attend botanical meetings held by working men in various pubs in and around Manchester at which participants would bring freshly gathered plants to be named aloud by the most expert botanist present, who acted as president of the meeting. Hobson established a strong friendship with John Dewhurst, who was president of Sunday pub meetings attended by working-men botanists from a wider region. Soon Hobson was assisting Dewhurst as namer of plants, eventually becoming president in the 1820s, as well as encouraging John Horsefield, who would later succeed Hobson as president. James Crowther was a good friend who possibly introduced Hobson to George Caley, who returned to Lancashire for the period 1811&#150;16. During this time Hobson and Caley were extremely close and they maintained a correspondence after Caley's departure for St Vincent.<br>
<br>From 1811 Hobson took up the difficult study of mosses and liverworts, soon becoming expert in this area. By 1815 his discoveries led William Jackson Hooker to seek a meeting with him in Manchester. Impressed by Hobson's abilities in finding and distinguishing these little-studied cryptogamic plants, Hooker gave him a microscope and began a correspondence with him in order to receive further information and specimens. With Hooker's encouragement, Hobson produced and sold about twenty-five sets of <span class="italic">A Collection of Specimens of British Mosses and Hepaticae</span>, known as <span class="italic">Musci Britannici</span> (2 vols., 1818&#150;22). These dried specimens were designed to accompany Hooker and Thomas Taylor's <span class="italic">Muscologia Britannica: Containing the Mosses of Great Britain and Ireland</span> (1818), in which they were advertised. In preparing <span class="italic">Musci Britannici</span>, Hobson exchanged letters and specimens with a wide range of naturalists from different social classes.<br>
<br>Hobson longed to travel like Caley as a botanical collector but, despite interest from Hooker and Robert Brown in 1819, was unable to do so because of responsibilities to his wife, Bridget (<i>d</i>. 1848), two sons, and seven daughters. Instead he was active in various scientific circles in 1820s Manchester, ranging from working-men's botanical meetings in pubs to involvement with the museum of the &eacute;lite and exclusive Natural History Society. By this time Hobson was primarily interested in entomology; the beetle <i>Chrysomela hobsoni</i>, discovered by Hobson, is described in James Francis Stephens's <span class="italic">Illustrations of British Entomology</span> (4, 1831, 343). Despite an offer of well-paid curatorial work of &pound;100 a year from the Manchester Natural History Society in 1829, Hobson remained a warehouseman.<br>
<br>In 1829, together with other artisans, Hobson founded and presided over the Banksian Society for the study of natural history, in which he encouraged a socially mixed membership. This society did not meet in a pub and, in contrast to the oral nature of pub meetings, deliberately emphasized a more literate culture in its organizational structure. One of the committee members, the radical Rowland Detrosier, gave the opening address, which was published under the title of <span class="italic">The Benefits of General Knowledge: more especially, the sciences of mineralogy, geology, botany, and entomology</span>, in which he stressed the right of all to enter the &#145;temple of science&#146;.<br>
<br>Possibly because of his mother's alcoholism, Hobson was extremely abstemious. He possessed an immense capacity for fieldwork, disregarding bad weather and climbing trees and onto roofs searching for mosses. When his health began to fail in the summer of 1830, well-to-do friends moved him to Bowdon, Cheshire, away from the smoky air of Manchester. Aware of the potential value of his specimens, Hobson wrote a will requesting they be sold for the support of his family. Over 11,000 dried plants were purchased by the Manchester Horticultural and Botanical Society for &pound;90 and his insect cabinet was sold to the Banksian Society (eventually passing to the Manchester Mechanics' Institution) for &pound;65.<br>
<br>Hobson died of consumption at Bowdon on 7 September 1830 and was buried at St George's Church, Hulme, Manchester. A memorial tablet inside the church commemorates his scientific achievements as well as his &#145;natural simplicity of manners&#146;. Hobson was a source of inspiration not only to artisan naturalists but also to gentlemen. James Aspinall Turner, Liberal MP for Manchester from 1857, began his extensive collection of coleopterous insects following the gift of two beetles from Hobson; Joseph Dalton Hooker maintained that his love of bryology was stimulated by Hobson's <span class="italic">Musci Britannici</span> in his father's library; and William Jackson Hooker himself declared to Dawson Turner in a letter of 14 October 1815, just after his only meeting with Hobson: &#145;I hardly ever saw a man possessed of more enthusiasm than this poor fellow&#146;.<br>
