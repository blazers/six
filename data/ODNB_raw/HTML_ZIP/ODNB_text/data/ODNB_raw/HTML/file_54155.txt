<span class="headword">Cathcart,  Alan, of that ilk</span>, first Lord Cathcart  (<em>c.</em>1430&#150;1496), <span class="occ">landowner and courtier</span>, was the eldest son of Alan Cathcart of that ilk; his mother's name is not known. Alan senior was a hostage in England for the ransom of James I from 1432 until exchanged for Alan junior in 1446, and is thought to have died shortly after his return to Scotland. The Cathcart genealogy in the middle ages is uncertain, as for 400 years from the early fourteenth century all the heads of the family except one were christened Alan, and references to the family before <i>c</i>.1450 are few. The younger Alan was the first of his family to be raised to the peerage, in June 1452, when James II needed reliable allies in the tense aftermath of his killing of William Douglas, eighth earl of Douglas. That Cathcart's main estates lay in Renfrewshire, a region of Stewart lordship from the twelfth century, would have made him a member of the king's affinity, and so a man James could count on. These estates were now united into the barony of Cathcart; he also possessed lands in Ayrshire and Linlithgowshire.<br>
<br>Cathcart was seldom at court before 1469, but after that he attended parliament regularly, though he rarely witnessed crown charters. He obtained the minor office of mair of fee of Kyle-Regis, Ayrshire, in 1478, was appointed warden of the west marches against England in 1481, and by 1483 had become master of the king's artillery, suggesting that he had proved to be a valuable servant of James III, after whose death in battle in 1488 Cathcart disappeared from court. His health may have been poor, as there are references to his tutor or curator in 1489 and 1495. He married Janet Maxwell, perhaps of the Caldorwood or Pollok line, who was still alive in January 1503. She is presumed to have been the mother of his four sons and three daughters. Cathcart's eldest son, Alan (the name of whose spouse is not known), predeceased him about 1490 and the latter's son John succeeded him on his death in late 1496. He is said to have been buried in the Dominican convent in Ayr.<br>
