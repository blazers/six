<span class="headword">Bainbridge,  Christopher</span>  (1462/3&#150;1514), <span class="occ">ambassador, archbishop of York, and cardinal</span>, was born at Hilton, near Appleby, Westmorland, the eldest of six children of Reginald Bainbridge and Isobel Langton; he owed much in his education and early advancement to his maternal uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16045/', "Thomas Langton")</script>, bishop of Winchester. In 1479 he held a papal dispensation to hold any benefice with or without cure on reaching the age of sixteen, and obtained another in 1482, where he is described as about twenty, to hold an additional benefice. He was rector of St Leonard Eastcheap, London, from 26 October 1478 and a canon of Salisbury from 1486. A &#145;magister&#146; by 1486, probably of Oxford, he was soon afterwards at Ferrara, where he witnessed the degrees of two German students in May 1487 and May 1488 respectively, and at Bologna, where he was admitted DCL on 24 October 1492 (later he is also recorded as DCnL); he was in Rome in 1492&#150;4, becoming in January 1493 a chamberlain of the English Hospice, from which he rented a house. Provost of Queen's College, Oxford (confirmed on 22 June 1496), he also served as a judge in the court of requests (1498&#150;9) and as master of the rolls (from 13 November 1504); he was incorporated at Lincoln's Inn on 20 January 1505. A chaplain of Henry VII by 1497, he rose steadily in the ecclesiastical hierarchy; he was dean of York (21 December 1503) and of St George's Chapel, Windsor (28 November 1505) until provided to the see of Durham on 27 August 1507. He resigned Durham on being translated to York on 22 September 1508, where his archiepiscopal register survives. He was an executor of Henry VII's will and attended the coronation of Henry VIII.<br>
<br>Bainbridge's appointment on 24 September 1509 as Henry VIII's ambassador to Pope Julius II initiated the final and most significant stage of his career. His main job was to embolden the papacy against France and in favour of England; he remained inflexibly tied to this purpose, in spite of set-backs. When he arrived in Rome on 24 November 1509 the Venetian cardinals and ambassadors sought his support in persuading the pope to break up the League of Cambrai against Venice and to lift the interdict from that state; they found him over-cautious and suspected that his main purpose was to get the red hat, but by February 1510 they were appreciative of the help he had given. Julius II's change of policy and breach with the duke of Ferrara, an ally of Louis XII of France, was advantageous to Bainbridge, who accompanied the pope in August 1510 on his long military campaign against the duke in Romagna and on 17 March 1511 was raised to the cardinalate at Ravenna (with the title of San Pietro e Marcellino); the appointment expressed Julius II's own need to count upon Henry VIII's support against France. In November 1511 England joined the Holy League and by March 1512 a papal brief was drawn up transferring Louis XII's title as &#145;Most Christian King&#146; to Henry VIII; this would be released to Bainbridge when Louis XII had been defeated, but that prospect became more remote in the summer when the English military expedition to Guyenne proved disastrous.<br>
<br>Bainbridge continued his belligerent policy after Leo X's election in March 1513; he strenuously opposed the readmission of the French and other cardinals who had called a council at Pisa against Julius II, and celebrated the Swiss victory against the French at Novara in June and Henry VIII's victories at Th&eacute;rouanne in August and Flodden in October. Throughout the winter of 1513&#150;14 he was counting on the formation of a decisive Anglo-imperial alliance against France, and the conferment of the French crown and titles upon Henry VIII; he hoped to accompany Maximilian to a summit meeting at Calais and then to return to England with legatine powers. All this came to nothing, thanks in part to the secret counter-diplomacy of Wolsey, Cardinal Adriano Castellesi, and Silvestro Gigli, bishop of Worcester, who had become ambassador of Henry VIII in Rome in 1512. Bainbridge was nevertheless acclaimed shortly after his death for his steadfastness, his exceptional loyalty, and his vehement defence of the king's interests, in a letter of Richard Pace to Henry VIII on 25 September 1514. As well as his energetic diplomacy, Bainbridge's duties in Rome on behalf of the English crown and clergy had also included taking charge of the English Hospice (from 1510 it was governed by his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, particularly his secretaries William Burbank and Pace), sponsoring in the papal consistory candidates for major benefices, and defending cases in the rota, the papal court of appeal. He also made some efforts to look after the affairs of his own diocese. Before he left England he had set up a commission to manage its administration, and subsequently reinforced its workings by instructions and favours sent from Rome, for instance granting an indulgence for contributions to the repair of St Wilfrid's Church, Ripon, on 1 June 1512.<br>
<br>As a curial cardinal Bainbridge had additional duties. He was immediately made legate to the papal army in the campaign against Ferrara, and on 22 March 1511 left Ravenna to join the forces assembling near Lugo with a plan of attack on a key fortress, the Bastia del Fossato Zaniolo. Because of bad weather and floods the campaign was abandoned at the end of April; Bainbridge then joined the army defending Bologna from the north. In mid-May he warned the city's administration of the worsening situation because of the army's lack of food and supplies; on 21 May Bologna fell, owing to an internal coup and the perfidy of Cardinal Alidosi, but this military failure was no fault of Bainbridge's. He received from Julius II the governorship of Vetralla, near Viterbo (15 October 1511), where a plaque survives bearing the papal and royal arms with those of Bainbridge; he was also given the presbyteral title church of Santa Prassede (22 December 1511) and the priory of Sant'Antonio, Reggio Emilia (19 June 1512). Bainbridge took part in the papal election in March 1513, receiving two votes in the first scrutiny and casting his own vote for Fabrizio del Carretto (not a member of the Sacred College); soon after being elected, Leo X conferred upon him the monastery of San Stefano, Bologna, and in July 1513 several benefices near Vicenza. He attended the first session of the Fifth Lateran Council (3 June 1513), being appointed to serve on two of its committees concerned with reform of the papal court. He was made protector of the Cistercian order (November 1513), in which capacity he tried to resolve a scandal at Sant'Ambrogio, Milan. In 1514 he was elected chamberlain (finance officer for one year) of the College of Cardinals.<br>
<br>In spite of living in the heyday of Renaissance Rome, Bainbridge appears to have been little interested in humanist scholarship or contemporary Italian art, though he was highly praised as a generous patron by his secretary and executor Richard Pace, who dedicated to him his translations of essays by Plutarch, and he took over the sponsorship of &#145;Pasquino&#146; from 1512 to 1514, paying for the annual publication of topical verses attached to a battered antique statue outside his Roman residence (on the site of the later Palazzo Braschi, near piazza Navona). There is no evidence to support the anecdotal account of Bainbridge's violent cruelty by Girolamo Garimberto, accepted by later writers, although he may well have been a belligerent negotiator and over-forceful advocate. In his English will he made benefactions to Queen's College, Oxford, and there is evidence he planned to found a school partly from the revenues of San Stefano, Bologna; but the Roman will which he had papal permission to make has not been found. It is known that he possessed silver plate, rich vestments and tapestries, and a large sum in cash at his death (a fellow cardinal reported it to be about 9000 scudi), but his only surviving tangible items of property are an incomplete archiepiscopal service book according to English use, with musical notation  (Cambridge University Library, MS ff.vi.1), and a pair of silver candle snuffers decorated with Henry VIII's arms and his own arms surmounted by the cardinal's hat (British Museum, MLA 1878, 112&#150;30 633). Whether his death on 14 July 1514 was the direct result of poison, administered by a servant, Raimondo da Modena, at the instigation of Silvestro Gigli, has not been clearly established; there may have been other contributory causes, though Raimondo confessed his guilt under torture and later committed suicide. Bainbridge's funeral was celebrated lavishly on 31 July 1514 in the chapel of the English Hospice, now the English College at Rome, via Monserrato, where his marble tomb, with a recumbent effigy, remains. His career stands out as that of the only English prelate to become a resident cardinal of the curia, with an insider's understanding of its practices and acquaintance with many of its members, in the century and a half before the breach with Rome.<br>
