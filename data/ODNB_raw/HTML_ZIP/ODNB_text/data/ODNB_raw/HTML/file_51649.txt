<span class="headword">Wilton,  John</span>  (1820&#150;1881), <span class="occ">music-hall proprietor</span>, was born in Bath Abbey, Bath, on 19 November 1820, and had a brother, Thomas. After arriving in London about 1850, he speculated in the music-hall business at the same time that other enterprising men, most notably Charles Morton, proprietor of The Canterbury, built the first of a series of great music-halls and thereby ushered in an important era in Britain's entertainment history. Wilton founded Wilton's Music Hall (known affectionately as the Old Mahogany Bar) at Grace's Alley, Wellclose Square, in the East End of London in 1850. Once a public house, it was converted into a music room in the late 1830s, known as the Prince of Denmark, the reputation of which was said to have been low because it was then &#145;frequented by a very rough, stormy class of seafaring customer&#146;  (Honri, 23). But during Wilton's tenure at the house, in the 1850s and 1860s, he transformed its clientele, which became less stormy and more respectable as it came to see the &#145;unbuttoned but orderly family entertainment&#146; consisting of acrobatics, song, and comedy  (Bratton, 93). Indeed, one contemporary grudgingly complimented the hall by saying, &#145;each Jack Tar may be seen sitting with his pipe and pot witnessing the dramatic performances not very artistic but really, on the score of morality, not so objectionable as what I have seen applauded by an Adelphi audience or patronized by the upper classes at her Majesty's theatre&#146;  (Ritchie, 83).<br>
<br>In the period that Wilton consolidated the success of his music hall, he bought Dr Johnson's Hotel, Supper and Concert Room off Fleet Street. He also renovated Wilton's Music Hall and reopened it on 28 March 1859, at a cost of &pound;20,000, in order &#145;to accommodate the great influx of visitors who nightly were in the habit of congregating at his well-conducted concerts&#146;  (Cheshire, 24&#150;5). In its renovated state, it had the capacity to hold 1500 spectators. He rebuilt his theatre with the idea that &#145;the poor [ought to be treated] the same as the rich&#146; and therefore have the same right to rational recreation  (Honri, 33). His increased investment was accompanied by a desire to defend not only his own capital interest but that belonging to other music-hall proprietors as well. Thus he founded the London Music Hall Protection Society in the early 1860s. This was a body designed to counter attacks made against the halls by theatre managers, who viewed music-halls as a threat to the theatre business, by agents who charged unreasonable rates of commission, and by the temperance lobby.<br>
<br>Although Wilton retired from the management of his hall in October 1868 after an eighteen-year tenure, his entrepreneurial days were not over. Perhaps a reflection of the fluidity with which investors and their money moved in mid-Victorian London, he went from the music-hall to the restaurant business. The leap was not so great, however, considering that at both his concert venues customers ate and drank. He established a successful restaurant at 20 Coventry Street, Piccadilly. The restaurant, he wrote, &#145;besides dining rooms, etc. &hellip; carries a wine and spirit licence &hellip; and will purvey first class confectionery too &hellip; since I have engaged a number of pastry cooks&#146;  (Honri, 76), a description suggestive of a new era of eating out in London.<br>
<br>Had his wife, Ellen, not prompted him to write a diary of his experiences in the music-hall business, many of the details of Wilton's professional life would be unknown. He died at his residence, 18 Nottinghill Terrace, London, on 25 August 1881 of &#145;diabetes exhaustion&#146;.<br>
