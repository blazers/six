<span class="headword">Lindsay <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bourke]</span>,  Norah Mary Madeleine</span>  (1873&#150;1948), <span class="occ">gardener</span>, the second child of Major the Hon. Edward Roden Bourke (1835&#150;1907), and his wife, Emma Mary Augusta Hatch (1853&#150;1935), was born in India in April 1873. The family, with three children under three years, returned to London in the following year, to live in a house in Montagu Square, and then at 25 Great Cumberland Place. Here Norah Bourke was educated by governesses and made her d&eacute;but in society, becoming celebrated for her beauty and her musical skill, especially her piano-playing. On 27 April 1895 she married a dashing soldier, Henry Edith Arthur Lindsay, the 29-year-old grandson of the twenty-fifth earl of Crawford and the younger brother of Violet Lindsay (1856&#150;1937) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49527/', "Manners, (Marion Margaret) Violet, duchess of Rutland")</script>], a talented artist and the &#145;angel of the Souls&#146;. The Lindsays were given, as a wedding present from a family friend, Lord Wantage, the manor house at Sutton Courtenay, on the banks of the Thames in Oxfordshire. Their children, Nancy Robina Winifred and David Ludovic Peter, were born in 1896 and 1900 respectively; soon after Norah Lindsay became interested in her garden. She was a romantic figure in enormous hats tied with chiffon and long pale dresses draped with lovely pearls, but she was also a seriously knowledgeable gardener, learning from practical work pruning, planting, and tying. The long, low, and romantic old manor house looked out onto two large garden &#145;rooms&#146;, the Long Garden and the Persian (or Jewel) Garden, side by side but screened from each other by high walls, covered in luxuriant roses, jasmines, and clematis. In a gardening society enthralled by Gertrude Jekyll's long drifts of single kinds of plants, Norah Lindsay led a revolt: allowing self-set seedlings to stay, she created bounteous jungles of mixed flowers, all contained and controlled by elephantine but low box hedges and carefully clipped yew sentinels.<br>
<br>During the First World War Colonel Lindsay worked with the Red Cross; subsequently he used his taste and knowledge of antique furniture to become a peripatetic dealer and adviser, apparently returning to the manor house only on rare occasions. Mrs Lindsay refined her garden in the 1920s, adding a wild garden beside the river. It was described in detail in <span class="italic">Country Life</span> magazine on 16 May 1931, in a piece which she herself wrote, a privilege rarely accorded to owners. Advised by her friend Nancy Astor, she began to charge for garden consultancy among rich friends: she inaugurated this professional career by &#145;dressing&#146; the Astors' gardens at Cliveden for Ascot house parties, and arranging planting schemes for country house owners including Philip Sassoon at Port Lympne and Trent Park, Philip Lothian at Blickling Hall, and the Russells at Mottisfont Abbey. Her skill became legendary, and was admired by Christopher Hussey and jealously regarded by Vita Sackville West. In particular, her use of colour, including one-colour gardens or strident contrasts, and her way of constructing a mounded or pyramidal form on perfectly flat land, commanded applause. Her greatest gardening friendship was during the 1930s with Lawrence Johnston: their shared gardening tastes brought the planting of Johnston's garden at Hidcote Manor to its best just at the beginning of the Second World War. By the end of the war Johnston wished to retire to his garden in France and leave Hidcote Manor to Mrs Lindsay, who was now forced to sell the manor house at Sutton Courtenay, following her husband's death in 1939. When Norah Lindsay died suddenly on 20 June 1948, at her London home, Flat 410, Carrington House, Hertford Street, Westminster, Hidcote Manor was taken over by the National Trust; Sutton Courtenay was purchased by David Astor.<br>
