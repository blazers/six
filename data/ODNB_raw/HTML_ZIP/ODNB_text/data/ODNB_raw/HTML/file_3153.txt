<span class="headword">Brabazon, Sir  Roger</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1247?, <em>d.</em> 1317), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was the son of William le Brabazon and his wife, Amice, and may have been born at Mowsley in Leicestershire. Between 1275 and 1289 he was in the service of Edward I's brother, Edmund of Lancaster, regularly acting as his attorney in the making of final concords and doing other kinds of legal business for him. It was at Edmund's request that he received his first judicial commissions in 1285, 1287, and 1288. These were to inquire into wrongdoing by Edmund's other bailiffs and stewards in various counties, and into poaching in Edmund's parks, and to hold eyres in Edmund's forests in Lancashire and Yorkshire. When Ralph Hengham and William Saham were removed from the court of king's bench, probably at the end of Hilary term 1290, after being convicted of official misconduct, Brabazon joined the court as a junior justice.<br>
<br>During 1291&#150;2 Brabazon played a prominent role in the hearing of the &#145;great cause&#146;, on Edward's behalf requiring the Scots to acknowledge Edward's overlordship over Scotland at the initial meeting at Norham in May 1291; acting as one of Edward's auditors; pronouncing Edward's final judgment, which awarded the Scottish throne to Balliol in December 1292; and defending Edward's right to hear appeals from Scotland, against the actions of his erstwhile deputies there, in England a few days later. He also played a role in the preparation of the tendentious &#145;official&#146; notarial record of part of these proceedings made by Master John of Caen. When Gilbert of Thornton died in late August 1295 Brabazon replaced him as chief justice of king's bench. He retained the chief justiceship for over twenty years, until his retirement on grounds of age and ill health on 23 February 1316.<br>
<br>Roger Brabazon married Beatrice, the widow of William of Kilby, between 1281 and 1284. Beatrice was one of two daughters of Warin of Bassingbourn and his wife, Albreda. Through her mother Beatrice was coheir to Henry Biset with her sister Constance, the wife of Walter Bek, and from him Beatrice inherited the manor of West Allington in Lincolnshire. Brabazon and his wife subsequently exchanged this manor for the lands allotted to Constance on the division of the Biset inheritance, including East Bridgford in Nottinghamshire. The two sisters were also coheirs to the lands held by their uncle John of Sproxton at Coleby in Lincolnshire and at Sproxton and elsewhere in Leicestershire. Brabazon probably himself inherited lands at Mowsley in Leicestershire and Great Rollright in Oxfordshire. His main property acquisitions were at Garthorpe in Leicestershire (close to Sproxton) and Sibbertoft in Northamptonshire, just across the county border from Mowsley. He also acquired a house and other properties in London near Aldersgate.<br>
<br>Brabazon died on either 13 or 14 June 1317, without surviving issue, and his lands passed to his brother Matthew. He also had a brother Thomas who was in clerical orders and on whom he settled property. The John Brabazon who died <i>c</i>.1302 was probably also a brother. This John was probably the father of the Roger Brabazon junior, or Roger Brabazon clerk, who is once described as Roger the judge's nephew, and who like his uncle was in the service of Edmund of Lancaster (and his wife, Blanche), as also of the Master John Brabazon who was one of Roger's executors. Roger the elder's wife, Beatrice, had died by 1304, and after her death he granted lands to the Lincolnshire Premonstratensian house at Newbo to establish a chantry for her as well as for himself. Shortly before his own death, Brabazon also endowed a chantry in Westminster Abbey to pray for his own soul and for the souls of his erstwhile patron Edmund of Lancaster and Edmund's wife, Blanche. He was buried in St Paul's Cathedral, not far from his London home, which was sold by his executors to another notable royal judge, Hervey Staunton.<br>
