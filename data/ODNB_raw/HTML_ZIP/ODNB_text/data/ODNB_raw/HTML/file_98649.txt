<span class="headword">Francis,  Frederick William <span class="st"> [Freddie]</span></span>  (1917&#150;2007), <span class="occ">cinematographer and film director</span>, was born on 22 December 1917 at 32 Offord Road, Islington, London, the son of Frederick William Francis, railway worker, and later commission agent, and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilkins. About the age of thirteen he developed an interest in photography, and when he left school at sixteen he was apprenticed to a stills photographer. However, a visit to a film studio ignited a passion for film-making and he took a job as clapper boy at British International Pictures at a time when British cinema was experiencing one of its periodic booms. He slowly worked his way up through the camera department, and on the eve of the Second World War was already an experienced camera assistant, recently having served on Carol Reed's acclaimed <span class="italic">The Stars Look Down</span> (1940).<br>
<br>Francis spent seven years in the army, gaining considerable experience with the army kinematograph unit, making training and propaganda films. On 12 May 1940, at St Luke's Church, Islington, he married Gladys Florence Dorrell (<i>b</i>. 1919), daughter of William James Dorrell, caterer. They had a son, but the marriage ended in 1961. After the war Francis re-entered the British film industry when it was once more in an optimistic mood, his first assignment being second-unit photography on <span class="italic">The Macomber Affair</span> (1947). He was fortunate, from the late 1940s onwards, to serve as camera operator for two of the industry's leading cinematographers. He assisted Christopher Challis in the shooting of Michael Powell's <span class="italic">The Small Back Room</span> (1949), <span class="italic">The Elusive Pimpernel</span> (1950), <span class="italic">Gone to Earth</span> (1950), and <span class="italic">The Tales of Hoffman</span> (1951), and then worked with Oswald Morris on the John Huston pictures <span class="italic">Moulin Rouge</span> (1952) and <span class="italic">Beat the Devil</span> (1953). Francis later acknowledged the significance of this experience and the opportunity to work with two such adventurous directors. The demanding Huston worked Francis to near death on the difficult production of <span class="italic">Moby Dick</span> (1956).<br>
<br>With ambitions beyond simply operating a camera, Francis accepted the opportunity to serve as director of photography on <span class="italic">A Hill in Korea</span> (1956), directed by Julian Aymes. He built a reputation on some modest productions, including Joseph Losey's <span class="italic">Time without Pity</span> (1957), and quickly established himself as a leading cinematographer, especially with his trend-setting work in black and white on the &#145;new wave&#146; dramas <span class="italic">Room at the Top</span> (1959) and <span class="italic">Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</span> (1960). He then extended his range to two period dramas shot in black and white Cinemascope, winning an Oscar for his stunning visual treatment of D. H. Lawrence's <span class="italic">Sons and Lovers</span> (1960), while brilliantly evoking the chilling atmosphere of <span class="italic">The Innocents</span> (1961), based on the celebrated novella by Henry James. In the latter film Francis captured a remarkable intimacy within the widescreen frame and his work on this production ranked among the cinematographer's own proudest achievements. On 20 April 1963 Francis married Pamela Anne Mann (<i>b</i>. 1927), a script supervisor, and daughter of Raymond Claude Mortlake Mann, proprietor of a finance company. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Francis's ambition led him to directing, and in this capacity he worked on three minor films in 1962: the uninspired comedy <span class="italic">Two and Two Make Six</span>, the low-budget horror <span class="italic">The Brain</span>, and some additional scenes for <span class="italic">Day of the Triffids</span>, a production that had fallen into trouble. It was with his success on his fourth film, <span class="italic">Paranoiac</span> (1963), that he was unrewardingly typecast in the modestly budgeted horror film. He worked extensively for the leading production companies in the genre, contributing Dracula and Frankenstein tales to the lucrative cycle of Gothic horrors produced at Hammer, and varied shockers for its rival Amicus. However, his best work at Hammer was a series of contemporary psychological thrillers made in the wake of Hitchcock's <span class="italic">Psycho</span> (1960), which began with <span class="italic">Paranoiac</span> in 1963 and included <span class="italic">Nightmare</span> (1964) and <span class="italic">Hysteria</span> (1965); while his most influential productions at Amicus were a cycle of anthology horror stories, including <span class="italic">Dr Terror's House of Horrors</span> (1965), <span class="italic">Torture Garden</span> (1967), and <span class="italic">Tales from the Crypt</span> (1972), films that later acquired cult status. He worked regularly with the horror star Peter Cushing, for whom he developed a great admiration, and also with his son from his first marriage, Kevin, who had formed Tyburn Pictures and produced <span class="italic">The Ghoul</span> (1975) and <span class="italic">Legend of the Werewolf</span> (1975). But Francis was essentially unhappy within the limitations of genre film-making. Too often he was shackled to intractable material and unsympathetic producers, and had to face the professional humiliation of seeing his name attached to such &#145;stinkers&#146; as <span class="italic">The Deadly Bees</span> (1967), <span class="italic">Trog</span> (1970), and <span class="italic">Vampire Happening</span> (1971). He was greatly disappointed when his own cherished production, the perverse black satire on class and the family, <span class="italic">Mumsy, Nanny, Sonny and Girly</span> (1970), confused audiences and critics, and flopped. During this period he returned only once to the camera, shooting the moody <span class="italic">Night Must Fall</span> (1964) as a favour to its director, Karel Reisz.<br>
<br>In the mid-1970s the low-to-medium budget horror film lost its market and Francis himself became disenchanted with the genre:<blockquote>I used to get invited to all these horror film festivals, and I'd start talking about the directors I most admire, the Billy Wilders and the William Wylers, and they didn't know who I was talking about &hellip; And I suddenly realised that most of these people were only interested in horror&#151;not just horror films, but horror pure and simple. Well, you know, that wasn't for me. I'm not a weirdo at all. (<span class="italic">Sight and Sound</span>, Nov 1992)</blockquote>Francis gave up directing for a number of years, but was eventually lured back into a highly successful second career as a leading lighting cameraman in Britain and Hollywood. The opportunity arose when the American director David Lynch wanted to shoot <span class="italic">The Elephant Man</span> (1980) in black and white, and Francis was approached for his experience and expertise in what was rapidly becoming a lost art. It proved the last major monochrome film made in Britain. He shot two further productions for the idiosyncratic Lynch, <span class="italic">Dune</span> (1984) and <span class="italic">The Straight Story</span> (1999), the final picture on which Francis worked. Other significant productions included <span class="italic">The French Lieutenant's Woman</span> (1981), which reunited Francis with Karel Reisz, and Martin Scorsese's remake of <span class="italic">Cape Fear</span> (1991), where the director relied on the cameraman's developed sense of the Gothic. Francis won a second Oscar for his work on the American Civil War epic <span class="italic">Glory</span> (1989), making him the only British cinematographer to pick up Academy awards for both black-and-white and colour cinematography. In 1997 he received the lifetime achievement award of the British Society of Cinematographers, and the following year was granted the prestigious international award of the American Society of Cinematographers. He never lost the ambition to direct and gratefully accepted the opportunity to lead the production of <span class="italic">The Doctor and the Devils</span> (1985), a strong moral tale of grave robbing that he had harboured for a number of years; however, it was not a success, possibly the victim of a producer's tinkering to raise the requisite horror levels.<br>
<br>Francis also worked regularly as a director in television, contributing to such hit series as <span class="italic">The Saint</span>, <span class="italic">Man in a Suitcase</span>, and <span class="italic">The Champions</span> in the 1960s, and supplementing dwindling feature assignments in the 1970s with work on <span class="italic">The Adventures of Black Beauty</span> and <span class="italic">Star Maidens</span>. Late in his career, and as a personal tribute, he photographed a television documentary on his friend Peter Cushing. In time the best of his own horror films acquired the status of classics of the genre. The films offered a pronounced compositional sense, incorporated long graceful camera movements, and managed a visual richness that belied their limited budgets, raising them alongside the very best of horror film production in Britain at the time. He died of complications arising from bronchopneumonia at the Atfield House nursing home, St John's Road, Isleworth, London, on 17 March 2007; he was survived by his wife Pamela and his three children.<br>
