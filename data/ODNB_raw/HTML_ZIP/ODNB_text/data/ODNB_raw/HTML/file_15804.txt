<span class="headword">Koehler,  George Frederick</span>  (1758&#150;1800), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 14 January 1758, the only child of George Frederick Koehler (1732&#150;1763), a bombardier in the Royal Artillery and a native of Frankfurt am Main, Germany, who had emigrated to England in 1753, and his English wife, Elizabeth (Betty) Dean, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Haley (<i>d</i>. 1793). In 1758 Koehler senior was given a Bengal cadetship and sailed to India; he was promoted second lieutenant, Bengal artillery, in October 1761 and was killed on 12 August 1763 at the battle of Gheria. The infant Koehler was baptized at Woolwich, Kent, on 7 May 1758. He was raised on the proceeds of the &pound;2000 (presumably from loot or trade) which his father had left to him and his mother and attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, as a private student. In his fortifications examination on 15 December 1779 he submitted &#145;the completest series of drawings ever produced at the Academy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Records of the Royal Military Academy</span>, 26), and as a consequence was offered, on 20 January 1780, a second lieutenantcy in the Royal Artillery.<br>
<br>In 1781 Koehler sailed with Admiral Darby's relief fleet to the besieged fortress of Gibraltar. There he soon gained the confidence of the governor, General George Augustus Eliott, who appointed him his aide-de-camp and assistant engineer. After the famous sortie against the Spanish lines of 26&#150;7 November 1781, Eliott presented Koehler with his own sword in recognition of his conduct. Koehler also demonstrated his technical expertise by inventing a gun carriage which allowed the gun barrel to be depressed to an angle of 70&deg;, which enabled accurate counter-battery fire against the Franco-Spanish siege cannon, sited far below the Rock. At the first trial, on 15 February 1782, twenty-eight shots out of thirty fired took effect in one traverse of the San Carlos battery, at a distance of 1400 yards. Koehler's accomplished drawings of the siege were also well regarded: Eliott sent some to London with his dispatches; others were later published as engravings by T. Malton.<br>
<br>Once the defence of Gibraltar had been brought to a successful conclusion, Koehler used a twelve-month passport granted him by Eliott and travelled in Italy and Germany, returning to England in October 1784. His close connection with General Eliott (later Lord Heathfield) continued in the following years. In 1789 Koehler accompanied him on a tour of Germany and the Low Countries. When the Brabant rebellion broke out soon after, Heathfield's warm endorsement of Koehler's abilities was remembered, and in December 1789 Count Dillon, acting for the Belgian Congress, asked Koehler (although still only a first lieutenant) to be colonel commandant of its artillery. In the event, he also received the rank of major-general. It was a measure of his creditable performance as a commander of horse and foot as well as of artillery that when, in November 1790, the Austrians crossed the Meuse and approached Brussels, the congress, desperate to stave off defeat, appointed Koehler general commandant of its entire army. But by then the situation was irretrievable and, after the fall of the Belgian republic, Koehler retired to England.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1791, in the wake of the Ochakov crisis, the British government sent Koehler to survey the defences of European Turkey. He remained there two years. On his return he was offered the post of deputy quartermaster-general at Toulon (then occupied by the British at the invitation of the Toulon anti-Jacobins), which entailed his promotion from brevet captain to brevet major (October 1793). Koehler, however, arrived only in time to play a role in the port's evacuation, commanding the artillery at Fort La Malg&egrave;re so as to cover the British withdrawal and then spiking the guns. He was sent afterwards to Corsica with Sir Gilbert Elliot and Lieutenant-Colonel John Moore to reconnoitre the French defences (14&#150;20 January 1794). Their report favoured a British attack, and Koehler remained ashore to liaise with General Paoli, the Corsican resistance leader, pending the fleet's arrival. In the operations which followed, Koehler played his part in the capture of San Fiorenzo but became disillusioned by the indecision of his commanders before Bastia, the chief French garrison. At the end of March 1794, claiming pressing personal affairs, he returned to England. He married, on 30 June 1794, Ann Pass (1771&#150;1800), of St Marylebone, Westminster. They set up home at Etchilhampton, near Devizes, Wiltshire.<br>
<br>Koehler's unscheduled return to England was not approved by the military authorities. He was even rebuked by his patron, the master-general of the ordnance, the duke of Richmond. Koehler's dissatisfaction increased. Although now a captain-lieutenant of artillery and (since 12 April 1794) a brevet lieutenant-colonel, he felt undervalued. In early 1795 he would have accepted an offer to enter the Turkish service had not the government, worried by the possibility of an adverse Russian reaction, expressed its reservations. For the next three years he occupied staff positions at home as assistant quartermaster-general of the southern and north-eastern districts successively. He was promoted captain of artillery on 9 December 1796.<br>
<br>Koehler's chance of accelerated advancement came when, in 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Egypt and the British government, anxious to help the Turks expel the French, decided to send a military mission, including artillery, stores, and 100 personnel, to Constantinople. With his knowledge of Turkey, Koehler was an obvious choice to take command. Having stipulated that, to reflect his status, he must have the local and temporary rank of brigadier-general (8 November 1798), the permanent rank of colonel (gazetted 1 January 1800), and remuneration of &pound;1000 per annum, Koehler left England with the officers of his party in December 1798 and travelled overland to Constantinople, where he arrived in March 1799. Once he was there the Turks asked him to inspect the defences of the Dardanelles. When, in September, they tried to get him to repeat the exercise, Koehler realized that the Turks were not keen to have him join their army in Syria. Indeed, rather than have Koehler to hand urging them to fight, the Turks preferred to negotiate a French withdrawal from Egypt, a policy in which Britain's acting minister at Constantinople, Spencer Smith, and his brother Commodore Sidney Smith, the hero of Acre, were actively colluding. To this end both brothers intrigued against Koehler. The arrival in November of the new ambassador, Lord Elgin, eventually secured permission for Koehler to go to the Turkish army at Jaffa; but Elgin implied that Koehler, whose exaggerated pretensions irritated his hosts, had contributed to his own difficulties: &#145;General Koehler &hellip; claims to himself the respect paid to a Bonaparte or a Suvorov&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fortescue MSS</span>, 6.91).<br>
<br>Koehler arrived at Jaffa in July 1800, after undertaking a mission to Cyprus. As he discovered, the battleworthiness of the Turkish army left much to be desired: he believed 2000 European troops to be the match of 15,000 Turks. In October, during a respite from his duties, Koehler and his wife, who had accompanied him to the East, visited Jerusalem. Shortly after their return, however, there was an outbreak of plague in the Turkish camp at Jaffa. First his wife died, and then, fifteen days later, on 29 December 1800, Koehler himself succumbed. He was buried at Jaffa the next day.<br>
<br>Koehler died intestate and with no known relatives. His property, valued at &pound;7842 8<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., went to the crown. In 1820 there began the protracted case of <i>Bauer v. Mitford</i>, by which Koehler's German relatives attempted to establish their kinship. The proceedings passed to the court of chancery, and in 1859 judgment was delivered in the family's favour. Following the rejection of the crown's appeal by the House of Lords on 24 July 1861, the original value of Koehler's estate, together with &pound;14,429 12<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. interest, was paid to the descendants of Koehler's paternal uncles.<br>
