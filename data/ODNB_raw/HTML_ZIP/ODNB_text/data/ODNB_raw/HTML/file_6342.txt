<span class="headword">Bacon,  Jane</span>, Lady Bacon <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Jane Meautys; <em>other married name </em>Jane Cornwallis, Lady Cornwallis]</span>  (1580/81&#150;1659), <span class="occ">letter-writer</span>, was the daughter of Hercules Meautys of West Ham, Essex, and Philippe, daughter of Richard Cooke of Gidea Hall, Essex. Her grandfather Sir Peter Meautys, who was descended from an ancient French family which had come from Normandy with Henry VII, was made ambassador to France by Henry VIII.<br>
<br>Jane is known mainly through a collection of correspondence written to her by family and friends in the period 1613&#150;44 and lodged in the Braybrooke archives at Essex Record Office (D/DBy C11&#150;27). 200 of these letters were transcribed and edited by Richard Neville, third Baron Braybrooke (1783&#150;1858), and published anonymously in 1842 as <span class="italic">The Private Correspondence of Jane, Lady Cornwallis, 1613&#150;1644</span>.<br>
<br>In the first quarter of 1609 Jane married, as his second wife, Sir William Cornwallis (<i>d</i>. 1611) of Brome, Suffolk, eldest son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6343/', "Sir Thomas Cornwallis (1518/19&#150;1604)")</script>, sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk. Sir William died in 1611, when Frederick, his and Jane's only child, was just one year and three days old, leaving Jane a substantial fortune and entitlement to the profits of the manors of Brome, Oakley, Stuston, Thrandeston, and Palgrave. Previously she had had settled upon her the manor of Wilton in the North Riding of Yorkshire, with lands in several adjoining parishes. Her husband's will, unusually for the time, stipulated that she alone would become legal guardian of their son and heir, with full responsibility for his upbringing, education, and training. Jane took on this role with serious and protective intent.<br>
<br>Being young and richly endowed Lady Cornwallis had several suitors, although she was in no particular hurry to remarry. In early 1613 negotiations began for a union with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/999/', "Nathaniel Bacon (1585&#150;1627)")</script>, amateur painter and youngest son of twelve children of Sir Nicholas Bacon of Redgrave in Suffolk, premier baronet of England, and Anne Thornage; the courtship's delicate negotiations are recorded in Jane's published correspondence, which includes several letters from her future husband. Jane was evidently quite competent in managing her own affairs and showed herself an excellent woman of business. Her primary concern was to protect her son's inheritance but she also needed assurance that she was being sought for herself and not merely for her fortune. She insisted that Nathaniel both relinquish all claim to the Cornwallis estate and increase his own settlement, making proper provision for her in the event of his death. She seems to have driven a hard bargain for the Bacons finally agreed to settle the family estate at Culford in Suffolk, which by rights should have gone to the eldest son, Edmund.<br>
<br>The marriage took place quietly in the spring of 1614 and Jane's brother, Sir Thomas Meautys, wrote that he did not hear about it until the following winter, being with the forces of the prince of Orange in the Low Countries. Jane kept the Cornwallis name until her second husband was made knight of the Bath at the coronation of Charles I in 1626, after which time she is referred to in the letters as Lady Bacon.<br>
<br>Lady Bacon's preference was for the peaceful life of the country, and she only reluctantly visited London, much to the regret, as is revealed in the correspondence, of her friends in the city, who included Lucy Russell, countess of Bedford (1581&#150;1627). The letters suggest that Lady Bacon must have been unwell in her confinements and was at times of a melancholic disposition. She was, however, exceedingly generous to her family and friends, and she particularly supported her brother and sister-in-law, whose pleading letters from abroad give some indication of the hardships endured at the time by soldiers' wives. Moreover she became guardian of her nephew as well as of her son Frederick's children.<br>
<br>There are few letters written by Lady Bacon herself but the reader gets to know her well through the letters she received, including those from King Charles and Queen Henrietta Maria. Altogether her correspondence provides not only a lively and informative insight into her family and social relations but also illuminates her more public concerns, such as the war in Europe and the conflict between king and parliament.<br>
<br>In addition to Frederick, Jane had three children from her second marriage: Anne, born 1615, Nicholas, born 1617, and Jane, who was born in February 1624 (she died at the age of three). About 1637 Anne married her mother's cousin, Thomas Meautys (<i>d</i>. 1649), the secretary and close confidant of Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam. Nicholas remained unmarried.<br>
<br>On the death of her husband in 1627 Lady Bacon inherited his estate; she subsequently arranged for the erection of his bust, in white marble within an oval, in the chancel of Culford church. She died on 8 May 1659, at the age of seventy-eight, and was buried in the chancel of Culford church, where her Cornwallis family monument, executed by Thomas Stanton, is to be found. She was succeeded by her eldest son, Frederick, whose portrait is in the picture gallery at Audley End, Essex, with those of his wife and his son Charles. A full-length portrait, formerly at Audley End and now in a private collection, is inscribed &#145;Jane, Lady Bacon&#146; but might represent her mother-in-law, Anne, Lady Bacon.<br>
