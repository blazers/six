<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Burton,  Richard</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Richard Walter Jenkins]</span>  (1925&#150;1984), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 10 November 1925 at Pont-rhyd-y-fen, a village in the Afan valley, 4 miles from Port Talbot, the sixth son and twelfth of the thirteen children of Richard Jenkins, a miner, and his wife, Edith Maud Thomas, who had been a barmaid. His mother died in October 1927, and he was brought up by his eldest sister, Cecilia, and her husband, Elfed James. He was often unhappy and ill at ease, and at fourteen he wrote in his diary &#145;I am sure that wherever I go, I will not be wanted&#146;  (Bragg, 57). The family spoke both Welsh and English, and Richard remained fluent in Welsh throughout his life. He was educated at the eastern primary school, Port Talbot, and at Port Talbot secondary school. At fifteen he left school and went to work in the men's outfitting department of the local co-operative store. Bored, he joined a youth club and experienced the exhilaration of amateur dramatics. He was already a gifted and enthusiastic rugby player, with a reputation as a fearless, if dirty, player whose vindictiveness on the field could be boundless. He was a brawler, and it was to the injuries he sustained in one particularly bruising street fight that he traced the spinal problems that in later life were to cause him great pain. In appearance, the young Richard Jenkins was of medium height, with fine, wide eyes. Sturdily built, he had the body of a rugby half-back, long and solid in the trunk with short legs. He was troubled by boils and his skin was pitted by acne. Nevertheless, he was considered extremely attractive. Convinced that in education lay escape from his job, he focused all his charm on Philip Burton, a teacher at Port Talbot secondary school and an instructor in the local Air Training Corps which Richard had joined, and in September 1941 he went back to school. Burton became Richie Jenkins's legal guardian, and in 1943 Jenkins legally renounced his own surname to become Richard Burton.<br>
<br>Recognizing his ward's abilities, Philip Burton pointed Richard towards a career as an actor, and arranged an audition for him in Cardiff with the actor and dramatist Emlyn Williams. Richard Burton made his d&eacute;but as Glan in Williams's comedy <span class="italic">The Druid's Rest</span> at the Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool, in November 1943, making his first London appearance in the same part at the St Martin's Theatre on 26 January 1944. When the play closed, he was called up by the RAF, and spent six months on a special wartime course at Exeter College, Oxford, where he read English in addition to undergoing RAF training. His tutor, Nevill Coghill, a gifted amateur director, was captivated by him. Casting Burton as Angelo in his Oxford University Dramatic Society production of <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span>, Coghill proclaimed him &#145;a genius&#146;. Demobilized in 1947, Burton returned to the theatre, under contract to H. M. Tennent Ltd, and appeared as Mr Hicks in <span class="italic">Castle Anna</span> at the Lyric, Hammersmith, in February 1948. Later that year, while filming Emlyn Williams's <span class="italic">The Last Days of Dolwyn</span>, he met actress Sybil Williams (1929&#150;2013), the daughter of an under-manager in a coal mine at Ferndale, another Welsh mining village. They were married in 1949, and had two daughters, Kate (<i>b</i>. 1957) and Jessica (<i>b</i>. 1959).<br>
<br>In 1949, in Christopher Fry's <span class="italic">The Lady's not for Burning</span>, the stillness and simplicity that were to be Burton's trade mark attracted favourable attention, not least from his director, John Gielgud. He made his New York d&eacute;but in the same part when the production transferred there in 1950. After his Prince Hal in the Stratford upon Avon history cycle in 1951, his future was assured. Kenneth Tynan wrote of him &#145;Burton is a still, brimming pool, running disturbingly deep; at twenty-five he commands repose and can make silence garrulous&#146;  (Gielgud, 302). He joined the Old Vic in 1953 to play Hamlet for the first time, and remained with the company until 1956. His beautifully modulated voice and controlled physical presence created an impression of sensitivity combined with a startling virility. In 1955 his Henry V won him the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> best actor award. When he alternated the roles of Iago and Othello with John Neville in 1956, his reputation as the most exciting classical actor of his generation looked unassailable. Burton was notorious for his romantic exploits off the stage. He also had a reputation as both a compelling story-teller in the Welsh tradition, and as a fierce drinker. Asked where his ambition lay next&#151;Macbeth perhaps, or Lear?&#151;no one took his reply seriously: &#145;I want to be a millionaire&#146;. However, when the Old Vic season finished, he settled in Switzerland; he would never appear on the London stage again.<br>
<br>Burton's first Hollywood film had been <span class="italic">My Cousin Rachel</span> (1953), a version of the Daphne du Maurier story, in which he played opposite Olivia de Havilland. It brought him the first of his seven Academy award nominations (he never won an Oscar), and brought him the coveted main role in the biblical drama <span class="italic">The Robe</span> (1953). His films in this period included <span class="italic">The Desert Rats</span> (1953) and a version of John Osborne's play <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span> (1959). In 1960 he played King Arthur in the Lerner and Loewe musical <span class="italic">Camelot</span> in New York, for which he received the New York drama critics' award in 1961 for the best performance in a musical. In 1961 he flew to Rome to play Mark Anthony in the film <span class="italic">Cleopatra</span>, which also starred <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/103682/', "Elizabeth Taylor (1932&#150;2011)")</script>, the English-born daughter of Francis Taylor, art dealer, who had moved to America on the outbreak of the Second World War. Within a few months, Burton had separated from his wife. The film, one of the most expensive ever made, met with critical disdain.<br>
<br>During the next thirteen years, Burton made over twenty films, including <span class="italic">The Comedians</span> (1967), <span class="italic">Where Eagles Dare</span> (1969), and <span class="italic">Bluebeard</span> (1972), few of which pleased him or the critics, but in the John le Carr&eacute; thriller <span class="italic">The Spy who Came in from the Cold</span> (1965) he was superb, and his performance opposite Elizabeth Taylor in Edward Albee's <span class="italic">Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</span> (1966) was justifiably acclaimed; both Burton and Taylor were nominated for Academy awards, Taylor winning the Oscar. They had been married in Canada in 1964 after Burton's divorce was finalized. The romance had been conducted under intense press scrutiny; their 1963 film, <span class="italic">The VIPs</span>, exploited public interest in their real-life affair. Burton was Taylor's fifth husband. She had two sons and a daughter from previous marriages; together they adopted another daughter.<br>
<br>In April 1964 Burton opened as Hamlet at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in New York, directed by John Gielgud. The controversial production ran for seventeen weeks, to mixed critical acclaim and immense box-office success. A film of the live performance was made, and although Burton ordered all the prints to be destroyed, one was discovered after his death. In 1966 he returned to Oxford to raise money for the university dramatic society, appearing in the title role in Marlowe's <span class="italic">Dr Faustus</span> with Elizabeth Taylor as Helen of Troy. They gave their services freely, but the critics savaged him. The Burton&#150;Taylor Theatre in Oxford was established as a direct result of this production. When Burton said he yearned to be an academic, an honorary fellowship was arranged at St Peter's College, Oxford.<br>
<br>Burton was appointed CBE in 1970. His drinking was now addictive, and in 1974 his marriage to Elizabeth Taylor was dissolved; they remarried a year later in Botswana, and divorced again in 1976. Burton married Susan Hunt, the daughter of Frederick Miller and former wife of racing driver James Hunt in 1976, while he was playing in Peter Shaffer's <span class="italic">Equus</span> on Broadway. <span class="italic">Equus</span> impressed the critics, and was filmed. He continued to make films, most of them routine, such as <span class="italic">Exorcist II: the Heretic</span> (1977) and <span class="italic">The Wild Geese</span> (1978). In 1980 he recreated his role of King Arthur on tour in <span class="italic">Camelot</span>. The back problems which had long troubled him intensified: his right arm hung useless at his side, and he was unable to raise the left above his shoulder. Only his closest intimates knew that the stillness on stage that had always been his trade mark was now the stillness of disability. Not until he collapsed in Los Angeles could he be persuaded to undergo surgery on his spine. Fighting a losing battle with alcoholism, he returned to Switzerland to convalesce. His marriage was dissolved in 1982 while he was filming <span class="italic">Wagner</span>, and in 1983 he married Sally Hay, a continuity girl he had met on the film set. She was the daughter of Jack Hay, motoring correspondent for the <span class="italic">Birmingham Post</span>. In the television mini-series <span class="italic">Ellis Island</span> (1984) Burton played the father of his real daughter, the actress Kate Burton. It would be his last work. He died of a cerebral haemorrhage on 5 August 1984 in hospital in Geneva, and was buried at Celigny, Switzerland, where he lived.<br>
<br>Richard Burton had made his first appearance in London when the theatre was dominated by actors of flamboyant lyricism, such as Michael Redgrave, John Gielgud, and Laurence Olivier. His robust sexuality had confounded and excited critical opinion, and his explosion onto the scene was unsettling. Here, for the first time in the twentieth century, was a great classical actor whose plebeian roots were unashamedly apparent. Ever since Irving, leading actors had been assiduously disguising their humble origins and insinuating themselves into the upper echelons of society: knighthoods were commonplace, soon there would be peerages. Burton was a throwback to a much older tradition, the actor as rapscallion. The tabloid press loved him, celebrating his boozy extravaganzas and his torrid personal life, and ignoring the sensitivity and erudition that lay beneath his &#145;roaring boy&#146; exterior. The new generation of British actors welcomed him too, many of them imagining that his example licensed their own attempts to express Hamlet's neuroses in the raw accents of their native dialects. They did not appreciate that, although Burton was the son of a Welsh miner (and used his native accent to great advantage in the celebrated recording, and somewhat less celebrated film, of Dylan Thomas's <span class="italic">Under Milk Wood</span>), the glorious cadences of his mature voice were the result of subordinating himself to rigorous training and discipline. Burton's obituarists deplored his failure to fulfil their expectations, but their ambitions were not necessarily his. He had done what he wanted with his life: he had achieved fame and riches, and had experienced passion. His fortune allowed him to be generous, and his largess was boundless. He retained a certain natural simplicity, and never forgot his family and roots in the small mining community in south Wales.<br>
