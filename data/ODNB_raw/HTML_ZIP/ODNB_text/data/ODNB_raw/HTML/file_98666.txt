</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Marshall, Sir  Arthur Gregory George</span>  (1903&#150;2007), <span class="occ">aviator, pilot instructor, and industrialist</span>, was born at Gregory Villa, De Freville Avenue, Chesterton, Cambridge, on 4 December 1903, the eldest of the eight children of David Gregory Marshall (1873&#150;1942), college servant, later steward of the Pitt Club, Cambridge, and independent businessman, and his wife, Maude Edmunds, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wing (1879&#150;1931). He was born thirteen days before the Wright brothers' first powered flights. In 1909 his father launched the Brunswick Motor Car Company, initially with two chauffeur-driven cars. In 1914 he renamed the business Marshall's Garage. During the First World War the garage undertook war work and David Marshall ran canteens for the army, Woolwich arsenal, and the Ministry of Munitions; he was appointed MBE for his services.<br>
<br>Arthur Marshall was educated at the Perse School, Cambridge, Tonbridge School, and Jesus College, Cambridge, where he obtained a first-class degree in engineering. Cambridge became the centre of his life, particularly in his efforts to diversify the economy of the city away from the university-centred structure that his father had known. A Cambridge blue for running, he was selected as a reserve member of the British team (which included Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell) for the 1924 Olympic games.<br>
<br>In 1926 Marshall joined his father's garage business. However, he was already an enthusiast for aviation: in 1911 he and his father watched the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> round Britain air race and in 1912 he carried petrol and oil to the army airship Beta II, which had made a precautionary landing at Cambridge near his father's garage in Jesus Lane (Beta II's engine was repaired in the Marshall workshop). Then came a visit to William Rhodes-Moorhouse's aircraft workshop and hangar at Huntingdon (Rhodes-Moorhouse, later the first airman to be awarded the Victoria Cross, had made several landings on Cambridge Commons near the Marshall garage). After the First World War the family's home on Newmarket Road was renamed Aviation Hall following his father's purchase of a war-surplus Handley Page bomber for &pound;5 and a Bessoneau canvas hangar, in which it was stored in a paddock behind the house. His first flight came in July 1919 as a joy-ride with his father in a Fairey seaplane at Brighton (there were no seat-belts so Marshall stood for part of the flight); his first commercial flight was in August 1922 when he flew to Paris in a Handley Page airliner (wicker seats for the passengers and an open cockpit for the pilots).<br>
<br>In 1928 Marshall obtained his B (private) pilot licence; the aviation journal <span class="italic">Flight</span> reported that his first solo was a &#145;splendid show&#146; and that the landing was &#145;a treat to watch&#146;  (<span class="italic">Flight</span>, 12 July 1928). In 1929 father and son established the first civilian aerodrome within the city boundaries of Cambridge in a field behind the family home. There they founded the Marshall Flying School with a de Havilland Gipsy Moth biplane and Arthur Marshall as chief instructor. The first three Marshall pupils were Norman de Bruyne (later inventor of the Redux bonding process), Bill Humble (later chief test pilot at Hawker Aircraft) and H. G. Barrington (later a test pilot at de Havilland). Later in the 1930s Peter Masefield was a Marshall pupil. At this time separate Marshall companies were incorporated to run the garage and flying school activities. Marshall qualified for his commercial pilot's licence in March 1930; he was admitted an upper freeman of the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators in 1931 and liveryman in 1958 (at his death he was by far the longest serving member of the guild; in September 2003 he delivered the guild's Sir Frederick Tymms lecture). On 22 April 1931 he married Rosemary Wynford Dimsdale (1908&#150;1988), daughter of Marcus Southwell Dimsdale, fellow of King's College, Cambridge, and granddaughter of the sixth Baron Dimsdale. She was his constant companion and staunchest supporter for the next fifty-seven adventurous and exciting years, as he later described them. They had three children, Michael, David, and Judy.<br>
<br>In 1936 the family bought land that subsequently formed the core of the Marshall aerodrome, which became Cambridge airport. Marshall was always immensely proud that the aerodrome provided the region with a fully licensed airport at no cost to central or local government. The fully engineered runway, the hangars, and other facilities were also company-funded. In February 1938 the Air Ministry established No. 22 Elementary and Reserve Flying School at Cambridge under the management of Marshall's Flying School, to train Royal Air Force aircrew; the company rapidly established the school's reputation as the country's most productive. In all over 20,000 RAF pilots, instructors, and navigators were trained by Marshall; Johnnie Johnson and Leonard Cheshire were among those who learned to fly with him. Marshall developed a revolutionary programme for training <i>ab initio</i> candidates as pilots and flying instructors; despite initial resistance Marshall persuaded the RAF in 1941 to accept his training method, which subsequently became the basis of RAF training. In 1939 Marshall and his father founded the Cambridge squadron of the Air Defence Cadet Corps, later named 104 (City of Cambridge) squadron, Air Training Corps; he served as chairman of the squadron's civilian committee from 1939 until 1976 despite the pressures of his wartime and post-war business duties, and subsequently wrote its history.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Marshall was a test pilot for his company's work, which included the repair or modification of more than 5000 military aircraft. The heaviest type in his log-book was the B17 Flying Fortress, and he was always proud of his permit to fly the Typhoon fighter&#150;bomber. During the battle of Britain, by deft management of the production schedules, he ensured that there were always available two overhauled and armed Gladiator fighters so that he, and his chief test pilot, might fly in defence of the airfield. The pair &#145;scrambled&#146; frequently but were never called upon to engage the enemy; for lack of radio their signal to return to base was seeing the Cambridge buses running again after the all-clear siren. Marshall's management style imbued his workforce with the same &#145;can-do&#146; spirit. He was appointed chairman of the Marshall companies after the death of his father in 1942.<br>
<br>In the immediate post-war years the garage business was expanded beyond its original base in Cambridge into a regional business with twenty depots throughout the south-east of England, selling cars and commercial vehicles. Aircraft skills were held together by branching out into building vehicle bodies (including those for buses) as a further diversification of Cambridge's economy and by the maintenance of commercial aircraft; then came the demands of maintaining RAF aircraft for the Berlin airlift in 1948&#150;9. In the cold-war era Marshall supported the RAF's nuclear strike force with work on the Valiant and Canberra bombers and on the Blue Steel missile. Additionally Venom jet fighters were assembled at Cambridge and ejector seats were fitted to Vampire jet training aircraft. The company also became a centre of excellence for the repair and modification of aircraft for major airlines.<br>
<br>The Marshall company was involved in practically every major post-war British aircraft project including the Concorde supersonic airliner, for which the company designed and built the droop nose and visor (Marshall secured that contract himself within hours of an invitation to join the project; he also secured for his company design authority for the task, the sole delegation of authority for structural design granted to a United Kingdom contractor for Concorde). He then demonstrated a stroke of genius when the Ministry of Defence decided in 1965 to acquire the Lockheed Hercules for the RAF. Recognizing that the Hercules fleet would require technical support, he was successful in persuading the ministry and Lockheed that the Marshall company was ideally qualified. The first Hercules landed at Cambridge in December 1966, marking the start of a continuing Hercules business with the RAF and overseas services. During the Falklands conflict in 1982 he supervised the design and installation of a flight refuelling capability into batches of RAF Hercules; the first aircraft was delivered within three weeks of a telephoned instruction to proceed. The modified type proved vital to the liberation of the islands. After the conflict the Ministry of Defence accepted Marshall's proposal to modify a batch of TriStar airliners into a long-range trooping and air refuelling role for the RAF.<br>
<br>The first contribution to space travel was made in the 1950s when, under the sponsorship of the National Research Development Corporation, Francis Thomas (Tom) Bacon developed his fuel cell at the Marshall works with the assistance of Marshall staff. Bacon recalled, &#145;I wanted a practical works atmosphere in which we could get things done &hellip; Arthur Marshall is a man who takes instant decisions and, after we had talked about it for a little while, he said &#147;Yes&#151;we'll do it.&#148; I am very glad he did&#146;  (P. Fairley, <span class="italic">Project X</span>, 1970, 120). Marshall was always proud that electrical power and drinking water generated by Bacon cells made possible the United States' Apollo programme of lunar exploration. President Nixon acknowledged that, without the cells, &#145;we wouldn't have gotten to the Moon&#146;  (K. R. Williams, &#145;Francis Thomas Bacon&#146;, <span class="italic">Memoirs FRS</span>, 39, 1994, 13). Space work continued in the 1980s with the design and build of a space sled to investigate space motion sickness on behalf of the European Space Agency. The sled was flown in the space shuttle <i>Challenger</i> for 121 orbits over seven days in 1985.<br>
<br>Marshall remained an active pilot of the corporate executive jet until 1988, having upgraded his licence ten years earlier. He retired as chairman of the Marshall Group at the end of 1989, when he was succeeded by his son Michael, who had joined the family business in 1955. Retirement was, however, a concept foreign to Marshall. Elected honorary life president by the shareholders, he moved his office to a company-owned farmhouse on the edge of the aerodrome where, seated at his father's old desk, he continued to take a keen interest in the company's well-being and in the fortunes of his wide circle of friends and acquaintances. He was able to devote more time to his charitable activities; he was an active fund-raiser for the Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund and, for many years, he was president of the Cambridge &#145;chariots of fire&#146; charity run. He was a governor of Cranfield University between 1979 and 1997.<br>
<br> Marshall was knighted in 1974; it is typical of the man that he chose for his motto the words <i>Felix qui laborat</i> (&#145;Happy is he who works&#146;), for he was known to be in his office even on Christmas day. He had been made an OBE in 1948 and a deputy lieutenant of Cambridgeshire in 1968, and served as high sheriff of Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely in 1969&#150;70. He was a member of the Air Cadet Council (1951&#150;9 and 1965&#150;76); chairman of the Aerodrome Owners Association (1964&#150;5); and a member of the Advisory Council on Technology (1967&#150;70). Among many other honours he was made an honorary member of the Royal Air Force Club (1969); an honorary old Cranwellian (1978); a companion of the Royal Aeronautical Society (1980) and of the Air League (1997), which gave him its founders' medal in 2003; an honorary fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge (1990) and of the Royal Aeronautical Society (2001); and an honorary freeman of the City of Cambridge (2004). He received honorary doctorates from Cranfield and Cambridge universities (in 1992 and 1996). In 1990 he was awarded the order of Istiqlal, first class, by King Hussein of Jordan (the country's highest award for a non-Jordanian other than a head of state).<br>
<br>A quiet, unassuming man (but a shrewd businessman whose watchwords were &#145;price, delivery, quality&#146;), Marshall took his flying club of the 1920s into supersonics and the space age, served his country well in both war and peace, and created an internationally recognized aerospace engineering company, which at the time of his death was one of the largest family-owned companies in the country. He was not active politically but he took pride in a compliment paid him by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher during a factory visit: &#145;It's men like you who should be running this country, not us politicians&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 April 2010). Marshall bore with stoicism the frailties of advancing years but he always retained an inquiring mind and unquenchable cheerfulness: he closed his autobiography, <span class="italic">The Marshall Story: a Century of Wheels and Wings</span> (1994), with the words that he had been &#145;a lucky fellow&#146;  (p. 360). He died at his home, Horseheath Lodge, Linton, Cambridgeshire, on 16 March 2007, of cerebrovascular disease. He was buried at Horseheath parish church beside his wife, Rosemary; following the committal Tiger Moth training aircraft of the Cambridge Flying Group flew past in salute. A service of thanksgiving for his life was held in 17 hangar, Cambridge airport, his last, and largest, building project at Cambridge. He was survived by his three children. He was commemorated by the Sir Arthur Marshall trophy of the Air Training Corps, established to recognize achievement by individual squadrons. Cambridge University established the Sir Arthur Marshall Institute for Aeronautics in 2001, and in 2009 established the Sir Arthur Marshall chair in sustainable urban design. The Royal Aeronautical Society established a Marshall lecture, and in 2008 unveiled an aeronautical heritage plaque in his honour at Cambridge airport. There are Sir Arthur Marshall memorial rooms at the engineering department and the athletics pavilion at Cambridge University, at Jesus College, Cambridge, and at the Imperial War Museum, Duxford. His running medals are on loan to the Hawks Club, Cambridge.<br>
