<span class="headword">Fielding,  Newton Smith Limbird</span>  (1799&#150;1856), <span class="occ">watercolour painter and lithographer</span>, was born in London and baptized on 10 March 1815 at St Pancras Old Church, the youngest son of the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9403/', "Nathan Theodore Fielding (1746/7&#150;1819)")</script> and his wife, Elizabeth (Betty), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Baker or Barker (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1806/7). Fielding had a sister, (Cleobulina) Amelia (<i>bap</i>. 1790), who was noted for her beauty. Three of his brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9399/', "(Anthony Vandyke) Copley Fielding (1787&#150;1855)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9406/', "Thales Angelo Vernet Fielding (1793&#150;1837)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9407/', "Theodore Henry Adolphus Fielding (1781&#150;1851)")</script>, are separately noticed; the fourth&#151;second in age&#151;was <a href="#cosubject_72903">Felix Ferdinand Frederick Raffael [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Newton Fielding was apprenticed to a doctor in 1815, but nevertheless first exhibited with the Society of Painters in Water Colours in that year, and again in 1818, when he abandoned his articles and joined the family business at 26 Newman Street, in the artists' quarter off Oxford Street, London. He made his reputation with watercolours of ducks, farmyard fowl, and animals, often in ponds or streams. There is a pleasing contrast between the precision with which he drew and coloured the creatures and his impressionistic rendering of their settings. Fielding was also a printmaker, working in etching, aquatint, and lithography, with especial success in the last. About 1821, the year of his first publication, <span class="italic">British Game Illustrated in Twelve Spirited Etchings</span>, he began with his brother Thales to work for the Parisian publisher Ostervald. During the following decades the brothers played an important part in the Anglo-French school of watercolourists centred on Richard Parkes Bonington and Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix, whose work they popularized through prints. In the summer of 1824 he was sketching with Bonington on the Normandy coast. From about 1827 until interrupted by the revolution of 1830, Newton ran the family atelier in Paris. In 1833 he married in London Josephine Eliza Berger, the daughter of a surgeon in Napoleon's army, and thereafter they divided their time between England and France. Of their six children Edward and Emily painted in the family manner, and the latter married a French architect, Eug&egrave;ne Colibert. In 1838 Fielding's London address was 2 Gothic Cottages, Park Village East, but in 1845 bronchitis drove him to settle permanently in Paris. Among his many French pupils were members of Louis Philippe's family. He died in Paris on 12 January 1856. His brother <a name="cosubject_72903"></a><span class="headword">Felix Ferdinand Frederick Raffael Fielding</span>  (<em>c.</em>1784&#150;1853) was a clerk in the enrolment office of the court of chancery before becoming a <span class="occ">painter</span>. He was in Carlisle from 1810 to 1811, but otherwise shared the family home in London until 1826 when he exhibited for the last time. He was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1827 and called to the bar in 1832. In 1842 he married Lady Heslerigg, daughter of Lord Wodehouse and widow of Sir T. M. Heslerigg. Thereafter he lived in her town house in Upper Brook Street.<br>
