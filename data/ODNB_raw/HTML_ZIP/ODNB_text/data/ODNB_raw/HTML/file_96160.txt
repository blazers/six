<span class="headword">Alexander,  Robert Scott <span class="st"> [Bob]</span></span>, Baron Alexander of Weedon  (1936&#150;2005), <span class="occ">barrister and banker</span>, was born on 5 September 1936 at 12B Kingsway West, Newcastle under Lyme, Staffordshire, the son of Samuel James Alexander, motor engineer and garage proprietor, and his wife, Hannah May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Trevitt, an accountant's secretary. He was privately educated at Reading School, Brighton College, and King's College, Cambridge. At Cambridge he took advantage of the flexible tripos system to switch after two years from English, under the supervision of Dadie Rylands and F. R. Leavis, to law; he was taught by Kenneth Polack, a South African research student who had just completed a pupillage in the Temple, and who diverted him from his original plan of becoming a solicitor. He obtained a 2:1. Inspired by his reading of the lives of great advocates, he studied for his professional examinations by correspondence course, and was called to the bar&#151;a route, as he once put it in a British Council lecture in Pakistan, &#145;traditionally said to be followed by many actors manqu&eacute;s&#146;&#151;by the Middle Temple in 1961 with the aid of a Harmsworth scholarship. During this time he earned extra money by sub-editing the <span class="italic">Times</span> law reports.<br>
<br>Alexander's path to the pinnacle of his profession was not negotiated in a smooth upward trajectory. At university he had indulged in amateur theatricals without notable success and he never spoke at the union. For five years he practised on the western circuit, selected by indigent defendants for the occasional dock briefs by reason of his conspicuous presence, and he only moved to Brick Court in the Temple on the recommendation of Eustace Roskill, chairman of the Hampshire quarter sessions and an enthusiastic patron of the talented young. The chambers, whose alumni included Patrick Devlin, specialized in commercial work, but in the doldrums of the mid-1960s the head, Sam Cooke, was not in favour of his tenancy. He was persuaded by the senior clerk, Ron Burley, to take a chance, a shrewd piece of advice that in the long term made Burley the doyen of the clerking fraternity. During Alexander's membership and not least because of his own growing reputation Brick Court became part of the chambers' magic circle. But he was no solitary star. His contemporaries included Nicholas Phillips, later lord chief justice, and Sydney Kentridge, the celebrated South African advocate.<br>
<br>Height is not a necessary or even a sufficient guarantee of success at the bar but it is an advantage; and at 6 feet 6 inches Alexander had the physical attributes to dominate a court. His advocacy was fluent but not florid, his voice plummy but not pungent, purged, save in his own view, of the midland accent of his youth. He was always immaculately dressed. He ascribed his forensic achievements to meticulous preparation. &#145;I would prepare my questions&#146;, he said, &#145;so that if I got the answer yes, I would go one way, and if not, another. It meant that you thought through the various permutations in advance&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 8 Nov 2005). Lord Denning described him as &#145;the best advocate of his generation&#146;  (ibid.). He took silk in 1973 after a bare twelve years.<br>
<br>Consistent with Brick Court's traditional culture Alexander practised primarily as a commercial lawyer, but he ranged beyond the traditional fields of banking, shipping, and insurance. He held briefs for government, successfully in denying trade union rights to workers at the Government Communications Headquarters in Cheltenham, unsuccessfully in trying to prevent publication of <span class="italic">Spycatcher</span>, a book written by the rogue former MI5 officer Peter Wright. His private clients included Kerry Packer, whom he helped to defeat the cricketing establishment, and Jeffrey Archer, for whom he won a famous libel trial. Archer's subsequent imprisonment for perjury in no way detracted from the praise accorded to Alexander's conduct of the case, including his cross-examination of the prostitute who claimed&#151;contrary to his client's denial&#151;to have had sexual relations with Archer. When in 1985 <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> assessed his annual earnings at &pound;1 million, Alexander publicly offered to disclose the true figure if the newspaper paid 20 per cent of the difference to charity. It declined the offer. But that his fees were at the top end of the market was indisputable, and enabled him to purchase, in addition to his London home, properties near Aylesbury, in the Dordogne, and in Spain, as well as to indulge a hobby of collecting paintings by young artists.<br>
<br>Alexander's courtroom battles with Tom Bingham, later holder of the judicial &#145;triple crown&#146;, successively master of the rolls, lord chief justice, and senior law lord, were the forensic equivalent of the pugilistic struggles of Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. Many thought he would choose&#151;as he certainly could have chosen&#151;the same judicial career as his sometime opponent, not least after his chairmanship of the Bar Council in 1985&#150;6, a post that then gave legitimate expectation of appointment to the bench. He decided, however, on a complete career change. After a two-year stint as chairman of the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, from 1987 to 1989 (during which time he was made a life peer, as Baron Alexander of Weedon, in 1988), he became chairman of National Westminster Bank from 1989 to 1999, acquiring en route non-executive directorships of the Stock Exchange, RTZ Corporation, and Total Oil. He was not the first nor last of those who spurned judicial office, but he was a notable example of a barrister, eminently <i>papabile</i>, who (like an increasing number of his generation) recognized the virtues of life beyond the law.<br>
<br>Alexander shone somewhat less as a banker than he had as a barrister, seeking to balance the interests of shareholders with stakeholders to (inevitably) the entire satisfaction of neither, and at the conclusion of his bank chairmanship he returned to practice, in 2001. His second coming was not an unalloyed success. Unwilling to retread the path of trial work he did not return to Brick Court, but became instead joint head of chambers (with Michael Crystal) at 3&#150;4 South Square, a specialist insolvency set, where his son David practised. He promoted himself as an appellate advocate, arbitrator, and expert in constitutional and international law, but although he became treasurer of the Middle Temple in 2001, the complete break he had made for a decade meant that he never wholly recovered his earlier pre-eminence. He was in any event occupied by a collection of distinguished extra-curricular posts. He once lectured on &#145;My passions, Shakespeare and cricket&#146;, which explained his chairmanship of both the Royal Shakespeare Company (2000&#150;04) and the MCC (2001&#150;4). He was, as well, a trustee of <span class="italic">The Economist</span> and of the National Gallery. His interest in education brought him the chancellorship of the University of Exeter, from 1998 (where a building dedicated to drama was posthumously named after him), a governorship of Wycombe Abbey School, and a quintet of honorary degrees.<br>
<br>A consensual man by temperament, and schooled by the disciplines of his profession to see and to articulate both sides of any argument, Alexander was an early member of the Social Democratic Party but subsequently switched his allegiance, becoming a Conservative life peer in 1988. Although both a Europhile and a one-nation tory, he none the less was an admirer of Margaret Thatcher. He had well-known ambitions to become lord chancellor, but the vagaries of politics denied him a post to which he would have been well suited. He nevertheless rendered his public service without partisanship. He was on the government panel for sustainable development during the Major and the Blair premierships (1994&#150;2000), was a member of the Jenkins commission on electoral reform (1997&#150;8), and advised Gordon Brown (as chancellor) on the fiscal regime for the shipping industry. He also chaired the House of Lords delegated powers and deregulation scrutiny committee (1995&#150;2002).<br>
<br>If Conservative by party, Alexander was liberal by temperament. He served as chairman of Justice, the human rights organization (1990&#150;2005), and of Crisis, a charity for single homeless people (1990&#150;96). He wrote a book on constitutional reform, <span class="italic">The Voice of the People</span> (1997). He was a vigorous defender of judicial independence and of the interests of the bar. But usually he carried his emollient style from his profession into his public life, always balancing his criticism of particular policies with words of general praise for their authors. His broadside against the legitimacy of the invasion of Iraq (&#145;scraping the bottom of the legal barrel&#146;; <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 15 Oct 2003) and his assault on the government's hastily announced plans for constitutional reform in 2003 (&#145;apparently written on the back of an envelope&#146;; <span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 8 Nov 2005) were exceptions to the rule: the consummate diplomat could on occasion adopt the mien of the warrior.<br>
<br>Alexander was married three times: first on 26 October 1963 to Frances Rosemary Heveningham Pughe, a 22-year-old student, and daughter of Major Richard Pughe, army officer; secondly on 27 July 1978 to Elizabeth Frances Warrens Norman, a 25-year-old fashion designer, and daughter of Colonel Charles Richard Warrens Norman, army officer; and thirdly on 9 July 1985 to Mary (Marie) Anderson, a 38-year-old Irish-born barrister and former model, and daughter of Daniel Joseph Sugrue, farmer. The first two marriages ended in divorce but the third lasted until his death. With his first wife Alexander had three children, David (<i>b</i>. 1964), Mary (<i>b</i>. 1966), and William (<i>b</i>. 1969), and with his second a son, Mathew, who died in infancy. There was another daughter, Rosemary (<i>b</i>. 1962). He himself died at St Thomas's Hospital, Lambeth, London of a stroke on 6 November 2005, having risen from a provincial background to the summit of the establishment&#151;a classic illustration of the opportunity for upward mobility in post-war Britain.<br>
