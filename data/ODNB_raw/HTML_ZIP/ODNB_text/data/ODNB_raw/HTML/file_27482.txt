<span class="headword">Titus,  Silius</span>  (1622/3&#150;1704), <span class="occ">royalist conspirator and politician</span>, was born at Bushey, Hertfordshire, the first son of Silas Tyto (<i>d</i>. 1637) and his second wife, Constancia Colley (<i>d</i>. 1667). His father was of Italian ancestry and was a soap manufacturer and salter of some wealth who lived at Bushey and Holborn, London. Titus matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, in March 1638, aged fifteen. In the following year he entered the Middle Temple, where he remained until the outbreak of civil war in 1642 (he was to hold on to his rooms there until 1652). He joined the forces of parliament in Hertfordshire, where he was granted a commission in the county militia and also served as a captain under Colonel Ayloffe; he was present at the siege of Donnington Castle in October 1644. Titus was of presbyterian persuasion and chose to resign his commissions rather than serve in the New Model Army. Appointed to attend the king when the latter was at Holdenby House in 1647, he brought news of the king's seizure by Cornet George Joyce and was granted an annuity of &pound;50 by parliament. Later he served in the king's household while the latter was held in the Isle of Wight, and was won over to the royalist side. As part of his new service to Charles I, Titus attempted to engineer the king's escape from the island and was expelled from Carisbrooke Castle. He remained on the Isle of Wight, however, and in September 1648 was once more in attendance on the king until Charles was taken into final custody by the army. The presbyterian faction in parliament, desiring a messenger to Jersey, used Titus, but the discovery of this action meant that he was forced to become an exile in December 1649.<br>
<br>After the regicide Titus sought service with the new king and accompanied Charles II into Scotland. There his presbyterianism led to his appointment as one of the grooms of the bedchamber to the king. Thereafter Titus was frequently used as a confidential messenger, especially in 1651 when he carried the idea of Charles II's marriage to the marquess of Argyll's daughter to the queen mother. Exile and the royal court in the 1650s also brought Titus into the world of intrigue, where he often used the alias of John Jennings. He was daring in his exploits as he went back and forth carrying messages to the king's allies in England; some thought him &#145;negligent of his own safety&#146; in such business  (Routledge, 4.226). In June 1659 he was observed prowling undisguised in a bookbinder's shop in London when he had already been closely involved in Booth's royalist rising of that year and would have been severely dealt with if caught. Titus had, however, previously made overtures to secretary of state John Thurloe for permission to return to England in 1654, even offering to swear fidelity to Cromwell. These overtures were rejected and the exiled Charles II and Sir Edward Hyde continued to trust Titus. Hyde noted &#145;unless he is the greatest dissembler in the world &hellip; he sets the least value on himself and gives the greatest testimony to others&#146;  (Routledge, 4.460).<br>
<br>In the 1650s Titus was associated with the exiled George Villiers, second duke of Buckingham, and through Buckingham he became acquainted with the plotters John Wildman and Edward Sexby. It was Titus who encouraged the former Leveller Sexby in his plans to assassinate Cromwell and from March to April 1657 the pair lurked in the Netherlands. It was at this time that Sexby composed his pseudonymous pamphlet <span class="italic">Killing Noe Murder</span>. In 1697 Titus claimed sole authorship of this notorious publication, but it is likely that Sexby, who was no fool, and a very capable author in his own right, had the main part in its creation. It may be that Titus, who later became known for his quips in parliament, added some of the wit that sparkles throughout the work. But after Sexby's arrest in July 1657 it was he, not Titus, who publicly acknowledged the pamphlet as his own.<br>
<br>With the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 Titus returned home. He was rewarded for his former service with &pound;3000 from the Convention Parliament and the keepership of Deal Castle. He sat in the Convention as a member for Ludgershall in Wiltshire and went on to serve in the parliaments of three reigns: for Lostwithiel in 1670, Hertfordshire in 1679, Huntingdonshire in 1679 and 1681, and Ludlow in 1691. While managing to remain in the Commons during a large part of this period he was noted as a speaker willing to use wit even in the dullest debates. Although he was never sufficiently significant to gain major office, there were rumours of his receiving a secretary of state's post in the 1680s. He was often seen as a court supporter, but he also remained very much the back-bench agitator, preferring to play to the gallery and relish his own jokes. Nevertheless, Titus was serious enough in seeking revenge against the regicides and was one of those who moved for the exhumation of the bodies of Cromwell, Ireton, and Bradshaw in 1661. He lost his seat at the election that same year and remained out of the Commons for some time, but he retained his post as groom of the bedchamber. In 1663 he married Katherine (<i>d</i>. in or after 1705), daughter of James Winstanley, counsellor at law of Gray's Inn and Braunstone, Leicestershire; they had three daughters. In 1666 during the Dutch war Titus was made a captain of a company and colonel of the Kent militia. During the 1670s he became a propertied gentleman, resigning his post as groom of the bedchamber and buying Ramsey Abbey in Huntingdonshire.<br>
<br>During the years of the Popish Plot, Titus was an active leader of the anti-Popish faction in the Commons, where among other matters he served as one of the examiners of Edward Coleman, the duke of York's secretary, and attacked a French version of the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> (and by implication its translator) for its papist interpretations. He was often a melodramatic speaker during the period of the plot. Although he sometimes missed the humour of the house because of this, he also tended to be one of those who dominated its debates. Titus had both personal and financial reasons to hate Thomas Osborne, earl of Danby, the king's chief minister, who became a target during the plot on grounds of his dealings with the French on Charles II's behalf. Titus cited non-payment of &pound;4000 owed for his offices on the council of plantations and as groom of the bedchamber; he was also against popery and arbitrary government in any form. He was thus one of the first to attack Danby in the Commons in 1679 and was also very active in the second Exclusion Parliament of 1680&#150;81, especially against the earl of Halifax. He was one of the managers of Viscount Stafford's trial and undertook any number of interventions on the matter of exclusion itself, although he may well have been trying to get the government to buy him off with office and was never that popular with other exclusionists. He made his most famous speech in January 1681 on the matter of limitations on a Catholic sovereign with his usual wit.<br>
<br>Titus was out of politics for some years after the dissolution of 1681, but was suspected of complicity in the Rye House plot of 1683 and in Monmouth's rebellion of 1685. He attracted attention once again in 1687 when he spoke in favour of the repeal of the penal laws and was thus brought into the privy council by James II, who sought both a presbyterian counterweight to the Church of England men and aid in the remodelling of parliament. Titus was rapidly disillusioned with James, claiming he would have nothing to do with the regime by February 1688, and he attempted to switch sides to William of Orange later that year. However, Titus seems to have overplayed his hand by accepting the patronage of a Catholic monarch and although he came back into parliament in 1691 he gained only limited success. He died in December 1704 at Bushey and was buried there the same month in St James's Church. He was survived by his wife and at least two of their daughters, Susan and Catherine.<br>
