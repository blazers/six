<span class="headword">Baker,  John Wynn</span>  (<em>c.</em>1730&#150;1775), <span class="occ">agricultural improver and writer</span>, emigrated from England, possibly from Worcester, to Ireland in 1761 after the collapse of a business scheme to convey brine from salt pits to the River Severn by a system of pipes. He published his first experimental treatise in Dublin, <span class="italic">Some Hints for the Better Improvement of Husbandry</span>, in 1762. In this work Baker proposed that the Dublin Society should establish an experimental farm. The society agreed and voted him &pound;100 to set up the farm and a further &pound;200 to conduct experiments. Baker hired a 354 acre property in Laughlinstown, co. Kildare (9 miles outside Dublin), and published annual reports of his experimental programme from 1764 until 1773. He established a factory for manufacturing agricultural implements in 1765 (again with the financial assistance of the Dublin Society). The factory enjoyed considerable success until it was destroyed by fire two years later. During the 1760s and early 1770s Baker contributed articles to the journal <span class="italic">Museum Rusticum et Commerciale</span>, and produced pamphlets on agriculture and related matters. The pamphlets include <span class="italic">A Plan for Instructing Youths in the Knowledge of Husbandry</span> (1765), in which Baker proposed the establishment of an academy to teach boys to farm scientifically, and <span class="italic">Considerations upon the Exportation of Corn</span> (1771), in which he advocated statutory regulation of the price of corn in Ireland. He published a more substantial treatise in 1771, <span class="italic">Practical Agriculture Epitomised, and Adapted to the Tenantry of Ireland</span>, which contained an extended account of agricultural innovations in France. Baker was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 14 February 1771 in recognition, as his certificate declares, of his contribution &#145;to polite and philosophical literature&#146;. Despite his considerable reputation Baker suffered in his final years from financial difficulties exacerbated by an increasingly fractious relationship with his sponsors, the Dublin Society. Baker is known to have married and had children. He died at Wynnsfield, co. Kildare, on 5 August 1775, and was buried at Celbridge, co. Kildare. Arthur Young wrote warmly of Baker's publications in a biographical article in <span class="italic">Annals of Agriculture</span> (1787), though he also complained of Baker's unsystematic approach to experimentation.<br>
