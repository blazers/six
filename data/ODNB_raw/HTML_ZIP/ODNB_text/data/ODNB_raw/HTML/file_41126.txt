<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Robinson,  Henry Peach</span>  (1830&#150;1901), <span class="occ">photographer and writer on photography</span>, was born at Linney, Ludlow, Shropshire, on 9 July 1830, the first of the four children of John Robinson (1806&#150;1855), master of the national school of the Church of England in Ludlow, and his wife, Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Peach (<i>d</i>. 1859). He was educated briefly at a dame-school in Middleton, and then at Horatio Russell's academy in Ludlow (1836&#150;43). From 1843 to 1844 he studied drawing privately with Richard Penwarne, but, his initial year of art tuition having failed to provide him with the prospect of a livelihood, in 1844 he was apprenticed to Richard Jones, a printer and bookseller in Ludlow.<br>
<br>This apprenticeship concluded in 1849, whereupon Robinson returned to his study of art, and in 1850 he joined the bookseller Benjamin Maund in Bromsgrove. There he was first instructed in the photographic art by an itinerant daguerreotype portraitist. In 1851 he took employment with a firm of booksellers and publishers, Whittaker &amp; Co., in London. During this year he began his experiments in photography on paper, and in 1852 he exhibited an oil painting, <span class="italic">On the Teme Near Ludlow</span>, at the Royal Academy. Publishing, the academic view of art, and experimentation with photographic technique remained closely linked throughout his career.<br>
<br>In 1853 Robinson sought employment in bookselling in Leamington Priors, where he remained until 1855. A meeting with the photographer Dr H. W. Diamond in 1854 inspired him to devote himself to the medium as a profession. Upon his father's death in 1855, Robinson found himself the head of the family and moved briefly to Ludlow; then in 1856 he opened a photographic studio in Leamington Spa. On 15 February 1859 he married Selina (1838&#150;1909), the daughter of John Edward Grieves, a chemist in Ludlow; they had two sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Robinson expanded his Leamington premises in 1862, but was forced to discontinue his studio practice two years later when his health broke down owing to exposure to photographic chemicals. Having relocated his family to London, he began writing for a variety of photographic journals. By 1868 he had recovered sufficiently to open a studio in Tunbridge Wells with a partner, Nelson King Cherrill. In 1870 he was elected vice-president of the Photographic Society, which he had first joined in 1857. In 1875 Robinson and Cherrill dissolved their partnership, with Robinson retaining the business. By 1886 Robinson's son Ralph was running the studio, and by 1888 he had effectively retired. Following an episode of censure and conflict at the Photographic Society in 1891 he resigned, and the following year he formed the rival Linked Ring association of photographers, serving as chairman of the judges for its exhibitions until 1900. In that year he was elected an honorary fellow of the Royal Photographic Society. Robinson suffered a seizure and paralysis soon afterwards, and he died on 21 February 1901 at his home, 2 Queen's Road, Tunbridge Wells. He was buried in Ben Hall Road cemetery in Tunbridge Wells.<br>
<br>Best-known to photographic history as a master of the combination printing technique, by which fragments of images from numerous negatives were painstakingly combined into an apparently seamless whole, Robinson created imposing photographic images modelled after the academic painting of his day. In many of these, amateur or professional models were dressed and arranged in fictitious settings to suggest a narrative. Of these, <span class="italic">Fading Away</span> (1858) was his first celebrated success, followed by increasingly ambitious compositions such as <span class="italic">A Holiday in the Wood</span> (1860), <span class="italic">The Lady of Shalott</span> (1860&#150;61), <span class="italic">Bringing Home the May</span> (1862), and <span class="italic">Autumn</span> (1863), many of which simulated landscape scenes even though they were photographed all or in part within the studio. His later moralizing cottage interiors, such as <span class="italic">When the Day's Work is Done</span> (1875&#150;7) and <span class="italic">Dawn and Sunset</span> (1885), were still more sophisticated in their technique and plausible in their appearance.<br>
<br>Robinson was ultimately more influential through his prolific writings than through his photographs. His landmark treatise <span class="italic">Pictorial Effect in Photography</span> (1869) was one of the first serious treatments of photography as fine art. It went through numerous editions and was followed by <span class="italic">The Art and Practice of Silver Printing</span> (written with Captain W. de W. Abney, 1881), <span class="italic">Picture Making by Photography</span> (1884), <span class="italic">The Photographic Studio and What to Do in it</span> (1885), <span class="italic">Letters on Landscape Photography</span> (1888), <span class="italic">Photography as a Business</span> (1890), <span class="italic">Art Photography in Short Chapters</span> (1895), and <span class="italic">The Elements of a Pictorial Photograph</span> (1896). These illustrated volumes explained the basic techniques of photography and articulated a set of aesthetic principles based on painting as a model for photographers to follow.<br>
<br>Throughout his life, Robinson championed the notion that photography must bow to the established conventions of art rather than taking nature as a model. As he put it, &#145;I do not fear to say that nature alone, as a picture, has far less interest than the same nature represented by a great artist.&#146; A lively feud was conducted during the 1880s between Robinson and a gifted younger photographer, Peter Henry Emerson, who challenged Robinson's views of photography, art, and nature in a series of articles and books, advocating the supremacy of nature and its use as a basis for creating photographic art. Entirely the elder statesman, Robinson refused to acknowledge the claims of the emerging school of photographers, and remained faithful to his style, subjects, and methods of composition throughout his life. His works are found today in major museum collections throughout the world, including the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television in Bradford, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Getty Museum in Los Angeles, George Eastman House in Rochester, New York, and the Gernsheim collection at the University of Texas, Austin.<br>
