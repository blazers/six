<span class="headword">Preston,  George</span>  (1659?&#150;1748), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the second son of George Preston (<i>d</i>. 1679) of Valleyfield, who was descended from the Prestons of Craigmillar and was created a baronet of Nova Scotia on 31 March 1637. His mother was Marion Sempill, only child of Hugh Sempill, fifth Lord Sempill. He was captain in the service of the states general in 1688, and accompanied William, prince of Orange, in his expedition to England. Subsequently he served in the foreign wars of King William and Queen Anne, and at the battle of Ramillies he was severely wounded. In 1706 he was made colonel of the Cameronian or 26th regiment, and he retained that office until 1720. At the outbreak of the rebellion in 1715 he was sent from London to take command of the castle of Edinburgh, and was finally appointed deputy governor of the castle, &#145;with a salary of ten shillings per day&#146;. He served for some years as commander-in-chief of the forces in Scotland. Despite his great age, Preston remained in his post at Edinburgh Castle as late as 1747. After the battle of Prestonpans in 1745 the victorious Jacobites laid siege to the castle. According to some accounts, the governor, General Joshua Guest, encouraged the siege as a way of delaying the rebels' advance into England. Other accounts claim that Guest was deterred from surrender only by his deputy's firmness. Indeed, Preston's robust conduct during the siege did much to ensure that the castle held out. By now in his eighties, he inspected the guards every two hours in a wheelchair propelled by a party of soldiers. More questionably, he responded to the blockade the highlanders threw around the castle by bombarding Edinburgh town with his guns. The damage, panic, and casualties that this caused did not deter Preston from repeating the ploy, until Charles Edward Stuart agreed to allow supplies to pass. Preston parried the rebels' threat to damage his Valleyfield estate in Fife by promising to have Wemyss Castle, the ancestral home of Lord Elcho, one of Charles's generals, razed by naval bombardment.<br>
<br>Preston died at Valleyfield on 7 July 1748. He left no children. He had paid off the encumbrances on the estate of Valleyfield, and thus acquired the right of the entail of the property, which he duly executed in favour of the heirs, male and female, of his brother Sir William and his nephew Sir George.<br>
