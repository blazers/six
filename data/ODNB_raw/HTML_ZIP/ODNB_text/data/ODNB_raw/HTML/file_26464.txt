<span class="headword">Stewart,  Charles</span>  (1775&#150;1812), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the eldest son of Thomas Stewart of Drumin, Banffshire, a lieutenant in the 56th foot, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gordon. After serving for a short time in the duke of Gordon's fencibles, he was commissioned lieutenant in the 71st (Highland) regiment on 25 January 1791. He joined it in India, and was wounded in the attack on Tippu Sahib's camp at Seringapatam on 6&#150;7 February 1792. He was with the light company, and was noticed by Lord Cornwallis. On 3 April 1794 he obtained a company in the 109th, and, when it was reduced in 1795, he was transferred with the men to the 53rd on 2 September.<br>
<br>Stewart served for several years in the West Indies, and was wounded in storming the Morne Fortun&eacute; at St Lucia in May 1796. He was promoted major in the 53rd on 4 April 1800, and came home in command of it about 1804. On 17 February 1805 he was made lieutenant-colonel of the newly raised 2nd battalion of the 50th. Sir Charles James Napier, who was major under him, wrote of him at the time as very pleasant in command and very decided, and afterwards spoke of him as one of the best officers of his rank.<br>
<br>Having been transferred to the 1st battalion, Stewart served with it in the Walcheren expedition, was left in command of the rearguard when the army withdrew, and was mentioned in dispatches. In September 1810 he went to the Peninsula with the 1st battalion, and commanded it throughout the campaigns of 1811&#150;12. It was engaged at Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro, and was soon afterwards attached to Hill's corps and took part in the actions at Arroyo de Molinos, Almaraz, and Alba de Tormes. In the storming of Fort Napoleon, at Almaraz, Stewart led the right wing of his regiment &#145;in a most gallant and spirited manner&#146;. The hardships of the retreat to Portugal in the autumn of 1812 broke down his health, and he died at Coria on 11 December; he was buried with military honours in the Campo Santo at Coria. He was unmarried.<br>
