<span class="headword">Stapley,  Anthony</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1590, <em>d.</em> 1655), <span class="occ">politician and regicide</span>, was baptized at Framfield, Sussex, on 30 August 1590, the son of Anthony Stapley (<i>d</i>. 1606) of Framfield and his third wife, Ann, daughter of John Thatcher of Priesthawes, Sussex. The Stapley family moved from Framfield to Patcham about 1625. Stapley gave &pound;10 to the new building at Christ's College, Cambridge, about 1640, and was probably educated there and at Gray's Inn. In May 1614 he married Ann (<i>d</i>. 1637), daughter of George Goring and sister of George Goring, later earl of Norwich. They had three sons and one daughter. After her death Stapley married Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harding (<i>d</i>. 1654), widow of Sir Edward Clarke of Reading. She died on 15 January 1654.<br>
<br>Stapley represented the borough of New Shoreham in the parliaments of 1624 and 1625, and the borough of Lewes in that of 1628, having unseated Sir George Rivers by petition. He was returned both for the county of Sussex and for the borough of Lewes to the Short Parliament in 1640, when he chose to sit for the county, and was re-elected by the county to the Long Parliament. He was one of the most prominent godly gentlemen in Sussex during the Caroline period, working with Sir Thomas Pelham to endow a puritan lectureship at Lewes and as fellow guardian of a future parliamentarian grandee, Herbert Morley. In 1639 he refused to contribute to the first bishops' war and in January 1640 he was labelled by one of Laud's chaplains as one of the ringleaders of the &#145;Puritan faction&#146; on the county bench  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1639&#150;40</i>, 386&#150;7). In the Long Parliament he was active against recusants, and as a supporter of &#145;root and branch&#146; reform of the church.<br>
<br>During the civil war Stapley received a colonel's commission in the parliamentary army, and was zealous in organizing the war effort in Sussex, particularly through the county committee. In 1643 he was made governor of the garrison at Chichester, where he distinguished himself by challenging the orders of his superiors, as in early 1644 when he raised objections to quartering troops of Sir William Waller. The dispute was referred to a committee of the House of Commons, and finally to the committee of both kingdoms on 26 February. Stapley was ordered by both bodies to observe Waller's commands, and following the passing of the self-denying ordinance in 1645 was succeeded at Chichester by Colonel Algernon Sidney.<br>
<br>Thereafter, Stapley was intermittently active in both the Commons and the county as a &#145;war party&#146; Independent, and supported the radical element in the Rump after Pride's Purge. He served as one of the judges of Charles I, attending all of the sessions of the trial and signing the death warrant on 29 January 1649 [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. He was elected a member of the first council of state of the Commonwealth on 17 February 1649 (when he signed the engagement), and re-elected in February 1650, November 1651, and November 1652. He had joined the admiralty committee in January 1649, and was made vice-admiral of Sussex in 1650. His principal allies during the Commonwealth were Sir Henry Vane the younger and Morley, but unlike many republicans Stapley supported Cromwell after the dissolution of the Rump. He was one of Cromwell's council of thirteen (29 April to 14 July 1653), and one of Barebone's Parliament (July to December 1653). Despite his advanced age, he was also returned, for Sussex, to the first protectorate parliament in 1654. He died early in 1655, and was buried at Patcham on 31 January.<br>

<a name="cosubject_26310"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Stapley</span>, baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1628, <em>d.</em> 1701), <span class="occ">royalist conspirator</span>, his second but eldest surviving son, was baptized at Patcham on 29 June 1628 and educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He represented the county of Sussex in the parliaments of 1654 and 1656 and in 1654 was appointed <i>custos rotulorum</i> in Sussex. His sympathy with royalism had been clear since 1648, when he signed the Sussex petition sympathetic to the king's cause, and in 1657 he became entangled in a plot hatched by a group of royalists and presbyterians for the return of Charles II. At the house of his kinswoman Lady Campion he had come under the influence of John Hewit and John, Lord Mordaunt. Ostensibly with a view to expiating his father's guilt, he promised to venture his life and fortune for the royal cause. In June 1657 he received through Hewit a commission from the exiled king to raise a troop of horse and six colonels' commissions, to be distributed at his discretion. His interest in the county was considered to be great, and his promises of support to the royalist party were confident. Doubts were, however, thrown upon his ability to carry out all his plans, not least by Ormond. Such suspicions were confirmed when the plot began to unravel in April 1658, partly through the treachery of one of Stapley's men, and due to the efficiency of Cromwell's intelligencers and spies. Stapley was quickly arrested, and protected himself by means of abject apologies to Cromwell, and by implicating his co-conspirators, leading to the arrests of Hewit, Mordaunt, and Sir Henry Slingsby. Cromwell, however, dismissed Stapley with a reproof, presumably on account of his friendship with his father. Stapley appeared as a witness against Mordaunt at his trial on 2 July 1658 but, according to Clarendon, answered &#145;in so disorderly and confused a manner that it appeared that he had much rather not have said it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Clarendon State Papers</span>, 6.63). His younger brother Anthony, who was also concerned in the plot, saved himself by similar means.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Stapley contrived to win the king's favour: he was created a baronet on 28 July 1660, knighted on 6 August, and managed to prevent the family estates from being forfeited to the crown for his father's role in the trial of Charles I. He represented Sussex in the Convention Parliament in 1660, and was elected again for the county in 1661. Subsequently he lived largely in retirement in Sussex. About 1651 he had married Mary (1635&#150;1709), eldest daughter and coheir of Sir Herbert Springett of Broyle Place, Ringmer, Sussex, with whom he had two sons, who predeceased him, and several daughters. He died on 22 August 1701, when the baronetcy became extinct, and was buried at Ringmer.<br>
