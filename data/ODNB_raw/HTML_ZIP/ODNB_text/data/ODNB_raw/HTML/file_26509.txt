<span class="headword">Stewart, Sir  Thomas Grainger</span>  (1837&#150;1900), <span class="occ">physician</span>, son of Alexander Stewart, decorator in Edinburgh, and Agnes, daughter of Hugh Grainger of Gogar Green, was born in Edinburgh on 23 September 1837. He was educated at Edinburgh high school and at the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated MD in 1858. While an undergraduate he was elected one of the presidents of the Royal Medical Society. After graduation he studied medicine at the universities and hospitals of Berlin, Prague, and Vienna, under, among others, R. Virchow, J. L. Schoenlein, and L. Traube.<br>
<br>After his return to Edinburgh, Stewart became house physician at the old infirmary under Professor John Hughes Bennett and Professor Thomas Laycock. In 1861 he lectured on materia medica and dietetics. In 1862 he was appointed pathologist to the infirmary, and lecturer on pathology at Surgeons' Hall, as well as a physician to the Edinburgh Hospital for Sick Children. Stewart married in 1863 Josephine Dubois, daughter of Charles Anderson of Riverhead, Jamaica. Following her death in 1864, he married in 1866 Jessy Dingwall Fordyce, daughter of the Revd Robert Macdonald. Also in 1866 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. During these early years Stewart worked incessantly; made numerous detailed observations on the symptoms and pathology of waxy kidney; and wrote papers on various kidney conditions, on dilatation of the bronchi, on acute atrophy of the liver, and on other subjects. In 1869 he published <span class="italic">A Practical Treatise on Bright's Disease of the Kidneys</span>, which was well received in Britain and in the USA.<br>
<br>Unsuccessful in his application for the chair of pathology in 1869&#151;obtained by William Rutherford Sanders&#151;Stewart resigned his appointments to fill the posts of junior ordinary physician in the infirmary and lecturer on clinical medicine. His clear and painstaking method of lecturing, and the interest he took in the work of his students, soon led to a large increase in their number. In 1873 he began to lecture in the extramural school on the practice of physic; he swiftly became the most popular teacher on medicine outside the university, and introduced many practical improvements in teaching methods.<br>
<br>In 1876 Stewart devoted himself exclusively to teaching and consultation work. In the same year, on the death of Professor Laycock, his success as a teacher and physician had been so marked that he was appointed professor of the practice of physic in Edinburgh University&#151;&#145;the blue ribbon of medicine&#146;&#151;becoming also one of the professors of clinical medicine, with wards in the Royal Infirmary, of which he was afterwards for many years senior physician. Stewart showed himself to be one of the most successful lecturers in the university; moreover, in consultation work he had one of the largest practices in Scotland, and on many occasions he was called to cases abroad.<br>
<br>In 1878 Stewart was president of the section of medicine at the meeting of the British Medical Association at Bath, and at the International Medical Congress in London in 1881 he introduced the discussion on Bright's disease. In 1882, on the death of Sir Robert Christison, he was appointed physician-in-ordinary to Queen Victoria in Scotland. In 1887 he received the honorary degree of MD from the Royal University of Ireland, was elected an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, and also obtained the honorary degree of MD of the University of Dublin. In 1892 he was elected an honorary fellow of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia. He was president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (of which he was a fellow) from 1889 to 1891, and for two years was also president of the Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical Society. In 1894 he was knighted. Later in the same year he addressed the British Medical Association at Bristol on influenza. In 1897 he received the degree of LLD from Aberdeen University, and in 1898 he acted as president of the British Medical Association at Edinburgh. In 1899 he went as representative of Edinburgh University to the Berlin congress on tuberculosis; he was appointed one of the congress vice-presidents, and Virchow introduced him as &#145;mein ber&uuml;hmtester Sch&uuml;ler&#146;&#151;&#145;my most eminent pupil&#146;.<br>
<br>As a clinical teacher Stewart was clear and systematic, and he conducted his class by means of question and answer, while the students in rotation listened to abnormal sounds in the patient's chest or otherwise examined him. As a lecturer he was equally lucid and precise, with an ability to go straight to the main point in each case, so that his instruction was easily followed and understood even by the least experienced student. Stewart was a man of wide and general culture, and devoted much time to the study of Scottish history and archaeology. His main effort in literature was <span class="italic">The Good Regent: a Chronicle Play</span>, a drama on the subject of the Regent Moray, published in 1898. Stewart had previously contributed anonymous verses and translations to different periodicals. He had, according to contemporaries, &#145;a great gift of ready and attractive and charming speech, and this was enhanced by his tall, commanding and dignified presence&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 355).<br>
<br>Stewart took a foremost part in founding and organizing the Medical Students' Association, and for two terms was president of the Medical Missionary Society, in which he was keenly interested. His views on diseases of the kidneys were widely accepted by his peers. He was also one of the first in Britain to draw attention to the deep reflexes in neuritis, and described the condition known as multiple neuritis. Long before brain surgery became common, he persuaded Joseph Lister to perform operations on the brain for traumatic epilepsy. Stewart's lectures were widely quoted on the continent, and several of them were translated into French, German, and Russian, even becoming set texts in several German universities.<br>
<br>Stewart died at his address at 19 Charlotte Square, Edinburgh, on 3 February 1900, and was buried four days later in the Dean cemetery, following a service at the Free St George's Church, Edinburgh, where he had been an elder. His wife, four sons, and four daughters survived him.<br>
