<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Webb <span class="st"> [<em>married names </em>Brierley, Hunter, Searle]</span>,  Kathleen (Kaye)</span>  (1914&#150;1996), <span class="occ">children's publisher and journalist</span>, was born on 26 January 1914 at Flanders Road, Chiswick, London, only daughter and second child of Arthur Webb (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1971) and his wife, Kathleen Stevens (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1962), both journalists.<br>
<br>Webb's family had a strong journalistic and theatrical tradition. One grandfather was William Webb, whose &#145;penny plain, twopence coloured&#146; toy theatres were eventually taken over by the publishing firm of Pollocks. Her father, Arthur Webb, was foreign correspondent of the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span> and news editor of the <span class="italic">Irish Times</span>, and her mother, Kathleen Stevens, was the drama critic of the <span class="italic">Irish Times</span>. Webb's brother Bill worked on the <span class="italic">Sporting Life</span>.<br>
<br>When she was nine, Webb was kept in bed for a year by rheumatic fever. During this time she read voraciously, encouraged by her mother. Formal education was at Hornsey high school and Ashburton School in Devon, where she and her brother boarded. She detested Ashburton, but was fortunate in her English teacher, Ben R. Gibbs, who sent poems written for the school magazine by some of his pupils to Walter de la Mare. These were returned with the comment &#145;There is one exceptional poem here&#146;: it was Webb's. Years later, she met and became friends with de la Mare.<br>
<br>At the age of fifteen Webb wrote replies to children's letters for <span class="italic">Mickey Mouse Weekly</span>, receiving 2<i>d</i>. for each answer. She also wrote film reviews for her mother and in 1931 she joined <span class="italic">Picturegoer</span> as George the Answerman, moving later to <span class="italic">Caravan World</span> and <span class="italic">Sports Car</span>. She later admitted, &#145;I didn't know a thing about it&#151;I read it all up in books&#146;  (interview, <span class="italic">Mother</span>, December 1979).<br>
<br>In 1938 Webb moved to Sir Edward Hulton's new publication, <span class="italic">Picture Post</span>, as a secretary. When war broke out and many of the staff joined up Webb became assistant editor of another Hulton publication, the magazine <span class="italic">Lilliput</span>, in 1941. Tom Hopkinson, who edited both magazines, left her to produce <span class="italic">Lilliput</span> practically single-handed: &#145;Without the war, it could have taken years to bring me to the point when I was asking Dylan Thomas to write captions, and ringing up H. G. Wells and Bernard Shaw to get articles out of them&#146;  (quoted in L. Birch, 41&#150;4). At this time Webb was also an ambulance driver, an air raid warden, a canteen worker, and a member of the Fleet Street women's rifle brigade. She married Christopher Brierley in 1937 and then Andrew Hunter in 1942 but both marriages ended in divorce. On 12 March 1948 Webb married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/104610/', "Ronald Searle (1920&#150;2011)")</script>, the artist who had illustrated some of <span class="italic">Lilliput</span>'s most successful cartoons about the dreadful girls' school St Trinian's. Webb and Searle had twins, a boy and a girl.<br>
<br>Webb left <span class="italic">Lilliput</span> and worked as a freelance from her home at 32 Newton Road, London W2. She became theatre correspondent to <span class="italic">The Leader</span>, wrote weekly features for the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>, broadcast regularly on <span class="italic">Woman's Hour</span>, and had her own television programme. With Searle she started the Perpetua Press, and she worked with him on a number of books, for which she provided the text and he the illustrations.<br>
<br>In 1955 John Grigg asked Webb to edit the children's magazine <span class="italic">Young Elizabethan</span>, which he had bought from Collins. Webb worked on this magazine, soon renamed <span class="italic">Elizabethan</span>, until 1961, publishing work by many of the foremost children's authors and illustrators of the day. She also developed her special genius for communicating with children, especially through the magazine's club, which encouraged young readers to submit their own work.<br>
<br>In 1961 Webb's marriage to Searle collapsed and divorce followed in 1967. Also in 1961 Allen Lane, founder of Penguin Books, asked Webb to become editor of Puffin Books, replacing Eleanor Graham, editor for twenty years, who was retiring. Webb tackled her new job with characteristic verve and enthusiasm. Publishing children's books was new to her, so she set about investigating just what children enjoyed and wanted to read. Discovering that a child could read about 600 books during the period of childhood, she determined that &#145;every single book must count&#146;. Lane allowed her to publish more than Eleanor Graham's twenty titles a year, agreeing also to keep the prices low.<br>
<br>There were 124 Puffins on the list when Webb arrived. Her first Puffin was J. R. R. Tolkien's <span class="italic">The Hobbit</span>. It was on her list for only one year due to a fixed-term contract from Allen and Unwin, Tolkien's publisher. Webb widened and diversified the list, adding Young Puffins, Picture Puffins, and Peacocks. Many titles came from the explosion of new and exciting writers that appeared in the 1960s and 1970s. She published books by authors whom Graham had been unable to buy, and introduced authors from overseas. She also published Puffin Originals&#151;some were stories rejected elsewhere but in which she saw merit; work was also specially commissioned and there were film and television tie-ins. Some books supported charities.<br>
<br>Webb became director of the children's division of Penguin Books in 1966. Like Graham before her, she believed that children deserved the highest quality of writing and artwork, whatever their age. With her instinct for promotion, Puffin sales soared, and authors longed to be &#145;Puffined&#146;. But Puffin's success encouraged other publishers to start their own paperback publishing and some of the titles Puffin had made famous reverted to appear on the new lists. Each loss was a personal blow.<br>
<br>Perhaps Webb's most extraordinary achievement was the creation of the Puffin Club in 1967. This was designed to cut out layers of adults, and to tell children directly about books and the authors and artists who wrote and illustrated them. Club members could also submit their own work for publication in the quarterly journal, <span class="italic">Puffin Post</span>, and competition winners' work was shown at the annual Puffin exhibition. Members enjoyed badges and books, a secret code, a song, and passwords. There were parties, activities, and holidays. Club members raised money to buy a mile of cliff for a seabird sanctuary and buried a time capsule containing Puffin books and memorabilia. Webb won the Eleanor Farjeon award for distinguished services to children's literature in 1969, and became one of the first women members of the Society of Bookmen in 1972. In 1973 she became a director of the Unicorn Children's Theatre, and chairman of the Independent Broadcasting Authority's local advisory committee. She was made an MBE in 1974.<br>
<br>Webb ran Puffin Books and the Puffin Club with a small staff. Dedicated to her work, she demanded&#151;and almost got&#151;the same twenty-four-hour devotion to children and their books that she herself displayed. She commanded great affection and great exasperation, often both at the same time.<br>
<br>Kaye Webb was about 5 feet 6 inches tall and had a mass of grey wavy hair. Her nickname of &#145;Fat Puffin&#146; was not to do with her appearance, but originated with the Puffin Club. Via its magazine, <span class="italic">Puffin Post</span>, it developed characters such as Odway the dog, TOMCAT (Totally Obedient Machine, Can't Actually Think), the unreliable computer, and Fat Puffin, who was the leader of many of the cartoon puffins, illustrated by Jill McDonald. He was fat because he ate too many doughnuts, but Webb became identified as Fat Puffin because she was the chief Puffin.<br>
<br>During the 1970s Webb left Newton Road, living for a while in Chiswick before moving to a mansion flat by the canal in Little Venice. She suffered for many years from osteo- and rheumatoid arthritis, ill-health finally forcing her to retire in 1979. That same year, Puffin 1295 was <span class="italic">I Like this Poem</span>, her own compilation of children's favourite poetry. She continued to work from her wheelchair, editing <span class="italic">Puffin Post</span> until 1981, acting as children's adviser to Goldcrest Television until 1984, broadcasting, reviewing, and editing books. Kaye Webb died on 16 January 1996 and was cremated at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
<br>When Webb arrived at Puffin Books, she had already enjoyed a career in journalism which many might have envied. Yet it was her later career as a children's publisher which brought her the greatest fame, and perhaps more importantly, the friendship and gratitude of many thousands of children around the world who discovered because of her that books are fun.<br>
