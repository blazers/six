<span class="headword">Shelvocke,  George</span>  (1675&#150;1742), <span class="occ">privateer and author</span>, was born in Deptford and entered the navy in 1690. On 25 April 1704 he was commissioned lieutenant in the <i>Scarborough</i>. He moved into the <i>Association</i>, then the <i>Britannia</i>, and soon afterwards was paid off. He found employment again only at the reduced rank of purser, in which he served aboard the <i>Monck</i> until 1713, when he was paid off once more before enduring five years of severe poverty. He applied for help to Edward Hughes, who had been purser in the <i>Scarborough</i> and was then partner in a plan to finance a privateering expedition to the South seas. Shelvocke was promised command of the larger of the two vessels, the <i>Success</i>. Letters of marque and reprisal were issued by the high court of Admiralty on 1 January 1719, authorizing Hughes and his associates &#145;to set upon by force of Arms, and to subdue and take the Men of War, Ships, and other Vessels whatsoever, as also the Goods, Monies and Merchandizes, belonging to the King of Spain, his vassals and Subjects&#146;  (TNA: PRO, HCA 26/29: 5). The &#145;Scheme of the Voyage&#146; presented by the owners to the commanders was rather more specific, and instructed them to raid the town of Paita on the Peruvian coast, and to capture the treasure-ship plying between Lima and Panama. John Clipperton, who had sailed as chief mate with William Dampier in the <i>St George</i> (1703&#150;4), was named commander of the <i>Success</i>, and Shelvocke was given the smaller ship, the <i>Speedwell</i>, a demotion resulting from excesses he committed with ship's stores while recruiting crew at Ostend. The expedition got under way on 13 February 1719. Very soon Shelvocke lost touch with Clipperton, and proceeded on his own into the Pacific Ocean where he raided Paita and headed for Juan Fernandez, the last point of rendezvous with Clipperton. There, on 25 May 1720, the <i>Speedwell</i> was wrecked in circumstances that left Shelvocke's management and motives open to doubt. For five months he and his crew were marooned on &#145;the Land of Robinson Crusoes&#146;  (Burney, 4.465), oddly perched between fact and fiction. Experiences of life on a deserted island was then a subject of public interest. Alexander Selkirk had become famous for the four years he spent in solitude on the island after he was left there by John Stradling of the <i>Cinque Ports</i>, Dampier's consort, in 1705. And in the same year Shelvocke set out for the South seas, Daniel Defoe published <span class="italic">The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe</span>, loosely based on Selkirk's experiences. Indeed Shelvocke had been heard to say, &#145;It was not difficult living at Fernandes, if a man should accidentally be thrown there, since Mr Selkirk had continu'd upon it four years by himself&#146;  (Betagh, 172).<br>
<br>Shelvocke and his men built a 20 ton boat out of the wreck of the <i>Speedwell</i>, called her the <i>Recovery</i>, and put to sea in October. They transferred into their first prize, renamed the <i>Happy Return</i>, and resumed the cruise, several times encountering Clipperton in the <i>Success</i>. But when Clipperton discovered that the ship's articles in Shelvocke's vessel had been changed after the events on Juan Fernandez to resemble the &#145;Jamaica discipline&#146; of the buccaneers, he refused to accompany it, and the owner's agent, James Hendry, and Thomas Dodd, lieutenant of marines, went aboard the <i>Success</i>. After transferring into a bigger prize, the 300 ton <i>Sacra Familia</i>, Shelvocke captured the <i>Concepcion de Recova</i>, heavily laden with sweetmeats and (according to an eyewitness) a large amount of silver which Shelvocke neglected to report. Suffering severely from thirst and scurvy, he and the survivors (a third of the original complement) made their way to Canton, where he sold his prize and took passage for England in the East Indiaman <i>Cadogan</i>; he arrived at Dover on 1 August 1722, and little more is heard of him after that.<br>
<br>In 1724 Shelvocke presented a journal of his &#145;Voyage to the South Sea to cruise on the Spaniards&#146; to the lords of the Admiralty. In the expanded published version, <span class="italic">A Voyage Round the World by Way of the Great South Sea</span> (1726), he presciently discusses the economic possibilities of guano and whaling, as well as mentioning traces of gold on the coast of California. His narrative is best remembered for the solitary albatross shot by Simon Hatley as the <i>Speedwell</i> entered the Southern Ocean, an episode absent from the manuscript version but told in the book with such laconic emphasis that it found a passage to Wordsworth's heart, and thence to Coleridge's <span class="italic">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</span> (1798). In 1726 Shelvocke wrote a memorial to the lords of the Admiralty, responding to a revival of interest in the scheme of establishing a British base off the coast of South America. He suggests Chiloe as &#145;the most weatherly &amp; commodious place in every respect to curb the power of the Spaniards in South America&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 19034, fol. 84<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>It is clear from his journal and the <span class="italic">Voyage</span> that Shelvocke had enemies. He speaks scornfully of John Clipperton, whom he accuses of thwarting the expedition and of cheating the owners, and several times he recalls darkly how Clipperton stole Dampier's privateering commission fifteen years before, causing him to be imprisoned at Batavia on a charge of piracy, as if to draw a parallel between his case and Dampier's&#151;&#145;for I well remember'd how Dampier had been serv'd in these seas&#146;  (Shelvocke, 218). William Betagh, Edward Brooke, Samuel Randall, and Simon Hatley are accused of insubordination and mutiny, and Thomas Dodd and James Hendry are represented as periodically insane. The only one to respond publicly to these charges was William Betagh, who was captured by the Spanish before the <i>Speedwell</i> was lost. His testimony against Shelvocke is therefore largely hearsay, based on George Taylor's and Thomas Dodd's journals (no longer extant) for eyewitness reports of events which took place after his disappearance. In his <span class="italic">Voyage Round the World</span> (1728) Betagh tells a story of a captain of Machiavellian cunning, led on by revenge, greed, and love of power to construct a chain of seeming accidents designed to impugn the characters of his colleagues, to thin his crew, to force a change in the ship's articles, to defraud the owners of the bulk of the profit of the cruise, and to leave him&#151;the perpetrator&#151;looking like a helpless victim of misfortune and ill will. Specifically Betagh alleges that Shelvocke had no intention of accompanying Clipperton, and while still in the Atlantic took advantage of his independence by committing an act of piracy against a Portuguese ship. He goes on to say that covertly Shelvocke fomented two mutinies against his own command, first at St Catherine's in Brazil and then at Juan Fernandez, and that the latter plan included the deliberate wrecking of the <i>Speedwell</i>, an act performed on a serene day after various important items (including Shelvocke's commission and the ship's forge) had been sent ashore. Although Betagh suggests that this was done to exclude the owners from any interest in prizes taken in a new bottom, it seems more likely that Shelvocke aimed at two things&#151;a revision of articles that would suit him while compromising the crew, and a situation sufficiently critical to cause some of them to remain on the island (eleven stayed behind), so increasing his dividend in another way. Betagh also accuses Shelvocke of drinking Jacobite toasts, and of celebrating the Pretender's birthday on Juan Fernandez with white cockades and volleys of musketry.<br>
<br>Although twentieth-century studies of the voyage have relied to a large extent on Betagh for important details, particularly concerning the legal aftermath, the lack of official corroboration has left him vulnerable. W. G. Perrin and Philip Edwards believe that his account of the St Catherine's mutiny is basically correct, yet Perrin inclines to the view that the bulk of his testimony is &#145;a rather incoherent jumble of accusations&#146;  (Perrin, 19). In the most authoritative recent discussion of these charges and counter-charges, Glyndwr Williams joins with O. H. K. Spate in believing it &#145;unprofitable to decide which was the more atrocious traducer&#146; (Williams, 197; Spate, 383). <span class="roman">Chancery records</span>, however, have turned up an application for a writ of <i>ne exeat regnum</i> which supports to some degree Betagh's account of the voyage and of the legal entanglements following it. Betagh claims that Edward Hughes, disbelieving what Shelvocke told him when he finally got to London, had him placed first in the Wood Street compter and then in the king's bench while seeking a writ. Although no proof remains of Shelvocke's incarceration, the grant of the writ exists  (TNA: PRO, C 33/339, pt 1, 7). In it Edward Hughes, John Gumley, Beake Winder, and Henry Neale (listed as owners in the letters of marque) are joined by five others (Alexander Strahan, Hinnfred Sharpe, Andrew Drummond, Richard Chichley, and George Middleton) to cite George Shelvocke, Blowfield Coldsea (master), Matthew Stewart (who organized the mutiny at St Catherine's), John Rainor (lieutenant of marines), George Shelvocke junior, and five more of the crew for breaking the articles of the cruise. The entry states:<blockquote>Shelvocke soon after setting sail with the ship Speedwell in Company with the Success being separated by a storm from her wilfully neglected joining with the said Ship Success again but proceeded &hellip; to voyage by himself &amp; not only plundered &hellip; a vessel in Amity wt his Ma[jes]tie but also took severall Spanish Ships of considerable value &amp; shared &amp; divided up the prizes amongst himself &amp; his Ships Company as by Affidt thereto annext.</blockquote>The affidavits were supplied by William Betagh and Thomas Dodd, but the owners themselves affirmed that Shelvocke and his fellow defendants gave them no adequate account of prizes taken between July and August 1721 (including the <i>Concepcion de Recova</i>), and the court found the evidence convincing enough to proceed. There seems little reason to doubt the estimate, based on Betagh's transcription of Stewart's account book, that Shelvocke emerged from the voyage with a sum adjacent to &pound;7000, some of which he used to bribe himself out of trouble. For Betagh continues the story from the granting of writ:<blockquote>Shelvocke getting bail to the action at common law, contrived so with the marshal of the king's bench prison, that he escaped on a Sunday, and prevented the said writ in chancery being served upon him; and has ever since absconded. Mean time the bill in chancery was carry'd on, to which Shelvocke refusing to put in answer, a writ of rebellion was issued out: but a brother in law of Shelvocke apply'd to two of the owners, being complainants in the bill, and so prevailed with them, that they pretended they were about a composition with the defendant: so that a sudden stop was made to the prosecution. (Betagh, 230)</blockquote>It is fair to add that it was not uncommon for privateering cruises to end in mutual recrimination and litigation. Depositions were taken accusing Dampier and Rogers of having secreted plunder; and there were bitter disputes between the crews of George Anson's squadron about the distribution of prize money. Perhaps the best state of the case against Shelvocke is given by John Harris (ed. John Campbell), upon whom John Callender and James Burney rely for their judgement of the voyage. Campbell believes that three aspects of Betagh's story deserve attention: Clipperton's refusal to cruise with him once he suspected him of piracy; the regular losses of ship's crew by capture, misadventure, and marooning; and the lading of the <i>Concepcion de Recova</i>. Although he does not spell it out, Harris finds &#145;a very extraordinary piece of secret history&#146; linking the revision of the ship's articles (in which the Juan Fernandez episode seems to have been crucial) to the wastage of people meant to benefit from it, including those from whom Shelvocke had most to fear: Betagh, Hatley, Dodd, and Hendry, none of whom was allowed to keep a journal while under his command (Harris, 1.230; Betagh, 104). Clipperton might have given the most damning account of all, had he not died of alcoholism and a broken heart soon after reaching home. If Shelvocke were guilty of even half of what Betagh lays to his charge, then he proved a consummate exponent of the <i>tu quoque</i>, cleverly loading his enemies with the very guilt he deserved. The enigma of Shelvocke's voyage was current in maritime circles. Shortly before Captain Cheap shot and killed him on the coast of Patagonia, Henry Cozens (a midshipman on the <i>Wager</i> in Anson's expedition) shouted at him, &#145;That he was come into those Seas to pay Shelvocke's Debts; and also insolently added, Tho' Shelvocke was a Rogue, he was not a Fool; and by G&#151; you are both&#146;  (Bulkeley, 40). Shelvocke's journal also reveals him to have been inclined to gout and corpulence, though even his enemies acknowledged his excellent seamanship. While capable of &#145;a winning address&#146;, he was &#145;not insensible of his own Merit&#146;  (Moore, 1.91). He died, according to a now destroyed memorial stone, in 1742, and was buried at St Nicholas's, Deptford. Shelvocke's <span class="italic">Voyage</span> was reissued in 1757 by his son George, who was then secretary to the general Post Office.<br>
