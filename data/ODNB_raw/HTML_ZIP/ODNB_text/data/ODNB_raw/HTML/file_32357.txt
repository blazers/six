<span class="headword">Champneys,  Basil</span>  (1842&#150;1935), <span class="occ">architect and author</span>, was born in Whitechapel, London, on 17 September 1842, the third of the five sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5098/', "(William) Weldon Champneys (1807&#150;1875)")</script>, rector of St Mary's Church, Whitechapel, afterwards dean of Lichfield, and his wife, Mary Anne, fourth daughter of Paul Storr, of Beckenham, Kent. He was an elder brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32358/', "Sir Francis Henry Champneys (1848&#150;1930)")</script>, obstetrician.<br>
<br>Champneys was educated at Charterhouse School, which was then in London, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained a second class in the classical tripos of 1864. He then studied architecture under John Prichard, diocesan surveyor of Llandaff. He began private practice in 1867. Although trained in the tenets of the Gothic revival, Champneys soon advocated a more eclectic approach to style. He was one of the first to design in the new Queen Anne mode and he also worked in the late Gothic, neo-Jacobean, and early English Renaissance styles. He married in 1876 May Theresa Ella, second daughter of Maurice Drummond, a descendant of William Drummond, fourth Viscount Strathallan; they had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>The long list of Champneys's buildings at Oxford includes the Indian Institute (1883&#150;96), Mansfield College (1887&#150;90), the Robinson Tower at New College (1896), new buildings for Oriel College (1908&#150;11) and Merton College (1904&#150;10), the library of Somerville College (1903), and the church of St Peter-le-Bailey (1872&#150;4). His works at Cambridge include the Archaeological Museum (1883), the divinity and literary schools (1879), and Newnham College (at intervals from 1875 to 1910). His structures in London include the chapel at Mill Hill School (1898) and new buildings for Bedford College in Regent's Park (1910). He also designed King's Lynn grammar school in Norfolk (1910&#150;13), the Butler Museum at Harrow School (1886), the museum at Winchester College in Hampshire (1898), and Bedford high school (1878&#150;92). His churches include his father's parish church of St Luke's, Kentish Town (1867&#150;70), the sailors' church of St Mary Star of the Sea, Hastings, Sussex (1878), and St Chad, Slindon, Staffordshire (1894). He was a surveyor to St Mary, Manchester, to which he added a west porch (1898) and a south annexe (1902&#150;3). His domestic work includes his home, Hall Oak, in Frognal, Hampstead (1881).<br>
<br>Champneys's masterpiece was the John Rylands Memorial Library in Deansgate, Manchester, which took nine years (1890&#150;99) to build and equip. This remarkable and costly monument was raised to the memory of John Rylands by the latter's widow, who admired the small library of Mansfield College, Oxford, and asked Champneys to develop it on a far more lavish scale. In spite of its cramped position on a mean street, the Rylands Library is a really noble design carried out in every detail with consummate skill in late Gothic style and with considerable regard for practical requirements.<br>
<br>The Royal Institute of British Architects awarded Champneys its royal gold medal for architecture in 1912, but he never became a member of that institute because he regarded architecture as an art allied to painting and sculpture rather than a profession. He supported younger architects who sought a unity of the arts and was an early member of the Century Guild. He was a sociable man with a wide circle of friends. He belonged to the Athenaeum, where he was a familiar face in the billiard-room, and to the Savile Club. He especially valued his connections with literary men, among them Walter Pater, Robert Louis Stevenson, Sidney Colvin, and the poet Coventry Patmore, whose <span class="italic">Memoirs and Correspondence</span> he published in 1900. He wrote an introduction to <span class="italic">Henry Merritt: Art Criticism and Romance</span> (1879). His papers on architecture include &#145;Churches about Queen Victoria Street&#146; (<span class="italic">Portfolio</span>, 1871), &#145;Victorian art and originality&#146; (<span class="italic">British Architect</span>, 1887), and &#145;The architecture of Queen Victoria's reign&#146; (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 1887). His papers on the then unfrequented district around Rye and Romney Marsh appeared first in <span class="italic">Portfolio</span> and later under the title <span class="italic">A Quiet Corner of England</span> (1875). In later life he published <span class="italic">A Retrospect and Memoir</span> (1915) of his mother-in-law, Adelaide Drummond. He died at his home, Hall Oak, 42 Frognal Lane, Hampstead, on 5 April 1935, at the age of ninety-two.<br>
