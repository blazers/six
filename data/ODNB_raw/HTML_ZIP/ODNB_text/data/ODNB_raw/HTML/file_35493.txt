<span class="headword">Petre, Sir  George Glynn</span>  (1822&#150;1905), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, born on 4 September 1822 at Twickenham, was the great-grandson of Robert Edward Petre, ninth Baron Petre, and the second son of Henry William Petre of Dunkenhalgh, Clayton-le-Moors, and his first wife, Elizabeth Anne, daughter of Edmund John Glynn, of Glynn, Cornwall. Raised as a Roman Catholic, he was educated at Stonyhurst College and Prior Park College, near Bath.<br>
<br>Petre entered the diplomatic service in 1846 as attach&eacute; to the British legation at Frankfurt, then the seat of the diet of the German confederation; he was thus in Frankfurt during the revolutions of 1848. He was transferred to Hanover in 1852 and to Paris in 1853, and was appointed paid attach&eacute; at The Hague in 1855 and at Naples in March 1856. When the Neapolitan government ignored the Anglo-French remonstrance on its anti-libertarian behaviour, diplomatic relations were broken off in the summer. Ill health caused Sir William Temple, the British minister, to leave Naples in July, and Petre assumed charge of the legation until it was withdrawn at the end of October. Petre performed his duties with judgement and ability; his reports laid before parliament give an interesting narrative of the course of events. In 1857 he was temporarily attached to the embassy at Paris, and in June 1859 he accompanied Sir Henry Elliot on his special mission to Naples, diplomatic relations having been resumed on the accession of Francis II. He then went as secretary of legation to Hanover, and acted as charg&eacute; d'affaires there from December 1859 until February 1860. He was transferred in 1864 to Copenhagen (where, in the following year, he assisted at the investiture of Christian IX with the Order of the Garter), and in 1866 to Brussels, and was promoted to be secretary of embassy at Berlin in 1868. After four years of service at Berlin, covering the period of the Franco-Prussian War, he became charg&eacute; d'affaires at Stuttgart in 1872, and in April 1881 he was appointed British envoy at Buenos Aires. In 1882 he was also accredited to the republic of Paraguay as minister-plenipotentiary. In January 1884 he was appointed British envoy at Lisbon, where he remained until his retirement on a pension (1 January 1893).<br>
<br>During the latter years of his service in Portugal the obstacles offered by the Portuguese authorities to free communication with the British missions and settlements established on the Shire River and the shores of Lake Nyasa, and the seizure of British vessels while passing through Portuguese waters on their way to the lake, led to a state of acute tension between the two governments. A convention for the settlement of these and related questions was signed by Lord Salisbury and the Portuguese minister in London on 20 August 1890, but in consequence of popular and parliamentary opposition the Portuguese government resigned office without obtaining the authority of the Cortes to ratify it, and their successors found themselves equally unable to carry it through. The negotiations had therefore to be resumed <i>de novo</i>. A <i>modus vivendi</i> was agreed upon and signed by Lord Salisbury and the new Portuguese minister, Senhor Luiz de Soveral, on 14 November 1890, by which Portugal granted free transit over the waterways of the Zambezi, Shire, and Pungwe rivers and a satisfactory settlement was finally placed on record in the convention signed by Petre and the Portuguese minister for foreign affairs on 11 June 1891. Petre's naturally calm and conciliatory disposition and the excellent personal relations which he succeeded in maintaining with the Portuguese ministers did much to keep the discussions on a friendly basis and to procure acceptance of the British demands. He was made CB in 1886 and KCMG in 1890.<br>
<br>Petre married on 10 April 1858 Emma Katharine Julia, fifth daughter of Major Ralph Henry Sneyd; they had six sons and a daughter. One son and the daughter predeceased him. He died at 6 Queen's Gardens, Hove, on 17 May 1905, and was buried at Odiham, Hampshire. His wife survived him.<br>
