<span class="headword">Cochrane, Sir  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1662&#150;1695), <span class="occ">conspirator</span>, born probably at Ochiltree, Ayrshire, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5759/', "Sir William Cochrane, later first earl of Dundonald (1605&#150;1685)")</script>, and his wife, Eupheme (<i>d</i>. after 1685), daughter of Sir William Scott of Ardross, Fife. He was the brother of Lord William Cochrane (<i>d</i>. 1679) and of Lady Grizel, who married George, tenth Lord Ross. He and his wife, Margaret, second daughter of Sir William Strickland of Boynton, Yorkshire, had three children: William (<i>d</i>. 1728), John of Waterside (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1663), and Grizel. The Scottish privy council appointed him a militia commissioner for Renfrew and Ayrshire in September 1668. For failing to protect the minister of Auchinleck, Ayrshire, he was fined by the council in March 1672, though it subsequently cancelled the penalty. He was close to the duke of Hamilton and the earl of Cassillis in the 1670s. A presbyterian, his chaplain for a time was William Carstares; in the autumn of 1677 Cochrane agreed to work with Sir Hugh Campbell of Cessnock and others to seek an indulgence for the presbyterians. Accused of attending conventicles, Cochrane was outlawed in February 1678 for refusing to take a bond making him responsible for his tenants' behaviour, including their attendance at illegal religious services. When he was elected a commissioner for Ayrshire, the Scottish council tried to void the appointment but was overruled by the convention of estates in June 1678. As commissioner Cochrane refused to levy rates to support the garrisoning of troops in Ayrshire to quash conventicles. Although he formally repudiated the Bothwell Bridge rebels in April 1679, his younger son joined the insurgents, and Cochrane himself helped some of them escape after their defeat.<br>
<br>During the spring of 1682 a group of Scots including Henry, Lord Cardross, invited Cochrane to participate in a scheme to establish a new colony, initially in New York, later in Carolina. By July that year Cochrane and Sir George Campbell were in London to purchase land from the Carolina proprietors, including the earl of Shaftesbury, agreeing to pay &pound;36,000 per annum for eight years, with a renewal provision for a like amount. Charles II directed the Scottish council to support the plan. In the meantime, Cochrane was probably involved with the earl of Argyll's unsuccessful efforts to smuggle weapons from the Netherlands to his Scottish supporters; he was certainly raising money for Argyll. By early 1683 Monmouth's inner circle, including Lord William Russell and Algernon Sidney, had learned of the disaffection of Cochrane and his associates toward the government and dispatched the attorney Aaron Smith to invite Cochrane and others to London for discussions about co-ordinated insurrections in Scotland and England. By April, Cochrane and his younger son were in London with other Scots dissidents. Carstares came from the Netherlands to tell Cochrane that Argyll needed &pound;30,000 to raise troops, a message Cochrane relayed to Russell. He also tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade Ford, Lord Grey, to provide horses from Northumberland for Argyll's recruits and conferred with Monmouth on at least one occasion.<br>
<br>On 4 June 1683 Cochrane and his younger son were cited to appear before the justiciary court in Edinburgh. According to Gilbert Burnet, with whom Cochrane associated in London, the latter fled to the Netherlands. On 16 August the Scottish council directed the king's advocate to bring charges of treason against Cochrane for having consorted with the Bothwell Bridge rebels. In late October the government was prepared to offer Cochrane a pardon if he confessed, but early the next month ambassador Thomas Chudleigh reported that he was &#145;hardend beyond all hopes of reclayming him, if it be not that he hopes by the means of his freinds to make his peace without acknowledging his guilt&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 41809, fol. 137<i>r</i>). Cochrane denied involvement in the conspiracy, refused to return to Scotland where he would have no right of habeas corpus, and professed his innocence in a letter to the earl of Middleton. He spent part of his exile in Cleves, in frequent contact with Grey, until he discovered that the woman with Grey was his mistress. In the autumn of 1683 Argyll and John Locke visited Cochrane in Cleves. Thereafter Cochrane and his son went to Hanover and L&uuml;neburg in search of a place for dissident Scots to settle. Having ignored a council order of January 1684 to appear, the Cochranes were formally declared outlaws, while the younger John Cochrane was adjudged guilty of treason in April 1684 for his role in the Bothwell rebellion, and his estate at Waterside, a gift from Dundonald, was forfeited. On 3 December 1684 directions were again issued to prosecute the elder Cochrane for treason and in May 1685 he was found guilty of participation in the 1683 conspiracy and his lands were forfeited.<br>
<br>A member of the inner circle that planned Argyll's ill-fated rebellion, Cochrane attended the meeting that harmonized the manifestos of Monmouth and Argyll in April 1685. Before sailing with Argyll, he left letters to Scottish officers in German armies asking them to report to Amsterdam for service in the earl's cause. Argyll dispatched Cochrane and his troops to south-western Scotland, where they enjoyed some success before Cochrane dismissed them after learning of the earl's defeat. The government issued a proclamation for his arrest on 24 June, and by 1 July he was in custody; the wife of his uncle Gavin Cochrane had turned him in because Cochrane's troops had killed her brother during the rebellion. On 3 July the hangman led Cochrane and his son to Edinburgh's Tolbooth, bound and bare-headed. According to Burnet, Dundonald offered &#145;the priests&#146; &pound;5000 to save his son; a deal was struck whereby Cochrane would confess only to James, who had a yacht transport him to London in August. He reputedly told the king about meetings with the elector of Brandenburg and William of Orange, though the latter subsequently denied having met Cochrane. He also provided information against Sir Hugh and Sir George Campbell, Lord Stair, William Spence, and others. Both Cochranes were pardoned and released from the Tower in October 1685.<br>
<br>The government employed Cochrane in 1687 to negotiate with Scottish presbyterians about an indulgence for themselves and Catholics, but he did not recover his estates until 1689. Cochrane and the minister Robert Ferguson were imprisoned on 5 June 1690 for misprision of treason and treasonable activities because of their association with Sir James Montgomerie. Cochrane survived to become a farmer of the poll tax in 1693, but he failed to provide a satisfactory account of his receipts and, with three other offenders, was incarcerated by 3 September 1695. The date of his death is not known.<br>
