<span class="headword">Crichton,  William</span>  (1733&#150;1782), <span class="occ">merchant and politician</span>, was the son of Patrick Crichton, a saddler and merchant of Edinburgh. Details of Crichton's early life and career cannot be established with any great certainty but it is likely that he was the William Crichton who entered an apprenticeship as a goldsmith with Dougal Ged of Edinburgh in 1752. In the 1750s and 1760s several Crichtons, most notably David Crichton, a merchant and insurer of Heydon Square, Minories, were active in trade in London and this no doubt assisted in the establishment of William Crichton in business in the capital by 1765. At first he was located at Nag's Head Court, but by 1774 he had moved to Brabant Court, Philpot Lane.<br>
<br>Crichton's main line of business was the West Indies trade but he diversified his activities to include the purchase of property in Edinburgh and London, marine insurance broking, lending on mortgage, and investment in stocks and securities. The last activity provided him with an entry into City politics, for the purchase of &pound;500 of East India Company stock in September 1767 allowed him to take a leading part in company affairs during a critical phase in the development of British India. In the four years before the passage of Lord North's <span class="roman">Regulating Act</span> of 1773, Crichton made more recorded speeches than any other stockholder at the company's general court of proprietors. This earned him the nickname Orator Crichton from one observer, but others complained that his repeated and lengthy interventions served only to test the patience of those who were trying to steer the company through difficult times. As a self-appointed watchdog over the company's affairs, Crichton played a leading part in exposing financial malpractice among the directors of the company in 1773.<br>
<br>Of much wider significance, however, was the fact that Crichton suggested in January 1773 that the company might look to Europe and North America for a market where it could dispose of the ever-increasing stockpiles of tea that were being stored in its London warehouses. Crichton's specific proposal for the removal of the duty on tea imported into North America prompted lengthy debate within the company and the House of Commons but it was not endorsed by the North ministry for political reasons. In the event, the alternative arrangements that were put in place by the government alongside the highly unpopular Townshend duty served only to increase tension in the colonies. The colonists believed that taxed tea was to be forced upon them by the British and consequently a consignment of company tea was dumped into Boston harbour during the course of the events known as the Boston Tea Party. This set in motion the chain of events that eventually led to the outbreak of hostilities between Britain and her American colonies in 1775.<br>
<br>Although he never became a director of the East India Company, Crichton continued to play a leading role in company affairs until the time of his death in 1782. At the same time, he broadened the range of his public activities. He served on several charitable committees, helped to promote the interests of West Indies merchants as they attempted to overcome the difficulties caused by the American War of Independence, and he was appointed to office in a number of different institutions. This kept him in the public eye and he was able to develop a broad base of political support in the City where, as a member of the Company of Fishmongers, he was made a freeman in January 1775. In September 1780, following the death of John Kirkman, Crichton was elected alderman of Cheap ward and shortly afterwards he became one of the two sheriffs of the City of London. His one-year term of office was eventful because it coincided with the Gordon riots, and Crichton found himself with responsibility for the control of public order. He was widely praised for his handling of a difficult situation, and this served to raise his political stock even higher in the City. Indeed, had it not been for the fact that as sheriff he was electoral returning officer and thus debarred from declaring himself as a candidate, Crichton would have stood for election as member of parliament for the City following the death of George Hayley in August 1781.<br>
<br>Crichton's personal life appears to have been as colourful as his public life. By the time he wrote his will in July 1774, his relationship with Ann Jeffries had produced a son (Robert Crichton), while Esther Stokes had given birth to two daughters (Anna and Henrietta Crichton) and was expecting a third child. In spite of this, Crichton's will stated that he was about to marry Priscilla, whose surname was probably Warriner, a widow of Great Baddow in Essex. A codicil added to the will indicates that he did indeed marry Mrs Warriner because her son, John, was granted income from a trust fund as part of a legacy of &pound;1000 destined to be left to him by Crichton. Crichton died as a widower on 30 July 1782 at Chillingham Barns, Northumberland, having become ill during a journey on horseback to London from Edinburgh where his brother, Alexander, lived and worked as a coachmaker.<br>
