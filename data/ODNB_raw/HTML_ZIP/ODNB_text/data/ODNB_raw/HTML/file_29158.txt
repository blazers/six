<span class="headword">Whalley,  George Hammond</span>  (1813&#150;1878), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 23 January 1813, the eldest son of James Whalley, a merchant and banker of Gloucester, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Morse, of Gurshill, Blakeney, Gloucestershire. He was a descendant of Edward Whalley, the regicide. He was educated at University College, London, where he gained first prizes in rhetoric and metaphysics, and entered Gray's Inn in 1835, being called to the bar in 1839. From 1836 to 1847 he was an assistant tithe commissioner, writing weekly articles on tithe commutation in the <span class="italic">Justice of the Peace</span> between 1838 and 1842. He published two treatises on the <span class="roman">Tithe Acts</span> in 1838 and 1839, which were consolidated and enlarged as <span class="italic">The Tithe Act and the Whole of the Tithe Amendment Acts</span> (1848, 6th edn 1896).<br>
<br>On 25 January 1846, at Brighton, Whalley married Anne Wakeford, the daughter of Richard Attree of Selborne, Hampshire; they had a son and two daughters. During the Irish famine of 1847 he established fisheries on the west coast of Ireland, exploring in his yacht the location of fishery banks. Resident at Plas Madog, Ruabon, Denbighshire, he was high sheriff of Caernarvonshire in 1852, a deputy lieutenant of Denbighshire, and a captain of the Denbighshire yeomanry.<br>
<br>Whalley's national significance lies in his parliamentary career and in his defence of protestantism. He unsuccessfully contested Leominster in 1845 and Montgomery in 1852, but was returned for Peterborough as a Liberal on 6 December 1852. He was unseated on petition in 1853, but was again returned on 30 April 1859 at the general election, and retained his seat until his death. A low-church Anglican, Whalley accepted in the spring of 1861 an invitation from prominent ultra-protestants to lead the parliamentary campaign against Roman Catholicism, taking up the burden left by the ailing Richard Spooner MP (1788&#150;1864). His particular objective was to abolish the annual state grant to Maynooth College, the Catholic seminary in Ireland. Britain, he argued, was paying for the creation of ultramontane priests whose goal was to transform protestant Britain into a citadel of &#145;popery&#146;. His motions in 1861, 1862, and 1863 for a committee to consider repeal of the grant were all defeated, and he experienced increasing difficulty in making his anti-Catholic tirades heard amid the vociferous opposition of Irish MPs. In 1866 he claimed to have evidence that Vatican machinations had caused the defeat of British troops in New Zealand, that Cardinal Cullen, the Irish primate, intended to place a Stuart pretender on the throne of England, and that the pope had taken control of the British artillery corps, the police, the telegraph office, and railway companies. In 1871 he feared that the prime minister, Gladstone, had joined the Church of Rome. He became a supporter of the Tichborne claimant, and as a result of a letter which he wrote to the newspapers on the case he was fined &pound;250 by Lord Chief Justice Cockburn for contempt of court (23 January 1874) and imprisoned in Holloway gaol for refusing to pay. The fine was paid by Whalley's sister on the following day.<br>
<br>Whalley died at Trevor Tower, Llangollen, Denbighshire on 8 October 1878. His son, George Hampden Whalley (<i>b</i>. 1851), was MP for Peterborough in 1880&#150;83. A lecture delivered by Whalley at Peterborough about 1860, <span class="italic">Early British History: Ecclesiastical and Secular</span>, which drew an analogy between St Augustine's mission and the re-establishment in 1850 of the Catholic hierarchy in Britain, with Cardinal Wiseman at its head, was published at Hove in 1922.<br>
