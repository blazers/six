</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stewart,  David, of Garth</span>  (1772&#150;1829), <span class="occ">army officer and writer on the Scottish highlanders</span>, was the second son of Robert Stewart of Garth, Perthshire, and was descended from James Stewart (son of the Wolf of Badenoch, one of the many bastard children of Robert II) who built the castle of Garth at the end of the fourteenth century. His family had been Jacobite, and his maternal grandfather was killed at Culloden. Stewart was given a commission as ensign in the 77th (Atholl highlanders) on 21 April 1783, but they were disbanded soon afterwards. He joined the 42nd highlanders (the Black Watch) on 10 August 1787, became lieutenant on 8 August 1792, and captain-lieutenant on 24 June 1796. After serving with the 42nd in Flanders in 1794 he went with it to the West Indies in October 1795. He took part in the capture of St Lucia and St Vincent, and in the prolonged bush-fighting with the Caribs. He was also in the unsuccessful expedition against Puerto Rico in 1797.<br>
<br>Stewart returned to Europe with the 42nd, was in garrison at Gibraltar, and embarked there with the expedition for the recovery of Minorca in November 1798. He was taken prisoner at sea, and was detained for five months in Spain before he was exchanged. He went to Egypt with Abercromby's expedition, and was severely wounded at the battle of Alexandria on 21 March 1801. On 15 December 1800 he had obtained a company in the 90th (Perthshire volunteers), but he returned to the 42nd on 23 July 1802. Stewart obtained a majority in the 78th highlanders (later the Seaforth Highlanders) on 17 April 1804 by raising recruits for the 2nd battalion then being formed, a feat made easy by his popularity in the highlands. His men were so attached to him that when he was at Shorncliffe in the following year Sir John Moore intervened to prevent his being sent to India to join the 1st battalion. He went with the 2nd battalion to the Mediterranean in September 1805, and took part in the descent on Calabria. At Maida, on 4 July 1806, he commanded a battalion of light companies, and was again severely wounded. He was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the West India rangers on 21 April 1808, and took part in the capture of Guadeloupe in 1810. He received a medal with one clasp for this and Maida, and in 1815 he was made CB. He was promoted colonel in the army on 4 June 1814, and in 1815 was placed on half pay.<br>
<br>A traditionalist, praised by his friend Sir Walter Scott as &#145;honest Garth &hellip; a highlander of the old stamp&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 10.468), Stewart was of &#145;gentle compassion and integrity of opinion, a small, weak-sighted man&#146;  (Prebble, 33). He was committed to the highlanders, and opposed to &#145;the cruel and oppressive system of landlords&#146;  (ibid., 34) and their clearances.<br>
<br>In 1817 the officer commanding the Black Watch asked him for information on its history, as its records had been lost. The reminiscences and enquiries started by this request developed into Stewart's <span class="italic">Sketches of the character, manners, and present state of the highlanders of Scotland: with details of the military service of the highland regiments</span> (2 vols., 1822; facsimile reprint 1977 with a coloured map of the clans). This book, &#145;whose excellence shines forth on every page&#146;, was the foundation of later works on the clans. The first two parts, on the country and people, occupy about half the first volume; the remainder provides annals of Scottish regiments, including fencible regiments. Among its subjects were highland dress and bagpipes. Against the opinion that trews were the ancient highland garb, and plaid and kilt modern innovations, he insisted that &#145;the truis, <i>breachan-na-feal</i> (the kilted plaid), and philibeg, have ever been the dress of the Highlanders&#146;  (Stewart, 2.xxii). He also stated that bagpipes should be played in the open air: &#145;Playing the bagpipes within doors is a Lowland and English custom&#146;  (ibid., xxiii). The book sold well, was reprinted, and brought Stewart modest fame and a reputation as the authority on the highlanders. Although, on advice, he had not fully expressed his abhorrence of the treatment of the highlanders, parts were controversial. <span class="italic">Remarks on Colonel Stewart's Sketches of the Highlanders</span> (1823) admitted the book's general merits, but alleged it was in parts inaccurate, and objected to its Jacobite sympathies. Stewart had thoughts of writing a history of the 1745 rising but gave it up. In 1820 he founded the Celtic Society of Edinburgh, whose first object was to promote the wearing of the ancient highland dress in the highlands; they wore highland dress in Edinburgh. He contributed, with Sir Walter Scott and others, to changing attitudes to the highlanders and Scottish history and tradition, and to the growing &#145;highlandism&#146;. Some late-twentieth-century historians have seen them as &#145;inventing tradition&#146;, an allegation Stewart would surely have rejected as indignantly as he did the claim that the kilt had been invented by an Englishman.<br>
<br>Soon after publishing his book, on the death of his simple elder brother, Stewart succeeded to the estate of Garth, impoverished by the incapacity of his father and of his elder brother. Before and during George IV's visit to Edinburgh in August 1822, Stewart helped Sir Walter Scott with the arrangements, headed the Celtic Society in the procession&#151;Lockhart wrote of his &#145;Toy-Captainship&#146;&#151;adjusted the royal plaid for the lev&eacute;e, and pronounced the king &#145;a vera pretty man&#146;. He was promoted major-general on 27 May 1825, and in 1829 he went out to St Lucia in the Windward Islands, as governor. St Lucia was very unhealthy; in little over four years, from 1829 to 1834, four governors died at Government House (known as the Pavilion), Morne Fortun&eacute; near Castries. On 18 December Stewart died there, probably of malaria; he was buried in Castries. Stewart was widely regretted; he was unmarried, and had illegitimate children.<br>
