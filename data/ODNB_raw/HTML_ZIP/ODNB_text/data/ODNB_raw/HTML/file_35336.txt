<span class="headword">Osborne,  Walter Frederick</span>  (1859&#150;1903), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 17 June 1859 at 6 Cornish Terrace, Rathmines, Dublin, the second of the three children of William Osborne RHA (1823&#150;1901), an animal painter, and his wife, Anne Jane Woods, of O'Brien's Bridge, co. Clare. He was educated at Rathmines (Benson's) School (1870&#150;75), in the schools of the Royal Hibernian Academy, Dublin (1876&#150;81), and at the Koninklijke Academie voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp (1881&#150;3). In Antwerp he encountered the realist painting of French and Netherlandish artists, and the teaching of Charles Verlat at the academy introduced him to vigorous brushwork and bold colour. His small sketch <span class="italic">Moderke verhoft</span> (<i>c</i>.1882, National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin) is a good example of his developing style&#151;a peasant-genre subject painted from life, boldly executed, and with accents of vivid colour. Among his classmates were a number of English students who were to become part of the British naturalist school to which the first half of his career belongs, and he met others in Brittany in 1883. Like them, he came under the influence of the French naturalist painter Jules Bastien-Lepage and for a time adopted his painting technique and grey-green palette.<br>
<br>After Brittany Osborne's life followed a pattern of winters spent in Dublin at his parents' house, 5 Castlewood Avenue, Rathmines, and the rest of the year in small villages in England with a few like-minded artists, painting landscape and rural genre scenes. His most characteristic pieces include children and animals and combine careful underlying drawing with painterly surfaces and sensitive colour. <span class="italic">An October Morning</span> (1885, corporation of London, Barbican) shows the beach and pier at Walberswick, Suffolk, and <span class="italic">Cherry Ripe</span> (exh. Institute of Painters in Oil Colours, London, 1889&#150;90; Ulster Museum, Belfast), carefully put together from preparatory sketches and even a photograph, is set in the High Street at Rye, Sussex. Although he worked in remote rural areas, Osborne did not isolate himself. He made regular visits to the London galleries and sent work to exhibitions in London, Liverpool, and Birmingham. Throughout this time he was also actively involved in Dublin life. From 1877 he exhibited annually with the Royal Hibernian Academy and became an academician in 1886.<br>
<br>In the early 1890s family circumstances obliged Osborne to spend more time in Ireland. He lived at 5 Castlewood Avenue and, from 1895, had a large studio at 7 St Stephen's Green. He began to paint Dublin street life, especially the area of old Dublin around St Patrick's Cathedral, as in <span class="italic">Life in the Streets: Musicians</span> (1893, Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery of Modern Art, Dublin). <span class="italic">In a Dublin Park: Light and Shade</span> (exh. RA, 1895; National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin) is confident, broadly painted, and shows a preoccupation with rendering the effects of light which owes something to French impressionism. <span class="italic">The Lustre Jug</span> (exh. New English Art Club, 1901; National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin) is even more adventurous, the light from the small window being expressed in vivid touches of iridescent colour.<br>
<br>During the last ten years of his life Osborne turned increasingly to portrait painting&#151;responsibility for the support of his parents and niece fell heavily on him, and portraits sold better than genre or landscape. One of his most successful was <span class="italic">Mrs Noel Guinness and her Daughter Margaret</span> (1898, priv. coll., Dublin), which won him a bronze medal at the Paris Universal Exhibition in 1900. While he kept up his connections outside Ireland, he was an active member of the lively Dublin cultural life of the period. Most of his friends were artists and writers, but he had a much wider acquaintance, and was a welcome visitor in many houses. Tall and athletic-looking, he bicycled round Dublin and was a keen cricketer. In town he dressed like a lawyer or a doctor, though he allowed himself to look more like an artist in the country. He never married, prevented, apparently, by his family responsibilities and lack of money. Held in great affection by a wide circle of friends and venerated by his students, he was considered to be Ireland's most distinguished artist, with a growing reputation abroad, when he died of pneumonia on 24 April 1903 at 5 Castlewood Avenue. He was buried in Mount Jerome cemetery, Harold's Cross, Dublin. The National Gallery of Ireland and the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery of Modern Art, both in Dublin, have his paintings and drawings in their collections; the National Gallery of Ireland also holds his annotated sketchbooks.<br>
