</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">O'Brien,  Murrough</span>, first earl of Inchiquin  (<em>c.</em>1614&#150;1674), <span class="occ">nobleman and army officer</span>, was the eldest son of Dermod O'Brien, fifth Baron Inchiquin (1594&#150;1624), and his wife, Ellen, eldest daughter of Sir Edmond Fitzgerald of Cloyne.<h2>
<a name="Ancestrywardshipandmarriage"></a>Ancestry, wardship, and marriage</h2>Murrough O'Brien's ancestry was distinguished on both sides. The O'Briens claimed descent from the earliest kings of Ireland, and the family name was derived from the eleventh-century king Brian Boru, who died at the battle of Clontarf in 1014. On his mother's side Inchiquin was from Anglo-Norman stock, and was a descendant of the earls of Desmond. The patrimonial estates were concentrated in counties Clare and Limerick&#151;traditional strongholds of the O'Briens of Thomond and the Fitzgeralds of Desmond, respectively&#151;but the accidents of heredity had greatly reduced their value to the young baron. His grandfather Murrough, the fourth baron, had succeeded as a minor, and on his death at Erne in July 1597 (fighting for Elizabeth I) left a two-year-old heir; the fifth baron had died aged thirty, and Murrough came to the title at about the age of ten, in 1624. This succession of minors inevitably created a series of wardships, as well as the removal of jointure lands by surviving dowagers; both helped to weaken the family estate&#151;a situation which afflicted many other Gaelic and Old English families at this time, most notably the earls of Kildare.<br>
<br>Like his contemporary George Fitzgerald, sixteenth earl of Kildare, Inchiquin soon found himself subject to government policies which encouraged the acquisition of Catholic wardships by eminent protestant settlers, who were to bring up the young nobles in the new faith and as loyal vassals of the crown. At first Inchiquin's wardship was held by an Old English protestant, Patrick Fitzmaurice, baron of Kerry and Lixnaw, but in February 1632 Charles I gave the estate to the president of Munster, Sir William St Leger. As well as continuing his protestant upbringing, St Leger seems to have intended a programme of investment in Inchiquin's estates, reclaiming mortgages and securing titles in much the same way as Richard Boyle, first earl of Cork, tried to strengthen the earls of Kildare and Barrymore in the same period. As with Cork, the keystone of St Leger's plan was the marriage of the native lord with his own daughter, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1685), and the wedding took place in October 1635&#151;nine months before the king gave Inchiquin livery of his lands on 23 June 1636. The birth of a son and heir in winter 1637&#150;8 was important not only to the St Legers but also to the protestant community in Munster. The child, named William after his grandfather, was christened at the St Leger seat of Doneraile in January 1638, and his godparents were Sir William St Leger and the earl of Cork, as well as Cork's daughter, Alice, countess of Barrymore.<br>
<br>A later writer referred to Inchiquin as &#145;the ingrafted, inoculated and artificial scion taken from that venerable old stock&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egmont MSS</span>, 1.191), and there is no doubt that his relationship with St Leger was very close indeed. It may have been at St Leger's behest that Inchiquin went abroad (presumably in early 1638) to gain military experience with the Spanish forces in Italy. Inchiquin had returned to Ireland by the beginning of 1640, taking his seat in the Irish House of Lords in the parliament which met in March of that year. On 2 April, in a further sign of St Leger's trust, Inchiquin was made vice-president of Munster. This promotion may have contributed to the decline in relations between the president and the earl of Cork, which had started in the late 1630s. Cork was concerned at St Leger's increasing influence in the province, and his suspicions were further aroused by reports that the president &#145;tides too much with the Irish&#146;  (NL Ire., MS 12813/579)&#151;possibly a reference to the growing importance of Inchiquin in the Munster council. This importance, and the tensions which it created, grew markedly with the outbreak of the Irish rising in October 1641.<h2>
<a name="MunsterandtheIrishrisingto1644"></a>Munster and the Irish rising to 1644</h2>As president of Munster, St Leger had command of the protestant forces there, but he could do little without the co-operation of the earl of Cork, the wealthiest and most influential landowner in the province. At first the two men agreed to bury their differences, and Inchiquin soon came to the fore as one of the few protestant officers with previous military experience. In April 1642, for example, he led a counter-attack against the Catholic forces under Donough MacCarthy, Viscount Muskerry, who were besieging Cork, forcing them to withdraw from the area. In July 1642 St Leger died after a short illness, but he had already passed orders giving the management of the province to a council of war dominated by his allies, including Inchiquin. With St Leger's death, Inchiquin tried to stage a coup against Cork and his sons, but the ploy was foiled by the lords justices in Dublin, who instead opted to give joint control of civilian affairs to Inchiquin and Cork's son-in-law, David Fitz-David Barry, earl of Barrymore. Inchiquin remained commander of the government forces in Munster. Despite continuing tensions, this arrangement seems to have worked, and Inchiquin's victory over Richard Butler, Lord Mountgarret, at the battle of Liscarrol in September 1642 was achieved with the full support of the Boyle family. The victory had divisive results, however. Barrymore was mortally wounded, and when he died civilian power became concentrated in Inchiquin's hands. Furthermore, after lobbying by Inchiquin's agents in England, on 29 September parliament promoted Inchiquin to be captain-general of Munster. In response the Boyles went on the offensive, with Cork accusing the vice-president of colluding with the confederate Catholics, insinuating that he was &#145;unnecessarily cordial to his popish cousins in the Irish camp&#146;  (D. Townsend, <span class="italic">The Life and Letters of the Great Earl of Cork</span>, 1904, 413). In November 1642 Cork's sons Richard and Roger Boyle, Lord Dungarvan and Lord Broghill, were sent to London in an attempt to discredit Inchiquin, and in the hope of having one of the Boyles appointed to the vacant presidency of Munster. Their failure to achieve either goal may have been the result of lobbying by Inchiquin's main ally in parliament, William Jephson, whose own &#145;cousins&#146; at Westminster included John Pym and Arthur Goodwin.<br>
<br>The factionalism in Munster in 1642&#150;3 was not the only factor weakening the protestant position there. With the onset of the civil war in England, the willingness of the king or parliament to provide men, money, and supplies for Ireland was greatly reduced. As Inchiquin told the earl of Ormond in December 1642, the English were &#145;so involved in their own danger that a word of Ireland will not be heard&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 4, fol. 83<i>r</i>). In the next nine months the crisis deepened, and Inchiquin, with other commanders, was forced to take Ormond's lead and sign a cessation of arms with the confederates in September 1643. Apart from relieving the immediate pressures of supply, the cessation was designed to release troops to reinforce the king's armies in England, and over the next few months Inchiquin sent five regiments across the Irish Sea. As a result, Inchiquin was indicted in November 1643 for treason by the English parliament. In recompense he hoped that the king would confirm his position in Munster by making him lord president, and in January 1644 he travelled to the royal court at Oxford to claim his reward. Arriving there on 10 February he discovered that the king had already promised the presidency to an outsider: Jerome Weston, second earl of Portland. Worse still, there were rumours that Lord Dungarvan (now second earl of Cork) was negotiating to buy the office from Portland. Although Portland eventually refused to sell the presidency, the damage had been done. As one commentator told Ormond on 19 February, &#145;Lord Inchiquin is returning as full of anger as his buttons will endure&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 9, fol. 243). In his absence, Inchiquin's reputation at Oxford received another blow, with allegations by the confederate agents (including Viscount Muskerry) that he was already &#145;rather for the Parliament than the king's cause&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 11, fol. 214). This climate of distrust was exacerbated by local tensions in Munster, where the protestants felt increasingly under pressure from the confederates, who refused to abide by the terms of the cessation of arms. The flashpoint came in July, when news broke of a conspiracy by the Irish to seize Cork and the other protestant towns. Inchiquin responded by expelling all Catholics from the towns, and, fearing reprisals, put his forces on a war footing. With his confidence in the king and his policies already diminished, there seemed only one chance for the Munster protestants; and on 17 July 1644 Inchiquin and his officers wrote to parliament announcing their rejection of the cessation, and their abandonment of the king's cause.<h2>
<a name="ParliamentslordpresidentofMunster16441648"></a>Parliament's lord president of Munster, 1644&#150;1648</h2>If Inchiquin thought the defection to parliament would solve his immediate military problems, he was very much mistaken. With the English civil war still raging, there were few resources available for Munster, and every shipload had to be wrung out of the parliamentarian authorities with intensive lobbying. In one respect Inchiquin got what he wanted from Westminster&#151;in January 1645 he was appointed parliament's lord president of Munster&#151;but even that promotion lacked the royal authority needed to command the loyalty of the province. In the three years after the defection, from summer 1644 until summer 1647, Inchiquin could only play a defensive role in the Irish war; and it was only the incompetence of the confederates which prevented the Munster enclave from being overrun. These local tensions provided the ground base for the factionalism which soon re-emerged among the Munster protestants, and which once again focused on Inchiquin's feud with the Boyle family. The leadership of the Boyle interest in Munster had shifted in 1644, with Roger, Lord Broghill, taking over from his brother, Richard, second earl of Cork, who remained in England. Indeed, Broghill rejected his brother's royalism, and joined Inchiquin's defection to parliament in July 1644. This amity with Inchiquin did not last, however, and by the end of the year serious disagreements had again emerged between the two factions.<br>
<br>The causes of hatred between the two men were various. First, Inchiquin's relations with the Irish and with the royalists at Dublin were far more equivocal than Broghill's. By September 1644 Inchiquin, starved of funds by parliament, had started to explore <i>ad hoc</i> cessations with the local confederates, and in the winter made a deal with Viscount Muskerry, which lasted until spring 1645. He was even in contact with James Touchet, third earl of Castlehaven, during the latter's campaign against the Munster protestants in the next few months. Equally, although publicly rejecting the king, Inchiquin continued to correspond with his lord lieutenant, the marquess of Ormond. In June 1645 Inchiquin employed his brother-in-law, Dean Michael Boyle, to travel to Dublin to negotiate with Ormond, and told the bishop of Cloyne that he was willing to contemplate joining a final peace settlement between the royalists and the confederates. Broghill, who trusted that parliament could be persuaded to fund the Irish war, rejected any peace initiatives with the confederates, and condemned Ormond for his dealings with them. The seizure of letters in July 1645, revealing royalist hopes that Inchiquin could be persuaded to rejoin the king, hardened Broghill's hostility towards the president.<br>
<br>The second cause of disagreement between the two was religion. While Broghill and his friends were convinced of the need for the solemn league and covenant to be taken by the Munster soldiers, Inchiquin was less enthusiastic, not least because the royalists treated subscription to it as proof of disloyalty. In a list of Irish protestants who had taken the covenant (drawn up in April 1645) Inchiquin is conspicuous by his absence  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 14, fol. 425). While Broghill was becoming increasingly hardline in his attitudes, Inchiquin remained attached to the Church of Ireland. He protected the clergy within the Munster garrisons, and protested to Cloyne in 1645 that his attachment to parliament was merely pragmatic:<blockquote>I do profess that I do earnestly desire the continuance of the same government in the church that we have hitherto had, yet I doubt there is no possibility to enjoy the liberty of our religion of this kingdom, but by adhering to those who as yet pretend to pull down episcopacy, which in that cause I could much rather tolerate. (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 63, fol. 341<i>v</i>)</blockquote>A third cause of tension between Inchiquin and Broghill was the increasing convergence of Irish and English politics. The emergence in England of two &#145;parties&#146; during 1644 and 1645&#151;known as the &#145;presbyterians&#146; and &#145;Independents&#146;&#151;encouraged the existing factions within the Irish protestant community to align themselves with one side or the other. Inchiquin, in part reacting to Broghill's connections with the Independents, grew closer to the presbyterians. Inchiquin's friends at Westminster included Irish presbyterians such as William Jephson, Sir Robert King, and Sir Philip Perceval; and he, with Ormond, became a key player in attempts by the English presbyterian leadership to promote a &#145;British&#146; solution to Ireland, involving Irish royalists and the Ulster Scots as well as English troops loyal to parliament. The appointment of a Star Chamber committee of Irish affairs in July 1645, created and dominated by William Jephson, Sir John Clotworthy, and their allies, at last promised to take Munster seriously, and through the winter there were efforts to raise men and send money to Inchiquin's beleaguered garrisons. Yet the presbyterian ascendancy was short-lived, and the Independents soon came to control Irish affairs. The appointment of the Independent peer Philip Sidney, Viscount Lisle, as parliament's lord lieutenant in April 1646 widened the rift between Inchiquin and Broghill. Lisle challenged Ormond's authority, and his policies were from the start hostile to Inchiquin. The new Irish committee soon fell into Independent hands; plans were advanced to give Broghill an independent command in Munster; and a concerted propaganda campaign undermined the president's authority and questioned his allegiance. Inchiquin went to London to defend his position, but to no avail. In February 1647 Lisle crossed to Munster and took control of the province from his deputy, in a move condemned by Inchiquin as having &#145;the semblance rather of a conquest than of relief&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egmont MSS</span>, 1.367&#150;8). In matters of policy Lisle deferred to Broghill, who, as Inchiquin bemoaned, was now &#145;commanding all things at his pleasure, so as my lord lieutenant puts the execution of my place in effect into his hands&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egmont MSS</span>, 1.380). Inchiquin's officers were replaced, his troops dispersed, and his advice ignored. It was only as a result of factional changes in England, and the seizure of power by the presbyterians in the new year of 1647, that Inchiquin's position began to improve. Lisle's year-long commission was not renewed and in April, Inchiquin, assisted by soldiers still loyal to him, forced the former lieutenant and his entourage to return to England.<br>
<br>The departure of Lisle left Inchiquin in charge of Munster, but it did not bring his troubles to an end. Broghill, assisted by his brother-in-law Sir Arthur Loftus, with the encouragement of Sir John Temple and other Irish Independents, spent much of the summer trying to blacken Inchiquin's name. A mark of their success was Inchiquin's inclusion in the articles presented against the eleven members in June, saying that the presbyterians had deliberately suppressed charges of high treason against the president. Inchiquin was accused of harbouring papists, of allowing mass to be said publicly, and of plotting to join the confederates. He was also attacked for his ethnic background. Ignoring his claims that his Irishness was &#145;my misfortune, not my fault&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egmont MSS</span>, 1.377), his enemies repeatedly linked ethnicity with disloyalty, characterizing Inchiquin as &#145;an Irish general&#146; and one of the &#145;natural Irish&#146;, and thus not to be trusted  (&#145;A letter from Lieutenant Colonel Knight in the province of Munster&#146;, 22 July 1647, BL, E.399(23), pp. 4, 12).<br>
<br>Inchiquin's position in summer 1647 was further undermined by the departure of Ormond, who had surrendered Dublin to parliament under articles signed in June, and left Ireland in July; and by the dramatic failure of the presbyterians to stage a coup at Westminster&#151;an attempt which, in early August, brought the Independents back to power in the wake of the New Model Army's march on London. Irish affairs at Westminster were again under the control of Broghill and his Independent friends, and the prospects for Inchiquin looked bleak. His response was to go on the offensive. If he could not defeat his critics in London he could strengthen his position in Munster, and this he proceeded to do, launching a major campaign into counties Waterford and Tipperary. During summer 1647 he had captured Dungarvan and Cappoquin, and by September was marching north-east, probably intending a strike against the confederate capital at Kilkenny. Lack of artillery meant that the advance came to a halt before Clonmel by the end of the month, but <i>en route</i> Inchiquin had taken the Rock of Cashel, where his troops massacred the defenders and desecrated the cathedral. In this bold campaign Inchiquin seems to have had two intentions: to create <i>Lebensraum</i> for his soldiers, securing control over a wider area in an effort to make them independent of outside resources; and to demonstrate to parliament and to the Irish protestants that he was still committed to their cause. For the Irish, however, his main intention seemed to be to shed blood and commit sacrilege. In the eyes of the ordinary people he became infamous as Murchadh na dT&oacute;ite&aacute;n, or Murrough of the Burnings; and to the clergy he was &#145;the most hateful enemy of the Catholic religion&#146;  (Murphy, &#145;Inchiquin's changes of religion&#146;, 62). Alarmed by Inchiquin's victories, the confederate council ordered their Munster commander, Theobald Taaffe, Viscount Taaffe, to advance on the Munster ports. Inchiquin met him at Knocknanuss, near Mallow in co. Cork, on 13 November. With a smaller force he attacked the confederate army and routed it, killing 4000 men.<br>
<br>Despite Inchiquin's military successes, he was increasingly marginalized by the English parliamentarians during winter 1647&#150;8. This was caused by a general lack of interest in Irish affairs at Westminster once Dublin had been secured in July 1647, compounded by the influence over the dominant Independent faction enjoyed by Inchiquin's enemies, including Lord Broghill. The immediate effect was a reduction in the amount of money and supplies allowed to the president. In January 1648 Inchiquin complained to Speaker Lenthall that he could not control enough territory to feed his existing forces, and asked for support from England or, failing that, permission to send some of his English troops home and to make conditions with the confederates &#145;for the rest of the wretched English who cannot remove hence with their families, but must submit to a worse than Egyptian or Turkish servitude&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 1.443&#150;4). Such appeals grew stronger over the next few months&#151;as did Inchiquin's alarm at events in England, where the Independents and the army seemed intent on forcing radical changes to the government and religion. These two factors pushed Inchiquin into signing a truce with the confederate forces in Munster, agreed in April and ratified in May 1648.<h2>
<a name="Royalistgeneral16481650"></a>Royalist general, 1648&#150;1650</h2>In signing the truce Inchiquin had rejected parliament and returned to his allegiance to the king; yet in doing so his focus was not on high politics, but on the practicalities of keeping his army together. His first move was to purge the officer corps. This was designed to bring the Munster army firmly under his control, and thus emphasize its importance as the most experienced&#151;and most successful&#151;protestant army in Ireland. The purge also gave him high-profile hostages, including Sir William Fenton, Colonel Edmund Temple, and Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Phayre, who could be used as a possible bargaining tool with parliament&#151;a point made all the more important by the presence of Inchiquin's own son and heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20469/', "William O'Brien, Lord O'Brien")</script>, in prison in London. Beyond this it is uncertain how far Inchiquin planned to go. Although there were fears that he planned an amphibious assault on Cornwall in support of the English insurgents, and rumours that he was in league with the confederates and the Scots, there is little evidence that Inchiquin could afford the luxury of thinking in &#145;British&#146; terms in the summer of 1648. At this stage the most pressing need was to secure his truce with the confederates and to gain much-needed supplies for his men, many of whom &#145;have died of hunger, after they had a while lived upon cats and dogs as many do now&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, 6.550).<br>
<br>While Inchiquin was concentrating on his immediate problems in Munster, his truce was having dramatic consequences at Kilkenny. The agreement, ratified by the supreme council on 20 May 1648, finally destroyed the uneasy relationship between the papal nuncio, Cardinal Rinuccini, and the Old English. A week later, the nuncio declared his opposition to the cessation and threatened to excommunicate anyone subscribing to it. With that, he fled to the Ulster forces of Owen Roe O'Neill, currently occupying western Leinster. The split ensured that any future peace treaty would not involve a large part of the Catholic forces in Ireland, and would thereby prevent an army being sent to aid Charles I in the other kingdoms. Inchiquin, from a purely local standpoint, greeted the breakdown of the confederate alliance not as a disaster, but as an opportunity. On 15 July he wrote to the parliamentarian commander Michael Jones at Dublin, urging him to make his own truce, and to join the king. In turn Jones invited Inchiquin to return to parliament. Inchiquin soon recovered from the rebuff. Armed with a new commission as lord president of Munster (sent from the prince of Wales on 2 July), he prepared for a new royalist offensive, and urged Ormond to return from the continent. Ormond's arrival at Cork, on 2 October, provided Inchiquin with much-needed supplies, and allowed a combined campaign with the Catholic forces under Ulick de Burgh, earl of Clanricarde, against O'Neill's men in Leinster.<br>
<br>But Inchiquin's renewed optimism was soon dented by news of a mutiny within the Munster garrisons. This was not so much a protest about pay and conditions as a reflection of deep-seated concerns among the officers that Inchiquin was to strike a deal with the Catholics which would threaten their religion. The leaders of the mutiny soon made contact with Jones and even O'Neill, and parliament sent agents to try to stir up discontent, including Inchiquin's former hostage Edmund Temple. The mutiny was put down with little trouble, but its effects were important. First, it cast doubt on Inchiquin's value as an ally to the confederates, and, according to Ormond, set back the peace negotiations by a precious few weeks. It also reduced the ability of the royalists to plan a concerted campaign across the three kingdoms, despite Inchiquin's hope that the presbyterians in England might be persuaded to rebel once more. Worse still, Ormond was forced to ask the prince of Wales to withdraw his fleet to the Munster coast, to prevent further trouble. The level of discontent is revealed by Inchiquin's insistence that the Church of Ireland clergy sign a declaration of loyalty (on 5 January 1649), and promise not to preach against the royalist cause. Inchiquin remained nervous even after the execution of the king, which had forced agreement in Ireland (under the second Ormond peace) and demanded a vigorous response. In February 1649 he feared the growing tensions between protestants and Catholics in Munster and was advised by the confederates once again to purge his army. There were also concerns about the level of supplies allowed to Inchiquin's men, and in March 1649&#151;nearly a year after his defection to the king&#151;the president was still complaining of the sufferings of his men, and the urgency of relief.<br>
<br>Inchiquin still enjoyed great authority over his army, but only when he commanded in person. The joint offensive of March 1649, which saw Inchiquin in league with Clanricarde, Taaffe, and Castlehaven in a successful bid to push O'Neill out of Leinster, was followed by a drive through the midlands, capturing Queen's county on 16 May, and forcing the garrisons at Trim and Dundalk to capitulate. On 4 July, Inchiquin captured Drogheda by siege and, leaving a force to garrison the town, his army rejoined Ormond, encamped before Dublin. Victory seemed assured as long as Inchiquin was present, and his field army lived up to expectations. But the new campaign had taken Inchiquin away from the Munster garrisons for five months, and there were fears of a new mutiny, compounded by rumours that Oliver Cromwell intended to target Munster first. On 27 July, Inchiquin was ordered to take two cavalry regiments south, and when Michael Jones confronted Ormond at Rathmines on 2 August, the lord lieutenant lacked his ablest commander. Inchiquin's men fought well during the battle, but in the aftermath of defeat they deserted to parliament in droves. Inchiquin, now at Cork, managed to hold his garrisons for a few months more, but with the English army's advance south he began to lose control. Cromwellian agents had been in Munster since the summer, and on 16 October, Inchiquin had imprisoned Colonel Richard Townsend, Colonel William Warden, and Colonel John Giffard, fearing that they were in contact with Lord Broghill and other enemies with local influence. On 26 October there were reports that Inchiquin had been barred by his own troops from entering Cork, Youghal, Dungarvan, and Bandon. By 14 November the towns had agreed articles with Cromwell, and received English garrisons, rejoicing at &#145;the happy uniting of all of us, with those of your army; which God hath been pleased in a wonderful manner to bring to pass&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 25287, fol. 41). The agreement allowed for two foot regiments and a double regiment of horse to be raised from the Munster forces to fight alongside Cromwell's troops. Inchiquin's enemy Lord Broghill, who had joined Cromwell just before the invasion, persuaded Bandon and Kinsale to reject Inchiquin and, as a sign of his victory, requisitioned the president's house in Cork for use as his private residence.<br>
<br>With the surrender of the Munster ports, Inchiquin was left with little territory and few troops. In the new year of 1650 he gathered the remnants of his army&#151;perhaps 2000 men&#151;at Kilmallock in co. Limerick, and began raiding the English quarters in co. Cork. When Cromwell marched north against the confederate armies he had to leave Broghill with a strong force to keep Inchiquin in check. In March 1650 Inchiquin was caught near Mallow by cavalry under Broghill and Henry Cromwell, and routed. It was perhaps appropriate that the final annihilation of Inchiquin's army should be at the hands of his old adversary&#151;and so close to the site of his own great victory at Knocknanuss. After the battle at Mallow, Inchiquin retreated into Connaught, eventually joining Ormond. Without an army, the two were at a disadvantage when negotiating with the increasingly hostile Catholic commanders, who offended Inchiquin in August by accusing him of betraying Munster to Cromwell. The refusal to give Inchiquin another command, and the appointment of Emer MacMahon, Catholic bishop of Clogher, as O'Neill's successor in the north, were further signs that there was little room for protestant royalists in Ireland. In a bid to create still more division within the royalist camp, Cromwell offered safe-conduct passes to both Ormond and Inchiquin, but they were refused, and Inchiquin followed the lord lieutenant into exile in France in December 1650.<h2>
<a name="Exileconversionandcaptivity16511663"></a>Exile, conversion, and captivity, 1651&#150;1663</h2>During the 1650s Inchiquin remained on the continent, in an exile which was only in part self-imposed. Unlike many other former Irish royalists (notably the second earl of Cork, who returned to Munster in 1651), Inchiquin had been condemned as a traitor by parliament in April 1649 and excepted from pardon in August 1652, and there was no prospect of regaining his estates or retaining his position as president of Munster. Not that life in France was entirely comfortable: immediately on his arrival Inchiquin was faced with accusations, levelled by Sir Lewis Dyve, that he had acted dishonourably in Munster. These had been quashed as early as in May 1651, but it was not until April 1652&#151;and then only with Ormond's intervention&#151;that Inchiquin received letters from the king attesting to his loyalty. In the meantime Inchiquin spent most of his time at Caen, where other protestants, including Ormond, had settled. It was probably Ormond's influence which secured Inchiquin a place on the king's council in May 1652, and his ally, Sir Edward Hyde, considered Inchiquin as &#145;a gallant gentleman, of good parts and great industry, and a temper fit to struggle with the affairs on all sides we are to contend with&#146;. The appointment was against the wishes of the Catholics at court, mindful of Inchiquin's part in the sack of Cashel and other atrocities, and as Hyde added, &#145;I believe neither the queen, Lord Jermyn nor Lord Wilmot are much pleased with it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Clarendon State Papers</span>, 3.67). The Irish exiles, and especially the priests, also opposed Inchiquin, using their influence to block his appointment to a senior military command in France in 1653, on the ground that he was &#145;a murderer of priests, friars and such like&#146;  (Thurloe, 1.562). Inchiquin was given command of one or two French regiments at this time, but Mazarin had to wait before offering him a more important post. Despite Catholic hostility, Inchiquin attended the royal council in 1653&#150;4, and, after a warrant signed by the king on 4 May 1654, on 21 October he was created Baron O'Brien of Burren and earl of Inchiquin.<br>
<br>The grant of an earldom was the high point of Inchiquin's favour at the hands of Charles II. From 1654 onwards, however, he became increasingly distanced from those with influence around the king. There were two reasons for this. First, in autumn 1654 Inchiquin returned to a military career, serving in Catalonia as governor of the areas controlled by France, and encouraging Irish soldiers to defect from the Spanish to the French service. His duties took him away from Paris for long periods (1654&#150;5, 1656&#150;7, and 1657&#150;8), and may have allowed his enemies to slander him unchecked. The second reason for Inchiquin's loss of influence at court was confessional. On his return to Paris in summer 1657, Inchiquin declared his conversion to the Church of Rome. The trigger for this may have been a period of acute illness, and his decision came as a complete surprise, not least to his wife, who was a convinced protestant. There followed a period of deep tension within the family. The English ambassador, William Lockhart, writing in July 1657, said the countess and her son Lord O'Brien &#145;have been so persecuted by her husband and the Roman Catholics&#146;  (Thurloe, 6.385) that he felt obliged to offer her a pass to travel to England. This is substantiated by Sir Edward Nicholas, who commented: &#145;I am very sorry for the Earl of Inchiquin's care to make his sons as himself papists, but it is no marvel to hear that a zealous presbyter proves a bigot in popery&#146;  (letter of 19/29 June 1657, BL, Sir Richard Browne papers, uncatalogued). There followed a period of high drama, when Inchiquin, with the queen mother's support, abducted his younger son, Charles O'Brien, from Lockhart's house, where he had taken refuge. By December the French court had forced him to return the boy and threatened to banish the father from the realm. Soon afterwards the countess fled to England with her children, and for a brief period Lord O'Brien even returned to Ireland, before rejoining his father on the continent at the end of the year. Although Lord O'Brien remained a protestant, Charles and the youngest son, John, had reportedly &#145;turned Catholic&#146; by 1659  (<span class="italic">Egmont MSS</span>, 1.603). Inchiquin's conversion not only alienated his wife, it also lost him the support of men like Ormond and Hyde, who remained attached to the established church. By September 1658 Inchiquin complained that Ormond was treating him with &#145;contempt&#146; and &#145;distrust&#146;  (<span class="italic">Clarendon State Papers</span>, 3.414). In consolation, his conversion had made him more acceptable to the Catholics around the queen mother, but their influence was at a low ebb. From 1658, therefore, Inchiquin found himself increasingly isolated at court, and his hopes of being included in royalist plans to invade England had little chance of being realized. In 1659 Inchiquin corresponded with the countess of Dysart and other royalists in England, with Hyde in Holland, and with James, duke of York, but his letters show that he was no longer included in the innermost counsels of the exiled king.<br>
<br>Frustrated by his lack of progress at court, Inchiquin during 1659 again looked for military employment in foreign service. The peace negotiations between France and Spain effectively removed him from the governorship of the disputed province of Catalonia, and he was forced to look further afield. By July 1659 he had been offered command of a Portuguese army, and in September he decided to accept, although he promised to return if the king needed his help in an invasion of England. Arriving at La Rochelle at the end of October, he took ship for Portugal but was captured by an Algerian corsair off the Spanish coast after a battle in which Lord O'Brien lost an eye. Inchiquin remained in prison during the Restoration, and was released only with the intervention of Charles II's council in summer 1660. His son remained in Algiers until November, when the king finally agreed to pay the ransom. The whole episode seems to have confirmed Inchiquin in his devotion to Catholicism, and gave him further cause to atone for his past sins. During his captivity he wrote to two priests, confessing to one that &#145;no punishment is severe enough for such a persecutor of the church as I have been&#146;  (Murphy, &#145;Inchiquin's changes of religion&#146;, 63). After the Restoration, Inchiquin was firm in his new faith, and was not tempted to reconvert to the established church, although he still had hopes of political preferment. Instead, he became high steward in the household of the queen mother, and used his influence to curry favour with the king, who agreed to restore him to his estates in Ireland, and compensated him for his military arrears before 1649 and for his sufferings since then. In 1662&#150;3 Inchiquin accepted a position as commander of English troops sent to Portugal. This second Portuguese expedition was nearly as disastrous as the first. The Portuguese accused him of treachery (by agreeing to defect, with his troops, to Spanish service) and his brother, Christopher O'Brien, was imprisoned. Inchiquin protested that, although the Spaniards had approached him, he had refused to treat with them, and had advised the English government to withdraw altogether. By May 1663, with Inchiquin back in Limerick, Charles II relieved him of the command, leaving the earl to petition Secretary Bennet for yet another letter from the king stating his confidence in him. This may have been the last straw for Charles II. In later years Inchiquin continued to receive royal favour, but he was never again employed in an official capacity.<h2>
<a name="LastyearsMunster16631674"></a>Last years: Munster, 1663&#150;1674</h2>From 1663 Inchiquin lived in Munster in a state of semi-retirement, rebuilding his estates in counties Clare and Limerick, and preferring as a residence Rostellan Castle near Cork city. He remained an important member of the Catholic community in Munster, and signed the remonstrance to the king from the Irish Catholic nobles and gentry protesting their loyalty in 1666. In his will, written in 1673, he left money for the friars at Ennis, co. Clare, presumably for masses to be said for his soul. Yet during the last years of his life Inchiquin made every effort to reintegrate himself and his family into the old protestant community he had rejected so dramatically at his conversion a few years before. Central to this was his successful attempt to make friends with his former enemy, Lord Broghill, now earl of Orrery. Orrery, who had finally achieved the presidency of Munster (for which Inchiquin, as a Catholic, was disqualified) in 1660, was now the most powerful man in the province, and, despite their earlier enmity, in 1665 a match was arranged between his daughter, Margaret Boyle, and Inchiquin's heir, William, Lord O'Brien. The initiative seems to have come from Inchiquin, but Orrery saw the merit of the plan. Like St Leger thirty years earlier, Orrery recognized the significance of the ancient O'Brien clan, and valued their influence over the native Irish in the region. He also had no objection to Lord O'Brien, who remained a protestant despite his father's conversion, and he may have shared the proselytizing ambitions of his father, the first earl of Cork. The late 1660s and early 1670s thus saw the Boyles and the O'Briens again working together, but this time without the underlying rivalry, ethnic tension, and religious animosity which had done so much to hamper the protestant cause in the 1640s. In 1667 Orrery used his position to restore Inchiquin to possession of Rostellan, which had been seized by those who claimed a legal right themselves. In 1669, when Orrery was faced with impeachment proceedings in England, this incident was used against him; but in his defence he was able not only to defend his own actions, but also Inchiquin's honour. In 1672, when he got wind of a presbyterian plot against the Irish government, Inchiquin sent his servant 50 miles to where Orrery was staying, to warn him of it. In 1679, just before his death, Orrery further cemented relations between the two houses with the marriage of his younger son, Henry, with Inchiquin's youngest daughter, Mary O'Brien.<br>
<br>This amicable relationship with Orrery was not matched by a reconciliation between Inchiquin and his wife, who remained bitterly opposed to his Catholicism. A measure of their unhappiness can be seen in their choice of burial places. Inchiquin, who died on 9 September 1674, had asked to be buried in Limerick Cathedral, probably intending to join his ancestors in the O'Brien tomb there; his countess chose to be buried with the St Legers, in the church which her father had built at Doneraile. Their separation in death is poignant testimony to the failure of this particular attempt to mix Catholic oil with protestant water. It also highlights the personal, political, and confessional tensions which dogged Inchiquin throughout his eventful life.<br>
