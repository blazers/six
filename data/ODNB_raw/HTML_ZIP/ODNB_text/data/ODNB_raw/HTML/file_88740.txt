<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Knill, Sir  John Lawrence</span>  (1934&#150;2002), <span class="occ">engineering geologist</span>, was born on 22 November 1934 at Hazelhurst, Penn Road, Penn, Wolverhampton, the son of William Cuthbert Knill, water engineer, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dempsey. He was educated at Whitgift School, Croydon, and Imperial College, London, from where he graduated in 1955 with a first-class honours degree in geology and where he was awarded the Watts medal. He then undertook research on the Dalradian rocks of the south-west highlands of Scotland, graduating PhD (and receiving the Judd prize) in 1957. The same year he married his fellow student Diane Constance Judge, and was appointed assistant lecturer in the department of geology at Imperial College. He and Diane had a son, Patrick, and a daughter, Fiona.<br>
<br>Knill's career as a practising engineering geologist also commenced in 1957, in Iran, where he worked initially on the hydrogeology of Tehran for Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners. His involvement with Gibb on projects in Iran continued until 1982 and included further work on the Tehran water supply and on dams and hydroelectric projects in the Alborz Mountains. His work on the Latiyan Dam in Iran and on other dams for Gibb formed the basis for his landmark paper on the recording and interpretation of geological conditions in dam foundations, published in 1965.<br>
<br>After being appointed to the staff of the geology department at Imperial College in 1957, Knill took over the teaching of engineering geology from F. G. H. Blythe. He established the master of science course in engineering geology at Imperial College in 1964. This course soon became regarded as the paramount postgraduate course in engineering geology in the UK and attracted students from the UK and overseas, particularly those with some initial industrial experience. Over the years, many of his students achieved senior positions within industry and government departments throughout the world. The quality of his teaching was greatly enhanced by the strong industrial links that he developed, initially through his contacts with Gibb, but subsequently expanded to include links with a wide range of contractors and consultants in the UK and overseas, many of whom looked to him for advice on practical projects. The department also developed a strong research group working on such topics as the engineering geology of mudrock formations and the experimental, high-pressure consolidation of clays.<br>
<br>Throughout his career at Imperial College, Knill was active in both college and university life. His academic career culminated in his appointment as professor of engineering geology in 1973. He gave his inaugural lecture, &#145;Cow Green revisited&#146;, on 10 February 1976. At Imperial, he was head of the department of geology (1979&#150;88) and dean of the Royal School of Mines (1980&#150;83). His work within the university included serving as chairman of the University of London board of studies and as a member of the university's academic council. He was also a member of the science sub-committee of the Sultan Qaboos University project in Oman.<br>
<br>A strong advocate of high professional standards and integrity, Knill convened the Geological Society's Working Group on Professional Geology in 1972 and served as general secretary (1974&#150;8) of the Association for the Promotion of an Institution of Professional Geologists. He became second chairman of the newly created institution in 1979&#150;80, then president from 1981 to 1984. From these roots grew the professional title of chartered geologist (awarded by the Geological Society, following the incorporation of the Institution of Geologists in 1991), with over a thousand geologists qualifying by the time of Knill's death.<br>
<br>In 1988 Knill left Imperial College to become chairman and chief executive of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) for a five-year period. His appointment coincided with a turning point in public and political attitudes towards environmental issues. His period with NERC was characterized by the creation of high-quality, multi-disciplinary research programmes, increased collaboration between the NERC institutes and the higher education sector, and a dramatic resurgence in the fortunes of NERC. On leaving NERC in 1993, he became a freelance engineering geologist, working largely on dispute resolution, risk assessment, and failures associated with dams, tunnels, and slopes in the Middle East, Africa, and the Mediterranean as well as in the UK. During the 1980s and 1990s he was also involved in wider environmental issues at government level, including being appointed by the secretary of state for the environment as a member of the independent Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee (1985&#150;95) and as chairman (1987&#150;95). He was also a member of the national co-ordinating committee for the International Decade of Natural Disaster Reduction (1992&#150;5), chairman of the Geological Society conservation committee, and a member of the Nature Conservancy Council (1986&#150;9) and of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (1991&#150;6). He served on the council of the National Stone Centre (1984&#150;5).<br>
<br>Knill retained his close contacts with the academic world and was much in demand as a lecturer and teacher of engineering geology. He retained his chair at Imperial College until 1993, thereafter becoming emeritus professor and senior research fellow. He was appointed visiting professor at Royal Holloway College and was awarded honorary degrees by the universities of Kingston, Nottingham Trent, and East London. He was the author of over 200 scientific papers. Distinctions and honours were numerous. He was elected a fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers (1981), the Institution of Geologists (1985), and the Fellowship of Engineering (1991), and received the Whitaker medal of the Institution of Water and Environmental Management (1969), the Aberconway medal (from the Institution of Geologists, 1989), the William Smith medal (from the Geological Society of London, 1995), and the Hans Cloos medal (from the South African Institution of Engineering and Environmental Geology, 2002). He was a strong supporter of integrating amateur and professional geologists. He joined the Geologists' Association in 1951 and served as president from 1982 to 1984. He was president of section C of the British Association meeting (1988&#150;9). He was knighted for his services to science in 1994.<br>
<br>Latterly Knill and his wife lived in Shaw-cum-Donnington, near Newbury, where he established a vineyard that combined his interest in good wine and the effect of geology and slope aspect on viticulture. After a valiant fight against cancer, he died peacefully on 31 December 2002 at Newbury District Hospital. His funeral was held on 10 January 2003 at St Mary's, Shaw, Newbury, and he was cremated at Oxford crematorium. He was survived by his wife, Diane, and their two children.<br>
<br>Knill was the leading engineering geologist of his generation. He was involved in the application of geology in the construction industry and in environmental issues throughout a career that spanned forty-five years. He utilized his expertise and experience as a consultant of international repute and imparted his knowledge and understanding to others throughout a distinguished academic career. Professionally, he was decisive, uncompromising, and forceful in presenting his views with a style that others could find intimidating. He was tireless in offering support and advice to the large number of his colleagues and former students, many of whom became his personal friends.<br>
