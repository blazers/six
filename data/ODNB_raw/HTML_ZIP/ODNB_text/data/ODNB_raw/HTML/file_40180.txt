<span class="headword">Moore,  Doris Elizabeth Langley</span>  (1902&#150;1989), <span class="occ">writer on fashion and museum founder</span>, was born on 23 July 1902 in Liverpool, the second daughter in the family of three daughters and one son of Joseph Langley Levy, writer and newspaper editor, and his wife, Mabel Ada Rushden, theatrical designer. The family moved to South Africa when she was eight, and she was educated at convent schools there. In <span class="italic">Pleasure: a Discursive Guide Book</span> (1953) she described her comfortable and indulged childhood. Although she had no formal education, she read widely, under the guidance of her father.<br>
<br>Moore moved to London in the early 1920s, and her first book, <span class="italic">Anacreon: 29 Odes</span> (1926), was a verse translation from the Greek. This was followed by <span class="italic">The Technique of the Love Affair</span> (1928) by &#145;a Gentlewoman&#146;, a manual of advice to a woman on how to catch a husband. <span class="italic">Pandora's Letter Box, being a Discourse on Fashionable Life</span> (1929) was written for her two-year-old daughter. She wrote six romantic novels between 1932 and 1959, and several books on household management, including <span class="italic">The Bride's Book</span> (1932, revised in 1936 as <span class="italic">Our Loving Duty</span>). Her biography of Edith Nesbit (1933; revised, 1967) drew on extensive conversations with members of the novelist's family and family letters, transcripts of which were invaluable for later biographers.<br>
<br>Moore was passionately interested in clothes, and dressed in the height of fashion each season. She loved hats, and early in life decided that, when depressed, one should go out and buy a hat. Her own clothes formed the basis of a collection of costumes, to which she added historical costumes, discovered in salerooms, country house auctions, and attics. She admitted to a certain amount of bargaining, plotting, and machination in obtaining such items. Her most exciting acquisition was the Albanian costume bought by Lord Byron on his grand tour of 1809, which he wore for the portrait painted by Thomas Phillips in 1814. She was one of the first to study the history of fashion seriously, and all her life she wrote and lectured on it, organized exhibitions, and produced television programmes. In 1949 she brought out <span class="italic">The Woman in Fashion</span>, a history of fashion in which some of the most famous beauties of the day, most of them personal friends, were photographed wearing costumes from her collection. In 1955 followed <span class="italic">The Child in Fashion</span>.<br>
<br>Moore campaigned for many years for a museum of costume to be founded in London, persuading Christian Dior to bring his collection over from Paris in order to raise money for the project. The museum was opened in 1955, housed temporarily in Eridge Castle, near Tunbridge Wells, Kent, and then in the Brighton Pavilion. It moved permanently to the rebuilt assembly rooms in Bath in 1963.<br>
<br>Moore was anxious to keep the museum up to date, and created a modern room for clothes from 1907 to the current year. Each year new specimens were added, chosen as representative of current fashion, and a different fashion expert was asked to choose one outfit as &#145;dress of the year&#146;. The dress for 1963 was designed by Mary Quant, and the 1967 &#145;dress&#146; was a trouser suit. Moore retired as adviser to the museum in 1974, and left her collection to the city of Bath.<br>
<br>Moore's interest in costume extended to the stage and to films, but the d&eacute;cor for her ballet <span class="italic">The Quest</span>, first performed at Sadler's Wells in 1943, was done by John Piper. The scenario was adapted by her from Edmund Spenser's <span class="italic">The Faerie Queene</span>, showing the victory of St George over the forces of evil. William Walton wrote the score especially for the ballet, Frederick Ashton was the choreographer, and the soloists were Margot Fonteyn, Robert Helpmann, Beryl Grey, and Moira Shearer in her first role. Moore also worked as a costume designer for the theatre and films, and designed Katharine Hepburn's dresses for <span class="italic">The African Queen</span> (1951).<br>
<br>Doris Langley Moore first came across Byron when she was fifteen, when her father gave her a copy of <span class="italic">Don Juan</span>. She remained devoted to him all her life. &#145;I was perhaps the only woman to whom nothing but pleasure has come from loving that poet.&#146; In 1924, the centenary of Byron's death, she was invited to join the commemoration committee, and in 1931 she accompanied the Greek prime minister on a visit to Byron's tomb. She was present when his tomb in Hucknall church was opened in 1938 to see if he really was buried there. She became a founding vice-president of the Byron Society in 1971. She was the first person, apart from Byron's family, to be allowed access to the large collection of uncatalogued Wentworth and Lovelace papers in the possession of Lady Wentworth, Byron's great-granddaughter. Her last novel, <span class="italic">My Caravaggio Style</span> (1959), about the forgery of the lost Byron memoirs, was written while she was immersed in these papers.<br>
<br>The first of her three scholarly works on Byron, <span class="italic">The Late Lord Byron</span>, appeared in 1961. <span class="italic">Lord Byron, Accounts Rendered</span> (1974) won the British Academy's Rose Mary Crawshay prize in 1975. Based on Byron's accounts, found among the papers of his Italian secretary, this book examines Byron's finances as a means of gaining insight into his domestic life. <span class="italic">Ada, Countess of Lovelace</span> (1977) is a biography of Byron's daughter. The publication of these works had enormous influence on the subsequent course of Byron studies. Doris Langley Moore was appointed OBE in 1971.<br>
<br>Moore was an attractive woman, with a high forehead and a handsome profile. She moved in fashionable London circles, but she was a difficult person, and some of her friendships ended in bitterness. In 1926 she married Robert Sugden Moore, wool merchant, the son of Fred Denby Moore, also a wool merchant. They had one daughter, Pandora. They were divorced in 1942. She died in the Middlesex Hospital, London, on 24 February 1989.<br>
