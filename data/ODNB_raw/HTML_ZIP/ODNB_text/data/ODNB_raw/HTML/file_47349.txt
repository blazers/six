<span class="headword">Edwards,  (Allen) Clement</span>  (1869&#150;1938), <span class="occ">trade unionist, barrister, and journalist</span>, was born on 7 June 1869 in Knighton, Radnorshire, the third of seven children born to George Benjamin Edwards, auctioneer, master tailor, and draper, and Sarah Ellen (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Tudge). Both parents came from farming, nonconformist, and radical families in the border areas. Edwards, who was known as Clem, was educated at Knighton national school until the age of thirteen. Like many of his generation, he also attended evening classes (in mathematics and languages at Birkbeck Institute, London) and engaged in private study (most notably in economics and law). He was called to the bar in 1899.<br>
<br>Following school, Edwards worked as a clerk in a local solicitor's office. He experimented with journalism before moving to London, although he remained at heart a countryman. In London he became a Congregationalist (although a Welsh-speaking champion of nonconformist grievances, he was born into the Church of England). He studied Karl Marx and the land reformer Henry George; he was attracted to both fiery preachers such as Charles Spurgeon and Hugh Price Hughes, and the secularist radical Charles Bradlaugh. In the late 1880s Edwards helped form a series of trade unions for unskilled workers (especially dockers). Like other radicals, he saw trade unions as a defence against cruel employers and an erratic economic system which induced personal poverty, immorality, and misery. Edwards worked both with the leading union figures Ben Tillett, J. E. Burns, and Tom Mann, and with London's religious philanthropists and Liberal campaigners. He was assistant secretary of the Dock, Wharf, and General Labourers Union, formed in 1890, and general secretary of the short-lived federation of dockland and transport unions formed in 1891.<br>
<br>Edwards's radical contacts enabled him to forge a career in journalism&#151;where he exposed poverty and supported strikers' families&#151;and to enter municipal politics, where he campaigned for better education and housing. He became labour editor of the radical London paper <span class="italic">The Sun</span> in 1893 and of <span class="italic">The Echo</span> in 1894, before moving to the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>. He stood as Progressive candidate for the London school board in 1894 (Islington) and was elected to Islington council in 1898. He stood unsuccessfully for parliament in 1895 (Tottenham) and 1900 (Denbigh Boroughs) before winning the latter seat in 1906. Defeated by just ten votes in January 1910, he was elected in December that year for the mining seat of East Glamorgan.<br>
<br>As a barrister, and also later in parliament, Edwards supported the legal restoration of trade union rights. As a young barrister, he quickly gained a reputation with cases involving trade unions on the south Wales circuit. He was briefed as a junior counsel by the unions when the Taff Vale and Osborne judgments threatened the trade unions' ability to engage in industrial and political action. He put the miners' case following the infamous 1913 Senghenydd pit disaster in which 439 men died. A man of strong and determined views in public and private life, he combined support for traditional Welsh radical courses with a vehement and populistic hostility to the Labour Party and to syndicalism.<br>
<br>During the war Edwards was a super-patriot. Like the former new union leader Ben Tillett and other Labour men from a trade union background he backed David Lloyd George, notably in efforts to prevent industrial unrest. He became a prominent figure in the National Democratic Party (NDP), a &#145;patriotic labour&#146; organization. He was the party's successful parliamentary candidate for East Ham South in 1918, and the organization's chairman from 1919 to 1920. He attacked the &#145;unreasonable&#146; and &#145;Bolshevik&#146; actions of some unions during the post-war industrial unrest. By the end of the coalition years, this approach was losing its appeal, and although Edwards stood in 1922 for the NDP (as a supporter of the Lloyd George coalition) he was defeated.<br>
<br>Edwards married Fanny (<i>d</i>. 1920), daughter of Captain Emerson, the superintendent of Trinity House, Great Yarmouth, in 1890. After her death, in 1922 he married the secretary of the NDP, Alice May Parker; they had one son, John. Edwards's views and past actions did not fit easily with the now reunited Liberal Party. He remained a champion of union rights during the turmoil of the mid-1920s but drifted out of Liberal politics. He claimed to be a Liberal until 1931, when he lost faith with the party leaders and resigned his membership. He eventually retired as a barrister and died comparatively poor of cancer at Manor House Hospital, Golders Green, on 23 June 1938. He was cremated at Golders Green. Edwards's second wife worked for the London and North Eastern Railway in the 1920s and 1930s. On her husband's death the family left the ground-floor flat looking onto Hampstead Heath which had been home for some years, and lived as tenants of relations. Alice Edwards died in the 1980s. Their son, John Edwards, became a solicitor.<br>
