<span class="headword">Watt,  William Montgomery</span>  (1909&#150;2006), <span class="occ">Scottish Episcopal clergyman and scholar of Islam</span>, was born on 14 March 1909 at the manse, Ceres, Fife, the only child of Andrew Watt, a minister in the Church of Scotland, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Burns, primary school teacher. His early years were far from stable. His father died shortly after his birth and this misfortune necessitated frequent relocations during his childhood. An uncle and an aunt shared parenting duties with his mother and he grew up primarily in Edinburgh, where he attended George Watson's College.<br>
<br>Watt initially dreamed of a career in science, but because of financial considerations and lack of career guidance he abandoned that ambition in order to study classics at the University of Edinburgh. He completed his MA a year ahead of schedule and entered Balliol College, Oxford, in 1930 with a Warner exhibition. He showed great promise, winning several scholarships (including the Ferguson scholarship in classics in 1931), and was disappointed to receive only a second-class degree in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1932. Fortunately scholarships allowed him to spend another year studying at Balliol. He made the most of his extra time and redeemed the disappointing BA by writing a thesis for the degree of BLitt (awarded in 1935) entitled &#145;Kant's view of the relation between teleology and ethics&#146;, under the guidance of Clement C. J. Webb, whose &#145;personalist&#146; approach to the philosophy of religion proved stimulating. In the summer of 1934 he continued his explorations in German philosophy at the University of Jena in Germany. When he returned to Scotland in the autumn, he took up an assistant lectureship in moral philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, where he served until 1938.<br>
<br>The year 1937 proved to be both difficult and pivotal for Watt. His mother died, he was jilted, and his doctoral thesis at the University of Edinburgh was rejected with no option for revision. He also published his first book, <span class="italic">Can Christians Be Pacifists?</span>, which provided a manifesto for &#145;Christian internationalism&#146;  (p. 125). The book signalled the beginning of Watt's lifetime interest in the development of a universal religion that would supersede all previous particular religions. Watt believed that humanity required a common religion to help it manage the transition from allegiance to the nation state to support of a common world federation. However, he had little first-hand experience of the challenges of religious dialogue and reconciliation until he caught a &#145;glimpse of the profundity of the problem&#146; through conversations with a Muslim flatmate from Pakistan  (Watt, <span class="italic">Islamic Revelation in the Modern World</span>, 1969, v). These conversations piqued Watt's interest and proved the beginning of a lifetime of reflection on the relationship between Christianity and Islam.<br>
<br>Following the exchanges with his Muslim friend, Watt entered into correspondence with the Anglican bishop in Jerusalem, George Francis Graham Brown. Shortly thereafter Graham Brown invited Watt to join him in Jerusalem as his specialist in Arab affairs. This new post required several years of preparation, but Watt made rapid progress, receiving ordination in 1939 after training at Cuddesdon College and completing his curacy in 1943 (in which year he married Jean Macdonald Donaldson, a social worker; they had a son and four daughters). During this busy period he studied Arabic at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London and began work on his doctoral thesis, &#145;Free will and predestination in early Islam&#146;, under the direction of the Scottish Arabist Richard Bell at the University of Edinburgh. He was awarded his PhD in 1944.<br>
<br>Watt arrived in Jerusalem in 1943 and remained on the bishop's staff until 1946, when a friend's death in the bombing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem impelled him to look for a change of scenery. By the time he had returned home to the University of Edinburgh to take up a lectureship, first in ancient philosophy in 1946 and subsequently in Arabic in 1947, he had refined his own view of the proper Christian approach to Islam. In Watt's assessment the cultivation of a vigorous indigenous Arab Christianity in a fiercely nationalistic climate required appreciation of the enduring values of Islam. He believed that attacking Islam would only strengthen the already rapidly spreading cancer of materialism, so he argued that Christians should instead focus primarily on helping Muslims become better Muslims.<br>
<br>Watt's missionary experience gave impetus to his development of a Christian critique of Western views of Islam that anticipated elements of later post-structuralist and Marxist critiques of Orientalism. Watt believed that misconceptions and stereotypes about Islam in the West could be traced back to the &#145;medieval war-propaganda&#146; of the crusades  (Watt, <span class="italic">Muhammad at Medina</span>, 1956, 324). From his position in Edinburgh, where he served as professor of Arabic and Islamic studies from 1964 to 1979, he set about countering false perceptions. His monumental two-volume biography of the prophet Muhammad, <span class="italic">Muhammad at Mecca</span> (1953) and <span class="italic">Muhammad at Medina</span> (1956), broke new ground through the sympathetic treatment of its protagonist. In addition he launched the successful <span class="roman">Islamic Surveys</span> series at Edinburgh University Press. He edited the series from 1961 to 1979 and contributed many volumes of his own work including <span class="italic">Islamic Philosophy and Theology</span> (1962), <span class="italic">A History of Islamic Spain</span> (1965), <span class="italic">Islamic Political Thought</span> (1968), and <span class="italic">The Influence of Islam on Medieval Europe</span> (1972).<br>
<br>Methodologically Watt attempted to blend philology with sociology. Though he eschewed the social and psychological reductionism of Marx and Freud, their work made him aware of the ways in which political and social biases unconsciously shaped both ideas in the past and conclusions of supposedly neutral scholarship in the present. Since political commitment was unavoidable, he believed it important that scholarship should support the right cause. For Watt this cause was religious and political internationalism. While class conflict, racial prejudice, and nationalist chauvinism threatened to tear the world apart, he believed that religion could play a crucial role in helping humanity form &#145;a single harmonious society&#146;  (Watt, &#145;Thoughts on Islamic unity&#146;, <span class="italic">Islamic Quarterly</span>, 3, 1956&#150;7, 193). In <span class="italic">Islam and the Integration of Society</span> (1961) he sought to determine how Islam had fostered social cohesion in a localized context in the past and how it might do so on a worldwide scale in the future. Concepts derived from the work of Carl Jung, whose work Watt greatly admired, figured prominently in the analysis. In 1968, Watt forecasted presciently that by &#145;the year <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 2000 it seems probable that Islam will be one of a half-dozen significant political forces in the world&#146;  (Watt, <span class="italic">Islamic Political Thought</span>, ix). At the time, he believed Islam's political re-emergence would mean the spread of global unity and he did not anticipate the subsequent rise of Islamist terrorism. Many years later he provided an analysis of why things had not turned out as he expected in <span class="italic">Islamic Fundamentalism and Modernity</span> (1988).<br>
<br>Watt's Christian faith was of a decidedly liberal orientation. Though he was sympathetic to aspects of Anglo-Catholic spirituality, the liberal theology of F. D. Maurice exercised an early and lasting influence on his &#145;intellectual attitude as an Anglican&#146;  (Watt, &#145;Towards the religion of the future&#146;, priv. coll.). His numerous theological writings reflected his concern to communicate traditional Christian doctrines in modern scientific terms. He served as a priest for the Scottish Episcopal church throughout his life, and though sceptical of institutional initiatives towards Christian unity, he supported ecumenism by joining the Iona community in 1960. Though his work was not without its critics, he earned wide acclaim as one of Britain's foremost interpreters of Islam in the twentieth century and garnered numerous awards, honorary doctorates, and visiting lectureships throughout the world. He died on 24 October 2006 at Liberton Hospital, Edinburgh, of bronchopneumonia, and was survived by his wife, Jean, and their five children.<br>
