<span class="headword">Pugh, Sir  Arthur</span>  (1870&#150;1955), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 19 January 1870 at Ross, Herefordshire, the fifth child of William Thomas Valentine Pugh, a civil engineer, and his wife, Amelia Rose Adlington. His circumstances and prospects clearly suffered from the death of both his parents in his infancy. Arthur received his education at the local elementary school, and at thirteen was apprenticed to a farmer&#150;butcher. In 1894 he moved to south Wales, close to his father's birthplace of Neath, obtaining a series of short-term jobs as a subordinate hand in the steel industry. He probably remained in Wales until his marriage, on 7 April 1901, to Elisabeth (1879/80&#150;1939), daughter of David Morris of Port Talbot. Shortly afterwards, evidently in search of promotion to the senior grade of smelter, he moved to the Frodingham iron works in Lincolnshire. He had already been active in the British Steel Smelters' Association, and now became a branch secretary. As administrator and negotiator he was manifestly successful, and in 1906 the smelters' executive appointed him as assistant secretary.<br>
<br>The smelters' union had, from its origins in Glasgow in 1885, developed into a national organization with ambitions to dominate the labour force of the industry. Pugh readily acceded to the conciliatory strategy of its full-time president, John Hodge, designed to secure recognition of the union by the employers, the equalization of working conditions among the different tiers of labour, and thereby the eventual displacement of smaller, rival unions. Pugh's main sphere of responsibility was the conduct of the smelters' finances, and under him its central office became, in the view of the Webbs, the most efficient in the union movement. Pugh's elevation had coincided with Hodge's election as a Labour MP. In December 1916 the latter became a minister in the war-time coalition government, and Pugh again received promotion, to central office secretary. As the <i>de facto</i> chief of the premier steel union he took the lead in the negotiations to create a single organization for all steel workers. He may well have devised the ingenious scheme which, in 1917, gave birth to the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation and to the British Iron, Steel and Kindred Trades Association&#151;which was intended ultimately to absorb all the existing unions.<br>
<br>In 1920 Pugh was elected to the parliamentary committee of the TUC, and he remained on the general council, its successor, until 1936, retiring as secretary of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation a year later. His widening sphere of activity reflected the expanding role of the union movement in government. He was Labour representative on several public inquiries into industrial disputes, and on others considering the application of &#145;safeguarding&#146; duties. He joined the British delegates on the economic consultative committee of the League of Nations, and in 1939, in retirement, served on the Central Appeal Tribunal under the <span class="roman">Military Service Acts</span>. On behalf of the TUC he oversaw the educational facilities provided for union members, and for many years helped to administer the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span>. It was these various services which earned him a knighthood in 1935. The role he played in the general strike of 1926 was, by contrast, relatively unimpressive. Though acting <i>ex officio</i> as the chief public spokesman of the general council he was almost certainly a reluctant participant in this conflict. &#145;I have never heard him say that he was in favour of it&#146;, remarked Hodge in the aftermath, &#145;but I have never heard him say that he was against it&#146;  (J. Hodge, <span class="italic">Workman's Cottage to Windsor Castle</span>, 1931, 363). He made little contribution to the organization of the strike, though he was more heavily involved in the discussions with Viscount Samuel which brought it to an end. He was similarly supportive, over the next two or three years, of the TUC's attempts to launch negotiations with national employers' organizations.<br>
<br>Although Pugh gained public prominence mainly as the chairman of the TUC during the general strike, he achieved far more in the quieter arena of the iron and steel industry. He was praised by his obituarists as a &#145;born conciliator&#146; and a &#145;brilliant negotiator&#146;. He was certainly not a born orator, and the committee room appeared his natural milieu. &#145;One great difficulty&#146;, complained his president, &#145;was to get Mr Pugh to go out into the country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Workman's Cottage</span>, 359). To another observer he had the qualities of a chartered accountant, his competence in financial matters being of like value to his union and to the general council. He was described as &#145;a man of temperate habits, medium height, and wiry build, of fresh complexion, with greying hair and moustache, and a high bald forehead&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He was steadfastly loyal to the union movement and looked for the same virtue in his members. He belonged to that genre of labour leader for whom central co-ordination of policy, internal discipline, and strict adherence to collective agreements were articles of faith. He was not attracted to a political career, and though never questioning his union's association with the Labour Party, gave precedence to the former's interests, notably in championing industrial protection against the party's free-trade line. His history of the metal unions, <span class="italic">Men of Steel</span>, was published in 1951, and was characteristically painstaking, restrained, and self-effacing. It marked his continued interest in union affairs after his retirement. He died at the General Hospital, Bedford, on 2 August 1955, leaving a son and three daughters.<br>
