<span class="headword">Rennie, Sir  John Shaw</span>  (1917&#150;2002), <span class="occ">colonial governor and international civil servant</span>, was born in Cathcart, Glasgow, on 12 January 1917, the only son of John Shaw Rennie, an electrical engineering draughtsman, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dick. He was the great-grandson of Thomas Rennie, curator of Glasgow Art Gallery. When he was ten his mother died and his father emigrated to Canada, leaving him to be brought up by aunts in Glasgow. He was educated at Hillhead high school and at Glasgow University, and with an aptitude for languages he gained a first in French and German. He joined the colonial administrative service and was sent immediately to Balliol College, Oxford, for a one-year course in administration. His first posting as a cadet was to Tanganyika in 1940. He was appointed an assistant district officer there in 1942 and then district officer in 1949. He married, in Glasgow on 26 February 1946, the 28-year-old (Mary) Winifred McAlpine Robertson, an assistant principal in the Colonial Office, and daughter of James Bryson Robertson, solicitor. They had met while studying at Glasgow University. They had one son, Neil.<br>
<br>In 1951 Rennie was sent to Mauritius but stayed only four years before his appointment as British resident commissioner in the New Hebrides. He returned to Mauritius in 1962 as governor and commander-in-chief and was in office there in March 1968 when Mauritius became independent, within the Commonwealth, with Seewoosagur Ramgoolam as prime minister. At Ramgoolam's invitation, Rennie stayed on as governor-general until August 1968.<br>
<br>Rennie joined the United Nations after a friend suggested that he should go to Beirut to help to administer the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). The agency had been established in December 1949 by the general assembly to provide &#145;continued assistance for the relief of Palestinian refugees&#146; and to &#145;further conditions of peace and stability&#146;. Appointed deputy commissioner-general in 1968, under the American Laurence Michelmore, he arrived in Beirut just after the Six Day War. The war created more Palestinian refugee camps, particularly in Jordan. Rennie was appointed commissioner-general of UNRWA in 1971 on the strong recommendation of Michelmore, who was so keen that Rennie should succeed him that he had taken Rennie to New York to meet the UN secretary-general, U Thant, in order to impress upon the latter that Rennie was the right man for the job. U Thant breached convention with the appointment of Rennie, since this was traditionally an American post.<br>
<br>Rennie was commissioner-general of UNRWA from 1971 to 1977, years which saw the Yom Kippur War of 1973 and civil war in Lebanon. Nothing could have prepared him for the problems he would encounter. This was one of the most difficult jobs the international civil service had to offer. But no matter the problems, and they were legion, he considered his appointment a considerable honour. He was a great believer in the work of the UN and the ideals that it stood for. The agency, when he took over, was twenty-one years old and had a welfare state of its own, with 500 schools with a quarter of a million pupils and some 7000 teachers. This was the most ambitious educational undertaking under international administration and nearly half the agency funding was devoted to it. The agency also provided health care and welfare in refugee camps in the host countries of Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and in the Israeli-occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza strip. The headquarters of UNRWA were in Beirut, in a former French barracks set among mature palm trees on the so-called green line, but Rennie's work entailed a great deal of travelling to field offices in Damascus, Amman, and other Arab cities. Like most UN endeavours the agency was plagued with financial insecurity; UNRWA depended almost entirely on voluntary contributions for its regular and emergency operations and there were times when Rennie feared that he would be unable to pay the monthly salaries of the agency's teachers and medical staff. The agency was successful only in the limited sense in which success is measured in many UN operations: it helped to ameliorate a bad situation without eradicating it. The civil war in the Lebanon eventually forced the agency to close its Beirut headquarters. It moved to Vienna, an idea promoted by UN secretary-general Kurt Waldheim, keen for the UN to have as many offices as possible in his native Austria. Rennie and his staff considered this an unfortunate development. He left the agency in 1977 and retired.<br>
<br>Rennie was appointed OBE in 1955, CMG in 1958, KCMG in 1962, and GCMG in 1968. He loved art and poetry and had a happy retirement, dividing his time between Islington in London and Umbria in Italy. He had a wonderful memory and in retirement compiled a comprehensive account of his service, having collecting additional information during frequent visits to the Public Record Office. He wanted this account, though not intended for publication, to be made available for the benefit of future scholars. He suffered a heart attack on hearing the news that his only son, Neil, a university lecturer, had been seriously injured in a road accident, and died in London on 12 August 2002. He was survived by his wife, Winifred, and their son, who made a full recovery.<br>
