<span class="headword">Thesiger, Sir  Frederick</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1805), <span class="occ">naval officer in the British and Russian services</span>, was the eldest son of John Andrew Thesiger (<i>d</i>. 1783), and his wife, Miss Gibson (<i>d</i>. 1814) of Chester. After several voyages in the service of the East India Company he entered the Royal Navy as a midshipman under Sir Samuel Marshall. In 1782 when Admiral Sir George Rodney sailed for the West Indies, Thesiger was appointed acting-lieutenant on board the <i>Formidable</i>. Sir Charles Douglas, captain of the fleet, later recommended his appointment as aide-de-camp to Rodney. Thesiger continued in the West Indies under Admiral Hugh Pigot, Rodney's successor, and afterwards accompanied Douglas to America. After the peace of 1783 he returned to England.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of war between Russia and Sweden in 1788, Thesiger obtained permission to enter Russian service. In 1789 he took command of a 74-gun ship and quickly distinguished himself in a naval engagement at Svenskund in Finland, where he obliged the Swedish admiral on board the <i>Gustavus</i> to strike to him. In June 1790 he took part in the desperate action fought off the island of Bornholm. Although the victory went to the Russians, Thesiger was the only survivor of the six British captains in Russian service. He was rewarded with the insignia of the order of St George by the Empress Catherine herself.<br>
<br>In 1796 Sir Frederick commanded a ship in the Russian squadron which came to the Downs to co-operate with the English fleet in the blockade of the Texel. After Catherine's death in 1796 Thesiger grew discontented with her successor, Paul, and tendered his resignation. He was detained in St Petersburg for a year, and finally departed without receiving his arrears of pay or his prize money.<br>
<br>Thesiger arrived in England when her maritime supremacy was threatened by the armed neutrality of Russia, Denmark, and Sweden. Because of his knowledge of the Baltic and the Russian navy Thesiger was frequently consulted by Earl Spencer, the first lord of the Admiralty. When war broke out he was promoted commander and served Lord Nelson as an aide-de-camp at the battle of Copenhagen (2 April 1801). At the crisis point of the battle Thesiger volunteered to proceed to the crown prince with the flag of truce. Knowing that celerity was important, he took his boat through the Danish fire, avoiding a safer but slower route. During subsequent operations his knowledge of the Baltic coast and of the Russian language proved of great value.<br>
<br>Thesiger returned to England bearing dispatches from Sir Charles Morice Pole, and received a flattering reception from Lord St Vincent. He was promoted post captain, and obtained permission to assume the rank of knighthood and to wear the order of St George. After the rupture of the peace of Amiens he served as British agent for the prisoners of war at Portsmouth. Sir Frederick died, unmarried, at Elson, near Portsmouth, on 26 August 1805.<br>
