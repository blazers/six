<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Skelton,  Bevil</span>  (<em>c.</em>1641&#150;1696), <span class="occ">diplomat and soldier</span>, was the eldest son of the Yorkshire soldier Sir John Skelton (<i>d</i>. 1673), lieutenant-governor of Plymouth from 1660, and his wife, Bridget (<i>d</i>. 1681), daughter of Sir Peter Prideaux. He later hinted that he served with the tiny royalist army in the 1657 campaign that culminated in the battle of the Dunes. By December 1657 he was a page of honour to the exiled Charles II, and continued in this position briefly after the Restoration, receiving a pension of &pound;120 a year in 1662, the year in which he sold the office. On 11 June 1662 he married Simona Cary (<i>d</i>. 1692), the daughter and stepdaughter of prominent soldiers (respectively, Sir Ferdinando Cary and Sir Thomas Blackwell); they had at least three sons, Bevil, Cary, and Charles (1672&#150;1736). The marriage seems to have been happy: in January 1673, while serving in France, Skelton wrote to Simona to assure her &#145;that I most passionately love thee, being unwilling to express any further discontent and trouble for my being from thee, not questioning you are sufficiently assured of my being, my only joy, thy faithful loving husband&#146;  (<span class="italic">Various Collections</span>, 8.67).<br>
<br>On 27 July 1666 Skelton was commissioned a cornet in the earl of Rochester's horse, and became a captain in Sir Arthur Basset's foot regiment on 13 June 1667. From August the same year he served as quartermaster to Sir George Hamilton's troop in the French army. On 20 November 1668 he was commissioned a captain in the 1st foot guards, and in October 1669 became registrar of the Charterhouse. In 1671 he was with his regiment at York, and received some of the proceeds from the fines on conventicles in Yorkshire. From 1672 to 1674 he served as lieutenant-colonel of the Royal English regiment in France.<br>
<br>Following his return from military service Skelton embarked upon a long and controversial diplomatic career. From August to November 1674 he undertook a secret mission to France for the king. On 29 December 1675 he was accredited as envoy-extraordinary to the imperial court, with an allowance of &pound;4 a day (soon increased to &pound;5), and remained at Vienna until 1681, despite the fact that his overtly francophile stance (epitomized by a close friendship with the French ambassador) made him unpopular with the emperor's ministers. In 1679 Charles II proposed to transfer him to The Hague, but his sympathies for France made him unacceptable to William of Orange and the states general. From 1681 Skelton was accredited to most of the lesser German courts in a peripatetic role, based usually at Hamburg. He had audiences at Brunswick and Saxony in 1682, and also visited the Netherlands on a number of occasions. In the spring of 1684 he made a diplomatic mission to Denmark, and had an audience in May.<br>
<br>Skelton's roving commission ended in March 1685, when he journeyed to The Hague to take up the post of ambassador. This was a posthumous insult to his nephew by Charles II, who had been offended by William's support for the duke of Monmouth and knew that the appointment of Skelton would be seen as a personal affront. Indeed the French ambassador in London even thought that this was deliberately intended to provoke William into a rash gesture, and at first Skelton had orders not to speak to the prince. Not surprisingly Skelton's relations with William of Orange and the Dutch authorities were poor almost from the very beginning, with Skelton again making no attempt to conceal his francophile stance. The Dutch authorities ignored his requests to prevent the sailing of the marquess of Argyll's and Monmouth's expeditions, and resented his subsequent attempts to get opponents of James II expelled from the Netherlands. To compound matters Skelton found out that William was having an affair with Elizabeth Villiers; a letter to him from Princess Mary's chaplain, John Covel, was intercepted, and William attempted to use it to get the despised ambassador recalled. Skelton's one success was to secure the return from the Netherlands of the English and Scottish regiments in the Anglo-Dutch brigade, but even this was very much a qualified success, as the political sympathies of the returning troops lay firmly with the opponents of the king.<br>
<br>Eventually admitting the inevitable James II accredited Skelton as envoy-extraordinary to France on 17 October 1686. In a parting gesture that hardly endeared him to the Dutch, Skelton authorized an attempt to kidnap Sir Robert Peyton, who had been indicted for sedition in the previous year, and to transport him back to England in his diplomatic yacht. However, Peyton had become a citizen of Amsterdam and was rescued by the mob. During his leave in England, Skelton regaled James with exaggerated tales of William's sympathies with the rebels, thereby helping to harden the king's attitude to his nephew. At Versailles, however, Skelton was effectively sidelined, with all serious negotiations being conducted directly through the French ambassador in London, Barillon. His one real initiative, in August 1688, was to advise the presentation of a memorial to the states general threatening French action against the Netherlands if William's preparations against England continued. James took a public position of resenting Skelton's unauthorized initiative and recalled him, committing him to the Tower on his return. This was effectively an attempt by James to convince William and European opinion that he was not in Louis XIV's pocket, but his treatment of Skelton suggests that it was little more than window dressing. The erstwhile ambassador's confinement was brief: on 9 October he was commissioned to command a new foot regiment, and on 6 November succeeded Sir Edward Hales as lieutenant of his so recent prison. He lost this position on 11 December and followed James into exile with two of his sons. Their escape was hair-raising:<blockquote>we were pursued by a vessel full of the Dover rabble who had an intent to plunder us, if not to murder us, but after two hours dispute side by side, with matches lighted and pistols cocked expecting who should fire first, they finding nothing was to be had without blows left us, and we sailed on our way. (<span class="italic">Various Collections</span>, 8.68)</blockquote>In March 1689 Skelton undertook a mission for James to the imperial diet at Regensburg, and subsequently sought an audience of the emperor. The mission also took in Venice and Turin, where he attempted to win over James's kinsman, Duke Victor Amadeus of Savoy. The duke, who was reluctant to offend William III, managed to avoid Skelton, whose known predilection for France again conditioned the response of a government to him. In February 1690 Skelton returned to Versailles as James II's envoy. He was appointed comptroller of the household at St Germain-en-Laye in June 1690 on a salary of 4200 livres a year, and additionally became a commissioner of the household on 24 December 1694. Skelton converted to Catholicism in 1691.<br>
<br>Following Simona's death on 17 January 1692 Skelton married, on 14 March, Marie (1660/61&#150;1747), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20448/', "Daniel O'Brien, third Viscount Clare (c.1630&#150;1690)")</script>. Several children were born in quick succession: James in 1692, Mary (who later married Lord Molyneux) in 1693, and Frances early in 1695. By February 1696 Skelton was dangerously ill, and he died and was buried at St Germain-en-Laye on 28 April, when he was said to be fifty-five. A posthumous son, Daniel Ignatius, was baptized on 31 July (he died in November 1697). In 1701 Skelton's widow petitioned parliament for the recovery of her jointure: disingenuously, she claimed to have married Skelton &#145;some time before the revolution&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. A.253, fol. 131), and made no mention at all of their time at St Germain-en-Laye. She eventually returned there and died on 8 November 1747, aged eighty-six.<br>
<br>Skelton was a significant hate figure for supporters of the Williamite revolution, especially the whigs, and their demonization of him has shaped the way in which history has treated him. Skelton, a man who always seems to have found it easier to make enemies than friends, made no secret of his contempt for their opinions: in 1684 he wrote to Sir Richard Bulstrode that &#145;I wish I could convert my relations that are with you from their damn'd Whiggish principles&#146;  (BL, Egerton MS 3681, fol. 132). Gilbert Burnet repaid the compliment in no uncertain terms, condemning Skelton to posterity as<blockquote>a very weak and passionate man, who neither understands the conduct of affairs, nor can govern his tongue with any sort of temper; for as his passion carries him to fly out on all occasions, so his vanity is so little governed that he discovers all sorts of secrets, even when he can have no other design in it but to let it appear that he knows them. (<span class="italic">Supplement to Burnet's History</span>, 256)</blockquote>Skelton was undoubtedly incompetent in his dealings over Argyll's and Monmouth's expeditions, reacting too slowly and approaching the wrong authorities. His love of the French was matched only by his rather less enthusiastic attitude to other Europeans: in 1676 he described his time among the high-ranking German and Austrian dignitaries at Regensburg as being &#145;confined amongst proud jealous brutes, with whom I have no conversation&#146;  (BL, Egerton MS 3681, fol. 2). Skelton sought solace with fellow Britons: &#145;[I] was yesterday (being St Benedict's day) entertained by the abbot of the Scotch Benedictines, a very honest gentleman and a good fellow, for which my head now aches&#146;  (ibid., fol. 1). Ultimately, the question of whether Colonel Bevil Skelton was or was not a competent diplomat is perhaps less important than the question of why Charles II and James II consistently employed in such high profile positions an ambassador whose sympathy for only one state and one policy was so transparent. In that respect, Skelton's career perhaps reveals more about their competence in foreign affairs than about his own.<br>
