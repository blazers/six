</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boulton,  Matthew</span>  (1728&#150;1809), <span class="occ">manufacturer and entrepreneur</span>, was born on 14 September 1728 at New Hall Walk, Snow Hill, Birmingham, one of four children, three of whom survived to adulthood, of Matthew Boulton (<i>d</i>. 1759), toy manufacturer and merchant, and his wife, Christiana Piers (<i>d</i>. 1785) of Chester. He was educated at the academy of the Revd John Hausted in Deritend, Birmingham.<h2>
<a name="Familyandfriends"></a>Family and friends</h2>The &#145;toy&#146; trade of Birmingham consisted of several distinct branches of the hardware industry. Makers of gold and silver toys produced trinkets, snuff-boxes, inkstands, and a variety of other goods. The tortoiseshell toy makers, as the term implies, worked particularly in that material, while steel toy makers produced corkscrews, buckles, watch-chains, candle-snuffers, and other goods. The largest branch of the toy trade was that of buckle making and chape making (the chape being the part of the buckle by which it was fastened to the strap or ribbon). Buckle making and chape making were independent trades in the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>The elder Matthew Boulton's branch of the Birmingham toy trade was that of steel toys, chiefly buckles for both shoes and knee-breeches. The younger Matthew joined his father on leaving school and is said to have produced an enamelled or inlaid buckle when only seventeen years old, which contributed to the expansion of his father's business. At the age of twenty-one he became a partner in the business and his father entrusted the management to him. About 1756 he married a distant cousin, Mary Robinson (1727&#150;1759/60?), the elder daughter of Luke Robinson, an &#145;opulent mercer&#146; of Lichfield. Her mother was an heiress and Mary's share of the estate was &pound;14,000. The couple had been married only a few years when Mary died suddenly, probably in 1759 or 1760; there were no surviving children. In 1759 Boulton's father died, leaving the business to his son.<br>
<br>After several years Boulton sought to marry Anne (Nancy) Robinson (1735&#150;1783), Mary's younger sister. This was forbidden by ecclesiastical law but, supported by the view of John Fry in <span class="italic">The Case of Marriage between Near Kindred</span> (1756), in which it was asserted that &#145;marriage with a deceased wife's sister is fit and convenient being opposed neither to law nor morals&#146;  (p. 80), Boulton pressed his case, and though Anne's brother was opposed to the match it does not appear that the mother-in-law was. The marriage nevertheless took place some time prior to 1767, probably out of Birmingham, the bride also bringing with her &pound;14,000, which was her share of her parents' estate. Boulton's marriage, and with it the addition to his fortune, was the cause of a number of letters of congratulations from his friends. Later in his life, alluding to his fortune, he remarked that he had had the option of living the life of a gentleman but chose, rather, to become an industrialist.<br>
<br>Matthew and Anne had two children: Anne, who died unmarried in 1829, and Matthew Robinson Boulton (1770&#150;1842). Anne (nicknamed Nancy) developed some crippling ailment from which she never recovered. Matthew Robinson was educated according to the liberal principles espoused by his father and his associates, with much focus on chemistry, mechanics, and geology, as well as the acquisition of French and German. He, in partnership with James Watt jun., directed Soho Foundry and, on his own account, Soho Mint and Soho Manufactory after his father's death.<br>
<br>Ever a sociable individual, Matthew Boulton had a wide circle of friends, especially those of one particular group, whose number swelled eventually to fourteen and became known as the Lunar Society (an allusion to the fact that they met to dine and converse on the night of the full moon). He particularly enjoyed the company of Dr William Small, who had been introduced to Boulton by Benjamin Franklin in 1765. Small became Boulton's personal physician and also a close friend and adviser whose judgement both Boulton and, in due course, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28880/', "James Watt")</script> valued highly. Dr Erasmus Darwin of Lichfield, medical practitioner to a number of families in Warwickshire and Staffordshire, and also an author, was a founder member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/59220', "Lunar Society of Birmingham")</script>, which met at Boulton's house and, less frequently, at the homes of other members.<br>
<br>Members of the Lunar Society had been interested in the design of steam engines even before Watt joined their number. Boulton had invented a steam engine, the design of which he discussed with Erasmus Darwin and Benjamin Franklin. His toy business was the cause of his interest in metallurgy, an interest shared by William Withering and James Keir. In both Boulton's and Keir's cases intellectual interest produced industrial applications. The potter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28966/', "Josiah Wedgwood")</script> was another member of the society, and the relationship between science and industry is well illustrated in Wedgwood's plan to develop a research establishment in the Staffordshire Potteries. Wedgwood and Boulton collaborated over the production of cameo jewellery set in cut-steel mounts, Boulton, not altogether in jest, suggesting that he might establish a pottery so as to integrate the manufacture of cameo ware more effectively. Interest in chemistry and its practical applications, as, for example, in the manufacture of sulphuric acid, impacted on Boulton's silver plate, Sheffield plate, and minting activities.<br>
<br>Measurement was a concern shared by a number of the members of the Lunar Society; and Boulton's interest in it was crucial to developments in assaying as well as to engine drawing, an essential element in the steam engine business. It is clear, however, that the interplay of science and industry involved both high seriousness <i>and</i> merriment; and the latter had highly practical sides as well. Boulton, for example, joined in the late eighteenth-century enthusiasm for balloons and ballooning. When the Derby Philosophical Society sent a message to the Lunar Society by balloon (it was sent off-course by the wind), practical play and scientific experiment were closely engaged; and Boulton made a balloon to entertain his children when in Cornwall. However, as a mark of his involvement with scientific endeavours, he was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1785. In addition, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783 and was a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93805', "Society of Civil Engineers")</script> from 1792. In 1800 he became a proprietor of the Royal Institution.<h2>
<a name="Earlybusiness"></a>Early business</h2>Boulton's own career coincided with, and also contributed to, the emergence of Birmingham as a thriving provincial industrial town in the last half of the eighteenth century. Water-wheels were used in rolling and slitting mills, for blade mills (used in the edge tool trades), and in the nearby Black Country forges. Birmingham was noted for the manufacture of a great variety of metal goods. This can be, at least in part, attributed to a long tradition of working in iron and brass. The town had a tradition of liberalism; dissenters settled there and a lively and inventive commercial community emerged. A large number of patents was granted to Birmingham men during the eighteenth century, the majority of them concerned with materials such as metal alloys; with processes such as casting, rolling, and stamping; and with products such as buttons, buckles, and nails. Such was the reputation of the town that it became known as the toyshop of Europe. By mid-century Boulton was the most eminent toy manufacturer, but there were thousands of small masters, each of whose business was conducted in workshops comprising part of, or attached to, their dwelling house. Birmingham industry was characterized by the workshop rather than the factory until well into the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>In 1760 Boulton appeared before the committee of the House of Commons, representing the interests not only of the buckle makers of Birmingham but also those of Warwick and Wolverhampton, the issue being a petition for leave to bring in a bill to prohibit the export of buckle-chapes. A skilful practitioner of &#145;the Art of Parliamentary Lobbying&#146;  (Robinson, &#145;Parliamentary lobbying&#146;, 209), his evidence provided a vivid description of the scale of the buckle trade and the wages of buckle makers and chape makers. The buckle was said to be &#145;by far the most considerable Article in the Toy Trade&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 901). At this period his business consisted of the manufacture of steel toys and a mercantile business exporting a wider range of midland hardware products.<h2>
<a name="SohoHouseandSohoManufactory"></a>Soho House and Soho Manufactory</h2>Wishing to expand his business, and being constrained at his Snow Hill site, Boulton acquired the lease of a site on Handsworth Heath. The land contained a cottage, the site of which became Boulton's Soho House, while in the valley below, the brook had been dammed and a metal-rolling mill and dwelling house built. In summer 1761 he built dwellings for workmen, workshops, and a warehouse. He demolished the rolling mill and in the following year began to plan the construction of a new factory. The original architect, T. Lightoler, did not provide what was required, and the work was subsequently undertaken by various members of the Wyatt family. The Wyatts of Lichfield and Burton upon Trent were, perhaps, the most famous family of eighteenth-century surveyors and architects. They included in their number John Wyatt, who was the London agent of Boulton and the merchant John Fothergill, the carpenter William Wyatt, and the wooden-screw manufacturer Charles Wyatt, besides the architect and builder members of the family who designed and built Boulton's house, warehouse, and manufactory.<br>
<br>Benjamin Wyatt &amp; Sons were subsequently commissioned to build the Soho Manufactory to the design of William Wyatt. The factory was completed in 1766 and became a showpiece. In the 1790s Boulton engaged the architect James Wyatt to remodel Soho House. James appears to have lost interest in the project, however, and the work was eventually completed by Samuel Wyatt in 1796&#150;8. The house, while designed as a comfortable, yet elegant, family dwelling, contained several novel features. A warm-air convection heating system was installed, while the window frames were made of an alloy invented by fellow &#145;lunatik&#146; James Keir, and the elevations were slate-hung while appearing to be ashlar. Soho House survives as a museum but the manufactory was demolished in the mid-nineteenth century. Samuel Wyatt was also engaged to design a new Snow Hill warehouse for Boulton.<br>
<br>Soho Manufactory was the focus of Boulton's numerous business enterprises. In 1762 he formed a partnership with John Fothergill, which lasted until 1781. Fothergill had served an apprenticeship in K&ouml;nigsberg and had travelled extensively in continental Europe, probably for Joseph Duncumb of Birmingham as well as for Lewis and Capper. He spoke French and German, his responsibility in his partnership with Boulton being for the mercantile side of the business. He travelled largely in the Baltic for the partnership, though it traded with Italy and France as well. The partners employed a German clerk who acted as a traveller for them in Russia and was probably a contact of Fothergill's from K&ouml;nigsberg. Fothergill was clearly well connected, having friends in the world of banking and finance, but he does not appear to have had sufficient capital for his share of the partnership with Boulton and had to borrow.<br>
<br>Boulton directed his own attention primarily to the organization of production. The range of products was extended to steel jewellery, including Wedgwood's jasper-ware cameos set in Boulton and Fothergill's cut-steel mountings. Wedgwood also ordered mountings and flutings from Boulton for vases. The threatened pottery at Soho did not materialize and neither did the challenge damage the friendship between the two men. The development of Boulton's and Fothergill's business produced an invitation to Boulton to settle in Sweden, but he declined to meet the Swedish emissary.<br>
<br>The entrepreneurial flair evident in all of Boulton's business activities, and especially his close attention to fashionable design, were most noticeable in the manufacture of buttons. These, along with a wide range of other cut-steel goods, formed an important part of Boulton's output aimed at a mass market. However, like Wedgwood, he specifically targeted royalty and aristocracy in the first instance. &#145;In future we shall take care to have some thing new in the Button way against every Birth Day of our Sovereign&#146;, Boulton wrote, &#145;and shall present to such of the Nobility as we can make so free with (and such as are most dressy) some setts to garnish their Cloaths with on that Day&#146;  (Robinson, &#145;Eighteenth century commerce and fashion&#146;, 47). In his letters he often asked Fothergill to send him sets of new buttons for such special customers as the duke of Marlborough.<br>
<br>Yet unlike John Taylor, whose toy business generated considerable wealth, Boulton and Fothergill made losses over their eighteen years of trading. Fothergill had established many foreign connections, but they did not prove profitable and Boulton's London agent and banker urged that this aspect of the business be closed. As early as 1774 Fothergill had considered the business to be on the edge of bankruptcy. Relations between the partners deteriorated, culminating in charges being made by Fothergill against Boulton, which resulted in the latter's giving his partner notice that the partnership should cease on 31 December 1781; Fothergill died in the following year.<h2>
<a name="Sheffieldplateandormolu"></a>Sheffield plate and ormolu</h2>In the early 1760s Boulton acquired the technology for manufacturing Sheffield plate&#151;a sheet of silver fused to one of copper and subsequently rolled. For some years he was the only producer of Sheffield plate outside Sheffield itself, and no other Birmingham manufacturer is known to have been making Sheffield plate until about 1770. While Boulton did not introduce any improvements to the technology, he was one of the first to apply sterling silver thread instead of plated wire thread to articles, thus covering the edges where the most wear occurred and thereby concealing the copper. He manufactured Sheffield plate under the business name of the M. Boulton Plate Company. He supplied a variety of articles, including candlesticks in different patterns, jugs, tureens, and cups, and he was the first to make plated telescope tubes for the London instrument maker Jesse Ramsden. Shortly after the manufacturing of Sheffield plate was established Boulton commenced the manufacture of silver plate (that is, sterling silver ware). The same designs could be used as for Sheffield plate and by the 1780s he was commissioning designs from some of the leading architects of the day. For their part his architect friends, particularly the Wyatts, repaid him for his early commissions by introducing his wares to their landed clientele.<br>
<br>During the late 1760s and early 1770s Boulton commenced the production of another luxury product&#151;ormolu. This was made of a metal&#151;normally brass but sometimes bronze or copper&#151;which was gilded by the process of mercurial gilding and did not require assaying. Ormolu was used in a wide range of decorative wares, particularly for mounts and vases of various sorts. Production peaked in 1771 and declined soon afterwards. One of the major outlets for Boulton's ormolu, Sheffield plate, and silver plate was Christies, the auction house, in London. Some of his ormolu was purchased by George III and Queen Charlotte, pieces being acquired for Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace. A sale at Christies in 1772 failed, however, resulting in a number of valuable pieces remaining unsold and having to be reduced in price subsequently.<br>
<br>Another short-lived business was mechanical painting, in which Boulton was partnered by Francis Eginton. Eginton had been employed at Soho as a maker of Japanned ware. However, the business failed to become profitable and Fothergill insisted that it should cease. In June 1780 the agreement with Eginton was terminated. Eginton went on to establish himself as a glass painter and achieved considerable success. Boulton's technique of copying works of art has unfortunately been lost.<br>
<br>Boulton maintained a steady trade in toys to France, from which country he obtained both workmen and tools which enabled him to capture the French trade in ormolu. Besides the quality of his wares he competed on price, consistently undercutting London silversmiths in fashionable markets. Furthermore, because of his reputation as a well-regarded host, distinguished foreigners and members of the British aristocracy visited Soho, and a number of them placed orders. In endeavouring to raise the standards of taste in Britain and to introduce high-quality art wares, Boulton was encouraged by his friend the Hon. Mrs Elizabeth Montague, who remarked on &#145;our victories over the French in our contention of arts &hellip; [and] The achievement of Soho, instead of making widows and orphans, making marriages and Christenings&#146;. She urged: &#145;Go on then, sir, to triumph over the French in taste and to embellish your Country with useful inventions and elegant productions&#146;  (Dickinson, 54). The toy business was continued variously as the M. Boulton Button Company (1782&#150;1809), Boulton and Scale (1782&#150;96), and Boulton and Smith (<i>c</i>.1796&#150;1809).<h2>
<a name="BoultonandWattpartnership"></a>Boulton and Watt partnership</h2>As late as September 1778 Boulton was still not convinced &#145;how far it may be prudent in me to stick to Engines or Buttons for I can consider Buttons as a sheet anchor&#146;  (Robinson, &#145;Eighteenth century commerce and fashion&#146;, 39). Yet the business on which Boulton eventually focused most attention was his partnership with James Watt. Watt had visited Soho in 1767 and met Dr Small and Fothergill, though Boulton was absent; he also met Erasmus Darwin in Lichfield. He again visited Soho in 1768 on his journey back to Glasgow from London, where he had been on business associated with the patent which was granted him in 1769 for his improvements to the steam engine. Immediately on returning to Glasgow he informed his patron Dr Roebuck, who had taken over the engine development debts, of Boulton's desire to participate in a steam engine business. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23944/', "John Roebuck (bap. 1718, d. 1794)")</script>, who had studied medicine at Edinburgh and Leiden, was both an industrial chemist and a manufacturer. He developed the manufacture of sulphuric acid, formerly made in glass retorts, to an industrial scale in lead tanks, and established a factory for its production at Prestonpans in Scotland and also, in partnership with Samuel Garbett, in Birmingham. Together, Roebuck and Garbett established the Carron ironworks, Roebuck also leasing coalmines and establishing salt works at Bo'ness. Watt's first experimental engine was built on Roebuck's land. Roebuck was over-extended financially, however, and was therefore more ready to entertain the possibility of involving Boulton in the manufacture and marketing of the Watt engine.<br>
<br>Boulton was offered a licence to manufacture the steam engine in Warwickshire, Staffordshire, and Derbyshire, but he declined, while strongly indicating his desire to be engaged in a joint project with Watt. Roebuck's bankruptcy provided the opportunity for Boulton to take over his share in Watt's engine. In 1774 Watt moved to Birmingham and in 1775 the patent was extended for twenty-five years to 1800 by act of parliament, the Boulton and Watt partnership commencing in that year. Under the terms of the partnership Watt assigned two-thirds of both property and the patent to Boulton, while Boulton undertook to pay the expenses already incurred, to meet the costs of experiments, and to pay for materials and wages. The profits were to be divided in proportion to their shares.<br>
<br>It would be incorrect to stereotype Boulton as the entrepreneur and Watt as the inventor, for Boulton made many suggestions for improvements to the engine and Watt also had a good head for business. But there is no doubt that Boulton's flair for marketing was significant for the early success of the business. He took an order for an engine for Bloomfield colliery in the Black Country. The 50 inch diameter engine was a considerable scale-up from the 18 inch cylinder of Watt's original Kinneil engine. The engine became a showpiece to which prospective customers went and were frequently persuaded of the opportunities afforded by steam power.<br>
<br>In 1769 Boulton had told Watt that he would build a manufactory alongside his Soho Manufactory in which to construct engines for the world. The reality was rather different, as Boulton and Watt was largely a consulting engineering partnership in the early days, and only a small proportion of the engine parts, by value, were made at Soho. The first major market for Boulton and Watt engines was in Cornwall, and, despite the partners' considerable anxieties with the way mines were managed&#151;with the over-production of copper ores and the consequent temporary abandonment of engines&#151;Cornwall proved to be a lucrative market for them. It was Boulton who perceived the potential afforded by the growth of the cotton-spinning industry and urged Watt to develop a rotative engine. Before the expiry of the patent, rotative engines far exceeded the number of reciprocating engines sold per year, though in terms of horsepower they were smaller.<br>
<br>It was during the partners' frequent absences in Cornwall that James Keir (1735&#150;1820), a chemist, glassmaker, and member of the Lunar Society, moved from Stourbridge to Winson Green, giving up direct involvement in glass manufacture in order to be nearer to Soho to assist in the management of Boulton's interests. Both Boulton and Watt had a high opinion of Keir and had hoped to attract him and his capital to their business, but after some long time Keir decided not to commit his own capital to a partnership which would have meant the possibility of servicing Boulton's debts. Yet Keir did not withhold his criticisms on the management of the Boulton and Fothergill business. It seems likely that, with the shelving of the proposed partnership, Keir continued to act as an unpaid manager at Soho to the detriment of his own business interests. But by 1781 Boulton and Keir had settled their business differences and remained affectionate friends.<br>
<br>On the opening of the purpose-built steam engine factory, Soho Foundry, in 1796 Watt effectively retired from active business, though he remained a partner with Boulton and their respective sons. The company became known as Boulton, Watt &amp; Sons from 1795 to 1800 and on Watt's formal retirement in 1800, Boulton, Watt &amp; Co. The sale of steam engines to overseas customers and the attempts to obtain overseas patents were greatly facilitated by Boulton's mercantile connections as well as by his skilful networking.<h2>
<a name="SohoMintandassayoffice"></a>Soho Mint and assay office</h2>While the steam engine business was the most lucrative of Boulton's business adventures, it was the mint that appears to have given him most satisfaction. A mint to supply copper coinage to the government was established at Soho Manufactory. Towards the end of the eighteenth century Boulton undertook the supply of complete mints for overseas customers, the first one being the imperial mint in St Petersburg. Other orders followed and one of his last commissions before his death was the new Royal Mint in London. It was particularly for his mint interests that he sought out expert engravers and die-sinkers from continental Europe to enhance the level of skill at Soho Manufactory. By means of his mint machinery and the flow-production system in which it was deployed he achieved greater accuracy in the finished product.<br>
<br>Boulton's political and negotiating skills are demonstrated in his advice to Watt on the application to parliament for the twenty-five-year extension to the 1769 patent, in the persistence with which those who pirated the steam engine were pursued through the courts in the 1790s, in the creative solution to the export of steam engine parts to France when Britain was at war with that country, in the successful petition for the establishment of an assay office in Birmingham, and in his role in the establishment of the General Chamber of Manufacturers. This organization was intended to be a permanent one, representing the interests of manufacturers nationally. It was short-lived, however, the focus for its endeavours being opposition to the younger William Pitt's proposals for preferential trade between England and Ireland. A modified bill was passed but the Irish parliament had already rejected the English alterations. When Pitt planned a trade agreement with France in 1786, he refused to consult with the General Chamber of Manufacturers as an organization, though he did consult Wedgwood and Boulton, among others, on an individual basis.<br>
<br>Boulton and other manufacturers of silver plate in Birmingham sent their wares to York, Chester, or London for hallmarking prior to being sold. This resulted in delays and sometimes in damage to the goods. Boulton took the lead in the actions which finally resulted in an act of parliament for the establishment of a Birmingham assay office. Birmingham and Sheffield agreed to collaborate rather than compete, with the result that offices were established in both towns. The Birmingham office was opened in 1773 and Boulton was the first manufacturer to use its facilities.<br>
<br>Boulton played a significant role in Birmingham's public life. There was a strong element of self-interest in his promotion of canals, for not only was he an investor but he also depended on canals for transporting engine parts. Moreover, Boulton and Watt pumping engines were purchased by a number of canal companies, particularly those in the midlands. His contributions to the establishment of the general hospital and the dispensary, and his involvement in the Theatre Royal, the new fa&ccedil;ade of which was designed by his friend Samuel Wyatt, are evidence of his wider social contribution. He became high sheriff of Staffordshire in 1795.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsandassessment"></a>Final years and assessment</h2>Towards the end of his life Boulton suffered from stones in the kidneys. He endured considerable pain but even when confined to his room did not cease work. In 1802, seven years before he died, he told a banker, &#145;My doctors say my only chance of continuing in this World depends on my living quiet in it&#146;  (Boulton to Harts, 28 March 1802, Matthew Boulton MS 1788, box H). He died of kidney failure at Soho House, Handsworth, Birmingham, on 17 August 1809. His funeral, &#145;furnished in the handsomest manner avoiding ostentation&#146;  (Dickinson, 192), took place on 24 August, and he was buried in St Mary's Church, Handsworth.<br>
<br>Both Watt and Keir wrote brief memoirs of Boulton. To Watt he was &#145;not only an ingenious mechanick, well skilled in all the practices of the Birmingham manufacturers, but possessed in a high degree the faculty of rendering any new invention of his own or others useful to the public, by organising &amp; arranging the processes by which it could be carried on&#146;  (Dickinson, 203). To this Keir added that Boulton was &#145;proof of how much scientific knowledge may be acquired without much regular study, by means of a quick &amp; just apprehension, much practical application, and nice mechanical feelings&#146;  (ibid., 197).<br>
<br>Of above medium height, Boulton had grey eyes and a slightly receding forehead. He was impulsive, ebullient, and a risk taker. His insights into industrial organization and his ability to realize them were of a high order. Yet he had business failures as well as successes. He did not heed warnings from friends or colleagues when he did not appreciate the message. As Keir said, &#145;whatever he did or attempted, his success or his failure were all on a large scale&#146;  (Dickinson, 196).<br>
<br>Boulton was one of the leading innovating entrepreneurs of the industrial revolution. He found conversation easy, enjoyed entertaining, and was a gracious host. The list of visitors to Soho is a roll-call of British and foreign nobility, many of whom sat at Boulton's table and visited his manufactory. Yet, like Josiah Wedgwood, he produced for the mass market, as well as the aristocratic market, instructing his London agent to promote the goods as widely as possible: &#145;We think it of far more consequence to supply the people than the nobility only; and though you speak contemptuously of Hawkers, Pedlars and those who supply <i>Petty</i> shops, yet we must own that we think they will do more towards supporting a great manufactory, than all the Lords in the Nation&#146;  (Dickinson, 39).<br>
<br>Still known today for his support of James Watt and the manufacture of steam engines, Boulton was equally interested in producing fine bronze products for an ever-expanding consumer society. One of the most important and astute of Birmingham manufacturers, his enterprises contributed to an industrial revolution that was &#145;quintessentially industrial, commercial and urban&#146;  (O'Brien, 786).<br>
