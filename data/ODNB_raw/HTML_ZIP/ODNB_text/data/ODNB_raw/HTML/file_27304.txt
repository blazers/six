<span class="headword">Thomson,  Henry</span>  (1773&#150;1843), <span class="occ">painter and illustrator</span>, the son of a purser in the navy, was born at St George's Square, Portsea, Hampshire, on 31 July 1773. He was at school for nearly nine years at Bishop's Waltham, Hampshire. In 1787 he went with his father to Paris, and returned to London on the outbreak of the revolution in 1789. He entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1790, and became a pupil of John Opie at about the same time; remaining Opie's friend, he finished his former master's portrait of the duke of Gloucester in 1807, when Opie was on his deathbed. In 1793 he returned to the continent with his father, to complete his studies, and travelled in Italy until 1798&#151;visiting Parma, Bologna, Florence, Rome, Naples, and Venice. He returned by Vienna, Dresden, Berlin, and Hamburg in 1799.<br>
<br>Back in London, Thomson became a contributor to Boydell's Shakspeare Gallery notably <span class="italic">Perdita</span> and some subjects from <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>. As early as 1792 he had exhibited a portrait at the Royal Academy, but he did not become a regular contributor until 1800. In 1801 he was elected an associate member of the Royal Academy and in 1804 Royal Academician, <span class="italic">Prospero and Miranda</span> being his diploma work. From this time until 1825 he continued to exhibit many mythological and domestic subjects, as well as portraits, at the academy. Major works included <span class="italic">Love Sheltered</span> and <span class="italic">The Red Cross Knight</span> (both painted in 1806 and engraved in mezzotint by William Say), <span class="italic">The Infancy of Jupiter</span> (1812; engraved by Henry Meyer), <span class="italic">Eurydice</span> (1814; engraved by William Ward), and <span class="italic">Christ Raising Jairus's Daughter</span> (exh. RA, 1820; Tate collection). During the same period he contributed a large number of small illustrations to <span class="italic">The British Classics</span> (1803&#150;10), edited by John Sharpe, and other works and portraits to <span class="italic">The Theatrical Recorder</span> (1805). He also translated A. C. Quatrem&egrave;re de Quincy's <span class="italic">The Destination of Works of Art</span> (1821).<br>
<br>In 1825 Thomson was appointed keeper of the Royal Academy, in succession to Henry Fuseli, but resigned the office after two years owing to a severe illness from which he never recovered sufficiently to work again at full strength. In 1828 he retired to Portsea, where he amused himself with boating, and with making sketches of marine objects in oil on rough paper, which he presented to his friends. However, he contributed some illustrations to <span class="italic">The Ladies' Pocket Magazine</span> (1830), and continued to exhibit paintings until 1834. He died at his home, 18 Union Street, Portsea, apparently unmarried, on 6 April 1843, and was buried in Portsmouth churchyard near his mother's grave. &#145;From his secluded habits very little was known of him, except that his charity was extensive considering his means&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 100). In his will Thomson made several bequests, totalling about &pound;4000, to his friends and servants. Examples of his work are in Stourhead, Wiltshire; the Tate collection, London; and Norwich Castle Museum.<br>
<br>Though Thomson's pictures were extremely popular in his own day, they were subsequently known chiefly by the good mezzotint engravings in which they were reproduced.<br>
