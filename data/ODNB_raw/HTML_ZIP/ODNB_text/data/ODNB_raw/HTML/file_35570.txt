<span class="headword">Pooley, Sir  Ernest Henry</span>, baronet  (1876&#150;1966), <span class="occ">arts administrator</span>, was born on 20 November 1876 at 91 Portsdown Road, Paddington, London, the elder of the two sons of Henry Fletcher Pooley (1841&#150;1924), barrister, who became an assistant secretary to the Board of Education, and his wife, Susan (<i>d</i>. 1937), daughter of Edward Bond of Hampstead, London. He was educated at Winchester College and, from 1895, at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he obtained second classes in the classical tripos (1898) and the law tripos (1899). He was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1901 and joined the Board of Education as a legal assistant in 1903. In 1905 he was appointed assistant clerk to the Drapers' Company and in 1908 became clerk. On retirement from office in 1944 he was elected master (1944&#150;5), an unusual honour; and in 1952&#150;3 and 1962&#150;3 he was warden. In 1945 he published <span class="italic">The Guilds of the City of London</span>, in the Collins <span class="roman">Britain in Pictures</span> series.<br>
<br>During the First World War Pooley served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and the Royal Garrison Artillery and fought in France and Gallipoli. He became involved with King Edward's Hospital Fund for London in 1928, and was one of those who advised the government on the nationalization of the hospitals after the Second World War. Through the connection of the Drapers' Company with Queen Mary College, London, he sat on the senate and court of the University of London, which in 1948 conferred the honorary degree of LLD upon him. He was a member of several committees, among them the Goodenough committee on medical education and the Fleming committee on public schools, both appointed in 1942.<br>
<br>In 1946, on the death of John Maynard Keynes, founder of the Arts Council, which grew out of the wartime Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts, Pooley was appointed chairman. It was said that Pooley was chosen by Hugh Dalton, the chancellor of the exchequer, in preference to Sir Kenneth Clark (who had expected the job) because he had no particular interest in the arts, and so could be relied upon by the government not to press the claims of the arts too strongly. Under Pooley the Arts Council gave more attention than before to the arts in the regions, but with limited resources it concentrated on helping the best that had already developed, rather than encouraging new ventures. The council played an important part in organizing the 1951 Festival of Britain, fostering local arts festivals in twenty-two centres in Great Britain as well as a London season of the arts, but Pooley warned representatives of the local authorities at a meeting in Central Hall, Westminster, in 1949, that the arts must not necessarily be subsidized, and that many events could and should be self-supporting. Already knighted in 1932, and appointed KCVO in 1944, Pooley was created a baronet in 1953, on his retirement from the Arts Council.<br>
<br>Pooley was a companionable individual, popular at his club&#151;the Savile&#151;and fond of good hospitality, a game of bridge, a night out at the ballet, opera, or theatre, or even an evening at the Folies Berg&egrave;re. On 8 June 1953 he married Winifred Christabel (1882/3&#150;1976), the widow of his old friend H. C. Marillier, expert on tapestries, and daughter of Arthur Hopkins, artist; Pooley's previous marriage had been dissolved. Pooley died in the Royal West Sussex Hospital, Chichester, on 13 February 1966.<br>
