<span class="headword">Potter,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1650&#150;1651), <span class="occ">advocate of paper currency in England</span>, whose origins are unknown, was one of several writers on trade and money during the Commonwealth. He contributed to the widespread debate on banking and finance in the Tudor and Stuart period. Given his interest in monetary matters, it is possible that this may be the same William Potter who, prior to 1656, had been appointed registrar of debentures for the sale of the late Charles I's lands, and who was in that year appointed to assist a commission for discovering fraud regarding the debentures. However, there is no evidence to show that these two William Potters are one and the same. Nothing else is known of his life.<br>
<br>Potter explained his scheme at greatest length, but least clarity, in his pamphlet <span class="italic">The Key of Wealth, or, A New Way for Improving of Trade</span>, published in London in September 1650. He believed that the nation's wealth could be increased by reviving trade, which was languishing. The key to this, he argued, was to improve the speed of trade and, crucially, to increase the number of transactions by providing a greater supply of money or credit. The heart of his plan was that groups of merchants should undertake to issue bills of a fixed value&#151;say &pound;10&#151;payable to the bearer, so that they could circulate freely. He thus anticipated by over forty years certain essential characteristics of the first notes issued by the Bank of England on its foundation in 1694.<br>
<br>Much of Potter's reasoning was na&iuml;ve; none the less, he addressed ideas which became central to later economic theory, for example in his discussions of the mechanisms of supply and demand, or the use of trade to stimulate employment. He also implicitly recognized the risk of inflation, and argued that increasing the money supply, circulation, and the number of transactions would lead to a rise in the number of goods for sale, thus preventing price rises. This foreshadowed the quantity theory of money as expressed by Fisher in 1920, which attempted to explain the relation between the supply of money, the velocity of circulation, and the level of prices.<br>
<br>Potter's scheme did not necessarily require banks, but he acknowledged that if his plan for issuing bills spread beyond London to the main towns of England, this would effectively result in the creation of banks. Here he once again anticipated future events, for in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries small private banks did open up across England, many started by merchants. But he had reservations&#151;also prophetic&#151;about such a system, warning that bankers were &#145;lyable to <i>hazard</i> &hellip; whereby thousands are in danger of <i>ruin</i> at once&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Key of Wealth</span>, bk 4, p. 71).<br>
<br>As <span class="italic">The Key of Wealth</span> was intended not only for parliament but for the general public, Potter elaborated his ideas with much repetition, parable, and biblical justification. He presented his economic arguments much more succinctly in two further pamphlets. Published in London in October 1650, <span class="italic">The trades-man's jewel, or, A safe, easie, speedy and effectual means for the incredible advancement of trade, and multiplication of riches</span> was a condensed version of <span class="italic">The Key of Wealth</span>. In <span class="italic">Humble Proposalls to the Honorable Councell for Trade</span>, published the following year, he was somewhat more positive about the advantages of banks throughout the country, but again emphasized that these were not essential for the issue of the bills, which were the central feature of his plan.<br>
<br>Potter wrote at a time of much concern over improving the finances of the Commonwealth. In <span class="italic">The Key of Wealth</span> he referred to the ideas of Henry Robinson, who published several tracts on this theme, while Potter's own work inspired Samuel Hartlib's <span class="italic">Essay upon Master W. Potter's design: concerning a bank of lands to be erected throughout this Commonwealth</span> (reprinted in Hartlib's <span class="italic">Discoverie for Division or Setting out of Land</span>, London, 1653). Potter himself did not promote the notion of a land bank, only mentioning in passing in <span class="italic">The Key of Wealth</span> the possibility of backing bills by the value of land.<br>
