<span class="headword">Tagore,  Jyotirindranath</span>  (1849&#150;1925), <span class="occ">playwright and musician</span>, was born in Calcutta on 4 May 1849, the fifth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98328/', "Debendranath Tagore (1817&#150;1905)")</script> of the Jorasanko branch of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94946/', "Tagore family")</script> of Bengal, and his wife, Sarada Devi (1826?&#150;1875). The family occupied leading positions as entrepreneurs and religious reformers, within the civil service, and as part of the literary and artistic &eacute;lite. Jyotirindranath's second brother was the first Indian member of the covenanted Indian Civil Service, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98035/', "Satyendranath Tagore (1842&#150;1923)")</script>. Their youngest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36404/', "Rabindranath Tagore (1861&#150;1941)")</script>, was the first Asian Nobel laureate in literature.<br>
<br>The Tagore brothers grew up in an atmosphere where the British-Indian cultural encounter was generating profound controversy over new concepts and social mores at various levels of Indian life. Inevitably, the representatives of the colonial British culture dominated the interaction. Cultural leadership therefore became as important as political leadership in helping Indians to negotiate the encounter. The Tagore family contributed to that leadership by making culture the basis of their service to humanity outside the political movement. One of their contributions was to restore the Upanishadic ideal of becoming one with the world and to make that a dominant element in modern India's cultural ideology. They did this by nurturing an integrated Indian personality capable of appreciating the many currents of the Indian cultural tradition and also the liberal values of the West. They grew in their position as cultural nationalists while being at ease in high British culture. Rammohun Roy, modern India's first social reformer, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98105/', "Dwarkanath Tagore (1794&#150;1846)")</script>, the leading entrepreneur, who was Jyotirindranath's grandfather, worked for an equal racial partnership between India and Britain in all the spheres of political, economic, and cultural activity. Although this could not be achieved, its lesson was not lost on the succeeding generation. They grew up to embrace the world with a confidence that came from their education in the mother tongue, Bengali, their grounding in the Indian cultural tradition, their love of world literature, and the influence of western thought, all of which were family gifts.<br>
<br>Jyotirindranath Tagore (who was educated in Calcutta at St Paul's School, the Parental Academic Institution, and Presidency College) characterized these gifts seamlessly in his activities. He was a patriot who floated a <i>swadeshi</i> (or Indian-run) steamer company in 1884 in East Bengal to compete with the English company, Flotilla. In 1876 he founded a secret society named &#145;Sanjivani&#146; (&#145;Awakening&#146;) on the model of Mazzini's Carbonari. He was a keen hunter. He was a playwright, an editor, and a translator. His feelings for nationalism and internationalism were expressed in the number of languages he cultivated and from which he translated. He learned Marathi and French and knew Sanskrit well. He introduced Sanskrit, Marathi, and French works to Bengali readers through his translations. Between 1899 and 1904 he translated seventeen Sanskrit plays into Bengali. He translated the Marathi nationalist leader B. G. Tilak's treatises <span class="italic">Geetarahasya</span> and <span class="italic">Karmayoga</span> into Bengali. He translated not only the works of Pierre Loti and Th&eacute;ophile Gautier but other works of French history and fiction into Bengali. He also translated Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span> and Marcus Aurelius's <span class="italic">Meditations</span> from English into Bengali.<br>
<br>Jyotirindranath Tagore was a skilled musician. He presided over a homely soir&eacute;e every afternoon on the mansion's third-floor terrace with his wife, Kadambari Devi (1859&#150;1884), whom he married on 5 July 1868, who also loved cultural activities. Other participants in the soir&eacute;es included Rabindranath Tagore and the poet Akshay Chaudhuri. Jyotirindranath played the piano and violin and composed melodies to words by Rabindranath which he and Akshay then performed. Some of these early compositions became part of Rabindranath's great repertoire of songs. Jyotirindranath spoke lovingly of his home to his biographer, describing the trees and the creepers that he bought and planted on his terrace to give the surroundings the feel of woodland. He could name the many hummingbirds that flitted and sang all round his house. Jyotirindranath was also involved nationally as an organizer for the advancement of Hindustani classical music. He founded the Bharatiya Sangit Samaj (&#145;Indian Music Society&#146;) in 1897 and produced two magazines on music, <span class="italic">Binabadini</span> and <span class="italic">Sangeet Prakashika</span>. He also composed a body of hymns for the assemblies of the Brahmo Samaj, a reformist Hindu movement led by his father, following in the footsteps of Rammohan Roy.<br>
<br>Jyotirindranath Tagore also loved to draw. He sketched many portraits, mainly of his family members, of which about 2000 form part of the collection in Calcutta's Rabindra-Bharati University Museum. Seeing some of the sketches, the English painter William Rothenstein wrote to him on 14 September 1912:<blockquote>I know of few drawings which show at the same time so much sensitiveness of line and sincerity in characterisation, and there is a beauty and nobility in the expression you give to your sitters which it would be difficult to match. (Rothenstein to Tagore, 14 Sept 1912, Rabindra-Bhavana Library and Archives, Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan)</blockquote>Rothenstein arranged to publish a collection of these as <span class="italic">Twenty-five Collotypes from the Original Drawings of Jyotirindranath Tagore</span> (1914) and wrote an introduction for the volume in which he described Jyotirindranath as the &#145;finest living Indian artist&#146;.<br>
<br>Jyotirindranath Tagore was perhaps best known for his plays and satires. Among those staged during the 1870s and 1880s were <span class="italic">Puruvikram</span>, about the Punjab King Porus, or Puru in Bengali, who had stood up to Alexander the Great; <span class="italic">Ashrumati</span>, which was about the marriage of a Hindu girl and a Muslim boy; and the tragedy <span class="italic">Sarojini</span>, depicting patriotic martyrdom. His satires included <span class="italic">Kinchit Jalajog</span>, <span class="italic">Alik Babu</span>, and <span class="italic">Hatath Nabob</span>. The last was based on Moli&egrave;re's <span class="italic">Le bourgeois gentilhomme</span>. His plays were sought after by the commercial theatres of the time but he himself staged them mainly at the family mansion. Family members were keen actors and it helped that the women members had come out of the confines of the <i>andar mahal</i>, or the women's quarters, to be educated, to act on the stage, to go out socially with their husbands, to dress fashionably, and even to ride.<br>
<br>Despite such a range of artistic talents, Jyotirindranath Tagore remained somewhat unrecognized in his own lifetime. This was partly because he was overshadowed by his brother Rabindranath, but partly also because he became a recluse following the tragic death by suicide of his remarkable wife in 1884. He gave up the theatre and built a house on the picturesque Morabadi Hill in Ranchi which he named Shantidham, &#145;house of peace&#146;. He lived there alone until his death, in Ranchi, on 4 March 1925. He had no children.<br>
