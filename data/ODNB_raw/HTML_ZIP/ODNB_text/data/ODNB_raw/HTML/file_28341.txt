<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Vivian,  Richard Hussey</span>, first Baron Vivian  (1775&#150;1842), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Truro on 28 July 1775, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48392/', "John Vivian (1750&#150;1826)")</script> of Truro, vice-warden of the stannaries, and Betsy (<i>d</i>. 1816), only daughter and coheir of Richard Cranch, vicar of St Clement's Church, near Truro. Reportedly John and Betsy Vivian had thirty-two children; among the few who survived was Richard's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47482/', "John Henry Vivian")</script>. Richard received the name Hussey from his grandmother, a sister of Richard Hussey of Okehampton, attorney-general and MP for St Michael's. After attending Truro grammar school under Dr Cardew, a school in Lostwithiel, Harrow School, and Exeter College, Oxford (matriculated March 1790), where he spent only two terms, Vivian went in 1791 to France to learn the language. In 1793 he was articled to Jonathan Elford, a solicitor at Devonport, but he preferred a military career, and an ensign's commission in the 20th foot was procured for him on 31 July 1793. He did not join the regiment, and on 20 October he was promoted lieutenant in an independent company of foot; he exchanged into the 54th foot on 30 October.<h2>
<a name="AtwarintheLowCountries"></a>At war in the Low Countries</h2>Vivian was promoted captain in the 28th foot on 7 May 1794, and joined Lord Moira's reinforcements for the duke of York's army in Flanders, disembarking at Ostend in June. He took part in the operations ending in York's withdrawal to Antwerp and the concentration at the end of July of his whole force at Breda for the defence of the Netherlands. He was in hot fighting at Nijmegen at the end of October, and after its evacuation and the return of York to England, he was in the action at Thiel under General Dundas in December, and at Geldermalsen under Lord Cathcart in severe weather early in January 1795, when his regiment greatly distinguished itself.<br>
<br>Vivian returned to England in June 1795, and was stationed at Gosport. He embarked with his regiment in the autumn in the expedition under Sir Ralph Abercromby, but after some weeks at sea his transport was driven back by the weather, and in August 1796 he accompanied his regiment to Gibraltar. In August 1798 he exchanged into the 7th light dragoons, with which he took part in the expedition to The Helder, sailing from Deal on 13 August 1799 with the first division of the British army under Abercromby. He was present at the battles of Bergen on 19 September and 2 October, and at the battle of Alkmaar on 6 October. In December he returned to England with his regiment. On 9 March 1800 he was promoted major, and on 20 September 1804 lieutenant-colonel in the 25th light dragoons; he did not join the regiment, however, and on 1 December he exchanged back into the 7th light dragoons.<h2>
<a name="ThePeninsularWar"></a>The Peninsular War</h2>In October 1808 Vivian sailed in command of the 7th light dragoons for Spain; after disembarking at Corunna in the following month he joined the army under Sir David Baird. On 5 December he marched with the rest of the cavalry under Lord Paget from Astorga and on 10 December he joined Sir John Moore at Toro. In the retreat to Corunna, Vivian was frequently engaged, as his regiment formed the rearguard from Astorga to Corunna. On one occasion during the retreat Vivian, accompanied by only one non-commissioned officer, collected some 600 infantry stragglers who had been attacked by French cavalry, formed them up, and repulsed the enemy; for this he received the thanks of Paget and Moore, who witnessed his success. After the battle of Corunna (16 January 1809) Vivian embarked with the army for England. He was awarded the gold medal for the actions of Sahagun and Benavente.<br>
<br>Having recruited its losses in the Corunna campaign, Vivian's regiment was sent to Ireland in 1810. While there he was promoted colonel in the army (20 February 1812) following appointment as aide-de-camp to the prince regent (March 1811). In March 1812 he was appointed equerry to the prince. In the spring of 1813 he returned with his regiment to England, and in August he sailed with it for Spain, landing towards the end of the month at Bilbao. In September he joined Lord Edward Somerset's brigade at Olite. He was present at the battle of the Nivelle on 10 November, and was later made a colonel on the staff to command a cavalry brigade (consisting of the 10th and 14th light dragoons) of Hill's division, which was posted between Usterits and Cambo on the River Nive. Vivian was in command of Hill's cavalry at the passage of the Nive on 9 December and in the fighting that took place on the succeeding days, and in the battle of St Pierre on 13 December.<br>
<br>On 1 January 1814 Vivian was transferred to the command of the cavalry brigade of General Alten's division (consisting of the 18th light dragoons and the German hussars) at Hasparren. He advanced with the army in the middle of February, attacked the enemy at the Gave de Pau on 23 February, and took part in the battle of Orthez on 27 February, where his brigade was with the 4th and 7th divisions on the height of St Bo&euml;s. His conduct in this battle gained the approbation of Sir William Carr Beresford, and he was awarded a clasp to his gold Peninsula medal.<br>
<br>On 12 March Vivian entered Bordeaux; soon afterwards he joined Wellington in his advance on Toulouse. On 8 April he attacked a superior force of cavalry at Crois d'Orade, took about 100 prisoners, and gained possession of an important bridge over the Ers. During the action Vivian was wounded. When the 18th light dragoons returned to England the officers presented Vivian with a sword of honour. Vivian's severe wound prevented him from taking further part in the campaign, and he returned to England in June, having been promoted major-general on 4 June. In January 1815 Vivian was made a KCB (military division). His promotion severed his connection with the 7th hussars, and the officers presented him with a valuable piece of plate. He was shortly afterwards appointed to the command of the Sussex military district, with his headquarters at Brighton.<h2>
<a name="Waterlooandafterwards"></a>Waterloo and afterwards</h2>On 16 April 1815 Vivian embarked to take command of a cavalry brigade (7th, 10th, and 18th light dragoons) under Lord Uxbridge in Wellington's army in Belgium. He arrived on 3 May at Ninove, where his brigade was assembled. Towards the end of May the 7th hussars were transferred from Vivian's to Sir C. Grant's brigade and replaced by the 12th hussars of the King's German Legion. On 13 June Vivian, having personally ascertained that the French were concentrating, reported it to headquarters. On 15 June he was at the duchess of Richmond's ball at Brussels; he left to march on Enghien and thence to Quatre Bras, where he arrived after a 40 mile march over bad roads just too late to assist in defeating the French attack. On 17 June Vivian's brigade assisted to cover on the left the British retreat to Waterloo, encountering a tremendous rainstorm which, however, relieved them of some pressure from the enemy. Having bivouacked in the vicinity of the forest of Soignies on the night of 17 June, his brigade was drawn up next morning in rear of the Wavre Road. It suffered little until towards the close of the last attack, as the ground on the left was such that the cavalry could not advance.<br>
<br>About six o'clock in the evening, ascertaining that the cavalry in the centre had suffered severely, Vivian moved his brigade from the left to the right centre of the British line, arriving most opportunely as Bonaparte was making his last and most desperate efforts. Wheeling his brigade into line close in rear of the infantry, Vivian was ready to charge directly they had retreated through his intervals. Lord Edward Somerset, with the remnant of the two heavy cavalry brigades (some 200 out of 2000), retired through Vivian's brigade, which was then for about half an hour exposed to a hot fire of shot, shell, and musketry. The presence, however, of Vivian's brigade, which was shortly afterwards followed by the brigade of Sir John Ormsby Vandeleur, inspired the infantry with fresh confidence. On the repulse of Bonaparte's two huge columns of attack by the fire of the allies, Vivian led his brigade to attack the French reserves posted close to La Belle Alliance. He charged with the 10th light dragoons (the 18th being in support and the King's German Legion in reserve), and as soon as the 10th were well mixed up with the enemy and the French making off, he galloped to the 18th. Vivian was attacked by a cuirassier, but he gave him a thrust in the neck with his left hand (his right hand was in a sling from his Peninsula wound), and his little German orderly cut the man off his horse. With the 18th light dragoons he charged the second body of cuirassiers and chasseurs, defeating them, and taking fourteen guns which had been firing at them during the movement. He then ordered the 10th to charge an infantry square, which was gallantly done, the French being cut down in their ranks, and Count Lobau, who commanded an army corps, taken prisoner. The pursuit lasted as long as it was possible to see, and Vivian bivouacked for the night at Hilaincourt.<br>
<br>For his services at Waterloo, Vivian, who was mentioned in dispatches, received the thanks of parliament, a KCH (1816), and Austrian and Russian orders. During the occupation of France he was with his brigade in Picardy. He returned to England with the army in 1818, and was for a short time unemployed. On the disbandment of the 18th hussars on 10 September 1821 the soldiers presented him with a silver trumpet and banner purchased with part of the prize money for horses captured by the brigade at Waterloo. This trumpet was presented by the second Lord Vivian to the new regiment of 18th hussars in September 1880.<h2>
<a name="Politicalcareerandfinalyears"></a>Political career and final years</h2>In 1819 Vivian was sent first to Newcastle upon Tyne because of disturbances which had occurred there, and later to Glasgow, where serious riots were expected. In 1820 he was elected a whig MP for Truro, a town he continued to represent until 1825, and from 1825 until 20 July 1830 he was inspector-general of cavalry. On 22 June 1827 he was promoted lieutenant-general, and on the following day he received the colonelcy of the 12th or Prince of Wales's Royal lancers. From 1826 until 1831 he was MP for Windsor. He was a frequent speaker in the House of Commons, especially on military subjects. In January 1828 he was created a baronet. From 1 July 1831 until 1836 he was commander of the forces in Ireland; on taking up this appointment he retired temporarily from parliament, and was given the GCH. From 1830 to 1837 he was groom of the bedchamber to William IV, and from 1832 to 1834 he was again MP for Truro. In June 1834 he was awarded an Oxford DCL. In 1835 he declined the position of secretary at war. On 4 May 1835 he succeeded General Sir George Murray as master-general of the ordnance, and was sworn of the British privy council; he had become a member of the Irish privy council in 1831. Vivian's first marriage, on 14 September 1804, was to Eliza (<i>d</i>. June 1831), daughter of Philip Champion de Crespigny of Aldeburgh, Suffolk; they had daughters and two sons. His second marriage, on 10 October 1833, was to Letitia (<i>d</i>. January 1885), third daughter of the Revd James Agnew Webster of Ashford, co. Longford; they had one daughter.<br>
<br>On 29 January 1837 Vivian was transferred from the colonelcy of the 12th lancers to that of the 1st (Royal) Dragoons, and on 30 May he was given the GCB (military division). In this year he was returned to parliament as member for East Cornwall; he continued to represent it until August 1841, when he was created a peer as Baron Vivian, and took his seat in the upper house. Vivian died suddenly from &#145;aneurism of the heart&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 2.290) at Baden-Baden on 20 August 1842. He was buried in the family vault in St Mary's, Truro, and a cenotaph of white marble was erected in the church.<br>
<br>Vivian was survived by his second wife. His sons from his first marriage were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28338/', "Charles Crespigny Vivian")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28340/', "Vivian, Hussey Crespigny, third Baron Vivian")</script>] and John Cranch Walker (<i>d</i>. 1879), captain, 11th hussars, MP for Truro, and permanent under-secretary of state for war. Vivian also had an illegitimate son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28342/', "Sir Robert John Hussey Vivian")</script>.<br>
