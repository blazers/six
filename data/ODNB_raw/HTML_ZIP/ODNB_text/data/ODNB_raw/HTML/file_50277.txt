<span class="headword">Cudworth,  Cyril Leonard Elwell <span class="st"> [Charles]</span></span>  (1908&#150;1977), <span class="occ">music librarian and musicologist</span>, was born on 30 October 1908 at 115 Sedgwick Street, Cambridge, the son of David Charles Cudworth, policeman, and his wife, Alice Caroline Camps. He was one of at least two sons; his given name was Cyril but he was always known as Charles. Educated locally, he did not go on to secondary school, but took a job as an assistant in a Cambridge bookshop, spending his one free afternoon a week copying eighteenth-century symphonies and concertos into keyboard scores in Cambridge libraries or the British Museum reading room. He was encouraged in his musical studies by Edward J. Dent, professor of music at Cambridge, and during the 1930s he had jobs in several university libraries and departments. He became assistant librarian of the music section of the Cambridge University Library in 1943.<br>
<br>In 1946 Cudworth was appointed librarian of the Pendlebury Library at the university music school in Cambridge, and in 1957 he became curator, a post he held until his retirement in 1973. During these years he built up the international reputation of the library, increasing its collection; he also had an extensive knowledge of the musical holdings of other libraries in Cambridge, especially that of the Fitzwilliam Museum. He contributed the article &#145;Libraries and collections&#146; to the fifth edition of Grove's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Music and Musicians</span> (1954). As librarian he helped generations of undergraduates and scholars, and in 1958 he was awarded an honorary MA degree by the University of Cambridge. A founder member of the International Association of Music Libraries in 1953, he was a member of the executive committee of the UK branch until 1970, and helped to organize the international conference held in Cambridge in 1959.<br>
<br>Cudworth's musicological interests were concentrated mainly on English eighteenth-century music. He wrote many influential articles and he became recognized as an authority on the English symphony and the English keyboard concerto through articles such as &#145;The English symphonists of the eighteenth century&#146; (<span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Musical Association</span>, 1951&#150;2), &#145;A thematic index of English eighteenth century overtures and symphonies&#146; (<span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Musical Association</span>, 1953), and &#145;The English organ concerto&#146; (<span class="italic">The Score</span>, 1953). He drew attention to various misattributions, most notably in articles in <span class="italic">Music</span> and the <span class="italic">Musical Times</span> in 1952&#150;3 which established that the trumpet voluntary popularized by Sir Henry Wood was not by Henry Purcell but by Jeremiah Clarke and had been first printed in 1700 as &#145;The Prince of Denmark's March&#146; in <span class="italic">A Choice Collection of Ayres for the Harpsichord</span>. In &#145;Ye Olde Spuriosity Shoppe&#146; (<span class="italic">Notes</span>, 12, 1954&#150;5) he collected all the misattributions, forgeries, and hoaxes he had discovered, including the mistaken attribution to Pergolesi of a number of instrumental works. Another important article was &#145;Baroque, rococo, galant, classic&#146; (<span class="italic">Monthly Musical Record</span>, 1953), in which he attempted to define the use of these terms. One of his last publications, in 1972, was a volume on Handel in the series <span class="roman">Concertgoers' Companions</span>, a short biography with a survey of books, editions, and recordings. He contributed many articles on eighteenth-century British and European composers to the 1970 edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, and was a contributor to the <span class="italic">New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</span> (1980).<br>
<br>Cudworth also wrote plays, including <span class="italic">Mr Bach of London</span> (1942, mainly written during fire-watching duty during the Second World War), which were performed by local dramatic societies, short stories about life in the fens, poems, and a novel, <span class="italic">The Silken Chord</span>, about a seventeenth-century musician; all were unpublished. For his close friend Patrick Hadley, professor of music at Cambridge from 1946 to 1952, he wrote the words for the ballads <span class="italic">The Suffolk Lady</span> (1948) and <span class="italic">The Gate Hangs High</span> (1960), and the librettos for the cantatas <span class="italic">Fen and Flood</span> (1955, following the severe flooding of the fens and the Netherlands in January 1953), <span class="italic">Connemara</span> (1958), and <span class="italic">Cantata for Lent</span> (1962). He broadcast often, and was a frequent contributor to the Saturday morning BBC radio programme <span class="italic">Record Review</span>. He was also interested in local history and architecture, and wrote and broadcast on Dutch influence in East Anglia, his articles including &#145;The Dutch influence in East Anglia&#146; (<span class="italic">Proceedings of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society</span>, 37, 1935&#150;6 and &#145;Dutch gables in East Anglia&#146; (<span class="italic">Architectural Review</span>, 85, 1939). Charles Cudworth died on 26 December 1977 in the Chesterton Hospital, Cambridge. He left a widow.<br>
