<span class="headword">Jooss,  Kurt</span>  (1901&#150;1979), <span class="occ">choreographer and teacher of dance</span>, was born on 12 January 1901, in Wasseralfingen, a suburb of Stuttgart, Germany. His father owned a farm, but as a child Jooss felt vague inclinations toward several arts. While studying at the Stuttgart Academy of Music in 1918, he encountered the great modern dance teacher and theorist Rudolf Laban, and from then on he devoted himself to the art of dance. He worked with Laban in Mannheim, Stuttgart, and Hamburg from 1919 until 1924, when in Hamburg he met Sigurd Leeder, another disciple of Laban. Jooss and Leeder began to collaborate on a series of dance concerts featuring only themselves, &#145;Zwei T&auml;nzer&#146;. But a knee injury to Jooss prevented him from emerging as a star dancer.<br>
<br>In 1924 Hanns Niedecken-Gebhardt, artistic director of the M&uuml;nster Opera, invited Jooss to form a new company, the Neue Tanzb&uuml;hne, with members of the recently disbanded Tanzb&uuml;hne Laban. In M&uuml;nster, Jooss received acclaim for his choreographic skill in providing bold, innovative dances to support modernist stage works by the composers Egon Wellesz, Paul Hindemith, and Ernst Toch; his dance concerts moved away from Laban's expressionism toward a satiric-grotesque commentary on the encoding of social identity in movement. In 1926 Jooss and Leeder travelled to Vienna and Paris to study ballet, which Jooss soon considered an outmoded and inert art. Nevertheless, for the rest of his career he presented his aesthetic under the concept of a &#145;new ballet&#146;, rather than as a category of German <i>Ausdruckstanz</i> (&#145;expressive dance&#146;, in which movement was meant to signify the &#145;inner&#146; emotional condition of the dancer or choreographer). In the following year the city of Essen invited Jooss to establish a dance school closely affiliated with the Essen Municipal Opera, and there, at the Folkwangschule, he choreographed perhaps his greatest dances, including <span class="italic">Pavane auf den Tod einer Infantin</span> (1929), <span class="italic">Der verlorene Sohn</span> (1931), <span class="italic">Grossstadt von Heute</span> (1932), and <span class="italic">Ein Ball in Alt-Wien</span> (1932).<br>
<br>The success of Jooss's dances owed much to his close collaboration with the designer Hein Heckroth, the composer&#150;arranger Fritz Cohen, and the Estonian dancer Aino Simola (1901&#150;1971), whom Jooss had met through their work with Laban. Jooss and Simola married in 1929, and she became his chief partner in all his enterprises until her death. She gave birth to their daughter Anna in March 1931, but a subsequent illness compelled her to give up her performing career. Jooss, meanwhile, sought to intensify the right of modern dance to incorporate theatrical effects (<i>Tanztheater</i>) by collaborating with Arturo Toscanini in the 1930 Bayreuth production of Wagner's <span class="italic">Tannh&auml;user</span> in 1931 and by acting in productions of George Kaiser's <span class="italic">Europa</span> and Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Midsummer Night's Dream</span>. In 1932 Jooss created his most famous ballet, <span class="italic">The Green Table</span>, in which expressionist use of masks, brilliantly exaggerated movement, and violent scenic effects produced a powerful satire on bureaucracy, diplomatic gesturing, and political hypocrisy. But the tremendous international success of this piece failed to resolve differences between Jooss and the city of Essen in the funding of the Folkwangschule. Jooss therefore established the Ballets Jooss as a private institution that did not rely on public funds. The Nazis, however, began attacking Jooss for protecting and supporting Jews within his company. Throughout 1933 the Ballets Jooss toured Holland, Belgium, France, and Switzerland; in June the company gave its first performances in London, at the Savoy Theatre.<br>
<br>Unable to return to Germany without facing persecution, the Ballets Jooss toured constantly (1934&#150;8) in northern and eastern Europe, the United States, and eventually South America. But Jooss found his strongest support in England; there in April 1934, Leonard and Dorothy Elmhirst financed the founding of the Jooss Leeder School of Dance at Dartington Hall, Devon, which in 1935 additionally became the headquarters of the Ballets Jooss. Jooss's works of the mid- to late 1930s, such as <span class="italic">The Prodigal Son</span> (1933), <span class="italic">Persephone</span> (1934), <span class="italic">Ballade</span> (1935), <span class="italic">The Mirror</span> (1935), <span class="italic">Seven Heroes</span> (1937), and <span class="italic">Chronica</span> (1939), show his expressionism evolving from grotesque social critique to more abstract, symbolic-allegorical images that blended historical detail with dreamlike moods. The war stranded the Ballets Jooss in New York, while Jooss himself in 1940 was interned in London for six months as an &#145;enemy alien&#146;. In the following year he and Leeder moved their headquarters to Cambridge, England. In 1942 the Sadler's Wells Opera company commissioned him to direct highly successful productions of Mozart's <span class="italic">The Magic Flute</span> and <span class="italic">The Marriage of Figaro</span>, and in July of that year his daughter Christina was born. By January 1946 he was in British uniform to guide the Ballets Jooss on a tour of European cities occupied by the British army, and in 1947 he received British citizenship. But financial difficulties continued to plague the Ballets Jooss, which dissolved in 1948, when Jooss went to Chile for eight months to teach at a school established there by former members of the company. Upon his return to England early in 1949, he received an invitation from the city of Essen to revive the dance section of the Folkwangschule. From then until his death his career unfolded entirely in Germany, where he enjoyed increasing glory for his achievements as a master choreographer and teacher of German modern dance. His most distinguished student at the Folkwangschule was the great choreographer Pina Bausch. He died in a car accident in Heilbronn on 22 May 1979.<br>
<br>Jooss introduced Europe to a unique perception of modern dance. He rejected the expressionist focus on movement as the projection of individual personality; instead, he saw dance as an image of modern social reality or communal interaction, in which movement exposed the essence of social identities and relations. He taught that choreographic inspiration should derive from exaggerating the observation of movement within a particular social milieu, rather than from perfecting a set of movement tropes peculiar only to dance or to the &#145;inner&#146; life of a dancer. His idea of <i>Tanztheater</i> required modern dance to abandon the quest for purity and autonomy and to absorb the benefits of theatricality (masks, props, captivating costumes, powerful lighting effects), as well as the fascination of gestures &#145;taken from life itself&#146;. But his influence in England was much less than that of his teacher, Rudolf Laban, who migrated there in 1937 and succeeded in showing how movement theory could be applied outside dance, for example to worker efficiency and improved social interaction and group performance. This limited impact was due partly to the need of the Ballets Jooss to tour extensively outside England and partly to Jooss's rural background, which inspired him to pursue dance education and aesthetic perfection in a pastoral or manor environment rather than in the big-city culture where modern dance otherwise flourished.<br>
