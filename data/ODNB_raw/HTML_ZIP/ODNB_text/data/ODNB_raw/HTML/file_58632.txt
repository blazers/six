<span class="headword">Mulally,  Teresa</span>  (1728&#150;1803), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born in October 1728 in Pill Lane, Dublin, and baptized on 17 October, the only child of Daniel Mulally, a provision dealer, and his wife, Elizabeth. The Mulallys' circumstances were apparently comfortable, and Teresa evidently received a good education. When she was seventeen, however, the family suffered a financial and social reverse which forced Teresa to assume responsibility for her own livelihood. About 1748 she moved to Chester at the invitation of an elderly relative, who died a few years later, leaving her a legacy of &pound;70. With this she returned to Dublin, where she set herself up as a milliner. She was astute and industrious, and her considerable savings were augmented by a win of a few hundred pounds in a state lottery. At the same time, she gained a reputation for piety and charitable activities: &#145;she made ointments and other medicines for the poor, and dressed their sores; and [she] was always, while able, attentive to her sick friends and neighbours, be they rich or poor&#146;  (Savage, 56).<br>
<br>By about 1762 Mulally's parents were dead, and she was in a position to retire from business and to devote herself to her philanthropic interests. In an &#145;Address to the charitable of St Michan's parish&#146; (MS, 1766, St George's Hill archives, Dublin) she indicated the cause to which she intended to address herself:<blockquote>There are none whose necessities require more to be considered than the poor children of the female sex &hellip; many of them orphans, and the rest, by the helpless condition of their parents, scarce better than orphans. &hellip; [These girls] suffer all the hardships of extreme poverty, but &hellip; their chief misfortune is to be without any means of instruction, for want of which they grow up in such habits of ignorance, idleness and vice, as render them for ever after not only useless, but highly pernicious to themselves and the public. (Mulally, &#145;Address&#146;)</blockquote>In 1766 Mulally set up a charity school for girls in an outhouse in Mary's Lane. As the first Roman Catholic institution of its kind in Dublin, the school placed a heavy emphasis on religious instruction. Pupils were also given some academic schooling and were instructed in such skills as dressmaking and housework, &#145;whereby they may be rendered useful to society and capable of earning honest bread for themselves&#146;  (Mulally, &#145;Address&#146;). In 1771 she established a boarding-school and orphanage which, like the day school, was funded by donations and by the sale of work produced by the pupils.<br>
<br>As a devout Roman Catholic Mulally was anxious to secure the future of her projects by placing them in the hands of a religious congregation. Aware of the similar work on which Nano Nagle was engaged in Cork, Mulally embarked on a correspondence with her and during a number of visits to Cork discussed the possibility of establishing in Dublin a community of Nagle's Presentation Order (then known as the Society of Charitable Instruction). However, shortage of funds and lack of suitable recruits made such an initiative impracticable before Nagle's death in 1784.<br>
<br>By 1787 Mulally had raised enough money to purchase a site at George's Hill, on which she began to build a school and convent. Meanwhile she sought suitable candidates for the proposed Dublin community and, at her urging, a number of postulants entered the novitiate at the mother house of the Presentation Sisters in Cork. In April 1794 the first two sisters were professed for the Dublin convent. In August Mulally travelled to Cork to meet them and accompanied them back to George's Hill, where they established the first house of the Presentation Sisters in Dublin.<br>
<br>With the arrival of the sisters, Mulally handed over the management of the schools and moved from the convent in which she had been living to the orphanage next door. However, although she did not herself take religious vows, she continued to be closely involved in the affairs of the convent and schools. Described by a friend as &#145;a very keen woman&#146; with &#145;a cool head, and a masculine understanding which forecasted for ages&#146;  (Savage, 181), her shrewdness and knowledge of business helped to establish the foundation on a firm basis during its early years: in 1798, for instance, she successfully applied to the privy council for the relief of the school, as a charitable institution, from parochial taxes.<br>
<br>Mulally's health was never robust, and her correspondence with Nagle mentions a number of illnesses. In late 1802 her health worsened; she died on 9 February 1803 at George's Hill orphanage and was buried in the convent chapel.<br>
