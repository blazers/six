<span class="headword">Reading,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1645&#150;1692), <span class="occ">musician and composer</span>, of unknown parentage, is listed among the choristers of St Paul's Cathedral in 1661, and it is likely that it was he who became a junior vicar-choral in 1667 (10 October) and poor clerk (28 November) at Lincoln Cathedral. He became master of the choristers there in 1670 but in 1675 moved to Chichester Cathedral, where he was appointed organist and master of the choristers on 4 January, with the additional emolument of a Sherburne clerkship. On 25 March 1675 he applied for a licence to marry Ann Micklethwayte of Lincoln, from which it appears that he was a widower of about thirty.<br>
<br>Less than a year after his appointment to Chichester, Reading succeeded Randolph Jewett at Winchester Cathedral, becoming organist, lay clerk, and master of the choristers on 25 November 1675. On 9 September 1678 he was admonished for giving &#145;undue and over severe correction to some of the Choristers&#146; and told &#145;to take greater care and diligence in the improvement of the Choristers in Musick than hitherto he hath done&#146;  (Matthews, <span class="italic">Organs and Organists</span>, 22). This may have hastened his departure to Winchester College, where he appears as organist between 1681 and 1692. During his time there the organ was rebuilt by Renatus Harris (1683&#150;5), and his stipend as organist was considerably increased from &pound;5 to &pound;50 a year.<br>
<br>Reading was the composer of the Winchester College song <span class="italic">Dulce domum</span> and the college Latin graces (see Philip Hayes, <span class="italic">Harmonia Wiccamica</span>, 1780). The survival of his church music is rather patchy. There are remains of an anthem and burial service at Chichester, and the top and bottom parts of several anthems by him in an organ book (partly autograph) originally from Winchester and now at the University of California, Berkeley. The latter's anthems are not in such a condition as to enable a fair estimate of them to be made, apart from an agreeable setting of the responses and litany. Quite a number of his songs came out in popular miscellanies such as Playford's <span class="italic">Choice Ayres and Songs</span> (1681) and some instrumental pieces were also published. Reading died in Winchester in 1692.<br>
<br>Reading was one of three musicians of that name active in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23235/', "John Reading (c.1685&#150;1764)")</script>, organist and composer (and from 1702 to 1708 like his namesake master of the choristers at Lincoln Cathedral), was probably his son or nephew. The third John Reading, a bass singer, seems to have sung in James II's Catholic chapel and gone on to perform in a number of Purcell's works.<br>
