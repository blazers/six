<span class="headword">Shearman,  John Kinder Gowran</span>  (1931&#150;2003), <span class="occ">art historian</span>, was born on 24 June 1931 at the Louise Margaret Hospital, Aldershot, Hampshire, the only son (there was also a daughter) of Charles Edward Gowran Shearman (1889&#150;1968), army officer, and his wife, Evelyn Winifred, <i>n&eacute;e</i> White. At the time of his birth (when his parents' address was given as Elm House, Longton, Preston, Lancashire) his father was a major in the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire regiment; he served in both world wars, retiring in 1945 with the rank of brigadier. Shearman's grandfather was Ernest Charles Shearman, the architect of St Silas the Martyr, Kentish Town. Shearman was educated at St Edmund's School, Hindhead, and Felsted School, Essex. In 1951 he went to the Courtauld Institute of Art as an undergraduate, at that time a somewhat unusual step, and swiftly followed his BA with an outstanding PhD (&#145;Developments in the use of colour in Tuscan paintings of the early 16th century&#146;, 1957), which in turn led to a remarkable early article, &#145;Leonardo's colour and chiaroscuro&#146; (published in the <span class="italic">Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Kunstgeschichte</span> in 1962), and already adumbrated many of his future intellectual interests. On 29 June 1957 Shearman married Jane Dalrymple Smith, the 24-year-old daughter of Charles Clarence Smith, of the Shell Petroleum Company; they had one son (like his great-grandfather, an architect) and three daughters.<br>
<br>The major early influence on Shearman was Johannes Wilde, the deputy director of the Courtauld Institute from 1948 to 1958, although it should not be overlooked that this was Anthony Blunt's Courtauld, and that Shearman's first book was a collaborative venture with Blunt on one of the volumes of the catalogue raisonn&eacute; of Poussin's drawings (1963). Shearman joined the staff of the Courtauld in 1957 as an assistant lecturer; after progressing to lecturer and senior lecturer he was appointed a reader in 1967, and professor and deputy director in 1974, posts he held until 1979. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1976, and subsequently received numerous foreign distinctions.<br>
<br>Shearman's time at the Courtauld was arguably the most productive and inspired period of his career, and yielded numerous major articles, many on Raphael, as well as a substantial and widely acclaimed monograph on Andrea del Sarto (1965) and the book by which he became best known, <span class="italic">Mannerism</span> (1967), in the Pelican <span class="roman">Style and Civilization</span> series. In it Shearman rejected previous notions of mannerism as a reflection of personal neurosis and crisis, and instead defined it as &#145;the stylish style&#146;, drawing numerous illuminating parallels between the visual arts, literature, and music. In the early 1970s, however, there were two setbacks which were to prove profoundly influential on the course of Shearman's career. The first, which may also in part have caused the second, came with the publication in February 1970 of an article in the <span class="italic">Burlington Magazine</span> entitled &#145;Raphael at the court of Urbino&#146;. Its subject was a portrait of a girl, recently acquired by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, which Shearman argued was by Raphael. The attribution was not generally accepted, and it soon emerged that the work's export from Italy (of which Shearman was entirely ignorant) had been illegal, which led to its repatriation. The second check to a hitherto effortless rise came in 1974, when Peter Lasko succeeded Blunt as director of the Courtauld.<br>
<br>The practical consequence of these setbacks was that in 1979 Shearman crossed the Atlantic to teach at Princeton (where he had been a research fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1964), and chair the department of art and archaeology until 1985, before moving to Harvard in 1987, where he chaired the department from 1990 to 1993, and remained until his retirement as Charles Adams university professor in 2002. The intellectual consequence was that his subsequent scholarship never quite recaptured the fearlessness and bravura of his early publications, a change already apparent in the armour-plated erudition of his <span class="italic">Raphael's Cartoons in the Collection of Her Majesty the Queen and the Tapestries for the Sistine Chapel</span> (1972). The monograph on Raphael which should have been Shearman's crowning achievement was never written, and instead his final production was a dauntingly massive collection of documents, <span class="italic">Raphael in Early Modern Sources: 1483&#150;1602</span> (2 vols., 2003). In addition to that <i>magnum opus</i> Shearman's last two decades also saw the publication of <span class="italic">The Early Italian Paintings in the Collection of Her Majesty the Queen</span> (1983) and <span class="italic">Only Connect &hellip; Art and the Spectator in the Italian Renaissance</span> (1992), both of which in their different ways revealed a far greater range of concerns than his narrowly specialist publications might have led one to expect. <span class="italic">Only Connect</span>&#151;which was based on his Mellon lectures at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, in 1988&#151;also preserves much of the tone of his lecturing style, limpidly clear, utterly compelling, and relentlessly convincing.<br>
<br>Shearman's American years were darkened by the suicide of his wife in 1983. He subsequently married Sally Roskill, the former wife of another art historian, Mark Roskill, but the marriage ended in divorce (and he deleted reference to it from his <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry); he found happiness with his third wife, the art historian Kathryn Brush, whom he married in 1998. Both at Princeton and at Harvard, moreover, he attracted a succession of devoted graduate students, as well as wide audiences for his more general lectures. He was a physically compact man with a distinctly military moustache; his reputation at the Courtauld had been as a somewhat prickly if scrupulously devoted teacher, but in his new home he transformed himself into a quizzically benign if always demanding elder statesman. It is revealing that his Festschrift, <span class="italic">Coming About</span> (2002), was an American initiative, and that at least forty of its fifty-two contributors were his Princeton and Harvard graduate students.<br>
<br>Beyond the world of art history, Shearman's great passion was sailing (he was a member of the Bembridge Club), which he pursued with the same ferocious will to win that he applied to his academic career. He died of a heart attack at the wheel of a car, on holiday in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada, on 11 August 2003. He was survived by his wife, Kathryn, and the four children of his first marriage.<br>
