<span class="headword">Blackerby,  Richard</span>  (1574&#150;1648), <span class="occ">preacher</span>, was born in Worlington in Suffolk, the second son of Thomas Blackerby. He was prepared for a career in the ministry by his pious upbringing and education at Bury St Edmunds and then Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated at Easter 1587. For nine years he spent most of his time in Cambridge, where he graduated BA, probably in 1590, and gained a reputation for great skill in Latin, Greek, and especially Hebrew. His abilities were such that in later years famous divines would send him scriptural problems of a linguistic nature. While still at college Blackerby experienced a religious crisis that seems to have been inspired by the preaching of William Perkins which, as Samuel Clark reports, left Blackerby &#145;truly converted, but he lay some years in great distress of Conscience, and much perplexity of Spirit&#146;  (Clark, 57). His father brought him home temporarily in the hope that a change of air would relieve his melancholy, but relief only came on Blackerby's return to Cambridge, during which journey he experienced reconciliation to Christ and &#145;that Peace of Conscience (so well grounded, and so clearly evidenced) that he never lost it to his dying day&#146;  (Clark, 58).<br>
<br>Blackerby's ecclesiastical scruples prevented him from pursuing a career as a beneficed minister and he was never ordained. His subsequent career was governed by the desire to work as much like a pastoral minister as was possible without subscribing. After leaving Cambridge he became the chaplain of Sir Thomas Jermyn of Rushbrook in Suffolk, and then lived with Sir Edward Lewknor of Denham, also in Suffolk, presumably in a similar role. The minister of Denham was Robert Pricke (<i>d</i>. 1607), whose daughter Sarah Blackerby married in or before 1600; their elder daughters Susan and Margaret were baptized there respectively in June 1601 and June 1603, and a third, Martha, was mentioned in her grandfather's will of November 1607. From Denham, Blackerby went to Feltwell in Norfolk as the minister. He managed to keep his place there for some time but was eventually forced to move. About 1603 he found a new home at Ashen, Essex, near the Suffolk border, and he spent the next twenty-three years teaching young men who boarded with him. His pupils were a mixture of the sons of local gentlemen, tradesmen, and yeomen, and students fresh from university who required preparation for the ministry. This kind of ministerial &#145;finishing school&#146; had been a common feature of godly education from the time of Richard Greenham's Elizabethan version in Dry Drayton. Blackerby covered Hebrew, scriptural study, divinity, and other topics pertinent to the ministry. Among his pupils were Nicholas Bernard, the biographer of Archbishop Ussher, Samuel Stone, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9072/', "Samuel Fairclough (1594&#150;1677)")</script>, and Christopher Burrell (<i>d</i>. 1660); the last two married Blackerby's daughters.<br>
<br>Paternal and educational responsibilities were not permitted to hold Blackerby back from pursuing his vocation as a preacher along the Stour valley. Blackerby played a cat-and-mouse game with the ecclesiastical authorities, exploiting the fact that his home was within the range of several counties and moving between them as he was suspended. Like other contemporary preachers he seems to have drawn upon his own experience of the agonies of conscience to induce in his audience a version of the same struggle; as Clark reports, &#145;He was a mighty man in wounding Consciences by the Sword of the Spirit, and in healing them by the Blood of Jesus&#146;  (Clark, 59). His preaching style was unusual, concentrating on scriptural interpretation and adding short spiritual observations. He was a powerful preacher, and left Daniel Rogers, minister of Wethersfield in Essex, unable to come into his presence without trembling because of the &#145;Divine Majesty and Holiness which seemed to shine in him&#146;  (Clark, 65). He tempered his authority with a certain gentleness, or, as Clark puts it, &#145;His reproofs were truly, as one well expresses, Nailes dipt in Oil, driven with power into the inmost of the heart, and received with acceptation, because of the overcoming kindness they were accompanied with&#146;  (Clark, 61).<br>
<br>As well as preaching Blackerby visited individual families for prayer and exhortation. By his own estimation he was the &#145;Spiritual Father&#146; to more than 2000 people. Samuel Clark (whose tendency to emphasize the moderation of his subjects should perhaps be borne in mind) reports that Blackerby never swerved from his unwillingness to subscribe, but conformed to the Church of England as far as was possible, bringing his family to common prayer on the sabbath and on weekdays, and conducting himself with great reverence. Blackerby had a keen interest in scriptural prophecies, and was one of the first of those in his locale who came to believe in God's intention to convert the Jews. He was opposed in this by two senior Essex preachers, John Rogers and Stephen Marshall, but he eventually managed to persuade them both of the truth of his opinion. As a preacher, teacher, and disputant, Blackerby was clearly an important figure in one of the most staunchly puritan regions of England.<br>
<br>About 1629 Blackerby went to live with his son-in-law, Christopher Burrell, who in 1623 had been presented by Sir Nathaniel Barnardiston to the rectory of Great Wratting, Suffolk. Blackerby continued to preach, albeit on a somewhat reduced scale, and lectured regularly at Gastingthorpe in Essex until the end of his life. Burrell was deprived in 1638, and among the articles exhibited later against William Procter, vicar of Stradishall, and Mark Reynolds, rector of Wixoe, before the Suffolk committee for scandalous ministers was that they had opposed the preaching of Blackerby and his sons-in-law. The 1640s brought better times for all three. Blackerby's final home was Great Thurlow, where he was interim minister by 1645 and where he died in 1648. Blackerby has left no literary remains. He was the author of three spiritual diaries in Greek, Latin, and English, but they seem to have been destroyed in a fire.<br>
