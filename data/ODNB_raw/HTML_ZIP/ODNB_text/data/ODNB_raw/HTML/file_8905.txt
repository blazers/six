<span class="headword">&AElig;thelburh</span> <span class="st"> [St &AElig;thelburh, Ethelburga]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>664), <span class="occ">abbess of Barking</span>, was the sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8836/', "Earconwald (d. 693)")</script>, abbot of Chertsey and bishop of London. Nothing certain is known of her family background, though she may have originated among the Kentish aristocracy: &AElig;thelburh shares her name with the Kentish princess who became queen of the Northumbrians and a saint, and her brother's name contains the same Earcon- prefix as members of the Kentish royal dynasty (for example, Earconberht). Probably at some point between about 664 and 675, Earconwald founded a monastery at Barking, Essex, for his sister. It was a double community, housing both monks and nuns, of a type familiar in seventh-century Francia. Bede's source for his description of it in his <span class="italic">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</span> may have been modelled on an account of the abbey of Faremoutiers-en-Brie, which was led for a time by another &AElig;thelburh, one of the daughters of Anna, king of the East Angles (<i>d</i>. 654), with whom Barking's &AElig;thelburh should not be confused. Bede had at his disposal a <i>libellus</i> (a &#145;little book&#146;) of the miracles of &AElig;thelburh, now lost, probably composed at Barking, and perhaps conveyed to him by his friend, the London priest (and future archbishop of Canterbury) Nothhelm. From this source Bede drew the report that the plague of 664&#150;5 wrought heavy casualties in the monastery, so that a new cemetery had to be laid out. Among other miracles, Bede recounts that &AElig;thelburh's imminent death was revealed in a vision to one of the nuns, whose own death was later foretold by an apparition of the abbess.<br>
<br>Barking seems quickly to have acquired extensive property. &AElig;thelburh was the recipient of a charter, of which an authentic copy survives, issued by one Hodilred (&AElig;thelred), a kinsman of the East Saxon king, which enlarges the abbey's estates; this serves partially to validate otherwise questionable documents in which Earconwald himself reviews Barking's endowment by a series of East Saxon, West Saxon, and Mercian kings, and claims that he had received papal protection for the whole on his visit to Rome in 677 or 678 (though extant papal charters for Earconwald's minsters of St Paul's and Chertsey are certainly bogus).<br>
<br>The twelfth-century chronicle of John of Worcester records that &AElig;thelburh's death took place in 664 and, under 675, that she was succeeded by Hildelith. Neither year is likely to be accurate, though the day given for her death, 11 October, is also that under which she is commemorated in six pre-conquest calendars. Her burial at Barking is attested by an early eleventh-century list of saints' resting-places. Barking later celebrated translation feasts on 7 March, 4 May, and 23 September.<br>
<br>The translation of Earconwald in 1148 prompted the writing of his life and an account of his miracles, which formed the basis of accounts of the saint by John Tynemouth (<i>fl</i>. 1350; now printed in the <span class="italic">Nova legenda Anglie</span>) and by the Bollandists. It is these sources that offer the fictional information that &AElig;thelburh and her brother were born at &#145;Stallington&#146; in Lindsey; that they were the children of the local king, Offa; that &AElig;thelburh converted her father but left home to avoid marriage; and that Earconwald brought Hildelith from &#145;across the sea&#146; to instruct &AElig;thelburh in the monastic life.<br>
