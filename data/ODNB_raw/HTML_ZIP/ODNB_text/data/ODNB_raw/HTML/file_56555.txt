<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Godwine <span class="st"> [Godwin]</span></span>, earl of Wessex  (<em>d.</em> 1053), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was probably the son of Wulfnoth Cild, a thegn of Sussex. In 1009 Wulfnoth was accused of unspecified crimes at a muster of the fleet; he fled with twenty ships and a force sent to pursue him was destroyed in a storm. The context is irrecoverable, but his accuser, Brihtric, was a brother of Eadric Streona, ealdorman of Mercia, and John of Worcester says that the allegations were unjust. A few years later, &AElig;thelstan (<i>d</i>. 1014), &AElig;thelred II's eldest son, left Godwine son of Wulfnoth an estate at Compton, which had been his father's  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1503); the names are common, but Earl Godwine later held an estate at Compton, Sussex. Wulfnoth's appellation <i>cild</i> (&#145;child&#146;, &#145;young man&#146;, &#145;warrior&#146;) is normally used only of men of rank, and some of the lands in Sussex later in the possession of Godwine's heirs may have belonged to him.<h2>
<a name="Establishmentasearl"></a>Establishment as earl</h2>The life of King Edward, a work originally commissioned by Godwine's daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8483/', "Queen Edith")</script>, as a history of her family, records Godwine's gradual rise to power under Cnut. Of all his English adherents, Cnut found Godwine &#145;the most cautious in counsel and the most active in war&#146;. He took him to Denmark, where he &#145;tested more closely his wisdom&#146;, and &#145;admitted [him] to his council and gave him his sister [<i>sic</i>] as wife&#146;. (Godwine's wife, <a href="#cosubject_56555">Gytha [<i>see below</i>]</a>, was actually Cnut's sister-in-law.) On returning to England, Cnut made Godwine &#145;earl and <i>baiulus</i> of almost all the kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of King Edward</span>, 5&#150;6). This picture is confirmed from other sources. Although Godwine attests as earl from 1018, he can have held only eastern Wessex before 1020, when &AElig;thelweard, ealdorman of the western shires, was banished. The visit to Denmark was probably in 1022&#150;3, when Cnut fell out with his regent, Thorkell the Tall, earl of East Anglia. Thorkell vanishes from sight after 1023 and Godwine takes his place at the head of the earls signing Cnut's charters; it was probably then that he became earl of all Wessex, the first man to hold such authority. It is easy to see why Godwine was valuable to the new king. Sandwich, Kent, was the usual assembly place for the English fleet at the beginning of the campaigning season, as London was its permanent base and arsenal; and a man whose land and influence lay in the south-east would be of particular use to a king whose ambitions included Scandinavia as well as England.<h2>
<a name="RoyalsuccessionanddeathofAlfredtheling"></a>Royal succession and death of Alfred &AElig;theling</h2>The only surviving charter of Cnut in Godwine's favour is a grant of land at Polhampton, Hampshire  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 970, dated 1033), which included property in Winchester, but it was probably during Cnut's reign that he accumulated the many large, formerly royal manors which he held in Kent, Sussex, and Hampshire. His power is revealed in the succession crisis after Cnut's death in 1035. At an assembly in Oxford, Harthacnut (son of Queen Emma) was challenged by his half-brother Harold Harefoot (Cnut's son with his first wife, &AElig;lfgifu of Northampton), backed by Earl Leofric (<i>d</i>. 1057), the thegns of Mercia and the north, and the royal fleet based at London. Since Harthacnut was in Denmark, dealing with a Norwegian invasion, his rights were upheld by Emma, supported by the royal housecarls at Winchester, &#145;and Earl Godwine was their most loyal man&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 1035, text E). A compromise recognized Harold as regent for himself and his brother; according to John of Worcester, &#145;the kingdom of England was divided by lot&#146;  (John of Worcester, <span class="italic">Chron</span>., 520&#150;22), Harold holding the north and Harthacnut the south.<br>
<br>In 1036 Emma's exiled sons with her first husband, &AElig;thelred II, took advantage of this political instability. Only the Norman writers mention Edward's unsuccessful expedition, launched from Normandy, but that of Alfred, his brother, is widely reported. He landed in Kent and was intercepted by Godwine; he then fell into the hands of Harold I (Harold Harefoot), who had him taken to Ely and blinded, after which he either died of his injuries or was killed. The sources are divided between those which implicate Godwine in the betrayal of the atheling (the C version of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, William of Jumi&egrave;ges, and John of Worcester) and those which throw the whole responsibility on Harold I (the <span class="italic">Encomium</span>, commissioned by Emma in 1041, the life of King Edward, and the D text of the chronicle: text E says nothing about it). Whatever its nature, Godwine's involvement in the death of &#145;the blameless &aelig;theling&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 1036, text C), was to cast a shadow over his future career.<br>
<br>It must have been with Godwine's support that Harold I was recognized as king in 1037. Harthacnut &#145;was deserted because he was too long in Denmark&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 1037, text C), and Emma fled to Bruges. Only when Harold died, on 17 March 1040, was Harthacnut accepted as king; his first act was to have his half-brother's body dug up from its grave at Westminster and thrown into the Thames marshes. John of Worcester includes Godwine in the party sent to oversee this operation. According to John, Harthacnut &#145;burnt with great anger&#146; against Earl Godwine and Bishop Lyfing (<i>d</i>. 1046), whom &AElig;lfric, archbishop of York, had accused of responsibility for his half-brother Alfred's death. Lyfing was temporarily removed from the see of Worcester, given him by Harold I in 1038; Godwine had to buy the king's goodwill with a ship manned by eighty fully armed warriors and was required to swear publicly that he had not advised nor desired the blinding of Alfred &#145;but that his lord King Harold had ordered him to do what he did&#146;  (John of Worcester, <span class="italic">Chron</span>., 530&#150;32).<h2>
<a name="ApogeeofpowerunderEdwardtheConfessor"></a>Apogee of power under Edward the Confessor</h2>Harthacnut died on 8 June 1042 and was succeeded by Alfred's full brother, Edward the Confessor. Godwine's power continued to grow through the early years of Edward's reign. An earldom based on Hereford was created for his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26831/', "Swein")</script>, in 1043; and in 1044, his second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12360/', "Harold")</script>, was made earl of East Anglia. One of his younger sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11826/', "Gyrth")</script>, later became earl of Wessex. On 23 January 1045 Edward married Godwine's eldest daughter, Edith; later the same year, Godwine's nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2182/', "Beorn Estrithson")</script> received an earldom in the east midlands. In 1044 Godwine helped his friend Eadsige, the ailing archbishop of Canterbury, to secure the appointment of Siward, abbot of Abingdon (<i>d</i>. 1048), as <i>chorepiscopus</i> (assistant bishop). Eadsige is said to have given Godwine the episcopal manors of Richborough, Sundridge, Saltwood, and Langport and the lands of the secular minster at Folkestone; in the last case in return for a hefty bribe. No date is given for these donations, but it was in Edward's time that Godwine acquired the third share of the revenues of Kent (the &#145;third penny&#146;), formerly accruing to the archbishop of Canterbury. St Augustine's, Canterbury, later claimed that Godwine had seized their manor of Plumstead, Kent, though the partiality shown to Godwine and his family in the E version of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, which was written at St Augustine's in the mid-eleventh century, suggests that this too had been granted by the abbey to the earl. The effect of these acquisitions, forced or voluntary, was to bolster Godwine's comital authority in the south-east.<br>
<br>The 1040s offered Godwine and his elder sons the opportunity to increase their wealth and power. The only lands known to have been acquired by Godwine at this time are Fritton, Norfolk, bequeathed by the East Anglian lady Wulfgyth  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1539), Woodchester, Gloucestershire, which he bought for his wife, and Sandford-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, given by the king in 1050. Bosham, Sussex, was certainly in Godwine's hands before 1049 and many of the royal and comital estates entered in his or his wife's name in <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> were probably acquired from Edward in the 1040s. His second son, Harold, presumably held the comital manors in East Anglia, most of which he retained after relinquishing the earldom. Swein had similar opportunities in the west: his attempt to acquire the lands of the church of Leominster backfired, but by 1051 he held some of the estates of the defunct minster at Berkeley, Gloucestershire, and had interests in Bristol.<br>
<br>Godwine's power would have been even greater if the monks of Christ Church had succeeded in electing his kinsman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/190/', "&#198;lric")</script> as archbishop, after the death of Eadsige on 29 October 1050. In March 1051, however, the king quashed the election and appointed his own nominee, Robert of Jumi&egrave;ges, bishop of London from 1044. Robert immediately set about regaining the estates alienated to Godwine by Eadsige. The life of King Edward accuses Robert of poisoning the king's mind against Godwine, but Edward's favour to the earl was probably always a matter of expediency rather than choice. Throughout the 1040s the king was steadily building up his own following, drawn from the men who, like Robert, had accompanied him from Normandy, and he had already given the earldom of Beorn Estrithson, murdered in 1049, not to a son of Godwine, but to his own nephew, Ralph (<i>d</i>. 1057), later earl of Hereford. It was probably Robert who, as he journeyed to Rome to collect his pallium, conveyed Edward's offer of the English succession to William, duke of Normandy.<h2>
<a name="Rebellionandflight"></a>Rebellion and flight</h2>In 1051 the tensions between king and earl erupted. The life of King Edward concentrates on the role of Robert of Jumi&egrave;ges, but the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> gives a wider context. Osbern Pentecost, a Norman follower of Edward, had built a castle in Herefordshire, in Earl Swein's earldom, whose denizens &#145;inflicted every possible injury and insult on the king's men in those parts&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 1051, text E). A second castle was established at Clavering, Essex, in the earldom of Harold, by another foreign favourite, Robert fitz Wimarc  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 1052, text E). It seems that a third castle was projected at Dover, in the territory of Godwine himself. Had it been completed the &#145;shires&#146; of all three Godwinist earls would have been compromised.<br>
<br>Edward may have intended to entrust the projected castle at Dover to his one-time brother-in-law Eustace (II), count of Boulogne. The fullest version of what occurred is that of the E version of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, which is noticeably more hostile to Eustace, and more favourable to Godwine, than the D text. Eustace arrived in England in the late summer of 1051 and, after visiting the king, set out for Dover. He was clearly expecting trouble, for he and his men rode armed and in mail, and soon after his arrival a fight broke out in which nineteen of Eustace's followers and more than twenty townsmen were killed. Eustace went to the king &#145;and gave him a prejudiced account of how they had fared&#146;. The enraged Edward ordered Godwine &#145;to carry war into Kent toward Dover&#146;, but the earl refused, and when the king called a council at Gloucester, &#145;the foreigners went beforehand to the king and accused the earls&#146;. It was at this point, according to the life of King Edward, that Edward, urged on by Robert of Jumi&egrave;ges, formally charged Godwine with the murder of Alfred &AElig;theling  (<span class="italic">Life of King Edward</span>, 20&#150;21).<br>
<br>Godwine and his sons gathered their men at Beverstone, part of the manor of Berkeley, Gloucestershire, and the king summoned the levies of Earl Leofric and Earl Siward to Gloucester; Earl Ralph likewise brought the troops of his east midland earldom. The king's counsellors urged caution, saying that &#145;it would be a great piece of folly if they joined battle, for in the two hosts was most of what was noblest in England, and they considered that they would be opening a way for our enemies to enter the country and to cause great ruin amongst us&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 1051, text D). A council was called to meet at London on 25 September.<br>
<br>Godwine's support was now ebbing fast and when he was refused safe conduct to attend the London meeting, he decided all was lost. He and Swein, with Gytha and the younger members of the family, rode for their ships at Bosham and fled overseas to Bruges. Earl Harold, with his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16473/', "Leofwine")</script>, made for Bristol, where Earl Swein's ship was prepared, and went to Ireland, avoiding capture by the king's forces with the connivance of Ealdred, bishop of Worcester (<i>d</i>. 1069). Edward repudiated his wife, Edith, Godwine's daughter, and appointed his own kinsman Odda of Deerhurst as earl of the western shires; it may be at this point that Herefordshire, in Swein's earldom, was given to his nephew Ralph. A contemporary chronicler comments that &#145;it would have seemed remarkable to everyone in England if anybody had told them that it could happen, because [Godwine] had been exalted so high, even to the point of ruling the king and all England, and his sons were earls and the king's favourites, and his daughter was married to the king&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 1051, text D).<h2>
<a name="Returnandreconciliation"></a>Return and reconciliation</h2>Nothing shows more clearly the exceptional power of Godwine and his family than their successful return from exile in 1052. In Bruges Godwine made alliance with Baldwin (V), count of Flanders, cemented by the marriage of his third son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27571/', "Tostig")</script>, to the count's half-sister Judith  (<span class="italic">Life of King Edward</span>, 24&#150;5), while in Ireland Harold received aid from Diarmait mac M&aacute;el na mB&oacute;, king of Leinster. In the following year the family returned in force. Although Harold encountered strong opposition in the western shires, the south-east rose to support Godwine. The earls made for London, where the king had the support both of the royal ships and of earls Leofric and Siward; but once again, &#145;it was hateful for almost all of them to fight against men of their own race&#146;. At a meeting of the king's council, Godwine cleared himself of the accusations brought against him, and the king restored him and his sons to land and office, and received Edith once more as his queen. Godwine's chief enemies, including Robert of Jumi&egrave;ges and Osbern Pentecost, were banished. Only Earl Swein did not return; he set off from Bruges on his pilgrimage to Jerusalem, dying on his return journey, on 29 September 1052.<h2>
<a name="Deathandreputation"></a>Death and reputation</h2>Earl Godwine followed his eldest son to the grave within the year. On Easter Monday, 1053 (12 April), he was dining with the king at Winchester, when:<blockquote>he suddenly sank towards the foot-stool, bereft of speech and of all his strength. Then he was carried to the king's private room, and they thought it was about to pass off. But it was not so. On the contrary, he continued like this without speech or strength right on to the Thursday and then lost his life. And he lies there in the Old Minster; and his son Harold succeeded to his earldom. (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 1053, text C)</blockquote>Despite the glowing portrait in the life of King Edward, Godwine's posthumous reputation was not universally laudatory. He was widely accused of despoiling the church (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 1052, text C; <span class="italic">Domesday Book</span>, 1.5<i>v</i>, 72, 186), though he was remembered as a benefactor of the Old Minster, Winchester, and of Abingdon Abbey (<span class="italic">Life of King Edward</span>, 30; <span class="italic">Chronicon monasterii de Abingdon</span>, 1.469). After 1066 Godwine and his sons were an easy target for criticism, and some church land may have been acquired with the assent (or at least connivance) of his ecclesiastical contemporaries. No church claimed him as founder, but he may have been patron of the secular minster at Dover, refounded in the early eleventh century. The church, St Mary-in-Castro, which preserves its eleventh-century fabric, stands within the hill-top stronghold where Count Eustace had his battle with the townsmen in 1051. If this church was connected with Godwine, his reluctance to punish the townsmen is the more understandable. Perhaps the words of Walter Map (<i>fl</i>. 1154&#150;1210), who admired his intelligence, courage, and generosity, though disapproving of his greed, may stand as his epitaph: &#145;I do not say he was a good man, but a mighty, and an unscrupulous one&#146;  (Map, 230).<h2>
<a name="GythaandtheGodwinefamilyaftertheconquest"></a>Gytha and the Godwine family after the conquest</h2>
<a name="cosubject_56555"></a><span class="headword">Gytha</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1022&#150;1068)<span class="occ"></span>, Earl Godwine's formidable wife, was the daughter of the Danish magnate Thorgils Sprakaleg. One of her brothers, Ulf, married Cnut's sister Estrith and was father to Swein Estrithson, king of Denmark (<i>r</i>. 1047&#150;76), Beorn Estrithson, and Asbjorn. The other, Eilaf, was earl in Gloucestershire under Cnut. Gytha probably married Godwine about 1022. Her standing was high in the west of England; she was a patron of the Old Minster, Winchester, of Tavistock Abbey, and of St Olave's, Exeter. She made her husband buy her an estate at Woodchester, Gloucestershire, for her support when she stayed at Berkeley, since &#145;she was unwilling to use up anything from that manor because of the destruction of the abbey&#146;  (<span class="italic">Domesday Book</span>, 1.164). The Worcester monk Hemming records her anger when her eldest son, Swein, claimed that Cnut and not Godwine was his father; Gytha assembled oath-helpers from the noble ladies of Wessex to witness Godwine's paternity  (<span class="italic">Chartularium</span>, 275&#150;6). After the battle of Hastings, Gytha offered the victorious William its weight in gold for Harold's body; William of Poitiers says the duke would not give up the corpse, but William of Malmesbury believed that he gave the body unransomed to Gytha for burial at Waltham (William of Poitiers, 204&#150;5; <span class="italic">De gestis regum</span>, 2.306). Gytha retired to live on her western estates. The earls of Wessex had a residence in Exeter, &#145;Irlesbyri&#146;, and Gytha seems to have been deeply involved in the events at Exeter in the spring of 1068. The citizens responded to a demand for their formal submission with an attempt to bargain with King William, who replied by besieging the city. In the event the citizens capitulated and were treated with remarkable clemency. Gytha and her companions escaped from Exeter before it was yielded. She took refuge on Flatholme in the Severn estuary, with &#145;many distinguished men's wives&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 1067, text D). Their husbands had perhaps fled to Ireland, with the sons of Harold, to seek aid from Diarmait mac M&aacute;el na mB&oacute; of Leinster, their father's old ally. Two unsuccessful raids were launched from Ireland, one on Bristol and Somerset in the summer of 1068, and the other on south Devon a year later. It was about this time that Gytha left England for good, taking with her &#145;a great store of treasure&#146;  (Ordericus Vitalis, <span class="italic">Eccl. hist.</span>, 2.224&#150;5). She went first to Flanders and then to the court of her nephew King Swein. She was accompanied by her daughter Gunnhild (who may have died in Flanders) and Harold's daughter Gytha, who married Vladimir Monomakh (<i>d</i>. 1116/1125), prince of Smolensk and (later) of Kiev. The date of Gytha's death is nowhere recorded.<br>
