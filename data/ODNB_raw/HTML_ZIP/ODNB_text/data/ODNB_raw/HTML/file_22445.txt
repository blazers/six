<span class="headword">Pole,  David</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1568), <span class="occ">bishop of Peterborough</span>, is of unknown origins. He is first recorded in 1520, when he became fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, subsequently becoming law bursar there in 1524&#150;5, and sub-warden in 1528&#150;9. He had graduated BCL by January 1526 and DCnL in 1528. In the following year he became an advocate in Doctors' Commons. He accumulated many benefices, beginning as vicar of St Giles', Oxford, on 25 April 1528 (vacated by March 1531), and subsequently acquiring rectories in Devon, Derbyshire, Norfolk, and Northamptonshire, prebends in St John's, Chester, Lichfield Cathedral, and perhaps St Mary's, Warwick, and the archdeaconries of Shropshire and Derby. In addition he was keeper of the spiritualities for the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield in 1532, was appointed vicar-general and official principal for Bishop Rowland Lee in that diocese on 20 April 1534, and continued as vicar-general under Richard Sampson, Lee's successor, in 1543. He either remained in that office until 1553, or was then reappointed to it.<br>
<br>Pole was singled out as a persecutor of protestants in &#145;The Pilgryms Tale&#146;, written between 1536 and 1540. From the start of Mary I's reign he was active in restoring Catholicism, serving as commissioner at the reinstatements of Bishop Edmund Bonner to London and Bishop Cuthbert Tunstall to Durham in August 1553, for the deprivation of married clergy in Coventry and Lichfield, and on the panels that condemned John Hooper, John Rogers, Hugh Latimer, Nicholas Ridley, and Thomas Cranmer, as well as on the general royal heresy commission of 26 April 1556, being singled out as one of those who had to be present at any of its sittings. On 30 September 1554 he was empowered to exercise the jurisdiction of the see of Lichfield <i>sede vacante</i>. He assisted at the consecration of his possible relative, Cardinal Reginald Pole, as archbishop of Canterbury on 22 March 1556. Five days later, on 27 March, he was simultaneously appointed vicar-general in Canterbury diocese (he may already have been acting as such), official-principal and dean of the court of arches, and auditor of its court of audience. The experience gained from these positions helped to prepare him for higher office, and on 24 March 1557 the pope provided him to the see of Peterborough; he was consecrated on 15 August following, when he vacated his position in the arches as well as most of his other benefices. No register has survived, however, and apart from a donation of 20<i>s</i>. to the rebuilding of a parish church he left little evidence for his brief stint as bishop.<br>
<br>Elizabeth I at first appointed Pole to the commission to consecrate Archbishop Parker, but on 4 December 1558, along with Nicholas Heath, Bonner, Gilbert Bourne, and James Turberville, he sent the new queen a letter on behalf of the Catholic clergy asking her to remain loyal to the papacy. After being deprived of his bishopric before 30 June 1559, Pole may eventually have been imprisoned, possibly by the middle of 1561; if so he was at liberty again perhaps by the end of the year. His fortunes thereafter are far from clear. The claim by the Catholic apologist Nicholas Sander that Pole was among the deposed bishops who died either in prison or in exile was contradicted in 1609 by Lancelot Andrewes, who described him as dying at liberty and at home. Pole certainly seems to have been free from serious constraints in 1565, when Bishop Bentham of Lichfield complained that his residence just outside Stafford with Brian Fowler (the founder of a famous recusant family) was unsettling the area, through the visits of &#145;diverse lewd priests&#146; to Pole. The latter's subsequent whereabouts are unknown, however, and it can be said only that he died between 17 May and 6 July 1568, the dates on which his will was drawn up and proved. Pole unrepentantly entrusted his soul to the Virgin Mary and the saints. A lengthy list of bequests includes silver goblets and &pound;5 each to Fowler and his wife; &pound;5 each to Martin Audley and Richard Turner, Pole's servants; his household stuff to William Bynneslie, archdeacon of Northampton, who had been his chancellor at Peterborough, and to Christopher Hodgson and Thurston Morrey, cathedral prebendaries there; &pound;5 and Paulus de Castro on will to Thomas Bulkeley; 5 marks to Richard Gwent, nephew of the canonist Dr Richard Gwent, for his exhibition as promised, together with his uncle's ring and two other jewelled rings; and Bartolus in four books to George Dyott.<br>
<br>The rest of Pole's books went to All Souls on condition that the college pay for their transport in view of Pole's poverty. They included a number of legal texts, but also an extensive list of patristic authors, a considerable amount of Erasmus, current controversial literature by such writers as Alfonso de Castro and Ruard Tapper, writings by Stephen Gardiner and Cuthbert Tunstall, many sermons, and works by some protestant authors, including Luther. His executors were Sir Thomas Fitzherbert and John Wilkinson, a citizen of London living in Watling Street (each was compensated with &pound;7 and a goblet and ring of his choice), with Martin Audley to substitute for Fitzherbert if necessary. Fitzherbert also received another ring and Mrs Wilkinson a gilt cup that Mary I had given Pole as a new year's gift, as well as repayment of a debt of &pound;13 11<i>s</i>. Forty shillings went to Doctors' Commons. Pole left bequests for the souls of two prebendaries of Chester, Master Skelton and Master Griegson, for whom he may have been an executor, as he was for his Lichfield colleagues Thomas Powell (like Pole a fellow of All Souls) and Steven Sagar. Finally, a noble apiece went to two unnamed kinswomen in &#145;the New town&#146; and to three other relatives the right to live in his house there.<br>
