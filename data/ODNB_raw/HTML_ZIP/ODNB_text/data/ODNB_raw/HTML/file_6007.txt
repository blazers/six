<span class="headword">Colville,  Alexander</span>, <i>de jure</i> third Lord Colville of Culross  (1595/6&#150;1666), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born in St Andrews, Fife, the eldest son of John Colville (<i>d</i>. 1645&times;50) of Culross and later of Wester Cumbrae and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6009/', "Elizabeth Melville (fl. 1599&#150;1631)")</script>, daughter of Sir James Melville of Halhill, and the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6006/', "Alexander Colville (d. 1597)")</script> of Culross. He was educated for the ministry, but on 30 June 1619 left for France, where his family had connections with the Reformed church. He immediately obtained appointment as master in Hebrew and physics at the protestant academy in Sedan. Eight years later, on 31 May 1627, he also obtained the chair of philosophy, and the following December started teaching theology with a salary of 300 livres. He became a doctor in theology on 6 November 1628. His <span class="italic">Theses de natura logicae</span>, dated 24 July 1629, was published that year. On 27 September 1631 Colville married, in Sedan, Anne le Blanc de Beaulieu, daughter of Louis le Blanc de Beaulieu, minister, and Charlotte Cappel, whose brother was a minister and professor of theology at the academy of Sedan; they had at least three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>In or before 1642 Colville received an invitation to take up a post at St Andrews. About the same time his father resigned Wester Cumbrae in his favour, and he was granted a crown charter of these and other lands on 8 March 1642. It is not clear when he returned to Scotland, but he was finally appointed to a chair of divinity at St Mary's College, St Andrews, in 1647. On 23 June 1648 he was appointed to a similar chair at Edinburgh but was not admitted; the general assembly finally refused his transfer in 1650. In 1654 he succeeded as third Lord Colville, following the death without legitimate heirs of his kinsman James Colville of Culross, but he never used the title, perhaps partly because of the competing claims of James's sons.<br>
<br>At an unknown date Colville almost certainly returned to France, as he was apparently teaching in Sedan in 1656, when Jacques de Vaux praised him as being a clever philosopher, a subtle logician, and a methodical master, whose expression was brilliant and accurate. While Colville's eldest son, John, was educated at St Andrews, and became a regent there, his son Abraham (<i>b</i>. 1638) read his thesis at Sedan under the presidence of his uncle Louis le Blanc de Beaulieu on 19 November 1657 and obtained the chair of theology at the academy from 1658. Colville himself was again in Scotland in 1662, when he became principal of St Mary's College, St Andrews. In 1663 he received parliamentary ratification of all his lands because &#145;he had remained a loyal and peaceful subject during the troublous times preceding the Restoration&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scots peerage</span>, 2.551). In 1665 he settled lands at Lurg and Kincardine on his son John, now a minister at Midcalder, in connection with the latter's marriage (contract 20 October and 4 November 1665) to Mary, daughter of Sir George Preston of Valleyfield. Colville died in January 1666, aged seventy. He was survived by his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. in or after 1670), his sons John (<i>d</i>. 1670/71) and Abraham (who died in Sedan in March 1673, a few weeks after marrying Madeleine Desreumaux), and his daughter Sarah (alive in January 1681); a son and a daughter had died in St Andrews in June 1664. John's son Alexander (1666&#150;1717) became <i>de jure</i> fifth Lord Colville.<br>
