<span class="headword">Margrie,  William</span>  (1877&#150;1960), <span class="occ">philosopher and eccentric</span>, was born at 202 St George's Road, Camberwell, south London, on 7 April 1877, the youngest of five children of William Leslie Margrie, a carpenter and joiner who later had a builder's and house decorator's firm in Camberwell, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Partridge, a cook. Between the ages of five and ten he attended Gloucester Road board school, Peckham, of which, along with four other schools, he was later to become a manager. Brought up as a Baptist from a mixed Huguenot and Irish background, he regularly attended the Maze Road Baptist Chapel, Old Kent Road, where he joined the Sunday school, the Band of Hope, the Mutual Improvement Society, and the cricket club. At fourteen he was apprenticed to a mathematical rule and scale maker located at a workshop in Alder Street, Peckham, but by 1901 he had joined his father's business as a house painter. These years he recalled as frustrating as he longed for knowledge and understanding of the world; he even contemplated suicide. Later, however, his work as a house painter and a rent collector gave him the opportunity to escape many of the constraints of supervision and repetitive work, and gave him opportunities to go exploring London.<br>
<br>For twelve years from the age of thirty Margrie was a member of the Bermondsey Independent Labour Party, but he left on account of its &#145;sentimentality, its fanaticism, and its anti-British outlook&#146;. He also came to believe that Marxism was a mental disease. He then joined the South London Ethical Society. But it was as an adult student at Morley College that he experienced an awakening: he became an avowed Darwinian and it was Darwinian theory that he was to popularize for the rest of his life. He also had deeply held views on eugenics&#151;he thought modern England was increasingly feeble-minded, that the Isle of Wight should be exclusively peopled by the physically and mentally fit and renamed the Eugenics Isle, and that ministers of state should be chosen by a demonstration of their sporting prowess (though he had himself failed three or four times to be pronounced fit for military service during the First World War). His call for political leadership&#151;&#145;England is a big ship without a captain&#146;  (W. Margrie, <span class="italic">A Cockney Pilgrimage: in Search of Truth</span>, 1927, 6)&#151;reflected his belief that modern society was short of variety, spontaneity, and flair. Citizenship through knowledge of place would help, as he put it, give England &#145;an electric shock&#146;  (W. Margrie, <span class="italic">The Prophets of Peckham</span>, 1946, 5).<br>
<br>Believing he was an example of a new evolutionary stage in human development&#151;Peckham Man&#151;Margrie entered into profound civic engagement and social activity. He was an inveterate inaugurator and joiner of clubs and societies: from the Young England League, the Radio Freedom League, the London Shakespearean League, and the Incorporated Society of Authors, to the Lambeth Field Club, the Morley College Scientific Society, the South London Immortals, and the League of Nations Union&#151;although internationalism gave way to an intense local patriotism and finally to an emphatically non-fascist nationalism. In 1955 he started the <span class="italic">New Race Bulletin</span>&#151;the organ of Creative Evolution (which followed an earlier essay on John Bull which had appeared in <span class="italic">New Age</span>) and proposed the Knights of St George as a new forum for adult education that would be &#145;exciting, romantic, dramatic and glamorous&#146;  (Margrie, <span class="italic">My Struggle</span>, 11).<br>
<br>Most notably, perhaps, Margrie founded the London Explorers' Club (LEC) in September 1930. The LEC rambled, held &#145;topographical races&#146;, and awarded prizes for those displaying extensive knowledge of London. It argued for a citizens' parliament and a free metropolitan state with Margrie to be the first &#145;Mr London&#146;. &#145;Know Your London&#146; was the slogan of the LEC and for an annual subscription of just 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. members received a badge inscribed with &#145;London Pride&#146;. Yet the LEC expressed little nostalgia. As aggressive modernists, members were as likely to visit the Shreaded Wheat factory, the headquarters of the Post Office telephone exchange, or Croydon airport as sites of historical interest. Margrie said more than once that those who glorified the past were traitors to the present and members of the LEC, like Margrie, lived what he called &#145;a twentieth century life&#146;.<br>
<br>Largely self-taught, Margrie was a prolific author of books, pamphlets, and letters to newspapers. He devised a concise form of prose writing which he called Tersid, derived from the words &#145;terse&#146; and &#145;lucid&#146;, and invented the concept of a silent orchestra that produced &#145;music without noise&#146;. Widely known as the Sage of Peckham, he lived at 65 Trafalgar Avenue, Peckham, until he was bombed out on Valentine's day 1945 and removed to 24 Nigel Road which he named, in good humoured self-homage, Sage Cottage. In appearance &#145;scruffy&#146; and &#145;Victorian&#146;, he sported a large grey walrus moustache. Claiming never to have slept outside England, and stating&#151;probably self-consciously&#151;that his favourite dish was boiled beef and carrots, he was above all a Londoner. By the time of his death he was said to be the owner of several houses. He died in his sleep, on 9 January 1960 at 24 Nigel Road, Peckham. His contribution to London life across the first part of the twentieth century was substantial and his death was widely reported in the national and local press. He believed that his &#145;genius&#146; was never recognized by the nation but as a true prophet predicted that he would be rediscovered within a hundred years.<br>
