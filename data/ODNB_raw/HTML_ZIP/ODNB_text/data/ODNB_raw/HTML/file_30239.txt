<span class="headword">Yorke,  Charles Philip</span>  (1764&#150;1834), <span class="occ">politician</span>, born on 12 March 1764, was second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30237/', "Charles Yorke (1722&#150;1770)")</script>, lord chancellor, the first with his second wife, Agneta (1740&#150;1820), the daughter of Henry Johnson of Great Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. A sister, Caroline, later countess of St Germans (<i>d</i>. 1818), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30244/', "Admiral Joseph Sydney Yorke")</script> were younger siblings. Yorke was educated at Harrow School (1776&#150;80), was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1780, and matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1781 (MA, 1783). He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1787 and practised unhappily on the western circuit, wintering in Italy in 1788. He was chief justice of Ely from 1789 to 1793. His elder half-brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30248/', "Philip Yorke")</script> became third earl of Hardwicke in May 1790 and vacated his seat for Cambridgeshire, which Yorke then occupied until 1810. Worth under &pound;800 a year, he disliked undue dependence on Hardwicke's bounty. He married, on 1 July 1790, Harriet (1763&#150;1854), daughter of Charles Manningham of Thorpe, Surrey. They had no children.<br>
<br>Yorke backed Pitt's ministry and partook in legal debate in the Commons, where he moved the address in 1792. He generally supported war with revolutionary France. A Cambridgeshire militia officer from 1792 to 1811 (a colonel from 1806), he persuaded Hardwicke to warn Pitt against peace negotiations. In the 1796 parliament, in which he was often a government teller, he supported wartime taxes, and as a finance committeeman specialized in the dockyards. Pitt did not promote him, but encouraged him to serve his successor, Addington, as secretary at war and privy councillor (20 February 1801). The king praised Yorke's competence. Having declined the navy treasurership and a salary rise, he launched the Royal Military College in June 1801. His army estimates proclaimed wariness of Bonaparte. In 1802 he avoided becoming chief secretary to Hardwicke, the Irish viceroy, and twice rejected the Madras government, believing that India would be won in Europe.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1802 Yorke survived a contest in Cambridgeshire. He proposed military enlargement, moving the address when war resumed, on 25 May 1803. In June he introduced a reserve army. Following Addington's failure to negotiate a junction with Pitt, he refused the Admiralty or Home Office, with cabinet rank. But Hardwicke dictated his accepting the latter: he did so on 17 August, but regretted switching, and in October threatened resignation, relenting only when Pitt again proved unobtainable. Saddled in debate with defence and Hardwicke's Irish problems, he shared in the ministry's collapse and surrendered his office on 11 May 1804. The king had wished him to remain and to accept the barony of Morden, which he declined for financial reasons. He eschewed hostility towards Pitt's second ministry, despite opposing his <span class="roman">Additional Force Bill</span>. Pitt did not appoint him chief secretary, as Hardwicke wished, believing Yorke aspired to cabinet. Disillusioned, he avoided parliament, except to amend Pitt's <span class="roman">Enlistment Bill</span> (28 March). He spurned office without peerage and pension. Denied the Admiralty, former colleagues warning Pitt about his irritability, he declined embassy to Russia in September 1805.<br>
<br>Yorke's predilection for an all-party coalition foundered in 1806. For the king's sake he disliked opposing Grenville's ministry, but criticized its military measures on 3 April. His joining a Pittite rally in July precluded Hardwicke's intercession on his behalf with the new government. In March 1807, when the Pittites parleyed with Grenville, he rejected the governorships of Madras and Jamaica. When the ministry fell over royal opposition to Catholic relief, Hardwicke's commitment to Grenville compromised him. He stayed away in April 1807, when the Portland ministry was censured. He readily rejected Portland's offer of surveyorship of woods and forests, but annoyed Hardwicke by refusing to forswear office and by commendation of the Copenhagen expedition in the ensuing parliament. Subsequently more critical, he nevertheless privately advised the War Office, helped Perceval draft the king's speech for 1809, and defended the duke of York, whom he viewed as a victim of radical conspiracy, on 10 March. Declining the India board (Pitt's last wish for him) in April, he preferred the secretaryship at war, without cabinet rank, but Hardwicke discountenanced his re-admission to office as an isolated recruit. He opposed allegations of ministerial corruption on 5 May, whereupon Hardwicke exacted from him a renunciation of all ambitions for office. Accordingly, he requested a retirement pension on 6 June: Portland offered his, and the king's, regrets.<br>
<br>Hardwicke offered compensation or consideration of overtures from Portland's successor, Perceval, but Yorke declined the secretaryship at war (with cabinet) and other offices. Hardwicke torpedoed a final offer, on 24 October 1809, of the War Office. In January 1810, following Yorke's defence of the Scheldt (or Walcheren) expedition and denunciation of Sir Francis Burdett, Perceval, with royal approval, offered him the sinecure post of an exchequer tellership at &pound;2700 a year. On 2 February Yorke obtained exclusion of &#145;strangers&#146; from the Scheldt debate, a device seldom resorted to, and the opposition failed to dislodge him from the committee. These actions led the radical John Gale Jones to dub him an enemy of the people, and Yorke's charging of Jones with breach of privilege led to the latter's imprisonment. Hardwicke, who had approved Yorke's acceptance of a sinecure, dreaded an unsuccessful county contest, and so he withdrew on 16 March. Yorke's brother-in-law Lord Eliot returned him for St Germans on 27 April. Next day, with some reluctance, he accepted the office of first lord of the Admiralty.<br>
<br>His windows having been smashed by London rioters in April, Yorke denounced petitions against Burdett's imprisonment in June 1810. He threatened resignation when Perceval wooed Canning and Castlereagh, but defended his regency proposals of 2 January 1811. The opposition assailed him on official matters. Unhappy about Perceval's attempt to reduce navy estimates, he distrusted the prince, vowing to resign when regency restrictions expired. He was persuaded to stay but, dismayed by Baltic naval losses, resigned in March 1812, &#145;really a loss to the public service&#146; according to John Wilson Croker  (Jennings, 1.39). Following Perceval's assassination, he thwarted presentation to the regent of the successful motion for a stronger administration on 21 May. He declined, on health grounds, Lord Liverpool's offer of duchy of Lancaster (with cabinet), but promised support. Hardwicke distrusted his request to represent Reigate on the family interest as a non-partisan, and Yorke refused &pound;5000 instead. He then sat for Liskeard, another Eliot borough. His speech against admission of Catholics to parliament, to which he had always been implacably opposed, on 25 February 1813, was published. He deprecated discussion of the princess of Wales's grievances, and in April 1814 thwarted Romilly's attempt to end mutilation of traitors' carcasses, which had been upheld by Yorke's father. His defence of the corn laws and urging suppression of protest provoked another attack on his house in March 1815. Advising Castlereagh on peace-making, and Liverpool on allied military occupation of France, he backed ministers, notably on the <span class="roman">Aliens Bill</span> of 1816. His last speech was against Catholic relief, on 9 May 1817. A member of the secret committee on sedition, he voted for suspension of habeas corpus on 23 June.<br>
<br>Yorke retired from parliament in 1818. A peerage was refused him: he had been heir to Hardwicke since 1810. He declined that autumn to broker junction between Grenvillites and government; he advocated resistance to reform, solid public financing, and government economy. Outside parliament he was a fellow of the Royal Society and of the Society of Antiquaries (1801) and vice-president of the Royal Society of Literature. With William Martin Leake, he was co-author of <span class="italic">The Principal Egyptian Monuments in the British Museum</span> (1827). He died, eight months before Hardwicke, at his home, 28 Bruton Street, Berkeley Square, London, on 13 March 1834. His memorial in Wimpole church, where he was interred on 20 March, was cast from the Plymouth breakwater he had promoted at the Admiralty.<br>
