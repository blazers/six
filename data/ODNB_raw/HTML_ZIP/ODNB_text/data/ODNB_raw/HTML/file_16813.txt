<span class="headword">Livio,  Tito, dei Frulovisi</span> <span class="st"> [Titus Livius Forojuliensis]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1429&#150;1456), <span class="occ">humanist and historian</span>, was born in Ferrara, probably after 1400. Educated in Venice and Padua, he became a notary but by 1429 he was running a school in Venice in the parish of San Basso and was also described as a physician. In the early 1430s he wrote three Latin comedies, which were heavily influenced by readings of the classical playwrights but which drew themes from contemporary life and raised many hackles. He left Venice in 1433&#150;4, travelling via Florence, Rome, Capua, and Naples, where he began his <span class="italic">De republica</span>; returning to Venice in 1434&#150;5 he once again caused outbursts by two new satirical plays. He fled to Candia (Crete) and Rhodes before coming to England, probably in 1436. He subsequently claimed to have been attracted thence by the fame of Henry V in arms and of Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, in letters, but it seems more likely that he was recommended to the latter by Piero da Monte, the papal envoy.<br>
<br>In the duke's service Livio assisted with formal Latin correspondence and composed Latin plays (<span class="italic">Peregrinatio</span> and <span class="italic">Eugenius</span>). In letters of denization granted at Humphrey's request on 7 March 1437, he is described as the duke's <i>poeta et orator</i>. His employment did not prove permanent; he seems to have made enemies in the duke's circle and may have been dismissed. In 1438&#150;9 he approached the chancellor of England, John Stafford, bishop of Bath and Wells (<i>d</i>. 1452), for a post in royal service, or, failing that, for financial assistance to return to Italy. Monte secured for him a papal sub-collectorship in England but he did not take up the post, being faced with a charge of defamation by John Gele, another naturalized Englishman who held a canonry at L&uuml;beck. His letter of <i>c</i>.1442 to fellow humanist Pier Candido Decembrio suggests that he was afterwards in Milan, which he left because he was &#145;nauseated by princes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Opera</span>, xiv), and then Toulouse, where he received the degrees of doctor of physic and arts, and that he had moved to Barcelona by 1442. Decembrio urged him to lead a quiet life and to earn money. By 1456 he was once more in Venice, practising as a doctor. The <span class="italic">De orthographia</span> printed in Cologne under his name in 1480 is now thought unlikely to be his work.<br>
<br>In addition to two plays, other compositions, all of which reveal contemporary humanist trends, are directly linked to Livio's time in England. The petition to Stafford takes the form of an encomium of sixty-three lines. Another Latin poem, the <span class="italic">Humfroidos</span>, celebrates Duke Humphrey's successes against Philip, duke of Burgundy, in 1436, and may have been commissioned by the duke or else written to please him. His most famous work, the <span class="italic">Vita Henrici quinti</span> (<i>c</i>.1438), was probably commissioned by Humphrey in order to stimulate renewed interest in the French war, particularly on the part of Henry VI, to whom the work was addressed. The <span class="italic">Vita</span> was intended to glorify the duke as well as his royal brother&#151;it begins with a panegyric on Gloucester, and devotes much space to his military prowess during the conquest of Normandy. Livio's precise contribution to Duke Humphrey's patronage of humanism in England is unclear; he was only one of several Italians in the duke's service, and his works have not enjoyed scholarly esteem. But his <span class="italic">Vita Henrici quinti</span> still stands as an important and independent near contemporary account of Henry V's reign, being an early chronicle authority for the period from 1418 to 1422. It was undoubtedly a source for the Pseudo-Elmham chronicle, a longer work on Henry V written about 1445&#150;6, which is also humanist in tone and connected with Gloucester's circle. The <span class="italic">First English Life</span> of Henry V, composed in 1513&#150;14, is essentially a translation of Livio's <span class="italic">Vita</span>, with additions drawn from Monstrelet, the <span class="italic">Brut</span>, and a now lost source connected with James Butler, fourth earl of Ormond (<i>d</i>. 1452).<br>
