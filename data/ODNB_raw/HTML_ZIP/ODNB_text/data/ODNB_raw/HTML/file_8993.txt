<span class="headword">Evanson,  Edward</span>  (1731&#150;1805), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Warrington on 21 April 1731, the son of Thomas Evanson, mercer, and his wife, Margaret. His uncle, John Evanson, rector of Mitcham, Surrey, educated him, and sent him to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1745. He took the degree of BA (1750), and MA (1753). He was ordained deacon and became curate to his uncle, who also kept a school where Evanson assisted. He was ordained priest on 21 September 1755. In 1766 he became vicar of South Mimms, near Barnet. In 1769 the lord chancellor, Lord Camden, gave him the vicarage of Tewkesbury, at the request of John Dodd, MP for Reading. The bishop of Worcester, Richard Hurd, introduced Evanson, as a member of his own college, to William Warburton, bishop of Gloucester, who, on the strength of Hurd's introduction, gave him also the perpetual curacy of Tredington, Worcestershire. In August 1770 he exchanged South Mimms for Longdon in Worcestershire.<br>
<br>Evanson soon began to show doubts about the trinitarian orthodoxy. He wrote to the archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Cornwallis, who was then discussing with the bench possible changes to the liturgy, and asked for his objections to the Nicene and Athanasian creeds to be considered. Cornwallis never replied and Evanson adapted the liturgy to his own opinions. His sermon on the resurrection on Easter day (31 March 1771) was an additional provocation and a prosecution was instituted by Neast Havard, town clerk of Tewkesbury, and others, in the consistory court. In 1772 Evanson published anonymously a pamphlet upon <span class="italic">The Doctrines of a Trinity and the Incarnation of God</span>. His heterodox views were symptomatic of a growing sense of dissatisfaction among some Anglican clergymen with traditional trinitarian formulations. The Feathers Tavern Association was a London lobbying group formed in July 1771 to press for the abolition of clerical subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> and lay subscription to them in the universities [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93823', "Feathers tavern petitioners")</script>]. A petition presented to parliament in 1772 was rejected, which contributed to Theophilus Lindsey resigning his orders and establishing a Unitarian chapel.<br>
<br>Evanson's case was heard before the bishop of Gloucester on 16 January 1775. Some technical objections led to the failure of the prosecution; but appeals were made to the court of arches, and afterwards to the court of delegates. He was popular in the parish, and his court expenses were paid by a subscription of his Tewkesbury parishioners; his Longdon parishioners expressed their willingness to accept his alterations of the services. Alexander Wedderburne, the solicitor-general, defended him gratuitously, and on 31 May 1775 appointed him his chaplain. In 1777 Evanson published <span class="italic">A Letter to the &hellip; Bishop of Litchfield and Coventry</span> in which he argued that &#145;either the christian revelation is not true, or the religion of every orthodox church in Europe is fabulous and false&#146;  (E. Evanson, <span class="italic">A Letter</span>, 1777, 127). He argued that the prophecies foretold the great apostasy of trinitarianism. This overtly heterodox statement naturally led to his resignation from his living, in a letter to his bishop dated 22 March 1778. Evanson's case illustrated the difficulty of maintaining doctrinal orthodoxy in the Church of England by the system of ecclesiastical courts. Rather, the problem was resolved when Evanson resigned as a matter of conscience.<br>
<br>Evanson returned to Mitcham, and set up a school. The father of one of his pupils, Colonel Evelyn James Stuart, son of the earl of Bute, settled an annuity upon him, which was paid until his death. He held family services, using Samuel Clarke's version of the liturgy, with additional changes of his own. He administered the Lord's supper to visitors, maintaining that it was the only sacrament and intended for all social gatherings. He also wished to set up a society of &#145;Christo philanthropists&#146; to hear expositions of the authentic scriptures. He debated the sanctity of the sabbath with Joseph Priestley. Their exchanges were collected and published by Evanson with a letter to Priestley as <span class="italic">Arguments Against the Sabbatical Observance of the Sunday</span> (1792). In 1792 he also published <span class="italic">The Dissonance of the Four Generally Received Evangelists, and the Evidence of their Authenticity ExaminedE</span>. In this early work of biblical criticism he rejected the gospels according to <span class="roman">Matthew</span>, <span class="roman">Mark</span>, and <span class="roman">John</span>, the epistles to the <span class="roman">Romans</span>, <span class="roman">Ephesians</span>, <span class="roman">Colossians</span>, and <span class="roman">Hebrews</span>, and those of <span class="roman">James</span>, <span class="roman">Peter</span>, <span class="roman">John</span>, and <span class="roman">Jude</span>, besides part of the other books of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. He was again answered by Priestley (in reply to whom he published in 1794 <span class="italic">Letter to Dr. Priestley's Young Man</span>), expelled from a book club, and &#145;pestered by anonymous letters&#146;. Thomas Falconer also replied to him in a course of Bampton lectures published in 1811. Evanson also published <span class="italic">Reflections upon the State of Religion in Christendom</span> (1802) and <span class="italic">Second Thoughts on the Trinity</span> (1805).<br>
<br>On 27 July 1786, in London, Evanson married Dorothy (<i>b</i>. 1751), daughter of Robert Alchorne, a respectable merchant of Old Jewry, London, and his wife, Margaret. His bride probably brought him a fortune, as he afterwards bought an estate at Great Blakenham, Suffolk. He retired to Great Bealings, near Woodbridge, thence to Lympston, Devon, where he preached to a Unitarian congregation, and finally to Coleford in Devon where he died on 25 September 1805. He was survived by his wife. Two volumes of his collected sermons were published in 1807.<br>
