<span class="headword">Scrope <span class="st"> [Bradley]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1492), <span class="occ">bishop of Dromore</span>, was probably born at Bradley in the parish of Medbourne, Leicestershire, a member of the Scrope family, who were prominent landowners there. As his name does not occur in the records, James Tait suggested that he was perhaps an illegitimate offspring of one of the two sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24963/', "Richard Scrope, first Baron Scrope of Bolton (c.1327&#150;1403)")</script>. Thomas Scrope joined the Carmelites in Norwich, and after completing his studies there, began travelling the countryside preaching repentance, and announcing that &#145;the new Jerusalem, the bride of the Lamb, was about to come down from heaven&#146;  (Bale, <span class="italic">Cat.</span>, 1.630). Thomas Netter (<i>d</i>. 1430), the Carmelite provincial, wrote a letter of complaint to the prior of Norwich, ordering that Scrope be restrained. He retired to a hermitage in the Carmelite house, and contemporary documents in the 1440s refer to &#145;Friar Thomas, the recluse&#146; there. In the 1430s Scrope translated Philip Ribot's &#145;The institute of first monks&#146;, a classic Carmelite text, into English for his prior, Cyril Garland. On 5 May 1441 he was given a papal indult to choose his own confessor, and on 3 December 1441, at the prompting of his relations, he wrote a short treatise on the Carmelite order, which he dedicated and sent to Pope Eugenius IV (<i>r</i>. 1431&#150;47).<br>
<br>During his time as a hermit, Scrope wrote two further historical works on the Carmelites and probably a life of St Brocard, an early prior-general of the Carmelites, attributed to him and published by Daniel a Virgine Maria in 1680.<br>
<br>Possibly as a result of further family influence Scrope travelled to Rome, and on 12 January 1450 he was appointed bishop of Dromore in Ireland and consecrated in Rome on 1 February. Bale preserves the text of a letter from the provincial, Nicholas Kenton, written during the summer of 1450 (dated erroneously by Bale to 1448) to the Irish bishops, recommending Scrope and mentioning that he was coming to Ireland. However, any visit there must have been very short as Scrope was given permission to officiate in the Norwich diocese on 12 September 1450, and he was performing ordinations there regularly from this date onwards. On 24 November 1454 he was admitted as rector of Sparham, Norfolk. On 29 July 1457 Richard Misyn, another Carmelite, was appointed bishop of Dromore although Scrope continued to use the title.<br>
<br>On 3 June 1466 Scrope was admitted rector of Trowse, but he is absent from the diocesan records during the three years following. It is probably during this period that the tradition of his appointment as papal legate to Rhodes by Pope Paul II should be dated. Little is known about his mission except that John Leland records that he met a Franciscan friar there, a convert Jew from Jerusalem, with whom he had frequent talks. Sir James Ware, writing in the seventeenth century, claims that Scrope came into conflict soon after his arrival with the local clergy and people because he failed to learn their language. Scrope reappears in English records on 25 February 1469 when he performed ordinations in Maidstone and again on 1 April in Canterbury. He was back in the Norwich diocese on 17 March 1470 and continued to serve there from then on. In 1477 he consecrated the new Carmelite church in Ipswich. On 21 March 1478 Scrope performed his last ordinations in Norwich diocese, and on 27 May 1478 he was admitted rector of Lowestoft where he appears to have retired. Bale records that in his later years Scrope walked barefoot through the countryside, teaching the commandments to the people and giving away his possessions. He died on 15 January 1492, when he was said to be nearly 100, and was buried in the parish church of St Margaret, Lowestoft. Bale, a fellow Carmelite from Norwich, regarded him as a saintly man and wrote an epitaph for him in 1526.<br>
<br>Scrope's translation of &#145;The institute of first monks&#146; survives in Lambeth Palace Library, MS 192. In all he wrote four historical works on his order, three while a hermit and a later one, probably during the 1450s, addressed to Cyril, archdeacon of Dromore. Three of them, severely edited, are printed in the <span class="italic">Speculum Carmelitanum</span> (1680). A list of Carmelite saints, noted by Bale, is part of one of these works, but copied by Scrope from an earlier source. His other works, including some sermons on the ten commandments, are lost although a manuscript of liturgical offices, prayers, and other spiritual works which once belonged to him survive as BL, Harley MS 211.<br>
<br>Scrope's historical compositions are somewhat repetitive, consisting of the same quotations from other authors without any particular literary style or inventiveness. However, they were well known in the order and helped to perpetuate the idea that the Carmelites could trace their origins back to Elijah the Prophet. Scrope's reputation for holiness, though, was more well-founded, and he deserves an honoured place among the mystics of fifteenth-century England.<br>
