<span class="headword">Lewys M&ocirc;n</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1527), <span class="occ">Welsh-language poet</span>, was a native of Anglesey (M&ocirc;n), and although his birthplace is unknown, references by other poets associate him with the commote of Llifon. The sixteenth-century genealogist Gruffudd Hiraethog names Lewys's parents as Gruffudd ap Dafydd ab Ieuan Finrwth and Angharad ferch Ieuan Goch ap Madog  (NL Wales, Peniarth MS 139, ii). Gruffudd ap Dafydd ab Ieuan Finrwth, however, features as early as 1406 in a list of Anglesey submissions during the Glynd&#373;r uprising; this suggests that the Peniarth 139 genealogy has omitted a generation on the paternal side. It has been proposed  (Wiliam) that Lewys may be identical with an Anglesey poet called Llywelyn ap Gruffudd ap Gwilym included in a late sixteenth-century list of poets (NL Wales, Cwrtmawr MS 3): no poem is ascribed to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd ap Gwilym, and the names Llywelyn and Lewys are commonly equated (Tudur Aled addresses Lewys M&ocirc;n as Llywelyn). Significantly perhaps, a Llywelyn ap Gruffudd ap Gwilym appears as a party to a deed concerning land in Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy in the Anglesey commote of Talybolion which bordered on Lewys's commote of Llifon (University of Wales, Bangor, Bodorgan papers, 358). The years in which Llywelyn ap Gruffudd ap Gwilym flourished&#151;the document is datable to the reign of either Henry VII or Henry VIII&#151;are compatible with those of Lewys M&ocirc;n. A Llywelyn ap Gruffudd ap Gwilym cited as a debtor in 1516 (University of Wales, Bangor, Porth yr Aur collection, 161, 166) may also be the Llywelyn ap Gruffudd ap Gwilym of Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy, possibly alias Lewys M&ocirc;n.<br>
<br>Apart from the evidence of his poetry, which testifies to his travels among his patrons and to his bardic associates, very little is certainly known about Lewys M&ocirc;n. He may have spent some time in London practising a craft other than poetry. A poem by Rhys Nanmor (<i>fl</i>. 1485&#150;1513) requesting the gift of a buckler was addressed to a Lewys M&ocirc;n who is described as a blacksmith then resident in Temple Bar, London. That Lewys M&ocirc;n the poet was also the blacksmith of Temple Bar known to Rhys Nanmor may be indicated by an elegy which Lewys M&ocirc;n wrote for Rhys Nanmor, which implies that the two poets were acquainted. A jocular reference in a poem by Tudur Aled also implies that Lewys was associated with smithcraft, although, in this instance, he is located as practising his craft in Anglesey. Of all his poetic contemporaries it was Tudur Aled who was most closely associated with Lewys. Satirical quatrains (<i>englynion</i>) in which they vilified each other were, in reality, jocular exchanges between friends: a highly complimentary verse which Tudur composed on meeting Lewys near Oswestry Castle and Lewys's powerful elegy for Tudur (<i>d</i>. 1526) are more reliable indicators of their relationship and of their mutual artistic regard. The two poets are generally acknowledged as the leading practitioners of their craft in early Tudor Wales.<br>
<br>Just over 100 poems by Lewys are extant, most of them praise poems and elegies composed in honour of gentry patrons. A poem addressed to Sir William Griffith of Penrhyn, Caernarvonshire, referring to Griffith's imprisonment by Richard III in 1485 may be his earliest surviving work. Another early poem is the elegy he composed in 1489 for Elisau ap Gruffudd of Plas-yn-I&acirc;l, Bryneglwys, owner of the <span class="roman">White Book of Rhydderch</span>. He was evidently closely associated with the Griffith family of Penrhyn: he addressed praise poems to Sir William Griffith (<i>d</i>. 1505/6) and his son Sir William Griffith (<i>d</i>. 1531), and mourned the latter's wife, Jane Stradling, in an elegy. The Salisbury family of Lleweni, Denbighshire, also featured prominently as recipients of his poems. A clerical patron to whom he was much attracted was Robert ap Rhys of Ysbyty Ifan, chaplain to Cardinal Wolsey; other clerical patrons included Dafydd ab Owain, abbot of Aberconway, Si&ocirc;n Llwyd, abbot of Valle Crucis, and Pirs Conwy, archdeacon of St Asaph. His patrons were largely concentrated in north Wales, his native Anglesey and the north-east march being favourite haunts; it appears that he rarely ventured to south Wales, although he found important patrons there in Sir Rhys ap Thomas and Sir William Herbert of Colebrook. An unusually high proportion of Lewys's extant poems consists of elegies; among them are poems commemorating his bardic contemporaries Dafydd ab Edmwnd, Rhys Nanmor, and Tudur Aled.<br>
<br>Lewys M&ocirc;n was a learned, highly allusive poet and a skilled literary craftsman. He and Tudur Aled were masterly exponents of the art of <i>cynghanedd</i>: this mandatory feature of classical Welsh verse (involving consonance, sometimes combined with internal rhyme) is seen at its most complex in their work. Lewys, however, lacked Tudur's imaginative force and verbal fluency; his intricate <i>cynghanedd</i> is sometimes too intrusive, his verse too densely textured. Though not in the very front rank of medieval Welsh poets, he nevertheless composed some powerful individual poems.<br>
<br>An extract from the will, no longer extant, of a Lodowidus Mon, dated 12 April 1527 at Valle Crucis and proved on 28 June 1527, was published in <span class="italic">Archaeologia Cambrensis</span> in 1880. The testator was undoubtedly Lewys M&ocirc;n: the legatees included his former patrons Abbot Si&ocirc;n Llwyd and Robert ap Rhys; one of the witnesses was the Anglesey poet Wiliam Alaw, probably a kinsman of Dafydd Alaw, who commemorated Lewys as a &#145;chief poet&#146; (<i>pencerdd</i>) in an elegy. Manuscripts record Valle Crucis Abbey, near Llangollen, as his burial place.<br>
