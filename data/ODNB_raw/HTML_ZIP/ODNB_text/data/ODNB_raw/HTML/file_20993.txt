<span class="headword">Owen,  Edward</span>  (1728/9&#150;1807), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and translator</span>, was the third son of David Owen of Llangurig, Montgomeryshire. He matriculated at Jesus College, Oxford, on 22 March 1746, aged seventeen, graduating BA on 1 December 1749 and MA on 1 June 1752. He was appointed headmaster of the grammar school at Warrington on 4 June 1757, incumbent of Sankey Chapel in 1763, and rector of Warrington on 14 September 1767, an office he retained until his death. He was a strong supporter of the established church, and in 1790 preached a sermon voicing his opposition to any increase in the privileges granted to dissenters. He supervised extensive repairs to both church and school, and both as master and clergyman he acquired a high local reputation. Among his pupils were George Tierney, president of the Board of Control; Dr John Wright, fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford; John Almon, Dr Thomas Barnes, and John Fitchett. He was president of the Warrington Library, which was established in 1760, and took a prominent part in the promotion of the literary and social interests of the town.<br>
<br>Owen published textbooks dealing with Latin grammar and metre, but his chief work was his translation of Juvenal's <span class="italic">Satires</span>, &#145;cleared of all the most exceptionable passages&#146;, which was published in 1785 together with Thomas Brewster's translation of Persius. A further edition, now including Owen's own translation of Persius, appeared in 1786. The translation was aimed at fellow teachers and their pupils, and he observes in the preface that &#145;there are but few masters, who wish not to see the beauties of the manly Juvenal separated from his impurities&#146;. Owen aimed to surpass Juvenal's earlier translators in &#145;ease and spirit, (not excepting the great and masculine but slovenly Dryden himself)&#146;, but his bowdlerised version was not a great success.<br>
<br>Owen's high opinion of himself was singled out for satire by Thomas Seddon in his <span class="italic">Characteristic Strictures</span> (1779) where he lampoons the vicar of Warrington as the epitome of self-consequence. However Gilbert Wakefield had a better opinion of Owen, whom he describes as &#145;a man of most elegant learning, unimpeachable veracity, and peculiar benevolence of heart&#146;  (Wakefield, 161). Owen died unmarried in April 1807, and was buried in the chancel of Warrington parish church.<br>
