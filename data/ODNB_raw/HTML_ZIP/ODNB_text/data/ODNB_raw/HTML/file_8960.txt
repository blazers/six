</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Evans, Sir  George de Lacy</span>  (1787&#150;1870), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 7 October 1787 in Moig, co. Limerick, the third son of John Evans, a small landed proprietor, and his wife, Mary Ann, a descendant of the Anglo-Norman family of de Lacy, which had a distinguished military tradition. Evans attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, before joining the army in India as a volunteer in 1806. Appointed ensign in the 22nd foot on 1 February 1807, he displayed an instinctive boldness and daring in the campaign against Amir Khan, and was promoted for gallantry to the rank of lieutenant on 1 December 1808. He served under Major-General the Hon. John Abercromby in the capture of Mauritius (1810) but declined an appointment on Sir John Malcolm's mission to Persia, preferring active service in the Deccan. In March 1812 he exchanged into the 3rd dragoons, then serving with Wellington in the Peninsula. He participated in the rear-guard action during the retreat from Burgos (1812) and, despite being wounded in the action at the Hermoza River, remained in the saddle as an example to his men. He led several cavalry charges at Vitoria (21 June 1813), earned plaudits for his daring in the battle of Sorauren, had a horse shot from under him at Bayonne, and served in the actions of Nivelle, Orthez, and Tarbes. In the battle of Toulouse (10 April 1814) he was twice wounded and had two horses shot from under him. Ever eager for combat, he served as an engineer in the trenches before San Sebastian and in the siege of Pamplona. Apart from a brief attachment to the quartermaster-general's department (13 March &#150; 25 May 1814), and the award of the military general service medal with bars for Vitoria, the Pyrenees, and Toulouse, his Peninsular services were unrecognized, leaving him deeply embittered about the purchase system of promotion in the army.<br>
<br>Evans found further action in the Anglo-American War, during which he served on the staff of Major-General Robert Ross. He had another two horses shot from under him in the battle of Bladensburg (24 August 1814), took part in the retaliatory burning of public buildings in Washington, and served in the abortive assault on Baltimore. As the only soldier in the naval operations which preceded the battle of New Orleans, he earned the naval general service medal, and subsequently participated in the disastrous attacks on New Orleans (December 1814 and January 1815), where he was twice wounded but praised for his &#145;indefatigable zeal and intelligence&#146;. Mentioned five times in dispatches from the United States, Evans was promoted captain in the 5th West India regiment (12 January 1815), and gained a brevet majority (11 May 1815) on his appointment as deputy quartermaster-general with the duke of Wellington's army in the Southern Netherlands. He served at Quatre Bras and then at Waterloo (18 June 1815), where he had two horses shot or sabred from under him but gave the order for the advance of the Union brigade of cavalry and assisted in reorganizing the brigade after its charge. Made a brevet lieutenant-colonel on 18 June 1815, he remained on the staff of the army of occupation until its withdrawal from France.<br>
<br>Placed on half pay (25 April 1817) and frustrated in his hopes for further military employment, Evans immersed himself in radical politics. A Russophobe, he wrote two alarmist books which sounded the tocsin over a possible Russian threat to the empire. They prompted an official inquiry by the India board (1830) into the state of Britain's imperial defences and advanced his political credentials. Adopted as the radical candidate for Rye, he narrowly won and lost elections in 1830 before regaining his seat in the pre-reformed parliament in 1831. An assiduous MP, he regularly attended meetings in Rye and spoke in parliamentary debates, but was never a good orator. He based his speeches upon masses of factual data and lengthy quotations, and was often criticized as inaudible and sometimes incoherent. Nevertheless he promoted many radical causes, such as electoral reform, the ballot, triennial parliaments, Polish independence, Irish reform, and the separation of church and state. He advocated the abolition of slavery, military flogging, the purchase system, and the corn laws, and deplored the use of the yeomanry to maintain public order. His extreme radicalism, together with boundary changes, lost him elections in Rye and Westminster in 1832, but in 1833 he defeated Sir John Cam Hobhouse in a Westminster by-election, profiting from a tory candidacy which split the anti-radical vote. In the Commons he championed the causes which concerned many of his metropolitan constituents, including the burdens of assessed taxation on houses and windows, the powers of the Metropolitan Police, and the <span class="roman">Poor Law Amendment Act</span>. He was re-elected in January 1835. On 21 June 1834 he married Josette Hughes (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Arbuthnot), a wealthy widow. They had no children.<br>
<br>In May 1835 General Alava, the Spanish ambassador in London, obtained the permission of the king and of Lord Melbourne's ministry to raise a force of 10,000 volunteers, which would be known as the British Legion, to support the Spanish constitutional cause against the Carlist insurrection. While tories disparaged the volunteers as mercenaries Evans, a prominent advocate of the constitutional cause in Spain and Portugal, accepted the offer of command. Now politically and financially secure, and with the local rank of lieutenant-general and a salary of &pound;5000 a year from Madrid, he yearned for field command. When Evans assumed command of the legion in San Sebastian in August 1835 he found his corps undermanned (with only some 7000 effective soldiers), untrained (as training had been banned in Britain), and bereft of experienced officers (as the duke of Wellington and Lord Hill, the commander-in-chief, had explicitly condemned military service in Spain). Still willing to proffer support to the Spanish cause, Evans marched his forces over 150 miles to Vitoria in December, assisted in the skirmish at Arlaban (16 January 1836), and, accompanied by a battalion of Royal Marines under Lord John Hay, raised the siege of San Sebastian (5 May 1836) after a fierce battle. The Madrid authorities, none the less, utterly neglected the legion, leaving officers and men with mounting arrears of pay, inadequate supplies and reinforcements, and scant medical support, especially at Vitoria when fever and dysentery swept through the ranks. Throughout the summer of 1836 Evans had to cope with falling morale, contractual disputes, and dissension over the lack of pay and medals (he even dismissed several hundred mutineers from the legion's service). The legion repulsed formidable Carlist attacks on its lines on 31 May, and 6 and 9 June, and mounted an abortive assault on Fuenterrab&iacute;a (11 July 1836) before withstanding a massive Carlist offensive on 1 October 1836. In this battle Evans was slightly injured, but took even greater risks by conspicuously riding from one part of the line to another in complete disregard for his personal safety. Thereafter the legion endured several months of grinding inactivity until it received the long-awaited reinforcements of 210 officers and 5135 men. Now able to take the field with some 9000 troops (supported by Royal Marines and Spanish forces), Evans launched a disastrous attack upon the Carlist lines at Hernani (15 March 1837), losing 900 men killed and wounded. Only the arrival of General Espartero's army of 14,000 men enabled Evans to resume his offensive, and, on 14 May 1837, the combined forces stormed the heights overlooking Hernani. They then seized the towns of Oyarzun, Irun, and Fuenterrab&iacute;a (18 May 1837), with the last garrison surrendering after Evans had spared the prisoners of Irun. Although the Spanish authorities belatedly recognized the achievements of the legion, Evans and the majority of legionnaires declined requests to re-engage and left Spain. Evans received the grand crosses of San Fernando and of Charles III.<br>
<br>Evans encountered a mixed reception on his return to London. Despite promotion to the rank of colonel on 10 January 1837, re-election for Westminster in July, and the appointment as KCB in August 1837, Evans found his military achievements derided by Conservatives in the press and parliament. Having failed after an ineffectual speech to assuage criticisms in the house, Evans continued to press Madrid over the legion's arrears of pay and sought to defend his actions in a book entitled <span class="italic">Memoranda of the Contest in Spain</span> (1840). This preoccupation with the legion, coupled with divisions among Westminster Liberals, left his constituency vulnerable to a revival of Conservative fortunes in the general election of 1841. Narrowly defeated at the polls, Evans remained a prominent figure in radical politics by participating in the campaign for the repeal of the corn laws. Re-elected for Westminster at a by-election in 1846 (and at the subsequent general elections of 1847 and 1852), he continued to promote local Westminster grievances and army reform in the Commons, but aroused increasing criticism from ultra-radicals within his constituency by tempering his support for the more extreme Chartist proposals.<br>
<br>Evans's military career revived, however. Promoted to the rank of major-general (9 November 1846), he was given a brigade command at the Chobham camp exercise in the summer of 1853. Having impressed Lord Hardinge, the commander-in-chief, he was appointed colonel of the 21st Royal North British Fusiliers (29 August 1853) and given command of the 2nd division in the Crimea, with a subsequent promotion to lieutenant-general on 20 June 1854. He was always concerned about the health and morale of his men, choosing camp sites with care in Bulgaria to minimize losses from cholera and authorizing recreational sports to relieve boredom and sustain morale. At the battle of the Alma (26 September 1854), he not only led his forces with distinction, taking them across the river to the relief of the light division, but also maintained the offensive by prompting the duke of Cambridge to provide support with the 1st division. Though severely wounded at the Alma and weakened by illness, he commanded his men in their successful repulse of a Russian sortie from Sevastopol (the battle of little Inkerman, 26 October 1854). After a fall from his horse Evans was hospitalized, but returned to his division during the main battle of Inkerman (5 November 1854), inspiring officers and men without undermining the command of Major-General Pennefather. Debilitated by his exertions, Evans retired from the war and returned as a national hero. He received a vote of thanks from the House of Commons and a GCB in July 1855. He was appointed grand officer of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1856, and received both an honorary DCL from Oxford University and the Turkish order of the Mejidiye.<br>
<br>Although Evans deprecated parliamentary criticism of the Crimean army and deplored the cessation of hostilities in January 1856, he remained passionately committed to army reform. This became his main concern during his last ten years in parliament (retaining his Westminster seat without opposition in the elections of 1857 and 1859). He served on several royal commissions and select committees, spoke in army debates, championed the volunteer movement of 1859, and repeatedly pressed for the abolition&#151;in whole or in part&#151;of the purchase system. His dismal oratory, laced all too often with personal invective, failed to sway the house, and he found that the press was much less interested in the issue after the army's suppression of the Indian mutiny. Evans lost further credibility as a reformer and dissipated his energies by promoting the cause of the local European forces of the East India Company. He bitterly opposed the <span class="roman">European Forces (India) Bill</span> (1860) and so found himself isolated from both front benches and ignored by the metropolitan press. Despite promotion to the rank of general on 10 March 1861 he achieved little as an army reformer, and attended parliament less and less frequently on account of recurrent illnesses. He retired from political life at the dissolution of 1865 and died at his home, 6 Great Cumberland Place, London, on 9 January 1870, aged eighty-two.<br>
