<span class="headword">Aspinwall,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1702), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born at Trumfleet, Kirk Sandall, West Riding of Yorkshire, the son of Matthew Aspinwall. After attending school at York, he was admitted to Magdalene College, Cambridge, as a sizar in 1654, graduating BA in 1657. He was admitted vicar of Mattersey, Nottinghamshire, on 24 November 1658 and was ordained at the thirty-third meeting of the Nottinghamshire classis held in St Mary's Church, Nottingham, on 4 May 1660. In January 1661 he was indicted at the quarter sessions at Retford for not reading the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, and was ejected from the living later in the year. On 3 March 1662 he took out a licence to marry Ann Lloid, a widow of Carlton in Lindrick, Nottinghamshire.<br>
<br>After his ejection Aspinwall apparently took a farm at Thurnscoe in the West Riding, and subsequently moved to the Manchester township of Newton, where he was living in 1668 when he subscribed for a copy of Matthew Poole's <span class="italic">Synopsis criticorum</span>. In 1672 he was licensed as a presbyterian minister at Winwick, Lancashire. At some point he moved to Forton in the parish of Cockerham on the Lancashire coast. In 1693 the Common Fund, set up in 1690 to support presbyterian and congregational ministers, granted him &pound;6 per annum to preach in Shireshead chapelry, Cockerham; this was reduced to &pound;4 per annum in 1695.<br>
<br>Thomas Brockbank, the vicar of Cartmel, recorded hearing of Aspinwall's death on 20 April 1702. He was buried at Cockerham on 22 April. His estate was valued at &pound;137 17<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>., of which, after the payment of debts and funeral expenses, there remained &pound;54 0<i>s</i>. 11<i>d</i>.<br>
<br>It is not certain whether Ann Aspinwall died before or after her husband. She may be the Mrs Asponell whose burial is recorded in the Cockerham parish register on 14 January 1698, four years before her husband's death. If so, however, William Aspinwall must have married another woman named Ann, for by his will, proved in June 1702, he left a two-thirds share of his property to his wife, Ann, should she not remarry; the residue he left to his daughter, Elizabeth, when she reached the age of twenty-one. Ann Aspinwall duly signed a bond undertaking to care for Elizabeth and pay to her her share of the estate when she came of age.<br>
<br>The name Aspinwall and its variants are not uncommon in the north-west, and it is frequently not possible to tell whether references to &#145;Mr Aspinwall&#146; in local sources refer to this man or to namesakes, several of whom were also nonconformists. He has been confused with the Lancashireman William Aspinwall who migrated in 1630 to New England where he established himself as a merchant, became involved in the antinomian controversy, and served in local office in Massachusetts; on returning to England, he became a Fifth Monarchist pamphleteer. He has also been confused with <a name="cosubject_76216"></a><span class="headword">William Aspinwall</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1602, <em>d.</em> 1673), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, who was baptized at Ormskirk on 11 November 1602, the son of Peter Aspinwall, and was admitted to Brasenose College, Oxford, in November 1621, graduating BA in 1625. At some date he married; his wife, Elizabeth, survived him. There is no evidence of any children. By 1648 he was curate of Maghull in the parish of Hassall, Lancashire. There he signed the harmonious consent of the presbyterian ministers in Lancashire. The Commonwealth church survey of Lancashire found him &#145;a painful and godly minister&#146;  (Fishwick, 87). On 23 December 1660 a William Aspinwall&#151;in all probability this man&#151;was one of the signatories to the address and petition to the king by sixty ministers of the gospel in Lancashire. Little is known of him after his ejection, but he probably stayed in the Maghull area, as he was described in the parish register as of Aughton, 3 miles from Maghull, when he was buried at Ormskirk on 3 December 1673. The administration of his estate has not survived, in common with many diocese of Chester probate documents of the 1670s.<br>
