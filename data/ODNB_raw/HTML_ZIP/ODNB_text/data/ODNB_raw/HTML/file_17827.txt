<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Maitland,  John</span>, duke of Lauderdale  (1616&#150;1682), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at the family seat of Lethington Hall, Haddingtonshire, on 24 May 1616, the eldest surviving son of John Maitland, second Lord Maitland of Thirlestane (<i>d</i>. 1645), created earl of Lauderdale in 1624, and his wife, Lady Isabel (1594&#150;1638), second daughter of the prominent Jacobean statesman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25113/', "Alexander Seton, first earl of Dunfermline")</script>. His mother bore fifteen children, of whom four survived her: Sophia, John, Robert, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17818/', "Charles Maitland, later third earl of Lauderdale (c.1620&#150;1691)")</script>. Robert died in 1658, and it is the other two sons who feature in public life.<h2>
<a name="Precociouspolitician16161644"></a>Precocious politician, 1616&#150;1644</h2>The future duke was endowed with the barony of Haddington on 30 March 1622, matriculated at the University of St Andrews in 1631, and married Lady Anne Home (<i>d</i>. 1671) in August or September 1632. She was the second daughter of a neighbouring magnate, Alexander Home, first earl of Home, and his second wife, Mary, daughter of Edward Sutton, ninth Baron Dudley. The union produced a daughter, Mary. This is all that is known of his early life, until the young Viscount Maitland (as he was styled) suddenly appears in national view in September 1641, accompanying the commissioners appointed by the Scottish covenanters to negotiate peace with the government of Charles I, first at Ripon and then at London, after their resounding military defeat of the king. From this it must be surmised that he had been a keen supporter of the covenant, but it seems unclear whether he went with the delegation in an official or a private capacity.<br>
<br>Having returned to Scotland with the delegation in 1641, Maitland continued to push himself forward. He was refused leave to attend the parliament of that year in his capacity as a peer's heir, but did sit in the general assembly of the kirk in July, and was chosen to carry its request for uniformity of ecclesiastical government between England and Scotland to the king and the English parliament. This suggests that he had now established a reputation for intelligence and eloquence, and on 8 August 1643 he was made one of the commissioners to negotiate the solemn league and covenant, and on 17 August ordered to carry it to Westminster. He was also named to sit in the Westminster assembly of divines as a lay elder, and so by November 1643 had taken up residence in the English capital. In February 1644 he was made one of the Scottish members of the committee for both kingdoms which met there, and on 20 November he was appointed one of the Scottish contingent of the delegation instructed to carry an offer of peace terms to the king at Oxford. By the time of his father's death on 18 January 1645, therefore, the young noble had established himself as one of the main figures in the covenanter alliance with the English parliamentarians, and his fellow commissioners regularly praised him for the energy, dedication, and persuasive skill which he displayed in their work.<h2>
<a name="Covenanterdiplomat16451648"></a>Covenanter diplomat, 1645&#150;1648</h2>The first duty of the new earl was to represent Scotland in the fruitless peace talks between the allies and the English royalists at Uxbridge, in February 1645. An invaluable insight into his attitudes at this time is provided by a remark which he made to the French ambassador Sabran, before setting out for Uxbridge. According to the Frenchman, Lauderdale admitted that the religious argument against episcopacy was actually unproven, and stated that the Scottish demand for its abolition in England was a sound practical move, to bring the two nations into harmony with each other. In his pragmatic and opportunist approach to the matter, devoid of any ideological commitment, he already differed from many of his fellow covenanters, and was establishing a pattern which was to remain consistent throughout his career. None the less, he worked as hard as any of his colleagues to persuade the royalists to concede the removal of bishops from the English church, and only after the talks collapsed did he return to Scotland, in May, to settle his inheritance.<br>
<br>Lauderdale was deeply missed by his fellow commissioners in London, and was back there by February 1646, informing the city's common council of the determination of the Scots to uphold the alliance with parliament and its conditions. In the latter half of the year he was hard at work with his fellows negotiating the terms for the withdrawal of the Scottish forces from England after the defeat of the royalists, and arguing against a proposed resolution of parliament to dispose of the king's person without reference to the views of the Scots. He left England again at the conclusion of the treaty of Newcastle in December, only to return in April 1647 with a deputation briefed to urge parliament to come to terms with Charles on the basis of the terms agreed with the Scots in 1646.<br>
<br>The occasion of Lauderdale's return was the growing crisis in England, as the New Model Army turned upon the dominant presbyterian party in parliament. As it deepened in May, Lauderdale and his fellow commissioners held secret talks with the presbyterians, who were their natural allies, concerning the return of a Scottish army to England to confront the New Model. After the latter seized the king, the earl was sent by the conspirators to obtain Charles's formal consent to this measure, visiting him at Newmarket on 19 June and at Latimer's Cross on 22 July. A third meeting, at Woburn, was prevented by English soldiers suspicious of the existence of such a plan, who burst into the earl's lodgings and expelled him from the town. He had done his utmost both to obtain Charles's consent to the invasion and to urge the Scottish kirk to support it; after his ejection from Woburn he made a formal protest to parliament and then behaved circumspectly for a time, seeing the king only at the formal presentation of parliament's propositions to him on 7 September.<br>
<br>Access to the king's person was restored on 22 October, when Lauderdale visited him at Hampton Court with the earls of Lanark and Loudoun. They renewed the offer of Scottish aid if he would only make concessions regarding the English church. Further discussions with him followed, and the three Scottish nobles met the greatest Irish royalist, the marquess of Ormond, in a wood near Henley and agreed to raise armies in their respective nations to attack the New Model. All that was now lacking was the consent of Charles himself, which was obtained on 26 December, after the king's flight to the Isle of Wight, in the famous document called the engagement, by which Lauderdale and his fellows bound the Scots to assist Charles in return for a trial period of presbyterianism in England. The year 1648 was devoted to the consequences of this agreement. On 17 January, Lauderdale and the other commissioners protested against parliament's vote of no addresses, and so abrogated the alliance. On 24 January he departed for Scotland to advocate the engagement and devoted the next six months to writing and speaking of the danger posed to the Scots by the dominant Independent party in England and the acceptable nature of the deal with the king. On this last point he found himself unable to satisfy the majority of the kirk, which left him out of the commissioners appointed to discuss uniformity of worship with the English. It also estranged him from the more rigid covenanters and pushed him into co-operation with former opponents of the covenants such as the Hamilton faction, a natural consequence of that flexibility of principle which he had revealed to Sabran.<br>
<br>Lauderdale's response to this situation was to seek further concessions from the king concerning the English church while making closer links with English royalists. He corresponded regularly with the latter between April and June, and on 1 May was a signatory of a formal invitation to the prince of Wales to command in Scotland. The prince's reply was that he would come only if no further terms were imposed on him than those in the engagement, whereupon Lauderdale volunteered to visit him in person and coax him into making the concessions that his father would not. The earl took ship at Elie, Fife, in July, and eventually located the younger Charles on board a royalist fleet in the Downs on 10 August. The meeting established a rapport between the two which was to endure through thirty years, and won Lauderdale his three main objectives. The prince agreed to join the Scottish army in England as its titular leader, to leave behind him royalists of whom the covenanters especially disapproved, and to adopt the Scottish form of worship while on campaign. This triumph marked the climax, and apogee, of the earl's career as an envoy for the cause of the covenants.<h2>
<a name="Exileandprison16481660"></a>Exile and prison, 1648&#150;1660</h2>Within a fortnight of the agreement, Lauderdale's whole political position began to collapse like a house of cards. First, news arrived that the Scottish invasion of England had been totally defeated, whereupon the prince withdrew his undertaking to join the Scots. Then the supporters of the engagement were overthrown in Scotland itself, by more extreme covenanters who had always opposed it and who now came to terms with the English parliament and army. Lauderdale found himself stranded in the Netherlands with the prince and his court, out of favour and employment with the new regime. Gilbert Burnet, who later recorded a number of doubtful tales about the earl's activities in the 1640s, asserted that Lauderdale crept back into Scotland at the end of January 1649, but departed again when he found himself in danger of arrest  (G. Burnet, <span class="italic">Memories of &hellip; James and William, Dukes of Hamilton</span>, 1677, 377). This story may be correct.<br>
<br>Lauderdale now established himself at The Hague, and set to work to restore his fortunes by persuading the younger Charles, whom regicide had now made king in exile, to come to terms with the hard-line covenanter government in Scotland. In March 1649 his efforts proved unavailing, but a year later he found both sides more willing to agree, and played a prominent part among those advisers who brought Charles II to sign the treaty of Breda with the covenanters in April 1650. This service secured his return to Scotland with the royal party in June, and the right to live there without molestation, but the Edinburgh regime ensured he was immediately separated from the king's presence and forbidden to engage in public life. Only the crushing defeat of the covenanters by Cromwell at Dunbar rescued him from this enforced retirement, as the government needed a broader basis of support to rebuild its war effort. On 26 December he was allowed to make a public repentance for his part in the engagement at Largo kirk, Fife, and by February 1651 he had rejoined Charles. He remained with and assisted the king in the campaign of that year, and took the risk of accompanying him in its last desperate act of the invasion of England which led to the destruction of the royal army at Worcester on 3 September. He was among those taken prisoner after the battle, in Cheshire after an attempt to flee homeward.<br>
<br>Lauderdale was never brought to trial, but nor was he released. Instead his estates were confiscated, with the payment of an annuity of &pound;600 to his wife, while he was kept in the Tower. He was excepted from the indemnity ordinance issued by the newly established protectorate on 5 May 1654, and the only difference made to his circumstances by Cromwell's rule was that he was moved to other prisons, in the castles of Windsor and Portland. His role in the attempts to destroy the New Model Army in 1647&#150;8 was not deemed forgivable. He seems to have devoted his enforced idleness to study, for which he had a natural aptitude. In later life he was noted as reading Latin, Greek, and Hebrew with ease, having a special enthusiasm for theology and history, and possessing an extraordinary memory. His opinion that no form of church government was prescribed in scripture was clearly based on personal research.<br>
<br>Lauderdale's freedom was automatically restored after the English republicans finally lost power in February 1660. By 23 March he was at liberty in London and immediately concerting plans with the presbyterians once more. He also wrote to the former engagers in Scotland and to Charles in the Netherlands, receiving a reply from the latter on 12 April subscribed &#145;your most affectionate friend&#146;  (Airy, 1.13). Having been sent money by his old acquaintance John Leslie, earl of Rothes, he was able to join the king in person at The Hague, renew their old intimacy, and apply himself to royal favourites such as Hyde &#145;with a marvellous importunity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of &hellip; Clarendon</span>, 428). He therefore returned to England in the royal train as a gentleman of the bedchamber, poised to take full advantage of the restoration of monarchy.<h2>
<a name="Vulnerablecourtier16601663"></a>Vulnerable courtier, 1660&#150;1663</h2>Lauderdale's windfall of rewards, slowly accumulated in the succeeding years, was immense. In the summer of 1660 he obtained the key office of secretary of state for Scotland, which carried with it the powerful position of constant attendance upon the king's person. He regained his family properties, with a grant of the lordships of Musselburgh, Cranschawis, and Thirlestane, with other land, on 15 May 1661, to which a valuable plot in Leith was added in May 1662 and the Forest of Lauder on 13 October 1664, acquisitions which cemented his status as one of the magnates of south-eastern Scotland. There was, however, a price to be paid for success. His appointment to the post of secretary was opposed by the set of Scots who had been Charles's companions in exile and fought for him in the 1650s, led by John, earl of Middleton, and allied with English royalists such as Hyde. It was the king's own rapport with Lauderdale which had brought him the job. The earl was left caught between Middleton and his friends, who dominated the new government of Scotland, and English ministers such as Hyde (now earl of Clarendon), who wanted their nation to retain a controlling interest in Scottish affairs. The very strength of his position, as the Scotsman with readiest access to the monarch, drew upon him the hostility of both groups.<br>
<br>Lauderdale emerged as the chief champion of the moderate covenanter position once represented by the engagers. In August 1660 he got Charles to sign a letter promising to maintain the &#145;settled&#146; kirk of Scotland, and in December he ensured that Middleton was instructed to obtain the restoration of former royal powers in the land, but not the restoration of episcopacy. He also persuaded the king, against Clarendon's advice, to withdraw the English garrisons. In early 1661 Middleton outflanked him by obtaining the repeal of the laws against episcopacy in a Scottish parliament. At a meeting of Scottish and English privy councillors in late July, Charles became persuaded that Middleton understood current feeling among Scots better than Lauderdale, and ordered the restoration of bishops on 14 August. Lauderdale struggled to protect himself by attending Anglican communion at the Chapel Royal to please the king while telling friends in Scotland to spread word there of his devotion to the covenanter cause.<br>
<br>Middleton's hatred for his rival now intensified. He was said to have declared that Lauderdale would pimp for any prince in Europe, and in September 1662 he used the Scottish parliament in an attempt to destroy him. On 5 September he obtained an act which enjoined all office-holders to denounce the covenants. This got rid of Lauderdale's last friend in the government, the earl of Crawford-Lindsay, but the secretary himself made the declaration with the alleged sneer that he would take a cartload of others if needed. On 9 September the parliament passed an act of indemnity, with a clause disabling twelve men from office. Middleton's clique ensured both that the twelve would be named by secret ballot and that Lauderdale would be included. The device backfired, for the secretary's agent in Edinburgh sent his master the news at top speed, enabling Lauderdale to be the first to break it to the king, representing it as a means of controlling Charles's power to appoint or dismiss servants. This played directly on the monarch's personal fear of being misled or coerced, and enabled Lauderdale to draw his attention to other recent acts of Middleton which he held to usurp royal authority. The result was that Charles rejected the result of the ballot.<br>
<br>In February 1663 the two earls confronted each other at Whitehall, and Lauderdale finally shattered his rival's reputation by convincing the king that Middleton had countermanded a royal order to suspend the collection of the fines due under the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span>. He implicated Clarendon in the action, and so at one blow destroyed one rival and damaged another. In May, Charles formally announced that Middleton would be replaced as his commissioner to the Scottish parliament by the young earl of Rothes, whose timely loan in 1660 had enabled Lauderdale to refound his career. Rothes was instructed to investigate Middleton's activities in power, and Lauderdale was allowed to visit Scotland to assist him. During the course of the summer the two men prepared a devastating report to prove that Middleton had played off monarch and parliament to his own advantage, which prevented any chance of his return to office. They then flattered and delighted Charles by persuading the parliament to increase royal power over legislation, and to provide for an armed force to be used wherever the king desired in Britain.<br>
<br>Finding episcopacy now firmly established, Lauderdale accommodated himself openly to the new order by praising it in parliament while presenting a bill to fine people who worshipped outside the kirk and punish ministers who preached outside it. With this, he finally severed himself from the defeated cause of the covenants and established himself as one of the leaders of Restoration Scotland. For three years he had been penned in a political corner, under attack. Using every strategic advantage of that position, he had now broken out of it, and seized the initiative in his own affairs and that of his country.<h2>
<a name="Firsttriumvirate16641667"></a>First triumvirate, 1664&#150;1667</h2>By 1664 Scotland was dominated by three men. The management of the kirk was left to its primate, James Sharp, who had as yet little influence on politics, dominated by the partnership between Rothes and Lauderdale, the former residing mostly in Scotland and the latter once more at court. Lauderdale tended to keep a low profile in Scottish affairs while quietly building up influence in the land. He attracted a clientage of lairds in his own south-eastern region, and gradually gained them posts, especially in the strategically important legal offices. He also courted popularity, by obtaining royal action against abuses in the collection of tax arrears. At the same time he sought to represent the new regime to the king as one which functioned solely as an agent of Charles's own will: in September 1663 he had informed his monarch that after Middleton's fall &#145;you govern this poor kingdom yourself&#146;  (Airy, 1.184).<br>
<br>The Second Anglo-Dutch War, which broke out in 1665, created a new set of problems, highlighting the existence of religious and political dissent in Scotland, precipitating new taxes and the creation of a new army, and increasing the influence both of Sharp and his bishops and of military men in political life. The process brought Sharp and Rothes closer together, and further from Lauderdale, who began to feel himself tied to an increasingly unpopular administration while losing influence in it. The king was persuaded into supporting a policy of religious repression by visits from Alexander Burnet, archbishop of Glasgow, which threatened the secretary's own influence over Charles. The Pentland rising of November 1666 provoked a crisis, for Lauderdale feared that it would be used to vindicate that policy and that Rothes's repression of the rebellion would raise his stock still higher with the king. Instead he brilliantly turned the tables by using his proximity to Charles to convince him that Rothes had provoked the rising with the same policy, and that Sharp had once collaborated with Cromwell. In January 1667 the archbishop was confined to his see and between April and September, Rothes was gently stripped of his offices. Lauderdale had thus become the arbiter of Scottish affairs, and it was now for him to steer them into new courses.<h2>
<a name="Secondtriumvirate16671672"></a>Second triumvirate, 1667&#150;1672</h2>The earl had his new team of managers ready. Rothes was replaced as the leading man resident in Scotland by a neighbour of Lauderdale's in Haddingtonshire, John Hay, earl of Tweeddale. By 1666 the friendship between them was strong enough for Lauderdale to marry his only child, Mary, to Tweeddale's heir. Both men had been enemies of Middleton, who had reluctantly accepted episcopacy. They were linked by Sir Robert Moray, who carried messages between them, reinforced Tweeddale in Scotland at moments of critical negotiation and intrigue there, and replaced Lauderdale at the side of Charles when the secretary needed to go to his native land in person. These two were Lauderdale's chief allies in obtaining the fall of Rothes, and in devising and promulgating a new religious policy between 1667 and 1669, intended to neutralize religious dissent by dividing it.<br>
<br>At first this consisted of conciliation, as the standing army was disbanded, an indemnity issued to rebels, and moderate presbyterian ministers were appointed to vacant livings in the kirk. When Archbishop Burnet organized a protest against the latter initiative, Moray convinced Charles that this represented disobedience, and Burnet was forced to resign. At that moment (in 1669) Lauderdale was in Scotland, at last equipped with the supreme office of royal commissioner to parliament and steering through an act which recognized the king's supreme power over the kirk; in this manner the whole policy could be sold to Charles as a demonstration of his control of the realm. After its passage, Lauderdale told him that &#145;Never was king so absolute as you in poor old Scotland&#146;  (Airy, 2.164). The second part of that policy was to crush obdurate dissenters, and in 1669&#150;70 parliament and privy council passed a package of measures to harry and punish religious meetings outside the kirk, including the notorious act making death the penalty for field conventicles.<br>
<br>Lauderdale has also customarily been treated by English historians as one of the five royal advisers who made up the body nicknamed the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93697', "Cabal")</script> and who dominated politics between 1668 and 1673. It is certainly true that he sat in the committee for foreign affairs, the inner policy-making ring of England's privy council. Even there, however, he remained primarily an adviser on Scottish dimensions to initiatives, and his influence was further limited by the fact that he was most closely associated with the least important members of the group, Ashley and Buckingham, who had shared with him an old hostility to Clarendon. As such he was screened off with them from the crucial secret diplomacy of the period, although he did play a part in persuading the king to issue the declaration of indulgence of March 1672, as a parallel to his efforts to conciliate and divide dissent in Scotland. These continued in September with the placement of eighty more presbyterian ministers in vacant livings.<br>
<br>Although functioning as a semi-detached member of the Cabal, Lauderdale still received his full share of the round of honours which Charles bestowed upon most of the group to reward and encourage them at the outbreak of his war with the Dutch in the summer of 1672. On 26 May his favourite Scotsman became marquess of March and duke of Lauderdale, and on 3 June the new duke was also made a knight of the Garter. He had reached the highest point of his career.<h2>
<a name="MasterofScotland16721679"></a>Master of Scotland, 1672&#150;1679</h2>The year 1672 represented a watershed as well as an apogee for Lauderdale. On 17 February he married his second wife at Petersham parish church, Surrey. She was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19601/', "Elizabeth Murray (bap. 1626, d. 1698)")</script>, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19653/', "William Murray, earl of Dysart")</script>, whose title she had been allowed to retain as countess in her own right. Her first husband had been Sir Lionel Tollemache, who had died in 1669, and from that moment she had become intimate with Lauderdale. The obvious closeness of the couple had ruined the earl's relations with his first wife, Anne, which had hitherto appeared happy. She abandoned him to live in Paris, where she died on 6 November 1671, clearing the way for the new marriage. It was easy for people to understand Lauderdale's infatuation with Elizabeth, for she was beautiful, charming, and learned. She was also about forty-six years of age at the time of their union, which meant that by marrying her he was effectively giving up his chances of having more children. Abandoning the home at Highgate, just north of London, where he had lived in the 1660s, he moved across the capital to the splendid mansion of Ham House in Surrey.<br>
<br>In public as well as in domestic life Lauderdale was drawing a line underneath old habits, and the two were probably connected. During 1671 he turned upon his partners Tweeddale and Moray, and treated them so badly that they withdrew from the government's affairs. They themselves were bewildered by his change, and historians can supply no certain reason for it, but it is difficult to ignore the contemporary whispers that Elizabeth had disliked them and poisoned her lover's mind against them. She was certainly a proud and greedy woman, who loved to intervene in politics, and may have encouraged Lauderdale's unmistakable tendency to growing arrogance and ruthlessness at this time. His new favourite agents were Alexander Bruce, earl of Kincardine, and his own brother Charles, both lesser men than their predecessors and also much more clearly his servants rather than partners. The change reflected one in the Scottish privy council. Throughout the 1660s it had been a fairly heterogenous body representing different factions and friendships. Between 1669 and 1674 several deaths and enforced retirements enabled Lauderdale to turn it into something like a closed body of his own supporters. In his contributions to the debates of the English committee for foreign affairs, also, he now revealed a brutality and contempt for moral convention which had hitherto not been apparent in his nature.<br>
<br>This trend towards ministerial despotism would probably in itself have produced a new coherence and determination of opposition, but the strains of the Third Anglo-Dutch War caused the latter to develop very swiftly. In 1673&#150;4 Lauderdale faced opposition in parliament, and in 1674&#150;5 in the Faculty of Advocates and the convention of royal burghs. The parliamentary attacks were led by Tweeddale and another noble with whom Lauderdale had now quarrelled, the duke of Hamilton. At the same time he lost his allies in England, Ashley (now earl of Shaftesbury) and Buckingham, by remaining loyal to the government even after they were dismissed during the winter of 1673&#150;4. Shaftesbury in particular could not forgive him for supporting the royal duke of York after the latter's public conversion to Catholicism, and thereafter abetted the growing English suspicions of Lauderdale as an instrument of royal ambitions for more powerful and arbitrary monarchy.<br>
<br>Lauderdale's response to all these pressures was to give up trying to work with the Scottish parliament at the opening of 1674 and to rely on his control of the flow of information to the king. He convinced both Charles and the grateful York that the attacks were motivated solely by jealousy and malice. The king ostentatiously favoured him on his return from Scotland in 1674, raising him to the English peerage on 25 June as Baron Petersham and earl of Guilford, and appointing him to the English privy council. These measures also strengthened his legal position against any attacks which his new enemies might foment against him in the English House of Commons. He made an immediate alliance with the new leading minister in England, the earl of Danby, and henceforth the two worked together. In April 1675 the English Commons indeed addressed the king for Lauderdale's removal, but Charles stood firm, driving around Hyde Park with Lauderdale in his coach and having the duke carry the sword before him at the prorogation of the parliament.<br>
<br>There was a price to be paid for this support. In tying himself to Danby, Lauderdale was also tying himself to the English bishops who were allied with Danby and urging a drive against nonconformists in both kingdoms. It may be that the persistence of large-scale dissent in the wake of the policy of restoration of selected ministers to the kirk would have turned Lauderdale against conciliation in any case, but political circumstance now made this certain. In late 1674 he obtained a string of royal orders to the Scottish privy council to wipe out conventicles, and cultivated the support of the bishops, restoring Sharp to the king's favour and Burnet to his see. A new field army was raised, led by Lauderdale's clients, and quartered in areas especially noted for dissent. At the same time he changed his chief secular allies and agents, dropping Kincardine when the latter baulked all the new military measures, and with him Charles Maitland. In their place he elevated the earls of Atholl and Argyll.<br>
<br>To Lauderdale's critics, this policy seemed to be part of a general inclination on the duke's part to crush opposition of any sort, and it caught him in a vicious circle of ever greater repression as the presbyterians of the south-west intensified their resistance. He tried to break out of it in 1677 by putting further plans for conciliation before the moderate presbyterians and English bishops alike. The latter, however, allied with both Danby and the Scottish bishops to force the abandonment of the plans and the adoption of yet more savage measures of persecution. Lauderdale had become the virtual dictator of Scotland, on behalf of an absent king. At the same time he had lost the initiative in the making of policy, and been forced into ever more desperate and counter-productive courses.<br>
<br>The crisis which was to end Lauderdale's supremacy was precipitated by another of those measures, a decision to use highland levies to police and terrorize the most disaffected areas in early 1678. Local nobles who did not co-operate were to be declared traitors, a tactic which had the unexpected effect of making two of them desperate enough to bolt to England and appeal to the king. They were joined by old enemies of the duke, and by Atholl who had turned against him in disgust at these events. Lauderdale had to send a new set of agents to represent himself to Charles. The complainants found allies at court and in the House of Commons, where all Danby's efforts were needed to have a new address for the duke's removal defeated by a single vote on 9 May. In June, Charles compromised, declaring his approval of the Scottish government's measures, but ordering Lauderdale to treat the people and nobility of the south-west better. It was the first qualification of royal support for the duke, and the latter regarded it as the beginning of the end of his career.<br>
<br>Lauderdale's position eroded further with the fall of Danby in December, and the new House of Commons of 1679 voted an address for his removal from office on 8 May. Once more this attack was co-ordinated with further complaints made at court by his Scottish enemies, led by Hamilton. Once again, too, the king ostensibly stood firm; the address evaporated with the sudden prorogation of the English parliament on 27 May, and in July Charles signed a succession of documents which upheld Lauderdale against his critics. At the same time it was plain that while the duke remained in power, his period of dominance was over. He had completely lost control of access to the king, so that his enemies could attend court, and the royal person, as they pleased. The Scottish army was put under one of his opponents. The Bothwell Bridge rising of June precipitated a formal condemnation by the king of the policies of repression, and a legalization of conventicles in private houses, made without consulting the Scottish government. It is possible that secret communications between the king and Lauderdale lay behind both initiatives, but by August 1679 it was no longer clear to commentators who, if anybody, was actually steering Scottish affairs. What all agreed was that the duke's replacement was only a matter of time.<h2>
<a name="Blightedgrandee16801682"></a>Blighted grandee, 1680&#150;1682</h2>It was in September 1679 that Lauderdale himself proposed a way out of his predicament: that his old ally the duke of York be sent to govern Scotland, thereby giving the latter a bolt-hole from an England in the throes of the exclusion crisis while providing a powerful protector for himself. The king adopted this idea in October. Lauderdale was thus freed to return to Whitehall in the winter and bolster his royal master against the demands of the English whigs. Behind his back, however, York created a mixed Scottish government of his friends and enemies, and so effectively brought an end to his regime. It may be that this betrayal landed a final blow upon a constitution long undermined by hard work and political strain, for in March 1680 Lauderdale suffered a stroke which left him a semi-paralysed invalid with a failing memory, vainly seeking cures from the spa waters of Bath and Tunbridge Wells. He was now clearly but one royal adviser on Scottish affairs among many, and in September he finally resigned his post as secretary of state.<br>
<br>Henceforth Lauderdale was a valetudinarian, living mostly at the health resort of Tunbridge Wells. He made what may have been the mistake of attending the English House of Lords in November 1680 for the trial of the Catholic Viscount Stafford. The king, for tactical reasons, was prepared to sacrifice Stafford by allowing him to be condemned and executed, while York was determined to save him. Caught between the two, and perhaps swayed by his old distaste for Catholics, Lauderdale chose to vote for guilt and so allegedly lost York's good opinion. It was also whispered that the royal duke had been scandalized by his discovery of how much money Lauderdale's duchess had been making out of corrupt exploitation of her husband's administration. Whatever the truth, the disabled old man himself was allowed to die in peace, which he did suddenly at Tunbridge Wells on either 20 or 24 August 1682, after taking a purge. He was buried with great ceremony and a huge attendance in the family vault at Haddington kirk on 5 April 1683, although York was ostentatiously absent. His Scottish estates and earldom passed to his brother Charles, but as the latter had never won the king's regard, he was not allowed to inherit the dukedom or English titles. Lauderdale's widow survived until 5 June 1698.<h2>
<a name="Reputationandlegacy"></a>Reputation and legacy</h2>Lauderdale suffered two of the worst misfortunes which can attend the posthumous reputation of a statesman: that his enemies left popular and much-admired memoirs while his friends did not, and that the policies with which he was associated were subsequently totally defeated and discredited. He had personally offended the most influential whig and the most influential tory historian of his age, Gilbert Burnet and Clarendon respectively, and their portraits of him are the more influential for being remarkably similar&#151;of a ruthless, selfish, and unprincipled politician whose sole aim was his own promotion and survival. This was enhanced by the fact that he moved from being one of the foremost representatives of the covenanters to one of their foremost persecutors. As their cause triumphed in 1690, and the kirk of Scotland was finally remade in their image, with Robert Wodrow providing its heroic history and martyrology, it was inevitable that Lauderdale should be implanted in national folk memory as a debauched tyrant, serving an unworthy and absentee monarch. That image was reinforced, like so much else in that folk memory, by Sir Walter Scott.<br>
<br>There is a certain amount of truth in this hostile tradition. The contrast between Lauderdale's brilliant and erudite mind and his physical grossness, upon which Burnet made play, is amply borne out by the Lely portrait in the National Portrait Gallery, London. It shows a man with bushy, ruddy hair (which gave him his nickname of John Red), fat jowls, pursed lips, and cold, heavy-lidded eyes. His growing lack of scruple and aptitude for brutality have been remarked upon here and his supreme talent for political manoeuvre and manipulation should be equally obvious. It has hardly helped his reputation that the only one of his contemporary admirers to have left memoirs, Sir George Mackenzie, played up to the full Lauderdale's ability both to outwit his opponents and to vault over problems which vexed men of more tender conscience. The greatest cameo portraitist of the period, Pepys, has enhanced the impression of coarseness in the man, in his report that Lauderdale declared that &#145;he had rather hear a cat mew than the best music in the world&#146;  (Pepys, 7.225).<br>
<br>On the other hand, Burnet himself paid tribute to the statesman's intellectual interests and prowess, and twentieth-century historiography has been kinder. Lauderdale's biographer W. C. Mackenzie, writing in 1923, pointed out the undoubted truth that he abandoned the cause of the covenants reluctantly, and only after it was apparently wholly lost. The persecution of those who adhered to it was well under way by the time that he acceded to power, and his repeated attempts to alter it failed largely because he was caught between the obduracy of the presbyterians and that of the bishops, ultimately abetted by the king himself. This picture, of a naturally tolerant and flexible politician gradually pushed into more and more savage measures, was endorsed by Julia Buckroyd in her study of Restoration Scotland published in 1980. It must be noted that Lauderdale's immediate successors were no more able to escape the impasse, until the revolution of 1688 made a different policy possible. Furthermore, the pattern which the duke established, of the government of Scotland by a viceroy ruling on behalf of a monarch resident in England, was to be repeated at various times during the following century as one solution to the problem of absentee royalty. The particular odium which Lauderdale incurred in this regard was due partly to the fact that he was the first fully to represent this pattern, partly to the historiographical factors noted earlier, and partly to the sheer size and flamboyance of his personality.<br>
<br>When all this is said, the suspicion still lingers that the odium was in part earned. It is perfectly possible, and proper, for a more secular age than Lauderdale's own to contrast approvingly his doctrinal flexibility and pragmatism&#151;itself based on sound scholarship&#151;with the more rigid presbyterianism and intolerant episcopalianism of many of his contemporaries. Beside figures like Middleton, Sharp, Archbishop Burnet, and many of the nobles who served as his allies or tools, the duke unmistakably appears the greater man, more cunning, adroit, imaginative, open-minded, adaptable, and audacious. None of this, however, alters the simple fact that his sole abiding principle was to take power for himself and to retain it, and beside that all other considerations of honour, loyalty, and belief occupied an ever diminishing supportive role. Even in the rogues' gallery of Restoration politicians, he appears especially devious, ruthless, and brutal. His personal fidelity to Charles II was itself coupled with a willingness to manipulate and misinform the king to his own advantage, while his Scottish patriotism must be questioned by his later clear preference for English residences. When every extenuation is made, his career remains a classic illustration of the corrupting effects of power.<br>
