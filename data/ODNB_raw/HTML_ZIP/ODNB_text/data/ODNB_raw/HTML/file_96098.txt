<span class="headword">Simmons,  John Simon Gabriel</span>  (1915&#150;2005), <span class="occ">librarian and Slavonic scholar</span>, was born on 8 July 1915 at 2 Duchess Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, the second of three children and elder son of Bernard Rintel Simmons (1868&#150;1956), manufacturing jeweller, and his wife, Johanna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Selig (1886&#150;1940), the latter originally from Frankfurt am Main. He was educated in Birmingham, at West House School and at King Edward's School. At the age of seventeen he became a student&#150;librarian at Birmingham University Library before beginning, in 1934, his BA in Russian and Spanish, awarded in 1937. Almost one-to-one tuition from the professor of Russian, Sergey Konovalov, made him fluent in the language, and his unofficial role as Konovalov's research assistant honed his research skills. After graduation, while working as an assistant librarian, he began a doctoral dissertation on the history of printing in Russia, cut short by the outbreak of the Second World War.<br>
<br>During the war Simmons served in the Royal Warwickshire regiment as an infantry regimental officer and as a staff officer in England and, from 1944, in France, Belgium, and Germany on the staff of Field Marshal Montgomery's twenty-first army group. In 1945 he was responsible for organizing the retrieval, cataloguing, and evacuation of the regimental war diaries of the German high command. He was mentioned in dispatches for &#145;gallant and distinguished services in North West Europe&#146;, and made a military OBE in October 1945. On 14 November 1944 he had married Fanny Elizabeth Lily Craven, otherwise Krebsman (<i>d</i>. 1999), a private secretary and personal assistant seven years his senior, and daughter of Joseph Krebsman, master hairdresser.<br>
<br>After demobilization Simmons returned to Birmingham University Library until 1949, when he moved to Oxford to take up the post of librarian&#150;lecturer in charge of Slavonic books, created specially for him by Konovalov (by then professor of Russian at Oxford). His duties&#151;building up the retrospective Slavonic (principally Russian) collections of the Taylorian and Bodleian libraries and giving thirty-six lectures a year&#151;and his status as a member of the faculty of modern languages answerable principally to Konovalov, who gave him a relatively free rein, suited ideally his erudite, but deeply practical, inventive, and sometimes unorthodox approach. In 1953, when relations with the USSR were constrained by rigid bureaucracy and protocol, he made a private visit to Moscow, and, turning up unannounced at the Lenin State Library, armed with lists of Oxford University Press publications and Oxford desiderata, instigated a pioneering book exchange. Exchanges with other libraries in Moscow and Leningrad ensued, fed by his hundreds of lists of desiderata, drawn mainly from footnotes in scholarly publications. He considered, with justification, that the resulting comprehensive research collections, combined with the remarkable academic teachers recruited by Konovalov, Maurice Bowra, and Isaiah Berlin, led to Oxford's pre-eminence as a centre for Slavonic studies. His acquisitions also fed into seminars designed to enlighten &#145;bibliographically innocent&#146; graduate students, on the basis of which he established in 1966 the Bodleian Library's unique Slavonic reading room, and published <span class="italic">Russian Bibliography, Libraries and Archives</span> (1973).<br>
<br>Although his first decade at Oxford was devoted principally to library activities, Simmons assisted with the editing of <span class="italic">Oxford Slavonic Papers</span> (becoming general editor in 1968), played an active role in Oxford bibliophile circles, and continued his own research. He compiled for <span class="italic">Oxford Slavonic Papers</span> a bibliography of British theses in Slavonic and east European studies, updated quinquennially. Over the years he published some 500 articles, reviews, translations, and collaborative works (listed in his <span class="italic">Autobibliography</span> of 1975, with supplements in 1985 and 1995). They reflected the wide scope of his interests&#151;bibliography, Russian printing history, the dissemination of information about the book in Eastern Europe, paper and watermark history, heraldry and genealogy, and Anglo-Russian relations&#151;and exemplified his &#145;conviction that the mere intermediary, informant, and bibliographical recorder has an important part to play in the process whereby learning advances&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobibliography</span>, 1975, viii). His 1974 Sandars lectures in Cambridge, &#145;Russian printing to 1917: a view from the West&#146;, drew on his uncompleted doctoral dissertation. A lifelong mission was the registration and description of all extant copies of early printed Cyrillic books. His groundwork, exhortations, and encouragement finally bore fruit in the publication of the <span class="italic">Union Catalogue of Cyrillic Books Printed before 1701 in British and Irish Collections</span> (2000) and international union catalogues by his Russian colleagues.<br>
<br>For many years Simmons acted as an information conduit through the iron curtain, exchanging letters, offprints, and books with scholars in the Soviet Union, many of whom became friends. He drew attention to their scholarship on the pages of professional journals, and celebrated their achievements in his self-published &#145;memorials&#146; (obituaries with lists of publications). In 1985 he formalized this international brotherhood, founding the characteristically serio-comic 4Cs Club, presenting to scholars whom he deemed to share his attitude club ties bearing the interlocking 4Cs emblem, representing his four &#145;categoricals&#146;&#151;Conserve, Consider, Contribute, Co-operate. A world authority on the study of paper, he was general secretary of the Paper Publications Society from 1965 to 1994, and translated and edited the Russian classic watermark albums, culminating in <span class="italic">Likhachev's Watermarks</span> (1994). His professional achievements were recognized with the award of a civilian OBE in 1981 and the honorary degree of DLitt from Birmingham University in 1987.<br>
<br>All Souls College, Oxford, was an important part of Simmons's life, initially through his friendships with its warden, John Sparrow, and with Isaiah Berlin. As early as 1961 he was accorded the rare privilege of being made a member of the common room, and he was elected a fellow in 1965. Between 1970 and 1982 he was senior research fellow and Codrington librarian. After his retirement in 1982 and appointment as deputy archivist, he lectured and published on the history of the college, collaborating with Howard Colvin on a series of Chichele lectures which led to <span class="italic">All Souls: an Oxford College and its Buildings</span> (1989).<br>
<br>On retirement, with characteristic lack of sentimentality and regard for the useful, Simmons was at pains to ensure that his considerable working library was distributed among suitable libraries and individuals. After the death of his beloved wife, Fanny, in 1999, the Codrington Library became a second home. He died at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford on 22 September 2005 after a heart attack. He left his body to science and stipulated that there should be no funeral or memorial service. A celebration of his life took place in the Codrington Library on 28 January 2006. He left part of his estate (valued at around &pound;880,000) to All Souls College on condition that it move its sundial, designed by Sir Christopher Wren, from the wall of the Codrington Library to the south front of the college chapel (where it had originally been placed); the college declined the bequest.<br>
