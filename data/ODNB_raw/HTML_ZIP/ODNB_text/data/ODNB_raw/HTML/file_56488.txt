<span class="headword">Grant, Sir  George  Macpherson-</span>, third baronet  (1839&#150;1907), <span class="occ">cattle breeder, landowner, and politician</span>, was born on 12 August 1839, probably at Ballindalloch, Banffshire. He was the eldest son of Sir John Macpherson-Grant (1804&#150;1850) and his wife, Marion Helen Campbell (1810&#150;1855). His father was the second baronet and grandson of Sir George Macpherson, the first baronet, who had inherited the estate of Ballindalloch, Banffshire, as heir to his father's maternal uncle, General James Grant, adding the additional surname of Grant. George was educated at Harrow School and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated in 1861. On 3 July 1861 he married Frances Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1916), daughter of the Revd R. Pocklington, vicar of Wallesby, Nottinghamshire, and returned to take charge of the family's 125,000 acre estates at Ballindalloch and Invereshie on attaining his majority later that year.<br>
<br>When Macpherson-Grant returned to his properties, the roots of breeding polled cattle were already well formed. While the fixation of specific breeds of cattle in England began about 1750, it was not until the beginning of the nineteenth century that Scottish farmers turned their attention to the perfection of pedigree livestock. Both his father and grandfather had been noted for taking a prominent part in improving the local breed of polled cattle at Ballindalloch, along with other landowners&#151;Hugh Watson of Keillor (1789&#150;1860) in the county of Angus and William M'Combie of Tillyfour (1805&#150;1880) in Aberdeenshire. In 1835 his grandfather had employed James Mackay as manager, a post which he held for the next forty-one years, during the whole of which time he was engaged in managing and improving the Ballindalloch herd for three generations of his employers' family. While there was thus already a solid base to build on at Ballindalloch, Macpherson-Grant's and Mackay's purchase of the cow Erica 843, for 50 guineas, at the Kinnaird sale on the dispersion of the Watson herd in 1861, is considered the commencement of the &#145;Ballindalloch era&#146; for polled or Aberdeen Angus cattle. Erica became, as part of the Ballindalloch herd, the founder of the premier family of the breed, producing eight calves between 1862 and 1872, when she died of an abscess at the age of sixteen. Of these calves four were bulls and four were heifers, and it is from the latter that the three recognized branches of the Erica family are drawn and defined by the bull: the Chieftain Ericas, the Kildonian Ericas, and the Trojan Ericas.<br>
<br>Aside from this breeding success that made Macpherson-Grant a world renowned figure, he was also instrumental in the general public presentation of the breed and in establishing its international reputation as the foremost producer of high-quality beef. About 1857 the <span class="italic">Herd Book</span> was restarted, the original having been destroyed by fire in 1851, and Macpherson-Grant was the main agent in the formation of the Polled Cattle Society (30 July 1879). Because of the sensitivities of whether to place Angus or Aberdeen in the foremost position, it not being clear where the breed lines first formed, it was not until 1886 that the <span class="italic">Herd Book</span> name of the breed became the Aberdeen Angus, and not until October 1907 that the society itself finally changed its name. Macpherson-Grant held office as president of the society for two terms in 1882&#150;5 and 1891&#150;3, his first term following Queen Victoria's acceptance of the role of patroness of the society in July 1881. She was followed in this office by successive monarchs. Macpherson-Grant was also president of the Highland and Agricultural Society in 1892, being the first &#145;commoner&#146; president of that body.<br>
<br>In the 1865 parliamentary election Macpherson-Grant contested the seat for the county of Inverness, losing to the sitting MP by thirty-nine votes, and it was not until 1879 that he was elected as Liberal MP for Elginshire and Nairnshire, defeating the Conservative Brodie of Brodie with a majority of 258 votes. He was re-elected as a Liberal again in 1880, this time unopposed, and once again in 1885, defeating Brodie of Brodie who stood for the Conservatives, and C. H. Anderson who stood as an independent Liberal. In the home-rule crisis of 1885 he refused to follow W. E. Gladstone, and in the 1886 election moved to the Unionists, losing his seat by 119 votes to C. H. Anderson, who now stood as a home-ruler. In local politics he was convener of the county of Banff from 1868 to 1881, when he resigned because of the pressure of his parliamentary duties. Following his departure from Westminster he was re-elected to the position of Banffshire convener in 1887, finally retiring in 1896. He also held, until his death, the position of convener of the Banffshire Commissioners of Supply. He was appointed deputy lieutenant of Banffshire in 1860, of Inverness-shire in 1861, and of Moray in 1866. He was also a director of the Highland Railway Company from 1877 to 1903, and its chairman from 1897. As a central figure in the local community Macpherson-Grant also sat on parochial and other local boards, but it was his work in agriculture that was his greatest interest. Besides his national work as a livestock breeder, at the local level he devoted much of his time to assisting his tenants during the depression years from 1873 to 1896 and supporting the Spey, Aven and Fiddichside Farmers' Club, of which he was president.<br>
<br>In November 1907 Macpherson-Grant travelled south to Edinburgh, intending to winter in the south of England. While in Edinburgh he caught a chill, and remaining there a fortnight, died of heart failure on 5 December 1907. His body was returned to Ballindalloch Castle for the funeral, which took place on Tuesday 10 December. The numerous tenants and estate workers who turned out for the public funeral procession to the church at Inveravon were testimony not only to the high professional reputation he had earned by his work on the Ballindalloch herd but also to the great personal regard in which he was held locally as a considerate and caring landlord. There was no hearse, but a lorry, draped in the Grant tartan, drawn by two brown horses and flanked by gamekeepers, the piper piping &#145;Glengarry's Lament&#146;. He was interred in the family vault in Inveravon churchyard, and was survived by Lady Macpherson-Grant, three sons, and a daughter. He was succeeded by Sir John Macpherson-Grant. There was still a herd of Aberdeen Angus cattle at Ballindalloch a century after his death.<br>
