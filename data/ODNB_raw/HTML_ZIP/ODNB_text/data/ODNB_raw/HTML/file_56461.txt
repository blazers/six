<span class="headword">Stansfeld <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ashurst]</span>,  Caroline</span>  (1816&#150;1885), <span class="occ">radical</span>, was born in London on 28 January 1816, the daughter of a wealthy lawyer, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/785/', "William Henry Ashurst (bap. 1791?, d. 1855)")</script> and his wife, Elizabeth Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brown (<i>d</i>. 1854). She had three sisters, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42330/', "Eliza Ashurst (Bardonneau)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59172/', "Matilda Biggs")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50085/', "Emilie Venturi")</script>, and one brother, also William Henry Ashurst. Her father was a well-known radical who lent his support to many progressive causes, such as Owenism, anti-corn law agitation, Chartism, and anti-slavery. His daughters were consequently brought up in a highly stimulating and unconventional environment: their home in Muswell Hill was a magnet for many of the radical thinkers and reformers of the day, including Robert Owen, William James Linton, and Clementia and Peter A. Taylor, and maintained close links with the American abolitionists. Stansfeld's father was extremely progressive on the position of women's rights and allowed his daughters a freedom which many contemporaries found shocking, particularly their habit of smoking cigars!<br>
<br>On 27 July 1844 Caroline Ashurst married a wealthy young lawyer, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26288/', "James Stansfeld (1820&#150;1898)")</script>, the only son of James Stansfeld, a county court judge, and Emma Stansfeld (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Ralph), the daughter of a Unitarian minister. Caroline and James were married by the radical Unitarian minister William Johnson Fox at South Place Chapel in Finsbury. The ceremony perfectly expressed their radical concept of marriage. They repeated only &#145;the two sentences rendered necessary by the Act&#146; and exchanged rings to symbolize their recognition that marriage was a union of equals. James Stansfeld was one of a group of young radical lawyers (others included William Shaen and William Case) and reformers who formed an intimate set with the Ashurst family, the Muswell Hill brigade. James Stansfeld, who entered parliament in 1859, became one of the country's leading male activists in the women's rights movement, and in 1880 he was not included in Gladstone's cabinet because of his prominent role in the campaign against the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Act</span>.<br>
<br>Rather less bold and flamboyant than her sisters, Caroline Stansfeld provided a vital supporting role to the feminist work of her husband and her sisters. She was closely associated in the 1840s with the activities of the earliest organized feminists, working for such causes as the Associate Institution (to reform the laws relating to prostitution) and sitting on the executive council of the Whittington Club (a radical experiment in equal adult education). Caroline Stansfeld retained her commitment to the women's movement as it matured, and between 1867 and 1883 played an important role on the executive of the London Society for Women's Suffrage, as well as participating in the struggle to repeal the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Act</span>. She was closely involved in the work of Clementia Taylor, whose home, Aubrey House, functioned as a centre of organized radicalism. In 1863 Stansfeld and her sisters assisted Taylor in establishing a society aimed at disseminating propaganda in support of the Union in the American Civil War.<br>
<br>Caroline Stansfeld was a staunch supporter of the unification of Italy. She and her husband were leading members of the Society of the Friends of Italy, and Caroline worked tirelessly to raise money for the Italian cause, through the organization, for example, of large-scale bazaars. More importantly she was intimate with the Italian revolutionary and republican Giuseppe Mazzini, who had become extremely close to the Ashurst clan (as they were known) in the 1840s. Mazzini referred to Caroline as &#145;his ministering angel&#146;: she assisted him in a variety of capacities, helping not only with his personal and domestic affairs but aiding him with his literary work, as well as becoming involved in more dangerous activities, such as securing money and documents for Italian revolutionaries and providing secret places of refuge for them. (James Stansfeld had to resign a government post in 1864 after being implicated in an Italian plot to assassinate Napoleon III.) She assisted her sister, Emilie Venturi, in setting up a private postal system between Italian insurrectionists in Paris and London. Caroline and James named their only child, Joseph James Stansfeld (<i>b</i>. 19 April 1852), after Mazzini. They later became closely associated with Giuseppe Garibaldi.<br>
<br>Caroline Stansfeld was connected with some of the leading novelists of the age, becoming a good friend of George Meredith and earlier impressing George Sand (whose novels her sister, Eliza, translated) with her fervent support for Louis Blanc and also her personal charm and prettiness. From 1881 Caroline Stansfeld began to suffer from a debilitating illness, which affected both her mental state as well as her physical health, and she died of a cerebral haemorrhage at her home, Stoke Lodge, Hyde Park Gate, London, on 29 March 1885.<br>
