<span class="headword">Raven,  Charles Earle</span>  (1885&#150;1964), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, was born on 4 July 1885 in Paddington, London, the eldest of the three children of John Earle Raven, barrister, and his wife, Alice, daughter of Edward Comber, a Liverpool merchant. His younger brother was Edward Earle Raven who was chaplain of St John's College, Cambridge (1921&#150;6), and dean from 1927 until his death in 1951. Charles Raven was educated at Uppingham School, in Fircroft House which was then under his uncle, the Revd Tancred Earle Raven. He won a classical scholarship to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and obtained a first class in part one of the classical tripos in 1907, and a first with distinction in part two of the theological tripos in 1908, specializing in early Christian doctrine. In July 1906, while still an undergraduate, he became engaged to the master's niece, Margaret Ermyntrude Buchanan (Bee) Wollaston, whom he married in 1910. They had a son and three daughters. Raven started his career as assistant secretary for secondary education under the Liverpool city council (1908&#150;9), where he was miserable; for the first time, however, he saw beyond his middle-class upbringing, to understand the meaning of fellowship and dedication, when he engaged in the work of a boys' club. In 1909 he was offered the position of lecturer in divinity, fellow, and dean of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, provided he would be ordained that December. The idea fitted his newly found sense of vocation, and he took up the post at the beginning of 1910. There he was instantly thrown into a tense college and university controversy as the master, William Chawner, had issued a pamphlet declaring that Christian orthodoxy was indefensible: Raven, <i>ex officio</i> at the centre of the ensuing storm, went through a time of intense anxiety.<br>
<br>After the outbreak of war, Raven was assistant master at Tonbridge School, in 1915&#150;17, and a front-line army chaplain in France during 1917&#150;18, where he suffered slightly from being gassed. He returned to Emmanuel and, needing a home for his wife and four children, accepted the college living of Bletchingley, Surrey, where he was rector for four years, until he became residentiary canon of the new Liverpool Cathedral from 1924 to 1932. Raven was already well known for his oratory, and as early as 1920 he was appointed a chaplain to the king. Within the life of the travelling preacher he managed to write two important books. <span class="italic">Christian Socialism, 1848&#150;1854</span> (1920) was the first to treat this important Victorian movement historically; he felt strong links with the ideals of Christian socialism, and was one of the chief organizers of the influential Conference on Christian Politics, Economics and Citizenship (Copec) in 1924: he was its joint secretary from 1920 to 1928, under the chairmanship of William Temple, who remained a lifelong friend. In 1923 he published <span class="italic">Apollinarianism</span>, a sober and fundamental study of a then neglected aspect of primitive Christian thought, which made his name in a different world, that of academic divinity, and gained him a Cambridge DD. In 1932 he was appointed regius professor of divinity at Cambridge. With the chair he held a canonry at Ely Cathedral (1932&#150;40), a fellowship at Christ's College, and from 1939 to 1950 the mastership of Christ's.<br>
<br>As professor Raven had a full audience; he would lecture <i>extempore</i>, pacing with restless energy about the room. The lectures were not geared to undergraduates' needs to pass examinations, nor easy to summarize in the form of notes. The austere Cambridge tradition of linguistic knowledge and historical texts he regarded as excellent but far too narrow. He long argued for a wider syllabus, especially to include the place of theology in the modern world, and like many reformers he did not see the reform for which he had worked until after he had retired. But his own lectures took the great Christian themes one by one&#151;God, Christ, Holy Spirit, creation, creed, future life, idea of the church&#151;and tried to expound them in the context of a scientific world and contemporary social need. The thinkers to whom he loved to point were those who tried to marry faith with the reason and science of their own day: the Alexandrian fathers in the third century, or the Cambridge Platonists in the seventeenth. The difficulty, as in all his writing, lay in showing how the drastic reinterpretation which he called for would differ from the watering down of Christianity (as he thought it) in the work of scientific modernists such as Ernest William Barnes or James Bethune-Baker. He had a deeper sense of immediacy&#151;even ecstasy&#151;in religious experience, and a quicker perception of the numinous in nature, which he could more easily make men feel than himself analyse. A brilliant scholar, he had too large a heart to attain the detachment of the pure academic.<br>
<br>From boyhood Raven loved birds and insects and wild flowers, and as an adult he made himself expert in the history of the life-sciences. He wrote a happy little book, <span class="italic">In Praise of Birds</span> (1925), painted wild flowers and birds with exquisite precision, and was a pioneer of the photography of birds in flight. His desire to heal the breach between faith and reason turned slowly towards reconciling science and religion: he believed that the evolutionary process could be accounted for only in terms of the movement of spirit. He wrote and lectured more on the theme of science and religion than on any other subject: to him, science meant biology and evolution, and religion a humane and liberal interpretation of Christianity. The most ambitious of these efforts were the Gifford lectures at Edinburgh for 1951&#150;2, published as <span class="italic">Natural Religion and Christian Theology</span> (1953). But his best books in the field were more modest endeavours to explain early English science: <span class="italic">John Ray, Naturalist</span> (1942) and <span class="italic">English Naturalists from Neckam to Ray</span> (1947&#151;which won a James Tait Black prize) were notable contributions to the history of biology. As war approached in the late thirties, liberal divinity was assailed as too facile for the ills of the age. Raven vehemently denounced the swing against reason and the leaders of European intellectual reaction headed by Karl Barth. In his later years as professor he felt grief that young men seemed to be neglecting his type of liberal thought, and it came as a relief when the French Jesuit Teilhard de Chardin won posthumous celebrity for a proposal to reconcile evolution with faith along lines which were in substance those proposed by Raven himself three decades before. In 1962 Raven published the first English biography of de Chardin.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Raven met the course of the world head on over the question of pacifism. During the twenties he slowly came to adopt the position as faithful to the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, and in 1932 he became chairman of the Fellowship of Reconciliation and two years later one of the sponsors of the Peace Pledge Union with the Revd H. R. L. (Dick) Sheppard; he delivered an impressive apologia in his Halley Stewart lectures of 1934, published as <span class="italic">Is War Obsolete?</span> (1935). This movement lost influence unsteadily from 1937 as the Nazi threat grew, but Raven was a man who committed his heart to a cause and did not waver, in spite of frustration and depression of spirit. At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 he therefore faced unpopularity and contempt, although he gave unfailing help to refugees in England, and at times even he could not quite be constant, as when he gave thanks in the college chapel for the victory at El Alamein. He would have liked high office in the Church of England, but so much controversy surrounded his name during the years when he was the right age that he was passed over. In 1947, however, Cambridge University unexpectedly summoned him to be vice-chancellor. His two years of office were difficult, with so many returned soldiers crowding two into a room; but Raven confounded prophets who predicted that so charismatic a man could not administer a great institution. As one who had long contended for the advancement of women (including their ordination) he had the special happiness of presiding over the belated but at last unopposed admission of women to full membership of the university, and of bringing the queen to an honorary degree as the first women graduated in 1948. In the same year he helped to choose J. C. Smuts as the university's new chancellor; they had been friends for many years.<br>
<br>On his retirement from both chair and mastership in 1950, Raven accepted the position of warden of Madingley Hall, which the university had just bought as a hostel. The hall needed a good secretary, not one of the principal orators of Europe who felt that it was &#145;a backwater&#146; offering little scope for his talents; the result was not altogether happy, and he gave up the wardenship in 1954. However, Raven travelled, lectured, and preached more widely than ever after his retirement, visiting the United States several times, Australia and New Zealand (1950), Canada (1952), Russia (1954), and India in 1955&#150;6. He spent much time in visiting schools, too, where he would both preach and talk informally to the boys, and it was said that his ministry to sixth-formers may have been the most influential of his career; he was also a popular figure on radio and television (once the wartime ban on his voice as a pacifist had been lifted), giving a new dimension to religious broadcasting. All his adult life he had been a great preacher and a natural leader of men: tall and spare, with chiselled features, brilliant eyes, a youthful appearance, dynamic energy, and a magical voice, he never spoke without riveting attention; yet he never outgrew a certain nervousness before preaching, and would privately rehearse like an actor in order to speak without notes. On religious subjects he felt passionately, and at his best he could communicate the fervour and agony which were a part of his being. With an evangelical gospel, he was simultaneously an intellectual and a classicist trying to integrate his own faith and that of his hearers into the honest apprehension of a scientific world&#151;a quality which made him wanted as a lecturer and in pulpits everywhere. He retained the magnetic power of his oratory until the end of his life.<br>
<br>Raven was a trustee of the British Museum from 1950, a fellow of the British Academy from 1948, president of the Botanical Society of the British Isles in 1951&#150;5, and fellow of the Linnean Society; and he received honorary degrees from many universities: the one he valued most was a doctorate of science from Manchester. He wrote many books besides those mentioned: the most important were his Hulsean and Noble lectures of 1926&#150;7, combined as <span class="italic">The Creator Spirit</span> in 1927; <span class="italic">Jesus and the Gospel of Love</span> (1931); <span class="italic">Evolution and the Christian Concept of God</span> (1936); <span class="italic">Science, Religion and the Future</span> (1943, the published version of his Cambridge Open lectures); and <span class="italic">Good News of God</span> (1943).<br>
<br>Raven's first wife died in 1944&#151;a shattering blow, only a year after his own serious illness. After her death his eldest daughter, Mary, presided at the lodge, until in 1954 he married Ethel, widow of John Moors, of Boston, Massachusetts, with whom he had worked closely in the pacifist cause. She was already eighty, and died on honeymoon within a fortnight of the marriage. In 1956 he married H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Jeanty (Ninette), a former worker in the Belgian resistance whose first husband had been shot by the Nazis; living partly in Cambridge and partly in Brussels, they dedicated themselves to a mission of reconciliation between students of different races. Raven died at his home, 10 Madingley Road, Cambridge, on 8 July 1964. His only son, John Earle Raven (<i>d</i>. 1980), became a fellow and dean of King's College, Cambridge, and an authority upon both ancient Greek philosophy and mountain plants.<br>
