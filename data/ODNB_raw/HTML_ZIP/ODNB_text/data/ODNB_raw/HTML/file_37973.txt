<span class="headword">Slessor,  Mary Mitchell</span>  (1848&#150;1915), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born on 2 December 1848 in Gilcomston, a suburb of Aberdeen, the second of seven children (four of whom reached adulthood) of Robert Slessor, shoemaker, of Buchan, and his wife, Mary Mitchell (1821&#150;1885), weaver, of Old Meldrum. Robert Slessor's alcoholism lost him his job, and in 1859 the family moved to live at 17 Harriet Street, Dundee, to look for work. Mary, aged eleven, became a weaver in the textile mills and was soon the family's principal breadwinner. She received some education at night school, but was largely self-taught.<br>
<br>Active in the local United Presbyterian church, Mary Slessor became a voluntary teacher at Queen Street mission and followed the activities of the church abroad. Her younger brother John's early death and the missionary fervour aroused by the death of David Livingstone in 1873 spurred her into applying for work further afield. Accepted by the foreign mission board as a teacher in Duke Town, Calabar, Nigeria, in August 1876 she sailed for west Africa after three months' missionary training at Moray House, Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Quickly picking up the local Efik language and immersing herself in work among the women, Mary applied for a remote station where she could live frugally and send more of her annual &pound;60 salary to her family in Scotland. Her move 3 miles up river to Old Town was the first step in a gradual journey into the district of Okoyong and away from the European settlement on the coast. When her mother died on 31 December 1885 and her sister Janie died the following year, Mary's last links with home were broken: &#145;Heaven is now nearer to me than Britain,&#146; she wrote. Moving still further inland, she dispensed with the trappings of the colonial lifestyle&#151;she drank unboiled water, used no mosquito net, walked barefoot, and even went without the indispensable hat. Visitors commented upon the tiny Scotswoman's sunburnt face and unkempt appearance. When the traveller Mary Kingsley visited her at Ekenge in 1895, she found that: &#145;Miss Slessor &hellip; has lost most of her missionary ideas and bullies the native chiefs in their own tongue &hellip; and is regarded by the other missionaries as mad and dangerous.&#146; Her insistence on setting up lone stations cut off from the central missionary settlement led her into conflict with the authorities, who often thwarted her persistent applications to go further up-country.<br>
<br>In 1891 Mary Slessor was briefly engaged to Charles Morrison, a Scottish missionary teacher at Duke Town and eighteen years her junior. However, when the mission board refused to allow him to join her in Okoyong, the relationship was broken off. Her family became the twins she adopted, whose lives were in danger through local belief that twin births were the result of a coupling with evil spirits. Anxious about leaving her charges when she visited Britain, she began to take them with her, in 1883 first bringing Atim Eso to Dundee, where the six-month-old baby was christened Janie Slessor.<br>
<br>In 1892 Mary was appointed vice-consul in Okoyong, presiding over the native court; later, in 1905, she became vice-president of the Ikot Obong native court. A natural meddler with an iron will, the role of magistrate suited her well. Even after her resignation she continued to petition the district officer concerning injustices and disputes, particularly on behalf of the women for whose rights she continually campaigned. It is said that no woman lost a case while Mary Slessor was presiding.<br>
<br>A heroine of popular culture in Britain and heralded as &#145;the White Queen of Okoyong&#146;, she was shy of the publicity greeting her infrequent visits to her homeland and only reluctantly agreed to lecture to raise money for and to increase consciousness of pioneer missionary work. Back in Africa, by 1907 rheumatoid arthritis had almost crippled her and she suffered long periods of inactivity. However, she refused either to move to the comfort of Duke Town or to return to Britain. In 1913 she received the order of St John of Jerusalem. She died of fever and dysentery on 13 January 1915 in Calabar, and was buried in the cemetery there.<br>
