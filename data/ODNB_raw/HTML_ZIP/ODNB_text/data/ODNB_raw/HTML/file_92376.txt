<span class="headword">Robson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Arvidsson]</span>,  Inga-Stina</span>, Baroness Robson of Kiddington  (1919&#150;1999), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in Stockholm, Sweden, on 20 August 1919, the elder of the two daughters of Erik Robert Arvidsson, timber exporter, and his wife, Lilly Augusta Danielson, formerly an optician. She excelled at the private &Ouml;linska Girls' School in Stockholm, followed by a year-long secretarial course; skiing and sailing became lifelong pursuits. Early in 1939 she went to work for the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs and was posted to Sweden's embassy in London. She decided to settle in Britain after meeting Lawrence William Robson (1904&#150;1982), chartered accountant, son of Michael William Robson, civil engineer. They married on 13 March 1940 at the Swedish protestant church, Harcourt Street, London. Fluent in four languages, she translated German documents for the Ministry of Information in 1942 and 1943.<br>
<br>Robson assisted her husband, a partner in the accounting firm of Robson, Rhodes &amp; Co. and a farmer in Oxfordshire, in his parliamentary campaign for the Liberals in the Banbury division of Oxfordshire at the general election of 1950. The Robsons lived at Kiddington Hall, a Charles Barry house with a Capability Brown garden, situated near Woodstock, Oxfordshire. Before they became too numerous, Liberal MPs held regular meetings and retreats at Kiddington Hall's conference centre. At these events she was a charming hostess, fashionably but not flamboyantly dressed; one commentator later contrasted her designer clothes with her political anorak tendency. In 1955 her husband joined a government committee inquiring into the nationalized electrical supply industry, and she replaced him as Liberal candidate for the Eye division of Suffolk, and stood again in 1959. In neither this seat nor Gloucester, which she contested in 1964 and 1966, were the Liberals strong contenders and she was unsuccessful on all four occasions. She was a rural district councillor at Chipping Norton during the 1960s and an Oxfordshire magistrate from 1955; by the time of her retirement from the bench, in 1989, she was England's longest-serving magistrate.<br>
<br>From 1968 until 1970 Robson was president of the Women's Liberal Federation and on her second attempt was elected party president for 1970&#150;71. During this time the Liberal leadership was under pressure from the &#145;red guard&#146; of its youth wing, which sought radically to alter the party's structure and focus, supported &#145;direct action&#146; on issues like apartheid, and urged a more pro-Arab position on the Middle Eastern question. As president she repudiated suggestions that party members should join street demonstrations and took a firmer line against the militant youth than had her predecessor.<br>
<br>Stina Robson's party services were recognized with her elevation to a life peerage in May 1974, which she regarded as an illustration of Britain's acceptance of outsiders. In the House of Lords she was party spokesman on issues of longstanding interest, such as agriculture and the environment. In addition to these portfolios she belonged to the influential select committee on the European Community and chaired a committee investigating European Union budget fraud in 1988&#150;9. She participated frequently in European debates and maintained her contacts in Sweden, where she sometimes commented on politics for the media. In addition to its slightly foreign intonation, her voice had a husky quality resulting from chain-smoking&#151;a somewhat surprising habit, given her longstanding involvement with health care. From 1966 she was a governor of University College Hospital until most hospital governors were abolished in 1974, when she became chairman of the new South-West Thames regional health authority, a position which she held for eight years. She also served on the board of the Midwife Teachers' Training College, and as chairman of both the Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital board (1970&#150;84); in 1990 she revived the fund-raising Queen Charlotte's Ball which until 1977 had been a longstanding highlight of the social season. In 1993 she became the Liberal Democrats' spokesman on health.<br>
<br>After her husband's death in 1982 Robson succeeded him as chairman of the National Liberal Club's management committee, and continued his effort to reverse the damage of years of serious mismanagement, and to ensure the club's long-term survival. She also succeeded her husband as chairman of the Anglo-Swedish Society. She died from heart failure at Chilton House, Chilton, Aylesbury, on 9 February 1999, and was buried at St Nicholas's Church, Kiddington.<br>
