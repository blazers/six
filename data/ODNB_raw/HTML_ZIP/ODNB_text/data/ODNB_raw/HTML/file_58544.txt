<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gibson, Sir  Alexander Drummond</span>  (1926&#150;1995), <span class="occ">conductor</span>, was born in Motherwell maternity home, Lanarkshire, on 11 February 1926, the son of James McClure Gibson, a butcher, and his wife, Williamina Williams. Educated at Dalziel High School, he was taken at the age of twelve to his first opera, <span class="italic">Madama Butterfly</span>, performed by the Carl Rosa company at the Theatre Royal, Glasgow. At fourteen he sang the Major-General in <span class="italic">The Pirates of Penzance</span>. He studied the piano at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music, where he was a prizewinner.<br>
<br>Gibson served in the Royal Corps of Signals (1944&#150;8), and joined the Royal Signals band as solo pianist. Demobbed in 1948, he won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music in London. While there he conducted Mozart's <span class="italic">Cos&igrave; fan tutte</span> (1950) for the opera school, and won the Tagore gold medal. He also studied conducting at the Salzburg Mozarteum with Igor Markevich and in Siena at the Accademia Chirigiana with Paul van Kempen. In 1951 he entered an international conducting competition at Besan&ccedil;on, and won the Georges Enescu prize. He joined Sadler's Wells Opera as a r&eacute;p&eacute;titeur in that year, and conducted his first opera there, <span class="italic">The Bartered Bride</span>, in 1952. He then returned to Glasgow to become assistant conductor to Ian Whyte at the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, and in 1954 conducted the Scottish National Orchestra in Gounod's <span class="italic">Faust</span> and Wolf-Ferrari's <span class="italic">The Jewels of the Madonna</span> for Glasgow Grand Opera Society. In the same year he returned to Sadler's Wells as a staff conductor, and during the next three seasons conducted <span class="italic">Tosca</span>, <span class="italic">Pagliacci</span>, <span class="italic">La traviata</span>, Menotti's <span class="italic">The Consul</span>, <span class="italic">La boh&egrave;me</span>, <span class="italic">Die Fledermaus</span>, and other operas.<br>
<br>In 1957 Gibson became music director of Sadler's Wells, and conducted the world premi&egrave;re of John Gardner's <span class="italic">The Moon and Sixpence</span>, based on the novel by Somerset Maugham. He also made his d&eacute;but at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, conducting <span class="italic">Tosca</span>. Other operas he conducted at Sadler's Wells included <span class="italic">Eugene Onegin</span>, <span class="italic">Gianni Schicchi</span>, <span class="italic">Falstaff</span>, <span class="italic">The Flying Dutchman</span>, and <span class="italic">Bluebeard's Castle</span>. He also conducted the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, a connection that continued throughout his career, and recorded Sibelius's fifth symphony with the London Symphony Orchestra.<br>
<br>Leaving Sadler's Wells in 1959, Gibson became the first Scottish-born principal conductor of the Scottish National Orchestra (SNO), gaining particular praise for a cycle of Sibelius symphonies. In that year, on 21 February, he married (Ann) Veronica Waggett, a ballet dancer. There were three sons and a daughter from the marriage. In 1961 he was one of a group of four&#151;which also included Richard Telfer, an Edinburgh music teacher, Ainslie Millar, a chartered surveyor, and Ian Rodgers, a solicitor&#151;who planned to give a week's season of opera at the King's Theatre, Glasgow, with the SNO in the pit and funded by Scottish Television and the Scottish Committee of the Arts Council of Great Britain. The first season had to be postponed, but on 5 June 1962 Scottish Opera (SO) was born. There were three performances of <span class="italic">Madama Butterfly</span> and three of <span class="italic">Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</span> (it was the centenary of Debussy's birth). Gibson conducted all performances but one <span class="italic">Butterfly</span>. That autumn Peter Hemmings, then in charge of repertory and planning at Sadler's Wells, joined Scottish Opera as part-time administrator, later becoming full-time general manager. In 1963 there was a week in Edinburgh, at the King's Theatre, as well as the week in Glasgow. Gibson conducted a much admired production of Verdi's <span class="italic">Otello</span>, as well as the British premi&egrave;re of Luigi Dallapiccola's <span class="italic">Night Flight</span>.<br>
<br>Over the next few years SO expanded its repertory as well as the length of the season and the number of places it visited: Aberdeen, Perth, Stirling, and later Newcastle upon Tyne were added to the tour. Mussorgsky's <span class="italic">Boris Godunov</span>, conducted by Gibson in 1965, was a major landmark, while <span class="italic">Die Walk&uuml;re</span> in 1966 heralded the beginning of a cycle of Wagner's <span class="italic">Der Ring des Nibelungen</span>. In 1967, the year in which Gibson was appointed CBE, SO appeared for the first time at the Edinburgh Festival, with Stravinsky's <span class="italic">The Rake's Progress</span>. In October that year Gibson and the SNO played in Vienna. The soloists were the cellist Jacqueline du Pr&eacute; and the mezzo-soprano Janet Baker. In 1969 Baker sang Dido in <span class="italic">The Trojans</span> by Berlioz, one of SO's greatest successes and also a personal triumph for Gibson.<br>
<br>The year 1970 brought a second appearance for SO at the Edinburgh Festival, with Hans Werner Henze's <span class="italic">Elegy for Young Lovers</span>. <span class="italic">Der Rosenkavalier</span> in 1971 scored another success, while a complete cycle of <span class="italic">Der Ring</span> was given in December, Gibson's finest achievement to date. Gibson continued to conduct at least two operas a year. In 1972 they were <span class="italic">Tristan und Isolde</span> and <span class="italic">The Merry Widow</span>; in 1974 the world premi&egrave;re of Iain Hamilton's <span class="italic">Catiline Conspiracy</span> and Gluck's <span class="italic">Alceste</span>; in 1975 Verdi's <span class="italic">Un ballo in maschera</span> and Rimsky-Korsakov's <span class="italic">The Golden Cockerel</span>.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Golden Cockerel</span> was given not in the King's Theatre, Glasgow, but at the Theatre Royal, recently acquired and restored by SO, which finally achieved its own home. In 1976 Gibson conducted Verdi's <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> and Wagner's <span class="italic">Die Meistersinger von N&uuml;rnberg</span>. He was knighted in 1977 and a year later was awarded the Sibelius medal by the Finnish government. He demonstrated his versatility once again in 1980 with Berg's <span class="italic">Wozzeck</span> and <span class="italic">Tosca</span>. Gibson was principal guest conductor of the Houston Symphony Orchestra from 1981 to 1983, and retired from his position as chief conductor of the SNO, which no longer played in the pit for Scottish Opera, in 1984. He continued as music director of SO until 1987, then left to become a freelance.<br>
<br>Gibson's twenty-five years at SO had been very rewarding artistically, but he had not been able to take up many of the offers to conduct that flooded in from Europe and America. That now changed. He visited Los Angeles, where Peter Hemmings had become general manager of Music Center Opera. In 1988 he made the first of several guest appearances at Kentucky Opera in Louisville (where Thomson Smillie, once SO's press officer, was administrator), after which he returned annually until 1992. He visited the Bruckner Festival in Linz, where he conducted a concert performance of <span class="italic">Tristan und Isolde</span>. In 1993 he conducted Britten's <span class="italic">Peter Grimes</span> in Copenhagen.<br>
<br>Gibson was widely respected for his devotion to Scottish and English music, received six honorary doctorates, and was an honorary fellow of the major British musical institutions. He returned on several occasions to SO, and was president of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow from 1991 to 1995. In September 1994 he renewed his connection with English National Opera, as Sadler's Wells Opera had become known, conducting a new production of <span class="italic">Tosca</span> at the London Coliseum. Then on 14 January 1995 he died in St Mary's Hospital, Praed Street, London, following a heart attack. His funeral took place on 21 January in Glasgow. His wife, Veronica, survived him.<br>
<br>It is impossible to overstate the importance of Gibson's work in establishing in Scotland a home of international status for opera which at the same time encouraged local talent. He did not live to see the establishment of a new opera school at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Dance, which eventually opened in 1998; it was a fitting tribute that it should bear his name.<br>
