<span class="headword">Kethe,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1594), <span class="occ">religious polemicist and translator</span>, probably originated in The Mearns, Scotland. Very little is known about his early life; he may have lived in Exeter. What is certain is that by Edward VI's reign he had become a writer of militantly protestant broadside poems. <span class="italic">A Ballet Declaring the Fal of the Whore of Babylone Intytuled &#145;Tye thy Mare, Tom Boye&#146;</span> (1548?) satirized the Roman Catholic church, whereas <span class="italic">Of Misrules Contending with Gods Worde by Name</span> (1553?) expressed confidence that the Edwardian regime would correct unscriptural practice. Following the succession of Mary I, Kethe exiled himself to Frankfurt am Main, Germany, arriving by December 1554 and entering the lists against the Marian government (particularly Lord Chancellor Stephen Gardiner, a Catholic hardliner) with <span class="italic">William Keth his Seeing Glasse</span> (<i>c</i>.1555). A liturgical dispute now broke out among the English asylum seekers; a puritan faction led by John Knox and including Kethe, William Whittingham, John Foxe, and Anthony Gilby won the backing of John Calvin for their refusal to use the 1552 prayer book which contained ceremonies regarded as papist superstition. In August 1555 the group seceded from Frankfurt and headed for the protection of Calvin's Geneva; on 5 November 1556 Kethe was received into Knox's congregation there, having perhaps spent the interim with Foxe at Basel. Kethe was by now married to Elizabeth, a widow, who accompanied him; they did not have children.<br>
<br>In 1557 Kethe and John Bodley travelled with another group of English exiles from Wesel in Germany to a Swiss refuge at Aarau. Kethe now espoused the radical political ideas developed by some of his colleagues. Christopher Goodman's <span class="italic">How Superior Powers Oght to be Obeyd of their Subjects</span> (1558) encouraged the people actively to resist Mary as an idolatrous tyrant and Kethe endorsed this in his introductory poem:<blockquote>
<div>Whom fury long fosterd by sufferance and awe,<br>
</div>
<div>Have right rule subverted, and made will their lawe,<br>
</div>
<div>Whose pride how to temper, this truth will thee tell,<br>
</div>
<div>So as thou resist mayst, and yet not rebel.<br>
</div> (Warton, 4.225, n. 3)</blockquote>Kethe also echoed the demand for violent resistance contained in Knox's <span class="italic">Appellation</span> (1558) by including with it his metrical translation of <span class="roman">Psalm 94</span> and an incitement to &#145;up and rise with me against this wicked band&#146;  (Ridley, 278).<br>
<br>Kethe's lasting achievement was his translation of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> into English metrical verse. He was the single greatest Geneva-based contributor to the psalter published with the 1561 edition of the &eacute;migr&eacute;s' alternative liturgy, <span class="italic">The Forme of Prayers and Ministration of the Sacraments Approved by J Calvyn</span>. The core psalms were taken from an earlier work by Thomas Sternhold and John Hopkins with the innovation that accompanying tunes were supplied. Kethe's own contribution of twenty-five psalms exhibited a strong French influence. His best-known psalm was 100 (&#145;Al people that on earth do dwel&#146;), known as the &#145;Old Hundredth&#146;, which he set to an existing tune by Louis Bourgeois. Kethe's <span class="roman">Psalms</span> were enormously influential: all were included in the Scottish psalter (1564), fewer in the English psalter (1562).<br>
<br>Mary's death and the succession of Elizabeth I were read as providential signs by the Genevans that the issues dividing them from the other exiles should be resolved. In December 1558 the leadership dispatched Kethe on a tour of the other congregations bearing a letter enjoining unity. He returned in January 1559 and probably assisted in the production of the Geneva <span class="roman">Bible</span> (1560), which was as immensely popular with committed protestants over the following century as it was anathematical to conformists who deprecated its acceptance of resistance theory. Kethe received permission to leave Geneva in May 1560 and by 14 October 1561 had been appointed rector of Child Okeford Inferior, Dorset, by Henry Capel. As chaplain to William Whittingham he participated in the abortive attempt led by the puritan courtier Ambrose Dudley, earl of Warwick, to hold Newhaven (Le Havre), Normandy, against the French from October 1562 until July 1563. Thomas Wood's letter to Gilby of October 1565 demonstrates that Kethe retained contact with the Genevan brotherhood now based in London, and in 1569 he volunteered as preacher to Dudley's army which put down the rising of the northern earls. With the support of such a powerful patron, and that of local puritan gentry like Sir George Trenchard of Wolveton and the less unequivocally zealous John Williams of Herringstone, he apparently escaped harassment by the church courts, becoming the most prominent of the first wave of puritan clergy in Dorset.<br>
<br>The printed edition of Kethe's assize sermon of 17 January 1571 preached at Blandford Forum, which was dedicated to Dudley, his &#145;right honourable very good Lord&#146;  (Lupton, 5.93), roundly condemned the Dorset county governors for failing to suppress papist attempts to stir up sedition following the queen's deposition by Pope Pius V the previous February. The lord lieutenant himself (either Lord Mountjoy or Sir William Paulet) was openly criticized for imprisoning rather than rewarding one local man who brought seditious papist literature to his attention. The populace of this conservative downland area persisted in sinful ways, which Kethe now condemned in his call for reformation: &#145;abuse of the Sabbath daye, bulbeatings, beare-beatings, bowlings, dicying, cardying, daunsynges, drunkeness, whoredome and sturdy vagabondes not looked into&#146;  (ibid., 94).Peter Birchet, who in October 1573 stabbed the sea dog Sir John Hawkins mistaking him for Sir Christopher Hatton, a courtier unpopular with the godly, has been linked with radical puritanism. However, the puritan Kethe encountered him shortly before the incident and thought him &#145;clean out of his wits&#146;  (Collinson, 150&#150;51). Kethe signed his will on 24 January 1594 and died at his rectory before 6 June, when it was proved; he was buried at Child Okeford. His wife outlived him.<br>
