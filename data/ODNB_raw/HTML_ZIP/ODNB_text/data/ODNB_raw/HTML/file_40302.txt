<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cruickshank,  Helen Burness</span>  (1886&#150;1975), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 15 May 1886 in a staff house at Sunnyside Mental Hospital, Hillside, Forfarshire, the youngest of the three children of George Cruickshank (1845&#150;1924), a hospital attendant at Sunnyside, and his wife, Sarah (1850&#150;1940), a domestic servant, daughter of Colin Gibb Wood, master plumber, of Montrose. She had a happy country childhood and later attributed her facility for writing in Scots to her upbringing in Forfarshire, the home of a rich and natural dialect. Annual family holidays in Glenesk gave her a taste for walking and climbing that she later pursued on long trips in the highlands and islands.<br>
<br>Cruickshank was educated at Hillside village school, which she entered at the early age of four, and at Montrose Academy, where she won prizes in every subject. Since her father was unable to afford university fees she left school at fifteen, and entered the civil service in 1903. Cruickshank remained a civil servant for over forty years&#151;until her retirement, on medical grounds, at the end of 1944&#151;holding various clerical and administrative posts, first in London and later in Edinburgh, where she was for many years an executive officer for the Department of Health in Scotland. While in London she was active in promoting better pay for women and women's suffrage. She moved to Edinburgh in 1912 and began to write poetry about this time. In 1921 she acquired a studio flat, where for a few years she enjoyed a pleasantly bohemian life, beginning to publish her poetry and developing her interest in the arts. She never married but two love affairs (the partners are not named) are cited in her memoirs as the inspiration for two of her best-known poems, &#145;There was a Sang&#146; and &#145;Shy Geordie&#146;.<br>
<br>On her father's death, in 1924, it was assumed that Cruickshank, the only daughter of the family, would provide a home for her mother. She bought a semi-detached villa, Dinnieduff, in the village of Corstorphine (later a suburb of Edinburgh), where she lived for the rest of her life. &#145;I had regained a mother but lost my freedom &hellip; On the whole my mother and I achieved a working synthesis of living together&#146;  (Cruickshank, 60, 62).<br>
<br>Cruickshank wrote in both Scots and English (she considered her Scots poetry stronger&#151;probably an accurate assessment), often in lyrical or ballad mode but sometimes experimenting with metre and form in a thoughtful examination of experience and identity. Her first collection was published in 1934, and only two further volumes, together with <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span>, appeared during her lifetime. She regarded herself as a minor poet, and was certainly overshadowed by the male writers of her day, but twenty-five years after her death her work and influence had yet to be fully evaluated.<br>
<br>Cruickshank's interests centred on Scotland, its problems and politics, and especially its culture. Though debarred from political activity during her civil service career, she became a committed Scottish nationalist. She was a founder member and secretary (taking over from the founder, the poet Hugh MacDiarmid) of the Scottish Centre of International PEN (1927), a founder member of the Saltire Society (1936), and an enthusiast for the Edinburgh International Festival from its beginning in 1947. A striking if not conventionally beautiful woman, with an &#145;astringent and sometimes bawdy&#146; sense of humour  (Lochhead), she maintained a busy social life in spite of the demands of work and home and, later, health problems. Invited to a cocktail party at a time when retirement had seriously reduced her income, she found a scarlet pram-cover in the village shop, converted it into a stole, and wore it over a slim, black dress. &#145;I was told it looked smashing&#146;  (Cruickshank, 125).<br>
<br>Cruickshank is particularly remembered for her hospitality at Dinnieduff, where she kept open house for the writers of the Scottish literary renaissance movement of the 1920s and 1930s, including such major figures as Hugh MacDiarmid and the novelist Lewis Grassic Gibbon. She has been called &#145;a catalyst of the Scottish Renaissance&#146; and a &#145;handmaid of the Scottish muse&#146;. Yet she disliked such patronizing terms, including &#145;poetess&#146;, and they undervalue her contribution to Scottish literature.<br>
<br>After her mother's death Cruickshank lived alone, and in spite of deteriorating health was able to remain in her own home until the age of eighty-eight. On medical advice she moved into an Edinburgh nursing home&#151;Queensberry Lodge, 105 Holyrood Road&#151;in November 1974, and died there on 2 March 1975. A cremation service, which she had herself planned in detail, was held at Warriston, Edinburgh.<br>
