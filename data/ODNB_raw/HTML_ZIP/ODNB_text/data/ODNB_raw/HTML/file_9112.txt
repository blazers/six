<span class="headword">Falconer,  John</span>  (1577&#150;1656), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was the second son of Henry Falconer (<i>d</i>. 1579) and his wife, Martha Pike (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1579/80), and was born at Litton, Dorset, on 25 March 1577. His father was the second son of an &#145;ancient and rich family&#146;  (Kenny, 70), his mother a wealthy widow from a respectable Cheshire family. Both parents died while Falconer was an infant. He and his four sisters were raised by their uncle John Brook and a cousin Edward Peto. At the age of eleven Falconer was sent to the grammar school of Sherborne, Dorset, for five years. He spent a year in service to his elder brother in Wiltshire before going up to Oxford in February 1595. He studied for nearly a year at St Mary Hall, and another year at Gloucester Hall, &#145;but visiting his tutor only once a month and avoiding all private and public disputations thus becoming less rather than more learned&#146;  (Kenny, 70). He then &#145;wasted&#146; about two years with his brother in Wiltshire before joining the earl of Essex's expedition against Spain and &#145;returned to London without booty (thank God)&#146;  (Kenny, 70). As a result of the expedition he decided to repent and reform his life. Influenced by Catholics in Henry, Lord Windsor's household, where he served for nearly two and a half years, he converted to Catholicism in 1598. Selling his inheritance to his brother, Falconer left England and was admitted into the English College, Rome, on 27 May 1600 under the assumed name of Dingley. Ordained priest on 20 December 1603, he entered the Society of Jesus in Rome on 18 November 1604. On 28 May 1607 he was sent from Rome to Flanders to prepare to cross into England. Arrested in England some time in 1617 or 1618 he was among the Jesuits banished in 1618. For a year he served as assistant to the master of novices at the English Jesuit noviciate in Li&egrave;ge. Professed of the four vows at Arras on 21 July 1619 he returned to England about 1620. Between 1621 and 1624 he ministered to Catholics in the London area. In 1624 he was transferred to the residence of St Mary, a Jesuit district that comprised Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire. Between 1631 and 1648 he served as confessor, admonitor, and spiritual prefect at English Jesuit houses in Ghent, Li&egrave;ge, and Watten.<br>
<br>Foley assigned Falconer a spirited role in the defence of Wardour Castle against the forces of Sir Edward Hungerford in May 1643  (Foley, 3.525&#150;32). However, according to Jesuit catalogues Falconer was in Ghent at that time. Thus it is more likely that the Falconer involved in the defence was his nephew, a secular priest with the same name.<br>
<br>Falconer's first publication, <span class="italic">A Briefe Refutation of Iohn Traskes Iudaical and Novel Fancyes</span> (1618), castigated John Traske's insistence that certain Jewish traditions and customs must be practised in Christianity. His <span class="italic">Fasciculus myrrhae</span> (1633) and <span class="italic">The Mirrour of Created Perfection</span> (1632) treated two favourite Jesuit themes, the Eucharist and the mother of God. <span class="italic">The Life of S. Catherine</span> (1634) and his translation of <span class="italic">The Admirable Life of Saint Wenefride</span> (1635) by Robert, prior of Shrewsbury, were traditional lives of the saints. The latter was probably written for the use of Catholic pilgrims to the shrine of St Winifred at Holywell, still popular despite the Reformation. In 1648 Falconer returned to London and moved to the residence of St Mary in 1651. There he died on 7 July 1656.<br>
