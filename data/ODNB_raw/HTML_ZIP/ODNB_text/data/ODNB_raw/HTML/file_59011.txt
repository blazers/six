<span class="headword">Waterston,  Jane Elizabeth</span>  (1843&#150;1932), <span class="occ">missionary and doctor in South Africa</span>, was born on 18 January 1843 in Inverness, a middle child of four girls and two boys of the first cousins Agnes Webster and Charles Waterston (<i>d</i>. 1897), the manager of the Caledonian Bank in Inverness.<br>
<br>Jane Waterston was educated privately and at Inverness Royal Academy. Although her father remained a member of the Church of Scotland after the great disruption of 1843, Jane Waterston decided to become a missionary in the Free Church of Scotland, which was then more active in African mission work. When James Stewart of Glasgow, previously a member of David Livingstone's 1862&#150;3 Zambezi expedition, was appointed as principal of Lovedale School in the Ciskei region of Cape Colony in 1866, she accompanied him to South Africa. As principal of the Girls' Institution at Lovedale, formally opened on 23 August 1868, her goal was to turn out women who would be able to establish Christian homes in Africa.<br>
<br>Through Waterston's enthusiastic and energetic leadership, the school produced some of the most notable young black women of the late nineteenth century in Cape Colony, including Letty Ncheni, wife of John Knox Bokwe. But Waterston's heart was not in schoolteaching. Throughout this period she followed the efforts of Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and Sophia Jex Blake to train as doctors. On 11 October 1874, the year of Livingstone's burial in Westminster Abbey, she registered as one of the first students at the London School of Medicine for Women. Her object was to join the Free Church mission to be founded on Lake Nyasa in the wake of Livingstone's death.<br>
<br>After completing her medical training in London and in Ireland, where she obtained the licentiate of the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland, Waterston set out in 1879 for Nyasaland to join the Livingstonia Mission run by Robert Laws. Jane Waterston found Livingstonia an unsympathetic environment. The male missionaries were awkward in the presence of a highly educated woman and dismissive of her abilities, confining her to teaching the youngest pupils. She in turn was appalled at their treatment of Africans. After only six months she left, deeply disillusioned with mission work, and returned to Lovedale, where she opened a clinic.<br>
<br>By this time Jane Waterston's family had been left penniless after the failure of the Caledonian Bank in 1878; her brothers were unemployed and her mother and sisters unfitted to provide for themselves. She became the main breadwinner for her family. In 1883 she moved to Cape Town, where she remained for the rest of her life, living at 53 Grave Street. Although she was the only woman doctor in a country not noted for its enlightened attitude to women, she was accepted by the local medical profession. This was partly because of her tact and strength of character, and partly because she chose to practise among women, the poor of Cape Town, and the Xhosa dock labourers, whose language she spoke.<br>
<br>While she rejected emerging evolutionary theories and referred to Darwin as the &#145;ape-faced man&#146;, Waterston embraced modern developments in medicine wholeheartedly. In 1887 she returned to Britain to further her medical training. In 1888 she obtained the licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, and the degree of MD from Brussels University in June of that year. In July she was awarded the certificate in psychological medicine from the Medico Psychological Association of Great Britain, the first women to achieve this qualification. It is possible that mental difficulties in her own family prompted this interest, which she furthered in South Africa as a member of the boards of the mental asylums on Robben Island and at Valkenburg, the latter noted for its modern approach to mental illness. On her return to Cape Town she became an active member of the medical profession, acting as the president of the Cape of Good Hope (western) branch of the British Medical Association in 1905&#150;6. In her later years honours were showered upon her. In 1925 she was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, the second woman to achieve this honour, and in 1929 she was made an honorary doctor of laws by the University of Cape Town.<br>
<br>This recognition was due partly to Waterston's political activity. Although she never openly supported women's suffrage, she lived opposite the Cape houses of parliament and regularly attended sessions there. She lobbied vigorously for the protection of black education and increasingly, from the 1880s, the promotion of the British empire. This interest quickened through her close friendship with Edmund Garrett, editor of the <span class="italic">Cape Times</span>, who introduced her to Sir Alfred Milner when he arrived as governor of Cape Colony in 1898. During the South African War she organized relief for the Uitlander women and children who were deported to the coast from the Boer republics. The high regard in which Milner held her probably also explains why she was appointed to the Ladies Commission led by Millicent Garrett Fawcett, which had been established in 1901 to investigate the mortality of Boer women and children in the concentration camps set up by the British army as a result of the scorched earth policy. She has been regarded with opprobrium by Afrikaners for her contempt for the Boers, a consequence of their treatment of Africans, but she did her work well.<br>
<br>In her later years Waterston had a standing in Cape Town among people of all colours and when she died there on 7 November 1932 her funeral procession was one of the largest ever seen in the city.<br>
