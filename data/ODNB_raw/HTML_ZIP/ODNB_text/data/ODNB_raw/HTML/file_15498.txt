<span class="headword">Keyes <span class="st"> [Keys]</span>,  Roger</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1477), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was admitted to All Souls College, Oxford, as a legist in 1438 from Exeter diocese, and proceeded to the degree of BCnL. As warden from 1443 to 1445, in succession to the founding warden, Richard Andrewes, he was principally concerned with the building of the college, founded by Archbishop Henry Chichele in 1437, as Andrewes had been with concluding the legal arrangements to secure the college's endowments. Keyes's architectural involvement had begun earlier, in September 1441, when he succeeded the clerk John Druell as surveyor of the building works. In that post he was responsible for managing the workmen, overseeing the purchase of materials, co-ordinating work in the different building sites, and collecting and disbursing the necessary sums from Chichele's financial agents, to whom he had also to render accounts. Keyes accounted for the last quarter of 1441, through the following year, until December 1443. There is no reason to suppose that he would have had any particular say in the design of the college, although he has been described as its &#145;architect&#146;.<br>
<br>On 6 March 1454 Keyes was appointed rector of St Dunstan-in-the-East, London, and afterwards became also a canon of St Paul's, a canon of Salisbury, archdeacon of Barnstaple, and, by 1456, a canon and prebendary of Exeter. He was also appointed precentor of Exeter, a post he held until his death, and from September 1455 until April 1456 he was one of the keepers of the spiritualities of that see <i>sede vacante</i>.<br>
<br>In 1448 Keyes was appointed by Henry VI supervisor of the building of Eton College. For this he received a salary of &pound;50 a year. In 1452 he was appointed chaplain to the king, and for his service in the building of Eton was granted in the same year two stags annually from Dartmoor. In 1454 he and his brother Thomas received a grant of arms and patent of nobility. Keyes died on 11 November 1477 at Exeter and was buried there. He gave books both to All Souls College and to Exeter College (of which he had been appointed visitor in November 1442), and to All Souls vestments and vessels for use at the principal altar in the chapel.<br>
