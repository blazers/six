<span class="headword">Hill <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Smith]</span>,  Caroline  Southwood</span>  (1809&#150;1902), <span class="occ">writer and educationist</span>, was born on 21 March 1809, the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25917/', "Thomas Southwood Smith (1788&#150;1861)")</script>, Unitarian theologian, physician, and leading sanitary reformer, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Read, the daughter of a Bristol stoneware potter. On his wife's death in 1812, Southwood Smith left Caroline and her sister Emily with his family in Somerset while he pursued his medical studies in Edinburgh, but he later took the unconventional step of taking Caroline to live with him; a lasting emotional intimacy ensued. In 1818 Southwood Smith married Mary Christie (with whom he had one surviving child), and in 1819 or 1820 the family moved to London. Mary left Southwood Smith and emigrated to the continent in the mid-1820s.<br>
<br>Caroline Southwood Smith remained in Wimbledon in a private teaching post. By the 1830s she had begun to contribute articles to the Unitarian periodical the <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, often advocating the innovative theories of the Swiss educationist Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. She became governess to the children of James Hill (<i>d</i>. 1871), a former corn merchant and banker, who had requested to meet her after reading her articles. In 1835 Caroline married Hill at St Botolph without Bishopsgate in London, becoming his third wife. At their home in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, she threw herself into the work of her Owenite husband in initiating various co-operative ventures and seeking to end local corruption. They established a Pestalozzian infant school together, and Caroline Southwood Hill was also instrumental in the running of Hill's highly radical paper, the <span class="italic">Star in the East</span> (1836&#150;40). All this was in addition to caring for her six stepchildren and bearing three daughters, Miranda (<i>b</i>. 1836), Gertrude (<i>b</i>. 1837), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33873/', "Octavia Hill (1838&#150;1912)")</script>. Two more daughters, Emily (<i>b</i>. 1840) and Florence (<i>b</i>. 1843) were born after the family left Wisbech. Southwood Hill's unorthodox child-rearing methods became well known in radical circles: she shunned conventional discipline, seeking to instil in the children an ability to reason and a love of learning.<br>
<br>Major upheavals were to strike the Hill family: James Hill was declared bankrupt in 1840, and the children of his first marriage were taken in by members of his family. Southwood Hill and her children were greatly assisted by her father and their close friends the radical writer Mary Gillies and her sister Margaret Gillies, with whom Southwood Smith lived. They took in and brought up the young Gertrude (who later married Charles Lewes, son of the literary critic and partner of George Eliot, George Henry Lewes). The rest of the family moved from Essex to Hampstead, then to Gloucestershire, and on to Leeds, where in 1845 James Hill bought the Owenite publication the <span class="italic">New Moral World</span>. He suffered a nervous breakdown, and on medical advice decided to live apart from his family; he died alone in 1871. Caroline and her daughters moved to Finchley to be near her father.<br>
<br>Back in London, Southwood Hill continued to write. With the Gillies sisters, she moved in a radical circle which included such writers and reformers as William and Mary Howitt, William James Linton, and Eliza Cook. They championed progressive ideas on education, democracy, and women's emancipation. During the period from 1846 to 1851 the <span class="italic">People and Howitt's Journal</span> published much of her poetic work, and her articles on education were reissued as a book in 1845, <span class="italic">Memoranda of Observations and Experiments in Education</span>. In the early 1850s she and her daughters became involved in the Ladies' Guild, a women's craft workshop, of which Southwood Hill became manager. In 1856 she wrote an article for Charles Dickens's <span class="italic">Household Words</span> on the guild's work in training disadvantaged children in toy making. While the guild was not in itself economically successful, it became an important symbol for early feminist activists of a strategy for increasing women's employment opportunities. Southwood Hill was dismissed from the guild in 1855 after defending the right of F. D. Maurice, the Christian socialist (whose son later married her daughter Emily), to give <span class="roman">Bible</span> classes there.<br>
<br>Caroline Southwood Hill then moved to Weybridge with her daughter Emily and immersed herself in writing, but was back in London in 1859, sharing a house with Emily and Octavia, and teaching full-time once again. After sharing their house for a short, tense period with the pioneer in female medicine Sophia Jex-Blake, in 1862 Caroline, Emily, and Octavia established a school in Nottingham Place, London, which remained open until 1891, with first Octavia and later Miranda at its head. Southwood Hill acted as matron, although the school followed Octavia's more disciplinarian principals of education. Octavia Hill's burgeoning public career sometimes conflicted with her mother's ideals: for example, Octavia's volunteer cadet corps clashed with Caroline's pacifist philosophy.<br>
<br>A strong and influential character, Caroline Southwood Hill remained intellectually active throughout her long life. She wrote three children's books, and as late as 1895 was contributing reviews and articles to such publications as the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>. Octavia Hill published some of her mother's educational writings after her death as <span class="italic">Notes on Education</span> (1906). Southwood Hill and her family were always exceptionally close, and she continued to live with her daughters until her death at 6 Cambridge Terrace, St Pancras, London, on 31 December 1902. She was buried in Highgate cemetery.<br>
