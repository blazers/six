<span class="headword">Brawne <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Lindon]</span>,  Frances <span class="st"> [Fanny]</span></span>  (1800&#150;1865), <span class="occ">fianc&eacute;e of John Keats</span>, was born on 9 August 1800 in the West End of London, the first of five children of Samuel Vernon Brawne (1778&#150;1810), a businessman &#145;of no commercial reputation&#146;  (Motion, 324), and Frances (1772&#150;1829), daughter of John Ricketts. The main event in Fanny's life as far as posterity is concerned was her love affair with the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15229/', "John Keats (1795&#150;1821)")</script> from the time of the beginning of his <i>annus mirabilis</i> of autumn 1818 until his death in 1821.<br>
<br>Fanny Brawne came from a middle-class background and was reasonably well educated, at least in literature and languages, speaking French and undertaking translations from German. She first met Keats in the late autumn of 1818 in Hampstead and by June 1819 they had an &#145;understanding&#146; which, probably by October, had become an official, albeit secret, engagement. In view of Keats's poor financial situation and Fanny's youth, her mother disapproved of the affair. In fact, Fanny's mother was by no means the only person to disapprove of the relationship: Charles Brown apparently considered Fanny to be &#145;superficial and vain&#146; and &#145;flirtatious&#146; with &#145;every man she met&#146;  (Richardson, 31), and a number of other friends of Keats, including J. H. Reynolds and his family, Joseph Severn, and Charles Dilke, similarly regretted the attachment. For Keats, though, while he described Fanny in December 1818 as &#145;elegant, graceful, silly, fashionable and strange&#146;, &#145;monstrous&#146;, &#145;flying out in all directions&#146;, a &#145;<i>Minx</i>&#146; with a &#145;penchant &hellip; for acting stylishly&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Keats, 1814&#150;1821</span>, 2.8, 13), she was the &#145;one passion&#146; of his short life  (Houghton, 1), a passion which was to be characterized by an intensity of emotion which often slid into jealousy. When Keats's candid and passionate letters to Fanny were published in 1878, the insecurity and jealousy that they expressed, although evidence of a certain emotional instability on his part, none the less contributed to her reputation as a fickle and superficial lover of the increasingly famous poet. As her biographer notes, nineteenth-century commentators &#145;drew Fanny Brawne as they wanted her to be: a common, shallow, faithless, calculating flirt&#146;  (Richardson, 144), and her reputation was rescued only after the publication of her letters to Fanny Keats in 1936. Both Keats's sense of distrust and the ensuing disapproval were exacerbated by the poet's tuberculosis which, from the autumn of 1819 onwards, made him seem to be the helpless victim of Fanny's apparently wilful and unfaithful nature. Even when he was living next door to the Brawne family in Wentworth Place, Hampstead, the nature of Keats's illness often meant he found it distressing either to be with Fanny or to contemplate her being away from him. After he left for Italy in September 1820 he became so distressed by his feelings for Fanny that he was able neither to write directly to her nor read her letters to him. There seems to be little doubt that, fuelled by Keats's early death, the often painful emotions expressed in his letters to her, and the antagonism of his circle towards her, Fanny's influence on the poet was misrepresented as profoundly negative by a romanticizing later nineteenth century. In fact, it is significant that Keats wrote many of the poems for which he is most well known soon after meeting Fanny, and it is undoubtedly the case that his relationship with her was influential in the shaping of his greatest work.<br>
<br>After Keats's death, Fanny remained in Hampstead and mourned him through the 1820s, befriending his sister as she had promised him she would. After her mother's death in 1829 Fanny became financially independent and, on a visit to France in 1833, in Boulogne met Louis Lindo 
    (later Lindon; 1812&#150;1872)
  , whom she married on 15 June 1833. Of Spanish or Portuguese extraction and from a wealthy Jewish merchant and banking family, Louis Lindon seems to have held a number of positions, including working as an officer for the British Legion in Spain and as a wine merchant in London later in life. Until the 1850s, when they settled in London, the Lindons lived on the continent, especially in Germany, where they can be traced in D&uuml;sseldorf, Heidelberg, and Freiburg, and where Fanny gave birth to two sons and a daughter. Fanny died at 34 Coleshill Street, Pimlico, London, on 4 December 1865. She was buried in Brompton cemetery on 9 December.<br>
