<span class="headword">Butcher,  Samuel Henry</span>  (1850&#150;1910), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born in Dublin on 16 April 1850. His father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4176/', "Samuel Butcher (1811&#150;1876)")</script>, was then professor of ecclesiastical history at Trinity College. His mother was Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Leahy, from a Kerry family. His early years were spent in Dublin, or at Ballymoney, co. Cork, where his father held a college living, and after 1866, when his father became bishop of Meath, at Ardbraccan, near Navan. His only brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101351/', "John George Butcher (1851&#150;1935)")</script>, became a KC, Conservative MP for the city of York, and Baron Danesfort. The eldest of his four sisters, Elizabeth (1849&#150;1908), became Lady Monteagle. Butcher was educated at home until the age of fourteen, then at Marlborough College. His progress was rapid: in 1865 he won a senior scholarship. He also won many prizes for Latin and Greek composition, and ultimately became senior prefect. Later he acknowledged his debt to the teaching of George Granville Bradley, then headmaster. He was a fair cricketer, and football captain. In 1869 he won a classics open scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge, and began residence that autumn. His undergraduate career was an unbroken success. In 1870 he won the Bell scholarship, in 1871 the Waddington scholarship, in 1871 and 1872 the Powis medal. In 1873 he graduated senior classic, and was awarded a chancellor's medal. As an undergraduate he was the centre of a brilliant group of friends, and a member of the exclusive society, the Apostles. In 1874 he was elected fellow of Trinity.<br>
<br>After graduating Butcher was an assistant master at Eton (1873&#150;4). He then returned to Cambridge, as lecturer in classics at Trinity. There he might have remained, but for his engagement in 1875. Under the statutes, a fellowship was forfeited by marriage. Dr Bradley, master of University College, Oxford, offered him a tutorship there with a &#145;married&#146; fellowship attached. He therefore moved to Oxford, and in 1876 married Rose Julia (<i>d</i>. 1902), youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27702/', "Richard Chenevix Trench")</script>, archbishop of Dublin; the couple had no children. At Oxford his teaching rapidly made its mark. His scholarship, brilliant and solid, his enthusiasm, his interest in the matter as well as the language of his authors, made his lectures attractive and profitable. Among his pupils were J. W. Mackail, Cecil Spring-Rice, and others who later won distinction, and to whom he was friend as well as teacher. A university commission was appointed in 1877, and Butcher gained acquaintance with academic problems which was later useful to him. He actively supported female education, and was honorary secretary to the council of the Association for the Higher Education of Women at Oxford (1879&#150;82). He also began to distinguish himself as an author. In 1879 he published, with Andrew Lang, a translation of the <span class="italic">Odyssey</span> which was considered the most successful prose reproduction yet. In the same year Butcher published a small book on Demosthenes, giving the political context and the rhetorical methods of the orator.<br>
<br>These works, and his growing reputation as a scholar and teacher, gained Butcher, in 1882, the chair of Greek at Edinburgh University. He met at first some opposition as a non-Scot; but his charm and teaching ability soon overcame all obstacles. Popular among his students, with whom he was closer than was usual in Scottish universities, he soon gained a leading position in the senatus. In 1889 the <span class="roman">Scottish Universities Bill</span> became law; and a royal commission was nominated to draw up new statutes and reform the Scottish university system. Its chairman was Lord Kinnear, and Butcher was chosen to represent the professors. The work of the commission, an executive not advisory body, was difficult and onerous. The commissioners had to draw up for all the four Scottish universities not only statutes but ordinances or regulations, and the constitutions of the universities had to be harmonized and, so far as possible, made identical. This laborious task lasted nearly eleven years, during which the commission held 251 meetings. Its general report was not issued until April 1900. It was generally recognized by the commissioners and by the academic body that Butcher's experience, industry, and tact were of great value in achieving a beneficent, far-reaching reform.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Butcher took an active part in Edinburgh society; and his house, with his wife's conversational powers, became a brilliant social centre. Among his closest friends were Professor and Mrs W. Sellar. In 1891 Butcher published a volume of essays and addresses, <span class="italic">Some Aspects of the Greek Genius</span>, on the nature of the Greek mind. The most notable essay was that on Aristotle's conception of fine art and poetry, the germ from which grew Butcher's most important work, <span class="italic">Aristotle's Theory of Poetry and Fine Art</span> (1895).<br>
<br>At Edinburgh, Butcher was first drawn into politics. Of liberal views but strong conservative instincts, during the Irish home-rule controversy, he took a leading role in organizing the Unionist Party in Edinburgh. When, with Gladstone's return to power in 1892, the home-rule threat reappeared, he actively promoted the election of his friend Lord Wolmer (later second earl of Selborne) for West Edinburgh.<br>
<br>In 1902 Rose Butcher died after a brief illness. This loosened his ties to Edinburgh; and, having held his professorship long enough for a pension, Butcher resigned in 1903. A. J. Balfour presided at his farewell dinner in January 1904. He moved to London, residing the rest of his life at 6 Tavistock Square. In 1904 he lectured at Harvard and elsewhere in the United States, and published <span class="italic">Harvard Lectures on Greek Subjects</span> (1904), a sort of sequel to <span class="italic">Some Aspects of the Greek Genius</span>. He worked on a critical edition of Demosthenes' speeches, two volumes of which were published (1903, 1907), and in improving successive editions of the <span class="italic">Poetics</span>.<br>
<br>Before leaving Edinburgh, Butcher had been appointed to the royal commission on university education in Ireland (1901), of which Lord Robertson was chairman. In its discussions Butcher took a prominent part. Believing in the justice of the Roman Catholic demands, he aimed at satisfying the Catholic authorities without infringing the independence of Trinity College. He therefore aided the chairman in excluding it from the discussion, while doing his utmost to elicit the exact views of Catholic witnesses as to the extent of ecclesiastical control which they considered advisable. He also tried to secure the attendance of the Maynooth students in the new university. When in 1903 the report appeared, it was accompanied by eight &#145;reservations&#146;; and the chairman himself dissented. The report produced no result.<br>
<br>Another royal commission was appointed on the same subject in June 1906. Sir Edward Fry was chairman. Butcher was the only person who served on both royal commissions. This time, Trinity College was expressly included, and its financial and other conditions were carefully examined; but in their report (January 1907) the commissioners declared that, in their opinion, it was impossible to make that foundation available for the higher education of Catholics. They therefore recommended the establishment in Dublin of a separate college. When Augustine Birrell's bill for the creation of a new university was introduced in parliament (31 March 1908), Butcher opposed the granting of indefinite powers of affiliation to the senate, but in vain. Although the scheme differed in many ways from what he wanted, he accepted membership of the senate of the new university, and took an active part in its proceedings.<br>
<br>In 1906, on the death of his old friend Sir Richard Jebb, Butcher became Conservative MP for Cambridge University. His first speech was on the <span class="roman">Irish University Bill</span>; an impassioned appeal to substitute for the existing royal university a real teaching university where the Catholic Irish layman could obtain the education he desired. Butcher seldom spoke in the Commons, and mostly on educational and Irish questions. In addition to his classical works, he published speeches on Ireland.<br>
<br>In 1903 Butcher had been a principal founder of the English Classical Association. He was chairman of its council from then on, and president in 1907. He was instrumental in bringing about, through the association, a reform of Latin pronunciation. He was also the first president of the Irish Classical Association. He was a prominent member of the Hellenic Society and the committee for the British School at Athens. He opposed the abolition of compulsory Greek at the older universities, but was willing to make concessions for students specializing in other subjects. When the British Academy was founded in 1902, he was one of its original fellows, and became president in 1909. In July 1908 he was appointed a British Museum trustee, and six months later a member of its standing committee. He was continually consulted on educational questions and appointments. He received honorary degrees from Oxford, Dublin, St Andrews, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, and Harvard. He was a corresponding member of the American Academy. In 1910 he received the Greek order of the Redeemer. He was an honorary fellow of University College, Oxford, and Trinity College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>Of middle height, well but rather slightly built, Butcher was considered handsome. His eyes were large, of a deep brown, and very brilliant. His hair was black and abundant, later slightly grizzled. His conversation was fluent, vivacious, and energetic, but playful as well as vigorous, argumentative on occasion, but never overbearing. Generous to others, he was capable of fiery indignation against public or private wrongs. He had a strong sense of humour, delighting especially in the wit of his countrymen.<br>
<br>Butcher's varied labours eventually harmed his health. Although naturally somewhat delicate, he generally appeared healthy. He spent the summer vacation of 1910 at Danesfort, near Killarney, on a little property inherited from his father, where he loved to spend his holidays. In October he had an attack of internal haemorrhage, which led to suffusion of blood on the brain. He died in a nursing home, 7 Mandeville Place, Marylebone, London, on 29 December 1910, and was buried in the Dean cemetery, Edinburgh, beside his wife.<br>
