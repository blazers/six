<span class="headword">Poe,  Leonard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1631), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was the son of James Poe and grandson of Richard Poe, of Poesfeld, Derbyshire. The Poes were substantial yeomen from Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire and do not appear to have originated in the Rhenish palatinate, as some have suggested. Leonard Poe, identified in the annals of the Royal College of Physicians as a deacon of Lincoln, took up medicine after being sequestered as a puritan. Despite his background, Poe was licensed by the office of the archbishop of Canterbury to practise medicine, which he did in London beginning in 1587.<br>
<br>From 1589 Poe made numerous appearances before the College of Physicians for unlicensed practice and malpractice. Examinations at the college revealed that he knew neither Greek nor Latin and had no familiarity with academic medicine. This lack of formal knowledge did not prevent him, however, from winning the confidence of a fashionable clientele, or of many others who readily became his patients. Chief among these was the earl of Essex, whose service Poe was in, in 1590. Essex also supported him before the college in 1592, 1594, and 1595, finally winning from it, on 13 July 1596, a restricted medical licence for Poe. He was thereby permitted to treat venereal, cutaneous, and calculous diseases, gout, and simple tertian ague, though he was required to call for the assistance of a member of the college when treating other fevers and severe diseases. Even though he carried a letter of protection signed by seven members of the privy council, including Essex, Poe's troubles with the college continued and reached a head on 30 June 1598, when some younger fellows, including Thomas Moundeford and William Paddy, secured orders for his imprisonment and the revocation of his licence. But once again a settlement was agreed, with the compromise of all parties.<br>
<br>Essex's death in 1601 did not end Poe's aristocratic patronage. On 11 December 1606, at the suggestion of the earls of Suffolk, Northampton, and Salisbury, all restrictions on his licence were removed. On 12 January 1609 he was made ordinary physician of the king's household, and on 7 July of the same year the persistent influence of his aristocratic patrons, who now also included the earl of Worcester, led to his election as fellow of the College of Physicians. In April 1612 he was one of three physicians in attendance on Lord Treasurer Salisbury, and was present at his death on 24 May. Salisbury's high regard for Poe, whose hand he clasped as he died, increased Poe's respectability. He obtained his MD from Cambridge University by mandate in 1615.<br>
<br>Poe's tenure at the college was calm throughout. In 1616 he gave what was called a &#145;splendid feast&#146; at the college, for the fellows and their wives. On 6 June 1625 he attended the death of Orlando Gibbons, the composer, and carried out the post-mortem. In 1629 he was referred to as &#145;one of her Majesty's doctors in physic for the most part residing at Court&#146;. He died in the parish of Christ Church, in the City of London, on 4 April 1631; his will of the same year  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/159, sig. 37) identified him as a physician-in-ordinary to Charles I.<br>
<br>Poe was married to Dionisia Boone of Sussex; they had three sons and six daughters. His eldest son, Leonard, suffered from mental illness. His youngest son, Theophilus, who matriculated at Oxford in 1624, was considered a wastrel by his father. His second son, James Poe, retained his trust and was made sole executor of his will. One of the doctor's daughters, Susanna, married the puritan physician John Bastwick, and carried away her husband's ears in 1637, after his mutilation on the orders of the court of Star Chamber. Her younger sister, Judith, also married a physician, Thomas Grent, a fellow of the College of Physicians, who doubtless benefited from his father-in-law's position to become physician-in-ordinary to James I.<br>
