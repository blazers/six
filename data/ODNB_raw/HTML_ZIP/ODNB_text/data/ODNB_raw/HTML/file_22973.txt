<span class="headword">Radcliffe,  Alexander</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1653, <em>d.</em> in or before 1696), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was probably born in the Southern Netherlands, the only son of the exiled royalist Alexander Radcliffe (1633&#150;1682), later of Hampstead, Middlesex. His father and grandfather both fought with the royalist forces during the civil war and the family estate was much reduced by sequestration. Radcliffe's father remained in exile between 1651 and 1660.<br>
<br>Radcliffe was admitted to Gray's Inn on 12 November 1669, but, like a number of gentlemen at the inns of court, never practised law. His association with Gray's Inn continued at least until 1681, when he was one of the self-styled &#145;truely loyall gentlemen&#146; of Gray's Inn who, &#145;in a tumultuous manner&#146;, climbing on tables and throwing their hats in the air, sought to move a declaration in support of Charles II's dissolution of parliament (Luttrell, 1.99; <span class="italic">Works</span>, vii). Radcliffe treats this incident in his poem &#145;The Lawyers Demurrer Argued&#146;, where he characterizes his opponents as:<blockquote>
<div>a parcell of <i>Whiggs</i>,<br>
</div>
<div>The Spawn of some <i>Rebells</i>
<br>
</div>
</blockquote>who had the &#145;Impudence&#146; to claim that &#145;Giving Thanks to the King was judg'd an affray&#146;  (A. Radcliffe, <span class="italic">The Ramble</span>, 1682, 110&#150;15).<br>
<br>In March 1672 Radcliffe acquired a captaincy in Colonel John Fitzgerald's regiment of foot, and was generally known thereafter as Captain Radcliffe. He had a reputation as bon viveur and rake, and his poems &#145;The Ramble&#146; and &#145;A Call to the Guard by a Drum&#146; were included in Rochester's <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> (1680). A substantial number of his poems are parodies and lampoons, including <span class="italic">Ovid Travestie</span> (1680, 2nd edn, expanded from five to fifteen poems, 1681), with its parodied versions of translations of the <span class="italic">Heroides</span> by Dryden and others in <span class="italic">Ovid's Epistles, Translated by Several Hands</span> (1680). <span class="italic">The Ramble: an Anti-Heroick Poem. Together with some Terrestrial Hymns and Carnal Ejaculations</span> (including among its contents several &#145;songs burlesqued and varied&#146;) was published in 1682 and reprinted, together with <span class="italic">Ovid Travestie</span>, in <span class="italic">Works</span> (1696). <span class="italic">Bacchinalia coelestia: a Poem in Praise of Punch</span> was published as a broadside in 1680. Radcliffe is primarily a comic poet, whose poems are crude, energetic, and conventional in their attitudes, with none of the complexity of Rochester; &#145;The Ramble&#146; contains some sharp touches of social satire. The date of Radcliffe's death is unknown, but in 1696 he is described as &#145;late of Grayes Inn&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, viii).<br>
