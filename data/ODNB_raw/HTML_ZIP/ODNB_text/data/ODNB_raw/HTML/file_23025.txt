<span class="headword">Raines,  Francis Robert</span>  (1805&#150;1878), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, the descendant of an old Yorkshire family, third son of Isaac Raines MD, of Burton Pidsea in Holderness, and his wife, Ann, daughter of Joseph Robertson, was born at Whitby, Yorkshire, on 22 February 1805. He received his early education privately at Burton Pidsea, but at the age of thirteen was sent to Clitheroe, Lancashire, as apprentice to William Coultate, a surgeon, who afterwards moved to Burnley. During his apprenticeship Raines went to the Clitheroe and Burnley grammar schools. He later decided to enter the church, and in 1826 was admitted to St Bees Theological College in Cumberland. In 1828 he became assistant curate of Saddleworth on the Lancashire and Yorkshire border, and in 1829 was ordained and took the curacy at Rochdale parish church. In 1832 the vicar of Rochdale appointed him perpetual curate of the chapelry of St James, Milnrow. On 21 November 1836 he married Honora Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Major John Beswicke of Pike House, Littleborough, near Rochdale. They had three daughters.<br>
<br>Raines remained at Milnrow for the rest of his life, rebuilding the church there and providing schools and a parsonage. The earl of Dunmore appointed him his domestic chaplain in 1841, and in 1845 the archbishop of Canterbury awarded him an MA. He was rural dean of Rochdale from 1846 to 1877, and an honorary canon of Manchester Cathedral from 1849. On 30 March 1843 he was elected FSA. In the same year he was one of the founders, with Edward Holme, James Crossley, Richard Parkinson, and others, of the Chetham Society. He served from the first on the council, and succeeded Parkinson as vice-president in 1858. He was one of the most prominent nineteenth-century local historians in north-west England, an authority on genealogy, manorial and ecclesiastical history, and the documentary sources for the subject.<br>
<br>Raines was by far the most prolific of all the many authors and editors employed by the Chetham Society, and the quantity and scope of his work has remained unsurpassed. He was a careful and thorough antiquarian&#150;historian, working so quickly and efficiently that the society relied heavily upon him to maintain a regular flow of publications. Between 1844 and 1878 he edited eighteen volumes and contributed eleven sections to the various Chetham miscellanies. A further eight volumes which he had partly completed were finished by others and published posthumously. The breadth of his interests was exceptionally wide, with works ranging from the 1845 edition of Bishop Gastrell's <span class="italic">Notitia Cestriensis</span>, a key source for the pre-1720 diocesan and educational history of Lancashire and Cheshire, through visitation returns, and detailed biographies of the rectors and wardens of Manchester and the vicars of Rochdale, to the delightful and always rewarding heavily annotated edition (1848) of the early seventeenth-century journal of Nicholas Assheton.<br>
<br>At the same time Raines was building up a remarkable collection of original manuscript material and detailed transcripts, which he housed in forty-four large volumes. On his death these, and his abundant correspondence with historians and antiquarians throughout the country, were given to Chetham's Library, Manchester, where they are now housed. This major collection of local history material is of particular importance in its coverage of the Rochdale area, but is Lancashire-wide in its scope. Other Raines material is held by the Archives and Local Studies department of Manchester Central Library.<br>
<br>Raines died after a short illness at Scarborough on 17 October 1878, survived by his wife; he was buried in Milnrow churchyard. A memorial was later erected to him in the church.<br>
