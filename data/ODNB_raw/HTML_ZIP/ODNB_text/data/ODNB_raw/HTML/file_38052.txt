<span class="headword">Taylor,  (James) Hudson</span>  (1832&#150;1905), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born in Barnsley, Yorkshire, on 21 May 1832, the eldest of the five children (two sons and three daughters, one son and one daughter dying in childhood) of James Taylor, chemist and Wesleyan local preacher, and his wife Amelia, daughter of the Revd Benjamin Brook Hudson, Wesleyan minister. Taylor was educated at home and at a private day school, and as apprentice to his father. At fifteen he worked in a bank to learn accountancy, until his eyesight gave trouble. In June 1849, aged seventeen, he underwent an evangelical conversion and determined to bring the Christian gospel to the Chinese, although inland China was closed to foreigners. He began medical training, first in the slums of Hull, and then at the London Hospital, but sailed unqualified as first agent of the new Chinese Evangelization Society. He landed in Shanghai on 1 March 1854.<br>
<br>In 1855, to the disgust of established missionaries, Taylor adopted Chinese dress and a pigtail. Inland travel and preaching became easier at once, though he had hair-raising adventures and was not naturally brave. Meanwhile his society's inefficiency left him destitute. He severed connections. Following the example of the preacher and philanthropist George M&uuml;ller and applying his own highly original survival training in Hull, he lived by the principles of faith and prayer on which he later built his mission: never appealing for funds except to God, and administering all gifts with scrupulous stewardship. In 1858, at Ningbo, he married Maria Jane (<i>d</i>. 1870), orphaned daughter of the Revd Samuel Dyer, missionary in Singapore. They had five sons and three daughters. Ill health drove Taylor back to England in 1860 and in 1862 he qualified MRCS and in midwifery.<br>
<br>The treaty of Nanjing had opened the interior of China, but no existing mission had accepted the challenge. Taylor therefore published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">China: its Spiritual Need and Claims</span>, and founded the undenominational China Inland Mission in 1865, praying for twenty-four &#145;willing, skilful labourers&#146;, two symbolically for each province. In 1866 the Taylors took their children and most of their twenty-four workers to Shanghai. The China Inland Mission's early years inland were hazardous, with riots, some internal dissension, and opposition from established missionaries, who especially objected to the use of Chinese dress. Despite sickness and discouragement Taylor persevered and every province was penetrated. Maria Hudson died in childbirth at Zhenjiang in July 1870. On 14 November 1871, in London, Taylor married her best friend and fellow missionary, Jane Elizabeth 
    (Jennie; 1842/3&#150;1904)
  , daughter of Joseph William F. Faulding, fret-cutter and piano-frame maker of St Pancras. They had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>At home, Taylor's writings and dramatic appeals stirred the churches: among volunteers who responded was the celebrated C. T. Studd in 1885. Taylor promoted all missions, and believed that the surest way to help the East was to deepen spirituality in the West. The mission now grew rapidly until by 1895 Taylor was directing nearly half the protestant force in China. He was ahead of his time in identification with the people, working towards indigenous leadership. He also took a strong part in famine relief and the campaign to abolish the British opium trade to China. In the Boxer uprising (1899&#150;1901) a total of seventy-nine China Inland Mission missionaries and children were killed. Taylor refused compensation, to the amazement of the mandarins, who issued proclamations applauding the spirit of the Christians. He retired as general director of the mission in 1902.<br>
<br>Taylor, who had a strong sense of humour, was small, sandy-haired, musical, and affectionate. His example and strategies, his integrity, saintliness, courage, and originality had a lasting influence on Christian missions worldwide. The fast-growing, and later wholly indigenous, protestant church in China owed more to him than to any other foreigner. He died on 3 June 1905 at Changsha, Hunan, China.<br>
