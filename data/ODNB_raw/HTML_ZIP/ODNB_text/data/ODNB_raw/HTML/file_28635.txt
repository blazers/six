<span class="headword">Walter, Sir  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1565, <em>d.</em> 1630), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was baptized at Ludlow, Shropshire, on 1 May 1565, the second son of the common lawyer and Welsh judge Edmund Walter (<i>d</i>. 1592), of Ludlow, and his wife, Mary Hackluit (<i>d</i>. 1583). After matriculating from Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1579, John followed his elder brother, James, to the Inner Temple, where he was admitted gratis as a bencher's son on 21 April 1583. Called to the bar by the Inner Temple parliament on 22 November 1590, Walter took his place at the bar table on 6 June next year, and served as reader of Lyon's Inn in 1595.<br>
<br>The details of Walter's immediate professional ascent are scanty, but by 1600 he was pleading in Star Chamber, admittedly as the junior of three counsel  (Baildon, 116). On 24 February 1601 he married Margaret Offley (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1620) of London, with whom he would rear a family of four sons and four daughters. By 1604 Walter had entered Queen Anne's service as a fee'd counsellor at law. His call to join the bench of the Inner Temple in 1605 came a good five years earlier than strict seniority and the average continuance of those so promoted over the previous decade would predict, while his reading in the summer of 1607 on the statute 43 Eliz. I c.1 (confirmations of patents) was sufficiently well received for a fellow practitioner on the Oxford circuit to characterize him as &#145;a reader of great reputation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liber famelicus</span>, 31). As &#145;worthy Counsellor&#146; to the University of Oxford Walter advised Sir Thomas Bodley on his founding endowment of the university's library, and in 1609 refused a fee for drafting the deed of grant  (Wood, 2.912); the following year he was retained by the crown to defend the royal title to aulnage before the House of Lords. In 1613 Walter became attorney-general to the prince of Wales, and received an honorary MA from the University of Oxford. By 1615, when he bought the widowed Lady Cope's substantial house in the Strand  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 1.594), Walter was among the leaders of the Westminster bar, even in chancery, where his closeness to Sir Edward Coke may not have facilitated his practice. Having previously acquired a house and lands in the north Oxfordshire parish of Sarsden, Walter next year bought the former abbey of Godstow and the manor of Wolvercote outside Oxford, which became his main residence. At this time &#145;in regard of his good deserts and experience in the government of the house&#146;  (<span class="italic">Inner Temple Records</span>, 2.100), Walter's Inner Temple colleagues agreed to seat him at the head of the bench table in hall.<br>
<br>Yet high professional standing was in itself insufficient to guarantee further preferment. Although &#145;all the world had destinated&#146; Walter to succeed Henry Yelverton as solicitor-general in 1617  (<span class="italic">Liber famelicus</span>, 54) the office went instead to his Inner Temple junior Thomas Coventry, a mere &#145;green reader&#146;  (ibid., 53). Next year's closely fought election for the recordership of London saw Walter nominated in place of his &#145;verye good friend&#146; Whitelocke  (ibid., 31), once the king himself had declared the latter unacceptable. In these circumstances his narrow defeat was no disgrace, and the knighthood conferred on Walter in May 1619 can hardly have been a consolation prize, especially since two more of the prince's legal officers received the same honour. His notably forceful stance against monopolists and projectors in the parliament of 1621, where he sat as member for the Cornish borough of East Looe, may however reflect Walter's continuing distance from court power and patronage. If so, when he was next returned for the same constituency on Prince Charles's nomination in 1624, that gap had much narrowed, as Walter now urged his fellow members to send military support to their distressed protestant brethren abroad by voting the crown at least four subsidies.<br>
<br>During the vacation after Hilary term 1625, in the last month of James I's life, Walter and Sir Thomas Trevor, the prince's solicitor-general, both received writs to be called serjeant immediately, along with patents as king's serjeants. This irregular procedure of swearing in serjeants during vacation was possibly part of a plan to make Walter the fifth justice of king's bench, a promotion he apparently did not welcome, since it would reduce the fee income of all puisne justices. That potential difficulty was resolved in April by Sir Robert Tanfield's death, enabling Walter to be made chief baron of the exchequer. Meanwhile a judicial conference reinstated the traditional process for calling serjeants, with writs returnable on the first day of Easter term; in Walter's case his patrons were Lord Keeper Williams, Buckingham, Pembroke, and Baron Ley  (Baker, <span class="italic">Serjeants</span>, 358&#150;9, 438). On 12 May the lord keeper finally administered Walter's oath as chief baron, &#145;and his response was good, grave, and full of honesty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Sir Richard Hutton</span>, 58).<br>
<br>The gravity contemporaries deemed particularly fitting to his office epitomized Walter's judicial demeanour; when a colleague on the western circuit remarked &#145;My Lord, you are not merry&#146;, Walter supposedly replied &#145;Merry enough, for a judge&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, new edn, 1840, 3.62). Yet despite a rumour in January 1626 that Walter would succeed the recently deceased Sir Henry Hobart as chief justice of common pleas, the position remained unfilled until late November, when it went to the more pliant Thomas Richardson. Whatever the truth of that rumour, Walter's chances of further promotion were irretrievably damaged by his prominent role in the judges' resistance to government attempts from mid-October to secure their collective endorsement of the forced loan. Walter was one of the trio who represented the judiciary in negotiations with Lord Keeper Coventry. These culminated in Chief Justice Crewe's dismissal after a personal interview with Charles I, who then summoned Walter: &#145;and much passed between them and again the Chief Baron was constant and would not change&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Sir Richard Hutton</span>, 66).<br>
<br>On this and later occasions Walter was protected by his patent, which gave him tenure during good behaviour, and he continued to discharge his duties, including attendance on Lords' committees during the 1628 parliament. The illness which excused him from judicial consultations on the king's questions in May of that year was possibly genuine, since in January sickness also prevented his sitting in Westminster Hall. The same reason was given for his absence in May 1629, when the judges faced further royal enquiries touching the habeas corpus applications of the imprisoned MPs. But while the crown could hardly complain at the handling of Richard Chambers's suits against tonnage and poundage by Walter's court that June, at the beginning of Michaelmas term he was pressed to resign his place. Walter now apparently constituted the main individual obstacle to Charles's preferred handling of sensitive politico-legal issues and, according to Bulstrode Whitelocke, &#145;His Opinion was contrary to all the rest of the Judges&#146;  (Whitelocke, <span class="italic">Memorials</span>, 16). His refusal to step aside, since, &#145;as he often affirmed, he had never given any cause of offence to the king in any matter that he knew of&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Sir Richard Hutton</span>, 83). led the king on 22 October to suspend him from exercising his office.<br>
<br>Walter's continued insistence on knowing the cause of royal displeasure ensured that disablement continued throughout the final year of his life. He died well prepared at Serjeants' Inn, Fleet Street, on 18 November 1630 and was buried at Wolvercote. This &#145;grave, religious man, of great learning, sound judgment and good conscience&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Sir Richard Hutton</span>, 83) left large benefactions to Jesus College, Oxford, to his second wife, Anne Biggs (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Wytham), whom he had married on 18 July 1622, and to the surviving children of his first marriage. Several manuscript collections of his law reports and notes taken at his Inner Temple reading survive; his name is also attached to a printed abridgement of Plowden's <span class="italic">Commentaries</span> (1659).<br>
