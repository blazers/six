<span class="headword">Jackson,  Joseph Devonsher</span>  (1783&#150;1857), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was born in Cork on 23 June 1783, the eldest son of Strettel Jackson of Peterborough, Cork, a prosperous carrier, and his wife, Mary Cossens. His father was a descendant of an English family which had settled in Ireland in the early seventeenth century. Jackson's early education in Cork was at the hands of the Revd Mr Lee, an evangelical clergyman of the Church of Ireland. After matriculating at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1800, the protestant tradition of his boyhood was reinforced by his tutor Arthur H. Kenney, later rector of St Olave's, Southwark. He graduated BA with honours in 1806. In 1832 he proceeded AM and in 1835 became a Cambridge MA.<br>
<br>Jackson entered as a student of law in the King's Inns, Dublin, in 1803 and in the Middle Temple, London, the following year. In 1806 he was called to the Irish bar, and he took silk twenty years later. Initially attached to the Munster circuit, he was known as a zealous advocate and &#145;an amiable man, of courteous manners, and prepossessing appearance, with a fine forensic countenance&#146;  (Madden, 260). Although he lacked the wit, pathos, or imagination traditionally associated with distinguished advocates of the Irish bar, his scrupulous fair dealing and evangelical propensities led Hugh Percy, third duke of Northumberland, to appoint him chairman of the Londonderry quarter sessions in 1830. Service as a private in Westropp's grenadiers and membership of Hardinge's Orange lodge assured his acceptance by the Conservative establishment.<br>
<br>In 1811 Jackson married Sarah Lucinda (<i>d</i>. 1858), ninth daughter of Benjamin Clarke of Cullenswood, Dublin. In 1812 he was co-opted to the committee of the Kildare Place Society, established in 1811, where, as secretary, he strengthened the protestant influence. He gave detailed evidence in 1824&#150;5 before the commissioners of the Irish education inquiry.<br>
<br>The borough of Bandon was reputed to have the most sectarian electorate in co. Cork, and in 1835 Jackson contested it as a Conservative, winning easily then and again in 1837. In 1841 he was returned unopposed for the borough, and a year later he became one of the members for Dublin University. Success in politics led to professional advancement. In 1835 he was the third serjeant-at-law in Ireland and, shortly afterwards, second serjeant. In 1841 he was named solicitor-general and, on the death of John Leslie Foster in 1842, justice of the common pleas. He accepted the Chiltern Hundreds in September 1842.<br>
<br>Variously dubbed a &#145;biblical barrister&#146; and a &#145;scriptural tory&#146;, Jackson's parliamentary interventions were largely confined to representing Irish loyalist interests. In 1837 he spoke for nearly four hours against the introduction of the <span class="roman">Irish Corporation Reform Bill</span>, which did not pass until 1840. Thoughtful and trenchant, his prolix arguments could often be tiresome, although Thomas Babington Macaulay thought his attack on the national board system, in the first debate on the issue when Sir Robert Peel came to power in 1841, led to &#145;the very best parliamentary set-to between the secretary and the solicitor-general for Ireland which has ever been witnessed&#146;.<br>
<br>Jackson died at his home, Sutton House, Howth, co. Dublin, on 20 December 1857 and was interred there in St Fintan's cemetery.<br>
