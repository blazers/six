<span class="headword">Sharpe, Sir  Alfred</span>  (1853&#150;1935), <span class="occ">colonial governor and big game hunter</span>, was born on 19 May 1853 at Quarry Hill, Lancaster, the third son and youngest of the five children of Edmund Sharpe (1809&#150;1877), architect, local government representative, and railway engineer, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1876), daughter of Colonel Ralph Fletcher of Bolton-le-Moors. His early education in Switzerland and France was followed by Haileybury College from 1867 to 1870. He then studied law and was admitted as a solicitor in 1876 at Westminster. On 19 April 1881 he married Rosamund Bolling, daughter of Edward James Bolling, vicar of Leverbridge, Lancashire.<br>
<br>In 1883 Sharpe moved with his wife and their young son, Edmund, to Fiji, where he and his cousin purchased large areas of freehold and leasehold land on which they began to grow sugar cane. The enterprise failed, his cousin departed for Australia, and Sharpe secured a temporary post locally as stipendiary magistrate which was terminated in 1885. His wife left for England where she gave birth to their second son, Reginald, and Sharpe went to Africa. Declining an appointment as district commissioner in the Gold Coast, he instead took up hunting in central Africa, where, between 1887 (when his third son, Maurice, was born) and 1892 he established himself as one of Africa's most renowned big game hunters. He took part with Lugard in fighting the Arab slave traders at the north end of Lake Malawi and then returned to hunt in southern British Central Africa, where in July 1889 he met Harry Johnston, the new British consul in that country. Johnston, recognizing Sharpe's ability, persuaded him to undertake expeditions on behalf of the British South Africa Company, and between them they negotiated treaties with local leaders in the Lake Malawi area to ensure that they did not cede their land to other countries, principally Portugal. Sharpe notably failed, however, to secure a treaty with Msiri, the powerful chief of Katanga.<br>
<br>In February 1891 Johnston was appointed commissioner and consul-general of British Central Africa, over which Britain now declared a protectorate. The following month he appointed Sharpe as his vice-consul and there followed five years of intense activity, setting up the machinery of government in the new protectorate. With his knowledge of the country and its main languages, legal training, and (albeit limited) business experience, he was invaluable to Johnston. Together they settled land claims, with the purpose of protecting African rights while encouraging European agricultural development, and securing crown rights so that some of the profits of development could accrue to the government. Together, too, they virtually brought an end to the slave trade (including by successful military action against the Yao chieftaincies) and created the basic machinery of government, setting out a taxation system, developing the basic road infrastructure, and creating embryo departments of state: military, postal, judicial, public works, and district administration. Sharpe was promoted consul in 1894, acted as commissioner when Johnston was on leave, was appointed deputy commissioner on his return, and succeeded him on his departure in 1897. He remained commissioner until 1907, for the first seven years employed by the Foreign Office, and for the last three by the Colonial Office.<br>
<br>Sharpe's main tasks during his period as head of government were to improve the quality and remuneration of his administrative officials; continue the expansion of the machinery of government; bring more of the country, especially the northern parts, under effective administrative control (which he achieved by means of a peaceful accommodation with the northern Ngoni, in contrast to Johnston's more forceful methods); draft laws on a wide variety of topics; regulate labour both internally and externally through emigration from the country to southern Africa, including the mines; encourage the building of a railway in the southern part of the country to link the agricultural areas of the Shire highlands to the lower Shire River, which was the principal means of transportation into and out of the country; and encourage agricultural expansion and exports, particularly of cotton, tobacco, and tea.<br>
<br>Sharpe was appointed CB in 1897 and knighted KCMG in 1903. He helped to draft the Nyasaland order in council of 1907, which changed the name of the country from British Central Africa to Nyasaland and changed his title from commissioner to governor and commander-in-chief. Executive and legislative councils were also created under his presidency. He left Nyasaland on retirement in March 1910, was made an honorary LLD of Edinburgh University in 1911, and spent the following years writing and travelling. He published <span class="italic">The Backbone of Africa</span> (1921) and thirty journal articles, including twenty-two in the <span class="italic">Geographical Journal</span>. He was credited with explaining correctly the cyclical nature of the water levels of Lake Nyasa and the Shire River, which had baffled earlier observers (and led, inter alia, to a costly diversion of the railway from Blantyre to the lake, for fear that it would be flooded). His travelling, frequently by rail or on foot or bicycle, and often combined with hunting, took him to the Congo, north-eastern Rhodesia, German East Africa, Uganda, Egypt, and Liberia. He died of heart failure at his home, 16B Trebovir Road, South Kensington, London, on 10 December 1935 and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 13 December.<br>
<br>Sharpe was a modest, fearless, solitary man, who was far more comfortable in the bush than in an office. His accomplishments were those of both a great hunter and an outstanding administrator who played a vital part in the early government and development of Nyasaland.<br>
