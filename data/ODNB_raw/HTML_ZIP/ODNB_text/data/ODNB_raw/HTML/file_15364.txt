<span class="headword">Kennedy,  Charles Rann</span>  (1808&#150;1867), <span class="occ">lawyer and classical scholar</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15390/', "Rann Kennedy (1772&#150;1851)")</script>, a poet, and his wife, Julia, daughter of the historical engraver John Hall. He was the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15363/', "Benjamin Hall Kennedy")</script>. He was educated at Shrewsbury School and at King Edward VI School, Birmingham, before matriculating as an exhibitioner at Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1827. He was a talented student and won several prizes and scholarships. In 1831 he graduated BA as a senior classicist, and was elected a fellow of Trinity; he proceeded MA in 1834. On 5 February 1835 Kennedy was admitted at Lincoln's Inn. He was called to the bar on 19 November 1836. At first he practised in London and took part in the significant libel actions brought by John Stockdale against Hansard between 1836 and 1840. In connection with this case he published <span class="italic">The Privileges of the House of Commons</span> (second edition, 1841). In the autumn of 1849 he was elected professor of law in Queen's College, Birmingham, and he asked to join the midland circuit. Unusually, this request was refused, leading Kennedy to publish in 1850 an open letter to the lord chancellor, complaining of the conduct of the circuit leagues. In May 1856 Kennedy became the professional adviser of Mrs Swinfen, the plaintiff in the case of <i>Swinfen v. Swinfen</i>, and carried the litigation to a successful conclusion. A dispute, however, arose as to his payment, and on 26 March 1862 he brought an action against Mrs Swinfen for &pound;20,000. Kennedy won in the first instance but this result was overruled in the court of common pleas, the judges holding that a barrister could not sue for his fees. A deed which Kennedy had obtained from Mrs Swinfen, giving him a reversion to the Swinfen Hall estates in Staffordshire, was ordered to be delivered up by a judgment of the master of the rolls on 31 July 1863. Kennedy died at his home, Stapylton House, Harborne, Staffordshire, on 17 December 1867. He was married and left a family.<br>
<br>Kennedy was an accomplished classical scholar and translator. He published translations of the various works of Demosthenes and completed an English translation begun by his father of the last eight books of Virgil's <span class="italic">Aeneid</span>.<br>
