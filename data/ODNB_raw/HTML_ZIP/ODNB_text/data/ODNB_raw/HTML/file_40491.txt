<span class="headword">Garbett,  Samuel</span>  (1717&#150;1803), <span class="occ">industrialist and ironmaster</span>, was born in humble circumstances in Birmingham; nothing else is known about his early life. In August 1735 he married Anne Clay (<i>d</i>. 1772) of Aston. They had four children, two of whom died in infancy. Francis, his son, was associated with his father in some of his business enterprises, as was Charles Gascoigne, husband of Garbett's eldest child and only daughter, Mary.<br>
<br>Garbett was probably almost entirely self-taught but he soon made his mark as a brassworker and became an agent for a London merchant in the purchase of Birmingham ware. He entered into partnership with John Roebuck as a refiner of gold and silver and a consultant chemist to local industries in Birmingham. This early work gave them both the technical skill and the financial resources to begin the manufacture of sulphuric acid in Birmingham and from 1749 at Prestonpans in Scotland. Ten years later the Scottish interests took a major leap forward with the start of the ironworks at Carron, Stirlingshire, in which Garbett and Roebuck each held 25 per cent of the initial capital of the Carron Company. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49056/', "William Cadell (bap. 1708, d. 1777)")</script> and his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49057/', "William Cadell (bap. 1737, d. 1819)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47486/', "Cadell family (per. c.1740&#150;1934)")</script>] were also financially involved.<br>
<br>Roebuck's wayward genius could not be restrained even by Garbett's commercial acumen. The Carron works was soon greater than anyone had expected and Garbett was called on to finance much of the expansion. The strain was worsened by the activities of Francis Garbett in a shipping company and by those of Gascoigne. The latter took control of most of the family's Scottish interests and eventually ousted his father-in-law before going to Russia to set up a major iron foundry. Such commercial expansion, usually initiated by others, called for financial support beyond Garbett's means. The general financial crisis of 1772 deepened his difficulties and ten years later Garbett was declared bankrupt. His friend Matthew Boulton was a trustee and his loyal supporter in all his difficulties. Boulton especially encouraged him to re-establish his business in Birmingham; Garbett was eventually able to leave more than &pound;12,000 on his death, though with creditors not fully discharged.<br>
<br>From the crisis of 1772 Garbett's financial affairs were in such complex disarray in a mass of interlocking and intricate legal actions that Boulton deemed them beyond his comprehension. While Garbett gave them much attention, at the same time he became a pioneering political lobbyist on behalf of manufacturers and a commentator on political and economic affairs. The key figure in his political contacts was the second earl of Shelburne and first marquess of Lansdowne (1737&#150;1805), but Garbett corresponded widely with the result that letters from him are to be found in many manuscript collections.<br>
<br>In 1783 Garbett promoted the Birmingham Commercial Committee to look after the city's interests, especially of its manufacturers, and was its chairman until 1782. Though concerned initially with local industries, he was convinced of the need to be able to exert wider influence by collective action. In 1785 the threat of reciprocal trading privileges for Ireland led him to co-operate uneasily with Josiah Wedgwood (1730&#150;1795) in promoting a general chamber of manufacturers to lobby parliament on behalf of all manufacturers. Local jealousies ensured that the general chamber did not survive the test of the commercial treaty negotiated with France in 1786 by William Eden, first Baron Auckland. Though influenced by the growing acceptance of free trade views among some of his close friends, Garbett showed traits of a lingering mercantilism in his reluctance to allow free movement overseas of men and machinery. His liberal sympathies are evident in an investigation into the Royal Mint, undertaken with his son, Francis, at the request of Shelburne in 1782. The report, published in 1837, shows the authors' intimate knowledge of the trade in precious metals, offers suggestions for more economical methods of coinage, and pointedly draws attention to the proliferation of sinecures.<br>
<br>Garbett's public life centred on Birmingham. He helped set up the city's assay office in 1773 and was warden from 1796 to 1800. He was active in the Birmingham General Hospital and was chairman of a commission of 1769 to widen and clean the streets. He pioneered the campaign for the abolition of slavery and took part in work on poor relief, excessive consumption of alcohol, and public order. On issues where extremes dominated, he was often a moderating influence. He adhered to the Church of England, but in Scotland associated with the established (Presbyterian) church there, and he defended Joseph Priestley and other dissenters when they were attacked by a mob in 1791.<br>
<br>After Garbett's death Boulton offered the best assessment of his character: &#145;I have always found his principles unfailingly just, honourable and liberal&#146;  (M. Boulton to W. Davies, 12 Dec 1803; Matthew Boulton MSS). His personal misfortunes arose chiefly from the reckless schemes of others, notably of Roebuck and Gascoigne. Garbett died in Birmingham on 5 December 1803 and was buried in the grounds of St Philip's Church (now the cathedral), of which he had been a churchwarden.<br>
