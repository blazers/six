<span class="headword">Hamilton,  Gavin George</span>, second Baron Hamilton of Dalzell  (1872&#150;1952), <span class="occ">horse-racing administrator</span>, was born on 29 June 1872 at Garscube House, Newkilpatrick, Dalziel, near Motherwell, Lanarkshire, the second of the four sons and the fifth of the eight children of John Glencairn Carter Hamilton, first Baron Hamilton of Dalzell (1829&#150;1900), landowner and MP, and his wife, Lady Emily (1840&#150;1882), daughter of David Leslie-Melville, eighth earl of Leven and seventh earl of Melville. His family, whose seat was Dalzell House, Dalziel, had been prominent landowners in Lanarkshire for several centuries and his father, a Gladstonian Liberal, was raised to the peerage in 1886.<br>
<br>Educated at Eton and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Hamilton was a regular soldier until 1898 and later served in the South African War and in France in the First World War, during which he rose to the rank of major in the Scots Guards and was awarded the Military Cross. Having inherited the barony in 1900, he became a knight of the Thistle in 1909 and a lord in waiting to Edward VII and George V, and remained a friend of the latter after leaving the court in 1911 on being cited as co-respondent in his future wife's undefended divorce case. On 24 July 1912 he married Sybil Mary (1867&#150;1933), daughter of Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick Marshall and formerly wife of William Lawson, later third Baron Burnham.<br>
<br>Though a racehorse owner on only a small scale, Hamilton proved the outstanding turf administrator of his time, with a progressive outlook and reforming zeal which marked him out among the members of the Jockey Club. Even before his election to horse-racing's conservative governing body in 1908 he was responsible for a policy of racecourse stewards' initiating post-race inquiries rather than waiting for an objection to be lodged, and in 1919 he was the principal author of a report, subsequently ignored, which suggested that facilities for racegoers could be improved by using the savings resulting from possible racecourse mergers.<br>
<br>Hamilton was the senior steward of the Jockey Club for three terms of twelve months each and during the second of them, in 1927&#150;8, he set about realizing his ambition of making betting contribute financially to horse-racing. He chaired a Jockey Club committee which recommended the introduction of the totalizator (&#145;tote&#146;), a pool betting service whose profits, unlike those of bookmakers, would be used to the benefit of the sport, as in many other countries. The enabling legislation, the <span class="roman">Racecourse Betting Act</span> 1928, was introduced as a private member's bill in the House of Commons by Ralph Glyn (later first Baron Glyn), but Hamilton was its driving spirit and he helped to outmanoeuvre strong lobbying from an unlikely alliance of bookmakers, who feared competition, and moralists, in particular the church, which opposed all gambling as a social evil. However, during the bill's stormy passage through the Commons many concessions had to be made and the original intention that the tote should be run by the Jockey Club had to be abandoned.<br>
<br>The tote started operations in July 1929, managed by the Racecourse Betting Control Board (later the Horserace Totalisator Board), a statutory body of which Hamilton was a member until 1949. The tote overcame considerable teething problems, and though it did not gain as big a share of the betting market as he had hoped, it did eventually prove a significant source of revenue for the sport.<br>
<br>The father of the tote also introduced Jockey Club rules requiring all horses to run on their merits and banning dead heats from being run off in a decider. From 1934 to 1945 Hamilton was the king's representative at Ascot racecourse, where he effected many improvements. He was lord lieutenant of Lanarkshire from 1938 until his death, revived Lanark and Hamilton Park racecourses, and ran a model dairy farm on his 2500 acre Dalzell estate.<br>
<br>Gavin Hamilton, a man of austere appearance and of few words, was a practical visionary. Always seeking ways to benefit the sport he loved, he possessed both the foresight to identify the tote as a potential new source of revenue and the drive to bring about its creation. Few men have left such a lasting legacy to the sporting world. He died on 23 June 1952 at Dalzell House and was buried there three days later. He had no children and was succeeded in the barony by his nephew, John d'Henin Hamilton (1911&#150;1990).<br>
