<span class="headword">O'Kelly,  Se&aacute;n Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [Se&aacute;n Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Ceallaigh]</span>  (1882&#150;1966), <span class="occ">president of &Eacute;ire (Ireland)</span>, was born at 4 Lower Wellingon Street, Dublin, on 25 August 1882, the eldest son of Samuel O'Kelly and his wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> O'Dea (<i>d</i>. 1923), originally from co. Clare. His family soon moved to Berkeley Road, where his father established a boot making business. He was educated at the convent of the Sisters of Holy Faith, Mountjoy Street, the Christian Brothers' schools at St Mary's Place, and, briefly, at the O'Connell Schools, North Richmond Street. On leaving school in 1898, he became a junior assistant in the National Library, and remained in that post until 1902.<br>
<br>During this time O'Kelly joined the Ard Craobh branch of the Gaelic League, and was taught Irish there by Sinead O'Flanagan, the future wife of Eamon de Valera. In 1902 he joined the Archbishop McHale branch of the league, and eventually became secretary and president of that branch. O'Kelly also attended meetings of the Celtic Literary Society, where he met Arthur Griffith and William Rooney, and this contact led him to make contributions to the <span class="italic">United Irishman</span>. O'Kelly joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) in 1902, enrolling in the Bartholomew Teeling Club, which had about twenty members. He was a dedicated member and travelled to Wexford, Sligo, and Galway swearing in new members. He also helped to set up the Confederate Literary and Debating Society to further recruitment to the IRB. In 1903 he was named as business manager of <span class="italic">An Claidheamh Soluis</span>, the weekly journal of the Gaelic League, and Patrick Pearse was appointed editor. O'Kelly's task was to secure advertisements for the paper and to promote its sales.<br>
<br>O'Kelly joined Sinn F&eacute;in at its inception in 1905, and he was fortunate to be chosen by lot to represent the Inns Quay branch of the party in the municipal council election of 1906. He was elected to the Dublin corporation, and served on it in various capacities until 1932. He acted on committees for the waterworks, finance, and technical education. In 1908 he went to Rome, as part of a delegation from Dublin corporation, and was chosen to read the official address, in Irish, to Pope Pius X. At the same time he was advancing his position within the Sinn F&eacute;in. He served on the Sinn F&eacute;in Co-operative Savings Bank, and in 1906 he was elected to the national executive. From 1907 to 1909 he was honorary secretary. All of these activities adversely affected O'Kelly's performance as manager of <span class="italic">An Claidheamh Soluis</span>. Pearse, while praising O'Kelly's other works, complained that he was not managing <span class="italic">An Claidheamh Soluis</span> properly. Other difficulties were also apparent, and both men resigned from their positions in 1909.<br>
<br>This set-back did not harm O'Kelly's career prospects. In the same year, 1909, he was elected to the executive of the Gaelic League, a position he held until 1915. He was also appointed secretary of the Sinn F&eacute;in Printing and Publishing Company in 1909, and subsequently worked with Griffith in publishing <span class="italic">Sinn F&eacute;in</span>, <span class="italic">Scissors and Paste</span> and <span class="italic">Nationality</span>.<br>
<br>O'Kelly enrolled in the Irish Volunteers when they were founded on 25 November 1913, and in September 1914 he attended a meeting of the IRB and the Irish Citizen Army, which was held with the intention of securing a common front between the two groups. O'Kelly was appointed secretary of the Irish Neutrality League, an open organization for the group, but it was quickly suppressed. Acting for the IRB he went to the United States in March 1915 and made contact with John Devoy, Judge Cohalan, and Joe McGarrity. He informed them of plans for an insurrection, and was given a donation of $5000, which he delivered to Eoin MacNeill in May 1915. In August 1915 O'Kelly was appointed secretary of the Gaelic League at the Dundalk Ard Fheis, in a move by the IRB to gain control of the organization. Douglas Hyde remarked in his memoir that this appointment was political, although he accepted that O'Kelly was &#145;a very nice little gentlemanly man&#146;  (University College, Dublin, folklore department).<br>
<br>When the Easter rising started on 24 April 1916 O'Kelly was instructed to act as a staff captain under the command of Pearse in the General Post Office. Following the surrender O'Kelly was arrested and held in Richmond barracks, Dublin. He was then deported, and spent some time in custody at Wandsworth, Woking, Fron-goch, and Reading gaols, before he was released, just before Christmas day 1916, as part of a general amnesty. He was deported again in February 1917, and remained in England until June 1917. On his return to Ireland he participated in the negotiations that culminated in the creation of the new republican Sinn F&eacute;in at the end of October 1917, and he was elected to the executive of the party. He did not, however, resume activity in the IRB. In the following year, on 1 April, he married Mary Kate (<i>d</i>. 1934), a lecturer in French at University College, Dublin, second daughter of John Ryan, farmer, of Tomcoole, co. Wexford, and sister of Dr James Ryan (1891&#150;1970), a participant in the Easter rising.<br>
<br>O'Kelly played an influential role in the Sinn F&eacute;in election victory of December 1918, himself winning the contest for College Green, Dublin. He was subsequently appointed to act as chairman of a committee to plan a new assembly, and to be a member of a foreign affairs committee. He played a crucial role in preparing for the first meeting of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 21 January 1919, and in formulating the proclamations, especially the democratic programme, that were made on that day. He was appointed speaker (chairman) of the D&aacute;il on 22 January, and was re-elected to that position in April 1919, although, since February, he had been acting as the Irish republican envoy in Paris. His brief was to present the case for Irish independence to the peace conference in Paris. The mission, while unsuccessful in its main aim, did much to enhance the Irish cause.<br>
<br>O'Kelly spent some time in Rome from February 1920, and significantly advanced the standing of nationalist Ireland. With the help of Monsignor Hagan, rector of the Irish College, and Father Curran, he drafted memoranda on Ireland's case for recognition, one of which he presented personally to Pope Benedict XV on 12 April. The beatification of Oliver Plunket in May, thanks to O'Kelly's influence, was not only a religious celebration, but also an affirmation of Irish nationalist values. O'Kelly also met Mussolini in June 1920, and engaged in plans to import arms into Ireland, which ultimately proved abortive.<br>
<br>In August 1920 O'Kelly returned to Paris as envoy, being confirmed in his position by the second D&aacute;il in 1921. Although he voted against the Anglo-Irish treaty on 7 January 1922 he retained his post as envoy under the new administration of Griffith. He opened the Irish Race Congress in Paris on 23 January on behalf of Gavan Duffy, the new minister for foreign affairs, but he was criticized for supporting de Valera rather than the representatives of the provisional government. Matters came to a head on 26 January, when O'Kelly and Harry Boland appealed to representatives to the coming Sinn F&eacute;in Ard Fheis to support the existing republic. They were both dismissed as a result. O'Kelly received notification of his dismissal on 20 February, but he remained in Paris until 24 March.<br>
<br>In the election on 16 June 1922 O'Kelly retained his seat for mid-Dublin. When the attack on the Four Courts and the civil war began on 28 June, O'Kelly reported back for armed duty, and was in the Granville Hotel immediately prior to the shooting of Cathal Brugha on 5 July. He was arrested on 28 July, after letters were found in his possession which linked himself, de Valera, and Harry Boland in a plan to bring guns into Ireland from America. Boland was shot in controversial circumstances within twenty-four hours, and O'Kelly remained in prison until the end of the civil war in April 1923.<br>
<br>While in prison O'Kelly was appointed to the council of state of the second D&aacute;il government, which had been restored by de Valera on 25 October 1922. He was elected for Dublin North as the republican candidate in August 1923 but, like all other anti-treaty candidates, he did not take his seat. However, O'Kelly played a significant role in the illegal second D&aacute;il administration, and acted as its chairman from December 1923 until his appointment as its envoy to America in 1924. When de Valera broke with Sinn F&eacute;in in 1926 O'Kelly played a crucial role in winning over a majority of the American Association for the Recognition of the Irish Republic to the side of de Valera and of Fianna F&aacute;il. He also took initiatives among Irish-Americans which strengthened de Valera's claim to the D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann funds in opposition both to the Free State and other republicans.<br>
<br>On his return to Ireland in 1926 O'Kelly played a significant role in building up the Fianna F&aacute;il. He was appointed a vice-president of the party, and in March 1927 he became editor of <span class="italic">The Nation</span>. Following the June election of 1927, in which Fianna F&aacute;il won forty-five seats, O'Kelly, acting as spokesman for the party, declared that the oath would be taken as an &#145;empty formula&#146;, like the signing of a visitors' book. When Fianna F&aacute;il became the government in March 1932 O'Kelly was appointed vice-president of the executive council and minister of local government and public health. His main achievement as minister was the supervision of a house building programme which produced some 12,000 houses a year. He also represented the government at the Ottawa Commonwealth conference of 1932, and at the League of Nations in 1933. His first wife died in 1934, and in August 1936 he married her sister, Phyllis, an analytical chemist, who was to survive him (dying on 19 November 1983). There were no children of either marriage.<br>
<br>O'Kelly fully identified with the broader thrust of de Valera's policy, and after the new constitution of 1937, his official position became that of t&aacute;naiste. In September 1939 he became minister of finance in a cabinet reshuffle, and during the war he served on the committees of internal security and of economic planning. Following the retirement of Douglas Hyde, the first president of Ireland, in 1945, O'Kelly was nominated by Fianna F&aacute;il to contest the June election for the presidency. He won the election with 565,156 votes on the second count, and was re-elected unopposed in 1952, remaining in office as president until 1959.<br>
<br>Following the act which made Ireland a republic in 1949 O'Kelly used his enhanced position of undisputed head of state to visit other countries, notably the United States, to represent the Republic of Ireland. He received many honours during his lifetime, of which the papal award of the grand cross of the order of St Gregory the Great (1933) reflected the close relationship between himself and the Roman Catholic church on a personal and diplomatic level.<br>
<br>O'Kelly retired to Roundwood, in co. Wicklow, in 1959, and lived quietly there until his death at Dublin Nursing Home, Roundwood, co. Wicklow, on 23 November 1966. He was buried at Glasnevin, Dublin. His obituary fittingly recorded that, as president, he &#145;had as fully transcended the political sphere as his natural dignity overcame his diminutive stature&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Times</span>, 24 Nov 1966). Stories about his size were legend, and the cry of &#145;cut the grass so that we can see him&#146; was often affectionately heard as he met visiting teams before soccer internationals. However, the wearing of morning suit and top hat, which he had come to love as envoy in Paris, became his hallmark, and did much to enhance his standing.<br>
