<span class="headword">Balfour,  Nisbet</span>  (1743&#150;1823), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Dunbog, Fife, the son of Henry Balfour, laird of Dunbog, and his wife, Katherine Porterfield. He and his four brothers all entered the army, as had their father before them. The family expended much of its money on buying commissions; in February 1778 Nisbet explained that his progress in the service had caused him to go &#145;monstrously in debt&#146;  (Polwarth papers, Bedfordshire RO, L30/12/3). He became an ensign in the 4th or King's Own foot on 27 January 1761, and thereafter rose steadily within the regiment: when the American War of Independence began he was a captain, serving with his corps at Boston.<br>
<br>Balfour was wounded at the battle of Bunker Hill (17 June 1775) but recovered to take part in the fighting around New York in the summer and autumn of 1776. At the end of that campaign, promoted major in the army, he returned home with General Howe's dispatches. In January 1777, dining at Lord Grantham's, Balfour presented a distinctly pessimistic view of the course of the war across the Atlantic  (Robinson papers, Bedfordshire RO, MS L29/214). He was sent back to America with instructions from the ministry to do all he could to encourage greater activity and less conciliation by the British commanders. His advice seems to have been ignored. Even so, early in 1778, despite the loss of Burgoyne's army at Saratoga the previous October, Balfour, newly promoted lieutenant-colonel of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, was confident that only a few more reinforcements were needed to extinguish the rebellion. He returned home again at the end of that year on sick leave, and took no further part in the war until he joined General Clinton's army before Charleston, South Carolina, in March 1780.<br>
<br>Balfour played a prominent role in the southern campaigns that followed. On the capture of Charleston in May, Clinton sailed back to New York and Earl Cornwallis took command of the British troops left to reclaim the rest of South Carolina. Balfour proved a loyal and conscientious subordinate to Cornwallis. He shared his chief's view that plunder had to be kept to a minimum if the local population was to be won over, and expressed sharp criticism of the ill conduct of some of the loyalists who had been armed by the British. His letters show a keen appreciation of the relationship between military operations and what he described as &#145;the fluctuating State of Politicks&#146; in the southern states  (Cornwallis papers, TNA: PRO, PRO 30/11/109, fol. 49). Cornwallis clearly valued this awareness of the political dimension of the struggle, telling Balfour of his &#145;most implicit faith in your discretion &amp; experience&#146;  (ibid., 30/11/78, fol. 3). Given his evident sensitivity to the problems encountered by the civilian population in a bitter internecine conflict, it was somewhat ironic that Balfour earned considerable notoriety when, as commandant of Charleston, he ordered the execution of a planter, Isaac Hayne, who had broken the terms of his parole and taken up arms again against the British.<br>
<br>After the war Balfour was promoted colonel and aide-de-camp to the king. In 1790, thanks to the influence of his brother-in-law, Robert Stewart of Castle Stewart in Wigtownshire, and on the interest of John Stewart, seventh earl of Galloway, Balfour became MP for Wigton Burghs, which he represented until 1796. From 1797 to 1802 he was MP for the scot and lot borough of Arundel, Sussex, after Sir George Thomas vacated the seat and offered the nomination to Pitt. He was a loyal supporter of Pitt's ministry. Meanwhile he had been promoted major-general on the outbreak of the war against revolutionary France (February 1793), and in 1794 he joined the duke of York's forces in Flanders. He never again saw active service, but became lieutenant-general in 1798 and general in 1803. He died, unmarried, at Dunbog on 10 October 1823.<br>
