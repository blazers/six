<span class="headword">Coffey,  Charles</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1745), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born and educated in Ireland but no more details of his early years are known. His play <span class="italic">A Wife and No Wife</span>, published in London in 1732, but never acted there, appears in a Dublin imprint of 1724 entitled <span class="italic">Poems and songs upon several occasions, with love letters, and a novel, nam'd Loviso, to which is added a diverting farce, call'd &#145;Wife and No Wife&#146;</span>. If all of these works are Coffey's, he was active for the greater part of a decade as a writer in Ireland before moving to England in 1729. Foxon attributes to him several poems on new spa- and pleasure-garden constructions from as early as 1723.<br>
<br>By October 1728, picking up on the success in London of <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> the previous season, Coffey created his own ballad opera, <span class="italic">The Beggar's Wedding</span>. However, the Smock Alley management's indifference in producing it, as shown by the delay to a bad Lenten date for audiences (24 March 1729), and poor acting, caused it to fail. Coffey must then have moved to London, for <span class="italic">The Beggar's Wedding</span> opened at the Haymarket on 29 May. There it became the hit of the season and a continuing repertory standard, especially as a one-act afterpiece (sometimes entitled <span class="italic">Phebe</span>). That same summer Coffey had a further short ballad opera, <span class="italic">Southwark Fair, or, The Sheep-Shearing</span>, at Reynold's Booth at the fair. His next ballad opera, the full-length <span class="italic">Female Parson, or, Beau in the Sudds</span> (Haymarket, 27 April 1730), failed.<br>
<br>In 1731 Coffey joined with John Mottley to transform into another ballad opera Jevon's old play <span class="italic">The Devil of a Wife</span>; this became <span class="italic">The Devil to Pay, or, The Wives Metamorphos'd</span> (Drury Lane, 6 August 1731). After it had been cut down to one act by Theophilus Cibber its success was sensational, becoming the most performed afterpiece of the century&#151;in 1731&#150;2 alone there were more than ninety-five performances in London. Kitty Clive rose to stardom as the original Nell. It was popular also on the continent. Translated into German by a recent ambassador, Count Caspar Wilhelm von Borcke, and subsequently retranslated and set to a composed score, it became the ancestor of the German <i>Singspiel</i>. Mottley and others allowed Coffey to have the public credit for <span class="italic">The Devil to Pay</span>, but as well as those who have been mentioned, words and ideas came from Rochester and Colley Cibber, and perhaps also Sidney and Shadwell. The writer of Coffey's entry in <span class="italic">A Compleat List of All the English Dramatic Poets</span> (1747), almost certainly Mottley himself, says that because it was an adaptation the two were not allowed the usual third-night author's benefit, but were none the less richly rewarded with &pound;70 after waiting until the thirty-third.<br>
<br>After this came two more ballad opera disappointments, <span class="italic">The Boarding-School, or, The Sham Captain</span> (Drury Lane, 29 January 1733), based on D'Urfey's <span class="italic">Love for Money, or, The Boarding-School</span>, and Coffey's attempt to capitalize as full author on the previous success, <span class="italic">The Merry Cobler, or, The Second Part of the Devil to Pay</span> (Drury Lane, 6 May 1735). Coffey now had the idea of financing himself by getting up a subscription for a folio edition of the poet Michael Drayton, but he died before it was published in 1748. Mottley, writing while it was in press, believed that the benefit would go to Coffey's widow, but Joseph Knight in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> says this was not the case.<br>
<br>Coffey was a hunchback, who chose to cope with public mockery by joining in with it: he played the part of Aesop in Dublin for one of his own benefits. Baker's verdict is that &#145;he had no very great share of original genius; his turn was humour&#146;, and Charles Dibdin, a full half century after his death, is withering in his scorn for Coffey (D. E. Baker, <span class="italic">The Companion to the Play House</span>, 2, 1764; C. Dibdin, <span class="italic">A Complete History of the English Stage</span>, 1797&#150;1800, 5.73), but it has been noticed that managers treated him with some consideration and often gave him a benefit. As can be seen, he was usually unsuccessful writing by himself, but gifted, or lucky, in collaboration; Allardyce Nicoll feels that the ballad opera genre was itself difficult to work in  (A. Nicoll, <span class="italic">Early Eighteenth-Century Drama</span>, 3rd edn, 1961, vol. 2 of <span class="italic">A History of English Drama</span>, 244). Coffey died on 13 May 1745 and was buried in the parish of St Clement Danes, London.<br>
