<span class="headword">Quick,  Robert Hebert</span>  (1831&#150;1891), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born on 20 September 1831 in London, the eldest son of James Carthew Quick, a prosperous merchant. He had a brother, Frederick James Quick (1837&#150;1902), a tea and coffee importer, who endowed the Quick chair of biology at Cambridge. Delicate health, the result of a childhood attack of measles, interrupted his education. He attended schools conducted by Miss Gutty and by Miss Burrows, and then a private school at Weybridge, before entering Harrow School in 1846. Poor health forced his removal, and he was taught by private tutors before his admission to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1849. Graduating as senior optime in the mathematical tripos in 1854, he was ordained in the following year, becoming unpaid curate to his lifelong friend, J. Llewelyn Davies, at St Mark, Whitechapel, until 1856, and afterwards at Christ Church, Marylebone. Travels in Germany stimulated an interest in modern languages. He returned to England in 1858 and accepted a mastership at Lancaster grammar school, where he taught classics and mathematics. Subsequently he held appointments at Guildford grammar school, at the recently founded Woodard Society school, St John's Hurstpierpoint, and at the Surrey county school, which opened at Cranleigh in 1865, where he gave important assistance to the first headmaster, Joseph Merriman.<br>
<br>In 1868 Quick published <span class="italic">Essays on Educational Reformers</span>, which was to prove a classic work of pedagogic theory. Based on practical experience of teaching, it provided a readable approach to the educational ideas of earlier writers, including Locke, Milton, Rousseau, and Pestalozzi, in a way that was relevant to current educational practice. In 1890, after several pirated American editions, a second English edition was published.<br>
<br>In 1869 Quick's former schoolfriend H. M. Butler offered him a mastership in modern languages at Harrow, which he held until 1874, when severe headaches, depression, and the laborious school routine caused his resignation. From 1876 to 1883 he ran a small preparatory school, at Orme Square, London, and then at Guildford. In 1876 he married Harriet Bertha (<i>d</i>. in or after 1891), daughter of General Chase Parr of the Bombay army. They had a daughter, Dora, and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35639/', "Oliver Chase Quick")</script>, who became regius professor of divinity at Oxford.<br>
<br>A strong supporter of training for teachers in secondary schools at a time when the need for this was far from generally accepted, Quick was appointed in 1879 by the newly formed teachers' training syndicate at Cambridge University to give a series of lectures on the history of education. He repeated the lectures in 1881 and 1883, but became dispirited and resigned in 1883. He returned to the ministry and was presented in 1883 by Trinity College to the living of Sedbergh, Yorkshire. The strain of this position proved too much for his sensitive temperament, and he resigned in January 1887. He retired to Earlswood Cottage, Redhill, in Surrey, where he continued his literary activities, writing for <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> and the <span class="italic">Journal of Education</span>, and contributing articles on educational subjects to the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. While visiting J. R. Seeley at Cambridge, Quick was stricken with apoplexy, and died there, at 7 St Peter's Terrace, on 9 March 1891. Shortly after his death the educational portion of his library was given to the Teachers' Guild, and later formed the Quick Memorial Library at the University of London.<br>
