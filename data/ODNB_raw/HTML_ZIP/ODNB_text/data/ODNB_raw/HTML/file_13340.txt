<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hind,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1616, <em>d.</em> 1652), <span class="occ">highwayman and royalist soldier</span>, was baptized at Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, on 15 July 1616, the tenth of thirteen children of Edward Hind (<i>d</i>. 1656), a saddler, and his wife, Anne Smythe. His father was evidently a man of some position in the parish, three times serving as churchwarden. On 24 February 1638 Hind married Margaret Rowland at Chipping Norton, where they baptized four children between 1640 and 1648. According to the Oxford antiquary Anthony Wood, who knew men who had been Hind's accomplices, &#145;the great robber&#146; was &#145;a little dapper desperat fellow&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Times</span>, 1.155&#150;6).<h2>
<a name="Thechapbookhero"></a>The chapbook hero</h2>A legend grew up around Hind as highwayman and royalist during his lifetime and thirteen pamphlets published in the last year of his life or shortly afterwards have survived. Wood dismissed the fullest of these, George Fidge's <span class="italic">The English Gusman</span> (1652), as &#145;very weakly performed. Many things are true in it, but most are false, and many material things are omitted&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Times</span>, 1.156): an apt comment on most of Hind's lives. According to chapbook accounts Hind was sent to Chipping Norton grammar school for a couple of years, but &#145;profited little or nothing&#146; from the experience; later evidence as to whether he could read is contradictory  (Fidge, <span class="italic">English Gusman</span>, sig. B1<i>v</i>). His father tried to teach him his trade but, failing, bound him apprentice to a butcher. At the age of seventeen Hind ran away to London where he joined Thomas Allen's band of highwaymen and gained a reputation for committing robberies which were hallmarked by polite, gentlemanly behaviour and by wit. An ardent royalist, he served in the garrison of Sir William Compton at Banbury during the first civil war; he was present at the siege of Colchester in 1648 in Compton's regiment but escaped when the town fell to Sir Thomas Fairfax.<br>
<br>Hind himself provided an account of his services in the royalist cause from May 1649 onwards. After spending three days in the Netherlands in meetings with the king's council, he spent nine months in Ireland where he served under the marquess of Ormond and was wounded at Youghal. To avoid the plague he spent eight months on the Scilly Isles and then a further three months on the Isle of Man before leaving for Scotland. Granted an audience with Charles II at Stirling, Hind pledged his services in the imminent invasion of England and was recommended by the king to serve as a trooper in the life guard of George Villiers, second duke of Buckingham. Hind seems never to have been an officer in the king's army: his acquired epithet of &#145;captain&#146; was an ironic reference to his leadership of his gang. He fought at the battle of Worcester where the royalists were decisively defeated. After making his way to London and spending five weeks in hiding he was captured at a barber's shop in Fleet Street on 9 November.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Hind's Ramble</span> was published a fortnight before his capture (the London bookseller George Thomason dated his copy 27 October). Hind's royalism was always a part of the persona created around him. Indeed the earliest chapbooks were blatantly cashing in on a rumour current in the weeks following Worcester&#151;when the whereabouts of the king were still unknown&#151;that Hind was helping the fugitive Charles II. On 15 September a broadside had appeared, <span class="italic">Another victory in Lancashire obtained against the Scots &hellip; also the Scots king going with Hind the great robber</span>, though on the latter subject all it could say was that &#145;its thought he [Charles II] lies sculking about in some private corners with Hind his guide&#146;  (Ollard, 95&#150;6). A pamphlet recounting the earl of Derby's scaffold speech promised, but failed to deliver, an account of &#145;the manner how the King of Scots took shipping at Graves-end on the fourth of this instant October, with Captain Hind, disguised in sea-mens Apparel and safely arrived at the Hague in Holland&#146;.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Hind's Ramble</span> duly played on the same hunger for news of Charles II's whereabouts, claiming on the title page to recount Hind's &#145;going to the Scotch King, where he was made scoutmaster general, and afterwards (as 'tis generally reported) was the onely man that conveyed the Scotch King to London, who since is shipt away far beyond seas&#146;. However, again this was hardly spoken of in the pamphlet; the &#145;many flying Speeches&#146; that he had brought the king safely from Worcester to London and thence to the Netherlands providing a peg to sell a collection of picaresque anecdotes, mainly fanciful stories of Hind's career as a highwayman. If his part in the escape were true, it concluded, &#145;he hath done things unparallelled, but if not true, he hath the name of it&#146;  (Fidge, <span class="italic">Hind's Ramble</span>, 41).<br>
<br>However, Hind's royalism forms only a small part of an unstructured set of anecdotes, and seems mainly to have added a couple of parliamentarian figures to the cast of social types&#151;gentlemen, lawyers, clergymen, usurers, and the like. Thus one of Hind's victim's was a county committee man, one of those figures whose financial demands for the parliamentarian regime could make him appear a bigger thief than any highwayman. On another occasion he set upon a troop of young soldiers fit enough for collecting taxes but not up to facing determined highwaymen. However, Fidge (in a section dropped from his later life of Hind) presented Hind's royalism sardonically, describing how Hind had used the opportunities provided by service at Banbury to run a protection racket and harry local carriers. When the closing in of the parliamentarian forces on Banbury made his &#145;trade&#146; there no longer profitable, he stole the governor's best horse to return to the life of a highwayman. Other pamphlets in similar picaresque vein followed: <span class="italic">An excellent comedy, called the prince of priggs revels, or, The practices of that grand thief Captain James Hind, relating divers of his pranks and exploits, never heretofore published by any</span> (11 November; a play which concluded its stories of cozenage and disguise with a short scene in which Hind leads the king from the field of Worcester) and the two volumes of <span class="italic">Hind's Exploits</span> (of which only the second, dated by Thomason 19 November, survives).<h2>
<a name="PrisonerinNewgate"></a>Prisoner in Newgate</h2>Hind was committed to Newgate prison on 11 November. From there he actively promoted himself&#151;or was promoted&#151;as a soldier, a royalist, and honest rogue rather than as a highwayman in two pamphlets: <span class="italic">The True and Perfect Relation of the Taking of Captain James Hind</span> (14 November) and <span class="italic">The Declaration of Captain James Hind</span> (18 November). Although strict orders were given that he should be put in isolation, he was able to play to the crowd of curious visitors and fellow prisoners while his irons were being put on and his cell prepared, offering a toast to the king's health as he was being shackled; <span class="italic">The True and Perfect Relation</span> was a journalist's first-hand account of his words on this occasion. <span class="italic">The Declaration</span>, evidently by the same writer, claimed that it had been authorized by Hind himself:<blockquote>Whereas there hath been sundry and various Relations of the proceedings of Capt. James Hind, fraught with impertinent fictions; I am (in order thereunto) desired by the said Mr Hind, to publish this ensuing Declaration, for satisfaction, and true information, of the People. (<span class="italic">Declaration</span>, 1)</blockquote>The account it presented of Hind's royalist service over the previous two years appears in its essentials to be Hind's own: if not (as the pamphlet implied) smuggled out of Newgate, then probably a version of the testimony that he had given before the council of state. The hostile <span class="italic">Weekly Intelligencer</span> confirms that these pamphlets were at most elaborating rather than imposing on Hind a stance of defiant royalism: it also recorded Hind's toast, while sourly noting as evidence of the calibre of the king's supporters only Hind's fellow convicts joined him in it.<br>
<br>Hind truthfully denied any part in the king's escape. <span class="italic">The True and Perfect Relation</span> described an exchange between Hind and a gentleman from Chipping Norton in Newgate. When the visitor commiserated with his plight Hind replied &#145;That imprisonment was a comfort to him, in suffering for so good and just a Cause, as adhering to the KING&#146;, and when the gentleman refused to join in the toast, Hind angrily cried, &#145;The Devill take all Traytors: Had I a thousand lives, and at liberty, I would adventure them all for King Charles; and pox take all Turn-coats&#146;  (<span class="italic">True and Perfect Relation</span>, 4). Hind also at once distanced himself from, while appealing to, the picaresque myth. The stories about him in <span class="italic">Hind's Ramble</span> and <span class="italic">Hind's Exploits</span> were &#145;fictions&#146; but, he added, &#145;some merry Pranks and Revels I have plaid, that I deny not&#146;  (ibid., 6). He was happy to portray himself both as a loyal subject of the king and an administrator of rough-and-ready social justice.<blockquote>Neither did I ever wrong any poor man of the worth of a penny: but I must confess, I have (when I have been necessitated thereto) made bold with a rich Bompkin, or a lying Lawyer, whose full-fed fees from the rich Farmer, doth too too much impoverish the poor cottage-keeper. (ibid., 5)</blockquote>When he met a poor man he would challenge him whether he was for king or parliament: if the former, he would give him 20<i>s</i>., if the latter he would leave him alone. In both these pamphlets Hind denied ever shedding any innocent blood.<h2>
<a name="Trialsandexecution"></a>Trials and execution</h2>Hind appeared briefly at the Old Bailey on 12 December 1651, accused of treason in accompanying Charles Stuart to Worcester, but no indictment was drawn up against him. Because there was evidently no wish to make a martyr of him, the political charges were dropped and the council of state chose to pursue another course, sending him to stand trial at the next assizes for Berkshire, where there were outstanding indictments against him. He was taken from Newgate to Reading where he was tried at the beginning of March for the murder of one Poole, whom he was accused of having killed in a row over a bet. Found guilty of manslaughter, Hind was qualified to receive benefit of clergy&#151;the commutation of the death penalty to a branding on the thumb on condition of reading a passage from the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. He was unable to read the &#145;neck-verse&#146; but his luck held: the judge reprieved him and he came within the terms of the recently passed <span class="roman">Act of Oblivion</span>, which offered a general pardon for all crimes except high treason.<br>
<br>However, the positive image of Hind as a royalist hero meant that the authorities could not release him, fearing that he would remain &#145;a rallying point for royalist sentiment&#146;  (Faller, 13). The account of Hind's trial at the Old Bailey, published on 15 December, had recycled material from the earlier Newgate pamphlets while presenting him as a figure accepting his likely fate for his loyalty with humour and nobility. The pamphlets which continued to appear about Hind followed the fanciful and anecdotal tone of the earliest chapbooks, adding new material: Fidge's <span class="italic">The English Gusman</span> introduced the tale that a cunning woman had given Hind a charm which had kept him free from capture for three years. Most had absorbed material from the Newgate pamphlets and continued to contain elements of anti-parliamentarian satire, some more explicit than others. <span class="italic">A pill to purge melancholy, or, Merry newes from Newgate: wherein is set forth the pleasant jests, witty conceits, and excellent couzenages, of Captain James Hind</span> (26 January 1652) deployed a carnivalesque Hind to criticize the new regime. &#145;It hath bin a constant custom observed among the people of this Nation, to spend the time of Christmas in mirth and jollity, using to have maskings, mummings, wasselings, &amp;c.&#146;, it opened (recalling a whole set of customs which the new regime was bent on suppressing), before describing a Christmas-time lark in a brothel in Chancery Lane which had culminated in Hind, dressed as a woman, robbing a lecherous old lawyer  (<span class="italic">Pill</span>, 3). <span class="italic">We have Brought our Hogs to a Fair Market, or, Strange Newes from New-Gate</span> (14 January 1652) purported to print Hind's instructions to &#145;Our Royal Gang and Fraternity&#146; urging them &#145;to be in charity with all men, except the Caterpillars of the Times, viz., Long-gown men, Committee-men, Excize-men, Sequestrators, and other Sacrilegious persons&#146;  (p. 1). It also told how, in Newgate, Hind had received a vision of Charles I, with his crown upon his head, urging him to &#145;Repent, repent, and the King of Kings will have mercy on a Thief&#146;  (p. 5), and how Hind had once conjured up a vision of a lion rampant (the Scottish symbol no doubt an allusion to Charles II) to scare away his pursuers.<br>
<br>So Hind stayed a prisoner and the council of state fell back on the charge of treason: in July 1652 it sent down the examinations which it had collected against Hind the previous winter to the assize judges, heavy-handedly advising them that it left it to them to proceed against him according to law. At the beginning of September he was convicted at the Worcester assizes of treason. Reportedly, as the sentence was delivered<blockquote>he lookt very austerely, and said, &#145;Gentlemen, I thank you; this is no more but what I ever expected, since the time of my captivity in Iron; and this I am assured of, that as envy must cease in the grave, so will my bloud be requir'd at your hands&#146;. (<span class="italic">The Faithful Scout</span>, 85, 27 Aug&#150;3 Sept 1652, 665)</blockquote>The council of state rejected his wife's appeal for a reprieve, claiming that it could not interfere in the matter. Hind went to the gallows at Worcester on 24 September 1652. A letter published in a newsbook recorded how he knelt at the foot of the gallows and read over a little book for a while, before taking leave of his son and giving money to a butcher in the town. His last words presented himself both as penitent thief and loyal subject, interrupted by a burst of anger against the men whom he blamed for his death:<blockquote>after he had fetcht two or three very deep sighs, he said, He was sorry that he had not been ruled by his Wife, who had upon her knees many times begged of him to give over his unlawful course of living, for it would at last bring him to an untimely death. Then he railed against one Mr Moor, and Mr Wall, saying, that they were the cause of his death &hellip; For which he was checked by &hellip; the Gaoler &hellip; [He said that] he had taken the Oath of Allegiance, to be true to his King <i>and prayed God to bless his King, and all that wished him well.</i> (<span class="italic">A Perfect Account</span>, 91, 22&#150;9 Sept 1652, 728)</blockquote>Hind was spared the full horrors of a traitor's death: he was apparently not drawn on a hurdle to his execution; his body was mutilated and dismembered only after he was completely dead; and his body (or at least his torso) was allowed a proper burial. His fate is a striking testament to the power of his reputation: only a handful of English royalists were executed for their part in the war of 1651, and they in its immediate aftermath, not a full year later.<br>
<br>Hind was remembered as a royalist, the first in a literary tradition where highway robbery was combined with loyalty to the crown. However, in much of the literature in his lifetime and afterwards, the individuality of the man and his convictions was lost in favour of a generic type of rogue to which he himself had been willing to appeal. <span class="italic">No jest like a true jest being a compendious record of the merry life and mad exploits of Capt James Hind the great robber of England</span> was the characteristic title of a chapbook first published in 1657 and republished several times up to 1800. This was the version of Hind's life elaborated in early eighteenth-century criminal biographies: the jovial rogue whose exploits cocked a snook at England's puritan rulers. According to Alexander Smith the Allen gang had tried to hold up Oliver Cromwell at Huntingdon; heavily outnumbered, most of the gang were taken and later hanged, though Hind managed to escape. Later Hind ambushed notorious regicides; according to Smith these were John Bradshaw and the puritan preacher Hugh Peters, while Charles Johnson added the Fifth Monarchist Thomas Harrison.<br>
