<span class="headword">Rothery,  Mary Catherine  Hume-</span>  (1824&#150;1885), <span class="occ">campaigner for medical reform and author</span>, was born on 14 December 1824 at Bryanston Square, London, the youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14148/', "Joseph Hume (1777&#150;1855) MP")</script> and his wife, Maria (<i>b</i>. 1786), daughter of Hardin Burnley, a proprietor of the East India Company. Mary Catherine married the Revd William Rothery (<i>d</i>. 1888), who was curate of Hexham, Northumberland, from 1862 to 1864 and assumed the additional name of Hume by deed poll on 1 January 1866. They had at least one child, a son.<br>
<br>Through the influence of a close friend and colleague of her father, Charles Augustus Tulk (1786&#150;1849), Mary Hume-Rothery became a Swedenborgian. In 1850 she published an account of Tulk's life addressed to members of the New Church, the sect founded in 1787 to promote Swedenborg's teachings in Britain (of which Tulk had not been a member). In it she outlined Tulk's interpretation of what he had held to be Swedenborg's core doctrine, the &#145;law of correspondence&#146;, that all the objects of the senses were representations of human will and intellect. Like many Swedenborgians, Tulk had a strong interest in popular sciences and unorthodox medical movements, including phrenology and mesmerism. Linking an &#145;alternative&#146; medical ethos to a liberal-radical perception of the state, Hume-Rothery went on to campaign against the growing authority of the medical profession in Victorian Britain.<br>
<br>In a published essay of 1871, <span class="italic">Women and Doctors, or, Medical Despotism in England</span>, Hume-Rothery described herself and her like-minded associates as &#145;medical dissenters&#146; who aimed at &#145;the complete and entire disestablishment and disendowment of the State-chartered medical autocracy&#146;  (Hume-Rothery, <span class="italic">Women and Doctors</span>, 15). She opposed the medical registration bills which endowed allopathic practitioners with the sanction of the state at the expense of homoeopaths, hydropaths, herbalists, and the like, who were often preferred by working-class people. The exploitation of women by male doctors roused her indignation: she strongly denounced male midwifery and the conducting of gynaecological examinations by male doctors, while she supported proposals to admit women to the medical profession and advocated health education for all women.<br>
<br>Two causes attracted Hume-Rothery's particular commitment from the early 1870s: the women's campaigns for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span> and against compulsory vaccination. She was a prominent speaker for Josephine Butler's Ladies' National Association, a separatist organization founded in 1869, which challenged the double standard of morality embodied in the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span> and insisted that prostitution was a consequence of poverty rather than of depravity. In <span class="italic">A Letter Addressed to the Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone</span> (1870) Hume-Rothery argued that nothing less than the complete legal equality of women and men, including the suffrage, would avail to redress women's grievances against the medical profession on this and other issues.<br>
<br>Mary Hume-Rothery, in partnership with her husband, played a nationally significant role in the allied movement against compulsory vaccination, which sought the repeal of a number of acts passed from the 1850s to the 1870s compelling parents to have their children immunized against smallpox. Based in Cheltenham, in 1874 the Hume-Rotherys founded the National Anti-Compulsory Vaccination League, with William as president and Mary as honorary secretary. The Cheltenham league soon became the national centre of the movement, the previously established Manchester- and London-based leagues being weak at this time. Mary Hume-Rothery edited the <span class="italic">National Anti-Compulsory Vaccination League Occasional Circular</span> (1874&#150;6) and its successor, the <span class="italic">National Anti-Compulsory Vaccination Reporter</span> (1876&#150;84).<br>
<br>The tactics of the Cheltenham league were comparatively militant: it organized a nationwide series of demonstrations and lecture tours, and encouraged parents to defy the law. While it was successful in extending the movement to the rural middle class, the existing urban working-class supporters in the north-west of England remained aloof from the (mainly middle-class) Cheltenham leadership, which failed in its aim to amalgamate the various leagues around the country. In the early 1880s the Cheltenham league was eclipsed by the London Society for the Abolition of Compulsory Vaccination (founded in 1880), which succeeded in co-ordinating provincial activities and gaining the support of a number of MPs.<br>
<br>Mary Hume-Rothery died on 14 February 1885 at The Pines, Tivoli, Cheltenham. In addition to religious and political works, she had published a novel and several volumes of poetry and children's stories.<br>
