<span class="headword">Lamphire,  John</span>  (1614&#150;1688), <span class="occ">college head and physician</span>, was the son of George Lamphire, apothecary, of the parish of St Lawrence, Winchester. He entered Winchester College as a scholar in 1627, and on 19 August 1634 matriculated from New College, Oxford, where he was elected fellow in 1636, graduated BA in 1638, and proceeded MA in 1642. In 1640 he wrote Latin verses for an Oxford collection celebrating the birth of Prince Henry&#151;the first of seven such contributions over the next thirty years. By the time the parliamentary visitors expelled him from his fellowship in 1648, he was college bursar. Through the 1650s, Lamphire practised as a physician in and around Oxford. Among the royalist wits who met at a city coffee house in 1655, he was, according to Anthony Wood (later his patient) &#145;sometimes the naturall droll of the company&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Times of Anthony Wood</span>, 1.201). In 1654 he was associated with the publication in Oxford of Hugh Lloyd's <span class="italic">Phrases elegantiores</span>.<br>
<br>In late April 1660 Lamphire was one of thirty-nine Oxfordshire royalists whose <span class="italic">Declaration</span> disavowed revenge. The restoration of his fellowship was ordered on 19 May by the House of Lords, and on 16 August he was elected Camden professor of history in succession to Lewis du Moulin. Six weeks later, on 30 October, he was created MD, and he continued to practise medicine, treating Anthony Wood's deafness. Lamphire's edition of his friend Thomas Masters's 1642 oration, <span class="italic">Monarchia Britannica sub Elizabetha, Jacobo</span>, appeared for the first time in 1661. On 2 September 1662 Clarendon appointed him principal of New Inn Hall, from where on 30 May 1663 he was translated to the headship of Hart Hall. When parliament went to Oxford in 1665 to escape plague it was at Lamphire's suggestion that the Commons moved that the university be thanked formally for its defiance of the parliamentary visitors in 1647.<br>
<br>Wood called Lamphire &#145;a public spirited man, but not fit to govern&#146;, being &#145;much given to his pleasures&#146;; he &#145;layd out much on the Principal's lodgings&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Times of Anthony Wood</span>, 1.475, 2.56). As a justice of the peace, Lamphire improved Oxford's roads and drainage; he also corresponded with secretaries of state Joseph Williamson and Leoline Jenkins, exchanging gifts which included his bottled &#145;fountain water that has crossed the equinoctial line four times&#146; without corruption and had a secret anti-scorbutical ingredient  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1676&#150;7</i>, 151&#150;2). On 27 February 1679 his election as university MP was frustrated when &#145;the vice-chancellor shew'd himself false&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Times of Anthony Wood</span>, 2.443).<br>
<br>Lamphire was associated with further Oxford publications: Lancelot Andrewes's <span class="italic">Preces privatae</span> (1675), Robert Pinck's <span class="italic">Quaestiones</span> (1680), and Thomas Lydiat's <span class="italic">Canones chronologi</span> (1675), printed from Lamphire's twenty-two volumes of Lydiat manuscripts, part of his substantial manuscript collection. He died, unmarried, at Hart Hall on 30 March 1688 and was buried in New College chapel on 2 April. His will, dated 9 December 1681, provides for relatives, numerous friends, and various Oxford institutions; it includes books and manuscripts for the university library and &pound;50 &#145;towards the mending of the Heighway betwixt St. Clements Church and the bottom of Hiddington Hill&#146;.<br>
