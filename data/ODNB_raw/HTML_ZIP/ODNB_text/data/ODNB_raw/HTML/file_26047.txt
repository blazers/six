<span class="headword">South,  John Flint</span>  (1797&#150;1882), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born on 5 July 1797 in London, probably at Lant Street, Southwark, the son of James South (<i>d</i>. 1823), druggist, and his second wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1865). His half-brother was the astronomer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26046/', "Sir James South")</script>. From October 1805 until June 1813 South attended Dr Samuel Hemming's school at Hampton, Middlesex. He then received tuition in the classics from the Revd William Fancourt, and he also attended the lectures of Astley Cooper and practice sessions at St Thomas's Hospital, London. Here in 1813 he met Joseph Henry Green, who became a lifelong friend. On 18 February 1814 South was apprenticed to the surgeon Henry Cline the younger, and in 1815 he started work as a dresser. From 1819 he served as prosector for the anatomy lecturers at St Thomas's, and in 1820 he was appointed conservator of the museum and assistant demonstrator of anatomy for three years on a salary of &pound;100. The next year he established his own practice above a cork shop in St Thomas Street, but he later moved to Adelaide Place, near London Bridge.<br>
<br>After some ill health, South was appointed in 1823 as joint demonstrator of anatomy with Bransby Cooper (which led to a dispute between Sir Astley Cooper and Green), and he retained this position until he became lecturer on anatomy in 1825. In 1834 he was elected assistant surgeon at St Thomas's, but severe illness caused him to resign his lectureship in January 1841. However, in July of the same year he was made full surgeon at the hospital, and with his health restored was able to lecture again. In 1843 he was appointed surgeon to the Female Orphan Asylum in Westminster Road, and in 1855 he served as a royal commissioner enquiring into the condition and operation of Dublin hospitals. He also acted as surgeon to the South Eastern Railway Company for many years.<br>
<br>South held many positions at the Royal College of Surgeons, which he joined in 1819. In 1841 he was appointed a member of the council, and in 1843 he became a fellow. The following year he was Hunterian orator, and in 1845 he acted as Arris and Gale professor of human anatomy and surgery. In 1849 he was elected to the court of examiners, and in 1851 and 1860 he served as president of the college. He was also a member of many other learned societies and regularly corresponded with scientists in Germany, France, and Stockholm.<br>
<br>South married twice. His first wife, whom he married in 1832, was Mrs Annie Wrench (<i>d</i>. 1864), second daughter of Thomas Lett of Dulwich House, Surrey. After her death he married, in 1865, Emma Lemm&eacute;, daughter of John Louis Lemm&eacute; of Antwerp and London, and niece of his friend Green. There were five children from the first marriage, and two daughters from the second. From 1841 the family lived at Blackheath Park in Kent.<br>
<br>South wrote several medical works and also revised two editions of <span class="italic">A Description of the Bones</span> (1828 and 1837). His <span class="italic">Household Surgery, or, Hints on Emergencies</span> (1847) ran to several editions, was hugely popular, and served as an early form of first-aid manual. Fluent in both French and German and realizing the importance of overseas medicine, South published <span class="italic">A Compendium of Human and Comparative Pathological Anatomy</span> (1831), translated from the German of A. W. Otto; and <span class="italic">A System of Surgery</span> (2 vols., 1847), translated from M. J. Chelius's <span class="italic">Handbuch der Chirurgie</span>, to which he added many valuable notes and observations of his own surgical experiences. He also wrote a religious tract, as well as articles on zoology and anatomy for the multi-volume <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia metropolitana</span> (completed 1845); and, with Joseph Henry Green, he revised <span class="italic">The Dissector's Manual</span> (1825).<br>
<br>In appearance South was thin, with a &#145;handsome face, bright eyes and smile of unabated intellect&#146;  (Feltoe). He was a lifelong diarist, and deeply religious. He carried out church work and was a keen supporter of Sunday schools. Restless and never idle, his many interests included horticulture. In 1831 South helped to establish the Surrey Zoological and Botanical Society's &#145;Surrey gardens&#146; at Kennington in London, and after a visit to Sweden in 1852 he was awarded the fellowship of the Linnean Society and a medal of the Swedish Horticultural Society for introducing the vegetable marrow to that country. In 1859, largely through South's efforts, the body of the eminent surgeon John Hunter was removed from the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields and reinterred in Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>In 1860 South retired from his lectureship at St Thomas's, and in 1863 he also resigned the post of surgeon. He then became a governor of the hospital. The last twenty years of his life were spent collecting material for a history of English surgery. However, <span class="italic">Memorials of the Craft of Surgery in England</span>, edited by Power, did not appear until 1886, after his death. South died on 8 January 1882 at his home, 7 Morden Road, Blackheath Park, London. He was buried in Charlton cemetery.<br>
