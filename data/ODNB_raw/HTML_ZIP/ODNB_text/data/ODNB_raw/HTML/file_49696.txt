<span class="headword">Emery,  Winifred</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Maud Isabel Emery; <em>married name </em>Maud Isabel Maude]</span>  (1861&#150;1924), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 1 August 1861 at 3 Chatham Street, Manchester, and given the names Maud Isabel. She was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8787/', "Samuel Anderson Emery (1817&#150;1881)")</script>, an actor, and his wife, Emma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> King (<i>d</i>. 1886). She came from a well-established theatrical family and, taking the name Winifred Emery, made her first stage appearance in 1870, as Geraldine in J. B. Buckstone's <span class="italic">The Green Bushes</span> at Liverpool's Alexandra Theatre. She first performed in London on 23 December 1874 as Happy New Year in the pantomime <span class="italic">Beauty and the Beast</span> at the Princess's Theatre. Her adult career began in a period of innovation and expansion, at the Aquarium Theatre, London, in 1879, with Marie Litton's company; she then joined Wilson Barrett, first at the recently opened Leeds Grand Theatre, then in October of that year at London's Court Theatre, where she later claimed to have &#145;really started&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Sketch</span>, 7 Dec 1911), playing Minnie Heritage in H. A. Jones's one-act piece <span class="italic">A Clerical Error</span>.<br>
<br>After appearing at the Haymarket Theatre in August 1880, as Rosie Laborde in <span class="italic">A Bridal Tour</span>, and again at the Court Theatre, Emery played at the St James's Theatre under Sir John Hare and W. H. and Madge Kendal. In July 1881 she joined Henry Irving's company at the Lyceum, where she was seen, <i>inter alia</i>, as Annette in <span class="italic">The Bells</span> and Nerissa in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>. Engagements followed at the Vaudeville, under Thomas Thorne, where she was particularly successful as Lydia Languish in <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>, and at Toole's Theatre. In 1884 she returned to the Lyceum to understudy Ellen Terry and to join Irving's tour of the United States, where she appeared as Olivia in <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span>, Hero in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span>, and Jessica in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>. She remained with Irving, starred in October 1885 as W. G. Wills's eponymous Olivia, and went again to America in 1887&#150;8.<br>
<br>Typically characterized for her &#145;personal beauty and womanly charm&#146;  (Reid and Compton, 77) and her &#145;sympathy and fidelity&#146; both on and off the stage  (Maxwell, 12), Emery gave some of her most memorable performances as Mrs Errol in <span class="italic">The Real Little Lord Fauntleroy</span> at Terry's Theatre, London, in May 1888. Shortly before this, on 28 April 1888, she married at Kensington register office <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51456/', "Cyril Francis Maude (1862&#150;1951)")</script>, an actor. For reasons which remain obscure, she married him again at the Chapel Royal, Savoy, on 2 June 1888. They had two daughters and a son.<br>
<br>Further engagements followed at the Vaudeville Theatre and at Drury Lane, where, under Augustus Harris, Emery had leading parts, including that of Mildred in <span class="italic">The Royal Oak</span>. She proved an impressive Clarissa, with a &#145;virginal air of sweetness&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 Feb 1890) in Robert Buchanan's version of Richardson's novel at the Vaudeville Theatre in February 1890. There, later that year, she played Lady Teazle in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>, Kate in <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span>, and Fanny Hoyden in Robert Buchanan's <span class="italic">Miss Tomboy</span>.<br>
<br>After starring as Vashti Dethic in H. A. Jones's <span class="italic">Judah</span> at the Shaftesbury Theatre in September 1890, Emery rejoined Wilson Barrett at the newly rebuilt Olympic Theatre that December. She returned to the Shaftesbury in May 1891, and in February 1892 took the title role in the first production of Oscar Wilde's <span class="italic">Lady Windermere's Fan</span> at the St James's Theatre. She was the leading lady at the Comedy Theatre under Comyns Carr between 1893 and 1895 in Sydney Grundy's <span class="italic">The New Woman</span> and <span class="italic">Sowing the Wind</span> and A. W. Pinero's <span class="italic">The Benefit of the Doubt</span>, and returned to the Lyceum, then taken by Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson, in February 1896.<br>
<br>When Cyril Maude entered management, at the Haymarket Theatre in 1896, Winifred Emery was his leading lady. Following childbirth and illness between 1898 and 1905, when she appeared only as Muriel in Robert Marshall's <span class="italic">The Second in Command</span> in July 1901, her career resumed in February 1905, when she played Beatrice in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span> at His Majesty's under Beerbohm Tree. In January 1906 she appeared at the Waldorf Theatre as Mrs Pellender in <span class="italic">The Superior Miss Pellender</span>. She then formed her own company to tour provincial theatres, and starred in <span class="italic">Olivia</span> and <span class="italic">Her Son</span>, a new play by Horace Annesley Vachell, in which she appeared as Dorothy Fairfax and Cyril Maude as Richard Gascoyne. This opened at Cyril Maude's newly rebuilt Playhouse in March 1907.<br>
<br>For the next fourteen years Emery continued to play leading, albeit more mature, roles in London's West End, not only under her husband's management at the Playhouse, but also at His Majesty's (Mistress Ford in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>), the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane (Betty Gordon in <span class="italic">The Bunking of Betty</span>), the St James's (Esther in <span class="italic">Caste</span>), the Lyric (Queen Elizabeth in <span class="italic">Sir Walter Ralegh</span>), the Vaudeville (Miss Dyott in <span class="italic">The Schoolmistress</span>), the Apollo (Hon. Mrs Stevenson in <span class="italic">Never Say Die</span>), the Gaiety (Fairy Berylune in <span class="italic">The Betrothal</span>), and the Duke of York's (Mrs Smallwood in <span class="italic">The Enchanted Cottage</span>, 1922). At the command performance at Drury Lane during the state visit of the German emperor, Wilhelm II, in May 1911, she played Lady Franklin in an excerpt from <span class="italic">Money</span>, and at the coronation gala performance at His Majesty's Theatre on 27 June, under the direction of Sir Squire Bancroft, she was Queen Elizabeth in Sheridan's <span class="italic">The Critic</span>. Her last performance was at His Majesty's Theatre on 26 February 1923, as Nicole in a charity production of <span class="italic">The Ballad Monger</span>.<br>
<br>Winifred Emery died of stomach cancer at the family home, The Corner, Little Common, Bexhill, Sussex, on 15 July 1924, and was buried at St Mark's Church, Bexhill, on 18 July.<br>
