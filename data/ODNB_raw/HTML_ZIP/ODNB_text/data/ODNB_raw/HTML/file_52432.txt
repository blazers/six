<span class="headword">Burton, Sir  William Westbrooke</span>  (1794&#150;1888), <span class="occ">colonial judge</span>, was born on 31 January 1794 at Daventry, Northamptonshire, fifth son of Edmond Burton, solicitor, and his wife, Eliza, daughter of the Revd John Mather. When thirteen he left Daventry grammar school to be a midshipman. He was wounded in action in HMS <i>Conqueror</i> off Toulon in July 1810, and sought a civil career when peace curtailed naval promotions. He entered the Inner Temple in November 1819, and was called to the bar in November 1824. Chiefly a special pleader, he showed judicial promise as recorder of Daventry between 1826 and 1827.<br>
<br>In 1827 Burton was appointed senior puisne judge at the Cape, where Roman-Dutch law prevailed; he visited Holland to master the language. The Colonial Office, meanwhile, commissioned over his head a Scot, William Menzies, familiar with Roman law. Burton, chafing at his subordinate position (occupied from 1 January 1828), soon had to mediate in disagreements between his two seniors. The Cape's acting governor (later governor of New South Wales), General Richard Bourke, liked Burton and relied on his informal advice.<br>
<br>In 1832 Burton was sent to New South Wales, again as junior of three judges, lamenting his enforced transfer to a judgeship &#145;not worth holding&#146; in an expensive colony. Bourke, as incumbent governor, renewed their friendship. Sworn in on 22 December 1832, Burton was a competent sole judge, though &#145;overspeaking&#146; in full court often in dissent. He influenced local legal practice to accord more with English practice.<br>
<br>In 1834 Chief Justice Forbes sought sick leave. Burton so insistently claimed to act in his stead that Forbes deferred departing. Burton's grounds revealed a special pleader's skill, but the Colonial Office dismissed them. When Forbes retired in 1837, Burton pressed to succeed him, supported by Bourke and the Macarthur family with whose &#145;tory&#146; policies Burton sympathized. He hampered his cause by injudicious court statements seemingly critical of Bourke's administration. James Dowling, who, as senior judge, invoked Lord Brougham's patronage to secure his own promotion, found in Burton an &#145;unfriend &hellip; sadly cut by his disappointment&#146;.<br>
<br>Burton took leave in 1839. In London he published his <span class="italic">State of Religion and Education in New South Wales</span> (1840) and was presented to the queen. He returned in 1841 to judicial duties, revised the colony's bankruptcy statutes, and published a text on insolvency law. His transfer to Melbourne in 1843 was countermanded by Dowling who wanted a politically neutral appointee.<br>
<br>In 1844 Burton left Australia to join the Madras court, and to receive a coveted knighthood. Soon disliking India, he became preoccupied with domestic concerns. His ailing wife, Margaret, daughter of Leny Smith of Homerton, London, whom he had married on 15 April 1827, went to England and died in September 1846. Likening his future to a &#145;London November fog&#146;, Burton became morose until marrying, on 11 June 1849, Maria Alphonsine, daughter of John Beatty West, MP for Dublin.<br>
<br>Pensionable in 1855, Burton contemplated returning to Sydney but feared the expense. Friends encouraged him. He resigned from the Madras bench he had served well, went to Sydney, and, on 11 August 1857, was appointed to the legislative council, becoming its president in 1858. He added patrician qualities to his reputation as &#145;a Conservative of the Conservatives&#146;. In 1861 he resigned when a &#145;swamping&#146; of the legislature was attempted.<br>
<br>An influential Church of England layman, Burton failed to secure establishment of the church in Australia, and attracted controversy because of his perceived religious bias as judge. He returned in frail health to England in 1861, and led a secluded retirement overtaken by blindness. He died, childless, in London on 6 August 1888.<br>
