<span class="headword">Manto, Saadat Hasan</span>  (1912&#150;1955), <span class="occ">author in Pakistan</span>, was born on 11 May 1912 in Sumaira, in the Ludhiana district of the Punjab, British India, the son of Ghulam Hasan Manto (1855&#150;1930), judge, and his second (concurrent) wife, Sardar. He had a sister, Nasira Iqbal, and three stepbrothers from his father's first marriage, to Jan Ali. He was of Kashmiri descent, his ancestral home being in Koocha Wukeelan, Amritsar. He had a difficult childhood. The hostile attitude of his stepbrothers (who resented his father's second marriage), his father's strict nature, and later the exploitation he felt at the hands of his relatives following his father's death, all left permanent scars. He received a scanty education at home until the age of ten; he then attended first the local Muslim school, then Government Muslim High School, Amritsar, and finally Aligarh Muslim University, which he left without taking a degree.<br>
<br>A seminal influence on Manto was his friend Abdul Bari Alig, a successful journalist and scriptwriter. Manto's formal education had proven something of a failure, and had left him with an aversion for books, but Bari encouraged him to read, both in English and in Urdu, and to write, first translations into Urdu of Victor Hugo and Oscar Wilde, then his own compositions. His short story &#145;Tumasha&#146; was published in the first number of the journal <span class="italic">Khulq</span> in 1934. Further stories followed in <span class="italic">Saqi</span>, the <span class="italic">Aligarh Magazine</span>, and other literary journals. The first collection of his short stories, <span class="italic">Atishparay</span>, was published in 1936. By then Manto had moved to Bombay, where he first edited <span class="italic">Musawwir</span>, a monthly film magazine, then worked in the film industry as a scriptwriter. Among the companies he worked for were the Toon Film Company, Filmistan Limited, and Bombay Talkies. He also worked for All India Radio as a feature and drama writer from 1941 to 1942 (leaving after a quarrel with the director, N. M. Rashid), and as a journalist for papers such as the <span class="italic">Daily Masawat</span>, <span class="italic">Humayoun</span>, and <span class="italic">Alamgir</span>. His short stories from this period were collected in successful volumes including <span class="italic">Manto kay afsanay</span> (1940), <span class="italic">Dhowan</span> (1941), <span class="italic">Afsanay aur durramay</span> (1943), and <span class="italic">Luzut-e-sung</span> (1947). He married in April 1938, though his wife, Safia, did not formally move to his house until 26 April 1939; they had three daughters.<br>
<br>In January 1948, following the horrors of the partition of India, but despite the entreaties of his colleagues in the Bombay film industry, Manto moved to Lahore, in the newly created state of Pakistan, to which he had earlier sent his wife and children. It was by then clear that writers in Urdu faced more limited prospects in independent India than in Pakistan; indeed, in the United Provinces, the heartland of Urdu before partition, the use of Urdu was already under concerted attack from the protagonists of Hindi. A collection of short stories based on the events of the partition, <span class="italic">Siyah hashiyay</span>, was published in 1948; and the partition inspired perhaps his best-known story, &#145;Toba Tek Singh&#146;, about the exchange of psychiatric patients between India and Pakistan following partition. After his move to Pakistan, Manto wrote a stream of short stories, essays, personality sketches, occasional journalism, and a novel, <span class="italic">Bughair unwaan kay</span> (1954)&#151;during his lifetime he published twenty-two collections of stories, seven collections of radio plays, and three collections of essays&#151;but on a personal level his move to Lahore turned out to be disastrous. He descended into alcoholism, writing often only to buy the next bottle of liquor, was twice admitted to psychiatric hospital, was frequently in debt, and was on numerous occasions tried (and on six occasions convicted) for obscenity, for such stories as &#145;Thanda gosht&#146;, &#145;Khol do&#146;, and &#145;Oppar, neechey aur darmiaan&#146;.<br>
<br>Manto was one of the leading Urdu writers of the twentieth century. Frequently compared to D. H. Lawrence, he set new trends in Urdu fiction and introduced radical themes. He had a knack of pointing out the contradictions in society, and his leading protagonists were often prostitutes and others from the underclass, who through their humanistic values highlighted the dark side and the hypocrisy of Indian and Pakistani society. He could be a difficult colleague, and was frequently angry at perceived slights. He was also acutely self-critical. Even in February 1939, at the height of his success in the Bombay film industry, and at perhaps the best time of his life, he wrote to his friend Ahmed Nadeem Qasmee, &#145;My life is like a wall whose cement I scratch with my own nails to make all of its bricks pristine. At times I feel like erecting a new building from its rubble&#146;  (A. N. Qasmee, <span class="italic">Manto Kay Khutoot</span>, 1962). He died at his home in Dayal Singh Mansions, The Mall, in central Lahore, Pakistan, on 18 January 1955, of liver failure, and was buried in Miani Saheb graveyard, Lahore. His work was frequently reprinted, and a new collection, <span class="italic">Manto kay behtreen kahanian</span> (&#145;Manto's best stories&#146;) was published in 1963.<br>
