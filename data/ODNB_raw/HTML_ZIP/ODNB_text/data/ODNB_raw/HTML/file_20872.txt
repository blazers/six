<span class="headword">Osborn,  Robert Durie</span>  (1835&#150;1889), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Agra, India, on 6 August 1835, the son of Henry Roche Osborn (<i>bap</i>. 1798, <i>d</i>. 1849) and his wife, Charlotte (1808/9&#150;22 Sept 1894), third daughter of Major Robert Durie, 11th light dragoons. Henry Roche Osborn was baptized at Swanage on 29 June 1798, entered the East India Company's service in May 1819, and served mostly with the 54th native infantry, but latterly was lieutenant-colonel of the 13th native infantry; he died at Ferozepore on 10 March 1849. Robert was educated for a cadet at Dr Greig's school at Walthamstow, and was appointed ensign of the 26th Bengal native infantry on 16 August 1854, becoming lieutenant on 31 July 1857. He served throughout the Indian mutiny of 1857&#150;9, and was present in the actions of Bulandshahr on 27 September and of Aligarh on 5 October 1857. He commanded a detachment of the 4th Punjab infantry at the actions of Gungaree and Puttiallee, was present in various operations against the rebels in the Agra district, served with Colonel Troup's column in Oudh in November 1858, and took part in the action at Biswan. From January to May 1859 he was with the Saugor field force under General Whitelock; he afterwards commanded a field detachment in the Ooraie district, and later on defeated a rebel force at Tudhoorkee. In 1859&#150;60 he was with the Bundelkhand field force under Brigadier Wheeler. He was lieutenant in the Bengal staff corps (30 July 1857) and captain (20 December 1865). On 25 August 1859 he became adjutant of the 2nd regiment of Sikh irregular cavalry, converted into the 12th regiment of Bengal cavalry in 1861, in which Osborn was third squad officer from 4 November 1865 to 17 May 1866. He was captain in his regiment from 8 June 1868 to 1872. In the latter year he was appointed tutor to the Paikharah wards, became major on 20 December 1873, and retired with the honorary rank of lieutenant-colonel on 1 May 1879. He served through the Afghan campaign of that year, but retired after the signature of the treaty of Gundamuk.<br>
<br>Osborn was a serious thinker on both religious and political topics. As a young man he enjoyed the friendship of F. D. Maurice and of Charles Kingsley, and occasionally wrote papers in the magazines on Maurice's religious position and influence. While in India he studied oriental religions, and spent fourteen years on the complex materials for his two works, <span class="italic">Islam under the Arabs</span> (1876) and <span class="italic">Islam under the Khalifs of Baghdad</span> (1877), which were highly valued by serious students. Osborn was a zealous advocate of Indian rights, and his retirement from the army was largely due to his dissatisfaction with Lord Lytton's policy which, in his opinion, outraged Indian sentiment and needlessly provoked the Anglo-Afghan War of 1879. On his return from India he settled at Hampstead, and mainly devoted himself to journalistic and literary work. He became London correspondent of the Calcutta <span class="italic">Statesman</span>, and took a leading part in the conduct of the London <span class="italic">Statesman</span>, which was published for a few months in 1879 and 1880 to oppose Disraeli's Indian policy. In the <span class="italic">Scotsman</span>, the New York <span class="italic">Nation</span>, and the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> he also wrote much on India and on native claims to popular government. He also wrote <span class="italic">Friends of the Foreigner in the Nineteenth Century: a Critique</span> (1879) and <span class="italic">Lawn Tennis: its Players and How to Play</span> (1881). Osborn married at Trinity Church, Bayswater, on 12 November 1864, Edith, daughter of the Revd Gregory Rhodes; they had two daughters and she survived him. A keen lawn-tennis player, Osborn collapsed from syncope on Good Friday, 19 April 1889, while playing Ernest Renshaw, the champion of all England, at the Hyde Park tennis court, London, and died that day at 3 Porchester House, Porchester Road, Bayswater, London.<br>
