<span class="headword">Meinertzhagen,  Daniel</span>  (1915&#150;1991), <span class="occ">merchant banker</span>, was born on 2 March 1915 at Blundell House, Campden Hill, Kensington, London, the eldest of the three sons of Louis Ernest Meinertzhagen, a merchant banker, of Theberton House, Leiston, Suffolk, and his wife, Gwynedd Marion, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34564/', "Sir (Samuel Henry) William Llewellyn")</script>, portrait painter and president of the Royal Academy from 1928 to 1938. His father's family was of Danish origin, and had settled in Bremen, but this branch of the family had lived in England for several generations. His grandmother was a sister of Beatrice Webb, his uncle was the ornithologist and traveller <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37754/', "Richard Meinertzhagen")</script>, and both his brothers went into the City: Luke became senior partner of the stockbroking firm Cazenove &amp; Co. and Peter was general manager of the Commonwealth Development Corporation.<br>
<br>After Eton College and New College, Oxford, where he was awarded a third in philosophy, politics, and economics in 1936, Meinertzhagen joined Lazard Brothers, a leading City merchant bank, and began by working in the gilt-edged department. During the Second World War he served with the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve and reached the rank of wing commander. On 12 November 1940 he married Marguerite Josephine (<i>b</i>. 1913/14), the daughter of Albert Edward Leonard, a solicitor. They had two sons.<br>
<br>After the war Meinertzhagen went back to Lazards, where he was appointed managing director in 1954 and a partner in 1955. In January 1957 he organized the sale of the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> to S. Pearson &amp; Son Ltd, after his brother Luke advised Oliver Crosthwaite-Eyre, whose family controlled the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, and who was involved in a dispute with the chairman, Brendan Bracken, to sell the paper and spread his capital over a wider range of investments. Lazards was the merchant banking arm of Pearsons, and Meinertzhagen was able to arrange for Pearsons to buy a controlling interest in the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> before it was generally known that the paper was for sale.<br>
<br>Meinertzhagen became director of a number of City companies and companies for which Lazards acted, including Trolloppe and Colls, the Costain Group, and Alexanders Discount. He advised Rootes Motors on its merger with Chrysler in the 1960s, and when Lord Poole, chairman of Lazards, suffered a stroke in 1973, Meinertzhagen succeeded to his post. The following year he was appointed non-executive chairman of Royal Insurance, a client of Lazards. He was also chairman of Mercantile Credit, a prominent hire-purchase company. During the secondary banking crisis of 1974&#150;5, and the collapse of the stock market, Meinertzhagen played an important part in the restoration of confidence in the secondary banks through the recovery operation mounted by the big banks: Mercantile Credit was one of the financial institutions to be helped through the crisis, with support loans to the value of &pound;167 million. Meinertzhagen retired from the chairmanship of Lazards in 1980, but continued to advise Pearsons. He was chairman of Alexanders Discount from 1981 to 1984 and remained chairman of Royal Insurance until 1985.<br>
<br>Meinertzhagen was a leading figure in the financial world from the mid-1950s until his retirement, highly respected for his wisdom and sound judgement. He loved gardening at his home in Bramshot, Hampshire, and had a fine collection of porcelain. He died of pneumonia and chronic lymphatic leukaemia at the Cromwell Hospital, Kensington, London, on 22 March 1991, survived by his wife and their two sons&#151;one of whom, Peter Meinertzhagen, was chairman of the stockbrokers Hoare Govett.<br>
