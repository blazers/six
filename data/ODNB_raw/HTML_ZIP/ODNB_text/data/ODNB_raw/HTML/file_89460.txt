<span class="headword">Saunders, Sir  Peter</span>  (1911&#150;2003), <span class="occ">theatre producer</span>, was born on 23 November 1911 at 56 Springfield Road, Swiss Cottage, London, the second son of Ernest Saunders, manufacturer of razor blades, and his wife, Aletta, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Myers. He was educated at Oundle School, where he first developed a taste for the stage, and was &#145;finished&#146; in Lausanne, thanks to the financial backing of an aunt, his father having died of a heart attack while taking the young Peter swimming. Although Saunders's post-war career was entirely devoted to theatre, he began his professional life as a film cameraman, moving on from this rather improbable start (even then he was an imposing figure of a man) to work as a director, journalist, and press agent. During the Second World War he served in the intelligence corps, rising through the ranks to become a captain, and developing a taste for staging army revues. The first West End play he produced, <span class="italic">Fly Away Peter</span> (1947), was written by his wartime staff sergeant, A. P. (Alfred Percy) Dearsley. When the play struggled to find audiences Saunders had to ask the actors to take reduced wages; afterwards, he vowed never to ask his performers to shoulder the producer's burden again. That he never had to do so was largely thanks to his rapidly honed theatrical business sense, which proved to be particularly successful when it came to staging Agatha Christie plays.<br>
<br>Christie was an accomplished playwright as well as a best-selling author, and she found Saunders&#151;who produced touring versions of her <span class="italic">Murder at the Vicarage</span> and <span class="italic">Black Coffee</span> (both 1950), as well as her <span class="italic">The Hollow</span> (Fortune, 1951)&#151;professionally competent as well as personally charming and reassuring. In 1951 she offered him a stage adaptation of a radio play (<span class="italic">Three Blind Mice</span>) which she had written for Queen Mary's eightieth birthday, in 1947. Renamed <span class="italic">The Mousetrap</span>, the play opened on 25 November 1952 at the Ambassadors Theatre, in a production starring Richard Attenborough and his wife, Sheila Sim. The play moved, without break, to the neighbouring St Martin's Theatre in 1974, where it continued until after Saunders's death, establishing a record as the world's longest-running play. An entertaining psychological thriller that in its subject matter was ahead of its time (with a psychotic killer whose derangement was triggered by a woefully unhappy childhood), in every other respect <span class="italic">The Mousetrap</span> epitomized the 1950s. The play's longevity was a pleasant surprise to Christie, who had predicted that it would provide Saunders with &#145;a nice little run of six months&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>), and a profitable one for Saunders and Christie's grandson, Matthew Prichard, to whom she had donated the copyright. That it kept going, developing a seemingly unstoppable momentum, was largely thanks to Saunders's public relations skills. These included well-publicized anniversary events over the years at the Savoy, with an increasingly hunched yet redoubtable Dame Agatha wielding an appropriately dangerous-looking knife to cut the cake.<br>
<br>In contrast to <span class="italic">The Mousetrap</span>, Saunders produced the stage version of <span class="italic">Alfie</span> (Duchess, 1963), whose cockney anti-hero was later immortalized on film by Michael Caine. That was a relatively short-lived adventure, but he had (having taken over Volcano Productions) another long-runner with <span class="italic">No Sex Please, We're British</span> (Strand and Duchess, 1971&#150;86). In all Saunders produced more than 100 plays. Although his taste for light comedy was eventually left behind by a public interested in more demanding and explicit plays, his position as a theatre owner as well as producer meant that he remained in touch with changing theatre tastes, even when they failed to coincide with his own. Among the theatres he ran as owner or lessee were the Ambassadors, the Duchess, St Martin's, the Vaudeville, and the Duke of York's.<br>
<br>Saunders was twice married: first on 2 May 1959 to (Lily Louise) Ann Stewart (<i>d</i>. 1976), a 48-year-old divorcee, and daughter of William Hodgson, diamond cutter; and secondly in 1979 to Caterina Imperiali di Francavilla Baylis, the Italian-born television presenter known as Katie Boyle. There were no children of either marriage. Saunders was no stranger to television himself: he was a founding director of Yorkshire Television in 1967. He was also heavily involved in radio, producing many programmes for Radio Luxembourg and being a founding member of the consortium that in 1973 successfully bid for the opportunity to create a London-wide independent radio station (later named Capital Radio).<br>
<br>The combination of Saunders's theatrical experience&#151;recognized by a knighthood in 1982&#151;his <i>dignitas</i> (lightened by flashes of humour and an engaging smile), and his administrative skills, made him ideal for a number of high-profile positions in the theatre industry. These included twice being president of SWET (the Society of West End Theatres), from 1961 to 1962 and 1967 to 1969, and president of both the Stage Golfing Society and the Stage Cricket Club. As the last two offices suggest, he had some conventional recreational tastes, but in a pre-mobile phone culture he was unusual in listing, in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span>, &#145;telephoning&#146; as one of his hobbies. He also listed &#145;collecting wills&#146;, as he found in them a fascinating insight into people's characters. Although proud of his extensive producing career, which he followed until his retirement in 1994, he was well aware that his place in theatre history depended very largely on <span class="italic">The Mousetrap</span>. He recognized this not just by calling his autobiography <span class="italic">The Mousetrap Man</span> (1972), but by naming his house (3 Canon's Close, the Bishops Avenue, Hampstead) Monkswell. This was the name of the country house hotel where the action of <span class="italic">The Mousetrap</span> took place, but his own death (at home, of heart failure and bronchopneumonia, on 6 February 2003) was in peaceful contrast to the elegantly plotted murders whose popularity had enabled him to buy a house in one of London's most expensive streets. He was survived by his wife, Katie, and left an estate valued for probate purposes at more than &pound;11 million.<br>
