<span class="headword">Seccombe,  Lawrence Henry</span>  (1877&#150;1954), <span class="occ">banker and bill broker</span>, was born on 1 June 1877 at Terrington Lodge, Terrington St Clement, Norfolk, the second son of Dr John Thomas Seccombe (1834&#150;1895), a country doctor, and his second wife, Ellen (1848&#150;1943), daughter of Henry Bates, a Terrington farmer. He was descended from an ancient Devon family. Lawrence was educated at St Edmund's School, Hunstanton, until he was thirteen and then at King Edward VI's School, Birmingham, to the age of eighteen. In 1895 he went straight from school to join Lyon and Tucker, a small firm of bill dealers in the City. By 1917, when he left for war service, Seccombe was a salaried partner in the discount house of Ryder &amp; Co. He served as a second lieutenant (and acting captain from 30 April 1918), initially in the technical stores branch of the Royal Flying Corps and, subsequently, in the RAF and at the Air Ministry.<br>
<br>After returning to the City of London in the spring of 1919, Seccombe set up on his own account, taking into partnership S. R. Marshall and C. A. G. Campion. Money was borrowed from banks with surplus funds and invested in bills and bonds. Part of the starting capital came through a family connection of S. R. Marshall, and for this reason the new firm traded under the auspices of M. W. Marshall &amp; Son. Montagu Norman, the governor of the Bank of England, was at this time keen to exercise a closer supervision of the money market. Needing to replace the bank's agent or &#145;special buyer&#146; in the bill market, Norman turned to Lawrence Seccombe, who had in a short space of time developed a thriving bill business at Marshalls.<br>
<br>Seccombe's appointment in April 1922 had nothing officially to do with the company, but it necessitated a reorganization of his activities. The discount side of the firm in consequence became independent of M. W. Marshall &amp; Son and henceforth it traded as Seccombe, Marshall, and Campion, with Seccombe as senior partner. Nevertheless, in keeping with Norman's obsession with secrecy, Seccombe received no official appointment as special buyer, merely a verbal agreement. Official dealings were, moreover, to be done confidentially and it was entirely appropriate that operations designed to restore market liquidity should come to be known as &#145;doing good by stealth&#146; and the special buyer himself referred to as &#145;the Hidden Hand&#146;.<br>
<br>The firm's bill-broking business, which had been growing rapidly, was now swollen by transactions on behalf of the Bank of England&#151;mainly purchases and sales of Treasury bills designed to regulate financial conditions in line with national economic policy. The success or otherwise of these operations depended critically on the skill and tact of the special buyer, who was expected both to assess market conditions as the basis for official intervention and to secure the willing compliance of the discount houses with the bank's requirements. Seccombe also supervised the purchases of sample commercial bills in order to assess the quality of the transactions. In 1947 the firm became a private company with Seccombe as chairman, but it remained the smallest house in the market. Because of its unique role Seccombes escaped the process of amalgamation that occurred in the market generally in the 1930s and 1940s.<br>
<br>Seccombe was an outstanding figure among his contemporaries in the City of London. The complete man of business, he was always immaculately dressed, courteous, and gracious. Inclined to be hasty and impulsive, his judgement was amazingly good and his integrity never questioned. Above all, perhaps, Seccombe possessed a quality that Norman himself greatly admired and cultivated to an extraordinary degree: that of discretion, and of appearing inscrutable when necessary&#151;so much so that Kenneth Peppiatt, the Bank of England's market expert, with whom Seccombe fished for several weeks annually on the Scottish Dee, would find it impossible to guess, when meeting him in the money market, what scale of business he was seeking to transact. Discretion also proved a sure defence. When, on one occasion, Seccombe was absent and the partner deputed to act failed to satisfy the bank, Norman recommended the latter's dismissal. Seccombe, however, played his strongest card: he said nothing; and did nothing.<br>
<br>Seccombe held the office of special buyer for thirty-two years. His tenure paralleled closely that of Montagu Norman as governor of the Bank of England, and the two worked closely together to maintain stability in the money market in years of great monetary crisis and upheaval. Such was the importance ascribed to the role of Seccombe's firm that, on the outbreak of the Second World War, the firm was moved into the secure basement of the Bank of England.<br>
<br>Seccombe married on 11 February 1915 Norah (1885/6&#150;1959), daughter of Thomas Wood, a mine owner and mining engineer, and his wife, Ellen. They had two sons. Seccombe served as an urban district councillor for Weybridge in the 1920s and for Chertsey in the 1930s. In 1946 he was appointed high sheriff of the county of Surrey, and in 1952 he was appointed CBE for services to the City. He was very good with young people and devoted much time to youth schemes, including, during the war years, the sea cadets and the Air Training Corps. Most outdoor pursuits appealed to him, but he also enjoyed antiques and, latterly, foreign travel.<br>
<br>Seccombe died from a brain tumour at University College Hospital, London, on 28 November 1954. He was cremated on 2 December, and his funeral was held the same day at Pyrford church, Surrey, his ashes being later buried in the church walls. He was survived by his wife, and his second son, Hugh, succeeded him as chairman of the company.<br>
