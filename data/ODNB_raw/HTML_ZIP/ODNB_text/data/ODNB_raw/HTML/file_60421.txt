<span class="headword">Laurie <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Seyler]</span>,  Joan Ann  Werner</span>  (1920&#150;1964), <span class="occ">book and magazine editor</span>, was born on 17 November 1920 at 12 Ashland House, Marylebone, London, the youngest daughter of Thomas Werner Laurie (1864&#150;1944), publisher, and his second wife, (Elizabeth Mary) Beatrice (<i>b</i>. 1895), daughter of Henry Blackshaw, with whom he had had three children prior to their marriage in 1931. Her Edinburgh-born father founded the independent publishing house T. Werner Laurie Ltd in 1904 and rapidly built it into a thriving company with a reputation for eclectic titles, such as T. Francis Bumpus's series <span class="italic">The Cathedrals of &hellip;</span>, <span class="italic">The Encyclopaedia of Sex</span>, and <span class="italic">The History of Torture through the Ages</span>.<br>
<br>Joan Werner Laurie was educated at various private establishments, and sent to finishing school in Switzerland. She nurtured aspirations to be a doctor but these came to nothing. She married Paul Clifford Seyler (<i>b</i>. 1914), soldier and son of the playwright Clifford Seyler, on 1 May 1942, but joined the Women's Royal Naval Service soon after, as a clerk and then a driver. After the war she worked in an SPCK bookshop in London, and on 3 March 1946 she gave birth to a son, Nicholas Laurie Seyler. Paul Seyler left England soon afterwards, but his subsequent whereabouts and fate were unknown.<br>
<br>On its founder's death, T. Werner Laurie Ltd was bought by Clarence Hatry and continued to operate from offices over Hatchards bookshop in Piccadilly, London, where Joan worked as production editor. She met her life partner, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60418/', "Nancy Brooker Spain (1917&#150;1964)")</script>, when the author and journalist became editor of the literary monthly magazine <span class="italic">Books of Today</span>. Nancy had envisaged T. Werner Laurie's daughter as &#145;an elderly spinster, grown etiolated and dry in the service of the firm&#146;  (N. Spain, <span class="italic">Why I'm Not a Millionaire</span>, 1956, 132). Instead, she found &#145;a girl four years younger than me, very good looking with rather a long nose&#146;  (ibid., 133).<br>
<br>In 1954 Nancy Spain was approached by the National Magazine Company to be editor of a new women's monthly publication that was being planned. She declined, because of her numerous writing and broadcasting commitments, and suggested that Joan Werner Laurie would be perfect for the job. Marcus Morris, then managing director of the National Magazine Company, said in an obituary:<blockquote>Joan believed that intelligent, young-minded women, wanted to be stimulated, shocked, provoked, given cause to think by word and picture. She believed they wanted to know what was going on in the world outside their own backyard or comfortable sitting-room. Her conviction that even the most controversial subject could be tackled without offending more than a handful of readers was completely justifiable. (<span class="italic">She</span>)</blockquote>Elsewhere he wrote, &#145;Her personality was stamped on every page&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>).<br>
<br>Under Joan Werner Laurie's editorship, <span class="italic">She</span> smashed every last brick in the wall of taboos about what women's magazines should contain, and paved the way for the late twentieth century post-feminist titles such as <span class="italic">Cosmopolitan</span> and <span class="italic">Marie-Claire</span>. In 1963, defending an article about abortion, she was able to boast defiantly: &#145;<span class="italic">She</span> has dealt in full detail with menstruation, hysterectomy, breast cancer, lung cancer, leprosy, brain tumours. We have even told our enchanted readers exactly what a bidet is for&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Listener</span>, 31 Oct 1963, 705). <span class="italic">She</span> contained the obligatory recipes but also regular articles on &#145;Ladies and the law&#146;, simple carpentry, &#145;Building your own boat&#146;, and consumer-tested motorcycles.<br>
<br>Joan Werner Laurie was less sociable and charismatic than her more famous partner, who hogged the limelight while publicly acknowledging the enormous influence Joan had on her life&#151;including agreeing to pass off as her own child the son born to Nancy in 1952. Her less glittering social circle included Europe's leading woman racing driver, Sheila Van Damm, who shared a home with her and Nancy Spain for several years, and the romantic novelist Denise Robins. On 21 March 1964, on one of the rare occasions when Joan joined Nancy for a celebrity jaunt, they died together in the Piper Apache plane taking them to the Grand National, when it crashed just outside Aintree racecourse. Joan was cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 26 March. Joan's and Nancy's interchangeable wills resulted in both estates passing to Nicholas Seyler (later Werner Laurie), which unintentionally disinherited Nancy's son, Thomas Seyler (who later changed his surname to Carter, the same as his natural father, Philip Youngman Carter).<br>
