<span class="headword">Beaglehole,  John Cawte</span>  (1901&#150;1971), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born in Wellington, New Zealand, on 13 June 1901, the second of four sons (there were no daughters) of David Ernest Beaglehole, a clerk, and his wife, Jane Butler. He grew up in a crowded quarter of the youthful city. Like most of his contemporaries, he enjoyed the benefits of a state education, first at Mount Cook School, then at nearby Wellington College. But the chief formative influence of his boyhood was the modest family home. Both his parents were discriminating readers and to his English-born mother he owed a lifelong interest in music. A brief apprenticeship to the book trade preceded his entry to Victoria University College, the institution to which he was happily affiliated for most of his career. He was active in student affairs, wrote poetry, edited the annual magazine, and assiduously read history. Graduating MA in 1924, he won a postgraduate scholarship for his thesis on William Hobson, first governor of New Zealand, served briefly as assistant lecturer, and left for England in 1926.<br>
<br>To a colonial, as Beaglehole boldly proclaimed himself, London was both fulfilment and challenge. He gloried in the libraries and bookshops, he revelled in the music, and gradually he responded to the shabby elegance of Bloomsbury where he lodged. On the debit side social inequalities troubled him, he was irked by the airs of some academic superiors, and he found difficulty in choosing a subject. At last, with help from Harold J. Laski, whom Beaglehole thought friendly enough to rank as a colonial, he joined University College to undertake research in colonial history. His thesis, completed in 1929, gained him a PhD, but he could not find a publisher and there seemed no prospect of employment. The only course, he reluctantly concluded, was to return home. He had been cheered by the appearance, under an American imprint, of <span class="italic">Captain Hobson and the New Zealand Company</span> (1928), a version of his MA thesis. Now he was encouraged by a commission to write a book on Pacific exploration.<br>
<br>For some years after his return Beaglehole led an unsettled existence, moving from one temporary job to another, often in the unlikely role of Workers' Educational Association lecturer. His liberal views earned him a reputation for radicalism and lost him a university post in Auckland. More bitter still, in 1935 he failed in his bid for the chair of history at Victoria. In these adversities he had the unfailing support of his wife, Elsie Mary, daughter of Robert Arthur Holmes, a banker; they had married in 1930 and were to have three sons. And no set-back stemmed the flow of publications&#151;poems, articles, and notably, in 1934, <span class="italic">The Exploration of the Pacific</span>. This book led to his later research and, belatedly, to academic preferment: in 1936 he was appointed lecturer at Victoria University College.<br>
<br>Back in his native city (also the nation's capital), Beaglehole was drawn into many activities and enlarged his already wide acquaintance. The casually dressed scholar, somewhat resembling E. M. Forster, became a well-known figure not only in libraries and lecture halls but in government departments and more exalted centres of power. As a semi-official adviser on cultural matters he was in constant demand and took an active part in producing publications to mark the country's centennial. His contribution was <span class="italic">The Discovery of New Zealand</span> (1939) but of greater moment was his close association with J. W. A. Heenan, the imaginative public servant behind the enterprise. It was Heenan who after the war ensured state backing for Beaglehole's edition of the <span class="italic">Journals</span> of Captain James Cook, published by the Hakluyt Society. The first volume, dedicated to Heenan's memory, appeared in 1955 and the last in 1967. A bulky appendix was <span class="italic">The Endeavour Journal</span> of Sir Joseph Banks (1962). When he died at his Wellington home, on 10 October 1971, he was revising his biography of Cook. Edited by the historian T. H. Beaglehole, his second son, it came out in 1974.<br>
<br>In his last decade Beaglehole received many honours, academic and civic, culminating in the Order of Merit conferred in 1970. He was appointed CMG in 1958 and fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand in 1967. Victoria (now an independent university) appointed him to the chair of British Commonwealth history in 1963, made him an honorary LittD five years later, and following his death opened in his memory the superbly situated research room, fit setting for the fine portrait by W. A. Sutton. In 1966 he received an honorary DLitt from Oxford. His reputation rests firmly on the Cook journals, surely one of the classic works of historical scholarship. His personal qualities included generosity, a passion for justice, and a sometimes waspish humour.<br>
