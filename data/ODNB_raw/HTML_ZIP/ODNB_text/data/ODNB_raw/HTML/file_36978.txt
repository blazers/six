</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wingate,  Orde Charles</span>  (1903&#150;1944), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 26 February 1903 at Naini Tal in the United Provinces, India. He was the third child, and eldest son, of Colonel George Wingate (1852&#150;1936), an officer in the Indian army, and his wife, (Mary) Ethel (1867&#150;1943), daughter of Captain Charles Orde-Browne, of the British army. The Wingate and Orde-Browne families were Plymouth Brethren. In this tradition Wingate would become a career soldier of an unusual sort. Having been educated at Charterhouse School, he went to the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. His time there was not happy. His background had prepared him not to conform&#151;nor did he. As a result he was treated very roughly by his classmates. The strong-mindedness that marked his time at Woolwich, and which impelled him to follow his own path at an age when unity with one's peers is usually the strongest instinct, never weakened.<h2>
<a name="Orthodoxandunorthodoxsoldiering"></a>Orthodox and unorthodox soldiering</h2>Having been commissioned in the Royal Artillery in August 1923, Wingate spent the next five years in a series of routine postings&#151;the longest interval of orthodox soldiering in his career. Hoping to escape to more stimulating overseas service he began to study Arabic in 1926. Two years later, aided by a relative, General Sir Reginald Wingate (once Kitchener's intelligence chief), Orde Wingate got an appointment with the Sudan defence force with which he spent the next five years. During his voyage home in 1933 he met Lorna Elizabeth Paterson, daughter of Walter Moncrieff Paterson; Wingate married her on 24 January 1935 (having in the interim broken an earlier engagement). In 1936 he successfully applied for an intelligence post in Palestine where an Arab revolt had broken out directed at both the British mandatory authorities and the growing numbers of Jewish settlers. His time in Palestine was the turning point in Wingate's career. He found there a cause&#151;Zionism&#151;to which he became passionately attached, and a patron, Major-General Archibald Wavell, the general officer commanding (GOC) in Palestine in 1937&#150;8, who saved him from the professional consequences of that attachment. He also discovered a type of soldiering with which he was henceforth to be associated&#151;later to be known as special operations. The Arab irregulars were difficult targets for conventional British infantry units. Wingate proposed new formations which became known as special night squads (SNS). Commanded by British subalterns and NCOs, these units drew their rank and file from among the Jewish settlers. Like the Sudan defence force, also a British-officered local formation, the SNS depended on careful training and high morale as well as the willingness and ability of junior officers to show initiative. Flexibility, mobility, and tactics that deprived the enemy of what had previously been a safe environment&#151;the darkness&#151;were SNS hallmarks. Wavell, whose conventional exterior masked a complex personality with much sympathy for the unorthodox, cast a protecting mantle over Wingate. Once Wavell's tour as GOC ended, however, Wingate's prickly nature (&#145;Wingate was never an easy subordinate&#146;, Wavell would later write; <span class="italic">DNB</span>) and his outspoken commitment to Zionism, made him, in many eyes, a liability. He left Palestine in 1938 with a DSO, a wound suffered in an SNS action, and a professional future which was somewhat overshadowed by doubts in the small army world about his attitudes and behaviour.<h2>
<a name="AbyssiniaandGideonforce"></a>Abyssinia and Gideon force</h2>Wingate began the Second World War as brigade major of a light anti-aircraft brigade. He had been out of the military mainstream for fully half of his sixteen-year career. This, and his recent problems in Palestine, might have permanently sidetracked him, but for Wavell, who, now a full general, had become commander-in-chief, Middle East, at the outbreak of the war. When Italy entered the conflict in June 1940 Wavell resolved to turn to account the smouldering unrest in the highlands of recently occupied, but incompletely pacified, Abyssinia. Wingate's experience on the Abyssinian border while with the Sudan defence force and recent exploits in Palestine made him a natural choice for this type of work. Now a major, he arrived in Khartoum in November 1940. Over the next few months he gathered and trained a force that would accompany the emperor Haile Selassie back into Abyssinia, part of a three-pronged assault on the shaky Italian position there. Wingate's brigade-sized command, an amalgam of British-officered Sudanese regulars and British-trained Abyssinian levies&#151;and christened &#145;Gideon force&#146;&#151;went into action in January 1941. Over the next five months, culminating in the emperor's re-entry into his capital on 5 May, Gideon force fought, manoeuvred, and bluffed much larger enemy forces into retreat, defeat, and surrender. Although the Italian forces were mostly local levies of dubious (and eroding) loyalty, and the main burden of the campaign was carried by the regular forces under generals Platt and Cunningham, Gideon force had shown many of the characteristics Wingate had inculcated in the SNS&#151;flexibility, mobility, and an aggressive determination to hit the enemy. During the campaign, however, Wingate also displayed a quarrelsomeness with superiors, an occasionally overbearing way with subordinates, and some uncertainty in handling larger formations that arose from the fact that his previous experience had been with small units. Moreover, his embrace of the emperor's cause was so intense that it raised again the issue, lingering from Palestine, of his reliability. The campaign over, he was awarded a bar to his DSO, and sent quickly back to Cairo. There his career nearly ended in tragedy. Exhausted, depressed by his removal from command, ill with malaria, and overusing an early anti-malarial drug, he attempted suicide in his hotel room. Although he was found rapidly enough to be saved, it seemed the end of his army career. Wavell was gone, sacked by Churchill and rusticated to India. Wingate returned to England, a convalescent officer with a very uncertain future.<h2>
<a name="BurmaandtheChindits"></a>Burma and the Chindits</h2>Wingate's career was salvaged by his own determination, Wavell, and the Japanese. Wingate persuaded a medical board that he was fit for active service. Wavell, whose Indian command suddenly faced a Japanese attack for which it was almost entirely unprepared, remembered the aggressive, unorthodox soldier he had known (and occasionally rebuked) in Palestine and Cairo. The British collapse in Malaya and Burma made the need for talented commanders so urgent that it overrode any concerns that Wingate's past history might have aroused. By the time he reached India, however, he had time for only a hasty reconnaissance of central and north Burma, much of it conducted from the air as the British retreated. To these impressions of the country, he added his earlier experiences and the result was the theory of long range penetration (LRP).<br>
<br>LRP married light infantry tactics to the availability of air transport and radio communication. Wingate's &#145;columns&#146;&#151;each basically an infantry company with attached personnel&#151;would enter Burma through the gaps in the thin Japanese forward defences, and manoeuvre deep in the enemy rear, co-ordinated by radio, disrupting communications, especially the north&#150;south railway in the Irrawaddy valley that was the spinal cord of Japanese logistics in Burma.<br>
<br>Wingate's idea appealed to Wavell, a believer in the offensive and unorthodox approaches to it. Wavell also, throughout his time as a theatre commander in the East, rather oddly underestimated the Japanese and what their defeat would require. From his scarce stock of reasonably good infantry battalions in India, he gave Wingate two, one British and one Gurkha. After intensive training they were ready early in 1943 but the major offensive by regular formations that Wingate was to facilitate had been postponed. Wingate pleaded with Wavell to launch the operation anyway as an experiment in LRP tactics. Wavell agreed and in February 1943 Wingate led his <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95557', "Chindits")</script>, some 3000 strong (their name derived from a mythical Burmese temple guardian), across the River Chindwin. The columns penetrated easily into lightly occupied north Burma and cut the railway at a number of points. Wingate then extended his original plan into a crossing of the Irrawaddy. Once east of the great river, in nearly waterless country with the aroused Japanese closing in, he was forced to break his columns into smaller &#145;dispersal groups&#146; which filtered back to India over the next several months. Casualties were high (a quarter of the force was lost) and the damage done to the Japanese transient. The consequences of the raid were, however, inversely proportional to its actual results. The Japanese began to think of a pre-emptive strike against the growing British base area around Imphal&#151;Wingate's jumping-off point. It was the first step towards their disastrous 1944 offensives. Wingate's impact on his own high command was even more dramatic.<br>
<br>The prime minister, long dissatisfied with Wavell, had decided to replace him. Wingate emerged from combat to confront&#151;again&#151;the loss of a patron, but quickly found a potent replacement. In a theatre scarred by repeated defeats, the Chindits were a success story avidly seized upon by publicists in New Delhi and London. Wingate, who had always shown skill in using personal contacts to circumvent official channels, sent a copy of his official report to Leopold Amery, the secretary of state for India and Burma, whom he had met before the war (Amery was a keen supporter of Zionism). Amery gave it to Churchill, who suddenly saw a gleam of light in what he had characterized as a &#145;welter of lassitude and inefficiency&#146;  (Churchill to Ismay, 24 July 1943, TNA: PRO, PREM 3, 143/8). Wingate was flown home, met Churchill, and was added to his entourage for the voyage to the Anglo-American summit at Quebec in August 1943 (the &#145;quadrant&#146; conference).<h2>
<a name="Thespecialforce"></a>The special force</h2>The remaining eight months of Wingate's life generated controversy that reverberated for half a century after his death. Churchill, under American pressure to restore land communications with China by reconquering at least north Burma, found in Wingate an irresistible trump card. Wingate's own passionate advocacy won him crucial American material support. In a few short weeks he had been awarded a second bar to his DSO, and transformed by the media, the needs of alliance politics, and his own persuasive skills from a largely unknown brigadier to the commander (as an acting major-general) of a corps-sized special force, supported by a dedicated air component, the American &#145;air commando&#146;, and expected to play a major role in offensive operations in 1944&#150;5. He had also the right of direct appeal to the prime minister and the support of the newly designated allied supreme commander in the theatre, Vice-Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten.<br>
<br>By October Wingate's much expanded force was actively training. The will and determination that had always driven Wingate on were never so marked as during this period when, despite a severe bout of typhoid, he conjured the special force into existence, racing against time. His charisma impressed itself on many, but his high-handedness, noted in Abyssinia, became more pronounced, and bred lasting animosities. He was slighting about the quality of the Indian army and heedless of the disruption his demands entailed for other commanders and formations. He demonstrated to the full his intolerance of those who stood between him and his goal. Moreover, as on the eve of the first Chindit expedition, the operational context was changing adversely. The Japanese operation taking shape against the British forward positions in Assam led the brilliant Lieutenant-General W. J. Slim to switch his Fourteenth Army from an offensive to a defensive posture, planning to absorb and crush the Japanese attack before launching his counter-thrust. There was now no main force advance for the special force to aid&#151;or to aid it. None the less, the momentum which had built up behind Wingate&#151;Churchill's patronage, American expectations, and the assembly and training of over 20,000 high-quality troops&#151;was too great to stop. With the Japanese offensive against Imphal about to open, Wingate's second Chindit expedition (codenamed Thursday) was launched on 5 March 1944. It rivalled in complexity any British&#150;American airborne operation in the European theatre. Less than three weeks after its successful beginning, Wingate was killed on 24 March in the crash of an American bomber in which he was travelling. Thereafter, without his drive, vision, and leverage at the top, the Chindits, although marching and fighting with epic courage, and suffering considerable misuse at the hands of the American commander, Lieutenant-General Joseph W. Stilwell, played a role very different from that envisioned by Wingate. On 6 July 1944 Wingate's remains, and those of the others who died with him, were buried at the crash site in Assam. In 1950 they were exhumed and, under the terms of a British&#150;American agreement covering such cases, reinterred (on 10 November) at Arlington national cemetery in Washington, DC. Wingate was survived by his wife, Lorna, and a son, <a href="#cosubject_74917">Orde Jonathan Wingate [<i>see below</i>]</a>, born posthumously.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Wingate's military thought involved the use of widely separated light infantry formations whose mobility would be enhanced by air transport and resupply while the cohesion of their operations would be ensured by a sophisticated radio network. Although he did not invent these concepts he carried their development rapidly forward. The weakness of the special force was the weakness of all &#145;light&#146; formations. Without rapid support from heavier units they lacked sustainability in prolonged operations. Wingate set the limit of their operational commitment as twelve weeks. Even this may have been optimistic. After his death it was cruelly exceeded. His gifts were a courage, dynamism, vision, and fire that evoked in many a lasting devotion. His imperiousness, uncompromising ruthlessness, and failure to recognize the limitations of the formations and tactics he espoused were the defects of these qualities. Churchill and Wavell used the word &#145;genius&#146; in describing his abilities. The explorer Wilfred Thesiger, who served under him in Abyssinia, may have best captured his contradictions, picturing him as a crusader &#145;fighting with a mad gleam in his eye to liberate the Holy City, but equally determined, when it fell, to be crowned King of Jerusalem&#146;  (Thesiger, 351).<br>
<br>Wingate's only child, <a name="cosubject_74917"></a><span class="headword">Orde Jonathan Wingate</span>  (1944&#150;2000), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 11 May 1944 in Aberdeen. His godfathers were Chaim Weizmann and Haile Selassie. During his childhood he saw little of his mother, as she travelled abroad as a Zionist propagandist. In 1956 she remarried, and Wingate spent his adolescence partly on a farm in East Lothian. Educated at Ampleforth College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, he served in the Royal Artillery, retiring with the rank of major in 1978. In 1976 he married Holly Isabel Barton; they had two daughters. He then became a stockbroker and headhunter, and in 1990 was appointed commanding officer of the Honourable Artillery Company (the territorial arm of the Royal Artillery) as lieutenant-colonel. He retired in 1996. Wingate was devoted to the memory of his father, from whom he inherited a strong facial resemblance; he defended his father's reputation&#151;which he considered traduced by the official history of the Burma campaign&#151;and was joint patron with the prince of Wales of the Chindits Old Comrades Association. Nevertheless, in 1996 he sold at auction his father's papers and medals. Wingate was a complex, emotional man, prone to brooding and to expressing his views forcibly, but also impulsive, affectionate, and encouraging. He died on 6 September 2000, survived by his wife and their two daughters.<br>
