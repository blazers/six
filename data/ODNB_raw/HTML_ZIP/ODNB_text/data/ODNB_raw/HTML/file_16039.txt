<span class="headword">Langton,  Christopher</span>  (1521&#150;1578), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at Riccall in Yorkshire. He was educated at Eton College between 1534 and 1538, and on 23 August 1538 went as a scholar to King's College, Cambridge. He was admitted a fellow of King's College a week later than all the other scholars of his year, on 2 September 1541, and graduated BA in 1542. He received his last quarterage as a fellow at Cambridge at Christmas 1544. Langton married Margaret Chambers of London, the marriage licence being issued on 11 January 1546.<br>
<br>On 10 April 1547, in London, Langton published <span class="italic">A very brefe treatise, orderly declaring the principal partes of phisick, that is to say, thynges natural, thynges not naturall, thynges agaynst nature</span>, with a dedication to Edward, duke of Somerset, in which he describes himself as &#145;a lernar and as yet a yong student of physicke&#146;. The work discusses anatomy, pathology, and therapeutics according to ancient and modern methods, commending Pliny and quoting Hippocrates, Aetius, Paulus Aegineta, Celsus, Galen, and Avicenna.<br>
<br>In 1550 Langton published <span class="italic">An Introduction into Phisycke, wyth an Universal Dyet</span>. It is dedicated to Sir Arthur Darcye, and is largely based on the earlier work. One other book appeared: <span class="italic">A Treatise of Urines, of All the Colours Thereof, with the Medicines</span> (1552).<br>
<br>Langton took his MD at Cambridge in 1552, and was admitted a fellow of the College of Physicians, London, on 30 September 1552. However, he was expelled from the college for breach of the statutes and profligate conduct on 17 July 1558. On 16 June 1563, having been caught in a compromising situation with two young women, he was punished by being carted to the Guildhall and through the City. His professional ability must have been considerable, for in spite of this public disgrace he continued to have a successful medical practice. Lord Monteagle gave him a pension; both Sir Thomas Smith and Sir Richard Gresham were his patients; the latter left him a small legacy.<br>
<br>Langton died in 1578, and was buried in London at St Botolph's Church without Bishopsgate, on 26 October.<br>
