<span class="headword">Cobden,  Edward</span>  (1683&#150;1764), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and writer</span>, the son of William Cobden, a gentleman, and his wife, Kathern, was born in July 1683 at Haslemere in Surrey and baptized there on 15 July. He was educated at Winchester College, and matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, on 19 November 1702, graduating BA in 1706 and proceeding BD and DD in 1723. In 1713 he incorporated at Cambridge, taking the MA degree as a member of King's College. After entering holy orders he became chaplain to Edmund Gibson, bishop successively of Lincoln (1715&#150;23) and London (1723&#150;48). From 1711 to 1727 he was vicar of Sandon, Hertfordshire, a position which he held in plurality with that of Buckden, Huntingdonshire (1720&#150;27). In 1721 he was advanced to the prebendal stall of Erpingham in the cathedral church of Lincoln, and he remained a canon of Lincoln until his death. Following the translation of Bishop Gibson to London Cobden acquired further preferments in rapid succession: the rectory of Acton, Middlesex, in 1726; a canonry of St Paul's Cathedral in 1727; and the rectory of St Augustine with St Faith, London, in 1730. He succeeded Dr Tyrwhitt as archdeacon of London in 1742, and became president of Sion College in 1751. He married a daughter of the Revd Thomas Jessop, of Tempsford, Bedfordshire; she died in 1762.<br>
<br>Cobden gained an early reputation as a poet. Several of his school compositions survive, among them <span class="italic">Duodecim scruporum lusus, Anglic&egrave;: a Game at Draughts</span> (1701), and in 1703 he published an encomium upon the recently completed chapel of Trinity College, Oxford. His tributes to &#145;Spot, a Favourite Cat&#146; (1715) and to Joseph Addison (1720) were executed with feeling. However, he soon became better known as a fashionable preacher, who often addressed topical subjects, including the reformation of manners, hospital building, and the religious education of children. Cobden's pronounced high-churchmanship is evident in his first published theological work, <span class="italic">A Letter from a Minister to his Parishioner, upon his Building a Meeting-House</span> (1718), in which he warned sternly that &#145;separation from our Established Church is contrary to the Laws of God&#146;  (Cobden, <span class="italic">Discourses</span>, 1.305) and that wilful schism remained sinful, notwithstanding the legal indulgence provided by the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span>. He was a friend of Dr Daniel Waterland, whom he described as &#145;alterum Athanasium&#146;  (ibid., 2.269), and in 1739 he published <span class="italic">The Instruction Afforded by the Church of England Considered</span>, a sermon preached in St Mary-le-Bow at the Hutchins lecture, an annual high-church forum. Cobden maintained a high doctrine of episcopal ministry, pointed deliberately against the dissenters, in an address, <span class="italic">Sacerdotii delegatio, officium et dignitas</span>, delivered to the London clergy in 1752. Several of his later published poems celebrate the memory of King Charles I, the royal martyr, and Queen Anne, founder of the bounty to the clergy.<br>
<br>Despite these sympathies, and despite unwavering loyalty to his old schoolfellow Edward Holdsworth, whose open refusal to take the oath of allegiance to King George I was praised in <span class="italic">A Letter to the Author of the &#145;Muscipula&#146;</span> (1718), Cobden was personally no Jacobite. He glorified the house of Hanover in verses of 1715 and 1727, and dismissed the Jacobite rising of 1745 as &#145;an insolent and dangerous rebellion&#146;  (Cobden, <span class="italic">Discourses</span>, 1.288). After his appointment as a chaplain-in-ordinary to King George II in 1730 Cobden became a noted court preacher. His sermon &#145;Of waiting for our change&#146; was delivered in December 1737, only three weeks after the death of Queen Caroline, but in 1748 he forfeited royal favour by preaching &#145;A persuasive to chastity&#146;, a sermon on <span class="roman">Genesis</span> 39: 9, which many thought was intended to reflect on the king himself. Unmoved by fierce criticism Cobden duly published the text, contending that &#145;nothing in the sentiment or expression will be found unworthy of the sacred Function of a Preacher of the Gospel, or the serious attention of a Christian Assembly&#146;  (Cobden, <span class="italic">Persuasive</span>). He was never forgiven, and although he continued to preach at court, and gave one notable final sermon, <span class="italic">A Dissuasive Against Popery</span> (1751), advancing years and mounting resentment at the meagreness of his reward led him in 1752 to resign his place. In 1757 he printed <span class="italic">Discourses and Essays, in Prose and Verse</span>, dedicated to his parishioners at Acton and at St Augustine with St Faith: this included several previously unpublished sermons, including a group of nine on the beatitudes, and a large quantity of verse, previously collected as <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> (1748). Cobden died on 22 April 1764.<br>
