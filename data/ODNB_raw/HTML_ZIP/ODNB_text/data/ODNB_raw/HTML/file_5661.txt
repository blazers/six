<span class="headword">Clifford,  Rosamund</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Fair Rosamund]</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1140?, <em>d.</em> 1175/6), <span class="occ">royal mistress</span>, was the daughter of Walter Clifford and Margaret, daughter of Ralph de Tosny, and was born probably before 1140. She is linked to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12949/', "Henry II")</script> by a grant, recorded in the hundred rolls of 1274, made by the king of the manor of Corfham to Walter Clifford, &#145;for the love of Rosamund his daughter&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rotuli hundredorum</span>, 2.93&#150;4); but her time living openly as the king's mistress was short indeed. Gerald of Wales, writing just before 1200, said that soon after Henry II had been reconciled with his sons (1174), he imprisoned his wife, Eleanor, and &#145;having long been a secret adulterer, now openly flaunted his mistress, not that rose of the world [<i>rosa-mundi</i>] of false and frivolous renown, but that rose of unchastity [<i>rosa-immundi</i>]&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gir. Camb. opera</span>, 4.21&#150;2). Elsewhere Gerald says that Rosamund was still young when she died, and his contemporary Roger Howden states that, for the love of her, Henry II bestowed many benefits on the convent of Godstow (on the Thames just north of Oxford), where she was buried, and adds that the king gave the convent, which was previously impoverished, many valuable endowments including &#145;noble buildings&#146;. These grants are well documented in the pipe rolls and Godstow's cartulary: they include two churches at Wycombe and Bloxham and substantial sums of money for building materials from 1175/6 to 1177/8, suggesting that Rosamund died in the first of those accounting years. At about the same time Walter Clifford granted valuable assets to the abbey including several mills and a meadow for the souls of his wife and his daughter Rosamund. And about 1180, according to the English register of Godstow, Bernard de St Val&eacute;ry granted the king the patronage of the abbey &#145;by a silken thread [cloth] whereof was made a chasuble&#146;  (Clark, 1.129&#150;30), so that Rosamund's resting-place was henceforth a royal foundation. The results of this patronage became apparent to Hugh, bishop of Lincoln, when he visited Godstow Abbey in 1191. Here he found Rosamund buried in a magnificent tomb adorned with hangings, lamps, and wax candles, and set in the middle of the church choir in front of the high altar. Disgusted at such profanation he gave orders for her body to be disinterred and reburied outside the church. Higden and others say that she was placed in the chapter house, where her tomb had the inscription:<blockquote>
<div>This tomb doth here enclose the world's most beauteous Rose,<br>
</div>
<div>Rose passing sweet erewhile, now nought but odour vile.<br>
</div> (Speed, 471)</blockquote>As the rhyme suggests, by the fourteenth century Rosamund Clifford had become a figure of romance and legend, much of it associated with her death. In the earliest account of this, in the mid-fourteenth-century <span class="italic">Croniques de London</span>, Queen Eleanor (who is here confused with Eleanor of Provence, the wife of Henry III) causes Rosamund to be bled to death in a hot bath at Woodstock, after which the king has her body interred at Godstow. Higden, in his colourful <span class="italic">Polychronicon</span>, describes how at Woodstock &#145;King Henry had made for her a house of wonderful workmanship, a labyrinth of Daedelian design&#146;  (<span class="italic">Polychronicon</span>, 8.52). But in spite of Henry's efforts to hide her from the jealousy of the queen, Eleanor tracked Rosamund down by following her silken embroidery through the maze. What happened next Higden did not know, only that Rosamund's death followed. Still later sources, of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, filled this gap in the story, representing the queen as confronting her beautiful rival and offering her the choice of death by poison or the dagger. Rosamund chose the poisoned bowl, and the grieving king buried her at Godstow. Here the bones of the real Rosamund may have remained until the Reformation, when John Leland (<i>d</i>. 1552), as cited by Dugdale, recorded that &#145;Rosamund's tomb at Godstow nunnery was taken up a-late. It is a stone with this inscription: <i>Tumba Rosamundae</i>&#146;  (Dugdale, 4.365). Leland's near contemporary Thomas Allen, who died in 1632 at the age of ninety, said that before its destruction her tomb had contained &#145;enterchangable weavings drawn out and decked with roses red and green, and the picture of the cup out of which she drank the poison, given her by the queen, carved in stone&#146;. Thomas Hearne, who preserved Allen's account, also recorded local tradition as still pointing out Rosamund's stone coffin in his own time (<i>c</i>.1711), although Hearne himself regarded it as &#145;no more than a fiction of the vulgar&#146;  (Hearne, 3.739).<br>
<br>A sketch of Everswell, adjoining Woodstock Palace, made by John Aubrey in the seventeenth century shows a complex of buildings with pools, a cloister, and a garden. Woodstock was a favourite residence of Henry II and the pipe rolls record that substantial sums were expended on the palace, grounds, and spring during his reign. The spring was known later as &#145;Rosamund's well&#146;, and nearby was a building first called &#145;Rosamund's chamber&#146; in a pipe roll of 1231. It is likely that much of the villa complex in this area, including its cloister and pools, was laid out by Henry II, perhaps inspired by the rural pavilions of the Norman kings of Sicily. Another influence may have been the romance of Tristan and Isolde, a version of which was probably written for the king. Tristan and Isolde meet in secret in an orchard, and communicate by dropping twigs into the stream that runs through her chamber. Everswell's buildings included a similar orchard, spring, and bower for the secret meetings of Rosamund and Henry II.<br>
