<span class="headword">Baker,  John</span>  (1725/6&#150;1771), <span class="occ">flower painter</span>, was, according to Joseph Farington's notebooks, born in Larkners Lane, Holborn, London; his father was a coach-painter who died while he was a child. The family business was maintained by his mother, who entered a partnership with a Mr Brookshead, to whom John was apprenticed. He was later employed as a coach-painter and worked with John Sykes at Little Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields.<br>
<br>However, Baker was best-known as a flower painter. According to Edward Edwards &#145;his productions had considerable merit, although they were too much marked by that sharpness of touch, which is peculiar to all those who have been bred coach-painters&#146;  (Edwards, 38). He exhibited pictures with the Society of Artists from 1762 to 1768 and he was a founder member of the Royal Academy (1768), where he also exhibited works [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94593', "Founders of the Royal Academy of Arts")</script>]. With his wife, Elizabeth, Baker had a daughter, Sally, and a son, John, whom he took as an apprentice, and who also trained as a painter at the Royal Academy Schools. The apprenticeship binding of John Baker junior records his father's address as Denmark Street, in the parish of St Giles-in-the-Fields. According to Farington's notebooks John Baker was short and &#145;much marked by the small pox. His manners were such as are seen in the inferior ranks of Society&#146;, though his &#145;professional skill caused him to be looked to with respect&#146;. He died in London on 30 April 1771, and soon after an example of his work, <span class="italic">Still Life with Flowers</span>, was presented to the academy by Charles Catton (Royal Academy). The academy provided charitable financial support for his widow, and helped to pay for her funeral in 1804.<br>
