<span class="headword">Lacroix,  Alphonse Fran&ccedil;ois</span>  (1799&#150;1859), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born at Ligni&egrave;res, in the canton of Neuch&acirc;tel, Switzerland, on 10 May 1799. His father died between 1799 and 1805, and Lacroix was brought up by an uncle, M. Chanel. He was educated privately and then at a mission seminary in Berkel, near Rotterdam. In 1816 he became a tutor in Amsterdam and there learned of the Tahitians' abandonment of their idols, whereupon he was stirred to offer himself for missionary labour. He arrived in the Dutch colony of Chinsura, Bengal, in March 1821, as the sole Indian representative of the Netherlands Missionary Society. On 17 May 1825 he married Hannah, daughter of Gregorius Herklots (1768&#150;1852), a native of Bremen and fiscal or mayor of Chinsura.<br>
<br>On 1 March 1827, following Chinsura's transfer from Dutch to English control, Lacroix joined the London Missionary Society (LMS). Two years later he shifted to Calcutta. He was a tall, strikingly handsome man and an animated, expressive talker which, coupled with his fluency in Bengali, ensured him a reputation as an eloquent street-preacher in Calcutta and its surrounding villages and on the swampy islands of the Sundarbans. A persuasive opponent of education and proselytization solely in the English language, Lacroix devoted many hours to revising the existing Bengali translations of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and ran theological classes in Bengali at his home.<br>
<br>In December 1841 Lacroix travelled with his family to Europe for the first and only time. He toured Britain, France, and Switzerland, and in Geneva he raised considerable funds for itinerant preaching in Bengal. He returned to India in January 1844. In September 1855, as one of the longest-serving and most popular missionaries in Calcutta, he presided over a session of the General Conference of Protestant Missionaries. In 1856 the LMS invited him to retire to England, but he declined the offer. Nevertheless, his health was failing and he died on 8 July 1859 at his home, 55 Upper Circular Road, Calcutta. His interment at the dissenters' burial-ground, also in Circular Road, was attended by almost 1000 mourners of all Christian denominations.<br>
<br>Lacroix was survived by his wife and several children, including a daughter, Hannah Catherine (1826&#150;1861), who married the LMS missionary Joseph Mullens. In 1862 Mullens published an affectionate memoir of his father-in-law.<br>
