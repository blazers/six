<span class="headword">Goodenough,  Ethel Mary <span class="st"> [Angela]</span></span>  (1900&#150;1946), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 12 January 1900 in India and baptized on 14 February at Simla, in the Siwalik hills of northern India, the daughter of Captain Herbert Lane Goodenough (<i>d</i>. before 1946) of the Indian army and his wife, Muriel Grace, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mitford (<i>d</i>. after 1946). She was privately educated and in 1918 joined the civilian staff at the Admiralty in London, becoming an established civil servant at the end of the war. She held a number of posts, preferring that of assistant secretary to Sir Oswyn Murray, secretary to the Admiralty, as this brought her closer to the Royal Navy, her main interest, for there were several serving officers among her relatives. Angela Goodenough, as she was generally known, gained a detailed working knowledge of the Admiralty and made many friends among the naval staff, who were later to prove invaluable. In 1937 she was appointed chief woman officer, responsible for the welfare of all female civil servants and for recruiting temporary staff.<br>
<br>Goodenough's experience and knowledge of the Admiralty led to her appointment in April 1939 as deputy director in the newly created Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS). Her appointment was popular among naval staff and her contacts proved very useful when negotiating conditions for the fledgeling service. She was principally concerned with welfare, including clothing and accommodation, and for relations with the press, a side of the work in which she took great pride and interest. Her strong views on what was required, coupled with a great determination and a happy knack of getting her own way without rows, laid the foundations for the good welfare conditions in the service. After a second deputy director was appointed, she remained in charge of welfare aspects until autumn 1944.<br>
<br>As the war in the East intensified, a senior officer was required to oversee the welfare of the growing number of Wrens posted to the region. Goodenough was selected and, although she was reluctant to leave the familiar circumstances of the Admiralty, she accepted the appointment as superintendent on the staff of the commander-in-chief, East Indies, and in September 1944 left for Ceylon. She made a great success of the job, finding happiness and many new friends. She contracted infantile paralysis, however, and, after two days suffering from what was thought to be a light fever, she became unconscious and died in Colombo on 10 February 1946. She was buried there the following day with a full captain's bodyguard, the funeral being attended by over 200 Wrens and a large number of naval officers. Later in the month the WRNS directorate arranged memorial services at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, and at St Andrew's Cathedral, Singapore, both of which drew many of her friends from the Admiralty and naval services.<br>
