<span class="headword">Roberts,  Alexander</span>  (1826&#150;1901), <span class="occ">biblical scholar</span>, was born at Marykirk, Kincardineshire, on 12 May 1826, the only son of Alexander Roberts, a flax spinner, and Helen Stuart. He was educated at the Old Mains of Fasque public school in Aberdeen, then from 1843 at King's College, Aberdeen, being the top bursar (scholar) in his year. He was awarded the Simpson prize in Greek, took firsts in classics and philosophy, and graduated with an MA in 1847. He then trained at New College, Edinburgh, for the ministry of the Free Church, and was elected minister of Stonehaven Free Church in 1852. Between 1857 and 1871 he served as minister for the presbyterian church at Carlton Hill, St John's Wood, London. On 2 December 1852 he married Mary Anne Speid (<i>d</i>. 1911), a librettist, who died on 18 January 1911, aged seventy-seven. They had fourteen children, of whom four sons and eight daughters survived him.<br>
<br>On 28 October 1871 Roberts succeeded John Campbell Shairp as professor of humanity at St Andrews University, having been made DD of Edinburgh in 1864 on the strength of his <span class="italic">Inquiry into the Original Language of St Matthew's Gospel</span> (1859) and <span class="italic">Discussions on the Gospels</span> (1862). Between 1870 and 1884 he was a member of the committee of revisers of the Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, the edition subsequently known as the Revised Version, and he published several textual critical works in relation to this: <span class="italic">The Words of the New Testament</span>, in conjunction with William Milligan, another reviser (1873); <span class="italic">Companion to the Revised Version of the English New Testament</span> (1881); and <span class="italic">Old Testament Revision</span> (1883).<br>
<br>Roberts co-operated with Sir James Donaldson as editor and part translator of the English versions of ecclesiastical writers published as the <span class="italic">Ante-Nicene Christian Library</span> (24 vols., 1867&#150;72). He also translated <span class="italic">The Works of Sulpitius Severus</span> in the <span class="italic">Select Library of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers</span> (vol. 2, 1895). He published several works in which he maintained that Greek, not Aramaic, was the language in which Jesus taught, a theory which he believed supported the divine inspiration of the gospels: <span class="italic">Inquiry into the Original Language of St Matthew's Gospel</span> (1859); <span class="italic">The Bible of Christ and his Apostles</span> (1879); <span class="italic">Greek the Language of Christ and his Apostles</span> (1888); and <span class="italic">A Short Proof that Greek was the Language of Christ</span> (1893). Other published works were <span class="italic">The Threefold Life</span> (1858); <span class="italic">The Life and Work of St Paul Practically Considered</span> (1867); and <span class="italic">Hints to Beginners in Latin Composition</span> (1873).<br>
<br>Roberts was made emeritus professor in 1899, having resigned from his chair in September. In the spring he had suffered a fall, after which he became arthritic and almost immobile. He died at his home, St Andrews, Mitcham Park, Surrey, on 8 March 1901, survived by his wife.<br>
