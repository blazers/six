<span class="headword">O'Connell,  Morgan</span>  (1804&#150;1885), <span class="occ">soldier and politician</span>, second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20501/', "Daniel O'Connell (1775&#150;1847)")</script> and his wife, Mary (1778&#150;1836), was born in Tralee, co. Kerry, on 31 October 1804. Together with his elder brother, Maurice, he was a student at the Jesuit Clongowes Wood College from early 1815 but did not apply himself to his studies. In 1819 General John Devereux was in Dublin to enlist military aid for the revolution in South America. He succeeded in embodying the Irish South American legion, and O'Connell was one of the officers who purchased a commission in it. The second contingent of the legion reached the Spanish main in June 1820, with O'Connell in the position of aide-de-camp to Devereux. At Barranquilla in late August 1820 he obtained an introduction to Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var, to whom he presented a letter of greeting and support from his father, dated 17 April 1820. Following a series of mishaps O'Connell arrived home safely in early 1822, still aged only seventeen. Apprenticeship to an attorney and cadetships in the French and British forces having been considered and rejected by the family, O'Connell set out on a career in the Austrian army. He served with them in northern Italy and in Hungary before returning to Ireland in 1830.<br>
<br>On 19 December 1832 O'Connell entered parliament for County Meath as a supporter of his father's policy of repeal of the union, and continued to represent that constituency until January 1840, when he was appointed assistant registrar of deeds for Ireland. Soon after, he married, on 23 July 1840, Kate Mary, youngest daughter of Michael Balfe of South Park, co. Roscommon. They had no children. In 1846, following representations by his father, he was appointed registrar of deeds, a position he held until his retirement in 1869. During his parliamentary career he fought a duel with William, second Baron Alvanley, a lieutenant-colonel in the army, at Chalk Farm on 4 May 1835. A challenge had been sent by Alvanley to O'Connell's father, who, in accordance with a vow he had made after killing a man in a similar affair of honour, declined the meeting. Morgan thereupon took up the challenge: two shots each were exchanged, but neither party was hurt. Afterwards, in December 1835, O'Connell declined to meet a challenge from Benjamin Disraeli, in consequence of an attack made on Disraeli by Morgan's father.<br>
<br>Morgan O'Connell died at his home, 12 St Stephen's Green, Dublin, on 20 January 1885, and was buried in Glasnevin cemetery on 23 January.<br>
