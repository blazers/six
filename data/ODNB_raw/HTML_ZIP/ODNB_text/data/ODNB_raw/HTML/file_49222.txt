<span class="headword">House,  John <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>  (1906&#150;1991), <span class="occ">journalist and writer</span>, was born on 16 May 1906 at 13 Deerpark Gardens, Tollcross (subsumed in 1912 into the city of Glasgow), the eldest of eight children born to English parents, John House, a company secretary, and his wife, Georgina Tindle Thomson; his upbringing was solidly middle-class. He attended Whitehill secondary school in Dennistoun, where he formed ambitions to become an author, actor, or artist. However, he finally acceded to his father's demand that he train to be an accountant. This, though, was not to his taste, and by 1928 he was working as a reporter and feature writer on the <span class="italic">Glasgow Citizen</span> newspaper.<br>
<br>The first major feature by House covered one of John Logie Baird's demonstrations of his new television technology at Glasgow University. He later recalled that the journalistic corps attending thought that this innovation, though interesting, would not amount to much. House also covered many major news events in the city, including the Glen cinema fire of 31 December 1928 in which eighty children died. He continued to work as a journalist on Glasgow's evening newspapers&#151;<span class="italic">The Citizen</span>, the <span class="italic">Evening Times</span>, and <span class="italic">The News</span>&#151;and also in light entertainment for the BBC. In the 1930s House's interest in the theatre resulted in the publication of <span class="italic">Eight Plays for Wolf Cubs</span>. This passion never left him, and later in life he acted with the Scottish National Players. In the Second World War he served as lance-corporal in the Gordon Highlanders before moving to the army cinematographic unit. Here he worked as a scriptwriter for propaganda films alongside, among others, Peter Ustinov and David Niven.<br>
<br>After the war House returned to Glasgow and to journalism and, increasingly, to book publication. His knowledge of his home city (and its surrounding areas) was encyclopaedic, and he had huge affection for the place. This, combined with his lively and infectious writing style, meant that he published prolifically in the thirty years following the end of the war. In a period when Glasgow was better known for its poverty, grime, sectarianism, and violence, in books such as <span class="italic">The Heart of Glasgow</span> (rev. edn 1965) and <span class="italic">Glasgow Old and New</span> (1974) Jack House enthusiastically championed the character of Glasgow's people as well as the city's history, culture, and architecture. Indeed, he recounted that, on showing John Betjeman round Glasgow, the poet exclaimed that this was &#145;the greatest Victorian city in the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Heart of Glasgow</span>, 20). Key to his success was his willingness to spin a yarn. Although he treated facts as &#145;sacred&#146;, he also maintained that &#145;if there's a good story I'm going to tell it, whether there's an iota of factual evidence or not&#146;  (ibid., 27). Thus, in <span class="italic">Heart of Glasgow</span>, he described the city's foundation by St Mungo in the style of a medieval romance. Another key was drink; in the same book he did not flinch from relating the various ways, both ingenious and highly dangerous, that Glasgow's drunks had found to remain inebriated despite abject poverty. House was not, however, censorious; he spent a lot of time in the many bars around Glasgow's city centre, and the liveliness he found here informed his writing as much as it cemented his popularity.<br>
<br>Together with Moray McLaren, a friend from Edinburgh, House formed the All Saints Club. Consisting of 100 members split evenly between Edinbrovians and Glaswegians, this was formed for the purposes of keeping the old feud between the two cities going. Although the rivalry among the All Saints was friendly (House thought it remarkable that &#145;in a country as small as Scotland you should find two such completely divergent towns less than fifty miles apart&#146;) there was the occasional edge; the difference between Glasgow and Edinburgh, he once told the lord provost of Edinburgh, &#145;is that Edinburgh has culture for 3 weeks of the year while Glasgow has culture for fifty-two&#146;  (<span class="italic">Heart of Glasgow</span>, 17).<br>
<br>Jack House was not sentimental about Glasgow, however, and retained a fascination from his earlier journalistic days for crime, particularly murder. In <span class="italic">Square Mile of Murder</span> (1961) he explored four murders which occurred in the west end of the city, including the case of Oscar Slater, who was wrongly convicted of murder. In the four cases he examined he found a common thread to be a concern for respectability at the expense of honesty.<br>
<br>Though his writing was seldom overtly political House was a member of the Liberal Party, and stood unsuccessfully for the Liberals at the Glasgow Woodside by-election of 1963. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s he was heavily involved in campaigning against the building of the M8 motorway through the centre of the city, which destroyed, among other places, much of the Anderston and Charing Cross areas. He was prescient in the early 1970s in describing the peripheral estates of Easterhouse, Castlemilk, and Drumchapel as slums of the future. About this time he was worried that Glasgow was losing its &#145;city-state&#146; feel, and expressed a nostalgia for the town that he thought had been disappearing since the last tram ran in 1962. House married a fellow journalist, Jessie Bennet Millar (<i>d</i>. 1974). There were no children from the marriage.<br>
<br>House continued writing into his later years. In 1981 he published his first novel, <span class="italic">The House on the Hill</span>, an adaptation of the successful Scottish Television series of the same name. His last, and fifty-fourth, book, <span class="italic">Music Hall Memories</span>, was published to celebrate his eightieth birthday in 1986. During the 1980s he continued to write a column for the Glasgow <span class="italic">Evening Times</span>, &#145;Ask Jack&#146;, in which he answered questions from readers (on which often rested a wager) about people, places, and events in Glasgow's history. In 1988 he was awarded the St Mungo medal by the city council in honour of his services to Glasgow. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Glasgow in 1978. He died in the Western Infirmary, Glasgow, on 11 April 1991 after a short illness.<br>
<br>Despite a faintly ludicrous appearance, with buck teeth and a lazy eye, House was a memorable figure. His enduring legacy, according to fellow journalist, Jack McLean, was to have defended Glasgow's working-class culture at a time when the city was perceived by many to be beyond the pale. There was some irony in his being born technically outside Glasgow, of English parentage, and into a middle-class milieu, but the respect for him among the city's people was genuine.<br>
