<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kett,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1492&#150;1549), <span class="occ">rebel</span>, was the fourth son of Thomas Kett, of Forncett, Norfolk, butcher and landholder (<i>c</i>.1460&#150;1536), and his wife, Margery. His family was descended from the gentry family of Le Chat or Cat which can be traced back in the county to at least the early fourteenth century. That the Wymondham family from which Robert was descended was known as Kett alias Knight might suggest an earlier episode of illegitimacy. <br>
<br>Little is known of Kett's early life. Although his immediate family was no longer gentle, he was a man of some wealth. He lived in Wymondham as a tanner, the description given him in contemporary accounts of the rising that took his name. Tanning was a trade that could require a significant level of investment; Tudor chroniclers suggested that his moveable property was worth 1000 marks (about &pound;670). Kett also had extensive landholdings, including manorial interests, at Wymondham, in whose manorial court he was prosecuted for enclosing lands, which were said to be worth &pound;50 a year. His tax assessments in the 1540s suggest lower levels of wealth. But in their ranking they confirm that Kett, with his brother William, who combined the trades of mercer and butcher at Wymondham, was among the wealthiest members of his community. Both brothers were members of the local guild of St Thomas Becket. Taken together, these shards of evidence suggest that Kett exercised a role and authority in his immediate surroundings commensurate with his wealth and that known to have been exercised by the middling sort of the period. He married, probably before 1515. His wife, Alice, with whom he had up to five sons and who survived him, has been tentatively identified as the daughter of Sir Nicholas Appleyard of Bracon Ash. If this identification is correct, it would confirm that Kett was a man of rising prosperity. <h2>
<a name="Kettsrebellion"></a>Kett's rebellion</h2>In July 1549 rebellion broke out in Norfolk, to which Kett lent both name and leadership. The rising began with an attack on local enclosers, but swelled to a gathering of many thousands which camped at Mousehold Heath outside the regional capital of Norfolk from 10 July until final defeat by a royal army on 27 August. Although it is clear that there had been several earlier episodes of crowd action, the rising's beginnings have traditionally been dated to the celebrations held at Wymondham from 6 to 8 July to commemorate St Thomas Becket. Among the enclosers attacked there was John Flowerdew of Hethersett. Flowerdew, a successful lawyer, was locally unpopular because at the dissolution he had partially demolished the abbey at Wymondham which served also as the parish church. Tradition has it that Kett, who is known to have named one of his sons after the last abbot, Loye Ferrers, and who was said to have played a leading role in trying to prevent the despoliation of the abbey, became involved in the rising as a direct consequence of the feud with Flowerdew. When Flowerdew paid his attackers to throw down Kett's enclosures, Kett was said to have agreed to their destruction and to have offered himself as leader of the protesters. The protesters then decided to march to Norwich, a decision attributed (without supporting evidence) to Kett, where contemporary estimates put their numbers at anywhere between 16,000 and 20,000. <br>
<br>The scale and discipline of the rising have been attributed to the qualities of Kett's leadership&#151;&#145;the force of personality of a great leader of men&#146;  (Bindoff, 3). But there is little direct or independent evidence of Kett's role. A later legal case provides a rare glimpse of Kett proceeding out of the camp to the sound of drums to greet a contingent from the Norfolk village of Tunstead, whose leader Kett appointed one of his captains. Joined (reluctantly, it was claimed) by several of Norwich's leading citizens, Kett issued written warrants, copies of which have survived, for the collection of supplies of food and weapons, and, it was alleged, for the destruction of enclosures and detention of local gentry. In these warrants Kett and the others referred to themselves as the king's &#145;amici ac delegati&#146; (&#145;friends and deputies&#146;) and to their assembly as &#145;the King's Great Camp&#146;  (Russell, 47 and n., 107). The protesters also established a representative council which drew up the famous list of grievances, with at their core concern for the rights of commoners and manorial tenants, to which Kett's name is first signatory. Most famously, Kett was said to have dispensed justice beneath a tree, which came to be called the &#145;oak of reformation&#146;, on both disorderly followers and unpopular local gentleman (who were imprisoned in a mansion on nearby Mount Surrey which later came locally to be called Kett's Castle). As the survival of a &#145;writ&#146; from Kett to Yarmouth's rulers requesting their assistance in resolving an inheritance dispute suggests, Kett's role at the oak of reformation provided a court for others seeking justice. <br>
<br>Kett's refusal of a royal pardon and the defeat of a royal army at the end of July marked a decisive change in the politics of the revolt. Late in August the arrival of another royal army, under the command of the earl of Warwick, led to his defeat after a fierce and bloody battle and to widespread repression. Kett was said to have abandoned Mousehold Heath for Dussindale in response to a prophecy that was thought to augur good fortune for the forthcoming battle:<blockquote>
<div>the countrie gnuffes, Hob, Dick and Hick<br>
</div>
<div>with clubes and clouted shoon,<br>
</div>
<div>Shall fill up Dussindale with bloud<br>
</div>
<div>of slaughtered bodies soone.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Holinshed's Chronicles</span>, 1038)</blockquote>In so doing he threw away his previous advantage over Warwick's cavalry. The evidence for the prophecy, like the report of an ill omen presaged by a snake falling from a rotten tree into Kett's wife's bosom, comes from hostile &#145;histories&#146; of the rebellion; it is more likely that Kett's move was forced by the threat to his supply lines. <br>
<br>Kett was captured the day after the battle. By early September he and his brother William were prisoners in the Tower of London. On 26 November both were found guilty of treason by a special commission of oyer and terminer. By 1 December they had been returned to Norwich for execution. On 7 December 1549 Kett was hanged from the walls of Norwich Castle, while his brother was hanged from the steeple of Wymondham church. Following a post-mortem inquisition, whose panel included his old enemy John Flowerdew, held in January 1550, Kett's lands were seized by the crown and later given in reward to Lord Audley for his part in Kett's capture. <h2>
<a name="Kettssignificance"></a>Kett's significance</h2>Kett and the rising that took his name are bound together in a way that makes it impossible to discuss the one without the other. But it is important to note that the events in Norfolk were but the largest of a series of protesters' camps both elsewhere in East Anglia and in the south-east. His signature always appeared first on the various commands and articles of the protesters, which makes it clear that Kett played a prominent role. But Kett was not, as he is sometimes portrayed, the only leader of the rebellion. The subsequent labelling of the events first as Kett's camp and later as Kett's rising probably exaggerates Kett's leadership and obscures that of others. In a letter written shortly before the final battle, the duke of Somerset referred to &#145;ket and the other Archtraitours&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 523, fol. 52<i>r</i>). In addition to the known leaders of the other camps in Norfolk and Suffolk, there must have been a hierarchy of command in which Kett was joined by others. One such was John Wythe, a copyholder and headborough of Aylsham in Norfolk, denounced as &#145;the notablest offender that was in the time of rebellion&#146;  (Beer, <span class="italic">Rebellion and Riot</span>, 205) and sentenced to be hanged on his own door. The terse records of the subsequent judicial repression reveal the names of these other leaders, but not their role in the rebellion. <br>
<br>Nevertheless, writing on 1 September 1549, immediately after the rising's suppression, Somerset could refer to &#145;One Kett, a tanner, being from the beginning the verie chief doer&#146;  (Russell, 214). It was the government's decision to try Kett alone with his brother that identified the man with the movement. Thus in subsequent written accounts Kett was made to lend his name to the rising. Existing studies of Kett's rebellion have perhaps failed adequately to acknowledge that the record of Kett's role throughout the rising rests heavily on (near-) contemporary &#145;histories&#146; whose provenance deserve more critical interrogation. Authorship of the first of these histories has been attributed to a member of the Sotherton family of Norwich, part of the city's ruling circle, whose purpose was in part to exculpate Norwich's leading citizens from any complicity in the rebellion. The second &#145;history&#146; was written by Alexander Neville, secretary to Matthew Parker, archbishop of Canterbury, who before his elevation had attempted to pacify the disorders by preaching to the rebels. Kett's role therefore has been written almost entirely from hostile sources. <br>
<br>Given the total absence of any firsthand testimony by Kett, during either the rising or the judicial proceedings against him, it has been Kett's fate to have motives attributed to him that reveal more of successive authors' attitudes and of interrelated shifts in political allegiance and historical interpretation. For Alexander Neville writing in the 1560s, Kett was &#145;of an impudent boldnesse, an unbridled violence&#146;  (Neville, B3<i>r</i>, D3<i>r</i>), while in the Elizabethan Holinshed's chronicle Kett was described as &#145;a man hardie and forward to anie desperat attempt that should be taken in hand&#146;  (<span class="italic">Holinshed's Chronicles</span>, 1028). These were descriptions interchangeable with those of any who dared to disregard the early modern culture of obedience. They were clearly at considerable variance with the historical record, sketchy though it is. Even Sotherton was prepared to acknowledge that Kett admonished the protesters &#145;to be ware of their robbinge [and] spoylinge&#146;  (Beer, &#145;The commoyson&#146;, 83). But by the time of the English revolution Kett's vilification in print had meant that his was a name that could be invoked, along with those other bogeymen of the English landed classes, Wat Tyler and Jack Cade, to dissuade the English from opposing their king and letting loose again the many-headed monster of the people. <br>
<br>Knowledge of Kett thereafter was kept alive by a curious form of local patriotism. This had seen the translation of Neville's original Latin account by a Norfolk minister and its subsequent reprinting, together with more popular accounts printed locally, a tradition that continues to the present with celebrations of Kett in print and poetry. In the short term, Kett's body, hanged in chains from the castle walls and left to rot, provided an immediate mnemonic; cases of sedition, prosecuted in Norwich in the immediate years after the rebellion, reveal a submerged plebeian tradition among those who had been Kett's supporters which fondly remembered the &#145;merry world&#146; of Mousehold Heath and held &#145;Robert Kett &hellip; an honest man&#146;  (Rye, 22, 25). In the longer term the decision of Norwich's authorities to make 27 August an annual day for the ringing of bells in the city's many churches, and for a religious service commemorating their salvation (the latter continuing into the eighteenth century), helped to preserve a memory of Kett which functioned both as an inspiration for later radical movements within the city and as an object of early genteel tourism. <br>
<br>It was the publication of the Reverend Frederick Russell's 1859 study of <span class="italic">Kett's Rebellion in Norfolk</span> that marked an important shift in Kett's reputation nationally. In part a product of that tradition of local patriotism&#151;Russell had spent his childhood in Norwich fascinated by local reminders of &#145;Kett the hero&#146;&#151;the work drew on the accounts of Sotherton and Neville, but added greatly to them from his own original archival work. Russell saw in Kett a man who had led a struggle against the feudal system who, though &#145;commonly considered a rebel, yet the cause he advocated was so just, that one cannot but feel he deserved a better name and better fate&#146;  (Russell, viii). His judgement that Kett's &#145;great misfortune had been to live before his time&#146; set the tone for much subsequent work that relied heavily on his researches. In their sympathies for Kett subsequent writers reflected both broader political shifts and the ability of the English to celebrate rebels&#151;once dead. Kett, now an &#145;idealist and visionary&#146; and moved by his &#145;hatred of mastery and thraldom and his love of equality and brotherhood&#146;, was claimed as an early (albeit Fabian) socialist, leader of an uprising &#145;waged by the peasants, with courage and with characteristic good temper and moderation, against their enemies the landowners&#146;  (Clayton, 69, 62, 11). Thus taken up by successive reformulations of the left, Kett achieved his apotheosis at Norwich on the occasion of the four-hundredth anniversary of the rising in the erection of a plaque &#145;in reparation and honour to a leader in the long struggle of the common people of England to escape from a servile life into the freedom of just conditions&#146;. But the rediscovery of Kett as an ancestor by a late Victorian Tory mayor of Cambridge could result also in the publication of a family genealogy which resurrected Kett as a servant of the people whose &#145;high traditions&#146; the family continued and which led, in its turn, to the erection in Cambridge of Kett House, an office block built in the 1960s, whose end wall is decorated with a large modernist sculpture depicting Kett at the oak of reformation. <br>
<br>In the translation from traitor to popular hero, Kett himself remains a shadowy figure. His long afterlife has allowed successive writers to fashion him after their own interests, reading out from the blunt fact of rebellion his personal, political, and even physical attributes, for which little or no direct evidence exists. But at the core of the story of Kett lies a profound mystery. Why, in a political culture where rebellion could end on the gallows, should a man, then in his late fifties, himself an encloser, and whose wealth placed him on the borders of gentry status, offer himself as the head of a rising of the commons? A re-evaluation of the politics of the protests of 1549 offers some answer. The leaders of other &#145;camps&#146; in East Anglia, as well as identifiable names among Kett's delegates, were drawn from a similar background, of some wealth and accustomed to exercise authority locally. Kett may have shared their sense of alienation from a local gentry who, engaged in a vigorous extension of seigneurial rights, threatened the interests of wealthy and poorer tenants alike. Protests in 1549, informed by a belief that popular grievances were shared by a royal government whose policies and pronouncements had encouraged a popular expectation of reform, sought to negotiate with, rather than to challenge, royal government. Kett's description of Mousehold Heath as &#145;the King's Great Camp&#146;, and his concern for justice and good governance in the fashioning of the protest, suggests that he shared both beliefs and objectives. At the first offer of pardon by the royal herald sent to Norwich, Kett was said to have replied, &#145;kings &amp; princes were accustomed to grant pardons to such as are offendors &hellip; he trusted that he needed not anie pardon, sith he had done nothing but that belonged to the dutie of a true subject&#146;  (<span class="italic">Holinshed's Chronicles</span>, 969). The words may well be apocryphal, but they suggest that Kett saw himself not as a rebel but as an ally of royal government in the defence of the commonwealth against oppression by the landed class and in the pursuit of justice and good government. It was this political role that he constructed for himself that perhaps helps to explain the government's otherwise improbable accusation that Kett had &#145;taken upon hym our royall power and dignitie and calleth himselfe M[aste]r and king of Norfolk and Suffolk&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Vespasian F iii, fol. 46). The judgement of the most recent history of Kett's rebellion that Kett was politically na&iuml;ve and &#145;showed not the least comprehension of the realities of national politics&#146;  (Cornwall, 240&#150;41) fails to do justice to his political strategy. Kett became a victim of the changed political circumstances that followed from the duke of Somerset's need to secure his own political survival by a demonstration to his fellow nobles of his ability to restore order. Paradoxically, it was Kett's death as a traitor that both preserved his memory and sealed his obscurity.<br>
