<span class="headword">Garton, Sir  Richard Charles</span>  (1857&#150;1934), <span class="occ">chemist and brewer</span>, was born at 11 Richmond Place, Bedminster, Somerset, on 8 October 1857, the eldest of five sons of William Garton (1832&#150;1905) a brewer, and his wife, Ellen Miller, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Littleton. William Garton's company, Garton Hill, pioneered the production of saccharin, or invert sugar, at Southampton in 1855. Richard was educated at Owens College, Manchester, and at Marburg University, Germany, where he studied the problems of fermentation in brewing. He made an early study of chemistry, and later became involved in the application of modern chemistry to the brewing and sugar industries. He was a pioneer in the manufacture of liquid glucose (corn syrup), the development of which, in the confectionery trade, he did much to foster. A practical brewer of great ability, his knowledge and advice were sought by many companies. He provided financial assistance to institutions founded to advance the science and practice of brewing, such as the Institute of Brewing, of which he was vice-president, the School of Brewing at the University of Birmingham, and the Sir John Cass Institute of London. He provided financial support and gave advice to the council of the Brewers' Society and the National Trade Defence Association, and encouraged brewery companies to adopt a policy of public-house reform. In 1902, when the brewing industry was experiencing difficulties, Garton was invited to join the board of Watney, Combe, Reid &amp; Co. Ltd as a director. He was appointed deputy chairman in 1924 and chairman in 1928, but ill health forced him to relinquish the post in 1932, though he remained on the board. He was also a director of E. Lacon &amp; Co., a brewery in Great Yarmouth, permanent governing director of Garton, Sons &amp; Co., and a director of Manbr&eacute; and Garton Ltd, brewing-sugar manufacturers of Battersea. Considered a financial expert, he was for some years a director of Lloyds Bank Ltd.<br>
<br>In 1900 Garton unsuccessfully contested Battersea as a Conservative. A staunch unionist, he was president of the Haslemere branch of the Unionist Association, and of the Constitutional Club. In 1912 he established the Garton Foundation for the study of international relations, especially the relation of military and political power to social and economic advantage. Knighted in 1908, he was created a GBE for his war services in 1918. Although he took a minor role in the public life of Haslemere, he was a generous supporter of local organizations and institutions. Garton had married in 1883 Nellie (<i>d</i>. 1925), daughter of Andrew Durrant of Bishops Hall, Chelmsford. They had two daughters. In memory of his wife he built the children's ward of Haslemere Hospital, and later added a nurses' hostel. He presented the town with a steam fire engine, which he later replaced with a motorized one.<br>
<br>Sir Richard was one of the founders of the British Empire Cancer Campaign. His gift of &pound;20,000 set the campaign up in 1923 and he thereafter served as its honorary secretary and chairman of its finance committee. In 1928 he paid for the entire cost of the International Conference on Cancer, which was attended by over 600 delegates. In connection with his investigations into cancer, he established the Garton prize of &pound;500 and medal in 1931. He was honorary secretary and treasurer of the King's College for Women department of household and social science in the University of London.<br>
<br>Sir Richard made a hobby of collecting seventeenth- and eighteenth-century drinking glasses, which were exhibited at the Educational Museum, Haslemere, in 1932. Yachting and horse-racing were his chief sports, and he later devoted much time to the breeding of racehorses. Not long before his death he took over the Brook stud at Newmarket, intending to breed on a large scale, but he became very ill and died at his home, Lythe Hill, Haslemere, on 22 April 1934, survived by his daughters. He was buried at Haslemere parish church on 25 April.<br>
