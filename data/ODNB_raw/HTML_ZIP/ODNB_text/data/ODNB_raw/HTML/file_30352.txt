<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ainger,  Alfred</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Doubleday]</span>  (1837&#150;1904), <span class="occ">writer and Church of England clergyman</span>, born at 10 Doughty Street, London, on 9 February 1837, was the youngest of the four children of Alfred Ainger (1797&#150;1859) and his first wife, Marianne Jagger (<i>d</i>. 1839) of Liverpool. His father, an architect of scientific tastes, who designed the first University College Hospital in London (demolished and rebuilt 1900&#150;06), was a Unitarian of Huguenot descent. His mother, who was musically gifted, died two years after her son Alfred's birth; his father married again and had a second family. After attending University College School the younger Alfred went in 1849 to Joseph King's boarding-school at Carlton Hill, London, where he fell under the two potent influences of Charles Dickens and Frederick Denison Maurice. His schoolmaster took him to hear Maurice preach, and he turned from his father's Unitarianism to the Church of England. Dickens's sons were Ainger's schoolfellows at King's school, and with them he visited their father. Dickens early discovered the boy's dramatic gift, and for several years Ainger was his favourite dramatic pupil, acting with him and Mark Lemon in the amateur performances which Dickens organized at his home, Tavistock House. At sixteen Ainger went to King's College, London, where Maurice was professor both of divinity and of English literature. Literature now absorbed him, particularly the writings of Charles Lamb and George Crabbe. Devotion to Shakespeare manifested itself early and in 1855 he became the first president of the college's Shakespeare Society. In October 1856 he matriculated at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, with a view to a legal career. Henry Latham and Leslie Stephen were tutors of his college, and Henry Fawcett&#151;soon to be Ainger's close friend&#151;was elected a fellow in the year of Ainger's entrance. At Cambridge, Ainger became the leading spirit of a literary circle which included Hugh Reginald Haweis, Horace Smith, and A. W. Ward. He was a foremost contributor to <span class="italic">The Lion</span>, a short-lived undergraduate magazine (3 nos., 1857&#150;8) which Haweis edited. His Shakespearian criticism and his skit there on Thomas Babington Macaulay attested to his literary gifts and brilliant humour. Also at Cambridge he came to know Alexander Macmillan, at that time a bookseller in Trinity Street and afterwards the famous London publisher.<br>
<br>Ainger's health allowed him to do no more than take the ordinary law examination (in June 1859). He graduated BA in 1860 and MA in 1865. After his father's death in November 1859, and partly on the advice of his friends, Leslie Stephen among them, he took holy orders. In 1860 he was ordained deacon and soon after became curate to Richard Haslehurst, vicar of Alrewas, in Staffordshire. In 1863 he was ordained priest, and from 1864 to 1866 was assistant master in the Collegiate School at Sheffield. In the autumn of 1865 he competed successfully for the readership at the Temple, London, and held the post for twenty-seven years.<br>
<br>Both Ainger's sisters married early, the younger, Marianne, to a German named Wiss, and the elder, Adeline, to Dr Roscow of Sandgate, who died in 1865. Shortly after Ainger's resettlement in London (1867) he experienced the greatest sorrow of his life at the sudden death of Adeline, his widowed sister. The shock aged him prematurely and turned his hair white. He became the guardian of his sister's four children&#151;two girls and two boys&#151;and devoted himself to their care. In 1876 he moved to Hampstead, where he lived with his two nieces, Ada and Margaret Roscow, and where he became friends with the artist of <span class="italic">Punch</span>, George Du Maurier. That companionship provided him with a definite field for his wit, and he constantly suggested the jests which Du Maurier illustrated. The poet Tennyson, and Charles John Vaughan, the master of the Temple from 1869, also formed part of his circle, and he was elected a member of the Literary Club, which had been founded by Samuel Johnson.<br>
<br>Ainger's own position in literature became established by his publications. At twenty-two he contributed his first successful article, &#145;Books and their uses&#146;, to an early number of <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>  (1, 1859&#150;60, 110). He took the whimsical pseudonym Doubleday (doubled A). Eleven other articles appeared under the same friendly auspices between 1871 and 1896. From 1900 to 1904&#151;the last years of his life&#151;he was a regular contributor to <span class="italic">The Pilot</span>, a weekly journal edited by D. C. Lathbury.<br>
<br>Ainger's chief writings dealt with the life and work of Charles Lamb. His monograph on Lamb was published in 1882, in the <span class="roman">English Men of Letters</span> series (rev. and enlarged, 1888). There followed editions of <span class="italic">Lamb's Essays</span> (1883), <span class="italic">Lamb's Poems, Plays, and Miscellaneous Essays</span> (1884), and <span class="italic">Lamb's Letters</span> (1888; new edn, 1904), the last the only collection which at the time of publication could lay claim to completeness. His life of Lamb and his edition of Lamb's writings were carefully researched, but he omitted passages from the collection of writings which jarred with his view of Lamb's character. He contributed the articles on Charles and Mary Lamb, Tennyson, and George Du Maurier to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. In a remark which became famous he summed up, in a speech at a dinner of the contributors (8 July 1897), the dictionary's character in the motto, &#145;No flowers, by request&#146;. Three years later Ainger was one of forty writers present at a dinner hosted by the prince of Wales to celebrate completion of the dictionary. The prince, who was not a great reader and had little in common with his guests, took to scanning the table for more interesting company. According to Max Beerbohm the prince is said to have spotted Ainger and asked Sidney Lee, the dictionary's editor, &#145;Who's the little parson? Vy is <i>he</i> here?&#146;, to which Lee replied that Ainger was a very great authority on Lamb. &#145;This was too much for the prince. He put down his knife and fork in stupefaction; a pained outcry of protest heaved from him: &#147;On <i>lamb</i>!&#148;&#146; (S. N. Behrman, <span class="italic">Conversations with Max</span>, 1960, quoted in J. Gross, ed., <span class="italic">The New Oxford Book of Literary Anecdotes</span>, 2006, 208).<br>
<br>As a lecturer on literary subjects Ainger was popular with cultivated audiences throughout the country, and from 1889 he frequently lectured at the Royal Institution; his titles included &#145;True and false humour in literature&#146;, &#145;Euphuism, past and present&#146;, and &#145;The three stages of Shakespeare's art&#146;. In 1885 the University of Glasgow conferred upon him the honorary degree of LLD, and he was made an honorary fellow of his college, Trinity Hall.<br>
<br>During his last twenty years Ainger's influence as a preacher grew steadily. In 1887 he became a canon of Bristol. He was appointed select preacher of Oxford in 1893, and in the same year bad health compelled him to resign his readership at the Temple. He consequently accepted the living of St Edward's at Cambridge. Again illness speedily forced him to retire, and he spent two months travelling in Egypt and Greece. In June 1894, on Lord Rosebery's recommendation, he was appointed master of the Temple in succession to Charles Vaughan. Subsequently his duties of preacher became the main concern of his life. In 1895 he was made honorary chaplain, in 1896 chaplain-in-ordinary, to Queen Victoria, and in 1901 chaplain-in-ordinary to Edward VII. His sermons in the Temple were marked by beauty of language and by a quiet, practical piety, impatient of excess. Neither high-church nor low-church, he professed an unaggressive, moderate evangelicalism.<br>
<br>In 1903 Ainger's health deteriorated after an attack of influenza, and at the end of the year he resigned his canonry at Bristol. He died of pneumonia on 8 February 1904 at Darley Abbey, near Derby, the home of his younger niece, Ada Roscow, who in 1896 had married an old friend, Walter Evans. He was buried in the churchyard of Darley Abbey.<br>
<br>Apart from the works already mentioned and articles in periodicals, Ainger was the author of a volume of sermons (1870), a selection of Tennyson's works for the young (1891), a biographical preface to an edition of Thomas Hood's poems (1893, 1897), an introduction to an edition of John Galt's <span class="italic">Annals of the Parish</span> (1895), and a monograph on Crabbe (1903) in the <span class="roman">English Men of Letters</span> series. After his death a volume of sermons, <span class="italic">The Gospel of Human Life</span> (1904), and <span class="italic">Lectures and Essays</span> (2 vols., 1905) were edited by H. C. Beeching, dean of Norwich.<br>
