<span class="headword">Ward,  William</span>  (1766&#150;1826), <span class="occ">printmaker</span>, was born in London, probably in Thames Street, near Southwark Bridge, the son of James Ward, a manager for a wholesale fruit and cider merchant, and his wife, Rachel (1736/7&#150;1835), and the elder brother of the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28686/', "James Ward (1769&#150;1859)")</script>. He was educated at the Merchant Taylors' School in London before being apprenticed to the printmaker John Raphael Smith. In 1781&#150;2 his brother James was also apprenticed to Smith, although William took over his brother's indentures when he left Smith in 1783. James worked as William's apprentice until 1791, and it has been suggested that some of the plates James engraved during his apprenticeship years were issued under William's name. About 1785 William and his brother moved with their parents and two unmarried sisters (a third sister had already married) to a house in the Harrow Road, near to J. R. Smith's establishment; by then William's printmaking work was sufficiently well established for him to take on another apprentice, Thomas Gosse. In August 1786 he married the artist Maria Morland, the sister of the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19278/', "George Morland")</script>, and a month later Morland married William's sister Anne; the two couples set up house together for a short time.<br>
<br>In 1792 William Ward bought two of his brother's paintings, <span class="italic">Compassionate Children</span> and <span class="italic">The Haymakers</span>, and the following year engraved and published prints after them. In 1799 the two brothers, with 50 per cent funding from a third partner, Dr Daw, formed a short-lived print publishing business, known as Messrs Ward &amp; Co. In 1804 William was appointed mezzotint engraver to the duke of York and in 1813 engraver to the prince of Wales; in 1814 he became an associate engraver of the Royal Academy. Ward engraved both in stipple and in mezzotint; during the 1780s he produced stipple and crayon manner prints, many printed in colours, after drawings by John Hoppner, J. R. Smith, George Morland, and others, as well as some of his own drawings, with titles such as <span class="italic">Thoughts on Matrimony</span> (1786) and <span class="italic">The Musing Charmer</span> (1787). Among his mezzotint works are plates after paintings by Morland, such as <span class="italic">A Visit to the Child at Nurse</span> (1788) and <span class="italic">A Visit to the Boarding School</span> (1789), as well as portraits and fancy pictures after contemporary painters such as Joshua Reynolds and Hoppner, notably such impressive pieces as <span class="italic">The Daughters of Sir Thomas Strickland</span> (1797) and <span class="italic">Mrs Michelangelo Tayler as &#145;Miranda&#146;</span> (1798), both after Hoppner. He also reproduced historical paintings, including work by Correggio and Murillo and plates after seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish artists such as Ferdinand Bol, Gerrit van Honthorst, and Rubens. Ward died on 1 or 21 December 1826 at his home in Warren Street, Fitzroy Square, London. The print rooms of the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum both hold collections of his prints. <a name="cosubject_28698"></a><span class="headword">Martin Theodore Ward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1799&#150;1874), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was William Ward's eldest son. He was trained as a painter under Edwin Landseer, and specialized in portraits of animals commissioned by members of the gentry and lesser aristocracy, showing their favourite hunting dogs, such as terriers, spaniels, and pointers, and horses. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1820 to 1825 and at the British Institution from 1819 to 1829, where he showed animal portraits as well as a few animal genre pieces with titles such as <span class="italic">The Painful Bite</span> (1821) and <span class="italic">The Intrusion</span> (1829). About 1840 he settled in Yorkshire, where he became noted for his eccentricity; he exhibited only once more, at the British Institution in 1858, and died in poverty in York on 13 February 1874.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_28714"></a><span class="headword">William James Ward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1800&#150;1840), <span class="occ">printmaker</span>, the second son of William Ward, was trained by his father and showed precocious talent, winning medals for drawing from the Society of Arts between 1813 and 1815. His work as a printmaker consists mostly of mezzotint prints after contemporary portrait painters such as Sir Thomas Lawrence, William Owen, and H. W. Pickersgill, although he also engraved the work of earlier artists, such as Van Dyck. He was made engraver to the duke of Clarence, but became insane some time before his death, on 1 March 1840.<br>
