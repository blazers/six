<span class="headword">Shrewsbury,  William James</span>  (1795&#150;1866), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born in Deal, Kent. His father was a grocer and tailor, his mother a former servant. He began his Methodist missionary career in Tortola in 1815 and stayed in the Caribbean for a further nine years. While he was in Tortola, in 1816, planters and slaveholders across the region were thrown into panic by a revolt among the enslaved population of Barbados, which they blamed in large part on the British anti-slavery campaign. During Shrewsbury's second posting to Grenada, from 1818, and his third in Barbados, from 1820, he faced restrictions on when and where he could preach to enslaved people because of the fears of many white West Indians that missionary activity would provoke further unrest. It was of great comfort to him when he married a local Methodist convert, Hilaria King (1801&#150;1835), on 1 January 1823.<br>
<br>Shrewsbury was not an outspoken critic of slavery in Barbados, but he came to be viewed as such. In August 1823 news reached Barbados of another major slave revolt in Demerara. Shrewsbury's services were disrupted and two masked horsemen fired on his Bridgetown chapel. A handbill called for the destruction of the chapel. Shrewsbury received warning of the plot and fled to the neighbouring island of St Vincent. The authorities there required Shrewsbury to provide testimonials to prove that he was not a subversive figure before allowing him to preach. These were used to great effect by Shrewsbury's supporters in Britain, where he returned the following year. In June 1825 Thomas Fowell Buxton, leader of the Anti-Slavery Society, introduced a Commons motion calling for the condemnation of Shrewsbury's persecution, the reconstruction of his chapel, and the protection of religious freedom in Barbados. The motion was given extensive coverage in the anti-slavery and missionary press and, reluctantly, Shrewsbury became a humanitarian <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>.<br>
<br>After a brief posting to Brighton, Shrewsbury was sent to Cape Colony in response to an appeal by William Shaw, Albany district's Wesleyan superintendent. Shrewsbury sailed there in 1824 with the pregnant Hilaria and their two children. He founded a mission named after the treasurer of the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society, Joseph Butterworth, adjacent to the homestead of the paramount chief Hintsa, some 100 miles to the east of the colonial frontier. At first Shrewsbury contrasted the Xhosa's hospitality with the animosity of the West Indian planters. However, once he found that his proselytization was of little interest to the independent Xhosa, he began to complain of their supposed flaws. His disillusionment intensified after his relocation to the Mount Coke mission station, in the midst of the area of greatest frontier tension.<br>
<br>During his time at Mount Coke Shrewsbury found some comfort in the society of the British settlers in Graham's Town. He was transferred there in 1833. The following year the Cape Frontier War of 1834&#150;6 broke out between an alliance of Xhosa chiefdoms and the British colony. Shrewsbury sided firmly with the settlers, forsaking any sympathy that he might have had with the Xhosa for the series of land losses and punitive raids they had suffered. When the commander of the colonial forces, Lieutenant-Colonel Harry Smith, asked a number of the missionaries who had lived among the Xhosa for their advice, Shrewsbury obliged. His suggestions included further confiscations of Xhosa land and property, the execution of those Xhosa who had killed British subjects in the war, and the putting to work of other &#145;offenders&#146; making roads through Xhosaland. In addition he recommended that all Xhosa wear identity tags, and that those without be considered hostile. The governor, Sir Benjamin D'Urban, enclosed Shrewsbury's recommendations in a dispatch to the sceptical humanitarian colonial secretary, Lord Glenelg.<br>
<br>In 1835 Shrewsbury returned to England, having asked for a recall on the grounds of Hilaria's poor health and the need to secure his children's future. But Hilaria died, apparently as a result of a miscarriage, just a week before they were to set sail. Soon after their return to Deal, Shrewsbury's youngest daughter also died. It was at this time that the controversy prompted by D'Urban's dispatch and Shrewsbury's enclosure erupted, as Buxton agitated for a parliamentary inquiry into the causes of the war in the Cape. In December 1835 the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society recorded its &#145;most entire and unqualified disapprobation&#146; of Shrewsbury's recommendations. Shrewsbury, who professed himself a broken man, was consigned to a British congregation in Boulogne for a year until the furore had died down.<br>
<br>After his return to England Shrewsbury had six more children with his second wife, Mary Ann, whom he married on 20 October 1837. While ministering in Yeadon, near Leeds, in 1852 he managed once again to have his chapel and home attacked. This time the &#145;mob&#146; comprised Methodist revivalists angered by Shrewsbury's attempt to bar them from the chapel that they had built. He died of chronic bronchitis on 25 February 1866 at 53 Higher Ardwick, Chorlton, Manchester, and was survived by his second wife. The obituary printed in the <span class="italic">Minutes of the Methodist Conferences</span> dwelt on his experience of persecution by slave-owners in Barbados rather than the controversy caused by his recommendations in the Cape. None the less, he remained something of a hero among the British settlers in the Cape for having spoken out against humanitarian interference.<br>
