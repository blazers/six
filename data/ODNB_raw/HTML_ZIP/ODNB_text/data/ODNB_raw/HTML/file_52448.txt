<span class="headword">Redfern,  William</span>  (1774/5?&#150;1833), <span class="occ">convict surgeon and pastoralist in Australia</span>, had relatives in Londonderry, Wiltshire, and possibly Canada, but details are unknown. He acquired the diploma of the London Company of Surgeons in January 1797 and immediately joined HMS <i>Standard</i> as surgeon's first mate. Later that year he provided medical care and probably moral support to the mutineers at the Nore. He was convicted of mutiny but his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment perhaps because of his professional association with the sailors and because of his youth and inexperience. Transported to New South Wales in 1801, he was sent to the penal settlement on Norfolk Island as assistant to the surgeon. Diligent work led to a free pardon in 1803, but he also acquired property, livestock, and probably a convict mistress before his transfer to Sydney in 1808.<br>
<br>Having been appointed assistant colonial surgeon, Redfern, aided by an apprentice, every morning saw all the inpatients at the hospital, as well as convict outpatients, and also supervised the dispensing of medicines and stores. Possibly at times to the detriment of his hospital responsibilities, he developed an extensive private practice, gaining the respect of colleagues and the confidence of patients of all classes. He remained socially unacceptable to the &#145;exclusivist&#146; civil and military officers despite his acceptance by Governor and Mrs Macquarie as &#145;our friend and family physician&#146;&#151;a rejection perhaps accounting for a reputedly brusque bedside manner.<br>
<br>Following the arrival of three &#145;sickly&#146; convict transports in 1814, Lachlan Macquarie directed Redfern to investigate. His report comprehensively exposed all aspects of convict maltreatment and mismanagement occurring during transportation. His recommendations for shipboard hygiene and medical care reflected the best naval practice of the period, but his most perceptive, and influential, suggestion was that only experienced naval surgeons should be employed on transports and they should have absolute authority over convict management. Its speedy adoption by the transport commissioners led to a marked decline in convict morbidity and mortality.<br>
<br>In 1810 Redfern reintroduced Jennerian vaccination to all parts of the colony, and from about this period onwards he supported various philanthropic and charitable organizations financially and professionally. A foundation shareholder and director of the colony's first bank, established in 1817, he survived criticism of using his position to personal advantage in a protracted controversy.<br>
<br>On 4 March 1811 Redfern married Sarah Wills at St Philip's Anglican church. Instead of developing a grant in what is now the Sydney suburb of Redfern, he developed grants at his property Campbellfield, in the Airds district, as a farm for sheep, cattle, and a variety of crops. Aided by John Grant, his one-time assigned servant, he gradually acquired large holdings west of the Blue Mountains, extending as far as the Lachlan River.<br>
<br>By the 1820s emancipists were making major contributions to the colony's economy and development. They were shocked by legal decisions in London and Sydney that civil and property rights were not restored by a colonial pardon. In 1821 Redfern became one of two emancipists deputed to present a petition to king and parliament. He had already suffered a severe blow to his pride and professional aspirations when Earl Bathurst rejected his appointment as principal surgeon in 1818, a position previously promised to him by Macquarie. Outraged, Redfern resigned and an embarrassed Macquarie appointed him a magistrate. J. T. Bigge, commissioned by Bathurst to report on the state of the colony and fundamentally antipathetic to the emancipist cause, objected to this elevation of an ex-convict. Macquarie obstinately persisted but Bathurst ultimately revoked the appointment. Meanwhile, Redfern had clashed with Bigge when he appeared to give evidence. He subsequently wrote, angrily refusing to appear again, accusing Bigge of arrogance and bias. It is to Bigge's credit that his reports commend Redfern's professional and farming attainments, although he deprecated his &#145;irritability or rather a violence of temper towards his inferiors and superiors&#146;  (Bigge, <span class="italic">Report of the Commission</span>, 86). In effect, Redfern personified the conflict between Bigge and Macquarie on the emancipist issue.<br>
<br>Unsettled, Redfern sold stock and property and took his elder son, William Lachlan (<i>b</i>. 1819) to Edinburgh, leaving his wife and younger son, Joseph Foveaux (<i>b</i>. 1823), at Campbellfield. As on his previous visit in 1822, he enrolled at Edinburgh University in 1829 and 1830, but Mrs Macquarie, who visited him, stated that he was behaving extravagantly and keeping poor company, and had deteriorated mentally and physically. He died in Edinburgh on 17 July 1833 and was buried there at the new Calton cemetery on 23 July. His will essentially left extensive property to his surviving son (Joseph died in 1830) with certain interests for his wife; a codicil in 1828 made some provision for two sisters and the children of one of them.<br>
<br>Redfern was keenly perceptive of injustice, probably a factor in his transportation, and to his involvement in other controversies. Despite his irascible nature he made an invaluable contribution to both the medical and the pastoral development of the colony while also contributing politically to the advancement of the emancipist cause. A play about Redfern's life, <span class="italic">The Emancipist</span>, by John Macquarie Antill and Rose Antill, was published in 1936.<br>
