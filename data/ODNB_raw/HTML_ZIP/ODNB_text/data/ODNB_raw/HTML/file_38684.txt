<span class="headword">Heckford <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Goff]</span>,  Sarah Maud</span>  (1839&#150;1903), <span class="occ">philanthropist, writer, and traveller</span>, was born at Blackrock, Dublin, on 30 June 1839, the youngest of the three daughters of William Goff (<i>d</i>. 1848), one time governor of the Bank of Ireland, and his wife, Mary Clibborn (<i>d</i>. 1845). The daughters were all educated at home. Pleasant-faced, though not pretty, with dark brown hair, Sarah contracted tuberculosis of the spine at the age of nine which left her with a hump on her right shoulder and slightly lame. A talented pianist, she also painted well and loved horses and riding.<br>
<br>William Goff left Ireland with his family in 1842, settling in Dresden. Mary Goff died in 1845 and her eldest daughter, Jane, soon afterwards. Their aunt Abigail Clibborn came out to look after Annie and Sarah. The family went to Switzerland, and in 1848 moved to Paris, where they were caught up in the revolution. From Paris they went to London where William Goff took rooms in Eaton Square, near his bachelor brother Robert. Shortly after Sarah's ninth birthday her father committed suicide. He had appointed his brother Robert (<i>d</i>. 1866) as the girls' guardian; they and Aunt Abigail moved in with him. Their father had insisted on regular lessons, but their uncle thought &#145;accomplishments&#146; all that girls needed, and their sole duty to make a good marriage. Sarah Goff revelled in music lessons and went regularly to the National Gallery to copy pictures there.<br>
<br>In 1859, after the death of their aunt, the sisters took a house in Warwick Square, Pimlico, London. Each having inherited money from their parents, they were independent. Sarah Goff had become a serious, intense, strong-minded young woman determined never to be handicapped by her lameness, but still under the influence of her elder sister. Fired by the women's movement she became a committed feminist. She wanted to train as a doctor but women could not matriculate at that time. Complaining bitterly about &#145;the barriers of young-lady-dom&#146;, she abandoned churchgoing and visited the poorer streets near her home trying to help the women and children there. After an unhappy love affair she began to explore the East End and was appalled by what she saw.<br>
<br>It was the cholera epidemic of 1866 which set Sarah Goff free from having her &#145;life choked out&#146; in respectable Belgravia. Both the Goff sisters answered Catherine Gladstone's appeal for nurses. Sarah, now twenty-six, was sent to the Wapping Fever Hospital, east of Tower Bridge, where Nathaniel Heckford was one of the doctors in charge. Born in Calcutta in April 1842, the son of Nathaniel Heckford, he was dark, good-looking, and easy-going, with a passion for children and animals. Finding Sarah poring over Gray's <span class="italic">Anatomy</span> on night duty, he encouraged her to study medicine, offering to tutor her for examinations. They were married at the Little Portland Street Unitarian Chapel on 28 January 1867.<br>
<br>With Sarah's money they founded the East London Hospital for Children and Dispensary for Women in two old warehouses in the Ratcliff Highway and lived on the premises. Sarah, who continued her medical studies, was the matron and attended women at home for their confinements. Dr Elizabeth Garrett (later Garrett Anderson) joined their staff the following year, a move strongly opposed in some quarters. Charles Dickens visited the hospital and the publicity he provided brought in funds that made possible a purpose-built hospital in Shadwell. In 1963 it was amalgamated with the Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children in Hackney.<br>
<br>In 1870 Nathaniel Heckford fell ill, and he died of tuberculosis on 14 December that year. The couple had no children but had adopted a girl of twelve, Marian Matthews Heckford, an orphan who had been a patient at the East London Hospital. Sarah Heckford worked on the plans for the new hospital and as a lady visitor at the existing one. In 1873 she published <span class="italic">The Life of Christ and its Bearing on the Doctrines of Communism</span>, which applied Christian principles to contemporary social problems. She was a quiet revolutionary, an idealist who abhorred violence, cruelty, and injustice, and had the courage of her convictions.<br>
<br>When the new hospital was complete Sarah Heckford settled most of her remaining capital on it. She went to Naples with Marian, then aged seventeen, who met and married a young lawyer there. Sarah Heckford travelled to India and worked for the zenana mission, which gave medical help to women in purdah. For more than a year she was the resident medical adviser to the begum of Bhopal. In 1878, after a bout of malaria, she returned to England. Purchasing shares in the Transvaal Farming, Mining, and Trading Association, she set sail for South Africa, intending to make her living farming. She arrived at Durban in December 1878, and travelled to Pretoria with a party of new settlers. On arrival they found they had been hoaxed and the farms they had been promised were non-existent. Short of money, she became a governess for two years on the farm Nooitgedacht. Then she bought a wagon, a team of oxen, and some trading goods and started for the Soutpansberg with only a driver and a small boy to lead the oxen. She did good trade and arrived back in Pretoria just before the outbreak of the Anglo-Transvaal War in December 1880. During the siege of Pretoria she went to the commander of the British garrison and offered to ride through the Boer lines with dispatches for General Colley, who was trying to reach the town from Natal. When he refused she retired to her wagon and passed the time writing her second book, <span class="italic">A Lady Trader in the Transvaal</span>, which was published in London in 1882. She was furious at the retrocession of the Transvaal after the end of the war in April 1881, and refused to remain under Boer rule. On her return to London she campaigned on behalf of the people she called the &#145;English Africanders&#146;, English-speaking farmers and traders who had been ruined and were being persecuted by the Boers.<br>
<br>In 1884 Sarah Heckford's novel <span class="italic">Excelsior</span> was published, which is thinly veiled autobiography. She also wrote <span class="italic">The Story of the East London Hospital</span> (1887) to raise funds, though she was no longer actively involved with it. She founded a co-operative store at Woolwich, based on the ideas of communism expressed in her book of 1873. She shared an interest in spiritualism and the occult with her friend Lady Sarah Nicholson, and took part in s&eacute;ances at the Nicholsons' home, where she went into trances and produced examples of automatic writing.<br>
<br>Before leaving South Africa, Sarah Heckford had bought a farm, Jackalsfontein, south of Pretoria. Hearing of the discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand, she returned to South Africa, where she spent most of the rest of her life. Finding there was no gold on Jackalsfontein, she tried to sell it to raise capital for a scheme for education and medical care among the farming community. Failing to find a buyer, she took a two-roomed shanty in Johannesburg and set up as a share broker, selling mining shares. With her greying hair cut in a short Eton crop, she became a well-known figure as she rode about town. Her timing was disastrous, and when the mines struck pyrites in March 1889 her business crashed, leaving her penniless. By the time the discovery of the cyanide process put the mines back into profitability she had sold out. She bought another wagon and span of oxen and rode transport again. This business thrived; she bought a farm, Ravenshill, in the Soutpansberg, and brought her friend Sarah Eland and her son out from England to settle on it. Sarah Heckford continued trading and transport riding. In the winter of 1891 she spent several months camping on the Klein Letaba goldfields. Using this experience she wrote and published <span class="italic">True Transvaal Tales</span>.<br>
<br>In 1893 Sarah Heckford rented another farm near Ravenshill and became friendly with Modjadje, the &#145;Rain Queen&#146;, being the only white person to penetrate her kraal. Once a house had been built on Ravenshill she and the Elands moved there in January 1894, but the area was disturbed by fights between the Boers and the Africans. Eventually she returned to Nooitgedacht where she became governess to the children of her former pupils. She was there when the South African War broke out in October 1899, and twice rode messages concerning the movements of the Boer forces to Lord Roberts. On the second occasion, aged sixty, alone and ill, she rode the 40 miles to Pretoria (which Roberts had taken in June 1900) in the course of one wintry day, warning the British at Commandonek on her way. She could not return to her farm, and remained in Pretoria to help reorganize and reopen the schools which had closed at the start of the war. She returned to her plans for farm schools and wrote a <span class="italic">Report on the educational needs of the Transvaal Colony from the Transvaal Women's Educational Union to the education department of the colony</span>. She finished it in March 1901, and it was sent to London.<br>
<br>Sarah Heckford then devised an adult-education programme for Boer women to be put in place after the war. In 1901 she went to London to buy a magic lantern and slides to illustrate the historical lectures she was writing for the scheme. She was violently opposed to Emily Hobhouse, who had protested against the British use of concentration camps during the South African War, and wrote to the papers with her own views. Requests to speak on South Africa poured in. Although an emotional speaker, she nevertheless had a firm grasp of facts and the ability to marshal them cogently. She also worked hard for the British Women's Emigration Society, urging teachers in particular to go out to South Africa after the war.<br>
<br>In spite of failing health and becoming blind in one eye Sarah Heckford continued to write and to travel the country on speaking engagements. By the end of 1902 she had completed her lectures and assembled the slides to illustrate them. Although clearly unwell she insisted on returning to Pretoria in February 1903, where she died on 17 April of the same year. She was buried in the old cemetery, Church Street East, Pretoria, on 19 April.<br>
