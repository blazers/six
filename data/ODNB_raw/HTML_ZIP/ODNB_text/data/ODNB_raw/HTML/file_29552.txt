<span class="headword">Williams, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1761/2&#150;1841), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, son of Captain William Williams RN (<i>d</i>. 1778), was in 1768 entered on the books of the sloop <i>Peggy</i>, commanded by his father, with whom he continued serving, nominally or really, in different ships on the Newfoundland and North America stations. In June 1776 he was with his father in the <i>Active</i> in the disastrous attack on Sullivan's Island. In 1777 he was moved into the <i>Prince of Wales</i>, flagship of Rear-Admiral Samuel Barrington, with whom he was in the engagements at St Lucia (15 December 1778) and Grenada (6 July 1779). On 8 December 1779 he was promoted lieutenant of the <i>America</i>, one of the ships with Sir George Brydges Rodney when he captured the Caracas convoy on 8 January 1780; after being sent home with the prizes, Williams went out to North America with Vice-Admiral Marriot Arbuthnot, and took part in the action of 16 March 1781.<br>
<br>In May 1781 Williams was appointed first lieutenant of the <i>Assurance</i>, which he commanded with some success for several months during the absence of her captain at sick quarters. On 15 April 1783 he was promoted commander of the <i>Rhinoceros</i>, which he took to England and paid off in March 1784. In June 1789 Williams was appointed to the <i>Otter</i>, employed in the North Sea; and on 22 November 1790 he was advanced to post rank. In December 1792 he was appointed to the <i>Lizard</i> (28 guns), and in August 1794 to the frigate <i>Daedalus</i>, both in the North Sea for the protection of trade, and to co-operate with the army in the Low Countries. For his good service in forcing a number of transports through the ice in the Ems in the winter of 1794&#150;5, and so relieving the forces at Emden, he was specially thanked by the Admiralty, and appointed, in July 1795, to the frigate <i>Unicorn</i> (32 guns), on the Irish station.<br>
<br>On 8 June 1796, while cruising on the Soundings, having under his orders the <i>Santa Margarita</i>, Williams fell in with two French frigates of nominally equal force. They split up and were separately followed by the two British ships; and while the <i>Santa Margarita</i> took one the <i>Unicorn</i> captured the other, the <i>Tribune</i>, which, under that name, was added to the British navy. The most extraordinary feature of the action was that though the <i>Tribune</i> was commanded by a capable seaman, and admirably manoeuvred, she did not succeed, in a running fight of several hours and a close combat of more than half an hour, in inflicting any casualties on board the <i>Unicorn</i>. She herself lost thirty-seven men killed and fourteen wounded. The reward of the double victory fell mainly to the senior officer, and Williams was knighted by George III in June 1796.<br>
<br>In March 1797 Williams was transferred to the frigate <i>Endymion</i> (40 guns), carrying 24-pounders on her main deck. On 12 October, the day after the battle of Camperdown, she joined the North Sea Fleet, and was immediately sent by the admiral to follow up the Dutch ships which had escaped. A few hours later she found the Dutch ship <i>Brutus</i> (74 guns), anchored inshore, and at once attacked her. The difficulty of the position, however, rendered it impossible for the inferior force to do anything effective; and when on the morning of 13 October the <i>Endymion</i> and the <i>Beaulieu</i> stood in to renew the attack, they were mortified by seeing the <i>Brutus</i> slip her cable and get into Goree. For the next three years the <i>Endymion</i> was employed on the Irish station and on convoy service to St Helena.<br>
<br>In December 1792 Williams married the beautiful Jane (1771&#150;1798), daughter of Edward Cooper (1728&#150;1792) and his wife Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Leigh (1736&#150;1783), the sister of Jane Austen's mother. In August 1798 in the Isle of Wight, by collision with a runaway dray horse, she was thrown from her gig and killed. In 1800 Williams married Miss Whapshare of Salisbury. She died at Brighton on 17 December 1824.<br>
<br>In February 1801 Williams was appointed to the <i>Vanguard</i> (74 guns), which in the summer was sent up the Baltic, and on her return was employed in the blockade of Cadiz. In 1804&#150;5 Williams commanded the <i>Neptune</i> (98 guns), in the channel; in 1806&#150;7 he had charge of the sea fencibles of the Gosport division; and in 1807&#150;8 was again in the <i>Neptune</i>.<br>
<br>On 25 October 1809 Williams was promoted rear-admiral, and from May to August 1810 had his flag in the <i>Venerable</i>, under the command of Sir Richard John Strachan. In August he hoisted his flag in the <i>Hannibal</i>, as second in command of the Channel Fleet, and in October was sent with a strong squadron to Lisbon to co-operate with the army occupying the lines of Torres Vedras. On the retreat of the French he returned to England, and in May 1811 hoisted his flag in the <i>Royal George</i>. In October he was appointed commander-in-chief at the Nore, where he remained for three years. He was made vice-admiral on 4 June 1814, KCB on 2 January 1815, admiral on 22 July 1830, and GCB on 13 September 1831. One of his last acts was to establish the Naval Female School for daughters of naval officers (first at Richmond Green, Surrey, later the Royal Naval School for Girls, Haslemere, and by 1995 the Royal School), to which he donated &pound;1000, the largest sum subscribed; he was the school's first president. Williams died at his home, Burwood House, near Weybridge, Surrey, in his eightieth year, on 8 October 1841.<br>
