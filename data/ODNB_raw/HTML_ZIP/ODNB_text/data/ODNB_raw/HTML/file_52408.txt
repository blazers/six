</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">McMichael, Sir  John</span>  (1904&#150;1993), <span class="occ">cardiologist</span>, was born on 25 July 1904 at the High Street, Gatehouse of Fleet, Kirkcudbrightshire, the third son and fifth child of James McMichael (1854&#150;1933), and his wife, Margaret Livingstone Sproat (<i>d</i>. 1929). His father was a butcher and small-time farmer who struggled to make ends meet but was, to use his son's words, &#145;a gentle God-fearing man of the kindest nature&#146;; both parents were committed to the moral precepts of the Church of Scotland and this had a strong influence on his early life.<br>
<br>McMichael's first teacher at Girthon School was William Learmonth, father of Professor Sir James Learmonth, the distinguished Edinburgh surgeon. It was he who recognized McMichael's intellectual qualities at an early age and convinced his parents that he should go on to Kirkcudbright Academy&#151;where he was dux in 1921&#151;then, supported by local and Carnegie scholarships, to Edinburgh University, where he graduated in medicine in 1927. After a period in junior posts he was appointed as first assistant to Professor Stanley Davidson, who held the regius chair of medicine in the University of Aberdeen. On 3 June 1932 he married Joan Katherine Macpherson (1906&#150;1989), then a medical practitioner at Crichton, Midlothian. They had two sons, who were evacuated to Canada during the Second World War, but the marriage ended in divorce and on 7 April 1942 McMichael married Sybil Eleanor Blake (1914&#150;1965), a radiographer, with whom he had another two sons.<br>
<br>In 1932 McMichael went to London as Beit memorial fellow to work in Professor T. R. Elliott's department at University College Hospital. There he met the leading clinical research worker of that era, Sir Thomas Lewis. He was helped by a fellow Scot, John W. McNee, who made his remarkable collection of spleens available to him, and he wrote his MD thesis on liver and spleen fibrosis (1933). This won him a gold medal from Edinburgh University, to which he returned as a lecturer in human physiology under Professor I. de Burgh Daly. He was now to work on the physiology of the heart, a lifelong interest. In 1937 he moved back to clinical work, being awarded the Johnstone and Lawrence research fellowship by the Royal Society. This assured his appointment as assistant physician to the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh.<br>
<br>In 1938, however, Professor Francis Fraser, a remarkable talent scout who was the first director of the department of medicine at the newly established British Postgraduate Medical School at Hammersmith Hospital in London, had the foresight to appoint McMichael as his reader. With the outbreak of war a year later Fraser left to direct the Emergency Medical Service in London so that McMichael became effectively the director of the department. There were major contributions to clinical research at Hammersmith during those war years. Crush injuries and their sequels, suffered by air-raid casualties, were described by Eric Bywaters and his colleagues. McMichael worked closely with Peter Sharpey-Schafer, grandson of the Edinburgh physiologist Sir Edward Sharpey-Schafer, who had been his teacher. Together they introduced cardiac catheterization in Britain for the study of the circulation and the effects of blood loss directly in man, an important topic in times of war. McMichael also introduced percutaneous liver biopsy for the first time in Britain for investigating jaundice, a common problem for the military. He was assisted in this work by a new recruit from Edinburgh, Sheila Sherlock, who thus took her first steps towards a remarkable career in hepatology.<br>
<br>The introduction of these invasive methods of clinical investigation, soon to become routine procedures, required great courage on McMichael's part, for they were not welcomed with enthusiasm in the traditional teaching hospitals in London. In those days, however, before the introduction of ethical committees to supervise research, the clinical investigator made his own judgements and McMichael was not to be deterred.<br>
<br>In 1946 McMichael succeeded Fraser as professor of medicine at Hammersmith. By now, within little more than a decade of the foundation of the British Postgraduate Medical School, his department had achieved an international reputation for its outstanding if controversial research, for its encouragement of dissident views in a world of medical conformity and for the challenging nature of its teaching. Through those years, every aspiring clinical research worker from the Commonwealth and beyond came to Hammersmith. McMichael himself continued to work on mechanisms of heart failure and the mode of action of digitalis. In later years, he turned his attention to treating high blood pressure.<br>
<br>McMichael's major achievement, however, was to create a clinical research environment, then unique in Britain, of free discussion and debate in which all, whatever the position they held, might join. It was, however, a freedom that was never allowed to degenerate into licence. He greatly encouraged the young, making the memorable comment at a meeting of the Association of Physicians of Great Britain and Ireland (of which he was then president) that &#145;we must have the young upon our shoulders, not trample them under our feet&#146;. He was a fearless leader. Never afraid of the unconventional in medicine, he took the unfashionable view that anticoagulants should not be used to treat coronary attacks and in later life was never convinced that cholesterol was important as a cause of heart disease. He was elected FRS in 1957 and knighted in 1965.<br>
<br>Following the death of his second wife, on 1 October 1965 McMichael married Sheila Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Howarth (1920&#150;2000), widow of his former colleague Peter Sharpey-Schafer. McMichael left Hammersmith in 1966, by which time he had become a towering figure in international cardiology and medicine. He now became director of the Postgraduate Medical Federation, responsible for all the postgraduate medical institutes in London. At the same time he was an influential Wellcome trustee. He had succeeded Sir Henry Dale in 1960 and until his retirement in 1977 he played a major role in ensuring that clinical research would be effectively supported.<br>
<br>McMichael could be ruthless when necessary, but he always retained a Churchillian magnanimity in his dealings with his colleagues. He revealed little of his inner thoughts and emotions to his associates, yet his toughness was tempered with compassion and he always felt that his department and the medical school that he served with such devotion was an extended family. His support for those who had worked with him was legendary. He remained a Scot throughout his life, always faithful to his Scottish origins and upbringing. It was at Gatehouse of Fleet that in 1982 he suffered the stroke that left him hemiplegic, dysphasic, and dyslexic during his last years. He faced with courage and fortitude the afflictions of those years and in all his vicissitudes he retained that twinkle of the eye that was one of his most endearing characteristics. He died at Manor House, Merton, a nursing home near Oxford, on 3 March 1993, and was cremated at Headington, Oxford. The memorial service, held on 18 May 1993 at St Columba's Church of Scotland, Pont Street, London, was attended by numerous family members and representatives from most of London's medical establishments and societies.<br>
