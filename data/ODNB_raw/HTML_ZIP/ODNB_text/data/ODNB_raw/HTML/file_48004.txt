</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gulbenkian,  Calouste Sarkis</span>  (1869&#150;1955), <span class="occ">oil industrialist and benefactor</span>, was born in Scutari, adjacent to Constantinople, in Turkey, on 23 March 1869, one of three sons of Sarkis Gulbenkian (<i>d</i>. 1894), a trader in kerosene and a provincial banker. Although he respected his family, Calouste does not seem to have had close relations with his brothers throughout his life.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandmarriage"></a>Early life and marriage</h2>Armenian by birth and tradition, Gulbenkian was initially educated locally and gained admission to Robert's College, Constantinople. He then attended the &Eacute;cole Sup&eacute;rieure, Marseilles, before being admitted to King's College, London, in 1884, where he was elected an associate in 1887, having been awarded prizes and commendations in physics and mechanics. In that year he returned home to Constantinople, where his linguistic proficiency and technical training provided the essential elements for his subsequent career.<br>
<br>Gulbenkian was soon representing his father's interests, gaining experience of commercial affairs, and acquainting himself with the Ottoman corridors of political power. In particular, he impressed the Ottoman authorities with his understanding of the political and economic issues involved with the nascent oil industry; and he was soon consulted about oil concessions and the prospects for oil in Turkish territories. His ambitions were aroused. He was a good-looking, elegant young man of medium stature, with dark eyebrows and bright eyes and with a well-trimmed moustache and beard. In later life his domed, balding forehead and bushy eyebrows were prominent, and a tendency to plumpness was noticeable.<br>
<br>Gulbenkian courted and eventually married in London in 1892 Nevarte Esseyan (<i>d</i>. 1952), whose father, Ohannes, was a substantial man of business in Constantinople. Their honeymoon was spent in Paris where their host was C&eacute;sar Ritz, a lifelong friend. The couple settled in London at 36 Hyde Park Gardens, living there from 1900 to 1925. They had a son, Nubar Sarkis (<i>b</i>. 1896), and a daughter, Rita. Nevarte was more outgoing than her husband&#151;humorous and charming, entertaining with warmth and a real social flair. He was dutiful and patriarchal, insisting on obedience and respect rather than exhibiting affection, but he was devoted to her. Proud of his strong-willed son's ability, he was disappointed at his undue attitude of independence and regretted what he regarded as his ostentatious manner. Nubar feared rather than loved his father, but admitted his father's indulgence towards him, though he resented his tight financial control.<h2>
<a name="Careerinoil"></a>Career in oil</h2>Well established at the turn of the century, Gulbenkian gradually extended the scope and scale of his commercial operations in London and Constantinople, with frequent visits to Paris, where he based himself at the Ritz Hotel. He and his family had survived the worst excesses of the Armenian massacres of 1896; and out of those misfortunes he came to know and befriend the Mantachev family, who had widespread petroleum interests in Russia; he became acquainted with Nubar Pasha, a prominent Egyptian politician and a relative of his wife. Such distinguished figures were important contacts and Gulbenkian's affairs prospered at a time when oil, as a result of new discoveries and the impact of new technology, was playing an increasing role in world trade. Although Russian and American production dominated the opening years of the twentieth century, Dutch and British interests were beginning to become important and prospects for oil in the Middle East brightened with the commencement of oil production in Persia in 1908.<br>
<br>Gulbenkian was at the heart of these developments, though he strangely failed to recognize the significance of the Persian oil find and its adverse repercussions on his own interests. He was more concerned with the potential for discovering oil in the Ottoman empire, and especially in Mesopotamia, which potential he pursued with &#145;unusual foresight and persistence&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 21 July 1955). However, Gulbenkian was aware of the interplay of the respective strengths of the main international oil companies; and he was closely involved with Henri Deterding and Marcus Samuel of Royal Dutch Shell, and with Shell's entry into the US market in 1912.<br>
<br>There was fierce international competition to obtain the concession to explore for oil in Mesopotamia, and Gulbenkian played an important role in the consortium of rival interests that was eventually formed. In 1912 he was one of the partners involved in the formation of a company for the eventual exploitation of the assumed oil reserves of Mesopotamia. This was the Turkish Petroleum Company (TPC), later renamed the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), in 1929. This became Gulbenkian's principal concern; he originally held a 15 per cent interest in the company, and then 5 per cent. He derived from it not only immense wealth, but also the sobriquet of &#145;Mr Five Per Cent&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Developinginterests"></a>Developing interests</h2>Despite the political and economic gyrations in those years just before and after the First World War, especially in the Middle East, Gulbenkian managed to protect his own interests in Mesopotamia as the pace of exploration accelerated. In 1925 a new concession was signed with the government of Iraq. In 1928 oil was discovered at Baba Gurgur and in the same year a new constitution for the company was agreed. This confirmed the shareholdings of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (later BP) and Royal Dutch Shell, and provided for the inclusion of French instead of German interests, as well as allowing for American participation and Gulbenkian's 5 per cent share. However, there were self-denying clauses in the agreement which prevented the partners in IPC from taking concessions elsewhere in the Ottoman empire. Gulbenkian's interests by this time were held by a Canadian company and were registered in Canada. With the discovery of oil in Kirkuk in 1934 and the completion of the first pipeline, Iraq became a major oil-producing region.<br>
<br>Although Iraq remained the main focus for his oil interests, Gulbenkian had also become involved in the formulation of French oil policy, especially during the First World War when he became a confidant of Senateur Henri B&eacute;renger, the minister in charge of oil affairs. He also at this time acted as the representative of Royal Dutch Shell in France.<br>
<br>In the early 1920s Gulbenkian extended his oil interests to the emerging areas of production in Venezuela, in the course of which an unfortunate quarrel with Henri Deterding came to a head. Both men were strong-minded and opinionated. Gulbenkian felt that Deterding had treated some of the shareholders in Venezuelan Oil Concessions Ltd with scant regard, including himself. Deterding denied the accusations: compromise proved impossible and the break was absolute. Unfortunately it blighted the career of Gulbenkian's son, Nubar, who was Deterding's personal assistant and thought by some to be the right person to become his successor. Calouste, however, was adamant that his son leave Shell, which he did, to concentrate on family affairs. In 1927 Gulbenkian acquired a new residence in Paris, at 51 avenue d'Iena, a large and imposing house which he made into a home and a gallery for his greatly respected collection of art.<br>
<br>During the negotiations following the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's concession in 1932, Gulbenkian acted as adviser to the Persian government, though he played very little part in the final settlement of the dispute. The 1930s were a rewarding time for him, as oil from Iraq began to flow, and he enjoyed the company of a wide range of friends drawn not only from business and politics but from the cultural world, including Upham Pope, the American historian of Persian art, and Sir Kenneth Clark, director of the National Gallery.<h2>
<a name="Lateryearsanddeath"></a>Later years and death</h2>The onset of the Second World War not only shattered the international scene, it changed Gulbenkian's life. He had retained his British nationality (granted in 1902), but he also held an Iranian diplomatic passport. After the surrender of France in 1940 he remained in Vichy France with the Iranian diplomatic mission. It was then claimed that his British nationality brought him within the provisions of the <span class="roman">Trading with the Enemy Act</span> and prevented him, like the Compagnie Fran&ccedil;aise des Petroles (CFP), from participating in the business of the IPC. The custodian of enemy property was empowered to vest in himself &#145;enemy&#146; property and act as if he owned it. By agreement with the custodian a vesting order was made in relation to Gulbenkian's IPC shares, and the custodian then appointed an associate of Gulbenkian and his lawyer in England to represent the custodian at IPC meetings. When diplomatic relations between Iran and France were severed in 1942, Gulbenkian, persuaded by Nubar, found refuge in Portugal rather than Switzerland and he installed himself at the Aviz Hotel in Lisbon. Soon after he arrived, the vesting order was revoked and the IPC shares were returned to him; he remained in Lisbon for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>The war caused fundamental changes in the balances of political and commercial power. The United States rejected past isolationism and responded to the challenge of the cold war, adopting an interventionist policy in respect of Arab-Israeli differences. By 1943 the Middle East had become the recognized dominant oil region of the world, and Saudi Arabia became the focus of American attention. Efforts were made by the American companies in IPC to free themselves from the agreement not to take concessions elsewhere in the former Ottoman empire. The American companies claimed that the discontinuity in IPC affairs, caused by the wartime &#145;enemy&#146; status of Gulbenkian and the French company CFP, meant that the 1928 agreement had been frustrated and that they should be permitted to participate in Saudi Arabian concessions. This was challenged legally but after lengthy and complicated negotiations a settlement was ultimately reached out of court in 1948. By then Gulbenkian was in declining health and his affairs were being handled by a group of his closest advisers, including his son, Nubar, his son-in-law, Kevork Loris Esseyan, and his nephew Roberto Gulbenkian. Predeceased by his wife in 1952, Gulbenkian, who confidently expected to live to an advanced age, died on 20 July 1955 in Lisbon. He was cremated in Switzerland and his remains were committed to the care of the church of St Sarkis, in London, with full Armenian rites.<br>
<br>During a successful and fulfilling life of business enterprise, Gulbenkian's determination of character, adaptability of manner, shrewdness in negotiation, integrity in business, hard-working attention to detail, and cosmopolitan outlook were always apparent. With little or no organization behind him he largely managed his enterprises himself, with only a small staff in the later years of his life. He had little use for formal office routine and relied upon personal contact.<h2>
<a name="TheGulbenkianlegacy"></a>The Gulbenkian legacy</h2>During his lifetime Gulbenkian had one indulgence, his caring concern for his art treasures&#151;his &#145;children&#146;, as he termed them. They formed the core of one of the finest individual private collections in the world. The story is told that as a boy his father had rewarded him for some school success and that with the money he had gone to the bazaar and purchased one antique coin, rather than saving it, as his father had expected. After the Russian Revolution he succeeded in acquiring some fine items there including Jean Antoine Houdon's <span class="italic">Diana</span>, <span class="italic">H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Fourment</span> by Peter Paul Rubens, and <span class="italic">Pallas Athene</span> by Rembrandt, as well as fine gold and silver ware by Fran&ccedil;ois Thomas Germain.<br>
<br>Gulbenkian's collection was based on his personal choice and owed nothing to extravagance or fashion. Every piece was in the finest condition and he took the best advice available. His range was wide: books, manuscripts, paintings, statuary, textiles, coins, carpets, and various <i>objets d'art</i>. Knowledgeable himself, he was respected by dealers and art historians alike. While he felt more at home with art of the past he had some choice modern examples and appreciated the artistic virtuosity of Ren&eacute; Lalique and Auguste Rodin. He was on good terms with curators and directors of national galleries, such as Sir Kenneth Clark in London and John Walker in Washington, and in middle life he lent generously to the National Gallery and the National Gallery of Art. He was a generous benefactor to the Armenian church and founded and endowed the church of St Sarkis in London, in memory of his parents. He contributed to the Armenian patriarchy of Jerusalem and was a frequent contributor to philanthropic good causes and reliefs without seeking public acknowledgement. It was in keeping with the private nature of his character.<br>
<br>Gulbenkian did not travel a great deal but he was enthusiastic about the delights of architecture and was particularly moved by the charms of the Alhambra. In Egypt he was impressed with the sense of great antiquity. Not only was he deeply appreciative of the beauty and grace of art, especially of the feminine figure, but he was also very sensible of the natural and scenic beauty occasioned by sunrises and sunsets. In 1937 he purchased a romantic park with beautiful trees, Les Enclos, near Deauville, a favourite haunt, where he often spent part of the summer.<br>
<br>Gulbenkian had already begun in 1938 to refer to his intention to establish a permanent home for his art treasures, without deciding on anything very practical except some ideas for a gallery in London. Plans became more definite in a will drawn up on 6 May 1950 and more precise in his will of 18 June 1953. Controversy subsequently attended the creation and organization of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation for charitable, artistic, educational, and scientific purposes: Nubar stated that it failed to represent the objectives of his father; and Lord Radcliffe, closest confidant, legal adviser, and first choice of Gulbenkian to be the initial chairman, declined the honour. In the event Dr Jos&eacute; de Azeredo Perdig&atilde;o, Gulbenkian's Portuguese lawyer, succeeded, and he successfully guided the foundation on its way for more than thirty-five years.<br>
<br>After Gulbenkian's death a long and appreciative obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> carried the apt headline, &#145;Great wealth amassed and well spent&#146;. It mentioned that his &#145;entrenched 5 per cent gave Gulbenkian a unique position in industrial democracy&#146;  (ibid.), and described how when negotiations affecting his interests were undertaken, he ranked on a par with governments. Gulbenkian, it argued, was one of those, like Cecil Rhodes and Ferdinand de Lesseps, whose commercial kingdoms gave them an international standing in their own right  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 21 July 1955).<br>
