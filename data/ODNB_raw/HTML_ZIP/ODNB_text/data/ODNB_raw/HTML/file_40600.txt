<span class="headword">Le Ma&ccedil;on,  Robert</span> <span class="st"> [Robert La Fontaine]</span>  (1534/5&#150;1611), <span class="occ">Reformed minister and diplomat</span>, was born at Illiers, near Chartres, in the Orl&eacute;anais, France; his parents' names are unknown. In 1557 he was one of the founding ministers of the important Reformed church in Orl&eacute;ans, which became the capital of the Huguenot movement during the first war of religion in France in 1562. There he also probably met and married, about 1557, his first wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1605), who, according to the 1593 census of aliens in London, originally came from that city.<br>
<br>La Fontaine (as he was usually known, being sieur de la Fontaine) fled to England at the time of the St Bartholomew's day massacre in 1572, and in October 1574 was appointed minister of the French and Walloon refugee church in London. Throughout his long pastorate he worked diligently to establish and maintain Calvinist orthodoxy among this congregation. In 1578 he revised the church's written &#145;discipline&#146;, the first revision since the church had been re-established under Elizabeth I in 1560. He also composed a Calvinist catechism for the members of his own flock, translated into English and published in 1580 as <span class="italic">A catechisme and playne instruction for children which prepare themselves to communicate in the holy supper</span>, and published in French in 1602 as <span class="italic">Catechisme et instruction famili&egrave;re pour les enfans qui se preparent &agrave; communiquer &agrave; la saincte c&egrave;ne</span>.<br>
<br>La Fontaine also maintained a correspondence with protestant leaders throughout Europe, such as Theodore Beza in Geneva and Philippe Du Plessis-Mornay in France. In 1578 he helped Du Plessis compose his protestant manifesto, <span class="italic">Trait&eacute; de l'eglise</span>. During Henry IV's wars against the Catholic League and Spain in the 1590s, Du Plessis arranged to have La Fontaine appointed the French king's unofficial representative in England. La Fontaine was most heavily involved in the complex political and military negotiations between Henry IV and Elizabeth I during their mutual war against Spain from 1595 to 1598. He was in direct communication with both monarchs, and maintained a wide correspondence with influential royal councillors, such as Villeroy in France and Burghley and Robert Cecil in England, and with nobles such as the duc de Bouillon and the earl of Essex. He was one of the few French negotiators who took part in drawing up the treaty of Greenwich in 1596, chosen because, as the chief French negotiator, De Sancy, wrote to him, &#145;we did not think that we could employ anyone more trustworthy than you, nor one who would be more acceptable to them [the English negotiators]&#146;  (Kermaingant, 46&#150;7). By this time La Fontaine was sixty-one  (preface to <span class="italic">Les funerailles de Sodome</span>, 2nd edn, 1610), and after Henry's peace with Spain in 1598 he withdrew himself from active diplomacy, but throughout the following years he continued to maintain contact with Du Plessis and remained an important link between the Huguenots in France and the English church and government. In 1601, at the French Reformed church's national synod at Gergeau, he even presented a proposal to unite the English and French churches, with little success.<br>
<br>The previous year La Fontaine had published the first edition of a series of sermons on the story of Lot, <span class="italic">Les funerailles de Sodome et de ses filles</span>. In August 1605 his wife, Anne, died, and six months later, on 25 February 1606, he married, as his second wife, Maturine Doute 
    (or Doubts; <i>d</i>. 1621)
  , also a native of Orl&eacute;ans. By the end of his life, La Fontaine had spent almost exactly half of his years in France and half in England. He died in 1611, and was buried in his parish of St Anne Blackfriars, London, on 6 November, his death even attracting the notice of John Chamberlain  (<span class="italic">The Chamberlain Letters</span>, ed. E. M. Thomson, 1966, 319) and Isaac Casaubon. His widow died on 15 February 1621. His family maintained a foot in both countries. His son, Louis, a king's councillor who had assisted his father in his diplomatic activities, maintained the family name in France, as the sieur de la Fontaine et d'Ancreville. Meanwhile his three daughters&#151;Anne, Rachel, and Sara&#151;all married male members of the Harderet family, another prominent refugee family, and remained in England.<br>
