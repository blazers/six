<span class="headword">Clerke, Sir  William Henry</span>, eighth baronet  (1751&#150;1818), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 25 November 1751 in Jamaica, the second son of Francis Clerke (1724&#150;1760) of Weston, Oxfordshire, and Susannah Elizabeth Ashurst. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, in December 1769; he was subsequently a member of All Souls College, Oxford, and he took his BCL degree in October 1778. In 1778 Clerke succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his elder brother, Francis, the favourite aide-de-camp to General John Burgoyne in North America, who was mortally wounded at Saratoga. When he was dying Francis asked Burgoyne to endeavour, on his return to England, to procure preferment for William, who had taken orders. The twelfth earl of Derby&#151;at the prompting, no doubt, of General Burgoyne, who had married the earl's aunt&#151;presented Clerke to the rectory of Bury, Lancashire, to which he was instituted on 6 February 1778.<br>
<br>Clerke's religious and political views appear to have been those of a conventional high-church tory. He was well received on his arrival in Bury and as rector was remembered as good natured and charitable to the poor. In particular, he paid much attention to the physical health of his parishioners; he vaccinated the children of the local poor and for a considerable time even travelled to Rochdale once a week to perform the same operation. On the occasion of an outbreak of fever he issued, in 1790, <span class="italic">Thoughts upon the means of preserving the health of the poor by prevention and suppression of epidemic fever</span>, a pamphlet advocating the use of quarantine, improved cleanliness, and extensive lime whitewashing as a means of controlling the disease. These suggestions, perhaps partly inspired by Clerke's own extensive involvement in the lime trade, were supported by an appeal for paternalistic involvement on the part of employers of labour and by a long letter on the pamphlet's subject matter by the philanthropic Dr Thomas Percival.<br>
<br>In May 1792 Clerke married Byzantia (<i>d</i>. 1815), daughter of Thomas Cartwright of Aynho; they had three sons and one daughter. The eldest son, William Henry (1793&#150;1861), became ninth baronet and he served in the Peninsular War and at Waterloo. The two younger sons both went into the church and the youngest, Charles Carr, became archdeacon of Oxford and a canon of Christ Church. At a time when a French invasion was feared Clerke printed <span class="italic">A sermon preached in the parish church of Bury on the 18th October 1798, on the occasion of the colours being presented to the Bury Loyal Association</span> and <span class="italic">A Serious Address to the People of this Country</span>. Appended to the sermon was the speech made on the reception of the colours by the lieutenant-colonel commandant of the Bury Volunteers, the first Sir Robert Peel, whose second wife was Clerke's sister. Another of Clerke's publications is his undated <span class="italic">Penitens, or, The dying tradesman, extracted from the books of a late pious writer: to which is added prayers</span>.<br>
<br>In addition to the manufacture of lime, Clerke involved himself energetically in a number of agricultural pursuits and enterprises. These included farming the extensive rectory lands, often taking a turn at the plough and participating in the harvest. He built his own corn mill and became a significant dealer in both corn and malt. Unfortunately Clerke's enthusiasm for business exceeded his aptitude, and he borrowed extensively, sometimes at high rates of interest, to support his enterprises and he suffered from the dishonesty of some of his associates. Eventually, his financial embarrassments grew to such an extent that his living was sequestered for the benefit of his creditors. He died on 10 April 1818, in the Fleet prison, where he was incarcerated for debt, his wife having died three years previously on 30 April 1815.<br>
