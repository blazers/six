<span class="headword">McVitie,  Robert</span>  (1809&#150;1883), <span class="occ">baker and confectioner</span>, was born at Nunholm, Dumfries, the son of William McVitie, farmer, and his wife, Jean Green. His father was a failed poet and a friend of Sir Walter Scott, who used his name in <span class="italic">Rob Roy</span>. After an apprenticeship to a Dumfries baker, Robert McVitie joined his father in Edinburgh, where he helped to run a provision shop in a tenement house in Rose Street that had been inherited from an uncle. When his father returned to Dumfries, McVitie continued to keep the shop. He moved to Charlotte Place and on 30 January 1844 married Catherine, daughter of William Gairns. They had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>By 1856 McVitie was advertising himself as a baker and confectioner, the baking being carried out in the shop basement. His two sons were apprenticed as bakers in the firm, and as the business grew McVitie was able to open other retail outlets and to send his sons to the continent, to learn French and German and to study European baking methods. On their return, the firm introduced Vienna bread to Edinburgh and described itself as &#145;Boulangerie Fran&ccedil;aise et Viennoise&#146;. McVitie retired in 1880, and died from cancer on 21 November 1883 at 6 Mansfield Place, Edinburgh. His wife had predeceased him.<br>
<br>The business was continued by their younger son <a name="cosubject_63038"></a><span class="headword">Robert McVitie</span>  (1854&#150;1910)<span class="occ"></span>. Born in Edinburgh he spent his whole working life in the family business, from apprenticeship onwards. His experience, gained on the continent and elsewhere, convinced him that there was a considerable untapped market for fancy biscuits and similar snack items. As his elder brother had already left the business to become a journalist, he took charge of the firm on his father's retirement. He occupied larger premises in Merchant Street, where he made shortbread and oatcakes as well as biscuits. These won a gold medal and a certificate of excellence at the Calcutta Exhibition of 1883&#150;4. He made a wedding cake for the future George V and Queen Mary, in 1893, and later christening cakes for their children.<br>
<br>Leaving the production side to his manager, Alexander Ross, McVitie opened up distribution centres in England. In 1887 he engaged Alexander Grant, who was soon made foreman. That year he visited plants in the United States to learn about the latest biscuit-making technology, and he made a further visit twelve years later. Then in 1888 Charles Edward Price (<i>d</i>. 1934), a former traveller for Cadburys, became a partner of what was renamed McVitie and Price; he concentrated on the marketing side, but retired in 1901 and served as Liberal MP for Central Edinburgh from 1906 to 1918.<br>
<br>The bread and catering activities were now carried out by a separate firm, which in 1898 was named McVitties Guest &amp; Co., the other partner being Edward Graham Guest, McVitie's brother-in-law. In 1902 they opened a modern, air-conditioned building in Princes Street.<br>
<br>When Price left the biscuit firm Grant was appointed general manager, and he and McVitie worked hard for much of the decade on starting up a branch factory in London. With the dependable Grant in charge of the Edinburgh activities, McVitie came to spend most of his time in London, and he also built a residence at Northchurch, near Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, where he lived with his wife, Louisa Elizabeth, daughter of William Thompson; they had no children. For a time he represented the chamber of commerce on the board of management of the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh, and he was a member of the Merchant Company there.<br>
<br>McVitie had unsuccessfully contested an Edinburgh ward for the town council as a Unionist, and in London he maintained his political links by becoming president of the Harlesden Conservative Association. He was also patron of several charitable institutions. His outside directorships included that of the Employers' Mutual Insurance Association of Scotland Ltd. A quiet, industrious, and conscientious man, he chose able managers to assist him in making the firm one of the leading biscuit manufacturers in Britain. However, his exertions clearly shortened his life; he died, aged only fifty-six, on 15 July 1910, at his home, Woodcock Hill, Northchurch, near Berkhamsted, and was buried on 19 July at Dean cemetery, Edinburgh.<br>
