<span class="headword">Mears,  John</span>  (1695&#150;1767), <span class="occ">non-subscribing Presbyterian minister</span>, was born in Loughbrickland, co. Down, one of at least two sons of John Mears (<i>d</i>. 1718), Presbyterian minister successively at Colydon, Ayrshire (1689), Longford (1697), and Newtownards (1707), and his wife, Margaret Gilchrist (<i>d</i>. 1716) of Antrim. He entered Glasgow University in 1710, graduated MA in 1713, and studied divinity under John Simson, whose teaching shook his orthodoxy. Early in 1718 he was licensed by the Down presbytery and on 10 February 1720 he was ordained at Newtownards, in succession to his father.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the subscription controversy in 1720 Mears, who was clerk of Down presbytery, sided strongly with the non-subscribers. In 1722 he made overtures to Francis Hutchinson, bishop of Down and Connor, offering to conform to the Church of Ireland. On 22 November 1722 the matter came before the Down presbytery, to whom Mears apologized; blaming his actions on a &#145;temptation of Satan&#146;, he declared that &#145;he was now more fixed in his former faith and Presbyterian principles, and hoped this step of his weakness should have a good effect upon him in making him a more able advocate for the Presbyterian cause&#146;  (Reid and Killen, <span class="italic">History of the Presbyterian Church</span>, 3.166n). As some of his congregation remained dissatisfied and suspicious of his non-subscribing principles the presbytery moved them into a separate congregation in May 1723. In 1724 Mears supported his fellow non-subscriber Thomas Nevin, minister of Downpatrick, who had been accused of Arianism and excluded from ministerial communion. Mears had to defend himself from the charge of Arianism made by Gilbert Kennedy, of Donacloney and Tullyish, and anonymously vindicated himself in Samuel Haliday's <span class="italic">Letter to the Revd Mr G. Kennedy</span> (1725). In June 1725 Mears and his congregation were transferred to the Antrim presbytery, which formally separated from the general synod in the following year. In 1732 he published a catechism for adults that became the standard &#145;shorter catechism&#146; in Irish non-subscribing congregations until the nineteenth century; as a consequence it was frequently reprinted.<br>
<br>In 1735 Mears resigned Newtownards to take charge of the Presbyterian congregation at Clonmel, co. Tipperary, where he was installed on 9 April. In 1738 it was recorded that he had between seventy and eighty communicants. On 9 January 1740 he was installed minister of a small congregation in Stafford Street, Dublin, which had separated from Capel Street congregation on 10 October 1738. In December 1740 he preached the funeral sermon for John Abernethy, at Wood Street Chapel, and in 1762 his congregation amalgamated with that in Wood Street. A new meeting-house was built for the united congregation in Strand Street, where Mears preached the opening sermon on 22 January 1764. He wrote a short explanation of the Lord's supper that was published in 1758 and incorporated in <span class="italic">Forms of Devotion</span> (1766) by John Leland, James Duchal, and Isaac Weld.<br>
<br>Mears died on 11 October 1767, leaving a son, who settled in Calcutta, and a daughter, who married John Brown, Presbyterian minister at Waterford.<br>
