<span class="headword">Bennett,  Louise <span class="st"> [Louie]</span></span>  (1870&#150;1956), <span class="occ">suffragist, trade unionist, and pacifist</span>, was born in Temple Road, Temple Hill, near Dublin, the eldest of five daughters and five sons of an auctioneer and antiques valuer called Bennett and his wife, Susan Boulger, daughter of an army officer. Her family were prosperous protestants who had lived in Ireland since the late eighteenth century.<br>
<br>Educated at an English boarding-school and at Alexandra College, Dublin, and then in Bonn where she studied music, Louie Bennett at first lived the life of a cultivated lady with literary pretensions. She wrote two novels, <span class="italic">The Proving of Priscilla</span> (1902) and <span class="italic">A Prisoner of his Word</span> (1908). She was forty years old when she started on her serious life's work of social intervention to which she then devoted herself with total commitment for the next forty years. In August 1911 she founded the Irishwomen's Suffrage Federation, becoming its first secretary. It was also at that time and in joint pursuance of that cause that she met her lifelong companion Helen Chenevix&#151;one of the first women graduates from Trinity College, Dublin. Together they worked to link the various Irish suffrage societies.<br>
<br>It was the bitter labour conflicts in Dublin in 1913 that awakened Louie Bennett to full realization of the desperate situation of Irish women workers&#151;&#145;the slaves of slaves&#146;&#151;who were very near starvation level. She founded the Irish Women's Reform League and thereafter became the leading activist and organizer in the cause of economic justice and human dignity for the sweated women workers of Ireland. Starting with the printing trade and then the laundry workers, Louie Bennett fought decade after decade not just for better wages but also for improved sanitation, ventilation, light, heat, shorter hours, and paid holidays&#151;all to &#145;humanize&#146; industrial working life. Louie Bennett was a co-operative socialist, believing in workers' control and a minimum equal living wage for both men and women. Although born a &#145;lady&#146;, she was a familiar sight standing on the picket line with girl strikers in the rain.<br>
<br>Louie Bennett's other cause was pacifism. Although converted to the cause of Irish independence by the Easter rising in 1916, she herself always insisted on non-violent struggle&#151;in this agreeing with the murdered Francis Sheehy Skeffington and with &#145;A. E.&#146; (George William Russell). Her commitment to pacifism made her unpopular both with belligerent pro-Britons and with militant Irish nationalists. Her pamphlet, <span class="italic">Ireland and a People's Peace</span> (1918), advocated both national self-determination and international co-operation, criticizing Sinn F&eacute;in both for its failure to see the importance of international interdependence and for its violence. In it she argued that &#145;No revolution is permanently achieved by violence: such violence, even in the name of freedom, is tyranny.&#146; Between 1920 and 1922 Louie Bennett participated in efforts to end the Irish civil war by negotiation and in 1921 she went to Washington to give evidence before the American commission on conditions in Ireland.<br>
<br>In Dublin in 1926 Louie Bennett presided over the congress of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, of which she had been a founder member since 1915 and whose international president, Jane Addams, was the woman Louie Bennett admired most in the world. In 1928 she wrote an article in the <span class="italic">Irish Statesman</span> supporting Litvinov's call to the League of Nations for general and immediate disarmament. And when appointed the first ever woman president of the Irish Trades Union Congress in 1932, she was prescient enough to warn her hearers of the dangers of Fascism.<br>
<br>After the partition of Ireland, Louie Bennett continuously tried to keep every channel of friendly contact open between south and north, working to establish the basic co-operative links of transport, communications, power lines, and drainage. Her hope was to see a peacefully reunited, federal Ireland. The last cause she worked for in her old age was the outlawing of nuclear weapons.<br>
<br>Louie Bennett was of middle height with shrewd, twinkling dark brown eyes expressive of her humour, liveliness, and strength of feeling. She was a thoughtful, forceful speaker who exuded dignity and determination. When she died at her home in Killiney, near Dublin, on 25 November 1956 at the age of eighty-six she was called the best-loved woman in Dublin.<br>
