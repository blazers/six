<span class="headword">Oldys,  William</span>  (1636&#150;1708), <span class="occ">civil lawyer and advocate of the Admiralty</span>, was born in Adderbury, Oxfordshire, on 19 October 1636. He was one of eleven surviving children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20697/', "William Oldys (1590/91&#150;1645)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20699/', "Oldys, William (1696&#150;1761)")</script>], vicar of Adderbury, who was killed in a skirmish with parliamentary soldiers, and Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1705), daughter of Ambrose Sacheverall. At the age of twelve he entered Winchester College. He then studied civil law at New College, Oxford (BCL, 1661; DCL, 1667), where he was a fellow from 1655 to 1671. In 1670 Oldys was admitted an advocate of Doctors' Commons, the society of civil lawyers who practised in the ecclesiastical and Admiralty courts. He was made chancellor of the diocese of Lincoln in 1683 and held that office until his death. In 1685 he stood unsuccessfully for parliament for Oxford, for what Wood says was the third time  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>: <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 2.54). Oldys was named advocate of the Admiralty by the royal warrant of James II in July 1686. Within two months, however, he was one of the counsel for Bishop Compton, who had been brought before the ecclesiastical commission for refusing the king's orders to suppress anti-Catholic preaching. At about this time Oldys contributed the life of Pompey to a new translation of Plutarch's <span class="italic">Lives</span> (<span class="italic">Plutarch's &#145;Lives&#146;, Translated from the Greek by Several Hands</span>, 4, 1685). On 5 October 1687 he was admitted as king's advocate in the court of chivalry upon its re-establishment. In this role Oldys, &#145;one of the leading heraldic lawyers of his day&#146;  (Squibb, 184), made explicit the principles governing the right to bear arms, by birth and by grant.<br>
<br>Oldys maintained his place at the Admiralty after the revolution of 1688. In November 1692, however, he refused to prosecute as pirates the Irish captains and officers of vessels who were acting under letters of marque issued by King James from his court in France. In September 1693 Oldys was called before the council to defend his position. He explained that, under the law of nations, even deposed monarchs, when fighting to regain their thrones, had the authority to grant commissions to privateers. It was a dangerous response, since the ruling explanation of the revolution was that James had not been deposed but had &#145;abdicated&#146;. Sir John Trenchard, the northern secretary, denounced such reasons as &#145;amount[ing] to high treason&#146; and demanded to know &#145;what do you think of the abdication?&#146; Oldys replied that he accepted it &#145;since it was voted&#146;, but that the defendants might reasonably have believed otherwise. Not surprisingly, this failed to satisfy and he was removed from his position and replaced with Fisher Littleton, who, at the same meeting, assured the council that the men in question were &#145;not enemies but rogues&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 12.1270&#150;75). The defendants were tried and several hanged. Oldys's arguments were attacked the next year in a pamphlet by Matthew Tindal, titled <span class="italic">An Essay Concerning the Law of Nations, and the Rights of Soveraigns</span> (1694).<br>
<br>Oldys continued to practise law and in 1696 found himself representing two privateers (these commissioned by the king of France) who were being prosecuted for treason. His career prospered and by the time of his death in 1708 he had a successful practice and had accumulated a considerable estate. This included a library of more than 1000 volumes that was promptly acquired by Doctors' Commons. &#145;As a scholar, he was respectable; as a civilian, he was learned; as a pleader, eloquent and judicious&#146;  (Coote, 95).<br>
<br>The specifics of Oldys's domestic life are less than clear. Some material suggests he married Theodosia Lovett, the widow of Robert Lovett of Liscombe, Buckinghamshire, and daughter of Sir John Halsey of Great Gaddesden, Hertfordshire, some time after 1686 and that she survived his death. She is not, however, mentioned in his will, executed in 1701. The principal beneficiary of that will was the testator's &#145;loving cozen&#146;, Ann Oldys (1671&#150;1711), the daughter of Oldys's first cousin, and also his mistress  (Yeowell, v&#150;vi). Besides some token bequests to his mother and siblings, Ann Oldys inherited all of the estate, including two houses in Kensington said to be already in her possession. Oldys fathered his only child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20699/', "William Oldys (1696&#150;1761)")</script>, the well-known antiquary and bibliographer, in that relationship. He inherited Oldys's property from his mother in 1711.<br>
