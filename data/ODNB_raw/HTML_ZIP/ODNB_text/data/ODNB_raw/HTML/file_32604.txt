<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cox, Sir  Percy Zachariah</span>  (1864&#150;1937), <span class="occ">diplomatist and colonial administrator</span>, was born on 20 November 1864 at Herongate, Essex, the youngest of the three sons of Arthur Zachariah Cox, formerly Button (<i>d</i>. 1870), of Harwood Hall, Essex, deputy lieutenant of the county, and his wife Julienne Emily, younger daughter of Richard Saunders of Largey, co. Cavan, and Hawley House, Kent. He was educated at Harrow School and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. In 1884 he obtained a commission with the 2nd Cameronians, then stationed in India. In 1889 he joined the Indian Staff Corps, and on 14 November he married (Louisa) Belle, youngest daughter of Surgeon-General John Butler Hamilton. Soon afterwards he held minor appointments in the Maratha states of Kolhapur and Savantvadi.<br>
<br>In 1893 Cox left India for the protectorate of British Somaliland, at that time governed by the resident at Aden as a dependency of the government of India, and after this his career progressed rapidly. He was appointed assistant political resident at Zeila, transferred to the principal port of Berbera in 1894, and in May 1895 was made captain of a punitive expedition against the Rer Hared clan, which had blocked trade routes and was raiding coastal groups. Despite having at his command only 52 trained Indian and Somali troops and 1500 untrained and inefficient irregulars, he defeated the Rer Hared in only six weeks. The expedition had not been officially approved from Aden, but its success established Cox's reputation for military acumen and general ability. Later that year he was promoted assistant to the viceroy's agent in Baroda.<br>
<br>The next turning point in Cox's career came in 1899. He was intending to join the American explorer A. Donaldson-Smith in an expedition to the regions between the River Nile and Lake Rudolf, when the new viceroy of India, Lord Curzon, offered him the chance to become political agent and consul at Muscat (in what became Oman). He took up the post in October 1899 and was to spend virtually the rest of his career in the Middle East. His immediate task required all his powers of tact. Britain and France had both recognized the independence of Muscat, but the British had signed a secret land convention with its ruler, Sultan Feisal, and regarded the area as part of their informal empire, while the French not only gave protection to the local trade in slaves but leased a coaling station from Feisal. As a result Feisal had been ordered to board the British ship <i>Eclipse</i>, whose guns were trained on his palace, reprimanded, and told that the subsidy from the government of India had been removed. This was the tense situation which Cox inherited and which he had to try to assuage. He succeeded remarkably well, so that the subsidy was restored, French influence was curtailed, and Feisal even agreed to send his son to the Delhi Durbar of 1903. In the same year Curzon visited Muscat, judging that Cox virtually ran the place, and invested Feisal with the GCIE. Cox himself had become a CIE in 1902.<br>
<br>In 1904 Cox was promoted acting political resident in the Persian Gulf as well as consul-general for the Persian provinces of Fars, Lurestan, and Khuzestan. He became resident in 1909. He had responsibility for the defence of the region, no easy task after the Persian revolution of 1905&#150;7 and one which twice necessitated the calling in of imperial forces, to Bushehr in 1909 and Shiraz in 1911. He had also to promote British interests generally. One means for achieving this was his support of Sheikh Khazaal of Muhammarah, bordering Turkey in the Euphrates delta: he promised British aid when Turkey threatened aggression, and in return Khazaal leased the Shatt al-&#145;Arab, on the Euphrates estuary, to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for the construction of refineries and an oil pipeline. At Kuwait Cox improved relations with the local ruler, Mubarak, and opened negotiations with Ibn Sa&#145;ud, the Wahabi ruler of Nejd who was eventually to extend his territories to cover virtually the whole of modern-day Saudi Arabia. Also to Cox's credit stands his promotion of British trade in the gulf, which more than doubled in value from 1904 to 1914, the suppression of the arms trade, and improvements in communications. He was created KCIE in 1911.<br>
<br>Cox (Kokkus to the Arabs) was highly respected for several reasons. He was a quick, efficient, and tireless worker; he was incorruptible; he had a genuine interest in the local people; he was shrewd and patient; he had a fine command of Arabic; and he was conspicuously silent, a trait which impressed the Arabs. He was also a popular and easily recognisable figure&#151;tall, thin, and with a crooked nose, the result of an injury received in a football match. He was to become more popular still from 1914, when Turkey's entry into the First World War led Britain to promote Arab nationalism in the Persian Gulf.<br>
<br>Cox became secretary to the government of India early in 1914, but the outbreak of war saw his dispatch back to the gulf as chief political officer with the Indian expeditionary force. He was promoted an honorary major-general in the course of the war, and saw some action with Major-General Charles Townshend, but his main role was administrative and political. He masterminded the army's political relations in Mesopotamia. Baghdad was taken in March 1917 and Jerusalem in December. Palestine and Syria fell the following year. Before this, however, the campaigns against the Turks were long and arduous, and allies were needed. Cox's main contribution was to encourage the resistance of Ibn Sa&#145;ud, who was also being wooed by Turkey. In December 1915 Ibn Sa&#145;ud and Cox met at the Hasa oasis and signed a treaty whereby Britain was to grant a subsidy of &pound;5000 a month. On the other hand the Foreign Office was encouraging Ibn Sa&#145;ud's arch-rival Sherif Hussein as the spearhead of an Arab nationalism which would help defeat the Turks. Cox knew that his treaty with Ibn Sa&#145;ud and the championing of Hussein were incompatible. But there could be no thought of resigning during the war, and instead he had to pretend to the Wahabi ruler that Britain's championing of the Sherif was not as serious as it seemed. As a sop, Ibn Sa&#145;ud was knighted. Cox himself was made KCSI in 1915 and GCIE in 1917.<br>
<br>Britain's policy in the Middle East was in many ways Machiavellian. As well as encouraging local rulers, Britain and France, in the Sykes&#150;Picot agreement, decided to divide the region into spheres of influence. This dual policy was apparent in Mesopotamia (soon to be called Iraq): Britain accepted a League of Nations mandate for the region and at the same time set up an Arab administration which it aimed to control.<br>
<br>After the armistice in November 1918 Cox became acting-minister in Tehran, where he negotiated a (largely ineffectual) Anglo-Persian treaty, but in June 1920 he was appointed KCMG and made high commissioner in Iraq, where during the previous month a widespread revolt had broken out, largely in protest at the power exercised by British officials. Having arrived in Baghdad on 11 October 1920 to replace Sir Arnold Wilson, he embarked on the most important work of his career. His first action was to set up a council of state under the venerable naqib of Baghdad. Policy was hammered out in detail at the Cairo conference, with colonial secretary Winston Churchill, in March 1921. Initially Churchill had been in favour of withdrawing from the region, which was proving a drain on the exchequer and over whose boundaries there were numerous disputes: he advised maintaining a presence only at the Basrah oilfields. But Cox, ably supported by Gertrude Bell, his oriental secretary, argued strongly in favour of remaining and of setting up an Arab regime under Feisal, son of Sherif Hussein. Cox had Feisal named king of Iraq in July 1921, after he had sent the main rival claimant to the throne into exile. His accession was confirmed by a referendum later that month. Soon there was not a single British officer with executive power, Cox's men having to exercise influence as unobtrusively as possible.<br>
<br>It was a situation fraught with difficulty. In particular there was agitation that the mandate, which local people thought signified a degrading tutelage, should be replaced by a treaty. Cox accepted this, with the proviso that Britain should still be the mandatory power for Iraq at the League of Nations; but negotiating its provisions proved problematic. Feisal wanted to retain good relations with Britain, but his standing with Iraqis depended on his being seen not to be a British puppet. The British wanted a malleable figurehead, but he aspired to be a sovereign monarch. He dismissed several ministers without consulting Cox and he was loath to sign a 20-year treaty which pledged his willingness to be guided by the high commissioner on key issues. Cox began to feel that Feisal had &#145;unmistakably displayed the cloven hoof &hellip; he is without doubt both crooked and insincere&#146;  (Pearce, 69), and he was considering exiling him. A crisis was reached in August 1922, when a demonstration against Cox took place in the grounds of the king's palace, and the high commissioner demanded an apology from Feisal for this insult. Feisal was saved by a convenient attack of appendicitis a few days later: he took to his bed on 24 August 1922 and the compliant naqib signed the treaty in his absence, while Cox had a number of leading anti-British critics arrested. Cox followed up this success by meeting Ibn Sa&#145;ud for a second time at &#145;Uqair on the shore of the Hasa. Not only did he persuade Ibn Sa&#145;ud to recognize the kingdom of Iraq but, for the first time, he secured his agreement to limit his territory: where he and Cox disagreed over the precise boundaries on the map, they accepted that there should be a neutral zone between the two frontier lines. Cox was appointed GCMG in 1922, and he left Iraq for retirement in Britain on 4 May 1923, when the omens for the future of the new state looked relatively auspicious. According to one expert, &#145;he had done more than any other man to establish the infant Iraq state on a foundation of something like security&#146;  (Coke, 308).<br>
<br>In retirement Cox received honorary degrees from the universities of Oxford (1925) and Manchester (1929). He was president of the Royal Geographical Society (1933&#150;1936) and chairman of the Mount Everest committee. He died on 20 February 1937 while hunting at Melchbourne, near Bedford. His wife, who had spent long periods with Cox abroad and who was appointed DBE in 1923, survived him; his only son was killed in action in 1917 and his only daughter died at birth.<br>
