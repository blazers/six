<span class="headword">MacGill,  James, of Cranstoun Riddel</span>, first viscount of Oxfurd  (<em>d.</em> 1663), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was the second son of David MacGill of Cranstoun Riddel (<i>d</i>. 1607), king's advocate, and his wife, Marie (<i>d</i>. 1606), eldest daughter of Sir William Sinclair of Herdmanstoun, and his wife, Sibil. On 10 July 1619 he was served heir to his elder brother, David. By contract dated 20 December 1621 he married his first wife, Katherine, eldest daughter of John Cockburn of Ormiston. They had three sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>In July 1625 MacGill was named as one of the justices of the peace for Edinburghshire qualified to act as sheriff. On 22 August 1626 he accepted the sheriffship of Edinburgh, and became sheriff-principal in 1628. He was created a baronet on 19 July 1627, and was admitted an ordinary lord of session on 3 November 1629, after which the court chose him to oversee the collection of the tax of 40<i>s</i>. Scots in every pound land of old extent that had been granted them for their use. The heritors of Edinburghshire elected him their commissioner to the convention of the estates in 1630. In 1631 he was appointed to the commission created to survey Scotland's laws with a view to harmonizing them with those of England, and in 1632 was involved in the discussions on Charles I's plans for fishing.<br>
<br>It appears that MacGill was sympathetic to the covenanters, as he was a commissioner of exchequer in 1644 and 1645, on the committee of war for Edinburghshire in 1647 and 1648, and a member of the committee of estates in 1651. On 19 April that year Charles II created him viscount of Oxfurd and Lord MacGill of Cousland, but the English occupation of Scotland prevented his assuming the title. During the occupation he was among those approved by the protector's Scottish council in 1656 as a justice of the peace for Edinburghshire, and was named as a commissioner of the cess for the same county in 1655, 1656, and 1660.<br>
<br>Following the Restoration, Oxfurd was again appointed a judge, although he did not take up his seat, and was named a commissioner of exchequer. In 1661 he sat in parliament as Viscount Oxenford. He died on 5 May 1663, and was buried three days later in Cranston kirk. He was survived by his second wife, Christian (<i>d</i>. 1664), daughter of Sir William Livingston of Kilsyth, whom he had married by contract dated 8 July 1646. Although this marriage had also produced many children&#151;five sons and four daughters&#151;at least five of Oxfurd's sons predeceased him, and he was succeeded as second viscount by Christian's third son, Robert (1651&#150;1705).<br>
