<span class="headword">Flack,  Walter</span>  (1915/16&#150;1963), <span class="occ">property developer</span>, was the son of Jewish parents who had wanted him to become a solicitor; but having failed five times to matriculate at secondary school he drifted into estate agency. During the 1930s he worked at the West End agents Dudley Samuel and Harrison, where several of Britain's leading post-war property developers obtained their initial experience in the property market.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Flack enlisted in the Eighth Army, where he rose to the rank of sergeant. His commander, Field Marshal Sir Claude Auchinleck, subsequently became non-executive chairman of Flack's property company. Flack returned to Dudley Samuel and Harrison after the war, working as a negotiator, but was sacked following a dispute with Dudley Samuel, who objected to his smoking a long, curly pipe in the office. After working for another agency, Marcus Leaver, Flack formed his own agency, together with two partners, in 1949.<br>
<br>Flack began his property development activities about 1956. Two years later he formed his own development company, purchasing a shell company, Murrayfield, for &pound;11,000. This became the vehicle for the developments he had initiated during the previous two years, to which a substantial number of other projects were soon added. Flack has been described as having &#145;an engagingly open, buccaneering manner &hellip; people tended either to like and trust him at once or be suspicious of his charm&#146;  (Marriott, 124). Flack concentrated on the provincial shop market, an area which many developers neglected prior to the 1960s. He and his right-hand man, Alan Wright, were talented at putting people at their ease, a useful skill for shop developers as long negotiations with council officials were a necessary preliminary to development. Another of his associates at Murrayfield was Frank Price (<i>b</i>. 1922), an aggressive, controversial Birmingham politician, who served as leader of the Birmingham Labour Party, and was also lord mayor in 1964&#150;5. Price's Labour background proved extremely useful, since the majority of the councils which launched ambitious town centre redevelopment schemes during this period were Labour-controlled.<br>
<br>Flack's first major development was a group of shops in the middle of Basildon. Basildon New Town Corporation had decided that Flack's scheme was the best designed and most practical, but had doubts regarding his financial standing. After the problem was put to Flack he got up from his seat and started walking up and down the council chamber. He stared at the carpet in deep thought and then suddenly stopped, looked up, and said to the committee: &#145;I've got the answer, I'll give you my personal guarantee&#146;  (Gordon, 175). This won the committee over and Flack was given time to find the necessary finance.<br>
<br>In order to solve the problem of financing his ever-growing activities Flack formed a partnership with Jack Cotton (1903&#150;1964) at the end of 1959, involving an exchange of shares between Murrayfield and Cotton's City Centre Properties. The deal also entailed Cotton's lending Flack money for his developments. In 1960 Cotton merged his property empire with that of Charles Clore. Clore was said to have disliked the boisterous Flack, the antipathy being reciprocated on Flack's part. Murrayfield was completely amalgamated into the City Centre group in May 1961. Marriott stated that Flack vehemently opposed the merger  (Marriott, 147), while Gordon recalled that Flack was keen for Murrayfield to become a 100 per cent City Centre subsidiary, partly because this would secure him a seat on the latter's board  (Gordon, 175).<br>
<br>The merger resulted in Flack's becoming a director of City Centre, Britain's largest property company. However the mutual antipathy between himself and Clore, together with Clore's own growing personality clashes with Cotton, resulted in a steady deterioration of the relationship between the three property tycoons. Flack found himself opposing the plans of both Cotton and Clore and the continuing strife began to take its toll on Flack's health, exacerbated by a growing drinking problem. In 1962 the marriage between Flack and his wife, Louise, broke up and in the autumn of that year he suffered a severe attack of jaundice. Following his recovery he had an explosive disagreement with Cotton, culminating in his resignation from both City Centre and Murrayfield on 15 January 1963. On 22 March, following his return home from a long holiday in north Africa, Flack, who was only forty-seven, was found drowned at his home, 80 Whitehall Court, Westminster, by his chauffeur. He had taken a dose of barbiturate, and fallen asleep in his bath. He was pronounced dead at Westminster Hospital; the coroner's verdict was one of accidental drowning.<br>
<br>Flack was a keen sports enthusiast, particularly with regard to cricket and horse racing. In 1961 he co-owned the colt Winged Pharaoh. Another of Flack's hobbies was to serve behind the bar of his local pub in Westminster on Sundays. However, during his years with Murrayfield he had lived largely for his property company. Flack's legacy as a property developer included a number of innovative and successful shopping centre schemes, particularly the St George's Shopping Centre in Preston. He was also the first British developer to expand into the continent, developing eighty-eight luxury flats on the avenue Foch in Paris. However it is his unfortunate association with City Centre Properties, resulting in the personality clash which contributed to his early death, for which Flack will be chiefly remembered; Cotton's own death followed exactly a year later.<br>
