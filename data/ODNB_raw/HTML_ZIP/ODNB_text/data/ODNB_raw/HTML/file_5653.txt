<span class="headword">Clifford,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1622, <em>d.</em> 1698), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and musician</span>, son of Edward Clifford, a cook, was born at Oxford, in the parish of St Mary Magdalen, where he was baptized on 2 May 1622. He had three brothers and two sisters. He was a chorister at Magdalen College from 1632 to 1642 and was educated in the choir school, but he took no degree at Oxford. On 1 July 1661 Clifford was appointed tenth minor canon of St Paul's Cathedral, London, where he later became sixth minor canon (1675), senior cardinal (1682), and sacrist (1682). He was for some years curate of St Gregory by St Paul's, a post he seems to have resigned before September 1695, in which month he was succeeded by Charles Green. He was also chaplain to the Society of Serjeants' Inn, Fleet Street.<br>
<br>In 1663 Clifford published the first edition of the work for which he is best known, <span class="italic">The divine services and anthems usually sung in the cathedrals and collegiate choires in the Church of England</span>. This is a collection of the words of 172 anthems by composers ranging from William Byrd and Thomas Tallis of the Elizabethan period to Henry Lawes and William Child, both of whom were active church musicians until the prohibition of choral services during the civil war. In 1664 Clifford published a second edition with many additions, which took the total to 406 anthems and included brand new works by Matthew Locke, Pelham Humfrey, and John Blow. <span class="italic">The Divine Services</span> also contains &#145;Brief directions for the understanding of that part of the divine service performed with the organ in S. Pauls Cathedral&#146;, a &#145;Scale or basis of musick&#146; by Ralph Winterton, regius professor of medicine at Cambridge, and a &#145;Psalm of Thanksgiving&#146;, sung by the children of Christ's Hospital, set to music by Thomas Brewer. The book is a valuable record of Restoration choral regeneration.<br>
<br>In 1694 Clifford published <span class="italic">A catechism containing the principles of Christian religion &hellip; with a preparation sermon before the receiving of the holy sacrament of the Lord's supper</span>. He was twice married. His first wife's name is unknown, but on 30 May 1667 he obtained a licence for his marriage at St Dunstan-in-the-West, or the chapel of Serjeants' Inn, with Clare Fisher of the parish of St Gregory by St Paul's. His son was baptized at St Gregory's on 2 May 1679 and buried there in 1684. Clifford died in September 1698. His will (dated 16 June 1687) was proved on 26 September by his widow, who after her husband's death lived with her daughter in Wardrobe Court, Great Carter Lane, where the two women kept a school for small children. By his will Clifford left all his music to be divided among the minor canons of St Paul's.<br>
