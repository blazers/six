<span class="headword">Kirke,  Edward</span>  (1553&#150;1613), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in London, where he attended St Anthony's School. He was a sizar at Pembroke College, Cambridge, matriculating in 1571 (Spenser matriculated in 1569; Gabriel Harvey was made a fellow in 1570). He transferred to Gonville and Caius College about 1574/5 and was awarded BA in 1574/5 and MA in 1578. He was ordained rector of St Giles, Risby, Suffolk, on 26 May 1580, on the institution of Sir Thomas Kytson, a post which he held until his death. Kytson was the uncle of the Spenser sisters of Althorp&#151;Elizabeth, Anne, and Alice&#151;to whom Spenser referred in <span class="italic">Colin Clouts Come Home Againe</span> (1591). One of Kirke's account books shows that he bought &#145;a shepard's Calendar&#146; for 2<i>s</i>. in 1583, possibly Spenser's poem. Kirke was made rector of Lackford, the adjoining parish, on 21 August 1587 and chaplain to Lord Darcy in 1603. He died at Risby on 10 November 1613, at the age of sixty, and was buried in the chancel of St Giles, where his tomb is marked by a brass. Kirke made a will on 7 November, in which he left various small sums to his relatives and friends. He mentions a wife, Helen; a daughter, Margaret, married to George Whiter; and another son-in-law, Richard Buckle.<br>
<br>Kirke is notable because he may have been the E. K. who wrote the notes to Edmund Spenser's <span class="italic">The Shepheardes Calender</span> (1579). On this basis, and one or two other tantalising references in Spenser's letters to Gabriel Harvey, Kirke is conjectured to have been a close friend of his university contemporary. However, the evidence that Kirke was the author of the glosses and notes to Spenser's <span class="italic">Shepheardes Calender</span> is inconclusive. Spenser must have known Kirke, given their proximity at Pembroke College. In his letter of 16 October 1579 to Gabriel Harvey from Leicester House, published as one of the <span class="italic">Three Proper and Wittie, Familiar Letters</span> (1580), Spenser states that &#145;Maister E. K. hartily desireth to be commended unto your Worshippe&#146; and refers to &#145;hys paynefull and dutifull Verses of your selfe&#146;. In the next paragraph Spenser states that he has received a letter from Harvey at &#145;Mystresse <i>Kerkes</i>&#146; and later writes that Harvey can always send him letters &#145;safely to me by <i>Mistresse Kerke</i>, and by none other&#146;. In another of the letters Spenser refers to the gloss to <span class="italic">The Shepheardes Calender</span>, in which &#145;be some things excellently, and many things wittily, discoursed of E. K.&#146; Furthermore in a note to the May eclogue in the calendar E. K. translates the epitaph to the Greek king Sardanaplus in exactly the same way that Spenser himself does in his three letters.<br>
<br>This last detail indicates either that E. K. may have been Spenser himself, as some scholars argue, or that he was indeed a close friend of Spenser's, making Edward Kirke a prime candidate. It is also possible that the Mistress Kerke referred to in the published letters is Edward's widowed mother, as Alexander Grossart suggested. But, given the bantering and iconoclastic style and tone of the letters, it is equally possible that Mistress Kerke is a fictional character, a literary device, or even a lost joke. Certainly the reader does not have to take everything in the published letters on trust.<br>
<br>The same is true of <span class="italic">The Shepheardes Calender</span>. E. K. may well have been a genuine commentator on the poem, in which case Kirke is once again a plausible candidate. However, it should not be overlooked that it is extremely unlikely that Spenser simply wrote the poem and passed it on to a publisher, who decided to include a commentary with or without the poet's permission; some scholars have argued that Spenser generally saw his works through the press with painstaking attention to detail. The text of <span class="italic">The Shepheardes Calender</span> is designed to imitate a classical work with commentary, of the type that European humanists were publishing throughout the second half of the sixteenth century. In doing so the young poet announces his arrival on the literary scene by comparing his work to that of established ancient writers. No English writer had attempted anything so audacious before. The commentary provided by E. K. is full of odd readings and some judgements that neither Spenser nor their author was likely to have believed. As David R. Shore notes, though E. K. claims that &#145;by meanes of some familiar acquaintance I was made privie to his [Spenser's] counsell and secret meaning in them&#146;, &#145;in fact, he solves few of the mysteries that have intrigued those attracted to the <span class="italic">Calender</span>'s historical allegory&#146;  (Hamilton and others, 231). It is likely that the author of the poem intended such secrecy. If E. K. was Edward Kirke it is probable, as Alexander Judson suggested  (Judson, 40), that he composed the commentary and glossary as a riddle, sometimes telling the truth, sometimes misleading the reader and hiding information, probably in collaboration with Spenser and Harvey.<br>
