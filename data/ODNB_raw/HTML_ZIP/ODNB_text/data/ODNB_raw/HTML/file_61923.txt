<span class="headword">Schomberg,  Reginald Charles Francis</span>  (1880&#150;1958), <span class="occ">army officer and explorer</span>, was born on 19 September 1880 at 4 Russell Terrace, Lower Walmer, Kent, the elder of two children, and only son, of Reginald Brodrick Schomberg (1849&#150;1932), barrister, and his wife, Frances Sophia (1839&#150;1922), daughter of Thomas Charles Morris, gentleman, of Llansteffan and his wife, Mary. He was descended from the physician Meyer Low Schomberg (1690&#150;1761). His parents were Roman Catholic: his father had converted while a student at New College, Oxford. Schomberg spent a happy childhood at the family home in Upper Richmond Road in south-west London. Educated at the Oratory School, Edgbaston, Birmingham (1892&#150;8), he then went up to New College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1901. In 1901 he was commissioned in the 1st battalion Seaforth Highlanders and from 1902 to 1911 he served in India. He saw action as part of the Indian frontier expedition in 1908, and used every leave to visit remote parts of the Himalayan foothills and central Baluchistan. In 1911 he went home to Chasewood Lodge, Ross-on-Wye, the house to which the family had moved in 1910, before taking up a post with the Malay states' guides. In Malaya he spent his leave trekking across remote parts of the Malay peninsula.<br>
<br>In 1915 Schomberg returned to the Seaforths in Mesopotamia and in 1916 he was severely wounded during an attack on Turkish positions at Sunnaiyat, an action for which he was awarded the DSO. After a period of recuperation in Britain he returned to Mesopotamia. On the way, his ship was torpedoed 150 miles east of Malta. He was again wounded, less severely this time, during the attack on Tikrit in 1917, an action for which he received a bar to his DSO. From 1917 to 1919 he commanded the 1st battalion in Mesopotamia and Palestine. While in Palestine he took the opportunity to wander round Jerusalem and other sites central to his faith. After the war he returned to Malaya. From 1919 he was commandant, Singapore volunteer corps, and from 1920 inspector of prisons, Straits Settlements. He resigned in 1921, partly for health reasons. The return of the Seaforths to Scotland and a dislike of life in Britain after the war saw him transfer to the 2nd battalion, with the rank of major, and return to India in 1922. After a visit to Changchenmo, Ladakh, in 1923, he revived plans which he had made before the war to visit Central Asia and Tibet. He retired in December 1927.<br>
<br>The first journey was made in 1926 and was followed by longer journeys in 1927&#150;9 and 1930&#150;31, for which Schomberg received the Royal Geographical Society's Gill memorial medal. He inspired great loyalty in the small group of men whom he often referred to as his &#145;slaves&#146;. These were led by Daulat Shah, who managed his camp and transport. He enjoyed big game hunting, but there was a more serious side to his explorations. Like many other people at the time, he saw a danger to India if communism were to infiltrate Sinkiang (Xinjiang). He therefore combined intelligence-gathering with his recording of geographical, ethnographical, and botanical information as he wandered over areas rarely, if ever, visited by Europeans. He wrote a popular account of these journeys entitled <span class="italic">Peaks and Plains of Central Asia</span> (1933). Travels between 1933 and 1936 in remote areas across the north-west frontier of India, from Afghanistan to Ladakh, were related in three further books: <span class="italic">Between the Oxus and the Indus</span> (1935), <span class="italic">Unknown Karakorum</span> (1936), and <span class="italic">Kafirs and Glaciers</span> (1938). He wrote many articles and reviews for the <span class="italic">Alpine Journal</span>, the <span class="italic">Geographical Journal</span>, the <span class="italic">Himalayan Journal</span>, the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Central Asian Society</span>, and the <span class="italic">Scottish Geographical Journal</span>. Schomberg's reports of conditions in Sinkiang in the 1920s and 1930s are at the Public Record Office and in the British Library oriental and India Office collections. Photographs and accounts of later travels are at the Royal Society for Asian Affairs. From 1936 to 1944 Schomberg served in a number of diplomatic posts. During 1936&#150;7 and 1938&#150;41 he was British consul-general in the French establishments in India; from November 1939 he was in addition consul-general for Portuguese possessions in India. He was consular liaison officer, Persia (1942&#150;3), and then customs, Perso-Indian frontier (1943&#150;4). In 1937 he was made a CIE. From 1944 to 1945 he was colonel, force 136 (part of the Special Operations Executive), China. Throughout these years he continued to explore new territory whenever he could: Baltistan in 1937 and Ladakh in 1944, 1945, and 1946.<br>
<br>Schomberg was 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighed about 10 stone. He was fit and was once described as having walked from Kashmir to Kashgar six times. An honours degree in history and competence in Latin, French, Urdu, Pushtu, Persian, and Turkish were combined with an acutely observant eye and a dry wit which made him an entertaining companion. He was impatient with hypocrisy, pomposity, and what he saw as unnecessary bureaucracy: an India Office memo in 1929 described him as a candid but by no means factious critic. Friends described him not only as tough but also as courteous, considerate, and possessing a natural charm. His army life and what a friend called the spirit of a born traveller, going where the spirit moved him, made Schomberg unsuitable for a settled life. He never married but remained devoted to his parents, his unmarried sister Mary, and his aunts.<br>
<br>Schomberg was a deeply religious man and in 1947 he decided finally to devote the remainder of his life to his church. From 1947 to 1951 he studied for the priesthood at the Collegio Beda, Rome, and was ordained at the basilica of St John Lateran. Between 1952 and 1953 he assisted with parish work at Ringwood, Hampshire; from 1953 to 1954 he was chaplain to the Assisi Home, Grayshot, and from 1954 to 1957 chaplain to the convent of the Sisters of St Joseph, Boars Hill, Oxford. Shortly after he retired in December 1957, Schomberg had a fall at home and fractured his skull. He died at Hereford General Hospital on 1 March 1958 and was buried at Belmont Abbey, Hereford.<br>
