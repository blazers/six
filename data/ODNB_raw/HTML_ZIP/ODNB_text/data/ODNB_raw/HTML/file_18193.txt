<span class="headword">Martin,  John</span>  (1791&#150;1855), <span class="occ">bibliographer</span>, was born on 16 September 1791 in London, the son of John Martin of 112 Mount Street, Grosvenor Square. He was apprenticed on 1 October 1805 to William Ginger, a Westminster bookseller, but soon afterwards turned over on 6 May 1806 to John Hatchard of Piccadilly, the publisher and bookseller with whom he served the remainder of his apprenticeship. He gained his freedom of the Stationers' Company on 6 October 1812. By 1815 he had opened his own bookshop at 23 Holles Street, Cavendish Square, but about 1819 entered into partnership with John Rodwell at 46 New Bond Street. He retired from business in 1826, but continued his bibliographical pursuits. He edited Gray's &#145;Bard&#146; (1837) and Gray's &#145;Elegy&#146; (1836, 1839, and 1854) with illustrations from drawings by the Hon. Mrs John Talbot, and <span class="italic">The Seven Ages of Shakespeare</span> (1840 and 1848), illustrated with wood-engravings. The production of these and other books illustrated by George Cruikshank, George Cattermole, and William Mulready was the means of introducing him to the leading artists of the day. He was a good friend of John Constable and a keen promoter of the use of original wood-engraving in book illustration. For many years, until 1845, he acted as secretary to the Artists' Benevolent Fund.<br>
<br>In 1834 Martin published his important and still useful <span class="italic">Bibliographical Catalogue of Books Privately Printed</span>, a second edition of which was issued in 1854. The first edition contains an account of private presses and book clubs, which Martin omitted from the second edition, but at the time of his death he was preparing a separate volume, which was to contain this portion of the first edition with additions. His correspondence of 1828&#150;55 about privately printed books is now in the British Library.<br>
<br>Following the death of his wife, Elizabeth, in 1836 Martin was appointed librarian to the duke of Bedford at Woburn Abbey. For the rest of his life he lived at Froxfield, in the parish of Eversholt, near Woburn, in a house previously occupied by the writer J. H. Wiffen. Between 1845 and 1854 he visited nearly every church in Bedfordshire, and wrote a description of each in a series of articles which appeared over the pseudonym W. A. (for Woburn Abbey) in the <span class="italic">Bedford Times</span> and <span class="italic">Northampton Mercury</span>; the full text of each article is being reprinted in three volumes by the Bedfordshire Historical Record Society. Martin's articles promoted Tractarian ideals, drawing attention to widespread neglect and abuses in church worship and furnishings. Controversial and challenging, the series had a profound influence on churchmen in the county. Martin also played an active part in the local community, soliciting funds for a new school at Eversholt through the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> in April 1841.<br>
<br>Martin also wrote a <span class="italic">History and Description of Woburn and its Abbey</span> (1845), a shortened and rearranged version of J. D. Parry's book published in 1831. At the request of Lord John Russell he compiled an <span class="italic">Enquiry into the authority for a statement in Echard's History of England regarding William, Lord Russell</span>, which was printed for private circulation in 1852 and published in 1856. It refuted the assertion that Lord Russell opposed the mitigation of the punishment of Viscount Stafford for high treason when sheriffs Bethel and Cornish presented their petition in the House of Commons on 23 December 1680. Martin also furnished some notes to Lord John Russell's edition of the <span class="italic">Letters</span> of Rachel, Lady Russell (1853), and in 1855 he published a translation of Guizot's essay on <span class="italic">The Married Life of Rachel, Lady Russell</span>. He left unfinished an edition of the <span class="italic">Letters of the Earl of Chatham to his Nephew</span>. He was a fellow of both the Society of Antiquaries and the Linnean Society.<br>
<br>Martin died on 30 December 1855 at Froxfield, and was buried in Eversholt churchyard on 4 January 1856. Three of his six children survived him. His eldest son, John Edward Martin (<i>d</i>. 1893), became sub-librarian and afterwards librarian to the Inner Temple. In 1899 a stained glass window in memory of John Martin was put up by his grandchildren in the south aisle of Eversholt church.<br>
