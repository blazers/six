<span class="headword">Hill <span class="st"> [Hull]</span>,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1423<span class="mult">x</span>5), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was one of a west-country family that included several lawyers in the later fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. His father was perhaps also called Robert. The relationship of the Hills to each other is not always clear, and particular care is needed to distinguish the judge from his contemporary namesake, Robert Hill of Spaxton, Somerset, who was son of Sir John Hill, justice of the king's bench from 1389 to <i>c</i>.1408, and who died in 1423 after a career in estate management in Somerset and Devon.<br>
<br>Robert Hill the future judge doubtless began his legal career by acting for west-country clients, and in 1384&#150;5 was one of the lawyers retained for their counsel by Edward Courtenay, earl of Devon. He was described in a list of these lawyers as &#145;Robert Hull the son&#146;  (BL, Additional Roll 64320), to distinguish him from &#145;Robert Hull the father&#146;  (ibid.) who was similarly retained; Sir John Hill the future judge was a member of the earl's household at this date.<br>
<br>Hill was MP for various Devon towns: both Dartmouth and Tavistock in 1372; Plympton in 1373, 1377 (twice), and 1380; and Exeter in 1379. In all of the election returns save two for Plympton he is described as Robert Hill junior. He made his career as a lawyer based partly in the Westminster courts, and he joined the Inner Inn; he gained the entr&eacute;e to the court of common pleas by being made a serjeant-at-law in Michaelmas term 1388.<br>
<br>On 14 May 1408 Hill was appointed a justice of the court of common pleas, and was reappointed on the accessions of Henry V and Henry VI. In 1421 and 1422, following the death of Richard Norton, he acted as chief justice of common pleas, though he was never formally appointed to that office. His salary was last paid at Easter 1423, although he may have lived until 1424 or 1425.<br>
<br>Since Hill settled at Shilston, in Modbury, Devon, he is probably to be identified as the Robert Hill who married Isabel, daughter of Sir John Wadham (justice of the common pleas, 1388&#150;97) and Elizabeth, daughter and coheir of William Shilston of Shilston. They had several children, his heir being Robert, who according to one account was born in 1392. Isabel must have predeceased her husband, who by 1419 was married to Joan, daughter and heir of Sir Otho Bodrugan; she survived Hill, and married Sir John Trevarthyan, or Trevaygnoun, before dying in 1427 or 1428.<br>
