<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Williams,  Kenneth Charles</span>  (1926&#150;1988), <span class="occ">actor and comedian</span>, was born on 22 February 1926 at Bingfield Street, off the Caledonian Road, London, the younger child and only son of Charles George Williams, manager of a hairdressing salon in Marchmont Street, King's Cross, London, and his wife, Louisa Alexandra Morgan (1901&#150;1991), who assisted in the hairdresser's. He had theatrical aspirations from an early age, although his father, a Methodist, had a hatred of loose morals and effeminacy and thought the theatre epitomized both. The young Kenneth Williams, on the other hand, found acting &#145;instinctive, involuntary and authentic&#146;, attributes which marked his theatrical career in later years. He received his formal education at Lyulph Stanley School, Mornington Crescent, and from 1940 studied at the Bolt Court School of Lithography in Fleet Street, where he trained as a draughtsman.<br>
<br>Called up for national service in the army in 1944, Williams served as a sapper in the cartography section of the Royal Engineers and later as a poster designer and actor in combined services entertainment, when stationed in Singapore. There, in company with such aspiring actors, playwrights, and directors as Stanley Baxter, Peter Nichols, and John Schlesinger, his theatrical aspirations hardened and developed, and he toured army bases in the Far East in the revue <span class="italic">At your Service</span>.<br>
<br>Williams was demobilized in 1947 and by 1948 had become an established actor in various repertory companies, playing many different roles. By the early 1950s he had established his versatility. He made his d&eacute;but in films in a small part in the 1952 production of <span class="italic">Trent's Last Case</span>. In the same year he made his first television appearance in <span class="italic">The Wonderful Visit</span>, by H. G. Wells, in which he played the Angel. This was followed by more repertory. In 1954 he played the Dauphin in G. B. Shaw's <span class="italic">Saint Joan</span>, which led to his becoming the ubiquitous &#145;funny voice&#146; man in the BBC radio success <span class="italic">Hancock's Half Hour</span>.<br>
<br>In the theatre success followed success with Orson Welles's production of <span class="italic">Moby Dick</span> (1955), <span class="italic">Hotel Paradiso</span> (1956) with Alec Guinness, <span class="italic">Share my Lettuce</span> (1957), <span class="italic">Pieces of Eight</span> (1959), and <span class="italic">One Over the Eight</span> (1957). Then, most importantly, with Maggie Smith, to whom he was devoted, Williams acted in Peter Schaffer's <span class="italic">The Private Ear</span> and <span class="italic">The Public Eye</span> (double bill, 1962), followed by <span class="italic">Gentle Jack</span> (1963) with Dame Edith Evans, and <span class="italic">Loot</span> (1965) by Joe Orton, with whom Kenneth Williams developed a warm friendship. Later came <span class="italic">Captain Brassbound's Conversion</span> (1971), with Ingrid Bergman. His one flop was the 1956 production of Sandy Wilson's musical <span class="italic">The Buccaneer</span>, about a boys' magazine, in which Williams played the editor.<br>
<br>In 1958 Williams appeared in his first <span class="roman">Carry On</span> film, <span class="italic">Carry on Sergeant</span>, subsequently becoming a regular and playing in twenty-four <span class="roman">Carry On</span> films, all of them low farces. On radio he went from <span class="italic">Hancock's Half Hour</span> to <span class="italic">Beyond our Ken</span> in 1958, and later to <span class="italic">Round the Horne</span> in 1965, where his brilliant characterizations contributed considerably to the show's success. In 1968 he became the star of the radio quiz <span class="italic">Just a Minute</span>, a game in which the panellists are asked to talk on a given topic &#145;without repetition, deviation, or hesitation&#146;. Williams duly astonished chairman, cast, and listeners with his knowledge, erudition, humour, grasp of language, and simulated outrage when told he had deviated. One could hardly imagine him hesitating.<br>
<br>Williams, camp, slim, and dapper, was an amazingly versatile performer, able to switch from the vulgarities of the <span class="roman">Carry On</span> films and the louche characters of <span class="italic">Round the Horne</span> to more serious roles in plays by Jean Anouilh, Shakespeare, and Shaw. In addition he could be a sparkling raconteur, as he showed in the 1966&#150;7 television series <span class="italic">International Cabaret</span>, where his long monologues happily punctuated the mundane procession of jugglers and acrobats. He was also a capable chat show guest, always ready with a new anecdote, and on more than one occasion successfully deputized for Terry Wogan as chat show host.<br>
<br>The public persona of a loud, brash, verbose vulgarian was very different from Williams's private life, which was solitary, fastidious, and intellectual. He never married. His attitude to sex was ambivalent, for while he accepted his homosexual tendencies he found it difficult to consummate sexual relationships with either men or women. His writings included the books <span class="italic">Acid Drops</span> (theatrical anecdotes, 1980), <span class="italic">Back Drops</span> (personal anecdotes, 1983), and his autobiography, <span class="italic">Just Williams</span> (1985). His diaries were published posthumously in 1993.<br>
<br>In the last entry in his diary, 14 April 1988, Williams complained of &#145;immense&#146; exhaustion, pains in the back, and stomach trouble. He had never been physically robust and had a history of health problems, and it is likely he died as a result of accidentally taking an overdose of painkillers. Williams died in his sleep at his home, 8 Marlborough House, Osnaburgh Street, London, on 15 April 1988.<br>
