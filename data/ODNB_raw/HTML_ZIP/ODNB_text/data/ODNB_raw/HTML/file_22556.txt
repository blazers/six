<span class="headword">Porten, Sir  Stanier</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1716, <em>d.</em> 1789), <span class="occ">government official</span>, was the only son among the four children of James Porten (1665&#150;1750), merchant of London, of Huguenot descent, and Mary Allen. He was baptized on 26 June 1716 in Putney, Surrey, where his family lived in an old redbrick house adjoining Putney Bridge. His youngest sister, Judith, married on 3 June 1736 Edward Gibbon of Buriton, Hampshire, and their eldest son, Edward Gibbon the historian, spent many of his holidays in the Porten household in Putney. Following Judith Porten's death in 1747, Gibbon stayed with the Portens until the family was forced to leave the house at Christmas 1748 because of James Porten's failure in business. Thereafter, Gibbon was cared for by his eldest aunt, Catherine Porten (<i>d</i>. 1786), who established a boarding-house for Westminster School, which proved very successful.<br>
<br>Porten entered the diplomatic service, and for some years before 1760 he was British resident at the court of Naples. He was transferred in April 1760 to the post of consul-general at Madrid. In July 1766 he was appointed secretary to the extraordinary embassy of Lord Rochford to the court of France; he arrived in Paris on 31 August 1766. He compiled several reports in 1766&#150;7 on the terms &#145;of liquidating the Canada paper in France&#146;  (<span class="italic">Third Report</span>, HMC, appx, 138). In November 1768 he was appointed as under-secretary to Lord Rochford, then secretary of state for the northern department, and in December 1770 he followed Rochford to the southern department, where he remained under-secretary until 1782.<br>
<br>Gibbon wrote on 24 May 1774 that Porten was &#145;seriously in love&#146; with Miss W., &#145;an agreeable woman&#146;, and that he was &#145;seriously uneasy that his precarious situation precludes him from happiness. We shall soon see which will get the better, love or reason. I bet three to two on love&#146;  (<span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works</span>, 2.125). Gibbon's prophecy proved correct. Porten married Mary Wibault (1737&#150;1819) of Titchfield Street, London, on 29 December 1774. They had two surviving children: a son, Stanier James Porten (1779&#150;1854), and a daughter, Charlotte (1776&#150;1827), who married, on 7 February 1798, Henry Wise, rector of Charlwood.<br>
<br>Porten was knighted on 5 June 1772, appointed keeper of the state papers at Whitehall in 1774, and from 1782 until November 1787 was a commissioner of the customs. He was characterized as the &#145;man of business&#146; in his department, and as possessing a gravity of demeanour which was exaggerated by his long official residence at Naples and Madrid  (Hawkins, 2.7&#150;11). After &#145;long infirmities and gradual decay&#146; he died at Kensington Palace, London, on 7 June 1789. His widow was left with a moderate pension for her subsistence. Gibbon thereupon proposed adopting and educating the eldest child, Charlotte, &#145;a most amiable, sensible young creature&#146;, and rewarding &#145;her care and tenderness with a decent fortune&#146;  (<span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works</span>, 1.296), but Mary Porten would not be persuaded. By his will, dated 1 October 1791, Gibbon left his money to these two children, his nearest relatives on his mother's side.<br>
