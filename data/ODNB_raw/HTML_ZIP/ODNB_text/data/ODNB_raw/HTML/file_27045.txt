<span class="headword">Taylor <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Grimston]</span>,  John</span>  (1597&#150;1655), <span class="occ">diplomat</span>, was born in Yorkshire, the eldest of five children (three sons and two daughters) of Stephen Taylor (<i>d</i>. 1618) of Bickerton, steward of the earl of Cumberland, and his wife, Dowsabell (<i>fl</i>. 1597&#150;1620), daughter of William Grimston of Newport, Isle of Wight. His parents were both Roman Catholics and saw to it that he was brought up and educated in the Catholic faith. In 1612 he was enrolled in the English College, St Omer, in Flanders, where he studied for seven years. On 19 October 1619 he was admitted as a convictor at the English College, Rome. However, he decided to forgo a religious career and left in the late spring of 1621, after less than two years of study.<br>
<br>Taylor's whereabouts and activities during the following seven years are unclear, though it may have been during this time that he married Jane Gibbs; they had three children by 1639. Taylor settled upon a career in government service, and by 1628 he had secured his first government employment, probably on the strength of his language skills and contacts made through the earl of Cumberland. By 1630 he had begun serving as a diplomatic agent at foreign courts, particularly those of the Habsburgs in Vienna, Brussels, and Madrid. In his dealings abroad Taylor served the interests of the court party which supported peace with the Habsburgs. This was often a difficult task, for the emperor had deprived Charles I's brother-in-law, Frederick V of the Palatinate, of his hereditary lands and titles and parcelled them out to Spain and Bavaria. On his first known assignment Taylor gathered news in Brussels, where he was present in April 1630. He was soon sent to the empire in an unofficial capacity to promote a peaceful settlement of the Palatinate question, first at the electoral meeting at Regensburg in October and November 1630, and afterwards at the imperial court in Vienna. Despite his efforts and those of Sir Robert Anstruther, the accredited English ambassador to the emperor, no agreement was reached, and Taylor departed Vienna in August 1632. He returned to Brussels in October and resumed his news-gathering activities there for a time, but soon returned to England, where he was investigating a scheme to promote trade between Ireland and Spain for Wentworth in the summer of 1633.<br>
<br>Taylor quickly became more directly involved in Spanish affairs: from July 1634 to May 1635 he was employed on a diplomatic mission to Madrid to expedite negotiations for an Anglo-Spanish maritime treaty underway in England. In the estimation of Hopton, the English resident agent at Madrid, Taylor was &#145;a very honest and careful man&#146; who acquitted his duties there satisfactorily  (MS Clarendon 5, fol. 324). Soon after Taylor's return to England he secured an important post as resident agent to the imperial court in Vienna, where he arrived on 22 November 1635. He was instructed to remonstrate against the peace of Prague and offer the emperor a provisional alliance with England in return for satisfaction regarding the Palatinate. Taylor, ever hopeful of an agreement between England and the Habsburgs, allowed himself to be convinced that the emperor was willing to grant full restitution and sent home optimistic reports to this effect. On the basis of these reports Charles I sent the earl of Arundel as ambassador-extraordinary in 1636 to conclude the final settlement; however, he was soon disappointed in his mission and returned to England in disgust. Taylor remained at the imperial court to continue the negotiations, but his role was limited after the death of Ferdinand II in February 1637, since Charles I refused to recognize the new emperor, Ferdinand III, or to send Taylor fresh credentials. During the following two years Taylor continued to represent English interests at the imperial court. He was periodically reprimanded for indiscretions in his conduct of the negotiations, and was finally recalled in early 1639.<br>
<br>In April that year Taylor reached England and was soon called to account for promoting a conference with the Habsburgs at Brussels without the commission to do so. The real cause of his disgrace, however, was not his undertakings with the Habsburgs (which were covertly encouraged by the crown), but rather that their exposure prejudiced English negotiations for a French treaty underway at Hamburg. Taylor was committed to the Tower in September, where he remained for at least seven months. In dire financial straits, he repeatedly petitioned Windebank for his release, which was probably granted before the outbreak of the civil war.<br>
<br>Despite this bad treatment, Taylor remained a staunch royalist, and at some point he left England for the continent, eventually returning to Vienna. Although he was lightly esteemed by Sir Edward Hyde, who regarded him as a &#145;fool&#146;, he was employed on the strength of his loyalty and good reputation with the emperor to muster support for Charles II's cause from various Catholic princes and the imperial diet during the interregnum (<span class="italic">Clarendon State Papers</span>, 3.97; <span class="italic">Diary of John Evelyn</span>, 4.257). He may have acted as an agent to the emperor for some weeks in the autumn of 1649. In September 1652 he was accredited as agent to the electors of Cologne and Mainz and the emperor in Vienna, where his brother Francis was court chaplain. This was the final mission of Taylor's career; he died, presumably in Vienna, in the autumn of 1655, probably in November.<br>
