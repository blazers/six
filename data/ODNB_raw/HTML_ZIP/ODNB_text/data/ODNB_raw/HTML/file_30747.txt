<span class="headword">Adams, Sir  John Bertram</span>  (1920&#150;1984), <span class="occ">physicist and scientific administrator</span>, was born on 24 May 1920 at 105 Canbury Park Road, Kingston, Surrey, the only son and younger child of John Albert Adams (<i>c</i>.1890&#150;<i>c</i>.1964) and his wife, Sarah Ethel Emily Searles (1890&#150;<i>c</i>.1970). He had a sister, Marjorie, who was eight years his senior. Their father had a good job working for Paquin's, a high-class London couturier, until the First World War but he never fully recovered from being badly gassed in action and after the war he was unemployed for long periods. Between 1931 and 1936 Adams attended Eltham College as a day boy, having won an entrance scholarship, but because of financial hardship in the family he left early and went to work at the Siemens laboratories in Woolwich. He continued his studies at the South-East London Technical Institute and obtained a higher national certificate in 1939.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Adams worked at the Telecommunications Research Establishment, first at Swanage and then at Malvern. His particular responsibility was the development of microwave radar systems, and it was through this that his outstanding engineering skills first came to be recognized.<br>
<br>On 23 January 1943 he married Renie, daughter of Joseph Warburton, engineer. She was at that time a flight officer in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force; they had one son and two daughters. In 1945 Adams moved to the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell where his exceptional ability again became quickly evident and in 1953 the director, Sir John Cockcroft, arranged for him to go to the newly formed high energy physics laboratory at the Conseil Europ&eacute;en de Recherches Nucl&eacute;aires (CERN), in Geneva. He went as a junior member of the team formed to build the world's largest elementary particle accelerator and before he left in 1961 he had served as director-general for a year. At Cockcroft's request Adams then left CERN to take charge of the development of Britain's controlled thermonuclear fusion programme. This again involved building a new laboratory, this time on a green-field site at Culham in Oxfordshire. Once again he created a splendidly effective research organization.<br>
<br>Adams was appointed controller at the Ministry of Technology in the first Labour government of Harold Wilson, although he remained director of Culham. In 1966 he became member for research of the UK Atomic Energy Authority. Neither of these two appointments suited his talents particularly well and in April 1969 he chose to return to CERN to take charge of a project whose future, to say the least, was very uncertain. The proposal was to build a new giant accelerator on a completely new site somewhere in Europe. The British government initially refused to join this project. In less than two years Adams, in conjunction with Bernard Gregory, the then director-general of CERN, transformed the plan so that the accelerator could be built on the Geneva site and at a fraction of the originally estimated cost. Britain then joined the revised project and it went ahead. The accelerator was completed in just over five years from approval and within the originally estimated cost. In 1976 Adams became executive director-general of a unified CERN laboratory serving in harness with Leon van Hove who acted as director-general for research. The period from 1976 to 1981 was one of remarkable accelerator development at CERN. Completion of the world's first proton&#150;antiproton collider in 1981 led ultimately to the award of the Nobel prize for physics to Rubbia and van der Meer in 1994 for the discovery of the intermediate vector boson. The large electron&#150;positron project (LEP) was also approved by the CERN council in June 1981. When Adams's term of office as director-general ended in December 1981 he remained at CERN but ceased to play any significant role in its affairs. His experience and knowledge were, however, much sought after outside the organization both in Europe and in the United States.<br>
<br>Adams's record both as an administrator and as an engineer is remarkable, especially considering the complexity of the work at Culham and Geneva. That this was done by one who did not have a university education is salutary. His achievements were recognized through the award of many honours and distinctions. They include honorary doctorates from the universities of Geneva (1960), Birmingham (1961), Surrey (1966), Strathclyde (1978), and Milan (1980); the R&ouml;ntgen prize of the University of Giessen (1960); the Duddell medal of the Physical Society (1961); the Royal Society's Leverhulme and royal medals (1972 and 1977); and the Faraday medal from the Institution of Electrical Engineers (1977). He was elected FRS in 1963 and a foreign member of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1982. He was appointed CMG in 1962 and knighted in 1981. He was a fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford (1966), the Manchester College of Technology, the Institution of Electrical Engineers, and the Institute of Physics.<br>
<br>Adams died from lung cancer on 3 March 1984 at the H&ocirc;pital Cantonal Universitaire, Geneva, near his home at Founex in the Swiss canton of Vaud, close to the mountains where he loved to walk and ski. He was cremated at Geneva on 8 March, and was survived by his wife.<br>
