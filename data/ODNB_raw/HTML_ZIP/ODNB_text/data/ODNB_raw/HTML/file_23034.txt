<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rainton, Sir  Nicholas</span>  (1569&#150;1646), <span class="occ">mayor of London</span>, was baptized on 10 June 1569 at Heighington in the parish of Washingborough, Lincolnshire, the third son of Robert Rainton and his wife, Margaret. On 16 November 1602 at St Christopher-le-Stocks, London, he married Rebecca (<i>d</i>. 1640), daughter of Thomas Moulson; contrary to the claims of some late twentieth-century histories of Enfield, the couple had no children. Rainton was free of the Haberdashers' Company and traded as a mercer in Lombard Street in satin and taffeta imported from Florence and velvet from Genoa. He came to enjoy considerable wealth and had a mansion house, Forty Hall, built for him at Enfield in 1629&#150;33. His portrait, painted by William Dobson in 1643, hangs over the fireplace. His 1636 enclosure of a considerable area of common land in Enfield encountered great local resentment, and a legal challenge by dispossessed commoners, and after his death there was anti-enclosure rioting.<br>
<br>During the 1620s and 1630s Rainton ascended the civic hierarchy: sheriff in 1621&#150;2, alderman of the wards of Tower (1621&#150;34) and Cornhill (1634&#150;46), and lord mayor in 1632&#150;3, with a knighthood conferred on 5 May 1633. He also served two terms, 1622&#150;3 and 1632&#150;3, as master of the Haberdashers' Company and was president of St Bartholomew's Hospital from 1634 until his death. Yet he was exceptional among his senior aldermanic colleagues for his undoubted puritan sympathies. In 1632 he was elected chairman by the London feoffees of impropriations, a puritan body (suppressed by Archbishop Laud in 1633) which aimed to install more godly clergy in the church by buying out lay owners of livings. He carried these religious sympathies with him to his final days, for among the clerical beneficiaries in his 1646 will were Thomas Foxley, former clerk to the feoffees and a principal victim of Laudian rule, and two other godly divines who had become leading city presbyterians. During his mayoralty Rainton also clashed with the bishop of London when the latter challenged the traditional practice of lord mayors having their sword of office carried before them into St Paul's Cathedral.<br>
<br>Along with most of his fellow aldermen Rainton refused the king's request for a loan in June 1639, more perhaps for practical than political objections. Despite close ties of family and friendship with two future parliamentarian aldermen, Richard Chambers and John Kendrick, his parliamentary sympathies appear to have declined in the early 1640s, or old age may have handicapped more active involvement. In May 1640 he was one of four aldermen committed to prison by the privy council for the defiant way they refused to draw up lists of ward inhabitants able to contribute to a royal loan. Yet in the disputed common council elections of December 1641 he clashed dramatically with some Cornhill ward electors who were determined to unseat two longstanding councillors and replace them with pro-parliamentary radicals. In the following month he was nominated to the new London militia committee but he made his excuses and was replaced by Alderman John Warner. During the trial of the pro-royalist lord mayor Richard Gurney in July, he gave evidence in Gurney's defence and visited him in the Tower. He was also one of three senior aldermen who pleaded ill health when asked by parliament to act as deputy mayor. However, after Gurney's conviction, he carried out parliament's instructions and called a common hall to elect a new lord mayor.<br>
<br>After the summer of 1642 Rainton faded from political view. He died on 19 August 1646 and was buried on 15 September in St Andrew's, Enfield. A spectacular funeral monument records in effigy the deaths of Rainton and his wife, and of his nephew, also Nicholas (<i>d</i>. 1641), and his wife, Rebecca. In addition the monument names the younger Nicholas's six children, five of whom survived their great-uncle. Sir Nicholas's will, made on 2 May 1646 and proved on the following 11 September, bequeathed property in Middlesex, London, and Lincolnshire, made several charitable donations, and left a total of over &pound;10,000 in individual monetary bequests to relatives and friends including three bequests of &pound;2000 each to his great-nieces, Rebecca, Ann, and Elizabeth. Sir Nicholas's heir and executor was his great-nephew, Nicholas Rainton.<br>
