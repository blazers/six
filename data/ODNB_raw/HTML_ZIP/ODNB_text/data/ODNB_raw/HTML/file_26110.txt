<span class="headword">Spence,  James</span>  (1812&#150;1882), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, son of James Spence, a merchant of Edinburgh, and his third wife (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Edwards), was born on 31 March 1812 in South Bridge Street, Edinburgh. He was educated in Galashiels, at a large boarding-school, and then at the high school, Edinburgh. He entered the University of Edinburgh in 1825, and began to study medicine with the intention of becoming an army surgeon. His medical studies were interrupted, and he was apprenticed to Messrs Scott and Orr, an eminent firm of chemists, of Princes Street, Edinburgh. He completed his medical education at the university and in the extramural school, and in 1832 he received the diploma of the College of Surgeons, Edinburgh, having previously spent some time in Paris studying anatomy and surgery.<br>
<br>As soon as he was qualified Spence made two voyages to Calcutta in 1833 as surgeon to <i>Protector</i>, a ship of the East India Company. He then returned to Edinburgh, where he had a severe attack of typhus fever. There he set up practice at 14 Rankeillor Street and began to teach anatomy as the university demonstrator under Professor Alexander Monro tertius; he held the position for seven years. He resigned his post in 1842 and joined P. D. Handyside and Henry Lonsdale in the extramural school of anatomy at 1 Surgeons' Square, to act as demonstrator in place of Allen Thomson, who had been appointed to the chair of physiology in the university. There Spence (who was nicknamed &#145;dismal Jemmy&#146;) took part in the lecture-room course of demonstrations on regional anatomy, as well as in the dissecting-room teaching. His teaching proved invaluable to the school, at that time the chief school of anatomy in Edinburgh. He was a remarkably dexterous dissector, and some of his beautiful preparations of the vascular system were preserved in the university.<br>
<br>Spence, who was in surgical practice while teaching anatomy, left the dissecting room in 1846 and began lecturing on surgery. On 13 October 1847 he married Margaret Sarah, the daughter of Thomas Fair of Buenos Aires. They had six sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1849, on becoming a fellow of the College of Surgeons, Edinburgh he lectured first at High Schools Yards, adjoining the Royal Infirmary, where Robert Liston and James Miller had lectured, and, on the death of Richard Mackenzie in 1854, at the school at Surgeons' Hall. In 1864, on the death of Professor James Miller, he was appointed professor of surgery in the university. He had been appointed assistant surgeon to the Royal Infirmary in 1850, full surgeon in 1854, clinical lecturer in 1856, and he continued, as professor of surgery, to act as surgeon at the infirmary until his death. He also served as surgeon to the Royal Public Dispensary and the Lock Hospital, and as consultant surgeon to the Royal Sick Children's Hospital and the Leith Hospital. He was appointed surgeon-in-ordinary to the queen in Scotland in 1865, fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1866, president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1867 and 1868, and member of the General Medical Council in 1881, as a representative for the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Spence has been described as one of the great operating surgeons who made Edinburgh famous throughout the world. Like Liston, Fergusson, and Syme, he had an intimate knowledge of anatomy. He specialized in tracheotomy, herniotomy, urinary diseases, and amputations, yet he was essentially a conservative surgeon, and, like his great contemporary Sir William Scovell Savory, he maintained that, in skilled hands, the simple methods of the older school were preferable to, and gave as good results as, the more complicated system adopted by the disciples of the antiseptic school of Lister. After the death of James Syme in 1870 Spence became the leading consulting and operating surgeon at Edinburgh, and he occupied that position until his death. He died at his home, 21 Ainslie Place, Edinburgh, on 6 June 1882, and he was buried in the Grange cemetery, Edinburgh, on 9 June.<br>
<br>The work upon which Spence's reputation as a writer chiefly rests is his <span class="italic">Lectures on Surgery</span> (2 vols., 1868&#150;9, 1871). He also contributed many papers on anatomical and surgical subjects to various Scottish, English, and Irish scientific journals.<br>
