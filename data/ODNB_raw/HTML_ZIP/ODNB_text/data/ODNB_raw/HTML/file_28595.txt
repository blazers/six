<span class="headword">Walpole,  Horatio <span class="st"> [Horace]</span></span>, first Baron Walpole of Wolterton  (1678&#150;1757), <span class="occ">diplomatist and politician</span>, was born at Houghton, Norfolk, on 8 December 1678, the fifth and second surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28600/', "Robert Walpole (1650&#150;1700)")</script> and his wife, Mary (1654/5&#150;1711), the daughter and heir of Sir Jeffrey Burwell, of Rougham, Suffolk. Horatio, usually known as Horace, was the younger brother and close political collaborator of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28601/', "Robert Walpole, first earl of Orford")</script>. Surviving letters between them when they were in their early twenties show a close and affectionate relationship, expressed in a frank obscenity characteristic of the time. Like his elder brother, Horace was educated at Eton College (1693&#150;8) and at King's College, Cambridge (1698&#150;1700), where he was a fellow from 1702 to 1714. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in October 1700 and in January 1710 he entered parliament in the whig interest, being first (and briefly) member for Lostwithiel. He sat in the Commons for the best part of forty-six years, until his elevation to the peerage on 4 June 1756. In 1713 he took over as MP for Castle Rising from his uncle, also Horace (1663&#150;1717); between 1715 and 1717 he held the seat of Bere Alston, Devon, and from 1718 to 1722 that of East Looe, Cornwall. He represented the borough of Great Yarmouth from 1722 to 1734 and the still more prestigious constituency of Norwich from 1734 to 1756.<h2>
<a name="Earlydiplomaticandpoliticalcareer"></a>Early diplomatic and political career</h2>Walpole owed his career almost entirely to Sir Robert, and never forgot his obligations to the man whom he still called, towards the end of his own life, &#145;my late, Dear, Good &amp; Great Brother&#146;  (Sir Robert Walpole MSS, Lewis Walpole Library). He left the centre of politics when his brother resigned. Early in his public life he became involved in both foreign service and domestic politics, a combination which was to characterize the whole of his career. In 1706&#150;7 he served as secretary to General James Stanhope, the envoy to Charles III, who ultimately failed to establish his claim to the Spanish throne. From 1707 he was secretary to Henry Boyle, Lord Carleton, who had been chancellor of the exchequer since 1701 and from 1708 to 1710 was secretary of state for the northern department. Walpole acted briefly as Carleton's under-secretary, a valuable preparation for a diplomatic career and one which he undertook again in 1714&#150;15 under Viscount Townshend. His knowledge of office routine and procedures was to be as valuable as his understanding of treaties and protocol. From May 1709 to March 1711 he was given his first taste of regular overseas diplomacy when he was posted as secretary to the embassy at The Hague, beginning a long association with the United Provinces. In 1715 and 1716 he acted as British minister at The Hague, in place of William, Lord Cadogan, and sought Dutch help both to protect shipping convoys in the Baltic against Swedish privateers and to furnish military aid against the Jacobite rising of 1715. Though his honest and burgher-like approach made him a success in the United Provinces, he was frustrated, not for the last time, by the decentralized and slow-moving Dutch decision-making process. In October 1716 he wrote to Stephen Poyntz: &#145;I must own I dread the sight of a Messenger from England lest he should bring with him a Black box containing the full Powers, Black indeed to me &amp; more terrible than Pandora's&#146;  (<span class="italic">Honest Diplomat</span>, 359).<br>
<br>Walpole served as secretary to the Treasury under Sir Robert Walpole from October 1715 to April 1717, and in 1717 was made surveyor and auditor-general of the revenue in America (for life), a valuable sinecure. The salary was &pound;250 per annum, but the post was made to yield several thousands and was the subject of a charge against him in 1742 when his brother fell, and the impeachment of both men was agitated in parliament. From 1721 to 1730 Walpole was once again secretary to the Treasury under his brother, giving up the post only to become cofferer of the royal household from 1730. He exchanged this lucrative place in 1741 for a more modest one, a life sinecure as teller of the exchequer, at &pound;3000 per annum. Walpole's avarice was a frequent subject of contemporary comment, linked to his mean hospitality and the slovenly dress on which he rather prided himself. Queen Caroline, if Lord Hervey is to be believed, found Walpole grating, &#145;his silly laugh hurting her ears, and his dirty sweaty body offending her nose&#146;  (Hervey, 3.732). His familiar style of writing offended her too. In 1734 Walpole apologized to his brother:<blockquote>I am extreamly sorry to find that the dress of my letters to the Q---n are not liked altho' the matter is approved, I solemnly protest to you, I doe not affect that free stile but I can no more write otherwise than I can tell how to dress my person better than I doe. (H. Walpole to R. Walpole, 9 Nov 1734, Osborn MS 48)</blockquote>His manner among his equals may be gauged from a story told by his nephew:<blockquote>One Day, when the Speaker [Arthur Onslow] had voted in the Committee, against the Army, Horace Walpole &hellip; reproved Him for it: The Speaker said why really Mr. Walpole in some Things a Man must <i>Feel Himself</i>. Feel himself! replied Mr. W. I'll tell you a Story: a Gentleman married a Girl with Forty Thous<sup>d</sup> Pds. The Morning after the Wedding night, in which He had given his Bride no Reason to think herself married, He said, well, my Dear, how do you <i>Feel Yourself?</i> Feel Myself! replied She: did my Father give you Forty Thousand Pound for me to <i>Feel myself?</i> (Walpole, &#145;Robert Walpole miscellany&#146;, 107)</blockquote>Yet in parliament Walpole was a strong and effective speaker, his judgement of political affairs and personalities was shrewd, and, despite his strong Norfolk accent and lack of the usual graces and deportment of the aristocratic diplomatic world, he was able to recommend himself to a wide range of ministers both abroad and at home. The disparaging accounts of both Hervey and Horace Walpole jun., in fact, are tinged both by personal malice and by a repugnance against his reputedly plain and slatternly wife, to whom Walpole was devoted. Hervey waspishly characterized her as having &#145;a form scarce human, as offensive to the nose and the ears as to the eye, and one to whom he was kind not from any principle of gratitude, but from the bestiality of his inclination&#146;  (Hervey, 1.284). Horace Walpole jun. coldly referred to &#145;Horace and his Dirty Wife &hellip; a French Staymaker's Daughter, whom he used to call Pug, &amp; who brought him a great Fortune, &amp; saved him a greater&#146;  (Walpole, &#145;Robert Walpole miscellany&#146;, 131, 132). He married, late in life (on 21 July 1720, at the age of forty-two) but happily, Mary Magdalen (1694/5&#150;1783), the daughter of Peter Lombard, of Burnham Thorpe, Norfolk, and they had four sons and three daughters. The eldest son, another Horatio (1723&#150;1809), succeeded his father as second Baron Walpole on 5 February 1757 and later inherited the estates of his cousin Horace, fourth earl of Orford, the youngest son of Sir Robert, taking the title of Baron Walpole of Walpole on 2 March 1797 and that of earl of Orford on 10 April 1806.<h2>
<a name="ParisembassyandthetreatyofSeville"></a>Paris embassy and the treaty of Seville</h2>The foundations of this dynastic success were laid with the return to power of Sir Robert Walpole and Townshend in 1720, when Horace was made a privy councillor (Ireland) and secretary to the lord lieutenant of Ireland (1720&#150;21). From May to July 1722 he was again at The Hague, negotiating military aid during the crisis of the Atterbury Jacobite plot. He had the confidence of his brother-in-law Townshend and of his brother as an adroit diplomat, and it was for &#145;his usual dexterity&#146; that they sent him rather irregularly to Paris in October 1723  (Coxe, 2.270). His task was to displace the ambassador there, Sir Luke Schaub, and undermine the policies of their rival Lord Carteret. At first, Carteret and Schaub believed that Walpole could be confined to the specific task of bringing Portugal into the Quadruple Alliance. He swiftly dispelled that illusion, and bluntly compelled Schaub to act with him, relying on the credit of &#145;the persons concerned (as to myselfe I mean to whom I belong)&#146; to gain him recognition as the principal (Stanhope to Carteret, 15 Nov 1723, BL, Add. MS 4204, fol. 328; H. Walpole to Newcastle, 12 Nov 1723, BL, Add. MS 32686, fols. 378&#150;82). Within a month of his arrival Walpole was congratulated by the duke of Newcastle on his grasp of French policy, though this was &#145;the foreign court, with which you have been less conversant than any other in Europe&#146;  (Newcastle to H. Walpole, 6 Nov 1723, BL, Add. MS 32686, fol. 403). He pursued the Townshend&#150;Walpole policy until Schaub was recalled, after Carteret's fall, in May 1724. Walpole succeeded him as ambassador-extraordinary until August 1727, then as ambassador-extraordinary and plenipotentiary until September 1730. From the beginning of his embassy his official correspondence shows that he was vigilant in employing informants and using every means to detect and forestall Jacobite manoeuvres, bringing frequent commendations from George II. Vital to his success in his Paris mission was the fact that he cultivated excellent personal relations with Andr&eacute; Hercule de Fleury, bishop of Fr&eacute;jus, who in June 1726 became France's leading minister. Walpole called upon Fleury at Issy in December 1725, when it was generally believed that the bishop was in disgrace at court, a mark of respect and confidence which Fleury never forgot.<br>
<br>Walpole's strength as a diplomat lay in his robust grasp of what was possible for ministers &#145;in a popular government as ours is&#146;  (H. Walpole to Newcastle, 24 July 1728, BL, Add. MS 32757, fol. 147). He never lost sight of domestic political realities amid the complexities of European rivalries and plans. His combative loyalty and closeness to his brother made him a senior member of Sir Robert's ministry, regularly informed and consulted about policy issues even when he was abroad. From Paris or The Hague, Walpole laid before the inner circle of ministers his drafts and proposals and was supplied by Newcastle with copies of correspondence in and out of the secretary of state's office. He, Newcastle, Lord Hardwicke, and later Henry Pelham made up the core of the ministry at least in its last ten years, a group among whom discussion was open and confidence was extensive, if not always quite complete. Walpole was therefore more than simply an ambassador, and he took it upon himself in his regular correspondence to inform, question, and sometimes harangue other leading envoys. When other diplomats worked alongside him, as at the congress of Soissons, when he was joined with Stephen Poyntz and William Stanhope, they were expected to take a subordinate place. Walpole's most substantial achievement in these years was to negotiate, with Poyntz, the treaty of mutual defence between Britain, France, and Spain, signed at Seville on 9 November 1729. The treaty of Seville was attacked in opposition writings as a slavish subservience to the Catholic Bourbon powers; it was popularly supposed to contain secret clauses which forced the ministry to tolerate Spanish depredations upon British shipping. Seville was a name which recurred regularly in ballads and newspapers, almost always as a reproach to the Walpole brothers. Horace himself always referred to the treaty with satisfaction, though almost as soon as it was published Sir Robert felt impelled anonymously to publish a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Observations upon the Treaty</span>, to explain and justify its clauses.<h2>
<a name="Parliamentarian"></a>Parliamentarian</h2>When Townshend resigned in May 1730 Walpole declined the offer to succeed him as secretary of state and accepted the appointment of cofferer of the household, which brought him into regular contact with the king. He returned from Paris at the end of July to take up his post, and in November 1730 became an English privy councillor. From this time he acted as Sir Robert's deputy in party and Commons affairs, organizing support and sometimes sponsoring legislation, most notably the 1733 <span class="roman">Molasses Act</span>. In October 1733 he went on a special mission to The Hague to escort the prince of Orange to England for his marriage to the princess royal, and in April 1734 he returned there as ambassador, a post which he held (with a number of absences, in parliament or in Hanover) until the outbreak of war with Spain, returning to Britain permanently on 19 November 1739. His most sustained period of political activity in Westminster was over by 1734, and had not been an unmixed success. Hervey, with a characteristic combination of shrewdness and malice, dismissed him at this period as:<blockquote>a very good treaty dictionary, to which his brother often referred for facts &hellip; He loved business, had great application, and was indefatigable, but from having a most unclear head, no genius, no method, and a most inconclusive manner of reasoning, he was absolutely useless to his brother in every [other] capacity. (Hervey, 1.285)</blockquote>He may have been verbose in parliamentary speaking, yet his surviving papers show Walpole to have been an indefatigable drafter of projects, memorials, and memoranda characterized by strong logic and remorseless chronological completeness. He propounded this as the only sure method for evaluating political developments and for avoiding misrepresentation and partisan argument. &#145;I speak this from no small experience &hellip; by the Method abovementioned, which I have used for some years past, I have been able to form a judgement which has seldom err'd in matters of the greatest importance&#146;  (&#145;Note of facts relating to the expeditions for America&#146;, BL, Wolterton (Walpole) MSS). His were in fact valuable contributions to decision making behind the scenes, and he was often called upon to lay out papers of this kind. The same talent was exercised publicly in several closely reasoned pamphlets defending the ministry. Two of them, <span class="italic">The Grand Question, whether War, or No War, with Spain</span> and <span class="italic">The Convention Vindicated from the Misrepresentations of the Enemies of our Peace</span>, were distributed to the extent of 11,000 copies each in 1739.<br>
<br>Walpole's oratory was not of the polished or witty kind which Hervey preferred, but his strengths could be considerable, as in the important debate of March 1739 on the convention with Spain, when he led for the government in a robust two-hour speech. As a colleague Walpole was stubborn once he had taken an emotional stand and was prone to fancy his advice ignored. Though not slow to criticize others, he was himself sensitive to slights. He was inclined, too, to overreach himself, a trait which eventually seems to have lost him favour at court. In March 1737 he initially supported a bill brought in by Sir John Barnard to reduce the interest of the national debt from 4 to 3 per cent. This seemingly uncontentious step would harm the fortunes of the moneyed men behind the government, as Barnard meant it to. Walpole and the king and queen therefore worked hard to defeat it. Walpole, according to Hervey, did not trouble to conceal that he was acting against his conscience in helping to sink Barnard's bill, and wearied the queen with his complaints:<blockquote>She told him, because he had some practice in treaties and was employed in foreign affairs, that he began to think he understood everything better than anybody else; and that it was really quite new his setting himself up to understand the revenue, money-matters, and the House of Commons better than his brother. &#145;What are you&#146;, said the Queen, &#145;without your brother? Or what are you all but a rope of sand that would crumble away in little grains one after another, if it was not for him?&#146; (Hervey, 3.732)</blockquote>From 1738 onwards, and with increasing persistence from 1740, Walpole pressed for an alliance with Prussia, though he knew it ran counter to the king's &#145;little, low, partial, electoral notions&#146;  (Coxe, 3.535&#150;7). This stand hastened the cooling of George II's affection for him, as he noted in his private manuscript &#145;Apology for the life of Mr. Walpole&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 9132). When Sir Robert resigned in February 1742, both brothers were threatened with impeachment, and Horace's notorious covetousness seems to have rankled as much in opponents' minds as Sir Robert's greater power but much freer spending. Walpole went home to Wolterton (his house designed by Thomas Ripley in the mid-1720s) and burnt large quantities of his personal papers to prevent their seizure by the secret committee set up to investigate Sir Robert. In 1743 he had a warm argument in the house, when the opposition member William Richard Chetwynd, a friend of Bolingbroke, told him that both the brothers deserved to be hanged. The two men stepped outside into Pipe's Ground and fought a duel, in which Chetwynd was wounded and Walpole was saved only by his opponent's sword striking a button. Arrested by Speaker Onslow to put an end to the affair, Walpole was pleased with his exploit: &#145;he thought it was a great and hard thing to fight a duel, because young fellows used to make such ado about it, but he says there is nothing at all in it now, he finds&#146;  (Francis, Lord Hastings, to earl of Huntington, 15 March 1743, <span class="italic">Hastings MSS</span>, 3.38).<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>Walpole remained active in parliament, and defended the decision by his brother to take into government pay 16,000 Hanoverian troops, a measure extremely unpopular with the public. In early 1743 Lord Chesterfield's pamphlet <span class="italic">The Case of the Hanover Forces</span> drew loud support, and in April, Walpole produced a refutation of it, <span class="italic">The Interest of Great Britain Steadily Pursued</span>, which quickly went through three editions. Soon, however, he ceased to be part of the inner circle of leading politicians, though he remained an informed political commentator. In February 1746, on the eve of the notorious cabinet walkout which compelled George II to accept Pitt as a minister, Walpole urged the king in a letter to give way gracefully. In December 1747 he lobbied the duke of Cumberland, in person and by letter, to persuade the king to make an alliance with Prussia as the only means to a lasting peace.<br>
<br>Walpole continued to compile his analyses of international affairs, including &#145;A rhapsody of foreign politics&#146;, criticizing the 1748 treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. He actually presented to the king his &#145;Observations on the system of affairs in 1751&#146;, which gave tactlessly free rein to his own anti-Hanoverian views. In February 1752 he caused a roar of laughter in the Commons when he spoke against a subsidy to the elector of Saxony yet ended with a call to the &#145;old corps&#146; of whigs to join him in voting for it  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 20.299&#150;300) [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93705', "Old corps")</script>]. In 1755, when Newcastle was first minister, Walpole was once again consulted, and characteristically read to the cabinet a paper urging against the king's going abroad. Such a span of influence justifies Coxe's summary:<blockquote>it would be difficult to point out another character, who, for so long a period, was more trusted with the secrets of government, more acquainted with the motives and springs of action, and possessed more influence in the direction of foreign and domestic affairs. (Coxe, xii)</blockquote>His main concern at the end of his life, though, lay in securing the interests of his family. His eldest son, Horatio, had been married in May 1748 to Lady Rachel Cavendish, the third daughter of the duke of Devonshire, and with his friend Newcastle in power Walpole sought a hereditary peerage for his son's benefit. Meanwhile he persuaded Sir Robert's 26-year-old grandson, Lord Cholmondeley, to agree to a mutual entail of the Houghton and Wolterton estates in which the benefit lay on the Wolterton side. Though in the event not harmful to the family, the agreement, which only accidentally came to the attention of Sir Robert's surviving children, was bitterly opposed by Horace Walpole jun. and created serious bad feeling. On 1 June 1756 Walpole was created Baron Walpole of Wolterton. Soon afterwards he suffered a return of the stone, a complaint common in the family, and he died at Wolterton Hall on 5 February 1757.<br>
