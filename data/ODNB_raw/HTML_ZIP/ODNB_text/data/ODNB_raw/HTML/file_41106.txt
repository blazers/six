<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Olliffe]</span>,  Florence Eveleen Eleanore</span>, Lady Bell  (1851&#150;1930), <span class="occ">author, social investigator, and playwright</span>, was born on 9 September 1851 at 2 rue St Florentin, Paris, the youngest of the four children of Sir Joseph Olliffe (1808&#150;1869), physician to the British embassy in Paris, and his wife, Laura, daughter of Sir William Cubitt MP, a member of the wealthy family of English builders. When she was ten her grandfather became lord mayor of London. She received a private education in Paris. Here she met Charles Dickens, developed a love for the theatre, and enjoyed a cosmopolitan, cultured lifestyle. In 1870, not long after her father's death, the Franco-Prussian War forced the family to flee to England. They settled at 95 Sloane Street, and this Knightsbridge home remained her London base for the rest of her life. Her ambition was to study music at the Royal College but this was considered inappropriate: she retained an appreciation of classical music throughout her life.<br>
<br>On 10 August 1876 Florence Olliffe married (Thomas) Hugh Bell (1844&#150;1931). The son of the ironmaster <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30690/', "Sir (Isaac) Lowthian Bell, first baronet")</script>, he became the director of Bell Brothers. In addition to running the ironworks at Port Clarence on the north side of the Tees, opposite Middlesbrough, his business interests encompassed collieries and railways. In 1902 Bell Brothers merged with Dorman Long, major manufacturers of steel girders. He held a number of civic offices, including that of mayor, and was lord lieutenant of the North Riding for twenty-five years. He succeeded to his father's baronetcy in December 1904. When Florence Olliffe first met Hugh Bell (through his sisters), he was widowed. His first wife, Maria (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Shield), had died in 1871, leaving him with two children, Gertrude and Maurice. Thus his second wife became stepmother to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30686/', "Gertrude Bell (1868&#150;1926)")</script>, the intrepid explorer and scholar of the Middle East. The Bells had three children of their own: Hugh Lowthian (Hugo), (Florence) Elsa, and Mary Katharine (Molly) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53939/', "Trevelyan, Mary Katharine")</script>], who married Sir Charles Trevelyan MP. The Bells lived at Red Barns, a windswept house near Redcar designed by Philip Webb. In 1905 they moved to Rounton Grange, near Northallerton. This became a centre for entertaining family, friends, fellow Liberals, and business and civic colleagues. Here Florence Bell also welcomed literary friends such as the writer Mrs Humphry Ward.<br>
<br>Lady Bell became a prolific writer, publishing over forty works. Some of her books for children, for example <span class="italic">Pauline's First Reading Book</span> (1912) and <span class="italic">Nora's Little Songbook</span>, were initially written for her grandchildren. Her French upbringing prompted <span class="italic">French without Tears</span> (3 pts, 1895&#150;7), while in her best-known novel, a triple-decker, <span class="italic">The Story of Ursula</span> (1895), the heroine is caught between the competing cultures of England and France. She also wrote many essays, a selection of which was published in 1929, entitled <span class="italic">Landmarks</span>. She produced several political allegories such as <span class="italic">Down with the Tariff!</span> (1908) and a number of plays for children and adults. Her most sombre work was a secret. Collaborating with the American-born actress and writer Elizabeth Robins (1862&#150;1952), she co-wrote the play <span class="italic">Alan's Wife</span> (1893), based on a story by the Swedish writer Elin Ameen. The Bell&#150;Robins play, performed on the London stage and published without the playwrights' identities being revealed, was set, like a number of Lady Bell's plays, in northern England. It dealt with working-class infanticide, provoking strong reactions about the suitability of the subject matter. Elizabeth Robins, famed for her Ibsen roles, took the lead as she had done in Lady Bell's comedietta <span class="italic">A Joint Household</span> (1892) and her play <span class="italic">Karin</span> (1892), translated from a Swedish play.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Robins became Florence Bell's closest friend. Although from markedly different backgrounds and not always sharing the same outlook (Lady Bell disapproved of her friend's militant suffragism) they shared a passion for the theatre and commitment to writing. When apart they corresponded weekly and provided constructive criticism of each other's literary efforts from the 1890s onwards. They dedicated books to each other and Lady Bell wrote an appreciation of &#145;Lisa&#146; for <span class="italic">Time and Tide</span> in 1920. Henry James's short story <span class="italic">Nona Vincent</span> (1891) centres on two characters, apparently based on Lady Bell and Elizabeth Robins, while more than half of the latter's book of correspondence with James, <span class="italic">Theatre and Friendship</span> (1932), is actually about Lady Bell. Florence Bell was also a key figure in promoting the stage career of Dame Sybil Thorndike.<br>
<br>Yet Lady Bell is probably best remembered for <span class="italic">At the Works</span> (1907), a detailed investigation of Middlesbrough where her husband's workforce lived. Dedicated to Charles Booth, it nevertheless rejects an approach dominated by statistics, and focuses not just on the workplace but also on the homes of more than one thousand families, emphasizing especially the role of women in household management and containing much unique information on working-class reading habits (expanded in its second edition, 1911). The evidence for this classic study was gathered by Lady Bell, Gertrude Bell, and a few others over a period of nearly thirty years.<br>
<br>Concerned about the lack of recreational facilities locally, Lady Bell started an imaginative pioneering venture in Middlesbrough known as the Winter Gardens, providing an attractive venue for inexpensive recreation. Herbert Samuel MP, under-secretary of state for home affairs, described it as &#145;one of the most hopeful social experiments now being tried in England&#146;. Her work in the locality extended to presidency of the British Red Cross Society. For acting as commandant of a hospital during the First World War she was made DBE in 1918. Yet close friends understood that this public figure and elegant hostess, almost invariably clad in loose gowns of grey, lavender, or silver, was actually a shy and private person. She could, however, appear daunting, as she was a stickler for etiquette. When her son Hugo's fianc&eacute;e first met Lady Bell, she found her very much the <i>grande dame</i>, expecting her to talk French so that she could judge her accent.<br>
<br>Hugo became a clergyman whose work took him to South Africa. In 1926 on his return voyage he died of typhoid fever. He was forty-eight. His mother wrote a poignant memoir, privately published. Six months later, Gertrude died in Iraq. Meanwhile the Bell financial fortune was beginning to crumble slightly. Rounton Grange was closed, the family settling at the Manor House of Mount Grace Priory at Rounton. Still fascinated by drama, in 1927 Lady Bell organized an ambitious pageant in the grounds of the priory. It lasted for more than three days, had a cast of 118, and was attended by the queen and Princess Mary. It provided a temporary, albeit lavish and costly, diversion from the tragedies of 1926. She also published a selection of Gertrude's letters (1927). Lady Bell lived for only three more years, dying aged seventy-nine at 5 Lennox Gardens, Knightsbridge, London, on 16 May 1930. She was buried in Yorkshire at Rounton.<br>
