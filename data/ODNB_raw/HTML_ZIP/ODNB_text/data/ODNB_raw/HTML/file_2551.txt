<span class="headword">Bladen,  Martin</span>  (1680&#150;1746), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born possibly at Abbey Hatch, Essex, the third son of Nathaniel Bladen (<i>b</i>. 1642/3) of Hemsworth, Yorkshire, and his wife, Isabella, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9095/', "Sir William Fairfax")</script> of Steeton, Yorkshire. He was thus a relation of Thomas, third Baron Fairfax, the commander-in-chief of the Cromwellian army, and of Thomas, sixth Baron Fairfax, who inherited extensive estates in Virginia and became a great patron of the Washington family. Bladen's sister Elizabeth was to be the mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12651/', "Edward Hawke, first Baron Hawke")</script>; Bladen became his guardian and was responsible for his early advancement in the navy.<br>
<br>Bladen was educated at a small private school and then at Westminster School (1695&#150;7); he matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1697 and in the same year was admitted at the Inner Temple, but did not pursue a career in law. He joined the army, served in the Low Countries and Spain, and became an aide-de-camp to Henri de Massue de Ruvigny, first earl of Galway. In 1709 he was appointed colonel of a regiment of foot raised in Portugal, but he sold the colonelcy in 1710 and retired from the army. As one of Marlborough's colonels he sought to enter politics, but was twice defeated for the seat of Saltash, Cornwall, in 1713 and 1715. Having been appointed to the sinecure of comptroller of the Royal Mint in 1714, he finally won election to parliament at Stockbridge, Hampshire, in 1715. In 1715 he was also elected to the Irish House of Commons, as member for Bandon, a seat he held until 1727. In 1734 he relinquished the representation of Stockbridge and was elected for Maldon, Essex. A political associate of Thomas Pelham-Holles, duke of Newcastle, and Sir Robert Walpole, in 1741 he was rewarded for his services with the safe Admiralty seat of Portsmouth, a constituency he represented until his death, whereupon he was succeeded by his nephew, who was then Sir Edward Hawke.<br>
<br>Bladen's first wife was Mary, the daughter of Colonel Gibbs; with her he had at least two daughters and a son, George Monk Bladen, who seems to have died young. On 3 April 1728 he married Frances (<i>d</i>. 1747), the niece and heir of Colonel Joseph Jory and the widow of John Foche, Fouch, or Ffocke, of Aldborough Hatch, Essex. This second marriage brought him great wealth, including vast plantation concerns in the West Indies. He did not, however, make a new will on his second marriage; he named his daughter Isabella and three infant children of &#145;my very good friend Jane Porter of London Gentlewoman&#146; as his residuary legatees. The only one of the Porter children to survive Bladen was described as &#145;John Porter otherwise Bladen&#146;, suggesting a closer relationship than friendship.<br>
<br>Appointed through Newcastle's influence to the Board of Trade in 1717, Bladen was sent to Paris in 1719 to represent Britain at a conference to determine the boundaries between British and French North America following the treaty of Utrecht (1713). In 1732 he again acted as the main British representative at a conference at Antwerp to adjust the tariffs between Britain, the emperor of Germany, and the states general. Something of a literary figure, he published a dull tragi-comedy, <span class="italic">Solon, or, Philosophy No Defence Against Love: with the Masque of Orpheus and Euridice</span> (1705), and in 1714 an English translation, <span class="italic">Caesar's Commentaries of his Wars in Gaul</span>, which was dedicated to the duke of Marlborough. Bladen's historical importance, however, is on account of his record twenty-nine years of service at the Board of Trade.<br>
<br>The political importance and influence of the Board of Trade fluctuated in the eighteenth century, but Bladen's attention to business, and hence his grasp of departmental detail and past official precedent, remained constant. In his first three years in office he attended 463 out of the 572 recorded meetings. During the period 1732&#150;42, when the board declined into a refuge for political placemen, Bladen still managed to attend 978 meetings. His application to colonial affairs was widely respected, and a contemporary pun termed him &#145;Trade&#146; and his less efficient colleagues as merely &#145;Board&#146;. Bladen became so influential he often controlled the patronage of various colonial offices, especially in North Carolina. He often broke governors of dubious loyalty and ability, and sometimes made governors, although his motives in doing so have been questioned: of the seven governors appointed through his influence, one was his son-in-law, John Tinker, and another, Thomas Bladen of Maryland, was his nephew. His own economic interests in the West Indies may also have been responsible for his hostility towards the New England colonies, especially Massachusetts, which were notorious for their lax attitude towards the laws of trade.<br>
<br>The hand of Bladen is clearly evident throughout the Colonial Office papers covering his tenure. His first important contribution was his role in the 135-page report to the king, on 8 September 1721, on the condition and government of the colonies. The product of fourteen separate meetings of the board, it was a crucial restatement of past British official attitudes which, on account of their importance, came to influence later deliberations of the board regarding official policy. Briefly, the report suggested that British authority and security needed to be strengthened in North America. This could best be achieved, Bladen suggested, by restricting extensive land grants, appointing reliable crown officials, weakening the rising power of the colonial assemblies, raising a revenue by a more efficient collection of royal quitrents, sending regular troops to the colonies, recalling the charters of the proprietary colonies, securing the frontiers by the creation of a coherent system of native alliances to prevent French encroachment, and the creation of a colonial union under the direct supervision of a captain-general sent out from Britain.<br>
<br>Bladen remained a voice for such policies throughout his career. In an attempt to lessen the drift to independence that he perceived to be developing in the New England colonies, especially Massachusetts, and to tie them more closely to the British mercantile system, he undertook in the Commons the defence of the abortive sugar bills of 1731&#150;2, strongly supported the passage of the <span class="roman">Hat Act</span> of 1732, and was largely responsible for steering through the house the <span class="roman">Molasses Act</span> of 1733. A summary of his colonial policy viewpoints may be found in his personal reports, to Lord Townshend, &#145;For the settling of Carolina&#146;, 1729  (TNA: PRO, CO5/4, fols. 159&#150;62); to Newcastle, &#145;Reasons for the immediate peopling of Nova Scotia&#146;, 1735  (<span class="italic">CSP col.</span>, 41, nos. 592, 454&#150;8); and to Sir Robert Walpole, &#145;Reasons for appointing a captain-general for the continent of North America&#146;, 1739  (Cholmondeley MSS, CUL).<br>
<br>Throughout his career at the board Bladen rarely formulated new policy; his importance lay in keeping alive the older reform policies of the Williamite board. This was crucial in the development of later British colonial policy, and consequently Bladen was possibly the most influential and best-informed official regarding the American colonies between the retirement of William Blathwayt in 1710 and the appointment in 1748 of George, second earl of Halifax, as president of the board. Bladen died on 1 February 1746, and was buried in the chancel of St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney, Middlesex. Administration of his will was granted to one of his creditors, the Revd John Emmerson.<br>
