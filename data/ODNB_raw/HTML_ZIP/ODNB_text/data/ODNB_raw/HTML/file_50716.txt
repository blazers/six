<div class="para">
<span class="headword">R&eacute;e,  Harry Alfred</span>  (1914&#150;1991), <span class="occ">resistance fighter and educationist</span>, was born on 15 October 1914 at 15 Mauldeth Road, Withington, Manchester, the youngest of eight children of Alfred R&eacute;e, chemical manufacturer, and his wife, Lavinia Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dimmick, an American and a member of the Dupont family. His father's family was Jewish and settled in Denmark and Germany; Alfred spent much of his youth in Germany before Harry's grandfather moved to England in the 1870s. Harry was educated at Shrewsbury School and St John's College, Cambridge, where he read modern languages and economics. He spoke fluent French, though with a marked accent which later obliged his fellow resistance fighters in the Second World War to pass him off as a visiting cousin from Alsace; in the opinion of the historian Richard Cobb, he had the best mastery of spoken French by an Englishman. At university he met Henry Morris, Cambridgeshire's visionary chief education officer, who converted him to community education. He began his career as a teacher in 1937 at Penge grammar school, London&#151;a lively, idealistic, civilized, and not untypical young grammar-school master of that time. A former pupil remembered him as &#145;full of high spirits, sharp iconoclastic informality, and kindliness&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 8 June 1991). In July 1940 he married Hetty Vine (<i>d</i>. 1961).<br>
<br>R&eacute;e began the Second World War as a conscientious objector. But Hitler's invasion of the Low Countries and of Norway changed his mind and he joined the army, initially as a gunner. He joined the independent French (F) section of the special operations executive (SOE) in 1942. Early in the following year he was dropped out of a Lysander to join the Maquis. From his landing his exploits read as if lifted from <span class="italic">The Magnet</span> or Bulldog Drummond: a near-capture on landing; escape from Burgundy just before the Gestapo arrested the leaders of the &#145;Acrobat&#146; circuit; numerous acts of sabotage in the foothills of the Jura Mountains; a bold approach to one of the Peugeot brothers offering internal sabotage to the tank factory near Montb&eacute;liard in exchange for a promise by the RAF not to bomb it; and a hand-to-hand struggle with a German security sergeant from which he escaped to Switzerland in November 1943, badly wounded, to send a telegram to his wife saying &#145;Skiing here marvellous&#146;. He never lost his admiration for the French peasants and workers who protected him, fought by his side, and saved his life. For his exploits he was awarded the DSO and the Croix de Guerre, and was made an OBE. The birth of his daughter was announced to him in code by the BBC while he was in France; two sons followed.<br>
<br>After the war R&eacute;e returned to schoolteaching, at Bradford grammar school. While there he made <span class="italic">School for Danger</span> for the RAF Film Unit (later retitled <span class="italic">Now it can be Told</span> and currently shown on a loop at the Imperial War Museum, London), as well as broadcasts for the BBC's <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span>. In 1951 he was appointed as the relatively young headmaster of Watford grammar school. For a while he remained an enthusiast for the grammar school, seeing it as the successor to the public school and writing <span class="italic">The Essential Grammar School</span> (1956) as a lively exposition of his ideas and beliefs.<br>
<br>In 1961 R&eacute;e was approached to become professor of education at the University of York, then being planned under the leadership of Eric James, the founding vice-chancellor. R&eacute;e took up the position in 1963 and, despite some misgivings about entering what he saw as the privileged university sector, he relished his new teaching role and became an influential and much respected lecturer, as well as provost of Derwent College. While at York he underwent another ideological transformation, from champion of the grammar school to fervent supporter of the comprehensive school. From this new vision of learning he never afterwards wavered. As an assiduous member of the York education committee he advocated a comprehensive solution for the city. His first wife having died in late 1961, R&eacute;e married on 23 March 1966 Petronella Ann (Peta) Garrett (<i>b</i>. 1929/30), daughter of Brigadier-General Osmond Luxmoore Jones, army officer; the couple separated in the early 1970s.<br>
<br>As a believer in planned demotion before retirement, R&eacute;e resigned his chair at York in 1974 and determinedly descended the upward escalator to teach modern languages at Woodberry Down, a London comprehensive. The move was no momentary gesture but a characteristic and sustained defiance of conventional hierarchy which lasted until his retirement in 1979. He finally settled in the Yorkshire dales at Colt Park, in Ribblehead, in a large stone-built farmhouse at a remote spot among the limestone scenery of the upper Ribble valley, whence he tramped the vast surrounding wilderness and where he was visited by his many friends, to be entertained to delicious French food and enlivening conversation. His book, <span class="italic">The Three Peaks of Yorkshire</span> (1983), remains popular with walkers in the area. All this was interspersed with frequent forays to London, Coventry, France, and beyond. In retirement he was closely involved with the Community Education Development Centre, editing its journal, <span class="italic">Network</span>. He had already published a biography of Henry Morris, <span class="italic">Educator Extraordinary</span>, in 1973, and a selection of Morris's writings and speeches, <span class="italic">The Henry Morris Collection</span> (1984).<br>
<br>R&eacute;e was forever arriving somewhere and always eager to listen to the latest news. Somewhere on his travels he left behind the conventional religion of his childhood. But he retained and developed a deep spirituality, disguised by frequent laughter and punctuated by an irreverence towards the pomposities of this world. He was a hugely refreshing inspiration for students of all ages and one of the best loved men of his generation. He died at his home, Colt Park, Ribblehead, of heart failure, on 17 May 1991, and was survived by the three children of his first marriage.<br>
