<span class="headword">Towers,  Joseph</span>  (1737&#150;1799), <span class="occ">biographer and Presbyterian minister</span>, was born on 31 March 1737 in Southwark, where his father was a secondhand bookseller. At the age of twelve he was employed as an errand-boy to a stationer at the Royal Exchange and in 1754 was apprenticed to Robert Goadby, a printer of Sherborne, Dorset. Here he taught himself Latin and Greek and, under Goadby's influence, became an Arian.<br>
<br>In 1764 Towers returned to London, where he worked for a short time as a journeyman printer. On 19 August 1767 he married Margaret Lomas, a relative of Caleb Fleming, at St Luke Old Street, Finsbury. With the money acquired from his wife's marriage settlement he bought a bookshop in Fore Street, Cripplegate, in London. He continued in this business for nine years, but with no great success. During this time he began to acquire a reputation as a biographer and writer of political pamphlets. He was appointed editor of the <span class="italic">British Biography</span>, the first seven volumes of which were compiled by him (1766&#150;72). The biography was based on information in <span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span>, but also contained much original work, the fruit of his research in the British Museum.<br>
<br>In 1774 Towers gave up his business and was ordained as a dissenting minister; he became pastor of the Presbyterian congregation in Southwood Lane, Highgate, but the opening of a rival meeting-house in the same street (1778) saw his congregation dwindle away. He left Highgate to become, in 1778, morning preacher at Stoke Newington Green, where Richard Price preached in the afternoons. While at Newington Green he assisted Andrew Kippis in the production of a new edition of <span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span> (1778&#150;93), to which he contributed between fifty and sixty articles which were signed &#145;T&#146;. On 19 November 1779 he was awarded the degree of LLD from Edinburgh University and from 1790 to 1799 was a trustee of Dr Williams's foundation.<br>
<br>Towers's contributions to the biographies mentioned above were but a small part of his literary output. He was a prolific writer of pamphlets and treatises, which reflected his passionate belief in liberty, both religious and political. Many of these were republished in 1796 in a three-volume collection entitled <span class="italic">Tracts on Political and other Subjects</span>. His most respected single work was <span class="italic">The Life and Work of Frederick the Great</span> (2 vols., 1788), which ran to a second edition in 1795. Towers's health began to decline from the beginning of 1795 and he began to suffer in particular from jaundice. He died on either 18 or 20 May 1799 at his home in St John's Square, Clerkenwell.<br>
<br>His only son, <a name="cosubject_27589"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Lomas Towers</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1770, <em>d.</em> 1831), <span class="occ">Unitarian preacher</span>, was baptized on 18 April 1770 at Bartholomew Close and Pinner's Hall Independent Chapel, and was educated at St Paul's School, London, and New College, Hackney, which he entered in September 1786. He preached for a short time as a Unitarian minister, but without a settled congregation. In 1792 he succeeded Roger Flexman as librarian of Dr Williams's Library. After resigning this post in 1804 he led an eccentric life, busy with literary schemes and the collection of books and prints. He became insane in 1830, and died on 4 October 1831 at the White House, Bethnal Green. He was buried in a vault at Elim Chapel, Fetter Lane. Although allegedly the author of several publications, only two can be credited to him with certainty. These are <span class="italic">Illustrations of Prophecy</span> (2 vols., 1796) and <span class="italic">The Expediency of Cash Payments by the Bank of England</span> (1811).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_27587"></a><span class="headword">John Towers</span>  (<em>c.</em>1747&#150;1804), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, younger brother of Joseph Towers, was born in Southwark. He went to sea as a lad, but after two voyages was apprenticed to a packer of Turnwheel Lane, Cannon Street, London. He taught himself Greek and Hebrew, and began to preach as an Independent. A secession from Jewin Street Independent congregation chose him as pastor and leased the Presbyterian meeting-house in Bartholomew Close, where he was ordained in 1769. For some years he also conducted a day school. In 1784 the congregation moved to a new meeting-house in the Barbican, where his ministry proved remarkably successful. He was twice married: first to Miss Reynolds of Bridewell precinct on 10 October 1769 and for a second time in September 1782. He published <span class="italic">Polygamy Unscriptural</span> (1780), an answer to Martin Madan's <span class="italic">Thelephera</span>, and several sermons. He died on 9 July 1804 and was buried on 17 July in Bunhill Fields.<br>
