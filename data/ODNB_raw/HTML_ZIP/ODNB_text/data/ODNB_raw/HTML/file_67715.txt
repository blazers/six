<span class="headword">Drake,  Nicholas Rodney <span class="st"> [Nick]</span></span>  (1948&#150;1974), <span class="occ">singer and songwriter</span>, was born on 19 June 1948 in Rangoon, Burma, the only son of Rodney Drake (1908&#150;1988), an engineer, and his wife, Molly, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lloyd (1915&#150;1993). An elder sister, Gabrielle (<i>b</i>. 1944), became well known as an actress. The Drake family returned to Britain from Burma when Nick was four, and at eight he was sent to Eagle House School, a preparatory school at Sandhurst, Berkshire. After following his father and grandfather to Marlborough College (1962&#150;6)&#151;where he learned to play the piano, clarinet, saxophone, and, latterly, the guitar&#151;he went up to Cambridge to read English at Fitzwilliam College (1967&#150;9). He left before taking his degree to pursue a career in the music business. As a musician he was influenced by the Scottish singer&#150;songwriter Bert Jansch and the Americans Bob Dylan and Jackson C. Frank, and it is songs by these artists that feature on the earliest known recording of him singing, taped on a schoolfriend's machine in Aix-en-Provence in the south of France during the spring of 1967. It was also during this four-month period he spent studying French in Aix that Nick Drake first began to write his own songs, accompanied by his own guitar-playing.<br>
<br>In the following year at The Roundhouse in London, during one of his earliest professional performances, Drake was spotted by Ashley Hutchings, then bass player with the folk-rock group Fairport Convention, who recommended him to Fairport's producer and manager, Joe Boyd. Impressed by the demo tape he was sent, Boyd soon signed him to Island Records, the leading independent record label of the time. Drake's d&eacute;but album, <span class="italic">Five Leaves Left</span> (1969), featured esteemed musicians such as guitarist Richard Thompson and double bass player Danny Thompson and lavish string arrangements by Drake's Cambridge contemporary Robert Kirby. The album attracted favourable reviews on its release, but sold few copies.<br>
<br>Drake was strikingly good-looking and charismatic, with trademark shoulder-length hair. He had been happy enough to play live in public while in groups at Marlborough College but the concerts he gave to promote his d&eacute;but recording showed him as a reluctant solo performer. Contemporary accounts speak of a shy figure, clearly uncomfortable in front of an audience; and in that pre-video age when live shows were the only way for new artists to be seen, his continued reluctance to perform inevitably restricted his audience. No live footage of Drake's few performances survives.<br>
<br>For his second album, <span class="italic">Bryter Layter</span> (1970), Drake was accompanied by Fairport Convention's Dave Pegg and Dave Mattacks, and the Velvet Underground's John Cale. The record was a musical triumph which on its release drew favourable comparisons with Van Morrison's <span class="italic">Astral Weeks</span> (1968), and nearly thirty years later was hailed by <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> as the greatest cult album ever made. Drake himself was convinced that this was the record that would help him achieve the success he longed for. But he faced tough competition from the many other singer&#150;songwriters: Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Cat Stevens, Elton John, Carole King, James Taylor. They were reaching their peak at the same time, and this, together with a lack of radio airplay, sparse press interest, and his growing distaste for live performance, resulted once again in low sales.<br>
<br>Disillusioned by the commercial failure of his first two records and the decision of his manager, Joe Boyd, to relocate to America, Drake became more silent and withdrawn and friends began to notice the first signs of the depression which eventually killed him. Despite his increasingly fragile state, he found the inner strength to make one last album, <span class="italic">Pink Moon</span> (1972). Recorded totally solo and in just two brief sessions, this stark and haunting collection has been praised posthumously as the best of Drake's three albums, but at the time it suffered the same commercial ignominy as its predecessors.<br>
<br>In 1972, with his depression deepening and his career effectively over, Drake left London in despair and returned to the family home in Warwickshire, where he spent the rest of his life. Shocked by their son's condition, his parents sought medical help and soon after his return home Drake spent five weeks in a local psychiatric hospital. But on his release the depression persisted and he was forced, reluctantly, to rely on the drugs prescribed by his psychiatrist.<br>
<br>In 1974 Drake went into the studio for one last time. He spent a day recording, hoping that this would be the start of his fourth album, but what emerged from that session were the four final tracks of his life: &#145;Rider on the Wheel&#146;, &#145;Black Eyed Dog&#146;, &#145;Hanging on a Star&#146;, and &#145;Voice from the Mountain&#146;. That autumn his parents were delighted when he announced he was going to Paris to visit some friends and to see the chanteuse Fran&ccedil;oise Hardy, who had earlier expressed interest in recording some of his work. However, any improvement was short-lived and within weeks of returning home he was dead. It was in his childhood bedroom at Far Leys, Bates Lane, in Tanworth in Arden, Warwickshire, that Drake's mother found the body of her only son on the morning of 25 November 1974. He had overdosed on Tryptizol, one of the powerful anti-depressants he had been prescribed to help fight his illness. The coroner's verdict was suicide, although many who knew him remain convinced that the overdose was accidental. He was buried in St Mary Magdelene churchyard, Tanworth in Arden. He was unmarried.<br>
<br>Thereafter Drake's parents received a steady stream of visitors to Far Leys. The cult burgeoned in 1979 with the release of the box-set <span class="italic">Fruit Tree</span>, which included the final four tracks recorded in 1974, which had previously remained unreleased. A subsequent posthumous collection, <span class="italic">Time of No Reply</span> (1987), and the compilations <span class="italic">Heaven in a Wild Flower</span> (1990) and <span class="italic">Way to Blue</span> (1994) have all further enhanced Drake's musical legacy.<br>
<br>Nick Drake has been called the first singer&#150;songwriter whose career began after he died; while other fatalities such as Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, and John Lennon enjoyed a posthumous resurgence of interest in their work, they had all achieved a considerable degree of fame prior to their deaths, whereas during his lifetime Drake's music was known only to a select few. In later years he was cited as an influence by such major talents as REM, Blur, Radiohead, Paul Weller, and Lucinda Williams; to this day guitarists remain mesmerized by his inimitable technique and listeners are drawn in by his intimate, essentially English style of singing. In 2000 a prize-winning short documentary film, <span class="italic">A Skin too Few</span>, was made about his life and music, and his songs are increasingly heard on film soundtracks. But his biggest commercial breakthrough came during 1998, when Volkswagen used the song &#145;Pink Moon&#146; in an American television commercial. In the weeks following its first airing American sales of the eponymous album outstripped those for Drake's entire output during his lifetime. A quarter of a century after his death Nick Drake had achieved the success and recognition which had eluded him during his short life.<br>
