<span class="headword">Larmour,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1764&#150;1807), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, almost certainly had a relatively humble upbringing and background before entering the navy as an ordinary seaman; no details are known of his parentage or upbringing. Larmour (nicknamed Jack) had a life and career that would have remained obscure had it not been for his influence on another younger officer, Thomas Cochrane (later tenth earl of Dundonald), whom he encountered in 1793. For Cochrane, Larmour was<blockquote>one of a not very numerous class, whom, for their superior seamanship, the Admiralty was glad to promote from the forecastle to the quarter-deck, in order that they might mould into shape the questionable materials supplied by a parliamentary influence. (Dundonald, 11)</blockquote>Promoted to the rank of lieutenant in June 1784, Larmour possessed abilities that were sufficiently recognized for the Admiralty to employ him during the peace which followed the American War of Independence. In 1787 he was serving as fifth lieutenant of the new ship <i>Colossus</i> (74 guns) and by 1791 he was first lieutenant of the frigate <i>Hind</i> commanded by the Hon. Sir Alexander Cochrane. In June 1793, while the <i>Hind</i> was refitting at Sheerness, Alexander Cochrane sent his nephew Thomas on the vessel as a midshipman, where he came under Larmour's care and instruction. Cochrane was highly impressed to find Larmour dressed in the garb of an ordinary seaman complete with marlinspike round his neck and lump of grease in his hand for treating the rigging. Contrary to the usual behaviour of the commissioned officer Larmour's &#145;only ideas of relaxation were to throw off the lieutenant and resume the functions of the able seaman&#146;  (Dundonald, 13). Thus Larmour provided a role model which Cochrane was himself to emulate successfully in later years.<br>
<br>At the end of 1793 Larmour followed Alexander Cochrane to the frigate <i>Thetis</i> serving on the Nova Scotia station; here he remained until July 1795, when he was promoted to the rank of commander. Although he probably remained unemployed on half pay for a short while, by 1797 he was commanding the <i>Lord Hood</i> (14 guns), a vessel hired by the Admiralty. Stationed in the North Sea he recaptured the <i>Phoenix</i> brig and successfully claimed salvage on a further brig, the <i>John &amp; Amy</i>. Having been promoted post captain on 16 April 1800, Larmour commanded successively the <i>Wassanaer</i> (64 guns) and the frigate <i>Diadem</i>, both with reduced armament. His contact with the Hon. Sir Alexander Cochrane was renewed in March 1801, when Larmour was selected to assist Cochrane with the landing of Sir Ralph Abercromby's troops in Abu Qir Bay during the campaign to drive Napoleon's army out of Egypt. Following the success of this operation he was appointed to the frigate <i>Endymion</i> and then, in mid-1802, the frigate <i>Clyde</i> stationed in the North Sea. By May 1803 Larmour was commanding a small squadron responsible for the blockade of the Elbe. Towards the end of 1805 he briefly commanded the <i>Temeraire</i> and the <i>Audacious</i> before being appointed to another frigate, the <i>Emerald</i>. On 16 January 1807 he died suddenly of &#145;the Dropsy&#146; while in London; he may have been buried at Lambeth, London. His obituary notice described him as &#145;An excellent officer, who rose, by fortunate merit alone, from the humblest situation in a ship&#146;  (<span class="italic">Naval Chronicle</span>, 17, 176).<br>
