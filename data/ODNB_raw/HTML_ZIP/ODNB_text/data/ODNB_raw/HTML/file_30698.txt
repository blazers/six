<span class="headword">Bello, Sir Ahmadu</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Ahmadu Rabah]</span>, sardauna of Sokoto  (1910&#150;1966), <span class="occ">premier of Northern Nigeria</span>, was born at Rabah, a small riverain town upstream of Sokoto, one of ten half-brothers and fifteen half-sisters born to his father, Ibrahim Rabah, the district head. Both parents were Sokoto Fulani, though his maternal grandmother was a daughter of Ibrahim Dabo, emir of Kano (<i>r</i>. 1819&#150;46). His paternal grandfather was Abubakar Atiku, the seventh sultan of Sokoto (<i>r</i>. 1873&#150;7). &#145;Sardauna&#146;, the title by which he was later universally known and which he preferred to all others awarded him, was one of the senior traditional Fulani titles in Sokoto, restricted to scions of the ruling family. It glosses as &#145;captain of the royal bodyguard&#146;.<br>
<br>Ahmadu Rabah, as he was then known, learned Arabic and the <span class="roman">Koran</span> from a local religious <i>malam</i> or teacher. Aged ten, he was sent to the Sokoto provincial school and in 1926 to the Katsina Training College. The college, opened only in 1922, was designed to enable emirate Muslim students to observe their religious principles and upbringing while at the same time learning to become teachers in the new English-language based secondary schools. The college was to become &#145;the Eton of the North&#146;, and so influential were its alumni that when the first cabinet of Northern Nigeria was formed in 1951, nearly every minister was an old Katsina College boy. A prefect and a hard-working student, Ahmadu was also a keen cricketer and captained the college team at Eton fives, introduced by one of the first British tutors at the college, S. J. Hogben. In later years he was invited to play fives at Eton College; in return he hosted the Eton fives team in Nigeria. During his premiership he was frequently to be found enjoying fives with members of the northern politico-administrative &eacute;lite, urging his cabinet to play also&#151;&#145;quick exercise for stiff Ministers&#146;, he would explain.<br>
<br>On finishing at Katsina College in 1931 Ahmadu was appointed to the new Sokoto middle school, teaching English and geometry and being in charge of games. In 1934 he was, at only twenty-four, turbanned district head of Rabah. There were still no schools in the outlying districts, so, in addition to tax-collecting and encouraging agricultural improvements, Ahmadu spent his spare time teaching local children. To keep up his English in a town where no other Nigerian spoke it, he borrowed the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> from a district officer who used to visit Rabah on tour.<br>
<br>Promotion in the Sokoto native administration (local government) came in 1938 when Ahmadu was posted to the boom town of Gusau, on the new railway line from Zaria, to supervise the work of a dozen subordinate district heads. He was appointed to the sultan's council and given the title sardauna. He became involved in &#145;war work&#146;, including grain purchases, recruitment of labour, and organizing patrols on the frontier with Dahomey. Intrigue played its part, too, but following his conviction for tax embezzlement he appealed to the supreme court and was acquitted. He did not return to Gusau but became the sultan's councillor for police and prisons.<br>
<br>Unlike his political peers Obafemi Awolowo and Nnamdi Azikiwe, the sardauna was essentially a native administration man. He had no higher education or professional training. It was not until 1948 that he travelled outside Nigeria, to England on a British Council study tour of local government, and only in 1949 did he visit the Nigerian capital, Lagos. With party politics imploding on Nigeria following the 1946 constitution, the sardauna was elected a member for Sokoto in 1949. He became president of the literary society turned political party, the Northern Peoples Congress (NPC), and after the 1951 election he was appointed minister of works for the north. He soon added community development and the powerful portfolio of local government. Under the 1954 federal constitution he became premier of the Northern Region. Again unlike his regional counterparts, he never sought to move to Lagos, content to leave the prime ministership to his NPC vice-president, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa. Significantly, he publicly referred to Tafawa Balewa as &#145;my able lieutenant&#146;.<br>
<br>Fortunately for the north, its political leadership was in strong and safe hands during the critical years from 1951 to 1960. Determined that the region&#151;larger than the west and east together in population and land&#151;should play its full role in the federal government despite its backwardness in Western education, the sardauna rejected the southern politicians' motion of 1953 in the house of representatives that Nigeria should become self-governing in 1956, and substituted the words &#145;as soon as practicable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Debates of the House of Representatives</span>, 31 March 1953, 985 ff.), meaning when the north was ready to assume its role in the manning and management of the federation. To this end, the sardauna instituted a vigorous programme of northernization of the regional bureaucracy, with priority of appointment going first to a northerner, then, if none was available, to a European on contract, and only finally to a Nigerian from the other regions. This policy was implemented through crash programmes to train northerners for the civil service, in which the Institute of Administration at Zaria (called &#145;my baby&#146; by the sardauna) was the region's flagship. Northernization did not endear the sardauna to the south, nor did his threat to secede unless the north was given what he saw as its fair share and proper place. Because of his impeccably aristocratic (his great-grandfather was Shehu Usman dan Fodio, founder of the Sokoto empire <i>c</i>.1810) and religious (he traced his lineage to the Prophet Muhammad) pedigree, he was able to carry the traditional northern rulers with him in his change-within-continuity reforms. He remained premier of the Northern Region after Nigerian independence in 1960, keeping a vigilant eye on the national policies formulated in Lagos.<br>
<br>The sardauna was appointed CBE in 1953. Advanced to KBE in 1959, he took the name of his revered ancestor Sultan Bello. His memoir, <span class="italic">My Life</span>, appeared in 1962. Though ghosted, it represents a major statement. In 1963 he became the founding chancellor of Ahmadu Bello University. He had married Hafsatu (1920&#150;1966) of Sokoto, daughter of the waziri, Abdulkadir Macido, in 1932. They had no children but the sardauna was survived by three daughters born to his fourth wife, Amina, whom he married in 1940. In 1934 he had also married Kande and then Amiru. Both were divorced in 1938. He married Jabbo in 1952. Despite not bearing him any children, Hafsatu remained his senior wife throughout.<br>
<br>A giant in every sense and an aristocrat in every way, &#145;distinguished in appearance and conspicuously well dressed in the many-coloured splendour of the Northern robes&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), the sardauna held centre stage. With the ready vanity of a prima donna and a thunderous temper as quick to deflate as to erupt, he was no sufferer of fools. &#145;They say that I am proud and impatient&#146;, he wrote. &#145;Who would not be, with all the responsibilities that have been placed upon me?&#146;  (Bello, 238). Yet laughter, friendship, and generosity came easily to him. As leader of the NPC, he enjoyed huge popularity in the north. A devout Muslim who frequently undertook the pilgrimage to Mecca, his personal leadership of the Islamic conversion campaign among northern animists nevertheless did not win him uncritical support, even from the clerics. He had the gift of portraying himself as the northern culture-hero, rich in allusion to the history of his ancestors in establishing the Fulani empire and ever ready with a Hausa proverb or allegory. In the military coup of 15 January 1966 the sardauna and his wife Hafsatu were murdered: they were shot at State House. He was buried at the sultan's house in Unguwar Sarki, Kaduna. For many in the south, his assassination was the symbolic elimination of the feared northern political domination.<br>
<br>Death spared the sardauna the need for any decision over when to retire from party politics and compete for the sultanship of Sokoto, for which both his ancestry and his achievements rendered him pre-eminently eligible. In 1968 the award of grand commander of the federal republic of Nigeria (GCON) was posthumously conferred. On his success in creating Northern Nigeria there is no dissent: without his strong and unifying leadership in the 1950s, there would have been no such polity. On his contribution to Nigerian unity, debate continues. To understand the sardauna, it is not possible to isolate his activities and attitudes from the mood of his time and the whole context of 150 years of Nigerian history. His legacy remains a palpable one.<br>
