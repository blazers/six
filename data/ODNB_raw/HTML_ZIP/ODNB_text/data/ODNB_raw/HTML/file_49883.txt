<span class="headword">McEvoy, Sir  Theodore Neuman</span>  (1904&#150;1991), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born on 21 November 1904 at 3 Claremont Road, Cricklewood, Middlesex, the second son and youngest of three children of the Revd Cuthbert McEvoy (1870&#150;1944), Congregational minister, and his wife, Margaret Kate (1871&#150;1961), daughter of John Birt Ulph and his wife, Laura Louise Daniell. Advances in aviation during the First World War attracted the teenage McEvoy to flying. Also, his much loved elder brother was an air &#145;ace&#146; on the Italian front, transferring later to the newly formed Royal Air Force. The new service's cadet college at Cranwell opened in 1920, but the fees were prohibitive amounting to half McEvoy's father's stipend. After leaving Haberdashers' Aske's School in May 1922, McEvoy started overhauling aero engines at the Aircraft Disposal Co. near Croydon, hoping that the work would lead to flying lessons. However, his qualities were recognized at the firm and he was encouraged to try again for the RAF. His failure of a cadet test was challenged and the War Office found he had in fact passed with high marks. Benevolent relatives then offered to pay for a crammer course and, if necessary, Cranwell's fees. From the Kensington Coaching College, McEvoy gained first place into Cranwell (or Sandhurst had he wished), winning a full scholarship.<br>
<br>Aircraft between the wars were by present-day standards much affected by weather and regular engine failure. However, they could be landed in any suitable field, which was fortunate for McEvoy, who survived nine forced landings, two while he was still training. Graduating with the sword of honour, he served his apprenticeship in front-line fighter squadrons on his way to becoming an exceptional fighter pilot and taking part in the Hendon air pageant with 41 squadron. At this time McEvoy began to suffer pain from a progressive and crippling disease of the spine which eventually fused, giving him a pronounced stoop. That he was able to continue piloting until his retirement despite this permanent affliction reflected his determination and the flexibility of medical and air staffs who recognized his value to the service.<br>
<br>A two-year engineering course developed McEvoy's analytical and logical skills and allowed time for sport; he became the RAF sabre champion. Next came a two-year posting to Iraq in charge of the aircraft servicing depot, where he tested aircraft and was involved in technical development and parachute trials. He also flew with 55 bomber squadron carrying out air control of the fractious tribes in the area. On the ship returning from UK leave he met Marian Jane Benson (<i>b</i>. 1913), daughter of William Alfred Coxon, a medical practitioner working in Egypt. They married on 17 September 1935.<br>
<br>The period of mounting tension as the Second World War approached saw McEvoy at the peak of his piloting skills in two &eacute;lite squadrons&#151;1 and 43&#151;at Tangmere. In 1937 he widened his experience at the RAF Staff College. His two children, Jill (<i>b</i>. 1938) and Robin (<i>b</i>. 1940), saw less of their father than they would have liked as the intensity of the war increased. His considerable flying experience led to his transfer to the Air Ministry in operational and intelligence posts, from which he emerged in 1941 as a group captain to command the fighter station at Northolt with its Polish squadrons. True to form, he flew with the squadrons when shortage of pilots justified, and on a &#145;sweep&#146; over France was wounded by cannon fire, managing to nurse his damaged Hurricane back to the English coast. Appointed OBE, he was also recognized by the Poles for his moral and practical support for their pilots by his appointment as a commander of the order of Polonia Restituta.<br>
<br>Inevitably McEvoy's staff appointments reflected his background of fighter operations. As senior air staff officer of 11 fighter group, and of 84 group in the Tactical Air Force, formed to support the invasion of Europe, he had ample scope for his administrative skills, particularly in the entirely new organization of mixed-role squadrons in the tactical groups. Planning and supervising the achievement of air superiority over the bridgehead, and the subsequent move of squadrons to the temporary landing grounds on the continental toehold, McEvoy moved with the victorious armies until virtually the end of the war. By now an air commodore, he was mentioned in dispatches for his part in the success of the Tactical Air Force and advanced to CBE in the victory honours. From now on increasingly senior staff appointments were inevitable, although he made every effort to keep in flying practice, which maintained the confidence and respect of those he commanded. After the course in 1948 at the Imperial Defence College came command of 61 group involving the reserve units of the RAF, particularly the squadrons of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force, whose Spitfires he was well qualified to fly.<br>
<br>Promoted to air vice marshal in 1950 as assistant chief of the air staff (training), McEvoy convinced the service of the need to adopt all-jet-engined flying training, in spite of the cost and the high ability required of the cadets. In the post-war era this helped the RAF to maintain professional excellence as the majority of experienced pilots were demobilized; this was recognized by his appointment as CB. Following two years as an instructor at the Imperial Defence College came a return to Europe as chief of staff of allied air forces, central Europe. This involved air planning for the event of a Soviet attack on the central front and ensuring that NATO squadrons based there were at the highest level of efficiency. Promoted to air marshal and knighted (KCB) in 1956, he epitomized the concept of deterrence&#151;&#145;being ready, able and willing to fight so as not to have to do so&#146;. The last three years until McEvoy retired in 1962 were spent as air secretary and as an air aide-de-camp to the queen. The former involved identifying and grooming &#145;high flyers&#146; in the service (its future leaders) as well as filling the day-to-day senior appointments, where his understanding of people made him an ideal choice for this task.<br>
<br>Retirement in Buckinghamshire gave McEvoy the opportunity to continue flying&#151;this time in gliders. He attained a considerable facility at this sport and became vice-president of the British Gliding Association. The precision he had learnt as an engineer and his co-ordination of hand and eye produced a skilled calligrapher, glass engraver, and golfer. His anti-communist stance through the organization Common Cause enabled him to expose the myths of this political system, and he lived to see the ultimate collapse of the USSR. He died at his home, Hurstwood, West Drive, Aldwick Bay Estate, Bognor Regis, on 28 September 1991; his wife survived him. After cremation at Chichester crematorium his ashes were interred in Tangmere churchyard.<br>
