<span class="headword">Vaughan,  Rice</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1672), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was the second son of Henry Vaughan of Gelli-goch, Machynlleth, and Mary, daughter of Maurice Wynn of Glyn, near Harlech. He attended Shrewsbury School (1615), entered Gray's Inn (1638), and was called to the bar on 20 June 1648. Vaughan sided with parliament in the civil wars and became a member of the committee for Cardiganshire, Pembrokeshire, and Carmarthenshire. He failed to be elected MP for Merioneth in 1654 and petitioned the council of state formally on 24 August 1654 because of the alleged irregularities and corrupt practices of the sheriff, Maurice Lewis, who, in collusion with Edward Vaughan of Llwydiarth, ensured that John Vaughan of Cefnbodig, near Llanycil, Merioneth, was elected. In the previous year, however, Rice Vaughan had been appointed prothonotary for Denbighshire and Montgomeryshire in the court of great sessions, having petitioned for the post on 3 January 1646. He served in the commission for sequestration from 1649, examined with others the miscarriages of the trustees and surveyors for the sale of forfeited estates, and was actively engaged with the business of the council of state in 1656. In 1659 he served as judge of great sessions for the Anglesey circuit  (Williams, 100). Vaughan's subsequent career is unclear, but he appears to have been imprisoned in the Tower for two years from May 1665.<br>
<br>Vaughan wrote three works at least, namely <span class="italic">A Plea for the Common Laws of England</span> (1651), a pamphlet addressed to the House of Commons replying to Hugh Peter's book <span class="italic">A Good Work for a Good Magistrate</span>; <span class="italic">Practica Walliae, or, The Proceedings in the Great Sessions of Wales</span> (1672), which was published posthumously; and <span class="italic">A Discourse of Coin and Coinage</span> (1675), again published posthumously and edited by Henry Vaughan, &#145;the Silurist&#146;. Vaughan was part of a group of lawyers that was &#145;opposed to all law reform or did not want changes to go further than those made during the Interregnum&#146;  (Veall, 98). In <span class="italic">A Plea for the Common Laws of England</span> he claimed that common laws were &#145;one of the most excellent and humane laws that any nation had&#146;. They had not been imposed by any king<blockquote>but consisted of laudable and righteous customs, based on reason and convenience, in common use over hundreds of years. As for the defects that did remain, Parliament was gradually throwing off the chaff; the task could not be done all at once. (ibid., 24)</blockquote>
