<span class="headword">Scott,  Peter Duncan</span>  (1914&#150;1977), <span class="occ">forensic psychiatrist</span>, the second son of Walter Scott, a brewer, and his wife, Jennie (formerly Troop), was born at 37 Earlsbury Gardens, Handsworth, Birmingham, on 13 June 1914. He was educated at St Cuthbert's preparatory school in Great Malvern, at Bromsgrove School, and at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, followed by clinical training at the London Hospital. He qualified in 1939 and soon joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, in which he had originally intended to serve as a surgeon, but he had to become shore based because of unmanageable seasickness. On 25 October 1940 he married Lilian Ruth (<i>b</i>. 1912/13), daughter of Daniel John Lewis, a quarry owner. Following contact with E. W. Anderson (later professor of psychiatry at Manchester), Scott took up psychiatric work, obtained the diploma in psychological medicine in 1944 through a correspondence course, and became a neuropsychiatric specialist. After the war he was recommended to Sir Aubrey Lewis and became a registrar at the Maudsley Hospital, followed by a year at Runwell Hospital, Essex.<br>
<br>In 1948 Scott returned to the Maudsley to take charge of clinical forensic services, and remained in that post until his death; there were very few specialists in this aspect of psychiatry when the National Health Service began in that year. For the first fifteen years Scott was concerned mainly with juvenile delinquents, both at Stamford House remand home and at the Maudsley out-patient department. This experience influenced his later work with adult offenders, in that he always looked for the former child and adolescent that the adult had once been, in forming his opinion. Scott's reports were marked by their penetrating descriptions and accessible language. Subsequently he took up a joint appointment between the Maudsley and the prison medical service at Brixton prison, turning his attention to major offenders. He held two evening out-patient clinics every week, so that those attending would not have to miss work. He had urged that the medical work of prisons should be taken over by the National Health Service, but this view was rejected by the government. The joint appointment system, however, ultimately failed.<br>
<br>Scott's enormous clinical experience, together with his personal qualities of integrity, lucid thinking, and clear expression, caused his advice to be sought for many commissions and working parties, for example, on the special hospitals, on murders at Carstairs State Hospital, on the prison medical service, the home secretary's Advisory Council on the Penal System, and the Aarvold subcommittee on dangerous offenders. The only times that his name became known to the public, though, were when he advised the police in the Spaghetti House and Balcombe Street sieges in 1975&#151;the origin of a new form of psychiatric skill. His advice to avoid any immediate use of force and play for time had successful results. He opposed the inauguration of a national programme of medium security units, believing that these would simply select out &#145;nice&#146; patients, and continue to reject those who were most in need. His contribution to the public services was acknowledged by his appointment as CBE in 1974; he had been elected FRCP and FRCPsych. in 1971.<br>
<br>Although an editor of the <span class="italic">British Journal of Criminology</span>, Scott wrote relatively little himself, but his few publications were both original and influential. Together with Robert Mark he published <span class="italic">The Disease of Crime: Punishment or Treatment?</span> (1972). Though widely read, he considered theories and classifications no substitute for personal understanding of the patient&#151;a quality he demonstrated to a special degree. As a result his teaching was based on the individual offender, from which he drew both unique and general lessons. Scott evolved his own diagnostic categories for forensic cases which were both original and expressed in non-technical language, but these, regrettably, never entered the published canon. He delighted in teaching and was very popular with specialist trainees, but he did not involve himself in formal research. He was chairman of the forensic psychiatry section of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, 1975&#150;7.<br>
<br>As an individual, Scott was quiet and reserved, allowing few people to get on intimate terms with him. He was devoted to his wife, Lilian, and their two daughters. His greatest spare time interest was bird-watching, in which he was an expert, and he was accomplished in such do-it-yourself activities as carpentry and bricklaying.<br>
<br>Although there had been psychiatrists before who examined offenders, wrote about them, and gave evidence in courts, Scott was essentially the founder of forensic psychiatry as a recognized discipline in Britain. He did this particularly in association with his successor at the Maudsley, Professor T. C. N. Gibbens. Furthermore, on the world scale, British forensic psychiatry then attained a foremost position through his pupils, who undertook the research and writing that were not his own forte. Scott exercised enormous influence through his example, his individual teaching, and the impression made by his personal qualities on colleagues, administrators, judges, and politicians. Yet he did nothing to promote his own reputation or propagate his views; others constantly came to him for advice. He &#145;never deviated from his working attempts to improve the lot of patients who were otherwise despised and rejected&#146;  (J. C. G. in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>), continuing to believe that the National Health Service had failed the disturbed offender:<blockquote>He was equally loyal to society in believing firmly that compassion did not mean sentimentality, and that the psychiatrist's role was to help the offender to come to terms with society as it is, and not as it should be. He was acknowledged as the foremost forensic psychiatrist of his time. (Munk, <span class="italic">Roll</span>)</blockquote>Scott died at his home, 53 Park Road, Chiswick, London, on 6 August 1977 after a short illness. The Royal College of Psychiatrists subsequently established an annual lecture in his memory.<br>
