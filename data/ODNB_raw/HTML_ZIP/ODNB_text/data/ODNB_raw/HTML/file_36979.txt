<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ingram,  Arthur Foley  Winnington-</span>  (1858&#150;1946), <span class="occ">bishop of London</span>, was born on 26 January 1858 at the rectory, Stanford-on-Teme, Worcestershire, the fourth of the ten children of the rector, the Revd Edward Winnington-Ingram, and his wife, Maria Louisa, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21903/', "Henry Pepys")</script>, bishop of Worcester. His father was also lord of the manor of Ribbesford. Through both parents he possessed connections with leading county families.<br>
<br>Winnington-Ingram was educated at Marlborough College and at Keble College, Oxford, where he gained first-class honours in classical moderations in 1879 and a second class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1881. Though he was to adhere broadly to the Tractarian principles he imbibed at Keble, he disavowed party labels and even described himself as an evangelical &#145;at heart&#146;. Unspecified doubts about the truth of Christian doctrines at school and university delayed his ordination for three years, while he worked as a travelling tutor on the continent. Ordained deacon and priest in 1884, he served his title as assistant curate at St Mary's, Shrewsbury. The faith he now professed changed, on his own admission, not at all during the course of his long ministry. In 1885 he was appointed as domestic chaplain to W. D. Maclagan, bishop of Lichfield, whom he served for three years.<br>
<br>In 1888 Winnington-Ingram was appointed head of the recently founded Oxford House in Bethnal Green. This was a fortunate appointment. His uncomplicated character and sense of humour at once made him popular with people of the East End, and he transformed the work of the house within a few years by his energy and adroit use of his personal charm and social connections. By 1892 he had rebuilt the house, increased the number of residents from three to thirty, and trebled its annual income. His regular visits to Oxford colleges encouraged a stream of undergraduates to take up work in the East End. In addition to leading the clubs and charitable activities the house supported, he devoted considerable time to Christian apologetics, speaking against the secularists at open-air meetings in Victoria Park. From 1895 to 1897 he held the position of head of the house jointly with the rectory of St Matthew's, Bethnal Green.<br>
<br>Winnington-Ingram's success in the East End made him the obvious choice when, in 1897, Mandell Creighton, bishop of London, sought a suffragan bishop of Stepney, to be also a canon of St Paul's. He was consecrated on St Andrew's day, 30 November 1897. His chief work as bishop was to begin a fund-raising campaign for the East London Church Fund. But his responsibilities here were short-lived: Mandell Creighton's death in 1901 gave Lord Salisbury the chance to nominate Winnington-Ingram to the see of London, and he was enthroned in St Paul's Cathedral on 30 April 1901. He held the see for thirty-eight years. He approached diocesan responsibility with characteristic energy, resisting pressure for the division of the diocese. An exacting weekly routine helped him to master a substantial volume of business. When in residence in London he visited four parishes every week to preach and meet his parish clergy. During his tenure of the see nearly 100 new parishes were created and 94 churches built. He prided himself on having ordained some 2205 men to the ministry by the time he resigned. Despite his energy he was ill at ease with matters of ecclesiastical discipline, and faced particular difficulties over militant protestant hostility to ritualist clergy. His policy of tolerating most innovations in ritual, and yet prohibiting certain practices, failed to satisfy either extreme.<br>
<br>The range of Winnington-Ingram's public concern was considerable. In 1917 he led the National Mission of Repentance and Hope, touring every diocese to stir up renewed zeal for the war effort, and then in 1919 led a national campaign to re-establish the Church of England Temperance Society. In London he chaired the Public Morality Council, working closely with police to close down brothels, clean up public parks, and oppose &#145;offensive&#146; plays and birth control propaganda; in this work there was a somewhat rigid adherence to the values of his late Victorian upbringing. In the House of Lords he took a particular interest in the housing of the poor and in unemployment; his natural conservatism did not prevent him from speaking out against what he perceived to be social injustices, as when he attacked slum conditions in Paddington in the mid-1930s.<br>
<br>By far the most controversial aspect of Winnington-Ingram's episcopate was his tireless (and never modified) public advocacy of Britain's cause during the First World War. He saw the war as a &#145;great crusade to defend the weak against the strong&#146;  (Winnington-Ingram, 111), and accepted uncritically stories of atrocities perpetrated by German troops. In 1915 he toured the western front, in 1916 the Grand Fleet at Rosyth and Scapa Flow, and in 1918 Salonica. His skill at public speaking made him a successful recruiter of volunteers early in the war, and he took great delight in his position as chaplain to the London rifle brigade; later in the war he encouraged his own younger clergy to enlist as combatants. He had an unquestioning trust in the civilizing mission of the British empire, and freely used language about the German people which verged on xenophobia. H. H. Asquith considered that he had preached &#145;jingoism of the shallowest kind&#146; throughout the war  (Wilkinson, 70).<br>
<br>Winnington-Ingram travelled widely during his episcopate, making five trips in all to Canada and two to America. Through various official duties he built up links between the Anglican church in these countries and the Church of England. He was president of the British Columbia Association for over thirty years; his strong advocacy of English-speaking settlements in Canada, in response to immigration there from eastern Europe, was tactless and unfortunate. He extended his second visit to America, in 1926, to a tour of the Far East and Australasia the following year.<br>
<br>Winnington-Ingram's public reputation stood at its highest before 1918. A handsome, charismatic man, he had an ebullient, open, and straightforward personality which helped to make him a persuasive speaker. His Marlborough nickname, Chuckles, clung to him as an undergraduate and was entirely appropriate. His simplicity and boundless optimism put him at his best in situations where he was called upon to act as advocate of a particular cause, but they were positive handicaps when it came to appreciating the complexities of political and religious affairs. His failure to understand the depth of divisions within his own diocese meant that he was unable to develop a concerted policy for managing it; the discipline of the diocese seemed ever more unstable as the years passed by. He was unable to understand the mood of pessimism and disillusionment which set in after the First World War, and this, along with his essentially Victorian moral character, made him seem increasingly an anachronism in the inter-war years.<br>
<br>Winnington-Ingram was an enthusiastic sportsman, priding himself on his prowess at tennis and hockey, which he played into his seventies, and golf, which he played to the end of his life. His personal life was marked by moderation and simplicity. He was a teetotaller. He did not marry, though he was briefly engaged while bishop of Stepney. He resigned his see in 1939 and retired to Bournemouth, though he spent six months of the year at The Boynes, Upton upon Severn, where he died on 26 May 1946. A private funeral service at Upton church was followed by a public one on 7 June 1946 at St Paul's Cathedral, where his remains were interred.<br>
