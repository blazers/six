<span class="headword">Williams,  John</span>  (1727&#150;1798), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister and author</span>, was born on 25 March 1727 in the market town of Lampeter, Cardiganshire. His father was a tanner. He was first educated at the local free school, probably in Lampeter, where he gained a knowledge of the classics. At the age of nineteen he entered the Cambrian Academy at Carmarthen, superintended by the revds Samuel Thomas and Evan Davies, to qualify for the dissenting ministry. On completing his studies, Williams was appointed classical assistant to the Revd Mr Howell at a large school in Birmingham. In 1752, having received a unanimous call from the congregation, he became minister at Star Lane Chapel, Stamford, Lincolnshire. It is recorded that this was on Lady day and that he remained until Lady day 1756  (Jackson, 5). Most sources, however, state that he moved from Stamford to a similar charge at Wokingham, Berkshire, in 1755. In any event, there is general agreement that this move was occasioned by Williams's desire to be nearer London.<br>
<br>While resident in Wokingham, Williams spent much of his time in the preparation of <span class="italic">A concordance to the Greek testament with the English version to each word; the principal Hebrew roots corresponding to the Greek words of the Septuagint; short critical notes &hellip; and an index for the benefit of the English reader</span> (1767). Among the list of subscribers are laymen and women, Oxford and Cambridge dons, and dissenting and established clergymen, including Gregory Sharpe, chaplain-in-ordinary to the king. In a prefatory letter Williams acknowledges Sharpe's considerable assistance in the work. The London <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> states it was &#145;compiled with great pains and accuracy&#146;  (1767/1, 400). It remained a standard work until 1839, when George Vicesimus Wigram published a similar compilation.<br>
<br>In 1767 Williams completed his migration to the metropolis on succeeding the Revd Mr Barron as minister of the Independent chapel in Sydenham. On 5 July 1768 he married Martha Still (<i>d</i>. 1777), a widow from his congregation at Wokingham. Following her death, he married on 22 January 1781, at St Giles Cripplegate, Elizabeth Dunn (<i>d</i>. in or after 1798), the daughter of John Dunn, a merchant of Newington Green described as &#145;one of the most useful laymen among the Dissenters&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cambrian Register</span>, 3.191).<br>
<br>From June 1777 Williams combined his ministry at Sydenham with the post of curator, or librarian, at the Dr Daniel Williams's Library in Red Cross Street, London, a position that provided good opportunities for his academic studies. On retiring from the appointment in 1782 he became a trustee of the library, remaining so until 1790. In 1794 or 1795 the lease on the Sydenham chapel expired. The congregation was also considerably reduced, and Williams retired to Islington, where he spent the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>Little is known of Williams the pastor. His reputation rests primarily on biblical and linguistic scholarship and at some point in his career he received the degree of LLd. In addition to the concordance, his main theological work was a refutation of, or <span class="italic">A Free Enquiry into the Authenticity of the First and Second Chapters of St Matthews Gospel</span> (1771; 2nd edn, 1789). The work attracted various responses. In 1796 he again addressed the subject in <span class="italic">Remarks on Dr W Bell's Arguments for the Authenticity of the Two First Chapters of Matthew and Luke</span>. He published several single sermons, including <span class="italic">The Favours of Providence to Britain in 1759</span>, in which he draws parallels between <span class="roman">1 Samuel</span> 7 and General Wolfe's capture of Quebec. Two of his publications, <span class="italic">Thoughts on Subscription to the Thirty Nine Articles</span> (n.d.) and <span class="italic">A serious and earnest address to gentlemen of all denominations who opposed the late application of the protestant dissenting ministers to parliament for relief in the matter of subscription</span> (1773), indicate, although there is no firm evidence, that as a London minister he would have been involved in the 1772&#150;3 dissenting movement. In the preface to his <span class="italic">Address</span>, he states that he wishes &#145;to contribute his mite towards farthering the much wished for Relief in the matter of Subscription&#146;.<br>
<br>Other publications include <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Origin and the most Rational and Natural Method of Teaching the Languages</span> (1783), in which Williams advocates &#145;as the most natural order&#146; that young people should first have accurate grammatical knowledge of their own language, followed in order by Hebrew, the most ancient and &#145;the most simple and concise of any&#146;, Arabic, Samaritan, Chaldee, Syriac, and especially Greek. Latin, he suggests, as it derives from the others, should be taught last. He also concluded that Latin should be the universal language for the sciences. <span class="italic">Clerical Reform, or, England's Salvation</span> was published in 1792, &#145;shewing its necessity by a comparative State of the Landed Property, in respect to Taxes, Mortgages, Funds, Tithes, &amp;c&#146;  (Watt, 969). Arguably his most important literary works were <span class="italic">An inquiry into the truth of the tradition concerning the discovery of America by Prince Madog ab Owen Gwynedd, about the year 1170</span> (1791) and <span class="italic">Further Observations on the Discovery of America by Prince Madog</span> (1792), which contained an account of a Welsh tribe of American Indians in western North America. It has been suggested that the interest aroused may have suggested the topic for Southey's poem &#145;Madoc&#146;. The <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> notes the author &#145;earnestly recommends a subscription, to defray the expenses of a visit to the North West part of America, for the purpose of ascertaining the fact in question&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, 1792/9, 470).<br>
<br>Williams died on 15 April 1798 at his home in Canonbury Row, Islington. At the time of his death he had almost finished printing a translation into English of a scarce work by M. P. Cheilomeus, <span class="italic">Graeco-Barbara novi testamenti quas orienti originem debent</span> (1649). He was survived by his wife, to whom he left all his property and his papers.<br>
