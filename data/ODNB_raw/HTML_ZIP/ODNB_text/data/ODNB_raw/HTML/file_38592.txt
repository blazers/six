<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Emerson,  Peter Henry</span>  (1856&#150;1936), <span class="occ">photographer and writer</span>, was born on 3 May 1856 in Casa Grande, La Palma, Cuba, the first of the three children of Henry Ezekiel Emerson and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Billing Harris. Both parents were of English extraction, his mother directly (she came from Cornwall) and his father through descent. Among his relatives were the Americans Samuel Morse and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emerson, who was baptized Pedro Enrique, spent his early childhood in Cuba. Following a brief period in the United States (1864&#150;9) the family went to England, where Peter, as he now called himself, was sent to Cranleigh, a public school in Surrey. After a short time at King's College, London, in 1874, he opted for a career in medicine and studied at Clare College, Cambridge (1874&#150;9), where his athletic skills in football and rowing were allied to his interests in science. To the amazement of his contemporaries he won the Leathes prize in theology. His father had a highly successful sugar plantation in Cuba, and Emerson always enjoyed a private income.<br>
<br>Emerson practised medicine only briefly before turning to notions of art and to playing billiards. Typically, he excelled at both. He was a naturalist and an ornithologist, and his first book, a novel entitled <span class="italic">Paul Ray at the Hospital</span> (privately published, 1882), reputedly took him only two weeks to write. He was on honeymoon at the time, but Emerson managed to balance maverick tendencies: eccentricity and idiosyncrasy were combined with a fine sense for art, science, and sport (particularly rowing). He had married Edith Amy (<i>b</i>. 1853/4), the daughter of Joseph Ainsworth, a cotton spinner, on 22 June 1881, and the couple had five children: Leonard (1882), Sylvia (1884), Gladys (1885), Zo&euml; (1893), and Ralf (1897).<br>
<br>Emerson began working in photography in 1882, and his major published works were photographic, both visual and theoretical. Of these, <span class="italic">Life and Landscape on the Norfolk Broads</span> (1886) and <span class="italic">Naturalistic Photography for Students of the Art</span> (1889) are the most significant&#151;the former for its evocative pastoral scenes and its depictions of East Anglian life, which epitomized his strong and poetic work, and the latter for its polemical discourse which countered much contemporary thinking. His approach was typified by his attitude to the retouching of photographs, which he described as &#145;the process by which a good, bad or indifferent photograph is converted into a bad drawing or painting&#146;  (Leggat). Among his realist contentions was that the photographer should seek to imitate human vision by blurring the periphery of the image. This brought him into conflict with the eminent photographer Henry Peach Robinson; in the course of an ill-tempered debate, Emerson memorably described Robinson's seminal <span class="italic">Pictorial Effect in Photography</span> as &#145;the quintessence of literary fallacies and art anachronisms&#146;  (ibid.). In all, Emerson was the author of twenty-four books and portfolios, some of which ran to several editions. His original work is now held by, among others, the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, Bradford (Royal Photographic Society collection), the Getty Museum in Los Angeles, and the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York. Emerson was also a prolific writer of magazine articles and letters.<br>
<br>With his scientific background, Emerson initially favoured the platinum process for printmaking. It had an exceptional tonal scale and was archivally as stable as the paper base would allow. It was, however, time-consuming, and he changed to using photogravure, invented by a Czech, K&aacute;roly Klics, in the 1850s. This means of reproducing images, which combined photographic techniques with those of etching, was less subtle than platinum but still allowed for a great deal of tonal control by the artist.<br>
<br>Emerson was a naturalistic photographer at a time when reality had fallen from favour. He eventually decided he had been wrong to claim photographs as &#145;great works of art&#146;  (in <span class="italic">The Death of Naturalistic Photography</span>, a privately published pamphlet of 1891). Yet he did not abandon photography immediately, and in 1895 he was awarded the Royal Photographic Society's progress medal; later, in the 1920s, he began to issue his own merit awards. As if to accentuate his freedom from conformity, in 1908 he compiled and issued a rule book for billiards. He died of heart trouble on 12 May 1936 at his home, 3 Avenue Road, Falmouth, Cornwall, and was buried in the town. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>Emerson was a photographic revolutionary who set the tenor for the method of picture making which evolved into pictorialism and later into modernism. He was also a magniloquent writer and a fighter for photography as fine art. That he was so influential can be traced to several causes: first, to his implicit self-belief, which some found insufferable; second, to his iron self-discipline and ability to succeed in everything to which he applied himself; and third, to his recognition of the place which photography held within the broader sphere of visual art and how, too, it related to science. He was a protean person; a mover and shaker&#151;Victorian in the manner that made fortunes, empires, and discoveries. Born to a life of privilege, he used his inheritance wisely, albeit with flashes of bravura. He preached and practised at the same rate, with no quarter given, which is why some found him difficult. Others found Emerson's lack of capacity for compromise admirable. He had resolve and resolution and was a scholar, an athlete, and an intellectual.<br>
