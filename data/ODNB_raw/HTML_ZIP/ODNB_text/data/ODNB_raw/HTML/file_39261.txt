<span class="headword">Hygbald</span>  (<em>d.</em> 802/3), <span class="occ">bishop of Lindisfarne</span>, took over the duties of the aged Cynewulf, his predecessor as bishop of Lindisfarne, at Cynewulf's retirement in 780. He was consecrated later (in 780 or 781), after Cynewulf's death. Nothing is known of Hygbald's background, but it may be assumed from his name that he was English. It is possible that he had been educated in the religious community at Lindisfarne; certainly he was known to its members, since he was chosen by unanimous consent. No writings by him survive. Lindisfarne had long been regarded as one of the holiest sites in Britain, but the constitution of the community of which Hygbald took charge is unclear. From Alcuin's letters it seems that Bishop Hygbald was the head of a single monastic <i>familia</i>, and no other abbot or prior is attested during his term of office.<br>
<br>In the 780s Hygbald was present at at least one Northumbrian episcopal consecration and at the Legatine Council of 786, the acts of which he subscribed. In the 790s he continued to attend episcopal consecrations. Meanwhile, the serious disturbances in Northumbria of those years affected Hygbald directly. Lindisfarne was sacked by the vikings in 793. Although no demonstrably contemporary account gives precise information about the extent of the material damage, Alcuin's writings occasioned by the event show that it was intellectually and spiritually devastating, comparable in some respects to the sack of Rome. Yet Alcuin did assume that the community's regular life could continue (and indeed it was not until the following century that the monks had to leave their exposed location). As a result of the attack, Hygbald may have been burdened with the worry that the sinfulness of the community had occasioned divine vengeance. Alcuin consoled him with letters and his third-longest poem, but also admonished and exhorted him and the community to a better life.<br>
<br>The final decade of the eighth century was a time of violent contests for the Northumbrian throne, two of which impinged on Hygbald. In 796, after a reign of twenty-seven days, one former king, Osbald, took refuge on Lindisfarne and then fled from there by boat. Hygbald's possible role in that episode is unknown, but not long afterwards he attended the consecration and enthronement of Osbald's successor, King Eardwulf, in York Minster. Hygbald died on either 25 May 802 or 24 June 803.<br>
<br>Almost nothing is known of the condition of learning or monastic discipline on Lindisfarne in Hygbald's time; a century earlier, its scriptorium had been notable. Alcuin's letters to the community indicate that standards were at least adequate and that its reputation as a holy place was outstanding. The Carolingian scholar Candidus, known for his contributions to logic and speculative thought, began his education with Hygbald at Lindisfarne. Hygbald subsequently dispatched Candidus to the continent for further instruction from Alcuin.<br>
<br>It has been conjectured that Hygbald is identifiable with the Wigbald who was the chief scribe of the Barberini gospels (Vatican City, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, MS Barb. lat. 570) and whose signature may be seen on folio 153 of that manuscript. The suggestion must be rejected because the scribal signature there reads &#145;Uuigbald&#146;, an entirely different and not uncommon name, frequently recorded (with the spelling Uigbald) in the Durham <span class="italic">Liber vitae</span>. The ninth-century portion of that work includes the name Hygbald, but the absence of the bishop-section in the manuscript makes it impossible to determine which of the attestations might refer to the bishop of Lindisfarne. From the nineteenth century Hygbald was equated with Alcuin's correspondent Speratus, but that identification has now been disproven.<br>
