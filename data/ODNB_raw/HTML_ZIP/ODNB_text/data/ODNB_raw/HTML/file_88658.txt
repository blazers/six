<span class="headword">Fitzpatrick <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Liddell]</span>,  Anne</span>, countess of Upper Ossory <span class="st"> [<em>other married name </em>Anne FitzRoy, duchess of Grafton]</span>  (1737/8&#150;1804), <span class="occ">correspondent of Horace Walpole</span>, was the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40432/', "Sir Henry Liddell, fourth baronet, later Baron Ravensworth (bap. 1708, d. 1784)")</script>, and his wife, Anne (1712&#150;1794), daughter of Sir Peter Delm&eacute;, sometime lord mayor of London. Her father was a substantial coal owner in the north-east of England and Anne Liddell's childhood was probably divided between the family homes at Eslington, Northumberland, and Ravensworth Castle, near Lamesley, co. Durham, and London. On 29 January 1756, at her father's house in St James's Square, London, she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9628/', "Augustus Henry FitzRoy, earl of Euston (1735&#150;1811)")</script>, who succeeded his grandfather as third duke of Grafton in 1757. Four children followed: Georgiana (1757&#150;1799); George Henry (1760&#150;1844), styled earl of Euston during his father's lifetime [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9634/', "FitzRoy, George Henry, fourth duke of Grafton")</script>]; a son (<i>b</i>. and <i>d</i>. 1761); and Charles (1764&#150;1829) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9631/', "FitzRoy, Lord Charles")</script>].<br>
<br>The duchess of Grafton later claimed that she had married for love, though the social advantages the union brought her family, and the injection of cash she brought to the Grafton finances, were also important. The marriage may have been in difficulty by April 1761, when Horace Walpole told Horace Mann that &#145;The Graftons go abroad for the Duchess's health. Another climate may mend that&#151;I will not answer for more&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 9.363). The correspondence between the duchess and Walpole began in late summer 1761, when the duchess sent Walpole a <i>d&eacute;coupure</i> (a figure cut out in card) of herself and her daughter by Jean Huber of Geneva. Walpole's response began a series of 455 letters, which his twentieth-century editor W. S. Lewis considered showed him &#145;at his best as a writer and as a person&#146;  (ibid., 32.xxix). The Graftons remained abroad, in Geneva and in Italy, until August 1762.<br>
<br>The duchess was considered attractive, but this could not by itself provide a basis for a stable marriage. The duke apparently disliked her love of large social gatherings and often expensive card games, though he himself lost money on the turf. Walpole thought Grafton felt compromised politically by the duchess's friendship with the siblings Gertrude, duchess of Bedford, and the second Earl Gower; they were leading figures in the Bedford whig faction and Grafton was keen to emphasize his independence to win the favour of George III.<br>
<br>In 1764, while the duchess was pregnant with their youngest child, Grafton began to be seen openly with the courtesan Nancy Parsons. Following the birth of Lord Charles FitzRoy, and an argument in which the duchess told her husband she hated him, the duchess was expelled from the ducal residences. The Graftons were legally separated on 11 January 1765, the duchess keeping her jewels and her allowance of &pound;3000 p.a. By 1 February the duchess had established a separate household in Upper Grosvenor Street, London. During the spring she began a love affair with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2162/', "William Henry Cavendish Cavendish-Bentinck, third duke of Portland")</script>, whom she had known since at least 1763. It seems likely that the duchess hoped to marry Portland, and their relationship was known in society, but in June 1765 Portland announced his engagement to Lady Dorothy Cavendish without first informing the duchess, leading to her public humiliation. The duchess's desolation was accentuated by the loss of both her sons, as first Lord Charles and then Lord Euston were taken into Grafton's care during 1765. Walpole was one of the friends to whom she turned; while in Paris that autumn he met John Fitzpatrick, second earl of Upper Ossory (1745&#150;1818), and recommended him to the duchess.<br>
<br>The duchess and Lord Ossory were lovers by November 1767, when Walpole discussed with the duchess the possibility of her renting Marble Hill House following the death of his friend Henrietta, countess of Suffolk. In May 1768 Grafton (by then prime minister) forced the duchess to reject an invitation to officiate as chief mourner at the funeral of George III's sister Princess Louisa, eventually admitting to his colleagues that his estranged wife was pregnant by Lord Ossory. In June she moved to a house in Coombe, Surrey; in the following month Grafton took from the duchess their daughter Georgiana, the last of their children to live with her. The duchess's daughter Anne (<i>d</i>. 1841) was born on 23 August. Grafton then prosecuted the duchess for adultery. The duchess agreed not to counter with her own charge of adultery against the duke and to accept an allowance of &pound;2000 per annum. The duke and duchess were divorced by act of parliament on 23 March 1769; the duchess married Lord Ossory at Kingston church, Surrey, on 26 March.<br>
<br>Ossory's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9624/', "Richard Fitzpatrick")</script> gave the bride away, an act that revealed not just the urgent need to regularize the former duchess's social position but her parents' disapproval of her conduct. She reportedly regained the use of her marriage portion of &pound;40,000. Several of her friends thought a public life would be possible (despite the further complication when Grafton took Ossory's cousin Elizabeth Wrottesley as his second wife), but the new Lady Ossory preferred to avoid the risk of being snubbed in society and retired to Lord Ossory's homes at Ampthill, Bedfordshire, or Farming Woods, Northamptonshire. She came to London for the winter in order to provide her husband with a hostess when he needed to entertain his political allies, and with him paid regular visits to the country residences of relations and friends. The marriage was apparently successful, Walpole commenting in 1775 that it &#145;made two persons happier than Venus's son generally does&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 32.262). Her daughter Anne was initially placed with foster parents, but after the death of her daughter Mary (1770&#150;1771) and the miscarriage of twin sons in November 1771, was retrieved and brought up as a legitimate daughter, addressed as Lady Anne Fitzpatrick. The Ossorys later had a third daughter, Lady Gertrude Fitzpatrick (1774&#150;1841). Lady Ossory befriended her sister-in-law Mary, Lady Holland, but on Lady Holland's death in 1778 did not gain custody of any of her daughters, a fact celebrated by their great-aunt Lady Sarah Lennox, who referred to Lady Ossory's uneven temper and unkindness to one of the girls, Caroline Fox.<br>
<br>Lady Ossory and Walpole became regular correspondents in October 1769, probably after she heard that Walpole had been complimenting her in conversation. Only one of Lady Ossory's letters to Walpole survives, and details of her life are scant: &#145;today you are agent for Mr Ongley, and carrying a county election&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 32.209) could be facetious, but might suggest that she had a role in the election of her husband and Robert Henley Ongley as MPs for Bedfordshire in October 1774. About this time Ossory was nominated as British ambassador to Spain, an appointment that Walpole thought Lady Ossory welcomed as it would have allowed her a public life remote from the British &eacute;lite in London, but the duke of Grafton persuaded the prime minister, Lord North, to withdraw the invitation. When Ossory, who had previously voted with North's government, defected to the opposition and spoke in favour of Edmund Burke's bill for peace with the American colonies on 16 November 1775 Lady Ossory was accused of having persuaded him to change sides. The letters suggest that Lady Ossory pursued moderate arguments on the American question, occasionally reproving Walpole for a lack of patriotism, while opposing both the ministerial policies and American independence and at the same time supporting the colonists' right to take up arms, a middle course that Walpole ridiculed  (ibid., 33.305). In July 1782 she sent Charles James Fox a paragraph of Walpole's declaring &#145;Mr Fox the fittest man in England for prime minister&#146;  (ibid., 33.341). Despite rumours in the press the death of her father did not bring her the Liddell estates, but it did allow reconciliation with her mother. Lady Ossory's friendship with Walpole was complemented by the marriage of her son Lord Euston to Walpole's great-niece Lady Maria Waldegrave in November 1784, and it may have brought her some sense of justification that Grafton opposed the marriage, though she was pleased (for the sake of Euston's financial security) when Grafton relented after two months.<br>
<br>Lady Ossory's sense of humour was governed by the propriety that shaped her social relations: when in 1785 Walpole sent her a copy of Miss Hoare of Bath's naked parody of the fashionable female figure, <span class="italic">A Modern Venus</span>, Lady Ossory responded by returning her own drawing of the same distorted female form, but this time clothed. As Walpole aged the nature of their correspondence changed, as he was increasingly immobilized by gout and Lady Ossory's travels, such as her tour of Wales in 1790, assumed greater interest for him. The last letter Lady Ossory received from Walpole was sent on 15 January 1797, six weeks before his death.<br>
<br>Lady Ossory died on 24 February 1804 at her London home in Grosvenor Square, and was buried on 4 March at St James's Church, Grafton Underwood, Northamptonshire (a village that had been part of the Fitzpatrick estate until 1748). Her husband died on 1 February 1818; their daughters Anne and Gertrude inherited the Fitzpatrick estates in Ireland, but neither married.<br>
<br>Lady Ossory recognized that her abilities were overshadowed by others in her circle: &#145;Mr Walpole shall now entertain you, better than I could were I ever so lively&#146; she once wrote to Lady Holland  (before 1 July 1774, BL, Add. MS 51454, fol. 54). Her own attempts at wit in surviving correspondence are often self-conscious; it is telling that Walpole does not seem to have retained her letters to him. None the less, she displayed great tenacity and skill in successfully making three major transitions in her life: a provincial heiress (albeit with maternal metropolitan mercantile ancestry) from a family new to the peerage whose fortune was reliant on one commodity, became a duchess able to hold her own in fashionable society; she weathered the storm of her separation from Grafton, the loss of her children, and her affair with Portland to live independently in a critical beau monde; and after her divorce and remarriage she established herself in a respectable rural retirement, for all practical purposes reconciled to her exile from social life. Her contribution to posterity, however, was in her role as Walpole's muse for thoughts on social and domestic life, allowing him to express more sensitivity and reflection in his correspondence than he did in many other series of letters dominated by acerbic comments on political events.<br>
