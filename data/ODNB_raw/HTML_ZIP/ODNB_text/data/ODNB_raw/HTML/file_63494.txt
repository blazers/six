<span class="headword">Nichols family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1760&#150;1939), <span class="occ">printers and publishers</span>, editors of the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, and known especially for their books on local history and antiquarian scholarship, came to prominence in the late eighteenth century with the gifted <a name="cosubject_20118"></a><span class="headword">John Nichols</span>  (1745&#150;1826), <span class="occ">printer and writer</span>. Nichols was born on 2 February 1745 in Islington, Middlesex, the eldest of six children of Edward Nichols (1719&#150;1779), baker, and his wife, Anne (1719&#150;1783), daughter of Thomas Wilmot of Beckingham, Lincolnshire. Only John and his sister Anne survived to maturity. He was educated at John Shield's Academy for Young Gentlemen in Islington (<i>c</i>.1749&#150;1757). He was originally destined for a naval career but his uncle, Thomas Wilmot, an officer under the command of Admiral Barrington, who was to have preferred him, died in 1751, and so on leaving school Nichols joined the Bowyer printing office, founded in 1699, and was bound apprentice at Stationers' Hall, on 6 February 1759. His master, William Bowyer the younger, who had been educated at Cambridge and had, &#145;for more than half a century, stood unrivalled as a learned printer&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 3.269), set about furthering his new apprentice's education by setting him Latin exercises, accompanying him to scientific lectures, and introducing him to the authors whose works were passing through his press. Nichols had a retentive memory and was eager to learn; from his youth he was quick at everything: &#145;he read with rapidity &hellip; he spoke quickly, and that whether in the reciprocity of conversation or &hellip; in a set speech.&#146; He also wrote &#145;with great rapidity; but this, he used jocularly to allow, &hellip; did not tend to improve his hand&#146;  (Chalmers). He was soon placed in a position of trust, and in 1765 his master sent him to Cambridge to test his business acumen by trying to negotiate the purchase of a share in the management of the university press. The negotiations fell through, but Bowyer was impressed with how the young man handled the business. When he came out of his time on 4 March 1766 (he was freed at Stationers' Hall) Bowyer returned half the apprenticeship fee to his father, an accepted practice where an apprentice satisfied the conditions. Bowyer's partnership with his relative James Emonson had ended acrimoniously in 1760 and his only surviving son, Thomas, had rejected his father and the business; so on 7 April 1766 Bowyer took Nichols into partnership, and in 1767 they moved from the cramped quarters in Whitefriars to larger premises in Red Lion Passage, Fleet Street. <br>
<br>At St Giles-in-the-Fields, Westminster, on 22 June 1766 Nichols married Anne (1737&#150;1776), daughter of William Cradock of Leicester, with whom he had three children. Only two, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1815), who married the antiquary and architect <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22780/', "John Pridden")</script>, and Sarah, lived to maturity. His wife died in childbirth on 18 February 1776, and on 11 June 1778 Nichols remarried at St Mary's, Hinckley, Leicestershire. His second wife was Martha (1756&#150;1788), daughter of William Green of Hinckley, with whom he had seven children. Bishop Thomas Percy was godfather to a son who died young; a second son, <a href="#cosubject_20119">John Bowyer Nichols [<i>see below</i>]</a>, later succeeded his father in the business; and four daughters also survived. <br>
<br>William Bowyer died in 1777 and Nichols, his executor, became proprietor of one the largest printing houses in London. They had printed the House of Commons <span class="italic">Votes</span> or agenda papers since 1729, and in 1767 they were appointed printers of the House of Lords <span class="italic">Journals</span>. For many years they were printers to the Society of Antiquaries and the Royal Society but both commissions were lost at the end of the century; the Antiquaries, for whom they had printed from 1736, grew dissatisfied with the Nichols press and in 1798 moved to the cheaper and more fashionable press of William Bensley. Likewise the Royal Society, for whom the firm had printed since 1761, transferred to the &#145;fine&#146; printer William Bulmer in 1791. But these were rare failures. In 1773 the government commissioned the Bowyer press to print a type facsimile of the <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>. Nichols designed the type and saw the work through the press during the ten years it took to produce. &#145;On the correctness and beauty of this important work I am content to stake my typographical credit,&#146; Nichols wrote  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 2.265); it is still considered remarkably accurate and complete. <br>
<br>In June 1778 Nichols purchased a share in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> from the sister of its founder, Edward Cave. At first he had half the printing and all the folding and stitching of each issue, but in 1780 he became sole printer and took over much of the editorial responsibility from Cave's brother-in-law, David Henry, who owned the remaining shares; shortly before his death in 1792 Henry surrendered the entire editorial control to Nichols. This put him in a very strong position: the lucrative and prestigious <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> was a key component of the Nichols press, which kept tight control of its editorial policy and production until the family sold the property to J. H. Parker of Oxford in 1856. <br>
<br>It might be said of Nichols, as Dr Johnson said of Cave, that &#145;he never looked out of the window but with a view to the <span class="roman">Gentleman's Magazine</span>&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>). His editorial guidance of the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> is manifest throughout the years of his proprietorship. His first action on taking control was to double its size; Richard Gough had been reviews editor from 1786, and Nichols now printed longer reviews, as well as giving space to literary and antiquarian contributions from readers. He gave more prominence to the obituary columns and was indefatigable in his search for data, which he encouraged his readers to check. He was fascinated by biographical facts and anecdotes and he got his readers to produce information for both the <span class="italic">Magazine</span> and his other writings. His method was to question the accuracy of his contributors in footnotes, introducing topics he was interested in under a variety of pseudonyms and then correcting his own mistakes and eliciting further information in footnotes to footnotes. By 1794 this section had become what Nichols proudly called &#145;a body of biography&#146;. John Wolcot, writing under the pseudonym Peter Pindar, might satirize &#145;John Nichols, the death hunter&#146;, but scholars ever since have owed him an incalculable debt. The contributors to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> lifted whole phrases and paragraphs from Nichols for inclusion in their biographical articles and the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> is given as a source some 7000 times. <br>
<br>Nichols's reputation as an editor, biographer, and antiquary grew with the expansion of his printing business and was inextricably linked to it. As a youth he was always scribbling poetry and with William Bowyer's encouragement he published two slim volumes, <span class="italic">The Buds of Parnassus</span> and <span class="italic">Islington</span>, in 1763. His first important editorial work was a supplementary volume to the works of Jonathan Swift in 1775 which formed volume 17 of the trade edition of Swift's works and contained an index to the whole. Further supplementary volumes followed in 1776 and 1779. This led him to a general interest in the editorial process and by a study of the work of earlier Swift editors and a close reading of the <span class="italic">Journal to Stella</span> Nichols was able to improve the accuracy and orderliness of Swift's original texts. The list of missing works which he added to his supplement of 1779 impressed Edmond Malone and is still useful today. His interest in Hogarth derived from Bowyer's association with the artist, while Nichols's biography exemplifies his editorial and scholarly method, only affordable by an author who was his own printer. Volume 4 of Walpole's <span class="italic">Anecdotes of Painting in England</span> (1780) had stimulated public interest in Hogarth. In the following year Nichols published, with the assistance of George Steevens and Isaac Reed, <span class="italic">Biographical anecdotes of Mr Hogarth, and a catalogue of his works, with occasional remarks</span> (1781), followed by enlarged editions in 1782 and 1785. Even the critical Walpole praised the work. The fourth edition, <span class="italic">Biographical Anecdotes of William Hogarth</span> (1810), &#145;in two handsome quarto volumes, illustrated with 160 beautiful plates&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 3.9n.), remains a key work. <br>
<br>William Bowyer's proposal in 1764 to add to Tonson's edition of <span class="italic">The Tatler</span> and <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> turned Nichols's attention to the works of Steele, and between 1789 and 1797 he printed a number of Steele's periodicals, both on his own and jointly with a consortium of other booksellers. He bought a number of Steele's letters for his edition of the <span class="italic">Correspondence of Sir Richard Steele</span> (1797) which he later donated to the British Museum. <br>
<br>Nichols made extensive use of the papers of George Hardinge and the elder and younger Samuel Pegge, culminating in a new, enlarged edition of the younger Pegge's <span class="italic">Curialia</span> in 1806 and of the <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works in Prose and Verse of George Hardinge</span> in 1818. Among Nichols's other edited works are <span class="italic">Letters on Various Subjects to and from William Nicholson</span> (1809), Samuel Pegge's <span class="italic">Anonymania</span> (1809), and a new edition, with the assistance of Malone, of Fuller's <span class="italic">History of the Worthies of England</span> (1811). <br>
<br>Nichols was an avid collector of literary manuscripts, which he then edited and printed. His wide circle of friends, readers, and contributors had confidence in his integrity and judgement and he was thus enabled to get hold of manuscript material for the obituary pages of the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> which might not have been entrusted to other publishers. He also bought heavily at sales and, as literary executor of William Bowyer, George Hardinge, and Samuel Pegge, acquired further collections. His editing of one group of documents might lead to the donation of related material which he would incorporate in further, enlarged editions. <span class="italic">The Epistolary Correspondence of Francis Atterbury</span> (1783) is a case in point; it originated in the purchase of a single manuscript which he enlarged by transcribing the bishop's letters in the British Museum and then published. This produced further original material from Atterbury's relations and other &#145;sources of equal authenticity&#146; which culminated in a five-volume edition of Atterbury's letters in 1799. <br>
<br>For Nichols, work and social life were one and the same thing, and many of those for whom he printed, often inherited from Bowyer, became his friends and helped him in his publishing projects. His method was to assess the market for a work while he pursued his own &#145;harmless pleasure&#146; of editing the works of lesser known authors. Such was the case with the <span class="italic">Original Works of William King</span> which he edited in 1776; he followed this up by printing a <span class="italic">Select Collection of Miscellaneous Poems</span>, which he edited between 1780 and 1782 with the assistance of Joseph Warton and bishops Percy and Lowth. It contained biographical notices of over 150 persons and was intended to supplement the poetical collections of James Dodsley, George Pearch, and Samuel Johnson. He printed Johnson's <span class="italic">Lives of the English Poets</span>, for which he contributed biographical details, and was drawn into Johnson's circle and joined his convivial <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/71336', "Essex Head Club")</script>, founded in 1783. Nichols gave Boswell material for the <span class="italic">Life of Johnson</span> and subsequently donated his correspondence with Johnson to the British Museum. <br>
<br>Nichols's love of antiquarianism, encouraged by Bowyer, cannot be dissociated from his career as a printer and editor. He was passionately concerned with disseminating historical source material which might otherwise be lost. The Bowyer&#150;Nichols press was at the heart of the output of monumental county histories. It was through printing the first edition of John Hutchins's <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of Dorset</span>, which Nichols saw through the press between 1770 and 1774, that he first met Richard Gough, a pioneer local historian. Gough was quick to see Nichols as an ally in his plan to publicize the antiquities of Britain, and Nichols became his closest friend. During twenty years they travelled through England visiting sites of historic interest, and collaborating on many projects, of which the most ambitious was the <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica</span>, which appeared in fifty-two numbers between 1780 and 1790. The highly successful <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Antiquities</span> followed (1791&#150;1800), with Gough the chief contributor. Its opening number was a series of questions seeking information from lovers of antiquities; then came Edward Rowe Mores's <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of Tunstall in Kent</span>, which proved that a scholarly local study could have more than local appeal. Nichols drew on manuscripts in his hands or on his own historical research for other titles in the series. Gough contributed a seminal article on &#145;the progress of sale catalogues&#146; to volume 3 of the <span class="italic">Literary Anecdotes</span> and Nichols one of the first attempts at a history of the Stationers' Company to the same volume. Nichols felt keenly Gough's death in 1809. As his executor he oversaw Gough's bequest of his enormous collections of local history to the Bodleian Library. Nichols worked with other antiquaries such as William Cole of Milton and A. C. Ducarel, who provided Nichols with material for his work <span class="italic">Royal Wills</span> and for the &#145;History and antiquities of Lambeth parish&#146; in <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica</span>, 39 (1786), which drew on Ducarel's histories of the archbishop's palaces of Croydon and Lambeth. <br>
<br>Nichols's reputation as an antiquary and county historian rests principally on <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of the County of Leicester</span>. He had family connections with Leicestershire and visited there regularly. This gave him a special interest in that county, while, as a Londoner, he could remain detached. In printing county histories of Dorset, Worcestershire, and Cornwall, he had learned how to arrange the material which he collected assiduously over many years, using his contacts through the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> to assemble a team of over 100 writers whose work he combined with research of his own and the unpublished manuscript histories of Leicestershire by William Burton, Francis Peck, and Richard Farmer. He was at pains to include documents of county-wide interest, ranging from his own extracts from <span class="roman">Domesday</span> to more recent government statistics, which provided points of comparison between different parishes. His novel method of illustrating the work derived from his experience as a printer; by using a border of coats of arms round views of buildings, sculptures, and artefacts his plates provided his readers with virtually a printed county museum. Nichols had begun characteristically with a series of fifty-two short studies printed in the <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica</span> (1780&#150;90), which gradually grew into a multi-volume work in spite of the loss of much material in the fire at his printing house in 1808, which cost Nichols at least &pound;5000. He saw the work as his most important; it has not been superseded and remains one of the best county histories. <br>
<br>It is as chronicler of the book trade that Nichols is pre-eminent. His interest in printing history began when he and Bowyer edited the <span class="italic">Origin of Printing, in Two Essays</span> by Conyers Middleton and Gerard Meerman (1774); a supplement by A. C. Ducarel was added in 1781. In the same year came <span class="italic">The biographical memoirs of William Ged, including a particular account of his progress in the art of block printing</span> (1781). A peak year for Nichols was 1778, when he purchased the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>; published Edward Rowes Mores's <span class="italic">Dissertation of Type Founders and Type Founderies</span>, having bought the manuscript and blocks at Mores's posthumous sale; and, as a private tribute to his master and partner, published a fifty-two-page pamphlet in an edition of twenty copies, <span class="italic">The Anecdotes, Biographical and Literary of the Late Mr William Bowyer</span>. This he enlarged as <span class="italic">Biographical and Literary Anecdotes of William Bowyer, Printer &hellip; and Many of his Learned Friends</span> (1782). Nichols considered it the first edition of what in the course of thirty-four years grew to be the monumental <span class="italic">Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century</span> (9 vols., 1812&#150;15) and <span class="italic">Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth Century</span> (8 vols., 1817&#150;58), of which four volumes came out in his lifetime and the rest were completed by his son and grandson. He used the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> to elicit new material, asking his readers, usually under a pseudonym, for information, and by this means assembled a wealth of anecdote and biography incorporating letters and data as they came to hand. At times the reader is overwhelmed with a mass of footnotes and footnotes to footnotes; and Walpole, while praising Nichols's meticulousness, waspishly wished that &#145;he would not dub so many <i>great</i>. I have known several of his heroes, who were very little men&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 8.259). Taken together, however, these two works remain Nichols's most enduring monument. <br>
<br>Nichols was active in the Stationers' Company throughout his career, reaching the &#145;summit of his ambition&#146; when he was made master in 1804. He was well known in the trade and, as owner of one the major printing houses engaged in official printing, was deeply involved in negotiating rates of pay and conditions during the unrest in the trade after 1785. He was also involved in many charities; in 1786 he helped to get a monument erected to John Howard in St Paul's Cathedral, and in 1793 he helped to get land purchased for a sea-bathing infirmary for &#145;scrophulous diseases&#146; at Margate, Kent. He was a registrar of the Royal Literary Fund and was involved in the foundation of the Royal Humane Society, on both of whose committees his son later represented him; he subscribed to local charities in St Bride's, in the City of London, and in his native village of Islington, Middlesex. He was elected an honorary member of the Society of Antiquaries of Edinburgh in 1781 and of Perth in 1785. In 1810 he was admitted a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. <br>
<br>On 8 January 1807 Nichols fell and fractured his thigh, and in the following year, on 8 February, the printing office and warehouse in Red Lion Passage were destroyed by fire with the loss of some &pound;30,000, of which &pound;10,000 was uninsured. The entire book stock in the warehouse was consumed, including all the numbers of the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> dating back to 1783. It says much for Nichols's fortitude and his standing in the trade that at the age of sixty-three and with the help of his son, John Bowyer Nichols, he was able to recover his business and continue his numerous personal printing enterprises. Many, including Luke Hansard, offered him the use of their presses until he could find new premises. He had moved back to Islington in 1803, intending to pursue his own writing interests, but his letters to his son show that he retained control of the firm and its routine business, continuing to check proofs and liaise with other members of the book trade to the end. <br>
<br>Portraits of Nichols in later life depict a short, amiable man, inclined to stoutness. He possessed, however, immense energy and a powerful memory. In private life he was popular and convivial. Boswell once described him as &#145;joyous to a pitch of bacchanalian vivacity&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Yale Edition of the Private Papers of James Boswell</span>, vol. 4, 1986, 412). According to Hart he was the &#145;archetype of the successful industrious apprentice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Minor Lives</span>, xx) who became master of a flourishing printing house and was known and liked by most of the leading literary and antiquarian figures of the day. Walpole admired his modesty and intelligence and to Gibbon he was &#145;the last, or one of the last of the learned printers in Europe&#146;  (Edward Gibbon to John Nichols, 24 Feb 1792; Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 8.557). His printing office became a focus: many correspondents who met there left manuscripts to be called for. As well as editing over 150 works by other men he contributed innumerable articles to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> and wrote works containing more biographical information than all his contemporaries combined. Behind his works lay his belief that &#145;every book should contain within itself its necessary explanation&#146;  (Kuist, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 19), thus saving the reader the trouble of referring elsewhere. He died on 26 November 1826 at his home in Highbury Place, Islington, and was buried on 5 December in the churchyard of St Mary's, Islington. <br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_20119"></a><span class="headword">John Bowyer Nichols</span>  (1779&#150;1863), <span class="occ">printer and antiquary</span>, was born on 15 July 1779 in Red Lion Passage, Fleet Street, London, only son among the five surviving children of John Nichols and his second wife, Martha Green. His childhood was spent largely with his maternal grandfather and his great-uncle, William Iliffe, at Hinckley. From about 1784 to 1790 he was taught by the Revd William Brown at Stoke Golding, Leicestershire, and moved to St Paul's School, London, on 9 October 1790. His father bound him apprentice on 6 August 1793 while he was still at school; on leaving school in September 1796 he entered his father's printing office. On 5 August 1800 he was freed at Stationers' Hall and was made a partner in the family business. He married, at St Bride's, Fleet Street, London, on 6 June 1805, Eliza (1784&#150;1846), daughter of John Baker, apothecary of Camberwell, Surrey, with whom he had fourteen children; three sons and five daughters survived. <br>
<br>J. B. Nichols started to represent his father in business in 1802. He continued to live at Red Lion Passage after his father moved to Islington, but between 1808 and 1811 he and his family found accommodation in Thavies Inn while the fire-damaged print rooms and warehouse were refurbished and the presses were moved into their living quarters above the printing office. He took an active part in managing the printing business and in producing the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. William Bray, who completed Owen Manning's <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of Surrey</span>, praised Nichols's &#145;attention and accuracy&#146; in revising proof sheets to the second volume in 1809  (Manning and Bray, <span class="italic">Surrey</span>, vol. 2). Between 1811 and 1815 he and his father edited volumes 3 and 4 of the second edition of William Hutchins's <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of Dorset</span>, the entire stock of volumes 1 and 2, as well as part of volume 3 which was unpublished, having perished in the warehouse fire. The firm continued the Bowyer press tradition of publishing county histories, useful experience for a budding antiquary. J. B. Nichols printed most of the major early nineteenth-century works in the field, in which he was personally interested as an antiquary and on which he lavished his typographical skill. Samuel Bentley, J. B. Nichols's cousin, joined the firm between 1812 and 1818. In 1819 the younger man oversaw a move from the premises in Red Lion Passage to 25 Parliament Street, Westminster, where the press was more conveniently situated for printing the House of Commons <span class="italic">Votes</span>, which was night work and always required with urgency. <br>
<br>When his father died in 1826 J. B. Nichols became sole owner of the printing house. The Nicholses had been reappointed printers to the Society of Antiquaries in 1821 and J. B. Nichols inherited lucrative printing contracts for the <span class="italic">Votes</span> and the <span class="italic">Journals</span> of the Lords. He was held in high regard for his honourable dealings and mild manner, but this did not protect him from attack during the select committees on printing for the Commons of 1828 and 1833. Luke Graves Hansard lamented his &#145;lack of judicious explanation&#146;  (Ford and Ford, 38) when the committee questioned him about his methods and high cost of printing. <br>
<br>J. B. Nichols was closely associated all his working life with editing and printing the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. In 1833 he purchased the remaining shares from the descendants of Edward Cave and David Henry and in the following year transferred a portion of the property to William Pickering, publisher, of Piccadilly. A new series was begun under an editorial team which included John Mitford, Sir Frederick Madden, J. T. Mansel, John Bruce, and A. J. Kempe, but J. B. Nichols and his son <a href="#cosubject_20120">John Gough Nichols [<i>see below</i>]</a> retained ultimate control. In 1850 J. B. Nichols bought back Pickering's share and in 1856 sold the entire property to J. H. Parker of Oxford. <br>
<br>Contemporaries compared J. B. Nichols's industry to the editorial energy of his father. He took over many of his father's literary works and those of his father's friends. He shared his father's interest in the history of the book trade and in 1818 edited <span class="italic">The Life and Errors of John Dunton</span>, to which he added an index. From 1825 he helped his father edit and print Joseph Cradock's <span class="italic">Literary and Miscellaneous Memoirs</span>, and after Cradock's death in 1826 completed volumes 3 and 4. Hansard told him: &#145;you have added to their interest by the beauty of your typography&#146;  (letter to J. B. Nichols, 15 Jan 1828). Cradock was godfather to Nichols's second son, Robert Cradock Nichols (1824&#150;1892), and Nichols was one of Cradock's executors. In 1828 J. B. Nichols completed the fifth volume of the <span class="italic">Literary Illustrations</span>, which had been left unfinished at John Nichols's death in 1826. Drawing on his father's and Richard Gough's large accumulation of family and business papers, J. B. Nichols edited three further volumes in 1831, 1848, and 1858. He made use of his father's <span class="italic">Biographical Anecdotes of Mr Hogarth</span> (1781) to compile his <span class="italic">Anecdotes of William Hogarth</span> (1833) and his own collection of paintings contained several works by the artist. <br>
<br>J. B. Nichols was an active and popular antiquary. In 1818 he was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and he frequently spoke and exhibited at their meetings. From 1829 he was an original member of the Noviomagians, the Antiquaries' select and convivial dining club. He regularly hosted their feasts and held amateur dramatics at his home. In 1819, during a brief appointment as printer to the corporation of London, he published <span class="italic">A Brief Account of the Guildhall of the City of London</span>; he revised and brought up to date Ducarel's <span class="italic">Account of the Royal Hospital and Collegiate Church of St Katharine, near the Tower</span> (1824). His <span class="italic">Historical Notices of Fonthill Abbey, Wiltshire</span> (1836), compiled from the earlier works of his lifelong friend John Britton and of John Rutter, brought the history of that abbey down to the time of its destruction. Two years later he compiled <span class="italic">Illustrations of Her Majesty's Palace at Brighton, Formerly the Pavilion</span>, which included a description of the palace by E. W. Brayley. On the death in 1833 of J. T. Smith, keeper of prints at the British Museum, Nichols purchased a series of unpublished etchings which Smith had prepared for a continuation of <span class="italic">Vagabondiana</span>. He included a memoir of Smith in the collection of <span class="italic">The Cries of London</span>, which he edited with the assistance of Francis Douce in 1838. He became a friend of Sir Richard Colt Hoare through printing his <span class="italic">Wiltshire</span> and other of his works and was a frequent visitor at Stourhead. His catalogue of the Stourhead library was privately printed in 1840 and formed the basis of a lecture on the history and contents of the library delivered on his behalf to the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society in 1854. In 1843 he edited a second edition of Richard Yates's <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of the Abbey of St Edmunds Bury</span>. <br>
<br>J. B. Nichols kept detailed journals of the many tours of Britain and Europe he made throughout his life, visiting places of historic or printing interest, and he encouraged other members of his family to do the same. After the death of John Nichols, Dawson Turner approached J. B. Nichols with a view to purchasing the papers and letters accumulated by his father as editor of the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">Literary Anecdotes</span>, and other of his works. Nichols refused the offer and over the years collected and had bound as &#145;Family records&#146; thousands of letters and associated ephemera which he identified and annotated. He was, in effect, the family archivist, and the large collections of Nichols papers now scattered among public repositories and private collections would not have survived without his assiduity and care. In addition he accumulated a large library of history and topography which included thousands of illustrations, rubbings, and maps arranged by county in portfolios, which John Britton, John Adey Repton, and Maria Hackett used in their research, and he formed an important collection of artefacts ranging from Norman Romanesque sculpture to a Renaissance chimney-piece from Theobalds, Hertfordshire, which had belonged to Richard Gough. <br>
<br>J. B. Nichols followed in his father's footsteps in being involved in good works and learned societies. He continued to serve on the committees of the Margate Infirmary, the Royal Literary Fund, and the Royal Humane Society. He filled various public offices in Westminster and Hammersmith. He was an original member of the Camden Society, whose proceedings he printed, and he also belonged to the Archaeological Institute, the Numismatic Society, the Royal Society of Literature, the Athenaeum Club, and the Linnean, the Zoological, and the Horticultural societies. J. B. Nichols was called to the court of the Stationers' Company in 1840 and was master of the company in 1850. <br>
<br>In later life J. B. Nichols went blind and was cared for by his eldest daughter, Mary, who was his amanuensis and helped him in assembling the family archive. She was an exhibiting artist and amateur photographer in her own right. He died at his home at Hanger Hill, Ealing, Middlesex, on 19 October 1863 and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery on 24 October. <br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_20120"></a><span class="headword">John Gough Nichols</span>  (1806&#150;1873), <span class="occ">printer and antiquary</span>, was born on 22 May 1806 at Red Lion Passage, Fleet Street, London, the eldest son of John Bowyer Nichols and his wife, Eliza. Richard Gough was his godfather. J. G. Nichols received his earliest education at the school of Miss Roper in Islington, Middlesex, and was then educated by Dr Waite in Lewisham, Kent, from 1814 to 1816; in January 1817 he was sent to the Merchant Taylors' School, London, which he left in 1824 to join the family printing firm in Parliament Street, Westminster. On 22 July 1843 at Chiswick, Middlesex, he married Lucy (1821&#150;1907), eldest daughter of Commander Frederick Lewis RN of Chiswick, with whom he had three children, of whom a son and a daughter survived. <br>
<br>Like his father and grandfather before him, J. G. Nichols took an active part in running the printing office with its contracts with the government and learned societies. He continued the close association with the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, which he helped to edit from 1826; he continued to have ultimate managerial control over it after the responsibility was shared out between 1834 and 1850. He was sole editor from 1850 until it was sold in 1856, when he continued to be a contributor. Well aware of the importance of the obituary columns, he strove to promote them all his life, and wrote numerous obituary articles. When away from home he combed the local papers for biographical details likely to have been missed by the London papers. He was founding editor of the <span class="italic">Collectanea Topographica et Genealogica</span> (1834&#150;43), the <span class="italic">Topographer and Genealogist</span> (1846&#150;58), the <span class="italic">Herald and Genealogist</span> (1863&#150;74), and the <span class="italic">Register and Magazine of Biography</span> (1869). In all these he sought to print, preserve, and make accessible original sources of interest to local historians. <br>
<br>J. G. Nichols's enthusiasm for antiquities began in childhood. He attended meetings of the Society of Antiquaries with his father from the age of twelve and was a skilled palaeographer by the time he left school. In 1826 he assisted his grandfather with the <span class="italic">Progresses of James I</span> and he completed it (1828) after the latter's death. His first separate publication, <span class="italic">Autographs of Royal, Noble, Learned and Remarkable Personages</span> (1829), which contains extracts from more than 600 manuscript letters, did much to stimulate contemporary interest in autograph collecting and is still of scholarly interest today. <br>
<br>J. G. Nichols shared the family interest in county history. He assisted W. L. Bowles in the <span class="italic">Annals and Antiquities of Lacock Abbey</span> (1834) and in 1837 he contributed an account of &#145;The hundred of Alderbury&#146; to Colt Hoare's <span class="italic">History of Modern Wiltshire</span>. He printed the third edition, edited by Shipp and Hodson, of Hutchins's <span class="italic">History of Dorset</span> (4 vols., 1861&#150;74); he was at work on the second edition of T. D. Whitaker's <span class="italic">History of Whalley</span> (2 vols., 1872&#150;6) when he died. While researching his pioneering study <span class="italic">Examples of Decorative Tiles, Sometimes termed Encaustic</span> (1841&#150;5) J. G. Nichols corresponded with architects and china manufacturers such as Minton. His work provided an important link between archaeologists and clergymen wishing to restore their churches and was influential in reviving the art of tile making for contemporary church decoration. <br>
<br>J. G. Nichols was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1835. Among his many contributions to <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> may be noted his comments on the work of Holbein after the discovery of his will in 1862. He was a member of the committee which considered the authenticity of the Paston letters in 1865. He was an honorary fellow of the societies of Antiquaries of Newcastle and of Scotland and corresponding fellow of both the Massachusetts History Society and the New England Genealogical Society. He visited his friend Robert Surtees in 1830, and helped to found the Surtees Society in 1834. He also helped to found the Camden Society (1838), the Archaeological Institute (1844), and the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society (1855). He was a member of the Numismatic Society, the Surrey Archaeological Society, and the Shakespeare Society. He was a prolific contributor to all their publications. His editions of the <span class="italic">Chronicle of Calais in the Reigns of Henry VII and Henry VIII</span> (CS, 35), <span class="italic">The Diary of Henry Machin, 1550&#150;63</span> (CS, 42), and <span class="italic">The Narratives of the Days of the Reformation chiefly from the Manuscripts of John Fox</span> (CS, 77) were among some eighteen contributions made to the society's publications. He compiled a <span class="italic">Descriptive Catalogue</span> of the society's works (1862). For the Roxburghe Club he edited <span class="italic">Literary Remains of Edward VI</span> (1857&#150;8), <span class="italic">The Boke of Noblesse addressed to Edward IV, 1475</span> (1860), and <span class="italic">The Legend of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton</span> (1874). <br>
<br>The Nicholses were close friends of the Herrick family, and between 1843 and 1862 J. G. Nichols arranged their family estate and personal papers, manorial rolls, and exchequer records, 1616&#150;23, housed at Beaumanor Park, Leicestershire. The official warrants alone comprised 2300 documents, which Nichols had bound in sixteen volumes. <br>
<br>J. G. Nichols represented the firm in Liverpool in 1823, when he visited Matthew Gregson. He travelled widely in Britain and on the continent; he toured the north of England and Scotland in 1830, visited Gloucester in 1832, when he stayed with T. D. Fosbroke, made numerous tours of Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Wiltshire, and Leicestershire in the course of his research, and toured Germany with John Rivington in 1841 and Ireland in 1853. He made several visits to France. He was elected to the general committee of the Royal Literary Fund in 1836 and was a trustee of the Printers' Pension Corporation from 1845. For many years he was a director of the York Buildings Waterworks Company, latterly serving as its chairman and director. He was also a governor of the Grey Coat and Blue Coat schools, Westminster. He was called to the court of the Stationers' Company in 1865 and was under-warden of the company at the time of his death. <br>
<br>John Gough Nichols, like his father and grandfather before him, spent a lifetime as a working printer and proprietor of one of London's major printing offices, but he is best-known as a compiler, editor, author, and printer of archaeological and heraldic works. He died of cancer at his home, Holmwood Park, Dorking, Surrey, on 14 November 1873 and was buried on 19 November at the east end of Holmwood church. <br>
<br>The printing business remained in the Nichols family's hands after the death of J. G. Nichols. Initially it was managed by his son, John Bruce Nichols (1848&#150;1929), in partnership with his uncle, Robert Cradock Nichols (1824&#150;1892), but from 1898 until his death in 1929 he was joined by his own son, John Cradock Morgan Nichols (1876&#150;1962). In 1897 the firm moved from Parliament Street to larger premises in Orchard Street. In 1930 the business became a private limited company known as J. B. Nichols &amp; Sons Ltd, with John Cradock Morgan Nichols at the helm. In addition to its parliamentary contracts the company also printed for the houses of the convocation of Canterbury, the national assembly of the Church of England, Harrow School, the Royal College of Music, and the Surveyor's Institution. The company ceased trading in December 1939 and much of its parliamentary work was absorbed by the Stationery Office.<br>
