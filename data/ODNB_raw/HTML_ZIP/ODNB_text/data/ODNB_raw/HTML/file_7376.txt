<span class="headword">Dayes,  Edward</span>  (1763&#150;1804), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was born on 6 August 1763 in London. He was apprenticed to the mezzotinter and miniaturist William Pether and entered the Royal Academy Schools on 6 October 1780. He made his d&eacute;but at the academy in 1786, showing in the next few years a mixture of portraits, miniatures, topographical watercolours, and figure subjects, which set the tone for a wide-ranging career encompassing different media and subject types. In all Dayes showed sixty-four works at the Royal Academy, although he was unsuccessful as a candidate for associate membership. He also exhibited at the Society of Artists in 1790 and 1791, and was appointed draughtsman to the duke of York about 1791.<br>
<br>Dayes's work as a miniaturist was confined to the early part of his career and it was as a topographical watercolourist that he made his name. Many of his watercolours were modest in scale and were produced for the print trade. Eleven plates after his works were engraved for the <span class="italic">Copper Plate Magazine</span> between 1794 and 1797, and he contributed more than forty scenes for John Aikin's <span class="italic">Description of the Country from Thirty to Forty Miles Round Manchester</span> (1795). However, he also provided more ambitious compositions for <span class="italic">Views on the River Wye</span> (published by E. Dayes and F. Dukes, 1797&#150;1802), which consisted of sixteen sepia aquatints, while the four watercolours of Oxford scenes for the <span class="italic">Oxford Almanack</span>, dated 1794 (AM Oxf.), showed that he could exceed the limited brief of architectural publications. Dayes also produced watercolours from the drawings of a number of amateurs. He was commissioned, in 1790, by Lord Stanley to realize views of his trip, in 1789, to Iceland, and he was employed by James Moore to paint watercolours after his drawings of antiquarian subjects; many of these were published in <span class="italic">Twenty Five Views in the Southern Part of Scotland</span> (1794). Dayes also specialized in producing small-scale watercolours for patrons such as the Wynn family, of Nostell Priory, selling them for a few shillings only. Such works were often carelessly produced, reusing compositions and employing a limited palette of greys and blues, with a little rapid pen work.<br>
<br>At his best, however, in views of the Lake District, such as <span class="italic">Haweswater</span> (1795; Whitworth Art Gallery), or of architectural subjects, such as <span class="italic">Ely Cathedral</span> (1792; V&amp;A), Dayes united carefully balanced compositions with a lucid, luminous style of painting. During the mid-1790s such works proved highly influential with a new generation of watercolourists, including his pupil Thomas Girtin (apprenticed in 1789) and J. M. W. Turner. Before they broke away to develop the potential of the medium in ways unimagined by Dayes, these two artists produced works which are sometimes indistinguishable from his. Dayes's <span class="italic">Instructions for Drawing and Colouring Landscapes</span> (1805) suggests that despite a difficult personality&#151;which damaged his relationship with Girtin&#151;he was an innovative thinker on professional practice and on the teaching of watercolour techniques, including sketching in colours from nature.<br>
<br>Dayes was also an elegant figure draughtsman, his talent being most apparent in the architectural subjects that he executed for publishers. The fashionably dressed figures in scenes such as <span class="italic">Buckingham House, St. James's Park</span> (1790; V&amp;A, published 1793) or <span class="italic">Queen's Square</span> (exh. 1787; Yale U. CBA), one of four views of modern London squares which were published in 1787 and 1789, went far beyond the standard staffage of contemporary watercolourists. Dayes also employed his talents in a number of large-scale watercolours of contemporary events, often with a patriotic theme, which were aimed at the print market. Among the most impressive was <span class="italic">View of the choir of St. Paul's on the day of solemn thanksgiving for the recovery of his majesty, 23 April 1789</span> (engraved by R. Pollard). Dayes also continued to work occasionally as a mezzotinter and produced two plates, in 1788, after George Morland, <span class="italic">Juvenile Navigation</span> and <span class="italic">Children Nutting</span>, and, in 1790, <span class="italic">A Visit to the Grandfather</span>, after a work by John Raphael Smith.<br>
<br>Dayes illustrated a number of literary texts, including scenes for Bell's <span class="italic">British Theatre</span>, but these did not satisfy his ambitions as a history painter, and from 1798 he spent an increasing amount of his time painting scenes from the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and from the works of Dryden and Milton. His diary for 1798 gives a detailed account of his work on four watercolours, including the striking image of <span class="italic">The Fall of the Angels</span> (exh. RA, 1798; Tate collection). This work attracted some reviews, albeit mixed, but later works&#151;some in oils&#151;went unnoticed, and there is no evidence that he either attracted sales or succeeded in transforming his status. The extent of Dayes's ambitions was underlined in his theoretical &#145;Essays on painting&#146;, published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span> for 1801&#150;2, which stressed the importance of the artist's moral role as a teacher. Landscape painting, he urged, must be governed by the intellectual process of selection rather than the mere imitation of nature; his attacks on the landscape of &#145;effects&#146; marked him out as an opponent of the new generation of artists.<br>
<br>Dayes's last years were marked by a mounting sense of professional failure. He turned more to oils, producing unconvincing works, such as the <span class="italic">View of Welshpool</span> (1803; exh. Sothebys, 1987) and his one-person exhibition in 1801 seems to have attracted no attention. His 1798 diary underlines the precarious nature of his career, which in that year combined the production of historical watercolours with work for Thomas Barker on the production of a panorama, while earning small sums for colouring prints, painting landscape backgrounds for architectural drawings, and teaching. The unstable state of Dayes's mind is sadly apparent in his account of a <span class="italic">Tour in Yorkshire and Derbyshire</span> (of 1803), which displays a religious mind, deeply affected by nature but also prone to violent shifts in mood. Dayes committed suicide, in London, late in May 1804. His writings, including the often acerbic <span class="italic">Professional Sketches of Modern Artists</span>, were collected and edited by E. W. Brayley and were published in 1805 for the benefit of his widow, a miniaturist who exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1797 to 1800, but of whom no further details are known.<br>
