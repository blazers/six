<span class="headword">Jones, Sir  Eric Malcolm</span>  (1907&#150;1986), <span class="occ">intelligence officer and administrator</span>, was born on 27 April 1907 in Buxton, Derbyshire, the third in the family of four sons and one daughter of Samuel Jones, who ran the family business of Samuel Jones &amp; Son, textile manufacturers, of Macclesfield, Cheshire, and his wife, Minnie Florence Grove, of Buxton. Jones went to King's School, Macclesfield, and left at the age of fifteen to join the business in Manchester. In 1925 he set up on his own, and built up a large textile agency. In 1929 he married Edith Mary (Meg) Taylor (1904&#150;1984), daughter of Sir Thomas Taylor, silk merchant, of Macclesfield. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>In 1940 Jones handed over his business to a manager in order to enlist in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. He was posted to the Air Ministry intelligence branch. In 1942, as squadron leader, he was sent to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park to stand in temporarily for the senior RAF officer in Hut 3, which housed the group responsible for the analysis and dissemination of the deciphered German Enigma messages to the ministries and principal commands. So impressive was he to Edward Travis, director of the Government Code and Cypher School (later the government communications headquarters, or GCHQ), that in April 1943, when Travis decided that a formal head of Hut 3 was needed, he asked the RAF for Jones, who was then posted to Bletchley as head of Hut 3 and promoted to group captain. Jones provided the mainly academic staff in Hut 3 with wise leadership and demanded the highest standards of speed and accuracy in the production of their intelligence reports.<br>
<br>From 1945 to 1946 Jones was in Washington as representative of British signal intelligence and it was his discussions with American agencies which were the basis for American&#150;British co-operation in this field in the future. This proved of great importance to both governments in the succeeding years, most notably in the cold-war period.<br>
<br>Jones was formally transferred from the RAF to GCHQ at assistant secretary level, was made deputy director in 1950, and succeeded Sir Edward Travis as director in April 1952. He stayed as director until 1960, when he took early retirement, believing that eight years was long enough in the post. During that time he established the organization and the ethos under which GCHQ was to operate in succeeding years. For a man who left school at fifteen, he had a remarkable interest in the English language; H. W. Fowler's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Modern English Usage</span> (1926) was a favourite work. Jones produced instructions, and a system for enforcing them, to ensure that GCHQ's reports and correspondence were of the highest possible accuracy and clarity.<br>
<br>Jones's directorship spanned a period of great expansion in Soviet military capability, encompassing conventional and non-conventional weapons and rocketry to deliver them. With colleagues in the services, he made sure that British signal intelligence had the staff and technical resources to provide information on these developments. He believed that his task was management of the intellectually brilliant and technically qualified staff by whom he was surrounded, to give them the best chance to exercise their skills. A man of the highest integrity, it was said of him that corruption was unthinkable in his presence.<br>
<br>Jones aimed, quite simply, to be the best, whether in his work, as a games player (he played golf at the highest amateur level), or in skiing, which he took up at the age of fifty. When GCHQ moved to Cheltenham he bought Bredons Hardwick Manor, near Tewkesbury, and with his wife and family became a keen gardener and grew high-quality carnations.<br>
<br>A handsome man, Jones was deliberate in both speech and gait, and some found him ponderous or pompous. Perhaps for this reason, or through a lack of empathy between Whitehall mandarins and a man from a quite different background, he was not given further government employment after his retirement in 1960, at the age of fifty-three. Thereafter he accepted non-executive directorships in a number of companies, including Simon Engineering Ltd (1966&#150;77).<br>
<br>Jones was appointed CBE in 1946, CB in 1953, and KCMG in 1957. His standing among American government and service officers was very high. He was awarded the US Legion of Merit in 1946. When the US Air Force decided to have its own signal intelligence organization in the early 1950s, the British government was asked to lend Jones to set it up. He felt bound to refuse the offer, but arranged to provide advice. He died on 24 December 1986 in Wotton Nursing Home, 49 Barnwood Road, Gloucester, and his remains were cremated at Gloucester crematorium.<br>
