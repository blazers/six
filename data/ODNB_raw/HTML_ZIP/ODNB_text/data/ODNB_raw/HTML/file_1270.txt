<span class="headword">Bancroft,  John</span>  (1574&#150;1641), <span class="occ">bishop of Oxford</span>, was born at Asthall, Oxfordshire, between Burford and Minster Lovell in the Cotswolds. His father, Christopher, was brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1272/', "Richard Bancroft (bap. 1544, d. 1610)")</script>, bishop of London and later archbishop of Canterbury, and through his paternal grandmother he was great-great-nephew of Hugh Curwen, the second bishop of Oxford. He was educated at Westminster School and as a Westminster student went up to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1592. There he took the degrees of BA on 16 June 1596 and MA on 21 May 1599. He was twenty-seven when his uncle presented him to the rectory of Finchley, Middlesex, vacant by the death of Richard Latewar. Seven years later he resigned it when his uncle, now archbishop, offered him Orpington in Kent (27 May 1608). Bancroft further increased his nephew's income by granting him two sinecures in Kent, those of Woodchurch (1609) and Biddenden (1610). On 23 October 1609 John Bancroft was presented with the prebend of Maplesbury in St Paul's Cathedral, on the elevation of Samuel Harsnett to the episcopate.<br>
<br>Having gained his BD degree on 9 July 1607, Bancroft was made DD on 25 June 1610 after successfully defending the conformist thesis &#145;major est auctoritas scripturae quam ecclesiae&#146; (&#145;the authority of scripture is greater than that of the church&#146;). On 2 March 1610 he had been elected master of University College, Oxford, probably at the behest of his uncle, who as archbishop was the college's visitor. A tireless administrator, over the next twenty-three years Bancroft set the college on a sound financial basis, and in 1629 he was among those chosen to oversee the revision of the university's statutes. His mastership of University College ended on 23 August 1632, soon after he had been consecrated bishop of Oxford at the hands of Archbishop Abbot on 10 June.<br>
<br>That he owed his see to his friend William Laud, as William Prynne later alleged, is undoubtedly true, but if there is truth in Prynne's defamation of Bancroft as &#145;a corrupt, unpreaching popish prelate&#146;  (Prynne, 353), it is only in the charge of Bancroft's lack of preaching, for, singularly among those whom Charles I sanctioned to become his bishops, Bancroft had seemingly never served as a chaplain-in-ordinary and was absent, even as a bishop, from any royal pulpit; for Palm Sunday 1635 Archbishop Laud entered Bancroft's name as an alternative to his own in case he did not preach the Lent sermon at court, but in the event he did. The Short Parliament ceased sitting before Bancroft's designated Sunday duty on 24 May 1640 and he died before he could preach his turn during the Long Parliament.<br>
<br>Rather, Bancroft's appointment was the result of Laud's determination to build a new courtyard at his old Oxford college of St John's, and it is Bancroft's work in the building of Canterbury Quadrangle that has most contributed to the preservation of his memory in Oxford. He acted as both broker and chief fund-raiser for his friend Laud. At 16 April 1636 the final account showed that, of the &pound;3260 10<i>s</i>. 5<i>d</i>. raised for the quadrangle, &pound;3170 had been remitted by Bancroft allowing, as William Juxon, president of St John's, had assured Laud, for the grander court, &#145;of the largest size that Art can allowe&#146;  (Juxon to Laud, 12 March 1632, TNA: PRO, SP 16/214/38), and the surviving receipts show regular and substantial payments for the new building. By the terms of his will Bancroft asked that the proceeds from selling half his books should go to Laud's other major project, the repair of St Paul's Cathedral.<br>
<br>In the diocese Bancroft was a noted upholder of the conformist position and may, like Laud himself, have imposed only the railing-in and eastward position of the holy table when enforcing Laud's metropolitical injunctions  (Davies, 218). He sanctioned the remodelling of furnishings at his cathedral church, consecrating communion plate as well as ecclesiastical fixtures of a new pulpit, reading desk, and communion table there on 18 December 1636 after an ordination. Dean Fell commented that the form of words used was as &#145;pious and serious&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. D 399, fol. 280) as the form for consecrating churches drawn up by Lancelot Andrewes. Similar regard for propriety and correct usage led him to become embroiled in arguments over the repair of a spire at Witney in 1638, in the 1639 altercation between John Dowson and his parishioners at Maidenhead, and in vigorously demanding winter repairs at the decaying church at Churchill in 1639&#150;40. Richard Gardiner, in <span class="italic">A Sermon Concerning the Epiphany</span> (1639), congratulated Bancroft on restoring altars to their primitive accustomed places in churches, and beyond the diocese he consecrated the chapel, &#145;newly built and recently embellished&#146;  (Nicolson, 28), at Sissinghurst on 15 September 1639.<br>
<br>Bancroft was concerned to prevent lax ordinations and in 1639 refused to ordain twenty men whom he regarded as unsuitable candidates: they were, however, later ordained in other dioceses. It was later alleged, in charges that might have been brought against him had he lived, that he required his examining chaplain, Edward Fulham, to ask all ordinands whether the order of bishops was a divine institution, bowing at the name of Jesus a pious ceremony, and &#145;whether a Minister may not with a safe conscience administer the sacrament to one not kneelinge?&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. D 353, fol. 159, articles 5, 6, 8). The more trenchant question, of theology rather than practice, was whether &#145;Christ did locally descend into hell&#146;  (ibid., 9).<br>
<br>Little more than a year into his episcopate at Oxford, Bancroft was being discussed as a possible successor to Laud as bishop of London  (E. Nicholas to Sir J. Pennington, 12 Aug 1633, TNA: PRO, SP 16/244/53), but he was to remain in the diocese until his death. By collating himself to the vicarage of Cuddesdon (reckoned to be worth &pound;70 per annum), which was later annexed in perpetuity to his see by royal warrant, Bancroft was able to build a much needed palace for himself and his successors at Cuddesdon, 7 miles out of Oxford. Something of the scope of the property was glimpsed when Archbishop Laud, with his retinue of fifty mounted servants, stayed there in August 1636 <i>en route</i> for the royal celebrations that marked the completion of his Canterbury Quadrangle. Bancroft died in London on 11 February 1641 and his body was taken back to Cuddesdon and buried below the south transept wall of the parish church the next day, &#145;without any other monument then a plaine stone&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/186/80). He never married. His new episcopal palace was soon demolished for fear of its falling into parliamentarian hands.<br>
