<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Brockway,  (Archibald) Fenner</span>, Baron Brockway  (1888&#150;1988), <span class="occ">politician and campaigner</span>, was born on 1 November 1888 in Calcutta, the only son and eldest of three children of the Revd William George Brockway, London Missionary Society missionary, and his wife, Frances Elizabeth, daughter of William Abbey. His mother died when he was fourteen. Educated at the School for the Sons of Missionaries at Blackheath, he became a journalist. He moved from Liberalism to the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and by 1912 was editor of the ILP newspaper, the <span class="italic">Labour Leader</span>. Still in his twenties, he worked closely with leading figures on the British left.<br>
<br>Brockway played a heroic role in the ILP's opposition to the war of 1914&#150;18, as a journalist, and then through the No-Conscription Fellowship as an opponent of military conscription. On four occasions he was sentenced to gaol&#151;the last time in July 1917 to two years' hard labour. When released in April 1919, he had served a total of twenty-eight months, the last eight in solitary confinement. His war record increased his status in several sections of the labour movement, and in the election of 1929 he was returned as the Labour member for East Leyton. In 1919 he became editor of <span class="italic">India</span> and joint secretary of the British committee of the Indian National Congress. From 1926 to 1929 he was editor of the <span class="italic">New Leader</span>, the renamed organ of the ILP, of which he had become organizing secretary in 1922.<br>
<br>Brockway's continuing involvement in the ILP section of the wider Labour Party made him an increasingly controversial figure. From 1926 the ILP moved to the left under the leadership of James Maxton, and called for &#145;socialism in our time&#146;, a radicalization backed enthusiastically by Brockway. With the 1929 Labour government proving helpless in the face of rocketing unemployment, Brockway was prominent among a small group of ILP rebel members. This small section of left-wingers refused to accept the party's disciplinary guidelines, and were denied endorsement for the 1931 election. Like most Labour MPs, Brockway lost his seat. The dispute over discipline was symbolic for many of a much more fundamental division over policy. In July 1932, with Brockway in the chair, the ILP voted to disaffiliate from the Labour Party.<br>
<br>There followed the most radical period of Brockway's career as he sought to articulate a socialism distinct from the pragmatism of Labour and the Stalinism of the Communist Party. But the ILP's membership dwindled, and it was squeezed between its rivals. The Spanish Civil War modified his pacifism and deepened his suspicion of the Communist Party. In 1937 he visited Spain and observed the repression of the ILP's Spanish equivalent by the Communist Party. During the Second World War, he felt cross-pressured between his distaste for militarism and his thorough antipathy to fascism. In wartime by-elections he argued for socialism as a means of ending the war. After Labour's 1945 electoral success, he decided that the ILP offered no distinctive way forward and rejoined the Labour Party. From 1942 to 1947 he was chairman of the British Centre for Colonial Freedom, and in 1945 he helped establish the Congress of Peoples against Imperialism.<br>
<br>In February 1950 Brockway returned to the Commons as the member for Eton and Slough. He remained firmly on the left, participating in the faction centred around Aneurin Bevan, but his radicalism was always tempered by a concern not to reproduce what he had come to see as the disastrous split of 1932. His strong anti-militarism was expressed in his involvement with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. His principal fame came from his championing of anti-colonial movements. His interest in Indian independence had been long-standing, and from 1950 he began to visit Africa regularly. Some called him the member for Africa and he knew several of the first generation post-independence African leaders. From 1954 he was chairman of the Movement for Colonial Freedom. His anti-colonialism was reflected in a thorough opposition to racism in Britain. In nine successive sessions he introduced bills into the Commons aimed at outlawing discrimination. Ironically, when the 1964 Labour government embarked on such legislation, Brockway had just lost his parliamentary seat. The margin was eleven votes and some commentators ascribed his defeat to the race issue. Despite misgivings, he accepted a life peerage (1964), and campaigned for his causes within the traditionalism of the upper house. His radicalism remained vibrant in his new environment. Brockway was a prolific writer, of books, pamphlets, and articles. These included four volumes of autobiography and major studies of two ILP contemporaries, Fred Jowett (<span class="italic">Socialism over Sixty Years</span>, 1946) and Alfred Salter (<span class="italic">Bermondsey Story</span>, 1949). In 1914 he married Lilla, daughter of the Revd William Harvey-Smith. They had four daughters, two of whom predeceased him (1941 and 1974). As Brockway acknowledged later, the marriage was not a success, and he had several, often short-lived, affairs in the inter-war years. After a divorce in 1945, in 1946 he married Edith Violet, daughter of Archibald Herbert King, electrician; they had one son. Both his wives shared many of his political views.<br>
<br>Many found Brockway to be highly principled and warmly sympathetic. His style inherited something of his missionary background, and his socialist politics owed much to a broader tradition of English radicalism; a statue in London's Red Lion Square (1985) depicts him addressing a crowd, arm aloft. Not an intellectual, he was yet an independent thinker. Born in the age of Gladstone, he died in the age of Thatcher on 28 April 1988, at Watford General Hospital, Hertfordshire.<br>
