<span class="headword">Pandit, Vijayalakshmi</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Sarup Kumari Nehru]</span>  (1900&#150;1990), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 18 August 1900 at Anand Bhavan, Allahabad, India, the second of the three children and elder daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35192/', "Motilal Nehru (1861&#150;1931)")</script>, lawyer and nationalist leader, and his wife, Swarup Rani. Her father, one of the most successful lawyers of his day, ensured that she received a good education from an English governess. Eleven years younger than her brother, the statesman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35191/', "Jawaharlal Nehru")</script>, she was nevertheless close to him both as a child and throughout their lives. As a young woman Sarup Kumari Nehru formed a close attachment to a Muslim journalist, Saiyid Hossain, who was working on a newspaper owned by her father. However, he was not acceptable to her family, let alone to conservative Allahabad society, and the relationship was brought to an end. Shortly thereafter her family sent her to stay for a short while with Mahatma Gandhi in his <i>ashram</i>; she remained unconvinced of the value of a wholly ascetic life. On 10 May 1921 she married Ranjit Sitaram Pandit (<i>d</i>. 1944), a lawyer and scholar from Kathiawar, and took the name by which she became known throughout the world. They had three daughters, one of whom, Nayantara Saghal, became a well-known novelist.<br>
<br>As a young bride Vijayalakshmi Pandit lived in Calcutta, where her husband practised law. From 1930, however, she joined the other members of her family in Gandhi's civil disobedience campaign against British rule. Her first arrest came in 1932, and she served several terms of imprisonment, totalling thirty-six months. She also held a series of elected offices, including that of minister of local government and health in the pre-independence Congress governments in the United Provinces in 1937&#150;9 and 1946&#150;7. From 1944 to 1945 and again in 1946 she was in the United States, where her daughters were attending college, and where, at Gandhi's request, she spoke for the Indian nationalist cause in the critical period leading up to independence. Her rapport with Americans, statesmen and public alike, played a major role in sustaining American support for India's cause. In the same period, in 1945 she attended the San Francisco United Nations preliminary conference as an unofficial delegate, and in 1946 headed the Indian delegation to the first United Nations general assembly at Lake Success. She headed India's delegation on four further occasions. In 1947 she became India's first ambassador to the USSR, although here she was unable to establish a close rapport with the Soviet leadership. She was transferred to Washington in 1949, where her earlier popularity with the American public grew. On her return to India in 1951 she stood successfully for the Lok Sabha (lower house of the Indian parliament), where she sat until 1954.<br>
<br>In 1953 Vijayalakshmi Pandit became president of the United Nations general assembly, a significant first for a country in the developing world (she was also the first woman to occupy the post). She was then sent to London as high commissioner, where she served from 1954 to 1961, as well as being accredited as India's first ambassador to Ireland and Spain. She was also to be governor of Maharashtra state from 1962 to 1964. It was a notable achievement at this time for a woman to hold such a range of distinguished political and diplomatic positions.<br>
<br>After her brother's death in May 1964 Mrs Pandit's political star dimmed and she held no further public offices, although she took over Nehru's Phulpur constituency in the Lok Sabha from 1964 until she resigned in 1969. She did not hide her disagreements with her niece, Indira Gandhi, and she was strongly critical of the declaration of an internal emergency in 1975. In the 1977 election campaign she campaigned vigorously for the opposition. Mrs Pandit spent her retirement in the foothills of the Himalayas, near Dehra Dun, where she died on 1 December 1990. She had published a memoir of her time in gaol, <span class="italic">Prison Days</span> (1945), and an autobiographical volume, <span class="italic">The Scope of Happiness</span> (1979).<br>
