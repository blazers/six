<span class="headword">Whitehall,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1624, <em>d.</em> 1685), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was baptized on 18 March 1624 at Amersham parish church, Buckinghamshire. He was the only son of Robert Whitehall (1584&#150;1658), a clergyman who held in plurality the benefices of St Mary Magdalen, Oxford (January 1616 to January or February 1629), and Addington, Buckinghamshire (September 1616 onwards), and his first wife, Bridget Watkins (<i>bap</i>. 1603), of Amersham, whom he married there on 12 June 1623. Whitehall's mother died soon after childbirth, and was buried at Amersham on 28 July 1624. Her husband remarried and had seven further children; he was buried at Addington on 1 October 1658.<br>
<br>A king's scholar at Westminster School under Richard Busby, Whitehall became a member of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1643, gaining his BA on 2 November 1647. On 10 May 1648 he refused to submit to the parliamentary visitation with the words, &#145;As I am summoned a Student of Christ Church, my name itself speaks for me, that I can acknowledge no Visitation but K. Charles&#146;, rendered into the couplet<blockquote>
<div>My name's Whitehall, God bless the Poet,<br>
</div>
<div>If I submit, the King shall know it.<br>
</div> (Gutch, <span class="italic">History</span>, 2/2, 583)</blockquote>He was expelled on 7 July 1648, and probably retired to his father's rectory. He subsequently submitted to the authority of the parliamentary visitors, and with the support of Richard Ingoldsby, the regicide and MP for Buckingham, was appointed to a fellowship at Merton College in 1650. He was awarded his MA on 18 November 1652, appointed <i>terrae filius</i> in 1655, and qualified as MB on 5 September 1657 (a licence dated 21 June 1665 allowed him to practise). In response to a letter from Henry Cromwell dated 22 June 1657, the college authorities gave permission for Whitehall &#145;to give instruction in the University of Dublin&#146;  (Brodrick, 94), but there is no record that he did so. On 19 October 1670, probably with reference to the presbyterian-royalist plot led by Sir George Booth in August 1659 to restore the monarchy, he wrote to Joseph Williamson MP, the keeper of state papers and secretary to Lord Arlington, to seek compensation for having been &#145;worsted in spirituals of 250<i>l</i>. a year, and in nearly 1,000<i>l</i>. by the Cheshire misadventure&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1670</i>). In 1671 Whitehall was sub-warden of Merton College.<br>
<br>Whitehall's contemporary at Merton, the unamiable Anthony Wood, dismisses him as a &#145;pot poet&#146; and &#145;no better than a meer Poetaster and time-serving-Poet&#146; (Gutch, <span class="italic">History</span>, 2/2, 583; Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.596). Much of the surviving <i>&#339;uvre</i> consists of well-crafted verse addresses in Latin or English to figures as varied as Oliver Cromwell (1654), Richard Cromwell (1657), Prince Henry, Edward Hyde (1660), the king (1660, 1679), the queen mother (1661), and Catherine of Braganza (1662). These were printed either separately or within the volumes of loyal verses produced by members of Oxford University, where, reflecting his local repute, they were generally accorded by the university printer, Leonard Lichfield, a prestigious position at the end of the collections. Four substantial, if overblown, poems justify the accolade of minor poet: &#145;The Marriage of Armes and Arts, July 12. 1651&#146; and &#145;Urania&#146; (1669) are crammed with learned references, and &#145;The Coronation&#146; (1661) and &#145;The English Rechabite&#146; (1680) are well paced and engagingly boisterous. Whitehall's exchanges with the artist Mary More, though, reveal a less deft touch (BL, Harley MS 3918): both in &#145;The woman's right proved false&#146; (his prose rebuttal to her polished essay challenging male authority) and in his verses (separately printed in 1674) following her gift to the university of her &#145;drawing&#146; of Thomas More (actually Thomas Cromwell), his tone is patronizing and misjudged. His lines generated not only a spirited reply from the donor, in which she cast aspersion on the sexual preferences of the &#145;Fellow and Batchelour&#146;, but also, anonymously, &#145;A Reproof to R. W.&#146; (Portland MS PwV, 504). Whitehall's only full-length work is his appealing <span class="italic">Hexastichon hieron</span> (1677), a book of 258 emblems on biblical subjects accompanied by verses. Twelve copies only were printed by Lichfield and then &#145;richly bound&#146; for presentation, probably to attract patronage; recipients included the king and the young son of John Wilmot, second earl of Rochester, for whom it may have been &#145;chiefly composed&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.597).<br>
<br>Whitehall provides a unique glimpse of Rochester as an undergraduate at Wadham College between 1660 and 1661; the don &#145;absolutely doted&#146; on him and &#145;pretended to instruct the Count &hellip; in the art of Poetry&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.490). On 1 January 1667 the genial Whitehall sent him with his portrait a Hudibrastic verse epistle; this describes the author's florid appearance, incidentally supporting Wood's comment, &#145;following the trade of drinking as he was wont, [he] gained to himself a red face&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Modius salium</span>, 25), and reveals his practice of lending Rochester, for &#145;night rambles &hellip; as protection from proctorial interference&#146;, his own academic gown; this the undergraduate<blockquote>
<div>daggled through this towne<br>
</div>
<div>To keepe vp discipline, and tell vs<br>
</div>
<div>Next morning where you found good=fellows.<br>
</div> (Needham, vi, 44)</blockquote>Whitehall and Rochester contributed to the volumes of university verses addressed to the king and queen mother in the early 1660s. Although Wood alleges that Whitehall penned Rochester's three poems, they differ significantly in tone; while Whitehall, and even another contributor, Walter Blandford, the warden of Wadham, may have added polish, there is &#145;nothing in them that might not have been composed by a clever boy of thirteen&#146;  (Pinto, 9) and the case for Whitehall's authorship is further weakened by the attack on physicians in Rochester's poem to the queen. The poems were &#145;unquestionably printed as Rochester's with his knowledge and consent&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Poems of John Wilmot</span>, 155) and appeared posthumously in the &#145;authorized&#146; 1691 edition of Rochester's poems.<br>
<br>Whitehall died a bachelor on 8 July 1685 and was &#145;buried the next day in the south part or Isle&#146; of his college chapel  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.597); there is a commemorative stone in the ante-chapel floor.<br>
