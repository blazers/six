<span class="headword">Fortescue,  Frances Elizabeth Anne  Parkinson-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Frances Elizabeth Anne Braham; <em>other married name </em>Frances Elizabeth Anne Waldegrave, Countess Waldegrave]</span>  (1821&#150;1879), <span class="occ">political hostess</span>, was born on 4 January 1821 at 3 Tavistock Square, London, the third child and eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3224/', "John Braham (1777?&#150;1856)")</script>, singer, and his wife, Frances Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bolton (1799&#150;1846). She had four brothers and a sister. She was baptized at St Pancras church in the following August: Braham had long forsworn his Jewish background. She was allowed to run wild as a child, but her mother had high ambitions for her. John Braham made a fortune as a singer, but lost it as a theatre manager, and Frances was to redeem the family by a prosperous marriage. In fact, the fair-haired, exuberant Fanny Braham married four times. Her first husband was John James Henry Waldegrave (1814&#150;1840), the illegitimate son of the sixth Earl Waldegrave. They married on 25 May 1839; eleven months later he was dead from a combination of <i>delirium tremens</i> and epilepsy. Five months later, on 28 September 1840, she married George Edward Waldegrave, seventh Earl Waldegrave (1816&#150;1846), her first husband's legitimate brother. They spent six months of the first year together in the queen's bench prison, whence Waldegrave had been committed for assaulting a policeman before the marriage. In 1842 Waldegrave put up for auction the contents of Horace Walpole's Gothic villa, Strawberry Hill, Twickenham, which he had inherited from his aunt, and took his countess to live in Switzerland for two years. On their return to England he manifested signs of liver disease and mental breakdown, and he died from cirrhosis of the liver on 28 September 1846. Like his brother, he left all his estates to his widow.<br>
<br>Lady Waldegrave (she retained the title throughout her life, formally styling herself Frances, Countess Waldegrave) married for the third time on 30 September 1847; her new husband was George Granville Vernon Harcourt (1785&#150;1861), a widower of sixty-two, with a daughter five years Frances's senior. This was a very different proposition from the Waldegrave marriages: the brothers were typically wild young men, their family socially marginal despite their estates and titles, and Frances had had little to do with aristocratic society while they lived. Harcourt, by contrast, was the very acme of respectability: a Peelite MP, son of an archbishop of York, and cousin of the duke of Sutherland. Under his tutelage, Frances acquired polish, and soon became an accomplished hostess at his houses, Nuneham Park, Oxfordshire, and in London (initially in St James's Place, then at 5 Carlton House Terrace, and, from 1853, at 7 Carlton Gardens), making a feature of amateur theatricals. Harcourt was not an easy man to live with, for although he rejoiced in his wife's social success, he was snobbish, jealous, and insecure, and never wholly put aside the role of tutor. The diplomatist Robert Morier described their relationship as belonging to a Louis XV vaudeville, with Harcourt &#145;the old Marquis, heir to palaces and broad acres, a genealogy &#147;as long as my tail&#148;, and an ungovernable temper&#146;, and Frances the young wife, &#145;with immense fortune, beauty, accomplishments, whims without end, gigantic animal spirits, the world-spoiled child, with every denomination of admirer flitting about her, really fond of the old &#147;Marquis&#148; but determined to stand no humbug&#146;  (Wemyss, 115). It was at least in part to give herself a refuge from him that Frances decided to restore Strawberry Hill. She carried out extensive building works, bought items which had previously been in Walpole's collections, and began a portrait gallery of her friends in imitation of Walpole's. From 1856 &#145;Friday to Monday&#146; parties at Strawberry Hill were a regular feature of the London season, and as time passed they took on a more pronouncedly political character.<br>
<br>Frances Waldegrave had been interested in politics from the time of her second marriage. Waldegrave had been a tory in so far as he had political opinions, and Harcourt was a follower of Sir Robert Peel. That Frances developed into one of the most prominent whig-Liberal political hostesses stemmed in some measure from the fluidity of party allegiances in the 1850s; Frances herself became and remained more of a whig than a Liberal. Until 1865 the pre-eminent political hostess was Lady Palmerston, who entertained on behalf of her husband's coalitions with verve and enthusiasm. Frances's guests were more eclectic than those of most London hostesses: alongside politicians, aristocrats, royalty, and diplomats were to be found artists, journalists, musicians, and actors. She had her critics, who thought that her parties lowered the tone of society by admitting such lesser mortals, but she also inspired deep attachments. Her admirers included most of the members of her husbands' families, the duke of Newcastle (whom she aspired to make prime minister), Lord Chelsea, the duc d'Aumale (son of the deposed Orleanist king, Louis Philippe) and his duchess, who lived near Strawberry Hill at Orleans House, Lord St Germans, the marquess of Lansdowne, Edward Lear, and a bevy of young men and women including Julian Fane, William Vernon Harcourt (Harcourt's nephew), Mary Bulteel (later Lady Ponsonby), and the young Irish MP <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9938/', "Chichester Samuel Fortescue, later Parkinson-Fortescue, from 1874 Baron Carlingford (1823&#150;1898)")</script>. It was not just as a hostess that Frances was in demand: her advice was widely sought by her adherents, who gave her drafts of speeches to comment on, brought their articles for publication to her for approval, and came daily to discuss debates in parliament and events in the political world. Her contacts with the press made her especially useful to aspiring authors, and she did not hesitate to encourage her friends to write on particular issues for the editors who were also among her guests, notably J. T. Delane of <span class="italic">The Times</span> and J. D. Cook of the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>.<br>
<br>Chichester Fortescue was obsessively in love with Lady Waldegrave from 1850, and preferred the often uncomfortable position of being the confidant of both husband and wife to the alternative of shunning her company. There was always gossip about Lady Waldegrave, and she enjoyed her reputation as a matchmaker, but despite her worldliness and pleasure in the admiration of men, she was also genuinely religious and was shocked by sexual immorality and infidelity. When Harcourt died five days after the prince consort, on 19 December 1861, speculation was rife about who would succeed him as Lady Waldegrave's husband. Like her first two husbands, Harcourt left everything he could to Frances (Nuneham was entailed), along with a glowing commendation of his wife in his will, advising her to remarry. The duke of Newcastle was widely thought to be the favourite, but it was the faithful Fortescue&#151;Newcastle's junior at the Colonial Office&#151;whom she married on 20 January 1863. (Shortly afterwards Fortescue changed his name to Parkinson-Fortescue, on inheriting land in Ireland from his aunt.)<br>
<br>Lady Waldegrave devoted the next twenty years to promoting Parkinson-Fortescue's political career and the interests of the Liberal Party to which he belonged. Like the political hostesses of earlier generations, she used her phenomenal energy, her personal tact and sympathy, her hospitable instincts, her considerable wealth, and her open houses to drum up and maintain support for the party, and to find support for her husband's career. When Parkinson-Fortescue was sent to Ireland as chief secretary (1865&#150;6, 1868&#150;71), Frances accompanied him; her entertainments in Dublin were on a lavish scale not seen for years as she set about wooing support for the ministry. She made at least one enemy, Lord Kimberley, who was lord lieutenant, and whose wife was completely outshone by Lady Waldegrave. With Parkinson-Fortescue's chief, W. E. Gladstone, Frances had a difficult relationship: he frequented her parties in the 1860s, but they came into conflict over policy, as Frances and Parkinson-Fortescue were always more conservative than Gladstone. She was determined that Parkinson-Fortescue should shine and felt aggrieved when Gladstone first took over the development of policy on the disestablishment of the Irish church and the <span class="roman">Irish Land Act</span> of 1870. She threatened to bring down the government, which vastly overestimated both her influence with the party and Parkinson-Fortescue's necessity to it; but she was not a negligible figure, and her social influence had to be taken into account as a factor promoting the cohesion of the Liberal Party. The real difficulty was that Parkinson-Fortescue had probably been promoted beyond his capacities; unlike Lady Palmerston, Frances threw her weight behind a man who fatally lacked ambition and had no more than moderate talents.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1870s Lady Waldegrave and Baron Carlingford (as Parkinson-Fortescue became in 1874) continued their relentless round of entertaining, at Strawberry Hill, at Dudbrook House in Essex, at Chewton Priory in Somerset, and at 7 Carlton Gardens. The prince and princess of Wales kept up the royal connections, especially after the Aumales (who had been such frequent guests as to become a positive menace) returned to France in 1871. She had never been politically exclusive: Conservatives as well as Liberals and whigs were welcomed to her parties&#151;Disraeli was a regular guest, slipping into Carlton Gardens from the neighbouring Carlton Club. Late in June 1879 Frances was taken ill, initially with a cold, but she began having heart problems and congestion of the lungs. She died at 7 Carlton Gardens on 5 July 1879 and was buried at Chewton Mendip parish church, Somerset. Carlingford was devastated by his wife's death, and spent his remaining twenty years mourning her, his political career effectively ended by the passing of her ambition.<br>
<br>Frances, Countess Waldegrave, was an extraordinary figure in Victorian society. With her origins in the theatre, she was herself an intensely theatrical, larger-than-life individual: no truly satisfactory portrait of her was ever taken. She aroused strong emotions; many adored her, others considered her an upstart adventuress. She was widely supposed to have been the model for Anthony Trollope's Madame Max Goestler in the Palliser novels; Phineas Finn owed much to Carlingford. The Somerset and Essex estates that had come to her from her first marriages returned to the Waldegrave family under the terms of her will. Carlingford could not bear to live at Strawberry Hill without her, and in 1888 a second Strawberry Hill auction took place.<br>
