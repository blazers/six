<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Butler,  Henry Montagu</span>  (1833&#150;1918), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born at Gayton, Northamptonshire, on 2 July 1833. Ninth child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4183/', "Dr George Butler (1774&#150;1853)")</script>, headmaster of Harrow School and dean of Peterborough, and his wife, Sarah Maria, daughter of John Gray of Wembley Park, Middlesex, he was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4214/', "Revd Weeden Butler the elder")</script>. His brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4184/', "George Butler (1819&#150;1890)")</script>, canon of Winchester, married the social reformer Josephine Butler (1828&#150;1906). Educated at Olney School, Olney, Eagle House School, Hammersmith, and Harrow School (1846&#150;51) under Dr C. J. Vaughan, Butler was a high achiever, becoming head of school and Gregory scholar. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1851, where he excelled, winning the Battie prize (1853) and Porson prize (1854). President of the Union Society, scholar of the college, Bell university scholar, senior classic, BA and fellow in 1855, and DD in 1865, Butler was assistant tutor at Trinity in 1855&#150;6 and 1858&#150;9, spending the year between touring the Far East. Between 1856 and 1858 he was private secretary to William Francis Cowper at the Board of Health; secretary to the 1857 royal commission on the National Gallery; curate at Great St Mary's, Cambridge; and ordained a deacon in 1859.<br>
<br>Aged twenty-six, following the unexpected resignation of Dr Vaughan, Butler was appointed headmaster of Harrow School, and remained there for twenty-six years. Over thirty published testimonials praised his suitability to be the first Old Harrovian headmaster. A traditionalist, sensitive to the entrenched views of able, long-established staff, yet aware of the need to modernize, he adopted a patient, pragmatic approach. Butler made some important curricular reforms: in science, influenced by his brother-in-law, Francis Galton, and in music, by appointing John Farmer, who inaugurated the famous Harrow songs. Butler selected other distinguished staff, including Reginald Bosworth Smith and Frederick William Farrar. Noted for the variety, morality, and thoroughness of his teaching, Butler established good relationships with boys and staff, taking a personal interest in their welfare. He initiated new building at Harrow, notably the Vaughan Library, established in 1861, which later included a stained-glass memorial window to his first wife. Butler appealed to Old Harrovians for funds to build a sanatorium, and extended the headmaster's house and the cricket fields. He gave lengthy evidence to the 1864 Clarendon commission into public schools, which recognized improvements at Harrow under himself and Vaughan. He piloted the school through a difficult period after the commissioners' controversial recommendation that governors should have more say in the curriculum. The demands of school management led to serious illness in 1881. His wife, Georgina, died in 1883, and when offered the deanery of Gloucester in 1885 he accepted. However, he never settled, remaining only fifteen months, but he did manage to introduce popular music into cathedral services to appeal to the general public. When the opportunity arose to become master of Trinity in 1886 he was delighted.<br>
<br>As master, Butler presided rather than ruled over deans, tutors, and fellows in an increasingly lay society. Noted for his conciliatory skills and stature as the public face of Trinity, his pre-eminence was such that he became vice-chancellor of the university in 1889/90. Butler was an Apostle, a member of the select Cambridge debating society dominated by Harrow and Trinity intelligentsia, of which he was president in 1865.<br>
<br>As at Harrow, Butler's meticulous memory and attention to detail ensured impeccable organization of college functions. His sense of history was strong; he added considerably to Trinity memorabilia but was disappointed when his plan to extend the Wren Library was rejected and a simpler annexe built instead. Although Butler always strove for moderation and unity, beneath a mild exterior he could be firm and resolute, adopting an independent approach to outside interference. At Harrow he frequently preferred his colleagues' views to those of the governors; in 1861 he married without consulting the governing body. Not afraid openly to criticize colleagues, he castigated Bertrand Russell's condemnation of the First World War as a dereliction of duty, Russell being relieved of his lecturership in 1916. Butler himself sometimes took personal criticism badly, becoming depressed when he was unable to convince others of his opinions. On his eightieth birthday, however, his Trinity colleagues praised his charm, dignity, style, and good humour. A warm, sympathetic, and loyal friend and employer, Butler could be disarmingly self-deprecating. At Harrow he confessed to deficiencies in mathematics and natural sciences; at Trinity he agreed he was not as academically pre-eminent as his predecessors.<br>
<br>Butler was Christian rather than sectarian, and at Cambridge became a practical link between different denominations. A Liberal, he advocated national schooling to tackle the problem of deprivation. Influenced in his youth by F. D. Maurice, he was committed to the cause of working-class education and helped establish a working men's college in Cambridge; he supported the university extension scheme and, as <i>ex officio</i> manager of Roxeth national school, promoted scholarships for elementary school boys. He founded the Harrow Mission in 1882, bringing aid to a poor area of west London, and advised the 1895 Bryce commission on secondary education that poor students should receive financial help. With the aid of his second wife, Agnata, who was placed by examiners above the senior classic at Cambridge in 1887, Butler supported degrees for women and was a member of Girton College council. Criticized as a shallow popularist who favoured his friends, his unswerving self-confidence was seen by some as vanity. A caricature in <span class="italic">The Granta</span> (1889) depicted Butler as very aware of his own goodness&#151;and the failings of others. Although he campaigned to foster modern languages at both school and university, Butler was criticized for allowing classical composition to predominate. He was essentially a teacher, not an educationist.<br>
<br>On 19 December 1861 Butler married Georgina Isabella (<i>d</i>. 1883), daughter of Edward Francis Elliot of Madras and granddaughter of Hugh Elliot (1752&#150;1830), minister at the court of Frederick the Great. Georgina died in December 1883. On 9 August 1888, a few months after he had met her at a performance of a Greek play, Butler married Agnata Frances [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45783/', "Butler, Agnata Frances (1867&#150;1931)")</script>], daughter of the historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35662/', "Sir James Henry Ramsay, bt (1832&#150;1925)")</script> of Bamff, the classical scholar, and his first wife, Elizabeth Mary Charlotte. There were two sons and three daughters from the first marriage, three sons from the second. Butler had a wide social circle, with Alfred Tennyson, Matthew Arnold, Charles Kingsley, John Ruskin, A. E. Housman, and G. O. Trevelyan among his friends. With a phenomenal memory and wit, he was a popular after-dinner speaker. Tall and slender as a young man, he was talented at cricket, football, and boxing, but restricted from playing through poor health. He loved Italy, enjoyed mountaineering, and belonged to an alpine club; in later life he enjoyed walking in the Cambridge countryside. Strongly opposed to smoking, regarding it as unseemly, later portraits show him as a benign elder statesman. Although feeble in his final years, his mind remained active.<br>
<br>Butler excelled at classics, writing and translating Latin and Greek poetry and memorial epitaphs. He was a passionate composer of sermons, which were highly praised as eloquent and uplifting. An excellent letter writer, his correspondence with people of various persuasions revealed many interests, but his publications were meagre. His chief works included volumes of school and university sermons, <span class="italic">Chatham as an Orator</span> (1912), <span class="italic">Some Leisure Hours of a Long Life</span> (1914), and <span class="italic">Ten Great and Good Men</span> (1909), which he acknowledged was light reading. Butler was honorary chaplain to the queen (1875&#150;7); examining chaplain to archbishops Tait and Benson (1879&#150;83); select preacher at Oxford (1877, 1878, 1882, 1899); select preacher at Cambridge (1879, 1885, 1887, 1889, 1890, 1895&#150;8, 1903, 1906, 1913); prebendary of Holborn in St Paul's Cathedral (1882&#150;5); honorary canon of Ely (1897); and governor of Harrow (1901).<br>
<br>Following a short bronchial attack, Butler died at Trinity lodge, Cambridge, on 14 January 1918. The archbishop of Canterbury officiated at his funeral at Trinity, and A. E. Housman composed a Latin inscription for the commemorative brass in the ante-chapel. Among the condolences was one from George V. He was buried at Harrow School on 17 January, survived by his wife. The first son from his second marriage, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30884/', "Sir James Ramsay Montagu Butler (1889&#150;1975)")</script>, historian, lived his life in Trinity and was his father's biographer. Sir Nevile Montagu Butler (1893&#150;1973), diplomatist, was another of his sons from this marriage. H. M. Butler was thus a central figure of Noel Annan's &#145;intellectual aristocracy&#146;.<br>
