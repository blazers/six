<span class="headword">O'Donnell,  Rury <span class="st"> [Rory; </span></span> <span class="st"> Ruaidhr&iacute; &Oacute; Domhnaill]</span>, styled first earl of Tyrconnell  (1574/5&#150;1608), <span class="occ">magnate and soldier</span>, was the second son of Sir Hugh O'Donnell (<i>b</i>. in or before 1535, <i>d</i>. 1600), lord of Tyrconnell, and his second wife, Fionnuala, called In&iacute;on Dhubh 
    (Dark Girl; <i>d</i>. 1611?)
  , daughter of James MacDonnell of the Isles and his wife, Agnes Campbell. The sons of Sir Hugh and Fionnuala were, in order of birth, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20554/', "Red Hugh (Hugh Roe) O'Donnell (1572&#150;1602)")</script>, lord of Tyrconnell, Rury, Manus, and Caffar. Rury was tanist to Red Hugh from at least 1597 and it may be presumed that he was fostered in a friendly household, receiving an education and training appropriate to his status as the son of a chieftain.<h2>
<a name="TheNineYearsWar"></a>The Nine Years' War</h2>During the campaign, Rury was in action in Connaught and then at Lough Foyle against Sir Henry Docwra and his own cousin and brother-in-law, Niall Garbh O'Donnell. He and Manus fought as cavalrymen, with lance, short sword, and target. Near Derry, Manus was fatally wounded (24 October 1600), while Niall Garbh narrowly escaped death at Rury's hands. The latter and two companion horsemen next dispatched six English foot and a sergeant. The action moved to Lifford, where Rury was wounded. The death of Manus hastened that of his father, which occurred on 27 November. In the spring of 1601 Rury failed to recapture Doe Castle, which Red Hugh, the new O'Donnell, secured in July. The sources give no account of Rury's part in such actions as that against Sir Conyers Clifford, president of Connaught, in the Curlews. He went south to Cork on the great march in 1601, but again the authorities are silent on what part he played at Kinsale. It is not impossible that he played a more prominent part in the war than &Oacute; Cl&eacute;righ's <span class="italic">Life of Hugh Roe</span> and, deriving from that, the account by the four masters give him credit for.<br>
<br>After Kinsale, Red Hugh O'Donnell committed his command to Rury, urging him and Hugh O'Neill to remain in the south pending his return. However, they took their separate ways homewards, Rury bringing his forces into the safety of lower Connaught, where O'Donnell on his way to Kinsale had left O'Gallagher in charge of his cattle. Rury made headquarters at Ballymote Castle, apparently awaiting his brother's return with Spanish reinforcements. In any case the way home was closed to him, with Ballyshannon and Donegal in enemy hands. In the summer of 1602 he successfully evaded a pincer attack on him by government armies and in August O'Connor Sligo and he repulsed Lambert at the Curlews. The death of O'Donnell in Simancas (30 August) made it easier for Rury to accept terms from Lord Deputy Mountjoy, to whom he and O'Connor Sligo submitted at Athlone on 14 December. Rury claimed that O'Donnell had kept him in irons for arranging with Governor Clifford to serve Queen Elizabeth. Perhaps: but Clifford was dead, and Red Hugh O'Donnell had shown confidence in Rury after Kinsale, so possibly Rury, with his army intact, was making the best of what was not a bad hand. Niall Garbh, now abandoned by a Mountjoy anxious for peace, seized Rury's herds and had himself proclaimed O'Donnell, but had to yield to Docwra.<h2>
<a name="EarlofTyrconnellandtheODonnellGeraldinealliance"></a>Earl of Tyrconnell and the O'Donnell&#150;Geraldine alliance</h2>In the 1603 peace arrangements, Rury O'Donnell was, in Christchurch, Dublin, created earl of Tyrconnell, with remainder to Caffar, and knighted by Lord Deputy Carey on 29 September; he was granted a patent for his lands on 10 February 1604. C&uacute;coigcr&iacute;che &Oacute; Cl&eacute;righ celebrated the new era with a praise-poem: <span class="italic">Rug cabhair air Chonallchaibh</span>. But E&oacute;ghan Ruadh Mac an Bhaird, reflecting a conviction now current that the old order was over, was fearful: &#145;do mealladh mac U&iacute; Dhomhnoill&#146; (&#145;O'Donnell's son has been beguiled&#146;; O. Bergin, <span class="italic">Irish Bardic Poetry</span>, 1970, 127). Yet Tyrconnell was now a good match, and the old O'Donnell&#150;Geraldine alliance was renewed when about 1604 he married Lady Brigid Fitzgerald (<i>c</i>.1589&#150;1682), only daughter of Henry, twelfth earl of Kildare. Brigid's mother was Frances, daughter of Charles Howard, earl of Nottingham, lord high admiral and one of the Spanish party among the king's councillors. Hugh Albert O'Donnell, born about October 1606<a href="#cosubject_74430"> [<i>see below</i>]</a>, was the only son of this marriage, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20557/', "Mary Stuart O'Donnell")</script> being born about a year later. Some authorities give an eldest child, Elizabeth, probably illegitimate, who became first wife of Luke Plunkett, first earl of Fingall.<br>
<br>Villamediana, Spanish resident in London, suspected Nottingham's hand behind Tyrconnell's visit to him late in 1604. The earls of Tyrone and Tyrconnell had already sounded the ambassador on a possible renewal of the war with Spanish help. Philip III's council of state, which, with the ink on the treaty of London scarcely dry, had no wish to offend England, supported Villamediana's cool response. The conclusion arrived at by some modern writers of a plot between the earls and Spain is untenable. Nor did the payment by Spain in 1607 of a subvention to the earls constitute a conspiracy. &#145;Feeding another's dog&#146; (&#145;dar pan a perro ajeno&#146;) is how Gondomar, who disliked it, termed this commonplace practice  (P. Aguado Bleye, <span class="italic">Manual de historia de Espa&ntilde;a</span>, t. 2: <span class="italic">Reyes Cat&oacute;licos&#151;Casa de Austria</span>, 8th edn, Madrid, 1959, 718).<h2>
<a name="Ahollowpatent"></a>A hollow patent</h2>Tyrconnell's patent made him tenant-in-chief of co. Donegal in as ample a manner as any of his ancestors had enjoyed Tyrconnell, with remainder to Caffar, but excluded from the patent were: overlordship of Inishowen (granted to Sir Cahir O'Doherty) and of co. Sligo; Derry (which received an urban charter in July 1604), with the Foyle fishings; the land, at least 12,900 acres, and castles of the Finn valley (allotted to Niall Garbh); and the castle and town of Ballyshannon, with which also went the Erne fishery and a (conservatively) estimated 1000 acres adjoining. A network of government strongholds controlled the Swilly and the way into co. Tyrone and Connaught. Valuable lands, both demesne and mensal, were wrested from Tyrconnell, and the government commissioners apportioned freeholds throughout the county. In 1605 he was forced to acknowledge (contrary to the chief's ancient rights, lately confirmed) that the three MacSweeneys and O'Boyle held independently of him. Servitors availed of one device or another&#151;general grants or declaration of both monastic lands and fishings as royal property&#151;to enrich themselves at Tyrconnell's expense. Thus Sir Henry Folliott, already holding Ballyshannon and its fisheries, acquired extensive further lands and fisheries in Tirhugh. At the other end of Donegal, Sir Ralph Bingley came by the Rathmullan and Kilmacrenan abbey lands, together with Inch Island and the Swilly fishings. Donegal again and co. Tyrone had sheriffs by 1603, and Donegal saw its first assize sittings in that year. Richard Bingley received the grant of the customs of Derry and Ballyshannon ports. Such severe restrictions on his patent made Tyrconnell's appointment as lord lieutenant of the county in 1605 quite hollow. Finally James I's bishop of Derry, Raphoe, and Clogher, George Montgomery, was working to appropriate, again contrary to ancient law, the ownership of all church and monastic lands.<br>
<br>Ralph Bingley, at the considerable price of &pound;1600, Tyrconnell later asserted, sold him the Kilmacrenan lands, 29,000 acres, with some smaller lots. But Bingley's tenant remained on the Kilmacrenan holding, paying no rent. The recovery of Doe Castle in 1607 was also at the cost of Tyrconnell, as lord lieutenant, while Chichester put Bingley into the fortress, making Tyrconnell grant him a lease. Tyrconnell was now left with just two castles, Donegal and nearby Lough Eske. In April 1607 King Philip made a sum of 8000 ducats available in equal shares to Tyrone and Tyrconnell. But there was no promise of an annuity, and Tyrconnell's share (about &pound;1250 in contemporary terms) would go only in part to cover debts he had incurred when forced to mortgage a considerable portion of his land to Dublin merchants. Chichester himself estimated that his debts left Tyrconnell no better revenue than &pound;300 a year.<h2>
<a name="Theflightoftheearls"></a>The flight of the earls</h2>On 4 September 1607 a shipload of about ninety people, including the earls of Tyrconnell and Tyrone and Cuconnacht Maguire, sailed from Rathmullan, on the Swilly, bound for Spain. Tyrconnell and Maguire (apportioned only part of co. Fermanagh) were both disappointed men and planned, it seems clear, to abandon Ireland. Tyrone in vain advised Tyrconnell first to seek royal leave. About mid-May 1607 Maguire left for the Netherlands. There Father Florence Conry informed him that James I would certainly arrest Tyrone should he go to London to press his claim that he held ownership in fee of O'Kane's country, and that Tyrconnell would be taken in Ireland. While these arrests were more possible than probable, Maguire, probably in August, sent urgent warning to the earls and the archdukes were concerned enough to finance his hire of a ship. When he arrived unexpectedly, Tyrconnell and even Tyrone were ready to go, hoping it seems to return with an army (of which Henry O'Neill's regiment would be the backbone) or else of securing through Spanish intercession reversal by James of the Anglicizing and protestantizing policies his Irish ministers now followed in Ulster. Tyrconnell took with him his son Hugh, less than a year old, in his haste leaving his pregnant countess behind in Kildare. His sister, Nuala, who had left her husband, Niall Garbh, when he deserted to the English, and Caffar and his wife, Rose, sailed also. Equinoctial gales drove the ship to land, not in Spain, but at Quilleboeuf, in the mouth of the Seine.<br>
<br>The &#145;flight of the earls&#146; caught the Dublin administration unawares. Lord Howth had, at tedious length and without impressing Salisbury or Chichester overmuch, given information of a conspiracy involving Tyrconnell, Maguire, Lord Delvin and others. Later Delvin would report that Tyrconnell had plotted with him to seize Dublin Castle, a confession that would test credulity by implicating Tyrone and Philip as well. The argument that the &#145;mandates&#146; episode, whereby named individuals were required to attend worship in the established church, had caused certain Old English to consider their loyalty and engage in serious plotting with the northern leaders is implausible.<br>
<br>In an extended period of leisure at Louvain over the Christmas of 1607, Tyrone and Tyrconnell set down justification for their flight in separate documents. To James they stressed the high-handed actions of his Irish ministers, Tyrone emphasizing fear for his life, Tyrconnell the pressure put upon him to abandon his religion. But, as Bagwell noted, Tyrconnell had temporal grievances that were real: rights and prerogatives unacknowledged; lands and fisheries allotted away; impoverishment; and seizure of his cattle and horses by the garrisons, whose soldiers were guilty of continuous outrages, all without redress. To Philip, on the other hand, they spoke of an Irish Catholic &#145;league&#146; formed by them and ready for action at Spain's command. They had, they said, negotiated with most of the Catholic nobles and gentry (alternatively it was with the towns) heretofore loyal to Elizabeth but now disillusioned by enforcement of the recusancy laws. These new-found allies would immediately on receiving some aid from Philip join the earls in a fresh uprising. There had been no occasion to inform Philip of this plan (which is very short on specifics) until then. These plots were no more substantial, as Philip and his first minister Lerma could see, than the alleged confederacies of the mid-sixteenth century, which had failed to interest Philip II or his astute ambassador in London, Quadra. Since then the two Hughs, O'Neill and O'Donnell, had won the support of Philip II, engaged as he was after 1580 in a Catholic crusade, and then of the perfervid Philip III. But now the latter and especially Lerma had been brought to recognize that the protestant powers were firmly established.<br>
<br>Philip then refused the party including Tyrconnell entry into Spain and they had to repair to the hospitality of the papal court. Reaching Rome on 9/19 April 1608, they were met at the Milvian Bridge by Archbishop Lombard of Armagh, who would now advocate peace rather than war with James. By this time Tyrconnell had been attainted, and thereafter his honours were forfeited. The pope showed them every honour, but the O'Donnell brothers very soon became victims of the Italian climate, Tyrconnell dying at the age of thirty-three in Rome, probably on 18/28 July (though his gravestone&#151;presumably erroneously&#151;gives a date two days later), and Caffar on 26 August/5 September. They were laid to rest in one grave in San Pietro in Montorio on the Janiculum. The four brothers, all so full of promise, Manus, Red Hugh, Rury, and Caffar, were gone, each cut off in his prime. So abruptly and tragically ended the O'Donnell lordship of Tyrconnell which had lasted for 400 years and which had had behind that another eight centuries of rule by the Cen&eacute;l Conaill, the dynasty which had also given ten high-kings to Tara. Now Donegal and Ulster would experience change of gravest consequence.<br>
<br>Tyrconnell's only son, <a name="cosubject_74430"></a><span class="headword">Hugh Albert O'Donnell</span>, styled second earl of Tyrconnell  (1606&#150;1642), <span class="occ">army officer in the Austrian service</span>, was born in Kildare Castle about October 1606. The blood of the earls of Tyrconnell, Kildare, Nottingham, and Argyll ran in his veins, but O'Donnell was his proudest title. Left behind at Louvain when in 1608 his father departed for Rome, he succeeded as titular earl of Tyrconnell at his father's death. In 1611 his aunt Nuala came from Rome, but her efforts to persuade James I to restore Hugh to his estates were in vain. Archduke Albert of Austria was sponsor at his confirmation, and he added Albert to his name. At the archducal court from 1613, he enrolled at Louvain University in 1621 and in May 1625 was made knight of Alc&aacute;ntara. The following November he was commissioned captain of a cavalry company and he was on garrison duty in Sichem between 1627 and 1630. He fought during the costly campaign in which Frederick Henry of Orange won Bois-le-Duc, was at the entry into Bruges, and in 1632 helped to repel the Dutch there; alongside John O'Neill, conde de Tiron, he also sought to keep control of episcopal appointments by Rome in Ulster and Connaught, with limited success.<br>
<br>In 1626 Philip IV toyed with a project to launch another invasion of Ireland and set up Tyrconnell and John O'Neill, titular earl of Tyrone, as joint leaders of a Catholic republic. Conry, now archbishop, proposed a match between Tyrconnell's sister, Mary Stuart, and Tyrone, something the unconventional Mary did not favour. Finally, Philip decided against expanding the Anglo-Spanish war, cancelled the invasion, and concluded a new treaty with England (1630).<br>
<br>The O'Donnell&#150;O'Neill jealousy was maintained to the end. But Tyrconnell was at last (1632) given his own infantry regiment and proceeded to recruit fifteen companies of Irish. In that year he married Anne Marguerite de Heynin, a kinswoman of the last duke of Guise. They had no children. In 1638 he was ordered with his regiment to Spain and perished when the French set his ship on fire, apparently in August 1642. Tyrconnell consistently maintained his claims to the title O'Donnell, to lordship over lower Connaught and Sligo, and to the earldom of Tyrconnell. He was said to be a polished courtier and an excellent and brave soldier, but without the ripe judgement of John O'Neill. With him the final curtain falls on the long drama of the O'Donnells as princes of Tyrconnell.<br>
