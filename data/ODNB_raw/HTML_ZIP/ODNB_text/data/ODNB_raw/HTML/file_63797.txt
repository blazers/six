<span class="headword">Charleson,  Ian</span>  (1949&#150;1990), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 11 August 1949 in the Eastern General Hospital, Leith, near Edinburgh, the son of John Thomson Charleson, a printer, and his wife, Jane Turner Attenburgh. He grew up in one of Edinburgh's working-class tenements but won a scholarship to the Royal High School where he excelled as a singer, becoming the &#145;star treble&#146; of &#145;a school choir fine enough to win awards and broadcast quite regularly on the Scottish region of the BBC Home Service&#146;  (C. MacDonald, &#145;Too many records&#146;, <span class="italic">International Record Review</span>, 3/3, June 2002, 96). He then won a further scholarship to Edinburgh University, where he began a degree course in architecture. However, performing with the university's dramatic society, he discovered, in his own words, that he possessed the ability &#145;to make people laugh and make them cry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 9 Jan 1990), and after leaving university in 1970 he moved to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA).<br>
<br>Although initially Charleson found the change from amateur to professional acting difficult&#151;&#145;At college I had been a very flashy, noisy actor, but at LAMDA they told me to lose all of that brashness and do it from the inside&#146;  (Morley), he would later recall&#151;he was taken directly from the academy into Frank Dunlop's Young Vic company in 1972. His roles there included, prophetically, Hamlet in Tom Stoppard's <span class="italic">Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead</span>, as well as a notable Jimmy Porter in John Osborne's <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span>; and in 1975 he played Shakespeare's Hamlet for the first time, for the Cambridge Theatre Company in a production which &#145;Nobody saw &hellip; but [from which] I learned a lot&#146;  (ibid.). He made his West End d&eacute;but later that year, in Simon Gray's <span class="italic">Otherwise Engaged</span>, and two years later joined the National Theatre Company, playing Octavius in <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span> and Peregrine in Jonson's <span class="italic">Volpone</span>.<br>
<br>In 1978 Charleson moved to the Royal Shakespeare Company, for which his roles ranged from Ariel to the defeated screenwriter Laurence Vail in <span class="italic">Once in a Lifetime</span> by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart, the first of many American roles. He also appeared in the original Other Place production of Pam Gems's <span class="italic">Piaf</span>, staying with the production when it transferred to the Aldwych and from there to the West End in 1980. In the audience for one of these performances at Wyndham's Theatre were the director Hugh Hudson and producer David Puttnam, in search of an actor to play Eric Liddell in the film <span class="italic">Chariots of Fire</span> (1981).<br>
<br>The role of Liddell&#151;Scottish missionary and Olympic sprint gold medallist, whose observance of the sabbath threatens to jeopardize his athletic career&#151;was not written specifically for Charleson but might well have been, and not only because, in his own phlegmatic words, &#145;There weren't too many young Scots actors who could run really fast&#146;  (Morley). His striking combination of beauty and detachment, passion and aloofness perfectly suited the part, and was matched by his imaginative commitment to it&#151;the sermons Liddell preaches in the film were devised by Charleson himself, using texts he drew from what David Puttnam called &#145;the most closely annotated copy [of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>] I've ever seen&#146;  (Shipman and Puttnam). Indeed, Liddell's widow thought these scenes even improved her husband: &#145;You know&#146;, she said:<blockquote>Eric's great sadness was that he was a poor preacher&#151;he had bags of conviction but lacked a way with words. Your Mr. Charleson made it all come right. He said what Eric always wanted to say, and to millions of people all around the world. (ibid.)</blockquote>Although the film won the award for best picture at the 1981 Oscars, neither Charleson nor his co-star Ben Cross became major stars as a result (indeed, initial reports of Charleson's death in one national newspaper accidentally carried a picture of Cross). One rather similar film role soon followed, as another missionary, the Revd Charlie Andrews, in <span class="italic">Gandhi</span>. His performance received great acclaim for what its director, Richard Attenborough, called its &#145;simple, true and seemingly effortless&#146; acting  (de Jongh and Attenborough).<br>
<br>Television work after <span class="italic">Chariots of Fire</span> included leading parts in two of Jonathan Miller's BBC Shakespeare productions (Bertram in <span class="italic">All's Well that Ends Well</span> and another Octavius) and Major Archer in an adaptation of J. G. Farrell's <span class="italic">Troubles</span>, as well as several American miniseries, but Charleson's last eight years were dominated by four major roles&#151;three of them American&#151;at the National Theatre.<br>
<br>In 1982, while the success of <span class="italic">Chariots of Fire</span> was still being felt, Charleson was cast as Sky Masterson&#151;the role associated with Marlon Brando&#151;in Richard Eyre's revival of <span class="italic">Guys and Dolls</span>. His &#145;deliciously smooth and sexy&#146; performance  (Benedict) was distinguished by his &#145;romantic grace&#146;  (de Jongh and Attenborough) and the quality of his light tenor voice, a &#145;pure and wholly unaffected&#146; instrument, unspoilt since his days as a boy soprano  (Eyre), which Eyre had first heard him using at parties. (It is a measure of the affection in which his Sky was held that one of the first benefit performances for the posthumous Ian Charleson Trust was a <span class="italic">Guys and Dolls</span> which managed to reassemble virtually all the other members of that first cast, some of whom returned especially from other work abroad.) This production was followed in 1984 by a &#145;mesmerising&#146;  (Benedict) performance of the lead role in Sam Shepard's <span class="italic">Fool for Love</span> opposite Julie Walters.<br>
<br>In 1986 Charleson discovered that he was HIV positive: his initial reaction was to abandon acting entirely, but, with the knowledge a secret to all but his closest friends&#151;as it remained until after his death&#151;he returned to the National two years later to play the alcoholic former football star Brick in Howard Davies's production of Tennessee Williams's <span class="italic">Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</span>. This performance, in which, ironically, he played a man struggling to hide his homosexuality, seemed to many critics to uncover a new &#145;weight and depth&#146;  (Eyre) in Charleson's work. In the words of one he &#145;plumbed the painful depths of a role which can seem passive and pallid in lesser hands&#146;  (Wolf). At this time Charleson discussed with Eyre the roles he was most keen to move on to. The list was exclusively Shakespearian: Richard II, Angelo, Benedick, Hamlet. It expanded by the time of his death to encompass even Lear, but, in the event, only one of these proved possible.<br>
<br>After Daniel Day-Lewis's sudden withdrawal from the title role of Eyre's Olivier production of <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, Charleson, with the memory of Brick still fresh, was the obvious replacement. Indeed, his considerably greater stage experience&#151;including that Cambridge <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> nearly fifteen years before&#151;would have made him a more natural choice to open the production, had he not been suffering from the effects of AIDS-related illnesses and therapies. He was still ill, of course, when he took over the role: performance photos show a face made puffy by heavily swollen sinuses, while the rehearsals were interspersed with painful acupuncture and chemotherapy. The sinus complaint, and the operation which preceded it, were used by the theatre as an explanation for Charleson's appearance and his evident fatigue; but it seems to have been clear to many witnesses that his Hamlet drew much of its power from his illness and his expectation of death. Although, as John Peter observed, writing of a November performance, not long before Charleson was forced to retire, this &#145;brilliant exercise in mature judgment&#146; was marked by &#145;restless, inquisitive &hellip; intelligence&#146;  (J. Peter, <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, 12 Nov 1989), it was also that of an actor whose own suffering had merged with that of his character. By the final performance, watched by many who knew that it would be his last, &#145;he wasn't playing the part, he became it &hellip; He stood at the curtain call like an exhausted boxer, battered by applause&#146;  (Eyre). His inability to perform thereafter seems to have hastened his end, and he died in his west London home less than eight weeks after that last curtain call, on 6 January 1990 at the age of forty.<br>
<br>Any assessment of Charleson's work must be written in the knowledge that much of the best of it was surely still to come: by general consent, his last two performances, as Brick and Hamlet, achieved a depth missing from his earlier work. But these were also his only major roles after the diagnosis of HIV, so this gravity perhaps went hand in hand with the illness. Although this development was possible, then, it is his earlier work which supplies a more representative picture. In these roles he showed himself to be an actor with a great natural range: one who displayed immense charm, grace, and lightness in musicals and comedies, but who could find a fierce, sardonic passion in his more serious work, all of which stemmed, in Richard Attenborough's words, from a &#145;latent emotion he could express with the utmost grace and taste&#146;  (de Jongh and Attenborough).<br>
