<span class="headword">Digges,  West</span>  (1725?&#150;1786), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was probably born in 1725, the elder of the two sons (there was no daughter) of Thomas Digges, gentleman, of Chilham Castle, Kent, and his wife, Elizabeth West (<i>bap</i>. 1695, <i>d</i>. 1762), who were married on 18 August 1724. George Colman the younger claimed in his <span class="italic">Random Records</span> that Digges was the illegitimate son of Elizabeth's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29087/', "John West, seventh baron and later first Earl De La Warr (1693&#150;1766)")</script>, but as Elizabeth clearly identifies West Digges as the elder son of her marriage to Thomas Digges this can be discounted.<br>
<br>Thomas Digges's income had since 1727 been administered by trustees, possibly connected to failed investments in the South Sea Company, and the young West Digges was expected to be guided in his career by his uncle Lord De La Warr. According to his mother's will, with De La Warr's help Digges obtained a commission in the army, but &#145;by his Extravagance suffered a Commission of Bankruptcy to be issued against him&#146; and &#145;instead of applying himself to any Profession or Calling worthy of his Birth has betaken himself to the publick Stage to the great Disgrace of himself and Family&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/875, sig 192). The first public notice of West Digges as an actor occurred when he appeared on stage at the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin on 29 November 1749, playing Jaffeir in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>. His success was immediate, and he soon added Hamlet, Lear, Antony, Romeo, George Barnwell, and Macheath to his repertory, attaining overwhelming popularity for six seasons and attracting the attention of David Garrick. However, in November 1754 Digges was unwittingly party to a political riot at Smock Alley for refusing to repeat a volatile political passage in James Miller's <span class="italic">Mahomet the Impostor</span>.<br>
<br>In spring 1756 Digges performed major roles at the Canongate Theatre in Edinburgh; by autumn he had become manager there. His flamboyant style led him to puff his first production, John Home's tragedy <span class="italic">Douglas</span>; the success of the play created a national furore, fuelled by a clergy apprehensive of secular entertainment. Although it was condemned by the Edinburgh presbytery, the tragedy enjoyed unprecedented success. Digges remained at Canongate for three years as manager, but in 1758 a quarrel with his musicians over salary precipitated a strike and a series of six pamphlets airing the dispute. When his partner, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64362/', "Sarah Ward (1726/7&#150;1771)")</script>, with whom he had been living since 1752, left him, thus breaking the contract both had with the theatre, the Canongate's owners dismissed Digges.<br>
<br>Digges's personal life consistently impinged upon his prospects for success; he was damaged both by unsatisfactory relationships with women and by his consistent extravagance, which kept him in debt throughout his life. His marriage to Mary Wakeling, on 3 March 1746 at All Hallows, London Wall, though short-lived, coloured his future relationships with women. His liaison between 1752 and 1759 with the actress Sarah Ward, which produced at least six children, ended with mutual recriminations, revealed in <span class="italic">Letters which Passed between Mr. West Digges, Comedian, and Mrs. Sarah Ward, 1752&#150;1759</span>. A later stormy relationship with the actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2036/', "George Anne Bellamy (1731?&#150;1788)")</script> lasted several years, during which the couple lived on Newhaven Road in Bonington, near Edinburgh. Digges's impecuniousness placed him in situations both embarrassing and criminal; he was forced to flee his creditors (1753, 1759), suffer arrest (1772), and endure imprisonment (1777).<br>
<br>Despite these distractions, Digges pursued his career energetically, especially in Edinburgh, where he was always warmly welcomed. He performed in Edinburgh in 1759 and 1762 and in Dublin in 1760 and 1761. His apparent inactivity for a few years after 1762 may be related to his inheritance from his mother, whose will stipulated that he was entitled to a half-share of her South Sea stock, worth &pound;7312 7<i>s</i>., if he could assure his younger brother, Dudley, that he would give up the stage and discharge his debts. If he did retire, that retirement was brief; he was acting at Limerick in 1767, and in August 1771 he resumed managing at the Canongate. Extant stage bills indicate that he acted at Limerick again in 1774, at Cork in 1774, at York in 1775, and at Liverpool in 1776. Digges made his London d&eacute;but in the title role of Joseph Addison's <span class="italic">Cato</span> at the Haymarket on 14 August 1777. During that season he performed a number of his celebrated roles, including Wolsey in <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span>, Sir John Brute in John Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Provoked Wife</span>, and Macheath in John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>; the next season he performed Caratach in George Colman's version of Beaumont and Fletcher's <span class="italic">Bonduca</span>, called &#145;an excellent piece of acting&#146;  (Colman, 1.255). The critic from the <span class="italic">London Chronicle</span> of 14 August 1777, although noting his antiquated style of acting and citing &#145;the extreme difference between the stile of the old school &hellip; and the modern&#146;, could not deny the power of Digges's performance, admitting that he &#145;awed us into esteem and admiration&#146;. Digges performed in London until 1781, and from 1781 to 1783 he acted in Edinburgh, Cork, and Limerick. From 1782 to 1784 he was a member of Daly's company in Dublin, where he suffered a stroke on 2 July 1784 during a rehearsal of <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>.<br>
<br>Digges was a commanding figure on stage. John O'Keeffe remembered that &#145;he had a noble presence, a fine figure, large and manly; a full expressive and pleasing face, and ruddy complexion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Recollections of the Life of John O'Keeffe</span>, 1826, 1.290). Victor remarked that &#145;almost all the Requisites to form a great Actor seemed to unite [in him]; every Advantage of Art and Nature, except an harmonious Voice&#146;  (Victor, 1.147). James Boswell wrote to Garrick that Digges &#145;threw open to me the portals of Theatrical Enchantment&#146;  (Yale MS L 569), while Colman mentions that, as Wolsey, he drew tears &#145;even from the eyes of flinty-hearted critics&#146;  (Colman, 1.255).<br>
<br>Digges died on 11 November 1786 at his home on the Coal Quay in Cork and was buried the following day in the cathedral of St Fin Barre in Cork.<br>
