<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Burnett, Sir  Robert Lindsay</span>  (1887&#150;1959), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Old Deer, Aberdeenshire, on 22 July 1887, the fourth son of John Alexander Burnett, of Kemnay, Aberdeenshire, and his wife, Charlotte Susan, daughter of Arthur Forbes Gordon, of Rayne, Aberdeenshire. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32188/', "Sir Charles Stuart Burnett")</script>, air chief marshal, was an elder brother. At the early age of seven he announced his intention of joining the navy, and after education at Bedford School and Eastman's he entered the <i>Britannia</i> in 1903. His academic progress was undistinguished, but he showed great promise as an all-round athlete, and after reaching the rank of lieutenant in 1910 he qualified as a physical training instructor. In the ensuing eight years he served mainly in small ships, saw action in the Heligoland bight and at the Dogger Bank engagement, gained his first command (a torpedo boat) in 1915, and subsequently went on to command destroyers with the Grand Fleet until 1918. In 1915 he married Ethel Constance, the daughter of R. H. Shaw. They had no children.<br>
<br>With subsequently only one break of two years in command of a sloop on the South Africa station, Burnett was continually employed until 1928 in physical training appointments, being promoted commander in 1923 while acting as secretary to the Sports Control Board. He did much in this period towards reorganizing the physical training branch of the navy. He himself also won the sabre championship at the royal tournament and became a qualified referee for association and rugby football, hockey, water polo, and boxing. In addition, he developed his admirable bent as a producer of amateur theatricals.<br>
<br>Burnett gained his second selective promotion, to captain, in December 1930 at the conclusion of a successful commission as executive officer of the <i>Rodney</i>. In the ensuing eleven years in that rank he commanded a destroyer flotilla on the China station, did two years as the director of physical training and sports, commanded the cruiser flagship of the South African squadron, and finally was appointed commodore of the royal naval barracks at Chatham in 1939, where he had the arduous task of mobilizing the personnel of the east country manning port for war.<br>
<br>Although Burnett himself had more than once in his time as a captain expressed surprise at his progressive promotions, his superiors fully appreciated his zeal, energy, and ability, and after only eighteen months at Chatham he was specially promoted to the acting rank of rear-admiral in November 1940 (confirmed two months later) on appointment as flag officer of the Home Fleet mine-laying squadron engaged on the hazardous task of laying the deep minefield in northern waters. On completion of this task in 1942 he became flag officer, Home Fleet destroyer flotillas, and a year later flag officer, 10th cruiser squadron, continuing in this appointment on promotion to vice-admiral (1943) until he left the fleet in mid-1944 to become the commander-in-chief, south Atlantic, responsible for the security of the sea route round the Cape.<br>
<br>It was especially during those fateful years of 1941 to 1944, when a hard-pressed Royal Navy faced its greatest challenge, that Burnett rendered outstanding service and played a leading part in the saga of the Arctic convoys, when the enemy could choose its own time and place at which to bring superior force to bear upon the lifeline to Russia. These circumstances called for the physical endurance, capable leadership, and readiness to fight back whatever the odds which Burnett notably possessed. His indomitable spirit and simple philosophy of immediate aggressive tactics inspired others and gained for him the trust and loyalty of those who served under him in the course of these exhausting operations to reach north Russia and return.<br>
<br>There were occasions on which Burnett's determination was particularly put to the test. In September 1942 he fought a convoy of forty ships through in the face of four days of sustained submarine and massed air attack for a loss of thirteen merchantmen, and then saw the returning empty convoy back. On new year's eve 1942, in the Barents Sea, his covering force of two cruisers finally managed to reach another convoy with such an offensive impact that the greatly superior enemy surface force retired in disorder and the merchant ships reached port unscathed. On Boxing day a year later, off North Cape, again in midwinter, he so skilfully handled his covering force of three cruisers that the <i>Scharnhorst</i> was twice forced to turn back from the convoy without achieving any success, and was finally delivered up to destruction by the commander-in-chief's flagship.<br>
<br>Burnett was promoted admiral in 1946 and in the following year took up his last appointment, the Plymouth command, which he held for three years, being placed on the retired list in May 1950. He was subsequently chairman of the White Fish Authority for four years.<br>
<br>Throughout his service Burnett was sustained by a firm religious belief from which he got much help and comfort, and he expected others to try to measure up to his own high moral standards and example of officer-like behaviour and appearance. He loved the navy, was easily moved to emotion, and was a first-class speaker in a manner which carried conviction. He died suddenly at 116 Pall Mall, Westminster, London, on 2 July 1959, his wife surviving him.<br>
<br>During his career he was successively appointed OBE (1925), CB (1942), to the DSO (1943), KBE (1944), KCB and CStJ (1945), and GBE (1950). He received an honorary LLD from Aberdeen (1944) and high orders from the Soviet Union, Greece, and the Netherlands.<br>
