<span class="headword">Atwood,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Peter]</span>  (1643&#150;1712), <span class="occ">Dominican friar</span>, was born in Warwickshire. His mother's maiden name was Pitts, a name he adopted later as an alias. He was a pupil at St Omer in the Spanish Netherlands, in the Jesuit college founded by Father Robert Persons for the education of English Catholic youths. He entered the Dominican order and was professed at the English Dominican priory at Bornhem, near Antwerp, on 4 February 1664. Having completed his studies in philosophy he went on to Louvain to study theology in 1666. He was ordained priest in May 1669 and returned to Bornhem until 1673. In that year he was working in London, where he remained for most of his active priestly life. On 23 October 1680 he was arrested on the evidence of Thomas Dangerfield, an associate of Titus Oates, and imprisoned on the grounds of involvement in the Popish Plot. Atwood was tried before the king's bench on 8 February 1681 and condemned for his priesthood on the testimony of Dangerfield and Oates. On 10 February he was sentenced to death for treason, a judgment which he received &#145;very contentedly&#146;  (Luttrell, 1.67). He was one of eleven English Dominicans cited as conspirators by Oates and his confederates. On 15 February 1681 Atwood was reprieved by Charles II, allegedly as he was about to step onto the hurdle which was to draw him to Tyburn. It is reported that he felt his failure to suffer martyrdom to be a great misfortune. He was once more arrested in 1697 and condemned to death but was released in 1698. He acted as vicar of the English Dominican provincial from 1697 to 1708. He died in London on 12 August 1712 and was buried in the churchyard of St Giles-in-the-Fields, London, next to Father Albert Anderson, who had also been accused and tried for association with the Popish Plot in 1681.<br>
