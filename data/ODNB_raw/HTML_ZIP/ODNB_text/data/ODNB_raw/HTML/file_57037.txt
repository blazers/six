<span class="headword">Chipman,  Ward</span>  (1754&#150;1824), <span class="occ">lawyer and local politician</span>, was born on 30 July 1754 in Marblehead, Massachusetts, the sixth of the twelve children of John Chipman (1722&#150;1768), a lawyer, and Elizabeth Brown. Chipman entered Harvard College in 1766 and, upon graduation in 1770, delivered the commencement address. After studying law under Jonathan Sewall, the attorney-general of Massachusetts, he practised in the vice-admiralty court and secured a position in the Boston custom house. The American War of Independence dealt a crushing blow to Chipman's prospects. He was the eldest surviving son of a distinguished but not wealthy family and, after his father's death in 1768, he looked to Sewall for advancement. Since Sewall was a devoted loyalist, so perforce was Chipman. In 1774 he retreated with Sewall to Boston and helped prepare a series of anti-revolutionary tracts. In 1775 he joined Sewall in London, but in the following year eagerly accepted a minor post in New York as deputy to the muster-master-general of the loyalist forces. Admitted to the New York bar, he earned considerable fees in the vice-admiralty court and served as paymaster for several loyalist regiments.<br>
<br>Like most loyalists, Chipman was devastated by the treaty of Paris. He hoped to remain in New York until he learned that loyalists would be prohibited from practising law. He was given a small pension and returned to England, unsuccessfully seeking further compensation. In 1784 those loyalists settled north of the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia petitioned the British government for the partition of the colony and Chipman lobbied on their behalf. He hoped to become attorney-general of the new colony of New Brunswick but had to be satisfied with the more lowly (and unpaid) position of solicitor-general. In 1784 he travelled to New Brunswick with the first governor, Thomas Carleton.<br>
<br>For the next few years Chipman acted as Carleton's legal adviser. He drafted the charter for Saint John and became first recorder of the city and a justice of the peace. He assisted in drafting the New Brunswick legal code and the rules of procedure for grand juries and the inferior courts, becoming clerk of the crown on circuits and advocate-general of the vice-admiralty court. None of his multiple offices carried a salary but they generated fees and Chipman, one of nine lawyers who formed the New Brunswick bar in 1785, established a prestigious law office in Saint John, which became a training ground for lawyers. For half a century the bench and the bar of New Brunswick were dominated by his students. His approach to the law was extremely conservative. He upheld the complicated and antiquated system of common-law pleading and the use of the death penalty for a wide range of offences. He also insisted on an excessively high scale of fees.<br>
<br>Chipman found slavery morally repugnant and in 1800 defended without fee a runaway slave. He convinced two of the four supreme court judges of the illegality of slavery, creating a degree of legal uncertainty which contributed to the withering away of slavery in New Brunswick. In 1816 he persuaded the government to give land to black refugees from the American south, although he recommended 50 acres rather than the 200 acres normally given white settlers. In 1786 he prosecuted a case which established that crimes against native peoples would not go unpunished. Nevertheless, as a commissioner of the New England Company (and after 1806 as secretary&#150;treasurer), he supported its policy of segregating Indian children from their parents and turning a blind eye to the incompetence and rapacity of the Anglican minister who ran the company's school. A member of the Church of England, Chipman prepared the bill incorporating Trinity Church in Saint John and was for many years a vestryman. He also served on the board of directors of the public grammar school in Saint John and as one of the board of trustees of the Madras Schools, and helped to draft the original, restrictive charter for the College (later the University) of New Brunswick.<br>
<br>Although conservative in politics, Chipman was more moderate on religious issues than most of the loyalist &eacute;lite, partly because on 24 October 1786 he married Elizabeth Hazen, the daughter of a wealthy, non-Anglican merchant family. The Chipmans' impressive home became the social centre of Saint John and when Prince Edward (fourth son of George III) visited the city in 1794 he stayed there. An enthusiastic advocate of the commercial interests of Saint John, Chipman invested in a flour mill and assisted in organizing the Bank of New Brunswick. Yet he was not popular among the ordinary citizens. He was elected to the first assembly in 1785 only after many of the votes for his opponent were disallowed. He consistently supported the governor, even in the decision to transfer the capital from Saint John to Fredericton, and in 1793 he was soundly beaten in Saint John, though returned for Northumberland county. In 1795 he was again defeated in Saint John and left without a seat in the assembly, which consistently refused to pay him a salary as solicitor-general.<br>
<br>During the 1790s Chipman's legal practice languished, but after 1796 he received a substantial salary as the British agent before the commission to decide which river should define the boundary between Maine (then part of Massachusetts) and New Brunswick. For nearly three years he worked at preparing the British case, which convinced the commissioners that the boundary should be the Sainte Croix River. During this period he renewed contacts with two of his sisters who had married Salem merchants and wisely invested his salary in ships owned by his brothers-in-law. By 1798 he was on the road to solvency but he found the return to an inactive life in New Brunswick disheartening. His legal practice occupied little time and in 1802 he again stood unsuccessfully for the assembly. He lived extravagantly and fell deeply into debt. In 1807 he became a member of the provincial council but played only a minor part in its deliberations. In 1809 he became a puisne judge, earning a reputation for severity and rigidity in his decisions. After 1815 he also served as the British agent in the dispute over the northern boundary between Maine and New Brunswick. He successfully disguised the weakness of the British case and the dispute was eventually referred for arbitration to the king of the Netherlands. Afflicted by gout, he increasingly delegated his work as agent to his only child, <a href="#cosubject_54913">Ward Chipman jun. [<i>see below</i>]</a>. In April 1823 Chipman became president of the council, but on 9 February 1824 he died, in Fredericton.<br>
<br>One of the most influential of the loyalist founders of New Brunswick, Chipman helped to convince the imperial government to create New Brunswick and played an important role in establishing the municipal, judicial, and educational institutions of the colony. He critically influenced the evolution of the legal profession and his work on various commissions helped to establish the colony's boundaries. But his commitment to New Brunswick was always ambivalent. Having tied his career to the loyalist cause, he had no choice but to go into exile in 1783. Yet he frequently visited the land of his birth, renewed his ties with his relatives in Massachusetts, and sent his son to Harvard. Disillusioned by the 1783 treaty and by the imperial government's policy of benign neglect, Chipman was frustrated at having to pass his life in a colonial backwater, perpetually struggling against insolvency. Yet he passed on his loyalist ideology to his son, <a name="cosubject_54913"></a><span class="headword">Ward Chipman</span>  (1787&#150;1851), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>. Born in Saint John, New Brunswick, on 10 July 1787, Ward graduated from Harvard and then studied at the Inner Temple in London. He returned to Saint John and on 24 March 1817 married Elizabeth Wright, the daughter of the collector of customs; they had no children. In 1820 he was elected to the assembly and in 1823 became solicitor-general. In 1825 he became a puisne judge and in 1834 chief justice, a position he held until 1850. He inherited his father's judicial and political conservatism, but he was a wealthy and aloof figure fighting to preserve a system of values that was increasingly unpopular. By the time he died in Saint John on 26 November 1851, the colony had changed out of all recognition and the loyalist &eacute;lite had lost most of their influence.<br>
