<span class="headword">Graves,  John James</span>  (1832&#150;1903), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and advocate of teachers' associations</span>, was born on 15 January 1832 at Chesterton, near Cambridge, the son of John and Sarah Graves. He was the eldest of eight children, six of whom survived childhood. His father was a shoemaker who in 1835 moved to Cambridge, where John James attended the national school. In 1844 the family moved to Meppershall, Bedfordshire, where his father took charge of the village school, with his two oldest sons acting as monitors. In 1846 John James (now aged fourteen) went to London, where he attended the central school of the National Society at Westminster before becoming an assistant at St Anne's Anglican charity school in Soho. In 1847 he became an assistant at St Paul's School, Cambridge, and in 1848 was appointed master of the school at Saleby in Lincolnshire.<br>
<br>On 3 March 1851 Graves married Elizabeth Ann Lister of Saleby and in the same year he and his wife were appointed to take joint charge of the school at Hanging Houghton, near Lamport, Northamptonshire. Graves had attended a teachers' mutual improvement society at Cambridge in 1847&#150;8 and, on moving to Lamport, joined the Northampton Church Teachers' Association which had been founded in 1846 with clergy support to hold monthly lectures and demonstration lessons. He also attended the first meeting of the Associated Body of Church Schoolmasters (ABCS) held in London in 1853, and in 1855, as secretary of the Northampton association, put before the ABCS a resolution in favour of admitting Anglican clergymen to membership. This was defeated by a large majority but, despite this defeat and his relative youthfulness, Graves was elected secretary of the ABCS in 1857. While remaining a firm supporter of the church system of education, he became a champion of teaching as a profession in its own right. He vigorously defended the teachers against the criticisms made in the Newcastle report (1861) but the imposition of the revised code in 1862 seemed to demonstrate the futility of the teachers' associations and Graves resigned as secretary of the ABCS in 1863. He was, however, re-elected three years later and re-formed the local associations into a General Association of Church Teachers, which played a key role in the movement towards a united profession.<br>
<br>The extension of the franchise in 1867 stimulated discussion of the need for universal, compulsory elementary education and in 1868 the church schoolmasters formed a London association to bring their views before parliament. In April 1870 a joint conference was held with the nonconformist teachers' associations which agreed to support a general system of <span class="roman">Bible</span> teaching, with a conscience clause similar to that adopted in the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of that year. In June a meeting representing teachers of all denominations agreed to establish a National Union of Elementary Teachers and elected Graves as its first president. His presidential address in September 1870 combined good sense and idealism in equal proportions. The union dropped the word &#145;Elementary&#146; from its title in 1889 and Graves continued to serve on the executive of the union until 1900. In that year he was able to claim that many improvements had taken place in the status and position of the teacher, including better salaries, pensions on retirement, modifications in the code, and the abolition of payment by results.<br>
<br>Graves was chairman of the Schoolmistress Newspaper Company, one of the founders of the Church Teachers' Benevolent Institution, and several times president of the Northampton and District Teachers' Association. He was, however, content to remain as the village schoolmaster and choirmaster at Lamport. His wife Elizabeth died in 1882 and on 21 May 1885 he married Georgiana Perkins (<i>d</i>. 1919), schoolteacher at nearby Maidwell, when he was fifty-three and she thirty-three. With his first wife he had two sons, but the eldest died in 1874 and the second in infancy; there were no children of his second marriage. In the 1880s Graves was secretary of the Brixworth Conservative Association and in the 1890s served on the Brixworth Board of Guardians. He retired from the mastership of Lamport school in 1901 and died at Scaldwell, Northamptonshire, on 31 January 1903, of pernicious anaemia. He was buried at Lamport, where a memorial plaque was installed in the church by his fellow teachers. He was a man of firm convictions but without strong personal ambition, and it was said of him that &#145;he worked simply for teachers&#146;.<br>
