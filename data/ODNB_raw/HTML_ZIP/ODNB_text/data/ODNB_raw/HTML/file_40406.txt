<span class="headword">Robertson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Saunders]</span>,  Christina</span>  (1796&#150;1854), <span class="occ">miniature and portrait painter</span>, was born at Kinghorn, Fife, on 17 December 1796, the daughter of a Scottish coach painter. She seems to have been taught to paint by her uncle, the miniaturist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24619/', "George Sanders (1774&#150;1846)")</script>. It was probably Sanders who steered her towards her first patrons, about 1819, and oversaw her swift rise to success in London, primarily as a miniaturist but also as a portrait painter in oil and watercolour. Over the next ten years she established a large aristocratic clientele, who were prepared to pay considerable prices for her work. Many of her earliest sitters came from distinguished Scottish families, and as well as exhibiting at the Royal Academy from 1823 to 1844 she was made an honorary member of the Royal Scottish Academy, at which she exhibited from 1829 to 1845. A selection of engravings after her portraits of society figures at this period were included in <span class="italic">The portrait gallery of distinguished females including beauties of the courts of George IV and William IV with memoirs by J. Burke</span> (ed. E. Bull, 1833).<br>
<br>Christina married James Robertson, an artist, on 23 May 1823 and together they had eight children, of whom four survived into adulthood. Leaving her husband and children in England, Christina Robertson travelled extensively in the 1830s, working in Paris between 1836 and 1838 and extending her range of clients to include a cosmopolitan &eacute;lite of European society. In 1839 she was drawn to work in St Petersburg, possibly because of the successful sale of her work there by an agent or because she intended fulfilling a commission to paint several large-scale oil portraits to replace the many paintings damaged in a fire at the Winter Palace in 1837. She stayed in St Petersburg until 1841, when she was awarded the title of honorary member of the Imperial Academy of Arts for her full-length oil portraits of the Empress Alexandra and three of her daughters, which were shown there that year. Christina Robertson had also been appointed to paint Tsar Nicholas I in 1840; other commissions at the imperial court soon followed. Late in 1841 she broke off her visit to St Petersburg, at the height of her success, to return to London, where she continued to maintain a studio and to exhibit at the Royal Academy until 1844. She exhibited a historical subject, <span class="italic">The Meeting of Amy Robsart and the Lord Leicester</span> (exh. Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg) at the British Institution in 1847, showing that she was not unaware of changing tastes in British pictures at the time. When she returned to St Petersburg in 1849, however, it was once again as an oil portraitist that she achieved success, painting portraits of the tsar's daughters-in-law and copies of the earlier portraits of his daughters for the Romanov gallery in the Winter Palace. Although only one of these portraits was paid for she painted a steady stream of watercolours in her final years, which staved off financial hardship and also marked the apogee of her stylistic achievement, being more complex in composition and freer in handling than the work she produced during her first visit to Russia.<br>
<br>Christina Robertson died in St Petersburg on 30 April 1854, her husband having predeceased her, and was buried at the Volkhov Lutheran cemetery. Her rapid descent into obscurity has been explained in part by the strained relationship between Britain and Russia during the Crimean War, at the time of her death. Recent critics have reassessed her achievements and, while acknowledging that her work is not of the first order, have recognized that her miniatures, watercolours, and paintings are &#145;above all of interest as historical and artistic documents&#146;  (Farr, 15). This reappraisal culminated in an important exhibition of Christina Robertson's work at Edinburgh City Art Centre in 1996. A significant group of her paintings is in the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, and her account book and a self-portrait in miniature, dating from about 1822, are preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.<br>
