<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cheyne, Sir  (William) Watson</span>, first baronet  (1852&#150;1932), <span class="occ">bacteriologist and surgeon</span>, was born at sea, off Hobart Town, Tasmania, on 14 December 1852, the only child of Andrew Cheyne (<i>d</i>. 1867), of Ollaberry, Shetland, captain in the merchant navy, and his wife, Eliza (<i>d</i>. 1856), daughter of William Watson, minister of the united parishes of Fetlar and North Yell. After the death of his mother Cheyne was brought up by an aunt and uncle on Fetlar, one of the Shetland Islands.<br>
<br>His early education took place there and he subsequently attended Aberdeen grammar school, and King's College, Aberdeen. In 1871 he entered Edinburgh University to study medicine, despite his family's desire for him to enter the clergy. Cheyne was anxious to go to sea like his father, and through studying medicine he hoped to gain a position as ship's surgeon. At Edinburgh he excelled in his studies, especially chemistry, and won twelve medals. In 1872&#150;3 he attended the lectures given by Joseph Lister, and he won the first prize for the course. He then became Lister's dresser.<br>
<br>Cheyne graduated MB, CM, in 1875. Following this he studied under A. C. Theodore Billroth in Vienna and Freidrich Daniel von Recklinghausen in Strasbourg. On his return to Edinburgh he became house surgeon to Lister. He embarked on bacteriological research and in 1877 was awarded the Syme bacteriological scholarship, worth &pound;100 a year for two years. He became demonstrator of anatomy at Edinburgh in the same year.<br>
<br>In 1877 Cheyne accompanied Lister to King's College Hospital, London, where Lister had been appointed to the chair of clinical surgery. There they encountered a mixture of hostility and apathy towards their work from staff and students alike. Lack of opportunities in hospital and private practice led Cheyne to consider a career in the Indian Medical Service (IMS), but Lister paid him a retaining fee of &pound;200 a year to act as his private assistant and to administer anaesthetics during operations. Cheyne found ample time for research in his early years at King's. In 1879 he passed the examinations for the membership and fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons, and in 1881 the college awarded him the Jacksonian prize, for a dissertation on antiseptic surgery.<br>
<br>As a surgeon Cheyne rose to a distinguished position. In 1880 he was appointed assistant surgeon at King's; he became surgeon in 1887, professor of the principles and practice of surgery in 1891, and professor of clinical surgery in 1902. Active in the Royal College of Surgeons he was Hunterian professor of surgery and pathology in 1892. He delivered the Bradshaw lecture in 1908 and the Hunterian oration on the subject of wound treatment in 1915. He also served on the college's court of examiners and was a member of the council. From 1914 to 1916 he served as president.<br>
<br>Cheyne was twice married: first, on 29 January 1887, to Mary Emma (<i>d</i>. 1894), daughter of the Revd William Servant&eacute;, of Plumstead, Kent; they had two sons, and their one daughter died in infancy. Second, in 1894, he married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1922), daughter of George Smith, of Lerwick, Shetland; they had one son and two daughters, all of whom predeceased him.<br>
<br>Cheyne was a loyal and active defender of Lister's work on antisepsis. His <span class="italic">Antiseptic Surgery: its Principles, Practice, History and Results</span> (1882) was described by <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> as &#145;a starting-point for the more general adoption of Mr Lister's treatment&#146;  (29 July 1882, 143). His <span class="italic">Manual of the Antiseptic Treatment of Wounds for Students and Practitioners</span> (1885) brought the method to a wider audience.<br>
<br>Cheyne was also instrumental in establishing the science of bacteriology in Britain, through experimental research and the translation of a number of works by continental authors. In 1883 he published <span class="italic">A Report on the Relation of Micro-Organisms to Tuberculosis</span>, in which he furnished evidence in support of Robert Koch's discovery of the causal link between the tubercle bacillus and tuberculosis. He translated two important German works: Koch's <span class="italic">Etiology of the Traumatic Infective Diseases</span>, in 1880, and Carl Fl&uuml;gge's work on micro-organisms, in 1890. In 1886 he travelled to Berlin to work in Koch's laboratory, and he edited two collections of recent researches for the New Sydenham Society, entitled <span class="italic">Bacteria in Relation to Disease</span>, and <span class="italic">Suppuration and Septic Disease</span>. His own research on the micro-organisms involved in suppuration and sepsis led to his election to the fellowship of the Royal Society in 1894.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the South African War in 1899, Cheyne was appointed civil consulting surgeon to the forces. He was appointed CB in 1900 for his services, and in 1908 he was created a baronet and received a commission as surgeon rear-admiral in the Royal Naval Reserve. In 1910 he was appointed surgeon-in-ordinary to the king. When war broke out in 1914 he was made consulting surgeon to the navy and he served in the Dardanelles with the fleet. In 1916 he was appointed KCMG, and at the end of the war he retired from active practice.<br>
<br>From 1917 to 1922 Cheyne served as MP for the universities of Edinburgh and St Andrews; later he was a member for the combined Scottish universities. In the house he endeavoured to restrict his contributions to matters concerning medical issues. His maiden speech addressed the subject of unqualified practitioners treating disabled soldiers during the war. In 1919 he was gazetted lord lieutenant of Orkney and Shetland, an office he held until 1930.<br>
<br>In 1924 Cheyne was awarded the first Lister medal in recognition of his contributions to surgical science. In the same year he delivered the Lister memorial lecture at the Royal College of Surgeons. He received honorary degrees from the universities of Oxford, Edinburgh, and Birmingham, and in 1927 he was made honorary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>In appearance Cheyne was tall and well-built, and he had the look of a Scandinavian. Throughout his life he spoke with a strong Shetland accent. Like his father he was a skilled sailor, and his seamanship was formed in the waters near his home. Cheyne died in Holloway Sanatorium, Virginia Water, Surrey, after a prolonged illness, on 19 April 1932, and was succeeded as second baronet by his eldest son, Joseph Lister Cheyne MC (<i>b</i>. 1888), colonel in the 16th lancers. A memorial service was held at the chapel of King's College Hospital, London, on 25 April 1932.<br>
