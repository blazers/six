<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Locke,  John</span>  (1632&#150;1704), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was born on 29 August 1632 at Wrington, Somerset, the elder of the two children of John Locke (1606&#150;1661), attorney, and his wife, Agnes (1597&#150;1654), daughter of Edmund Keene of Wrington.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandeducation16321652"></a>Early life and education, 1632&#150;1652</h2>Locke was born into a family of very minor&#151;indeed marginal&#151;gentry. His father was the eldest son of Nicholas Locke (1574&#150;1648), a clothier who had prospered in his trade and invested his profits in land, mostly in the vicinity of Pensford, a village some 10 miles east of Locke's birthplace and 7 miles south of Bristol. It was here that Locke appears to have spent his childhood with his brother, Thomas, born on 9 August 1637. His father had not entered the cloth trade, but had become an attorney, and served as clerk to the justices of the peace for the county. He also acted as a steward for a much richer and more powerful family of local gentry, the Pophams, from whom he leased part of his land.<br>
<br>Locke's family had puritan sympathies, and after the outbreak of the civil war his father served as a captain in one of the parliamentary armies. The commander of his regiment was Alexander Popham, MP for Bath, who was able to reward his steward by recommending his son for a place at Westminster School. Locke entered Westminster in 1647, and was made a king's scholar in 1650; his fellow pupils included John Dryden, Robert Hooke, and Christopher Wren. The curriculum was centred almost entirely on the ancient languages, including Hebrew for the most academically proficient pupils. Locke seems not to have greatly enjoyed his schooldays. Though his father had disciplined him quite severely as a child, he had relaxed as his son grew older, and it is likely that Locke resented the flogging that was so frequent at Westminster. Forty years after leaving he alarmed the young son of Edward Clarke with accounts of what happened there, and recommended to Clarke that if his son continued to be difficult he might be sent &#145;to Westminster or some other very severe schoole&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 4.397) until he was more pliant and willing to learn from his tutor at home.<h2>
<a name="ChristChurchOxford16521667"></a>Christ Church, Oxford, 1652&#150;1667</h2>In May 1652 Locke was elected to a studentship at Christ Church, Oxford, the last in a list of six. It was a position tenable for life and was broadly equivalent to a fellowship in one of the other colleges, though it gave no part in the government of Christ Church, which was the preserve of the dean and the canons. The records at Christ Church do not indicate when he came into residence, but he matriculated on 27 November. The dean of Christ Church was John Owen; Locke's tutor was Thomas Cole, subsequently a nonconformist divine.<br>
<br>During the civil war Oxford had been the king's headquarters, and after its surrender the university was purged of its more open and intransigent royalists. The academic curriculum remained almost entirely unaffected by all this turmoil. Locke acquired an intense and enduring dislike of the scholastic method of disputation, and of the logical and metaphysical subtleties that went with it. He took care to fulfil the unexacting requirements for his degrees (BA, 14 February 1656; MA, 29 June 1658), but otherwise seems to have spent a good part of his time reading lighter literature&#151;plays, romances, and letters, much of it translated from French. While still an undergraduate he contributed two poems to a volume of university poetry, <span class="italic">Musarum Oxoniensium <i>Elaiophoria</i></span> (1654), his first publication.<br>
<br>It is unclear whether at this stage of his life Locke had any definite intention about what career to pursue. He was admitted to Gray's Inn in December 1656, but nothing seems to have come of this. Another possibility was medicine. Several of Locke's notebooks show that in the late 1650s he started taking extensive notes from a large number of medical works; the quantity and character of this material indicates something more than casual interest. He may not have decided firmly on a medical career, but he was almost certainly investigating it as an option.<br>
<br>The study of medicine led by an easy transition to natural philosophy. Exactly when Locke first became acquainted with the ideas of the new mechanical philosophy is not easily determined. There seems to be no evidence that he had any links with the group of innovators associated with John Wilkins at Wadham College, the nucleus of the future Royal Society, and if he had read anything by Descartes during his first years at Oxford there is no trace of it among his papers. By May 1660 he had made the acquaintance of Robert Boyle, who probably introduced him to these new ideas. Locke augmented his continuing medical studies with a thorough course of reading in mechanical philosophy, starting with Boyle's recently published <span class="italic">New Essays Physico-Mechanical Touching the Spring of the Air</span> (1660). He also read widely among Descartes's works, concentrating in particular on the physical material in the later parts of the <span class="italic">Principia philosophiae</span>, and read at least some of Gassendi's <span class="italic">Syntagma philosophicum</span>.<br>
<br>Locke's attention was, however, by no means held solely by medicine and natural philosophy. The rather precarious political stability achieved by Cromwell was rapidly eroded after his death in September 1658. Locke's letters to his father  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.82&#150;3, 136&#150;7) express a profound disenchantment with visionary politics and a strong desire for peace and security. He welcomed the return of Charles II, and contributed a poem of fulsome flattery in another university collection, <span class="italic">Britannia rediviva</span> (1660). Unlike several of his fellow students at Christ Church, he survived&#151;apparently without difficulty&#151;the post-Restoration visitation of the university. In December 1660 Locke's father fell ill, and though his son returned quickly to Somerset and discussed the case with several local doctors, nothing could be done; he died on 13 February, leaving the residue of his much depleted estate to Locke and his brother. His mother had died some years earlier, on 4 October 1654; her son retained a memory of her as &#145;a very pious woman and affectionate mother&#146;  (Fox Bourne, 1.13).<br>
<br>In the last months of 1660 Locke wrote a short treatise in the form of a scholastic disputation entitled <span class="italic">Whether the civil magistrate can lawfully determine the use of indifferent things in reference to religious worship</span>. It was directed against a colleague of Christ Church, Edward Bagshaw, who had recently published a work denying the magistrate's power. Bagshaw's position was that God had left indifferent things&#151;those neither commanded nor prohibited by divine law&#151;to the conscience of the individual believer. Locke replied that it was because they were indifferent that they lay within the scope of the magistrate's authority. After 1667 he was to adopt a position much closer to Bagshaw's; in 1660 he seems to have been motivated above all by fear of the disorder that he was sure would result from failure to impose uniformity.<br>
<br>Locke added a preface in the late spring of 1661 and secured a publisher, but in the end nothing appeared; much had happened in the six months or so since the work had been started, and it was clear that the new parliament intended to restore traditional prayer book worship with only minimal changes, and to enforce compliance with it.<br>
<br>The tract against Bagshaw was followed in 1661&#150;2 by two further tracts, each written in Latin and set out in disputation form. The first of these discussed and rejected the Roman Catholic position that it is necessary that the scriptures should have an infallible interpreter; the second was a more general and abstract defence of the thesis already argued against Bagshaw. These writings remained unpublished until the twentieth century; all that appeared was a contribution to another official volume of poetry, <span class="italic">Domiduca Oxoniensis</span> (1662), compiled to celebrate the arrival in England of Charles II's bride, Catherine of Braganza.<br>
<br>At this stage in his career Locke seems to have been well regarded by the governing body of Christ Church, and in particular by the dean, John Fell. In October 1663 Fell and two of the canons signed a certificate testifying to Locke's orthodox beliefs and moral probity. Such a testimonial was required by a candidate seeking ordination, and it appears that in the autumn of 1663 Locke was seriously considering this; he was dissuaded by his friend John Strachey, who could not see Locke as a country parson, and urged him to have confidence in his ability to make his own way in the world.<br>
<br>One manifestation of this official favour can be observed in Locke's appointment to a succession of teaching posts at Christ Church: praelector in Greek (1661&#150;2), praelector in rhetoric (1663), and censor of moral philosophy (1664). Many of the duties of this last post were disciplinary, but its holder was also required to preside over scholastic disputations. One standard subject for discussion was the theory of natural law; a set of eight disputations by Locke himself survives and has been published under the title <span class="italic">Essays on the Law of Nature</span>. These disputations provide the fullest account of a topic which is central to Locke's thought, but which he never again discussed in detail. The <span class="italic">Essays</span> argue that natural law exists and is of universal and perpetual obligation, but it is neither inscribed in our hearts by God nor discoverable from human consent or tradition. Our knowledge of it is founded ultimately on the experience of our senses, which provide us with the evidence required to establish the existence of a wise and benevolent creator from the order manifest in the world.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1661 Locke was made a tutor at Christ Church, and for the next six years was responsible for the welfare and education of a succession of pupils, of whom twenty-two can be identified. He took charge of their money, supervised their purchases, and helped impart to them the same kind of education that he had himself received a decade earlier. Locke's pupils form an unremarkable group. With the possible exception of Sir Charles Berkeley, none rose to any great eminence in either church or state, or in the world of learning. John Alford and Sir Charles Berkeley became MPs but neither achieved much of note at Westminster. Edward Pococke continued his father's work as an orientalist, Morgan Godwyn has a place in the history of the anti-slavery movement, and Corbet Owen achieved a minor and unenduring fame as a Latin poet. The only one of his former pupils with whom Locke remained on close terms was George Walls, who looked after Locke's affairs at Christ Church in his absence, and later accompanied him on his travels in France.<br>
<br>Throughout this time Locke continued reading widely in medicine and natural philosophy. He took detailed notes at Thomas Willis's lectures on medicine, given at Christ Church in 1661&#150;2, and in 1663 attended a class in chemistry given by the German chemist Peter Stahl. It was here that he attracted the attention of that acerbic chronicler of Oxford life Anthony Wood, who described him as &#145;a man of turbulent spirit, clamorous and never contented &hellip; while every man besides, of the club, was writing, he would be prating and troblesome&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Times</span>, 1.472). It is a vivid picture but one that may be coloured by later political estrangement.<br>
<br>In the winter of 1663&#150;4 Locke's brother Thomas died. They seem not to have been very close (no letters between them survive), and Locke did not return to Somerset until the end of March; he paid his brother's widow &pound;220 for the portion of the family land which Thomas had inherited. Locke himself remained single. Throughout his life he enjoyed feminine company, and during the early 1660s engaged in sentimental correspondence with several young women in Oxford, but none of his friendships seems to have come close to a proposal of marriage. A passage in the <span class="italic">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</span> (bk 2, chap. 21, section 34) reveals Locke's later opinion of the married state: &#145;<i>It is better to marry than to burn</i>, says St. <i>Paul</i>; where we may see, what it is, that chiefly drives Men into the enjoyments of a conjugal life&#146;. Locke seems to have been able to resist sensual temptations: perhaps the only reference to any sexual activity on his part occurs in an early but undated letter sent by a friend, Francis Atkins, to which Atkins added a postscript: &#145;My service to thy bedfellow, for so I think shee is at this time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.40), and even this may be no more than conjecture. Locke himself gave nothing away.<br>
<br>After Locke had finished his term as censor of moral philosophy he occupied no further university offices, and though he remained a tutor he took no new pupils. He had steadily been rising in seniority through the ranks of students at Christ Church: from the start of 1665 he was among the twenty most senior, and as such would normally have been required to take orders; that he was able to retain his studentship without doing so suggests the continued favour of the dean, but his position remained precarious.<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1665 a new opportunity presented itself. Sir Walter Vane was being sent to Cleves on an embassy to the elector of Brandenburg, and Locke was offered the post of secretary. The mission left England in November and returned three months later. As a venture in diplomacy it proved unsuccessful, but it is clear from Locke's letters that he greatly enjoyed his first journey abroad. The experience of living in a community in which the members of different churches lived together without provoking disorder may also have helped change his mind about the practicability of religious toleration.<br>
<br>Once back in Oxford, Locke resumed his studies in chemistry and medicine. He was particularly interested in the physiology of respiration, and had for some years been closely following the work being done by Boyle, Hooke, and others. It was probably about this time that he drafted a short work on the purpose of respiration; this was written in the form of a scholastic disputation and may have been produced as part of a plan to become a bachelor of medicine. In the event it remained unused, and Locke did not obtain the degree until nearly ten years later.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1666 a chance meeting altered the entire course of Locke's life. Anthony Ashley Cooper, then Lord Ashley and subsequently earl of Shaftesbury, had been chancellor of the exchequer since 1661. He had come to Oxford to visit his son, an undergraduate at Trinity College. Ashley was not in good health; his physician in Oxford was David Thomas, a fellow of New College who was Locke's chief collaborator in his chemical experiments, and it was through Thomas that they first met. Each was favourably impressed by the other, and by the time Ashley left Oxford the beginnings of an enduring friendship had been established. In the autumn Locke paid a visit to London, and with Ashley's help procured a royal dispensation permitting him to retain his studentship at Christ Church without taking orders. With his position in Oxford now at least temporarily secured, Locke was able to consider a new career. At the beginning of April 1667 he packed up his belongings and left Oxford. After a trip back to Somerset to see old friends and collect his rents he travelled to London, arriving early in May. He was given accommodation in Exeter House in the Strand, Ashley's London residence; he stayed there for the next eight years.<h2>
<a name="ExeterHouse16671675"></a>Exeter House, 1667&#150;1675</h2>Locke's earliest responsibilities as a member of Ashley's household are not known with certainty. According to the third earl of Shaftesbury, Locke acted as tutor to his father, the future second earl, who had now left Oxford  (Fox Bourne, 1.203). Nothing in the young Anthony Ashley Cooper's later career suggests that he would have been a particularly rewarding pupil, and though responsibility for him would have added to Locke's educational experience, it would also have left him ample free time. Locke was closely involved in the negotiations that preceded the young man's marriage in September 1669 to Lady Dorothea Manners, daughter of the earl of Rutland. Their eldest child, the future third earl, was born in February 1671; his grandfather took control of his upbringing, and Locke was later given the task of overseeing his schooling.<br>
<br>Locke's activities in London remained as varied as in Oxford. He continued to read extensively in medicine, but could now supplement what had hitherto been an almost exclusively theoretical education with clinical experience. Soon after arriving at Exeter House he got to know the physician Thomas Sydenham, the author of a new and controversial account of treating infectious diseases, <span class="italic">Methodus curandi febres</span> (1666). Locke accompanied Sydenham on his rounds and kept records of his methods of treatment. Soon the two men were collaborating closely. Among the Shaftesbury papers there are two short medical essays in Locke's hand, <span class="italic">Anatomia</span> (1668) and <span class="italic">De arte medica</span> (1669); though sometimes attributed to Sydenham, they are more likely to have been written by Locke. Both works expressed a profound scepticism about our capacity to discover the nature of disease, and advocated a purely empirical approach to medical practice. Locke paid Sydenham public tribute in a Latin poem included in the second edition of <span class="italic">Methodus curandi febres</span> (1668). Years later Sydenham repaid the compliment in the preface to his <span class="italic">Observationes medicae</span> (1676) by praising Locke's acute intellect, steady judgement, and simple manners.<br>
<br>Locke's increasing medical knowledge was put to good use in summer 1668. Ashley's generally poor health had been growing worse, and on 12 June he underwent a novel and extremely risky operation to drain an abscess on his liver. After a period of convalescence he made a good recovery. The medical papers relating to the operation (TNA: PRO, PRO 30/24/47/2) suggest that Locke's role was primarily that of a co-ordinator and supervisor of nursing care, but the original idea for the operation may have been his, and according to Locke himself, Ashley believed that Locke had saved his life  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 2.662).<br>
<br>Locke also continued to pursue his scientific interests. In November 1668 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, but though he was quickly appointed to a committee for experiments and twice served on the council (1669&#150;70, 1672&#150;3), he seems to have attended few meetings and to have contributed little to the work of the society. His one communication to the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> during these years (24 May 1675) was a letter on poisonous fish sent to him by a correspondent in the Bahamas.<br>
<br>Just as Locke's hitherto largely theoretical approach to medicine had been broadened by his association with Sydenham, so his rather academic interest in politics was modified by the experience of living in the household of one of England's most remarkable politicians. Within a year of coming to London he had written <span class="italic">Essay Concerning Toleration</span>, in which he rejected the position he had taken in 1660 and advocated the toleration of all purely speculative opinions, giving the magistrate the right to intervene only when civil order was at risk. The work was not published until 1876, but it survives in four manuscript copies and was presumably circulated among Ashley and his associates. Locke also developed an interest, hitherto absent, in economic questions. The outcome was a treatise, <span class="italic">Some of the Consequences that are Like to Follow upon Lessening of Interest to 4 per cent</span>, begun in 1668 and further added to in 1674. Nothing was published at the time, but Locke kept the manuscript and made use of it later.<br>
<br>In 1669 Ashley involved Locke in the affairs of the recently founded colony of Carolina. In August of that year the first group of settlers left England, taking with them an elaborate set of laws, the &#145;fundamental constitutions of Carolina&#146;. It is unlikely that Locke was the sole author of this but there is evidence that he had a hand in the original drafting, and he was certainly involved in suggesting alterations and improvements. Locke continued to serve the lords proprietors of the colony in a secretarial capacity until 1675, taking minutes at their meetings and handling much of the correspondence with the newly arrived colonists. He also had a financial interest in other colonial ventures, including the Bahamas Company and the Royal African Company.<br>
<br>When he went to London, Locke's annual income was usually about &pound;100, two-thirds of which came from his land and the remainder from Christ Church. Since the autumn of 1668 Ashley had been augmenting this with a half-yearly payment of &pound;40. Two years later an opportunity arose to shift the burden to the public revenue. Locke was appointed a registrar to the commissioners of the excise at an annual salary of &pound;175; &pound;60 of this went to pay a clerk, who presumably performed most of the duties required. Locke lost this useful source of income in the spring of 1675, but he was able to use the wealth he had accumulated to purchase an annuity from Shaftesbury, which yielded &pound;100 a year. For an outlay of &pound;700 this was a bargain, though it was to cause some friction with Shaftesbury's family after his death.<br>
<br>Locke saw less of Sydenham after 1670, and for the next few years spent rather less of his time reading works on medicine. He was engaged in a new set of enquiries. The origins of the <span class="italic">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</span> are described with tantalizing brevity in the epistle to the reader with which the work begins. There Locke recalls how, at an unspecified but clearly distant time in the past, he and a group of five or six friends had met in his chamber to discuss some other quite remote topic, and had rapidly found themselves entangled in a mass of wholly unanticipated perplexities. It then occurred to Locke himself that they should turn their attention to the capabilities of the human understanding; he therefore set down &#145;some hasty and undigested thoughts on a subject I had never before considered&#146;, which he took along to the next meeting.<br>
<br>Two surviving works allow these events to be dated. Locke was busy with the first of these, &#145;Intellectus humanus cum cognitionis certitudine et assensus firmitate&#146;, in the summer of 1671. Despite its title, the work (now generally known as draft A) is in English, and its first few pages may well be derived from the hasty and undigested thoughts taken to the meeting in his chamber. A longer and considerably more polished work, &#145;An essay concerning the understanding, knowledge, opinion and assent&#146; (draft B), was begun later in the same year. Both works remained unfinished, and both left unsolved the main problems that had led to their being started. Locke seems not to have resumed systematic work on philosophy until 1676, when he was in France.<br>
<br>Between 1672 and 1675 much of Locke's time was spent on administrative activity of various kinds. In March 1672 Ashley was created earl of Shaftesbury, and in November was appointed lord chancellor. A considerable quantity of ecclesiastical patronage came with the office, and the work this entailed was entrusted to the secretary for presentations. Locke held this post until Shaftesbury was dismissed in November 1673. Perhaps in anticipation of this, Locke had in the previous month been made secretary to the council for trade and plantations; in December he became treasurer as well. These posts were far from sinecures, and the work they entailed added to Locke's already considerable knowledge of colonial matters. He held them until the council itself was dissolved in December 1674; the combined salary of &pound;600 per annum was never paid.<br>
<br>At the beginning of 1675 Locke's position had become worryingly insecure: he had lost or was about to lose all his government employment, and his patron was out of office and out of favour. His studentship at Christ Church was irregularly held and its retention depended on a royal dispensation revocable at any time. In February Locke returned to Oxford&#151;it seems to have been only his second visit in nearly eight years&#151;and took the degree of bachelor of medicine; later in the year he managed to secure one of the two medical studentships that the college offered, thereby relieving himself of any obligation to take holy orders. For the time being at least his position at Christ Church was safe.<br>
<br>On 14 November Locke crossed to France for a visit that in the end lasted nearly three and a half years; he was accompanied by George Walls, his former pupil. Locke's ostensible motive for travelling was his health&#151;he was already suffering from an ailment of the lungs, probably asthma and chronic bronchitis, that was to trouble him for the rest of his life&#151;but he may have had another reason as well. At the beginning of the month an anonymous pamphlet attacking in vehement terms the policy of the king's chief minister, the earl of Danby, had appeared on sale in London. The authorship of <span class="italic">A Letter from a Person of quality to his Friend in the Country</span> has never been definitely established, but it undoubtedly came from Shaftesbury's circle, and probably from his household. In 1720 it was attributed to Locke by Pierre des Maizeaux, perhaps on the basis of information from the third earl; Locke probably had a hand in its composition, though it would not always have expressed his own opinions.<h2>
<a name="France16751679"></a>France, 1675&#150;1679</h2>On arriving in France, Locke began to keep a journal, a practice he continued until the end of his life. In later years the number of entries grew smaller, especially after 1689, but the well-filled volumes covering the years in France make it possible, for the first time in Locke's life, to construct an almost day-by-day account of his movements and activities. Locke's journal is not an intimate document comparable with Pepys's diary, but it does reveal many aspects of his character: a love of travellers' tales, a concern with recording minute items of factual information, and a very careful attitude towards money.<br>
<br>Locke travelled from Calais via Paris and Lyon, and on 4 January 1676 arrived at Montpellier, where he stayed for over a year. He quickly engaged a tutor to teach him French for one hour a day and began reading books in that language. Locke had been to France before&#151;in the autumn of 1672 he had spent a few weeks in Paris&#151;but though he may have acquired some ability to communicate in French, he could not yet read the language with any ease; there are no citations made before 1676 from any French books among his papers. Philosophy in France was increasingly being written in the vernacular, and by learning French, Locke gained access to philosophical debates from which he had previously been excluded. His journal shows that he was thinking hard about philosophy and about how his own views differed from those of the Cartesians.<br>
<br>Two fellow countrymen whom Locke met in Montpellier were Thomas Herbert, later earl of Pembroke, the future dedicatee of the <span class="italic">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</span>, and Denis Grenville, archdeacon of Durham. Grenville was a weak and unhappy man who had come to France to escape his bishop, his creditors, and his manic-depressive wife; he attached himself to Locke, who treated him with considerable forbearance and sent him letters filled with sensible advice on recreation and devotion.<br>
<br>Early in 1677 Locke agreed to act as tutor to Caleb, the son of Sir John Banks, a prosperous London merchant. In March he left Montpellier and travelled in a leisurely manner to Paris by way of Toulouse and Bordeaux, arriving there at the beginning of June. Initially his duties were expected to last for only a few months, but in the event he and Caleb remained in Paris until their return to England in 1679, apart from a journey together through provincial France in late summer and autumn 1678; a plan to visit Italy was reluctantly abandoned.<br>
<br>In France two rival versions of the new mechanical philosophy had attracted supporters. Locke seems to have been far more interested in the thought of Descartes and of later Cartesians such as Malebranche than he was in Gassendi, though in Paris he became acquainted with two of Gassendi's followers, Fran&ccedil;ois Bernier and Gilles de Launay, both of whom presented him with copies of their own works. He also continued working on his philosophical enquiries. One of the manuscripts that he left behind in Paris in July 1678 was a folio volume described as &#145;Essay de Intellectu&#146;, which cannot be either draft A or draft B. Given Locke's known techniques of composition, it is virtually certain that quite substantial sections of the published <span class="italic">Essay</span> were written while he was in France, though it can only be conjectured what they are.<br>
<br>Two lesser works that Locke did complete while in France were both intended for private circulation within the Shaftesbury family. In the autumn of 1676 he translated three of the essays in Pierre Nicole's <span class="italic">Essais de morale</span>; a manuscript containing these was presented to the countess after he returned to England. Locke also used the knowledge acquired during his travels to write <span class="italic">Observations upon the Growth and Culture of Vines and Olives</span>; this was dedicated to Shaftesbury himself, who had thoughts of resettling French protestant refugees in Carolina.<br>
<br>Other friends Locke made in France included the biblical scholar and antiquarian Nicolas Toinard and the librarian and savant Henri Justel, later a refugee in England. Many of his associates were protestants, and Locke recorded in his journal evidence of the restrictions imposed on the protestant communities by the increasingly intolerant government of Louis XIV. This experience cannot have lessened his aversion to absolute monarchy and to its supporters in England.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoEngland16791683"></a>Return to England, 1679&#150;1683</h2>Locke arrived back in England at the end of April 1679. Exeter House had been vacated and then demolished while he was away, and Shaftesbury had taken a lease of Thanet House in Aldersgate Street, immediately to the north of the City. Locke lived there for about half of the next four years, but he seems not to have been as closely involved with Shaftesbury's affairs as before; he spent a good part of his time either in Oxford or at the house of his friend James Tyrrell at Oakley, Buckinghamshire. At Christ Church his association with Shaftesbury had made him an object of suspicion to the college authorities: his movements were watched and attempts were made to entrap him in conversation, but nothing was discovered. As Fell later reported, Locke &#145;could never be provoked to take any notice, or discover in word or look the least concern; so that I believe there is not in the world such a master of taciturnity and passion&#146;  (Fox Bourne, 1.484).<br>
<br>The England to which Locke returned was in a state of acute political crisis. The revelations of the Popish Plot had burst upon an already discontented nation in August 1678. The plot itself was a fabrication, but few of Locke's contemporaries were prepared entirely to discount the elaborate mendacities fabricated by Titus Oates and his associates. Locke's own views remain opaque; if he harboured any doubts, he seems to have kept them to himself. For the next four years, until his flight to the Netherlands as a refugee, Locke was to be concerned primarily, though never exclusively, with politics.<br>
<br>Shaftesbury's grand design was to divert the succession away from the duke of York by forcing an <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span> through parliament and then coercing the king into giving it his assent. Charles saw this as an assault on the monarchy, and was determined to resist with every means in his power. The turning point came in March 1681. Parliament had been summoned to Oxford&#151;Locke was roused from his sickbed to arrange accommodation for Shaftesbury and his associates&#151;but was dissolved within a week. As it became apparent that Charles had no plans to summon another parliament, the opposition split: some became inactive, or even changed sides; others, including Shaftesbury, began to think with increasing seriousness about the possibility of raising an insurrection.<br>
<br>Charles rightly saw Shaftesbury as his most dangerous opponent, and was determined to crush him. On 2 July 1681 Shaftesbury was arrested and sent to the Tower, charged with treason. Shaftesbury could not be tried until he had been indicted by a grand jury, drawn from panels nominated by the sheriffs of the county in which the alleged offence had been committed. In London the sheriffs were Shaftesbury's close associates, who could be relied on to select like-minded jurors; the most worrying danger to Shaftesbury was that the judges would find a way to remove these jurors and replace them by others who would bring in a different verdict. Shaftesbury's associates did everything they could to assist his defence: Locke's contribution was to write a short tract on the power of judges to alter the composition of grand juries, which survives among the Shaftesbury papers. Shaftesbury remained in prison until 24 November, when a whig-nominated grand jury failed to find sufficient evidence for a prosecution to proceed. His release was greeted with wild celebration, but his position was far from secure. In June 1682 the government secured the return of two tories as sheriffs for London, and Shaftesbury knew that once they took office he would no longer be safe. At the end of September he went into hiding; two months later, after a planned insurrection had been aborted, he fled to Amsterdam, where he died in January 1683. His body was brought back to England and buried at Wimborne St Giles; Locke was among the mourners, and composed an elegant Latin epitaph.<br>
<br>Shaftesbury's death denied the whigs their most determined leader, but not all his associates were disheartened. One group formed a plot to assassinate Charles and James on their way back from the races at Newmarket, at the Rye House near Hertford. No attempt was ever made, and early in June the plot was betrayed to the government; the arrests began on 21 June.<br>
<br>It is very unlikely that Locke was involved with the assassination plot. None of the conspirators ever named him, and his movements in the weeks after the arrests started were not those of someone attempting to hide. He was, however, a known adherent of Shaftesbury, and even if he was not himself involved in the plot, he was undeniably acquainted with people who were, such as the barrister Richard West; he had therefore some reason for believing himself to be at risk. Locke spent much of July and the first half of August in the west country, visiting friends, putting his affairs in order, and arranging for money to be sent abroad. It is not known how and when he left England, but on 7 September he was in Rotterdam.<br>
<br>Among the papers that Locke left behind in England were two closely related works on politics. One was an extended attack on the politics of Sir Robert Filmer. Filmer had died in 1653, but his main work, <span class="italic">Patriarcha</span>, was not published until 1680. It set out the patriarchal theory of politics in its most extreme and most vulnerable form. For Filmer we are not born free, but in a state of subjection to our parents and to the rulers whom God has set over us. Paternal and political power are ultimately the same: both descend from Adam, who had by right of fatherhood royal authority over his children, and this authority passed to his successors. Locke set out to demolish this theory not merely by severing the chain of argument at its weakest link, but by destroying every part that appeared vulnerable. He argued that Adam never possessed the kind of power that Filmer supposed, and that even if he had done, it could not have been conveyed to his posterity in any manner that could justify the titles of any of the monarchs now ruling. Filmer's theory required that Adam's power descended either by a form of primogeniture, so that at any time there was a single heir who was rightful monarch of the whole world, or to all his descendants&#151;that is, to everyone.<br>
<br>The other work that Locke had written was a more general treatment of the origin, extent, and end of civil government, and formed the positive counterpart to the attack on patriarchalism: Locke saw that in order to change the way that people thought about politics, it was necessary not merely to demolish Filmer's theory but also to provide a credible alternative. Like Hobbes, Locke regarded the state as a human construction, established by an original contract, but while Hobbes saw the sovereign as possessing unlimited authority, Locke did not. Private property can be acquired in the state of nature, and property rights are not extinguished by the transition to civil society. When entering into society men agree to give up some of the powers which they had exercised in the state of nature, such as the power to punish breaches of the law of nature, but their doing this is not irrevocable. If a government attempts to exceed its powers, it breaks its trust, the government is dissolved, and its former subjects are at liberty to set up another in its place.<br>
<br>For Locke it was absolutely essential to distinguish political from paternal power, and both from the despotic power exercised by a master over his slaves. Absolute monarchy, though claimed by its defenders as the only legitimate form of government, is inconsistent with civil society, and so no form of civil government at all. Any ruler who attempts to exercise an arbitrary power over the people &#145;is to be esteemed the common Enemy and Pest of mankind; and is to be treated accordingly&#146;  (<span class="italic">Two Treatises of Government</span>, 2.230). Locke was careful to insist that he was not advocating rebellion&#151;the true rebels were those who invaded the properties and liberties of the people, not those who defended them&#151;but it was unmistakably a defence of a right of resistance. These were not views that could have been published openly in England during the last years of Charles II's reign, and Locke had very good reasons for keeping the existence of the treatise in which they were advocated as secret as possible.<br>
<br>The dates of these two works have been the subject of some controversy. The attack on Filmer cannot have been started before <span class="italic">Patriarcha</span> was published in the winter of 1679&#150;80, and most of it was probably written soon afterwards. The second work was probably composed over a rather longer period, perhaps mostly in 1681&#150;2, though any detailed account of its composition is necessarily speculative. Both works remained unpublished until 1689, when they appeared together as <span class="italic">Two Treatises on Government</span>.<br>
<br>Another polemical work dating from this period has remained unpublished. In 1680 the dean of St Paul's, Edward Stillingfleet, published a sermon directed against protestant nonconformists entitled <span class="italic">The Mischief of Separation</span>; the next year he followed this with a longer treatise, <span class="italic">The Unreasonableness of Separation</span>. Among Locke's papers (MS Locke c. 34) there survives an extended reply to both these works, partly in Locke's hand, partly in that of his manservant Sylvester Brounower, but mostly in the hand of James Tyrrell. It has generally been assumed that this work was a joint venture by Locke and Tyrrell, but recent analyses suggest that Locke was the sole author and Tyrrell was merely serving as his amanuensis while Locke was unwell.<br>
<br>Though he deplored the persecution of the nonconformists, Locke was never one himself. His closest sympathies seem to have been with the latitudinarian Anglicans, such as Benjamin Whichcote and John Tillotson. In his later years he is known to have taken the sacrament in order to qualify for office under the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> and to have at least occasionally attended the parish church at High Laver, but during the middle period of his life his attendance at any form of public worship is difficult to document, and may not have been at all frequent.<h2>
<a name="ExileintheNetherlands16831689"></a>Exile in the Netherlands, 1683&#150;1689</h2>Once in the Netherlands, Locke travelled immediately to Amsterdam, where he remained for nearly a year. The winter of 1683&#150;4 was exceptionally cold, and Locke spent much of his time indoors reading medicine. One victim of the cold was a lioness from the zoo; Locke attended the autopsy, and met Philippus van Limborch, professor of theology at the remonstrant seminary in Amsterdam. Limborch's religious outlook was very close to Locke's own, and like Locke he detested persecution and the cruelties that accompany it. In August and September 1684 Locke spent six weeks travelling through the more remote provinces of the Netherlands, visiting Franeker, Groningen, Deventer, and Nijmegen. Between September 1684 and May 1685 he moved frequently between Amsterdam, Leiden, and Utrecht.<br>
<br>Locke quickly made contact with several of the other English political exiles living in the Netherlands, and this was reported back to the English government. He was suspected of writing libellous pamphlets, and in November 1684 was expelled from his studentship at Christ Church. It is not certain that he contributed financially to the duke of Monmouth's ill-fated expedition, but he undoubtedly knew&#151;and indeed lodged with&#151;Thomas Dare, who was its paymaster. In the following May, a fortnight before the expedition sailed, his name was included in a list of exiles sent to the states general of the United Provinces with a request that they should be arrested. Locke went underground, and remained in hiding under a variety of aliases until May 1686. For most of this time he was in Amsterdam, but he spent part of the autumn across the border in Cleves, a town he knew well from his visit twenty years before; his presence there was reported back to London, but nothing could be done.<br>
<br>Since coming to the Netherlands, Locke had resumed work on the <span class="italic">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</span>, and as it took shape he sent copies to his friends in England. In April 1686 he sent an unspecified portion, probably containing books 1 and 2; book 3 followed in August, and book 4 in December. By the end of 1686 the <span class="italic">Essay</span> existed in a form fairly close to what was published in 1690.<br>
<br>In winter 1685&#150;6 Locke interrupted his labours on the <span class="italic">Essay</span> to write another, shorter work. Louis XIV had revoked the edict of Nantes in October, removing the last remnants of toleration for the French protestants. The <span class="italic">Epistola de tolerantia</span> was written after Locke returned from Cleves about the beginning of November. It was addressed to Limborch, who kept the manuscript and subsequently arranged for it to be printed. The Latin text was published anonymously at Gouda in April 1689, two months after Locke had returned to England. The <span class="italic">Epistola</span> develops further the theory of toleration already put forward in the <span class="italic">Essay Concerning Toleration</span> of 1667. Locke advocated the complete separation of church and state: states exist only to preserve their members' civil goods; churches are purely voluntary societies which are allowed to exercise discipline over their members, but which anyone can leave at any time without incurring any civil disabilities. Complete toleration should be given to every religious body whose doctrines are neither incompatible with civil society nor require their adherents to give allegiance to a foreign prince.<br>
<br>Locke's last two years in the Netherlands were less eventful. In February 1687 he moved to Rotterdam to stay with Benjamin Furly, an English merchant of broadly Quaker beliefs who had been living there since the Restoration. Locke found Furly's company agreeable and his opinions sympathetic; a further attraction was access to the substantial library that Furly had amassed. Locke remained with Furly until his final departure for England.<br>
<br>An acquaintance Locke had already made in Amsterdam was another refugee with unorthodox religious views, Jean le Clerc, a colleague of Limborch in the remonstrant seminary. In 1686 he began publishing a new periodical, the <span class="italic">Biblioth&egrave;que Universelle et Historique</span>. The second volume (July) included a short piece by Locke, &#145;Une methode nouvelle, &amp; facile de dresser des recueuils&#146;; this took the form of a letter to Nicolas Toinard, and described in careful detail the method of organizing a commonplace book which Locke had been using since 1660. Apart from his poems, it was Locke's first publication: though not likely to arouse much excitement in the world of learning, it would certainly not cause any trouble. Locke also probably contributed a review of Newton's <span class="italic">Principia</span> in March 1688; its contents correspond closely to notes among Locke's own papers, and there is nothing that suggests that the reviewer possessed any advanced mathematical knowledge.<br>
<br>A slightly earlier number of the <span class="italic">Biblioth&egrave;que</span> (January 1688) contained Locke's first publication of real importance, &#145;Extrait d'un livre anglois &hellip; intitul&eacute; essai philosophique concernant l'entendement&#146;, a substantial abridgement (translated by le Clerc) of the already completed but still unpublished <span class="italic">Essay</span>. Locke arranged for the printer to produce a stock of separate copies and had them circulated among his acquaintances in both England and the Netherlands.<h2>
<a name="Therevolutionandafterwards16891694"></a>The revolution and afterwards, 1689&#150;1694</h2>The success of William of Orange's expedition and the resulting flight of James II made it safe for Locke to come home. He returned on 12 February 1689, on the same ship that conveyed Princess Mary back to England. Locke was quickly offered a diplomatic post but unhesitatingly declined, mainly on grounds of health, but also because of an incapacity for the social side of diplomacy: &#145;I know noe such rack in the world to draw out mens thoughts as a well managed Bottle&#146;, he wrote to Lord Mordaunt, and he thought that it would be more in the king's interest &#145;to send a man of equall parts that could drinke his share, than the soberest man in the Kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 3.575). Locke would probably have made a very good ambassador. After his death Pierre Coste testified to his &#145;obliging and benevolent manners which, supported by an easy and polite expression, a great knowledge of the world, and a vast extent of capacity, made his conversation so agreeable to all sorts of people&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 10.168); his enemies never denied his reserve and discretion. Locke did, however, accept the post of commissioner of appeals for the excise, which involved fewer duties and which brought in &pound;200 per annum.<br>
<br>Now that Locke was back in England it was not obvious where he was to live. He had lost his studentship at Christ Church, and though he drafted a petition for its restoration, he made no sustained effort to achieve this. In March he moved into the house of Mrs Rabsy Smithsby in Westminster; she was an old acquaintance who had looked after some of his books while he was in exile. Locke remained her lodger until the end of June 1690, when he moved to a nearby house occupied by Robert Pawling, a former mayor of Oxford whom he had known since the early 1680s.<br>
<br>In the months that followed his return to England, Locke busied himself with preparing his two chief works for publication. The manuscript (or, almost certainly, manuscripts) that contained the <span class="italic">Two Treatises on Government</span> had apparently been left in England, and a large portion of the attack on Filmer in the first treatise had been either lost or deliberately destroyed; Locke appears to have made no attempt to reconstruct it. The second treatise was probably lightly revised for the changed political situation, and a new preface praising &#145;our Great Restorer, Our present King William&#146; was added. <span class="italic">Two Treatises</span> was licensed for publication on 23 August, and appeared, with the date 1690 on the title page, in October. No author's name was given, and Locke never publicly acknowledged his authorship during his lifetime.<br>
<br>During this period Locke was also adding final touches to the <span class="italic">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</span>. The contract with the publisher was dated 24 May, and printing finished about the end of November. Like the <span class="italic">Two Treatises</span>, the <span class="italic">Essay</span> was on sale before the beginning of its nominal year of publication. There was no name on the title page, but the dedicatory epistle was signed and Locke had no desire to conceal his authorship: he sent presentation copies to over forty of his friends and acquaintances, including Queen Mary, Newton, Huygens, and Boyle; Sydenham would have been included if he had not just died (29 December). Huygens and Newton were both recent acquaintances; Huygens soon returned to the Netherlands, but Locke kept in touch with Newton, the two corresponding mostly on problems of biblical interpretation.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Essay</span> attracted attention from the start, both favourable and unfavourable. Much of this was directed towards the most conspicuous and easily understood feature of the work, the denial of innate principles in book 1. This was unacceptable&#151;even shocking&#151;to many of Locke's readers, including the most profound of his early critics, Leibniz. For Locke the human understanding was initially like &#145;white Paper, void of all Characters&#146;  (bk 2, chap. 1, section 2): all the ideas which it subsequently contains are derived from experience, either external or internal. The account of how the mind puts together various complex ideas from the material provided by sensation and reflection occupies book 2, the longest in the <span class="italic">Essay</span>. Book 3 is on words, which have meaning only by acting as signs of ideas; book 4 is on knowledge and opinion. At the beginning of the <span class="italic">Essay</span>, Locke had announced his intention &#145;to search out the <i>Bounds</i> between Opinion and Knowledge; and examine by what Measures, in things, whereof we have no certain Knowledge, we ought to regulate our Assent&#146;  (bk 1, chap. 1, section 3). The second part of this was crucially important: Locke was no sceptic, but he entirely lacked the boundless intellectual optimism possessed by contemporaries such as Spinoza. He deliberately turned away from metaphysical questions about the nature of the mind and contented himself with trying to find out how it works. It is only when we have done this that we will be in a position to determine what falls within the scope of our understanding, and what does not.<br>
<br>Many of Locke's doctrines were far from unprecedented: the denial of innatism, the empiricist account of concept acquisition and its attendant semantic theory can all be found in earlier authors, notably Hobbes, though Locke's account was far more thoroughly worked out, and such features as the distinction in book 3 between real and nominal essences were entirely new. Perhaps the most original aspect of the <span class="italic">Essay</span> is, however, the conception of philosophy which it embodies. Locke abandoned the whole enterprise of first philosophy as practised from Aristotle to Descartes: he did not see himself as laying a metaphysical foundation on which natural philosophers could then build, but rather (as he put it in the &#145;Epistle to the Reader&#146;) &#145;as an Under-Labourer &hellip; clearing Ground a little, and removing some of the Rubbish, that lies in the way to Knowledge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Drafts for the Essay</span>, 10).<br>
<br>While Locke was revising the <span class="italic">Essay</span> and <span class="italic">Two Treatises</span>, and seeing them through the press, an English translation was being prepared of the <span class="italic">Epistola de tolerantia</span>. The translator was William Popple, a merchant of Unitarian views and a convinced advocate of religious toleration; Locke was friendly with Popple and had supplied him with a copy of the Latin original. Popple's translation, entitled <span class="italic">A Letter Concerning Toleration</span>, went on sale in the late autumn. It sold out quickly (a second edition appeared a few months later) and immediately aroused controversy. In April 1690 an Oxford clergyman, Jonas Proast, published a vigorous attack, <span class="italic">The Argument of the Letter Concerning Toleration Consider'd and Answer'd</span>. Locke replied later in the summer with a short <span class="italic">Second Letter Concerning Toleration</span>; he chose not to reveal his identity and wrote as a third party taking the side of the author of the original <span class="italic">Letter</span>. The <span class="italic">Second Letter</span> failed to satisfy Proast: a further attack, <span class="italic">A Third Letter Concerning Toleration</span>, appeared in February 1691, and provoked Locke into elaborating a very much longer reply. <span class="italic">A Third Letter for Toleration</span> was completed in June 1692, and appeared in November. For the time being Proast made no response, and the controversy ceased.<br>
<br>Shortly before Locke started work on the <span class="italic">Second Letter</span>, about April 1690, he drafted a short and untitled political tract now usually known as &#145;A call to the nation for unity&#146;; it was sent to Edward Clarke, and remained among his papers. The tract was directed against those tories who were prepared to recognize William as king <i>de facto</i>, but not <i>de jure</i>. Locke saw this as an evasion: if William was not king <i>de jure</i> then he could only be a usurper, as his Jacobite opponents maintained.<br>
<br>While working on his replies to Proast, Locke had also been thinking again about problems in economics. His concern with these matters had been revived in the summer of 1690 by the introduction into parliament of bills to reduce the legal rate of interest, and to devalue the silver coinage by increasing its nominal value. A part of <span class="italic">Some considerations of the consequences of the lowering of interest, and raising the value of money</span> was written in 1690, but much of it was taken over almost unchanged from the unpublished tract that Locke had started in 1668. Locke continued to work on <span class="italic">Some Considerations</span> during 1691, and it was eventually published rather hurriedly in December when another bill to reduce the rate of interest was placed before the House of Commons.<br>
<br>In summer 1690 Locke paid an extended visit to Oates, a small moated manor house near High Laver in north Essex, the home of Sir Francis Masham; Masham's wife, Damaris, was the daughter of Ralph Cudworth, and had been a close friend and correspondent of Locke since before his departure for the Netherlands. In the early part of 1691 he was invited to stay as a permanent guest. Locke was to live at Oates for the remainder of his life, though in the 1690s he was forced to spend quite long periods in London attending to government business.<br>
<br>Once the <span class="italic">Third Letter for Toleration</span> was out of the way, Locke's thoughts turned to a less controversial work. While in the Netherlands he had begun sending Edward Clarke a series of letters giving detailed advice about the upbringing of Clarke's children. Most of <span class="italic">Some Thoughts Concerning Education</span> was taken from these letters, though some new material was added.<br>
<br>For Locke the central purpose of education was education into virtue, and this meant training in self-control: &#145;The Principle of all Vertue and Excellency lies in a power of denying our selves the satisfaction of our own Desires, where Reason does not authorize them&#146;  (section 38). Locke did not regard children as innately cruel or malevolent&#151;he thought the cruelty they frequently displayed as having been learned by bad example&#151;but he did see them as naturally wilful and selfish. This was not original sin in the traditional theological sense, but it was a long way from Rousseau's faith in the goodness of the uncorrupted human heart.<br>
<br>Of all Locke's works, <span class="italic">Some Thoughts</span> is perhaps the one that reveals most about its author. A reader of the <span class="italic">Essay</span> might conclude that Locke had a prosaic mind, but it is only when he was writing about the education of children that the extent of his animosity towards poetry becomes apparent: &#145;if he [a child] have a Poetick Vein, 'tis to me the strangest thing in the World, that the Father should desire, or suffer it to be cherished or improved. Methinks the Parents should labour to have it stifled, and suppressed, as much as may be&#146;  (section 174).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Some Thoughts</span> was published in July 1693; it sold quickly and another virtually identical edition followed soon afterwards. A third edition, containing a substantial quantity of new material, came out two years later. This revised edition was the first work since the <span class="italic">Essay</span> to be published in Locke's own name, and it helped add to his growing reputation.<br>
<br>During the time that Locke was adding the final touches to <span class="italic">Some Thoughts</span> and seeing to its publication, he was also thinking about new material for a second edition of the <span class="italic">Essay</span>. John Norris had been the first author to publish any criticisms of the <span class="italic">Essay</span>, in some &#145;Cursory reflections&#146;, added at the end of his <span class="italic">Christian Blessedness</span> (1690). Norris was an old friend of Lady Masham, and it was through her that he became acquainted with Locke. Initially friendly, their relations turned sour when Locke came to suspect that Norris had been prying into his correspondence. The first result of this was a bad-tempered fragment, entitled &#145;JL answer to Mr Norris's reflection&#146;, dated 1692. This was quickly followed by two rather more substantial pieces, <span class="italic">Remarks upon some of Mr Norris's Books</span>, and <span class="italic">An Examination of P. Malebranche's Opinion of Seeing All Things in God</span>, both probably dating from early 1693; these remained unpublished until 1720 and 1706 respectively. Despite its title, the <span class="italic">Examination of Malebranche</span> began as an attack on Norris, as some passages omitted in the version published in 1706 show. At one stage Locke wondered about including some of this material in the second edition of the <span class="italic">Essay</span>, but on further reflection decided against doing so: a long polemic would have been out of place in a work that aimed quite deliberately at avoiding disputation and controversy.<br>
<br>Some of the other new material in the second edition arose out of Locke's much more amiable relationship with a young Irish scientist, William Molyneux. Molyneux had referred to Locke in fulsome terms in the preface to his <span class="italic">Dioptrica nova</span> (1692), and Locke, who was apt to estimate anyone else's capacity for philosophical thinking by the closeness of their ideas to his own, was most favourably impressed. A correspondence ensued which continued until Molyneux's death in 1698. Molyneux's most enduring legacy was a problem that he had originally proposed in a letter of 1688, but which Locke first mentioned in the second edition of the <span class="italic">Essay</span> (bk 2, chap. 9, section 8): if someone born blind had learned to distinguish a globe and a cube by touch alone, and was then given sight, would that person be able to determine purely by sight which one was which? Both Locke and Molyneux thought that he or she would not.<br>
<br>The second edition of the <span class="italic">Essay</span> was published in May 1694. Apart from the changes already mentioned, the section in the chapter &#145;Of power&#146; dealing with freedom was entirely recast, and there was a new chapter, &#145;Of identity and diversity&#146;, in which Locke equated personal identity with continuity of consciousness, and not with continuity of any spiritual substance.<br>
<br>A second edition of the <span class="italic">Two Treatises of Government</span> also appeared in spring 1694. Locke tried to correct the badly printed first edition, but its successor was still worse, much to his annoyance. One reason for its unsatisfactory quality was that though Locke was on friendly terms with the printers (Awnsham and John Churchill), he was so determined to conceal his identity that he conducted all the business relating to the edition indirectly, through Edward Clarke. A third edition, little changed from the second, appeared in 1698.<h2>
<a name="Controversyandpublicservice16951700"></a>Controversy and public service, 1695&#150;1700</h2>Locke spent the early months of 1695 at Oates, working on two very dissimilar though not entirely unrelated projects. One concerned the liberty of the press. The <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span> of 1662 required periodic parliamentary renewal to remain in force, and was due to lapse in 1695. Locke thought the act pernicious and prepared a paper outlining its defects. He also provided comments on a more liberal bill for regulating printing that Edward Clarke introduced into the Commons in March; though this never became law, the <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span> was allowed to lapse and pre-publication censorship of the press ceased.<br>
<br>Locke's other project was a work of apologetics, intended to set out &#145;the doctrine of our Saviour and his apostles, as delivered in the Scriptures, and not as taught by the several sects of Christians&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 7.188). <span class="italic">The Reasonableness of Christianity</span> was published anonymously near the beginning of August 1695, and at once aroused controversy. The enterprise of presenting Christianity as reasonable caused little offence, but many readers regarded the version of Christianity advocated as unduly attenuated: a simple requirement of acknowledging Jesus to be the Messiah seemed to indicate sympathy with the anti-trinitarianism of the Socinians. Locke's earliest and most indefatigable antagonist was John Edwards, in <span class="italic">Some Thoughts Concerning the Several Causes and Occasions of Atheism</span> (1695). Locke replied in a brief, anonymous <span class="italic">Vindication of the Reasonableness of Christianity</span> published in November 1695. A much longer work, the <span class="italic">Second Vindication</span>, appeared in March 1697, in reply to a second assault by Edwards, <span class="italic">Socinianism Unmask'd</span> (1696).<br>
<br>However intemperately expressed, Edwards's suspicions about Socinianism were probably justified. Locke certainly had a large number of Socinian books in his library, and his private notes on the Trinity and the deity of Christ (MS Locke c. 43) suggest that he rejected both doctrines. Locke's caution is understandable: anti-trinitarian sects had been explicitly excluded from the protection afforded by the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> of 1689. In public he was evasive, a stance not calculated to reassure his critics.<br>
<br>In 1695 Locke was again busy with economics. The deterioration of the silver currency was becoming increasingly serious, and in January a committee was set up by the House of Commons to examine proposals for reform. In February, Locke published a brief pamphlet, <span class="italic">Short Observations on a Printed Paper</span>, originally written in 1693 in reply to an anonymous broadsheet by Thomas Neale. During the summer the situation grew steadily worse, so that Locke spent much of the second half of 1695 absorbed in monetary problems. The third edition of the <span class="italic">Essay</span>, which came out about December, was almost unchanged from its predecessor. In September, Locke was chosen, along with others including Newton and Wren, to supply the government with expert advice. His recommendation of recoinage without devaluation was finally adopted as government policy early in November, though it still had to be accepted by parliament. His last publication on economics&#151;<span class="italic">Further Considerations Concerning Raising the Value of Money</span>, a defence of these proposals&#151;appeared towards the end of December. It was the only one of Locke's writings on money to be issued in his own name.<br>
<br>Locke spent the early months of 1696 resting at Oates after the exertions of the previous year. By June he was sufficiently recovered to attend the first meeting of the newly constituted Board of Trade, the successor of the council for trade and plantations to which he had been secretary in 1673&#150;4. The secretary of the new board was the translator of the <span class="italic">Epistola de tolerantia</span>, William Popple; one of the clerks was Locke's former manservant Sylvester Brounower. The business generated by the board occupied a substantial part of Locke's time over the next four years, but it was not without its reward: the annual salary was &pound;1000, and this time it was paid. Locke found himself dealing with problems as varied as linen manufacture in Ireland, the abortive Scottish colony in Darien, the suppression of piracy, and the affairs of the colony of Virginia. In October 1697 he presented a paper to the board on the problems of vagrancy and the reform of the poor law, advocating the suppression of begging, the setting up of workhouses, and the imposition of strict discipline on their inmates; the scheme was rejected by his fellow commissioners. Locke saw the growth of begging and vagrancy as caused by the relaxation of discipline and corruption of manners, but he was aware that at least some of the poor could not support themselves. Lady Masham reported that &#145;He was very charitable to the Poor except such persons as were Idle or Prophane, and spent the Sunday in the Alehouses, and went not to Church&#146;. Locke's accounts show him frequently paying out small sums for the deserving (mostly elderly) poor.<br>
<br>Much of the time that Locke could spare from the affairs of the Board of Trade was spent in pursuing a lengthy controversy with Edward Stillingfleet, now bishop of Worcester. Stillingfleet had read the <span class="italic">Essay</span> soon after it first appeared, and (as he later acknowledged) had not seen it as endangering religion. It was the appearance in 1696 of John Toland's <span class="italic">Christianity not Mysterious</span> that caused him to change his mind. Toland's unrelentingly rationalist approach to theology went well beyond anything Locke advocated, but it was quite apparent to Stillingfleet that his theory of knowledge was taken over without much modification from book 4 of the <span class="italic">Essay</span>. It was this that led Stillingfleet to conclude his <span class="italic">Discourse in Vindication of the Doctrine of the Trinity</span> with a criticism of both Toland and Locke.<br>
<br>Stillingfleet's <span class="italic">Discourse</span> was published in November 1696. Locke immediately set to work on a reply: <span class="italic">A Letter to the Right Reverend Edward, Lord Bishop of Worcester</span> was dated 7 January 1697, and was on sale by mid-March. Stillingfleet's riposte, an <span class="italic">Answer to Mr. Locke's Letter</span>, was on sale at the beginning of May. Locke again responded quickly: <span class="italic">Mr Locke's Reply to the Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of Worcester's Answer to his Letter</span> was dated 29 June and was published by mid-September; it also contained a brief reply to another critic, Thomas Burnet. Stillingfleet responded with his <span class="italic">Answer to Mr. Locke's Second Letter</span>, which he appears to have intended as his final contribution to the controversy. Locke prepared a massive rejoinder, considerably longer than its two predecessors put together: <span class="italic">Mr Locke's Reply to the Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of Worcester's Answer to his Second Letter</span> was completed in May 1698, though not published until the end of the year. Stillingfleet was by then in no condition to respond. His health had broken down, and he died on 27 March 1699.<br>
<br>The exchange of letters with Stillingfleet revealed in public Locke's defects as a controversialist, already apparent in the anonymous exchanges that had followed the <span class="italic">Letter on Toleration</span> and the <span class="italic">Reasonableness of Christianity</span>. Locke admired Hooker, but did not imitate his urbanity and sense of grand strategy; instead the reader is offered page after page of close-range pummelling, interspersed with episodes of sarcasm and bad temper. Locke was aware that he was prone to anger; in his life he seems to have kept this under control, but not always in his writings.<br>
<br>Some of the issues raised in the controversy with Stillingfleet reappeared in the material added to the fourth edition of the <span class="italic">Essay</span>, which came out in December 1699; it was the last edition published during Locke's lifetime. Other major changes included two entirely new chapters: &#145;Of enthusiasm&#146; and &#145;Of the association of ideas&#146;. One planned addition, like the earlier <span class="italic">Examination of Malebranche</span>, grew too large and was turned into a separate treatise: this was <span class="italic">The Conduct of the Understanding</span>, which Locke began in April 1697. He continued adding material to it in the years that followed, and it remained unfinished at his death; his executors published it in 1706. The <span class="italic">Conduct</span> is the only one of Locke's works that shows any clear evidence of having been influenced by Francis Bacon. A less easily dateable work from about this time is <span class="italic">The Elements of Natural Philosophy</span>, a short introduction said to have been written for the use of the Mashams' son Francis, which was first published in 1720.<br>
<br>A French translation of the <span class="italic">Essay</span> was published at Amsterdam in 1700; the translator was a young protestant refugee, Pierre Coste, who had already translated <span class="italic">Some Thoughts Concerning Education</span> (1695) and the <span class="italic">Reasonableness of Christianity</span> (1696). Coste had come to Oates in August 1697 as tutor to Francis Masham, and he was able to discuss his translation in detail with Locke. A Latin translation by Ezekiel Burridge appeared in 1701. Both these translations helped make Locke's philosophy more widely accessible to readers abroad.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears17001704"></a>Last years, 1700&#150;1704</h2>In June 1700 Locke resigned from the Board of Trade. He had long suffered from a weakness of the lungs, and found the cold and smoke of London in winter unbearable. In January 1698 he had been summoned to Kensington Palace for an interview with the king, apparently in order to be offered an important (though not certainly identifiable) post. By his own account the journey nearly killed him  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 6.307), and his health never fully recovered.<br>
<br>The last four years of Locke's life were spent quietly at Oates, his visits to London becoming less frequent and very much briefer than before. He published nothing after the fourth edition of the <span class="italic">Essay</span>, though he continued to note down minor improvements, incorporated into the posthumous fifth edition (1706). When his health allowed he worked steadily on his last major project, <span class="italic">Paraphrases and Notes on the Epistles of St Paul</span>. His intention was to publish the complete series by instalments, at three-monthly intervals; the first of these, on <span class="roman">Galatians</span>, was in proof by August 1704, but nothing appeared before his death. The completed parts, on <span class="roman">Galatians</span>, <span class="roman">1 and 2 Corinthians</span>, <span class="roman">Romans</span>, and <span class="roman">Ephesians</span>, were published by his executors between 1705 and 1707. Two other works date from Locke's last years: <span class="italic">A Discourse of Miracles</span> was written in 1702; an unfinished <span class="italic">Fourth Letter on Toleration</span>, a response to a belated reopening of the old controversy by Proast, was begun during the last months of Locke's life. Both were published in 1706.<br>
<br>One close friend Locke made in his last years was Anthony Collins, the deist. Locke's letters to him are warm, even effusive, and Collins seems not to have made Locke aware of his own disbelief in revelation. Locke's last letter to him, delivered after his death, describes this life as &#145;a scene of vanity which soon passes away and affords no solid satisfaction but in the consciousness of doing well and in the hopes of an other life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 8.419).<br>
<br>Early in 1704 Locke's health started to deteriorate, and by the summer he knew he might not have much longer to live. In April he drew up his will, and in September added a codicil acknowledging his authorship of the works he had published anonymously. During the summer he grew steadily weaker. He had previously enjoyed taking exercise by riding, but this was now beyond him; instead, a specially designed chaise was constructed in which he could be driven about. By October he was too frail even for this, and could only be carried out into the garden to sit in the autumn sun. His mind remained lucid until the end. He died peacefully sitting in the chair in his study on the afternoon of 28 October, as Lady Masham was reading the <span class="roman">Psalms</span>. Three days later he was buried in the churchyard of the parish church at High Laver.<br>
<br>Locke had never lived extravagantly, and he died a wealthy man. His estate included just over &pound;12,000 in cash and easily realizable assets, some freehold land in Somerset subsequently sold for &pound;615, and various personal effects including a library of over 4000 books and pamphlets. The main beneficiary of his will was a young lawyer who had been looking after Locke's affairs for some years, Peter King, the grandson of Locke's uncle Peter, his father's younger brother. King received the majority of the estate, including Locke's manuscripts and half his library; the other half, together with &pound;3000, went to Francis Masham. Masham's share of the library was later dispersed, and few of the books that it contained are known to have survived. King became lord chancellor in 1725, and was raised to the peerage as Baron King of Ockham. His descendants, from 1838 earls of Lovelace, retained Locke's papers until the middle of the twentieth century; most are now in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.<br>
<br>Locke's works were first published in a collected edition in 1714, and were reprinted at regular intervals until the &#145;twelfth&#146; (actually thirteenth) edition of 1824. There were also frequent editions of individual works, especially the <span class="italic">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</span> and <span class="italic">Some Thoughts Concerning Education</span>. Locke's philosophy was immensely influential in the eighteenth century, not least in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, where it soon replaced the scholastic doctrines in which Locke had been educated. The burden on undergraduates, and others, was lightened by an abridgement of the <span class="italic">Essay</span> made by John Wynne of Jesus College, Oxford, in 1696, and reprinted frequently in the following century.<br>
<br>Locke's political writings earned him a place in the whig pantheon, along with Milton, Harrington, and Algernon Sidney, but were less intensively studied. During the half-century from the death of Queen Anne (1714) to the end of the Seven Years' War (1763) the <span class="italic">Two Treatises of Government</span> was reprinted only once, except in editions of the collected works. The rising tide of discontent in the American colonies gave the <span class="italic">Second Treatise</span> a renewed relevance; it was frequently cited in debates on both sides of the Atlantic, and was published (without the <span class="italic">First Treatise</span>) in Boston in 1773, the first American printing. Locke's account of the origin and limits of government has continued to exert a profound influence on American political thought.<br>
<br>The epistemological doctrines of the <span class="italic">Essay</span> were subjected to acute criticism by other philosophers from Berkeley onwards, but this did little to shake their acceptability to the educated public. Locke was seen as having given a plain unmetaphysical account of the workings of the human mind that could serve as a complement to Newton's account of the physical universe. In the early nineteenth century Locke's standing began to decline: neither his doctrines nor his literary style appealed to a romantic sensibility more attuned to deep insights emerging from Germany, while thinkers faithful to empiricism were more likely to find what they needed in Bentham or in Bacon. In the later nineteenth and earlier twentieth centuries, as philosophy in Britain became increasingly professionalized, Bacon's reputation declined, but Locke's did not greatly revive: he was generally seen as a historically important but rather dull figure, a target for the nimbler intellects of Berkeley and Hume, though in the English-speaking world at least his position in the philosophical canon was never in jeopardy. Since 1950 his standing has steadily improved, partly through the stimulus to historical enquiry caused by the recovery of his papers, but mainly because of a revival in philosophical realism.<br>
