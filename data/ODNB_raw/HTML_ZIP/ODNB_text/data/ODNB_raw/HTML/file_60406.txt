<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bush,  Alan Dudley</span>  (1900&#150;1995), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born in Dulwich, London, on 22 December 1900, the son of Alfred Walter Bush (1869&#150;1935), director of W. J. Bush &amp; Co., manufacturing chemists, and his wife, Alice Maud Brinsley (1870&#150;1951). He was educated privately, then at Highgate grammar school (1911&#150;17). He studied composition under Frederick Corder and piano with Tobias Matthay at the Royal Academy of Music (1918&#150;22), gaining a Thalberg scholarship, the Phillimore piano prize (both 1920), and a Carnegie award for his first string quartet (1923). After leaving the Royal Academy of Music, his piano studies continued with Benno Moiseiwitsch, Mabel Lander, and Artur Schnabel. As a pianist he had a heavy touch, although his technique was strong and reliable. He studied composition (1927&#150;32) with John Ireland, a formative influence on his music. Meanwhile he returned to the Royal Academy of Music as professor in 1925, remaining there until 1978. Of his numerous students, most who have made a mark came from his last teaching years, including the composers Edward Gregson and Roger Steptoe, and the pianist Graham Johnson. He studied philosophy and musicology at Berlin University under Johannes Wolf and Friedrich Blume (1929&#150;31); close contact with Bertolt Brecht and Hanns Eisler influenced his political views. On 31 March 1931 he married Nancy Rachel Head (<i>c</i>.1905&#150;1991), daughter of Frederick Dewas Head, lawyer and journalist, and sister of the song composer Michael Head. She was a writer and librettist, who collaborated with Bush on all of his operas and operettas, and on many vocal works. They had three daughters, one of whom, Alice, died in a road accident at the age of seven.<br>
<br>Bush joined the Communist Party in 1935, having dallied briefly with the Independent Labour Party and the Labour Party. Surprisingly, the conservative Royal Academy of Music proved a haven for the staunch Marxist: a few liberally minded admired him, and he was observed by many as something of a novelty. He rarely attended formal occasions such as prize day, or any function where royalty might be present, but uncharacteristically, at a special dinner in London, he was once seen carrying a flaming Christmas pudding from the kitchens, followed by a long stream of tailcoated serving staff. Believing too much patriotism a bad thing, he once said, &#145;It's high time we had a revolution in this country&#146;, unconcerned about the inevitable loss of life, despite having been a private in the Royal Army Medical Corps (1941&#150;5). In a less tolerant country he would certainly have been imprisoned, or worse. But he was merely ignored, both politically, and, which is a pity, as a composer. He nevertheless played an active role: as adviser and conductor of the London Labour Choral Union (1929&#150;40); founder (1936) and president (1941&#150;76) of the Workers' Music Association; founder of the William Morris Musical Society (1941); chairman of the Composers' Guild (1947&#150;8), later vice-president; and examiner for the Associated Board (Ceylon, India, and Australia, 1932&#150;3). On concert tours to eastern and western Europe and the USSR he conducted British music, including his own.<br>
<br>Bush was tall, handsome, straight-backed, and, when avoiding politics, which was rare, had great charm. Towards both sexes his manners were impeccable. He had a touch of charisma as conductor and speaker, though shyness sometimes made him clumsy. There was no noticeable sense of humour, but when challenged (which he seemed to like) he grinned wryly. The dogmatic Bush never said &#145;You may be right&#146;, but rather &#145;That's all very well, but &hellip;&#146;, and there was a plethora of &#145;buts&#146;. He was dictatorial, convinced that he was right: when examining he believed his own pupils to be best, nominating them for special mention. His four operas were all overtly political; the first, <span class="italic">Wat Tyler</span>, won an Arts Council award (1951). A notable early work was the energetic <span class="italic">Dialectic</span> for string quartet (1929), but the late 1940s were his best period, with the moving <span class="italic">Lidice</span> for unaccompanied chorus (1947), the violin concerto (1948), and the remarkable <span class="italic">Nottingham Symphony</span> (1949). Other landmarks were <span class="italic">Voices of the Prophets</span> (1953), commissioned by Peter Pears, and a choral work, <span class="italic">Mandela Speaking</span> (1985).<br>
<br>Bush's sight failed towards the end of his life. Nancy, his devoted wife, died in 1991; he ceased composing in 1992. He died on 31 October 1995 in Watford General Hospital; he was survived by two daughters, Catherine and Rachel. He was cremated at Golders Green on 7 November after a well-attended service. During his last years he was not informed about changes in the USSR, his family and friends not wishing to upset him.<br>
