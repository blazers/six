<span class="headword">Mawson,  Matthias</span>  (1683&#150;1770), <span class="occ">bishop of Ely</span>, was born in Chiswick, Middlesex, one of at least two sons of Thomas Mawson, a prosperous brewer, and his wife, Elizabeth, of Fleet Street. He was baptized on 19 July 1683 at St Dunstan-in-the-West, London. Mawson attended St Paul's School, then Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, from 1701, where he proceeded BA in 1704, MA in 1708, BD in 1716, and DD in 1725. He was made a fellow in 1707, moderator in 1708, and taxor in 1709, and became master of the college in 1724 and vice-chancellor in 1730. Mawson was known as a reformer while he was in the latter post. He tightened up academic requirements, reduced unnecessary transference from college to college, and stopped the practice of exhuming bodies from nearby graveyards for use as cadavers. Between 1727 and 1730 he was a royal chaplain. He took his first parish, Conington in Cambridgeshire, soon after completing his DD, and became rector of Hadstoke in Essex in 1733. Barely a year after he accepted the latter living, Mawson was offered the bishopric of Gloucester, a post he turned down. However, in 1738 he accepted an appointment to the see of Llandaff at the urging of his friends, and went on to become bishop of Chichester in 1740 and bishop of Ely in 1754. He died on 23 November 1770, aged eighty-seven, at his home in Kensington Square, London. He was buried in Ely Cathedral. He never married.<br>
<br>Mawson seems to have been a latitudinarian. Politically he was a whig, arguing for limitations on the power of the crown. He aligned himself with the duke of Newcastle, and, while at Chichester, worked assiduously for the duke's interest in Sussex. Religiously Mawson was a low-churchman. He urged toleration and unity over doctrinal precision, and preached reconciliation rather than prosecution. He believed that many of the divisions in religion came from &#145;enthusiasm&#146;, which caused men zealously to guard doctrines and worship practices arising out of narrow formulations of Christianity, and to coerce others to accept them. He was tolerant of most protestant sects, but could not feel the same about Catholicism. Particularly in the wake of the Jacobite rising of 1745, Mawson urged greater controls over Catholics since they continued to pose a significant political threat.<br>
<br>Mawson gained great wealth both from his official income and from his inheritance (the latter of which he received when his brother, who ran the family business, died), but was an extremely generous benefactor. During his lifetime he lent some &pound;6000 or &pound;7000 for new buildings at King's College, Cambridge, and donated thousands of pounds of his own money for improvements at Chichester and Ely cathedrals. In 1754 he presented Corpus Christi College with lands sufficient to endow twelve scholarships. Further, he gave significant sums to governments for improving lands and renovating civic buildings. At his death, he bequeathed &pound;9000 to his old college for scholarships and building projects. The balance of his fortune went to a nephew, a niece, and two grandnephews.<br>
<br>As bishop and churchman, Mawson garnered respect and appreciation. In 1749 William Clarke, rector of Buxted in Sussex and prominent antiquary, observed that he was &#145;a better sort of man than most of the mitred order. He is indeed awkward, absent, &amp;c., but then he has no ambition, no desire to please, and is privately munificent, when the world thinks him parsimonious&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 4.459). A number of his sermons, preached to the House of Commons, the House of Lords, and to other institutions on anniversary occasions, were published separately.<br>
