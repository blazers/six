<span class="headword">Shakespear,  William Henry Irvine</span>  (1878&#150;1915), <span class="occ">diplomat and explorer</span>, was born at Multan, in what is now Pakistan, on 29 October 1878, the eldest son of William Henry Sullivan Shakespear, of the Indian forestry service, and his wife, Anne Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davidson. A natural athlete throughout his school career, he was educated at Portsmouth grammar school (1889&#150;1893) and King William's College in the Isle of Man (1893&#150;1896), and passed out of Sandhurst early in 1898. He never married.<br>
<br>After some six years' service in the Indian army, mostly in Rawalpindi and Bombay, during which he learnt Arabic, Persian, Pushtu, and Urdu, Shakespear transferred to the political department of the government of India. In 1904 he was appointed consul at Bandar-e-&#145;Abbas and assistant to the political resident in the Persian Gulf, Sir Percy Cox; at the time of his appointment he was the youngest consul in the Indian administration.<br>
<br>Although Shakespear is best known for his explorations of Arabia, he was also a pioneer motorist. Early in 1907 he bought an 8-horsepower single-cylinder Rover, and left Bushehr in April to drive to England through Persia, Turkey, Greece, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Croatia to Italy. Only one European had made part of this journey by car before, a Romanian driving from Bucharest to Tehran two years earlier. There were no paved roads between Persia and Italy.<br>
<br>In April 1909 Shakespear was appointed political agent in Kuwait, the official position which he held for most of the rest of his life. The years immediately before the First World War were a complex period in the politics of the Arabian peninsula and the gulf. First, Mubarak al-Sabah, amir of Kuwait between 1896 and 1916, who had come to power after assassinating his brother, signed a fairly loose agreement with Britain in 1899 in which he agreed not to grant any part of his territory to a third party without Britain's consent. Second, in January 1902, &#145;Abd al-&#145;Aziz ibn &#145;Abd al-Rahman al-Sa&#145;ud (Ibn Sa&#145;ud), who, together with his family, had long enjoyed the friendship and protection of the amir of Kuwait, recaptured Riyadh from his rivals, the al-Rashid, setting off a chain of events which culminated in the foundation of the modern state of Saudi Arabia some thirty years later. In 1905 the Ottoman state appointed Ibn Sa&#145;ud <i>qa'immaqam</i> of southern Najd; in 1906 a raiding party under his leadership killed his main rival, the Ottomans' principal ally &#145;Abd al-Aziz ibn al-Rashid, and in consequence Turkish forces withdrew from most of northern and north-western Najd.<br>
<br>In 1906 and 1907 Ibn Sa&#145;ud made a number of overtures to the government of India through various intermediaries, indicating that he too would value British protection in some form or other. After his appointment to Kuwait in 1909, Shakespear was involved in conveying these wishes to his superiors in India and in the British legation in Constantinople, although both Ibn Sa&#145;ud's appeals and Shakespear's tenacious if measured support of them tended to fall on deaf ears.<br>
<br>In February 1910 Shakespear met Ibn Sa&#145;ud for the first time, at the palace of Mubarak of Kuwait, and took the first recorded photograph of him. The two men seem to have developed an immediate liking for one another, and the amir invited the political agent to visit him in Riyadh the following year. The meeting took place at Thaj in eastern Arabia, since Ibn Sa&#145;ud was on campaign, still intent both on the complete reduction of the al-Rashid, who were still a force to be reckoned with in northern Najd, and on driving the Turks out of Arabia altogether, which had begun to seem more feasible after the Young Turk revolution in 1909. By mid-1913 Ibn Sa&#145;ud, in spite of a renewed warning from Shakespear in May that he could expect no support from Britain, dispatched his forces to al-Hasa and ejected the Ottoman garrison. Again Ibn Sa&#145;ud asked for British recognition as ruler of the area; again Shakespear was obliged to tell him in December 1913 that this could not be granted. In May 1914 Ibn Sa&#145;ud accepted the title of <i>wali</i> of Najd (including al-Hasa) from the Ottomans.<br>
<br>In addition to his officially sanctioned political activities Shakespear is known for his meticulously recorded excursions to the interior of Arabia between 1909 and 1914. Each journey was registered with camera and sextant, and with entries in a daily log. His longest journey was undertaken between January and May 1914, from Kuwait to the Suez Canal via Riyadh (where he was the guest of Ibn Sa&#145;ud), Burayda, and Jauf, a distance of just over 1800 miles in 111 days, across what was mostly previously uncharted country.<br>
<br>From Egypt, Shakespear went to England in a final attempt to convince his superiors to take Ibn Sa&#145;ud more seriously; for a while, it remained an uphill task. However, a few weeks after the outbreak of war it dawned on the India Office that there might, after all, be some value in cultivating an Arabian ruler whose hostility to the Turks was not in doubt. Shakespear was sent back from England to Kuwait to transmit an urgent message to Ibn Sa&#145;ud, in effect an offer of the treaty of alliance which he had been seeking for so long. Shakespear left Kuwait on 12 December, and met Ibn Sa&#145;ud 200 miles north of Riyadh, where he was campaigning against the Shammar (still firm allies of the Turks) on 31 December. The task of convincing his friend was complicated by the indifference with which the government of India had treated him in the past; nevertheless, Shakespear managed to draft a treaty that Ibn Sa&#145;ud agreed to sign, though he could not be sure that it would be acceptable to his own superiors in Simla and London.<br>
<br>On 24 January 1915 Ibn Sa&#145;ud's forces fought the Shammar at Jarrab; Shakespear, who refused, as always, to exchange his military uniform for desert dress, was killed by a stray bullet while on a ridge overlooking the battlefield. Ibn Sa&#145;ud wrote to Sir Percy Cox:<blockquote>our beloved friend Captain Shakespear was hit from a distance by one of the enemy's shots and died. I offer my sincere condolences &hellip; We pressed him to leave us before the battle, but he refused to do so and was insistent on being with us. (Winstone, 211)</blockquote>In December 1915 a treaty between Ibn Sa&#145;ud and the government of the United Kingdom was concluded, along the lines of Shakespear's draft  (Leatherdale, 372&#150;3). As it turned out, Ibn Sa&#145;ud played no great part in the First World War, and the most significant (although perhaps somewhat exaggerated) Arab participation came from the western part of the Arabian peninsula. Subsequently British support was crucial to Ibn Sa&#145;ud's survival in the late 1920s (especially to his victory over those of his erstwhile tribal supporters whose growing fanaticism nearly cost him his life) and also to his emergence by the beginning of the 1930s as ruler of the state that bears his family's name.<br>
<br>Much like his contemporary Gerard Leachman, Shakespear was a loner, a poor diplomat and administrator, but a gallant and intrepid soldier and explorer. Although his Arabic was fluent and idiomatic, he remained the quintessential British officer, resisting the temptation (if he ever felt it) to wear Arab dress in the desert. He also lacked the starry-eyed faith of some of his contemporaries in the possible effectiveness of tribal forces in modern warfare. On the other hand, his shrewd assessment of the waning of Ottoman authority in the northern Arabia peninsula, and his understanding of Ibn Sa&#145;ud's potential in the politics of the region, cannot be faulted. Had Shakespear lived, and had he in fact succeeded in harnessing Ibn Sa&#145;ud's energies more thoroughly to the imperial war effort, a very different post-war Arab world might well have emerged.<br>
