<span class="headword">Moulson, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1568&#150;1638), <span class="occ">merchant and politician</span>, was the second son of Thomas Moulson of Hargrave Stubbs, Cheshire, and his wife, Alice, the daughter of John Aldersey of Spurstow and his wife, Anne. It is reputed that he received an education at Tarvin grammar school. Some time before 1590 he left his native Cheshire for Stade in northern Germany, where he traded for several years as a cloth merchant. During this time, in 1593, he was admitted to the freedom of the London Grocers' Company. After returning to England he married, on 15 December 1600, Ann (1576&#150;1661) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95062/', "Moulson, Ann, Lady Moulson")</script>], the daughter of Anthony Radcliffe, a merchant taylor of London. He settled in the London parish of St Christopher-le-Stocks and continued his business through factors. The couple had two children, but both died in infancy. By 1606 Moulson was the biggest exporter of northern kerseys in London, and as such became a leading member of the Company of Merchant Adventurers; he served as its treasurer in 1616&#150;17 and rose to the governorship by 1624, a position which he held until his death. He was also a founder member of the revived French Company in 1611 and was admitted to the court of assistants of the Grocers' Company in 1613; two years later he served as the company's third warden.<br>
<br>As a successful and therefore wealthy cloth merchant, Moulson was naturally absorbed into the ranks of London's ruling &eacute;lite. Appointed an assistant of the City's company for the plantation of Ireland in 1615, he was a common councilman by 1617, a member of the prestigious Bridgehouse committee by 1618, and the City's auditor from 1620 to 1622. In 1623, then in his mid-fifties, he was named an alderman and appointed sheriff. Five years later he was elected an MP for London (even though he had not yet achieved knightly status or served as mayor) after London's voters rejected the corporation's own candidates for having supported the forced loan of 1626&#150;7. During his time in parliament he drew attention, among other things, to the threat to England's cloth trade posed by recent Catholic military successes in Germany and spoke of his fear for the safety of protestantism at home. In 1634 he served as lord mayor and was knighted at Greenwich.<br>
<br>Moulson's religious sympathies were clearly Calvinist&#151;in his will of 1636 he described himself as a member of the elect&#151;and perhaps even puritan, for during the mid-1630s he and his fellow vestrymen of St Christopher-le-Stocks resolved not to hold meetings on the Sabbath and to appoint a lecturer, Mr Hood, to whom Moulson later bequeathed 40<i>s</i>. Shortly thereafter he fell ill. He declined to serve as president of Christ's Hospital in February 1637, and died on 6 December 1638. He was buried in the vault of St Christopher's on 10 January 1639. A generous benefactor of the poor, and of the companies to which he belonged, he also remembered Hargrave, the parish where he was brought up, and its combined school and chapel, which he had built at his own cost in 1627.<br>
