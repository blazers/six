<span class="headword">Hill,  James John</span>  (1811&#150;1882), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Birmingham, the son of Daniel Hill of Broad Street, Birmingham. He was educated at Hazlewood School and studied at John Vincent Barber's academy in Birmingham, where Thomas Creswick was a fellow student. He worked for some years in Birmingham, chiefly as a portrait painter; among his sitters were the philanthropist the Revd Dr Samuel Wilson Warneford and Mrs Glover, founder of Spring Hill College.<br>
<br>Hill moved to London in 1839, and in 1842 he was elected a member of the Society of British Artists. He was a frequent and popular contributor to its exhibitions until 1881, principally showing portraits, rustic scenes, and figures. He also exhibited at the British Institution (1848&#150;55) and the Royal Academy (1845&#150;68). He painted many portraits and several pictures of horses and dogs for Lady Burdett-Coutts, one of his most regular patrons. After some years in London, he began to concentrate on the fantasy subjects for which he is best-known. These were usually half-length figures, either singly or in small groups, studied from life, and with landscape backgrounds painted from nature. Many of the most effective were Irish studies, made on his frequent visits to Ireland from 1854. Several of his works were purchased by Herbert Ingram, founder of the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, and were published as lithographs in the weekly. He also painted figures in the works of the landscape painter Henry Bright. Later in his career Hill again changed direction and concentrated on landscapes, but these did not achieve the success of his rustic figures. He died of bronchitis at Sutton House, West Hill, Highgate, Middlesex, on 27 January 1882.<br>
