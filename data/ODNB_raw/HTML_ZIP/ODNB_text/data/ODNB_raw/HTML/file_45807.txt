<span class="headword">Zinkeisen,  Anna Katrina</span>  (1901&#150;1976), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born in Kilcreggan, Dunbartonshire, on 28 August 1901, the second daughter of Victor Zinkeisen, a research chemist whose family, settled in Scotland for over a century, was of German origin, and Claire Bolton-Charles. Their youngest child was a son, Jack, and the family moved to Harrow, Middlesex, in 1909. Zinkeisen began her art studies young at a technical school, and in 1917 she entered the Royal Academy Schools. There she studied painting under Sir George Clausen, Glyn Philpot, and Charles Sims, although Sir William Orpen suggested that she should work in the sculpture school. Following this training she received her first commission, from the firm of Wedgwood, for some circular plaques. The two reliefs <span class="italic">Adam</span> and <span class="italic">Earth, Fire and Water</span> were awarded a silver medal at the Exposition des Arts D&eacute;coratifs in Paris in 1925. From about 1922 until her marriage she shared a studio in Yeoman's Row, south-west London, with her sister Doris Clare (who was best known for her portraits and designs for the stage). At eighteen Anna first exhibited in the Royal Academy, and she thereafter showed regularly there and at the Royal Institute of Oil Painters. Her self-portrait <span class="italic">AKZ</span> (oil, 1925) won a silver medal at the academy in 1925. In 1927 she exhibited <span class="italic">The Olympians</span> and <span class="italic">The Tilting Yard</span> at the Society of Women Artists.<br>
<br>Anna Zinkeisen designed magazine covers and book jackets, including several for Barbara Cartland and Doris Leslie, as well as painting portraits. She illustrated many books with her lively and witty line drawings, including A. P. Herbert's <span class="italic">She-Shanties</span> (1926) and <span class="italic">Plain Jane</span> (1927) (both published by T. Fisher Unwin, London). She created the well-known image of the elegant male smoker who was represented on De Reszke cigarette advertisements and packets. In 1928 she married Colonel Guy R. N. Heseltine MC (<i>d</i>. 1967), and they had one daughter, Julia. They lived for many years in St Andrew's Place, Regent's Park, and later also had a cottage in Suffolk.<br>
<br>In 1934 Anna Zinkeisen was commissioned to paint a mural, <span class="italic">The Four Seasons</span>, for the ballroom of the liner <i>Queen Mary</i>, which was destroyed after the war; she was commissioned in 1947 to execute a new work for the liner, <i>The Chase</i>, for a smaller dance room and restaurant. She executed many other murals during the 1950s and 1960s. During the Second World War, Zinkeisen worked as a volunteer from 1939 in the first aid post at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, becoming an officer in the St John Ambulance Brigade. In her spare time she painted <span class="italic">First Aid Post by Candlelight</span> (oil, n.d.; Imperial War Museum); another oil painting of this period, <span class="italic">Operation in Progress</span> (1944), is in the collection of ICI. She also drew severe injuries suffered by victims of the bombing; <span class="italic">Arm and Hand Shell Wound</span>, <span class="italic">Shell Fragment Wound</span>, and <span class="italic">Internal Thigh Wound</span> are examples of her meticulous draughtsmanship now owned by the Royal College of Surgeons. In 1949 she and her sister Doris executed a ceiling painting in the Russell-Cotes Museum in Bournemouth. An evocation of classical gods and goddesses frolicking in the heavens at dawn, it is a characteristically sprightly pastiche of Regency decoration. Her later portraits include those of the duke of Edinburgh (1956), Sir Robert Mark (1974), and Sister Grace Alexander of the Royal Homoeopathic Hospital (1976), the last portrait she completed. Anna Zinkeisen died in hospital in Holborn, London, after a short illness, on 22 September 1976. The funeral service was held at Burgh parish church, Woodbridge, Suffolk, and following cremation at Ipswich her ashes were interred at Burgh parish church in her husband's grave. A memorial service was held on 2 November in Chelsea Old Church. A member of the Pytchley hunt, Zinkeisen was elegant and beautiful all her life, with fair, reddish-brown hair, and green eyes.<br>
