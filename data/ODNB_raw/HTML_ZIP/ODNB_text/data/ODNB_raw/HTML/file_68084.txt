<span class="headword">Southwell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Harris]</span>,  Anne</span>, Lady Southwell  (<em>bap. </em>1574, <em>d.</em> 1636), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at Cornworthy Priory, Cornworthy, Devon, the eldest child of Elizabeth Pomeroy (<i>d</i>. 1634) and Thomas Harris MP (1547&#150;1610, knighted by 1604). She was baptized at St Peter's, Cornworthy, on 22 August 1574. Her siblings included Sir Edward, who became chief justice of the king's bench in Munster, Ireland; Sir Christopher, who was killed at Ostend, and Honor, who married Sir Hugh Harris of Scotland. Because Thomas Harris was serjeant-at-law at the Middle Temple Inn and MP for four towns, the family may have lived in London occasionally. No record of Anne's education remains, although her compositions illustrate an understanding of theology, literature, rhetoric, and music.<br>
<br>Anne married Thomas Southwell (1575?&#150;1626), of Spixworth, Norfolk, at the church of St Clement Danes in London on 24 June 1594. He was knighted on 23 July 1603 and at a later date sent to Munster for the plantation of Ireland. Through Thomas's mother, Alice Southwell (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Cornwallis), Anne may have met the essayist William Cornwallis and his friends John Donne and Thomas Overbury. The Southwell family also enjoyed other literary and courtly connections, the most famous being Robert Southwell, poet and martyr for the Roman cause. Anne Southwell, however, was herself a staunch protestant who mocked Roman &#145;Popelings&#146;. Her early writing included &#145;Answere[s]&#146; to two &#145;Newes&#146; reports, one by Donne and the other by Overbury, that were published, with her initials, in Overbury's notorious book <span class="italic">A Wife now the Widow of Sir Thomas Overburye</span> (1614).<br>
<br>After Sir Thomas's death in 1626 Anne married Captain Henry Sibthorpe, who probably gave her the folios of Folger, MS V.b.198 that with his help she turned into an uncommon commonplace book. The two collected her compositions as well as works they liked by others, some of which could prove useful as models. Occasionally Sibthorpe served as a scribe and, as is clear from marginalia (fol. 49<i>r</i>), he also mentored his wife's writing. After Anne's death he may have added some explanatory titles and inserted a few of the works, especially those to or about prestigious people, to make the volume a &#145;monument of an Endlesse affection&#146;, as he described it on the folios he added  (fols. 73 and 74).<br>
<br>In 1628 Anne and Henry Sibthorpe settled in Clerkenwell, Middlesex, and, in 1631, they moved to Acton. They lived near St Mary's Church, in &#145;tenaments&#146; rented from Robert Johnson, court lutenist and composer. Entries in the commonplace book show Anne's interaction with her neighbours, and especially with the curate Roger Cocks.<br>
<br>Lady Southwell's compositions suggest that she was an intelligent and spirited woman. She claimed lethal ladies of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, Jael and Judith, as her role models. With a voice of authority, she wrote to and about people such as Henry Cary, Viscount Falkland; Bishop Adams of Limerick; the duchess of Lennox; and the kings of Bohemia and Sweden. She could also banter with politicians, as she did in petitioning Richard Boyle, earl of Cork, for the land rights of Sir Richard Edgcumbe (Chatsworth, Lismore MSS, box 14, fol. 160; see also fol. 174). Her greatest contribution may be the way that she often urged mutuality in marriage, based on Christ's example with his spouse, the church. She warned against dangers such as the &#145;heresy&#146; that females have so little wit, &#145;as but to serve men they are only fitt&#146;  (Folger MS V.b.198, fol. 26<i>v</i>). BL, MS Lansdowne 740, fols. 142&#150;167<i>v</i>, includes Anne's two long meditations on the third and fourth commandments, expansions from poems in the Folger volume. Although at first the meditations probably were meant to honour James I, the final dedication evidently addressed Charles I. Lady Southwell died at the home owned by Robert Johnson's widow in Acton on 2 October 1636 and was buried on 5 October in the chancel of St Mary's Church, where a plaque on the back wall still commemorates her. Her husband survived her.<br>

<h2>Wealth at death &nbsp;</h2>
<p> Sibthorpe paid little for keeping of his men in Cork: <i>CSP Ire.</i> &middot; rented &#145;tenements&#146; in Acton; therefore probably little money left; costly clothing in inventory of &#145;Aparel&#146; suggests former wealth<br>
