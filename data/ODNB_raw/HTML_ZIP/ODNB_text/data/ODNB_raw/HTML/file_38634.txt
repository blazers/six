<span class="headword">Clouston, Sir  Thomas Smith</span>  (1840&#150;1915), <span class="occ">asylum physician</span>, was born on 22 April 1840 at Nisthouse, Orkney, the youngest of the four sons of Robert Clouston, an Orkney laird, and Janet Smith of Stromness. He was educated at West End Academy in Aberdeen, studied medicine at Edinburgh University, and graduated MD in 1861, receiving a gold medal for his thesis on the nervous system of the lobster. He worked initially as an assistant physician with Dr David Skae at the Royal Edinburgh Asylum, before his appointment as medical superintendent of the Cumberland and Westmorland Asylum in Carlisle in 1863. He became LRCP (Edin.) in 1860 and was elected a fellow in 1873. On 27 April 1864 he married Harriet Segur Williamson (<i>b</i>. 1834/5), a widow, the daughter of Reuben Storer of New Haven, Connecticut; they had two sons and a daughter. One son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64389/', "Joseph Storer Clouston")</script>, became a humorous writer.<br>
<br>The ten years at Carlisle were formative for Clouston, and he spent his time learning the practicalities of asylum management and writing a steady stream of articles for medical journals. In 1870 he was awarded the Fothergillian gold medal for his paper on the use of medication in the treatment of insanity. In 1872 he became co-editor with Henry Maudsley of the <span class="italic">Journal of Mental Science</span>. The following year he was appointed superintendent of the Royal Edinburgh Asylum, and he remained in this post until 1908. Clouston embarked on a bold rebuilding programme designed to improve patient care. His most ambitious scheme achieved fruition in 1894 with the opening of Craighouse, a large Gothic mansion catering for upper-class patients. Clouston saw insanity as representing a loss of self-control, and held that it was the role of the asylum, in the form of a strict and ordered regime, to help patients regain mastery over their unruly behaviour.<br>
<br>In 1879 Edinburgh University appointed Clouston as its first lecturer in mental disease, a post which contemporaries judged he occupied with ability and flair. Clouston was also a prolific author, producing a wide range of material for medical journals, textbooks, asylum reports, pamphlets, and newspapers. He wrote two clinical books, <span class="italic">Clinical Lectures on Mental Diseases</span> (1883) and <span class="italic">The Neuroses of Development</span> (1891), and four popular works: <span class="italic">The Hygiene of Mind</span> (1906), <span class="italic">Unsoundness of Mind</span> (1911), <span class="italic">Before I Wed</span> (1913), and <span class="italic">Morals and Brain</span> (1914). His numerous clinical papers appeared regularly in all the leading British journals and also, to a lesser extent, in the American and European ones. His work embraced every major nineteenth-century psychiatric concern, including alcoholism, general paralysis, asylum management, and medico-legal matters. Many of his peers felt that Clouston's most significant contribution to psychiatry was his description of the &#145;insanity of adolescence&#146;, which he defined as an inherited developmental disease arising in early adult life and often leading to mental deterioration in later years. Clouston's concept was later overshadowed by Kraepelin's delineation of &#145;dementia praecox&#146;, a condition subsequently renamed schizophrenia.<br>
<br>From his initial empirical studies Clouston increasingly moved to consider the wider implications of mental disease for society. He used his annual asylum reports, which were widely reported in the national press, to speak directly to the population. Greatly influenced by the prevailing climate of scientific naturalism, he outlined the &#145;laws&#146; of human existence, and in his later books he fused religious and scientific precepts to exhort the public to healthy living. Clouston took a prominent part in the establishment of a council of public morals in Scotland and was interested in eugenics and marriage. His book <span class="italic">Before I Wed</span> was said to contain &#145;sound and practical advice of a much needed character&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, 937). In 1910 he gave evidence on behalf of the British Medical Association before the royal commission on divorce and matrimonial causes. However, although recognized by his peers as a highly efficient asylum manager who had transformed the psychiatric care at Morningside, by the end of his tenure it was also recognized that a less regimented approach was now more appropriate for the needs of the patients. Likewise his writings, which provided a bold and populist synthesis of the leading currents of Victorian thought, are today largely unread and are viewed by historians as representing little more than the conventional codes of morality expressed in the language of &#145;science&#146;.<br>
<br>Clouston was elected president of the section of psychology of the British Medical Association in 1886 and 1898, president of the Medico-Psychological Association of Great Britain in 1888, Morison lecturer of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1890, and president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh between 1902 and 1904. He was awarded an LLD degree from the University of Aberdeen in 1907, made a freeman of the burgh of Kirkwall, Orkney, in 1908, and elected a corresponding member of the Societ&eacute; de Psychiatrie de Paris in 1911. In the same year he was awarded an LLD degree from the University of Edinburgh and also received a knighthood.<br>
<br>A thin, wiry, bearded man, Clouston was described by contemporaries as an energetic, driven clinician who expected high standards from both himself and others. His pastimes were shooting, fishing, and golf. He died suddenly from a stroke on 19 April 1915 at his home at 26 Heriot Row in Edinburgh. A funeral service was held on 22 April at St Cuthbert's Church, Edinburgh, after which his body was interred at Dean cemetery.<br>
