<span class="headword">Winton, Sir  Francis Walter  de</span>  (1835&#150;1901), <span class="occ">army officer and courtier</span>, was born at Pittsford, Northamptonshire, on 21 June 1835. De Winton's grandfather, Walter Wilkins (1741&#150;1828), gained a fortune in India under the East India Company, returned in 1772, and purchased the Maesllwch estate in Radnorshire; he was MP for Radnorshire from 1796 to 1828&#151;an independent who favoured some liberal causes. His son, also Walter Wilkins (1809&#150;1840), enjoyed a &#145;princely income&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 2nd ser., 14, 1840, 434) and was &#145;reform&#146; MP for Radnorshire in 1835&#150;40. Claiming descent from Robert de Wintonia (who went into Glamorgan with Robert Fitz Haimon in the eleventh century) he, together with his brothers and cousins, by royal licence dated 6 July 1839, assumed instead of Wilkins the name de Winton, which they claimed was their &#145;original surname&#146;  (ibid., 2nd ser., 12, 1839, 194). Walter Wilkins married in 1831 Julia Cecilia, second daughter of Richard John Collinson, rector of Gateshead: Francis Walter was their second son.<br>
<br>Educated at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, de Winton entered the Royal Artillery as second-lieutenant on 11 April 1854. He served in the Crimean War, at the siege and fall of Sevastopol, and received the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, fifth class. Captain in 1861, he acted as aide-de-camp to Sir William Fenwick Williams, commanding the forces in British North America, and was again on his staff when he was lieutenant-governor of Nova Scotia (1864&#150;7) and governor of Gibraltar (1870&#150;75). De Winton married in 1864 Evelyn, daughter of Christopher Rawson of Lennoxville, Canada, and had two sons (one died in 1892) and two daughters; his wife survived him.<br>
<br>From 1877 to 1878 de Winton was military attach&eacute; at Constantinople, and from 1878 to 1883 he was secretary to the marquess of Lorne (afterwards ninth duke of Argyll) when governor-general of Canada. Promoted lieutenant-colonel in 1880, he became brevet colonel in 1884, and was made CMG in 1882 and KCMG in February 1884.<br>
<br>De Winton was an associate of William Mackinnon, the shipowner, and one of what H. M. Stanley called &#145;the Mackinnon Clan&#146; which tried to create a British economic presence in the Congo. In 1885 he was appointed administrator-general of the Congo under the rapacious Leopold II's International Association enterprise, just before it became the Congo Free State. He held this office only until 1886, when he was created a commander of the order of Leopold. In 1887 he acted as secretary of the Emin Pasha relief committee, and assisted Stanley in his preparations for the relief expedition.<br>
<br>De Winton, who became a substantive colonel in 1887, commanded the small punitive expedition (largely 1st West India regiment, with a small naval contingent) against the rebellious Yoni in the hinterland of Sierra Leone. Robari, the Yoni stronghold, was shelled, set on fire by rockets, and quickly captured on 21 November 1887; other towns were burned and the rebellion suppressed: no British were killed. De Winton was made a CB in March 1888, and on his return home he was appointed assistant quartermaster-general at headquarters. The end of 1889, however, found him once more in Africa. Repeated requests had been made by the king of Swaziland that his country be taken under British protection to save it from the Boers, but the government had declined to intervene. The Boers gained virtual possession of the pastoral resources of Swaziland. In 1889 de Winton was sent as a commissioner to Swaziland to hold an inquiry in conjunction with a commissioner of the Transvaal republic. He reached Pretoria in November 1889, and after several interviews with President Kruger left for Swaziland, accompanied by generals Joubert and Smit. The joint commissioners held a meeting of the Swazi chiefs and headmen, and, among other things, promised them that the independence of the Swazi should be maintained by both governments; but, according to the report which de Winton subsequently made, the Swazi had already parted not only with all their actual territory but with rights which should only belong to the government of a country to adventurers whose sole object was to make money by them. He therefore considered a British protectorate inadvisable and impracticable. Not until the close of the South African War was the Swazi position improved.<br>
<br>In May 1890 de Winton, who retired from the army on 21 June of that year with the honorary rank of major-general, was appointed governor of the Imperial British East Africa Company's possessions; but he resigned in June 1891. In January 1892 he was appointed controller and treasurer of the household of the duke of Clarence, after whose opportune death in January 1892 he continued to act in the same capacity in the household of the duke of York, later George V. He was promoted GCMG in 1893. He was honorary secretary of the Royal Geographical Society in 1888&#150;9. He was made honorary LLD of Cambridge in 1892, and was also an honorary LLD of Durham. De Winton died at Llansteffan, Llys-wen, Brecknockshire, on 16 December 1901, and was buried at Glasbury, Brecknockshire.<br>
