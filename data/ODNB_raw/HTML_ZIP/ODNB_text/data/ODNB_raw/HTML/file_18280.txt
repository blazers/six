<span class="headword">Mason,  John</span>  (1586&#150;1635), <span class="occ">founder of New Hampshire</span>, was born in King's Lynn, Norfolk, the son of John Mason and Isabel Mason (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Steed), and baptized there on 11 December 1586. His father was apparently the John Mason who in 1575 had bought his freedom of the borough. The records of Magdalen College, Oxford, suggest that some time before the younger John's matriculation there on 25 June 1602 the family had moved to Southampton. In 1606 he married Anne Greene (<i>d</i>. 1655), daughter of a London goldsmith. In 1610 he commanded a small fleet sent by James VI and I to help put down resistance to Scottish rule in the Hebrides. He fitted out the expedition at his own expense on the promise of reimbursement from the Scottish treasury, which never happened because of the death of the treasurer. His failure to gain immediate reimbursement may have been a factor in his appointment in 1615 as governor of Newfoundland, where a company of adventurers of London and Bristol had established a colony in 1610 in order to exploit the north Atlantic fishery. The title captain by which he is invariably known dates at least from this period if not earlier.<br>
<br>During his six-year governorship Mason oversaw the expansion of settlement, explored thoroughly, wrote an important promotional tract, and drew the first accurate map of the island. <span class="italic">A Briefe Discourse of the New-Found-Land</span>, his tract published in Edinburgh in 1620, helped persuade Sir William Alexander to sponsor a colony in Nova Scotia. After his return to England in 1621 Mason became closely associated with Sir Ferdinando Gorges, governor of Plymouth Fort and treasurer of the council for New England, and on 9 March 1622 became the second beneficiary of a grant of land from the council. This was a sizeable strip of land between the Naumkeag and Merrimac rivers, including Cape Anne, which Mason named Mariana. The entire grant is within the present bounds of Massachusetts; neither Mason nor his heirs ever successfully defended it against the conflicting claims of the Massachusetts Bay Company.<br>
<br>Later in 1622, however, Mason and Gorges became joint proprietors of the council's third grant in New England, a much larger piece between the Merrimac and the Kennebec called the province of Maine. The Spanish and French wars, 1624&#150;30, during which he served as commissary-general in the expedition against Cadiz and then as treasurer and paymaster of the English armies, kept both Mason and Gorges from moving ahead with their New England project at once. At the end of the war with France in 1629 the partners turned their attention once again to the province of Maine, and agreed to divide it between them. Mason took the part between the Merrimac and Piscataqua (or Pascataqua) rivers. Since he was living in Portsmouth, Hampshire, the place from which he had conducted his military and naval affairs during the wars and with which he and his family may have been associated before that, he named his province New Hampshire. The Council for New England confirmed the arrangement the same year by granting separate new patents for Maine and New Hampshire to Gorges and Mason respectively. Gorges and Mason, together with other associates, received two more joint grants, the Laconia patent in 1629, intended to forward the interior fur trade, and the Pascataqua patent of 1631. The first of these latter grants reflected a vague understanding of American geography. Both overlapped the adjoining provinces of Mason and Gorges and were of extremely short duration; both helped to stimulate settlement of the Piscataqua region under Mason's sponsorship.<br>
<br>Besides investing in his own province and sending over agents, settlers, equipment, and livestock, Mason became increasingly involved in colonial affairs in general. In April 1632 he warned the secretary of state, Sir John Coke, about trading encroachments by Dutch &#145;interlopers&#146; on the coast between Cape Cod and Delaware Bay, and in June of the same year joined the Council for New England. The council thereafter met frequently at his London house in Fenchurch Street, which he maintained in addition to his house in Portsmouth. By the time of its dissolution in April 1635, three days after it issued a new grant to Mason for New Hampshire along with a 10,000 acre tract to the east to be called Masonia, he was the council's vice-president. At the same time as he was active in the council, he led the way in developing the fishery in the Hebrides and became treasurer of a company chartered for the purpose by the king.<br>
<br>In 1634 Mason was appointed captain of Southsea Castle, commanding Portsmouth harbour, and inspector of forts and castles on the south coast. In 1635 he was named a judge of the court of oyer and terminer for Hampshire, and appointed vice-admiral of New England, a position in what was intended as an elaborate viceregal government for all of New England to be headed by Gorges. Mason's death and a shipwreck prevented either man from sailing to put the plan into effect.<br>
<br>Mason died in London between 26 November and 22 December 1635 after providing in his will, dated 26 November, that the sons of his only daughter, Anne Tufton, should become the heirs to his New England lands provided they adopt the surname Mason. Only one of the grandsons, Robert Tufton Mason, lived to come of age. The subsequent history of New Hampshire until 1746 is in large measure the story of his ultimately unsuccessful efforts, and those of his representatives and heirs, to gain permanent and secure possession of the lands granted to his grandfather against the contending claims of politically powerful settlers. Mason's will was admitted to probate on 22 December. He is probably buried somewhere in Westminster Abbey in accordance with his wishes, but neither his grave nor a record of his burial has been located.<br>
