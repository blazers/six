<span class="headword">Coxe,  Daniel</span>  (1640&#150;1730), <span class="occ">physician, natural philosopher, and colonial adventurer</span>, was the son of Daniel Coxe (<i>d</i>. 1686), gentleman, of Stoke Newington, Middlesex. He matriculated at Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1659, becoming a scholar in 1661. Coxe first came to the fore in the mid-1660s as an associate of Robert Boyle: an important series of letters from Coxe to Boyle, dating from between 1665 and 1667, survives among the Boyle letters at the Royal Society, in which Helmontian and other themes are discussed; twenty-five years later, in 1692, Coxe was one of three doctors appointed to examine Boyle's chemical papers after his death.<br>
<br>On 22 March 1665 Coxe was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, in which he played an active role for the rest of the 1660s and a slightly less active one in the 1670s. His interest was particularly in chemical investigations; he devoted special attention to the chemical analysis of vegetable substances, his findings on which were published in three articles in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> in 1674. These studies were evidently intended to form part of a grandiose history of vegetables, of which he presented a prospectus to the society in 1668; this was a sequel to the &#145;Enquiries concerning vegetables&#146; that he had presented in 1665. The history as a whole never materialized. His articles, however, were not without influence, being attacked by the Scottish apothecary, Matthew MacKaile, in a book published in 1683, and continuing to be cited after that date.<br>
<br>In the 1660s and 1670s Coxe established a successful medical practice in London. He was awarded the degree of MD <i>per literas regias</i> at Cambridge in 1669, and became an honorary fellow of the College of Physicians, London, in 1680. He also acted as physician-in-ordinary to Charles II. In 1669 he participated in the pamphlet war between physicians and apothecaries by publishing <span class="italic">A discourse, wherein the interest of the patient in reference to physick and physicians is soberly debated</span>; this combined an attack on the apothecaries with a vindication of the role of an experimentally active physician, which he exemplified. In 1671 Coxe married Rebecca, daughter of John Coldman, a London alderman. Their son Daniel Coxe (<i>bap</i>. 1673) emigrated to America at the age of twenty-eight and thereafter took a prominent role in the affairs of West New Jersey, the province in which his father had played so important a role a generation earlier.<br>
<br>Coxe's chief claim to retrospective fame was his activity as a colonial adventurer: indeed, Daniel Defoe in his <span class="italic">Essay on Projects</span> (1697) singled out Coxe, along with William Penn and Anthony Ashley Cooper, first earl of Shaftesbury, in this connection. In the mid-1680s Coxe began to acquire property in West New Jersey, and in 1687 he purchased the proprietary rights of the province from the heirs of Edward Byllynge. He later bought more land, his holding in the area ultimately totalling 1 million acres; he also invested large sums in developing local fisheries and industries; he was among those who promoted a company for naval stores to be produced in New England; and he also encouraged the exploration and exploitation of the hinterland towards the Great Lakes. In 1692, however, he sold the bulk of his holdings and the right of proprietorship to a syndicate of forty-eight London merchants, the West New Jersey Society, for &pound;9800.<br>
<br>By this time Coxe had shifted his interests further south to the province of &#145;Carolana&#146;&#151;covering the present North and South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Louisiana&#151;which had been granted by Charles I to Sir Robert Heath, attorney-general, in 1629. Coxe acquired the title in the 1690s, and at the end of that decade he attempted to orchestrate settlement in the area in opposition to the parallel activities of the French. In 1698 he equipped two ships to explore the Mississippi; he also tried to encourage a Huguenot settlement on the Gulf of Mexico, and to float a joint-stock company to exploit Florida. These various schemes proved problematic, however, and little came of Coxe's ambitions, though they were briefly the subject of government interest in 1719, when the question arose of the English title to this part of America.<br>
<br>Coxe has been described as a pioneer of the idea that &#145;the destiny of the English in America embraced more than the settlement and exploitation of the Atlantic seaboard&#146;  (Crane, 50). His role in exploiting this area was recounted&#151;together with a topographical account of somewhat questionable reliability&#151;in <span class="italic">A Description of the English Province of Carolana</span>, published in 1722 by his son. Coxe died on 19 January 1730 in possession of the title to Carolana, which his descendants surrendered to the British government in 1769, in return for land in the colony of New York.<br>
