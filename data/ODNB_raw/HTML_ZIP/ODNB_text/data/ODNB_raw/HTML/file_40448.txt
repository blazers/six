<span class="headword">Andrews,  Henry Stewart Fleetwood <span class="st"> [Harry]</span></span>  (1910&#150;1989), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 10 November 1910 at St Mary's, Pembury Road, Tonbridge, Kent, the son of Scottish doctor Henry Arthur Andrews and his wife, Amy Diana Frances Horner. He was educated at Tonbridge School and at Wrekin College, Shropshire. His father was a keen amateur actor, but Andrews considered careers as a professional cricketer and a policeman before he joined Liverpool Playhouse; he made his d&eacute;but there as John in <span class="italic">The Long Christmas Dinner</span> (1933), and in London, at the St James's Theatre, as John in <span class="italic">Worse Things Happen at Sea</span> (1935). In that year he took over the role of Tybalt in the Olivier&#150;Gielgud production of <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, and in New York in 1936 he played Horatio to Gielgud's Hamlet. In 1937&#150;8 he appeared in Gielgud's Shakespeare&#150;Sheridan&#150;Chekhov season, and in 1939 he played Laertes opposite Gielgud's Hamlet, at the Lyceum. He always performed as Harry Andrews.<br>
<br>Throughout the Second World War, Andrews served with the Royal Artillery's 15th Scottish division, ending as acting major. He was soon back on stage, with Olivier's Old Vic company at the New Theatre, playing roles in <span class="italic">Henry IV</span>, parts 1 and 2, <span class="italic">Oedipus</span>, and <span class="italic">The Critic</span> before transferring with the company to New York in summer 1946. From September of that year until 1949 he was again with the company at the New Theatre, appearing in a string of successes that included Cornwall in <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, Bolingbroke in <span class="italic">Richard II</span>, Hortensio in <span class="italic">The Taming of the Shrew</span>, Orsino in <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span>, and Lucifer in <span class="italic">Dr Faustus</span>. Meanwhile Anthony Quayle had become director of the Memorial Theatre, Stratford upon Avon, in 1948, and for its transformation Andrews was one of the big names that he attracted from the Old Vic. In 1949 Andrews played Macduff in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, Don Pedro in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span>, Theseus in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>, Pisanio in <span class="italic">Cymbeline</span>, and Wolsey in <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span>, before touring Australia with the company; in 1950&#150;51, again with Gielgud, he was Vincentio in <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span>, Brutus in <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span>, Edgar in <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, and Benedick in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span>. Late that year he appeared in New York with Olivier's two Festival of Britain productions, <span class="italic">Caesar and Cleopatra</span> and <span class="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span>.<br>
<br>Andrews was tall, with a powerful frame, a &#145;distinguished Shakespearean actor with a commanding presence and a resonant speaking voice&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). However, the major Shakespearian roles had eluded him; there was a suggestion that he lacked an understanding of their deeper subtleties. His career now turned almost exclusively to films. Having hitherto avoided their lure (and the likelihood of an operation on his protruding ears) he made his film d&eacute;but as the Scots sergeant major in <span class="italic">The Red Beret</span> (1953). Despite being a gentle giant it was authoritarian roles, especially military ones, for which he was best known. He played most ranks from sergeants (<span class="italic">A Hill in Korea</span>, 1956), through captains (<span class="italic">Reach for Glory</span>, 1962), to generals (<span class="italic">The Night of the Generals</span>, 1967). He played an air vice-marshal in <span class="italic">633 Squadron</span> (1964) and a variety of police inspectors and other officers. He added his presence to a number of epics&#151;as Hector in <span class="italic">Helen of Troy</span> and Darius in <span class="italic">Alexander the Great</span> (both 1956), in <span class="italic">55 Days at Peking</span> (1963), and <span class="italic">The Agony and the Ecstasy</span> (1965). He was noteworthy in <span class="italic">Moby Dick</span> (1956), as Lord Lucan in <span class="italic">The Charge of the Light Brigade</span> (1968), as Mr Earnshaw in <span class="italic">Wuthering Heights</span> (1970), as the loopy thirteenth earl of Gurney in <span class="italic">The Ruling Class</span> (1972). He lent particular gravitas to roles as a senior civil servant in <span class="italic">Battle of Britain</span> (1969), as Grand Duke Nicholas in <span class="italic">Nicholas and Alexandra</span> (1971), and as an elder in <span class="italic">Superman</span> (1978). Perhaps his best-remembered role was as the &#145;epicene boy-chaser&#146;, Ed, in the filmed version of Joe Orton's <span class="italic">Entertaining Mr Sloane</span> (1970). Despite the apparent similarity of many of his film parts his strength was in underplaying, and he displayed many subtle shades in his performances.<br>
<br>The stage was not totally abandoned. Back in Stratford for the 1956 season he played Claudius in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, and Othello. He was Henry VIII at the Old Vic in 1958, Menenius to Olivier's Coriolanus in 1959, and in 1960 played General Allenby opposite Alec Guinness in <span class="italic">Ross</span> at the Haymarket. In 1971 Andrews finally played Lear, in Edward Bond's reworked version at the Royal Court, but though &#145;a performance of towering power and passion &hellip; it was difficult for him to convey Lear's childishness in senile insanity&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). His last stage role was Ivan Kilner in <span class="italic">A Family</span> (1978), at the Haymarket. In his later years he appeared in many television movies and several series&#151;<span class="italic">Clayhanger</span> (1976), <span class="italic">A. J. Wentworth, B.A.</span> (1982), <span class="italic">Dynasty</span> (1985)&#151;and in plays, including <span class="italic">All Passion Spent</span> (1986), in which he was splendid as the elderly admirer of the widowed Wendy Hiller.<br>
<br>As a younger man Andrews enjoyed cricket, tennis, sailing, and riding. Later he enjoyed gardening and the country life at the home&#151;Church Farm Oasts, Salehurst, Sussex&#151;that he shared with his companion, actor Basil Hoskins. In 1966 he was appointed CBE. He died at his home, of bronchitis and emphysema, on 7 March 1989.<br>
