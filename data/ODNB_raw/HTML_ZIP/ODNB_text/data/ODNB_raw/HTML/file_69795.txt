<span class="headword">Gili,  John Louis</span>  (1907&#150;1998), <span class="occ">bookseller, publisher, and Catalan scholar</span>, was born Joan Llu&iacute;s Gili i Serra on 10 February 1907 in Barcelona, the son of Llu&iacute;s Gili Roig (1882&#150;1957), bookseller and publisher, and his wife, Victoria Serra Sunyol. He was thus a scion of a publishing house founded by Gustavo Gili Roig in 1902, later Gustavo Gili SA, which became famous for its elegant books on art and architecture, including Picasso's <span class="italic">Tauromaquia</span> (1959). Apprenticed in the book trade by his family, Gili was inducted into the creative discipline of translation by assisting a canon of Barcelona Cathedral to prepare Catalan versions of Homer and St Augustine. He acquired a love of English literature through his friendship with Josep Carner, and later translated short stories by D. H. Lawrence and Katherine Mansfield. This led to correspondence with the countryside author C. Henry Warren, who invited him to England in 1933. Gili returned to settle permanently in England in October 1934, when he went into partnership with Warren to open a bookshop at 5 Cecil Court, off Charing Cross Road, London (1935). When the stock of English books failed to sell the partnership was dissolved and Gili, now sole owner, filled the space with Spanish school and university texts imported from Barcelona. He then began to publish on his own account, beginning with a book on Luis de Le&oacute;n as translator of the classics, printed by Sopena in Barcelona but with changed title-page. During the visit to England of Miguel de Unamuno in 1936 Gili was invited to meet him at the embassy of the Spanish Second Republic, where the novelist P&eacute;rez de Ayala was envoy, and there obtained the philosopher's permission to publish any of his works in Britain.<br>
<br>After the founding of the Dolphin Book Company (named for the sixteenth-century Aldine editions and the Mediterranean cetacean that represented social love in medieval art) Gili's first limited printing was <span class="italic">The Crafty Farmer</span> (1938), a Spanish fairy tale retold by Henry Thomas, with illustrations by the Spanish artist Gregorio Prieto; Gili's collaboration with Prieto continued that same year in <span class="italic">Estudiantes</span>, an album of twenty-five line engravings of Oxford and Cambridge students. In those early editions Gili's mastery of page design and typography already came to the fore: he always observed the Renaissance golden &#145;rule of three&#146;, whereby the width of the upper margin was doubled in the side margins and trebled in the lower where the reader's fingers supported the volume. He also disliked the glare of white paper, preferring thick cream weaves for the special printings.<br>
<br>The first public edition of <span class="roman">Dolphin Bookshop Editions</span> was a collection of Unamuno's writings selected by Gili and with an introduction by J. B. Trend (1938). This was surpassed in the following year by one of Dolphin's most successful productions, Federico Garc&iacute;a Lorca's <span class="italic">Poems</span>, jointly translated by Stephen Spender and Gili, with an introduction by Lorca's close friend Rafael Mart&iacute;nez Nadal, which was simultaneously published in New York and Toronto by Oxford University Press; a second impression appeared from Dolphin in 1942, and a new revised selection from the Hogarth Press in 1943. Gili later provided plain prose translations of Lorca's verse for the bilingual <span class="roman">Penguin Poets</span> edition in 1960, which was much reprinted. He was also privileged to design an elegant edition of Lorca's unpublished play <span class="italic">El p&uacute;blico</span> (1976), also with a prologue by Nadal.<br>
<br>During the Spanish Civil War the Dolphin Bookshop became such a centre for supporters of the republic that in 1938 Gili received threats from an official at the rival Francoist embassy that his family in Barcelona would in due course suffer if he did not rein in these activities. On 24 June of the same year at Kensington register office he married Elizabeth Helen McPherson (1913&#150;2011), the eldest of the three daughters of John Livingstone McPherson, a Scottish-Canadian missionary in China. Elizabeth had taken a first in philosophy at University College, London, and had won in 1937 a Henry fellowship at Yale, where fortuitously she met a member of the family who had inherited the bulk of the library of manuscripts and printed books of the French Hispanist Raymond Foulch&eacute;-Delbosc. In late 1938 the newly married book dealers secured the contract to handle that important library, and in January 1939 Gili arranged for it to be loaded onto a railway wagon and transported to London. This bibliographical coup was to make Gili one of the most important Hispanic antiquarian booksellers of his generation.<br>
<br>When the Second World War began in September 1939, Cecil Court seemed a dangerous place to keep important books and manuscripts. Elizabeth was just embarking on a doctorate in sociology under Karl Mannheim at the London School of Economics, which was evacuated to Peterhouse in Cambridge. The Gilis, and the rarer Dolphin stock, followed, to a small medieval house in Little St Mary's Lane, but before the end of the &#145;phoney war&#146; they returned to London to new premises in Kensington. When the blitz began in September 1940 the Dolphin stock was moved again, to Oxford, at first to an artist's studio in Park Town, thence to more permanent quarters in Fyfield Road, where they organized a postal service for Hispanists in Britain, Ireland, and North America.<br>
<br>In Oxford the Gilis again found themselves principal hosts for Spanish republican exiles. As an alien from a technically neutral country (he was naturalized in 1948, Anglicizing his forenames to John Louis), Gili began at this inauspicious moment to promote Catalan studies by publishing the first edition of his <span class="italic">Catalan Grammar</span> in 1943, the year in which his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94329/', "Jonathan Francesc Gili")</script> was born; he was later to become a well-known documentary film-maker. Two other children followed: Katherine, a sculptor, and Martin, who carried on the Dolphin Book Company.<br>
<br>Of the seventy-three titles published under the Dolphin imprint between 1936 and 1996 no fewer than twenty-five were Catalan works, forty were Spanish or Spanish American, five were on art, and three were English works. The Catalan books included three editions of medieval texts prepared by Gili himself with enormous scholarly care. All the covers of the seven homage volumes to British and Irish Hispanists were designed with individual touches appropriate to the recipient.<br>
<br>In photographs taken in his late twenties Gili appears as a figure of urbane handsomeness and quiet authority, but later in life his rugged and lithe physique and almost oriental physiognomy suggested rather an upbringing in the Catalonian countryside for which he had so much affection. This impression was strengthened when he was hard at work in his quarter of an acre on Cumnor Hill, cultivating Mediterranean vegetables under glass among the medlars, quinces, and numerous apple trees in an orchard surrounded by strawberry trees and punctuated by large abstract sculptures created by his daughter, Katherine. That idyllic setting no doubt influenced Elizabeth to embark on her publication of cookery books, including <span class="italic">Apple Recipes from A to Z</span> (1975).<br>
<br>In recognition of his role in providing a meeting place and publishing centre for republican exiles and his decisive measures to spread the culture of Catalonia in the Anglo-Saxon world, including as co-founder of the Anglo-Catalan Society, Gili was honoured with the cross of St George by the Generalitat de Catalunya, and was made an honorary MA by the University of Oxford and a commander of the order of Isabel the Catholic by Juan Carlos I of Spain. Up to his ninetieth year he regularly played tennis with his usual Oxford partner. He died of cancer after a short illness in Sobell House hospice, Oxford, on 6 May 1998, only seven weeks before the diamond wedding anniversary celebrations he and Elizabeth had planned. She and their three children survived him.<br>
