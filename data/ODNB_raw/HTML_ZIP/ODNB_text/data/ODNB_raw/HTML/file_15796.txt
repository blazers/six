<span class="headword">Knijff,  Leendert</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Leonard Knyff]</span>  (1650&#150;1722), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at Haarlem, Netherlands, on 10 August 1650, where he was baptized four days later. His mother was Lydia Leenderts of Delft, the widow of Jacob Bas of Haarlem; his father was Wouter Knijff (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1607, <i>d</i>. after 1693), painter, born at Wesel, widower of Gerritje Jans van Houten. Leendert had two elder half-brothers, Jacobus and Johannes. Wouter Knijff specialized exclusively in river scenes, in a manner which owed much to Salomon van Ruysdael and Jan van Goyen. It has been suggested that Leendert studied with his father, but since the son's early speciality was the game piece, in the manner of Jan and Elias Vonck, it is perhaps more likely that he learned his art from a professional still-life painter. By 1681 Leendert was in London, living in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields. He returned to Holland in 1693 and again in 1695, when a pass was issued for &#145;Mr Leonard Knife, a protestant, to go to Harwich or Gravesend for Holland&#146;  (Honour, 337). Knijff was one of a number of resident aliens on whose behalf a warrant was sent to the attorney-general, on 8 June 1694, to prepare a bill for the great seal to make them &#145;free denizens of England&#146;  (ibid.). While in London, Knijff extended his repertoire, painting portraits such as the massive (265 &times; 276 cm) <span class="italic">Viscount Irwin</span> (1700; Temple Newsam House, Leeds); animal portraits including <span class="italic">The Dog &#145;Caper&#146;</span> (Christies, 20 November 1981); animal fancy pieces, for example <span class="italic">Greyhound Catching a Hare</span> (1697; Temple Newsam House) and <span class="italic">Pugs, Greyhound and Spaniel with Dead Game</span> (1698, priv. coll.); and topographical landscapes, consisting largely of bird's-eye views of English country estates. Only a few painted landscapes by Knijff have survived; these include <span class="italic">Windsor Castle</span> and <span class="italic">Hampton Court from the East</span>, both in the Royal Collection; his topographical work is known largely through drawings and prints. Many of his drawings were engraved by Jan Kip for volume 1 of <span class="italic">Britannia illustrata</span>, or <span class="italic">Nouveau th&eacute;&acirc;tre de la Grande Bretagne</span>, published by David Mortier in 1708. A number of drawings connected with this publication are preserved in the British Museum, including works such as <span class="italic">Hampton Court from the South</span> not used by Kip. Knijff's landscape drawings reveal a diligent eye for detail but a mediocre grasp of perspective, and their main importance lies in their unique documentary value. As an artist his most successful works were always his still lifes of dead game such as <span class="italic">Dead Birds</span> in the Bredius Museum, The Hague, and the splendid <span class="italic">Dogs, Dead Peacock and Game</span> (Christies, 24 February 1939). Knijff married rather late in life, on 26 February 1708, Elizabeth Cox; the couple had two children, Leonard and Lyddia. In financial terms he seems to have done quite well for himself; when he came to draw up his will on 16 April 1722 he could boast of &#145;being now possessed of One Thousand and seven hundred pounds more or less in the stock of the South Sea Company&#146;  (will, PROB 11/588, fols. 272<i>v</i>&#150;273<i>r</i>). In his directions for the dispersal of his fortune he showed a precise interest in money which suggests the avid investor. His executors were John Boulter and John Coushmaker; Knijff gave each of them &#145;Twenty Pounds for Mourning, and two pictures a piece such as they shall choose out of those of mine own paintings&#146;  (ibid.). The witnesses included Clara Roestraten, widow of the still-life painter Pieter van Roestraten. The will was not proved until 22 December 1722, an unusually long delay, since Knijff was buried in the New Chapel, Broadway, in the parish of St Margaret's Westminster, on 24 April 1722. In May 1723 his pictures were auctioned off, in accordance with his will, to provide funds for the education of his children. When his widow, Elizabeth, came to draw up her will on 31 July 1742 she made no mention of her son, which perhaps suggests that he was no longer alive, and she said that her daughter was dead. The bulk of her estate was left to Lyddia's son, James Ratclife. Elizabeth was buried on 10 July 1747, &#145;in the Chappell in the Broad Way Westminster as near my late husband deceased as conveniently may&#146;.<br>
