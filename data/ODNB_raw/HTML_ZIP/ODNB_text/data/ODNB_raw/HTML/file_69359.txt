<span class="headword">Browne, Sir  Humphrey</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1562), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was a younger son of Thomas Browne of Longhouse in Abbess Roding, Essex, and Mary, daughter of Thomas Charlton, perhaps Sir Thomas Charlton (<i>d</i>. 1465), speaker of the House of Commons. His elder brother, Wistan, was the father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3666/', "Sir Anthony Browne")</script>, who was for four years a fellow justice of the common pleas. He was admitted to the Middle Temple in the 1490s and gave his first reading in 1516. By this time he was already a justice of the peace for Northamptonshire and Essex. In 1521 he became a serjeant-at-law, and in 1530 one of the king's serjeants. He was removed from the office of king's serjeant in 1532, and imprisoned in the Tower, both for hunting in Waltham Forest and for advising felons on how to avoid forfeiture of their goods. The lawfulness of his imprisonment was discussed in the Star Chamber, a major constitutional debate reported briefly by Spelman. Browne was obliged to grant his land in Waltham to the crown, and having done this he sought his reinstatement in 1533, with the backing of the earl of Wiltshire and Lord Rochford; but he was not in the event restored until 1535.<br>
<br>By 1537 Browne was being actively considered for the next vacant judgeship, though he claimed not to be interested because it would cause him financial loss. In 1540, however, he was again removed from office and sent to the Tower, this time for advising on a method of feudal tax avoidance. The conveyancing device in question so worried the government that it was necessary to pass the <span class="roman">Statute of Wills</span> in 1540 to remove the threat. Such a double disgrace was unprecedented, and yet, once more, it proved merely temporary. In 1542 Browne was appointed one of the justices of the common pleas and served for twenty years. As a judge he transferred to the western circuit, having previously (as a serjeant) ridden on the northern, midland, and home in succession. By 1559, according to Plowden, he was &#145;so old that his senses were decayed and his voice could not be heard by the audience&#146;  (<span class="italic">Les commentaries</span>, fol. 190).<br>
<br>According to the 1559 pardon, Browne was also of Terling in Essex. His will mentions the rectory of Maldon and the manor of Manuden, both in Essex, and also manors in Gloucestershire and Middlesex. In 1516 he married Elizabeth, the widow of Nicholas Shelton (<i>d</i>. 1515), alderman of London, from whom he apparently acquired his house in St Martin Orgar; she was still living in 1541. In 1531 the house was the subject of a burglary recorded in the king's bench files. He later built a mansion house in Cow Lane, London, on land formerly belonging to Watton Priory, Yorkshire, with six messuages in St Sepulchre's parish on the east side of his &#145;great gate&#146;. His second wife (shown as the first in the visitation pedigrees) was Anne or Amy Mordaunt, daughter and coheir of Henry Vere of Addington. With his third wife, Agnes, a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14266/', "John Hussey, Baron Hussey")</script>, and granddaughter of Chief Justice Sir William Hussey, he had three daughters: Mary, Christian, and Katherine. Christian was mother of the first earl of Thanet. Katherine was to marry as her second husband William Roper, chief clerk of the king's bench, biographer of Thomas More, and ancestor of the lords Teynham; by her first she was ancestor to the marquesses Townshend. Browne left one son and heir, George, who can hardly be the George Browne admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1528.<br>
<br>Browne died on 5 December 1562, and was buried in the church of St Martin Orgar on 15 December. Agnes was his executor, and was sued in 1572 for diverting water to the house in Cow Lane through a conduit installed by her late husband. He bequeathed all his law books to Anthony Browne, his nephew and fellow judge, in return for assisting his widow as overseer of the will.<br>
