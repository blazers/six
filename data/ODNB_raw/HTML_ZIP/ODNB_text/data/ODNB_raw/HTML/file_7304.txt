<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Davison <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Duncan]</span>,  Maria Rebecca</span>  (1780<span class="mult">x</span>83&#150;1858), <span class="occ">actress</span>, is reputed to have been born in Liverpool, where her parents were provincial performers. From an early age she played children's parts (hobgoblins, fairies, cupids, and so on) in Dublin, Liverpool, and Newcastle, and her first recorded appearance in a speaking part was in Newcastle in 1794&#150;5 as the duke of York to the Richard III of George Frederick Cooke; she also played there Tom Thumb. Elizabeth Farren, by whom she was seen in <span class="italic">The Woodman</span>, is said to have recognized in her a talent similar to her own, and referred to her as &#145;a little wonder&#146;. In 1796 she appeared in Dublin as Rosetta in Isaac Bickerstaff's <span class="italic">Love in a Village</span> and Priscilla Tomboy for her father's benefit. Her first regular engagement was from Tate Wilkinson, as a member of whose company she appeared in York, playing on her first appearance Sophia in Thomas Holcroft's <span class="italic">The Road to Ruin</span> and Gillian in Charles Dibdin's <span class="italic">The Quaker</span>. With her reputation increasing, she acted in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Liverpool. At Margate in 1804 she was seen by a Mr Graham as Widow Cheerly in Andrew Cherry's <span class="italic">The Soldier's Daughter</span>, and he recommended her to Richard Wroughton for Drury Lane, where she appeared on 8 October 1804, billed as Miss Duncan from Edinburgh, playing for fifteen nights Lady Teazle to the Sir Peter of Charles Matthews and the Charles Surface of R. W. Elliston. She took many leading parts during her first season, including Rosalind, Lady Townly, Lydia Languish, and Letitia Hardy in Hannah Cowley's <span class="italic">The Belle's Stratagem</span>. On 31 January 1805 she created the role of Juliana in John Tobin's <span class="italic">The Honeymoon</span>, which ran for twenty-eight nights: her song at the end of act <span class="smallcap">V</span> was constantly encored, and the part finally made her name. She remained with the Drury Lane company for fourteen years, and migrated with it to the Lyceum and elsewhere. The presence of Dorothy Jordan was somewhat of an obstacle to her career as Maria Duncan played similar parts, but she enjoyed considerable popularity, even in roles associated particularly with Mrs Jordan, such as Peggy in Garrick's <span class="italic">The Country Girl</span>.<br>
<br>On 31 October 1812 Maria Duncan married James Davison (<i>d</i>. 1858), and on 5 November she played, as &#145;Mrs Davison, late Miss Duncan&#146;, Belinda in <span class="italic">All in the Wrong</span>. The marriage was not happy and it was said that her husband deserted her for the gaming tables. They had two sons, the elder being <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7301/', "James William Davison")</script>, music critic of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. She continued on the stage, and appeared in November 1816 in Birmingham, where her &#145;increasing embonpoint&#146; was remarked upon. On 8 September 1819 she reappeared in London as Lady Teazle to W. C. Macready's Joseph Surface at Covent Garden. The following year she returned to Drury Lane as Julia in <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>. At Covent Garden on 14 June 1821 she again played, for her benefit, Lady Teazle. She then moved to the Haymarket to take leading business, but was once more at Drury Lane until 13 June 1829, when she played Mrs Subtle in <span class="italic">Paul Pry</span>, probably her last performance there.<br>
<br>Maria Davison was rather tall, a full, handsome person, with extremely black hair, dark hazel eyes, strongly formed features, and a rich, sweet voice, which was heard at its best in Scottish ballads and in duet with John Braham. She was noted for her &#145;breeches parts&#146;, such as Macheath: Leigh Hunt observed that &#145;she wears the breeches much better than becomes her&#146;. As a successor to Elizabeth Farren, she was regarded by J. W. Cole as the first high-comedy actress of the London stage for many years. She was said to have made &#145;a nice little fortune&#146; on a final salary of &pound;15 a week. She lived for many years in retirement and died shortly after her husband, on 30 May 1858, at 5 Alfred Place, Brompton.<br>
