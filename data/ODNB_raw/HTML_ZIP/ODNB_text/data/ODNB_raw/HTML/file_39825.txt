<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Braine,  John Gerard</span>  (1922&#150;1986), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 13 April 1922 in Bradford, the elder child and only son of Fred Braine, a sewage-works inspector, and his wife, Katherine Josephine Henry. By religion his father was a Methodist, his mother a Roman Catholic; he was brought up in the latter faith. He was educated at St Bede's Roman Catholic Grammar School, Bradford, and attended the Leeds School of Librarianship&#151;his mother had worked as a librarian. In 1938&#150;40 he was in rapid succession a furniture shop assistant, bookshop assistant, laboratory assistant, and progress chaser. Between 1940 and 1951 he was an assistant librarian at Bingley Public Library, becoming chief assistant in 1949. This part of his career was interrupted in 1942&#150;3 by service in the Royal Navy, from which he was invalided out. In 1951 tuberculosis necessitated a long spell in hospital, from which he did not emerge until 1954. Over the next three years he worked as branch librarian successively at Northumberland and West Riding of Yorkshire county libraries. He had been writing various items, including a verse play, without much success for some time, and now, in 1957, published his first novel, <span class="italic">Room at the Top</span>. Although earlier rejected by four publishers, this book immediately took its place as one of the significant novels of the post-war period. Its author's lack of a conventionally prolonged education may well have contributed to its freshness and vigour, and its story, of the material ascent and emotional coarsening of Joe Lampton, a northern working-class lad, owed something to a tradition of provincial writing that had become weakened. Before long its sales reached 100,000 in hardback and the film rights had been sold before publication. Within four months Braine was able to give up his career as a librarian and devote himself to writing. The film appeared in 1958.<br>
<br>Braine's second novel, <span class="italic">The Vodi</span> (1959), an excursion into the supernatural influenced by his hospital experiences, has never done anything like so well either commercially or in esteem, but in his third, <span class="italic">Life at the Top</span> (1962, filmed 1965), he returned to Joe Lampton, now a capable but disaffected executive, and to commercial success. None of Braine's later novels, of which the last, <span class="italic">These Golden Days</span>, appeared in 1985, attracted the attention the Lampton books received. Joe enjoyed a kind of resurrection as the protagonist of two television series, <span class="italic">Man at the Top</span> (1970 and 1972), and several of Braine's other novels were effectively adapted for television.<br>
<br>It is difficult not to see in Braine's career after 1962 a decline in literary standards of performance as well as of popularity and standing with the public. Inexorably he came to be seen as a man if not of one book then of one character, the uncertainly attractive and far from inexhaustible Lampton. What at one stage had passed as a harsh northern critique of the affluent south seemed more and more to slide into tolerance at best. More than this, in the absence of the narrative thrust of the earlier novels, the general treatment and style was revealed as flatly pedestrian. Autobiography or wish-fulfilment took the place of invention, to the point of occasional embarrassment in late works such as <span class="italic">One and Last Love</span> (1981). Besides fiction, he published a critical study, <span class="italic">J. B. Priestley</span> (1978), and a handbook called <span class="italic">Writing a Novel</span> (1974), which, together with much sound practical advice to the tyro, includes a heartfelt warning, poignant in retrospect, of the dangers of success. He pursued a more ephemeral calling as a political polemicist in writing and in public appearances. At first a supporter of unilateral nuclear disarmament and other left-wing causes, he moved suddenly and spectacularly to the right, calling for the return of hanging and the ending of all foreign aid.<br>
<br>Though possessing strong views and vociferous dislikes, Braine showed no animosity towards anyone. He was indeed a man of great natural sweetness. Pale, chubby, bespectacled, a serious cigarette smoker and drinker with a perpetual look of being out of condition, he had an expression of settled gloom that easily lightened into a genial smile. He showed an endearing pleasure in his prosperity and no resentment when his star began to fade.<br>
<br>In 1955 Braine married Helen Patricia, daughter of William Selby Wood, engineering fitter. They had a son and three daughters. The family moved from Bingley to Woking in 1966. Braine died of a gastric haemorrhage on 28 October 1986, in a Hampstead hospital.<br>
