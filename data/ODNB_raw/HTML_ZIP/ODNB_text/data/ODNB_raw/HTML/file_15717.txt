<span class="headword">Knight,  Edward</span>  (1774&#150;1826), <span class="occ">actor</span>, commonly known as Little Knight and spoken of as a Yorkshireman, was born in Birmingham. While training as an artist and practising as a sign-painter, he was stirred to emulation by the performance of a provincial theatrical company. He appeared accordingly at Newcastle under Lyme, Staffordshire, as Hob in <span class="italic">Hob in the Well</span>, and was so complete a victim to stage fright that, despite the encouragement of a friendly audience, he ran off the stage and quitted the town. A year later at Raither in north Wales, with a salary of 5<i>s</i>. per week, he was fortunate enough to get through the same part in safety. While playing Frank Oatland in Thomas Morton's <span class="italic">A Cure for the Heartache</span> he was seen and engaged by Nunns, the manager of the Stafford theatre. He stayed in Stafford for some years, increasing in reputation by playing such parts as Arno, Sylvester Daggerwood, and Lingo. About 1801 he married Sarah Clews (<i>c</i>.1781&#150;1806), the daughter of a local wine merchant.<br>
<br>Tate Wilkinson, to whom Knight introduced himself, engaged the actor for the York circuit about 1803. He began as Frank Oatland, played in <span class="italic">The Jew and the Doctor</span>, and was Davy in <span class="italic">Bon Ton</span>, in all of which roles he was favourably received. After a time he was gratified by the present from Wilkinson of a chest containing all the appliances of an actor's wardrobe, with the compliment: &#145;I have been long looking for some one who knew how to value them; you are the very man.&#146; While at Leeds in 1806 Knight's wife died at the early age of twenty-four, only five years after their marriage. Left with a young family, he married in 1807 Susan Smith (1788&#150;1859), who had succeeded her sister, Sarah Bartley, as leading lady of the York company in 1805, and, though an actress of no great power, was a remarkable favourite.<br>
<br>Engaged by Wroughton, on the report of Bannister, for Drury Lane for three years, at a salary rising from &pound;7 to &pound;9, Knight arrived with his new wife and children in London to find the theatre burnt down. However, the company moved to the Lyceum, where Knight made his first London appearance on 14 October 1809, as Timothy Quaint in <span class="italic">The Soldier's Daughter</span> and Robin Roughhead in <span class="italic">Fortune's Frolic</span>. The favourable impression he made in these characters, and as Label in <span class="italic">The Prize</span>, was reinforced by his creation of Jerry Blossom in Pocock's <span class="italic">Hit or Miss</span> (February 1810), Scrub in Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span>, and Zekiel Homespun in Colman's <span class="italic">The Heir-at-Law</span>. He was also the original Diego in <span class="italic">The Kiss</span>, an adaptation of Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Spanish Curate</span>. With the company he went to the new theatre in Drury Lane, where he remained until his death. Simple in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span> (23 October 1812) is the first part in which he can be traced at this house. The Clown in <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> and Little John in <span class="italic">Robin Hood</span> were given during his first season. Knight played many parts, chiefly domestics, rustics, farm labourers, and similar roles, and was the representative of scores of characters in minor pieces by Thomas Dibdin, Isaac Pocock, James Kenney, and other writers. Francis in <span class="italic">Henry IV</span>, Sim in <span class="italic">Wild Oats</span>, Stephen Harrowby in <span class="italic">The Poor Gentleman</span>, David in <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>, Silky in <span class="italic">The Road to Ruin</span>, Peter in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, Isaac in <span class="italic">The Duenna</span>, Nym in <span class="italic">Henry V</span>, and Crabtree represent the range of his abilities.<br>
<br>During the season of 1825&#150;6 Knight retired from the stage in consequence of illness. He died on 21 February 1826 at his house in Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, and was buried on 27 February in a vault in St Pancras New Church. His son from his first marriage, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15730/', "John Prescott Knight")</script>, became a renowned portrait painter.<br>
<br>Knight was a shy, careful, benevolent, and retiring man, who shrank from social intimacies, and was wholly domestic in habits. His figure was small and pliable, his height being 5 feet 2 inches, his hair and eyes were dark, and his voice was shrill but not unmusical. He sang well and made up well, and in various lines of pert servants was unequalled. He was the author of a musical farce in two acts entitled <span class="italic">The Sailor and Soldier, or, Fashionable Amusement</span>, which was produced for his benefit in Hull in 1805. It is without merit.<br>
