<span class="headword">Marsden,  Dora</span>  (1882&#150;1960), <span class="occ">suffragette and philosopher</span>, was born on 5 March 1882 at The Hey, Marsden, Yorkshire, the fourth of five children of Fred Marsden (1851&#150;1913), woollen waste manufacturer, and his wife, Hannah (1852&#150;1936), daughter of a millwright, William Henry Gartside, and his wife, Elizabeth. Fred Marsden's business was in decline and he emigrated with his eldest son to Philadelphia, USA, in 1890 leaving Hannah to support her children alone by returning to her maiden trade of seamstress.<br>
<br>It was an inauspicious beginning for a woman the writer Rebecca West described as &#145;one of the most marvellous personalities the nation has ever produced&#146;  (<span class="italic">Time and Tide</span>, 16 July 1926). Yet it partly explains Marsden's subsequent feminism and lifelong commitment to the ideal of economic independence for women. Marsden's escape from dependence was through education. A pupil teacher at thirteen who qualified fully at eighteen, she won a queen's scholarship to become an undergraduate at Owens College, Manchester, in 1900.<br>
<br>In Manchester Marsden's political awareness developed as she came into contact with a range of feminists whose activity was beginning to coalesce around the struggle for women's suffrage. Influential in this group were Isabella Ford, Teresa Billington, Eva Gore-Booth, and Christabel Pankhurst, a fellow student at Owens College. Marsden graduated in 1903 with an upper second-class degree and embarked on a successful career in teaching which in 1908 culminated in her appointment as a headteacher of a teacher-training centre in nearby Altrincham.<br>
<br>In spite of this remarkable professional success Marsden remained active in the Pankhursts' Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) which had been formed in Manchester in 1903. Wishing to devote herself full-time to the suffrage movement she resigned her post in March 1909. She became a paid organizer for the WSPU and quickly established a reputation for ingenuity and bravery&#151;a reputation enhanced by her own diminutive size and in West's view &#145;exquisite beauty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Time and Tide</span>, 16 July 1926). She was arrested and imprisoned several times in 1909&#150;10 and though there is no firm evidence she was forcibly fed, she suffered physically in this period. Following one particularly daring escapade involving the then home secretary, Winston Churchill, she nearly fell to her death from the top of the Empire Hall in Southport where she had perched overnight to evade the alleged impregnable security. She appeared on the front page of the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> (31 March 1909) looking especially waif-like and bedraggled following a long battle with the police.<br>
<br>Yet in spite of her high profile both nationally and within the WSPU, the &#145;sweetest, gentlest and bravest of suffragettes&#146;  (Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence to Dora Marsden, 6 Oct 1909) became increasingly critical of the union. In common with a growing number of other activists, Marsden was disillusioned with Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst's leadership and resentful of their autocratic style. Dora Marsden also thought their political strategy, largely devoted to ever increasing acts of militancy, was flawed, and restricted feminist debate and analysis to the single pursuit of the vote. Having served the WSPU so well and bravely, she resigned in January 1910.<br>
<br>Marsden resurfaced in November 1911 to publish and edit <span class="italic">The Freewoman: a Weekly Feminist Review</span>. Though described by some as &#145;a disgusting publication &hellip; indecent, immoral and filthy&#146;  (Edgar Ansell to Dora Marsden, 14 July 1912), in its forthright discussions of sex, marriage, motherhood, and &#145;women's sphere&#146;, it stands out as the most outstanding feminist journal of the early twentieth century. It attracted articles from writers such as Rebecca West and H. G. Wells, and rates as Marsden's finest achievement [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96362', "Freewoman circle")</script>].<br>
<br>However, Marsden began to retreat from feminism into an individualist philosophy inspired by the German anarchist Max Stirner, and after a short break, the paper became the <span class="italic">New Freewoman: an Individualist Review</span> in June 1913, and following Stirner's <span class="italic">The Ego and his Own</span>, <span class="italic">The Egoist</span> in January 1914.<br>
<br>As Marsden concentrated on her philosophical analysis of egoism, the literary content of the paper grew. Indeed, some commentators claim that in attracting such talents as West, Wells, Ezra Pound, and others to the <span class="italic">New Freewoman</span> and <span class="italic">The Egoist</span>, Marsden became a seminal figure in the development of imagism and early modern British and American literature. Though this is contentious, Marsden was, however, certainly involved in the career of the Irish writer James Joyce. She published in serial form Joyce's <span class="italic">Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</span> in 1914 and was later willing to defend his <span class="italic">Ulysses</span>. One instalment of this then highly controversial work appeared in the January&#150;February 1919 issue.<br>
<br>By 1912 Marsden was living in Southport, eventually setting up a permanent home with her mother, Hannah, and Grace Jardine, an active suffragette and worker on <span class="italic">The Freewoman</span>. Marsden never married but enjoyed close friendships with a number of women including Jardine, Rona Robinson, and Mary Gawthorpe. Both Rona Robinson, who taught with Marsden in Altrincham, and Mary Gawthorpe, were active in the WSPU and became fervent supporters of <span class="italic">The Freewoman</span>. Marsden was close to her mother throughout her life and she lived with her from this time until her death in 1936.<br>
<br>From 1913 onwards Marsden did not take part in any formal political activity. During the war she occasionally attacked both jingoism and pacifism from an individualist, Stirnerian viewpoint in <span class="italic">The Egoist</span> and could not resist the odd scathing attack on the Pankhursts. In isolation, she concentrated on developing her philosophical work. <span class="italic">The Egoist</span> collapsed in December 1919 and Dora Marsden moved to an aptly named cottage, Seldom Seen, in the Lake District the following year. She continued to work on her <i>magnum opus</i> which had become more obscure, including proposed volumes on time, space, and religion. She became increasingly reclusive and delusionary and her mental and physical health began to suffer. However, with the generous help of her long-standing friend and benefactor Harriet Shaw Weaver (who had supported her financially since 1913), two volumes, <span class="italic">The Definition of the Godhead</span> (1928) and <span class="italic">Mysteries of Christianity</span> (1930), were published. As a result of their poor reception and her isolation Marsden suffered a nervous breakdown in 1934 and she attempted suicide in 1935. Diagnosed as suffering from psychotic depression, she became a patient at Crichton Royal Hospital, Dumfries, where she remained until her death on 13 December 1960. She was buried in Dumfries high cemetery on 16 December. Again with Weaver's help one further slim extract of her previous work, <span class="italic">The Philosophy of Time</span>, was published in 1955.<br>
<br>Marsden died a lonely and forgotten figure. It was an ignominious end for a &#145;brave and beautiful spirit&#146;  (Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence to Dora Marsden, 6 Oct 1909) whose prime importance lies in her remarkable contribution to suffragism and early twentieth-century feminism, but whose later life serves as a warning of the perils of political and personal individualism and isolation.<br>
