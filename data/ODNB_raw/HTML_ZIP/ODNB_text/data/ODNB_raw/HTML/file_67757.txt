<span class="headword">Cane,  Andrew</span>  (<em>c.</em>1589&#150;1656<span class="mult">x</span>61), <span class="occ">goldsmith and actor</span>, was the son of Robert Cane of Windsor, butcher; he may be the otherwise unnamed &#145;Keane&#146;, son of Robert Kene and Lucresia Andrews, who was baptized at the parish church of St John, Windsor, on 2 March 1589. He was apprenticed to Richard Cane, his elder brother, for ten years beginning in August 1602, and took his oath as a freeman of the Goldsmiths' Company in January 1611. By January 1612 he had evidently established his own shop, and he took on the first of nine apprentices who bound themselves to him over the following forty-two years, at least two of whom worked as actors concurrently with their training as goldsmiths.<br>
<br>Cane may have returned to his native district to marry: on 1 June 1612 an Andrew Keine married Mary Homses(?) at the church of St John, Eton; a son, Richard, was baptized there on 28 February 1613. Seven years later Thomas Cane, son of Andrew and Mary Cane, was baptized at St Leonard, Shoreditch. However, if any of these entries are indeed connected with Andrew Cane the goldsmith this first family would appear to have died out. At his death Cane's widow was called Anne (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Spencer), and the only surviving child, called &#145;my son&#146; by Anne in her will, was Edward, made free as a goldsmith by patrimony in 1649, and hence likely to have been born in the 1620s. By 1656 Edward had established a shop in Bishopsgate, and his own son Andrew in turn took up the trade of his grandfather.<br>
<br>Quite when Cane began his theatrical career is unclear, but since by 1622 he was described as among &#145;the chief of them at the Phoenix&#146; it was by then well developed. For the next twenty years he was a leading player with a number of companies, performing not only at the Phoenix or Cockpit in Drury Lane, but also at the Fortune, the Salisbury Court playhouse, and the Red Bull. Cane specialized in comic roles, and was renowned as a fool well after the theatres had closed (1642&#150;60); as a fictional figure he appears as Quick in the pamphlet dialogue <span class="italic">The Stage-Players' Complaint</span> (1641). In the tradition of Tarlton he performed jigs and extempore entertainments as well as formal dramatic parts, and was known for a spirited, rapid style of delivery.<br>
<br>By early 1624 Cane had joined the troupe playing at the Fortune Playhouse, then known as the Palsgrave's Company. In January of that year he was named by his dying colleague Francis Grace to administer the payment of Grace's player's share to his creditors; in the same year Cane put his name, with other players, to a bond of agreement drawn up by the actor and manager Richard Gunnell, a document which thirty years later remained the subject of a dispute with Gunnell's heirs, his daughter Margaret and her husband, the actor William Wintersel. After 1625, when the Palsgrave's Company disbanded, little is known of Cane's theatrical activities for the following six years, although he may have joined the King and Queen of Bohemia's Company, which also played at the Fortune.<br>
<br>Late in 1631 Cane emerged as the leading player of a new troupe in the service of the infant Prince Charles, established by special licence. By that date the company was already performing at the relatively new playhouse in Salisbury Court, featuring the play <span class="italic">Holland's Leaguer</span> by Shakerley Marmion, in which Cane played Trimalchio, &#145;<i>a humorous gallant</i>&#146;, and his two apprentices John Wright and Arthur Savill the female roles of Millicent and Quartilla. By 1633 the company had moved to the larger Red Bull Playhouse, and in 1640 they moved once again to the Fortune. Cane's only other known part, though it remains unnamed, was in a satirical play, <span class="italic">The Whore New Vamped</span>, which in 1639 led to Cane being accused of libelling two London aldermen, associated with the wine monopoly.<br>
<br>Prince Charles's Company received royal patronage throughout the eleven years of its existence, playing relatively frequently at court, and accompanying the king and queen on progress as far as Nottinghamshire and southern Derbyshire in the summer of 1634. The company also toured independently: Cane was granted permission to play in Norwich, for example, in March 1636.<br>
<br>Cane appears to have continued business as a goldsmith even during the years of his eminence on the stage. In September 1633 the company wardens fined him for defective wares: those named indicate that he dealt in domestic and decorative silver goods. His shop was in the parish of St Giles Cripplegate, near to the theatres at which he followed his parallel career. He was still in London at the end of 1642 when he took part in a riotous demonstration at Guildhall designed to get petitions heard by the mayor and council, but thereafter he left for Oxford, where he enlisted in the army and worked in the royalist mint. Cane had returned to London by the later 1640s, resuming his trade as goldsmith as well as taking part in some surreptitious playing: he was arrested while performing at the Red Bull in January 1650.<br>
<br>Cane's last formal activity as a goldsmith was probably to attend the court at which his apprentice Nathaniel Cooper was granted his freedom, in January 1656. He died within the next few years, in his later sixties or early seventies; his wife, Anne, describes herself as his widow in the will she made in May 1661. She left cash bequests of &pound;200, and the will is framed in a way which suggests that Edward Cane had already received his patrimony. Andrew Cane appears to have died a man of moderate wealth.<br>
