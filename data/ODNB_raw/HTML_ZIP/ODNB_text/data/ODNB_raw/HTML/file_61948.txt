<span class="headword">Shepherd,  Ian Douglas  Dawson-</span>  (1915&#150;1996), <span class="occ">charity administrator</span>, was born on 23 September 1915 at Port Said, Egypt, the second of four children of John Dawson-Shepherd, an agriculturist in the colonial service, and his wife, Margaret. He had an older brother, Hanbury, and two younger sisters, Pamela and Penelope. Dawson-Shepherd attended London University and in 1939 joined the army where he was commissioned in the King's regiment (Liverpool) and rose to the rank of captain. He was seriously wounded in north Africa and invalided out of the army in 1944. Married twice, he had four daughters with his first wife, Margaret Grigg: Rosemary Hope (1941&#150;1986), Anne, Sarah, and Deborah, and two with his second wife, Margaret Kathleen Johns: Judith and Andraea.<br>
<br>Dawson-Shepherd's first child, Rosemary, was born on 20 March 1941 with cerebral palsy. It was the family's experience of trying to care for Rosemary against the background of poor or non-existent services and hostile public attitudes to disability that led Dawson-Shepherd, together with two other parents, Alex Moira and Eric Hodgson, and a social worker, Jean Garwood, to found the National Spastics Society. Planning began in October 1951 when Dawson-Shepherd laid a &pound;5 note on the table of the meeting as the starting capital and promised to raise a million pounds in five years, a promise he kept. At the time that he made this promise he privately doubted whether his own wartime injuries, which left him with a permanent impairment and needing to use callipers for a number of years, together with a pre-existing stammer, fitted him for a leadership role in a major national organization.<br>
<br>On 6 January 1952 the inaugural meeting of the National Spastics Society was held, attended by parents from across the country. The society's main aims were to establish a network of parents' groups and service centres to cater for the largely unmet needs of children and adults with cerebral palsy, to challenge attitudes towards disabled people, and to fund medical research into the cause of the disability.<br>
<br>Dawson-Shepherd pioneered the application of marketing and public relations techniques, which later became standard in the charity sector, to build the organization's income from &pound;11,000 in its first year to &pound;1,400,000 at his retirement from the chair in 1960. This remarkable growth was achieved by an astute mixture of campaigning, fund-raising, and initiatives to raise public awareness. The marketing strategy focused on donations from ordinary people and culminated in the establishment of the Spastics football pools, an innovation that brought in over &pound;2 million a year. This allowed the organization to expand rapidly in the late 1950s and early 1960s into the largest charity for physical disability in the country, with over thirty major services and a network of local parents' support groups being set up in less than ten years. Another innovation was the use of popular celebrities to attract publicity and help with fund-raising. Together with Wilfred Pickles, then a major BBC radio star, in July 1955 Dawson-Shepherd founded a sister organization, Stars Organization for Spastics (now Stars Organisation Supporting Action for People with Cerebral Palsy). The founding members of the sister organization included such popular entertainers as Vera Lynn, Tommy Cooper, Thora Hird, Harry Secombe, and Peter Sellers. Advertising and fund-raising appeals focused on the needs of young disabled children as public sympathy was more easily aroused for children.<br>
<br>Dawson-Shepherd brought the needs of disabled people into strip cartoons, comics, and women's magazines. The award-winning <span class="italic">Jessie</span>, an adventure story for children featuring a child with cerebral palsy, which was based on an idea by Rosemary, and <span class="italic">Every Eight Hours</span>, a campaigning documentary, both reached wide audiences. The latter was one of the first attempts to combine news and documentary techniques to carry a public-education campaign on prime time television. Made for the BBC by his second wife, Margaret Johns, and personally scripted by Dawson-Shepherd, it was shown in 1960 to critical and popular acclaim. It featured Richard Dimbleby, at that time one of the best-known broadcasters in the country, and was repeated by the BBC because of demand from the public.<br>
<br>This populist approach was a defining hallmark of the charity in its early years, in a sector dominated by establishment charities. Dawson-Shepherd characterized the organization as &#145;working class Davids shouting at the state Goliath&#146;, and continually strove to position it as the &#145;ordinary man's charity&#146; in a post-war world that had begun to tire of class distinctions  (Dawson-Shepherd, 57).<br>
<br>Dawson-Shepherd also encouraged research into cerebral palsy. Advised by Dr Ronald MacKeith of the department of child health at Guy's Hospital, who had set up a pioneering clinic for children with cerebral palsy, he recruited Dr Paul Polani to develop a strategy for research into the causes of a number of neurological conditions. The pediatric research unit was established at Guy's in 1960 with a large grant from the organization. The association with MacKeith led to the establishment of the Mac Keith Press with support from the society in 1958. Its journal, <span class="italic">Cerebral Palsy Bulletin</span>, remained a pre-eminent source for worldwide medical research in pediatric neurology, helping to establish the field as a medical specialism.<br>
<br>Because of the pressures of his job as international marketing director for Aspro-Nicholas, Dawson-Shepherd resigned as chairman in 1960. It was also becoming clear to him that the skills and entrepreneurship needed in establishing a major charity were not necessarily those most suitable for sustaining it. There had been growing clashes with some members of the board and senior staff, who found his creative but sometimes maverick approach hard to cope with. He continued active involvement with the organization and made a series of films about disability. However, he became increasingly critical of the organization's financial performance, and of what he perceived to be its failure to build on the early public relations successes. He was fully supportive of the change of name to Scope in 1994 and saw this as a natural fulfilment of the organization's early aspirations, arguing eloquently for the adoption of the new name.<br>
<br>Dawson-Shepherd returned to the issues of medical prevention in 1990 when he used his considerable reputation within the medical establishment and his relationship with Professor Polani to found the Little Foundation, which aimed to reduce the incidence of disability at birth by research into the causes of neurological disorders. Despite his continued involvement and the support it received from some of the most renowned medical experts in the world, the foundation was not able to repeat his earlier fund-raising success. The funding environment had become more competitive and Dawson-Shepherd was still fund-raising for some of the major projects when he died of heart failure at Queen Mary's Hospital, London, on 8 January 1996. He was cremated and his ashes were buried at Girne (Kyrenia) in the old British cemetery in northern Cyprus, in the family plot and in the country where he had spent part of his childhood.<br>
