<span class="headword">Varley,  Julia</span>  (1871&#150;1952), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 16 March 1871 in Horton, Bradford, the first child of Richard Varley, an engine tenter (a skilled worsted mill worker), and his wife, Martha Ann Alderson. Her maternal great-grandfather, Joseph Alderson, who died in 1886, was a veteran of Peterloo and the Chartist campaigns. Julia Varley attended St Andrew's School, Listerhills, Bradford, and the Quaker Sunday school, but because of family circumstances left school at the age of twelve, and became a part-time mill worker, soon progressing to full-time weaver.<br>
<br>Julia Varley joined the Weavers and Textile Workers' Union and by the age of fifteen had become Bradford branch secretary. On her mother's death she had to give up full-time mill work to care for her younger sisters and brothers, but this did not stop her union work, remarkable at a time when few women were members of unions, let alone active in them. Her involvement increased with the Manningham Mills strike of 1890&#150;91; she became the first woman member of the Bradford Trades Council as secretary of her union branch, and served on its executive committee from 1899 to 1906.<br>
<br>This marked a considerable broadening of Julia Varley's activities away from &#145;pure&#146; union activity. In 1903 she was appointed by Bradford corporation to inquire into employment conditions and assist in the organization of school meals. She served on the Bradford board of (poor law) guardians from 1904 to 1907. This brought her into contact with tramping women, whose conditions she determined to investigate at first hand. She therefore disguised herself and tramped from Leeds to Liverpool, ostensibly in search of an errant husband, sleeping in casual wards on the way. She followed this up with a similar tour of London doss-houses. She also became a suffragette and was twice imprisoned in 1907. By comparison with her doss-house and casual ward experiences, she found food and accommodation in Holloway quite good.<br>
<br>At this time Julia Varley had also become involved with Mary Macarthur and the National Federation of Women Workers (NFWW), and in 1907 they succeeded in establishing a branch of the NFWW among the female small-chain makers of Cradley Heath. The agitation begun by the NFWW was taken up and given high-profile national publicity by the women's suffrage press and the Anti-Sweating League, with the result that small-chain making was included within the provisions of the 1909 <span class="roman">Trade Boards Act</span>. In 1909 Edward Cadbury invited her to Birmingham to organize women workers; she immediately established an NFWW branch at Bournville, which affiliated to the Birmingham Trades Council, with Julia Varley as branch delegate. In January 1910 she was elected to the executive (again the first woman in both positions), and was immediately involved in successful campaigns concerned with pay and conditions of bakers and chain makers. However, the attempt to establish a branch of the newly formed Workers' Union (WU) in the potteries at Bilston not only failed, but involved her in physical violence.<br>
<br>By 1912, Julia Varley's involvement with the WU had come to convince her that men and women should organize in a single union, and she transferred her allegiance to it from the NFWW. Its heartland was in the Black Country, and in the hard but ultimately successful 1913 metalworkers' strikes Julia Varley played a major part in rallying the strikers' women to the cause. A strike among Cornish clay miners was less successful. However, a major change to the WU's fortunes occurred with the First World War, when the influx of new, especially female, labour into munitions led to a sharp increase in membership, particularly among women; from 5000 in 1914, the WU's women membership had risen to over 80,000 by 1918. Until August 1915 Julia Varley was the WU's only woman organizer, and she continued to organize actively right through the war, despite having to undergo a major throat operation early in 1917.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, the war brought to an end Julia Varley's connection with the Birmingham Trades Council, which had initially given qualified support to war work, but soon changed its position, especially after the introduction of conscription in 1916. This apparent lack of patriotism caused Julia Varley and a number of other council members to form a breakaway body, the Birmingham Trade Union Industrial Council, which ceased activity in 1918, when most of its members reaffiliated to the Birmingham Trades Council. However, Julia Varley apparently remained unreconciled.<br>
<br>In general at this time Julia Varley seems to have become more favourable to certain official institutions. In 1917&#150;18 she was selected to serve on two bodies set up by the Ministry of Labour: first, the Labour Advisory Board, responsible for investigating and reporting on the working of labour exchanges; the second was as part of a commission of five representative women sent to investigate rumours of immoral behaviour by WAACs in France (the committee found the rumours groundless). More controversially, she accepted an invitation to serve on the executive of the National Alliance of Employers and Employed, a body regarded with deep suspicion by most of the trade union movement; the executive committee of her own WU gave her permission to join provided it was made clear that she was acting in a purely personal capacity.<br>
<br>After the war Julia Varley continued as chief woman organizer for the WU, and, after their 1929 merger, for the Transport and General Workers' Union, until 1936. She was elected to the newly established general council of the TUC as one of two representatives of women workers from 1921 to 1924, and from 1926 to 1935; in this capacity she attended various International Labour Organization conferences in Geneva, Rome, and Vienna. She served on various government committees, notably on the working of the labour exchanges, and the condition of women and young persons under the two-shift system. She became involved in the work of the Society for the Overseas Settlement of British Women, and in 1925 travelled with a group of emigrants to Canada. As a member of the executive committee of the Industrial Welfare Society, she got to know the duke of York (later George VI). Another unexpected friend was Nancy Astor, who apparently warmed to a fellow rebel. In 1931 she was appointed OBE for her public work, and in March 1936 she finally retired from the trade union movement and active participation in public life, though still taking an active interest from her home at 42 Hay Green Lane, Bournville.<br>
<br>Julia Varley worked to assure women's position within the trade union movement as a whole, rather than (like Mary Macarthur) in separate unions. She achieved high position in one of the country's largest unions, and with it a prominent place in public life, which she enjoyed. She was sturdily built, wore pince-nez, and habitually had a determined expression. Her general approach was forthright, though she was capable of kindness and affection. Throughout the 1930s her eyesight gradually failed to the point of total blindness, though she still kept contact with the TUC and the local church. She died of a stroke on 24 November 1952 at 32 Hampden Street, Bradford, the home of her sisters, Mrs Martha Jarrett and Mrs Jessie Wooller; and after a service in All Saints' Church, Bradford, she was buried in Undercliffe cemetery.<br>
