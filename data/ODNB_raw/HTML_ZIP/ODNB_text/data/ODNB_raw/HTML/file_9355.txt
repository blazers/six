<span class="headword">Ferrabosco,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1626, <em>d.</em> 1682), <span class="occ">organist and composer</span>, was baptized on 9 October 1626 at St Alfege, Greenwich, youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9353/', "Alfonso Ferrabosco (c.1575&#150;1628)")</script> and his wife, Ellen (<i>d</i>. 1638), daughter of Nicholas Lanier (<i>c</i>.1523&#150;1612) and his second wife, Lucretia. His father died in March 1628 and was succeeded at court by two other sons, <a href="#cosubject_74585">Henry</a> and <a href="#cosubject_9354">Alfonso [<i>see below</i>]</a>. No doubt they were instrumental in arranging that a livery allowance of &pound;16 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. due to Henry was transferred to John in 1631. He is not known to have served at court before 1642, but two payments to him as musician (on 30 July 1646 and 26 April 1649) suggest that later he may have attended Charles I, perhaps at Oxford.<br>
<br>In 1662 Ferrabosco became organist and master of the choristers at Ely Cathedral. Three music books mainly in his hand are extant (CUL, Ely MSS 1, 4, 28); in June 1663 the dean and chapter paid him &pound;10 &#145;in consideration of his pains in pricking out of Bookes&#146;. They also paid him for assisting with &#145;several music meetings&#146; between 1663 and 1665. His anthem &#145;The king shall rejoice&#146; may have been written for Charles II's visit to Ely in 1669. At the king's request he was awarded the MusB degree at Cambridge, conferred in 1671. He relinquished the duties of master of the choristers in 1669, but continued as organist, although it is believed he lost his sight in his last years. Unfortunately, much of Ferrabosco's surviving music&#151;mostly services and anthems&#151;is now incomplete, but it shows a solid and conservative style. Ferrabosco married Anne Burton at Trinity Church, Ely, on 28 June 1679; their son John was baptized there on 12 August following, but died in May 1682. John senior was buried in the same church on 15 October 1682, survived by his wife.<br>
<br>His brother <a name="cosubject_9354"></a><span class="headword">Alfonso Ferrabosco</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1652) was sworn at court on 19 March 1628 as a <span class="occ">musician</span> &#145;for the viols and wind instruments&#146;, but seems to have served even earlier, having received a new year's gift in 1627. He performed among the wind players, &#145;in the Chapel and at his Majesty's table&#146;. Both he and his brother Henry played in the processions through London before the masque <span class="italic">The Triumph of Peace</span> in 1634. A &#145;Mr Ferrabosco&#146;, perhaps this man, was in the service of Lord Cranborne, eldest son of the earl of Salisbury, in the late 1640s. Alfonso Ferrabosco was buried at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 14 July 1652. His brother <a name="cosubject_74585"></a><span class="headword">Henry Ferrabosco</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1658?), <span class="occ">musician</span>, was appointed jointly with his uncle Andrea Lanier on 24 October 1625 and served among the wind players at court. He later received two of the four places previously held by his father, Alfonso [II], one as &#145;composer&#146; although he is not known as such. Between January 1645 and March 1646 Henry signed receipts for money assigned to groups of musicians serving Charles I at Oxford, but he was in London by 1651. He is presumed to be the &#145;Capt. Henry Ferribosco, lately slain by the enemy&#146; in Jamaica in 1658.<br>
