<span class="headword">Manley,  Delarivier</span>  (<em>c.</em>1670&#150;1724), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in Jersey or possibly at sea between Jersey and Guernsey, the third of the six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17940/', "Sir Roger Manley (d. 1687)")</script>, royalist army officer and historian, and his wife from the Spanish Netherlands, probably named Mary Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1675). Sir Roger Manley was the second son of Cornelius Manley of Erbistock; one brother, Sir Francis Manley, was also a royalist but another, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67369/', "John Manley")</script>, was a major in the parliamentary army and supporter of the Commonwealth. Manley's father was appointed lieutenant-governor and commander of his majesty's castles, forts, and forces on Jersey in 1667 under Sir Thomas Morgan; Delarivier appears to have been named after the latter's wife, Delariviere Cholmondoley Morgan.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducation"></a>Early years and education</h2>In November 1672 Sir Roger left Jersey to serve as a captain of the Royal regiment of foot guards at Windsor. The family, after sojourns at Tower Hamlets, Brussels, and Portsmouth, moved to Landguard Fort in Suffolk where Sir Roger, now widowed, was made governor in February 1680. The principal source for Delarivier's biography is her own account in the 1714 <span class="italic">Adventures of Rivella</span> (reissued by the publisher Edmund Curll as <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life of Mrs. Manley</span> in 1714 and 1717, and as <span class="italic">Mrs. Manley's History of her Own Life and Times</span> in 1725); a brief account is also provided by Manley in her most successful work of scandal fiction, the <span class="italic">New Atalantis</span> (1709), in the first-person narrative of Delia given in the second volume. Manley's autobiographical writings are, however, self-justifying and not always reliable as sources of fact about her life. Manley tells us she was educated at home, apart from a short stay with her brother at the French home of a Huguenot minister, where she was sent to recover from her youthful passion for a young actor and playwright turned soldier named James Carlisle whose regiment visited Landguard Fort in 1685. She claims to have acquired fluent French here, which was to stand her in good stead in her inveterate plundering of French sources for her works. She also claims to have missed the opportunity of a promise to take up a vacancy as maid of honour to the queen with Mary of Modena's precipitate flight from England in December 1687.<br>
<br>Manley's father died in March 1687 and left Delarivier &pound;200, and a share of the residue of his estate. One of her two surviving brothers, Edward, died in 1688, as did William Eyton, Sir Roger's successor at Landguard Fort and one of the two executors of Sir Roger's will (the other, Edward Lloyd, died the year previously). Delarivier's eldest sister, Mary Elizabeth, was recently married to Captain Francis Braithewaite, whom Delarivier disliked. Her brother Francis was at sea, where he died in June 1693. She and Cornelia, on the death of the lady Delarivier Manley describes as &#145;an old out-of-fashion aunt&#146;  (Manley, <span class="italic">New Atalantis</span>, 223), fell to the sole care of John Manley, son to the puritan uncle John.<br>
<br>John Manley (1654&#150;1713) was a tory lawyer who later became a successful MP. He had married a Cornish orphaned heiress, Anne Grosse, at Westminster Abbey on 19 January 1679, but succeeded in persuading Delarivier (whether she knew the liaison was bigamous or not) to marry him; they had at least one son, John, born on 24 June 1691 and baptized on 13 July 1691 in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, as the child of &#145;John and Dela Manley&#146;. In January 1694, under the protection of Barbara Villiers, duchess of Cleveland and long-term mistress to Charles II, Delarivier either left or was left by her bigamous husband, but only six months later was expelled from the duchess's house in Arlington Street on the grounds of a flirtation with the duchess's son.<br>
<br>Manley appears to have had a winning personality, although she and others admitted that she was not a remarkable beauty. In his <span class="italic">Journal to Stella</span> on 28 January 1712 Jonathan Swift described her as having &#145;very generous principles for one of her sort; and a great deal of sense and invention; she is about forty, very homely, and very fat&#146;  (Swift, 2.474). Manley herself endorsed this impression, describing herself as &#145;from her youth &hellip; inclined to fat&#146; and complaining that her appearance had been spoilt by smallpox, but &#145;considering her disadvantage, she has the most easy air that one can have; her hair is of a pale ash-colour, fine, and in a large quantity&#146; and moreover &#145;none that became acquainted with her, could refrain from loving her&#146;  (Manley, <span class="italic">Rivella</span>, 47).<h2>
<a name="Firstpublication"></a>First publication</h2>From 1694 to 1696 Manley travelled around the south-west of England; a series of eight letters composed during these travels to one &#145;J.H.&#146; (possibly James Hargreaves or John Manley) was published without her permission as <span class="italic">Letters by Mrs Manley</span> in 1696. It is possible that Manley was travelling with her &#145;husband&#146;, John Manley, who was inspecting Pendennis Castle to determine rents due to its owner in summer 1694; Delarivier's biographer Dolores Diane Clark Duff speculates that a son, Francis, baptized on 9 August 1694 at the church of St Mary, Truro, as the child of Anne and John Manley, and buried in December 1694, may have been Dela's also, given the fourteen-year gap between this and the birth of his last child by his first wife  (Clark Duff, 47).<br>
<br>Manley had the letters withdrawn from publication and they were not reissued until after her death in 1725, when Edmund Curll produced them under the title <span class="italic">A Stagecoach Journey to Exeter</span>. The letters reveal an early debt to the works of Marie Catherine de la Motte, Baronne d'Aulnoy, the scandalous travel and letter writer, now better known for her fairy tales. Later in her career Manley published another series of letters related to contemporary scandals in two parts as <span class="italic">The lady's pacquet of letters taken from her by a French privateer in her passage to Holland, or, The lady's pacquet broke open</span> bound with d'Aulnoy's <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Court of England</span> (January 1707) and <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Earl of Warwick</span> (November 1707). This collection of letters was republished in 1711 under the title <span class="italic">Court intrigues in a collection of original letters from the island of the new Atalantis &amp;c.</span>, which Manley disclaimed as a pirated edition in a number of <span class="italic">The Examiner</span> on 14 June 1711.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Letters by Mrs Manley</span> had been published to coincide with the production of Manley's first play, a comedy called <span class="italic">The Lost Lover, or, The Jealous Husband</span> (1696). The cast included the young Colley Cibber, but the play was not a success and its author claims in <span class="italic">Rivella</span> that her reputation was further damaged by unfounded rumours of an affair with the company's ageing part-owner Sir Thomas Skipwith  (Manley, <span class="italic">Rivella</span>, 73&#150;4). However, an oriental tragedy entitled <span class="italic">The Royal Mischief</span> performed at Lincoln's Inn Fields in April of the same year met with better success, largely thanks to the powerful portrayal of a self-seeking and sexually assertive princess named Homais.<br>
<br>Manley's fame was considerable enough to win her the dubious honour of a satirical representation as Marsilia, a vain female playwright, in an anonymous play of 1696 called <span class="italic">The Female Wits</span>. Other women writers attacked in the play, Mary Pix and Catherine Trotter, contributed to a small volume of poems by women poets Manley produced to the memory of John Dryden called <span class="italic">The Nine Muses</span> (1700).<h2>
<a name="Lawloveandbrokenloyalties"></a>Law, love, and broken loyalties</h2>Manley's acquaintance with Catherine Trotter led to a retreat from literary production for some years. In December 1696 Trotter asked her to assist in securing the freedom of John Tilly, governor of the prison at the Fleet, who was under investigation for corruption and taking bribes by a committee of the House of Commons of which Delarivier's &#145;husband&#146;, John Manley, was a member; this introduction resulted in a six-year affair between Manley and Tilly. The couple became involved in another lawsuit, a dispute over the fortune of Christopher Monck, second duke of Albemarle, between the earl of Bath and Ralph, earl of Montagu, in which John Manley was also entangled. In hopes of turning a profit, Delarivier and Tilly undertook the management of one of the claimants to the Albemarle fortune, another Christopher Monck, who had been released from debtors' prison at the Fleet into Tilly's custody. Manley gives considerable space in her <span class="italic">Rivella</span> to an account of their ultimately fruitless activities. When Tilly's first wife died in December 1702, Delarivier recounts in <span class="italic">Rivella</span> that she nobly sacrificed her love to allow him to marry a widowed heiress, Margaret Smith (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Reresby), and repair his fortunes. Letter 33 of <span class="italic">The lady's pacquet broke open</span> narrates the same sacrifice.<br>
<br>Over this period Manley made the acquaintance of Richard Steele when he was a young soldier. She assisted him in procuring a midwife for the delivery of his illegitimate daughter and in dabbling in alchemical ventures. Letters 12 to 24 and 34 to 37 of <span class="italic">The lady's pacquet</span> give their correspondence and volume one of the <span class="italic">New Atalantis</span> provides a narrative account of their friendship between 1696 and 1702  (Manley, <span class="italic">New Atalantis</span>, 100&#150;04). The friendship was abruptly severed, however, when Steele refused to assist Manley with money to enable her to travel to the country after Tilly's marriage. Manley and Steele were to be inveterate and public enemies with numerous exchanges in print, particularly in <span class="italic">The Tatler</span>, <span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, and <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> (for a summary of these see Morgan, 115&#150;16). The rift, exacerbated by their political differences, lasted until 1717. The preface to Manley's last performed play, <span class="italic">Lucius, the First Christian King of Britain</span>, details the reconciliation, sweetened by Steele's payment of &pound;600 for the play's production by his Drury Lane Company.<br>
<br>Despite Steele's refusal, Manley evidently managed to find some means of support since according to letter 33 of <span class="italic">The lady's pacquet</span> she made two visits to the country to repair her spirits, the second to Bristol where an intrigue with an unidentified man she calls &#145;Mr Worthy&#146; aided her recovery, but also ended in separation. Manley spent spring 1704 in London before making a visit to her friend the poet Sarah Fyge in Buckingham. Their correspondence is given in letters 5&#150;9 of <span class="italic">The lady's pacquet</span>. This friendship too ended bitterly when Sarah Fyge gave evidence in the Doctors' Commons in 1705 against Manley, Mrs Mary Thompson, and a forger, Edmund Smith, in their attempt to gain compensation for Thompson from the estate of her common-law husband, a Mr Pheasant of Upwood, Huntingdonshire (Wylie, 392&#150;3; Manley, <span class="italic">Lady's pacquet</span>, letter 33). Manley had hoped to win &pound;100 a year from her involvement in this lawsuit and here too she attacked a false friend in print presenting Sarah Fyge as a violent wife and poor poet in the first volume of her <span class="italic">New Atalantis</span>. By 1705 it became necessary for Delarivier Manley to resume her writing career to secure her living and she embarked on her most successful venture as a writer: the production of anti-whig satire veiled as romance.<h2>
<a name="Midcareer"></a>Mid-career</h2>Manley's <span class="italic">Secret History of Queen Zarah and the Zarazians</span> (1705) drew on French sources for both its preface, a close translation from an essay of 1703 by Abb&eacute; de Morvan de Bellegarde (advocating the advantages and pleasures of the short fiction over the romance), and its narrative, derived from a 1680 French satire about Charles II and Barbara Villiers, entitled <span class="italic">Hattig&eacute;</span>. It was, however, also typical of the prose fiction in which she was to become adept, providing an accurate if scandalous account of whig political machination. In all her fiction, but especially in this first work, John and Sarah Churchill are major targets, their dominance over Queen Anne a source of anxiety and rancour for the tory ideals and ambitions of Manley. A second part, exploiting the popularity of the first, appeared in the same year. A second tragedy, <span class="italic">Almyna, or, The Arabian Vow</span>, was performed in December 1706 at the new Haymarket Theatre&#151;an early example of her tendency to cryptic self-referentiality in the anagrammatical use of her own name for its powerful heroine derived from Scheherezade in the popular <span class="italic">Arabian Nights Entertainment</span>.<br>
<br>In July 1709 Manley may have turned her hand to the periodical, appearing as Phoebe Crackenthorpe, editor of the <span class="italic">Female Tatler</span>, although her claim to the title has been disputed. The fact that Mrs Crackenthorpe handed over the editorship to a Society of Ladies in October 1709 at just the moment that Delarivier Manley found herself taken up for seditious libel suggests some support for the conviction of Paul Bunyan Anderson and of Fidelis Morgan that she was (at least one of) its original author(s). Manley was taken into custody nine days after the publication of the second volume of <span class="italic">Secret memoirs and manners of several persons of quality of both sexes, from the new Atalantis, an island in the Mediterranean</span> on 29 October 1709. She apparently surrendered herself after a secretary of state's warrant had been issued against her, and her publishers John Morphew and John Woodward and printer John Barber had been detained. Four days later the latter were discharged but Manley remained in custody until 5 November when she was released on bail. After several continuations of the case, she was tried and discharged on 13 February 1710. A note in the Public Record Office (State Papers 34, 11, fol. 69) recently uncovered by Ruth Herman recording that a warrant had been issued for the arrest of Morphew and Woodward on 11 November 1709, a full two weeks after Manley was taken into custody, suggests that Manley did not in fact surrender herself for the sake of her colleagues as the only remaining account of the trial, her own in <span class="italic">Rivella</span>, claims. In this same account, Manley describes her defence of the book on grounds that her information came by &#145;inspiration&#146; and her rebuke of her judges for bringing &#145;a woman to her trial for writing a few amorous trifles&#146;  (Manley, <span class="italic">Rivella</span>, 110&#150;11). The two volumes of <span class="italic">Secret memoirs</span> (the first volume had appeared in May 1709) were <i>romans-&agrave;-clef</i> with separately printed keys, which offered a succession of narratives of seduction and betrayal by notorious whig grandees told to Astrea, an allegorical figure of justice. The narratives were mainly told by female characters including an allegorical figure of Intelligence and a midwife. In <span class="italic">Rivella</span> Manley claims that her trial led her to conclude that &#145;politics is not the business of a woman&#146;  (ibid., 112), and that thereafter she turned exclusively to stories of love.<br>
<br>In fact her next work, the two-volume <span class="italic">Memoirs of Europe, towards the close of the eighth century, written by Eginardus, secretary and favourite to Charlemagne</span>, of May and November 1710 continued the work of propaganda for the tory party and went on to be published as the third and fourth volumes of the <span class="italic">New Atalantis</span>. These volumes used male narrative voices more extensively. The first volume was addressed to Lord Peterborough and on the strength of this Delarivier Manley sought, with Swift's support, a pension from Peterborough in July 1711  (Swift, 2.306). The second volume was more concerned with stories of love than with politics but the satirical purpose of exposing whig corruption through analogy with sexual depravity remained evident. The author also sought assistance on several occasions from Robert Harley, sending him a copy of the first volume of <span class="italic">Memoirs of Europe</span> on 12 May 1710. As a result of her patient solicitations she received &pound;50 from Harley, acknowledged in her letter of thanks dated 14 June 1714  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 5.458). This is the only remuneration she is known to have received for her partisan services.<br>
<br>From 1711 to 1713 Manley concentrated on political journalism, editing Jonathan Swift's <span class="italic">Examiner</span> for number 7 (14 September 1710) and numbers 46 to 52 (14 June to 26 July 1711). These contained a series of direct attacks on whig propaganda, but are without the female narrative frames or striking female protagonists that are her trade mark in prose fiction and drama. She produced a number of pamphlets addressing contemporary controversies and intervening in political debate in this period: <span class="italic">A True Narrative of what Pass'd at the Examination of the Marquis of Guiscard</span> (1711); <span class="italic">A Learned Comment on Dr. Hare's Sermon</span> (1711); and <span class="italic">The Honour and Prerogative of the Queen's Majesty Vindicated</span> (1713).<h2>
<a name="Finalpublications"></a>Final publications</h2>Manley's liaison with the Jacobite printer and alderman of the City of London <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37148/', "John Barber (bap. 1675, d. 1741)")</script> may have begun as early as 1705 when he published her <span class="italic">Queen Zarah</span>. In any case, by spring 1714 she and her sister Cornelia were living at his residence and printing house on the corner of Old Fish Street and Lambeth Hill in London, although Delarivier retained a country residence for the summer months in Oxfordshire (her will cites the house as in Berkley, taken to be Beckley). With Queen Anne's death in 1714 and the decline of tory hopes, Manley seems to have turned away from partisan publication without losing her relish for scandal. Her third-person (auto)biography, <span class="italic">The Adventures of Rivella</span>, is a tongue-in-cheek riposte to Edmund Curll who had threatened her with the publication of a scandalous account of her life by Charles Gildon. Manley's narrative frame is that of two men discussing Rivella, although she herself is not present. Here, as in other works, Manley complains about the double standard: &#145;if she had been a man, she had been without fault&#146;  (Manley, <span class="italic">Rivella</span>, 47) but also acknowledges how successfully she had exploited the display of her sex as an author: &#145;it would have been a <i>fault in her, not to have been faulty</i>&#146;  (ibid., 114).<br>
<br>Manley's last performed play, <span class="italic">Lucius, the First Christian King of Britain</span> (Drury Lane, 1717), a work of fervent nationalism, puts centre stage (like her other plays) a powerful woman, Rosalind, Queen of Britain. <span class="italic">The Power of Love in Seven Novels</span> (1720) reworked five tales from William Painter's 1566 versions of Italian and French novels entitled <span class="italic">The Palace of Pleasure</span>, and drew on a contemporary scandal for one and, probably, invention for the last. In this underrated work Manley thoroughly transforms her sources to make them relevant to contemporary contexts and debates, delivers racy plotting, and panders to her readers' voyeurism.<br>
<br>According to Edmund Curll, Barber's tyrannous behaviour towards her and his infidelity with the maid he had engaged for her, one Sarah Dovekin or Dufkin, impeded Manley's completion of a second volume of novels, presumably also from Painter, before her death  (Curll, <span class="italic">Impartial History</span>, 47). In a letter to the government, Curll also reported his sighting of a letter from Delarivier Manley stating that &#145;a fifth volume of the Atalantis had been for some time printed off, and lies ready for publication&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 2nd ser., 2/49, 6 Dec 1856, 441&#150;3). Delarivier Manley died at Barber's house on 11 July 1724 of a &#145;cholic&#146;  (Curll, <span class="italic">Impartial History</span>, 44) and was buried as her will requested at the church of St Benet Paul's Wharf, under a white marble stone (later excavated in building work). In her will (dated 6 October 1723) she mentions two plays now lost, a tragedy called the &#145;Duke of Somerset&#146; and a comedy called the &#145;Double Mistress&#146;, which might turn a profit on publication, but asks for all her other manuscripts to be destroyed so that &#145;none Ghost-like may walk after my decease&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/599, 194&#150;5); the same instructions held for any correspondence. <span class="italic">The Life and Character of John Barber</span> (1741) refers to &#145;a Miscellany, not yet collected, of valuable pieces in verse and prose&#146;  (p. 10) which never appeared. She had little else to leave except &pound;352 capital and &pound;352 annuity from &pound;500 worth of South Sea stock bought in 1721, and complex instructions for her executors, Cornelia Markendale (her sister) and Henrietta Essex Manley, a child's coat maker and presumably relation, to endeavour through the offices of Swift, to procure from his executor half of the &pound;50 annual patent owed to her by the bookseller Benjamin Tooke. The remaining half, owed to her by her printer John Barber, was waived in acknowledgement of &#145;so many favours&#146; already received.<br>
<br>Manley's plays and prose works were highly successful and popular in her own time, though they failed to secure her the financial and political patronage she craved. The remarkably accurate scandalous and political references in her prose works may now be obscure, but her energetic style and plotting made her an important contributor to the development of the modern novel as a vehicle for entertainment. Her clear-sighted exposure of sexual double standards, if leavened with sexual voyeurism and a taste for the scandalous and perverse, reveals her to be an early exponent of Enlightenment feminism.<br>
