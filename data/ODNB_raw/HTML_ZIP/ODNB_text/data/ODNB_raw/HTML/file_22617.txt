<span class="headword">Potter,  Richard</span>  (1799&#150;1886), <span class="occ">natural philosopher</span>, was born in Manchester on 2 January 1799, the son of Richard Potter, from Westmorland, a corn merchant and afterwards a brewer in Manchester. He attended Manchester grammar school from 1811 to 1815, and later worked in a Manchester warehouse, but his business ventures were not particularly successful. However, in his leisure time he studied optics and chemistry, becoming a student of John Dalton. In the early 1830s he wrote several scientific papers, three of which he presented at the first meeting of the British Association in 1831. The interest generated by these contributions encouraged him to apply to Queens' College, Cambridge, which admitted him in 1834 and granted him a scholarship. In 1838 he graduated BA as sixth wrangler, and in January 1839 he was elected a foundation fellow of his college and obtained the medical scholarship, with the intention of studying medicine. He proceeded MA in 1841, being then a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, but did not practise medicine. Instead, in October of that year, he was appointed to the chair of natural philosophy and astronomy at University College, London. On 11 April 1843, at St Pancras Church, London, he married Mary Ann (<i>d</i>. 1871), daughter of Major Pilkington of Urney, King's county, Ireland. They had no children.<br>
<br>In the same year the college senate granted him leave to study mathematics in order to cope with the increasingly mathematized branches of physics. Having accepted a position at King's College, Toronto, he emigrated to Canada but returned to University College in 1844 due to an improved financial arrangement. He retained his professorship until 1865, but he was generally viewed as an incompetent teacher who could not control his students. Much of his research was on optics, but his work was often criticized by contemporaries who adopted the mathematically demanding wave theory of light and did not share his enthusiasm for the corpuscular theory. He published four books and over sixty papers, but made no significant contributions to science. Following his retirement in 1865 he moved to Cambridge where he died at his house, 10 Trumpington Road, on 6 June 1886.<br>
