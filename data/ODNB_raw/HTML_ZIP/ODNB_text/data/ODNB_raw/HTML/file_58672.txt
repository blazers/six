<span class="headword">Colman, Sir  Nigel Claudian Dalziel</span>, baronet  (1886&#150;1966), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Carlyle House, Chelsea Embankment, London, on 4 May 1886, the second son of Frederick Edward Colman, chairman of J. and J. Colman, and his wife, Helen, daughter of Davison Octavius Dalziel. He was thus born into a major industrial family, and was later a director both of Reckitt and Colman Holdings Ltd and of J. and J. Colman Ltd. He was brought up, though, in Surrey, and retained links with that county: he owned from 1950 a house near Reigate in addition to his main residence in Grosvenor Square, London. During the First World War he served initially in the Royal Navy: he started as an able seaman but was later commissioned, before transfer to the Royal Flying Corps, where he reached the rank of captain.<br>
<br>A lifelong Conservative where earlier members of the family had mainly been Liberals, Colman was politically active during the 1920s in London, and became Conservative member of the London county council for Brixton in 1925. Then a fortuitous by-election came up in Brixton when his uncle Sir Davison Dalziel, chairman of the International Sleeping Car Company, received a barony in the birthday honours of 1927. Following Dalziel's advice and no doubt anxious to continue with the family's generosity, the local party selected Colman, who proclaimed himself a staunch supporter of Baldwin and all his government's policies, including the unpopular <span class="roman">Trades Disputes Bill</span>. He was comfortably elected Brixton's MP, partly no doubt because the mere twenty-four days between Dalziel's peerage being announced and polling day left the other parties no time to establish any momentum. The <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> recommended a candidate who was &#145;young, handsome and dapper&#146;, and photographs show a trim figure who carried his forty years well  (20 June 1927).<br>
<br>Colman did not seek re-election to the London county council in 1928, but remained active in the Conservatives' London organization, serving on the area council from 1927 to 1965, and becoming at different times treasurer, chairman, and president. He remained Brixton's MP until the Labour landslide of 1945, but made little impact: in eighteen years he made few speeches and rarely asked questions, while outside election campaigns his activities were reported in <span class="italic">The Times</span> only half a dozen times. Loyalty and self-effacing support for his leaders and his party were the watchword. But lack of progress in parliament, where he achieved no ministerial appointment, was balanced by a steady increase in influence outside. He served on the party's national executive committee from 1934, and was chairman of the central council in 1939; he missed the chance to chair a party conference only because his turn came in 1943, when no conference was held. But he was elected to the chair of the national executive in 1945 and held that post until 1951, and so steered the party membership through the post-war Conservative recovery. He deserves to be seen, alongside Lord Woolton and David Maxwell-Fyfe, as an architect of that recovery, while his tenure of the chairman's office set a pattern by which unknown figures could exercise influence through continuity in office and the acquisition of expertise that came to match that of the paid officials.<br>
<br>After retirement from the national executive chair Colman received a baronetcy in January 1952, and on 30 July 1952 married Nona Ann, daughter of Edward Henry Miles Willan. They had no children, so the baronetcy became extinct when he died at their home, Flat 3, 49 Grosvenor Square, London, on 7 March 1966. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>Alongside but preceding his political career, Colman took a lifelong interest in horses and dogs. He was at various times president of the National Horse Association of Great Britain and of the Hackney Horse Society, chair of the British Horse Society, which awarded him its medal of honour in 1953, and a committee member for the Kennel Club. He devoted most of his spare time to breeding and exhibiting harness horses, and was a respected judge at horse shows.<br>
