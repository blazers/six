<span class="headword">Stroud,  John Anthony</span>  (1923&#150;1989), <span class="occ">social worker and author</span>, was born on 31 March 1923 at 51 St Philips Avenue, Maidstone, Kent, the son of Harry Richard Stroud, a Kent county council clerk, and his wife, Dorothy Mabel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Farley, a teacher who had been a suffragette. He was educated at Maidstone grammar school, which he left in 1941 to work as a clerk in the local education department. When a few months later he was called up he joined the RAF, but poor eyesight prevented him from becoming a fighter pilot and he spent most of the Second World War working on the newly invented radar to plot aircraft movements. Later in the war he served in India and Burma. His comfortable childhood had not prepared him for witnessing poverty and deprivation, particularly the terrible conditions that the Japanese occupation had visited upon the Burmese. In the words of Charles Maule, the author's alter ego and the social worker&#150;narrator of his novel <span class="italic">The Shorn Lamb</span> (1960), he vowed that he would &#145;leave the world a little better than when he came into it&#146;.<br>
<br>After the war Stroud originally planned to return to Burma, perhaps as a missionary. As he needed a qualification he went to Birmingham University to read for the diploma in social sciences, which he later gave up to take a degree. On 28 June 1949, while still a student, he married Elizabeth Ruth, a fellow student four years his junior (daughter of Alfred Ernest Edwards, master printer), who later became a social worker. They had two sons, Nick and Ian, and two daughters, Rosaline and Sylvia. Having given up his ambition to become a missionary and having rejected too a career in the colonial service, Stroud, enthused by the Curtis report, which had led to the creation of local authority children's departments in 1948, went to work after graduation as a children's welfare officer for Middlesex county council.<br>
<br>In 1952 Stroud moved to Hertfordshire as a boys' welfare officer, and in 1954 he helped to found the Association of Child Care Officers, which was to prove to be an influential body. He launched the organization's journal, <span class="italic">ACCORD</span>, which he ran for a decade. In 1971 he was appointed deputy children's officer for Hertfordshire. When the three branches of social work&#151;children's, welfare, and mental health&#151;were merged into the new social services departments, he was appointed assistant director of social services for Hertfordshire, a post he held until retirement in 1986. He remained, though, critical of the social services departments and of the kinds of people he believed were often attracted to work in them. His first marriage was dissolved in 1971 and on 8 June the following year he married Daphne Amy Pinkney, a 41-year-old secretary and daughter of Alexander Charles Balneaves, engineer. There were no children of this second marriage.<br>
<br>Stroud was unique in producing a series of novels on the themes he knew best: social work and hardship and the attempts to alleviate it. The first and most successful of these, <span class="italic">The Shorn Lamb</span>, was a Book Society choice and was serialized on the radio. For many years it had its admirers, but it may be that the regard in which it was held had more to do with its being the first (and still very rare) example of a social-work novel written by a social worker, rather than any intrinsic literary merit. In style it is sub-Dickensian. Characters with self-descriptive surnames, like Bland, O'Hooligan, and Dashforth, live in places like Rat Yard, or Blight Street. <span class="italic">The Waif</span> (1972) took as its theme the migration of poor children to the colonies, a practice that some charities had only stopped less than twenty years before the novel was published. He wrote fourteen books in all, including some non-fiction relating to his profession and, in 1971, <span class="italic">Thirteen Penny Stamps</span>, a history of the Church of England Children's Society.<br>
<br>Stroud's more lasting impact was in the work he carried out with adopted people. In his first post he had been astounded at how ignorant young people were about their origins when they had been separated from their families through being in care or having been adopted, but at the same time thought it important for them to know their roots. This developed into his lifelong interest in reuniting those separated from their families, something he continued to do even when a senior manager. He specialized in tracing twins separated at birth, which often meant many hours spent searching in archives, which was, as one obituarist stated, &#145;coupled with inspired guesswork&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 29 Sept 1989). This led not only to the happiness of those he reunited, some of whom had not hitherto known of each other's existence. It also made Stroud a pioneer of search and reunion in adoption, which was later to become commonplace. His work in this area was at a time when adoption was still seen to offer a child a fresh start, unencumbered by knowledge of a past best left unknown. His work was comparatively small-scale&#151;about fifty people were involved&#151;but some of these reunited twins took part in the work of the twins research department at the University of Minnesota (investigating the nature versus nurture debate), for which Stroud was a consultant. As the journalist Margaret Jervis wrote of him, he was &#145;the man who founded his own branch of social work&#146;  (<span class="italic">Social Work Today</span>, 2 Feb 1987).<br>
<br>Stroud was a curious admixture of compassion and cheerfulness, gloom and rudeness; unclubbable, yet liking applause. His writing absorbed him, often at the cost of family, and he was frustrated that his ambition to be a full-time writer eluded him. In 1987 he suffered a stroke that caused him to stay in hospital for eight months and made necessary the use of a wheelchair. However, despite his disability, his work continued and even a few months before his death he united a 96-year-old mother with her child of seventy-three. He died on 31 August 1989 of heart failure at his home, 8 Portland Place, Hertford Heath, Hertfordshire. He was survived by his wife, Daphne, and the four children of his first marriage.<br>
