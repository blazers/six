<span class="headword">Kelley <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Beadon]</span>,  Joanna Elizabeth</span>  (1910&#150;2003), <span class="occ">prison administrator</span>, was born on 23 May 1910 in Murree, a hill station in India, the younger daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel William Beadon (1867&#150;1916) of the 51st Sikhs and his wife, Joanna Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ballard (1870&#150;1958), a portrait painter, daughter of Lieutenant-General John Archibald Ballard and sister of Admiral George Alexander Ballard. Her paternal grandfather, Edward Musgrave Beadon, was also a general. Shortly before the outbreak of the First World War her mother returned to England with the children: her father was killed in action at Kut, in Mesopotamia, in 1916. Joanna Kelley grew up in Chelsea, London, and was educated at Hayes Court in Kent before going up to Girton College, Cambridge, in 1928 to read economics. She was awarded a lower second in part one of the tripos in 1930 and a third in part two in 1931. After moving to Paris she attended lectures at the Sorbonne and met Harper (Patrick) Kelley (1896/7&#150;1962), an archaeologist from Illinois, head of the department of prehistory at the Mus&eacute;e de l'Ethnographie. They married on 6 November 1934. For the next five years she worked with her husband as a curator at the museum, becoming an expert in the classification of Stone Age implements.<br>
<br>The Second World War broke out while Kelley was on holiday in England, and she worked as a youth club leader for the YWCA in the East End of London until the premises were destroyed by a bomb in 1942, when she moved to Bath as a welfare officer in the Admiralty. She had expected her husband, who had returned to America, to rejoin her after the war, and was deeply upset to learn that he was living with another woman and had no intention of returning. They were later divorced. By 1947 she was ready to leave the Admiralty, and with no clear idea of what she wanted to do next, took the advice of the Cambridge University appointments board and applied for a job with the prison service. She was appointed assistant governor of Holloway prison in London, the largest women's prison in the country. In 1952 she was appointed governor of Askham Grange open prison, opened in 1947 in a country house near York. There she developed a training course in domestic science to prepare the women in her charge to take up life outside again, and encouraged the prison staff to develop friendly relations with the prisoners: in Holloway inmates had not been allowed to speak to the staff unless spoken to. As she said in 1954, &#145;By far the majority of people here are not really criminal types at all. They are in prison because they were muddlers outside &hellip; We try to teach them how to cope&#146;  (Winn, 115). Her experience at Askham Grange convinced her that this approach was more likely to lead to the rehabilitation of a prisoner than punishing her by locking her up in a traditional prison.<br>
<br>From 1959 to 1966 Kelley was governor of Holloway, a forbidding Victorian fortress built in 1852 with a facade reputedly inspired by that of Warwick Castle and a layout modelled on Pentonville prison, with corridors of locked cells radiating out from a central desk. Within this grim building she attempted to transform Holloway from a punitive institution into a therapeutic community, believing that most women who broke the law were suffering from personality or psychiatric disorders, and needed treatment not punishment. She introduced group therapy in 1960 and counselling in 1963, while the recidivist wing became a psychotherapeutic unit.<br>
<br>In 1967 Kelley moved to the prison department of the Home Office as assistant director of prisons, in charge of women's prisons: &#145;I thought this was a wonderful opportunity &hellip; I shall spend my time getting Holloway changed and so I did&#146;  (Rock, 58). Having convinced her head of department, Kenneth Neale, that Holloway was &#145;an affront to civilisation&#146;, they set out their ideas in <span class="italic">Prison Policy: Women and Girls</span> (1968). This was accepted by the home secretary, James Callaghan, who announced in December 1968 that Holloway would be pulled down and rebuilt as a secure hospital. A member of the Holloway redevelopment project group, she was described by Neale as &#145;the powerhouse of the whole thing&#146;  (ibid., 57), while a former colleague later remembered, &#145;She was a Mrs Thatcher. She got all the work done&#146;  (ibid.). The new Holloway was designed as a large hospital with a small secure unit, with the women living in small units grouped round a &#145;village green&#146;, in an attempt to provide a more normal environment, with the emphasis on community life and minimal security. The prison officers were to become more like social workers. Although at first she was in favour of renaming it Holloway Hospital, she later wrote that she regretted the use of the word &#145;hospital&#146;: &#145;we really had in mind a place of healing, not only of the body but also of the mind and attitudes and education and practice in relationships&#146;  (ibid., 93). Demolition of the old buildings began in 1970, while the prison remained operational, but by the time Kelley retired in 1974 attitudes towards women in prison were changing: the numbers were increasing, there was more violent crime, and there was the new problem of women terrorists, including the Palestinian hijacker Leila Khaled, members of the Angry Brigade, and IRA bombers, leading to questioning of the view that all that women lawbreakers needed was psychiatric treatment. In the mid-1970s the design and purpose of the new institution were changed, with less emphasis on treatment and more on the containment of violent and disturbed prisoners, and by the time it was completed in 1985, it was no longer able to function according to Kelley's vision.<br>
<br>Kelley had always been a devout member of the Church of England, but in 1945 she found a deeper religious experience after meeting Brother Edward (Edward Bulstrode), a travelling preacher, at a retreat led by him. She later became involved in the work of the Village Evangelists, started by Brother Edward and Bishop Walter Carey in 1948 to spread the message of Christianity and prepare the way for the second coming. She was one of the many lay helpers who took part in missions to the parishes. As a prison governor she was sustained by her religious faith, though she later admitted that &#145;working in a place where there must be deep channels of evil, it is easy sometimes to be carried away completely by moods of bitterness and black depression&#146;  (Kelley, <span class="italic">When the Gates Shut</span>, 170). In 1965 she helped to found the Teilhard de Chardin Association, and in retirement she remained in London and joined the congregation of St Michael, Chester Square, and later that of St James-the-Less, Vauxhall Bridge Road, an evangelical and charismatic church. She was a member of the council of St George's House, Windsor, from 1971 to 1977, of the Redundant Churches Committee from 1974 to 1979, and of the Scott Holland Trust from 1978 to 1986.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">When the Gates Shut</span> was published in 1967, followed by <span class="italic">Who Casts the First Stone? A New Look at Crime and Punishment</span> (1978). She also wrote but did not publish a life of Brother Edward, &#145;The White Hyacinth&#146; (1978), and collected material for a history of Holloway prison. She loved poetry, especially that of T. S. Eliot, and organized poetry readings in her house in Pimlico. She also travelled widely. She was appointed OBE in 1973. She died on 12 April 2003 at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, following a stroke, and was cremated on 28 April at Hammersmith crematorium. She had no children.<br>
