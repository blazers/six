<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cohen, Sir  Robert  Waley</span>  (1877&#150;1952), <span class="occ">oil industrialist</span>, was born in London on 8 September 1877, the second son of Nathaniel Louis Cohen, a leading figure in the City, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55565/', "Julia Matilda Cohen (1853&#150;1917)")</script>, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28458/', "Jacob Waley (1818&#150;1873)")</script>. A sister of Robert, Dorothea [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74093/', "Singer, Dorothea Waley")</script>], married Charles Singer, the historian of medicine and science. The family, who had long been leaders of the Anglo-Jewish community with connections extending from Sir Moses Montefiore to the Rothschilds, traced its origins back to the Netherlands in the seventeenth century. Educated at Clifton College, in the Jewish house, Waley Cohen early showed an interest in chemistry and mathematics. With a science scholarship he proceeded to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he obtained second classes in both parts of the natural sciences tripos in 1898 and 1900, with an interlude of a year for a trip round the world. A period in Berlin, between school and university, confirmed his attachment to music and science. One of the leading amateur cellists in the country, he played in the same quartet for forty years.<br>
<br>Although wealthy, the family believed that everyone should be profitably engaged. After Cambridge, Waley Cohen worked unpaid on research in the Meteorological Office, working under W. N. Shaw, his former tutor and secretary to the Meteorological Office. Aroused by family reproaches and helped by his future wife, he then drafted an advertisement seeking industrial employment. Henri Deterding of the Royal Dutch oil company sent the sole reply, but meanwhile his father had spoken to Sir Marcus Samuel (later Viscount Bearsted), chairman of the Shell Transport and Trading Company. In July 1901 Waley Cohen began work for Shell, reporting directly to Marcus Samuel, and within three months he was given permission to sign company documents. In 1902 Shell and Royal Dutch joined forces against their rival, the Standard Oil Company. While maintaining their autonomy as separate companies, in 1903 they formed a new concern, the Asiatic Petroleum Company, to market oil produced by both parent companies. Deterding of Royal Dutch became managing director of Asiatic, with Waley Cohen as assistant manager at an annual salary of &pound;1000.<br>
<br>In 1904 Waley Cohen married his kinswoman, Alice Violet (1882&#150;1935), daughter of Henry Edward Beddington, and in the same year he was sent on his first overseas assignment with the Asiatic to examine marketing strategy in India. In 1905 he returned to London and in 1906 was appointed to the boards of Shell Transport and Trading Company and the Asiatic. By this time Shell was in such a weak position that it was forced to discuss amalgamation with Royal Dutch. Waley Cohen negotiated on Shell's behalf with the three Royal Dutch directors. Under the amalgamation two new companies were established: the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company and the Baatafsche Petroleum Maatschappij. Royal Dutch owned 60 per cent of the shares and Shell Transport and Trading owned 40 per cent. The Royal Dutch directors had been so impressed by Waley Cohen that it was they and not Shell who nominated him to the Anglo-Saxon board. He also served on the Baatafsche board until he was forced to resign in 1909 owing to changes in Dutch law.<br>
<br>Waley Cohen's early career proved his ability and integrity as a negotiator&#151;a talent which he was to put to considerable use for the rest of his career. In 1908 he began negotiations with the Egyptian government concerning exploration rights, leases for concessions, and the building of a refinery at Suez. When oil was discovered in commercial volumes there, he became a director of Anglo-Egyptian Oilfields (a Shell company). In 1910 he negotiated to purchase the Shanghai-Langkat oil company in the Far East, greatly expanding Shell's influence in that area of the world.<br>
<br>Also of great benefit to his management of Shell's interests was Waley Cohen's scientific background. In dealing with oil from Borneo, for the first time in the oil industry he had petroleum subjected to scientific analysis, and discovered that what was considered an inferior product had 350 chemical compounds in a single distillate, including toluol, the essential element in TNT. The Admiralty rejected the idea of making use of this process, but a factory was consequently erected in Rotterdam. When the explosives position presented perilous shortages during the First World War, Waley Cohen organized the transport of the complete factory to the United Kingdom. Samuel had made an early attempt to persuade conservative naval experts to transfer from coal to oil. When war came Shell's management ensured that, notwithstanding damage to the company's prosperity, its great and widely distributed oil resources were at the country's disposal. Waley Cohen negotiated with the Admiralty for the chartering of Shell vessels and the supply of oil. The arrangement included a plan by Zulver, Shell's marine superintendent, to carry oil in the double bottoms of vessels. Waley Cohen was also appointed petroleum adviser to the army council; he went to the USA in 1917 to talk to the government and Standard Oil and made numerous journeys to France to examine petroleum supplies. He was appointed KBE in 1920, in recognition of his work during the war.<br>
<br>In 1924 it was decided that Waley Cohen should visit Shell's marketing organizations around the world, taking in the Middle East, the Far East, and the USA. He concluded that the company's greatest strength was its staff, most of whom he had originally selected to work for Shell. Throughout recruitment, he had interviewed graduate scientists, for whom he saw a great need in the developing oil industry. Many came to Shell through the Cambridge University appointments board, with which Waley Cohen had been involved since 1910. In 1928 he retired from day-to-day management at Shell, but not before realizing his ambition to open a Shell research laboratory, at Emeryville in California, and thus provide for proper scientific research in the oil industry.<br>
<br>In 1928 Waley Cohen purchased the Exmoor estate of Honeymead, and seemed to be moving towards semi-retirement. However in 1929 he accepted the chairmanship of African and Eastern, an independent concern operating in west Africa with heavy losses. The rival Niger Company, bought by Lord Leverhulme in 1920 and reorganized by D'Arcy Cooper, was also operating at a huge loss. Waley Cohen worked for amalgamation from the first, and the United Africa Company was formed in 1929. In the event, he failed to achieve the success which he had attained in the oil world, and he resigned in 1931.<br>
<br>Voluntary and charitable activities played a major role in Waley Cohen's life. He was the acknowledged head of Anglo-Jewry and played a leading role in the affairs of the Jewish community in Britain. For nearly forty years he was the chief figure of the United Synagogue and died in office as its president. He helped to found the Council for Christians and Jews, and played a prominent part in its activities. Opposed to Zionism, he nevertheless helped to create the Palestine Corporation (which contributed greatly to the establishment of the state of Israel). Waley Cohen continued to support the educational institutions which he had attended, and he was involved in the Sir William Ramsay centenary appeal at University College, London.<br>
<br>Of great stature and strong features, Waley Cohen was a formidable person. He and his wife had two sons and one daughter, but their marriage ended tragically when his wife died as a result of a motor accident in Palestine in 1935, in which Waley Cohen himself was seriously injured. Their elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50496/', "Bernard Waley-Cohen")</script>, followed the tradition of social service and at an early age became lord mayor of London. Sir Robert Waley Cohen died of heart disease at his London home, Southampton Lodge, Fitzroy Park, on 27 November 1952.<br>
