<span class="headword">Ashton, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1403&#150;<em>c.</em>1460), <span class="occ">alchemist</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/773/', "Sir John Ashton (d. 1427)")</script> of Ashton under Lyne, Lancashire, and his first wife, Jane Saville. His half-brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/776/', "Sir Ralph Ashton")</script>. Sir John's career in public office and the service of the house of Lancaster culminated in his stewardship of the duchy lands in Lancashire and Cheshire between 1425 and his death in 1428. Although Thomas had been knighted by 1434, he showed no taste for any such career in administration. In 1442 he was granted a formal exemption from appointment to crown offices. Personal preference may therefore help to explain Thomas's enthusiasm for alchemy, but financial exigencies may also have played a part. John Ashton left Thomas his Lancashire estates at Ashton, Wardle, and Manchester, but passed his Yorkshire estates to the infant son of his second marriage. Thomas clearly resented this settlement, as, within eighteen months of his father's death, he had kidnapped this half-brother, also called John, who was then at Ashton. The result was a lawsuit in chancery, the outcome of which is unknown.<br>
<br>Despite these difficulties Ashton maintained contacts with figures close to the crown, which helps to explain the licence to practise alchemy (which had been prohibited since the reign of Henry IV) granted to himself and Sir Edmund Trafford on 7 April 1446. Sir Thomas married Elizabeth, the daughter of Sir John Byron and Margery Booth, a relative of William Booth, bishop of Coventry and Lichfield (<i>d</i>. 1464). Ashton's co-grantee, Trafford, who had been knighted for his service to the crown at the battle of Verneuil in 1424 and who married Ashton's daughter Dulcie, was also related to the Booths. In 1446 when the licence to practise without molestation by any of the king's subjects was issued, the Booths, supported by Sir John Byron, were involved in a violent dispute with opponents among the Lancashire clergy. The licence may therefore have been granted at the instance of the Booths. The suggestion of an initiative so close to the crown is all the more plausible since this licence can be interpreted as the first sign of the interest in alchemy on the part of Henry VI's government which in 1456&#150;7 culminated in a systematic inquiry into its potential as a source of revenue. On the other hand, a local tradition, dating back as far as the mid-seventeenth century, claimed that one of the two knights had transmuted part of the base of an iron pot into gold and sent it to the king.<br>
<br>Whether Ashton or his partner in the licence practised alchemy in person, or whether they engaged servants (who were also covered by the licence), is uncertain. However, Ashton's involvement in alchemy clearly reflects the spread, during the fifteenth century, of alchemical knowledge and manuscripts from the monasteries into secular society. Sir Thomas was almost certainly dead by 1460, when his son and heir, John, was knighted by Henry VI before the battle of Northampton. Following the deposition of Henry VI, John Ashton rapidly made his peace with Edward IV.<br>
