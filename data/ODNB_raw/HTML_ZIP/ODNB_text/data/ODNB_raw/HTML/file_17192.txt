<span class="headword">Lundie,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1600), <span class="occ">poet</span>, is of unknown parentage. He was admitted to King's College, Aberdeen, in 1618, proceeded AM in 1622, and was elected a regent in 1626. Having become humanist in 1629, he was advanced in 1631 to the title of &#145;professor of humanity in the university of Aberdeen&#146;, though, says Gordon, he was &#145;raither maister of the grammar scoole&#146;  (Gordon, 1.154). On 16 November 1640 he was chosen dean of the faculty of philosophy. On 12 July 1647, at Gordon's Mill, he married Margaret Gordon.<br>
<br>In contrast to the general opposition to the national covenant in Aberdeen, Lundie secretly subscribed it in July 1638 and refused the king's covenant in October. He was chosen to represent his university at the general assembly at Glasgow in November of that year: his commission extended to little more than reporting news to his superiors in Aberdeen, but the moderator, Alexander Henderson, got wind that he was a covenanter and granted him a voice. On 15 December Lundie asked the assembly to send a committee of visitors to Aberdeen on the grounds that the bishop was unlawfully taking up rents. Lundie returned to Aberdeen and subscribed the king's covenant on 14 January 1639. In the following month he was accused of having exceeded his powers by the Aberdeen authorities, to whom he pleaded guilty. There is, however, a suggestion that Lundie's petition had been engineered by the covenanters to furnish them with a pretext for sending arms against the marquess of Huntly  (Gordon, 3.224&#150;5).<br>
<br>Besides his &#145;Oratio eucharistica et encomiastica&#146;, which was delivered on 27 July 1631 (Marischal College Library, Aberdeen), on the occasion of a gift to the university from Dr Alexander Read, Lundie wrote the dedicatory poem prefixed to Bishop Patrick Forbes's <span class="italic">Funerals</span>. The other verses from his pen contained within this volume (pp. 370, 414) are reproduced in the largest collection of his work, which is appended to the Abbotsford Club's edition of <span class="italic">A Garden of Grave and Godlie Flowers</span> (1845) by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10380/', "Alexander Garden")</script>, who was probably Lundie's brother-in-law. Lundie's miscellaneous verses rarely sparkle and, while they have potential for grace and light-heartedness, they are too often weighed down by an overpowering use of classical allusion. Some show feeling, such as his Latin elegiacs on the death of his son (p. 29), but even these are marred by the admission of a false quantity. Several of the poems are addressed to Garden and to David Leech. Lundie is also supposed to have written in Latin the &#145;Comedy of the twelve patriarchs&#146; (preface to Garden's <span class="italic">Garden</span>, xvi).<br>
<br>Lundie was a baillie for the town of Aberdeen and is recorded in council minutes until 1655. He was predeceased by his son, John, but survived by his wife.<br>
