<span class="headword">Harlow,  Vincent Todd</span>  (1898&#150;1961), <span class="occ">historian and constitutional adviser</span>, was born at 17 Alexandra Place, Newcastle, on 14 August 1898, the elder son of Vincent Harlow (1868&#150;1930), a master builder who became a Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Esther Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Todd (<i>c</i>.1871&#150;1957). He went to Durham School, from which he was called up in March 1917. Commissioned in the Royal Field Artillery, he was mentioned in dispatches for service in France. After demobilization in January 1919 he read modern history at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he took a second in 1921, followed by research for the BLitt. He taught at University College, Southampton, from 1923 until returning to Oxford in 1928 as keeper of the new Rhodes House library, for which he devised a subject catalogue unique in the Bodleian Library's dependent libraries of the day. He was Beit lecturer in colonial history, 1930&#150;35, then lecturer in British empire history, 1935&#150;8, and simultaneously director of studies for the Oxford Commonwealth group. He married on 14 August 1924 Margretta Badcock, daughter of Joshua Cory Badcock, gentleman, of Yarm, Yorkshire. They made their home in Old Marston, where Harlow served St Nicholas's Church as churchwarden and lay reader. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Succeeding A. P. Newton as Rhodes professor of imperial history at King's College, London, in 1938, Harlow spent the Second World War with the empire division of the Ministry of Information. In 1948 he returned to Oxford as Beit professor of the history of the British empire and a fellow of Balliol College. During the years 1950&#150;51 he was called on to act as a constitutional adviser three times. Along with Margery Perham of Nuffield College he was a member of the Colonial Office's secret smaller territories inquiry, which considered the future of twenty-one small dependencies and concluded that most of them could never be independent. He also proposed a single Ministry for Commonwealth Affairs. He was a member of the British Guiana Constitutional Commission (1950&#150;51), and he advised the Constitutional Amendment Commission for Sudan (1951&#150;2). For both these countries he recommended the safeguard of a second chamber. He was appointed CMG in 1952.<br>
<br>Harlow's contributions to Commonwealth history came in three distinct phases. First, from his postgraduate and Southampton years, came seven books on the origins of empire in the Caribbean. In this work he frequently drew links with contemporary issues. Thus Barbadian assertions of self-government in the 1650s were compared with later dominion status. Second, he found continuity in imperial development before and after the American War of Independence. In &#145;The new imperial system, 1783&#150;1815&#146;, published in volume 2 of the <span class="italic">Cambridge History of the British Empire</span> in 1940, he stressed the experimental nature of British responses to the American secession, especially in Ireland. An offer of equal legislative autonomy under the crown, combined with trade reciprocity, a contribution to imperial defence, and acceptance of imperial control of external affairs (as offered to the Americans in 1778) was put to the Irish in the 1780s. The scheme was never fully implemented, but Ireland had come &#145;near to being the first Dominion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cambridge History of the British Empire</span>, 2.134). In response to these failures the government sought strong local executives to pursue &#145;vigorous paternalism&#146; in Canada, India, the Cape, Mauritius, Ceylon, Malta, and the Ionian Islands. The crown colony system became a &#145;form of tutelage&#146;, that could lead &#145;by ascending gradations to an ultimate self-determination&#146;  (ibid., 136, 187).<br>
<br>Expanding these themes in his two-volume magnum opus <span class="italic">The Founding of the Second British Empire, 1763&#150;1783</span> (1952&#150;64), Harlow rejected a chronological break between &#145;first&#146; and &#145;second&#146; empires at the American War of Independence. He depicted a &#145;swing to the East&#146; in imperial aspirations after 1763 as Britain sought new markets in the Far East and the Pacific. The second empire &#145;was not, in fact, an empire in the normal sense&#146;. The ideal was &#145;a chain of trading ports, protected at strategic points by naval bases&#146;  (<span class="italic">Second British Empire</span>, 1.41). Paradoxically, dreams of trading relations with independent states drew Britain into administering vast new territories. Harlow's &#145;swing to the East&#146; remains a most suggestive concept. If it has not stood the test of time in detailed studies, Harlow has been seen as a pioneer in the study of &#145;informal empire&#146;  (Robinson, 45). Frederick Madden, a successor as Beit lecturer, regarded this book as &#145;the most substantial piece of scholarship to appear from Oxford imperial historians in the [twentieth] century&#146;  (Madden, 19).<br>
<br>Third, Harlow was concerned with definition of the subject and advocacy of the Commonwealth. Distinguished visitors addressing the Ralegh Club gave students a &#145;ringside seat&#146; for viewing Commonwealth evolution and taught Harlow more about the Commonwealth, so he recalled, than any other single source  (V. T. Harlow, <span class="italic">The Historian and British Colonial History</span>, 1951, 4). This interest gained greater focus in his London years with wartime work at the Ministry of Information. Harlow contributed to weekly newsletters on current issues and later produced three popular pamphlets describing the background and purposes of the post-war empire Commonwealth. At a more serious level he sought to define the subject. His inaugural lecture at King's College, London, in March 1939, and his Beit inaugural lecture at Oxford in November 1950, gave him opportunities to present the view that empire provided the ultimate test of a nation's values. Imperialism, he argued, was &#145;an expression of the dynamic qualities in human nature &hellip; It can be the most terrible scourge: contrariwise, it can provide a fruitful field of experiment in the difficult art of inter-racial co-operation&#146;  (V. T. Harlow, <span class="italic">The Character of British Imperialism</span>, 1939, 7). He saw its practice as &#145;the supreme test of a nation's quality: it is a fearful and searching ordeal&#146; that always carried the seeds of its own destruction  (ibid., 35). To study this phenomenon meant investigating &#145;the projection of a civilization in all its splendour and all its squalor and &hellip; the resulting reaction between communities involved a slow but inexorable testing of its moral worth&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Historian and British Colonial History</span>, 23).<br>
<br>At Oxford Harlow revived weekly Commonwealth seminars, where his deeply serious, Christian approach to the subject was evident. He stood five foot seven, and was remembered as an attractive lecturer, but as having a somewhat austere and patronizing manner. Graduates from the dominions who came to gain doctorates were impatient when he delayed letting them upgrade from BLitt enrolment, and some questioned his judgements on the scholarly potential of candidates. In faculty debates he fought hard for his corner, but was sometimes found inconsistent in his viewpoints. He suffered a heart attack on 6 December 1961 at Gloucester Green, Oxford, in his car, <i>en route</i> to the Friday Commonwealth seminar, and was pronounced dead on arrival at the Radcliffe Infirmary. He was survived by his wife, Margretta.<br>
