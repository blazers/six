<span class="headword">Bland,  Tobias</span>  (<em>c.</em>1563&#150;1605), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, matriculated sizar from Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1575 and proceeded BA in 1581, in which year he migrated to Corpus Christi College. Accused of publishing a satirical libel against the master of the college, Robert Norgate, which began &#145;In the name of the father, the sonn, and the old wiffe&#146; and was set out in the form of a catechism, he admitted the offence and was ordered to sit in the stocks. Norgate became vice-chancellor soon after, so that Bland's reputation in Cambridge remained questionable; a petition to the university chancellor, Lord Burghley, signed by fifty members of senate, unsuccessfully attempted to prevent Bland's progression to MA in 1584. By this date he had been ordained deacon and he proceeded to priest's orders at Lincoln in December 1585.<br>
<br>Bland's early clerical career remains obscure, but by 1589 he had come under the patronage of Lord St John of Bletso, whose chaplain he was and to whom he dedicated <span class="italic">A Baite for Momus</span>, a sermon on <span class="roman">1 Timothy</span>, 4: 1&#150;2 delivered at Bedford and published in that year. The sermon appears to have aroused some controversy among the clergy of the area but is not notably partisan, though in it Bland refers to another, longer, work, apparently not published, which may have set out more contentious views. Through the influence of his patron he became, in 1589, rector of Ripton Abbots, Huntingdonshire, an office he held jointly with the mastership of St John's Hospital, Huntingdon, from 1599 until his death.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Bland had also recovered his reputation at Cambridge, moving to Magdalene College and taking his BD in 1591, and a promising career beckoned on his appointment as sub-almoner to Queen Elizabeth in 1594. He was subsequently rector of the valuable Northamptonshire living of Brington from 1599 to 1601 before being collated to the first prebendal stall at Peterborough Cathedral on 29 October 1602. He died early in 1605 and was buried at St Sepulchre's, Cambridge, on 4 April that year.<br>
