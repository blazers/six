<span class="headword">Yong,  Bartholomew</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1560, <em>d.</em> 1612), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was baptized on 24 August 1560 at St Peter, Cornhill, London, the son of the Gregory (not George, as in some records) Yong (<i>d</i>. 1610) from Bedale, Yorkshire, a grocer, and his first wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1563). He had three younger sisters, three half-brothers and three half-sisters. The family was Roman Catholic but conformed outwardly to the Elizabethan religious settlement. Bartholomew is first heard of going to Spain in 1578 with Richard Parker, the son of his father's second wife, Susan, and her first husband. Their return to England through France in May 1580 was reported to Walsingham by the ambassador to France, Sir Henry Cobham, who wrote that Bartholomew had &#145;had conference with the Duchess of Feria, being recommended by a privy token from his uncle&#146;  (Cooper, <span class="italic">Ath. Cantab.</span>, 1.428). The authorities had ample reason to be suspicious: the uncle was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30267/', "Dr John Young (1514&#150;1581/2)")</script>, a noted recusant, and the duchess was Jane Dormer, who worked tirelessly for the reversal of the Reformation in Britain. But Yong and Parker were not apprehended on their return.<br>
<br>Yong then entered the New Inn, London, and won a reputation for skill in French and Spanish by taking part in the plays staged there. He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 19 May 1582. There he became a close friend of Edward Banister, a well-known recusant and patron of the arts, who later mentioned him in his will. Banister urged him to translate Jorge de Montemayor's pastoral, <span class="italic">Diana</span>, which had already been influential in its original Spanish. This he did in 1582&#150;3, adding the continuations by Alonzo Perez and Gaspar del Polo. It is a competent and lively version, despite some clumsiness in the prose. His next translation was <span class="italic">The Civile Conversation of M. Stephen Guazzo</span> (1586), an influential manual for the educated person who sought to learn Italian manners and social skills. Yong's English version of Guazzo ranks in importance with <span class="italic">The Courtyer</span> and <span class="italic">Galateo</span>. It is supposed to have provided models for conversations in Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span>  (Harrison, 135). Encouraged by the success of <span class="italic">Diana</span>, in 1587 Yong translated Boccaccio's warning on the dangers of unwisely falling in love, as <span class="italic">Amorous Fiametta</span>.<br>
<br>Yong lived in Shire Lane in Temple Bar, a street which disappeared in the mid-nineteenth century to make way for the new law courts. Because of his carelessness with money his father paid him much more &#145;then I have given or bestowed amongst all the rest of my children&#146;  (Harrison, 136) and left him out of the deeds of 1595 and 1597 settling the succession of his property at High Ongar, Essex, and his London house. Little else is known of Yong's circumstances. He was not married, nor did he practise law, nor had he entered his father's business, but he did speculate in land. The most important of these transactions occurred on 7 April 1595, when Bartholomew made over the manor of Chivers in Ongar to Thomas Southwell, John Darcy, Anthony Ashe, and two of Banister's cousins, Robert Awdeley and John Drury. The deed, probably a mortgage designed to raise money, could be voided by the payment of &#145;any peeces of golde or silver to the value of five shillings or more at or upon the Fontstone of the Temple Church&#146;  (Yong, lxiii). In 1598 <span class="italic">Diana</span> was finally published with a dedication dated from High Ongar to Lady Penelope Rich (Sir Philip Sidney's &#145;Stella&#146;). Yong died intestate in September 1612 and was buried at St Dunstan-in-the-West, London, on 28 September. The administration of his estate was granted to Alexander Holman, the third son of Yong's sister, Jane. On 30 October 1612 Holman went to the Temple Church with 5<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. to reclaim Chivers according to the 1595 agreement, but nobody came to claim the fee.<br>
