<span class="headword">&Agrave; Beckett,  Arthur William</span>  (1844&#150;1909), <span class="occ">humorist and journalist</span>, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26/', "Gilbert Abbott &#192; Beckett (1811&#150;1856)")</script> and Mary Anne Glossop (1817&#150;1863), was born at Portland House, North End, Fulham, on 25 October 1844. He was educated at Honiton, then at Felsted School (1858&#150;9). His eldest brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27/', "Gilbert Arthur &#192; Beckett (1837&#150;1891)")</script>. Like so many contemporary journalists, including both his brothers, his first journalism was in part supported by a clerkship, in Arthur's case, at the War Office. From there he migrated to the Post Office, but left the civil service altogether after only three years in 1865. Journalism was always his first vocation, but at various times he took other employment. From 1871 to 1874 he was private secretary to the fifteenth duke of Norfolk. He resigned in the same year that he, like his close friend, Francis Cowley Burnand, converted to Roman Catholicism. In 1877 he joined Gray's Inn and was called to the bar in 1882, but never practised; in 1887, however, he served as Master of the Revels at his inn of court.<br>
<br>From 1865 to 1868 &Agrave; Beckett assisted Burnand with a penny evening humorous paper, the <span class="italic">Glow-Worm</span>; and from 1868 to 1870 edited the magazine <span class="italic">Britannia</span>. Although he did not consider it important at the time, his most significant editorship was of the short-lived weekly <span class="italic">Tomahawk</span>, which combined satire, informed rumour, and social intelligence. It owed something to contemporary Parisian models, but was designed for a very specific English readership. <span class="italic">Tomahawk</span> was the inspiration for and progenitor of Gibson Bowles's later enormously successful <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span>. A prolific, facile writer, &Agrave; Beckett engaged tirelessly, but with little distinction, in a multitude of literary tasks. He was by turn, and often simultaneously, novelist, dramatist, versifier, humorist, and editor. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870&#150;71 he acted as special correspondent to the <span class="italic">Globe</span> and the <span class="italic">Standard</span>. This experience kindled an enthusiasm for &#145;amateur soldiering&#146; which he indulged as a militia captain commanding a company of the 4th battalion of the Cheshire regiment. He also edited the <span class="italic">Naval and Military Magazine</span>, a short-lived journal published between 1897 and 1899.<br>
<br>&Agrave; Beckett's longest, most significant, literary connection was with <span class="italic">Punch</span>. The title of one of his volumes of recollections, <span class="italic">The &Agrave; Becketts of Punch</span> (1903), reveals that he thought of the magazine almost as a family property. He claimed, incorrectly, that his father was one of its founders. To his chagrin his earliest contributions to <span class="italic">Punch</span> were refused. But in May 1874 he was asked to contribute, and in August of the following year he was made a member of the staff. <span class="italic">Punch</span> never had a more ardent devotee. In 1880 Burnand became editor and, after a short, initial period of reforming activity, he appointed &Agrave; Beckett as his deputy. Known by everyone in the literary world, popular, cheerful, self-assured, and careless, &Agrave; Beckett presided over <span class="italic">Punch</span>'s decline into decrepitude. He would have nothing changed; all new blood was excluded. What at first had been gay, spontaneous, novel, became by repetition dull, predictable, and mechanical. Eventually, in 1902, the long-suffering proprietors were obliged to act: &Agrave; Beckett, confidently expecting to be made editor, was instead asked to resign. His amazement, outrage, wounded ambition, and injured pride at this unexpected outcome were thoroughly indulged in a rambling, autobiographical fragment, <span class="italic">Recollections of a Humorist</span> (1907).<br>
<br>From 1893 to 1895 &Agrave; Beckett also served as working editor of the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>. With such a double burden, even his irrepressible energy could guarantee neither accuracy nor originality. Yet egotism and na&iuml;vety were so balanced in his character that he could as little appreciate his faulty work at the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, or understand why Cardinal Manning was not anxious to purchase a loss-making sporting sheet on his recommendation, as comprehend why he had been dismissed from <span class="italic">Punch</span>. He had little real talent as a journalist. His geniality, abundant charm, and kindliness best explain how he managed for so many years to keep a number of demanding and important jobs. He was a good committee man, serving the Society of Authors from 1891 until 1903, and was an office holder and president of the Newspaper Society (1893&#150;4) and the Institute of Journalists (1900&#150;01).<br>
<br>On 17 February 1876, &Agrave; Beckett married Susannah Frances, only daughter of Forbes Winslow MD; they had two sons. Susannah was an occasional contributor to various magazines, and a vice-president of the Society of Women Journalists. &Agrave; Beckett died of post-operative shock on 14 January 1909, after the amputation of a leg; he was buried in Mortlake Catholic cemetery.<br>
