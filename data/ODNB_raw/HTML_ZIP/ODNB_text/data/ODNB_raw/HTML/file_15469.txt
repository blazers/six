<span class="headword">Kerr,  William</span>, second marquess of Lothian  (<em>bap. </em>1661, <em>d.</em> 1722), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was baptized at Newbattle, Edinburghshire, on 27 March 1661, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15465/', "Robert Kerr, fourth earl and first marquess of Lothian (1636&#150;1703)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Jean Campbell (<i>d</i>. 1700), daughter of Archibald Campbell, marquess of Argyll. Nothing is known of his early years and education, but on 30 June 1685 he was contracted to marry his cousin Lady Jean Campbell (<i>c</i>.1661&#150;1712), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4473/', "Archibald Campbell, ninth earl of Argyll")</script>. They had a son and four daughters. Not surprisingly given his Campbell connection, Kerr was a zealous promoter of the revolution of 1688. In 1692 he succeeded as fifth Lord Jedburgh by virtue of a contract made in 1669 between his grandfather William Kerr, third earl of Lothian, and Robert Kerr, second Lord Jedburgh. In the Scottish parliament he was an adherent of the court, as was his brother-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4474/', "Archibald Campbell, tenth earl and first duke of Argyll")</script>. He combined politics with a military career, becoming colonel of the 7th dragoons on 1 October 1696. He became a brigadier-general in 1702. He succeeded his father on 15 February 1703, and was promoted major-general on 1 January 1704.<br>
<br>Lothian was now a political associate of his nephew John Campbell, second duke of Argyll, who was appointed commissioner for the session of the Scottish parliament in 1705. It was owing to Argyll's influence that Lothian received a promise from Queen Anne to be made a knight of the Thistle. Lothian proposed on 31 July 1705 a first reading for the bill setting in motion a treaty of union. After the session on 30 October 1705 he received his &#145;green ribbon&#146;. Thereafter his fortunes tended to follow those of Argyll, and when Argyll was outmanoeuvred by James Douglas, second duke of Queensberry, Lothian was left out of the commission to negotiate a union with England. He was also disappointed in his attempt to succeed General George Ramsay as commander-in-chief in Scotland and had to wait until 25 April 1707 for the colonelcy of the foot guards which he had coveted for over a year. However, with Argyll back in favour by October 1706 and James Ogilvy, earl of Seafield, writing on 7 November 1706 that &#145;the Duke of Argyll influences the M. of Lothian and his own friends&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters Relating to Scotland</span>, 101), Lothian supported the union in 1706, voting for the first article on 4 November 1706 and for ratification on 16 January 1707. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 1 January 1707. At Argyll's behest Lothian was chosen a Scottish representative peer in 1707 and again in 1708, but was unseated in February 1709 following a series of petitions objecting to the votes of some peers. John Macky described Lothian when aged about forty-five as &#145;very handsome; black, with a fine eye&#146;, and having &#145;abundance of fire and may prove a man of business when he applies himself that way; laughs at all revealed religion, yet sets up for a pillar of presbytery&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>). A few years later Daniel Defoe thought Lothian had &#145;made himself odious by scandalous vices and immoralities, and sordid covetousness&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Following Argyll's decision to switch to the tories in 1710, Lothian appears to have assisted the tories in the 1710 election. He certainly felt able to solicit a British peerage from Robert Harley, first earl of Oxford, in June 1711 and was still asking for instructions on elections from Oxford in 1713. He ceased to be colonel of the Scots guards in 1713, and no doubt followed Argyll into opposition in early 1714. The ineligibility of Scottish peers to sit in the Lords under new British titles clearly rankled and he signed a petition to George I on the subject in November 1714. Back in favour under the new dynasty, in 1715 Lothian was elected a Scottish representative peer. He died in London on 28 February 1722 and was buried on 6 March in Westminster Abbey. His wife had died on 31 July 1712. He was succeeded by his son, William.<br>
