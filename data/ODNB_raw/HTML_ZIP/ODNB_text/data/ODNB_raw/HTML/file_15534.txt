<span class="headword">Killigrew,  Henry</span>  (1613&#150;1700), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 11 February 1613 at the manor of Hanworth, near Hampton Court, the fifth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15537/', "Sir Robert Killigrew (1579/80&#150;1633)")</script>, vice-chamberlain to Queen Henrietta Maria, and Mary, daughter of Sir Henry Woodhouse of Kimberley, Norfolk. The brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15541/', "Sir William Killigrew (bap. 1606, d. 1695)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15538/', "Thomas Killigrew (1612&#150;1683)")</script>, both dramatists, Killigrew was educated at Thomas Farnaby's Grammar School in the parish of Cripplegate, presumably from about 1620. He is first mentioned in the will of his grandmother Margaret Killigrew, dated 22 May 1623: to Henry and his brothers Charles, Robert, and Thomas she left the sum of &pound;5, &#145;to be paid within three months after my decease&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/146/71). Killigrew entered Christ Church, Oxford, as a commoner in 1628, and soon afterwards became a student. While at Oxford he contributed Latin poems to several collections of occasional verse, including <span class="italic">Britanniae natalis</span> (1630), celebrating the birth of Prince Charles. After having obtained his BA degree on 5 July 1632, Killigrew became one of the quadragesimal collectors, involved in the determination exercises in Lent. Sir Robert, in his will dated 12 September 1632, bequeathed to him &#145;the market and fairs within the manor and lordship of Crediton, co. Devons.&#146;, with all the rents, issues and profits from the same, for a period of seventy years  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/164/69).<br>
<br>Killigrew's literary talent soon manifested itself in <span class="italic">The Conspiracy</span>, a tragedy intended to be produced at the wedding, on 8 January 1635, of Charles Herbert, son of the earl of Pembroke, and Mary Villiers, daughter of the duke of Buckingham. The play was surreptitiously published in 1638, its text having been printed, as the corrected 1653 edition entitled <span class="italic">Pallantus and Eudora</span> explained, &#145;from a false and imperfect transcript, the original copy being then (together with the writer of it) in Italy&#146;  (&#145;The publisher to the reader&#146;). In July 1638 Killigrew was created MA, travelled abroad, and, &#145;entering afterwards into the sacred function&#146;, towards the beginning of the civil war became a chaplain in the king's army  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.622). Immediately after the battle of Edgehill, in November 1642, he was created doctor of divinity and in the same year he became a chaplain to James, duke of York, and prebendary of Westminster. He was a member of the duke's cabinet council, accompanying him to Paris and Brussels in September 1650. With his wife, Judith (<i>d</i>. 1683), a lady-in-waiting to Queen Catharine of Braganza, Killigrew had four children, only two of whom, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1650?, <i>d</i>. 28 Oct 1701) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15535/', "Henry Killigrew")</script> (<i>d</i>. 9 Nov 1712), an admiral, were to survive their father. James, a captain in the navy, was killed in action in January 1695. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15530/', "Anne Killigrew")</script>, born in 1660, was a poet and painter, whose untimely death of smallpox in June 1685 was commemorated in Dryden's famous ode, prefixed to her posthumously published <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1686).<br>
<br>After the Restoration, Killigrew appears to have been actively engaged amassing a variety of appointments and offices. In 1660 he was made almoner to the duke of York, with a salary of &pound;100 per annum, superintendent of the affairs of his chapel, and rector of Wheathamsted in Hertfordshire (a post which in 1673 he resigned in favour of Dr John Lambe, husband of his daughter Elizabeth). After the resignation of Gilbert Sheldon, bishop of London, in early July 1663, the king recommended him for the post of master of the Savoy Hospital. He was elected by the clerks and chaplains on 10 July. Killigrew's petition for the government of St John the Baptist and St John the Evangelist's Hospital in Sherborne, Dorset, was referred to the attorney-general on 10 August 1667. He was granted the mastership, &#145;with power to recover any lands lately belonging to the hospital&#146;, in late 1668 or 1669  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>October 1668&#150;December 1669</i>, 653).<br>
<br>During the Anglo-Dutch War, in August 1673, Killigrew was ordered to deliver up parts of the Savoy Hospital to the &#145;Commissioners for the sick and wounded, there being a present necessity of providing conveniences for their reception&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1 March&#150;31 Oct 1673</i>, 514). As the chaplains later observed, this arrangement had been detrimental to the master and poorer persons in the hospital. Killigrew, after vainly trying to recover the confiscated premises, &#145;compensated some of the sufferers by pensions and doles&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). The eventual ruin of the Savoy Hospital, dissolved in 1702, has nevertheless been generally blamed on Killigrew's mismanagement. In the course of those years, Killigrew distinguished himself as a preacher, author of <span class="italic">Sermons Preached at Whitehall</span> (1685), and as the (anonymous) translator of Martial's <span class="italic">Epigrams</span> (1695). His wife, Judith, reputed an accomplished musician, had been buried at the Savoy on 2 February 1683. It was in response to Anthony Wood's enquiries in late 1691 that Killigrew, then living at Westminster Abbey, provided some of the biographical information contained in the present notice. He died on 14 March 1700.<br>
