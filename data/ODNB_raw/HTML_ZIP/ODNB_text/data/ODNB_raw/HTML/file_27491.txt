<span class="headword">Todd,  James Henthorn</span>  (1805&#150;1869), <span class="occ">biblical scholar</span>, was born in Dublin on 23 April 1805, the eldest son of Charles Hawkes Todd (1782&#150;1826), professor of surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, and his wife, Eliza (1786&#150;1862), daughter of Colonel Bentley. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27492/', "Robert Bentley Todd")</script> was his younger brother. Todd entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 6 November 1820, and graduated with honours in 1824; he took his BA in 1825. A year later his father died, leaving him the eldest of a family of fifteen who had very little money. He stayed in Trinity College, where he took pupils and edited the <span class="italic">Christian Examiner</span>, a church periodical aimed at placing the debate between the established Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic church on a more historical and learned footing. Thereafter he believed it to be his mission to improve the condition of the established church in Ireland and to promote greater learning among the clergy and greater knowledge of church history among the people.<br>
<br>Todd was elected a fellow of Trinity College in 1831 and in the same year took deacon's orders. From this time until he became senior fellow in 1850 he was one of the most popular tutors in Trinity. He was conservative, a high-churchman (in doctrine rather than ritual), and disliked but accepted reform of the college. In 1832 he took priest's orders and wrote a brief history of the university for the <span class="italic">University Calendar</span> of 1833. Many years later he revised this history, and included it as the introduction to his published <span class="italic">List of Graduates of the University</span> (1866). He graduated BD in Dublin in 1837 and DD in 1840.<br>
<br>In 1833, through contacts made via Samuel Roffey Maitland, Todd began to write for the <span class="italic">British Magazine</span>, an English church periodical just started under the editorship of Hugh James Rose. His contributions, all of which defended protestant ascendancy, included papers on Wyclif, on church history, and on the Irish church questions of the day. Around this time the Irish national education system had been started by Archbishop Whately. This was intended to be non-denominational, but many members of the established church, including Todd, felt that the scripture lessons issued by the commissioners favoured Roman Catholics. In order to alert the people in England to what he saw as the true state of affairs, Todd published a fictional letter from the pope to his clergy, advocating the line of action already pursued. This letter, entitled <span class="italic">Sanctissimi domini nostri Gregorii papae XVI epistola ad archiepiscopos et episcopos Hiberniae &hellip; translated from the original Latin</span> (1836) may have been intended as a joke (the same tactic had been used against the Oxford Tractarians not long before), but the published &#145;letter&#146; was taken as genuine by some protestants at a meeting at Exeter Hall, where it raised tensions considerably. Todd publicly announced himself as the author, and was severely criticized for his conduct which he attempted to justify in a preface to a second edition, published the same year.<br>
<br>In 1838 and 1839 Todd was the Donnellan lecturer in Trinity College. Choosing as his subject the biblical prophecies relating to Antichrist, he attacked the view then held by many Irish protestant clergy, that the pope was the Antichrist of <span class="roman">Revelation</span>, arguing that despite much corruption the Roman Catholic church still maintained the essential truths of Christianity. Todd's lectures were published as <span class="italic">Discourses on the Prophecies Relating to Antichrist in Daniel and St Paul</span> (1840). In the same spirit of calm and learned discussion of theological differences, he also started a society at Trinity College for the discussion of religious history, and published a small volume entitled <span class="italic">The search after infallibility: remarks on the testimony of the fathers to the Roman dogma of infallibility</span> (1848), long before the issue of papal infallibility was defined by the Roman Catholic church at the First Vatican Council (1869&#150;70).<br>
<br>In 1843 Todd joined with Edwin Richard Quin, Lord Adare (afterwards third earl of Dunraven), W. Monsell (Lord Emly), William Sewell, and others, to found St Columba's College at Rathfarnham, near Dublin. The school was conducted on Anglican church principles. Unusually for an established school, it taught Irish as well as classics to would-be ordinands. Having also been treasurer of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, since 1837, Todd was made precentor, the second dignitary of the cathedral, in 1864. He turned his attention first to restoration work on the building and then to the improvement of choral services.<br>
<br>In 1849 Todd was made regius professor of Hebrew at the University of Dublin and in 1852 he was appointed librarian at Trinity College. The library had long been neglected, but Todd, with the assistance of John O'Donovan and Eugene O'Curry, classified and arranged the large collection of Irish manuscripts held there. He spent what money the board of Trinity College allowed him in buying rare books, and left the library's holding more than quadrupled, as well as catalogued: &#145;his greatest monument is the printed catalogue&#146;  (McDowell and Webb, 278). Todd made Trinity College Library and manuscript room a world-class library for scholars. His numerous gifts to the university museum included mummy crocodiles and ancient Scandinavian almanacs. He also compiled a <span class="italic">Catalogue of Graduates</span>, since updated.<br>
<br>Todd's most substantial contribution to scholarship was in Irish studies, his work on which was centred mainly at the Royal Irish Academy. Elected a member of the academy in 1833, Todd was involved in its activities from the beginning. He procured transcripts or syntheses of Irish manuscripts held abroad, particularly at the Biblioth&egrave;que Royale, Brussels. He was the academy's honorary secretary from 1847 to 1855, and president for five years from 1856. As president he sought to raise the profile of Irish antiquities, and to promote scholarship in the field of Irish literature. In 1840 he founded the Irish Archaeological Society, which published a number of rare manuscripts and volumes. Todd was also an energetic honorary secretary of the society, and contributed a number of publications to its proceedings, including <span class="italic">The Irish Version of the Historia Brittonum of Nennius</span> (1847), the <span class="italic">Martyrology of Donegal</span> (1864), edited in conjunction with William Reeves, and the <span class="italic">Liber hymnorum, or, Book of Hymns of the Ancient Church of Ireland</span> (2 vols., 1855 and 1869). Todd was very widely consulted about works relating to Irish literature and history, and was said to have been second only to Archbishop Ussher in his knowledge of, and help in developing the discipline of, Irish studies.<br>
<br>About 1860, the same year in which he was given an <i>ad eundem</i> degree by the University of Oxford, Todd was asked by a London publisher to write the lives of the archbishops of Armagh. The publishing firm collapsed when the first volume, dealing with the life of St Patrick, was in press, and it was brought out independently in 1864 as <span class="italic">St Patrick, Apostle of Ireland</span>. In addition Todd published the text of two medieval Irish manuscripts in the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span> as <span class="italic">Cogadh Gaedhel re Gallaibh: the war of the Gaedhil with the Gaill, or, The invasions of Ireland by the Danes and other Norsemen</span> (1867).<br>
<br>Todd was one of the best-known Irishmen of his day, consulted both by statesmen and theologians. During his life he advised and corresponded with Lord John George de la Poer Beresford, W. E. Gladstone, Lord Brougham, John Henry Newman, and E. B. Pusey. In politics he was conservative but independent-minded. He wanted the maintenance of the Anglican establishment at the university. However, according to R. B. McDowell and D. A. Webb, &#145;the rigidity with which he maintained as principles opinions &hellip; disqualified him from statesmanship even on a small scale; as Provost he would have been disastrous&#146;  (p. 278). Notwithstanding, his contributions to Irish literature and to the development of Trinity College Library into a manuscript library of worldwide importance cannot be overestimated. Archdeacon Cotton once referred to Todd as the &#145;Sine qua non of every literary enterprise in Dublin&#146;  (ibid., 525&#150;6).<br>
<br>Todd died, unmarried, in his home, Silveracre, Rathfarnham, co. Dublin, on 28 June 1869, and was buried in the churchyard of St Patrick's Cathedral. After his death the Todd lectureship of the Celtic languages was established in his memory with the help of the Royal Irish Academy.<br>
