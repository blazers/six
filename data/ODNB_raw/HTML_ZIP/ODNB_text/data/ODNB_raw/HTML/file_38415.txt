<span class="headword">Barrett,  Thomas Augustine</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseuds. </em>Leslie Stuart, Lester Thomas]</span>  (1863&#150;1928), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 15 March 1863 in Southport, Lancashire, the younger son of Thomas Barrett, cabinet-maker (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1830), and his wife, Mary Ann Burke, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lester (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1832), both natives of western Ireland. He grew up in Liverpool, where he attended St Francis Xavier's School. His family then moved to Manchester, and there he first gained recognition as a keyboard player. He became church organist at St John's Roman Catholic Cathedral, Salford, under Bishop (later Cardinal) Herbert Vaughan, and later moved to the church of the Holy Name under the latter's brother Bernard Vaughan. He also made an impression with classical piano recitals, after which he formed his own choral society and, from 1889 to 1894, promoted a series of popular Saturday night concerts at St James's Hall, Manchester. Hugely successful, these introduced to Manchester many eminent performers of the time, including the pianist Paderewski and the opera singers Marie Roze and Z&eacute;lie de Lussan. Two of the children of his marriage (on 9 March 1886) to Katharine Mary Fox (<i>b</i>. 1864) were named Bernard Vaughan and Marie Roze.<br>
<br>Through his father's work as property master at the Amphitheatre, Liverpool, Barrett acquired an early taste for the theatre. With his elder brother, Stephen (1855&#150;1924), who became a music-hall performer under the name Lester Barrett, he was an <i>habitu&eacute;</i> of The Ship inn, Manchester, a local bohemian haunt. Gradually the music he composed for local pantomimes, and especially his popular ballads under the name Leslie Stuart, and music-hall songs under the name Lester Thomas, began to eclipse his religious and other serious compositions.<br>
<br>Barrett's first major published successes were the ballad &#145;The Bandolero&#146; (1894), introduced by the Irish baritone who called himself Signor Foli, and the music-hall songs &#145;Louisiana Lou&#146; (1894) and &#145;Sweetheart May&#146; (1895). In 1895 he moved to London to further his career, permanently adopting the pseudonym Leslie Stuart. He was almost immediately rewarded with the huge success of &#145;The Soldiers of the Queen&#146; (1895). It became the hit song of Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee and remained much favoured during the South African War. Its success was augmented in the variety theatre by that of nostalgic, exotically rhythmic songs such as &#145;Little Dolly Daydream&#146; (1897) and &#145;The Lily of Laguna&#146; (1898), written for the American black-face minstrel Eugene Stratton.<br>
<br>The reputation of Leslie Stuart was further enhanced by the score for Owen Hall's musical play <span class="italic">Florodora</span> (1899). This proved a huge success at London's Lyric Theatre and across the Atlantic, most particularly for the double sextet &#145;Tell me, pretty maiden&#146;, in which six top-hatted gentlemen on bended knee paid court to six elegantly dressed young ladies. A further music-hall song hit was &#145;I may be crazy&#146; (1902), and there were some fair stage successes in the songs he wrote for <span class="italic">The Silver Slipper</span> by Owen Hall (1901), <span class="italic">The School Girl</span> by Henry Hamilton and Paul M. Potter (1903), <span class="italic">The Belle of Mayfair</span> by Basil Hood and Charles H. E. Brookfield (1906), and <span class="italic">Havana</span> by George Grossmith and Graham Hill (1908). However, his individual musical style thereafter palled. <span class="italic">Captain Kidd</span> (which Seymour Hills adapted from an American farce; 1910) and <span class="italic">Peggy</span> by George Grossmith (1911), both given in London, failed to add to his reputation, as did <span class="italic">The Slim Princess</span> by Henry Blossom (1910), given in the USA.<br>
<br>By then Barrett's extravagant lifestyle was causing severe financial problems. On the back of his early successes he had built a luxurious home in Hampstead, where he entertained lavishly. He also had a taste for the racecourse, where his hot-headed and stubborn nature led to a break with his most loyal interpreter, Eugene Stratton. Further misfortune came from the pirating of popular sheet music, which was rife when his music was at its most popular at the beginning of the century and which made him a vigorous campaigner for composers' rights. In January 1913 he was declared bankrupt.<br>
<br>In 1915 Barrett's daughter May Leslie-Stuart appeared in a London revival of <span class="italic">Florodora</span>, and he also accompanied her in his songs on the variety stage. In 1920 he was discharged from bankruptcy. In 1926, now frail, he appeared to acclaim, performing a medley of his songs, which by then were evocative of a previous generation. He died at his daughter's home, Downe Lodge, Richmond, Surrey, on 27 March 1928 and was buried in Richmond cemetery three days later. His wife survived him.<br>
