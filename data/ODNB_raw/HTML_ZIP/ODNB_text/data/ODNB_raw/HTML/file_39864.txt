<span class="headword">Basnett,  David</span>, Baron Basnett  (1924&#150;1989), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 9 February 1924 at 1 Ivy Leigh, Liverpool, the son of Andrew Basnett, a collector with a gas company and regional secretary of the National Union of General and Municipal Workers (NUGMW), and his wife, (Mary) Charlotte Kerr. His mother died when he was six. After attending a local elementary school he won a scholarship to Quarry Bank high school in Liverpool. His first job after leaving school was as a bank clerk. During the Second World War he served as a pilot in the Royal Air Force, in Sunderland flying boats involved in reconnaissance missions over the Atlantic.<br>
<br>Basnett joined the NUGMW as a regional official for Liverpool in 1948 and was appointed as the union's first national education officer in 1955. Five years later he was promoted to the post of national industrial officer, with responsibility for negotiations in the chemicals and glass industries. He gained a reputation as one of the most intelligent and progressive of the new generation of union officials, not least through his active participation in the innovative phase of productivity bargaining at ICI and elsewhere in the chemicals industry. He was a tall, thin, and quietly spoken man, whose demeanour was more like that of an academic or civil servant than of a manual workers' trade union official. In 1956 he married Kathleen Joan Molyneaux, the daughter of John Joseph Molyneaux, general practitioner.<br>
<br>Basnett achieved wider public recognition during the dramatic seven-week strike at the Pilkington Glass Company in St Helens, Lancashire, in 1970. The dispute exposed chronic weaknesses in union organization and in union&#150;management relations. The closed-shop agreement covering nearly 8000 workers had produced complacency on the part of local union officials and management, the virtual collapse of union membership participation, and the absence of effective joint procedures. Within a few days the strike became a national <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>, and Basnett was subjected to intense public scrutiny as he struggled to defeat a putative &#145;breakaway union&#146;, to negotiate an end to the bitter dispute, and thereafter to reconstruct the credibility of the NUGMW in St Helens.<br>
<br>The courage and expertise shown by Basnett at Pilkington undoubtedly contributed to his success in the election for the post of NUGMW general secretary in 1973. The dispute confirmed also that the union required substantial reorganization and improved services in order to encourage growth and effective membership participation. Basnett was not wholly successful in his attempts to reform the NUGMW (which in 1976 became the General and Municipal Workers' Union, or GMWU). In the thirteen years before he retired in 1986, he was able to conclude mergers with several unions, most notably with the Boilermakers to form the General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trades Union in 1982. The tradition and practices of regional autonomy, however, impeded the implementation of other reforms that might have allowed the union to benefit more from the growth of overall union membership in the 1970s and strengthen it for the more difficult challenges of the 1980s.<br>
<br>Basnett was appointed to the general council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) in 1966 and became one of its most prominent members during the following twenty years. He served as chairman of the finance and general purposes committee and the economic committee. He represented the TUC on the National Economic Development Council from 1973 to 1986, as a founder member of the National Enterprise Board (1975&#150;9) and as a member of several committees of inquiry and three royal commissions&#151;most notably the 1974&#150;7 royal commission on the press, for which he co-authored a minority report.<br>
<br>Basnett's contribution to the trade union movement can be divided into two distinct periods, separated by the year in which he was chairman of the TUC (1977&#150;8). Throughout the 1970s he worked closely with Jack Jones of the Transport and General Workers' Union in the &#145;inner cabinet&#146; of the TUC, negotiating with the Heath, Wilson, and Callaghan governments on a wide range of economic, industrial, and social policies. In his 1978 presidential address to the congress, Basnett outlined his strong commitment to the view that union leaders had a right and a duty to participate with government in developing policies designed to improve economic performance and reduce social inequality. A few days later, Callaghan astonished the TUC by his decision to delay the expected general election. Over the following six months the widespread industrial disruption of the &#145;winter of discontent&#146; buried what was left of the &#145;social contract&#146; with the Labour government, contributed to its electoral defeat in the spring of 1979, and ended the first, most successful, phase of Basnett's career.<br>
<br>The Conservative governments of the 1980s were determined to weaken the power of trade unions and to exclude their leaders from any involvement in policy making. The focus of Basnett's activity therefore shifted to the relationship between unions and the Labour Party; he helped to create a new organization in 1979, Trade Unionists for a Labour Victory, promoted conferences between union and Labour Party leaders, and pressed for reforms in the party's structure and organization. The failure of many of these initiatives and the weakness of trade unions throughout the 1980s may have contributed to his decision to retire early in 1986. More important, one of his two sons, Ian, a doctor, had suffered serious neck and spinal injuries on a rugby field in 1984. Basnett chose to strengthen further the close family life that he shared with his wife, Kathleen, Ian, and his other son, Paul. Basnett was made a life peer in 1987 and derived considerable satisfaction from his contributions to the House of Lords. He died of cancer at his home, Windrush, St John's Avenue, Leatherhead, Surrey, on 25 January 1989.<br>
