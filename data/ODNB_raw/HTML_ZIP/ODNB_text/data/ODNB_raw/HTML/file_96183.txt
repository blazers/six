<span class="headword">Timpson,  John Harry Robert</span>  (1928&#150;2005), <span class="occ">broadcaster and writer</span>, was born on 2 July 1928 at Ridgeholme, The Ridgeway, Kenton, Middlesex, one of two children of John Hubert Victor Timpson, bank clerk, and his wife, Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Willson. In 1945, at the age of sixteen, he left Merchant Taylors' School in Northwood, Middlesex, abandoned youthful hopes for the theatrical life, and joined his local paper, the <span class="italic">Wembley News</span>, as a cub reporter. His early journalistic career was interrupted by two years of compulsory national service with the Royal Army Service Corps&#151;a &#145;monumental bore&#146;, as he later recalled  (<span class="italic">Today and Yesterday</span>, 16). Soon after returning to civilian life he became a district reporter for the Norfolk-based <span class="italic">Eastern Daily Press</span>, where he remained for eight years, covering a succession of council meetings, court cases, and darts club dinners. On 2 June 1951 he married (Muriel) Patricia Whale, a 24-year-old nurse he had met at a church social event. She was the daughter of Albert Edward Whale, storeman and packer. They had two sons, Jeremy and Nicholas.<br>
<br>In 1959 Timpson joined the BBC as a general reporter, and was mentored by the former war reporter and court correspondent Godfrey Talbot. Between 1962 and 1967 he acted as Talbot's deputy, commentating on royal tours to Tunisia, Australia, and Ethiopia. Radio soon played to his strengths. He possessed a facility with words and reviewers noted, too, his &#145;rich, dark, deep-brown chocolate voice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>, 2 March 1979). This eased his path to a succession of presenting jobs. In 1970 he joined BBC Radio 4's <span class="italic">Today</span> programme, alongside&#151;though very much the junior partner of&#151;Jack de Manio. After de Manio's departure in 1971, Timpson co-presented with Robert Robinson and other up-and-coming broadcasters, such as Libby Purves and Sue MacGregor. <span class="italic">Today</span> had begun with a reputation for being nothing more than a pleasant &#145;morning miscellany&#146;, and Timpson's role had been to help &#145;harden&#146; its news coverage. In the event he found himself drawn to the programme's more amusing stories, and developed a penchant for corny jokes, newspaper misprints, and ambiguous headlines. His trademark &#145;ho ho&#146; quips spoke of a firm belief in the need to leaven often depressing news, especially for early morning listeners.<br>
<br>Timpson had two brief, largely unfulfilling flirtations with television. Before joining <span class="italic">Today</span> he had worked on Britain's first half-hour television news programme, BBC 2's <span class="italic">Newsroom</span> (1968&#150;70), and in 1976 he joined <span class="italic">Tonight</span> as a presenter. After just eighteen months he returned to radio, somewhat dispirited. &#145;I didn't like TV&#146;, he told one magazine; it demanded too many &#145;false smiles&#146;  (<span class="italic">Woman</span>, 10 Dec 1983). By 1978 <span class="italic">Today</span> had been relaunched, and he provided a useful foil to the bumptiousness, northern pride, and cutting political commentary of his regular co-presenter, Brian Redhead. Timpson&#151;southern, something of a John Bull figure, invariably polite and calm&#151;sounded as if he was &#145;seeing things through with a rueful sense of humour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 10 Oct 1973). It was said that he made listeners feel they belonged &#145;to a rather good club&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 21 Nov 2005). For their next few years at the helm he and Redhead were a &#145;perfect and unbeatable duo&#146;  (Donovan, 79). <span class="italic">Today</span>, however, became more of a political heavyweight as the 1980s progressed, and seemed, increasingly, to favour an abrasive interviewing style that Timpson disliked. He left in 1986, but continued to appear regularly elsewhere on Radio 4, chairing <span class="italic">Any Questions?</span> (which he had joined in 1984) and presenting the occasional travelogue.<br>
<br>Though he spent much of his BBC career living in Chorleywood, apparently reconciled to the life of a suburban commuter, Timpson had always wanted to return to the country, and above all to his beloved Norfolk. In 1985 he bought a weekend cottage at Wellingham and moved there permanently in 1987, the same year he left <span class="italic">Any Questions?</span> and was appointed OBE for services to broadcasting. He subsequently moved to a larger house in Weasenham St Peter, overlooking the village green. Now retired from the BBC, he started spending more time than ever writing, mostly on the pleasures and oddities of country life. There was, for example, a regular column for the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, in which he described the annual cycle of church f&ecirc;tes and flower festivals taking place on his doorstep. He had already published his autobiography, <span class="italic">Today and Yesterday</span>, in 1976. There now followed a stream of other slight but highly readable books on country byways and characters, notably <span class="italic">Timpson's England</span> (1987) and <span class="italic">Timpson's English Eccentrics</span> (1991). In 1989 he published his first novel, <span class="italic">Paper Trail</span>, the semi-autobiographical story of a young newspaperman in Norfolk. This was followed by <span class="italic">Sound Track</span> in 1991. His last book was <span class="italic">Timpson on the Verge</span> (2002), about Norfolk village signs. Despite his prolific output, Timpson was never frenetic. More than anything he enjoyed simply &#145;idling&#146; at home, in the garden, or on his four-berth cabin cruiser. He was, he happily admitted, &#145;a bit of a stick-in-the-mud&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sunday Express</span>, 12 Feb 1984). He died at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, King's Lynn, Norfolk, on 19 November 2005, from multiple organ failure, sepsis, and a perforated ulcer. He was survived by his wife, Patricia, and son Jeremy, his son Nicholas having died suddenly a month earlier.<br>
