<span class="headword">Stafford,  Humphrey</span>, first duke of Buckingham  (1402&#150;1460), <span class="occ">soldier and magnate</span>, was born about December 1402, the only son and heir of Edmund Stafford, fifth earl of Stafford (1379&#150;1403), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54430/', "Anne of Woodstock (c.1382&#150;1438)")</script>, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8519/', "Edward III's")</script> youngest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27197/', "Thomas of Woodstock, duke of Gloucester")</script>. Not yet a year old at the time of his father's death, on 21 July 1403, Stafford became a royal ward, custody of his estates and person being awarded to Henry IV's queen, Joan of Navarre. Since two-thirds of his patrimony was occupied by his mother, he entered a greatly diminished inheritance on coming of age, in December 1422, and received less than &pound;1260 annually from his estates for the next sixteen years. However, fortunes were still to be made in the French wars; and, like generations of Staffords before him, he assumed the profession of arms. He first served overseas in 1420, and was knighted by Henry V on 22 April 1421.<br>
<br>King Henry's death and the accession of his infant son gave Stafford an early role on the political stage: within the next three years he became a leading member of the royal council, and despite his youth helped to moderate between the warring factions of Henry Beaufort, bishop of Winchester, and Humphrey, duke of Gloucester. His marriage, by 1424, to Anne Neville (<i>d</i>. 1480), a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19951/', "Ralph Neville, first earl of Westmorland")</script>, and his second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53026/', "Joan Beaufort")</script>, brought him closer to the bishop, although he may initially have sympathized with Gloucester's demands for a more belligerent foreign policy. He spent the years 1430&#150;32 in France with the young king, being engaged in several military offensives and achieving high office as governor of Paris, constable of France, and lieutenant-general of Normandy. Already a knight of the Garter, Stafford was also made count of Perche, with an income of 800 marks a year, but the problems faced by the English in retaining their conquests convinced him that Beaufort was right to advocate peace. His mother's death, in 1438, transformed his own financial position, bringing him the rest of his father's estates (worth an additional &pound;1500 a year), as well as half the Bohun inheritance (&pound;1200), and also the earldom of Buckingham with an annual fee of &pound;1000 charged on the lordships of Holderness, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, and Oakham, Rutland. He was thus one of the greatest landowners in England, with immense reserves of patronage at his disposal. The demands made upon him were, however, correspondingly great.<br>
<br>Earl Humphrey took part in peace talks at Calais, in 1439, and was made captain of the garrison there two years later. This was a move designed to restore morale among the troops, who often went unpaid. The captaincy ate into his resources: by November 1449 he was owed no less than &pound;19,395 by the crown, and although he eventually recovered half this sum he left office in 1451 heavily out of pocket. His creation as first duke of Buckingham on 14 September 1444 offered some compensation for these losses, while also strengthening his personal relationship with a childless king. Just a few months later, however, Henry Beauchamp was made duke of Warwick with precedence over Buckingham, who sought redress before the parliament of 1445. A compromise solution was reached, but rivalry between the two magnates continued until Warwick's early death soon afterwards. Mutual distrust was exacerbated by a power struggle in the midlands, where Buckingham, challenged on his own territory, fought to retain the allegiance of families traditionally loyal to the Staffords. Notwithstanding his early successes, he possessed neither the charisma nor the political skills to exploit his strengths to the full, and was, moreover, hampered by Henry VI's inability to deploy patronage successfully on his behalf at a regional level.<br>
<br>Buckingham's problems in managing his affinity were also due to his preoccupation with government policy, not least as spokesman during peace talks with the French in 1445 and 1446. As constable of England he was present at the arrest of the duke of Gloucester during the Bury parliament of February 1447, and was accorded precedence over all English dukes not of royal blood later in the session. A further reward for his complicity in Gloucester's removal (followed as it was by the prisoner's sudden death) was the duke's manor of Penshurst in Kent. As a prominent marcher lord, Buckingham had a vested interest in the enforcement of order on the Welsh border, whither he accompanied the king in 1449 as a royal justice. In the following year he was similarly involved in the judicial sessions following Cade's uprising, having previously been one of the envoys sent to negotiate with the insurgents at Blackheath. There is little to justify their belief that Buckingham had been excluded from power by &#145;the fals progeny of the Dewke of Suffolk&#146;  (Gairdner, 97).<br>
<br>Buckingham frequently provided a bodyguard for the king during this troubled period, his position in the south-east being further consolidated by a grant of the constableship of Dover and wardenship of the Cinque Ports (conveniently near his headquarters at Tonbridge). Yet this appointment cost him about &pound;250 a year in unpaid fees, and pushed him further into debt. Despite his great wealth, Buckingham was consistently obliged by the pressures of public office to live above a net annual income of approximately &pound;4000. His household alone cost well over &pound;2000 per annum, and his retinue, so often placed at Henry VI's disposal on state occasions, accounted for more than &pound;560.<br>
<br>Anxious to protect an increasingly vulnerable monarch and maintain the <i>status quo</i> of conciliar rule, Buckingham supported the regime headed by Edmund Beaufort, duke of Somerset, during the early 1450s. In January 1454 he presented the infant Prince Edward (his wife's godson) to the king, who had been in a catatonic state since the previous August. During the tense period before parliament met in February he is said to have ordered 2000 extra liveries for his retinue, although in the end conflict was averted. This was partly because he and his influential half-brothers, Henry and Thomas Bourchier, initially agreed to give their backing to Somerset's rival, Richard, duke of York, when he assumed the protectorship of England. An assiduous member of the royal council, Buckingham devoted himself to government business, hoping vainly for some reconciliation between the two factions. Yet his eldest son was married to Somerset's daughter, and he could hardly avoid a degree of partisanship. He helped to secure Somerset's release from prison, in February 1455, and offered to arbitrate between him and York. On the eve of the battle of St Albans, fought on 22 May 1455, he was still trying, as a commander of the royal army, to effect a compromise.<br>
<br>Buckingham was wounded during the fighting, and was afterwards bound over in heavy securities (along with his half-brothers) to keep the peace towards the victorious Yorkists. They otherwise treated him (and the Bourchiers) generously, utilizing his expertise as a commissioner and councillor. In May 1456 he was entrusted with the task of putting down anti-Italian riots in London, the violence of which obliged him to take flight into Essex, disgruntled at the failure of the government to assert its authority. He also experienced problems with Queen Margaret, whose intervention in political affairs now polarized the situation even further. He bitterly opposed her decision to dismiss his half-brothers from office, while she resented Buckingham's efforts at Coventry, in October 1456, to protect the duke of York from attack. Yet he made clear to York his dependence upon King Henry's grace, and, in the last resort, aligned himself with the court party and the queen.<br>
<br>Buckingham had nailed his colours to the mast by the spring of 1457, when he remained with the royal household at Coventry and Hereford for several weeks. He escorted Queen Margaret to London for the &#145;loveday&#146; (public reconciliation) held between the rival factions on 24 March 1458, but within a year hostilities had again broken out. The presence of Buckingham's men during the ensuing campaign helped to secure a victory for the Lancastrian forces. He was among the first to share the spoils of war, being granted estates worth over &pound;700 a year confiscated from York's chamberlain, Sir William Oldhall, and was promised a further &pound;300 to cover military expenses.<br>
<br>The duchess of York was placed in Buckingham's charge, and was reputedly treated with great severity. Despite his posthumous reputation as a moderate, Duke Humphrey sometimes betrayed an ungovernable temper: he and his volatile brother-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13530/', "John Holland, first duke of Exeter")</script>, had been involved in a serious affray in 1429; and he had apparently tried to stab Jeanne d'Arc while she was being interrogated by the English, two years later. As commander of the royal army at Northampton, in 1460, Buckingham is said to have threatened his particular enemy, the earl of Warwick, with death if he approached the royal presence, and to have castigated the bishops who then acted as envoys for the duke of York. Buckingham was killed in the ensuing battle, on 10 July, slain near the king's tent by a group of Kentishmen who had good reason to remember his repressive conduct in 1450. He was buried shortly afterwards at the Greyfriars Church in Northampton, after a long career of public service, during which real greatness and the mantle of the elder statesman had alike consistently eluded him. In his will of August 1459 he had made generous bequests for the endowment of chantries at Maxstoke (a favourite residence acquired by exchange with Sir John Clinton) and at his maternal grandfather's college at Pleshey in Essex.<br>
<br>Buckingham had seven sons, only three of whom survived to adulthood. Humphrey, the eldest, was wounded at the battle of St Albans and died of plague in 1458, leaving an infant, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26204/', "Henry Stafford")</script>, as heir presumptive to the dukedom. The next, another Henry, had also married into the Beaufort family, becoming in 1457 the third husband of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1863/', "Lady Margaret Beaufort")</script>, mother of the future <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12954/', "Henry VII")</script>. John, the youngest, was as a mark of royal favour elevated to the peerage as earl of Wiltshire by Edward IV, on 5 January 1470. Three of the duke's five daughters married well, albeit at considerable cost to their father. The eldest, Anne, was allegedly considered by Charles VII of France as a possible wife for the dauphin, although she married the twelfth earl of Oxford's eldest son instead. Her younger sister, Joan, brought her first husband, William, Viscount Beaumont, over &pound;1883 on their marriage in 1452. They later separated, and she took as her second husband a Norfolk knight, Sir William Knyvet. Buckingham promised &pound;1000 to his third daughter, Margaret, and her husband, John Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury, in 1458, but the contract had not yet been honoured when Buckingham died.<br>
