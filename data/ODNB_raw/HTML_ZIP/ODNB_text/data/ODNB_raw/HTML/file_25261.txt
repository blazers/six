<span class="headword">Shaw,  Lachlan</span>  (1686?&#150;1777), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and historian</span>, was the son of Donald Shaw, a farmer at Rothiemurchus, Inverness-shire. He was educated at Ruthven and then at King's College, Aberdeen, where he graduated MA on 2 May 1711. In the following year he was employed as a schoolteacher at Abernethy in Perthshire, and was presented a divinity bursary for the next two years. After studying theology at Edinburgh University he was licensed on 24 April 1716 by the presbytery of Haddington, and was appointed to the parish of Kingussie on 20 September. He transferred to Cawdor on 19 November 1719 with Helen, daughter of David Stuart, a collector of excise at Inverness, whom he had married on 1 October; the couple had one daughter and one son. Following Helen's death he married, on 14 March 1727, Anna (<i>d</i>. in or after 1777), daughter of Duncan Grant, a bailie of Inverness, with whom he had a further eleven children, among them <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25247/', "Duncan Shaw")</script>. On 9 May 1734 Shaw transferred to a post at Elgin, Moray, and remained there until his retirement in April 1774.<br>
<br>In addition to his work in the church, Shaw was a respected local historian who corresponded with many eminent figures, among them the judge and antiquary Sir David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes, and the naturalist Thomas Pennant, who visited him at Elgin in 1769. He wrote the account &#145;Of Elgin and the shire of Murray&#146; in Pennant's <span class="italic">Tour of Scotland in 1769</span>, which appeared in 1771. Shaw was chiefly known for his <span class="italic">History of the Province of Moray</span>, published in 1775 and posthumously revised and republished in 1827 and 1882. During the early 1750s he also continued <span class="italic">A Genealogical Dedication of the Family of Rose of Kilravock</span>, written by Hew Rose in 1683&#150;4 and printed in 1848. His &#145;Account of the family of Mackintosh&#146;, written in 1758, remained unpublished. Shaw died on 23 February 1777 and was buried near the high altar of Elgin Cathedral, where a memorial slab and window were dedicated to him in 1868.<br>
