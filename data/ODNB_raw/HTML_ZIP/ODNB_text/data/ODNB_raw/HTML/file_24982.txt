<span class="headword">Seager,  Edward</span>  (1812&#150;1883), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 11 June 1812 and, after serving in the ranks for nine years and 188 days from 1832, became a cornet of the 8th light dragoons on 17 September 1841. He was adjutant from 5 October 1841 to 25 October 1854, being gazetted lieutenant on 29 June 1843, captain on 26 October 1851, and major on 31 January 1858. He served with his regiment in the Crimean War of 1854, and up to February 1855, and was present at the battles of Alma, Balaklava (where he was wounded in the charge of the light brigade), Inkerman, and the siege of Sevastopol. On 28 June 1855 he was appointed assistant military secretary to Major-General Lord William Paulet, commanding on the Bosphorus, and he continued in the same office under Sir Henry Knight Storks until the end of the war, when he was awarded the Mejidiye (fifth class). He subsequently served in central India, 1858&#150;9, was present at the action of Boordah, and was mentioned in the dispatches.<br>
<br>From 5 August 1859 to 5 August 1864 Seager was lieutenant-colonel of his regiment, and was then gazetted a brevet colonel in the army. From 3 November 1864 to 31 January 1870 he was acting quartermaster-general in the Dublin district, and from 1 April 1873 to 3 April 1878 inspecting officer of yeomanry cavalry at York. On 15 January 1870 he became a major-general, and on 1 July 1881 was placed on the retired list with the rank of lieutenant-general. On 10 May 1872 he received a reward for &#145;distinguished and meritorious services&#146;, and on 2 June 1877 he was gazetted CB.<br>
<br>Seager was married and had a daughter. He was noted as a devoted family man, of firm Christian conviction. He died at his home, Sion House, Scarborough, on 30 March 1883.<br>
