<span class="headword">Hampton,  John Stephen</span>  (1806?&#150;1869), <span class="occ">surgeon and colonial governor</span>, is shown on his death certificate to have been born in 1810; however the British register of surgeons records his certificate as assistant surgeon in January 1829 at the age of twenty-two, and other details of his birth, parentage, and education have not been found. He gained his medical diploma at Edinburgh in 1828 (suggesting a birth earlier than 1810) and the following January joined the navy as an assistant surgeon. After service in HMS <i>Sphinx</i> off Mexico, in May 1832 he was given three months' leave for additional study and obtained a further medical certificate in Edinburgh. He was then posted to Plymouth, where he distinguished himself during the prevailing cholera epidemic and made his first acquaintance with convicts, who were working in the dockyard. He was promoted surgeon in December 1834 and served in HMS <i>Savage</i>, <i>Firebrand</i>, and <i>Portland</i>. Between 1841 and 1845 he was surgeon-superintendent on three convict ships sailing to Australia. In 1845&#150;6 he joined others in criticizing the state of the convicts in Van Diemen's Land, the control and management of them since 1842, and the character and incompetence of the governor, Sir John Eardley-Wilmot. Reconstructing the establishment, W. E. Gladstone, then secretary of state, appointed Hampton as the new controller-general of convicts, a post he took up when he arrived back in Hobart Town on 27 October 1846, with his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Essex (<i>d</i>. 1869), whom he had married in 1832, and his twelve-year-old son, George.<br>
<br>A tour inspecting the convict probation stations confirmed Hampton's view that drastic reforms were necessary, and these he set about implementing without waiting for the arrival of the new governor, Sir William Denison. He wanted new buildings, better officers, better classifications, more religious and general instruction, and better supervision to reduce &#145;unnatural crime&#146;. He immediately replaced many officers and, as the number of convicts declined in the next two years, he was able to close a number of the convict stations near Hobart Town and Launceston. In August 1847 he issued new regulations which emphasized task work; they were later criticized for permitting the men's early release for hard work rather than &#145;reformation&#146;. As a punishment he preferred solitary confinement to flogging, strongly denying the contemporary (and subsequent) belief that this led to mental instability, and arguing rather that it made the men &#145;very tractable and easily managed&#146;  (report, 29 Oct 1846). In 1848 he visited Norfolk Island. He defended the commandant there, John Price, against reports of personal cruelty and administrative abuses, but he published no detailed refutation of these charges and opposed suggestions that the establishment be closed. However, he did so after a second visit, in 1852, and, though evasive and unconvincing in answering the renewed allegations of brutality and misconduct made by the Roman Catholic bishop Willson, he admitted the place was too far away to superintend properly. Bishop Willson also led protests against Hampton's allegedly harsh treatment of the Irish rebels in Van Diemen's Land, particularly the solitary confinement imposed on their leader William Smith O'Brien, which caused meetings in Dublin and Cork and debate in the House of Commons, and, in 1850, led to a reprimand from Governor Denison.<br>
<br>Though Hampton was in many respects apparently an efficient administrator, in May&#150;June 1855 several officers in the convict department, including himself, were accused in the press of misusing materials and employing convict artisans for their private profit. After an inquiry by the executive council, the governor reported that the &#145;charges of fraud, peculation and embezzlement were not justified&#146;, though it was &#145;evident that great abuses have existed in the Convict Department in the use of convict labour&#146; and &#145;the Controller-General cannot be considered altogether free from blame&#146;  (to Colonial Office, 16 July 1855). The legislative council, dissatisfied with the &#145;official&#146; inquiry, took the matter up, and naturally wanted to examine Hampton, even though he was an imperial and not a local official. He refused to appear before it and left the colony in October on sick leave, protesting against the council's &#145;unlawful and tyrannical proceedings&#146;. He never returned, and is remembered less for the admittedly important reforms he made in his department on his arrival than as an unnecessarily severe and unsympathetic disciplinarian, tainted with corruption&#151;&#145;a cold-hearted and devious opportunist&#146; as Mr Justice Barry put it, writing in 1964  (<span class="italic">The Life and Death of John Price</span>, 55).<br>
<br>In 1857 Hampton went to Toronto, Canada, on urgent private business, and the following year resigned his Tasmanian post. After returning to England in 1861 he found the duke of Newcastle, then secretary of state, ready to overlook any suggestion of past malpractice and appoint him governor of Western Australia, a colony then receiving about 800 convicts a year sentenced to transportation from the United Kingdom.<br>
<br>Hampton assumed office in Perth in February 1862, and again his reputation is mixed. Intent on imposing stricter discipline on the prisoners, he took personal control of the convict department in December on the departure of the successful long-serving controller-general, Colonel Henderson RE. In 1866 he appointed his son to the position, though the latter already held several government posts. By 1867 more accusations of undue severity had reached the Colonial Office, including excessive flogging (the amount per convict had doubled under Hampton), hard labour in chains, and solitary confinement in dark cells. An office investigation exonerated the governor but disapproved some of his actions, under-secretary Sir Frederic Rogers minuting that &#145;some allegations of cruelty could be substantiated&#146;  (18 Feb 1868, CO, 18/155).<br>
<br>Apart from this Hampton had quarrelled with Bishop Hale over convict chaplains. He had taken little interest in Aboriginal welfare, declaring that up-country he could not provide police protection for either settlers or Aborigines, though the settlers were not to use unnecessary violence except in actual self-defence. On the other hand he greatly benefited the colony by employing the convicts extensively on public works, especially on a new causeway across the Swan River to the north of Perth, a bridge across it at Fremantle, a town hall, supreme court, and government house in Perth, and a summer residence for the governor on Rottnest Island, as well as police stations, court houses, jetties, lighthouses, schools, and an extensive road programme. However, he did not oppose the cessation of transportation in 1868 when the imperial government wanted to stop it and Western Australia seemed to have become self-supporting. He encouraged settlement (without convicts) 1000 miles north-west between the Fortescue and De Grey rivers and at Nickol Bay. He restored the public finances. He recommended the extension of representative government and, pending London's decision, he agreed in 1867 to appoint as his nominees to the legislative council persons who had been elected locally.<br>
<br>Hampton left the colony on 14 November 1868 shortly after the last convict ship had arrived. He died of tuberculosis at 1 East Ascent, St Leonards, Sussex, on 1 December 1869, eight months after his wife. Some of his actions had undoubtedly intensified the popular desire to curb gubernatorial authority in the colony, but his labour policies had benefited it and turned its capital into an attractive little town. But he received no official recognition during his career, and the Western Australian newspapers published no obituaries.<br>
