<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boyle,  Edward Charles Gurney</span>, Baron Boyle of Handsworth  (1923&#150;1981), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at 63 Queen's Gate, Kensington, London, on 31 August 1923, elder son in the family of two sons and one daughter of Sir Edward Boyle (1878&#150;1945), second baronet, barrister, writer, and company director, and his wife, Beatrice (<i>d</i>. 1961), daughter of Henry Greig, of Belvedere House, Kent. His grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32012/', "Sir Edward Boyle (1848&#150;1909)")</script>, created the first baronet in 1904, also a barrister, had been Conservative MP for Taunton from 1906 to 1909. The name Gurney derived from the surname of the first baronet's mother.<br>
<br>Boyle was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford, and showed early talent in the directions of his future life, writing and politics. At Eton he was president of the Political Society and editor of the <span class="italic">Eton Chronicle</span>. At Oxford he was president of the union, active in Conservative politics, and in 1947 one-third of a university debating team (with Tony Benn and Kenneth Harris) which toured the United States. He succeeded his father as baronet in 1945, having already had three years as a temporary civil servant at the Foreign Office, and so went up to Oxford with the first post-war generation, aged twenty-two. Though he left Oxford in 1949 with only a third-class degree in history, which seemed to belie his recognized intellectual abilities, he was already seen as a coming man who would achieve much&#151;more indeed than he ever did achieve. Sir Edward Heath, a close friend as well as a political associate, felt that Boyle's &#145;intellectual characteristics &hellip; comprised a wide breadth of interest, a remarkable store of information, and a phenomenal memory for everything that he encountered, but his was not a mind full of innovative ideas or of penetrating analysis&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Though they shared what Heath called &#145;deep-seated and moderate convictions which guided him all through his life&#146;  (ibid.) there was an intellectual difference between the leader Heath, who cogitated mainly to promote action, and the follower Boyle, who enjoyed philosophical reflection for its own sake, and was not always quick to make up his mind. This divergence of approach was a barrier both to Boyle's eventual advancement at the top and to Heath getting the best out of the Conservative colleague who most nearly shared his own outlook.<br>
<br>After Oxford, Boyle was assistant editor of the <span class="italic">National Review</span>, but while still an undergraduate had been selected as Unionist candidate for Birmingham, Perry Barr. He fought and lost the seat in the general election of 1950, aged only twenty-six, but established connections with Birmingham which lasted for the rest of his political career. He comfortably won the Handsworth constituency, then safely Conservative, at a by-election in November 1950, and retained the seat until he went to the Lords in 1970. Birmingham was, though, an uncomfortable base for a moderate like Boyle, for its Conservatism tended to the right, especially when coloured immigration affected the city's politics soon after Boyle became one of its MPs. He was not a comfortable member of the Birmingham Conservative members' group in the Commons, refused to campaign for immigration restrictions, and in the 1960s had difficulties with his local party, notably in the aftermath of Enoch Powell's race speech in 1968, delivered in the city, when the rising Monday Club began to stir up his local activists against him.<br>
<br>When Churchill's Conservatives regained office in 1951, Boyle was appointed parliamentary private secretary to the under-secretary for air, moving on to be parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Supply in July 1954 (younger even than Churchill himself when first given office in 1906), and became economic secretary to the Treasury in 1955. Apart from a single interruption, he spent the rest of his Commons life on the front bench, and even that interval was short: friends who organized a celebration of his resignation in November 1956 in protest at the Suez invasion found that he was back in office as a junior education minister under Macmillan in January 1957 before they could actually hold the party. Difficulties with his constituency following his stand over Suez led him to consider leaving politics to take up the permanent post of head Treasury representative in Delhi, as he confided to his friend Tony Benn, but he decided to stick with his departmental position.<br>
<br>In 1959 Boyle returned to the Treasury as financial secretary, and then went back to the cabinet post of minister of education in 1962. He stayed at education until his party lost office in 1964, and then returned after an unhappy period as shadow home secretary (1964&#150;5) to be education spokesman in opposition. Economics and education, the two fields in which he took the greatest personal interest, were also therefore the only departments where he ever acted as minister or shadowed for any lengthy period in opposition. Consequently Boyle never had opportunities to develop as a political all-rounder. A modest and easy-going man, he even allowed himself in 1964 to be demoted from minister of education to minister of state at the larger Department of Education and Science (though retaining his cabinet seat), when Alec Douglas-Home needed the secretaryship of state for Quintin Hogg.<br>
<br>During his two periods at the Treasury, Boyle proved a capable minister, with an unusually good grasp for a minister in that generation of the economics involved. The chancellor, R. A. Butler, had wanted him as a junior treasury minister after seeing his impressive performance at supply, and Boyle thereafter remained close to Butler, strongly backing him for the premiership in 1963. During 1955 he had to carry a heavy responsibility, since Butler had to cope simultaneously with an economic crisis, personal ill health, and a dying wife. He worked well enough with Macmillan when he replaced Butler at the end of the year, though he was unable to persuade him even of the economic risks of the Suez adventure, and it was this that ensured his rapid return to office when Macmillan became prime minister. He had delayed his Suez resignation until after the cease-fire, not wanting to divide the country while British troops were under fire, but stuck to his own guns to the extent of abstaining in the no-confidence debate that followed, one of only eight Conservative MPs to do so. During the Profumo crisis of 1963 he seriously considered resignation once again, and the many letters from friends which urged him to do so indicated the reputation for personal integrity that he enjoyed.<br>
<br>Boyle was unlucky that he twice arrived at the Treasury after a pre-election boom had over-heated the economy, so that the naturally expansionist Boyle was forced to help implement the credit squeezes of 1955&#150;6 and 1961&#150;2. He did, though, willingly help Heathcoat Amory as chancellor in resisting Macmillan's demand for tax cuts even during a boom in 1960. He was thought to have done well at the Treasury on both occasions, and the whips and party managers were happy to see him progress upwards, offering as he did a youthful, unstuffy, and modern face to a party increasingly jaded during thirteen years in office. When Macmillan reshuffled his team and gave Boyle his first cabinet posting at education in 1962, he identified the Etonian and Harrovian baronets Boyle and Sir Keith Joseph as his modernizing &#145;beavers&#146;, who would help to project a forward-looking image, while he himself contributed continuity and experience. Given his lifestyle, private means, and the intense knowledge of classical music which made him a knowledgeable conversationalist, a regular visitor to Glyndebourne, and the would-be author of a book on the composer Gabriel Faur&eacute;, Boyle was never exactly convincing in this role of classless, modern man.<br>
<br>At education Boyle assisted Geoffrey Lloyd in a modest expansion programme in 1957&#150;9, and then pursued a far more active one of his own from 1962. His introduction to the published Newsom report on secondary schooling has been hailed as &#145;a momentous breakthrough in official thinking&#146;, since he took the opportunity to reject the idea of fixed intelligence levels which had underpinned the tripartite system set up in 1944, and demanded instead that all children should have &#145;an equal opportunity of <i>acquiring</i> intelligence and of developing their talents and abilities to the full&#146;. He naturally therefore welcomed comprehensive schools, but at the same time, as a staunch believer in academic standards, could not also accept the demise of the grammar school  (Cook and McKie, 172). It fell to Boyle to announce the government's acceptance of the Robbins report into higher education when published in 1963, and so dramatically to accelerate the rate of expansion in the university sector during the decade, during which student numbers doubled and expenditure on universities approximately tripled. His seven honorary degrees (four of them before he himself abandoned the Commons for the common room) and his pro-chancellorship of the new University of Sussex (1965&#150;70) testified to the belief that he had as a minister made a material impact on tertiary education.<br>
<br>In opposition after 1964 the Home and Education portfolios were both responsibilities where Boyle's innate moderation conflicted with the party's right wing, and he was sometimes indeed attacked at party conferences as a surrogate for his friend and leader Heath. These were not therefore happy times for him politically, since he was reluctant to adopt even the rhetoric of a party moving to the right. Heath has recalled that Boyle &#145;repeatedly refused&#146; the offer of other front-bench positions at this time  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), but Boyle was not offered such positions as shadow chancellor which would have both engaged his interest and reflected his seniority. He was, for example, one of the few Conservative frontbenchers interested enough to find out in the later 1960s about the emerging monetarist school of economics, which swept his party in the next generation, but he was also a supporter of incomes policies. Frustrated by lack of progress, he decided in 1969 to retire from the Commons and become directly involved in education as vice-chancellor of the University of Leeds. He could thus from 1970, in Heath's words, &#145;express his views and implement his policies without constant interference from those taking part in the political battle&#146;  (ibid.). Boyle became a life peer in July 1970 and, in deference to his new non-political role, sat on the cross-benches in the House of Lords. In June 1981, shortly before his death, he was made a Companion of Honour.<br>
<br>After he moved to Leeds, Boyle's admired fair-mindedness secured his appointment as chairman of the top salaries review board, and in a time of rapid inflation he was instrumental in ensuring that politicians were steeled to the always difficult task of ensuring fair remuneration for the highest-paid public servants. At Leeds he was a diplomatic vice-chancellor during the later period of the student unrest which had begun in 1968, a difficult manager for student radicals to hate. He was fully committed to the university and its members, actively involved in its affairs, and recognized to have done his job so well that he was in 1977&#150;9 chairman of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals. It was characteristic of Boyle that he preferred meeting and dealing with students in Leeds to the national leadership of the university sector.<br>
<br>Boyle was, thought Anthony Sampson in 1962, one of the few &#145;radically minded men&#146; within modern Conservatism, though he had:<blockquote>a nineteenth century look to him: he is a huge rubicund baronet who wears formal clothes, and talks with unconcealed learning &hellip; He walks like a bear, with a formidable shuffle, and he has the broad interests and the leisureliness of a cultivated squire. (Sampson, 89)</blockquote>He was a persuasive rather than an oratorical speaker, and a man who rarely enjoyed scoring party political points in debate. Indeed, for a politician he had like Keith Joseph the near-fatal weakness of always being able to see the case against whatever position he was advancing, and in many cases sharing some sympathy with it too. This made him a sometimes dithering frontbencher, for example, over secondary education, where he would not adopt an all-out defence of grammar schools, yet could not commit himself wholeheartedly to comprehensives and then seek to persuade Conservatives to join him there. He was, though, a courageous man, unshakeably committed to the defence of reason and of moderate causes, for example, on race relations; when contesting the Powellite drift within the Conservative Party in 1965&#150;70 he constantly proclaimed the need for understanding on both sides as a multiracial society developed. He symbolized a civilized, centrist, conciliatory style of Conservatism; in 1980 there were reports that he was involved in discussions about the formation of a centre party. His withdrawal to the House of Lords in 1970 provoked expressions of regret about the lack of intellectuals in the House of Commons, and the reflection in a <span class="italic">Times</span> leader that British politics failed to attract sufficient &#145;men of powerful mind&#146; of the type which he represented  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 June 1970, 11).<br>
<br>In his earlier years Boyle had been a high Anglican, and though he moved steadily towards agnosticism as he aged, he never lost that passion for service to the community which his early beliefs and family background had engendered. In later life he suffered from ill health, and died at his home, the vice-chancellor's lodge, 10 Grosvenor Road, Leeds, on 28 September 1981. He had never married, and the baronetcy passed to his brother, Richard Gurney Boyle (1930&#150;1983).<br>
