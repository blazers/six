<span class="headword">Berry,  Edward</span>  (1706/7&#150;1760), <span class="occ">actor and singer</span>, made his first recorded appearance on the London stage at Drury Lane on 6 February 1729 as Hobinol in Charles Johnson's <span class="italic">The Village Opera</span>. For five seasons Berry was employed as a singing actor, primarily in the new genre of ballad opera. Unsuited by his large, heavy build and low-pitched voice for romantic leads, he played character roles such as Squire Clodpole in William Chetwood's <span class="italic">The Lover's Opera</span> (14 May 1729), the Butler in Charles Coffey's <span class="italic">The Devil to Pay</span> (6 August 1731), and the Old Debauchee in Theophilus Cibber's <span class="italic">The Harlot's Progress</span> (31 March 1733). His first benefit, shared with three other performers, came in May 1731 and at this time he began to take roles in plays, including Antonio in <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> and Mortimer in <span class="italic">1 Henry IV</span>. During the first part of the 1733&#150;4 season Berry was one of the breakaway group of Drury Lane performers led by Theophilus Cibber that acted at the Haymarket Theatre, and there he developed his acting skills by taking a large number of small roles in straight plays. The rebels returned to Drury Lane in March 1734 and Berry had his first solo benefit that April. He continued to add non-singing roles to his repertory and by the end of the 1736&#150;7 season he had taken well over 100 different parts in plays and musical pieces. In the summer vacations during the early 1730s Berry appeared in theatre booths at the Bartholomew and Southwark fairs. He joined other Drury Lane performers in a summer season at Canterbury in 1736 and at Bristol in the 1740s.<br>
<br>Berry's benefit on 7 May 1737 was advertised as &#145;For the Entertainment of the Grand Master, and the rest of the Brethren &hellip; of the Free and Accepted Masons&#146;  (Scouten, 669). The evening included songs by Berry and another masonic actor, James Oates, who was to lose his place in the Drury Lane company at the end of the season. On 30 August, the first night of the new season, Berry, Oates, and their fellow mason and actor Charles Shepard caused a disturbance in the pit, calling for Oates to be reinstated, and it would seem that Berry and Shepard were also dismissed. Berry was by then married and a father, for a daughter, Ann, had been born to Edward and Ann Berry (<i>d</i>. in or before 1749) on 1 April. During his absence from the stage he ran a coffee house in Bridges Street, Covent Garden, known as Berry's Coffee House or the Theatre Coffee House, and masonic records show that a lodge met there from 1738 to 1740. Berry appeared again at Drury Lane at a benefit for him organized by the masons on 15 May 1739; he returned as a full-time member of the company that autumn and remained at Drury Lane until the onset of his final illness in 1759.<br>
<br>Berry was a hard-working, reliable, middle-ranking actor. He retained a few roles involving singing, notably the gaoler Lockit in John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>. As other actors died or changed companies Berry built up a large repertory in both tragedy and comedy, almost always playing older characters. In 1759 Thomas Wilkes wrote:<blockquote>He has the art, known but by few on the stage, of diversifying his old men: his Adam in <span class="roman">As You Like It</span>, is genuine nature in a low sphere. It is a praise to his judgement that he preserves a proper dignity in the grief of King Henry [<span class="italic">Richard III</span>]. (Wilkes, 274&#150;5)</blockquote>Berry specialized in anguished fathers, including Leonato in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span>, Brabantio in <span class="italic">Othello</span>, and Sciolto in Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">The Fair Penitent</span>. Audiences were moved by his real tears in such roles, but according to Thomas Davies in his <span class="italic">Life of Garrick</span> &#145;this actor's great fault was too violent an attempt to pathetic feeling; his tears were shed abundantly indeed, but often loudly and ungracefully&#146;  (Davies, 1.172). During Berry's last twelve seasons David Garrick was the leading actor and manager at Drury Lane; Berry played the Ghost to his Hamlet, Gloucester to his Lear, and Sir Epicure Mammon to his Abel Drugger in Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">The Alchemist</span>. At the very end of Berry's career the author of <span class="italic">An Essay upon the Present State of the Theatre</span> found him &#145;very indifferent&#146; in tragedy but praised him in comedy: &#145;In the characters of Sir Epicure Mammon, Boniface, Serjeant Kite, Caliban, and many others, he hits the true spirit of comedy, and never loses sight of nature&#146;  (p. 218).<br>
<br>Berry's wife had died by 20 April 1749, when he made a will leaving all his estate to his &#145;Dear Child Ann&#146;. From this time until his death he had lodgings with Mr Pope, a peruke maker, in Russell Street, Covent Garden. His last appearance was as Sir Epicure Mammon on 15 March 1759. An advertisement in the <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span> for 11 April 1759 stated that he would be unable to act at his benefit on 16 April &#145;having been confined for some Time past by a severe Illness&#146;. Berry died at his lodgings in Russell Street on 8 January 1760 and was buried in the churchyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields five days later. He was said to have left about &pound;1000 to his daughter, by then the wife of James Hyde; she erected an affectionately worded monument to his memory.<br>
