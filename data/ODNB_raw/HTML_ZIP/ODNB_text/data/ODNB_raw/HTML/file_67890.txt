<span class="headword">Laing,  Andrew</span>  (1856&#150;1931), <span class="occ">marine engineer</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 31 January 1856, the son of George Laing, a builder and contractor, and his wife, Janet Thomson. It was thought that he would enter his father's business, and he was educated with this in mind. After attending the Edinburgh normal school he went to James Baillie's private school in Morningside, where there was an emphasis on commercial education. Instead of entering the family firm he was apprenticed to Hogg and Walker, engineers and millwrights, in Edinburgh. In 1877 Laing entered the drawing office of the shipbuilders John Elder &amp; Co. in Glasgow as an engineering draughtsman. During the early years he worked under Dr A. C. Kirk, the renowned developer of triple-expansion engines. His arrival coincided with the development of fast Atlantic liners, such as the Guion liner <i>Arizona</i>. Laing was promoted rapidly, becoming chief draughtsman in 1881, assistant manager in 1885, and engine-works manager in 1887. Finally, in 1890, he was appointed a director of what had now become the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company. He was responsible for the engining of a number of Cunard liners, as well as warships, Castle liners, and Norddeutscher Lloyd vessels. Under him the engine and boiler works were redeveloped, and the company he served remained at the forefront of technical innovation.<br>
<br>It was therefore something of a surprise when Laing moved to Tyneside as the manager of the engine works of the Wallsend Slipway and Engineering Company in 1896. The move was apparently prompted by a dispute with his fellow directors over remuneration, a situation probably not helped by Laing's forceful manner, but for which he would probably have remained in Glasgow. Fairfield's loss was undoubtedly Wallsend's gain, as Laing's influence transformed a business hitherto devoted to the construction and repair of machinery for ordinary cargo vessels. Laing's first important design at Wallsend was the machinery for the Russian icebreaker <i>Ermak</i>, and in 1900 the company secured its first Admiralty contract. As the company history puts it:<blockquote>Andrew Laing was a man of outstanding energy and imagination, and his talents were exactly what the company needed at this period of rich possibilities in ship-propulsion technology. To his already considerable reputation, he was soon to add the title of the man who &#145;sold&#146; the turbine engine to the sponsors of the <i>Mauretania</i>. (<span class="italic">Launching Ways</span>, 34)</blockquote>The contract for the <i>Mauretania</i> was of such a scale that it precipitated a reorganization of the industry on Tyneside. The merged company of Swan, Hunter, and Wigham Richardson Ltd took a controlling interest in the Wallsend Slipway and Engineering Company, who built the quadruple-screw turbine propelling machinery for the giant liner. During the First World War the company engined sixty-eight vessels of all types, including the battleships <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> and <i>Malaya</i>. The need to improve engine performance led Laing to develop the Wallsend-Howden system of oil firing, which began manufacture in 1909. Sir Reginald Skelton recalled Laing's &#145;vigour and independence of thought and his accurate judgment ever inclining towards prudence and caution, but well tempered by an appreciation of the necessity for continuous progress&#146;  (Skelton, 48).<br>
<br>Laing, who had become a director at Wallsend in 1903, eventually became a director of Swan, Hunter as well as of the Newcastle and Gateshead Gas Company. He was appointed CBE in 1917 for his war work, and in 1930 the North-East Coast Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders bestowed its highest distinction on him, an honorary fellowship. He was a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, a vice-president of the Institution of Naval Architects, and a member of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland, the American Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers, and the American Society of Naval Engineers. He also served on a number of technical committees and research bodies. Although he was deeply interested in research, Laing's only publication was &#145;Fifty years of steamship machinery installations&#146;, which appeared in the <span class="italic">Marine Engineer</span> in June 1929.<br>
<br>A life of high achievement was lived with a narrow focus, for Laing was unmarried and had no interests outside marine engineering. At his death he and his close contemporary Sir Charles Parsons were considered to be on a par, &#145;as being the two greatest marine engineers in the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Transactions of the North-East Coast Institution</span>, 432), since when he has been comparatively overlooked. In his lifetime he was reckoned to have supervised the construction of engines amounting to 5 million horsepower. During a business trip to London, Laing caught a chill that developed into pneumonia. He died at his home, 15 Osborne Road, Newcastle upon Tyne, on 24 January 1931 and was buried in Morningside cemetery, Edinburgh, on 29 January.<br>
