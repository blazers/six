<span class="headword">McKillop <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Seward]</span>,  Margaret</span>  (1864&#150;1929), <span class="occ">scientist and university teacher</span>, was born on 22 January 1864 at 23 Church Street, Wigan, Lancashire, the daughter of James Seward, a schoolmaster at the Liverpool Institute, and his wife, Sarah Jane Woodgates. She was educated at Blackburne House school, Liverpool, and Somerville Hall, Oxford, where she held the Gilchrist exhibition and the Reinagle scholarship, jointly worth &pound;80 a year, which enabled her to complete her studies. She lacked neither social confidence nor academic ability, and a Somerville contemporary, Frances Elizabeth Sheldon, remembered her as &#145;our calm, sensible but witty Miss Seward, the smartest girl in England&#146;  (Sheldon, letter to her mother, 2 Feb 1883). In October 1884 she became the first woman at Oxford entered for the honour school of mathematics, gaining a second class; and in 1885 she became the first to gain a first class in the final honour school of natural science (chemistry). As Oxford women were not yet permitted to graduate, she proceeded to her MA in 1905 at Trinity College, Dublin, which had admitted women to full membership in the previous year.<br>
<br>By then Seward had been teaching for twenty years. After her final exams in 1885 she stayed on as a resident science tutor at Somerville. Her duties included chaperoning undergraduates, a convention taken very seriously in the early days of women at Oxford. Some male dons found the practice as unwelcome as did the chaperones themselves, and when the eminent Christ Church chemist A. G. Vernon Harcourt made known his strong objections, Seward carried out her own research elsewhere in his laboratory, while her charge, Miss Florence Rich, attended his class. In 1887 Seward took up the post of lecturer in chemistry at Royal Holloway College, where she remained until 1891, when her marriage to John McKillop, a civil engineer, entailed a move to Singapore. After three or four years they returned to England with their only child, Alasdair. She next taught at Bradford Girls' Grammar School and Roedean School before, in 1897, becoming lecturer in chemistry at the ladies' department of King's College, in the University of London (renamed the women's department in 1902, and becoming King's College for Women in 1908). She was made a fellow in February 1911 and remained at King's until 1915.<br>
<br>In June 1899 McKillop represented theoretical science as a profession at the International Congress of Women, held in London. She recognized a natural tendency among the scientists present &#145;to exalt one's own 'ology as the very one for women&#146; and also a &#145;general and hearty appreciation of the kindness received by women students from scientific men&#146;. She nevertheless came away with a poor view of her subject &#145;as offering &#147;openings&#148; for college women students&#146;  (<span class="italic">Somerville Students' Association Report</span>, Nov 1899, 20). Her determination to change this was given full scope at King's, where she played an important part in the development of &#145;home and social science&#146; as an academic discipline, modelled on the professional training given in medicine, agriculture, and engineering. The progress of &#145;domestic science&#146; was given impetus by the Edwardian interest in reform of the home as a social institution, and by the increasing demand for women teachers, school and factory inspectors, and health visitors. In 1908 a three-year course in &#145;home and social science&#146; was begun at King's, and in the following year McKillop contributed a short article on its progress to the Somerville Students' Association annual report, citing the demand from headmistresses for the &#145;new sort of domestic science teacher&#146;  (<span class="italic">Somerville Students' Association Report</span>, Oct 1909, 48). McKillop defined this as someone who taught science applicable to the home, a &#145;practical-minded woman&#146; who was also a good form teacher, but she accepted that headmistresses were &#145;a little inclined to expect a first class chemist combined with a first class cook, who can also take odd sciences and other subjects throughout the school!&#146;  (ibid., 48). The subject's growing academic standing was acknowledged in 1916 when the University of London instituted a diploma in household and social science; in 1920 the course was recognized with the degree of bachelor of science.<br>
<br>With Mabel Atkinson, who taught economics and ethics at King's from 1908 to 1914, McKillop wrote <span class="italic">Economics: Descriptive and Theoretical</span> (1911), an undergraduate textbook. She left King's in 1915 and in the following year published <span class="italic">Food Values: what they are and how to Calculate them</span>, a straightforward approach to the complex subject of nutrition intended for anyone involved in cookery, whether at a professional or a domestic level. In 1917 she undertook war work with the information and statistical department at the Ministry of Food. Through her son, Alasdair, like his father a civil engineer, she became interested in theories of industrial efficiency and scientific management reaching Britain from the United States. Together they wrote <span class="italic">Efficiency Methods: an Introduction to Scientific Management</span> (1917), which welcomed a sea change in attitudes to industry brought about by the war, when &#145;to be inefficient has become a national crime&#146;. The &#145;business man&#146;, they noted with approval, was at last being &#145;respectfully treated by the governing class&#146;  (p. 197). The change was timely since nobody associated with British industry could ignore the new work practices being pioneered in America, which were certain to be taken up by Britain's industrial competitors, notably Germany and Japan. <span class="italic">Efficiency Methods</span> is in effect a manual showing British industry how to increase production and eliminate waste. Among the illustrations is a series of photographs showing the old and new methods for loading sixteen boxes onto a truck. Trade unionists were certain to be alarmed by this time and motion study, but the McKillops saw efficiency methods as a way of benefiting everyone: greater productivity, they reasoned, would result in improved welfare for the workers.<br>
<br>After the war McKillop, who was created MBE in 1919, worked with the Fabian Society women's group to raise the status and public perception of domestic work. While at King's she had acted as assistant librarian, in 1914, and she ended her career as the librarian of the Sociological Society (1921&#150;9). She died on 29 May 1929 at St Mary's Nursing Home, Burlington Lane, Chiswick, London, her husband having predeceased her; she was survived by her son.<br>
