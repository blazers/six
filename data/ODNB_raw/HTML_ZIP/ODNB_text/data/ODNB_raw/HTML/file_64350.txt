<span class="headword">Le Texier,  Anthony A.</span>  (<em>c.</em>1737&#150;1814), <span class="occ">monologuist and theatre manager</span>, was born about 1737 in Lyons, France, of good, though not noble, family. Little is known of his early life, but by 1770 he was a cashier in the office of the ferme g&eacute;n&eacute;rale at Lyons. Having a strong inclination towards the theatre, he participated in amateur theatricals wherever he could, one particular triumph being in Jean-Jacques Rousseau's <span class="italic">Pygmalion</span> in June 1770. Since his social status prevented him from becoming a professional actor, he began to hold play-readings in which he would perform all the parts himself.<br>
<br>By 1774 Le Texier's readings had become popular and, abandoning his secure position with the ferme g&eacute;n&eacute;rale, he went to Paris. After only two recitals there he was a sensation. However, the extraordinary amount of adulation he received turned his head, and he became insufferably arrogant. When reciting in front of Louis XV, who, exhausted after a day's hunting, fell asleep during his performance, Le Texier is said to have woken the king by slamming a book in front of him. Once he had lost royal support&#151;the king considered his performances &#145;too noisy&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>)&#151;official questions started being asked about his having left his post at Lyons without permission, and he was accused of peculation. He fled Paris, spent a few months acting comedies before Voltaire at Ferney, and, via the Austrian Netherlands and Weimar, finally reached England in September 1775.<br>
<br>In London Le Texier became acquainted with David Garrick, who thought his talents &#145;very extraordinary&#146;  (Hedgepath, 273). Their initial correspondence shows a relationship of mutual respect and admiration, but when Le Texier tried to exploit the friendship by urging Garrick to intercede with the French ministry Garrick refused. Not long after, possibly because of Le Texier's arrogant behaviour, he withdrew his patronage.<br>
<br>Apart from liaising with Garrick, Le Texier was a frequent guest of Henry and Hester Thrale, of Horace Walpole at Strawberry Hill, and of many others. He also recited in front of George III and participated in amateur theatricals at various country houses. In 1777, for example, he took the title role in Rousseau's <span class="italic">Pygmalion</span> and played the violin for George Mason-Villiers, Viscount Villiers, and his guests at Bolney Court, Henley-on-Thames, Buckinghamshire. In that same year he began bringing out by subscription the <span class="italic">Journal &Eacute;tranger de Litt&eacute;rature, des Spectacles et de Politique</span>. This magazine was especially valuable for its theatrical criticism, but for unknown reasons it was discontinued after a year.<br>
<br>Le Texier was particularly associated with the house of William Craven, sixth Baron Craven, and his wife, Elizabeth (formerly Lady Elizabeth Berkeley), at Newbury in Berkshire. Lady Craven was the energizing force behind various amateur theatricals, for which she employed Le Texier's assistance. At a charity performance directed by Lady Craven at Newbury Town Hall on 11 and 12 May 1778, Le Texier played the Dutch Gardener in her translation of <span class="italic">Le somnambule</span>, by Antoine de Ferrol, comte de Ponte-de-Veyle. This was an op&eacute;ra comique in which Le Texier probably also sang.<br>
<br>From 1778 to 1779 Le Texier was acting manager of a small but good company of singers and dancers in a King's Theatre season which included the first performances of the famous castrato Pacchierotti. He returned for the following season, but resigned or was discharged on or after 27 December 1779.<br>
<br>From around 1780 Le Texier resumed giving solo readings at his house in Lisle Street. For English audiences his one-man shows had the added allure of being in French. Sylas Neville, describing an evening at Le Texier's in his diary, mentions that &#145;his pronunciation is extremely pure &amp; correct, which makes it an excellent amusement for those who wish to improve themselves in the French language&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>). Another way in which Le Texier helped promote French culture was his publication, between 1785 and 1787, of forty plays by various French playwrights.<br>
<br>Between 1792 and 1798 Le Texier was engaged as gentleman-in-ordinary to the household of the margrave and margravine of Ansbach (formerly Lady Craven) at Brandenburg House. A sort of private theatrical manager, he wrote, acted, directed, and had a decisive part in arranging visual and musical effects. His wife, the Drury Lane dancer Mary Ross, whom he had married by 1793, and his daughter also took part in the presentations he organized.<br>
<br>For the season of 1795&#150;6 Le Texier had been recalled as acting manager at the King's Theatre. On 25 May 1797 he planned and conducted a celebration of the wedding of George III's daughter Princess Charlotte, princess royal, to Prince Friedrich of W&uuml;rttemberg at Ranelagh. On that occasion he was also responsible for a magnificent display of fireworks. Together with Joseph Rossi, an opera dancer, Le Texier had been involved in organizing pyrotechnics since at least 1791.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">True Briton</span> of 10 April 1797 named Le Texier as a bankrupt, but given his many connections this probably did not prevent him from continuing his theatrical activities. However, the remainder of his life was spent in comparative obscurity, and the circumstances of his death in 1814 are unknown.<br>
