<span class="headword">Templeman,  Peter</span>  (1711&#150;1769), <span class="occ">physician and secretary of the Society of Arts</span>, the eldest son of Peter Templeman (<i>d</i>. 1749), a solicitor in Dorchester, Dorset, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Robert Haynes, was born on 17 March 1711, probably in Dorchester and educated at the Charterhouse. Proceeding to Trinity College, Cambridge, in June 1728, he graduated BA with distinction in 1731, and then planned to take holy orders&#151;perhaps with a scholarly career in mind. Deciding on a medical career instead, he took himself off to the Netherlands in June 1735, and the next year enrolled in the University of Leiden, where he attended the lectures of Hermann Boerhaave, but is not listed as having taken a degree. Unless he obtained an MD elsewhere by purchase, &#145;Dr Templeman&#146;, as he was subsequently styled, would seem to have been merely a courtesy usage.<br>
<br>Going to London in 1739 with the intention of building a medical practice, Templeman soon had that intention subverted by his insistent scholarly leanings and preference for the company of men of learning, which combined with a generous allowance from his father to reinforce a disinclination for the active socializing in fashionable circles that was the standard way of securing a remunerative clientele. Much more in character was his joining with a number of fellow spirits in 1741 to form a small medical club, which held its meetings once a fortnight at an inn. Among its members were John Fothergill and a friend whom Templeman had made at Leiden, Matthew Maty. It was to the influential Fothergill that Templeman chose in 1750 to put the idea of starting a society to obtain for its members advance news from all over Europe of improvements in medical practice and knowledge&#151;what would later be known as an abstracts service. Though that suggestion came to nothing, in 1753&#150;4 Templeman published an example of what he had had in mind in the form of translations from French (a language of which he had a complete command) of select papers on matters relating to medicine read before the Acad&eacute;mie Royale des Sciences in Paris. Further translating and editing work, not confined to medicine, followed.<br>
<br>In June 1756 Maty was appointed to the inaugural staff of the British Museum as keeper of its department of printed books. Doubtless with his friend's encouragement, Templeman also applied for a post in the museum, and was rewarded in December 1758 with the keepership of the reading-room. But in contrast to Maty's position, this proved to be not nearly as congenial as he had imagined, requiring him to spend six hours of each working day cooped up in a dark and damp room at the beck and call of readers and with next to no opportunities of pursuing any scholarly work of his own. Worse, the promised apartment within the museum, into which he had looked forward to moving his wife, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1762), and their daughter, he found unacceptably sub-standard, and the outside lodgings allowance that replaced it was not nearly adequate. After his repeated protests had left the trustees quite unmoved, he felt compelled to seek a supplementary means of livelihood and in March 1760 competed successfully for the post of secretary of the recently founded Society of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce. The museum did not require its staff to work for it exclusively and one of the unsuccessful candidates had in fact been Maty, whose lighter museum duties would have made it easy for him to hold the two posts in tandem. The different character of Templeman's post, however, permitted much less leeway; the trustees soon took exception to the lengthy absences from it which his new post entailed and after seven months terminated his employment.<br>
<br>The Society of Arts proved a haven by comparison, and during the nine years Templeman worked for it his abilities were at last fittingly harnessed and to good effect. His most concrete achievement was a projected &#145;historical register&#146; which, though he failed to complete it, became in later hands the first two volumes of the society's <span class="italic">Transactions</span>. He was still hard at work on this in May 1769 when deteriorating health made it necessary for him to be relieved of his duties and sent on indefinite leave. For at least two years would-be successors had been covetously eyeing his post and waiting for it to fall vacant, and on 22 September 1769 their hopes were at last realized when Templeman succumbed to a particularly acute attack of the asthma that had troubled him for most of his life. He was buried on 28 September in St Martin-in-the-Fields, alongside his wife, who had predeceased him in 1762&#151;and &#145;without pomp&#146;, as he had specially requested in his will.<br>
