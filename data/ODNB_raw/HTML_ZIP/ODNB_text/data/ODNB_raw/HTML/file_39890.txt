<span class="headword">Figgures, Sir  Frank Edward</span>  (1910&#150;1990), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born on 5 March 1910 in Merton, London, the only son and elder child of Frank Thomas Figgures, an administrative assistant with the crown agents, and his wife, Alice Biggin. He passed from Rutlish School, Merton, to New College, Oxford, where he took a first class in modern history (1931), became a Harmsworth senior scholar at Merton College (1931), and received a much coveted Henry fellowship to Yale, where he attended the law school in 1933. After being called to the bar (Lincoln's Inn) in 1936, he practised up to the outbreak of the Second World War. There followed military service in the Royal Artillery from 1940 to 1946, where he attained the rank of lieutenant-colonel. His public service began in 1946 with entry to the Treasury. He had a particularly happy start, not only because of the overriding importance of that department, but also because the Treasury was called upon to face quite new policy challenges at home and abroad. This, and the Treasury's traditional tolerance of individualism, was propitious for the exercise of Figgures's special talents and inclinations. He was concerned at once with overseas matters and was seconded to the recently created Organization for European Economic Co-operation (to which was later added &#145;and Development&#146;), the heir of the Marshall plan, in the important post of director of trade and finance (1948&#150;51). There he acquired an abiding skill in multilateral, international negotiation, and the ability to work harmoniously with a group of international public servants and politicians despite the clash of national interests.<br>
<br>In 1951 Figgures returned to the Treasury and was promoted to under-secretary, a post he held from 1955 to 1960. This was the period when the British government had to decide how to deal with the movement for European integration, which would culminate in the treaty of Rome and the creation, by six countries, of the European Economic Community (EEC). Figgures was chosen as the chief developer and first director-general (1960&#150;65) of the British government's European alternative, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), set up in May 1960. In 1964 he branded the British import surcharge policy as &#145;illegal&#146;. To his relief (he had suffered two near-breakdowns), he returned in 1965 to the Treasury as third secretary. He was promoted in 1968 to second permanent secretary, a new post. He retired in 1971.<br>
<br>After his retirement from the civil service Figgures became director-general of the National Economic Development Office (1971&#150;3), at a time when it was hoped that this institution might make a decisive difference to the country's well-being, through developments such as an incomes policy. In 1973 Figgures was chosen to be chairman of the Pay Board, which, however, had no better success in these matters and was wound up after one year. This also marked his definite retirement from the public domain, with the exception of his membership of the BBC General Advisory Council (1978&#150;82), but he continued to be active in the private sector as director and chairman of a number of companies.<br>
<br>Figgures had great abilities, particularly evident in the area of negotiation, especially in international matters. A large and affable man, he had an attractive personality, with a lively, amusing, kind, and understanding disposition. He knew much about music and his slight embonpoint, twinkling eyes, and widely cultured mind made him an agreeable companion. He was appointed CMG in 1959, CB in 1966, and KCB in 1970. He was an honorary DSc of Aston University (1975).<br>
<br>In December 1941 Figgures married Aline Martina, daughter of Professor Hugo Frey, an eminent Viennese laryngologist; they had a son and a daughter. His wife died in 1975, and in the same year he married a friend of the family and a matron at Uppingham School, Ismea, daughter of George Napier Magill, a rubber planter in Malaysia who had died in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp, and widow of John Stanley Barker, a bandleader and entertainment manager. Figgures died on 27 November 1990 in Glaston, Rutland.<br>
