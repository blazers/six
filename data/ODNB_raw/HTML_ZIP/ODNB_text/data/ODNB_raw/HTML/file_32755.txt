<span class="headword">Dawtry,  Frank Dalmeny</span>  (1902&#150;1968), <span class="occ">probation service organizer</span>, was born on 17 January 1902 at 54 Cromwell Street, Walkley, Sheffield, the son of Wycliffe Bright Dawtry, cabinet-maker, and his wife, Alice Jackson Ross. His father was a Unitarian and keen Liberal, who had been apprenticed as a pattern maker by his father, a renowned foundry foreman, when the use of cast iron was at its height. The youngest and most delicate of four brothers, Dawtry won a scholarship to the Sheffield central secondary school, but left at fifteen owing to a breakdown in health. After a period as office boy and later junior clerk in a Sheffield steelworks, he was thrown out of work for almost two years after the trade recession of 1921. This early experience of unemployment made him familiar with the problems faced by the less fortunate members of the community and at this time he became a member of the Independent Labour Party.<br>
<br>In 1923 chance led him to the field of work to which he was to devote his energies for the next forty years. He was appointed clerk bookkeeper to the Sheffield Council of Social Service and within four years became secretary of its personal services committee. At the same time, after a brief apprenticeship with the Wakefield Discharged Prisoners' Aid Society, he was appointed secretary and thus began his close co-operation with the Probation Service. On 19 October 1931 at Port Erin, Isle of Man, Dawtry married Dora Anna, a schoolteacher, whose father, James Robinson Corrin, a local builder and a member of the House of Keys, was appointed MBE on 29 October 1957, the same day as Dawtry, who was advanced to OBE in 1967. They had no children.<br>
<br>Dawtry worked hard to co-ordinate the work of the other local discharged prisoners' aid societies and during this time made weekly visits to both Leeds and Wakefield prisons, where he organized discharge committees and was responsible for the welfare of the prisoners. On the foundation of the National Association of Discharged Prisoners' Aid Societies in 1937 Dawtry was the first to be appointed resident Discharged Prisoners' Aid Society secretary and welfare officer at HM Prison, Wakefield. Additionally he was involved with the first local open prison and the training centre for prison staff. He found a ready acceptance from both prisoners and staff at Wakefield and spent much time visiting and helping prisoners' families. He also travelled extensively, lecturing about prisoners and their needs and enlisting financial support for what was still a voluntary society.<br>
<br>Revised methods of training prisoners were developed, and when the new system was extended to Maidstone prison in 1944 Dawtry was appointed organizer there. However, two years later, feeling that the continued existence of capital punishment in Britain could not be reconciled with his view of the good society, Dawtry resigned and became secretary of the National Council for the Abolition of the Death Penalty. Almost at once he initiated a misleadingly successful campaign, for no sooner had the death penalty been suspended for a trial period than public pressure caused the question to be reconsidered, and it had to be reimposed by the home secretary. However, the number of executions was substantially reduced until the eventual abolition of the death penalty in 1965.<br>
<br>In 1948 Dawtry became general secretary to the National Association of Probation Officers, for which cause he worked untiringly until his retirement in January 1967. He commenced long overdue negotiations on the pay and conditions of service of probation officers. Largely because of his personal influence and his wise and dedicated efforts, the voice of the service was increasingly heard in matters of policy relating to its duties and the prevention and treatment of delinquency. During those years of almost constant change in the scope and nature of its functions, he focused and expressed the view of the service in a way which enabled it to contribute increasingly, from its wealth of practical experience, to the many legislative and other decisions which led to the creation of the modern probation and aftercare service.<br>
<br>For many years, and up to the time of his death, he was on the executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform and an active member of the Institute for the Study and Treatment of Delinquency. He was a founder member of the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders, was equally involved with the National Association for Mental Health, and was on the council of the National Citizens' Advice Bureaux. He was a convinced pacifist and founded the Sheffield No More War movement, serving as secretary until it amalgamated with the Peace Pledge Union, of whose council he was a member. He was also a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts as well as belonging to many other bodies which reflected his concern for peace, justice, and beauty. In May 1963 the University of Leeds conferred on him the degree of master of arts, <i>honoris causa</i>.<br>
<br>After his death at his home, 2 Limes Road, Weybridge, on 5 October 1968, a Frank Dawtry memorial was established whereby a public seminar on a subject in the field of the treatment of offenders, the prevention of crime, and the administration of justice is held regularly in the University of Leeds.<br>
<br>His warmth of personality and love of people, particularly the underdog and the victim of inequality in society, were translated into a life of service without thought of personal reward. To care was to do. He fully understood the importance of political action in furthering the causes for which he was concerned, and had a close association with the House of Commons, where the lord chancellor honoured him with a retirement dinner to express the appreciation of his parliamentary and civil service friends.<br>
<br>He had an intense love of cricket, and for forty years was a keen member of Yorkshire County Cricket Club. His slight figure was familiar and respected on the international scene as well as at the smallest probation branch conference, where his lively mind and imagination were alert to the impact and potential of new ideas. Modest and dedicated, with a keen sense of humour, he was a visionary who translated his visions into achievements, not only for the Probation Service but in the whole field of penology.<br>
