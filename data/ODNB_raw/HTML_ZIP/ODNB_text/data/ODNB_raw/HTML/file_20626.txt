<span class="headword">Ua hAingliu,  Donngus</span> <span class="st"> [Donatus O'Haingli, Donatus]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1095), <span class="occ">bishop of Dublin</span>, used the Latin name Donatus when he was consecrated by Lanfranc, archbishop of Canterbury, in the sixteenth year of his pontificate (that is, some time after 29 August 1085), &#145;at the request and choice of Terdyluacus [Toirdelbach Ua Briain], king of Ireland, and the bishops of Ireland, and the clergy and people of the city of Dublin&#146;  (Gilbert, 2.250). He made a profession of obedience: &#145;I, Donatus, bishop-elect of the church of Dublin in Ireland, promise canonical obedience to you Lanfranc, archbishop of Canterbury, and to your successors&#146;  (Richter, no. 42). According to the <span class="italic">Acta Lanfranci</span>, Donngus had been a monk of Christ Church, Canterbury; he returned to Ireland following his consecration with (not extant) letters of exhortation to the kings and clergy of Ireland. A subsequent letter of Lanfranc's successor, Anselm, reveals that Lanfranc had given Donngus books, vestments, and ornaments for the church of Dublin.<br>
<br>Donngus died of pestilence on 22 November 1095 and was succeeded by his nephew, <a name="cosubject_20626"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Ua hAingliu</span> <span class="st"> [Samuel O'Haingli]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1121)<span class="occ"></span>, who had been trained as a monk at St Albans and was consecrated by Anselm in the church of Winchester on 27 April 1096, making a profession of obedience to him as <i>totius Britanniae primas</i> (&#145;primate of all Britain&#146;). According to Eadmer, Samuel was elected by the clergy and people of Dublin with the assent of &#145;Murierdach&#146; (Muirchertach Ua Briain, king of Munster, overlord of Dublin, and claimant to the high-kingship of Ireland), to whom Anselm sent a letter following Samuel's consecration. Later in the same year, Samuel signed the petition of the clergy and people of Waterford to Anselm requesting consecration of M&aacute;el Is&uacute; Ua hAinmire as bishop of Waterford. About 1101&#150;2, Anselm, in a letter to Samuel transmitted to him via M&aacute;el Is&uacute; Ua hAinmire, made various complaints about his conduct, including: that objects given by Lanfranc to his uncle, Donngus, on the testimony of the monks of Canterbury, were not a personal gift but for the use of the church of Dublin; that he had expelled certain monks from the church of Dublin, who were willing to return but he had refused to readmit them; and that he should desist from having his cross carried before him on journeys since this was a right reserved to archbishops who had been confirmed with the pall from the pope. Samuel appears to have been claiming archiepiscopal status. He died on 4 July 1121. A sepulchral monument in St Michan's Church, Dublin, which has been suggested as his, is certainly not contemporaneous with his death.<br>
