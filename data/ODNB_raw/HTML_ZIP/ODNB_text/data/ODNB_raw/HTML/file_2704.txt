</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blow,  John</span>  (1648?&#150;1708), <span class="occ">musician and composer</span>, was baptized at St Mary Magdalene, Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, on 23 February 1649. The record of his doctorate at Lambeth Palace confirms the identification; the age on his marriage allegation suggests that he was born in 1648. He was the second of three children of Henry Blow, who in 1646 married Katherine Langwith, a widow, at Newark, where other members of the family are also recorded. John Blow's recruitment into the Chapel Royal points to early musical training, perhaps under John Hinton, the master of Thomas Magnus's song school in Newark.<br>
<br>Blow may have been one of five boys from Newark and Lincoln for whose procurement Henry Cooke, the master of the children of the Chapel Royal, was reimbursed under a warrant of 4 July 1661. An entry of 1665 in the accounts of the treasurer of the chamber describes the education of Chapel Royal boys, which included Latin, writing, and playing on instruments. Blow's memorial at Westminster Abbey states that he was a pupil of Christopher Gibbons, who at the Restoration became an organist of the Chapel Royal and organist of Westminster Abbey (where he was also master of the choristers, 1664&#150;6); Hawkins adds that Blow was first a pupil of the court musician John Hingeston, formerly Cromwell's organist and master of music. Blow was clearly an apt scholar, for James Clifford's <span class="italic">Divine Services and Anthems</span> (1664) contains the words of three of his anthems, and he joined two other boys, Pelham Humfrey and William Turner, in composing &#145;I will alway give thanks&#146;.<br>
<br>Blow's voice broke towards the end of 1664, payments for his maintenance after dismissal from the chapel being authorized from 25 December. His voice had not recovered by 21 August 1667, when with another of Cooke's boys he visited Samuel Pepys, who noted their &#145;extraordinary skill&#146;, notwithstanding which &#145;to hear them sing with their broken voices, which they could not command to keep in tune, would make a man mad, so bad it was&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer16681680"></a>Early career, 1668&#150;1680</h2>Blow evidently continued his musical studies, and in 1668 was appointed organist of Westminster Abbey, succeeding Albertus Bryne, who had become organist in 1666 when Gibbons vacated both his abbey posts. Blow's oath on appointment was taken on 3 December, though the abbey's accounts misleadingly record his payment from the previous Michaelmas.<br>
<br>Blow also obtained posts at court. He was admitted as a musician for the virginals from 25 March 1669, although there is no sign of the appointment's confirmation until 30 October 1674, when payment was ordered in consideration of his liveries for 1669&#150;73. A warrant listing musicians of the Chapel Royal and string players who attended the king at Windsor from May to July 1671 includes Blow as organist; possibly he held an extraordinary post in the chapel, since the cheque book says he was sworn in as a gentleman (but not yet as an organist) on 16 March 1674. The large-scale anthem &#145;When Israel came out of Egypt&#146; appears to have resulted from the new appointment. Further offices came Blow's way with the death on 14 July 1674 of Pelham Humfrey, who had followed Cooke as master of the children and to whose role Blow now succeeded. A warrant for his admission, dated 23 July, also granted him Humfrey's post of composer for voices in the king's private music.<br>
<br>Besides his now extensive official duties, Blow was active in the Corporation of Musick, a society of court musicians on which a royal charter conferred unrealistically wide powers over other professionals. His signature occurs frequently in the corporation's minute book from 1673 to 1679; on 26 June 1673 he was elected one of two wardens for the ensuing year, and he was again a warden in 1676&#150;7.<br>
<br>In 1674 Blow married Elizabeth Braddock (<i>d</i>. 1683) at St Paul's, Covent Garden: on 4 September according to the parish register, though the marriage allegation (giving his age as about twenty-six, hers as about twenty) is dated 23 September. Elizabeth's father, Edward Braddock, was master of the choristers of Westminster Abbey, and a gentleman of the Chapel Royal and clerk of the cheque. By 1683 the Blows lived in Great Sanctuary, where Braddock already lived, and Blow remained there for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Marmaduke Alford states that Blow became one of the organists of the Chapel Royal following Gibbons's death on 20 October 1676. Just over a year later, on 10 December 1677, Blow was created a doctor of music by the dean and chapter of Canterbury Cathedral (the archbishopric being vacant). Some two years after that he relinquished his post as organist of the abbey, perhaps because of his other duties, or because Henry Purcell, whom Blow's memorial and Henry Hall's verse in <span class="italic">Amphion Anglicanus</span> describe as his pupil, was ready for the post. The abbey's annual accounts for the year ending Michaelmas 1679 record payments to Blow, and the next set names Purcell as organist; as with Blow's appointment, this may be misleading and Purcell may have taken over in the course of 1679&#150;80.<br>
<br>Official records contain much evidence of Blow's presence as a liveried musician at court, though they also show that, like other servants of the king, he often experienced long delays in payments due to him. As master of the children Blow was charged with seeing that the choristers were housed, fed, clothed, and cared for when sick, and with seeking new boys for the chapel. Their academic and musical training was his responsibility, a by-product of which may be his treatise on thorough bass (BL, Add. MS 34072). Testimony to Blow's effectiveness as a teacher is found in the careers of William Croft, Jeremiah Clarke, and others among his pupils.<br>
<br>Blow's industry as a composer was great, and a document detailing his music copied for the Chapel Royal in the period 1670&#150;76 lists two services, a <span class="roman">Benedicite</span> and <span class="roman">Te Deum</span>, and nine anthems. In fact, by 1680 he had written over thirty anthems, many with instrumental accompaniments such as Charles II favoured, though his output decreased markedly once Purcell started to share the burden. The stamp of Blow's personality is firmly impressed on his early sacred music, despite the initial influence of Matthew Locke and Humfrey. His anthems contain much of his finest work, skilfully incorporating a variety of styles, and while unevenness must be admitted, a breadth of conception is undeniable. Blow's compositions for special occasions began with &#145;O Lord, I have sinned&#146; for General Monck's abbey funeral in 1670. Almost every year from 1678 to the end of the century he provided a court ode marking the new year, and he wrote seven further odes celebrating royal birthdays; these contain fine moments but betray a sense of duty and only fitful engagement.<br>
<br>Blow's early work as a songwriter is represented in the second book of <span class="italic">Choice Ayres &amp; Songs</span> (1679), one of more than a dozen song collections to include his music during his lifetime. Blow's duties as a performer are revealed only in part by his extant compositions for keyboard, and while many of his organ and harpsichord pieces presumably date from his early years, most are found in later sources.<h2>
<a name="Yearsofmaturity16811700"></a>Years of maturity, 1681&#150;1700</h2>Blow's <span class="italic">Venus and Adonis</span> may have been performed before the court at Oxford in 1681. It reflects Blow's knowledge of Lully's stage works, and notwithstanding its small scale may be accounted the first true English opera; the passionate dialogue in act <span class="smallcap">III</span> is among Blow's finest achievements. He never attempted another piece of the kind, and its natural successor is Purcell's <span class="italic">Dido and Aeneas</span>.<br>
<br>In mid-1682 Blow and Nicholas Staggins, the master of the king's musick, jointly obtained a post &#145;for the composition and practize of the violins&#146;. In April 1683 they petitioned the king for a licence permitting them to set up an &#145;Academy or Opera of Musick&#146; where their compositions might be performed, but it seems that action was stayed. While Staggins was responsible for music in the secular sphere, it is clear that Blow by now had overall charge of the chapel's music. Although he was the junior organist until Purcell replaced Edward Lowe in 1682, his other senior colleague, William Child, was elderly, and it was to Blow that Staggins was instructed in 1683 to send the instrumental musicians required for practising anthems.<br>
<br>On 29 October 1683 Elizabeth Blow died in childbirth, aged about thirty, and she was buried two days later in the abbey's north cloister. She had borne five children, all of whom were buried at the abbey. Four died unmarried: Henry (<i>d</i>. 1676), John (<i>d</i>. 1693), Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1730), and Mary (<i>d</i>. 1738), who was buried in her father's grave. The wills of Catherine and Mary are extant; the latter's legatees include her cousin Elizabeth Blow of Theobald's Park, Hertfordshire. Another daughter, Elizabeth, died in 1719, four months after marrying William Edgeworth at St Anne's, Soho; during her brief marriage she wrote her name in a book (Brussels conservatory, MS 15418) into which, about 1700, her father had copied German keyboard music (reflecting his lifelong interest in the work of other composers), she herself adding part of one of his grounds.<br>
<br>Blow was still comparatively young and continued to work with vigour. In 1684 he composed <span class="italic">Begin the Song</span>, his first ode for the Musical Society's annual celebration of St Cecilia's day; others followed in 1691, 1695 (when he also supplied a <span class="roman">Te Deum</span> and <span class="roman">Jubilate</span>, with trumpets and strings), and 1700. In 1684, too, Blow and Purcell joined in demonstrating an organ built for the Temple Church by Bernard Smith, in competition with Renatus Harris&#151;a contest not decided in Smith's favour until the winter of 1687&#150;8. Smith and Blow were to share the post of tuner of the royal instruments, which fell vacant when Purcell died in 1695. In 1708 it became Blow's alone, following Smith's death.<br>
<br>Blow and Purcell worked closely together on music for James II's coronation in 1685, though Blow's three anthems, including the broadly conceived &#145;God spake sometime in visions&#146;, were the largest contribution by any composer. In a review of court posts conducted in the new reign, Blow kept his places in the Chapel Royal, and a composer's place in the private musick; that of virginalist went to Purcell, but Blow regained it after Purcell's death. In 1687 Blow assumed another responsibility with the death of Michael Wise, almoner and master of the choristers at St Paul's since the choir's reconstitution in Wren's unfinished building. Blow took Wise's place, in 1697 producing the instrumental anthem &#145;I was glad&#146; for the consecration of the chancel, and, to celebrate the treaty of Ryswick during the same service, &#145;Praise the Lord, O my soul&#146; with organ accompaniment only. He remained in the post until 1703. On 28 November that year the dean and chapter resolved that Jeremiah Clarke should replace Blow, who was to surrender his patent; Clarke's indenture is dated 11 January 1704.<br>
<br>Compared with James II's coronation service, that of William III in 1689 was musically less demanding, and Blow's principal work, &#145;The Lord God is a sun&#146;, is accordingly modest. William's visit to the Netherlands in 1691, accompanied by a group of musicians, was the only occasion on which Blow and Purcell are known to have left England. Purcell's death in 1695 meant that composition for state occasions fell mainly to Blow; but he still found time for other activities. In 1698 he was a steward of the Festival of the Sons of the Clergy, supplying the somewhat dry &#145;Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord&#146;; in 1702 he reused part of this in the notably fresh &#145;O sing unto the Lord a new song&#146;, for a charitable concert at Stationers' Hall. Purcell's death also left vacant the organist's post at Westminster Abbey, to which Blow was immediately recalled. Purcell died on 21 November, and a week later the <span class="italic">Post Boy</span> reported Blow's reappointment. In March 1700 he was admitted to a new post of composer for the Chapel Royal (the cheque book's &#145;1699&#146; is clarified by Bodl. Oxf., MS Mus. E. 17).<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>Blow's long series of odes ended in 1700 with <span class="italic">Appear, Appear in All thy Pomp</span> for the new year and <span class="italic">Come, Bring the Song</span> for Princess Anne's birthday. When Anne was crowned in 1702 Blow seems merely to have adapted two earlier coronation anthems. Although many of his late anthems are short, sober, polyphonic pieces for full choir (perhaps a response to King James's institution of a Catholic chapel with its own musicians, and to a direction of 1691 that the Chapel Royal should have &#145;solemn musick like a collegiate church&#146;), the years 1703&#150;7 saw the composition for official functions of six elaborate instrumental anthems with florid vocal solos. While tonal planning was never Blow's strongest point, these pieces manifest a well-developed architectural sense despite their relatively independent movements.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life Blow prepared some of his music for publication. <span class="italic">Amphion Anglicanus</span> (1700), &#145;for one, two, three and four voices, with several accompagnements&#146;, is modelled on <span class="italic">Orpheus Britannicus</span> (1698), a posthumous collection of Purcell's songs; but while Blow shared Purcell's musical ideals and often his manner, his work frequently suffers by comparison. Blow's songs too often lack harmonic and melodic certainty; yet a few, such as &#145;The Self-Banished&#146;, have worn well, and a genuinely rich vein of expression is found in pieces like the deeply felt <span class="italic">Ode on the Death of Mr. Henry Purcell</span>.<br>
<br>Blow's harpsichord pieces appeared in several anthologies, starting with <span class="italic">The Second Part of Musicks Hand-Maid</span> (1689), but he may himself have planned <span class="italic">A Choice Collection of Lessons</span> (1698), where he is the only composer represented. His suites show familiarity with French harpsichord music and a wish to emulate the Italian musicians living in London. They share the weaknesses of his songs, but nevertheless contain much that is interesting and attractive. Blow's organ music remained unpublished in his lifetime, except for his settings of psalm tunes (printed in 1703, though the surviving copy is a reprint of <i>c</i>.1730). The body of Blow's organ works is larger than that of any of his contemporaries; while rooted in the tradition handed on by Gibbons and Locke, his pieces reveal a keen awareness of developments abroad (three in fact quote from Frescobaldi).<br>
<br>The best of Blow's music is to be found in his sacred works, where he appears as a composer of considerable stature, both imaginative and innovative, as the short &#145;Cry aloud, and spare not&#146; demonstrates. A number of such pieces survive in autograph copies (listed by Shaw), but his intention of publishing some, expressed in the dedication of <span class="italic">Amphion Anglicanus</span>, remained unfulfilled. Blow's memorial rightly focuses attention on his church music as his principal legacy. Even Charles Burney, who failed to recognize Blow's historical position and whose condemnation of &#145;Dr. Blow's crudities&#146; was excessive, acknowledged that &#145;Some of his choral productions are doubtless in a very bold and grand style&#146;. Despite Blow's shortcomings, attributable in part to his intensive labours over more than thirty years, he was second only to Purcell among English composers of his day.<br>
<br>Glimpses of Blow's friendships with colleagues are afforded by their wills. He received mourning rings under those of John Harding (1684) and John Twiss (1687). He witnessed the will of Richard Hart in 1689, and in 1702 was an overseer of the will of Moses Snow, who bequeathed him a guinea piece of gold. Blow made his own will on 3 January 1708, observing that he was sick. His father-in-law, Edward Braddock, who still held his posts at the abbey and in the Chapel Royal, died on 12 June. Blow himself did not die until 1 October 1708; he is presumed to have died at his home in Great Sanctuary, Westminster. The words &#145;in the 60th year of his age&#146; on his memorial must mean &#145;aged sixty&#146;. The abbey's register states that he was buried in the north aisle on 8 October, &#145;against the door going up to the organ&#146;. His will was proved on 14 October by his daughters, to whom he left most of his property, including several leases and a copyhold estate at Hampton in Middlesex.<br>
<br>Hawkins, who probably heard it from those who remembered Blow, said he was &#145;a very handsome man in his person, and remarkable for a gravity and decency in his deportment&#146;. Robert White's engraving in <span class="italic">Amphion Anglicanus</span> was drawn from life, and incorporates the arms adopted by Blow. Of the other pictures said to portray Blow (all in private collections), probably only a half-length by John Riley has a claim to authenticity; a small head attributed to Lely or Riley and an oval head and shoulders attributed to Closterman are reportedly spurious.<br>
