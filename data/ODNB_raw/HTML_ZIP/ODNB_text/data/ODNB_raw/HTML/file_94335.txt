<span class="headword">Hailey,  Arthur Frederick</span>  (1920&#150;2004), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 5 April 1920 at 107 Albert Road, Luton, Bedfordshire, the only child of George Wellington Hailey (1883&#150;1973), a factory storekeeper, and his wife, Elsie May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wright (1887&#150;1974), who had started work as a maid while she was a child. At the age of ten he began writing poems, plays, short stories, and &#145;incredibly pompous&#146;  letters to the <span class="italic">Luton News</span>  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 23 June 1990). He was educated at Surrey Street School, Luton, where he excelled at English but failed at mathematics. His poor results in this subject prevented him from gaining a scholarship to grammar school and he was obliged to start work in 1934. He did a variety of jobs until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, when he enlisted in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. He undertook pilot training in the United States and was posted to Canada as a flying instructor. He also saw active service in the Middle East and flew transport aircraft from Poona, India, in June 1945. In the previous year Hailey had married Joan Fishwick, with whom, over the next five years, he had three sons. Having returned to England in 1945, he was employed as editor of <span class="italic">Air Clues</span>, an aircraft training magazine for the Air Ministry. He was demobilized in 1947 with the rank of flight lieutenant and an air efficiency award, but quickly became disillusioned with the austerity of life in post-war Britain under Attlee's Labour government.<br>
<br>In 1947 the Haileys emigrated to Canada, where he held a commission as a flight lieutenant in the Royal Canadian Air Force Reserve. Just before Christmas 1949 Joan left him, though the couple were to remain on good terms. That year, and following a stint as an estate agent, he had become editor of a trade magazine, <span class="italic">Bus and Truck Transport</span>. In July 1951, having been divorced from his first wife, he married London-born Sheila Dunlop (<i>b</i>. 1927), who worked as a stenographer in the magazine's office. She was the daughter of James Watt Dunlop, a tailor's cutter. They had two daughters and a son. In 1952 Hailey became a Canadian citizen, though he kept his British passport, and a year later he took a job as a sales promotion manager for a trailer manufacturer, Canadian Trailmobile, which he held until 1956.<br>
<br>In his spare time Hailey wrote television plays and pitched them, without success, to the networks. His luck changed in 1955 when, during a flight between Toronto and Vancouver, he wondered what might happen if the pilot was taken ill with food poisoning and a wartime pilot like himself was required to land the plane. Over nine days Hailey wrote a one-hour television play, <span class="italic">Flight into Danger</span>, which was immediately bought by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for $600. It was shown in April 1956 and was subsequently picked up by NBC in the United States and later by the BBC. Now a full-time writer, his success continued with the television drama <span class="italic">Time Lock</span> (1957), about a child trapped in a bank vault, which was filmed in England and featured an early performance by Sean Connery. A year later he co-wrote <span class="italic">Zero Hour</span>, the feature film version of <span class="italic">Flight into Danger</span>, and also co-wrote its novelization, which was published in the USA as <span class="italic">Runway Zero-Eight</span>. It later became the reference point for the popular spoof disaster film <span class="italic">Airplane!</span> (1980). Hailey's first solo novel, <span class="italic">The Final Diagnosis</span>, followed in 1959 and was based on his television play about a hospital pathologist who accidentally causes the death of a child.<br>
<br>Hailey's first &#145;blockbuster&#146; novel, <span class="italic">Hotel</span> (1965), took him more than five years of research and writing, during which time he read numerous books about the hotel trade and interviewed many workers in the hospitality industry, though he never made notes when he interviewed people for his novels. Meticulous research became a characteristic of his most successful novels. In the opinion of the author Anthony Burgess, &#145;When book-buyers buy books, they look for sex, violence and hard information. They get these from Arthur Hailey, whose characters discuss problems of hotel management while committing adultery before being beaten up&#146;  (A. Burgess, <span class="italic">You've Had Your Time</span>, 1990, 25). <span class="italic">Hotel</span> became a film in 1966 and was later made into a television series for which Hailey received $100,000 per episode. The book's success allowed Hailey and his family to move to the Napa Valley in California. For his next, and perhaps most successful, novel he returned to the world of air travel with <span class="italic">Airport</span> (1968), the suspenseful story of a plane with a bomb and an airport closed by snow. In 1970 it became a very popular film starring Burt Lancaster and Dean Martin, and it was the progenitor of a series of disaster films during the 1970s.<br>
<br>In 1969 the Haileys moved to Lyford Cay on New Providence Island in the Bahamas, initially for two years to avoid high taxes. The island became their permanent home. During the next decade he published three more novels: <span class="italic">Wheels</span> (1971)&#151;a depiction of the Detroit motor industry&#151;made him the first writer to receive a $1 million advance, and was followed by <span class="italic">The Moneychangers</span> (1975) and <span class="italic">Overlord</span> (1979). He then announced his retirement as an author following his diagnosis with severe heart problems and in 1983 underwent a quadruple heart bypass. Following his operation he grew fearful of moving or taking part in any activity, should it prompt his death, until his wife told him she would rather he lived five years normally than twenty years &#145;tiptoeing on eggshells&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 27 Nov 2004). In the following decade he returned to writing and published three novels, <span class="italic">Strong Medicine</span> (1984), <span class="italic">The Evening News</span> (1990), and <span class="italic">Detective</span> (1997). He maintained his earlier working methods and close attention to detail. His research for <span class="italic">The Evening News</span>, for example, included a trip to the Peruvian jungle on the trail of rebel guerrillas.<br>
<br>Hailey's success and popularity were extraordinary. His eleven novels, sales of which numbered an estimated 160 million copies, were published in thirty-nine languages in forty countries. By contrast critics were typically dismissive of what they considered his laborious, repetitious prose and weak characterization. Hailey himself acknowledged his debt to his research methods&#151;and his fostering of a much imitated genre of &#145;factional&#146; literature&#151;claiming that &#145;I don't think I really invented anybody. I have drawn on real life&#146;  (Associated Press, 16 Dec 2001). In her memoir <span class="italic">I Married a Best Seller</span> (1978) Sheila Hailey described her husband as &#145;temperamental, ruthless, sensitive, impatient, emotional, unreasonable, demanding, self-centred, and excessively hard-working &hellip; also precise, pig-headed, fastidious, fanatically clean, maniacally tidy&#146;  (Hailey, 5). He died on 24 November 2004 in the Bahamas. He was survived by his wife, Sheila, their three children, and the three sons of his first marriage.<br>
