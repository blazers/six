<span class="headword">Stanegrave, Sir  Roger</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1280s&#150;1331), <span class="occ">soldier and writer</span>, probably took his name from Stonegrave in the North Riding of Yorkshire, but the details of his early life are obscure. Perhaps he was related to the John of Stonegrave whose inquisition post mortem of 1295 shows him to have been a landowner in Lincolnshire as well as Yorkshire, with tenurial links to the families of Paynel, Ros, and Percy. During the 1280s Roger Stanegrave was stationed at a hospitaller garrison in the embattled kingdom of Jerusalem during the reign of Hugh III of Cyprus and Jerusalem (<i>r</i>. 1267&#150;84), and suffered capture and imprisonment by the mamelukes some time before the end of the decade. By his own account, he remained a prisoner for over thirty years, obtaining release only in the summer of 1318 when he was given leave to raise his ransom in England. On 12 December 1318 an unusual royal safe conduct was issued to Stanegrave (who is described as a knight) and his travelling companion, Isaac the Jew. Under its terms Isaac, the financier of Stanegrave's release and presumably a native of the Levant, was permitted to journey to Yorkshire, where the old hospitaller planned to repay his debt with money raised from relatives and friends. These special measures notwithstanding, twelve months later Stanegrave was still in arrears and Isaac was awarded a second licence to stay in the realm for a further year.<br>
<br>Stanegrave's plight came to the attention of the king's circle at the York parliament of January 1320. In an audience with Edward II he moved the court with stories of his long captivity in squalid mameluke prisons. He told of his steadfast refusal to apostatize despite the cruellest beating, gave news of other hospitaller knights still held captive, and spoke of his huge ransom of 10,000 gold florins. Thirty years after the fall of Acre in 1291 talk of an expedition to recover the Holy Land continued to feature in Edward II's diplomacy, and the elderly hospitaller must have cut a sensational figure at a court eager to assert its crusading credentials throughout western Europe. Indeed, so pitiful was his testimony that on 10 January 1320 Edward II sent separate letters on Stanegrave's behalf to Pope John XXII, the cardinals, and the master of the Hospital of St John. From the pope Edward asked for an indulgence for all who should contribute to Stanegrave's ransom, and that of other Christians languishing in Egyptian prisons. He also requested that Stanegrave be provided for life to the custody of a house of the hospitallers in the bishopric of Lincoln, thereby enabling him both to recover from his afflictions and to pay his ransom. Thus maintained, it can be guessed, Stanegrave spent his final years reflecting on his experiences in the East and composing the impressive crusading treatise <span class="italic">Li charboclois d'armes du conquest precious de la terre sainte de promission</span>, which he presented to Edward III shortly after plans for an Anglo-French crusade were announced in late 1331.<br>
<br>Crammed with practical advice, the <span class="italic">Charboclois</span> follows the lead of better-known crusade proposals, like Marino Sanudo Torsello's <span class="italic">Liber secretorum fidelium crucis</span> (1321) or Pierre Dubois's <span class="italic">De recuperatione terre sancte</span> (1306), thereby contributing to the debate over how best to tackle the Muslim threat and recover the Holy Land. Made up of seventy short chapters featuring stories from medieval romance, the classics, and crusading history, as well as the usual calls to action, the bulk of the text is given over to a detailed plan for a campaign aimed at the Egyptian city-port of Alexandria. From here, Stanegrave argues, a fleet could sail up the Nile to attack Cairo before assailing the northern city of Damietta, thus breaking the mameluke grip over the region. Having spent seven years of his captivity in Alexandria, Stanegrave's knowledge of the local defences was probably quite accurate. Amid the detail there is much of associated interest, including a survey of the region's climate and topography. Stanegrave also provides an analysis of mameluke military strength, warning that the sultan housed in his palace 20,000 youths aged between eight and eighteen, each training with weapons three days a week and being schooled in Koranic law the rest of the time. Here, however, the aged hospitaller's account is probably based as much upon rumour as upon intelligence gathered through an Egyptian prison window. But whatever its appeal, there is no evidence that Stanegrave's book made a lasting impression upon its intended audience. Few theoretical crusading proposals had any discernible influence, and this treatise is likely to have been valued as much for its encyclopaedic, geographical, and historical material as for its specialist crusade information. At any rate, with the outbreak of the Hundred Years' War in 1337 Edward III's plans for a crusade were permanently shelved. The <span class="italic">Charboclois</span>, on the other hand, may have been consulted from time to time: the text, collected with other writings on Islam and the Orient, survives in one late fourteenth-century manuscript (BL, Cotton MS Otho D.v, badly damaged by the fire of 1731).<br>
