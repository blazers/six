<span class="headword">Skeat,  Walter William</span>  (1866&#150;1953), <span class="occ">colonial administrator and ethnographer</span>, was born at 22 Regent Street, Cambridge, on 14 October 1866, the elder son in the family of two sons and four daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36116/', "Walter William Skeat (1835&#150;1912)")</script>, philologist, and his wife, Bertha Clara, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones (1840&#150;1924); his elder sister was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58483/', "Bertha Marian Skeat")</script>, the schoolmistress [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36116/', "Skeat, Walter William")</script>]. His father, a clergyman with a degree in mathematics, was a fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge, and in 1878 was appointed professor of Anglo-Saxon; he collaborated with James Murray in the compilation of the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span>. After education at Weybridge preparatory school, London, and Highgate School, London, Skeat became a student at Christ's College, where he read classics, graduating in 1888. What later became social anthropology was at this time a discipline that emphasized the need to record in a systematic fashion the elements of primitive and traditional societies, which were already beginning to change or disappear under the pressure of the &#145;civilized&#146; world. It is evident that this approach, advocated by Alfred Haddon, later a fellow of Christ's, had much influence on Skeat's ethnographic work in Malaya.<br>
<br>Skeat secured a nomination to the Selangor civil service in 1891, where he began his tenure under William Edward Maxwell, then resident of the state and an outstanding Malay scholar who recognized Skeat's potential. Throughout his six years (1891&#150;7) in Selangor, Skeat showed himself a capable and hardworking administrator in several districts of the state. He also found time for steady ethnographic work, at first in collaboration with Richard James Wilkinson, a Cambridge contemporary, in the latter's Malay dictionary project, and later in his own fieldwork, which took him on trips into remote parts of the state. He published a number of articles in local journals. When he returned on leave to England in 1898, Haddon and others supported Skeat's project for a scientific expedition to north-east Malaya, then under Siamese suzerainty, to survey the lifestyle, fauna, and flora of an almost unknown region. The expedition was a success until towards the end, when Skeat left his companions to set off alone on an ill judged attempt to climb Gunong Tahan, the highest peak in the peninsula. The hardship of the ascent so damaged Skeat's health (by recurrent malaria) that he became permanently unfit for further service in the tropics and was obliged to retire from the Malayan service.<br>
<br>After sufficient recovery in his health Skeat was able to work in England for thirty more years, but it was a struggle to find suitable employment and to support a family; on 15 April 1903 he had married (Mary Emmeline) Theodora Duckworth (1874&#150;1956), daughter of Henry Duckworth, gentleman, and they had three sons. Skeat was a good anthropologist, but in that new discipline the few opportunities went to men of the standing of Haddon, Sir Edward Tylor, and Charles Seligman. From 1903 to 1911 Skeat held administrative posts in the University of London. Then, after a further bout of illness, he was appointed in 1913 a &#145;guide-lecturer&#146; at the British Museum. After a spell in the Colonial Office library during the First World War he returned to the British Museum, where he became the principal lecturer to parties visiting the ethnographic gallery, and brought to the task both scholarship and enthusiasm that earned him praise, until his retirement in 1934. He then moved to Dawlish in Devon.<br>
<br>Skeat's best, and best-known, work was <span class="italic">Malay Magic</span>, a title that concealed an extensive study of Malay culture and belief. This had been written during a year's leave from Malaya in 1898 and was published by Macmillan in 1900, to critical acclaim but poor sales. In 1906 came <span class="italic">Pagan Races of the Malay Peninsula</span> (to which Charles Otto Blagden contributed chapters on aborigine dialects). In a lighter vein Skeat wrote <span class="italic">Fables and Folk-Tales from an Eastern Forest</span> (1901), which is said to have been a model for Rudyard Kipling's <span class="italic">Just So Stories</span>. He also contributed numerous articles to journals and chapters in popular books on south-east Asian lifestyles. In 1938 he produced a reader's guide to the poems of John Milton, and finally edited for publication (in 1953) the long and informative journal of his 1899 expedition. As an ethnographer he concentrated on description, though he subscribed to Tyler's theory of &#145;animism&#146;, which attributed to primitive minds a belief that plants, animals, and even substances possessed a spiritual force or &#145;soul&#146;, that in anthropomorphic fashion might be benign or hostile to mankind, so that manipulation or invocation was necessary to secure a favourable outcome. By his quick and sensitive understanding Skeat recorded valuable data (including charms and invocations) for modern analysis, so that <span class="italic">Malay Magic</span> was reprinted more than once, including in 1984 and 2005.<br>
<br>A tall figure, and a quiet and congenial colleague, Skeat was a scholar of talent and immense industry who would have achieved greater recognition and success in his own time if chance had been kinder to him in his health and the career opportunities open to him. He died on 24 July 1953 at St Pancras Hospital, London, of pneumonia and pulmonary tuberculosis, and was cremated at Golders Green five days later. His collection of books and pamphlets was donated to the Institute of Cultural and Social Anthropology at the University of Oxford.<br>
<br>Skeat's son, <a name="cosubject_92270"></a><span class="headword">Theodore Cressy Skeat</span>  (1907&#150;2003), <span class="occ">palaeographer and librarian</span>, was born on 15 February 1907 at Romeland Cottage, St Albans, Hertfordshire. From Whitgift School, Croydon, he went to Christ's College, Cambridge, and then spent the years 1929&#150;31 at the British School of Archaeology in Athens. In 1931 he joined the department of manuscripts at the British Museum as an assistant keeper. He became deputy keeper in 1948 and keeper (and Egerton librarian) in 1961, remaining in that post until his retirement in 1972. On 30 April 1942 he married Nellie (Olive) Martin (1904/5&#150;1992), daughter of Thomas Bertie Martin, coal merchant; they had one child, a son, Jonathan. Among Skeat's earliest publications were (with H. Idris Bell) <span class="italic">Fragments of an Unknown Gospel</span> (1935), an edition of the apocryphal gospel later known as the <span class="roman">Egerton 2 papyrus</span>, and (with H. J. M. Milne) <span class="italic">Scribes and Correctors of the Codex Sinaiticus</span> (1938). There followed almost 100 published articles and books on all aspects of ancient book production from dictation to the cost of papyrus, including a magisterial chapter on early Christian book production in the <span class="italic">Cambridge History of the Bible</span> (1969) and (with Colin Roberts) <span class="italic">The Birth of the Codex</span> (1983). Skeat was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1963, but renounced his fellowship in 1980 in protest at the academy's conduct in the Anthony Blunt affair. A modest, even shy man, he disliked the attendant publicity. In retirement he lived in Ealing, London. He died at Ealing Hospital, Southall, on 25 June 2003, of bronchopneumonia. He was survived by his son.<br>
