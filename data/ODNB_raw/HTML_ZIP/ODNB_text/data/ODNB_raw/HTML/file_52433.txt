<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dvo&#345;&aacute;k,  Anton&iacute;n Leopold</span>  (1841&#150;1904), <span class="occ">composer and conductor</span>, was born on 8 September 1841 in Nelahozeves, to the north of Prague, the eldest of nine children of Franti&#353;ek Dvo&#345;&aacute;k (1814&#150;1894), musician, butcher, and innkeeper, and his wife, Anna Zde&#328;kov&aacute; (1820&#150;1882). Recognition of his early musical talent led to his being sent at the age of twelve to Zlonice, where his studies continued under the local organist, Anton&iacute;n Liehmann. At the age of fifteen he went to &#268;esk&aacute; Kamenice in North Bohemia, to improve his German prior to entering the Prague organ school in 1857. Dvo&#345;&aacute;k was an excellent pupil, and after graduating in 1859 he embarked on a freelance career in Prague as piano teacher, viola player, and composer.<br>
<br>Although, thanks to the recommendations of Brahms, Dvo&#345;&aacute;k began to have some small recognition outside Bohemia by 1876, it was his subsequent popularity in Great Britain which was to establish him as an international composer and brought him his later invitation to America. This came about through nine visits between 1884 and 1896, supported by special relationships with Henry and Alfred Littleton of the firm of Novello, Ewer &amp; Co., as well the (Royal) Philharmonic Society. On 17 November 1873 Dvo&#345;&aacute;k had married Anna Franti&#353;ka &#268;erm&aacute;kov&aacute;. Under the impact of the tragic loss of their first three children between 1876 and 1877, he composed his <span class="italic">Stabat mater</span> (op. 58; Burghauser 71), and it was this work which first brought him to England. Although a number of his orchestral pieces, including the <span class="italic">Slavonic Dances</span> (op. 48; <span class="smallcap">B</span>83), piano concerto (op. 33; <span class="smallcap">B</span>63), and symphony no. 6 (op. 60; <span class="smallcap">B</span>112), had been heard in London at the concerts of Hans Richter and August Manns, the discovery by the great British amateur choral societies that Dvo&#345;&aacute;k had written fine choral works increased the interest. In March 1884 Dvo&#345;&aacute;k reached England for the first time, and conducted his <span class="italic">Stabat mater</span> in the Royal Albert Hall as well as orchestral concerts at the Crystal Palace, both to great public acclaim. His success resulted in immediate commissions from the Philharmonic Society and the Birmingham and Leeds festivals. In September 1884 he returned to conduct his <span class="italic">Stabat mater</span> and symphony no. 6 at Worcester, for the Three Choirs festival and the 800th anniversary of the founding of the cathedral.<br>
<br>Dvo&#345;&aacute;k's third visit was in April 1885, to conduct the first performance of his symphony no. 7 (op. 70; <span class="smallcap">B</span>141), commissioned by the Philharmonic Society, at St James's Hall, Piccadilly. In August 1885 he was back with another new work written for Britain, this time conducting the premi&egrave;re of his cantata <span class="italic">Svatebn&iacute; ko&#353;ile</span> (<span class="italic">The Spectre's Bride</span>) (op. 69; <span class="smallcap">B</span>135) for the Birmingham festival. In October 1886 he conducted another new commission, his oratorio <span class="italic">Svata Ludmil&aacute;</span> (<span class="italic">St Ludmila</span>) (op. 71; <span class="smallcap">B</span>144), for the Leeds triennial festival, followed by an orchestral concert in Birmingham. While in Birmingham, Dvo&#345;&aacute;k accepted a further commission for a choral work for the 1888 festival, and <span class="italic">The Dream of Gerontius</span> was suggested. In the event, it was not until 1891 that this commission was completed, and was to be not <span class="italic">Gerontius</span> but his <span class="roman">Requiem</span> (op. 89; <span class="smallcap">B</span>165). While, in the first part of <span class="italic">St Ludmila</span>, it is possible to trace Dvo&#345;&aacute;k's debt to the English oratorio tradition from Handel, his own influence was to be heard later in some of the major choral works of Stanford and his pupils, as well as Elgar.<br>
<br>The sixth visit was in 1890 for the Philharmonic Society, and in June 1891 Dvo&#345;&aacute;k was made an honorary doctor of music by Cambridge University, proposed by Stanford. As a result he dedicated his new overture, <span class="italic">V p&#345;irod&#283;</span> (&#145;Amid Nature&#146;; op. 91; <span class="smallcap">B</span>168), to the university. Later that year he returned to conduct the premi&egrave;re of his <span class="roman">Requiem</span> at the Birmingham festival, after which followed his American years (1892&#150;5) as director of the National Conservatory, the direct result of a recommendation by Alfred Littleton. In March 1896 Dvo&#345;&aacute;k came to England for the last time, to conduct the first performance of his cello concerto no. 2 (op. 104; <span class="smallcap">B</span>191), at a Philharmonic Society concert in the Queen's Hall. Thereafter he received further invitations, including a commission for the Cardiff festival. However, his family- and home-loving nature led him to refuse all other inducements to travel; he remained in his beautiful Bohemian surroundings, writing his late great operas and symphonic poems.<br>
<br>From the outset Dvo&#345;&aacute;k was a popular figure in Britain, and thereafter he always felt a great warmth for English audiences. After his first visit he wrote of his astonishing reception and said: &#145;The English are a good, cordial and music-loving nation, and it is well known that if they are fond of anyone they remain loyal to him. May God grant that this should happen in my case too&#146;  (Kuna, 1.400). The modest Dvo&#345;&aacute;k remained amazed at his popularity in England. After the first performance of <span class="italic">St Ludmila</span> he wrote: &#145;I confess that I have never seen the artists around me on the platform as well as the audience in such a state of enthusiasm&#146;  (Kuna, 2.184). Dvo&#345;&aacute;k died of a pulmonary embolism following influenza at his Prague home, 14 &#381;itn&aacute; Ulice, on 1 May 1904. The nation gave him a state funeral and he was buried on 5 May in Slav&iacute;n at Vy&#353;ehrad in Prague, where most of the great figures in Czech history since the nineteenth century lie today.<br>
