<span class="headword">Asty,  John</span>  (1675&#150;1730), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, the second son of Robert Asty (1642&#150;1681), Independent minister at Norwich, and his wife, Lydia (<i>d</i>. 1697), eldest daughter of the Revd John Sammes of Coggeshall, Essex, was born at Norwich on 12 September 1675 and baptized at the Old Meeting-House there probably on 8 December. At the age of eight he was taken into the family of the Revd John Collinges, minister to the dissenting congregation at the East Granary, Norwich, who superintended his education, the cost of which was borne by Samuel Smith, a relation of the Fleetwoods of Armingland Hall, Norfolk. After Collinges's death in 1691 Asty was trained for the ministry, funded by a Common Fund bursary, at Thomas Rowe's academy, then located in Little Britain, London, where he was a fellow student of Isaac Watts. He remained there for four years before accepting in November 1695 the position of domestic chaplain to the family of Smith Fleetwood of Armingland Hall and Stoke Newington, a position he retained for the next fifteen years, having declined in 1700 an invitation to become minister at the Independent church in Amsterdam.<br>
<br>From 14 October 1710 until his death Asty was the pastor at the Independent meeting-house in Ropemakers' Alley, Moorfields, London. He resided on the premises and was ordained there on 4 April 1711. An orthodox Trinitarian, he voted with the subscribers at the Salters' Hall conference of 1719, and in 1727 was elected one of the six Independent ministers to sit on the Committee of the Ministers of the Three Denominations. During his time in London Asty was described as a &#145;serious useful preacher&#146;, and his sermons as &#145;serious and evangelical, experimental, solid and judicious&#146;  (Wilson, 2.539, 541). However, he does not appear to have been popular with either his fellow ministers or the members of his own congregation. His part in the dismissal of Martin Tomkins, dissenting minister at Stoke Newington, did nothing to enhance his popularity. In a sermon to Tomkins's congregation in June 1718 Asty warned his listeners to be aware of the dangers of errors and heresies then being preached by some London ministers. Although no names were mentioned, the inference was that Tomkins had become an Arian. Tomkins denied this, but was never able to eradicate the seeds of doubt which Asty had sown, and within a few weeks had been dismissed. He regarded Asty's conduct as &#145;an officious interference&#146; but graciously exonerated him of &#145;any particular personal prejudice&#146;  (Tomkins, 11).<br>
<br>Asty was not a prolific writer and is credited with few publications. He edited the <span class="italic">Complete Collection of Sermons of Dr. John Owen</span> (1712), to which he added a life of Owen, his favourite author. His only other published work was a funeral sermon preached on the death of Elizabeth Fleetwood in 1728. He died in London on 20 January 1730 and was buried in Bunhill Fields. His funeral sermon was preached by John Guyse at Ropemakers' Alley on 8 February.<br>
