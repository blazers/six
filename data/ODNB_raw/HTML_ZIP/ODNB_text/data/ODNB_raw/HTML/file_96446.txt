<span class="headword">Staples, Sir  Robert Ponsonby</span>, twelfth baronet  (1853&#150;1943), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Dundee on 30 June 1853, the third son in the family of three sons and two daughters of Sir Nathaniel Alexander Staples, tenth baronet (1817&#150;1899), a captain and interpreter in the Bengal artillery, and his wife, Elizabeth Lindsay, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Head (<i>d</i>. 1907). On resigning his commission in 1853, his father spent much of his time in Belgium, and succeeded to the baronetcy in succession to an uncle, Sir Thomas Staples, ninth baronet, in 1865, but did not take up residence at the family estate at Lissan House, Cookstown, co. Tyrone, until the death of his uncle's widow in 1872.<br>
<br>Staples was educated by his father until the age of twelve, then studied art and architecture at the Louvain Academy of Fine Arts from 1865 to 1870; he also studied at Dresden in 1867 and the Brussels Academy from 1872 to 1874. His works were first exhibited at the Royal Academy and the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1875. Apart from a year spent in Australia (1879&#150;80) he sought to build his career in the London art world under the patronage of his cousin, Sir Coutts Lindsay, who owned the Grosvenor Gallery. He married, at Pancras register office on 25 April 1883, Ada Louise (1862&#150;1940), daughter of Hassard Stammers, photographer; they had a son and three daughters.<br>
<br>Staples made his name by a succession of group portraits of participants in late Victorian public events. <span class="italic">Australia v. England</span> (MCC Museum, Lord's cricket ground), painted jointly with George Augustus Hamilton Barrable (1845&#150;1893), was an imaginary scene of a cricket match at Lord's, composed of &#145;ideal&#146; teams on both sides, with W. G. Grace and W. W. Read at the wickets, F. R. Spofforth bowling, and fashionable spectators in the foreground, including the prince and princess of Wales and Lily Langtry. Portrait heads of the two elevens appeared in the predella. Exhibited at the Goupil Gallery in June 1887, it was painted for exhibition by Coutts Lindsay in Australia and New Zealand and was reproduced in photogravure. The formula was repeated in <span class="italic">The Last Shot for the Queen's Prize, Wimbledon</span> (1889; Worthing Museum and Art Gallery), begun in the summer of 1887 at the invitation of the National Rifle Association, when it was believed that that year would be the last in which the competition would be held in south-west London (the move to Bisley did not in fact occur until 1890). The central figure of Reginald Olliver Warren, queen's prizewinner in 1887, is placed in a crowded scene, also including the prince and princess of Wales. This was accompanied by the <span class="italic">Queen's Prizemen</span> (1889; Worthing Museum and Art Gallery), a chronological line of twenty-seven prizewinners. <span class="italic">Cardinal Manning's Last Reception</span> (Archbishop's House, Westminster Cathedral), first exhibited in March 1892, showed leading British Roman Catholics, including the duke of Norfolk, Henry Vaughan, Charles Russell, and Henry Matthews. His <span class="italic">The House of Commons, February 13, 1893: Mr Gladstone Introducing the Second Home Rule Bill</span>, was based on individual portraits of the leading figures made during the subsequent parliamentary recess, and was first shown in May 1894.<br>
<br>From 1884 Staples and his family lived in Kensington. Letters from his father refer to money problems and the latter's assistance, in particular his involvement in Staples's borrowing money on the strength of <span class="italic">Australia v. England</span>. In 1897 he became an art master at the People's Palace in Mile End Road, London, and was also elected a member of the Royal Society of British Artists. He was a member of the Savage Club, and sketched several of its members. An exhibition of his portraits, &#145;One Hundred Men and Women of the Time&#146;, as a souvenir of the century, was held in 1900. His subjects included Phil May (1898; NPG), Edward Carson (1898; NPG), Swinburne (1900; NPG), Whistler (1901; NPG), and Kitchener (1902; NPG). He also exhibited domestic subjects, sometimes including his daughters, and landscapes; <span class="italic">On the Beach, Broadstairs, Kent</span> (1899; NG Ire.), combined the two genres.<br>
<br>In 1904 Staples moved to Belfast, where he exhibited with the Belfast Art Society. He was offered a commission to paint two triptychs on shipbuilding and linen for the new city hall, but only the former was completed because of a disagreement with the council. <span class="italic">Shipbuilding in Belfast: Liner on Stocks; Turbine Makers; Bangor Boat</span> (Ulster Museum, Belfast) was completed over a twenty-year period, between 1904 and 1924. When he was living in Belfast he also completed portraits of Winston Churchill, Lord Kitchener, Sir Edward Carson, and the nationalist MP Joseph Devlin. In politics he was a protestant home ruler, and a member of the nationalist United Irish League, though he supported recruitment to the army on the outbreak of the First World War.<br>
<br>About 1912 Staples took up residence at the family home, Lissan House, where he sketched and painted. The estate had lost considerably by land legislation and the building ventures of his father, and Staples spent many years unsuccessfully endeavouring to re-open the coalfield at Coalisland, which had been closed after a pit explosion. He made various attempts to sell his work in the 1920s to raise funds, offering works for sale to the National Portrait Gallery, and there is evidence that on occasion he had to pawn his pictures. His granddaughter Hazel Dolling (1922&#150;2006) recalled that<blockquote>money just slipped through his fingers. So little for his pictures&#151;four children to educate and only the pawn broker available when the kitty was empty. He was always short of the price of a &#145;half un&#146; and much of the estate shrank during his guardianship. (Dolling, 32)</blockquote>He was nearly eighty when he succeeded to the baronetcy on the death, in February 1933, of his elder brother, Sir John Molesworth Staples, eleventh baronet, who had spent much of his life as an inmate of an asylum in Belgium.<br>
<br>Since his days as an art student Staples had preferred to work in bare feet, and he avoided footwear except on social occasions. His belief in a regime of fresh air and barefoot early morning walks gained him the nickname the Barefoot Baronet. He died at Lissan House, Cookstown, on 18 October 1943 and was buried in the family plot at Lissan parish church. His unpublished diaries provide a continuous record of his engagements and work from 1888 to 1930.<br>
