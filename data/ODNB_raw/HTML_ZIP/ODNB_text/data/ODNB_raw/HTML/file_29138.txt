<span class="headword">Westphal, Sir  George Augustus</span>  (1785&#150;1875), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, son of George Westphal, of Hanoverian descent, whose uncle was tutor to the duke of Kent, and his wife, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McGrigor, widow of Captain Bachop RN, was born on 26 July 1785; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29139/', "Admiral Philip Westphal")</script> was his brother. He entered the navy, under the auspices of the duke of Kent, in 1798 on the frigate <i>Porcupine</i>, on the North American station. He afterwards served on the home station and in the West Indies, and in March 1803 joined the <i>Amphion</i>, which carried Nelson out to the Mediterranean. Off Toulon he was moved into the <i>Victory</i>, and, continuing in her, was present at Trafalgar, where he was severely wounded. While Westphal was lying in the cockpit Nelson's coat, hastily rolled up, was put under his head for a pillow. Some of the bullions of one of the epaulettes got entangled with his hair and was stuck to it with dried blood, so that the coat and Westphal could be separated only by cutting off some four or five of the bullions, which Westphal long treasured as memorials of the hero. He afterwards served in the <i>Ocean</i>, flagship of Lord Collingwood, and in the <i>Caledonia</i>, flagship of Lord St Vincent, off Brest; and on 15 August 1806 was made lieutenant in the sloop <i>Demerara</i> in the West Indies. In 1807 he had to be invalided, and was returning to England in a merchant ship when, after a gallant resistance, she was captured by a French privateer and taken to Guadeloupe. Westphal, who had been severely wounded, afterwards escaped, and was picked up at sea by an American schooner, from which he got on board an English privateer and was taken to Antigua, ultimately returning to England in the frigate <i>Venus</i>. He was appointed to the <i>Foudroyant</i>, from which he was removed to the <i>Neptune</i>, and from her to the <i>Belle-Isle</i> in the West Indies, and served on shore at the capture of Martinique. The <i>Belle-Isle</i>, under Commodore George Cockburn, then returned to England, and in July and August was employed in the Scheldt, Westphal being in command of a division of the gunboats.<br>
<br>Westphal afterwards followed Cockburn to the <i>Indefatigable</i>, and in the expedition to Quiberon Bay in March 1810 had command of the boat which landed the agents of the king of Spain. Continuing in the <i>Indefatigable</i>, he took part in the defence of Cadiz and in escorting the Spanish ships to Havana. He was again with Cockburn in the <i>Marlborough</i>, both at Cadiz and afterwards in the Chesapeake, where, on several occasions, his gallant conduct was praised by Cockburn, and led to his promotion to commander on 8 July 1813. He then was appointed to the sloop <i>Anaconda</i> and commanded her in the Gulf of Mexico and in the expedition against New Orleans, where he was landed with the naval brigade. In July 1815 the <i>Anaconda</i> was condemned at Jamaica, and Westphal returned to England as a passenger. He married first, on 8 January 1817, Alicia (<i>d</i>. 1847), daughter of Charles Stuart of Worcester and widow of William Chambers; in 1849 he married Mary Anne, daughter of John Racey of Quebec and widow of George Addenbrooke Gore of Barrowmount, Kilkenny: she survived him. On 12 August 1819 he was promoted captain. In May 1822 he was appointed to the <i>Jupiter</i> (60 guns), in which he carried out Lord Amherst to India. On his return he was knighted on 7 April 1824&#151;according to Peel, then home secretary, more for his gallant war service than for taking out the governor-general of Bengal. In 1832 he joined the <i>Vernon</i> (50 guns), as flag captain to Sir George Cockburn on the North American station, but was compelled to invalid in the spring of 1834.<br>
<br>Westphal had no further service, but was appointed naval aide-de-camp to the queen in November 1846, and was advanced to rear-admiral on 17 August 1851, vice-admiral on 10 September 1857, and admiral on 23 March 1863. For nearly forty years he lived in the same house, 2 Brunswick Square, Hove, Sussex, and died there on 11 January 1875. He was a magistrate of Brighton and Hove, but seldom sat. Westphal was a brave and resourceful junior commander, and continued selection by Cockburn demonstrated his great abilities as a sea officer.<br>
