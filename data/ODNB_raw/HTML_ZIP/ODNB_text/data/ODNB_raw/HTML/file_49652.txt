<span class="headword">Gilliatt,  Roger William</span>  (1922&#150;1991), <span class="occ">clinical neurologist</span>, was born on 30 July 1922 at 58A Wimpole Street, Marylebone, London, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33405/', "Sir William Gilliatt (1884&#150;1956)")</script>, obstetrician, who attended the births of the prince of Wales and Princess Anne, and his wife, Anne Louise Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kann (1884&#150;1978), anaesthetist, daughter of John Kann of Lyne, Surrey, stockbroker. He had one older sister, Elizabeth (1920&#150;2004), private secretary to Winston Churchill from 1945 to 1955.<br>
<br>Gilliatt was educated at Hildersham House preparatory school, Kent, and Rugby School, Warwickshire. He entered Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1940 but interrupted his studies by enlisting with the King's Royal Rifle Corps in 1942. Serving in north-west Europe as battalion scout platoon commander, he was twice mentioned in dispatches and awarded the Military Cross. The citation spoke of &#145;Lieutenant Gilliatt's very great leadership &hellip; outstanding personal courage [and his] great coolness under heavy shelling proving the greatest inspiration to his men&#146;  (<span class="roman">Institute of Neurology annual report</span>). Reticent about these events in later years, Gilliatt's only comment on the episode was: &#145;I got lost&#146;  (ibid.). After the war he served in the Territorial Army and at one point considered joining the Special Air Service in Malaya, but his father &#145;sternly put the stark alternatives, a career as an adventurer or as a physician, and left him in no doubt as to the decision he expected&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Gilliatt returned to Oxford on demobilization and graduated with first-class honours in physiology in 1946, six months after returning from war service. Awarded the Theodore Williams scholarship, from 1946 to 1947 he was research assistant at the spinal injuries unit at Stoke Mandeville Hospital and the university laboratory of physiology in Oxford. After further study at the Middlesex Hospital medical school he graduated BM BCh at Oxford in 1949. He then worked as house physician, casualty officer, and medical registrar at the Middlesex Hospital (1950&#150;53); house physician and resident medical officer at the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases (1953&#150;4); physician to the National Hospital and the department for nervous diseases, Middlesex Hospital (1955&#150;87); professor of clinical neurology, University of London (1962&#150;87); and honorary consultant to the Royal Postgraduate Medical School and the Hammersmith Hospital (1982&#150;7). On 18 December 1954 he married Penelope Ann Douglass Conner [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52076/', "Gilliatt, Penelope (1932&#150;1993)")</script>], journalist and writer, daughter of Cyril Conner, barrister. There were no children of the marriage, which ended in divorce in 1963. On 16 May the same year Gilliatt married Mary Elizabeth Green, a 27-year-old journalist, and elder daughter of Arthur Joseph William Green, director of an engineering company. They had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>From 1955 to 1962 Gilliatt was a clinical neurologist with a successful Harley Street private practice. Hospital rounds were conducted with military precision. The ward sister placed the patients at attention in their beds, with a chair at the foot for Gilliatt's bag. A luckless medical student, mentioning that a patient with tabes dorsalis had acquired syphilis in the First World War, was taken aside and reprimanded for the indiscretion: &#145;when speaking of antecedent causes, leprosy &#147;yes&#148;; syphilis &#147;no&#148;&#146;. Years later Gilliatt apologized for being such a stuffed shirt  (private information). But the style did not change and his ward rounds remained perfunctory. The registrar stated the facts; the senior registrar offered an interpretation; the house officer wrote notes but was best advised to remain silent; and Gilliatt spoke briefly to the patient. Behind this veneer of austerity lay the combination of intellectual superiority and an apparent reluctance to display his clinical skills alongside those of the full-time neurologists at Queen Square. Sometimes, and especially if the case had been referred from a neurologist in provincial practice, Gilliatt would visit the patient later in the week, and make a note. These showed clinical skills and a sympathetic attitude to patients that he did not reveal at other times.<br>
<br>Gilliatt brought rigour and discipline to his own research, which focused on the mechanisms of mechanical and toxic damage to peripheral nerve. His Oxford DM was awarded in 1955 for work on human sensory phenomena. He was Goulstonian lecturer of the Royal College of Physicians of London in 1962 and delivered the Oliver Sharpey lecture in 1975. He espoused the ethic of clinical science whereby a problem identified in the clinic should be taken to the laboratory, investigated systematically, and the insights gained used to improve the management of patients.<br>
<br>Professional life changed for Gilliatt in 1962 when he was appointed to the foundation professorship of clinical neurology in the University of London. This represented the culmination of a long and complex campaign. It was becoming clear that the doctrinaire style of clinical neurology must change as the National Hospital approached its centenary, if the subject and that institution were to avoid being left behind by advances in experimental medicine. But with rigid opposition for change from the medical committee, still Queen Square failed to develop academically. That Gilliatt was eventually able to effect the transformation of academic neurology depended on his vision of the field and ability to harness goodwill and manage opposition. His method was rarely to be absent from the hospital; to prepare for difficulties; to select and prepare allies; to use logical arguments; and occasionally to surprise. The style stemmed from his military background. No less useful as ammunition was the legacy of a famous letter from Derek Denny-Brown to Michael Kremer, dean of the Institute of Neurology. In refusing the offer of the professorship at the Institute of Neurology, Denny-Brown had argued that the professorial unit must not be separate from the rest of activities in the hospital; two days each week should be devoted to research protected from teaching and clinical duties; reciprocal respect and facilities must be ensured between the professor and heads of the laboratory departments, especially in neuropathology; there must be a university contribution to the recurrent costs; and the professor should involve everyone in advancing neurological medicine. Denny-Brown told Ian McDonald in 1963 that Gilliatt &#145;having the right priorities, being of the establishment, and likely to succeed in moulding the place to his purpose was the only hope for Queen Square&#146;  (<span class="roman">Institute of Neurology annual report</span>).<br>
<br>By the nature of his role in an institution retaining a monopoly in the training of academic neurologists Gilliatt nurtured most of the professors of neurology in the United Kingdom. He was at ease with and greatly admired by those who worked in his immediate vicinity. He was hospitable and socially attentive to overseas students. But he appeared less relaxed with British trainees, among whom he had a fearsome reputation for aloofness and acerbity. His waspish tongue became legendary.<br>
<br>Outside the world of science and medicine Gilliatt was known for having been best man at the marriage of Antony Armstrong-Jones and Princess Margaret in Westminster Abbey in May 1960. The <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> ran a feature on him in the week before the wedding. The columnist Anne Sharpley wrote of Gilliatt's presence, the ease with which those who met this quiet man soon found themselves involved in long discussions and arguments, and the &#145;nerve-wracking task of having the eyes of the world on him for a tricky courtly role usually carried out by members of the hereditary peerage&#146;. There was later sympathy at the public breakup of his marriage to Penelope Gilliatt, who left Gilliatt for the playwright John Osborne. The gossip columnists made a meal of this, delighted to get back at her for a searing article written for <span class="italic">Queen</span> attacking them for the inaccuracy and scurrilous nature of their columns.<br>
<br>Gilliatt's views were much in sympathy with the Labour Party and on one occasion he canvassed for a friend who stood (unsuccessfully) as a parliamentary candidate. In 1934&#150;5 his aunt Alice Gilliatt (1880&#150;1957), a suffragette and socialist, was the first woman elected as mayor of Fulham. Despite his socialist opinions, however, Gilliatt would say with much relish that there was nothing like the prospect of a weekend in the country with a valet to unpack his clothes before dinner. He retained a love of history and of literature, especially the writings of Anthony Trollope. He hoped to write a book in retirement on the characters in Trollope but that ambition was not realized.<br>
<br>After reaching the University of London's statutory retirement age Gilliatt moved to the United States and was appointed senior consultant in clinical neurophysiology at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland. Reflecting on his career at Queen Square, on the occasion of the unveiling of his portrait, Gilliatt confided:<blockquote>I might have had a slight feeling that I was being kicked out and pensioned off by a not very grateful Institute. As it is I can look back on all those years in the department with the feeling that we did really achieve something, all of us together. (Gilliatt to Ian McDonald, 14 Oct 1988, priv. coll.)</blockquote>After he separated from his second wife Gilliatt's later years were spent with Patricia Stolar, with whom he found much happiness. He died from pancreatic cancer on 19 August 1991 in Washington, DC, and was survived by his three children.<br>
