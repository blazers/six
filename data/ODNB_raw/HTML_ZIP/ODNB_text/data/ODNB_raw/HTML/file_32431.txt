<span class="headword">Clarke, Sir  Marshal James</span>  (1841&#150;1909), <span class="occ">colonial administrator and army officer</span>, born at Shronell, co. Tipperary, on 18 October 1841, was the eldest son of the Revd Mark Clarke (1809&#150;1848) of Shronell and his wife, Maria Hill. Educated at a private school in Dublin and later at Trinity College, Dublin, he went to Woolwich in 1860 and obtained a commission in the Royal Artillery in 1863; he retired in 1883 with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He married in 1880 Anne Stacy (<i>d</i>. 1933), daughter of Major-General Bannastre Pryce Lloyd; they had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Clarke spent most of his career in South Africa, serving in a civil more often than in a military capacity. In 1874 he became magistrate of Pietermaritzburg in Natal, and in 1876 was aide-de-camp to Sir Theophilus Shepstone. He was then appointed special commissioner for Lydenburg. In 1877 he was sent on a mission to Sekukuni, who had been at war with the Boers on the northern frontier of the Transvaal near the Lydenburg goldfields, and in the same year was political officer and special commissioner at Lydenburg. He served in the Anglo-Transvaal War (1880&#150;81), was twice mentioned in dispatches, and was in charge of the landdrost's office at Potchefstroom when it was attacked and compelled to surrender by the insurgent Boers in December 1880.<br>
<br>In 1881 Clarke became resident magistrate at Quthing in Basutoland, and in 1882 commissioner of Cape police at King William's Town in Cape Colony. In the same year he was sent to Egypt and appointed colonel commanding the Turkish regiment of Egyptian gendarmerie, which he helped to reorganize; he received the third class of the order of the Mejidiye. On 13 March 1884 Basutoland was taken over by the crown from the Cape government, and Clarke, who had now retired from the army and had lost his left arm in a shooting accident, was appointed resident commissioner. He held that post until 1893, maintaining peace, establishing a Basuto mounted police force, and involving the Basuto chiefs in government. In 1893 he was made resident commissioner and chief magistrate of Zululand where, as a competent and conciliatory administrator, he could best serve the Zulu people who were restless after the uprising in 1888. After Zululand had been annexed to Natal, he was in 1898 appointed imperial resident commissioner of Rhodesia, under the Southern Rhodesia order in council of that year, and held that appointment until he retired in 1905.<br>
<br>Clarke showed great capacity in administration of the African people. Basutoland, which under the Cape government had been in a constant state of ferment, made marked progress in peace and prosperity under his guidance. Constantly selected to fill difficult positions in South Africa, he was conspicuous among the men who won the confidence and respect of the African people. He was created CMG in 1880 and KCMG in 1886. Clarke died at his home, The Lodge, Enniskerry, co. Wicklow, on 1 April 1909, and was buried at Mount Jerome, Dublin.<br>
