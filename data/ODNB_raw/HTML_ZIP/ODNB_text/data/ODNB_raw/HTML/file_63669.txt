<span class="headword">Rhames,  Aaron</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1734), <span class="occ">printer</span>, is of unknown origins. The first reference to him is as an apprentice to the printer Joseph Ray of Dublin. He was freed of the London Stationers' Company on 7 August 1704 by Ray, and he spent the next few years working both in London and in the printing works at Three Keys, St Nicholas, Dublin. It was in London in 1705 that he married Margaret, daughter of John Millet and stepdaughter of William Onley, both printers. Their first son, Charles, died in 1708 and was buried on 8 February at St Werburgh's Church, Dublin.<br>
<br>Rhames came into his own as a printer in 1709, when he turned out, sometimes using monogram, at least fifteen books and pamphlets, several for his former fellow apprentice, Jeremiah Pepyat. He was given the important task of printing the philosophical writings of George Berkeley, namely his <span class="italic">Essay towards a New Theory of Vision</span> (1709), and <span class="italic">Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge</span> (1710), at his new printing works situated at the back of Dick's Coffee House, Skinner Row, Dublin.<br>
<br>Rhames established himself as a printer of distinction when he accepted the order on behalf of William Binauld and Eliphal Dobson of printing the whole of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in folio in 1714, the first extant Irish edition. He then printed for John Hyde and three others an octavo edition in 1722. In 1719 Hyde's company had instructed Rhames to print ten thousand copies of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> for charitable distribution and he completed the order in 1722. In 1716 a <span class="italic">Book of Common Prayer</span> was printed by and for Rhames, Dobson, and Pepyat, with another edition printed in 1724. Rhames took a leading role in the life of the Guild of Printers; admitted in 1714, he served on the council from 1721, as warden in 1723, and then as master in 1728. He was admitted a freeman of the city in 1714.<br>
<br>A tory in politics, Rhames fully appreciated the political value of newspapers and attempted to produce a local newspaper for Dublin on three different occasions, failing each time. In 1705 he produced the <span class="italic">Dublin Courant, or, Diverting Post</span>, and it folded after two issues; in 1709 he printed five issues, and in 1725 between 25 October and 13 December he printed nine issues. On the last occasion he and the Dublin undertaker William Smith were involved.<br>
<br>Rhames and his wife had three sons who survived infancy: Joseph (<i>b</i>. 18 July 1719), John (<i>bap</i>. 5 Dec 1727), and Benjamin (<i>bap</i>. 6 May 1730). All three followed him in the book trade, Joseph and John as printers and Benjamin as music printer and seller. When Rhames moved in 1725 to a printing works opposite the Pied Horse in Capel Street, it is probable that he began to print sheet music. Rhames was chosen as printer to the newly formed Dublin Society from 1731 to 1736; on 30 October 1731 his proposal for producing <span class="italic">Till's Treatise of Horse Houghing Husbandry</span> was accepted, and printed by 11 November. By December he was owed &pound;12 10<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. by the society, and in the next five years he printed several pamphlets for the society on a variety of subjects, such as saffron, flax, bees, and hops. Among his other important printing tasks were Joseph Beaumont's <span class="italic">Mathematical Sleaing-Tables, or, Mistery of Weaving Linnen-Cloth Explain'd</span> (1712), Bishop William Nicolson's <span class="italic">Irish Historical Library</span> (1724), and the third edition of Gilbert Burnet's <span class="italic">History of the Reformation of the Church of England</span> (3rd edn, 1730). He produced a number of red and black title pages, rare in the Dublin book trade, and when he died in Dublin on 9 December 1734 he was remembered as a perfectionist in the printing world. He was succeeded by his wife and his sons, and their descendants carried on until 1809.<br>
