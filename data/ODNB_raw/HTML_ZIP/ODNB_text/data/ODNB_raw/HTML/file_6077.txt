<span class="headword">Coningsby <span class="st"> [Conyngesby]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1540), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the second (and eldest surviving) son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6074/', "Sir Humphrey Coningsby (d. 1535)")</script>, justice of the king's bench, and his first wife, Isabel Fereby. He was educated in the 1490s at Eton College, and then at King's College, Cambridge, where he was resident from 1497 to 1501; he proceeded to the Inner Temple in the early 1500s. He was appointed a justice of the peace for Hertfordshire as early as 1504, and was perhaps then resident in his father's home at Aldenham. About 1514 he married Beatrice (<i>d</i>. 1543), daughter of Thomas Thoresby of Lynn, Norfolk, and widow of William Trew (<i>d</i>. 1510/1512). Coningsby then moved to Lynn, where he served as a county magistrate from 1514, as recorder of Lynn from 1524, and as member of parliament for Lynn in 1536. In 1510 he succeeded John Caryll as third protonotary of the common pleas under the terms of an agreement made with his father in 1493; but the scheme to pass on to him at the same time the clerkship of assize on the western circuit failed when the assize judges declined to co-operate.<br>
<br>Coningsby continued as protonotary until 1539, when he was nominated for the coif. He became in 1518 a bencher of his inn, and gave a second reading, in 1526, on the first chapter of the <span class="roman">Statute of Merton</span>. He is mentioned in the 1530s as the steward of Clackclose hundred, and as steward of courts in Norfolk for the priories of Thetford and Lewes. In 1536 he acquired the lucrative post of attorney-general of the duchy of Lancaster, which he occupied until 1540. He was committed to the Tower in February 1540, with other law officers, for advising on a method of settling land that would have seriously damaged the revenue from wardships; but this disgrace did not prevent his being given the coif in June 1540 and then, on 5 July following, the office of justice of the king's bench in succession to John Port. But these advancements came too late to be enjoyed. He died on 10 September 1540, a week after making his last will, and was buried in St Nicholas's Church, Lynn.<br>
<br>Coningsby owned a house in Woollen Street, Lynn, probably in right of his wife. In 1524 he purchased the manors of Wallington and Thorpland, Norfolk, and thereafter made his principal seat at Eston Hall in Wallington. He had one son, Christopher, slain at the battle of Pinkie in 1547, and four daughters. His granddaughter Elizabeth married Sir Francis Gawdy, chief justice of the common pleas.<br>
