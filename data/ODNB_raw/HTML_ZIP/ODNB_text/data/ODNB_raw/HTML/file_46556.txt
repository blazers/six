<span class="headword">Corder,  Susanna</span>  (1787&#150;1864), <span class="occ">biographer</span>, was born in Stoke Newington, Middlesex, the daughter of John Corder and Ruth Marriage, both Quakers. A delicate child, she was educated from 1797 to 1799 at Ackworth School in Yorkshire. About the age of twenty, after a period of spiritual depression, she experienced a deepening of her religious commitment. She nursed her mother devotedly until her death, after which she decided to pursue a career in teaching, to which she had long felt called. From 1817 to 1824 she taught at a school at Suir Island, Clonmel, Ireland, which she enjoyed. In 1824 she returned to England and, with the help of William Allen and other leading Quakers, started a school for girls at Fleetwood House in Stoke Newington, which was modelled on the Irish establishment.<br>
<br>Corder's school was a progressive one: the curriculum included astronomy, experimental philosophy, physics, and natural history, as well as more traditional subjects such as writing, arithmetic, history, French, and needlework. Greek, Latin, German, and Italian were offered as extras, and William Allen gave lectures on chemistry and lent his telescope for the use of the pupils. In 1827 the wide range of subjects offered was celebrated in some doggerel verses by one Joseph Pease, who referred to the &#145;astounding variety of stores intellectual imbibed by pupils at the &#147;N[ewington] Nunnery&#148;&#146;  (Shirren, 163). By that date the number of pupils had risen from twelve to twenty-five.<br>
<br>If the curriculum was liberal, the general regime of the school was not. In her youth Susanna Corder had experienced &#145;much conflict of mind on the subject of dress&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Monitor</span>, 43) and had adopted the full austerity of traditional Quaker dress. Accordingly, her pupils were required to wear stiff Quaker bonnets, which exposed them to the ridicule of their contemporaries at a neighbouring school. The religious needs of pupils were catered for extravagantly: copious spiritual readings and talks were given by such visitors as Allen and Sarah Grubb. The high days and holidays of the school year consisted of visits to the British Museum and attendance at the yearly meeting in London.<br>
<br>The ethos of the school reflected the essential conservatism of Susanna Corder's religion. She herself was described as &#145;an embodiment of perfection as regards propriety of manner, costume, and doctrine of the medieval section of the Friends' Society&#146;  (Shirren, 162). She became an elder of the local meeting soon after her return to Stoke Newington, and it was in this capacity that she signed a warning letter to John Wilkinson, whose heterodox views produced a schism among the Stoke Quakers in 1836. She was also on the revising committee of the Morning Meeting for fifteen years. In 1841 she published <span class="italic">A Brief Outline of the Origin, Principles, and Church Government of the Society of Friends</span>, in which her strong adherence to the traditional Quaker dress, manners, and doctrine was clearly manifested.<br>
<br>Susanna Corder retired between 1840 to 1845, and moved to Chelmsford, where she spent the rest of her life. She now turned entirely to her writing. Corder had already published her most successful work, <span class="italic">Memorials of Deceased Members of the Society of Friends</span> (2nd edn, 1839), which went through at least six revised editions. These sketches of the lives of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century English and American Quakers concentrated on their spiritual experiences, opinions, and work, and often recounted their edifying deaths in great detail. Her subjects were largely obscure; one was her own pupil Ann Backhouse, who had died at the age of nineteen. Corder's emphasis on the inner spiritual lives of her characters&#151;rather than their (often unspectacular) public careers&#151;no doubt helped to ensure a roughly equal balance of male and female subjects: the second edition (1839) included twenty-seven men and twenty women. Corder's most significant work, however, was her 1853 biography of the prison reformer Elizabeth Fry, which she wrote at the request of Fry's family. Based largely on Fry's diaries, from which it quotes continually and extensively, the <span class="italic">Life</span> succeeded in tracing the inner spiritual journey of a well-known public figure; it still remains an important source for Fry's life. Three years later Corder wrote a memoir of Priscilla Gurney, Fry's sister.<br>
<br>Susanna Corder also published <span class="italic">Christian Instruction in the History, Types, and Prophecies of the Old Testament</span> (1854), an &#145;epitome of Scriptural history and doctrine&#146;  (p. iii). The text of this work&#151;which, as Corder herself said, does not rival the &#145;impressive sublimity of the beautifully simple style of the Sacred Volume&#146;  (ibid., 1)&#151;shows the author's usual tendency towards an earnest and ponderous verbosity. She also wrote several pamphlets, including one advocating the exercise of spiritual gifts by women (1839), which reached a third edition. Susanna Corder died on 28 February 1864 at her home in Chelmsford, and she was buried in Chelmsford on 3 March.<br>
