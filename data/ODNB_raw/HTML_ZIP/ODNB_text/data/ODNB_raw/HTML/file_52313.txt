<span class="headword">&AElig;thelheard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 740), <span class="occ">king of the West Saxons</span>, became king in 726 after his predecessor, Ine, retired to Rome. The succession was disputed, but &AElig;thelheard defeated the other claimant, an atheling named Oswald. &AElig;thelheard's name does not appear in any extant genealogy of the West Saxon kings, and there is no direct evidence for his ancestry or connections. However, the inference, sometimes drawn, that he was an outsider, may not be correct. Since Ine had a long reign with a planned ending, it is likely that he designated his successor, and the most obvious person to have been so named is &AElig;thelheard. It is quite possible that he was Ine's son, and that this was why no one thought it worthwhile to draw up a separate genealogy for him.<br>
<br>&AElig;thelheard married a woman named Frithugyth. Again there is no direct evidence for her antecedents, but it has been suggested that she was related to Frithuwold of Surrey, Frithuswith (St Frideswide of Oxford), and others of similar names active at this period. She appears to have enjoyed a position of some power and importance during &AElig;thelheard's reign. She witnessed all of her husband's surviving charters, made grants of land both jointly with the king and independently, and travelled to Rome with Bishop Forthere in 739.<br>
<br>&AElig;thelheard and Frithugyth are recorded as making grants of land in Somerset and Devon to the monastery at Glastonbury. Two such grants were probably made in 729; others cannot be dated precisely. In 739 &AElig;thelheard gave land at Crediton, near Exeter, to Forthere, bishop of Sherborne, for the foundation of a monastery. Apparently the West Saxons controlled at least part of Devon at this time, but wars against the Cornish were a feature of West Saxon history down to the tenth century, and it may be that the monastery at Crediton was intended to consolidate West Saxon power in a precariously held border area.<br>
<br>During the later, if not the earlier, years of his reign, &AElig;thelheard may have been subject to some sort of overlordship by &AElig;thelbald, king of the Mercians. In his <span class="italic">Historia ecclesiastica</span>, Bede states that all the English kingdoms south of the Humber were subject to &AElig;thelbald in 731, and the Mercian king's charters of the 730s make similar claims. In 733 &AElig;thelbald occupied Somerton in Somerset, and charters furnish evidence for his continuing power in that area during the 740s. A reference (which may itself be authentic although surviving in a dubious charter) to &AElig;thelheard crossing the Severn on an expedition against the Welsh suggests that the West Saxons were assisting the Mercians, though it is unclear whether they were subject to, or in alliance with, the Mercian king on this occasion. However, there are obvious motives for hyperbole in the Mercian sources, and the Crediton grant shows that &AElig;thelheard continued to act as an independent king in at least some respects. &AElig;thelheard died in Wessex in 740 and was succeeded by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6979/', "Cuthred")</script>, who was probably his designated successor and may have been his son.<br>
