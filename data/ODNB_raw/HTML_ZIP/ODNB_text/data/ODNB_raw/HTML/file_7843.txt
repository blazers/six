<span class="headword">Dorrington,  Theophilus</span>  (1654&#150;1715), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Bow, London, on 11 November 1654 and was baptized at St Mary-le-Bow on 23 November. His father was the London clothier Theophilus Dorrington. The son of a nonconformist father, Dorrington seems to have been taught first by two ejected ministers: Mr Beard at Berden, Essex (possibly Thomas Beard), and Mr Horrax at Newington (probably Thomas Horrockes at Newington Butts, Surrey). Dorrington attended Merchant Taylors' School, London, from 1667. He was admitted on 19 December 1670 to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, which he left without graduating, to preach among the presbyterians.<br>
<br>In 1678, with Thomas Goodwin, John Shower, and James Lambert, Dorrington conducted an evening lecture at a coffee house in Exchange Alley, London, which many wealthy merchants attended. Apparently unsettled about continuing in presbyterian ministry, he enrolled on 13 June 1680 at the University of Leiden to study medicine. Dorrington spent two years in Antwerp, but when is uncertain. Encouraged by John Williams, later bishop of Chichester, he took Anglican orders as early as 1682. Probably after serving as chaplain to the mother of Elizabeth Howland, future duchess of Bedford, he entered Magdalen College, Oxford, on 16 June 1686, then became rector of Castle Hopton, Shropshire, the following year. In the summer of 1698 he toured northern Europe, collecting data for a book on Roman Catholicism. In November Archbishop Tillotson presented him with the valuable rectory of Wittersham, Kent, where he ministered for the remainder of his life. Dorrington projected an image of cultured refinement and piety&#151;a cosmopolitan, learned divine polished in Latin and French, who cultivated patronage in high society and wrote tirelessly on establishmentarian values. Finally, on 9 March 1711, the Oxford convocation rewarded his efforts with an MA degree.<br>
<br>Remembered for his acerbic polemics against dissent, Dorrington was concerned ultimately to remedy the three broader but related problems of immorality, schism, and sedition. He linked immorality to declining manners and piety. Ever conscious of rank and status, he urged ladies to emulate Du Bosc's <span class="italic">The Excellent Woman</span> (1682), which he had translated from the French. In <span class="italic">The Right Use of an Estate</span> (1683) he exhorted gentlemen to exemplify discipline, duty, and religious devotion. For common folk, he published a collection of meditations resembling a Catholic breviary: his popular <span class="italic">Reform'd Devotions</span> (1696) made nine editions by 1727. He then focused on the home: <span class="italic">Family Devotions</span> was a series of discourses (1693&#150;5) for domestic teaching on Sunday afternoons.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">A Familiar Guide</span> (1695), Dorrington addressed the problem of schism by describing communion as renewal of a covenant with God that could not be observed properly outside the established church. The assassination attempt against William III (1696) prompted his <span class="italic">The Honor due to the Civil Magistrate</span>, a polemic which vindicated high-church passive obedience and linked sedition to immorality and religious schism. Hinting that dissenters were responsible for most of this, momentarily he turned his attention to an easier target. After touring the continent, he wrote <span class="italic">Observations Concerning &hellip; the Romish Church</span> (1698) to warn against harbouring its superstitious practices, to guard against divisive Jesuit influences, and to encourage protestants abroad. Next he turned to Baptists, who had &#145;miserably overrun&#146; the county of Kent with error. <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Christian Church</span> (1701) was more than an apologetic for infant baptism. He claimed that the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> (1689), by removing measures of accountability, had promoted schism and the rise of heresy. Baptists were only one stage in the slide from presbyterianism to Quakerism. Disintegration of the established church had to be stopped with &#145;wise and moderate laws&#146; that would protect it from such &#145;sects&#146;. In the midst of this polemical barrage he published <span class="italic">The Divine Feudal Law</span> (1703), his translation (from Latin) of a work by Pufendorf, hoping, like its author, to unite protestants. Whatever goodwill created by this was quickly lost.<br>
<br>That year, Dorrington's <span class="italic">The Dissenting Ministry in Religion Censur'd</span> attacked the &#145;greatest Evil&#146; and cause of all religious corruption: the usurping of ministry by those not qualified for that office. In a postscript to <span class="italic">A Defence of Moderate Nonconformity</span> (part 1, 1703) Edmund Calamy described Dorrington's argument as &#145;weak, as it is bitter and virulent&#146; and full of &#145;Furious Invective&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Defence</span>, 239&#150;40): he had misrepresented dissenters and had abandoned them because he misunderstood their principles and sought preferment in the established church.<br>
<br>Dorrington's shallow arguments and sharp tone had marginalized him. He returned to publishing devotional guides, but usually with commentary on the key role of lawful ministers and how nonconformity was a chief cause of impiety. <span class="italic">The Plain Man's Gift of Prayer</span> (1703) opposed the extemporaneous praying of &#145;sects&#146;. <span class="italic">A Discourse of Singing</span> (1704) criticized some dissenters' plain style of worship, and <span class="italic">Devotions for Several Occasions</span> (1707) complained of others' &#145;instrumental verse&#146;. <span class="italic">Family Instruction</span> (1705) labelled dissenting academies &#145;nurseries of errour and schism&#146;; <span class="italic">The Worship of God</span> (1712) reinforced this attack and rebuked dissenters for abandoning sacramental worship.<br>
<br>In 1710 Dorrington renewed his frontal assault. In <span class="italic">The Dissenters Represented and Condemn'd</span> he opposed occasional conformity and used the presbyterian Daniel Williams's censure of a member's unlawful separation as a basis to argue against sectarian schism. To the end he maintained that true morality, unity, and loyalty could be maintained only within the established church. After the Hanoverian accession, in <span class="italic">The True Foundation of Obedience and Submission</span> (1714) he railed against dissenters as &#145;Republicans&#146; whose call for personal liberty and opposition to passive obedience were just as inimical to the interests of hereditary protestant succession as were the Jacobites.<br>
<br>Dorrington died at Wittersham on 30 April 1715, and was buried in the church there. He was survived by his wife, Elizabeth (the daughter of Joseph Waldo of Hoxton), who lived until 1739; a daughter, Sarah; and a son, Theophilus, who became treasurer of the East India Company and died on 5 November 1768.<br>
