<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Foot,  Paul Mackintosh</span>  (1937&#150;2004), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 8 November 1937 in Haifa, Palestine, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40197/', "Hugh Mackintosh Foot (1907&#150;1990), later Baron Caradon")</script>, governor of Jamaica and Cyprus, and at the time an administrative officer in the Palestinian government, and his wife, (Florence) Sylvia (1910&#150;1985), daughter of Arthur White Millar Tod, director of the Steam Navigation Company of Baghdad. The Foots were a famous west-country family deeply rooted in radical Liberal tradition; Paul's grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33189/', "Isaac Foot")</script> was a Liberal MP and Methodist. Three of Foot's uncles were politicians. Michael Foot became leader of the Labour Party, Dingle Foot was solicitor-general under Harold Wilson, and John Foot was a Liberal life peer (as Baron Foot). Paul was educated at Shrewsbury School, which was to provide the founding spirits of the satirical magazine <span class="italic">Private Eye</span>, Christopher Booker, Willie Rushton, and Foot's lifelong friend Richard Ingrams. &#145;At Shrewsbury I was on Ingrams' coat tails&#146;, recalled Foot, who freely admitted to hero worship  (Thompson, 43&#150;4). National service followed and when, in 1958, at the end of his stint as a subaltern, he went to University College, Oxford, to read jurisprudence the first person he came across was Ingrams.<br>
<br>In the late 1950s Oxford University's premier magazine, <span class="italic">Isis</span>, had been taken over by the &#145;new left&#146; under the editorship of Dennis Potter, later to become one of Britain's most accomplished television playwrights. Foot, who had not yet made the journey from his family's traditional Liberal beliefs to the far left, invited him to speak to the University Liberal Club, of which he was president. Potter's speech was remarkable for the observation that when he saw a Rolls-Royce he spat at it  (Ingrams, <span class="italic">My Friend Footy</span>, 22). Foot's radical juices began to race and, together with Ingrams, he took over <span class="italic">Parson's Pleasure</span> magazine. It did not last long and was reborn, with the help of Rushton, Booker, and John Wells, as <span class="italic">Mesopotamia</span>. This was the embryonic <span class="italic">Private Eye</span>. Foot went on to be a short-lived editor of <span class="italic">Isis</span> but the magazine was banned by the university proctors after he introduced critical reviews of lectures. He attacked the fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley and resigned when <span class="italic">Isis</span>'s owners decided to apologize. In his last term he became president of the Oxford Union, where he honed his considerable oratorical powers, as well as fulfilling half his father's bidding, contained in a telegram that greeted his arrival in Oxford: &#145;Get a first and be president of the Union&#146;  (ibid., 12). A life of protest and campaigning against injustice and intolerance had begun.<br>
<br>Foot's shift from the traditional Liberal politics of his family to the radical left was to find expression on Glasgow's turbulent streets. When he left Oxford in 1961 with a second-class degree in jurisprudence, his uncle Michael arranged for him to meet Hugh Cudlipp, then editorial chief of the Mirror Group. Foot was offered a post on the Glasgow <span class="italic">Daily Record</span>, where he was warned that his first job would be &#145;to sort out the Trots&#146; who turned out to be shipyard apprentices and engineers. &#145;Their politics were entirely different to anything I had come across in formal education&#146;, he wrote. &#145;It seemed suddenly clear from what I read and saw that society was cut into classes, and that the classes were forever at war with one another&#146;  (Foot, x). Glasgow was a hotbed of left-wing thought, intrigue, and action and there he met an explosive cocktail of anarchists, Trotskyists, and Marxists, among them a future Labour minister, Gus Macdonald, who was organizing apprentice strikes in the shipyards. It was Macdonald who introduced Foot to the soapbox, suggesting that he got rid of his public school hairstyle, although there was little he could do about the upper-class accent. The hairstyle changed with the politics; neither was to change again for the rest of his life. When it was suggested he become editor of a new magazine in London&#151;this turned out to be <span class="italic">Private Eye</span>&#151;Foot turned down the offer with the explanation to Richard Ingrams &#145;You see, I'm part of a movement now&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 20 July 2004). There were numerous far-left organizations to choose from in the Glasgow of the early 1960s, but Foot joined the (Trotskyite) International Socialists, later to re-emerge as the Socialist Workers' Party. He was to remain faithful to the cause until he died, in spite of the never-ending feuding among the faithful. Unlike many committed left-wingers, Foot was funny, able to laugh at himself, and to enjoy life. On 23 June 1962 he married Monica Eleanor Beckinsale, journalist and daughter of Robert Beckinsale, an Oxford tutor, with whom he had two sons.<br>
<br>In 1964 Foot returned to London to join Hugh Cudlipp's newly launched but ill-fated newspaper <span class="italic">The Sun</span>, but disillusion set in quickly and he resigned after six months. He joined <span class="italic">Private Eye</span> full-time in 1967 because, he said, he could not resist the challenge of two full pages to write whatever he liked. These pages quickly established themselves as the &#145;serious bit&#146; of the <span class="italic">Eye</span>, a counterbalance to the scandal, savage gossip, and sharp satire that characterized the rest of the magazine. It was Foot's investigation of the affairs of the corrupt architect John Poulson that established both him and <span class="italic">Private Eye</span> as a serious journalistic force. National newspapers had given the scandal scant coverage, even though the former chancellor of the exchequer Reginald Maudling and two other MPs were at the heart of the affair. Other campaigns by Foot also achieved national prominence. His belief in the innocence of James Hanratty, convicted and hanged for murder in 1962, led to the reopening of the case; this was an investigation that was to occupy Foot for the rest of his life. Even after DNA evidence appeared to confirm that Hanratty was indeed the killer there were so many inconsistencies in the police inquiry that questions were raised about the accuracy of the DNA testing. His first marriage having been dissolved in 1970, on 27 July 1971 Foot married Catherine Rosanne (Rose) Harvey, television presenter and daughter of Robert Wallace Harvey; they had one son. In October of the following year Foot left <span class="italic">Private Eye</span> to join the <span class="italic">Socialist Worker</span>, where he became editor in 1974. The decade was pockmarked with industrial unrest and dominated by a serious economic decline, persuading many leftists that the long awaited socialist revolution was on the way. Foot continued to contribute to <span class="italic">Private Eye</span>, notably revelations about the Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe and an alleged plot to murder Norman Scott, who claimed to have been Thorpe's gay lover.<br>
<br>By 1979 the socialist revolution still had not happened; instead the Thatcherite one was beginning. Foot had left the <span class="italic">Socialist Worker</span> and, while working part-time for <span class="italic">Private Eye</span>, was looking for a new challenge. This came with the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>'s offer of a weekly column, which he accepted. It was a brave venture for both newspaper and columnist but one that was to be an outstanding success, bringing Foot numerous awards, including <span class="italic">What the Papers Say</span> journalist of the decade for the 1990s. He quickly built up a devoted following among <span class="italic">Mirror</span> readers, who found in him a distinctive voice available nowhere else in Fleet Street. His brief was a manifesto of his life in journalism: to take the side of the poor against the rich, public enterprise against private enterprise, Labour against tories, wrongly convicted prisoners against the judiciary. The only unspoken no-go area was his refusal to use the column as propaganda for the Socialist Workers' Party. His campaigning was relentless, on behalf of those wrongly convicted of IRA bombings in Guildford and Birmingham, or of Colin Wallace, a Ministry of Defence official who claimed he had been sacked because he had refused to take part in an MI5 dirty tricks campaign against the government and who was later convicted of manslaughter. It took fifteen years of relentless campaigning to clear him. Probably Foot's greatest triumph, because he did it virtually single-handed, was on behalf of four men convicted of murdering the newspaper delivery boy Carl Bridgewater in 1978. The three survivors were eventually cleared seventeen years after he began his investigation to prove their innocence. His books included a study of the Bridgewater case, <span class="italic">Murder at the Farm</span> (1986), as well as <span class="italic">Who Killed Hanratty?</span> (1971) and <span class="italic">Who Framed Colin Wallace?</span> (1989).<br>
<br>Foot and his column survived the Robert Maxwell years. The <span class="italic">Mirror's</span> proprietor never interfered and only once threatened to sack him&#151;when Foot picketed Maxwell's Oxford home on behalf of striking employees in his private publishing company. However he did not survive Maxwell's successor, David Montgomery, who was appointed chief executive in the wake of the pension and company fraud unearthed after Maxwell's death. Foot refused to accept the wholesale sacking of <span class="italic">Mirror</span> employees and wrote his weekly column on it, complete with numerous acerbic references to the chief executive which, unsurprisingly, the editor refused to publish. Foot took to the streets outside the <span class="italic">Mirror</span>'s Holborn headquarters and started handing out copies of the banned page. The sack, after fourteen years, was inevitable.<br>
<br>Foot went back to <span class="italic">Private Eye</span>, but in April 1999 he suffered an aortic aneurysm and was unconscious for five weeks. He eventually returned to work, his brain unimpaired but walking with the aid of two sticks, and set about destroying the case against a Libyan intelligence agent convicted of the Lockerbie bombing. He continued at <span class="italic">Private Eye</span> and contributed a column to <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> until his death from a heart attack on 18 July 2004 at Stansted airport, Essex, when he was about to leave for a holiday in Ireland with his partner, Clare Fermont, with whom he had had a daughter. His funeral on 27 July attracted 2000 people who followed the coffin to Golders Green crematorium in north London, a tribute to the fact that in a world where allegiances, principles, prejudices, and beliefs change with easy cynicism, Foot remained a &#145;steadfast beacon of integrity&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 20 July 2004). The funeral was attended by many of those for whom he had fought during his life and who would not have been free to attend without his unswerving support and belief in a justice they had been denied.<br>
