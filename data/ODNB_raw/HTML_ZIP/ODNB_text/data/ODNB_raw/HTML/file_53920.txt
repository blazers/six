<span class="headword">Evans,  Lewis</span>  (<em>c.</em>1700&#150;1756), <span class="occ">cartographer and geologist</span>, was born in Llangwnnadl, near Pwllheli, Caernarvonshire. Of his early life and parentage nothing is known. By 1736 he was a surveyor and map maker in Philadelphia. His first known work is &#145;A map of that part of Bucks County released by the Indians to the proprietaries of Pensilvania in September 1737&#146; (1738, Logan MSS, Historical Society of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia), which showed the important land purchase by James Logan who had commissioned Evans to make the map. Evans wanted to make further maps of Indian lands which the colonial proprietors wanted to secure to enable the colony's peaceful westward expansion. In 1743 he and John Bartram the botanist were granted permission to accompany Conrad Weiser, provincial Indian agent, into Indian lands west of the settled parts of Pennsylvania and New York. Posing as a disinterested scientific observer, Evans was able, under Weiser's protection, to penetrate further westward than any other geographer to date. In 1746 he reduced a map for the board of proprietors of New Jersey and the knowledge he gained thereby and from seeing the maps which passed through the Pennsylvania land office and from further travel enabled him in 1749 to produce &#145;A map of Pensilvania, New-Jersey, New York and the three Delaware counties&#146; which was the first delineation of so large a part of the territory in such detail. He was, however, aware that further advances depended on his being able to survey in the field, not just bring together pre-existing knowledge, but such surveys were impossible in Indian territory.<br>
<br>In 1749 and 1750 Evans drew for Thomas Penn maps of the areas west of the settled part of Pennsylvania to help Penn decide which tract he should next purchase from the Indians, but Penn's 1750 plan that Evans and Bartram make a westward reconnaissance trip under a scientific cloak came to nothing. At the same time Evans gave Pehr Kalm, the Swedish naturalist, a map and geological information to guide him on his travels on the continent. On his return to Philadelphia, Kalm gave Evans geographical information about the areas he had visited. The manuscript of the map drawn by Evans for Kalm has not survived and just one engraved copy is known  (facsimile in J&ouml;rgensen, 27). The map covers New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, part of Lake Ontario, and the St Lawrence River as far as Quebec, as well as the middle Atlantic colonies shown on his 1749 map, although Kalm complained in retrospect, in a letter of 30 October 1777 to Pehr Wargentin, &#145;Alla orter, dem jag i America bes&ouml;kte, finns w&auml;l ej h&auml;r antecknade&#146; (&#145;none of the places which I visited in America is shown&#146;; J&ouml;rgensen, 28). Kalm's published accounts of his journey included maps based on Evans's 1749 map.<br>
<br>In 1751&#150;2 Evans lectured in various colonies on natural philosophy including electricity in which he had been instructed by Benjamin Franklin. In 1752 he reissued his 1749 map and published <span class="italic">A Brief Account of Pennsylvania</span> (1753). Piqued to find that he had been induced by Penn to include topographical information which was erroneous but which bolstered Penn's position in the Pennsylvania&#150;Maryland border dispute, he undertook work for Penn's rival Lord Baltimore in 1753&#150;4, trying in vain to unearth archival material which would bolster Baltimore's position. This in turn put him in bad odour with Penn who then did not commission him to map the western part of the colony as part of his strategy to ward off French claims. Instead Evans prepared a map on his own initiative. His &#145;General map of the middle British colonies&#146; was accompanied by a booklet entitled <span class="italic">An Analysis of a General Map</span> (both published in 1755). The latter described as treasonable the British authorities' failure to consolidate claims to the rich Ohio country. While his condemnation grew intemperate he also attracted criticism in the press for the effect his maps had allegedly had on the prosecution of the war against the French, he having provided General Braddock with two maps for military purposes. Finally he was indicted for libel against Robert Morris Hunter, governor of Pennsylvania, for allegations in the 1755 pamphlet. He was imprisoned in New York city in the spring of 1756. Suffering from &#145;a lingering indisposition&#146; he was released on 8 June 1756, but he died there on 11 June. He left an eleven-year-old daughter, but no details of a marriage are known.<br>
<br>Since his death Evans has been hailed as a prescient scientific observer&#151;ironically just the pose he adopted to cover his original political purpose. His map of the Atlantic colonies in its 1749 and 1752 states, his essay, and his journal of his 1743 journey, of which the original is lost but which was published in Thomas Pownall's <span class="italic">Topographical Description of such Parts of North America as are Contained in the (Annexed) Map</span> (1776), show him to have been a keen and knowledgeable observer of the natural world, including its geology, geomorphology, and meteorology. He has been hailed as the first to recognize in America signs of isostatic adjustment. This process is held to occur when erosion strips material from an area and it becomes lighter and rises. The area where the eroded material is deposited becomes correspondingly heavier and sinks. The term &#145;isostasy&#146; was coined in 1889, but nearly 150 years earlier Evans had described the process. He described the transport of eroded material from the Appalachians to the plains below, and the isostatic adjustment which would take place if the Great Lakes were drained of all or some of their water (he had inferred the existence of earlier larger lakes from raised beaches around Lake Ontario). His map has also been hailed as &#145;the first known document to show oil at the industry's birthplace&#146;  (facsimile edition by the Ethyl Corporation, 1953). He was certainly an astute and knowledgeable observer, and an ambitious cartographer, though these skills were in his lifetime bent largely to political ends.<br>
