<span class="headword">Walker family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1741&#150;1833), <span class="occ">iron, steel, and lead manufacturers</span>, came to prominence with Jonathan, Samuel, and Aaron Walker, the three sons of <a name="cosubject_62378"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Walker</span>  (1673&#150;1729), <span class="occ">nailmaker and farmer</span>, of Grenoside, in the parish of Ecclesfield, 5 miles north of Sheffield, and his second wife, Ann Hargreaves (<i>d</i>. 1741); there were also three daughters. Following their marriage in 1710 Joseph and Ann lived at Hollin House, Hill Top, Grenoside, and some time after 1722 they moved a short distance to Stubbing House, though they continued to lease Hollin House and two cottages in Grenoside. Joseph Walker was one of the numerous nailmakers who lived and worked in the countryside immediately north of the cutlery-manufacturing district centred on Sheffield. The mining and smelting of iron there were centuries old, and industries were now slowly adapting from charcoal fuel to the use of coke. South Yorkshire was also becoming a centre for the manufacture of steel in cementation furnaces and in the new crucible furnaces pioneered by Benjamin Huntsman. Joseph Walker died at Grenoside on 21 December 1729.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_49118"></a><span class="headword">Aaron Walker</span>  (1718&#150;1777) was born at Hollin House on 19 February 1718. The youngest son of Joseph and Ann, he began to experiment with metal founding in the spring of 1741 with his stepcousin John Crawshaw in a smithy at Grenoside, but met with &#145;bad success&#146;. At this time he worked on local farms, mowing hay and shearing sheep. He married Rhoda, the daughter of Bartholomew Wood, and they had a son and a daughter. An obituary in the firm's records noted: &#145;He had the internal management of the casting and steel trade, in which he certainly exhibited more ingenuity than patience&#146;  (John, 13). He died at Masbrough on 28 January 1777.<br>
<br>His brother <a name="cosubject_49117"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Walker</span>  (1715&#150;1782) was born on 15 November 1715, also at Hollin House. The second son of Joseph and Ann, he became the master at Grenoside endowed school, but supplemented his living by land surveying and making sundials. On 18 March 1742 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1793), the daughter of Thomas Sykes; they had four sons and three daughters. In the autumn of 1741 he and Aaron built an air furnace (a reverberatory furnace) in the nailer's smithy at the rear of Samuel's cottage in Grenoside. They were successful in remelting pig iron and scrap cast-iron, and in casting pots. In 1745, as the business expanded, Samuel resigned his teaching post, and the following year he and Aaron moved a few miles to Masbrough, alongside the newly navigable River Don at Rotherham, where they built a casting house.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_49116"></a><span class="headword">Jonathan Walker</span>  (1710&#150;1778), the eldest son of Joseph and Ann, was also born at Hollin House, Grenoside, on 8 July 1710. He became a partner in his brothers' ironworks on their move to Masbrough in 1746; he was in charge of transport and continued to manage the farms, in which &#145;he always evinced the greatest caution and prudence&#146;  (John, 14). He had a son and two daughters by his first wife, Sarah Platt, but no children by his second wife, Elizabeth Hodgkinson. He died at Grenoside on 5 August 1778 and was buried in Ecclesfield parish churchyard.<br>
<br>The three brothers entered a partnership with John Booth, a nail chapman, and in 1748 built a cementation steel furnace at Masbrough. A similar furnace was erected at Grenoside in 1749&#150;50. By 1787 the Walkers had five cementation steel furnaces at Masbrough, though the production of iron products remained their chief concern. The Masbrough site was expanded in 1753&#150;6 by the purchase of adjacent property at the Yellands and in 1757&#150;9 by leases of the Holmes estate. In 1766 they built their first crucible steel furnace, at Yellands. The business was boosted by government orders for cannon (some of which can still be seen in the city of Quebec), obtained through the patronage of the local landowner, Charles Watson-Wentworth, second marquess of Rockingham, when he was prime minister. The Walkers' business expanded rapidly and they became the leading ironmasters in the north, concentrating on cast and bar iron, as well as sheet, slit iron, tin plate, and many articles of wrought iron. Their fame spread when they built bridges at Yarm and Sunderland. The Southwark Bridge gave them a national reputation.<br>
<br>In 1778 Samuel Walker, in partnership with Richard Fishwick and Archer Ward of Hull, began a white lead manufacturing business at Elswick, near Newcastle upon Tyne. Samuel Walker provided most of the capital, while his partners contributed business and practical expertise. Rising prices for lead encouraged many others to enter this trade about this time. Samuel died at Masbrough on 12 May 1782, and his four sons succeeded him as partners. They opened premises at London (1785), new works at Derby (1792) and Chester (1800), and a warehouse at Liverpool (1801&#150;2).<br>
<br>An obituary of Samuel Walker noted that he was &#145;of a thoughtful, serious disposition, and seldom indulged himself in levity or in any kind of dissipation&#146;  (John, vii). Samuel and Aaron were early converts to Methodism, and about 1758 led the Calvinistic split from the Rotherham Methodist meeting. They built a meeting-house at Masbrough in 1762 and (later) a family mausoleum. In 1795 Jonathan's son, also Jonathan, founded an Independent college at Masbrough to train students for the ministry; the college proved influential in the evangelical revival in the north.<br>
<br>The next generation of Walkers continued to run the metal businesses, but were regarded as gentlemen. They served as justices of the peace and lived in grand new houses, some of which were designed by John Carr of York. Jonathan's son, Jonathan Walker (1756/7&#150;1807), of Ferham House, Rotherham, JP, married his cousin Mary, Samuel's eldest daughter. The line ended with their son, Jonathan Walker of Ferham (1781&#150;1842). Aaron's only son, John Walker, left the firm in 1783 and is thought to have died in Russia without issue. Samuel's four sons were Samuel (1742&#150;1792), Joshua (1750&#150;1815), Joseph (1752&#150;1801), and Thomas (1756&#150;1828). They married into families with similar industrial and nonconformist backgrounds; and Joseph Walker's second son married the daughter of Samuel Walker Parker, who in 1802 had been admitted into the lead partnership (which then became known as Walkers, Parker, &amp; Co.).<br>
<br>In 1833, after a period of uncertain trade and a quarrel among the partners, the Walkers' iron and steel partnership was dissolved. Some capital was invested in a Rotherham bank, but the family gradually moved away from south Yorkshire. The lead trade continued to prove far more lucrative. All the male descendants of the first Samuel Walker owned shares in the lead business and some were actively involved in the business, but most preferred to live as country gentlemen. Nevertheless, the firm's archives show members of the family being trained in metallurgy in Saxony in the 1850s and investigating new lead manufacturing processes in the USA in the 1870s. The managing partners at the firm's various works were still in the 1870s being drawn exclusively from the Walker family. The Walkers only finally withdrew from the lead trade in 1893 after a lengthy dispute between the partners.<br>
<br>The Walkers are a classic example of a family of humble origins who rose rapidly in society through the ingenuity and hard work of the first generation and whose later members gradually withdrew from trade to live as landed gentry. Samuel, Aaron, and Jonathan Walker established an iron-founding business in the period when coke was replacing charcoal as fuel, and they soon diversified into the manufacture of both cementation steel and the new crucible steel. They rank alongside the firm established by Benjamin Huntsman in the transformation of the south Yorkshire heavy metal industries in the second half of the eighteenth century. Samuel, the gloomy genius who was mainly responsible for the firm's success, also established a successful lead business in north-eastern England. His numerous descendants became accepted as country gentry in various parts of the north and north midlands.<br>
