<span class="headword">Mico, Sir  Samuel</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1666), <span class="occ">merchant and benefactor</span>, was the son of Richard Mico and his wife, surnamed Allen. He had a younger brother, John, and a sister, Hester. His family claimed to have originated in the &Icirc;le-de-France, with the name Micault, and to have settled in Devon in the reign of Henry VII. Two lineages developed thereafter, both apparently in Somerset; the junior one stayed in Taunton, but Samuel Mico was either born in London or migrated there. He is first recorded in the capital in the 1630s, when he paid a fee to become a member of the Levant Company and also joined the Mercers' Company. He may well have been trading to the Mediterranean as early as 1633, the likely year of a petition that he presented, with two other London merchants, asking that the ship the <i>Virgin Queen</i>, bound for Genoa, be spared the attentions of the press gang. By the end of the decade Mico was a major importer of currants from Zante and Cephalonia, off the western coast of Greece, and he also traded with Spain and her Atlantic dependencies&#151;in 1637 he and his partners were recorded as importing forty-one bags of saltpetre, an essential ingredient of gunpowder, from the Canaries. His advancement probably owed much to his association with Henry Andrews (<i>d</i>. 1638), a merchant adventurer who was a director of both the Levant Company and the East India Company, and whose daughter Elizabeth he had married by 1635. But their hopes of children were blighted. Their son Henry, baptized in St Michael Bassishaw on 3 June 1635, was buried there on 30 April 1638, only five days after his sister Ann, who had been baptized on 6 January 1637. Another daughter, Elizabeth, was buried in the church on 28 December 1637. A second son, Samuel, was baptized there on 29 November 1638, and moved with his parents to the parish of St Stephen Walbrook. But the tragic sequence continued. A daughter, Margaret, was baptized there on 19 March 1640; her birth clearly killed her mother, who was buried in the chancel of St Stephen's on the same day. And less than a year later, on 24 February 1641, both the surviving Mico children, Samuel and Margaret, were buried alongside their mother.<br>
<br>Although he had royalist sympathies, Mico was able to continue trading during and after the civil wars, in London and also in the borough of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis, where he acquired property and where he was importing goods before 31 May 1650, when he owed &pound;3 18<i>s</i>. 11<i>d</i>. &#145;for the Towne dutyes&#146;  (Weinstock, 82). From 1647 to 1649 he was one of the Levant Company's court assistants, and he continued to trade to the Mediterranean. In 1649 he was paid just over &pound;1000 for 230 bags of Milan rice that had been shipped to Ireland, presumably for the parliamentary forces there. A year later the ship the <i>Unicorn</i>, carrying silk, oil, and other goods belonging to Mico and other English merchants, with an estimated value of &pound;34,000, was seized by the French in the Mediterranean. In April 1651 Mico was one of a group of leading London merchants consulted by the council of trade during a period of debate over commercial policy. Unsurprisingly, he agreed with his associates that customs should not be levied on imported goods when they were re-exported for sale abroad&#151;two years later he was recorded as preparing to export previously imported calicos. But when the first <span class="roman">Navigation Act</span> was passed in October that year, with the intention of protecting English trade by ensuring that goods entering the country did so in English ships, Mico himself fell victim to it. In December 1651 he told the council how he had sent a cargo of cloth to Alicante, near Gibraltar, directing that the proceeds of its sale should be spent on Spanish produce like raisins, figs, and wine, but because no English ship was available these had to be brought home in a German one, and were consequently impounded under the act that had been passed in the meantime. His petition for the restoration of the ship and goods was, however, successful. On 6 December 1653 Mico was elected alderman for Farringdon Without ward, a position he held until 13 May 1656, when he was discharged following payment of a fine of &pound;700. Meanwhile in 1655 he was said to be the chief owner of the <i>Anne Bonaventura</i>, a ship hired in March 1653 by the state of Venice for use in war, and now needed to bring currants from Zante. He seems also to have become involved in banking and credit transfers, for when the grand duke of Tuscany sent an ambassador to England in 1661, preparations for his arrival reportedly included the dispatch of bills &#145;having reached here already in the hands of the merchants Mico for many thousands of pounds sterling&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, 1660&#150;61, 245). He was still paying for the use of wharves in Weymouth and London at the beginning of 1663, and indeed it seems likely that he continued to trade to the Mediterranean until the end of his life, in currants and also in various kinds of cloth. As late as 1666 he petitioned the commissioners of prizes for compensation for four bales of silk taken from a Florentine ship by Sir Jeremiah Smith and subsequently sold at Tangiers.<br>
<br>His ability to prosper under the Commonwealth may have created difficulties for Mico in 1660. Twice that year he was a parliamentary candidate for the borough seat of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis, but without success. But if he needed rehabilitation he had clearly acquired it by 18 March 1665 when he was knighted, an honour doubtless to be associated with his mastership of the Mercers' Company in the year 1665&#150;6. But his health was now beginning to fail. He made his will on 21 September 1665, and died in the following year, some time before 24 May 1666, when his will was proved. He had been living in the parish of St Andrew Undershaft, but it is not known where he was buried. Mico had married again [<i>see below</i>], but though he made numerous bequests to relations and godchildren, he had no recorded child at the time of his death. An evidently lively religious faith may help to account for the generous charitable provisions contained in his will&#151;he bequeathed his soul &#145;into the hands of God my maker hoping assuredly through the only merits of Jesus Christ my saviour to be made partaker of life everlasting&#146;. But another motivation, in the light of his repeated concern for the upbringing of the young, may have come from his childlessness. The legacies were divided between Weymouth and London. To the former he left his house at Melcombe Regis, &#145;in the east end of the key of that towne&#146;, stipulating that its &#145;profitt&#146; was to pay for the apprenticeships of three poor children every year, and also &pound;500 to buy lands, in order to finance an annual sermon in Melcombe church, together with alms for &#145;tenn poore decayed seamen &hellip; who are to be at the hearinge of that sermon&#146;. And in London he left &pound;500 to Christ's Hospital, to buy lands &#145;to the benefit yearly of the poore Children of that Hospitall&#146;, and another &pound;500 to the Mercers' Company, in order to provide interest-free loans of &pound;100 apiece to &#145;five young men of that Company&#146;, to help them start their careers. The loans were to be repaid at the end of three years, whereupon the money was to be lent out again &#145;to other five young men every three years successively gratis&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/320, fols. 206<i>v</i>&#150;207).<br>
<br>Sir Samuel's residuary legatee was another Samuel Mico, described as the son of John and so possibly his nephew. Among the other beneficiaries of his will was his widow, who received &#145;all my houshold stuffe Plate and Jewells&#146; as well as the portion due to her by London custom. <a name="cosubject_96272"></a><span class="headword">Jane Mico <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Robinson]</span></span>, Lady Mico  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1634, <em>d.</em> 1670)<span class="occ"></span>, whom Samuel married at an unknown date, was apparently the elder of the two daughters of William Robinson of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, and his wife, Elizabeth Burrell. Her sister Elizabeth married Andrew Barker of Fairford, Gloucestershire, who clearly became friendly with his brother-in-law, since Sir Samuel named him as an executor. Lady Mico's own will, which she drew up on 1 July 1670, shows that she had a place in a network of contacts comprising relations by birth and by marriage. Like Sir Samuel, she used her will to make a profession of religious faith, commending her soul to God, &#145;hoping and assuredly believing through the onely death and passion and merritts of my deere Savior Jesus Christ to be maide partaker of Life everlasting&#146;, and also to record her warm affection for &#145;my deere deceased husband&#146;, alongside whom she wished to be buried. She left &pound;1500 to build an almshouse in London, in a place to be decided upon by her executors, or failing them by the Mercers' Company, for ten poor widows over the age of fifty. A further &pound;400 was given to the town of Fairford, to buy lands whose revenues were to &#145;put out fore poore boyes of that Towne Prentices&#146;, they being (in terms that underline her religious motivation) &#145;such as can say the Lords Praier the Ten Comandements the Beleefe and the Church Catechisme&#146;. Another &pound;100 was left to an existing almshouse at Cheshunt. Lady Mico had died by 9 December 1670, when her will was proved, and all these bequests subsequently took effect. The London almshouse was eventually built in Stepney, and the requisite property was duly acquired in Fairford, though in the nineteenth century it became increasingly difficult to find masters for the apprentices, and in 1877 Lady Mico's charity was amalgamated with Fairford free school.<br>
<br>Of all Lady Mico's bequests the most far-reaching in its effects was one intended to consolidate both her husband's concern for his family and her own desire to forge links between that family and the others closely related to herself. She bequeathed &pound;2000 to the younger Samuel Mico on condition that he marry one of her own nieces, a daughter of either her sister Elizabeth Barker or her brother William Robinson. If he did not do so, then &pound;1000 was to go instead &#145;to Redeeme poor slaves&#146;&#151;a clause that at this date certainly meant Christians enslaved by the pirates of Tangier. She also provided that when Samuel came of age he was to give &#145;a full discharge&#146; to her husband's executors &#145;for his estate in thare hands&#146;, and that upon his doing so he was to receive another &pound;1000. But this gift too was conditional, upon the discharge being made to the satisfaction of the executors. If it was not, this money was also to be used &#145;to Redeeme poore slaves in what manner my Executors shall think most convenient&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/334, fols. 322<i>r</i>&#150;323<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>In 1668 the younger Samuel Mico had brought what appears to have been a collusive action in chancery against Lady Mico and her fellow executors, in order to obtain funding for his own education, for which he estimated &pound;100 per annum would be sufficient. The money was evidently forthcoming, for on 6 May 1670 he matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, aged sixteen. At almost exactly the same time he sued in chancery for the whole of Sir Samuel's estate, but this time the executors demurred; they were still trying to recover money owed to Sir Samuel, and in any case the plaintiff had not yet reached the age of twenty-one. Some five years later, however, the younger Samuel came of age and entered upon his inheritance, allegedly worth &pound;60,000, and presumably also received Lady Mico's second conditional legacy. But he never obtained the first, for around the beginning of December 1679 he died, intestate and unmarried. As a result, in the following year &pound;1000 were by order of the court of chancery used to buy a rent of &pound;50 from two London wharves, the money to be used, as directed, for the redemption of slaves. No further action was taken until 1731 when, by a further decree of chancery, three-quarters of the charity's funds were to be transferred to Sir Charles Wager, who had connections with Jamaica, with a view to their being applied to the purposes of the original legacy. Again, nothing was done. In 1827 chancery referred the bequest to Lord Henley, master in chancery, who was to devise a scheme whereby the legacy could be used in a way that was as near as possible to Lady Mico's intention. In the meantime, possibly as a result of his links with Weymouth, the slavery abolitionist Thomas Fowell Buxton took an interest in the legacy, whose value had now accumulated to about &pound;120,000, producing an annual yield of &pound;3,625.<br>
<br>Along with Stephen Lushington, Buxton drew up a plan to divert Lady Mico's bequest to the education of emancipated slaves in the West Indies. An order to this effect was made by the master of the rolls in July 1835, and the first trustees of Lady Mico's reconstituted charity, who included Buxton and Lushington, met for the first time in August 1835. They decided that the bequest should be open to all religious denominations, and that &#145;the grand object of this charity shall be the promotion of education in general, but especially of religious education&#146;  (Cundall, 25). Assisted by government grants, Lady Mico's trustees established a network of infant schools and teacher training colleges across the British West Indies, but after 1847, when the government subsidy lapsed, the charity's efforts were confined to Jamaica, Antigua, and St Lucia. From 1890 the trust concentrated solely upon Jamaica. The centrepiece of the trust's activities was the Mico Institution, a pioneering teacher training college founded in Kingston in 1836 and a precursor of Mico Teachers' College, which continues the work.<br>
