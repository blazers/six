<span class="headword">Stark,  Adam</span>  (1784&#150;1867), <span class="occ">bookseller and antiquary</span>, was born on 24 February 1784 in Edinburgh. His parentage has not been established. According to his great-grandson he attended Edinburgh high school, and in 1803 or 1804 went into partnership with his cousin John Stark as a printer and bookseller in Edinburgh. He was to remain in this trade all his working life, but did not stay long in his native city; he moved first to Manchester, then (<i>c</i>.1807) to Hull and to Lincoln, before settling in Gainsborough in 1814. In Lincoln he published the short-lived <span class="italic">Hull and Lincoln Chronicle</span> in 1809, and in the same year married Jane Trotter (<i>b</i>. 1788), of Lincoln, with whom he had four children, two of whom survived infancy, before she died in 1813. Once settled in Gainsborough, Stark married, on 22 February 1815, Harriet, the second daughter of John Mozley and sister of the bookseller Henry Mozley, to whose business he appears to have succeeded in that year. (Harriet was the aunt of James Bowling Mozley, Thomas Mozley, and Anne Mozley.) In addition to his bookselling and printing business in Gainsborough market place Stark acted as postmaster for the town, served as a churchwarden from 1820 to 1822, and was prominent in many of the urban movements and improvements of the period. He satisfied his journalistic ambitions by becoming north Lincolnshire news-gatherer for the <span class="italic">Lincoln, Rutland and Stamford Mercury</span>, the leading county newspaper, whose moderate liberal politics probably suited his own views. He was also the author of several publications, but is chiefly remembered for his <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of Gainsburgh</span> (1817; 2nd edn, 1843).<br>
<br>An industrious antiquary, Stark sought out and used a range of local manuscript sources, but was not familiar with the major national collections, and today his work is most valuable for its portrait of Gainsborough as an improving early nineteenth-century town and port, taken from his personal knowledge and experience. Harriet Mozley died in 1835, having had ten children, and in 1838 Stark married his third wife, Sarah Wooton, of Newington, Kent. She died in 1842. Stark died at Gainsborough on 31 December 1867, and his library was sold the following year.<br>
