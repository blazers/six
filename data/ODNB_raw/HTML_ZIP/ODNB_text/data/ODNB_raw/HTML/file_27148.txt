<span class="headword">Terry,  Edward</span>  (1589/90&#150;1660), <span class="occ">travel writer</span>, was born at Leigh, Kent, possibly the son of Richard Terry (<i>d</i>. 1647), landowner. He attended Rochester School before matriculating from Christ Church, Oxford, on 1 July 1608, aged eighteen. He graduated BA on 26 November 1611 and proceeded MA on 6 July 1614. The East India Company engaged him as a chaplain and in February 1616 he sailed in the flagship of the fleet. Having taken in the Cape of Good Hope and seen its Khoi-Khoi (Hottentot) inhabitants, near the Comoro Islands they overtook a Portuguese carrack which fired on the leading ship and refused to parley. In the ensuing fight at close quarters with the flagship, the English commander was killed and the disabled carrack was run ashore and burnt by her crew. After arriving at Surat in September Terry accepted an engagement as chaplain to Sir Thomas Roe, and the next February he joined the ambassador near Ujjain, Malwa (Madhya Pradesh). They followed the emperor, Jahangir, and his vast entourage to Mandu some 60 miles further south. Here Terry shared a room with Thomas Coryate and later a tent when, in October, Jahangir moved again towards Ahmadabad, Gujarat. At Ahmadabad in May 1618 Terry survived an epidemic which killed several of Roe's suite; in September Roe, mission accomplished, and the survivors (one in four according to Terry) left for Surat. They sailed for home in February 1619, arriving in The Downs that September.<br>
<br>Terry had spent slightly over twenty-seven months in India, seeing only parts of Gujarat and Malwa, but an enquiring mind and linguistic ability enabled him to compile a historically valuable account of the entire Mughal dominions and their varied inhabitants. He learned some Persian, the language of the court, and some Arabic, that of the learned. He found Hindustani &#145;a smooth tongue and easie to be pronounced&#146;  (Purchas, 1905, 1474). Mutually ignoring political and religious differences, he and the Jesuit in charge of Portuguese affairs at court conversed in Latin: Father Corsi was &#145;a very great intelligencer, knowing all news that might be had&#146;  (Terry, 444). In 1622 Terry presented a manuscript account to Charles, prince of Wales, which was transmitted to Samuel Purchas who published an edited version in part two of the 1625 edition of <span class="italic">Purchas his Pilgrimes</span>. Terry's own <span class="italic">A Voyage to East India</span> (1655) is a revision of this manuscript, expanded probably at least seven times, mainly by religious disquisition. It contains a full-length engraving of Jahangir, and some copies include a version of the important map (BL, K115/22) drawn by William Baffin and engraved by Renold Elstrack from information accumulated by Roe, whose sources included Terry.<br>
<br>Terry returned for a period to Christ Church and was afternoon lecturer at Carfax, Oxford, in 1621 and 1622. Anthony Wood asserts that he then obtained a &#145;small cure&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.505&#150;7), and by 1625 or 1626, when his son James was born, Terry had married. Whether this was to Elizabeth, his wife in 1660, is not clear; it is possible he was the Edward Terry who married Elizabeth Bland on 17 January 1630 at St Margaret Moyses, London. On 26 August the previous year he had become rector of Great Greenford, Middlesex. A second son, Edward, was born in the early 1630s. Terry remained at Great Greenford during the 1640s and 1650s, apparently acceptable to the authorities. His <span class="italic">Pseudeleutheria, or, Lawlesse Liberty</span> (1646) was a sermon preached before the lord mayor at St Paul's on 16 August that year, while <span class="italic">The Merchants and Mariners Preservation and Thanksgiving</span> (1649) was a sermon preached to his old employers, the East India Company, at St Andrew Undershaft. Following the Restoration he published <span class="italic">A Character of His Most Sacred Majesty King Charles the IId</span> (1660) in the hope, Wood claimed to have heard from James Terry, of obtaining the deanery of Windsor, but he died at Greenford on 8 October that year. He was buried in the chancel of his church on 10 October. His wife, Elizabeth, died in 1661, and was buried at Greenford on 22 August. Terry was briefly succeeded as rector by his second son and namesake, who had been a fellow of University College, Oxford, and rector of Amersham, but he was ejected in 1662. James Terry was also ejected from his rectory of Michelmersh, Hampshire. Both brothers were subsequently licensed as nonconformist ministers. Edward Terry's account of his voyage continued to receive attention: his narrative was appended to <span class="italic">The Travels of Pietro della Vale</span> (1665); a French translation appeared in 1663 and was reissued in 1696; and there were two Dutch translations in 1707 and 1727.<br>
