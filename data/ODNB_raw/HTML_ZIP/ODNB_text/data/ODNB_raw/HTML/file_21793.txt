<span class="headword">Pelham, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1429), <span class="occ">landowner and administrator</span>, was the son of Thomas Pelham of Warbleton, Sussex, and of Agnes, daughter of Robert Gensing and coheir of the manor of Gensing, Sussex. Probably of age by 1376, in September 1387 Pelham allegedly mounted a full-scale night assault in Cambridgeshire (a county in which he also had some family interests) on Sir John Shardlow's house at Fulbourn in order to abduct&#151;and then marry&#151;Margaret (1363&#150;1390), widow of Shardlow's son, and heir in her own right of Sir Roger Grey of Cavendish, Suffolk. Margaret died in 1390; possibly in 1399 but certainly by May 1400 Pelham had married Joan (<i>d</i>. 1439), widow of Sir Hugh Zouche and daughter of John Bramshott. She brought to Pelham her first husband's lands in Cambridgeshire and Sussex. But Pelham's sole surviving child was apparently an illegitimate son, John, who was knighted in France in 1415, and to whom he left much of his property.<br>
<br>Pelham's administrative career began in the service of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, on whose 1386 Spanish campaign he probably served and who in 1393 made him constable of Pevensey Castle for life. Posts in the archbishop of Canterbury's Sussex estates soon followed. He later served on royal commissions, including one seizing the goods of Richard (III) Fitzalan, earl of Arundel, after the earl's execution in 1397. Pelham's disappearance later that year makes it likely he followed Henry Bolingbroke into exile. On the latter's return Pelham regained control of Pevensey Castle and was besieged there by forces loyal to Richard II in July 1399, creating an important diversion from Bolingbroke's landing in Yorkshire.<br>
<br>The new Lancastrian regime soon displayed its confidence in one of its most dedicated southern partisans. Pelham was knighted on 13 October 1399 before Henry IV's coronation, then made royal sword-bearer and a knight of the household. His Pevensey constableship was confirmed, and buttressed with nearby lands. He represented Sussex in parliament continuously from 1399 to 1407, except in 1401&#150;2 when he was sheriff of Sussex with Surrey instead. Henry IV found it increasingly convenient to employ him in neighbouring counties. He became a commissioner of array&#151;and, more briefly, a justice of the peace&#151;for Surrey and Hampshire as well as Sussex. After the death of William Wykeham in 1404 he was joint keeper of the bishopric of Winchester's temporalities for six months, and then took over keepership of the New forest, as well as becoming chief steward of the duchy of Lancaster estates south of the Trent. In 1409 Henry granted to him for life the duchy estates in Sussex, worth up to &pound;270 a year&#151;making him possibly the greatest landowner in Sussex, ahead of Thomas Fitzalan, earl of Arundel.<br>
<br>Pelham also had employments of more national significance. Entrusted with the removal of the deposed Richard II to Leeds Castle from the Tower of London late in October 1399, in 1405 he had Edward, duke of York (<i>d</i>. 1415), committed to his custody at Pevensey as suspected of treason, and from 1406 to 1409 Edmund and Roger Mortimer. He was a member of the royal council from 1404 until the restriction in membership in 1406, a period that coincided with his treasurership for war (11 November 1404 &#150; 19 June 1406), jointly with Thomas Neville, Lord Furnival&#151;a function that both incumbents sought to resign and finally induced parliament to support them in doing so.<br>
<br>Pelham was friendly with Prince Thomas (later duke of Clarence)&#151;who named him as an executor in 1417&#151;and with Archbishop Thomas Arundel (<i>d</i>. 1414), rather than with Prince Henry. When the latter took advantage of the king's illness in 1409, therefore, Pelham ceased to receive his usual commissions (even local ones) and patronage. The removal of the prince of Wales's friends in 1411 offered compensation: Pelham became treasurer (20 December 1411&#150;20 March 1413) and was granted new Sussex lands which ultimately brought his landed income to over &pound;870 a year, giving him a dominant position in the county after the death of the earl of Arundel in 1415.<br>
<br>Pelham's last service to Henry IV was to act as an executor of his will&#151;a troublesome and protracted exercise in deficit finance. On Henry V's accession Pelham lost both the post of treasurer (to his local rival Arundel) and his Lancaster stewardship. Nevertheless, the new king was willing to employ Pelham on local commissions, and also on a powerful embassy to France (10 July&#150;3 October 1414). Further important prisoners were sent to him at Pevensey, including James I of Scotland (for whose release he was one of the negotiators in 1423&#150;4), and the dowager queen and alleged sorceress, Joan of Navarre (<i>d</i>. 1439).<br>
<br>Pelham returned to the royal council between Henry V's departure for France in July 1417 and the king's death in August 1422; he was a friend of Thomas Langley (<i>d</i>. 1437), chancellor from July 1417 to July 1424. He also again represented Sussex in the Commons in 1422 and 1427, perhaps largely in an attempt to facilitate the conclusion of Henry IV's troubled testamentary affairs. Pelham died on 12 February 1429, and was buried in the Cistercian abbey of Robertsbridge, Sussex. His monastic interests also involved the rebuilding of the collapsed Augustinian priory of Holy Trinity, Hastings, on his patrimony at Warbleton. Pelham's second wife, Joan, outlived him by ten years.<br>
