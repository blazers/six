<span class="headword">Bonner,  George Wilmot <span class="st"> [George William]</span></span>  (1796&#150;1836), <span class="occ">wood-engraver</span>, was born on 24 May 1796 at Devizes, Wiltshire. Having been educated at Bath, he was apprenticed first to an uncle, Allen Robert Branston, a wood-engraver in London, and later to James Henry Vizetelly, of Vizetelly and Branston. He became a proficient draughtsman and engraver, employing the white-line style of engraving, popularized by Thomas Bewick, in a competent if pedestrian way. His greatest skill was his ability to produce a gradation of tints by using a combination of blocks.<br>
<br>Bonner was also a good instructor, and several of his apprentices became important engravers. Most notably he trained William James Linton (from 1828), who lived with him for some time at 12 Canterbury Row, Kennington (Bonner's address in trade journals between 1832 and 1836). Linton described Bonner as &#145;a clever artist, and a good master&#146;  (Linton, 191&#150;2), and recalled how his master had taught him all the processes of wood-engraving from the cutting of woodblocks to the most delicate graver work, and had encouraged him to sketch from nature (including from animals at London Zoo) to avoid becoming a mechanical copyist. Another talented apprentice of Bonner was W. H. Powis. By contrast, Henry Vizetelly, who came to Bonner around 1835, dismissed him as a &#145;second-rate wood engraver, who intensified in his woodcuts the conventional mannerisms of the bold watercolour drawings which he was somewhat adept at producing&#146;  (Vizetelly, 119&#150;20). He finished his training elsewhere, on account of Bonner's unexpected death on 3 January 1836, which Vizetelly ascribed to brain fever. Bonner was apparently unmarried.<br>
<br>One of Bonner's first engravings was a frontispiece designed by Robert Cruikshank for John Cumberland's <span class="roman">British Theatre</span> and <span class="roman">Minor Theatre</span> series (1820 onwards). Another was his engraving of W. H. Brooke's painting <span class="italic">Mercy</span> (inspired by William Collins's &#145;An Ode on Mercy&#146;), which was printed in colour in William Savage's <span class="italic">Practical Hints on Decorative Printing</span> (1822), a milestone in the history of chromoxylography. In its preface Savage noted that he had used engravers who would &#145;show what the art is capable of producing at the present day in England&#146;  (p. v).<br>
<br>Above all, Bonner excelled in his portrayal of animals. He produced plates for William Pickering's edition of Izaak Walton and Charles Cotton's <span class="italic">The Compleat Angler</span> (1825); engraved numerous vignettes after William Harvey's designs for James Northcote's <span class="italic">Fables</span> (1828; second series 1833); and provided wood-engravings for two zoological publications by Edward Turner Bennett: <span class="italic">The Tower Menagerie</span> (1829) and <span class="italic">Zoological Gardens</span> (1835). Quite frequently, too, he produced landscapes and topographical views. Many vignettes were commissioned by William Kidd for his guidebooks, including <span class="italic">Picturesque Pocket Companion to Margate, Ramsgate, Broadstairs</span> (1831) and <span class="italic">Kidd's New Guide to the &#145;Lions&#146; of London</span> (1832), while numerous views by Bonner enlivened Arthur Freeling's <span class="italic">Picturesque Excursions</span> (1839).<br>
<br>Possibly the best-known publication on which Bonner worked was Francis Douce's <span class="italic">The Dance of Death</span>, printed at the Chiswick Press in 1833. Douce pointed out in the preface that the facsimile designs from the Lyons edition of 1547 had been &#145;executed with consummate skill and fidelity by Messrs Bonner and Byfield, two of our best artists in the line of wood engraving. They may very justly be regarded as scarcely distinguishable from their fine originals&#146;  (pp. v&#150;vi). Certainly these engravings were far superior to most available at the time. Bonner signed his work in a spidery hand: G. W. Bonner; G. Bonner, SC; Bonner; G. B.; G. B. Sc; G. W. B.<br>
