<span class="headword">Ayloffe <span class="st"> [Ayliffe]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1645&#150;1685), <span class="occ">satirist and conspirator</span>, was born in Foxley, Wiltshire, the younger son of John Ayliffe (<i>b</i>. 1611?). He matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in July 1662 and was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1664. An unyielding opponent of the Stuart monarchy, he was &#145;one of the most consistently committed radicals of the century&#146;&#151;according to Sir Roger L'Estrange, there were few &#145;more daring men for a desperate exploit&#146;  (Greaves &amp; Zaller, <span class="italic">BDBR</span>, 1.31). Ayloffe first became prominent in October 1673, when he placed a wooden shoe in the speaker's chair in the House of Commons, as a symbol of pernicious French influence. <span class="italic">Nostradamus's Prophecy</span>, a poem probably by Ayloffe and published in 1672, had referred to &#145;wooden shoes&#146; as a sign of subservience to France, praised &#145;Venetian liberty&#146;, and attacked parliamentary corruption  (Lord, <span class="italic">Poems on Affairs of State</span>, 185&#150;9).<br>
<br>At the time of the Third Anglo-Dutch War, in 1671&#150;3, Ayloffe was a leading member, along with his close friend and associate Andrew Marvell, in a clandestine organization headed by Peter Du Moulin, working in the interests of William of Orange against France. Ayloffe is probably the author, or co-author with Du Moulin, of the influential pamphlet <span class="italic">Englands Appeale from the Private Caballe at Whitehall</span> (1673), which in Haley's words &#145;did more than anything else to identify the French alliance in foreign affairs with the dangers of Popery at home&#146;  (Haley, 97&#150;9). In 1677 he petitioned for pardon for &#145;printing <span class="italic">The Appeal</span> and <span class="italic">The Votes of Parliament</span> &hellip; for which he has suffered two years exile&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fourth Report</span>, HMC, 235). <span class="italic">The Votes of Parliament</span> may refer to a detailed satiric attack on parliamentary corruption circulated in 1677 under the title <span class="italic">A Seasonable Argument</span> (an earlier version, BL, Lansdowne MS 805, dates from 1672), on which Marvell and Ayloffe are likely to have collaborated  (Chernaik, 97, 226).<br>
<br>During the <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span> crisis, Ayloffe was a trusted lieutenant of Shaftesbury&#151;one of the two &#145;chief agents of the said Earl&#146;&#151;and an active member of the whig <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92786', "Green Ribbon Club")</script>  (Lord, &#145;Satire and sedition&#146;, 260&#150;61). He was involved in the Rye House plot in 1683, claiming that &#145;it was impossible England could ever be happy under such a government as we lived under, for the King designs to bring in arbitrary power&#146;, and, under a warrant of arrest for high treason, escaped to Holland; at this time his estates in Wiltshire were confiscated. In Holland, he continued to plot an insurrection against the hated Stuarts (on a secret mission to England to canvass support, he found that his reputation &#145;as an atheist&#146; made him <i>persona non grata</i> with nonconformist ministers), and in 1685 he served as colonel of a regiment of foot in an unsuccessful invasion of Scotland led by the ninth earl of Argyll, a premature attempt to overthrow James II. After being captured and attempting suicide (stabbing himself with a penknife), he was executed as a traitor at the Temple gate on 30 October 1685, refusing to testify against his fellow conspirators and offering prayers on the scaffold &#145;to preserve the Protestant Religion&#146; (ibid., 262&#150;5; Greaves &amp; Zaller, <span class="italic">BDBR</span>, 1.31).<br>
<br>Nearly all Ayloffe's extant poems are political and attest to his republican sympathies. &#145;Marvell's Ghost&#146; (1678) imagines the poet returning from the dead to prophesy the downfall of the &#145;spurious race&#146; of Stuarts, who have &#145;laid waste the commonweal&#146; and have brought upon themselves &#145;those resentments &hellip; That drove the Tarquins out of Rome&#146;  (Lord, <span class="italic">Poems on Affairs of State</span>, 1.285&#150;6). &#145;Britannia and Raleigh&#146; (1674), one of a number of satires falsely attributed to Marvell in the early editions of <span class="italic">Poems on Affairs of State</span>, is generally accepted as Ayloffe's. Explicitly attacking monarchy as an institution, it lavishes praise on &#145;the sage Venetian state&#146; as well as the two Brutuses, heroes of the republican pantheon, and ends with an open call to rebellion: &#145;No poisonous tyrant on thy ground shall live&#146;  (ibid., 1.228&#150;36). An elegy on Sir Thomas Armstrong, executed in 1684 for his part in the Rye House plot, is attributed to Ayloffe in BL, Harley MS 7319: it is equally uncompromising in its attacks on monarchy, calling for the &#145;destruction&#146; of the tyrannous Stuarts (&#145;<i>Tarquin</i> and <i>Nero</i> were but types of thee&#146;) and praising Armstrong as &#145;a worthy Patriot&#146; like &#145;<i>Brutus</i> or just <i>Cato</i>&#146;. Other poems probably by Ayloffe include two poems attributed to him in <span class="italic">Poems on Affairs of State</span> (1697), &#145;A Litany&#146; (1681), a satire on high tory Anglican clergy, and &#145;Satyr&#146; (1684?), attacking the duke of York as tyrant-in-waiting. More doubtful attributions to Ayloffe include &#145;Advice to a Painter to Draw the Duke by&#146; (1673), an anti-Catholic satire on the duke of York, where the weight of evidence favours Henry Savile as author, and &#145;Oceana and Britannia&#146; (1681).<br>
