<span class="headword">Hume <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wigington]</span>,  Sophia</span>  (1702/3&#150;1774), <span class="occ">Quaker minister and writer</span>, was born in Charles Town, South Carolina, one of the two children of Henry Wigington (<i>d</i>. 1722), deputy secretary of South Carolina, and his wife, Susanna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bayley (<i>d</i>. 1733). Sophia's maternal grandmother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9505/', "Mary Fisher")</script>, one of the first two Quakers to come to Massachusetts in 1656. On her arrival Fisher and her companion, Ann Austin, had suffered the indignity of having their books burnt and their bodies searched for &#145;witch-marks&#146; before being banished from Massachusetts. Four years later, on a religious journey, Fisher met the young Sultan Mohammed IV, who was encamped near Adrianople. Unlike the Boston Calvinists he was moved by the visit and impressed by their spirit. One of the important early Quaker &#145;publishers of truth&#146;, Fisher's example and the events of her life had a lasting effect upon her granddaughter. Another influence on Sophia's early life was her father. Though her mother was a Friend, Henry and Susanna Wigington had been married according to the Anglican rite, and Sophia was educated to appreciate &#145;the pleasures and delusive amusements of this world&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1721 Sophia married Robert Hume (<i>d</i>. 1737), a prominent Charles Town lawyer, landowner, and public official. A year later, when Sophia's father died, the couple inherited all his black slaves and &#145;all moneys due in the province&#146;; as a result they became very wealthy. Sophia's husband died on 1 October 1737 and four years later, aged thirty-eight, Sophia turned her back on Anglicanism and her life as a rich landowner and joined the Society of Friends. Since there were very few Quakers in Charles Town she moved to London.<br>
<br>Like her grandmother Mary Fisher, Sophia Hume was soon drawn to make a religious visit to her natal land, which she did in 1748, despite the fact that her family, friends, and two children&#151;Alexander and Susanna&#151;greatly disapproved of the step that she had taken. While in South Carolina she became convinced of the impossibility for her of accepting a &#145;pleasure-loving life made possible by slavery&#146;. The result was what became her best-known work, <span class="italic">An Exhortation to the Inhabitants of the Province of South Carolina</span>, published in Philadelphia in 1748 by Benjamin Franklin and reprinted several times. According to the Quaker historian Rufus Jones the work:<blockquote>is a simple little book, with some chaff, but with some real wheat in it, and it gives a clear idea of the type of preaching which was heard in all the meetings of the South as the itinerant messenger came upon them. (Jones, 300&#150;01)</blockquote>It is said that the anti-slavery pioneer John Woolman (1720&#150;1772) was on the committee of Philadelphia Friends to whom the <span class="italic">Exhortation</span> was submitted. Like Woolman, Sophia believed that there was &#145;one truth on which all I have to say to you greatly depends, namely that <i>all mankind</i> have within them a measure and manifestation of the Light, Spirit or Grace of God&#146;.<br>
<br>In Philadelphia, aside from Woolman, Sophia Hume came to know other noteworthy Friends; John Smith speaks of her often in his diary and she made Israel Pemberton's home her residence. She is also credited with an anonymous pamphlet on the practice of inoculation of smallpox, and if this is so it suggests that in her youth she &#145;languished under a great degree of infection from smallpox&#146;. Ironically on her return to England, by 1772, she again encountered John Woolman, on his fateful journey that ended in York with his death from the disease. Doubtless the two had much to discuss concerning the slave trade, with Sophia having valuable experience of the situation in South Carolina, where large numbers of slaves were an important aspect of the plantation economy. In a letter of 7 July 1772 she said that she had &#145;great unity with Woolman&#146; and that it was to her that he entrusted the final portions (the &#145;sea journey&#146;) of his remarkable <span class="italic">Journal</span>, with permission to revise and reorder his text.<br>
<br>When Sophia Hume was in London in 1772 William Forster (1747&#150;1824), a leading Quaker, described her as &#145;plain in dress as John Woolman for a man since her convincement&#146;. For Rufus Jones she was &#145;a person of some refinement and culture, and a woman of very unusual religious experience&#146;  (Jones, 300). In addition to the <span class="italic">Exhortation</span> she published several more religious essays, including <span class="italic">A Caution to such as Observe Days and Times</span> (<i>c</i>.1763) and <span class="italic">Extracts from Divers Antient Testimonies</span> (1766). She died suddenly, of apoplexy, on 26 January 1774 at White Hart Court, Gracechurch Street, London; she was buried at the Quaker burial-ground at Bunhill Fields. Her son, Alexander, was present but her daughter and son-in-law were in France at the time. William Forster said that the memorial meeting was &#145;the largest concourse of people I ever saw (at Gracechurch Street Meeting) except at Yearly Meeting&#146;  (testimony, RS Friends, Lond.).<br>
