<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Walter,  Hubert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1205), <span class="occ">justiciar and archbishop of Canterbury</span>, was born during Stephen's reign, probably at West Dereham, Norfolk, and retained his East Anglian connections throughout his life.<h2>
<a name="Originsandearlycareer"></a>Origins and early career</h2>Hubert was the son of Sir Hervey Walter, a Norfolk knight of middling status, and Matilda de Valognes, daughter of Theobald de Valognes, lord of Parham, Suffolk, and Hickling, Norfolk. Hubert Walter's most important relationship, however, was with his mother's sister Bertha de Valognes and her husband <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10795/', "Ranulf de Glanville")</script>, sheriff of Yorkshire and, after 1178, justiciar for Henry II. Hubert and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4207/', "Theobald Butler")</script> were brought up in Glanville's household, acquiring there a set of connections that in Hubert's case would influence the rest of his career.<br>
<br>Hubert Walter is not known to have spent any time in the schools, and in later life his lack of formal education was sometimes an embarrassment to him. He received a wealth of administrative and legal training in Glanville's household, however, and it was in his uncle's service that he rose to prominence around the royal court during the 1180s. As Ranulf de Glanville's chief deputy in England, Walter was involved in the full range of administrative business for which the justiciar was responsible, serving as one of the barons of the exchequer during the 1180s, and sitting regularly with Glanville and others as a justice of the exchequer court. He developed considerable expertise as a justice during these years, and several of his legal opinions are cited respectfully in the contemporary law book known as <span class="italic">Glanvill</span> (1187&#150;9). During the last few years of Henry II's reign, the king employed him in chancery and diplomatic work also. Walter carried money to south Wales for the king's troops, and conveyed messages between England and the king in France. On Henry II's orders, he also tried to mediate the dispute between Archbishop Baldwin of Canterbury and the monks of Christ Church over Baldwin's proposal to establish a house of canons at Lambeth.<br>
<br>In 1186, during a vacancy at York, the king appointed Hubert Walter dean of York Cathedral. A few months later the chapter named him as one of five candidates to be the new archbishop, but the king refused to accept any of the nominations and the see remained vacant. In 1188, in a fitting acknowledgement of the debts he owed his patron, Walter founded a Premonstratensian monastery at West Dereham to pray for himself, his family, and his aunt and uncle, Bertha and Ranulf de Glanville.<br>
<br>When Richard I came to the throne in 1189, Ranulf de Glanville was compelled to resign as justiciar. Many of Glanville's followers also lost their offices at this time. Hubert Walter, however, survived the purge, and although disappointed yet again of the archbishopric of York, which went to the new king's half-brother Geoffrey, on 15 September 1189 he was elected bishop of Salisbury at King Richard's command. Consecrated in St Katherine's Chapel, Westminster, on 22 October 1189 by his long-time friend, Archbishop Baldwin of Canterbury, Walter quickly found himself embroiled yet again in attempts to settle the dispute between the archbishop and the monks of Christ Church.<h2>
<a name="Crusader"></a>Crusader</h2>The new bishop of Salisbury spent little time in his see. Like others of the Glanville faction, including Ranulf himself, Hubert Walter had vowed to go on the crusade that King Richard was now gathering in earnest. Until Richard's departure in December 1189, Walter was almost constantly at court. Thereafter he may have visited Salisbury briefly, but by March 1190 he was in Normandy with the king. After a brief visit to England, he was back on the continent from 3 July until 5 August, when he set sail from Marseilles for the Holy Land.<br>
<br>Hubert Walter arrived in Tyre on 16 September 1190, in a party that included Ranulf de Glanville and Archbishop Baldwin. In early October they joined the crusader army besieging Acre. Conditions in the crusader camp were terrible, and the leaders of the English contingent, including Glanville, Baldwin, and the earl of Derby, were all dead by the end of November. As bishop of Salisbury, Walter thus became the leader of the English contingent at Acre, and quickly began to reorganize the camp; an executor of Baldwin's will, he used the archbishop's possessions to pay wages to the sentries and buy food for the starving common soldiers. He led sorties against Saladin's camp, and also ministered to the religious needs of the army. Morale rose; and when King Richard at last arrived at Acre in June 1191, having spent the winter in Messina, he found the army in far better shape than it had been six months before.<br>
<br>Hubert Walter's stature in the crusading army continued to grow after Richard's arrival. He distinguished himself in several battles, and handled a variety of sensitive negotiations between the competing crusade leaders. In August 1192, when Richard fell ill, it was Walter who arranged a truce in the fighting. Soon afterwards he negotiated a more permanent peace treaty with the Muslim leader Saladin that guaranteed free access for Western Christians to Jerusalem and restored Latin services in Bethlehem, Nazareth, and the church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Walter then fulfilled his crusader's vow by leading one of the first contingents of Western pilgrims to visit Jerusalem under the terms of the new peace treaty.<h2>
<a name="Archbishopandjusticiar"></a>Archbishop and justiciar</h2>Hubert Walter and King Richard both left the Holy Land in October 1192. Walter's route home took him to Sicily and then to Rome, where he met with Pope Celestine III in January 1193. It was probably in Rome that rumours of Richard's captivity first reached him. By March 1193 Walter, accompanied by the exchequer clerk William de Ste M&egrave;re-&Eacute;glise, had found the king at Ochsenfurt, on the River Main. They were the first of his subjects to reach him. Walter immediately began negotiating terms for Richard's release. In late March he and Ste M&egrave;re-&Eacute;glise left for England carrying letters from the captive king concerning his ransom. Among these letters was the king's command to Queen Eleanor, the justiciars, and the monks of Christ Church to have Hubert Walter elected archbishop of Canterbury. The monks of Christ Church complied, electing Walter on 28 May at Canterbury, one day in advance of the council summoned to London for this purpose. On 29 May the monks went up to London to announce their election to the royal council, where the suffragan bishops of Canterbury, too, voted to elect him. Papal permission to translate him from Salisbury to Canterbury was received, and on 7 November 1193 a papal nuncio invested Hubert Walter with the archiepiscopal pallium at Canterbury. At Christmas 1193 the captive king appointed him his justiciar also.<br>
<br>Hubert Walter had returned to England in April 1193 as King Richard's representative, to restore peace to a country disturbed by the rebellion of Prince John, the king's brother, and to raise money for the king's ransom. His appointment as justiciar regularized his position, but did not substantially alter the sweeping nature of the governmental responsibilities he had already undertaken. His formal appointment as justiciar may, however, have given him the immediate authority he needed to begin military operations against John's castellans. After summoning a council to condemn John and his followers, in February 1194 Walter himself led the successful siege of Marlborough Castle. A few weeks later he personally accepted the peaceful surrender of Lancaster Castle by its constable, his brother Theobald Walter, John's butler since 1185, whom Hubert now reconciled with the king. By 13 March 1194, when King Richard returned to the country, John's rebellion was over. As archbishop of Canterbury, Walter took part in Richard's solemn crown-wearing at Winchester on 17 April. A few weeks later Richard returned to Normandy to take charge of the war with Philip Augustus, king of France. For the next four years both the temporal and the spiritual government of England would rest in the hands of Hubert Walter.<h2>
<a name="Thebeginningsofadministrativereform"></a>The beginnings of administrative reform</h2>A series of remarkable administrative developments followed. The four and a half years of Hubert Walter's justiciarship were characterized by the systematization of existing procedures and the creation of new ones. None of the changes was in itself revolutionary; most built upon developments that went back to the days of Glanville's justiciarship. Nor were they the product of disinterested administrative reflection. Behind the reforms lay the relentless demand for money to support King Richard's war in France. The full measure of Hubert Walter's administrative genius is therefore to be found less in the efficiency of his governance, although that was considerable, than in his ability, as justiciar, to raise the enormous sums needed for war, while retaining, and even enhancing, the confidence of the king's subjects in the fairness of royal justice. It was an achievement his successors as justiciar might envy, but could not repeat.<br>
<br>The first clear sign of the new justiciar's plans came in September 1194, when Hubert sent teams of itinerant justices throughout the country on a general eyre. Within two months, royal justices had visited every shire in England, with the justiciar himself heading up the eastern circuit. The remarkable speed with which this eyre was carried through testifies to the urgency of the situation facing the justiciar. Hubert Walter wanted a quick restoration of royal justice after the disorders that had marked John's rebellion. But as the articles of the eyre made clear, he also wanted a full accounting of the lands and goods forfeited by the rebels, and of the crown's other financial resources in the shires, including the profits of justice. To this end, local knights were now to be elected as coroners in every shire, to record crown pleas and present them to the justices on eyre. Beyond the hearing of crown and civil pleas, the eyre justices in 1194 were also ordered to inquire into the royal demesne manors, recording their fixed rents, present stocking levels, and economic potential if fully and properly stocked. More such inquiries followed in 1195, when a number of demesne manors were removed from the sheriffs and transferred into the hands of specially appointed custodians. In 1194 the eyre justices also inquired into escheats, custodies, and wardships that either were or should have been in the king's hands. All such lands were now to be handed over to local men for exploitation and restocking. In turn, these local escheators were to answer either to Hugh Bardolf (in the north) or William de Ste M&egrave;re-&Eacute;glise (in the south), exchequer officials whom Hubert Walter had appointed earlier in the year to supervise the management of the crown's escheats. Such reliance on local knights as administrators was one of the hallmarks of Angevin government, but it was a particular feature of Hubert Walter's reforms.<h2>
<a name="Jewishdebts"></a>Jewish debts</h2>The eyre of 1194 also initiated a new system for the administration of debts owed by Christians to Jewish moneylenders. After first making a record of all Jewish property the justices were ordered to establish special chests in six or seven different towns. These chests were to be supervised by two Christians, two Jews, two scribes, and a royal official. Henceforward, all lending by Jews was to be done by two-part chirograph. One part of each document was deposited in the chest; the other, sealed by the debtor, was to be given to the Jewish lender. All transactions concerning Jewish debts were to take place only before the supervisory officials, who would keep a written record of payments, debits, or other alterations to the original loan. These local officials were in turn placed under the supervision of William de Ste M&egrave;re-&Eacute;glise and his clerk, William de Chemill&eacute;, who would now exercise a general oversight over all exchequer business involving Jews.<br>
<br>These measures must have provided the king with a better sense than he had had before of the wealth of his Jewish subjects. The main purpose of the new arrangements was not, however, exploitative. In fact, under Hubert Walter the government of England taxed its Jewish subjects very moderately. The new system was principally intended to control fraud in connection with moneylending. Once a debt had been deposited in the chests, the receipt rolls would prevent a dishonest borrower from claiming falsely to have paid it. At the same time debtors who had paid off their debts would have verifiable evidence of the payments they had made, even if their charters of indebtedness were not returned to them. And this, in turn, helped to ensure that paid-up debts would not pass into the king's hands as if they were unpaid, and be summoned again for collection by the exchequer. The new system offered advantages to everyone, and that must be one of the reasons why it endured.<h2>
<a name="Taxationandjustice"></a>Taxation and justice</h2>Further administrative and financial measures were also speedily undertaken. A new forest eyre was launched in 1194. Scutages were imposed in 1194, 1195, and 1196; the tallages begun by the justices on eyre in 1194 were continued and extended in 1195 and 1196; carucages were imposed in 1194 and again in 1198; and a new assize of measures was pronounced in 1196. In 1195 Hubert Walter also issued an important edict on peace-keeping, the first significant such measure since the assize of Clarendon in 1166. Itinerant justices continued to visit individual shires, and Walter himself took an active role in negotiating fines and offerings from individuals seeking the king's favour. The wording of judicial writs continued to evolve, and in 1195 Walter personally introduced a new three-part form of chirograph. He may also have begun the systematic retention of plea rolls from the royal court. The earliest such rolls to survive date from 1195. Walter also began the practice of recording private conveyances and agreements on the royal judicial rolls. Files of these &#145;feet of fines&#146; begin in 1195, and were particularly valued by the small landowners of East Anglia and Lincolnshire, whose interests Hubert Walter understood especially well, having grown up among them. Finally, in 1198 he laid the groundwork for a new kingdom-wide inquiry into serjeanties and another general eyre, both of which would be carried through by his successor as justiciar, Geoffrey fitz Peter.<br>
<br>Perhaps the most lasting administrative development of Walter's justiciarship was, however, the increasing judicial specialization of the king's court. In 1194 jurisdiction over legal cases involving Jews was removed from the justices on eyre and transferred to the exchequer court. By 1196 a clear differentiation of judicial from exchequer business was beginning to develop within the exchequer court itself, a development that would lead by 1198 to the emergence of the common bench as a body of legal experts distinct from the barons of the exchequer. In the autumn of 1198, just a few months after Hubert Walter's resignation as justiciar, there emerged yet another separate body of justices, the exchequer of the Jews, before whom legal cases between Jews and Christians would hereafter be heard and determined. As justiciar, Walter himself linked these increasingly specialized curial groups together. As justiciar, he presided over the exchequer, he served as chief justice in legal proceedings, and he was responsible for crown policy toward the Jews. But beneath him, the king's court was becoming an increasingly professionalized and specialized set of institutions.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsasjusticiar"></a>Last years as justiciar</h2>As justiciar Hubert Walter ruled England as the king's vicegerent. To be effective, he had to have the support both of the king and of the English magnates. Walter's relationship with Richard came briefly under stress in 1196, when Richard dispatched the abbot of Caen to England to audit the justiciar's accounts. The abbot died before his accounting could proceed too far, however, and the matter was not raised again. Whether this incident lay behind Hubert Walter's reported request in 1196 to resign as justiciar can only be a matter of speculation. Richard rejected the request, however, declaring that &#145;there was no one else upon whom he could rely to rule the country&#146;  (Young, 115). Thereafter Richard's support for his justiciar remained steadfast. Between June and October 1197 Walter represented Richard in diplomatic negotiations with the king of France, the count of Flanders, and with the archbishop of Rouen over Richard's decision to build Ch&acirc;teau Gaillard on archiepiscopal property.<br>
<br>By 1198, however, support for the justiciar among the ecclesiastical magnates of England may have been wearing thin. Hubert Walter's reputation among churchmen had already been compromised in 1196, when the church of St Mary-le-Bow in London was set on fire in order to drive from sanctuary William fitz Osbert, who had led a popular rising against the city's oligarchy. In December 1197, when Walter confronted a council of churchmen with King Richard's request that they supply him with an additional force of 300 knights for a year's service in Normandy, the bishops of Lincoln and Salisbury refused to comply, and the council broke up in confusion. The saintly Bishop Hugh of Lincoln, a long-time critic of Hubert Walter, escaped unscathed; but the bishop of Salisbury paid heavily for his temerity, and Hubert Walter seems finally to have succeeded in raising the force the king required. At the same time Walter's reputation as a guardian of ecclesiastical liberties was being further blackened by the furious resistance of the monks of Christ Church to his attempts to revive Archbishop Baldwin's plans to build a collegiate church at Lambeth staffed by canons holding prebends. The accession of a new pope, Innocent III, a man unsympathetic to churchmen holding secular office, may have been the final straw. In July 1198 Hubert Walter resigned as justiciar. This time King Richard accepted the resignation, citing the burden of the work and his justiciar's ill health as grounds for the resignation.<h2>
<a name="ChancellorofEngland"></a>Chancellor of England</h2>Hubert Walter's resignation as justiciar did not, however, mean that he was retiring from governmental affairs. In September 1198 he returned to Normandy at Richard's request to negotiate peace with France. Walter was still on the continent in April 1199, when news of Richard's death reached him in Normandy. He had known Prince John since at least 1182&#150;3, when John was being educated in the household of Ranulf de Glanville. Despite Walter's role in suppressing John's rebellion in 1194, there was probably never any serious prospect that he would support any other claimant to the English throne after Richard's death. Stories that he did so, told independently by the St Albans chronicler and by the biographer of William (I) Marshal, are almost certainly projections of authors writing many years after the event. Contemporary chroniclers, by contrast, report that Walter, together with William Marshal, quickly organized the Norman magnates in support of John. The English magnates were in John's camp already; and on 27 May 1199 Hubert Walter crowned him king of England in Westminster Abbey. On the same day John appointed Walter his chancellor.<br>
<br>Walter brought to the chancery the same systematizing and reforming spirit he had exhibited as justiciar. Immediately upon taking office he instituted a new, fixed schedule of chancery fees. Within two weeks he had begun to insist that outgoing chancery writs and charters be enrolled in chronological order on special rolls. Copies of some royal charters were being kept on rolls before 1199, but as C. R. Cheney has remarked, &#145;there was nothing comparable to the comprehensive and continuous series which began within a few weeks of John's accession&#146;  (Cheney, 108). Nor are there any exact parallels for such chronological enrolments in the known procedures of other contemporary chanceries. Whatever precisely the inspiration, the innovation seems to have been Walter's.<br>
<br>Even as chancellor, Hubert Walter continued to play an active role both at the exchequer and in judicial proceedings. The justiciar, Geoffrey fitz Peter, was an old friend who had also begun his career in Glanville's household, and he frequently sought Walter's advice on difficult cases. The two men co-operated in collecting taxation, particularly the seventh of 1203; and in 1203 they led a joint diplomatic mission to the Welsh marches. Walter also remained active in negotiations with France, first in the spring of 1202, and again in the spring of 1204. As an elder statesman, he also played a crucial role in mediating between the impetuous king and the unfortunate victims of his wrath, as he did, for example, in negotiating a settlement between the king and the Cistercians in 1200. He also acted as a stabilizing influence on policy. In June 1205, only a few weeks before his death, Hubert Walter and William Marshal are reported to have persuaded King John to abandon his plans to lead a new expedition to France.<h2>
<a name="ArchbishopofCanterbury"></a>Archbishop of Canterbury</h2>Remarkable as it was, Hubert Walter's political career is but one aspect of his public life. While serving as justiciar and chancellor he was also archbishop of Canterbury and, from 1195 until 1198, resident papal legate in England. As archbishop, Hubert Walter reorganized the archiepiscopal estates and increased their revenues. He acquired new lands and erected new buildings. Although he was often personally absent from Canterbury, his officials administered the spiritual affairs of the diocese with conscientious efficiency. As metropolitan, Walter was an energetic visitor of monasteries and vacant bishoprics, a task made easier by his simultaneous position as papal legate. At papal request, he also headed commissions of inquiry for the canonizations of Gilbert of Sempringham and Wulfstan of Worcester, and served frequently as a papal judge-delegate. Walter was also an active legislator, issuing canons for the archdiocese of York in 1195, and for Canterbury in 1200. The Canterbury canons were particularly ambitious, and formed the basis upon which Archbishop Langton would erect his own more famous canons of 1213. His quarrel of 1197&#150;1200 with the monks of Christ Church notwithstanding, Walter was also generally regarded as a friend and supporter of monks. He took the habit of the Augustinian canons upon becoming archbishop, and remained on warm terms with the Cistercian order, which accepted him into confraternity in 1195. A generous man, he was particularly noted for his gifts of elaborate vestments to monastic houses, including the Carthusian house at Witham.<h2>
<a name="Deathandsignificance"></a>Death and significance</h2>Hubert Walter died on 13 July 1205 at the manor of Teynham, Kent, of a high fever resulting from an untreated carbuncle on his lower back. He was buried the following day in Canterbury Cathedral, in the south ambulatory of the Trinity chapel. His tomb was opened in 1890, and the vestments and ornaments removed. They are now displayed in the cathedral library. In his will, which he updated annually, the archbishop left the monks of Christ Church a much more splendid set of vestments, but King John took these, and presented them to Peter des Roches for the latter's enthronement as bishop of Winchester in 1206. Hubert Walter's executors, James Savage and Master Elias of Dereham, accounted for debts of &pound;913 1<i>s</i>. on the pipe rolls. The total value of Walter's estate is unknown, but it must have been considerably greater than his debts.<br>
<br>Hubert Walter had at least five brothers. Osbert Walter, a royal justice under King John, died in 1206; Roger, Hamo, and Bartholomew Walter are occasionally mentioned in charters, but are otherwise unknown. Hubert's heir was his brother Theobald, the ancestor of the Butlers of Ormond, who died before Michaelmas 1205, and whose interests Hubert was particularly assiduous in promoting. Concerned though he was to advance his family's interests, Hubert Walter was also undoubtedly a pious man. Piety, however, did not in his eyes require poverty. He was an ambitious man who enjoyed the trappings of power, including wealth. Nevertheless, he was not a hoarder. He was famous for keeping a lavish household, rivalling even the king himself, and his hospitality was unfailing. He was a generous and effective patron to his followers, his family, and his supporters, just as Glanville had been for him. But also like Glanville, he chose men of real ability to staff his household, and many of them went on to make famous careers of their own in the service of church or crown. Walter's reputation as a just and compassionate judge was deserved, but he was at the same time one of the most active purchasers of wardships and custodies in England, both for himself and his relatives. Inevitably there was an occasional clash of interests. When this happened, the conflict usually turned out to Hubert's advantage. Few men can have worn so many hats with such success, both for himself and for those he served, as did Hubert Walter.<br>
