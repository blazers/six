<span class="headword">Petrie,  Martin</span>  (1823&#150;1892), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 1 June 1823 at the Manor House, Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, the second son of Commissary-General William Petrie (1783/4&#150;23 Dec 1842), who had seen active service in Egypt, Italy, and France. His mother, Margaret, was daughter and coheir of Henry Mitton of the Chase, Enfield. Colonel Petrie was sixth in descent from Alexander Petrie DD. His infancy was spent in Portugal and his childhood at the Cape of Good Hope, where his father held appointments. In youth he was chiefly in France, Italy, and Germany. On 14 April 1846 he entered the army as ensign in the Royal Newfoundland corps, and served for several years in North America, becoming lieutenant on 7 January 1848 and captain on 5 May 1854. On 26 January 1855 he was transferred to the 14th foot, and left Newfoundland on 20 March in the small steamer <i>Vesta</i>, which carried twenty-four passengers, seven of them, including Petrie, officers travelling to the Crimea. Some 300 miles off St John's the vessel, already damaged by ice floes, was caught in a terrific storm, and the engine-room was flooded. Petrie's mechanical skill and great courage enabled him to save the ship. He was called the &#145;hero of the <i>Vesta</i>&#146;, but his hands were so lacerated and frostbitten that he was invalided and could not go to the Crimea.<br>
<br>In May 1856 Petrie joined the Staff College at Camberley, and in December 1858 he passed the final examination, first on the list. He was attached to the topographical and statistical department (established 1855) of the War Office from 10 March 1859 to 30 June 1864, and in 1860 he brought out a standard work in three volumes, <span class="italic">The Strength, Composition, and Organisation of the Armies of Europe</span>, showing the annual revenue and military expenditure of each state, with its total forces in peace and war. In 1863 he published a volume of more detailed information on the British army, <span class="italic">The Organisation, Composition, and Strength of the Army of Great Britain</span> (5th edn, 1867). He also compiled two important volumes, <span class="italic">Equipment of Infantry</span> and <span class="italic">Hospital Equipment</span> (1865&#150;6), part of a series on army equipment. For eighteen years (1864&#150;82) he was examiner in military administration at the Staff College, and latterly also at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He became major on 13 July 1867 and exchanged to the 97th foot on 18th December; in July 1872 he retired on half pay, in 1876 became colonel, and in 1882 withdrew from the service. He presented papers at the Royal United Service Institution, of which he was a member; and as an enthusiastic freemason he was master of the St John's, Newfoundland, lodge, and a member of the Quatuor Coronati Lodge in London. He was active in philanthropic and religious work, and was a trustee of the Princess Mary Village Homes.<br>
<br>Petrie married Eleanora Grant (<i>d</i>. 31 Jan 1886), youngest daughter of William Macdowall of Woolmet House, Midlothian, and granddaughter of Sir William Dunbar of Durn, baronet, and they had three daughters. Petrie died on 19 November 1892 at his house, Hanover Lodge, Kensington Park, London, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery, London. His elder daughter, Mary Louisa Georgina (<i>d</i>. 1935), author of <span class="italic">The Best Methods of Promoting Temperance among Educated Women</span> (1901) and of many religious books, married in 1893 Charles Ashley Carus-Wilson (1860&#150;1942), an electrical engineer. The younger daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49153/', "Irene Eleonora Verita Petrie")</script>, joined the Church Missionary Society in Kashmir: after her death her sister published a memoir of her, <span class="italic">The Missions of the Church Missionary Society: the Kashmir Mission</span> (1901).<br>
