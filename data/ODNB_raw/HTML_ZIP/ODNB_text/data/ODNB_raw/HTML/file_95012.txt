<span class="headword">Little,  Clement</span>  (<em>c.</em>1527&#150;1580), <span class="occ">lawyer and benefactor</span>, was the elder son of Clement Little (<i>d</i>. 1551), a prosperous Edinburgh merchant who also owned property in upper Liberton to the south of the town, and his wife, Elizabeth Fisher. The couple ran their shop, filled with cloth, articles of apparel, and similar merchandise, which lay close to the family home on the south side of Edinburgh's high street; their younger son, William (<i>d</i>. 1601), who later became an elder in the kirk, a councillor, and in 1586 and 1591 provost of the burgh, soon entered the family business, whose valued customers in the mid-sixteenth century included the successive rulers of Scotland in the name of the young Mary, queen of Scots, namely John Hamilton, second earl of Arran and duke of Ch&acirc;telherault, and the queen mother, Mary of Guise. The Little daughters married comfortably: Katherine to a local laird, Alexander Napier of Ingliston, and Helen to Hew Brown, a master mason who was also a town councillor. The younger Clement's family was well placed to provide him with a university education. After he had presumably attended the burgh's grammar school he went first to St Andrews, where he attended St Leonard's College in the early 1540s, and then to Louvain in Flanders, where he matriculated in July 1546, five months after George Wishart had been convicted and executed for heresy at St Andrews. If St Leonard's had gained a reputation for protestant sympathies, Louvain remained staunchly orthodox, though favourable towards biblical humanism. No doubt his father's familiarity with the Brabant cloth industry and his links with Flemish weavers in Edinburgh afforded Clement introductions when he arrived in Louvain, in all probability to study law. As well as the university's faculty of law, the city contained the Collegium Trilingue, founded by J&eacute;r&ocirc;me de Busleyden in 1517, which provided aspiring lawyers with free public lectures on jurisprudence.<br>
<br>By 28 April 1550, when he witnessed a legal document, the younger Clement Little had returned to Scotland, preparing to serve his apprenticeship in the ecclesiastical and secular courts. Promotion came rapidly, and by 1557 he was practising as an advocate in Edinburgh, entitled to plead before the court of session, the highest civil court. He acted in a variety of capacities for influential clients among the aristocracy, and associated with such prelates as Robert Reid, abbot of Kinloss and bishop of Orkney, and Henry Sinclair, dean of Glasgow, both of whom were prominent judges on the court of session. Following Sinclair's death in 1565 Little was one of his executors and acquired a number of his books.<br>
<br>The arrival of the Reformation in Scotland raised particular problems for lawyers like Little, taking as it did the form of a rebellion, effected against the wishes of the crown, that swept away the existing ecclesiastical structure, displaced canon law, and overthrew the whole system of church courts. Then an irregular parliament, summoned in the summer of 1560, proceeded to abrogate papal authority in Scotland, prohibit the celebration of the mass, and sanction a protestant confession of faith. Clement Little, who when a student would have been well aware of Wishart's mission to St Andrews in the 1540s, now found Wishart's old bodyguard, John Knox, appointed minister to St Giles's Kirk in Edinburgh. However, the young lawyer readily threw in his lot with the reformers, in the process taking a divergent path from that followed by Henry Sinclair and the more conservative element on the bench. His religious commitment clearly extended beyond the merely conventional. Little seems to have arrived at protestantism though Erasmian humanism and reformist Catholicism, and his devotion to protestant theology and to the reformed kirk is well illustrated by his extensive collection of theological books, over 270 in all, among which the writings of the leading protestant theologians&#151;Luther, Melanchthon, Zwingli, Oecolampadius, Bucer, Viret, Pietro Martire Vermigli (Peter Martyr), Musculus, Calvin, and Beza&#151;are strongly represented.<br>
<br>Little quickly won recognition from both town and kirk for the &#145;luiffing affection and grit zeale borne be him to the kirk of God and to the advancement of his word&#146;  (Marwick, 4.182). As early as 1561 he was serving as an elder on Edinburgh kirk session, in the following year he contributed to that session's appeal for funds for a new hospital (to whose poor he left 300 merks at the end of his life), and he was regularly selected as a commissioner from the burgh to attend meetings of the kirk's general assembly. The latter valued his legal expertise, and in 1567 appointed him one of the kirk's advocates. In the secular courts, too, his career prospered. On 18 February 1564 he was made one of the four members of Edinburgh's commissary court, which succeeded to the jurisdiction in matrimonial and testamentary cases that had been exercised by bishops before the Reformation. For this he received an annual salary of 300 merks. Though he was rarely directly involved in politics, it was a sign of his standing that in 1572 he accompanied Sir William Murray of Tullibardine on a mission to Edinburgh Castle, in an attempt to negotiate peace with the Marians holding out there. In 1577 he was appointed an advocate depute, licensed as such to stand in for the king's advocate in the civil courts.<br>
<br>Ten years earlier, in 1567, Little had also displayed a surprising radicalism, when he approved the enforced abdication of Mary, queen of Scots, in favour of her infant son, who became James VI, and later that year subscribed the general assembly's claim that there existed a mutual contract between God, prince, and people, with the others pledging himself to root out all idolatry and to reform schools, colleges, and universities. Little's concern for education was long-standing. In 1561, at the request of the Edinburgh town council, he had taken part in examining the qualifications of William Robertoun, a committed Catholic, to remain master of the grammar school, a process that resulted in the master's dismissal. And quite apart from his interest in the grammar school, Little was also keen to see a university established in the burgh. Before his death in 1558 Robert Reid had left money to found a college there, and the first <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span> had argued the case for colleges in the main towns in 1560. By 1579 Clement's brother William Little was one of the town councillors who wanted to make Trinity College (where Waverley Station now stands) the site for the burgh's university, and Clement and his brother together discussed its creation with James Lawson, Knox's successor as minister in Edinburgh. The town council also toyed with the idea of a college of theology. Then, amid these discussions, on 1 April 1580 Clement Little died, and was buried in the churchyard of the Edinburgh Greyfriars. He left an estate valued at &pound;3997. In 1563 he had married Elizabeth, the daughter of John Fawside, a prosperous baker, and his wife, Margaret Tod. She survived him, and in 1583 married John Preston of Penicuik, dying later that year after giving birth to a son. There were no children of her marriage to Little.<br>
<br>In his will Clement Little left to the kirk and town of Edinburgh his collection of 268 theological works, valued at 1000 merks (his books on law and other subjects, worth &pound;140 17<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>., were otherwise disposed of). He made his bequest<blockquote>with ane luiffing heart and mynd &hellip; to the effect and purpose that sik personis knowin of honest conversation and guid lyfe (and na utheris) sall haif free access and ingress for reading and collecting the fruitful knowledge of the saidis buikis. (Cuthbertson, 2)</blockquote>Inscriptions record the provenance of many of the books. Apart from thirty-nine volumes from Henry Sinclair's collection, and writings once owned by other contemporary bishops and abbots, there were books from the libraries of the Edinburgh Franciscans and Dominicans, as well as volumes previously owned by two of James V's illegitimate children; one of these, a copy of John Jewel's <span class="italic">Apologia pro Ecclesia Anglicana</span>, had been given to the earl of Moray by the English ambassador to Scotland, Thomas Randolph. Clearly intended to serve the needs of theology students, Little's collection became the nucleus of the university library when the &#145;town's college&#146; finally got under way at Kirk o' Field late in 1583. Each book was stamped on its title page with a circular seal bearing Little's initials and arms, and also with the inscription &#145;I am gevin to Edinburgh &amp; Kirk of God be Maister Clement Litil thair to reman. 1580&#146;&#151;a successful precaution, since all but thirty-four volumes have remained in the university's possession. Nearly all were handsomely rebound in the nineteenth century. The collection is now kept in the main university library building in Edinburgh's George Square.<br>
