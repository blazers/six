<div class="para">
<span class="headword">McClure, Sir  Robert John Le Mesurier</span>  (1807&#150;1873), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, son of Robert McClure (<i>d</i>. 1806), captain in the 89th regiment, and his wife, Jane, daughter of Archdeacon Elgee, rector of Wexford, Ireland, was born at Wexford on 28 January 1807, five months after his father's death. Captain John Le Mesurier of Alderney, Channel Islands, an old comrade of his father, was his godfather and guardian. McClure was educated at Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and entered the navy in 1824. He passed his examination in 1830, and in 1836&#150;7 was mate of the <i>Terror</i> in her Arctic voyage under Captain George Back. On the return of the <i>Terror</i> in September 1837 McClure was promoted lieutenant. In 1838&#150;9 he served on board the <i>Niagara</i> (20 guns), the flagship of Commodore Sandom, on the Great Lakes in Canada during the uprising; and from 1839 to 1842 he was in the <i>Pilot</i> (16 guns) in the West Indies. From 1842 to 1846 he commanded the <i>Romney</i>, receiving ship at Havana. In December 1846 he was appointed to the coastguard, which he left in 1848 to go as first lieutenant of the <i>Investigator</i> with Captain Bird in the Arctic expedition of Sir James Clark Ross. On Ross's return in autumn 1849 it was at once decided to send the same two ships to renew the search for Sir John Franklin by way of the Bering Strait. Captain Richard Collinson was appointed to the <i>Enterprise</i> as senior officer of the expedition, and McClure, who had shown energy and resourcefulness, was promoted on 4 November 1849 to the command of the <i>Investigator</i>.<br>
<br>The ships sailed from Plymouth on 20 January 1850. As they passed into the Pacific on 16 April they were separated in a gale and did not meet again. When McClure arrived off Honolulu on 1 July, he found that the <i>Enterprise</i> had gone on ahead of him, having been fearful of losing the short remains of the summer. The <i>Investigator</i> sailed for the north on 4 July and joined the <i>Plover</i> in Kotzebue Sound, Alaska, on 29 July. The <i>Enterprise</i> had then got into a streak of contrary winds and was a fortnight behind. McClure had faint hope of meeting her at the next rendezvous, off Cape Lisburne; and on departing from Kotzebue Sound he left a letter for the Admiralty explaining the course he proposed to follow in the event of not meeting the <i>Enterprise</i>.<br>
<br>The <i>Investigator</i> fell in with the <i>Herald</i> some 30 miles past Cape Lisburne, but though Captain Kellett did not think that the <i>Enterprise</i> had passed, and suggested that the <i>Investigator</i> had better wait, he would not order her to do so. McClure therefore went on alone, until his progress was stopped by the firm ice of Melville Sound. He was compelled to turn southward, and by 10 October had completed the arrangements for wintering in Prince of Wales Strait. He journeyed along the coast of Banks Island and arrived at its north-eastern extremity on 26 October, where he climbed a hill some 600 feet high and looked across the ice to Melville Island and to &#145;Parry's farthest&#146;&#151;the furthest point reached by Sir William Edward Parry in 1820. No land lay between. The north-west passage was discovered. It was not until several years later that it was known that Franklin and his companions had discovered another passage more than four years before.<br>
<br>In summer 1851 McClure, finding it impossible to advance into Melville Sound, retraced his steps, hoping to be able to cross Banks Strait to &#145;Parry's farthest&#146;. However, the strait was then as impassable as it has always been found, and on 23 September the <i>Investigator</i> was forced into a bay on the northern shore of Banks Island, which, with a sense of immediate relief, McClure named the Bay of Mercy. The ship remained there.<br>
<br>In April 1852 McClure, with a sledge party, succeeded in crossing the strait and actually arriving at Winter Harbour on Melville Island. He found a notice of Lieutenant Francis Leopold McClintock's having been there the previous June, but no stores nor news of probable relief. The summer of 1852 passed and the <i>Investigator</i> was still blocked up in the Bay of Mercy. Provisions were running short, the men were falling ill, and McClure had made his arrangements for abandoning the ship in April 1853, when on the 6th Lieutenant Bedford Pim of the <i>Resolute</i> reached them from Melville Island. McClure's first idea was to get what relief was possible from the <i>Resolute</i>, and remain, in the hopes of getting the <i>Investigator</i> free in the course of the summer. He crossed over to Melville Island to consult with Kellett, but after a medical survey of the <i>Investigator</i>'s crew it was resolved that further stay was inadvisable and that the ship must be abandoned. The men were therefore conveyed across the ice to the <i>Resolute</i>. The season, however, proved very unfavourable. The <i>Resolute</i> was unable to get to the eastward, and the <i>Investigator</i>'s men thus passed a fourth winter in the ice. In April 1854 they were transferred to the <i>North Star</i> and finally arrived in England on 28 September. The news of their safety and of their great discovery had been brought home by Lieutenant Cresswell in the <i>Phoenix</i> (Captain Inglefield) in the previous October.<br>
<br>McClure was, as a matter of form, court-martialled for the loss of his ship, and honourably acquitted. He was knighted on 21 November 1855 and promoted captain (commission dated back to 18 December 1850). In the session of 1855 parliament awarded a grant of &pound;10,000 to the officers and crew of the <i>Investigator</i>.<br>
<br>In 1856 McClure was appointed to the <i>Esk</i> for service on the Pacific station. In the following year he brought her to China to reinforce the squadron there, and in December commanded a battalion of the naval brigade at the capture of Canton (Guangzhou). He was afterwards for some time senior officer in the Strait of Malacca, was made a CB on 20 May 1859, and returned to England in 1861. He had no further service, but was promoted rear-admiral on 20 March 1867, and vice-admiral, on the retired list, on 29 May 1873. In 1869 he married Constance Ada, daughter of Richard H. Tudor of Birkenhead, Cheshire.<br>
<br>McClure, according to the navigator and writer Sherard Osborn, who knew him well, was cool and bold in all perils, a severe disciplinarian, yet modest, and would in war have been a great leader. McClure died at his home, 25 Duke Street, St James's, London, on 17 October 1873 and was buried on the 25th in Kensal Green cemetery. His wife survived him.<br>
