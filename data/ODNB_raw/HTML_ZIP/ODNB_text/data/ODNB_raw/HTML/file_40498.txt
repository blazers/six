<span class="headword">Nooth,  John Mervin</span>  (1737&#150;1828), <span class="occ">physician and army officer</span>, was born on 5 September 1737 at Sturminster Newton, Dorset, the son of Henry Nooth, apothecary, and his wife, Bridget, daughter of John Mervin, apothecary. He studied medicine at Edinburgh, graduating MD in 1766, and subsequently spent some time on the continent. In 1773 he was living in London and acquainted with some members of the Royal Society. Part of a letter he had written to Benjamin Franklin suggesting improvements to an electrical machine was read to the society in June 1773, and in the following March he was elected a fellow, Franklin being one of his sponsors.<br>
<br>The paper for which Nooth is chiefly remembered was read on 15 December 1774: &#145;The description of an apparatus for impregnating water with fixed air&#146;  (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 65, 1775, 59&#150;66). &#145;Fixed air&#146; was the name given to carbon dioxide in 1756 by Joseph Black, and the treatment of diseases, particularly those of a &#145;putrid&#146; nature such as scurvy, by imbibing water impregnated with fixed air, had been advocated by Joseph Priestley. Nooth's apparatus for absorbing fixed air in water consisted of three glass vessels fitted together with airtight joints. Fixed air generated in the lowest vessel passed through a valve into water contained in the middle vessel. Any water displaced upwards by the gas entered the top vessel. The apparatus, which made possible the domestic production of &#145;spa water&#146;, was commercially successful, and large numbers were manufactured. A modified form of Nooth's apparatus was used in December 1846 to administer the ether in the first-known employment of a general anaesthetic in a surgical operation.<br>
<br>Probably shortly before Nooth's departure to New York in 1775, to take up an appointment as physician-extraordinary and purveyor to the forces, North America, he married Sarah Williams, a young widow. They had three children. Their two sons, John Mervin (1778&#150;1821) and Henry (1781&#150;1861), were born in New York and both had military careers. A third child, Mary, was born in Quebec in 1791 and died unmarried in 1846.<br>
<br>In 1779 Nooth became superintendent-general of hospitals for the British forces in North America. He returned to England in 1784, after the War of Independence was over, but was recalled to serve in Quebec in 1788. He took a great interest in the political and economic situation in Lower Canada, and corresponded on the subject, at great length, with Sir Joseph Banks. He left Canada in 1799, subsequently serving in Gibraltar, where his wife died in 1804, from 1804 to 1807. He retired to Bath in 1807 and on 19 August that year married a widow, Elizabeth Willford (1761&#150;1850). He had acquired a high reputation, and in 1800 Edward, duke of Kent (the father of Queen Victoria), whom he had attended in Canada in 1798 after a riding accident, had appointed him physician to his household. Nooth died at his home, 12 Great Pulteney Street, Bath, on 3 May 1828, and was buried at St Nicholas, Bathampton.<br>
