<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Farr,  Thomas George <span class="st"> [Tommy]</span></span>  (1913&#150;1986), <span class="occ">boxer</span>, was born on 12 March 1913 at 3 Railway Terrace, Blaenclydach, Rhondda, the sixth of eight children (four sons and four daughters) of George Farr, miner, and his wife, Sarah Ann Owen. Farr's mother died when he was ten, and his father was soon afterwards struck with paralysis, dying a few years later. Tommy, who grew up in extreme poverty and was always thereafter careful with money, was a schoolboy boxer, then briefly a miner, before he met a disabled miner turned saddler, Job Churchill, who unofficially guided his career throughout the inter-war years.<br>
<br>At the age of fifteen Farr joined the boxing booth of Joe and Daisy Gess at Tylorstown as a handyman. As he grew, he boxed as &#145;Kid&#146; Farr, occasionally facing five opponents in an evening. Beyond the booth, he was paid 3<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. for a contest of six rounds, and when he had saved &pound;109 in his Post Office account, he bought a house at 59 Court Street, Tonypandy, for himself and his younger brother and sister. By 1929 Farr was boxing contests of ten rounds all over the Rhondda valley, and in the next five years he won and lost as a &#145;small hall&#146; boxer whose style (&#145;in-fighting was my speciality&#146;) did not appeal to major promoters. In Jack Petersen, Wales had produced its first ever British heavyweight champion in 1932, and he had the attractive style that Farr lacked. In the economic depression Farr could get few matches, and in 1933 he ignominiously lost his first London contest. At Tonypandy he won the Welsh light-heavyweight title, and in February 1935 at Mountain Ash challenged unsuccessfully for this British title, losing for the third time to the same man. Farr was not beaten again, however, until he met Joe Louis at the Yankee Stadium in New York city in August 1937.<br>
<br>Seeking bigger purses in 1935, Farr signed with an experienced London manager, Ted Broadribb, and moved house to Slough. The boxer&#150;manager relationship was stormy throughout the three years' contract, and Farr relied on the advice of Churchill, returning often to Tonypandy. Broadribb knew everybody, and he got a match with the former world light-heavyweight champion Tommy Loughran of Philadelphia, whom Farr outpointed over ten rounds at the Royal Albert Hall. Farr's earnings in 1936 were modest by boxing standards, less than &pound;150 a fight, though he outpointed another former world title holder, and won the Welsh heavyweight championship by a knockout. His jabbing and spoiling, and clever inside work did not please spectators, and Farr remained in Petersen's shadow.<br>
<br>Farr's glory came in his five contests of 1937. Petersen had lost twice, including, surprisingly, to Ben Foord for his British and empire heavyweight titles. Farr was Foord's first challenger, and gained the points decision in a pedestrian match at the recently opened Harringay arena. The Harringay promoters had brought over Max Baer, a charismatic Nebraskan, who had been world heavyweight champion in 1935, and whom they had to match with a British boxer. Farr was his only feasible opponent, and a month after the Foord fiasco, with the arena packed, he outpointed Baer over twelve rounds. Two months later, with the British boxing market in his pocket, Farr decisively stopped Walter Neusel, the hefty German who had thrice beaten Petersen, and Harringay rang with Welsh song. Aged twenty-four, he signed to meet Max Schmeling at Harringay for a guaranteed &pound;7000, but broke this contract to sail to the USA with Broadribb for a $50,000 match (win, lose, or draw) with the new world heavyweight champion, Joe Louis.<br>
<br>The 23-year-old Louis had been the first black man allowed to box for the world's heavyweight title since 1915, and he was a formidable champion. Possibly only Farr and Churchill fancied the challenger's chances. At 14&frac12; stones, Farr boxed brilliantly, never went down, and was outpointed over fifteen hard rounds. The fight commentary was broadcast by the BBC, the first sporting event to be relayed by transatlantic cable, and wirelesses were switched on in halls and homes in the early hours all over Britain. Farr's gritty loss was sporting memory's gain.<br>
<br>Farr lost as many contests as he won between this and retirement in 1940. He enlisted in the RAF but was soon discharged unfit. He tried to come back to boxing in 1950, but gave up after two years. As a fighter, he was awkward for opponents and difficult for promoters and managers; as a person, 6 feet tall and with a craggy face, he was a raconteur and could sing well enough to make six popular records. His Welshness stuck, and he retained his love of sport. In 1939 he married Muriel Montgomery, daughter of Herbert Nicholas Germon, engineer. They had a daughter and two sons. Farr and his wife lived happily in Sussex until he died in Worthing on 1 March 1986.<br>
