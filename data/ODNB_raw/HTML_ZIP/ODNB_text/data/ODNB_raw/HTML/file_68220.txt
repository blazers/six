<span class="headword">Savile,  Henry, of Banke</span>  (1568&#150;1617), <span class="occ">collector of manuscripts</span>, was born on 20 October 1568 at Blaithroyd (sometimes known as the Banke, or Southowram Bank), Halifax, Yorkshire, the second (but oldest surviving) son of Henry Savile (<i>d</i>. 1607) and Frances Moyser. There are hints that some of his family were Catholics, but Savile himself seems to have conformed to the established church. He matriculated from Merton College, Oxford, in 1588, during the wardenship of his distant cousin and namesake, Sir Henry Savile, the translator of Tacitus and editor of Chrysostom. Savile graduated BA from St Alban Hall on 30 May 1592, proceeded MA on 30 June 1595, and was licensed to practise medicine on 28 November 1601. Thereafter, he travelled to France, Germany, and Italy, returning as an accomplished scholar in painting, heraldry, and antiquities. With the exception of one letter to William Camden, such activity has left little trace.<br>
<br>Savile is best remembered for his collection of manuscripts, which were in part inherited from his father and perhaps from his grandfather; possibly these had been acquired after the dissolution of the Yorkshire monasteries. Another thirty-one manuscripts came from the collection of a fellow Yorkshireman, John Nettleton, who may himself have been holding them in hope of a restoration of Catholicism. In any event, Byland, Fountains, and Rievaulx abbeys were well represented on Savile's shelves. Details of the collection are in two lists  (BL, MSS Harley 1879 and Add. 35213) and a letter of William Crashaw to Isaac Casaubon, though Savile's will suggests that the two lists represent no more than a fraction of it. The library was particularly strong in texts of the chroniclers and in works of theology. While Savile's manuscripts were used for antiquarian purposes by Archbishop James Ussher, Lord William Howard, and others, the most famous instance of such use occurred when William Camden published a passage purportedly from Asser's <span class="italic">Life of Alfred</span> proving the antiquity of Oxford University, and then claimed that it came from a manuscript in Savile's possession. It is unclear whether Camden was referring to our Henry Savile of Banke or to his father, and the manuscript has disappeared. Though Savile tried to sell his collection during his lifetime, in the end the collection was broken up, with volumes coming to Sir Simonds D'Ewes, Ussher, the earl of Arundel, and Sir Robert Cotton.<br>
<br>Savile died in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 29 April 1617, and was buried in the old church. There is no record of him having married or had children.<br>
