<span class="headword">Fuchs,  (Emil Julius) Klaus</span>  (1911&#150;1988), <span class="occ">theoretical physicist</span>, was born on 29 December 1911 in R&uuml;sselsheim, Germany, the third child in the family of two sons and two daughters of Emil Fuchs and his wife, Else Wagner. His father, renowned for his high Christian principles, was a pastor in the Lutheran church who joined the Quakers later in life and eventually became professor of theology at Leipzig University. Fuchs's grandmother, mother, and one sister all took their own lives, while his other sister was diagnosed as schizophrenic.<br>
<br>Fuchs went to school in Eisenach and continued his education in the universities of Leipzig and Kiel. It was at the latter that he became involved in politics and, after some soul-searching, doubtless inspired by his father's idealistic attitude, the Communist Party. After an altercation with the Nazis in 1933 he crossed the border into France and then, with the help of family connections, travelled to Bristol, where he studied under Nevill Mott and obtained a PhD. He took a DSc at Edinburgh University under the guidance of Max Born, one of the pioneers of the new quantum mechanics. After the outbreak of the Second World War he was interned with other German refugees in camps on the Isle of Man and in Canada from June to December 1940.<br>
<br>In 1941 he was recruited by Rudolf Peierls to work on Tube Alloys, the codename for the British project to develop the atomic bomb [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93791', "Tube Alloys directorate")</script>]. The following year, in spite of wartime restrictions, he was granted British nationality as a special case, and signed the <span class="roman">Official Secrets Act</span>. In 1943 he went with Peierls to join the Manhattan project, which was the codename given to the American atomic bomb programme. He was posted to New York and then to Los Alamos in New Mexico, where he remained until after the resulting bombs had destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In 1946 he returned to Britain, where he was appointed by John Cockcroft as head of the theoretical physics division at the newly created Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, then under the Ministry of Supply. He was given the civil service rank of principal scientific officer. He soon became senior principal and in 1949 deputy chief scientific officer. He took personal charge of the mathematical work which underpinned the development of nuclear power.<br>
<br>In January 1950 Fuchs was arrested for transmitting significant information about Anglo-American work on nuclear weapons, including the hydrogen bomb, to secret agents of the Soviet Union. This he had been doing continuously since 1941, after Germany invaded Russia. He had felt so strongly that the details of atomic research should be shared with the Soviet Union that he made contact with a communist colleague he had known in Germany. He had been put in touch with someone working for the Soviet embassy. He was sentenced to fourteen years' imprisonment in February and his British citizenship was revoked in December 1950. Fuchs was released on 23 June 1959 after serving nine years and four months. Immediately after leaving Wakefield prison he joined his father and one of his nephews in what had become the German Democratic Republic (GDR), where he was appointed deputy director of the Institute for Nuclear Research in Rossendorf near Dresden; he retired in 1979. He never returned to the West.<br>
<br>In 1959 Fuchs married a friend from his student days, a fellow communist called Margarete (Greta) Keilson, the widow of Max Keilson, president of the Association of Journalists in the GDR. They had no children. Fuchs achieved great prominence in East Germany and was elected to the Academy of Sciences and the Communist Party central committee. He was decorated with both the order of merit of the Fatherland and the order of Karl Marx. He had probably saved the Soviet Union two years' work on nuclear weapons.<br>
<br>Of slight build, 5 feet 9 inches in height, with fast receding hair, Fuchs was physically attractive with a warm smile, although he often seemed frail. Always tidily dressed and with impeccable manners, he could be kind and sensitive towards his friends. His legendary shyness and aloof manner, however, did not always quite succeed in concealing his innate arrogance and conceit and his belief that he was uniquely valuable. He was possessed of formidable self-control.<br>
<br>Short-sighted and noticeably left-handed, Fuchs was also a heavy smoker, drank quite a lot, and suffered from respiratory problems, as did his older brother, who had tuberculosis for many years. While in the USA and Britain he enjoyed social occasions and prided himself on being a good dancer. He was also keen on family life and frequently dropped in on his married friends. It is believed that he formed a relationship at Harwell with an older woman who was married to a senior colleague of his at Harwell who was also his close friend. He died in Dresden, on 28 January 1988.<br>
