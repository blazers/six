<span class="headword">Young, Sir  George</span>  (1732&#150;1810), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 17 June 1732, eldest son of the Revd George Young of Bere Regis in Dorset (one of a family claiming descent from John Yong of Buckhorn Weston, sheriff of Dorset in 1570), and his wife, Eleanor Knowles. He went to sea in 1746 in the <i>Namur</i> with Edward Boscawen, and saw action off the western coasts of Europe. Towards the end of 1747 Boscawen sailed to India where he participated in the siege of Pondicherry. The <i>Namur</i> sank in April 1749, but before this Young had transferred to the East India Company's marine, in which he became midshipman in 1753. Given that he later named his country seat Formosa Place, it is probable that he was then voyaging to China.<br>
<br>Young re-entered the Royal Navy at the beginning of the Seven Years' War, joining the <i>York</i> under Commander Hugh Pigot in December 1756; he was promoted midshipman in January 1757, participated in the campaigns against Louisbourg and Quebec, and was promoted lieutenant on 3 September 1760. In November 1761 he sailed in the <i>Orford</i> (Captain Marriot Arbuthnot) to the West Indies, where he took part in the campaign against Havana before returning to England in 1763. In the winter Young married Elizabeth Bradshaw (<i>d</i>. 1779); they had four children: Lucia (<i>b</i>. 1764), Samuel (<i>b</i>. 1766), George (<i>b</i>. 1767), and Maria (<i>b</i>. 1768). Between 1767 and 1772 Young commanded the small Africa squadron and made four voyages down the west coast, after the second of which he seems to have been promoted master and commander. On the fourth voyage he stopped at Tenerife, and brought off a mummy which he presented to the earl of Sandwich, who in turn presented it to Cambridge University.<br>
<br>In 1777 Young sailed for India in the <i>Cormorant</i>, one of the squadron under the command of Sir Edward Vernon. He was promoted post captain on arrival, becoming Vernon's flag captain, and participated in the capture of Pondicherry. Vernon then sent him home with dispatches. He arrived in London in March 1779, to find his wife had died in the previous month.<br>
<br>Young got married again before the end of the year, to Anne Battie (<i>b</i>. 1745?), daughter of the wealthy physician William Battie. This connection made him the brother-in-law of the military engineer John Call, who had married Anne's sister Philadelphia in 1772, and gave him the use of the family's London town house in Great Russell Street. He also added to his wife's land holdings at Cookham in Berkshire, where the couple built Formosa Place in the mid-1780s. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society on 15 February 1781. Later that year he was appointed commander of the royal yacht <i>William and Mary</i>; he was knighted on 24 August 1781. Command of another yacht, the <i>Katherine</i>, followed. These appointments brought him into contact with the prince of Wales, a politically dangerous association at a time when the king was much displeased with his eldest son's profligate ways. At one point his colleague Edward Thompson warned Young privately that he was in danger of losing his command. Young was treasurer to the commissioners of Thames navigation from 1786 to 1794. He became rear-admiral by seniority on 4 July 1794, vice-admiral on 14 February 1799, and admiral on 23 April 1804, but saw no further active service.<br>
<br>Young was by report a handsome man, socially graceful, and a keen amateur musician. He assisted Sandwich in introducing concerts to London; and he took pride in offering musical entertainments to guests at Formosa Place, where he built a music chamber. He also took an active interest in some of the important social issues of his time. He was a founding shareholder in the Sierra Leone Company, and a member of its first board; and in 1792 he testified to the House of Commons on the evils of the slave trade.<br>
<br>Young was clearly a person of accomplishment, and a competent naval officer. However, his principal historical significance lies in his support for the colonization of New South Wales. He sent a copy of his scheme (which exists in five versions) to William Pitt the younger. In October 1784 he joined forces with James Mario Matra, who had proposed colonization the previous year, to urge this idea on the administration; and in 1785 John Call added his support. Apart from seeing Botany Bay as a fitting place to which to send convicts and displaced American loyalists, Young thought that a settlement there would offer the East India Company ships a new and safer route to China; and &#145;suppose we were again involved in a war with Spain, here are ports of shelter and refreshment for our ships, should it be necessary to send any to the South Sea&#146;  (TNA: PRO, CO 201/8, fols. 152&#150;3).<br>
<br>Like Matra and Call, Young was even more attracted by the idea of creating in the south-west Pacific Ocean an alternative source of hemp for the British marine, and thus diminishing Britain's dependence on Russia. He had samples of <i>phormium tenax</i> from New Zealand worked into cordage, and canvas &#145;which had been worn and tried in the foot or clew of a cutter's mainsail&#146;  (priv. coll.). In June 1785 he and Call asked the East India Company for permission to colonize Norfolk Island (where the fibre plant grew prolifically, and where there were as well towering pine trees) &#145;for the pursuit of further Discoveries&#151;for the Cultivation of the Flax plant&#151;&amp; Manufacture of that valuable Material into Cordage&#151;and for the supplying Masts from thence for Shipping with which it abounds&#146;  (BL OIOC, E/1/76, fol. 213). The pair repeated this request to the administration in May 1788 when they asked for the grant of the island in perpetuity. However, by this time Arthur Phillip had occupied it; and the dream of its becoming an emporium of naval stores was already fading. None the less Young's thinking encapsulated the Pitt administration's motives for the colonization. He died at Formosa Place on 28 June 1810.<br>
