<span class="headword">Martin,  Percy</span>  (1871&#150;1958), <span class="occ">engineer and motor vehicle manufacturer</span>, was born in Columbus, Ohio, USA, on 19 June 1871. He graduated as a mechanical engineer (in electrical engineering) at Ohio State University, Columbus, in 1892. His involvement in the British motor industry, which occupied the greater part of his working life, began with a chance meeting in London in 1901 while on holiday in England after working as an engineer in Milan and Berlin for General Electric, the dominant American company in the developing worldwide electrical industry. Martin met H. F. L. Orcutt, who had been asked by the chairman of Daimler, the motor manufacturers, to look for a successor to J. S. Critchley as works manager at Coventry. After an interview, Martin was appointed in October 1901, continuing with Daimler and the amalgamated Daimler/BSA group until his retirement in 1934. He became a naturalized British citizen.<br>
<br>Despite the involvement of the financier H. J. Lawson in its origins, Daimler had already gained the cachet of royal patronage, but it needed technical and managerial skill to consolidate its position. As an engineer/businessman, Martin's contribution to Daimler was immediate: within a year of his appointment a more rational model policy had been adopted and he had designed and built new 12 and 22 hp cars. Managerial control over design, operations, and materials was combined with improved incentive payments, notably the contentious premium bonus system. This was seen by Martin as the carrot rather than the stick to move productive effort along lines laid down by management  (Lewchuk, 140&#150;42).<br>
<br>Martin's long-term career with Daimler was associated with two major technical developments, based on acquired technical rights: the Silent Knight engine, marketed in 1909, and the fluid flywheel, based on the F&ouml;ttinger hydraulic coupling, and introduced in 1930. The Silent Knight was a sliding- or sleeve-valve engine, developed by F. W. Lanchester from the designs of Charles Y. Knight of Wisconsin. Daimler acquired exclusive manufacturing rights in the UK, with permission to export. The advantages of smoother and quieter operation than the poppet-valve engine remained until overtaken by engine design and fuel improvements in the early 1930s. Silent Knight was, however, a more expensive engine to build, and opinions differ as to whether Daimler merged with the Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA) in 1910 from a position of strength or weakness. On balance, Martin's appointment as managing director of the reconstituted Daimler concern and as one of three Daimler directors on the BSA board suggest that his skills and value to the new group were fully recognized. The BSA had been founded in 1861 and had added cycle components, cycles, and motorcycles to its range of products, but its diversification into car manufacture, from 1907, had proved disappointing. It is therefore certain that Daimler had something to offer BSA as car (and subsequently commercial vehicle) manufacturers. That the BSA group remained something of an agglomeration, rather than becoming an integrated structure, can hardly be laid at Martin's door.<br>
<br>Martin's experience came into its own during the First World War, when the group's factories were devoted to military production, in particular staff cars, lorries, tank and aero-engines, and aeroplanes. In addition, Martin was made deputy controller of petrol engine supply at the Ministry of Munitions in February 1917 and given a seat on the Air Board. Also in February he was appointed controller of mechanical transport, a position he held until departmental reorganization in November.<br>
<br>In the early post-war period Martin entered into what has been described as a &#145;reckless deal&#146; with George Holt Thomas, the aviation pioneer, to acquire his Airco group, which included the engine manufacturer Peter Hooker. This acquisition, at the outset of a period of recession, involved unwarranted expenditure and expansion. From 1926 to 1929 Daimler and the commercial vehicle manufacturers AEC were involved in a joint venture, the Associated Daimler Company, but it did not live up to Martin's hopes, AEC proving the dominant partner. Meanwhile, in 1927, Martin had approached Louis Coatalen to propose a merger between Sunbeam and Daimler, but this came to nothing. However, the acquisition by the BSA group of the ailing Lanchester Motor Company at the end of 1930 was rightly seen as industrial rationalization and may be regarded as the culmination of Martin's links with the remarkable Lanchester brothers.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his career Martin was closely involved in the development and introduction of the Daimler fluid flywheel, having acquired manufacturing rights in the F&ouml;ttinger hydraulic coupling in 1929. The introduction of the epicyclic (Wilson) gearbox in conjunction with the fluid flywheel is credited to Martin, who apparently was particularly proud of his part in the development of this technical improvement. He was chairman of Daimler from January 1934 to October 1935, having retained his seat on the board after retirement. Changes at Daimler, probably overdue, followed Martin's retirement; these included the establishment of a separate bus division, Transport Vehicles (Daimler) Ltd, in 1936 and extensive development of the works, to speed production, in 1937&#150;8.<br>
<br>Martin married, in July 1902, a fellow American, Alice Helen Heublein (<i>d</i>. July 1958) of Hartford, Connecticut, whom he had met in Berlin while she was on holiday. They had a son, John, and a daughter, Helen. Like a number of other midland industrialists, Martin settled in Kenilworth, where he bought Spring Farm, later extended by the purchase of the adjoining Camp Farm. He died, following a heart attack, at The Spring, Kenilworth, on 10 November 1958. His son subsequently pursued a business career in the USA and his daughter, who did not marry, managed The Spring estate after her father's death and became a great benefactor of the nearby University of Warwick.<br>
