<span class="headword">Stoddart,  Thomas Tod</span>  (1810&#150;1880), <span class="occ">angler</span>, was born on 14 February 1810 in Argyle Square, Edinburgh. He was the eldest son of the seven children of Captain Pringle Stoddart RN (1768&#150;1848), a descendant of the Stouthearts of Liddesdale and Ettrick, and his wife, Frances, daughter of James Sprot. At the age of ten he was sent to a Moravian school in Lancashire, but soon returned to attend the high school and the university of his native city. In 1833 he was admitted a member of the faculty of advocates, but he never practised.<br>
<br>From an early age Stoddart developed a passion for angling, which afterwards became the chief business of his life. He was an expert angler, particularly at fly-fishing, with a great knowledge of the haunts and habits of fish, besides being adept at fly making. He wrote articles on angling for <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal</span>, which were published in book form in 1835 as <span class="italic">The Art of Angling, as Practised in Scotland</span>&#151;the first treatise of its kind in Scotland. In 1836 he married Bessie Macgregor, daughter of a farmer at Contin in Ross-shire, whom he met while on a fishing tour. They had two sons and a daughter, Anna Macgregor Stoddart, who became the biographer of her father. Stoddart settled in Kelso, where he found the surroundings so congenial for fishing in the conjoined trout and salmon rivers Tweed and Teviot that it became his home for life. In 1847 he published <span class="italic">The Angler's Companion to the Rivers and Lakes of Scotland</span>, which became an angling classic in Scotland. His later life was devoted to fishing in his home streams, and in the Yarrow and other western rivers. He was concerned to stop the pollution of rivers, and several times gave evidence before the Tweed commissioners and parliamentary committees on this subject.<br>
<br>Stoddart died at his home, Bellevue, Kelso, on 21 November 1880, and was buried in Kelso cemetery. He is remembered chiefly as the Izaak Walton of Scottish anglers and the author of classic angling songs.<br>
