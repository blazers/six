</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ward,  Joshua</span>  (1684/5&#150;1761), <span class="occ">medical practitioner and inventor of medicines</span>, was the son of William Ward, owner of an alum works, of Guisborough, Cleveland. He had at least two brothers, one being the wealthy and dishonest businessman and MP John Ward of Hackney (<i>d</i>. 1755), and two sisters. According to John Ayrton Paris he was originally a footman who, while serving on the continent, obtained the recipes of his nostrums from some monks. The only certainty however, is that he worked with his brother William as a drysalter in Thames Street, London, where he presumably gained some useful experience in the properties of drugs.<br>
<br>Ward is claimed to have fled to France in 1715 on account of a &#145;particular affair&#146;, apparently involving sympathy with the Jacobite cause  (<span class="italic">Annual Register</span>, 1761, 185). Yet in the same year he became a member of parliament for Marlborough, after one of two rival mayors got hold of the election writ and inserted Ward's name. Ward was returned even though no one had voted for him. Nominally a whig he voted against the <span class="roman">Septennial Act</span> of 1716, but in May 1717 he was unseated on petition.<br>
<br>Ward remained in France for about sixteen years, spending time near Paris and among the English colony at Dunkirk. In 1725 he was co-defendant with his brother John in an action brought in England by the widow of John Sheffield, first duke of Buckingham and Normanby, over some alum works the duke had earlier leased to them. It emerged that John Ward had cheated the duke out of &pound;70,000, only &pound;10,000 being recovered, and he was convicted of fraud and forgery; being abroad, Joshua Ward escaped blame.<br>
<br>While in France, Ward invented the medicines known as Ward's Pill and Ward's Drop. The composition of these and other nostrums, such as sweating drops and paste for fistula, varied greatly over the years, but essentially the pills contained antimony and a vegetable substance&#151;dragon's blood&#151;mixed with wine, whereas the drops comprised a fearsome brew of nitric acid, ammonium chloride, and mercury. Those taking such remedies, in an age when cupping and blistering were regular treatments, thought that the resulting heavy perspiration, vomiting, or purging had beneficial effects. After receiving a pardon from George II, Ward returned to England in 1734, settled in London, and overnight became the talk of the town.<br>
<br>Ward's reputation was greatly enhanced by royal patronage. He spotted that the king's painful thumb was not gouty but dislocated, and cured it with a violent wrench. For this he was rewarded with the use of an apartment in the almonry office, Whitehall, and the privilege of driving through St James's Park. Ward was also adept at puffing himself, asserting in press advertisements his ability to cure gout, rheumatism, scurvy, palsy, syphilis, scrofula, and cancer. He converted three houses near St James's Park into a hospital for the poor, and set up a further treatment centre in Threadneedle Street, in the City of London. He subsidized these activities by charging the rich what they could afford.<br>
<br>Not unexpectedly, Ward's spectacular success evoked harsh criticism, not merely from reputable doctors. He was widely accused of hiring &#145;patients&#146; at half a crown a week and instructing them on how to simulate the symptoms of diseases; better-dressed impostors were said to arrive in their coaches and throng his consulting-rooms for 5<i>s</i>. a day. The large sums he contributed to charity&#151;put at over &pound;3000 a year&#151;and the coins he regularly threw from his carriage only fanned hostility towards him. The <span class="italic">Grub Street Journal</span>, in articles from 1734 onwards, repeated verbatim in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, at first reasonably attacked the public's indiscriminate use of the medicines, but later castigated him openly as the friend of undertakers, coffin makers, and sextons by poisoning the sick. Ward responded by taking the journal to court on charges of libel&#151;inadvisedly, as it turned out, as his scant medical knowledge was revealed and his case was thrown out, the defendants gleefully commemorating their victory in prose and doggerel.<br>
<br>Among men of letters, reactions to Ward and his activities were decidedly mixed. Henry Fielding commended his powers of curing the poor with no expectation of reward, in his <span class="italic">Voyage to Lisbon</span> (1755), and Horace Walpole approved of the way in which Ward relieved headaches with a dab of ointment on the forehead. Edward Gibbon as a sickly twelve-year-old was successfully treated by Ward during a life-threatening illness. On the other hand Alexander Pope satirized Ward as a despicable quack at least four times in his verses. In William Hogarth's &#145;The Company of Undertakers&#146;, Ward is depicted with the surgeon and oculist John Taylor (1703&#150;1772) and the notorious bone-setter Mrs Mapp as an impudent fraud.<br>
<br>Notwithstanding these mixed reactions, Ward seems to have maintained the confidence of the &eacute;lite. George II cautiously permitted his daughter Princess Caroline&#151;egged on by John Hervey, Baron Hervey of Ickworth (1696&#150;1743)&#151;to take Ward's pills for her rheumatism. In 1748, when the House of Commons debated a bill to control apothecaries and others who were dispensing adulterated drugs, Ward petitioned the house, alleging that over the past fifteen years he had had no fewer than 2000 patients under his care, 300 being soldiers; he was duly exempted in the bill, which was rejected in the House of Lords.<br>
<br>Ward's notoriety for his pills and his treatment of the sick overshadowed his scientific experiments. He had two trained assistants, John White and F. J. D'Osterman, with whose help in 1736 he began to make sulphuric acid at Twickenham, in what were known as the &#145;Great Vitriol Works&#146;. This acid was produced by igniting nitre (or saltpetre) and sulphur in round-bottomed flasks set in sand. While the chemistry of the process was by then tolerably well known, for the first time manufacture was on a large enough scale to permit continuous production, one operative being able successively to attend the large number of flasks in the works. The price of sulphuric acid was consequently reduced to about one-sixteenth of its former cost. Later Ward removed operations to Richmond, and he patented his process in 1749. In both localities the fumes from the chimneys and the general stench aroused much irritation among the neighbours.<br>
<br>Ward was a large and ungainly man, his double chin and rotund figure indicating his taste for the good things of life. His nickname of Spot Ward arose from the claret-coloured birthmark on the right side of his face, shown in some (but not all) portraits of him. He showed no undue respect to those above him, even making impertinent remarks to the king, but was kindly and condescending to those he deemed his inferiors.<br>
<br>There is no evidence that Ward ever married. The &#145;affair&#146; which drove him abroad was undoubtedly political rather than of the heart. Perhaps he had too many secrets to risk marriage. The last word on a contemporary must go to Dr Johnson: he judged Ward to have been the dullest man he had ever known.<br>
<br>Ward died at his home in Whitehall, London, on 21 December 1761, his fortune being estimated at &pound;16,000, with &pound;5000 earmarked in bequests, mainly to relatives. He asked for his body to be buried in Westminster Abbey, if possible close to the high altar; he did after all reside within the parish. He was duly interred on 26 December with great pomp in Poets' Corner, not inappropriately for one so versified against. A bust in his possession was to have been placed next to that of John Dryden; however, the only lapidary likeness available was a full-length statue by Agostino Carlini, which was too ostentatious for the abbey. Presented to the Royal Society of Arts by a great-nephew in 1792, it is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Ward's grave remains unmarked and his nostrums were likewise soon virtually forgotten. His friend John Page, an MP and one-time deputy paymaster-general, inherited the recipes, and published them in 1763. White and D'Osterman continued production helped by pensions from George III, and the proceeds were to be divided between the Asylum for Female Orphans and the Magdalen Home for Fallen Women. These revenues, at first plentiful, soon declined sharply. Unlike the fever powders of Robert James, the pill and drop did not long survive their self-important creator.<br>
