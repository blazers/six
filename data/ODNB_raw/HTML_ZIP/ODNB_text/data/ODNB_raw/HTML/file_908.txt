<span class="headword">Austin,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>William Birchley]</span>  (1613&#150;1669), <span class="occ">religious writer</span>, was born at Walpole, Norfolk, third son of John Austin (<i>d</i>. before 1631) of Walpole and Mary Williams of Aswarby, Lincolnshire. During 1629&#150;31 John Austin attended the grammar school of Sleaford, Lincolnshire, and on 31 March 1631 he was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge. Austin never received a degree, undoubtedly because he converted to Catholicism, but information about the year of conversion is contradictory. Wood states that Austin left Cambridge and his religion about 1640 when he entered Lincoln's Inn; Wood also states that Austin was a contemporary at St John's of John Sergeant (1622&#150;1707), who remained a lifelong friend. However, in fact, John Austin was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 6 August 1632, whereas Sergeant became a student at St John's College in 1639. If Wood is right in linking Austin's conversion to his departure from Cambridge, this might imply that Austin's conversion took place in 1632 and that his acquaintance with John Sergeant was due to their mutual association with St John's rather than their being contemporaries in the strict sense of the word.<br>
<br>Subsequently Austin was a tutor to the Catholic Fowler family at St Thomas's Priory, Stafford, probably during the early years of the civil war. Sergeant states that Austin travelled extensively on the continent and this might fit in with the fact that a Mr Austin visited the Ancient English Hospice at Rome in the years 1640&#150;46. By about 1650 Austin had settled in London as can be deduced from a postscript to his <span class="italic">The Christian Moderator</span> (2nd edn, 1651), in which he relates that he was suddenly called into the country upon a sad occasion, apologizes for the resultant unfinished state of the book to which the postscript is attached, and expresses his reluctance to leave London. Since after this date Austin lived as a gentleman of independent means, one might guess that the sad occasion was the death of a relative who left him some money. Austin returned to London and became part of a circle of Catholic literary men such as Thomas Blount, Thomas White, Christopher Davenport, John Sergeant, John Belson, and Thomas Keightley. Apart from friendship the group also shared a common conception of the political future of the English Roman Catholic minority. Within the group there were different political emphases and clear temperamental differences, but what united the members was a general willingness to negotiate with the Cromwellian government, offering allegiance in exchange for toleration.<br>
<br>John Austin's importance as a writer is threefold: he played a major part in the contemporary controversies about toleration for Roman Catholics; he produced one of the most influential seventeenth-century books of private devotion; and he wrote a number of hymns that found their way into prayer books of many different denominations. One of the most striking characteristics of Austin's main controversial works is the writer's eirenic tone: he wants to convince by appealing to reason. That is why one might perhaps have doubts about Austin's authorship of the very first publication attributed to him by Gillow, a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">A zealous sermon preached at Amsterdam, by a Jew, whose name is NOT-RUB, it being a Hebrew word, you must read his name backward</span> (Amsterdam [that is, London] 1642). It is a rather crude attack on Henry Burton, the puritan divine whose anti-episcopal campaign led to imprisonment and to the cutting off of his ears in 1636.<br>
<br>Attacks of this nature are absent in Austin's <span class="italic">Christian Moderator</span> series, which he published under the pseudonym William Birchley. The first of three independently published parts came out in 1651. In this pamphlet Austin poses as a member of the Anglican church who is reviewing the contemporary politico-religious situation in order to establish whether Independents ought to be allowed freedom of worship. A great number of arguments is brought to bear on the question, ranging from the demands of Christian charity, through the unlawfulness to force someone to go against his own conscience, to seemingly illogical elements in the Anglican position: &#145;Since we have so happily shaken off that intollerable yoak of Popish infallibility &hellip; it is become to us, not only tyrannical, but absurd, to compel others to a way, that we ourselves confess may possibly be erronious&#146;  (p. 1). As if it were by accident the author discovers that his arguments in favour of toleration for Independents hold equally true in the case of Roman Catholics. Within two years of publication there were at least three new editions of the original <span class="italic">Moderator</span>, apart from both a second and a third part. In spite of Austin's reasonable tone the book elicited angry Anglican reactions such as <span class="italic">The Beacon Flameing</span> (1652) and <span class="italic">Legenda lignea</span> (1653). In 1652 a &#145;fourth edition&#146; was published containing all three parts and, interestingly enough, the sheets of this edition were bound up again in 1659, on the eve of the Restoration, and published under the title <span class="italic">The Catholiques Plea, or, An Explanation of the Roman Catholick Belief</span>. In 1718 Austin's text was reprinted in <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Bishop of Bangor's Intended Collection of Authorities</span> and thus played a part in the Bangorian controversy of that year.<br>
<br>Even more influential was Austin's <span class="italic">Devotions in the Ancient Way of Offices</span> (1668; subsequent editions in 1672, 1684, 1685, and 1789). <span class="italic">Devotions</span> is a prayer book for laymen that takes over the structure and some of the material of the most popular Roman Catholic book of private devotion, <span class="italic">The Primer, or, Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary</span>. The book is a good example of the extensive influence that English Roman Catholic devotional books had beyond the small circle of contemporary Catholic users. As early as 1686 <span class="italic">Devotions</span> was adapted for Anglican use by Theophilus Dorrington. These <span class="italic">Reform'd Devotions</span> went through at least eight more editions. In 1700 again a different Anglican adaptation of Austin's text was made, this time by a pious lady, Susanna Hopton, and edited by the nonjuror George Hickes. Hickes's first edition was followed by a series of editions running into the nineteenth century. Nathaniel Spinckes's <span class="italic">The True Church of England-Man's Companion in the Closet</span> (1721, with at least nineteen subsequent editions) is to a great extent based on Austin's book, and extracts of <span class="italic">Devotions</span> further found their way into <span class="italic">A selection of hymns and meditations &hellip; from the reformed devotions of Austin; entirely cleared of those expressions which savoured of popery</span> (1791).<br>
<br>Perhaps the most remarkable feature within <span class="italic">Devotions</span> was the forty hymns that Austin wrote. Up to Austin's time English books of private devotion frequently contained translations or poetical paraphrases of Latin hymns, but Austin was the first actually to compose a body of original hymn texts. Their stylistic elegance and emphasis on devotional rather than controversial elements, combined with the fact that their metrical regularity allowed them to be set to tunes, ensured them an independent popularity, so that various hymns found their way into such miscellaneous collections as Samuel Speed's <span class="italic">Prison Pietie</span> (1677) and John Wesley's <span class="italic">Collection of Psalms and Hymns</span> (1737).<br>
<br>John Austin died in his lodgings in Bow Street, Covent Garden, and was buried in the parish church of St Paul on 31 March 1669. His friend John Sergeant incorporated a biographical account of Austin in the second edition of <span class="italic">Devotions</span> (1672), which includes a number of basic facts of Austin's life and a moving account of his death.<br>
