<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  William  Vesey-</span>, second Baron Fitzgerald and Vesey, and Baron Fitzgerald  (1783?&#150;1843), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the elder son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9566/', "Rt Hon. James Fitzgerald (1742&#150;1835)")</script> and his wife, Catherine Vesey (1759&#150;1832), who was in 1826 created Baroness Fitzgerald and Vesey in the peerage of Ireland. He spent five years at Christ Church, Oxford, where he made a reputation as a young man of ability, and he succeeded his father as MP for Ennis in 1808. He was involved in the famous scandal resulting from the connection of the duke of York with Mary Ann Clarke, but rendered services to the government and the court in bringing facts to light, and secured his appointment as a lord of the Irish treasury in 1809 and a privy councillor in Ireland in February 1810. His motives at this time were impugned by Mrs Clarke in a <span class="italic">Letter</span> which she published in 1813, but though there probably was a grain of truth in her assertions, there was not enough to damage Fitzgerald's reputation, and she was condemned to nine months' imprisonment for libel.<br>
<br>Fitzgerald's rapid political rise was due in large part to the patronage of John Foster, with whose family he became connected. In 1812 he was sworn of the English privy council, and appointed a lord of the Treasury in England, chancellor of the Irish exchequer, and first lord of the Irish treasury. In January 1813 he again succeeded his father as MP for Ennis, having been defeated for County Clare in 1812. He worked closely with chief secretary Robert Peel, despite having overlapping responsibilities. He followed Foster's policy of promoting the amalgamation of the Irish and British exchequers, but was frequently in dispute with other ministers on questions of patronage. In March 1816 he moved a bill for uniting the treasuries, thus making himself redundant.<br>
<br>In 1815 Fitzgerald assumed his mother's name of Vesey in addition to his own, on succeeding to some of the Vesey estates. In 1818 he was elected MP for County Clare. In 1820 he was appointed minister-plenipotentiary to Sweden, where he spent three years in fruitless attempts to persuade King Karl XIV (Bernadotte) to repay the large sums of money advanced to him during the war with Napoleon. In 1823 he was recalled in something like disgrace. Lord Liverpool, however, knew his value as a speaker and man of business, and in 1826 made him paymaster-general to the forces.<br>
<br>After the resignation of Huskisson and others from Wellington's administration in June 1828, Peel persuaded the duke to appoint Vesey-Fitzgerald to the cabinet as president of the Board of Trade. This made it necessary for him to seek re-election for County Clare. His long-standing support for Catholic emancipation had up until then made his position secure, but the Catholic Association was now committed to opposing all supporters of the Wellington government. He was opposed by Daniel O'Connell, and was decisively beaten at the poll; the defeat led directly to the concession of Catholic emancipation in April 1829. A seat was, however, found for Vesey-Fitzgerald at Newport in Cornwall in 1829, and in August 1830 he was elected for Lostwithiel. In February 1830 he resigned office and in December he gave up his seat in parliament, but next year he was again elected for County Clare, and held that seat until his accession to his mother's Irish peerage in January 1832.<br>
<br>When Sir Robert Peel took office in 1834&#150;5, he did not forget the services of Vesey-Fitzgerald, who was created a UK peer, Lord Fitzgerald of Desmond and Clangibbon in co. Cork, on 10 January 1835. In 1835&#150;41 he was an active opposition spokesman on Irish issues in the Lords. He did not form part of Sir Robert Peel's original cabinet in 1841, but he became president of the Board of Control on 28 October 1841, and held that office until his death in Belgrave Square, London, on 11 May 1843. His funeral at Kensal Green cemetery was attended by Peel and other cabinet ministers.<br>
<br>At the time of his death Vesey-Fitzgerald was a trustee of the British Museum, president of the Institute of Irish Architects, and a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He was unmarried, but left most of his personal property to his two illegitimate children, one of whom was the politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9589/', "Sir William Robert Seymour Vesey Fitzgerald")</script>. At his death his United Kingdom peerage became extinct, but he was succeeded in his Irish peerage by his brother Henry, dean of Kilmore, at whose death in 1860 that title also became extinct.<br>
