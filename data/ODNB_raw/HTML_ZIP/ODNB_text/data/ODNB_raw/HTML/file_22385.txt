</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Plot,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1640, <em>d.</em> 1696), <span class="occ">naturalist and antiquary</span>, was baptized on 13 December 1640 at Sutton Barne in the parish of Borden, near Sittingbourne, Kent, the son of Robert Plot (<i>d</i>. 1669), who was descended from an old-established Kentish family, and his wife, Rebecca, daughter of Thomas Patenden or Pedenden, also of Borden, and widow of Edward Knight of Woodnesbury. He was educated at the free school in Wye, and on 24 March 1658 entered Magdalen Hall, Oxford, whence he matriculated in the university on 2 July; he graduated BA in 1661, and proceeded MA in 1664. Thereafter he taught at Magdalen Hall (the name of one of his pupils, Matthew Bryan, is known for 1665), at the same time preparing for the degrees of BCL and DCL. Although Plot served as dean and vice-principal of Magdalen Hall, in 1676 he moved to University College to which in 1683 he gave a statue of King Alfred, legendary founder of the college. It was during these years of teaching and study that Plot must have laid the foundation of the formidable erudition that earned him the sobriquet &#145;learned Dr Plot&#146;, learning which is evidenced on every page of his writings. He did not, however, neglect practical studies. In 1667, in company with John Ward and John Mayow, he followed a course of chemistry given by William Wilden and at some stage he learned basic land-surveying techniques sufficiently to be able to draw his own maps.<br>
<br>Endowed with practical ability and a sense of objects and machines which is displayed in the clarity of the descriptions that he gives of them, Plot was fascinated both by the new sciences, which in the company of Ward and Mayow he encountered in the activities of the group of natural philosophers in Oxford that congregated first around Robert Boyle and later around Thomas Willis, and by antiquities. During the mid-1660s he conceived a plan to travel throughout Britain collecting materials towards the writing of a descriptive survey of the country. If the intellectual stimulus behind this project may have been the tradition of geographical study at Magdalen Hall, the antiquarian interests of Plot's tutor there, Josiah Pullen, and the Baconianism of the natural philosophers in the circle of Boyle, Plot's literary stimulus was Pliny's <span class="italic">Historia naturalis</span>, Leland, Camden, and the English chorographical tradition stemming from William Lambarde.<br>
<br>In 1671 Plot wrote some commendatory verses for Thomas Southouse's <span class="italic">Monasticon Favershamiense</span> and in the same year proceeded BCL and DCL. Freed from the commitment to study, he could concentrate on his antiquarian researches and in 1672 or 1673 prepared printed and manuscript synopses of his plan to elicit patronage. Successful in this, partly through the help of such men as John Fell, bishop of Oxford, and Ralph Bathhurst, vice-chancellor of the university, with both of whom he had earlier become acquainted in Boyle's circle, Plot was able to begin travelling through Oxfordshire&#151;to which county he had now decided to limit his researches&#151;in June 1674. Two years later <span class="italic">The Natural History of Oxfordshire, being an Essay toward the Natural History of England</span> was published by the university press.<br>
<br>Plot's first book was well received and successful. Four issues of the first edition are known and it was posthumously reprinted in a revised and enlarged second edition adorned with a life of Plot by his stepson John Burman in 1705. Of more immediate consequence to Plot, however, was the fact that the favourable reception accorded the book in university circles led first to the suggestion that a special lecturership in &#145;philosophical natural history&#146; should be created for him, and ultimately to his being appointed simultaneously professor of chemistry and curator of the objects in the natural and antiquarian sciences centre that the university created around Elias Ashmole's gift of his collections in 1679. For this centre an extensive building was purposely erected and there Plot lived, taught, and collected, from the time that it opened in 1683 until 1690. A second consequence of his publication seems to have been his election to the Royal Society of London on 6 December 1677; he was its second secretary from 30 November 1682 until 29 November 1684 and during the same period he edited numbers 144&#150;78 of the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>, thus reviving this journal from four years of desuetude.<br>
<br>Part of the material of which Plot was able to dispose to fill the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> derived from meetings of the Philosophical Society which had been established in Oxford immediately upon the opening of the Ashmolean Museum and of which Plot, its leading spirit, was director of experiments. It was to this body that Plot first communicated the studies on the origin of springs and rivers that he published as <span class="italic">De origine fontium</span> in a Latin translation by Christopher Wase (1684), in advance of including their English original in his <span class="italic">Natural History of Staffordshire</span> (1686). During this period, when he was visiting Staffordshire gathering material for the volume similar to that on Oxfordshire that he had planned from perhaps as early as 1675, he also communicated a series of papers to the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> arising from his local natural history researches. One of these, on the best season of the year for felling timber, provoked official enquiry and experiment as being of importance to the navy.<br>
<br>Plot throughout his career was a tory and an establishment man. <span class="italic">The Natural History of Oxfordshire</span> was dedicated to Charles II, that of Staffordshire to James II. Plot's particular patron seems to have been Henry Howard, seventh duke of Norfolk, whom he presented &#145;with a flattering speech&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Times of Anthony Wood</span>, 3.108) for an honorary DCL in 1684 and to whom he dedicated the first volume of the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> that he edited. In 1687 Norfolk appointed Plot registrar to the court of chivalry a few days before the archbishop of Canterbury made him a notary public. The same year he was disappointed in an attempt to become warden of All Souls, and although in 1688 he succeeded John Dryden as historiographer royal he was deprived of the place under the new regime in favour of Thomas Shadwell. Plot was clearly ambitious, and a willingness even to embrace Catholicism in order to obtain advancement was imputed to him. Disappointments at Oxford (probably in 1681 he had also been spoken of for principal of Magdalen Hall) may have influenced him in deciding to marry and leave the university. On 12 November 1689 he resigned from his chair of chemistry and in the winter of 1690&#150;91 from the keepership of the Ashmolean. On 21 August 1690 he married Rebecca (1662&#150;1713), second daughter of Ralph Sherwood, a freeman in the London Grocers' Company, and widow of Henry Burman of Newington, Kent. With her he acquired a stepson, John Burman (<i>d</i>. 13 April 1726), who would edit the second edition of <span class="italic">Oxfordshire</span> (1705); she and Plot had two sons, Robert Sherwood and Ralph Sherwood.<br>
<br>Plot now moved to London and Sutton Barne, Borden, to which house he added a large parlour and chamber at the north end, enclosed the front court, and laid out a new kitchen garden. Here he continued his old interests but inclined increasingly to antiquarian studies, probably seeing more prospect of obtaining patronage and advancement through them than through natural philosophy. A major project was for a history and defence of the earl marshal's office, for which he assembled numerous papers which, like all his manuscripts, were inherited by his stepson. The combination that he had formulated, however, was still potent, and in the early 1690s Plot projected both a &#145;Natural history of Middlesex and Kent&#146; and one of London and Middlesex, despite the fact that he had clearly stated at the end of <span class="italic">Staffordshire</span> that he would &#145;never publish any more of these <i>Histories</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Staffordshire</span>, 450). Proposals for both projects were published and the collecting tours which Plot undertook enabled him to supply materials to Edmund Gibson for his revision of Camden's <span class="italic">Britannia</span>. By August 1694 Plot had received sufficiently substantial subscriptions for the London and Middlesex volume for him to publish a set of &#145;Enquiries to be propounded &hellip; in order to their history of nature, arts and antiquities&#146;. As earlier when he was embarking on the Oxfordshire survey, Plot's contacts brought him support. In January 1695 the office of Mowbray herald-extraordinary was created for him and two days later he was appointed registrar of the College of Heralds. During this last period Plot was ambivalent in his attitude towards continuing work on county natural histories, perhaps because the effort of travelling and collecting wearied him into recurrent ill health. His later letters are punctuated by illness and on the 30 April 1696, after great suffering, he succumbed to the stone. He was buried in Borden church.<br>
<br>Ambitious and old-fashioned, a practitioner of a pharmaceutical alchemy directed towards finding a universal solvent that Plot thought was the essential ingredient in the efficacious remedies of Paracelsus and J. B. van Helmont, perhaps time-serving but none the less fundamentally committed to utilitarian natural philosophical and antiquarian research, Plot reveals the quintessential nature of the late seventeenth-century scholar, neither humanist nor modern. For Plot philosophizing fundamentally meant providing rational accounts of things which were described in detail. This rational empiricism meant that he had no strong allegiances to a particular intellectual system, although he was convinced of the need to make experiments if he was to give a true description of things. Acquisitive, but none the less convivial, bibulous, a good companion, and jovial, Plot was in contact with most of the learned men of his day, and his worldliness was probably a major element in his ability to obtain the collaboration and patronage of county society in his efforts to record their surroundings. His success is to be measured less in his own career than in the influence that his two county histories had on succeeding writers. By eschewing universalism, except in the range of literary reference that he brought to bear on his subjects which were treated in a relentlessly rational manner, Plot created a form of history writing which, by delimiting its subject either to a defined geographical region or to a particular topic, enabled practitioners of the genre to tackle manageable subjects. At the same time, by combining civil and ecclesiastical history with natural history, he introduced an element of novelty and enabled himself to describe a region as a unified whole in which nature and human activity were but two parts of a single environment. Authors of local histories, whether civil, natural, or both, were to acknowledge Plot's influence throughout the eighteenth century. If the model is no longer followed, the quality of his descriptions none the less continues to give value to his works.<br>
