<span class="headword">Bellerby <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Parker]</span>,  (Mary Eirene) Frances</span>  (1899&#150;1975), <span class="occ">poet and novelist</span>, was born on 29 August 1899 at St Aidan's House, Summerhill Road, St George, Bristol, the younger of the two children of Frederick Talbot Parker (<i>d</i>. 1954), Anglo-Catholic clergyman, and his wife, Marion Eirene, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thomas (1868/9&#150;1932), nurse, daughter of a Bristol solicitor and his wife. Her father was English and her mother Welsh. She was brought up in Bristol where she attended Mortimer House School, Clifton, from 1908 to 1919. She was a popular pupil, outstanding academically, and a superb athlete. In August 1915 her brother Jack was killed in action and his loss affected her all her life.<br>
<br>On leaving school Frances had a series of voluntary and paid jobs: veterinary assistant (she was always passionate about animals), teacher, journalist, research assistant, and parish duties. She also joined the Neighbours, a fellowship for social services founded by the economist John Rotherford Bellerby (1896&#150;1977) and described by her in a tract and a novel, <span class="italic">The Neighbours</span> (1931) and <span class="italic">Shadowy Bricks</span> (1932). As the sole remaining child she found her parents oppressive and was stifled by her father's religious discipline although she shared his capacity for zealous idealism in whatever she undertook.<br>
<br>Frances began keeping a commonplace book of readings and observations in 1925. Her first published works were a volume of essays, <span class="italic">Perhaps?</span> (1927), and a novella, <span class="italic">The Unspoiled</span> (1928). By this time she was living in London where she worked as drama critic for the <span class="italic">Bristol Times and Mirror</span>. She married John Bellerby on 9 December 1929. A person who delighted in physical activities, she found it particularly hard to deal with the disabilities with which she was afflicted in adult life. In 1930 she fell and began to suffer recurrently from a spinal injury. When her mother committed suicide in 1932 Bellerby became estranged from her father, haunted by the breakup of her family. Her marriage faltered from the mid-1930s, ending in divorce about 1948, and she moved to a cottage in Cornwall in 1940.<br>
<br>Primarily remembered for her poetry (she wrote poems from the age of three), Bellerby published five collections in her lifetime: <span class="italic">Plash Mill</span> (1946) (named after her home in Cornwall), <span class="italic">The Brightening Cloud and other Poems</span> (1949), <span class="italic">The Stone Angel and the Stone Man</span> (1958), <span class="italic">The Stuttering Water and other Poems</span> (1970), and <span class="italic">The First-Known and other Poems</span> (1975). Two volumes of her selected poems were introduced in 1970 and 1986 by Charles Causley and Robert Gittings respectively. Bellerby's poetry has an intense, visionary quality and deals with nature, memory, and loss. This is also true of her prose. Her best-known novel, <span class="italic">Hath the Rain a Father?</span> (1946), addresses the social and psychological consequences of bereavement after the First World War, and this is the focus of a number of stories in her three collections: <span class="italic">Come to an End and other Stories</span> (1939), <span class="italic">The Acorn and the Cup with other Stories</span> (1948), and <span class="italic">A Breathless Child and other Stories</span> (1952). Her <span class="italic">Selected Stories</span> (1986) was introduced by Jeremy Hooker.<br>
<br>In 1950 Bellerby was diagnosed as having breast cancer and treated with operations and excruciating X-ray therapy. While her work was published in many magazines and anthologies, and she received a pension from the civil list for her services to literature in 1973, Bellerby, who was an intensely private person, became increasingly reclusive. In 1951 she moved to Devon and finally settled in Goveton, near Kingsbridge, living at Upsteps Cottage. After her father's death in 1954 she began her autobiography but abandoned it because of the pain it caused her. In 1957 she contracted arterial claudication, a circulatory disorder which made it difficult for her to walk. The cancer recurred in 1973 and she died of breast cancer and ankylosing spondylitis on 30 July 1975.<br>
<br>A Quaker since 1934, Bellerby instructed in her will that her body be donated to research and that her ashes be scattered near her place of death without flowers or any kind of ceremony. In her obituary Charles Causley wrote: &#145;The death &hellip; of Frances Bellerby &hellip; has robbed contemporary poetry of a unique and distinguished voice. To read her, is to be in the presence of a true original&#146;  (Causley).<br>
