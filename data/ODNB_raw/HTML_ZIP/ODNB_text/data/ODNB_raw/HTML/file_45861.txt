<span class="headword">Scott <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Taylor]</span>,  Mary</span>  (1751/2&#150;1793), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in Milborne Port, Somerset, the daughter of a linen merchant. Little is known of her before the publication, in her early twenties, of her poem <span class="italic">The Female Advocate</span> (1774). It seems that her life had been dominated by illness: in the poem's dedication she writes of her &#145;years of ill health&#146;, and in the poem itself of her &#145;languor, and unceasing pains&#146;. <span class="italic">The Female Advocate</span> also contains clues to particular friendships. The &#145;Lady&#146; to whom it is dedicated was evidently Anne Steele, who is also addressed as Theodosia, author of <span class="italic">Poems on Subjects Chiefly Devotional</span> (1760). Like Scott, Steele was both earnestly religious and an invalid. It is probably Scott whom Steele addresses as Myra in a poem first published in the posthumous second edition of her <span class="italic">Poems</span>, that speaks of a friend to whom she is &#145;In suffering and in sentiment allied&#146;. Steele was the eldest daughter of a lay Baptist preacher and timber merchant, William Steele, who appears in <span class="italic">The Female Advocate</span> as Philander, a man who has encouraged her writing. Scott praises in the poem another male mentor and friend to &#145;the female cause&#146;; according to a manuscript note by Sarah Froud, who in 1774 owned the copy now in the Huntington Library, this was Richard Pulteney. Pulteney (1730&#150;1801) was a physician who, from 1765, lived in Blandford, Dorset, and wrote books on botany.<br>
<br>The title page of <span class="italic">The Female Advocate</span> declared it to be occasioned by reading John Duncombe's <span class="italic">The Feminiad</span> (1754), a celebration of female learning and, in particular, of women poets. In rhyming couplets Scott supplemented Duncombe's verse catalogue, commending literary women omitted by him, and adding several more recent writers. Those with strong protestant inclinations were singled out for praise. She wrote that the poem, which appeared in a second edition in 1775, sprang from her &#145;indignation&#146; at the disdain of many men for &#145;female education&#146;.<br>
<br>Although Scott appears to have remained in Milborne Port, living with her parents, until she was in her late thirties, she clearly had contacts with a circle of intellectual protestant dissenters. <span class="italic">The Female Advocate</span> was published by Joseph Johnson, who would become well known as a publisher of writing by dissenters. Her brother, Russell Scott, was a Unitarian minister in Portsmouth and, in the early 1770s, she met John Taylor (1753&#150;1817), first a student then a tutor at the Daventry Academy for Unitarians. Marriage to Taylor was opposed by her mother, an invalid for whom Scott cared until her death in 1787. Her father died the next year and shortly afterwards, in May 1788, she and Taylor, who had become minister of a chapel at Ilminster, Somerset, married.<br>
<br>In the 1770s Scott established an epistolary friendship with Anna Seward, whose published letters, seven of them written to Scott, are the main source of information about her. Seward's father, Thomas, had been praised in <span class="italic">The Female Advocate</span> for his poem &#145;The female right to literature&#146;, and this may have led to the correspondence between the two women. They wrote to each other mainly about literary topics and, according to a letter from Seward to William Hayley, met only once. Scott published &#145;Verses Addressed to Miss Seward, on the Publication of her Monody on Major Andr&eacute;&#146; in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> in June 1783. Roger Lonsdale speculates about her being the Miss Scott whose two poems &#145;Dunotter Castle&#146; and &#145;Verses, on a Day of Prayer, for Success in War&#146;, were included in <span class="italic">Poems by the most Eminent Ladies</span>, probably published in 1780. In the year of her marriage she published <span class="italic">The Messiah</span>, a blank verse epic with Christ as its hero (reviewed in the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, 79, 1788, 277). This was her last known publication.<br>
<br>Scott gave birth to a daughter in 1789 and a son in 1791. The latter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27062/', "John Edward Taylor (1791&#150;1844)")</script>, would become founder and editor of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. Her husband became a Quaker by 1792, an alteration which, from the evidence of Anna Seward's correspondence, placed some strain upon her as he had earlier influenced her to adopt Unitarian beliefs. She continued to suffer from poor health and, three weeks before her third child was due to be born (according to a brief obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>), she died on 5 June 1793, aged forty-one, in Bristol. She was survived by her husband.<br>
