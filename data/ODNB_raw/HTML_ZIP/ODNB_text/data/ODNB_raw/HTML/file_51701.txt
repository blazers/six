<span class="headword">Seligman,  Gerald Abraham</span>  (1886&#150;1973), <span class="occ">glaciologist</span>, was born on 26 March 1886 at Clapham Park, London, the seventh and youngest child of Isaac Seligman (1834&#150;1928), merchant banker, and his wife, Lina Messel (1851&#150;1925), of Darmstadt, Germany. Both his parents were of German-Jewish origin. From 1900 to 1903, he was educated at Harrow School, whence he entered the South-eastern Agricultural College. In 1905 he went up to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, graduating in 1908 with second-class honours in natural sciences, with strength in chemistry and geology.<br>
<br>On holidays in the Alps and in Norway, Seligman had shown ability as a skier and, in 1907, he became an early member of the Ski Club of Great Britain. His skiing enthusiasm was to set the course of his later career but on first leaving Cambridge, he joined his brother Richard's new company, Aluminium Plant and Vessel (APV), manufacturing specialized process plant and containers. On 5 June 1915 he married Ursula Goode (1891&#150;1982). The couple later had one daughter.<br>
<br>A scientist by inclination, Seligman was not satisfied with the life of a businessman. Although he remained a director of APV until 1959, in 1931 he ceased working full-time, thenceforth devoting himself to the study of snow and ice. He had valuable contacts in this field for, since 1921, he had edited and contributed extensively to <span class="italic">Ski Notes and Queries</span>, the journal of the Ski Club of Great Britain. He remained editor until 1935 and was president of the club from 1927 to 1929.<br>
<br>Seligman's early research centred on the structure of snow, with an examination of falling snow and avalanches. Following research in Cambridge, he published his classic work <span class="italic">Snow Structure and Ski Fields</span> (1936; repr., 1962). He moved on to consider the metamorphosis of snow into glacier ice and for this purpose organized expeditions to the Jungfraujoch, Switzerland, in 1937 and 1938. His personality and standing drew leading chemists and physicists into his parties. As a result of the work, many seminal papers in glaciology were published, presaging a new style in such research.<br>
<br>In 1936, Seligman was invited to form a British group reporting to the International Commission of Snow and Ice (ICSI). He responded by forming the Association for the Study of Snow and Ice. After war service with the Meteorological Office, he transformed his association into the British Glaciological Society, at the same time launching the <span class="italic">Journal of Glaciology</span>. He served as president of the society (later the International Glaciological Society) until 1963, and was co-editor of the journal until 1968. He was president of the ICSI from 1951 to 1954.<br>
<br>Following the dissolution of his first marriage in 1951, Seligman married (Pamela) Loris Arnould (<i>b</i>. 1917) on 21 August 1952, and they settled at Biddenden, Kent, where many glaciologists enjoyed the warm hospitality of their Tudor house. From here Seligman edited his journal, with an acute eye for style, content, and accuracy, assisted by equally rigorous academic colleagues. In 1968, his health forced a move to Folkestone, where he died, at his home, 46 New Metropole, from bronchopneumonia on 21 February 1973. He was cremated at Charing.<br>
<br>Seligman's work had been recognized by the award in 1933 of the Pery medal from the Ski Club of Great Britain for distinguished services to skiing, of the Back grant in 1940 and the Victoria medal in 1959 from the Royal Geographical Society for glaciological research, of an honorary doctorate in 1965 from the University of Innsbruck, and by the first award of the Seligman crystal in 1965 from his society. More importantly, he left an active and flourishing society with over a thousand members in thirty-three countries.<br>
