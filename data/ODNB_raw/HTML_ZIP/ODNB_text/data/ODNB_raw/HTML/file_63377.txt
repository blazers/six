<span class="headword">Kings of the South Saxons</span>  (<em>act. </em>477&#150;772), <span class="occ">rulers in the area of modern Sussex, with portions of Kent and Hampshire</span>, are for the most part obscure, their names supplied by the occasional charter and their dates a matter for abstruse calculation. The traditional founder of the kingdom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/198/', "&#198;lle")</script>, said to have arrived on the South Saxon coast in 477 with his three sons, Cymen, Wlencing, and Cissa. The last that is heard of &AElig;lle is his storming of the Roman fort of Anderida, near Pevensey, supposedly in 491; his partner in the assault was his son Cissa. From the omission of any reference to the other two sons, it might be deduced that Cissa succeeded his father; but there is no firm evidence of this, and indeed nothing to show that &AElig;lle founded a dynasty.<br>
<br>The next South Saxon ruler of whom anything is known is King <a name="cosubject_63373"></a><span class="headword">&AElig;thelwealh</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>685)<span class="occ"></span>, who was the first to accept Christianity. He was baptized in Mercia, at the suggestion of his overlord, King Wulfhere (<i>r</i>. 658&#150;75), who acted as his sponsor and subsequently presented him with the Isle of Wight and the land around the Meon valley as a token of their new relationship in God. &AElig;thelwealh may have been more ready to accept Christianity because he had a Christian wife, Eafe, who was originally from the kingdom of the Hwicce (roughly the present counties of Gloucestershire and Worcestershire); this marriage was probably also engineered by Wulfhere, to strengthen his overlordship over the South Saxon kingdom. In the early 680s &AElig;thelwealh received Bishop Wilfrid of Northumbria, then in exile from his native land, and encouraged him to organize the mass conversion of the South Saxons and to set up a permanent church in the kingdom; he granted Wilfrid a large estate in the Selsey area, where the bishop founded a monastery which he used as his base for the short period he remained in the kingdom. &AElig;thelwealh's reign ended about 685, when Sussex was invaded by a young West Saxon prince named C&aelig;dwalla, himself an exile. &AElig;thelwealh was killed in the course of this incursion, but C&aelig;dwalla was driven out by two of the king's noblemen, Berhthun and Andhun. Shortly afterwards, in 686, C&aelig;dwalla managed to establish himself as ruler of the West Saxons, and with his additional resources he once more invaded Sussex, killing Berhthun. Sussex now became for some years subject to a period of harsh West Saxon domination.<br>
<br>By 692 the people were under the rule of a certain Nothhelm, usually known as <a name="cosubject_20405"></a><span class="headword">Nunna</span>  (<em>fl. </em>692&#150;714?)<span class="occ"></span>, who acknowledged the overlordship of the new West Saxon king, Ine. According to one version of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, Nunna was a kinsman of King Ine, and collaborated with him in an assault on Cornwall in 710. Two of Nunna's earlier charters are also attested by a King <a name="cosubject_63376"></a><span class="headword">Watt</span>  (<em>fl. </em>692)<span class="occ"></span>, while a later one has the subscription of a King <a name="cosubject_63377"></a><span class="headword">&AElig;thelstan</span>  (<em>fl. </em>714?)<span class="occ"></span> (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 45, 1173, 42). It would appear that Sussex was now being ruled by West Saxon nominees; they may have been joint kings (with Nunna as the probable senior ruler), or there may have been some kind of territorial division. If the latter, then Nunna, who could dispose of land around Selsey and Chichester, is likely to have ruled the western part of the kingdom; Watt, followed by &AElig;thelstan, may have been in charge of the eastern part (from which no charters survive). There is evidence from later in the century that the area around Hastings, occupied by the people known as the H&aelig;stingas, existed as a territory distinct from the rest of the South Saxon kingdom; it may have been settled by colonists from Kent. The suggestion that Watt was the ruler of the H&aelig;stingas is attractive, but unsupported by any evidence. Nunna's last appearance is in a charter dated 714 (possibly for 717 or 721), but he may have gone on ruling for some time after this.<br>
<br>The next South Saxon king to emerge in the sources is <a name="cosubject_63378"></a><span class="headword">&AElig;thelberht</span>  (<em>fl. </em>733&#150;747?)<span class="occ"></span>, donor of two charters (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 46 and 47, the latter being a fabrication); all that can be said for certain about him is that he was a contemporary of Sigefrith, bishop of Selsey, who was consecrated in 733 and who died at some point between 747 and 765. By the latter date Sussex had a new bishop, and at least three or even four new kings had come to power. Determining the sequence and relationship of these rulers proves very difficult. One was <a name="cosubject_20900"></a><span class="headword">Osmund</span>  (<em>fl. </em>765&#150;770<span class="mult">x</span>72)<span class="occ"></span>, who made grants of land at Ferring in 765, at Henfield in 770, and at Peppering near Amberley probably between 770 and 772 (S 48, 49, 44); all these places are within 20 miles of each other, and provide some indication of the areas which Osmund controlled. None of Osmund's charters is attested by another king. By contrast, a charter (S 50) in the name of a King <a name="cosubject_63379"></a><span class="headword">Ealdwulf</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>760)<span class="occ"></span>, which seems to belong to the 760s, is attested by a King <a name="cosubject_63380"></a><span class="headword">&AElig;lfwald <span class="st"> [&AElig;lhuald]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>760)<span class="occ"></span> and a King <a name="cosubject_63381"></a><span class="headword">Oslac <span class="st"> [Osiai]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>760)<span class="occ"></span>.<br>
<br>The independent existence of the South Saxon kingdom came to an end in the early 770s. In 771 Offa, king of the Mercians, conquered the territory of the H&aelig;stingas; he may have entered Sussex from Kent, where he was already dominant. By 772 he apparently controlled the whole kingdom. In that year he issued a diploma granting land at Bexhill to the bishop of the South Saxons (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 108), which was witnessed by four men described as <i>dux</i>: Oswald, Osmund, &AElig;lfwald, and Oslac. There is reason to suspect that at least three of these men were former kings of Sussex. Osmund was probably the ruler who issued diplomas in the 760s and early 770s, while &AElig;lfwald and Oslac seem likely to have been the &AElig;lhuald and Osiai who attested King Ealdwulf's charter in the 760s. Nothing is known of Oswald, although judging from the position of his subscription in the witness list to Offa's diploma he would appear to have been the most senior of the four. It would seem that after his conquest of Sussex Offa had come to an agreement with its former rulers, who continued to rule as Offa's representatives, with the reduced status of <i>dux</i>. In subsequent years Oslac and &AElig;lfwald both made grants of land as <i>dux</i> of the South Saxons, but in each case the grants were made with Offa's permission or were later confirmed by him (S 1178, 1183, 1184). Sussex remained a Mercian possession until <i>c</i>.825, when it was absorbed into the West Saxon kingdom.<br>
