<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Banana,  Canaan Sodindo</span>  (1936&#150;2003), <span class="occ">president of Zimbabwe</span>, was born in Esiphezini, near Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia, on 5 March 1936. His mother, Jese, was Ndebele, but his father, Aaron Banana, was a migrant worker from Nyasaland. He studied to become a teacher at the Tegwani Training Institute, and a Methodist minister at Epworth Theological College. He was ordained in the United Methodist church in 1962 (the year after his marriage, to Janet Mbuyazwe) and began teaching in church schools. He was able to study briefly at Kansai Industrial Centre in Japan, and began distance studies with the University of South Africa. He eventually won a scholarship to Washington and in 1975 graduated as a master of theology from Wesley Theological Seminary. Before that, however, he had already entered nationalist politics and in 1972 had become vice-president of the Rhodesian African National Council, which campaigned against the compromise British proposals to award independence to Rhodesia without full majority rule. He journeyed to London with his protests but, on his return to Rhodesia, was obliged to flee to Botswana in 1973. It was from there that he went to the USA for further studies. After his return from Washington in 1975 he was subjected to surveillance, arrest, and periodic imprisonment. These intensified after he attended the 1976 Geneva talks which, unsuccessfully, sought to resolve the Rhodesian crisis. A member at that time of Bishop Abel Muzorewa's delegation, he defected to Robert Mugabe's more radical Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), and it was this that marked him out as dangerous to the white minority government of Ian Smith. Meanwhile, he had also embarked on a career of writing. His <span class="italic">Gospel According to the Ghetto</span> (1974) inaugurated his reputation as a liberation theologian, which he was able to cement with later works after majority rule and independence were finally achieved in 1980. At one point he suggested that the <span class="roman">Bible</span> needed to be rewritten in order to make it relevant to post-colonial societies.<br>
<br>Because of his membership of ZANU, his Ndebele background in an otherwise Shona-dominated ruling party, his religious respectability combined with his liberationist politics, and his credentials of having been imprisoned, Banana was Prime Minister Robert Mugabe's choice as Zimbabwe's first president. It was a largely titular and ceremonial role, lasting from 1980 to 1987, when the presidency became an executive position assumed by Mugabe himself. Banana greatly enjoyed the role. His tailored Mao suits, love of football, and forays into playing the guitar contrived to depict him as a stylish man of the people. His writing and his religious background lent him a scholarly and clerical dignity. However, he did accomplish something of genuine importance during his tenure, which was to broker talks between Mugabe and the Ndebele leader, Joshua Nkomo, at a time when Mugabe had unleashed the <i>gukurahundi</i> (&#145;whirlwind&#146;) of repression against Ndebele dissidents&#151;and a very great number of innocent Ndebele people. The <i>gukurahundi</i> lasted from 1982 to 1987, and Banana's intervention in 1985 took two years to bear fruit. The result, while ending the pogroms against the Ndebele, also constrained Nkomo as a political force for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>In 1997, ten years after relinquishing the presidency (he retired with a large cash lump sum, a tax-free pension for life, and various other benefits), Banana was accused by Jefta Dube, one of his own presidential staff, of homosexual rape. (Dube was standing trial for murder, but claimed in his defence that the murdered man had been taunting him as &#145;Banana's wife&#146;.) Although Banana's proclivities had been widely known for some time, it was impossible to stop the public scandal from spreading rapidly, once Dube's accusations were made in the high court. Many others came forward to say that they too had been subjected to sexual advances or sodomy by Banana. Mugabe had made an infamous speech against homosexuality in 1995, describing homosexuals as &#145;worse than pigs and dogs&#146;, so the political establishment was in no mood to prevent eleven charges of sexual misconduct being brought to court in 1999. The witnesses' testimonies were damning and Banana fled briefly to South Africa. It was Nelson Mandela who persuaded him to return, and probably also persuaded the Zimbabwean establishment to treat him with dignity. A one-year gaol term (ten years with nine suspended) was served, in relaxed surroundings, for six months. Banana lost his university chair of theology, was defrocked by his church, and was jeered out of his presidency of the Zimbabwe Football Association. In his last years he doggedly defended himself against the accusations of homosexuality, declaring it to be an abomination. His wife, Janet, who had stood by him during his trial, fled to Britain in 2000 to claim political asylum. Banana was, however, not harassed again. In his last brief years after Janet's departure he fell into a lingering illness. He died of cancer of the prostate at Charing Cross Hospital, Fulham, London, on 10 November 2003. Janet and their children, one daughter and three sons (two of whom were charged with armed crimes, and one convicted), survived him.<br>
<br>Banana was a man of contradictions. His five books on politics and theology formed a real contribution to an African sense of liberation theology, or what he called &#145;combat theology&#146;. Before his fall from grace his public image was one of humane conscientiousness, thoughtfulness, and stylishness. His sexuality, however, was what broke him on Robert Mugabe's wheel of intolerance&#151;although even Mugabe, after Banana's death, called him &#145;a gift to the nation&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>).<br>
