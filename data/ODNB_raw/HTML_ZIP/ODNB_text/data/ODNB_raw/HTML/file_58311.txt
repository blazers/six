<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Skelton,  Barbara Olive</span>  (1916&#150;1996), <span class="occ">writer and literary femme fatale</span>, was born on 26 June 1916 at The Croft, Ellington Road, Taplow, Buckinghamshire. Her father, Eric George Skelton, a descendant of the playwright Sheridan, was a major in the West India regiment, but was invalided out of the army at an early age; her mother, Eveline Ada Williams, of partly Danish origin, was a former Gaiety girl. A temperamental child, &#145;bun-faced, with slanting sludge-coloured eyes&#146;  (Skelton, <span class="italic">Tears before Bedtime</span>, 4), Barbara lost her virginity to a margarine millionaire while still in her teens.<br>
<br>Barbara worked as a model, but after the Second World War began she became a denizen of bohemian London, dividing her amorous favours between Peter Quennell and Feliks Topolski, who came to blows over her one night in the Gargoyle Club. Barbara and Quennell shared an attic in Bedford Square, rented from Cyril Connolly, but in 1942 she went to Egypt, at Donald Maclean's suggestion, to work as a Foreign Office &#145;cipherine&#146; in Cairo. There she added King Farouk to her list of lovers. Barbara always disdained conventional good looks, once citing Erich von Stroheim as her <i>beau id&eacute;al</i>: she retained a soft spot for the king, despite his lashing her with his dressing-gown cord.<br>
<br>Back in London, she was re-introduced to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30959/', "Cyril Connolly (1903&#150;1974)")</script>, writer and editor; he fell in love with her, and they were married on 5 October 1950. Marooned in Barbara's tiny cottage, high up in the Kentish Downs, with only a ferocious South American coatimundi, some guinea fowl, and a goose to keep them company, the Connollys fought&#151;as he put it&#151;like a couple of kangaroos. Paralysed by writer's block and the melancholy of middle age, Connolly&#151;known to his spouse as Pungle or Pop&#151;lay in bed for hours on end, sucking the sheets and muttering &#145;Poor Cyril&#146; like a mantra.<br>
<br>On one of the Connollys' trips to London, Barbara began a passionate affair with her husband's new publisher, (Arthur) George Weidenfeld (<i>b</i>. 1919); to complicate matters further, Weidenfeld published her first novel, <span class="italic">A Young Girl's Touch</span> (1955), which was dedicated to Connolly and was, like all her fiction, thinly disguised autobiography. Connolly was devastated by her intense if transient physical infatuation with Weidenfeld; the affair became the talk of literary London, and after a series of near-farcical comings and goings they reluctantly divorced in the spring of 1956, with Weidenfeld cited as co-respondent.<br>
<br>Shortly afterwards, on 26 August 1956, Barbara Skelton married Weidenfeld; the newly-weds spent their honeymoon in Italy, on Ischia, where Connolly happened to be staying with W. H. Auden. Life as a publisher's wife proved entirely uncongenial, and passion turned to positive dislike: she had affairs with Alan Ross and the painter Michael Wishart&#151;for whom she was &#145;as feline in appearance as she later proved to be in character&#146;  (Wishart, 149)&#151;but when, in due course, Weidenfeld divorced her, Connolly was cited as co-respondent.<br>
<br>Connolly remained the one great love of Barbara Skelton's life, and after her divorce in 1959 she moved to New York, where she worked in a bookshop and as a dentist's receptionist, and added the critic Kenneth Tynan, the editor Bob Silvers, and the cartoonist Charles Addams to the cast of admirers. In 1966 she was briefly married to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31279/', "Derek Ainslie Jackson (1906&#150;1982)")</script>, a war hero living in Paris who combined the Oxford professorship of spectroscopy with success as an amateur jockey; his fortune was founded on the <span class="italic">News of the World</span> and from then on Barbara was never short of a penny, even though they were divorced after a year. She settled in the south of France, where she enjoyed a tumultuous relationship with the French writer Bernard Frank; while staying with her there in the summer of 1974, Connolly suffered a heart attack, and died in London two months later.<br>
<br>Barbara published a collection of stories, <span class="italic">Born Losers</span> (1965), and a second novel, <span class="italic">A Love Match</span> (1969), which had to be withdrawn after John Sutro threatened a libel action. But she is best remembered for her two volumes of autobiography, <span class="italic">Tears before Bedtime</span> (1987) and <span class="italic">Weep No More</span> (1989), which combine waspishness and wit in equal measure. She had a keen eye for the absurd, and a ruthless ability to skewer friends and foes alike with an exact and colourful turn of phrase, comparing Farouk in exile to &#145;a huge sawdust teddy bear badly sewn at the joints&#146;, and noting Connolly's &#145;Chinese coolie's legs protruding from below his knee-length shorts&#146;  (Skelton, <span class="italic">Tears before Bedtime</span>, 91, 110).<br>
<br>To the end of her life Barbara Skelton retained her pantherine good looks, and her hour-glass figure remained as supple as that of a thirty-year-old; she had fair hair, and her high cheek-bones and glittering eyes reminded Quennell of &#145;the youthful concubine of a legendary Mongol chieftain&#146;  (Quennell, 21). Quick-witted, funny, and well-read, she could be alarmingly sullen, moody, and farouche: the important thing was to make her laugh, after which one's sins of neglect were briefly forgiven.<br>
<br>Much to her regret, Barbara was unable to have children. Lonely, restless, and easily bored, she returned to England with her cats in 1993. Towards the end of 1995 she was diagnosed as having a brain tumour. She spent her last weeks with Connolly's daughter Cressida and her family in Worcestershire, and died there, at Wick Manor, Wick, near Pershore, on 27 January 1996. She was buried at Wick.<br>
