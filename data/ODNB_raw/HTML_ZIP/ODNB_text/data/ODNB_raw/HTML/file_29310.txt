<span class="headword">Whitford,  Walter</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1617, <em>d.</em> in or after 1691), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29309/', "Walter Whitford (d. 1647)")</script>, bishop of Brechin, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. in or after 1660), daughter of Sir John Carmichael. Described by one contemporary as &#145;tall, corpulent, full-faced, with long brownish black hair&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pepys MSS</span>, 266), Whitford fought as a colonel on the side of the king in the civil war. He was briefly held prisoner after the battle of Naseby in 1645, and on the overthrow of Charles I took refuge in Holland. In 1649 Isaac Dorislaus, who had taken an active part in the trial of the king, was appointed English envoy in Holland and reached The Hague on 29 April. Among the royalist exiles and followers of Montrose a scheme was laid to murder the new envoy, with the knowledge of the Portuguese ambassador and the blessing of his English confessor. On the evening of 12 May, as Dorislaus was sitting down to supper at the Witte Zwaan, six men burst into his rooms, and while some of them secured his servants, Whitford, after slashing him over the head, passed a sword through his body, and said, &#145;Thus dies one of the king's judges&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.667). Many royalists received the news of the murder with satisfaction, and even the cautious Sir Edward Nicholas described the assassination as &#145;the deserved execution&#146; of &#145;the bloody villain&#146;  (Carte). The murderers made their escape with the assistance of the Portuguese ambassador, and Whitford successfully reached safety in Brussels. He rejoined Montrose to serve on his last Scottish expedition of 1650. With the surrender of his garrison at Dunbeath after Montrose's defeat at Carbisdale (27 April) Whitford was sentenced to be beheaded on 8 June with Sir John Urry, Sir Francis Hay, and other royalist officers. While being led to execution he exclaimed that he was to die for his part in killing Dorislaus. The authorities were anxious not to be seen to defend Dorislaus's deeds by executing Whitford on such a pretext and, having obtained confirmation of his part in the assassination, &#145;the council thought fit to avoid the reproach, and so preserved the gentleman&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 5.121). He was issued with a pass to leave the country on 25 June. Whitford was then protected by the earl of Derby, and was sheltered on the Isle of Man, where he avoided the attentions of the parliamentarian governor, who had been ordered to arrest him. By August 1656 he was at the court of Charles II and two years later was back at The Hague with the intention of killing another English diplomat, George Downing. Downing later complained to John Thurloe of the difficulty in securing Whitford's arrest and that he eventually departed for Muscovy &#145;in a ship loaded with ammunition&#146;  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 7.429). Whitford was forced to enter Russian service, though his family was awarded a small pension in 1662, and their coat of arms was altered on the king's orders. He had returned to England in 1663, when he petitioned for money to enable him to rejoin his wife in Russia, as part of the embassy of the earl of Carlisle. He was in England again by July 1666, when he petitioned for the post of town-major of Hull, and subsequently petitioned in 1670 for a pension to prevent his family from starving, stating on both occasions that he was disabled from active military service by his many wounds received in the royalist cause. He served as a lieutenant in the Scots foot guards under the earl of Linlithgow but was dismissed as a papist in 1673. In 1685 he was awarded a pension by James II and continued to be regarded with suspicion in Scotland, where he became a target for the anti-Catholic mob the following year. Bishop Burnet claimed that he died in 1686 following a deathbed rejection of Catholicism, and a recantation for his part in massacres committed in the service of the duke of Savoy in the 1650s  (Burnet, 3.115), but Wood correctly noted that he was still living in Edinburgh in 1691  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.1018), from where, destitute and infirm, he had issued one last petition to the Scottish privy council in 1690, pleading for support. His son Charles was principal of the Scots College at Paris in 1714.<br>
