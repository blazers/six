<span class="headword">Dodsley,  James</span>  (1724&#150;1797), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, the youngest of seven children of Robert Dodsley (<i>bap</i>. 1681, <i>d</i>. 1750), a local schoolmaster, and younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7755/', "Robert Dodsley (1704&#150;1764)")</script>. By 1742 James was employed in his brother's London bookshop at the sign of Tully's Head, his signature as witness appearing that year on Robert's agreement to purchase the copyright to Henry Baker's <span class="italic">The Microscope Made Easy</span>. Despite the central role Tully's Head played in the contemporary literary world, almost nothing is known of James during his first fifteen years at the shop: he is not mentioned in his brother's correspondence until 1757, and only one of his own letters survives from the period. His name was first joined with Robert's in the well-known imprint &#145;Printed for R. and J. Dodsley&#146; on 2 May 1753 when the firm published Henry Jones's poem <span class="italic">Merit</span>. On 3 December 1754 he became a member of the Stationers' Company by redemption, and, in April 1759, he assumed the reins of Tully's Head at his brother's retirement.<br>
<br>Although James Dodsley was bequeathed only &pound;500 at his brother's death in 1764, he inherited a small fortune in copyrights. Of these, the following, which he owned either in whole or in part, enjoyed multiple editions during James's years at Tully's Head: William Melmoth's translations of Cicero's <span class="italic">Letters</span> and Pliny's <span class="italic">Letters</span>, and his <span class="italic">Fitzosborne's &#145;Letters on Several Subjects&#146;</span>; Joseph Spence's <span class="italic">Polymetis</span>; William Whitehead's <span class="italic">The Roman Father</span>; William Duncan's <span class="italic">Elements of Logic</span>; Robert's own <span class="italic">Preceptor</span> and his weekly <span class="italic">The World</span>; and Samuel Johnson's <span class="italic">Rasselas</span> and <span class="italic">Dictionary</span>. To these James added many editions of Robert Dodsley's own works, including <span class="italic">The King and the Miller of Mansfield</span> and <span class="italic">The Oeconomy of Human Life</span>, the most printed work of the century. Likewise, James continued to issue Robert's popular collections, the <span class="italic">Select Fables of Aesop</span>, <span class="italic">Select Collection of Old Plays</span>, and <span class="italic">Collection of Poems by Several Hands</span> (the most popular poetic miscellany of the last half of the century), the latter two re-edited by Isaac Reed.<br>
<br>James Dodsley's own industry added many new titles to Tully's Head credits, including works by Frances Brooke, Richard Cumberland, Oliver Goldsmith, Richard Graves, Charlotte Lennox, Horace Walpole, and, notably, Laurence Sterne's <span class="italic">Sermons of Mr. Yorick</span>. Christopher Anstey's <span class="italic">The New Bath Guide</span> (1766) netted eleven editions for Dodsley in its first ten years. By far his most profitable publication, Edmund Burke's <span class="italic">Reflections on the Revolution in France</span>, passed through seven editions and 18,000 copies in 1790 alone. Other popular titles included Lord Chesterfield's <span class="italic">Letters to his Son</span> (ten editions by 1793), Soame Jenyns's <span class="italic">Internal Evidence of the Christian Religion</span> (seven editions by 1785), and Thomas Warton's <span class="italic">History of English Poetry</span>. James Dodsley's joining the London Congers in the early 1780s gave a new direction to Tully's Head's agenda, for most of his subsequent publications involved joint undertakings of large printings of multi-volume editions of established authors, such as Johnson's <span class="italic">Lives of the Poets</span>.<br>
<br>Some time late in 1786, after forty-four years at Tully's Head, Dodsley announced his retirement, only to resume business two weeks later. On 7 June of the next year he suffered a major loss when &pound;2500 of uninsured stock went up in flames at his Lincoln's Inn warehouse. John Nichols, who was dining with the bookseller during the fire, reports that Dodsley bore the news &#145;without the least apparent emotion&#146;, and before the fire was extinguished, sold the potential waste paper to a member of the company for &pound;100. The agreement was not fulfilled, however, and Dodsley later sold the residue for &pound;80  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 6.439). The following year Dodsley paid the usual fine to avoid the office of sheriff of London and Westminster. His reserved manner is reflected in his obituary printed in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>: &#145;He kept a carriage many years, but studiously wished that his friends should not know it, nor did he ever use it on the eastern side of Temple Bar&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 347). Some time in the 1780s Dodsley bought an estate between Chislehurst and Bromley but rarely visited it. He continued in his Pall Mall house, but, during the early 1790s, he seems to have turned over his retail business to George Nicol and to have acted merely as a wholesaler for his own productions.<br>
<br>Dodsley died at his home in Pall Mall on 19 February 1797. He was buried in St James's Church, Westminster, where his epitaph reads, in part: &#145;a man of retired and contemplative turn of mind&#146;, who was &#145;upright and liberal in all his dealings&#146; and &#145;a friend to the afflicted in general, and to the poor of this parish in particular&#146;. Having never married, he distributed his estate&#151;estimated at &pound;70,000&#151;primarily to his nephews and nieces. His stock and copyrights were sold at the Globe tavern, Fleet Street, London, on 18 October 1797, ending the house of Dodsley.<br>
<br>Although he was at the helm of Tully's Head several years longer than his brother and predecessor, Robert, James Dodsley did not seem to enjoy all of Robert's energy and enterprise; nor did he possess his brother's literary talent. Besides his career as a bookseller, Robert also earned some contemporary reputation as a poet and playwright; James does not seem to have authored any works. Although James published some major works during his time, nothing approached Robert's ingenious conception and execution of such undertakings as the <span class="italic">Select Collection of Old Plays</span>, the <span class="italic">Collection of Poems by Several Hands</span>, and <span class="italic">Select Fables of Aesop</span>. Nor did James initiate any periodicals as did Robert. In short, Robert was a literary man as well as a bookseller; James was a businessman.<br>
