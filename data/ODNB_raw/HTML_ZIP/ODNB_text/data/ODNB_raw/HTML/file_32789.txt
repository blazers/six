<span class="headword">D'Erlanger, Sir  Gerard John Regis Leo</span>  (1906&#150;1962), <span class="occ">airline company director and financier</span>, was born at Hall Place, Bexley, Kent, on 1 June 1906. He was the only son and the elder of the two children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48868/', "Baron Emile Beaumont D'Erlanger (1866&#150;1939)")</script>, international banker and chairman of Erlangers Ltd, and his wife, (Marie Rose Antoinette) Catherine de Robert d'Aqueria, daughter of the marquis de Rochegude of Boll&egrave;ne in Vaucluse, France. He was educated at Eton College where he acquired the nickname &#145;Pop&#146; by which he was known to his friends for the rest of his life. As a member of a family which had as many links with France as with England, D'Erlanger completed his education in Paris and then qualified in London as a chartered accountant in 1933. At the same time he took up private flying with enthusiasm and gained a pilot's &#145;A licence&#146; (Royal Aero Club aviator's certificate no. 9730) at the Airwork Flying School at Heston in Middlesex on 11 March 1931. In company with two wealthy friends, Gordon Selfridge the younger and Whitney Straight, he acquired a taste for continental touring by air and, on a business visit to Argentina in 1932, flew himself around in a single-seat Composer Swift. He started a career in the family tradition when he joined Myers &amp; Co. in 1934 and, in the following year, became a member of the London stock exchange.<br>
<br>Already D'Erlanger's flying interests had begun to extend beyond the sporting field. In 1934 he joined the board of the privately owned Hillman's Airways. No more incongruous&#151;or successful&#151;association could be imagined than that of the tough, self-made businessman, Edward Hillman, and the young, urbane, Etonian accountant. Hillman died in December 1934 just as the company went public, and D'Erlanger took a leading part in bringing his father's banking house to invest in the company. There was already one other financial institution entering the field of air transport&#151;Whitehall Securities, founded by the first Lord Cowdray, managed by Clive Pearson, and including on its board Harold Balfour MP. In 1935, thanks largely to D'Erlanger and Balfour, Hillman's Airways merged with United Air Lines, owned by Whitehall Securities, and was renamed British Airways in 1936. The result was a powerful independent airline with substantial financial backing which could challenge the state-supported Imperial Airways.<br>
<br>D'Erlanger became a director of British Airways on its formation and in 1937 he married Gladys Florence, daughter of H. J. Sammut; they had one son and two daughters, one of whom, Mary Caroline (Minnie), was the first wife of Winston Churchill (<i>b</i>. 1940). On 1 April 1940, following the report of the committee chaired by Lord Cadman, Imperial Airways and British Airways were merged to form the state-owned British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), with D'Erlanger on the board of BOAC from its official beginning.<br>
<br>Before this, when war was clearly imminent, D'Erlanger began negotiations in 1938 with the Air Council member for development and production, Air Marshal Sir Wilfrid Freeman, for an auxiliary force of private pilots, too old or unfit for military service, who might be used to ferry aircraft from manufacturers to squadrons in time of war. At first the Air Ministry was lukewarm but, when war was declared in September 1939, Air Transport Auxiliary rapidly came into being at White Waltham, near Maidenhead, Berkshire, with D'Erlanger as commandant. During the next six years 1215 men and women from fourteen nations ferried some 308,000 aircraft of 147 different types in all weathers and often in the most difficult conditions, with the loss of 173 lives, sixteen of whom were women. A memorial was set up in St Paul's Cathedral with their motto: <i>Aetheris avidi</i> (&#145;Eager for the air&#146;). For this contribution to the war effort D'Erlanger was made a CBE in 1943.<br>
<br>Before the war ended, D'Erlanger began discussions with Sir Harold Hartley, chairman of the Railway Air Services, about the formation of a new airline for domestic and European services. The result was the formation on 1 August 1946 of British European Airways (BEA), a second nationalized corporation. It took over the former services of the independent airlines, including those of Railway Air Services and BOAC's European routes, under Hartley's chairmanship and with D'Erlanger as managing director. When Hartley became chairman of BOAC in July 1947, D'Erlanger took the chair of BEA but&#151;following a dispute about the level of subsidy with the minister of civil aviation, Lord Pakenham&#151;he resigned on 14 March 1949 and returned to the City. He was succeeded as chairman of BEA by Lord Douglas of Kirtleside. D'Erlanger was a member (from 1952) and deputy chairman (from 1954) of the Air Transport Advisory Council, resigning in 1955.<br>
<br>Early in 1956, after the resignation of Sir Miles Thomas in the wake of the disasters involving the early jet airliner Comet I, D'Erlanger was appointed chairman of BOAC. It was a very difficult time, with BOAC having to use obsolescent equipment in the face of its competitors' more modern aircraft and having to fight the ministry and the Treasury over the shortage of dollars needed to buy American equipment and costs generally, which neither understood. D'Erlanger's tenure was made the more difficult both because he was a part-time, unpaid chairman who operated from his flat in London, and because the government pressed for purchase of the VC-10 and Super VC-10 jet airliners rather than allowing BOAC to buy all Boeing 707s. D'Erlanger signed the contract despite the protests of incoming chairman, Sir Matthew Slattery.<br>
<br>D'Erlanger was knighted in 1958. He retired from BOAC in 1960 to devote himself to City affairs as chairman of City and International Trust, of the General and Consolidated Investment Trust, and of the Moorgate Investment Company. He was also deputy chairman of the Provident Mutual Life Association, and a director of John Mackintosh &amp; Sons and of Philip Hill Investment Trust, with which Erlangers had merged. He settled down to enjoy a less onerous life at his home at 11 Hyde Park Street in London. Surrounded by a circle of friends, he had wide interests, which included the Royal Yacht Squadron. Two years after his retirement he died suddenly on 15 December 1962, at his home in London. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Pop D'Erlanger's chief contribution to British aviation was to bring together early commercial airline interests and adequate finance in the years before the war of 1939&#150;45, and to help consolidate their scattered remnants to form BEA under state ownership in 1946. His imaginative formation of the Air Transport Auxiliary in 1939 provided a valuable source of flying experience which might otherwise have remained untapped. This was a contribution to the war effort which, because it fitted no service mould, went largely unrecognized. Always pleasant, often worried, never happy with officialdom, D'Erlanger had an innate reserve which, combined with difficulty in communication, kept him from still greater attainments. In aviation he was a gifted amateur in a tough professional field and a political amateur in a highly politicized industry; in finance he was very much the professional who was often among amateurs.<br>
