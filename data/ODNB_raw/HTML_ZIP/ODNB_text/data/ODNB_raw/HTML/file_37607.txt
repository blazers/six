<span class="headword">Fordham,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1340&#150;1425), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Ely</span>, was born in Fordham, Cambridgeshire, to a family of no obvious distinction. His only certain kinsman, John Kirkby, worked for him in later years, as did John Fordham, who was a squire (<i>scutifer</i>), and Thomas Fordham. Employed first by Edward III, he rose under Edward, the Black Prince, and became the latter's secretary in 1375 and an executor of his will in 1376. From 1 January 1377 he was receiver and keeper of the privy seal to the Black Prince's young son, Richard, prince of Wales, and on the latter's accession to the throne, Fordham at once (on 26 June 1377) became keeper of the king's privy seal. At that time this office was doubtless regarded as less significant than under an adult king, and Fordham was no politician, but proximity to the boy king and his household soon proved more important than had been intended. The insurgents in London in 1381 called for Fordham's death, but in the event he suffered no more than damage to his house and wine cellar.<br>
<br>Fordham could sustain this, for the royal household had brazenly looked after its own. Having secured the deanship of Wells in 1379 by royal request, and the prestigious archdeaconry of Canterbury in 1380&#150;81, Fordham secured election on 30 May 1381 to the mighty see of Durham. The temporalities were restored on 23 October, and on 12 December he resigned the privy seal (as was conventional). He was consecrated at Lambeth on 5 January 1382. Fordham went north in the summer and stayed there. Problems over the Anglo-Scottish border he could not avoid, but, that apart, his days in royal service seemed done. However, Richard II and his government were lurching towards an angry showdown with their critics. With the crisis already well in motion, the beleaguered king recalled his family's loyal servant to become treasurer of the realm on 17 January 1386.<br>
<br>This was a hapless task, and inevitably Fordham could not survive the general onslaught on the chief ministers in the Wonderful Parliament. He resigned on 24 October 1386 with the rest. Even so, he remained with the king in 1387 as Richard prowled the midlands seeking to regain control. When the opposition took to arms to break the king's affinity, Fordham was among those banished from court. Still, he was not arrested or forced to flee, and could attend the Merciless Parliament in February 1388 without fear of being among those indicted. In March he was ordered with other northern lords to hasten to defend the border against Scottish invasion. There, like others, he left the Percys to suffer from their rashness at the battle of Otterburn. Already though, on 3 April, he had been translated by the pope (at the opposition's request) to Ely, as part of an unprecedented political reshuffle of the episcopate. Yet, if Durham had special strategic and political features that made Fordham unacceptable there in the eyes of the crown's opponents and of key northern lords, Ely was notoriously the rich neo-sinecure of English bishoprics, and for Fordham a homecoming. He took to it at once after the bull arrived in September 1388. Probably he was not sorry, and never wanted to be recalled to secular politics again.<br>
<br>Fordham attended parliaments fairly regularly until late in life, and once (in 1406) agreed to help settle Baltic trade disputes. That apart, he came to live almost permanently at his episcopal manor of Downham. His longevity exasperated contenders for episcopacy, particularly his perennial ability to fail then rally. His will, dated 3 October 1425, is an attractive picture of an old man at peace in a little world of cathedral, household, and staff, for all of whom he made careful provision in a modest, surprisingly austere account. It would seem natural that from the outside world only Edward III, the Black Prince, and Richard II entered his final thoughts. Even at the end he clung to life for seven weeks more. He died on 18 November 1425 and was buried, as he requested, not in the nave but in the lady chapel of Ely.<br>
