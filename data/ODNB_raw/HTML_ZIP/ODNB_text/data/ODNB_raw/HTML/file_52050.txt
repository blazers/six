<span class="headword">Wilkinson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lumsden]</span>, Dame  Louisa Jane</span>  (1889&#150;1968), <span class="occ">military nurse</span>, was born Louisa Jane Lumsden on 11 December 1889 at 5 Peel Street, Sunderland. She was the daughter of James Lumsden, merchant seaman, and his wife, Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Benskin; she had at least one brother, Robert, but little else is known about her family or her early life. She was educated at Bede Collegiate School, Sunderland, and Thornbeck Collegiate School, Darlington, and she embarked upon her nursing career in 1911, aged twenty-two.<br>
<br>Louisa had just completed her training at the Royal Infirmary, Sunderland, when the First World War was declared, and she immediately joined Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service (QAIMNS) as a reservist. Established by royal warrant in March 1902 under the patronage of Queen Alexandra, the QAIMNS combined the forces of army nurses and those of the Princess Christian's Army Nursing Service Reserve, and was responsible for the nursing of sick and wounded soldiers at home and abroad. Louisa's postings at military hospitals in the United Kingdom were followed by a tour of duty on Malta, but by late 1917 she had returned to Britain. On 20 December 1917 she married Robert John Wilkinson (1884&#150;1918), an acting captain with Queen Victoria's first Royal Irish Fusiliers. The marriage, which took place at Fulham register office, was tragically short, for her husband was killed on active service on 2 June 1918.<br>
<br>After the war, childless and widowed, Wilkinson joined the QAIMNS as a regular. She rose quickly through the ranks from staff nurse to sister, serving first in the United Kingdom and then, after 1926, as one of the pioneer nurses posted to India. Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War she returned to London as principal matron at the War Office, and for two years was involved in setting the army nursing services on a wartime footing. In 1942 she returned to India to take up what proved to be her most challenging post, that of chief principal matron. Her remit was to organize all the Indian military nursing services and auxiliary nursing centres&#151;a daunting task given the severe shortage of trained nurses in the country. In typical fashion, and with her usual efficiency, Wilkinson founded a nurses' training scheme for Indian women, and succeeded in making India one of the largest nursing commands in the world. She was also responsible for establishing the postgraduate school of nursing administration in the country, which ensured that the improved standards of training in Indian military hospitals was maintained. On her return to the United Kingdom in May 1944 she was appointed matron-in-chief of the QAIMNS at the War Office, a position she held with great dignity until her retirement in October 1948.<br>
<br>Throughout her lifetime Wilkinson's vivid personality earned her the respect of her many friends and admirers. She was renowned for being cheerful and warm-hearted, practical as well as courageous. Her contribution to nursing services earned her a number of decorations. In 1919 she was awarded the British Empire Medal and the Royal Red Cross, second class; in 1941 she was awarded the Royal Red Cross, first class, in recognition of special services rendered in nursing the sick and wounded of the army and navy, and as a result of her exceptional work in India she was appointed OBE in 1943. After being appointed CBE in 1946 she was then made dame commander in the military division of the Order of the British Empire in 1948.<br>
<br>In retirement Dame Louisa was elected president of the Royal College of Nursing in 1948, a unique honour for a service matron, and significant in that it maintained the link between military and civil nursing. In 1949 she was also deeply involved in the establishment of Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps (QARANC), which brought together the QAIMNS and the Territorial Army Nursing Service (the TANS, which dated from 1907), and she served as first controller commandant QARANC until 1954. The foundation and early running of the QARANC Association, in which Queen Mary took such an interest, was also the result of Dame Louisa's devotion and hard work.<br>
<br>On 4 December 1968 Dame Louisa Wilkinson suffered a coronary thrombosis, and was pronounced dead on arrival at the War Memorial Hospital, Crowborough, Sussex. Her funeral took place at All Saints' Church, Crowborough, nine days later, and her remains were interred in the town's garden of remembrance, in Herne Road. A fitting tribute was made at the thanksgiving service held in her honour at Millbank, London, on 15 January 1969:<blockquote>her great love for the QA's and indeed of the nursing profession made her an outstanding figure in our time, and now at her passing we reflect on her as a person and are thankful for her example and work. (<span class="italic">QARANC Association Gazette</span>, 3)</blockquote>The beneficiaries of her estate, which amounted to &pound;33,301, included members of her family, the Church of England Children's Society, London, Dr Barnardo's Homes, and the QARANC Association Benevolent Fund.<br>
