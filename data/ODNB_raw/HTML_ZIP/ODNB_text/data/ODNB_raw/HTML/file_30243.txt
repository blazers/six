<span class="headword">Yorke,  Joseph</span>, Baron Dover  (1724&#150;1792), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born in London on 24 June 1724, the third son of the celebrated lawyer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30245/', "Philip Yorke, first earl of Hardwicke (1690&#150;1764)")</script>, and his wife, Margaret Lygon, n&eacute;e Cocks (<i>c</i>.1695&#150;1761). Born into the whig establishment and brought up within it, Yorke's own career became a monument to the passing of this age. In company with his four brothers, he was educated at Dr Newcombe's famous school at Hackney and by a private tutor, Dr Samuel Slater, recommended as &#145;a good scholar of exemplary character and Whig principles&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Correspondence of Philip Yorke</span>, 1.102). While his elder brothers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30246/', "Philip Yorke (1720&#150;1790)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30237/', "Charles Yorke (1722&#150;1770)")</script> were destined by family strategy for the law or politics, a military career beckoned for Joe as a younger son. The political correspondent and political manager <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68350/', "Elizabeth Anson (1725&#150;1760)")</script> was his sister. In April 1741 at the age of sixteen he was commissioned as an ensign in the duke of Cumberland's regiment of guards. The War of the Austrian Succession (1740&#150;48) provided opportunities for aspiring soldiers, and Yorke's own application and abilities, together with the support of George II's favourite son, ensured that he rose rapidly. He served first with the earl of Stair's forces in the Low Countries, took part in the victory at Dettingen (June 1743), was promoted captain, and in 1745 became an aide-de-camp to Cumberland, distinguishing himself in the defeat at French hands at Fontenoy (May 1745). His bravery on this occasion secured a commission as lieutenant-colonel in the 1st regiment of foot guards. On returning with Cumberland's forces to Britain when the Jacobite rising occurred later that year, he was present on the battlefield of Culloden (April 1746), where the Young Pretender was comprehensively defeated. Back on the continent, Yorke witnessed the Mar&eacute;chal de Saxe's great victory at Laufeldt (July 1747). His rising reputation was apparent in his appointment as an aide-de-camp to the king in 1749, a post he retained until 1758.<br>
<br>Yorke's experiences during the 1740s left him with an enduring and, before long, exaggerated fear of French military power which remained central to his political outlook. Though he had risen swiftly in the army during the war, that career did not offer a path to the political summit which was his goal. In the final stages of the fighting he had made important contacts with members of the Dutch political &eacute;lite, and he now embarked upon diplomatic service as a route to high office in England. His father, then lord chancellor, and the latter's political confidant the duke of Newcastle, together secured a flying start for the young man. Having been sent to Paris as a member of the peace commission at the end of the War of the Austrian Succession, he remained there after its conclusion and served as secretary of embassy (1749&#150;51) to the new British ambassador, the earl of Albemarle, a post he occupied until October 1751. In December of that year Yorke was parachuted, at the tender age of twenty-seven, into the key mission to the Dutch republic, then second only to France in the hierarchy of British diplomatic appointments. It was to be his only permanent post: he remained at The Hague until December 1780, first as minister-plenipotentiary (1751&#150;61) and then as ambassador after August 1761, in which year he was also awarded a KB. This was the longest period of continuous service at a major post of any eighteenth-century British diplomatist.<br>
<br>Yorke's nomination was part of a significant reconfiguration of Anglo-Dutch relations. The two countries had been allies since the age of the stadholder-king, William III, who had ruled on both sides of the narrow seas (1689&#150;1702) and had fought against Louis XIV's France in the wars of 1689 to 1714. The Dutch republic had spent its power and especially its fiscal strength in that conflict, and during the 1740s the extent of its political and economic decline, under way for a generation, had finally become evident, particularly to its British ally. Though the stadholderate had been restored in 1747 in the person of William IV (1747&#150;51), the republic could no longer play its traditional role in international relations and especially in Britain's alliance system. The solution sponsored by the leading Orangist statesman Willem Bentinck van Rhoon through his political ally Newcastle was as simple as it was ingenious. Subordinating the weakened Dutch republic to its increasingly powerful British partner, he persuaded London to assume the twin roles of dominant force in the alliance and buttress of the house of Orange. Its fragile domestic position was further weakened shortly before Britain's new representative reached The Hague by William IV's early and unexpected death in autumn 1751. The regency for his young son, the future William V, was headed by his widow, Anna, George II's eldest daughter.<br>
<br>Yorke's role was to uphold the alliance and the house of Orange which protected it, and this he did throughout the next generation with exemplary diligence but rather less flexibility and intelligence. The changing balance of forces between the two countries made it an unequal partnership, and this first became evident during the Seven Years' War (1756&#150;63). Though the republic had declined economically, it retained a substantial share of colonial and European commerce and was a natural target for France during wartime. Even worse, from a British perspective, the relevant treaties which dated from the seventeenth century gave Dutch merchants a privileged position as neutral traders during Anglo-French hostilities. In 1758 a British naval and privateering offensive against France's Caribbean trade led to the seizure of a number of Dutch ships and provoked a serious diplomatic confrontation. On this occasion a settlement was patched up, as the British government made concessions in order to support the Orangist regime, further weakened by the death of the <i>princesse-gouvernante</i>, Anna, at the beginning of 1759. The problems of neutral rights were already apparent, however, and they would loom even larger during the final years of Yorke's mission.<br>
<br>Hardwicke and Newcastle were leading figures during the 1750s and early 1760s, and their influence ensured that Yorke's star remained in the ascendant. He rejected a posting to Russia in 1754, and was sent on what became a special mission to Frederick the Great between April and June 1758: intended to replace Andrew Mitchell as Britain's representative, he was hurriedly withdrawn when both Prussian and British policy were thrown into reverse. Three years later Yorke was named as one of the three British plenipotentiaries to the abortive peace congress at Augsburg, while in 1763 and again in 1766 he was offered and rejected the post of ambassador to Madrid. Implicit in the offer of an embassy to Spain was both the reduced importance of the Dutch republic within the wider framework of British foreign policy and Yorke's own declining connections at home.<br>
<br>By the 1760s an entire political generation was passing from the scene: Yorke's father, Hardwicke, died in 1764, Newcastle four years later. However, Yorke retained important connections. The new king, George III, used him secretly for private family diplomacy, most notably in 1766 in an unsuccessful attempt to substitute the king's sister, Louisa, as the stadholder's bride, thereby preventing the marriage of William V to a Hohenzollern princess. That union symbolized the Dutch republic's transition from its traditional British orbit into a new Prussian one. Yet even the king's support could not secure the Paris embassy or a cabinet post for the ambassador, whom he famously described as Britain's &#145;foreign political watchman at The Hague&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of George III</span>, 4.20). Throughout his mission Yorke was an MP, successively for East Grinstead (1751&#150;61), Dover (1761&#150;74), and Grampound (1774&#150;80). Unlike Horatio Walpole in an earlier generation, however, he played no discernible role in the House of Commons, where he neither spoke nor voted, valuing only the prestige conferred by membership. The ambassador's inability to take on a parliamentary role was the ostensible reason why Lord North did not appoint him to a secretaryship of state in 1778.<br>
<br>The decline of his political connections at home was one reason why Yorke remained marooned at The Hague throughout the 1760s and 1770s. Another was his difficult personality, which flawed his whole career. The ambassador was a man of few social graces, with a talent which bordered on genius for alienating his friends and antagonizing his opponents. James Boswell, passing through the republic shortly after the Seven Years' War, claimed that &#145;he seemed so anxious lest people should not know that he was an Ambassador that he held his head very high and spoke very little&#146;, styled him a &#145;buckram knight&#146;, and declared that he was &#145;rendered ridiculous by affected airs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Boswell on the Grand Tour</span>, 171). Even a more sympathetic British observer, Sir Nathaniel Wraxall, commented discreetly on Yorke's &#145;defects of external deportment&#146; and declared that &#145;his manners and address had in them something formal and ceremonious&#146;  (Wraxall, 1.180). Dutch statesmen were considerably less charitable, finding the ambassador proud, overbearing, haughty, and prone to transact official negotiations through threats and demands rather than through the discussions and compromises which were the mainsprings of eighteenth-century diplomacy.<br>
<br>These shortcomings became particularly important during the final years of Yorke's mission. The outbreak of rebellion in Britain's North American colonies in 1775 once more placed the combustible issue of neutral rights at the top of the diplomatic agenda. At first the moderation exhibited by both governments kept the disputes within bounds. The outbreak of an Anglo-French war within Europe in summer 1778 sharply reduced the scope for compromise, and very soon British seizures of Dutch shipping, now on a wholly new scale, together with the decisions of English prize courts, produced Dutch complaints and reprisals. Yorke's provocative conduct exacerbated matters and further raised the political temperature as the situation deteriorated during 1779&#150;80. He was now openly contemptuous of the Orangist regime and of William V, the unimpressive stadholder at its head. Crucially, he failed to recognize that the authorities at The Hague could not control the republic's commercial provinces, Holland and Zeeland, which had been inflamed by British seizures, and so deliver the concessions which Britain's volatile ambassador was demanding. Yorke's own political ideas had not moved beyond the 1740s and 1750s when he had grown to maturity: automatic opposition to France, support for the republic and the house of Orange. He believed that Dutch politics still revolved around the struggle of Orangists and regents: he failed to appreciate the extent to which the rise of the patriot movement, with its demand for a less oligarchical basis of Dutch political life, was changing the complexion of the republic's politics. Bad history and a worse grasp of present political reality led him to sponsor a desperate solution: a British attack on the republic, intended to revive the stadholderate exactly as the French attacks of 1672 and 1747 had done. His own influence and, more importantly, the threatened Dutch accession to Catherine II's &#145;armed neutrality&#146;, a league of Europe's commercial states, led to the adoption of his plan by his superiors, and on Boxing day 1780 Yorke left The Hague. The Fourth Anglo-Dutch War (1780&#150;84) which followed had the opposite effect to that intended by the ambassador: shattering Dutch defeats further weakened the stadholderate, rather than strengthening it.<br>
<br>Yorke's final years in England were uneventful. On 23 June 1783 the lifelong bachelor married the Danish Baroness de St&ouml;cken, Christiana Boetzelaer (<i>c</i>.1714&#150;1793), the elderly widow of a Dutch nobleman, Baron de Boetzelaer, and the daughter of Johan Henrik, Baron de St&ouml;cken; they had no children. Throughout his diplomatic career Yorke had received a series of military appointments and promotions, the last of which saw him rise to the rank of general (1777). During the 1780s he again seems to have played an active role in military affairs, while as late as 1787 he was consulted by the Pitt government over its foreign policy. In the following year he was created Baron Dover, a peerage which became extinct upon his death, at Hill Street, Mayfair, on 2 December 1792.<br>
