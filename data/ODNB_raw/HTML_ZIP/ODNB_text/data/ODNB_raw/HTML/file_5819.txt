<span class="headword">Cokayne, Sir  Aston</span>, baronet  (1608&#150;1684), <span class="occ">poet and playwright</span>, was born at Elvaston in Derbyshire in December 1608 and baptized at Ashbourne on 20 December, the eldest of the seven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5823/', "Thomas Cokayne (1587&#150;1638)")</script> and his wife, Anne Stanhope (<i>c</i>.1592&#150;1664), daughter of Sir John Stanhope of Elvaston and half-sister of Philip Stanhope, first earl of Chesterfield. Cokayne's parents belonged to an extended network of interrelated midlands gentry and aristocracy, many of whose members&#151;Cokaynes, Stanhopes, Hastings, Knyvetons, Reppingtons, Trenthams&#151;are addressed or commemorated in his poems. Cokayne lived for much of his life on the family properties at Ashbourne in Derbyshire and at Pooley Hall at Polesworth in Warwickshire.<br>
<br>Cokayne was educated at Chenies in Buckinghamshire under the rector there, Peter Allibond, before matriculating at Trinity College, Cambridge, about 1624. In 1628 he moved, without having taken a degree, to one of the inns of court, possibly the Inner Temple. He knew his fellow Trinity man Thomas Randolph well when &#145;<i>Cambridge</i> (for his wit) extol'd him so&#146;  (<span class="italic">Small Poems</span>, &#145;Epigrams&#146;, 2.89) and made many other literary contacts in London, claiming later that<blockquote>
<div>
<i>Donne</i>, <i>Suckling</i>, <i>Randolph</i>, <i>Drayton</i>, <i>Massinger</i>,<br>
</div>
<div>
<i>Habbington</i>, <i>Sandys</i>, <i>May</i>, my acquaintance were.<br>
</div> (ibid., 2.99)</blockquote>(Some friendships, however, he owed to his family background: he met Drayton through Warwickshire connections and he was a cousin of the poet Charles Cotton.) He frequented the theatre and contributed commendatory verses for Massinger's <span class="italic">The Emperor of the East</span> and <span class="italic">The Maid of Honour</span> in 1632; he also wrote his own comedy, <span class="italic">The Obstinate Lady</span>, about 1629&#150;31. (There is no record of a performance of this or Cokayne's other plays.) His detailed knowledge of the theatre of this time is attested to later by his &#145;Praeludium&#146; to Brome's <span class="italic">Five New Playes</span> of 1653 and by poems in which he complains that the editors of the Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1647 have failed to give due credit to the shares of the different contributors, including his &#145;good friend Old <i>Philip Massinger</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Small Poems</span>, &#145;Letters to divers persons&#146;, 7; &#145;Epigrams&#146;, 2.53).<br>
<br>On 9 July 1632 Cokayne took an oath of allegiance, presumably in order to remove suspicion of recusancy on the eve of his tour of Catholic Europe; he was a particular friend of the Catholics Andrew Knyveton and Francis Lenton and was probably a Catholic himself, although perhaps not openly so until the 1670s. Having set off on 16 July 1632 Cokayne proceeded via Paris, with only brief halts, to Venice. There he remained for about six months, during which time he enrolled as a student at the University of Padua on 11 October. In Venice he twice saw the company of the Affezionati improvise a production on the scenario &#145;Il creduto principe&#146;; on this he based his play <span class="italic">Trappolin creduto principe, or, Trappolin Supposed a Prince</span>. Although <i>commedia dell'arte</i> elements are evident the playwright &#145;has accommodated the plot-lines and figures of the improvised piece to a distinctively English dramatic style&#146;  (Richards, 246) and it seems likely enough&#151;especially given his theatrical connections&#151;to have achieved performance.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Trappolin</span> was, according to its epilogue:<blockquote>
<div>at Rome begun, half made<br>
</div>
<div>At Naples, at Paris the conclusion had.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Cokayne was in Rome for three weeks, including Easter 1633, in Naples for another three weeks, and in Paris for two months before returning to England in July 1633. After this, as far as is known, he lived mostly in Warwickshire (he inherited Pooley Hall from his father in 1639) and in Derbyshire. In 1634 he married Knyveton's sister Mary (<i>d</i>. 1683), daughter of Sir Gilbert Knyveton of Mercaston in Derbyshire. Their three children were Thomas (1636&#150;1679); Mary (<i>b</i>. 1640), who married first Thomas Henslow and then William Lacy; and Isabella (<i>b</i>. 1654), who married William Turville. It is likely that Cokayne paid a second visit to Venice since his translation (published, probably without his involvement, in 1654) of Giovanni Francesco Loredano's <span class="italic">La Dianea</span> (1627) is dated &#145;from Venice, 25 Oct. 1635&#146;  (&#145;The Author's Epistle&#146;). Conceivably, however, the date is an error for 1632.<br>
<br>On twelfth night 1639 Cokayne's <span class="italic">A Masque</span> was performed at Bretby in Derbyshire, home of his uncle the earl of Chesterfield. Like many of the &#145;great Company&#146; addressed by &#145;the <i>Lar Familiaris</i> of the house&#146;, Cokayne was evidently loyal to the royalist cause. He was created a baronet, probably either in January 1641 or after the outbreak of civil war in August 1642. (Probably also in 1642 he received an Oxford MA.) Few details of his war service are known except that he was serving under his kinsman Henry Hastings, Lord Loughborough, when Ashby-de-la-Zouch capitulated on 28 February 1646. He compounded as a delinquent on 1 March and was listed in May among those allowed to leave the country on any ship departing from Dover or Rye. In May 1648 he was in the Marshalsea prison. His fines were paid by a relative, William Cokayne, but he appears to have remained in prison until 1651, when he returned to Pooley.<br>
<br>Many of Cokayne's poems were written in the 1640s and early 1650s. They include references to puritan &#145;grumblings&#146; about drinking and to the silencing of plays in London by &#145;the Presbyter&#146;, as well as epitaphs on such royalist kinsfolk as Colonel Michael Stanhope, who &#145;fought, and dy'd/When prosp'rous fortune left the Regal side&#146;  (<span class="italic">Small Poems</span>, &#145;Epigrams&#146;, 2.24, 1.107, 1.89). He claims, however, that &#145;such troubles disagree/Both with my Genius as well as me&#146;  (ibid., 1.87), and the poems take up relatively little space in the extensive collection of epigrams, translations, funeral elegies, verse letters, encomia, and other pieces that became <span class="italic">Small Poems of Divers Sorts</span> (1658; also issued, with cancel title-page, as <span class="italic">A Chain of Golden Poems</span>). His elegy on Henry, Lord Hastings, was first published in the memorial collection <span class="italic">Lachrymae musarum</span> (1649).<br>
<br>Possibly Cokayne had always intended to publish his works but the immediate impetus to do so seems to have come from the unauthorized printing of <span class="italic">The Obstinate Lady</span> in 1657. Much of the verse was set as prose and someone else's conclusion substituted for Cokayne's missing last leaf; fearing that &#145;my <span class="italic">Trappolin</span>, and other Poems should have run the like misfortune&#146;, he arranged publication of <span class="italic">Small Poems</span>, he explains in the &#145;Apology to the reader&#146;, including <span class="italic">A Masque</span>, <span class="italic">Trappolin</span>, and the corrected <span class="italic">Obstinate Lady</span>. <span class="italic">The Tragedy of Ovid</span>, described as in progress in 1658, was added in <span class="italic">Poems</span> of 1662 (reissued in 1669 as <span class="italic">Choice Poems of Several Sorts</span>).<br>
<br>Cokayne succeeded to the estate at Ashbourne on his mother's death in 1664 but debts forced its sale in 1671. Further fines were incurred for recusancy in November 1678, and Pooley Hall was sold in 1683. Cokayne died in lodgings at Derby &#145;upon the breaking of the great frost&#146; in February 1684  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 130) and was buried on 13 February in the chancel of Polesworth church. By his will of 6 February 1684 (proved at Lichfield) he left &pound;79 to be divided between his daughters Mary and Isabella, and Mary's children.<br>
<br>The only known representation of Cokayne&#151;a somewhat unflattering laurelled bust&#151;appears in the later editions of the poems; &#145;no genteel face&#146;, observes Wood  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 129). According to Wood, Cokayne &#145;was esteemed by many an ingenious gent. a good poet and a great lover of learning, yet by others a perfect boon fellow, by which means he wasted all he had&#146;  (ibid., 130). Subsequent readers have found the poetry less &#145;good&#146; than of biographical and historical value. The plays, especially <span class="italic">Trappolin</span>, have attracted more interest. <span class="italic">A Duke and No Duke</span>, a farce based on <span class="italic">Trappolin</span> by Nahum Tate, was first performed in 1684; in one version or another it remained popular throughout the eighteenth century.<br>
