<span class="headword">Hinton,  Alfred Horsley</span>  (1863&#150;1908), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born at 255 Goswell Road, Clerkenwell, London, on 24 August 1863, the son (he had two older sisters) of Alfred Hinton (<i>b</i>. 1825/6), cheesemonger, and his wife, Mary Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Witherington (<i>b</i>. 1822/3). The family moved to Walthamstow, Essex, where he was brought up. He trained as an artist and draughtsman but also had a formidable writing talent.<br>
<br>From 1887 to 1891 Hinton was the editor of the short-lived <span class="italic">Photographic Art Journal</span>, and from 1889 also had some involvement with a photographic apparatus company in London. He married, on 23 April 1890, Louisa Jane (<i>b</i>. 1866/7), daughter of William Fisher Rolfe, manufacturer, of Woodford Green, Essex. Following the demise of the <span class="italic">Photographic Art Journal</span> he worked for Ralph Winwood Robinson, son of Henry Peach Robinson, as manager of the Guildford branch of Robinson's photographic portrait studio between 1891 and 1893.<br>
<br>Hinton never took to portraiture. His own photographic interests were in atmospheric, moody, and romantic large-format pictorial landscapes&#151;most often of the under-photographed Essex marshes or the Yorkshire moors&#151;which he printed, dramatically and exquisitely, in platinum. It seems likely that he gained his expertise in both combination printing (prints made from several different negatives to make a composite whole) and platinum printing (using platinum, rather than silver, for longevity and aesthetic effect and to give a wide range of subtle grey tones rather than the various shades of brown otherwise available) during his two years with Robinson.<br>
<br>After experiencing the daily monotonous grind of a commercial portrait studio Hinton soon went back to journalism and became the editor of <span class="italic">Amateur Photographer</span> from 1893 until his death. Finally he had found his calling. As editor of the most popular and widely read of British photographic publications he had a huge influence on British amateur photography for the next fifteen years. He wrote clear instructive articles about the intricacies of photographic technique, but also introduced a well-received bias towards the art of pictorial photography, giving the magazine a serious artistic validity it had not previously possessed. He also had an acerbic tongue and wrote provocatively and with conviction.<br>
<br>Hinton became the British photography world's most called upon spokesperson and frequently contributed articles and weekly columns to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, <span class="italic">The Graphic</span>, and various other art journals both in the UK, Europe, and the USA. He was the English correspondent of the <span class="italic">Photo-Club de Paris</span> through his contacts with Robert Demachy and, initially, was a friend and frequent correspondent of Alfred Stieglitz, the instigator and leader of the American <span class="italic">Photo-Secession</span>, although the relationship soured as both men sought leadership of art photography.<br>
<br>In 1892 Hinton had been a founder member of the Linked Ring Brotherhood, a group of photographers who had split away from the Photographic Society (by 1894 the Royal Photographic Society, RPS) to give more emphasis to photography as a creative art rather than a technical science. Hinton exhibited his platinum landscapes in the Linked Ring's annual photographic salon from 1892 to 1908, his prices ranging from 2 to 7 guineas. But while many of the Linked Ring members eventually drifted back to the RPS and were members of both organizations for a while, Hinton's application for RPS membership in 1894 was blackballed, and although he exhibited with the organization occasionally over the next decade, he never became a member. His journalistic pen was sharp, he was hugely influential, and he was perceived to be undesirable.<br>
<br>Something of a workaholic, Hinton also produced a great number of books on photography aimed at simplification and communication, including <span class="italic">Handbook of Illustrations</span> (1894), <span class="italic">Use of the Hand Camera</span> (1898), <span class="italic">Platinotype Printing: a Simple Book on the Process</span> (1904), and <span class="italic">How to Ensure Correct Exposure</span> (1907). He died prematurely, of enteric fever, on 25 February 1908, at his home, Ardshiel, Montalt Road, Woodford Green, Essex. His widow survived him. According to various contemporary accounts he had great personal charm. His obituary spoke of &#145;A lover of nature and natural history, an indefatigable worker, [a] nervously energetic temperament quick to give and receive appreciation, ever ready to lend a helping hand or friendly counsel to a photographic society or an isolated individual&#146;  (F. Lambert, <span class="italic">Photographic Journal</span>, March 1908, 165&#150;6). He was given a one-man posthumous exhibition by the RPS from 8 April to 5 May 1908, and <span class="italic">Amateur Photographer</span> established the Hinton memorial fund.<br>
