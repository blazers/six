<span class="headword">Sergison,  Charles</span>  (1654&#150;1732), <span class="occ">naval administrator</span>, was born in London. The exact date of his birth and the names of his parents are not known, but he had at least two siblings: an elder brother, Michael, and a sister, Sarah, later the wife of Thomas Gibson of Darlington, co. Durham.<br>
<br>In July 1671 Sergison became a clerk at Chatham Dockyard. From 25 December 1675 he was a temporary clerk examining pursers' and victuallers' accounts under the Navy Board's chief clerk for victualling accounts, John Godwin. While employed in this work he married Anne Crawley (<i>b</i>. 1657) on 15 June 1676 at St Peter-le-Poer, London. She was a relation, possibly the daughter, of John Crawley, who too served as a Navy Board clerk from 1680 to 1717.<br>
<br>On 26 March 1677 Sergison was promoted to fill the place previously held by Richard Gibson as one of two clerks serving the clerks of the acts, Thomas Hayter and James Sotherne. Sergison remained in this post until 1686, when James II and the Admiralty secretary Samuel Pepys began to make administrative initiatives to reverse the decline in fleet efficiency and to rectify the administrative backlog that had resulted from the naval retrenchment during the last years of Charles II's reign. As part of this, the Navy Board's traditional organization was temporarily set aside. Five special commissioners for current business were appointed for three years. These new commissioners appointed Sergison as their secretary at a salary of &pound;300 and assigned him the duties of keeping their minutes and maintaining records.<br>
<br>In August 1688 the commissioners reported their work complete, and in October the commission was dissolved, at which time many of the traditional offices of the Navy Board were revived, including that of clerk of the acts. On its revival Sergison at first retained the title of secretary, but in July 1689 he was named assistant clerk of the acts, while continuing to earn the same salary. In January 1690 James Sotherne, who had alone been clerk of the acts since 1679, left the Navy Board to become Admiralty secretary, and in his place Sergison was promoted. Sergison was the longest-serving of any clerk of the acts, holding office for more than twenty-nine years, from 6 February 1690 to 21 May 1719. For most of this period he held the office alone, though Samuel Atkins served jointly with him for four years from 11 February 1702 until Atkins's death in August 1706.<br>
<br>Following William III's death Sergison's patent was renewed on 28 August 1702 as a joint appointment, and again as an individual appointment on 26 August 1706, 6 October 1707, and 16 November 1714. Throughout this period, which included the entire Nine Years' War (1688&#150;97), the War of the Spanish Succession (1702&#150;13), and the naval war with Spain in 1718&#150;19, Sergison, as clerk of the acts, was fourth in seniority at the Navy Board (after the treasurer, controller, and surveyor of the navy) but the principal civil servant in charge of its daily business. In this he acted as its collective secretary, directly responsible for drawing up contracts and drafts of letters on such matters as finance, victualling, contracts, stores, dockyard management, sick and wounded, and ship maintenance and construction. All this took place at the board's office, located in a building erected after its smaller predecessor had burnt in 1673, but still at the angle between Seething Lane and Crutched Friars, Tower Hill.<br>
<br>Sergison was granted arms in 1691, and in 1693 he bought the mortgage on a country house which he eventually purchased: Cuckfield Park, an Elizabethan structure originally built by the ironmaster Henry Bowyer in 1573 at the village of Cuckfield, Sussex. In later years Sergison enlarged Cuckfield Park by acquiring the nearby manors of Bentley Park (1697), Legh (1707), and Slaugham (1727). Throughout his career he appears to have been an extremely hard-working and diligent civil servant, who placed great emphasis on implementing modern administrative procedures. In addition to his work as clerk of the acts Sergison was elected MP for Shoreham in 1698 and retained that seat in the government's interest until defeated in 1702.<br>
<br>Despite, or more likely because of, his diligent work Sergison did not enjoy good health. During 1699 Samuel Pepys, a previous clerk of the acts, mentioned him among several of his friends who were ill, naming Sergison as one who was having a distressingly difficult time. On 24 May 1699, in an audience with William III on the state of the navy, Sergison repeatedly requested retirement, as he believed his health required a country life. The king reportedly replied, &#145;I can not part with you; I have more need of you now than ever&#146;  (Merriman, <span class="italic">Sergison Papers</span>, 9). The king authorized him to go to the country temporarily, if his health required it, but not permanently. Sergison made similar requests in 1701, which probably led to Atkins's joint appointment, a request that Sergison repeated after Atkins's death, but to no avail. Having reached the age of sixty-five, Sergison finally retired to Cuckfield Park in 1719, where he lived until his death on 26 November 1732. He was buried in Cuckfield parish church.<br>
<br>Typically for his time, Sergison took home with him on retirement the records of his office as well as a large collection of Navy Board ship models. His wife had died before him, and there were no children of the marriage; Sergison left Cuckfield Park and his naval collections to his elder brother's grandson. He also left a tenement in Leadenhall Street, London, named the King's Arms, and another in Chailey, Sussex, along with fifty cash bequests ranging from &pound;10 to &pound;5000, totalling nearly &pound;28,000, to a wide range of relatives; to his household servants, who included at least one black servant; and to the poor of Cuckfield parish church, St Olave, Hart Street, London, and Christ's Hospital, London. Thomas Adley's wall monument to Sergison in the north aisle of Cuckfield parish church may well express Sergison's ideal of a civil servant. On it the figure of Truth is seated on a sarcophagus, holding a medallion portrait of Sergison, supported by a cherub.<br>
