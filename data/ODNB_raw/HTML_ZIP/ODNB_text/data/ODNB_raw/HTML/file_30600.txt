<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Barnardo,  Thomas John</span>  (1845&#150;1905), <span class="occ">philanthropist and founder of Dr Barnardo's Homes</span>, was born on 4 July 1845 at 4 Dame Street, Dublin, the fourth of five children of John Michaelis Barnardo (1800&#150;1874), a Prussian subject and furrier, and his second wife, Abigail, daughter of Philip O'Brien and his wife, Elizabeth <i>n&eacute;e</i> Drinkwater. John Barnardo had arrived in Dublin in 1823 and in 1827 married Elizabeth O'Brien, elder sister of Abigail. She died in childbirth in 1836 leaving five children. John Barnardo married Abigail at the German church in London in 1837 and was naturalized a British subject in 1860.<br>
<br>Thomas Barnardo's birth was difficult and he was not expected to survive. A delicate child, he was baptized at St Andrew's Church, Dublin. His mother was more or less an invalid, and it was due to the care of his half-sister Sophie, who nursed him through several severe illnesses, that he grew into a lively, strong-willed, intelligent boy. He went first to a school kept by the Revd Mr Andrews and subsequently followed his two elder brothers to the School for Collegiate and General Education, 112 St Stephen's Green, Dublin, run by the Revd William Dundas. Dundas was a bully and Barnardo retained unhappy memories of his school days. Unlike his elder brothers he did not go on to Trinity College, but was apprenticed at fourteen to a wine merchant. Dissatisfied with his life, he reluctantly allowed himself to be taken to revivalist evangelical meetings by his mother and two brothers. When, in 1862, as he himself put it, he was brought to Christ, Barnardo's life was changed. His natural arrogance and assertiveness found a new base, and his newly acquired conviction that his life was to be a channel for God's work gave him a sense of purpose, albeit ill-defined.<br>
<br>To mark his changed life Barnardo went through a ceremony of believer's baptism in the Baptist Chapel in Abbey Street, and shortly after joined the open Plymouth Brethren and worshipped at Merrion Hall. Barnardo took up Sunday school teaching, joined the YMCA, and went visiting and preaching with Swift's Alley Mission. Barnardo was small, only 5 feet 3 inches, and his weak eyes meant he always had to wear spectacles; serious and with an earnest assertiveness, he was a somewhat conspicuous figure. With his restless energy, he found his life in Dublin unfulfilling.<br>
<br>Listening to Hudson Taylor's account of his work with the China Inland Mission, Barnardo was fired with ambition to go to China. Against his father's wishes he left for London in 1866, and lodged at 30 Coburn Street with several other potential candidates. It was Barnardo's inexperience as well as his unwillingness to accept the necessity of &#145;headship and government&#146; in the China mission that decided the leaders to delay consideration of his candidacy. There had been an outbreak of cholera in the East End and Barnardo visited and prayed with many of the sick. To gain experience while he waited Barnardo enrolled as a student at the London Hospital in 1867, and at the same time started teaching at the Ernest Street ragged school as well as preaching in the streets. Wishing to be his own master he appealed for funds for rooms where he could both teach and preach, and in 1868 acquired two cottages in Hope Place. Established as the East End Juvenile Mission this was the true beginning of Barnardo's work.<br>
<br>The discovery of Jim Jarvis, a homeless child, and the realization of the scale of child destitution and homelessness in the East End of London changed the focus of Barnardo's work. Originally concerned for the children's spiritual welfare, he saw the equal need to care for their material and physical well-being. Barnardo, always practical, set up a wood-chopping brigade and other trades to give the boys a means of earning a living, and those thought unlikely to prosper were sent to Canada under the auspices of Miss Annie McPherson, Scottish philanthropist and orphan-emigrator. Barnardo had the gift of telling a good story, boundless self-confidence, and a burning sense of mission. He was both appealing for funds and writing stories in <span class="italic">The Revival</span>, later known as <span class="italic">The Christian</span>. His stories provided him with a modest income; his appeals, coupled with the sale of photographs and help from wealthy evangelicals, enabled him to buy his first home for boys in Stepney in 1870&#150;71.<br>
<br>Barnardo, an ardent advocate of the temperance movement, bought a notorious public house, the Edinburgh Castle in Limehouse, east London, in 1872 and transformed it into the British Working Men's Coffee Palace. Barnardo had never finished his studies at the London Hospital, but appropriated the title of &#145;doctor&#146; and ordered that he should henceforth be known by that title. His decision to open another coffee house in the Mile End Road, however, brought him into conflict with another evangelist, Frederick Charrington, a member of the brewing family, who regarded the Mile End Road as his province.<br>
<br>Barnardo married Sarah Louise (Syrie) Elmslie on 17 June 1873 at Spurgeon's Metropolitan Tabernacle, London, in a Baptist service. The Elmslies lived in modest comfort in Richmond, and Barnardo had met Syrie through their joint interest in ragged-school work. Her father did not approve of the marriage, but a wealthy supporter, John Sands, gave the young couple a wedding present, Mossford Lodge, Barkingside, Essex, which enabled Barnardo to provide a home for girls as well as boys. The couple lived in the house, the girls all together in the coach house. It proved impossible to manage sixty girls under one roof, and Syrie's organizational powers in no way matched those of her husband. The experiment was not a success. Undaunted, Barnardo began to appeal for funds to build thirty cottages in the grounds.<br>
<br>The cottage-home system originated on the continent, and Barnardo, understanding its advantages, campaigned vigorously for a girls' village home. Funds for the first cottage were given as a memorial to a dead child, a popular idea, and in 1876 the first fourteen cottages were opened by Lord Cairns, the lord chancellor. It was at this time that the slogan &#145;No destitute boy ever refused admission&#146; was changed to &#145;No destitute child ever refused admittance&#146;, a policy that would lead to repeated financial crises for the organization. Barnardo had acquired a magazine, the <span class="italic">Children's Treasury</span>, in 1874, for which he wrote and which was financially successful. He set up an editorial office at 279 Strand, London. His work in the East End was increasing and it was acknowledged that his mission was the largest and the fastest growing. With his flair for publicity, his entrepreneurial instincts&#151;he set up a photographic studio and sold &#145;before&#146; and &#145;after&#146; photos of children he rescued&#151;and his fund-raising ever more successful, his organizational skills and capacity for work were exceptional.<br>
<br>A pattern to Barnardo's life was now emerging. In his haste to expand he worked phenomenally long hours, but he paid the price in terms of illness. The stress under which he worked led to bouts of nervous exhaustion, insomnia, and depression which could last for weeks. He suffered from bronchial trouble and, for the last ten years of his life, from angina and increasing deafness. In his almost messianic drive to succour destitute children the organization was seldom out of debt, a fact which alienated many of his Brethren friends, as they believed in the precept &#145;owe no man anything&#146;. It was sometimes difficult to disentangle Barnardo's own financial situation from that of the homes, but by 1874 Mossford Lodge had become too expensive to maintain as a private residence and the Barnardos moved to Newbury House, Bow Street, Hackney.<br>
<br>Always sure of the righteousness of his cause, Barnardo broadcast the fact that he alone controlled the organization's funds, which had risen to over &pound;23,000 by 1875. His outstanding success blinded him to the dangers such overconfidence breeds. Less successful rivals, in particular Frederick Charrington and George Reynolds, an obscure Baptist minister, spread rumours about Barnardo's financial probity, the treatment of the children, and his right to the title of doctor, and finally made allegations about his personal life. Asserting his doctorate Barnardo produced a letter from the University of Geissen, later shown to be forged. Unwisely he sanctioned the publication of two letters, signed &#145;A Clerical Junius&#146;, in the <span class="italic">East London Observer</span> on 28 August and 4 September 1875 attacking Charrington in vitriolic terms. Reynolds responded, and with the secret connivance of the Charity Organization Society (COS) published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Dr Barnardo's Homes: Startling Revelations</span>. The publication gave the COS a reason to become publicly involved. One of the COS's functions was to investigate bogus charities and send warning letters to subscribers, and they blacklisted Barnardo's Homes. Barnardo took out a writ against Reynolds.<br>
<br>The evangelical community was appalled, as both sides had supporters. Although it was a bitter blow to Barnardo his trustees insisted that managerial responsibility be vested in them, and henceforth he was to be the director, appointed by them and able by them to be dismissed. They called in accountants, but the damage was done and funds started to fall. Barnardo himself went to Edinburgh and at the end of four months had obtained his licentiate from the Royal College of Surgeons. The trustees made Barnardo withdraw his writ against Reynolds and pushed Reynolds to agree to arbitration. They made application to the court of the exchequer and appointed the Hon. Alfred Thesiger to defend Barnardo, assisted by two juniors. The COS, which was covertly backing Reynolds, contributed to his defence, while Lord Cairns headed Barnardo's defence fund.<br>
<br>The opposition of the COS was based on its belief that indiscriminate charity was undermining the poor law, and under the leadership of C. S. Loch it never relaxed its efforts to discredit Barnardo both before and after the award was made. The arbitration was not exhaustive because Barnardo refused to reveal the name of the writer of the Clerical Junius letters. He admitted that he was closely associated with their production and accepted moral responsibility for them, but his refusal to name the writer was seen by many as a device to protect himself. As a result Reynolds refused to continue with his cross-examination, but the judges made an award none the less.<br>
<br>The arbitration had developed into a confrontation between those who sincerely disapproved of unorganized religious philanthropic endeavour and those who feared the threat to Barnardo's work represented a threat which could affect the whole Christian philanthropic movement. The award was generally favourable to Barnardo and the homes were crucially recognized as worthy of public confidence. Barnardo was criticized for his refusal to answer Reynolds and the use of artistic fiction in his photographs. He never sold photographs after 1877 and discontinued the use of the &#145;before&#146; and &#145;after&#146; photographs.<br>
<br>The arbitration, a turning point in Barnardo's life, was skated over in his official memoirs, edited by his wife and James Marchant in 1907. The case left Barnardo exhausted mentally and physically, and both director and the homes encumbered by debt. He had become a public figure, but doubts about his personal integrity lingered on. The homes now became known as Dr Barnardo's Homes and the title East End Juvenile Mission fell into disuse. Much against his will a committee of management was set up to bring about a measure of control. Cairns became president, a finance subcommittee was set up, and a visiting rota of trustees was established. To add to Barnardo's distress, owing to a business failure in 1883 he was forced to ask for an annual stipend, which was immediately granted. The arbitration also precipitated Barnardo's withdrawal from Brethrenism. He regarded his return to the Anglican fold as a private matter, fearing that if it became public he might lose supporters. The decision left him isolated and lonely.<br>
<br>Barnardo now had three children, William Stuart (<i>b</i>. 1874), Herbert (<i>b</i>. 1876), and Gwendoline (1879&#150;1955), known as Syrie [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40189/', "Maugham, (Gwendoline Maud) Syrie")</script>], who married Henry Wellcome in 1901 and, secondly, Somerset Maugham in 1917. The family had moved to The Cedars, Banbury Road, Hackney, in 1879 where Kenward (<i>b</i>. 1881), Tom (<i>b</i>. 1882), who died as a baby, Cyril (<i>b</i>. 1884), and Marjorie (<i>b</i>. 1890), who suffered from a lifelong disability, were born. Both Herbert and Kenward died young of diphtheria.<br>
<br>Barnardo increasingly viewed his fund-raising campaign as a form of ministry. Public confidence began to return, but despite the growth of the Girls' Village Home and the acquisition of more properties by gift and purchase, Barnardo saw emigration as the only way in which he could keep to his &#145;ever open door&#146; policy and meet the ever-increasing demands on the homes. In 1882 the first party of boys left for Canada, followed by a party of girls in 1883. Barnardo acquired a receiving home for girls and acquired by purchase and grant land and buildings for an industrial farm in Manitoba. Emigration became a key policy, and by 1905 more than 11,000 children had been sent overseas, mainly to Canada. Encouraged by the idea that emigration was advantageous to the child and the empire, Barnardo was supported both by the public and the state. He visited Canada five times, the last in 1900 in failing health when disquiet was already being voiced in Canada about the effects of emigration both for children and on the Canadian population.<br>
<br>In 1888 Barnardo became embroiled in a series of court cases involving three mothers, backed by the Roman Catholic church, who demanded that their children be restored to their custody. Barnardo's response was typically high-handed: two children were sent overseas and Barnardo applied to the courts to support his claim to keep the third child, arguing that what he called &#145;philanthropic abduction&#146; was justified in certain cases. Barnardo took the case to appeal, incurring much hostile public criticism. Although he did not win the case, it was during this period that the <span class="roman">Custody of Children Act</span> of 1891 was passed. Barnardo's influence can be seen in that for the first time parental rights were subordinated to the overriding consideration of the welfare of the child, the principle at the heart of his argument.<br>
<br>By the end of 1880s the committee, unable to control the dynamic and driven director, who had now added a hospital for sick children and a boarding-out scheme to his work, became so alarmed at debts amounting to nearly &pound;200,000, for which they were personally liable, that they demanded that Barnardo curtail his work. He had opened seven regional centres with the &#145;ever open door&#146; slogan, which increased the number of admissions, and although he had appointed five lecturers to share the burden of fund-raising and created the Young Helpers League, more loans and mortgages had had to be taken out.<br>
<br>Barnardo fought back, but, alienated from his committee and friends, unable to accept criticism, unable to delegate, and with his stubborn intransigence increasing his sense of isolation, he was nevertheless forced to retrench. However his passion for the cause of destitute children, his deep religious belief, and his powerful personality won him many supporters, a devoted and loyal staff, and the respect and gratitude of many of his children.<br>
<br>Barnardo was by then personally prosperous, and the family moved to a large house, Ardmore, Buckhurst Hill, Essex, before moving finally to St Leonard's Lodge, Surbiton. His appearance was described as being &#145;short and round, his complexion florid, his cheeks puffy and his eyes somewhat fierce. Even his moustache was martial&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Star</span>, 21 Sept 1905). Despite royal patronage and twice yearly packed meetings at the Albert Hall, where Barnardo was able to indulge his taste for drama and showmanship, the financial situation of the homes during the 1890s showed little improvement. In 1899 it was decided to apply for a certificate of incorporation, and to give the work a national character an impossibly clumsy title was chosen, The National Incorporated Association for the Reclamation of Destitute Waif Children, otherwise known as Dr Barnardo's Homes. The trustees, no longer personally liable, seemed to have abandoned all attempts to curb Barnardo's expansionist plans after that.<br>
<br>In response to need, more regional receiving homes, together with more orphanages, industrial homes, and homes for sick and blind children, were opened; Watts Naval Training School, the gift of E. H. Watts, trained boys for the navy and merchant service. By the time of Barnardo's death in 1905 total liabilities amounted to &pound;249,000, and in spite of a national memorial appeal it was several years before all liabilities could be met. He was not the first to send children overseas or to use the boarding-out system for small children, but his close personal attention to detail, his thoroughness, and the scale of his work made his methods an example to others. He recognized from the start that it was not enough to rescue children from destitution but essential to train them to enable them to earn a living. He fervently believed that it was an essential part of his mission to ensure that they were brought up according to protestant evangelical principles.<br>
<br>Barnardo died at his home, St Leonard's Lodge, on 19 September 1905 from a heart attack, having returned too ill to complete a further course of treatment at Nauheim in Germany, where he had been on several previous occasions. Barnardo's body lay in state at the Edinburgh Castle for three days, and was then taken through streets lined with mourners to Liverpool Street Station. From Barkingside the cort&egrave;ge went to the Girls' Village Home, and Barnardo was interred on 4 October at a spot he had chosen himself. An imposing memorial by Sir George Frampton RA marks Barnardo's tomb. He stands out as a most successful philanthropist and a social reformer. Both through his work and his writings he publicized and tried to meet the needs of destitute children long before the state actively sought to deal with the issue.<br>
