<span class="headword">Bachiler <span class="st"> [Batchiler, Bachilor]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1674), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, of parents who are unknown, was admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1632 as coming from Oxfordshire. He graduated BA in 1636 and proceeded MA in 1639. In 1642 he was appointed by the House of Commons to give a weekly lecture at Lewisham, Kent, but was obstructed by the vicar and some of the local inhabitants. Other parishioners successfully petitioned the House of Lords in 1643 to confirm his appointment. Thomas Edwards later claimed that Bachiler was &#145;no Minister&#146;  (Edwards, 1.139).<br>
<br>Under the 1643 ordinance to control printing Bachiler was appointed one of the twelve divines empowered to license books of divinity. His licence appears at the beginning of a number of works. He did not restrict himself merely to giving his assent to publication, but added his comments, as, for example, on <span class="italic">Two Treatises &hellip; Concerning Infant Baptism</span> (1645) by John Tombes, where he acknowledged that the author was a godly man &#145;and of the Presbyterian judgement, though I am not of opinion with him&#146; and he agreed to the publication of these treatises to encourage further contributions to the debate on infant baptism. Licensing <span class="italic">The Smoke in the Temple</span> (1645) by John Saltmarsh, a work advocating religious toleration, he described the book as &#145;this way of Peace and Reconciliation&#146;. It was this which incensed presbyterians and led to complaints about him in the Westminster assembly. To Thomas Edwards, Bachiler was:<blockquote>Licenser-Generall of the Sectaries Books &hellip; who hath been a Man-midwife to bring forth more monsters begotten by the Divell, and borne of the Sectaries within this three last years then ever were brought into the light in England by all the former Licensers &hellip; for four score years. (Edwards, 3.102)</blockquote>Bachiler was &#145;such a desperate Licenser&#146; that:<blockquote>if the Devill himselfe should make a book, and give it the Title, A plea for liberty of conscience &hellip; he would license it, and &hellip; set before it the commendations of <i>A usefull Treatise</i>, of <i>A Sweet and Excellent Booke</i>, making for love and peace between brethren; or some such discourse. (Edwards, 3.104&#150;5)</blockquote>Several works licensed by Bachiler were attacks on Edwards himself, including two by William Walwyn and Thomas Webbe's <span class="italic">Mr Edwards Pen No Slander</span> (1646). The latter was one of the texts which, according to Edwards, Bachiler, &#145;an Independent&#146;, had tampered with to strengthen sectarian and Independent positions against the arguments of the presbyterians  (Edwards, 2.138). Bachiler seems to have remained a licenser until 1647, when a new printing ordinance came into force. The following year he published a work of his own, <span class="italic">Golden Sands</span>, extolling the riches of free grace for the saints.<br>
<br>Between 1643 and 1645 Bachiler served in the parliamentarian army as chaplain to Colonel Valentine Walton, governor of King's Lynn. He then moved to Windsor as chaplain to Colonel Whichcote, governor of Windsor Castle. Here he encountered Charles I's young daughter Elizabeth, to whom he seems to have been some kind of chaplain and with whose virtues he was much taken. He stayed on as a civilian minister, preaching to both prisoners and garrison at Windsor, having in September 1647 become a fellow of Eton College. On 21 November 1648 he married Abigail Perwich (<i>bap</i>. 1631, <i>d</i>. 1674) at St John's, Hackney, Middlesex. In 1657 he was nominated an assistant to the Berkshire commission of ejectors. In 1658 he was appointed vicar of Datchet, Buckinghamshire, where the parishioners complained that he was an absentee, but he was exonerated by the trustees for the maintenance of preaching ministers. He lost all his positions in 1660.<br>
<br>After the Restoration, Bachiler took pains to dissociate himself from the religious radicals, subscribing both to a declaration against the Fifth Monarchist Thomas Venner in 1661, and in 1666 taking the Oxford oath, abhorring armed resistance to the king. At some point he moved to Hackney and became involved with the school kept by Mrs Perwich in the house of his father-in-law, Robert Perwich. He wrote a defence of the school and several volumes of religious queries, simple guides to religion, partly aimed against the Quakers, in the form of question and answer. He was buried in Hackney on 23 September 1674. By his will, made on 24 August and proved by his widow on 28 September, he left his estate to her, to be divided after her death (which occurred before the end of the year) between his nephews and nieces.<br>
