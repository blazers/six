<span class="headword">Boys,  Thomas Shotter</span>  (1803&#150;1874), <span class="occ">topographical watercolour painter and printmaker</span>, was born on 2 January 1803 at Pentonville, near London, the son of a salesman. He was apprenticed on 4 February 1817 to the London engraver George Cooke. His earliest recorded prints are an etching of 1823 after an antique vase in Baron Denon's collection, which he exhibited at the Society of British Artists the following year, and an engraving after Claude Lorrain's <span class="italic">Cephalus and Procris Reunited by Diana</span> (National Gallery, London). When his apprenticeship to Cooke ended in 1823 Boys moved to Paris where he soon became the prot&eacute;g&eacute; and companion of the British artist Richard Parkes Bonington. Bonington introduced Boys to a circle of influential patrons, artists, and literati which included Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix, Baron Charles Rivet, and Prosper Merim&eacute;e. Boys continued to work for Cooke, and he exhibited four reproductive engravings at the Paris Salon of 1827&#150;8, but as his friendship with Bonington intensified, his professional interests shifted from engraving to watercolour painting. It was undoubtedly from Bonington that he learned the subtleties of this technique, which he later imparted to his own pupils William Callow, Ambrose Poynter, and Edward John Poynter. Boys, in turn, may have instructed both Bonington and the French landscape painter Paul Huet in the art of etching.<br>
<br>While many of Boys's earliest watercolours tend to be copies of other artists' works, especially Bonington's popular Parisian and Italian subjects, he eventually developed an independent and original style within a few years of Bonington's death in 1828. His most enduring achievements are the hundreds of <i>plein-air</i> and finished watercolours that date to his years of residence in Paris from 1831 to 1837. By submitting many of these to public exhibitions, he contributed to the revival of watercolour painting in France. At the 1833 Salon Boys exhibited seven watercolour views of Paris, Venice, Rouen, Chester, and Salisbury Cathedral&#151;the last now at the Yale Center for British Art. His address at the time, 19 rue de Bouloy, was the same as that of Callow and the French artists Pierre-Jules Jollivet, Pierre-Toussaint-Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Mialhe, and Henri-Joseph, baron de Triqueti. The last's manuscript catalogue of Bonington's prints, preserved in the library of the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts, Paris, claims that Boys finished Bonington's only etching, <span class="italic">Bologna, the Leaning Towers</span>.<br>
<br>In 1834 Boys again exhibited at the Paris Salon three watercolour views of B&eacute;thune and Paris. During the 1830s he also mastered the art of lithography. Between 1833 and 1845 Boys was a mainstay of the <span class="italic">Picardie</span> and <span class="italic">Languedoc</span> volumes of Baron Isidore Taylor's magisterial <span class="italic">Voyages pittoresques et romantiques dans l'ancienne France</span>. He also collaborated with A. Rouargue in the publication of <span class="italic">Architecture pittoresque dessin&eacute;e d'apr&egrave;s nature</span> (1835). As early as 1830 Boys had envisioned a series of etched views of Paris to rival Thomas Girtin's <span class="italic">Picturesque Views of Paris and its Environs</span> (1803), but the project was abandoned in favour of a publication in 1839 of twenty-six chromolithographs titled <span class="italic">Picturesque Architecture in Paris, Ghent, Antwerp, Rouen, etc.</span> published by Charles Hullmandel. This series of landscape and architectural views, derived from Boys's own watercolours and produced with the technical assistance of Hullmandel, ranks as one of the most innovative ventures in the history of printmaking. It brought Boys both a modicum of international celebrity and a commendation from King Louis-Philippe. He published his lithographic <span class="italic">Series of Views in York</span> (1841) the same year he was elected a full member of the New Watercolour Society, where he exhibited annually until the year of his death. Equally successful was his publication <span class="italic">Original Views of London as It Is</span> (1842), which introduced a vivacity previously unknown in the architectural delineation of this metropolis. He was now at the apex of his powers and popularity. In 1842&#150;3 he made several excursions to Germany and to Prague in an effort to expand his repertoire of landscape subjects. He also painted a few oils at this time such as <span class="italic">Greenwich from Observatory Hill</span> (exh. Society of British Artists, 1858). Like so many of the landscape draughtsmen of his generation, Boys had modelled his style on Bonington's virtuoso handling and brilliant colouring. As his career progressed, however, he seemed incapable of changing this style to accommodate the public's increasing demand for larger, more highly detailed paintings. By 1850 Boys had spent his creative capital, and his financial fortunes began a steady and steep decline. For the last twenty years of his life he worked intermittently as a drawing master and a reproductive lithographer in London, but he died in oblivion and near poverty on 10 October 1874 at 30 Acacia Road, St John's Wood, leaving a widow, Celestine Marie Barbe Boys. It is one of the tragedies in the history of British art and printmaking that Thomas Shotter Boys was unable to sustain the great promise of his work of the 1830s.<br>
<br>Boys was prolific, and his watercolours grace most of the public collections in England. In North America, the Yale Center for British Art owns a large and representative group, while the Houghton Library, Harvard University, has many of the working drawings and tracings for <span class="italic">London as It Is</span> and <span class="italic">Picturesque Architecture in Paris, Ghent, Antwerp, Rouen, etc.</span>
