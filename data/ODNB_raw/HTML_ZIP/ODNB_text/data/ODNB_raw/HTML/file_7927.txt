<span class="headword">Douglas,  William</span>, sixth earl of Douglas, and duke of Touraine in the French nobility  (1422/3&#150;1440), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7863/', "Archibald Douglas, fifth earl of Douglas (c.1391&#150;1439)")</script>, and Euphemia Graham (<i>d</i>. 1468/9), sister of Malise Graham, earl of Menteith (<i>d</i>. 1490). Although he survived only into his eighteenth year, his career marked a crisis in the history of the Black Douglas family. His earliest appearance was in 1430 when he was knighted, along with other nobles &#145;of tender years&#146;, by James I at the baptism of the king's twin sons. Despite his youth, he may have assumed a political role during the lieutenancy of his father for the young James II between 1437 and 1439. His younger brother, David, acted as an auditor in this period, and William's marriage to Jean Lindsay (<i>d</i>. 1482&times;4), daughter of David Lindsay, third earl of Crawford (<i>d</i>. 1446), about 1437 forged an alliance with another major magnate house.<br>
<br>When Douglas succeeded his father in June 1439 he was still a minor. His tenure of the earldom of Douglas would last just seventeen months and was overshadowed by its violent end. Contemporary accounts are uninformative, but later accounts provide circumstantial details of the so-called Black Dinner, the feast in Edinburgh Castle on 24 November 1440 to which the young earl and his even younger brother were lured. The placing of a bull's head on the table by Sir William Crichton was the signal for their being seized, given the barest formality of a trial, and beheaded. The background to this act is uncertain. The near contemporary Auchinleck chronicle restricts itself to the bald facts, while later chroniclers indulge in sermons on the pride of youth. It is clear, though, that Douglas fell victim to the instability of minority politics. The men held responsible for his death were the chancellor, Sir William Crichton, and Sir Alexander Livingston, the custodian of the king. The power of these men was based on the accumulation of royal offices, and Douglas may have appeared to threaten this by reclaiming the lieutenancy of his father on the basis of his descent from Robert III. He was certainly beginning to exercise his rights as the greatest magnate in the kingdom, but this threatened the power of his great-uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7891/', "James Douglas of Balvenie, earl of Douglas and of Avondale")</script>, rather than that of Livingston and Crichton.<br>
<br>Avondale was the senior kinsman of the sixth earl and had been a major figure in royal and Black Douglas circles for decades. Following the fifth earl's death it would have been Avondale who stepped in to act as tutor, or guardian, for William. In September 1439, when William's signet was appended to the agreement between the queen mother and Livingston, Avondale represented the family on the council. The prospect of relinquishing his power to William would not have been welcome, especially as there may have been tension between the two. This is suggested by the appearance of Malcolm Fleming of Biggar (who was arrested with William and executed a day later) as William's &#145;speciall counsellor&#146; in November 1440. Avondale had killed Fleming's father in 1406 and was a local rival of the family in Lanarkshire. William's association with Fleming may have been a further reason why Avondale encouraged or accepted the attack on the earl, to which, as justiciar south of Forth, Avondale could have given an appearance of legality.<br>
<br>The involvement of Avondale and Crichton in the Black Dinner indicates flaws in the Black Douglas support by 1440. Both men had strong and well-established ties to the family, but both were prepared to see the young earl executed in pursuit of their interests. These interests were not just those of minor baronial families. Service to James I and the Douglases had allowed Crichton and Avondale to exercise power on a large scale, and in 1440 they were not prepared to withdraw into the following of a magnate lieutenant. William Douglas's death was part of the changing structure of the Scottish nobility. Avondale was certainly the main beneficiary of his kinsman's death, inheriting the earldom and the bulk of the Douglas lands. William's grandmother Margaret Stewart and sister, Margaret, retained the rights to Galloway and Bothwell, and Annandale, where Crichton had his own interests, was annexed to the crown. While the new earls of Douglas&#151;Avondale and his sons&#151;dominated Scottish politics after 1440, the Black Dinner left a powerful legacy of mistrust which affected their affairs and support.<br>
