<span class="headword">Ranulf (II)</span> <span class="st"> [Ranulf de Gernon]</span>, fourth earl of Chester  (<em>d.</em> 1153), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23127/', "Ranulf (I), third earl of Chester (d. 1129)")</script>, and his wife, Lucy of Bolingbroke (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1138). He had a half-brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24169/', "William de Roumare")</script>, Lucy's son from a previous marriage to Roger fitz Gerold, and a sister, Alice, who married Richard de Clare (<i>d</i>. 1136). Among those who witnessed his charters were Benedict &#145;brother of the earl&#146; (presumably an illegitimate son of Ranulf (I)), Foulque de Bricquessart (probably either a nephew of Ranulf (I) or another illegitimate son), and Richard Bacun, founder <i>c</i>.1143 of Rocester Abbey, Staffordshire, who described Ranulf (II) as his uncle (<i>avunculus</i>).<h2>
<a name="Successiontotheearldom"></a>Succession to the earldom</h2>On his father's death in January in 1129 Ranulf (II) succeeded to his lands and titles in England and Normandy. He had evidently attained his majority, so would probably have been born during the first decade of the twelfth century. His Norman interests lay in the Bessin (the area around Bayeux) and the Avranchin (the area around Avranches), and included the hereditary <i>vicomt&eacute;</i> of Bayeux. In England his honour as earl of Chester lay principally in the north and midlands, with the most important demesnes in north and east Cheshire (such as Eastham and Macclesfield), in Warwickshire (Coventry), Leicestershire (Barrow upon Soar), and Lincolnshire (Greetham). On or after becoming earl of Chester, Ranulf (I) had surrendered to the crown his lordship of Carlisle and most of his wife's Lincolnshire inheritance based upon Bolingbroke, none of which came later to Ranulf (II). However, about one-third of Lucy's Lincolnshire estate, largely within the soke of Belchford, had remained with Ranulf (I), was retained by Lucy until her death <i>c</i>.1138, and did subsequently pass to their son. The disposition of these holdings was clearly the subject of negotiation with Henry I, for among the accounts charged to Ranulf (II) in the 1130 pipe roll was a debt of &pound;1000 left by his father &#145;for the land of Earl Hugh [of Chester]&#146; and another debt of 500 marks for a concord over his mother's dower. Lucy herself rendered further accounts, including one of 400 marks &#145;for her father's land&#146;.<h2>
<a name="RelationswithHenryIandStephen"></a>Relations with Henry I and Stephen</h2>During the closing years of Henry I's reign Ranulf (II) was present at royal councils in Northampton (8 September 1131, when magnates were required to swear fealty to the Empress Matilda), Westminster (29 April 1132), and Windsor (Christmas 1132). Although favoured by geld pardons in 1130 in Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, Staffordshire, and Warwickshire, totalling &pound;21 4<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>., there is no sign that he enjoyed the king's familiarity as his father had done. On the other hand, his marriage (not later than 1135) to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47213/', "Matilda")</script>, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23716/', "Robert, earl of Gloucester")</script>, associated him with the party favouring the empress's succession (after his death, his widow issued a charter referring to the empress as her aunt). Despite this, in common with nearly every other Anglo-Norman magnate, he accepted King Stephen's accession, attending the royal council at Westminster at Easter (22 March) 1136 and witnessing the Oxford charter of liberties (which signalled the earl of Gloucester's submission to Stephen) in April of that year. To all appearances Ranulf remained a loyal subject until 1140, despite his father-in-law's formal defiance of the king (May 1138) and military leadership of the Angevins in England following the empress's invasion (September 1139).<br>
<br>An early test of Ranulf's allegiance came in February 1136, when Stephen granted Carlisle to Henry of Scotland in the first treaty of Durham. The terms were confirmed in a second treaty of 9 April 1139. Ranulf's resentment at the alienation of a lordship formerly held by his father explains, at least in part, his withdrawal from the royal council at Easter 1136 in protest at the elevated position enjoyed there by Henry of Scotland, and his attempt in 1140 to capture Henry and his wife on their return from Stephen's court. However, the significance of Carlisle in motivating Ranulf's behaviour should not be exaggerated. It lay far from his main territorial interests, and he seems to have played no part in the military campaigns against the Scots which reached a climax with their defeat at the battle of the Standard in August 1138. The earl of Chester's principal ambitions were focused instead on the north midlands, especially in Lincolnshire where his mother's inheritance lay.<br>
<br>Having antagonized the king through his bid to capture Henry of Scotland, Ranulf compounded his offence later in 1140 by contriving the seizure of the royal castle at Lincoln. He arrived unarmed with three knights, ostensibly to collect his wife, and the wife of William de Roumare, who had been paying a social visit. On being allowed in, they seized weapons, expelled the royal garrison, and admitted Roumare and his men. The king's response was to visit Lincolnshire, but instead of taking reprisals against the half-brothers he treated them with favour: William of Malmesbury said that he &#145;added to [their] honours&#146;  (Malmesbury, 80&#150;81), the <span class="italic">Gesta Stephani</span> that he peaceably renewed a pact with Ranulf while intending to watch whether the promises were kept. Stephen left for London before Christmas, but made a surprise return during the festival to lay siege to Lincoln Castle. Ranulf managed to escape, obtained the armed assistance of his father-in-law, Robert, earl of Gloucester, and other Angevin adherents, raised soldiers from Cheshire and Wales, and marched back to Lincoln, where his wife and half-brother were continuing to resist the siege. At the battle of Lincoln on 2 February 1141 both Stephen and Ranulf fought on foot. The king was captured, and the earl followed up his victory with sack and slaughter in the city itself.<h2>
<a name="RanulfandtheEmpressMatilda"></a>Ranulf and the Empress Matilda</h2>Although he played a leading role in the king's downfall, an event which looked set to bring the Empress Matilda to power, it seems clear that Ranulf fought primarily not on behalf of a contender for the throne, but for himself and his family. According to William of Malmesbury &#145;he seemed ambivalent in his loyalty&#146;  (Malmesbury, 82&#150;3), and promised fealty to the empress only on condition that the earl of Gloucester would help him relieve Lincoln Castle. The speeches before the battle, put into the mouths of the protagonists by Henry of Huntingdon, have Ranulf perceiving the conflict in personal terms, to avenge the wrong done to himself, in contrast to Robert of Gloucester for whom the crown was at stake. Ranulf's ambivalence over the succession dispute, and consequent distrust by both parties, was repeatedly illustrated during the years which followed. He is not known to have attested any of the empress's charters after Stephen's accession. At the siege of Winchester in September 1141 he initially joined the queen's army, only to encounter such suspicion and hostility that he switched to the empress's camp; here, according to William of Malmesbury, his arrival was &#145;late and ineffective&#146;  (ibid., 102&#150;03). His Norman castle at Bricquessart fell to the Angevins in 1142, and the castle he had taken at Lincoln withstood a siege by Stephen two years later. Although he subsequently met Stephen at Stamford (probably early in 1146, when the royalist cause was gaining ground) and apparently renewed his fealty to the king, even this reconciliation did not persist. He duly helped Stephen to capture Bedford town and besiege Wallingford Castle, but the king and the royalist magnates remained deeply suspicious of his failure to restore revenues from royal lands and castles he had seized, and thought he should give hostages to secure his good faith. He was again with the king at Northampton on 29 August 1146, but here his request that Stephen help him to campaign against the Welsh was seen as an attempted entrapment, and his refusal to give hostages or restore royal property led to his sudden arrest and imprisonment. He was released after agreeing to Stephen's terms and taking an oath not to resist the king in future, whereupon he set about trying to recover by force what he had been obliged to surrender. Subsequent campaigns led to armed confrontations with Stephen's son Eustace, and on at least two occasions, near Coventry (probably early in 1147) and Lincoln (1149), with the king himself.<h2>
<a name="ExtensionofRanulfsbasisofpower"></a>Extension of Ranulf's basis of power</h2>In the years following the battle of Lincoln Ranulf was also involved in a series of conflicts and negotiations with northern and midland barons, including Alan, earl of Richmond, William, count of Aumale, Robert Marmion, and Gilbert de Gant, who was captured in the battle and forced to marry the earl's niece Rohese de Clare. His consistent purpose was to strengthen his authority from the west coast to the east, and to this end he kept a house in Lincoln with separate household officials, refined his honorial administration especially for financial affairs, and employed a scribe as accomplished as those in royal service. A charter issued by Stephen, undated but probably attributable to the brief reconciliation of 1146, demonstrates the extent of his ambitions. He was granted royal manors in Warwickshire, Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, and Lincolnshire, the towns of Newcastle under Lyme, and Derby, land in Grimsby, and the soke of Grantham, plus the honours of William d'Aubigny Brito (Belvoir), Roger de Bully (Tickhill), and Roger de Poitou (Lancaster, although that which lay north of the Ribble was under Scottish control). He was also confirmed in his tenure of Lincoln Castle, including the right to retain &#145;Lucy's tower&#146;, a reference which hints at the hereditary claims which had underlain his seizure of the castle. Much of this may already have been encroached upon by Ranulf, and much was presumably surrendered as the price of his release following his arrest at Northampton: Lincoln, for example, was in Stephen's hands by Christmas 1146, and, despite attacks on the castle in 1147 and 1149, Ranulf failed to regain it.<br>
<br>The death of Robert, earl of Gloucester, in October 1147, followed by the retirement of the Empress Matilda to Normandy early in 1148, brought a change in the political context, and with it Ranulf's closer association with the Angevin party. There is charter evidence of a gathering at Chester of the king's principal baronial opponents, such as Roger, earl of Hereford, and Gilbert fitz Richard, earl of Hertford, some time in 1147 or 1148, and also of a visit by Ranulf during this period to the Angevin headquarters at Bristol. Most significantly, when the future Henry II (then aged sixteen) was knighted by David, king of Scots, at Carlisle on Whitsunday (22 May) 1149, Ranulf was in attendance. He did homage to King David, who granted him the honour of Lancaster (including lands north of the Ribble) in exchange for a renunciation of claims to Carlisle; it was also agreed that Ranulf's son would marry one of the daughters of Henry of Scotland. Ranulf almost certainly did homage to the future Henry II on this occasion also, for he addressed him as &#145;his lord&#146; in a charter of March 1150 at the latest. The immediate consequences of this meeting were slight: a plan to launch a combined assault on York was thwarted by Stephen's arrival, Ranulf was blamed by the king of Scots for failing to deliver his promises, and the proposed marriage never took place. But the earl of Chester had clearly made a firmer commitment to the Angevin cause than at any previous time in the civil war, and he was prepared to be a witness to Henry's charters both on this visit and on his return to England in 1153.<br>
<br>Even so, Ranulf continued to put his own interests first. Some time between 1149 and 1153 he made a formal agreement with Robert, earl of Leicester, whereby each pledged to bring only twenty knights if obliged by his liege lord to fight against the other, and generally to limit the impact of the war upon their estates. In the event, both earls joined the Angevin campaign in 1153, but Ranulf still struck a hard bargain, securing from Henry (not later than April) a charter issued at Devizes attested by ten men &#145;on the part of earl Ranulf&#146; to complement the eleven other witnesses. This made lavish grants in the north midlands, many repeating those given by Stephen probably in 1146 but also including the estates of several royalist barons which the earl was effectively being invited to seize. Among these were the holdings of William Peverel of Nottingham, who was widely believed to have been responsible for Ranulf's death, and who in 1155 was disinherited for the crime.<br>
<br>As a marcher earl, Ranulf had to cope with a resurgence of Welsh aggression. In 1136 or 1137 he led a disastrous expedition into Wales from which he was one of the few to escape alive. In 1146 raids into Tegeingl east of the River Clwyd by Owain, king of Gwynedd, prompted Ranulf's appeal to Stephen for military assistance; within days of the earl's arrest, the Welsh were invading Cheshire, and reached Nantwich before being driven out by his seneschal Robert de Montalt on 3 September. Four years later, in alliance with Madog ap Maredudd, king of Powys, he prepared an attack on Owain Gwynedd, but the enterprise collapsed after defeat at Coleshill. As this episode demonstrates, Ranulf fully appreciated the value of co-operation as well as confrontation with the Welsh princes. Cadwaladr, brother of Owain Gwynedd, was a son-in-law of Ranulf's sister Alice. He accompanied Ranulf to the battle of Lincoln, where Welsh forces figured prominently, and was welcomed to the earl's court in the late 1140s and early 1150s, when he witnessed charters as &#145;king of Wales&#146; in defiance of his brother. A Welsh prince referred to by Orderic Vitalis as Maredudd&#151;probably Cadwaladr's brother-in-law Madog ap Maredudd of Powys, but possibly Cadwaladr's son Maredudd&#151;was also with Ranulf at the battle of Lincoln.<br>
<br>Despite Ranulf's interests in Normandy, none of his charters is known to have been issued there, and the focus of his attention was clearly upon the English side of the channel. He certainly lost his Norman estates during the civil war: Bricquessart fell to the Angevins in 1142, and the lands Ranulf held from the bishop and cathedral of Bayeux featured in a charter of Robert, earl of Gloucester, in September 1146. At Devizes in 1153 the future Henry II duly restored Ranulf's &#145;Norman inheritance&#146;, interpreting this liberally to include Breuil, the castle of Vire, and other holdings once associated with his family, together with comital status and extensive lordship in the Avranchin. As with Henry's other promises to Ranulf in 1153, however, these did not survive the earl's death, and his son succeeded, in Normandy as in England, substantially to the position enjoyed at Stephen's accession.<h2>
<a name="Philanthropydeathandreputation"></a>Philanthropy, death, and reputation</h2>Ranulf founded four religious houses, an abbey for Savignac monks at Basingwerk, Flintshire, in 1131, priories for Benedictine monks and nuns at Minting, Lincolnshire, and Chester respectively (both at uncertain dates), and a priory for Augustinian canons at Trentham, Staffordshire. The last foundation, made on his deathbed in 1153, was probably the restoration of a house originally established by Hugh d'Avranches. At the end of his life he also compensated Lincoln Cathedral and the abbeys at Burton and Chester for the evils inflicted upon them, and soon after his death his widow and son made a grant to Walter, bishop of Chester, specifically for his absolution. The author of the <span class="italic">Gesta Stephani</span> suggests that he was excommunicated some time in the late 1140s, but, if so, reconciliation with the church seems apparent from a gift he made to Bordesley Abbey, Worcestershire, between 1149 and 1153, at the instigation, and in the presence, of Bishop Walter, and also from the fact that, according to later tradition, he was buried next to his father in Chester Abbey. Ranulf died on 17 December 1153 at Gresley, Derbyshire. According to the <span class="italic">Gesta Stephani</span>, the earl was given poisoned wine while a guest at the house of William Peverel. In this version, he &#145;just recovered, only because he had not drunk much&#146;, but in any event he did not survive for long. Ranulf's wife, Matilda, who in 1172 founded Repton Priory, Derbyshire, died on 29 July 1189. Their son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14059/', "Hugh of Cyfeiliog")</script>, born in 1147, succeeded him as earl of Chester, taking seisin of the lands in 1162.<br>
<br>Most contemporary verdicts upon Ranulf were unfavourable. Although Orderic Vitalis acknowledged his resourcefulness and daring, the <span class="italic">Gesta Stephani</span> criticized &#145;the cunning devices of his accustomed bad faith&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gesta Stephani</span>, 192&#150;3), and Henry of Huntingdon, through a speech supposedly by the royalist spokesman at the battle of Lincoln, called him &#145;a man of reckless daring, ready for conspiracy &hellip; panting for the impossible&#146;, prone to defeat or, at best, to Pyrrhic victories  (<span class="italic">Historia Anglorum</span>, 734&#150;5). Clearly, his strategy during the civil war was to take every opportunity to enhance his territorial position, especially in the north midlands, and such commitments as he made, either to the king or to the Angevins, were calculated to that end. Other magnates followed similar policies, but Ranulf (II) was exceptionally ruthless in pursuit of his ambitions, and accordingly he was hated by many and trusted by none.<br>
