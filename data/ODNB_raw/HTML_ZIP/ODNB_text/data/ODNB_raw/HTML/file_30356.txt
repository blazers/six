<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Aitchison,  George</span>  (1825&#150;1910), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in London on 7 November 1825, the son of George Aitchison (1792&#150;1861) and his wife, Maria Freeman. After education at Merchant Taylors' School, London (1835&#150;41), he was articled in 1841 to his father, then architect to the St Katherine Dock Company. He entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1847, graduated BA at University College, London, in 1851, and began in 1853 an architectural tour which led to his acquaintance in Rome with George Heming Mason. Mason introduced him to Frederick Leighton. After concluding the tour with William Burges, Aitchison returned to London in 1855 and four years later he was taken into partnership by his father, to whose practice and appointment he succeeded in 1861; he subsequently became joint architect to the London and St Katherine Dock Company. Aitchison's father was reputed to have designed &#145;the first incombustible building of iron and brick&#146;  (<span class="italic">RIBA Transactions</span>, 14, 1863&#150;4, 107), Irongate wharf on the Thames (<i>c</i>.1845).<br>
<br>As a young man, Aitchison himself was also much involved with wharves, warehouses, and offices along the Thames, notably the depository for Messrs Hubbock and the tobacco warehouse for Victoria Dock. But it was Leighton, his lifelong friend, who gave him the opportunity to design one of the most innovative houses of the Victorian period, Leighton's own house and studio in Holland Road, South Kensington (1864&#150;6; now Leighton House), to which the Arab Hall (1877&#150;89) was later added. Aitchison's other principal works were: the hall of the Founders' Company (1877); offices for the Royal Exchange Company, Pall Mall (1886); decorations for the apartments of the Princess Louise at Kensington Palace; the board-room of the Thames conservancy (1868), with a frieze by Leighton; and a warehouse in Mark Lane, City of London (1864), the construction of which made ingenious use of cast iron. He was examiner in architecture and the principles of ornament in the Department of Science and Art, South Kensington, and for many years district surveyor for East Wandsworth and Tooting. Aitchison was elected ARA in 1881 and RA in 1898. He acted from 1881 as lecturer, then from 1887 as professor of architecture, at the Royal Academy, a post which he resigned in 1905. From 1896 to 1899 he was president of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), and during his presidency (1898) was awarded the royal gold medal. For many years he was very much part of the inner circle of the RIBA.<br>
<br>As a lecturer and public speaker Aitchison was prolific, in particular at the RIBA and RA. His style was literary, discursive, and genial. And yet, over a period of half a century, there is in his lectures a manifest sense of doubt, even of despair. For decades he wrestled in public with the Victorian dilemma of style. Looking backwards and forwards at the same time, how could architects square art and science, utility and beauty? How could they serve two masters, history and progress? The fact that he could never quite admit that eclecticism&#151;modern materials and historic forms&#151;was indeed the Victorian style, makes him an appealing, and representative, figure.<br>
<br>Aitchison resided and worked at 150 Harley Street, London, where he died, unmarried, on 16 May 1910. He left a little over &pound;13,000. His RIBA portrait by Alma-Tadema (1900) catches the style of the man: scholarly, gregarious, and perhaps a little garrulous.<br>
