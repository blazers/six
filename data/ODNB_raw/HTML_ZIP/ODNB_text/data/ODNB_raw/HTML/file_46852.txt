<span class="headword">Creed,  Frederick George</span>  (1871&#150;1957), <span class="occ">inventor and manufacturer of telegraph equipment</span>, was born on 6 October 1871 in Mill Village, Nova Scotia, one of six sons of John R. Creed, a poor Scottish &eacute;migr&eacute;, and attended school in the village. At fourteen he became a telegraph operator, working in Canada, the USA, Peru, and Chile. In 1896 Creed married Jane (Jeannie) Russell (1868/9&#150;1945), a missionary in Chile; they had three sons and three daughters. In 1897 he moved to Glasgow, and worked for the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> until 1904. The constant laborious operation of the Morse three-key tape perforator permanently deformed his right hand, and he became convinced that he could design a more efficient system. By late 1897 he had produced a perforator utilizing a typewriter keyboard instead of three plungers to punch dots and dashes into the outgoing signal tape. He then developed a reperforator which recorded incoming signals as tape perforations, and a printer which translated the tape into letters. These machines formed his &#145;high speed automatic printing telegraph system&#146;. In 1902 the Post Office bought twelve perforators, and Creed became obsessed with winning further large orders for them. In 1906 the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> adopted the system, pronouncing it three times faster than the Morse apparatus.<br>
<br>In 1909, partly to be closer to the Post Office, Creed and his partner, Harald Bille, a talented Danish engineer who died in a train crash in 1916, moved their business from Glasgow to Croydon, near London. Orders from the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> in 1912 and the Press Association in 1920 were the company's major successes, prompting numerous sales. In 1923, responding to the American Morkrum Teletyper, Creed developed his teleprinter, which directly printed incoming signals as letters, initially working on a five-unit signalling code. In 1925 he acquired the patents for the more efficient Murray code, which became the standard signalling code. Creed's system significantly increased news transmission speeds for the newspapers and press bureaux who bought it, and telegraph rooms became known as &#145;Creed rooms&#146;. In 1928, seeking an order for the Post Office's new public telegraph system, he produced the Model 3 Tape Teleprinter, combining a transmitter with the earlier teleprinter. However, large Post Office orders came only after Creed &amp; Co. had been bought by the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation (ITT) for &pound;250,000 in 1928. Creed resigned from the board in 1931 over the use of company sports fields on Sundays, his strict religious values at odds with those of ITT's American directors.<br>
<br>Deeply devout, Creed hated smoking, abuses of the Sabbath, and particularly drink. He insisted that employees sign a pledge of abstinence, and he would sometimes visit Croydon pubs and remove any staff he found there. Over 6 feet tall, often dressed in black, he could be intimidating, but he had a genuine concern for his workforce, and personally visited sick employees. He was not a natural businessman&#151;in 1916 he expressed a wish to be relieved of financial responsibilities, and his relationships within the industry were often difficult. Following his resignation he poured resources into designs for giant catamarans and floating platforms, called &#145;seadromes&#146;, and other unsuccessful projects, which brought him close to bankruptcy in his final years. In 1947 Creed married Valerie Leopoldine Gisella Layton, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Franzky (1906&#150;1994). He died at his home, 20 Outram Road, Addiscombe, Croydon, on 11 December 1957. He was cremated at Croydon on 18 December.<br>
