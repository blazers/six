<span class="headword">Read, Sir  (Charles) Hercules</span>  (1857&#150;1929), <span class="occ">museum curator</span>, was born at Gillingham, Kent, on 6 July 1857, the third son of John Finsbury Read and his wife, Catherine, daughter of Hercules Angus, of Shetland. His father was a colour sergeant. He was apparently educated privately, and went to work at the South Kensington Museum at the age of sixteen or seventeen, but in 1874 was employed privately by A. W. Franks to act as his clerk and to assist in registering the ethnographical collections which Henry Christy had bequeathed to the British Museum in 1865. In 1880 Read was appointed assistant in the department of British and medieval antiquities and ethnography, of which he became keeper in succession to Franks in 1896. He retired in 1921.<br>
<br>Read is an enigma; good-looking and socially accomplished, he clearly had a chip on his shoulder concerning his lack of university education. He owed everything to Franks, with whom he travelled and through whom he became acquainted with many of the leading antiquaries of his day. Franks encouraged his career, made him secretary of the Society of Antiquaries in 1892, and ultimately made him the chief executor of his remarkable bequest to the museum (a difficult job, which Read took seriously). Kipling described Read as &#145;externally &hellip; very handsome, but his professional soul was black, even for that of a Curator &hellip;&#146;  (Kipling, 84&#150;5), while his obituaries hint at an uneasy manner and shallow scholarship. He was deeply resentful that he did not succeed Maunde Thompson as principal librarian of the museum in 1909 and this is perhaps the &#145;unhappiness&#146; mentioned by his obituarists. His successor, the gentle O. M. Dalton, wrote of him, &#145;he had a militant side to his nature, and what may be described as his imperfect sympathies were neither concealed nor readily abandoned&#146;  (Dalton, 529). He could be tough as an administrator, often for the right reasons, but attempts to humanize him sound stilted. One colleague, however, wrote more warmly that:<blockquote>His geniality and talent as a raconteur often enlivened the little marble-topped table round which his staff used to foregather with ritual punctuality at 4 p.m., and where the more entertaining experiences of museum life were interchanged in a social atmosphere. (Braunholtz, 112)</blockquote>Read was, in effect, the first professional ethnographer in the British Museum, in which role he must have been trained by Franks; but like all members of staff at the time he had to range very widely in covering the department's collections, from Africa to Greenland and from America to Japan. His breadth of knowledge is agreed by all; but his knowledge was not deep. He was successful in acquiring material for the museum and was one of the founders of the Friends of the British Museum (one of the elements which later fused into the National Art Collections Fund). He wrote no major book, but he contributed many articles to professional journals and encouraged his staff to publish catalogues; he also initiated the series of popular departmental guides which are still useful works of reference. Rather surprisingly he was elected to the British Academy in 1913.<br>
<br>Read was a public man and an impressive speaker; he was twice president of the Society of Antiquaries of London (his predecessor Lord Lubbock, who was chancellor of St Andrews, obtained for him an honorary degree). As was then normal his presidency of the Society of Antiquaries led to his knighthood in 1912. He was president of section H of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, twice president of the Anthropological Institute, and a member of the Burlington Fine Arts Club. He had a broad range of acquaintanceship, none perhaps more important than his friendship with the American collector J. Pierpont Morgan, with whom he occasionally travelled. It was probably through Morgan that he was offered a post&#151;reluctantly rejected&#151;in the USA. Read married on 17 August 1880 Helen May, elder daughter of Frederick George Smith of Chelsea; they had two daughters. He died after a long illness at the Grand Hotel Excelsior, New Casino, Rapallo, Italy, on 11 February 1929.<br>
