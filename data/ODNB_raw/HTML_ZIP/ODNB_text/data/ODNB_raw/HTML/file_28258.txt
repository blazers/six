<span class="headword">Vesey,  John</span>  (1638&#150;1716), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland archbishop of Tuam</span>, was born in Coleraine, co. Londonderry, on 10 March 1638, the eldest son of Thomas Vesey (<i>c</i>.1605&#150;1669?), who held several livings in co. Londonderry. His mother was a daughter of another co. Londonderry clergyman, the Revd Gervaise Walker. According to Harris he was educated at Westminster School and then at Trinity College, Dublin, although the only reference to him in the college registers relates to a doctorate in divinity conferred in 1672. Harris also records somewhat circumspectly (&#145;we are told&#146;) that Vesey was ordained by John Leslie, bishop of Raphoe, during Cromwell's lifetime, noting that this would have been before he reached the canonical age.<br>
<br>Although Thomas Vesey had continued to officiate during the interregnum, he emerged in 1660 as a leading supporter of the return of episcopacy. His son John was appointed chaplain to the Irish House of Commons in 1661, and in the same year was appointed by the crown to the livings of Ighturmurrow and Shandrum in the diocese of Cloyne. On 16 October 1662 John succeeded his father as archdeacon of Armagh; however Thomas Vesey resumed the office the following year. On 4 February 1667 the younger Vesey was collated as prebendary of Kilpeacon in the diocese of Limerick. The day before he had been presented to the deanery of Cork, where he was instituted on 4 November, and at the same time became treasurer of Cloyne. He became bishop of Limerick in 1673 (patent 11 January, consecrated 22 December), and in 1679 was promoted to the archbishopric of Tuam (patent 18 March, enthroned 16 May) and sworn of the privy council. He became warden of Galway in September 1684. In 1676 he published a life of Archbishop John Bramhall, prefixed to an edition of the archbishop's works. This included a sustained attack on Presbyterians for their rejection of the established church. Another publication, <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached at Clonmel, on Sunday the Sixteenth of September, 1683</span> (1683), attacked both Catholics and Presbyterians for their subversive doctrines.<br>
<br>In February 1689 Vesey left Ireland for England, having escaped from Tuam, by his own account, just days before the road &#145;became impassable by the multitude of skein-men and half-pike men called now Raparies&#146;  (Mant, 1.748). He took with him his wife and four children, leaving six others behind. Although he claimed to have a licence for his absence, his goods were confiscated by the Jacobite authorities. He is reported to have supported himself by a lecturership worth &pound;40 per annum, although he also drew up a list of donations, totalling some hundreds of pounds, which he received from sympathizers while in England. A sermon which he preached to the Irish in London on 23 October 1689 was subsequently published.<br>
<br>On his return to Ireland, Vesey preached before the lord lieutenant and both houses at the opening of the first Williamite parliament in Dublin, on 16 October 1692. His sermon was a careful restatement of traditional Anglican political values, insisting on the absolute necessity of civil government and the special status of monarchy &#145;as being a copy from the divine original&#146;, but also asserting the right of a people deprived of proper government &#145;immediately to apply the proper remedy, by filling the vacant throne by a free election, where they have power so to do; or peaceable submission to those who have a right without it&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Sermon Preached before his Excellency the Lord Lieutenant and the Two Houses of Parliament</span>, 1692, 12). In the reign of Queen Anne he used his control of the borough of Tuam to return two MPs for the tory party. He served as one of the lords justices between 4 February and 22 September 1713, and again between 7 February 1714 and the death of Queen Anne. Contemporaries were puzzled when in October 1713 a mob attacked Vesey's Dublin home and &#145;were for pulling the old prelate out of his house for a Whig&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Jonathan Swift</span>, 1.394). The new whig regime that took power under George I kept Vesey in office as lord justice until September 1715, leading Lord Coningsby to protest that &#145;as he was certainly the most artful and dangerous man in the last commission, so is he much more so in the present&#146;  (PRONI, D638/145). But in fact he was by this time too ill to take an active part in government.<br>
<br>Vesey was an energetic builder and improver. The private residence he erected at Hollymount in co. Mayo was visited in 1756 by John Wesley, who reported that Vesey had &#145;built a neat commodious house on a little eminence, laid out fruit and flower gardens round it, brought a river to run through them, and encompassed the whole with walks and groves of stately trees&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, 4.172). He also promoted the development of an estate village, as well as planting the surrounding area with protestant tenants and building a parish church dedicated to King Charles the martyr. Assessments of his performance as a bishop vary. In 1686 he was named as one of the many clergy forced to return to Ireland, in his case after an absence of three years, by the lord lieutenant's refusal to renew licences of absence. The reform-minded James Bonnell, in February 1692, expressed his fear that Vesey, by his &#145;smooth way&#146;, might obtain the archbishopric of Armagh: &#145;he is one of the nepotismo, and if he were primate, would perfect the ruin of the church&#146;  (CUL, Strype MS I, fol. 89<i>v</i>). His successor at Tuam, Edward Synge, wrote disparagingly of the state of the archdiocese as he inherited it  (Gilbert Library, Dublin, MS 28, 90&#150;94). Archbishop William King, likewise, criticized him for failing to honour a promise to waive his claim to a share in parochial tithes (the <i>quarta pars</i>) in exchange for being granted the wardenship of Galway  (TCD, MS 2533, 176&#150;81). A late twentieth-century assessment, however, dismisses these criticisms, pointing to Vesey's personal piety and support for charity schools, and suggesting that he should in fact be classed as a significant ecclesiastical reformer  (Hayton, 133&#150;4).<br>
<br>Vesey was married twice; his first wife was Rebecca Wilson, and his second Anne Muschamp, who survived him. His eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28259/', "Sir Thomas Vesey (1672/3&#150;1730)")</script>, was bishop of Killaloe (1713&#150;14) and of Ossory (1714&#150;30). Archbishop Vesey died at Holymount on 28 March 1716 and was buried on the estate.<br>
