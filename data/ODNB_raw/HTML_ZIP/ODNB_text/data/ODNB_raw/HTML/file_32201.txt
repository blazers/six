<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Burton, Sir  Montague Maurice</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Meshe David Osinsky]</span>  (1885&#150;1952), <span class="occ">clothing manufacturer and retailer</span>, was born on 15 August 1885 in the town of Kurkel, Kovno province, Russia (now Lithuania), the only son of Chaim Judah Osinsky (<i>b</i>. 1825), bookseller, and his wife, Rachel Elky Osinsky. Of Jewish parentage, he was raised as Meshe David Osinsky by an uncle. He entered a Kovno <i>yeshiva</i> in his early teens, with the apparent intention of becoming a rabbi, but in 1900 emigrated to England thus escaping the escalating Russian pogroms.<br>
<br>The earliest details of Burton's life in England reveal him trading from a small ready-made clothing shop at Chesterfield, Derbyshire, in 1904, using the adopted name of Morris (occasionally Maurice) Burton. A second shop was opened in 1908 at Mansfield by which time Burton, who had settled on the forenames Montague Maurice, had also acquired a small clothing factory in Leeds. In March of 1909 he married Sophia Amelia (1887&#150;1957), daughter of Maurice Marks, a Worksop furniture dealer. They set up home in Sheffield and had one daughter, Barbara, and three sons, Stanley and twins <a href="#cosubject_103477">Raymond [<i>see below</i>]</a> and Arnold.<br>
<br>In the following years Burton oversaw the rapid development of his business despite prolonged periods of ill health. Concentrating on the provision of affordable bespoke clothing for the working man, he added shops in industrial towns such as Sheffield, Manchester, and Leeds, opening a total of fourteen branches by 1914. The firm also acquired additional factory capacity in Leeds, which became the new base for the head office, and by 1917 when it adopted limited liability status the business was employing about 400 workers. Burton was exempted from military service, as a result both of his continuing poor health and of his work as a wartime contractor supplying military uniforms. Indeed, the extraordinary pressures placed on the firm by the demand for uniforms and subsequently for demobilization clothing provided a considerable stimulus to business and revealed Burton's particular ability to co-ordinate the manufacturing and retailing functions of his company.<br>
<br>On the retail side, the number of shops increased rapidly during the inter-war years from 40 in 1919 to more than 250 in 1927, reaching a pre-war peak of 595 in 1939. With the exception of &Eacute;ire (and an abortive attempt to establish the chain in Denmark), the United Kingdom remained the sole focus for retail development. The chain of shops had spread to north-east England by 1914, the first London branch was opened in 1916, and similar developments soon followed in Belfast and Dublin (<i>c</i>.1918) and Edinburgh (1922). Growth on this scale needed considerable capital and required Burton to convert his business into a public company in March 1929. The company went public as &#145;Montague Burton, The Tailor of Taste, Ltd&#146; with an authorized capital of &pound;4 million. By 1931 the level of representation in large towns throughout the United Kingdom was such that attention was turned instead to the construction of branches in smaller centres.<br>
<br>The success of the rapid and extensive shop development of the inter-war period confirmed Burton's views on the emergence of an increasingly homogeneous market for multiple bespoke clothing. More particularly, such developments also reflected his belief in the value of retail property as a business asset and his acumen in the property market. As a consequence Montague Burton Ltd entered the post-war years with a considerable and extremely valuable property portfolio which included the offices, restaurants, billiard halls, and the like which were developed above the shop space. Peacetime witnessed a slow increase in the number of Burton branches and the acquisition in 1946 of the department store retailers Peter Robinson Ltd and Stagg and Russell Ltd. The purchase of these stores in the West End of London and the subsequent development of similar outlets in Bristol, Gloucester, and Cheltenham signalled a limited expansion into women's fashion retailing but remained insignificant in comparison to the firm's traditional trade at the time of Burton's death in 1952.<br>
<br>Burton sought to maintain the symbiotic relationship between production and distribution during the inter-war years by greatly expanding productive capacity. Most significant was the acquisition and massive redevelopment of a clothing factory at Hudson Road, Leeds, which began in 1922. By 1925, nine years before completion of the final stage of development, the company could rightly claim that Hudson Road was the largest clothing factory in Europe. Employing 10,500 people at its peak, Hudson Road enabled Burton to realize his principles on industrial co-operation and employee welfare in an industry frequently vilified for the inhumane treatment of its workers. Emphasis was placed on staff welfare from the outset with the construction of a large, modern staff canteen and employee rest-room. By 1934 these had been augmented with the provision of a doctor's surgery and medical clinic, dental and ophthalmic surgeries, and a sun-ray clinic. In addition, the firm provided facilities for various sporting activities, sponsored operatic and drama societies, and encouraged the establishment of sick benefit and holiday saving clubs.<br>
<br>Similar facilities and initiatives were provided in three other new smaller clothing factories opened during the later 1930s as the company continued to expand its productive capacity in order to meet the demand emanating from the still rapidly growing chain of shops. Wartime saw the acquisition of a button factory in Kent, but most activity was concentrated on the production of as much as one-quarter of the armed services' requirement for uniforms. Further expansion of manufacturing capacity occurred during the final years of the 1940s when the relaxation of development controls permitted the construction of two new factories in Yorkshire and Lancashire. This period also witnessed backward integration into cloth production.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Montague Burton remained a committed and vocal advocate of collective bargaining and arbitration in industry, and willingly dealt with his employees' chosen representatives. He thought that low wages were a false economy, and maintained from 1921 that his employees received the highest wages in the tailoring trade in Europe. Burton also insisted on working conditions of the highest possible standard. In consequence, the company suffered only two strikes during his lifetime, the first in 1927, the second while he was abroad in 1936, and it was generally recognized for its enlightened attitude toward employee welfare. By way of contrast, however, Burton remained highly autocratic in his dealings with senior management and, like many entrepreneurial founders of large businesses, was highly reluctant to delegate responsibility. He was directly responsible for most of the major policy decisions throughout his long career as founder and subsequently chairman of the company. This control was exercised most resolutely in relation to the firm's real estate department which he ran in an almost secretive fashion from the library at his home in Kent Road, Harrogate. Burton personally co-ordinated many property transactions and dealt directly with his firm's property agents in London. He conducted his business with a &#145;steely&#146; personality and with great self-assurance.<br>
<br>The tenacity of Burton's management style stood in sharp contrast to his otherwise retiring and self-effacing personality. Noted for his private generosity, Burton was something of a loner, shunning personal publicity and limiting his own contact with people. A keen advocate of temperance, he displayed simple tastes and disliked ostentation. He claimed to live his life at 60 miles an hour, and maintained a gruelling work schedule, holding office as non-executive director of four other companies, as well as serving as vice-president of the Multiple Shops Federation.<br>
<br>Playing golf provided Burton with a regular form of relaxation, combining his passions for fresh air and exercise, and he enjoyed playing bridge with members of his family. Interested in scholarship, Burton was also a voracious reader of the classics, an occasional literary critic, a sponsor of several prizes in the arts and literature, and a member of the PEN club. He considered himself a modernist by temperament. He also wrote in some detail on topics related to his long-held interests in travel, industrial co-operation, and the international order.<br>
<br>Burton acted as chairman of the Industrial Welfare Society's delegation to the United States and Canada in 1930 and made frequent fact-finding visits to retail and manufacturing firms in North America between the wars and after. He visited Russian factory plants in 1935 and was chosen as Leeds chamber of commerce's delegate to attend the Federation of Commonwealth and British Empire Chambers of Commerce meeting at Wellington, New Zealand, in 1936. He went round the world four times in total, recording his travels between 1933 and 1936 in two volumes of published diaries entitled <span class="italic">Globe Girdling</span> (1935, 1937).<br>
<br>These diaries reveal Burton's immense pride in his Jewish ancestry and his optimism for Palestine despite the worsening international situation. A generous supporter of educational and charitable institutions there, he was particularly gratified with the success of the new Hebrew University which he endowed with fifty scholarships. An acquaintance of Chaim Weizmann and close friend of Selig Brodetsky, president of the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland from 1948, Burton also provided financial and practical support to numerous Jewish educational and charitable institutions in Britain. He was honorary life president of the Jewish congregation in Harrogate, vice-president of the Jewish Peace Society, and a popular representative of the Leeds Zionist Central Council.<br>
<br>Burton's wider concerns for international and industrial harmony were summarized in his book <span class="italic">The Middle Path</span> (1943). Reflecting many of his liberal inclinations, this book advocates arbitration in both industrial and international affairs. It builds on his long-held opinions of the need for a world federation with the power and authority to decide and implement international political decisions, and reflects on the importance of free and fair trade and industry. Burton also provided practical and financial support to initiatives designed to bolster international understanding. This included the establishment of branches of the League of Nations at his factories and the endowment of chairs of international relations at universities in Jerusalem, Oxford, Edinburgh, and London, and of lectureships at Nottingham and Leeds. Similarly, his interest in industrial relations was reflected in the establishment of chairs at the universities of Leeds, Cardiff, and Cambridge. Burton was knighted in 1931 in acknowledgement of his efforts to further industrial relations and international peace and received an honorary doctorate from the University of Leeds in 1944.<br>
<br>Although a justice of the peace in Leeds from 1924, Burton largely eschewed calls for his greater involvement in public life, declining an invitation to be lord mayor of Leeds in 1930. He preferred instead to concentrate his time and energy on his business and private interests and also expressed a wish to spend more time with his daughter and three sons, believing that the pressures of his early career had deprived him of some of the pleasures of fatherhood. None the less, Montague Burton continued to play a pivotal role in the development of the company he founded, devoting the greater part of his time to its management until his death on 21 September 1952 at the Great Northern Hotel, Leeds. A funeral was held at Harrogate synagogue, on 24 September. He was buried at Gildersome cemetery, Leeds, but in 1964 was reinterred at Stonefall Jewish cemetery, Harrogate.<br>
<br>Burton's son, <a name="cosubject_103477"></a><span class="headword">Raymond Montague Burton</span>  (1917&#150;2011), <span class="occ">businessman and philanthropist</span>, was born at 173 Chapeltown Road, Leeds, on 3 November 1917. He was educated at Clifton College, followed by Trinity College, Cambridge, and Harvard University, where he took an MBA. During the Second World War he joined the Royal Artillery, serving in India and Ceylon, and rising to the rank of major. After the war he, together with his brothers Stanley and Arnold, joined the family firm as a director. He initially took charge of the property portfolio. On 17 June 1946 he married Pamela Nancy Flatau (1917&#150;2002), whose sister, Barbara, married Arnold Burton. They had two daughters, Harriet and Jane. Following their father's death in 1952 he and his brothers agreed to take over the smaller tailoring firm of Jackson the Tailor, in order to allow Lionel Jacobson, Jackson's founder and chairman, to become chairman of Burton's.<br>
<br>In 1955 Raymond Burton moved to London to become chairman of Peter Robinson, the women's fashion store which his father had acquired in 1946, and which he expanded considerably. In 1964 he launched the Topshop brand, aimed at fashionable younger women, initially within Peter Robinson stores. He launched Topman in 1970, and the first standalone Topshop in 1974. He also oversaw the acquisition of the womenswear chains Evans in 1971 and Dorothy Perkins in 1979. He retired as joint chairman (with his brother Arnold) and president of the Burton Group (as Burton &amp; Burton had become in 1969) in 1981. The group subsequently changed its name to Arcadia in 1997 and was acquired by the entrepreneur Philip Green in 2002.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Raymond Burton devoted himself to philanthropic pursuits. Among the recipients of his philanthropy were the University of York (which named a new library for humanities research after him in 2003; a noted and discerning collector, he also donated an extensive collection of books and manuscripts relating to the history of Yorkshire), the York Civic Trust, and the Ryedale music festival. He was also chairman and president of the Jewish Museum, London, which had been founded in 1932, and which for many years was based in a single room in an office block in Bloomsbury. In 1988 he acquired a listed building in Albert Street, Camden Town, for the museum, and subsequently enabled it to triple in size by supporting the acquisition of an adjoining former piano factory; he was guest of honour at the opening of the extended premises in 2010. He was appointed CBE for his charitable work in 1995. He had homes in London and Yorkshire, and was a regular worshipper at the West London Synagogue and a vice-president of the Movement for Reform Judaism. Following the death of his first wife he married Diana Emory Stuttaford, a widow from Cape Town (daughter of Harry Emory Chubb, of the Chubb family of locksmiths and safe manufacturers) on 13 June 2005. In his younger days he was a keen rally driver, with his brother Arnold; in his eighties he drove an MG sports car. He died on 5 February 2011 and was survived by his second wife, Diana, and the two daughters of his first marriage.<br>
