<span class="headword">Pringle, Sir  Walter</span>, Lord Newhall  (1664?&#150;1736), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the second son among the nineteen children born to Sir Robert Pringle, first baronet (<i>c</i>.1630&#150;1692), of Stichill, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Sir John Hope, Lord Craighall. Thirteen children survived infancy; Thomas Pringle and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22806/', "Robert Pringle (d. 1736)")</script> were distinguished in law and politics. Walter Pringle graduated at Edinburgh in 1682 and at Leiden in 1684, and was admitted advocate on 10 December 1687. He married first in 1698 Helen, daughter of Sir John Ayton, and secondly a daughter of Johnston of Hilton, Berwickshire, with whom he had three sons: Robert, his heir, Joseph, who was a captain in the earl of Drumlanrig's regiment when he died in Holland in 1753, Walter, who was a captain in Holmes's foot when he died at Aberdeen in 1756, and a daughter, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1742), married to Andrew Handyside.<br>
<br>Although he became a leading Scottish barrister, Pringle was not made a judge until 6 June 1718, taking his seat as Lord Newhall, from the family estate of that name, and being knighted at the same time. On 24 June 1725 the hated malt tax led to an insurrection in Glasgow; the leaders were taken to Edinburgh for trial, and sentenced to whipping or transportation. Concerning this trial, the president wrote to the secretary of state:<blockquote>I find four of the Judges inclined to do all they can, and more than there is any shadow of law to warrant, to screen the criminals from justice. Those I mean are Lord Newhall, who is a Whig, and the best lawyer among them, and consequently does most harm, so far as to influence lords Polton and Pencaitland, both Whigs; the other is Lord Dun. (Pringle, 313)</blockquote>Newhall died on 14 December 1736; at his funeral, his judicial colleagues paid him the unique tribute of attending in their robes of office, while a special eulogy, written by Sir Robert Dundas of Arniston, then dean, was included in the minutes of the Faculty of Advocates. The estate of Lochton, Berwickshire, which had come to Newhall in 1726, passed to a nephew.<br>
