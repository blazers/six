<span class="headword">Price,  Harry</span>  (1881&#150;1948), <span class="occ">writer and psychical researcher</span>, was born at home on 17 January 1881 at 37 Red Lion Square, Holborn, London, the second of two children of Edward Ditcher Price (1834&#150;1906), a commercial traveller for a paper manufacturer, and his wife, Emma Randall, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Meech (1860&#150;1902). Price's father was born in Rodington, Shropshire, and the young Harry spent many of his school holidays with relatives in that area. In his autobiography he attributes his lifelong fascination with magical and occult matters to an encounter, at the age of eight, with an itinerant conjuror and purveyor of patent medicines in the market place at Shrewsbury.<br>
<br>Price was educated at the Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, Hatcham, in south-east London, and later at Goldsmiths' College, where he studied chemistry, photography, and mechanical and electrical engineering. He evinced an early flair for writing, contributing many articles to the school magazine and to local newspapers. He also carried out some early experiments in wireless communication. Upon leaving school he supported himself by a variety of jobs before joining Edward Saunders &amp; Son, the same paper-making firm as his father. On 1 August 1908 he married Constance Mary Knight (1882&#150;1976), daughter of the deceased Robert Hastings Knight, at St Mary's Church, Pulborough, Sussex. There were no children of the marriage. The Prices continued to live at Arun Bank, Pulborough, until Harry's death.<br>
<br>Price was an enthusiastic collector, and gave lectures and wrote many articles based upon his collections of old coins, tokens, Roman artefacts, and books on conjuring and psychical phenomena. In 1917 he placed about eighty artefacts of the First World War on display in the Eastbourne Home Life Exhibition; these were afterwards donated to the newly formed National War Museum (later the Imperial War Museum).<br>
<br>In 1920 Price joined the Magic Circle and the Society for Psychical Research (SPR). He was initially highly sceptical about allegedly paranormal phenomena, and used his knowledge of conjuring techniques to expose fraud. His exposure of the &#145;spirit photographer&#146; William Hope brought down upon him the wrath of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the great champion of spiritualism  (&#145;A case of fraud with the Crewe Circle&#146;, <span class="italic">Journal of the Society for Psychical Research</span>, 20, 1922, 271&#150;83). In the succeeding years Price exposed many fraudulent mediums, including the notorious Helen Duncan, the last woman to be prosecuted in England under the <span class="roman">Witchcraft Act</span> of 1735  (&#145;Regurgitation and the Duncan mediumship&#146;, <span class="italic">Bulletin of the National Laboratory of Psychical Research</span>, 1, 1931). However, after a visit to Schrenck-Notzing's laboratory in Munich in 1922, Price was convinced that there are a few phenomena which are genuine and worthy of serious scientific investigation. He spent the rest of his life trying to persuade the academic world of the truth of this conviction.<br>
<br>Price's experimental work was brilliantly conceived and executed. Essentially, he tried to obtain evidence of psychokinetic phenomena (PK) under conditions which left no scope for alternative explanations such as fraud or malobservation. His &#145;telekinetoscope&#146; was an ingenious device which required the PK force to depress an electrical contact inside a soap bubble, without bursting the latter. At some seances Price wired both the medium and the sitters into an electrical circuit so that any attempt at fraud would be immediately detected, and he made extensive use of photography, including stereoscopic photography, to register the occurrence of phenomena.<br>
<br>Many leading scientists attended these sessions and were impressed with what they saw. Price's meticulously written reports on his work with the mediums Stella Cranshaw and Rudi Schneider were widely read, and are among the great classics of psychical research. Although Price remained a member of the SPR until his death, his relationships with several of its leading members were less than cordial, and he never held any office in the society. However, he was foreign research officer to the American Society for Psychical Research from 1925 to 1931, and in 1937 he was offered an honorary doctorate from Bonn University, and the Red Cross medal, first class, from the German government if he would help to set up a department of parapsychology at Bonn. The onset of the Second World War put a stop to all such plans, and Price never received either his doctorate or his medal.<br>
<br>Price's own organization, the National Laboratory of Psychical Research, was formally opened on 1 January 1926 in a flurry of media attention. On its council were some of the world's leading parapsychologists. Lord Sands, a distinguished Scottish judge, accepted the presidency, and Price took the title of honorary director. In 1934 the management of the laboratory was transferred to a group of academics from London University (the University of London Council for Psychical Investigation), which included the psychologists Cyril Burt, J. C. Flugel, and C. A. Mace, and the popular philosopher C. E. M. Joad. This organization eventually petered out during the Second World War, the books and equipment being transferred to the care of London University. To the general public Price is best-known for his investigation of the allegedly haunted rectory at Borley, Essex, which he conducted intermittently from 1929 until his death. Although Price's conduct of this inquiry has been severely criticized, the case remains the most fully documented example of a haunting in the annals of psychical research.<br>
<br>Price died at Pulborough on 29 March 1948, and was buried in St Mary's churchyard. After his death a number of attacks were made on both his personal integrity and his conduct of psychical investigations, most notably by E. J. Dingwall, K. M. Goldney, and T. H. Hall (1956), T. H. Hall (1978), and A. Gregory (1985). Price's friends and admirers defended his good name, and for a balanced assessment the reader should compare the aforementioned writings with those of M. Coleman (1956), R. J. Hastings (1969), and Ivan Banks (1996).<br>
<br>Price remains a controversial figure in the field of parapsychology. He has been described as &#145;a man of great ability, great energy and great kindness&#146; but also as very ambitious, and suffering acutely from &#145;an ingrowing chip on his shoulder about his lack of a university degree&#146;  (Haynes, 146). He unquestionably put more time, effort, and money into psychical research than any other Englishman since the founding of the SPR and, despite his personal failings, deserves an honoured place among the ranks of those who have sought to push back the frontiers of the unknown.<br>
