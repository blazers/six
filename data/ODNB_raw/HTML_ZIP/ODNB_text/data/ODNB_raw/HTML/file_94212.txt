<span class="headword">Potter,  Donald Steele <span class="st"> [Don]</span></span>  (1902&#150;2004), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born at Parsonage House, Newington, Kent, on 21 April 1902, the eldest child of Henry Joseph Potter, a grocer's commercial traveller and later journalist, and his wife, Bessie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Matthews. He had two sisters, Norah Mary (<i>b</i>. 1904) and Dorothy (<i>b</i>. 1906). His childhood outside school was idyllic. He roamed freely, carving lumps of chalk and wood, making clay models, and drawing. His first school was the Convent of the Nativity, Sittingbourne. He attended another school after his father's business failed and the family moved to Gillingham. He found Gillingham a dismal place, but two fortuitous events reinforced rich veins in his life. The fairground behind their house with its carved animals and rope-spinning in the wild west shows opened his eyes, and in 1914 he discovered an old cello in a junk shop, for which he paid &pound;2 10<i>s</i>. in 5<i>s</i>. instalments. Around 1915 the family moved to Chingford, Essex. In 1917 he left school and went to work in a munitions factory in north London&#151;&#145;The nearest approach to prison I have ever known&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bryanston Saga</span>, summer 1982, 17). Later work at an aero-engine factory taught him valuable metalwork techniques.<br>
<br>Potter did not enjoy school, but he liked one English teacher, Josh Reynolds, who was also the leader of his wolf cub troop at Newington. After the family had moved to Chingford he joined the South Woodford Scout troop, which was often invited to spend weekends at Gilwell Park. In 1919 the Scout Association was presented with Gilwell Park as a gift and Potter attended the first wood badge (scoutmasters') course. The camp chief, Francis Gidney, invited Potter to become a permanent member of the Gilwell staff, and also gave him his first set of wood-carving tools. Lord Baden-Powell recognized Potter's talent and gave him numerous commissions, including carving wood badges and totem poles&#151;a 17 foot pole for the camp fire circle and one for each of the five dominions at the 1929 world jamboree. Later Scout commissions included the stone on Brownsea Island, Poole Harbour, commemorating the original Scout camp of 1907, and the 9 foot granite figure of Baden-Powell outside Baden-Powell House in Queen's Gate (1961).<br>
<br>In 1930 Potter left Gilwell to learn more of stone-carving. He approached Jacob Epstein, but the two failed to get on, so he applied to Eric Gill. Gill took him on for six months and he stayed for six years in a cottage near Pigotts, Gill's home-cum-studio close to High Wycombe. Gill recognized Potter's skill in wood and passed a number of his commissions on to him. While with Gill, Potter learned the skill of letter-cutting from Laurie Cribb and played chamber music with Gill, Edmund Rubbra, and Antoinette Rubbra. From 1934 he did some teaching to supplement his income&#151;first at Hampden House School, Great Missenden, and later at Oldfield School, Swanage. In 1937 he left Pigotts to set up on his own, though Gill continued to pass on commissions. In 1939 he received the first of a number of commissions from the architect Richard Twentyman, a figure of St Martin for a church in Wolverhampton.<br>
<br>Soon after the outbreak of the Second World War Oldfield School emigrated to Canada and the headmaster recommended Potter to T. F. Coade, the headmaster of Bryanston School in Dorset. He moved to Bryanston in September 1940 and remained there, teaching sculpture, pottery, and metalwork, until 1984. On 4 August 1945 he married (Victoria) Mary Broomfield (<i>b</i>. 1920), a hospital nurse and weaver. They had a daughter, Anne (<i>b</i>. 1947), and a son, Julian (<i>b</i>. 1952).<br>
<br>At Bryanston Potter's activities were legion&#151;including his beloved cello and rope-spinning (around 1920 he had seen Tex McLeod rope-spinning in a London circus, invited him to Gilwell, and became proficient enough himself to give numerous shows in Britain and on the continent), but also potholing, photography, and running the school's fire-engine. After moving to the Old Forge in Bryanston in 1960 he made almost everything that could possibly be made by hand, including the floors, stairs, and much of the furniture.<br>
<br>Throughout his time at Bryanston Potter was allowed to continue his own work, and he received many commissions. These included an inscribed oak panel for St Paul's School, London, commemorating Montgomery's planning of the invasion of Europe in the school's board room (1946); three carvings for Wolverhampton crematorium (1954); ceramic stations of the cross for St Matthew's Church, Bethnal Green (1959); a risen Christ for St Peter's School chapel, Wolverhampton (1965); three works for the English Martyrs' Church, Didcot (around 1967); and lettering to celebrate Pope John Paul II's visit to Coventry airport (1982). He worked in many materials&#151;wood first and foremost, but also stone, flint, marine ply, ivory, metal, fibreglass, and mosaic. Some of his work was clearly derived from Gill, perhaps particularly his figures and animals, but much work was completely his own.<br>
<br>In his forty-four years of teaching at Bryanston Potter inspired many pupils to embark on careers in pottery (Richard Batterham, Mike Dodd, Kit Opie), sculpture (Bryant Fedden, Quinten Hollick, Ben Platts-Mills, John Richter, Brinsley Tyrrell), art (Richard Bawden, Tim Nicholson), design (Terence Conran), and architecture (Richard Burton, Quinlan Terry). He not only carried on working after retirement in 1984, but was still developing new techniques, most notably in the 22 foot <span class="italic">Tree of Life</span> for Bryanston for which he had to gather and split all the flints (1988). Another local commission was to fill with carvings of St Nicholas and the Madonna and child two niches in the tower of the church of St Nicholas in Durweston (1992). In 1997 the Don Potter Art School was opened at Bryanston. In 2002 a centenary retrospective exhibition was held in Dorchester Museum, timed to coincide with the publication of Vivienne Light's book, <span class="italic">Don Potter, an Inspiring Century</span>. An unworldly man, he never recorded the dates of his work, never kept cheque stubs, and never read newspapers; he therefore made the task of his biographer a demanding one.<br>
<br>Known almost universally as Don, Potter was courteous, warm, and welcoming, with a great sense of fun and mischief. His and Mary's door was always open, as was his mind to new ideas. Despite his time with Eric Gill he was not conventionally religious, but he was deeply spiritual; he read widely and practised meditation throughout his adult life. Even in old age he was bright, alert, agile, and had a twinkling eye and a real zest for life. He died in Blandford Hospital, Blandford Forum, Dorset, in the very early hours of 7 June 2004, and was survived by his wife, Mary, and their two children. He was buried on 17 June.<br>
