<span class="headword">Darwin,  Bernard Richard Meirion</span>  (1876&#150;1961), <span class="occ">writer on golf</span>, was born at Downe in Kent on 7 September 1876, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32717/', "Sir Francis Darwin (1848&#150;1925)")</script>, botanist, and his first wife, Amy, daughter of Lawrence Ruck, of Pantlludw, Machynlleth, Montgomeryshire. Amy died in childbirth in 1876. Bernard was the grandson of Charles Darwin, a piece of information with which he sometimes greeted strangers, so often had he been asked his relationship to the author of <span class="italic">On the Origin of Species</span>. He was educated at Summer Fields School (Oxford), at Eton College (1889&#150;94), to which he won a scholarship, and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He played for three years in the university golf team and captained it in his third year, 1897. In the law tripos he took third-class honours in the first part (1896) and second-class honours in the second part (1897). In 1903 he was called to the bar of the Inner Temple but his heart was not in law. In 1908, a year after being engaged to contribute occasional articles to the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>, <span class="italic">Country Life</span>, and <span class="italic">The Times</span>, he began to devote himself full-time to the world of golf. It was almost as though he had deliberately turned his back on the scholarship and literary talent by which he was surrounded in his family, including two relatives, Berta Ruck and Gwen Raverat, who became established literary figures.<br>
<br>The links that were forged with Fleet Street that year endured. Darwin continued to write about golf for <span class="italic">The Times</span> until 1953 and for <span class="italic">Country Life</span> until shortly before his death. The only time his weekly article for <span class="italic">The Times</span> failed to appear was on his first visit to the United States in 1913, when the <i>Mauretania</i> containing his dispatch was held up by fog in New York harbour. War intervened between what were for Darwin two important visits to the United States. That first one in 1913 enabled him to cover for <span class="italic">The Times</span> the appearance of Harry Vardon and Edward Ray in the United States open championship. The contest resulted in victory for an unknown American youth, Francis Ouimet, a historic event since it marked the turning of the tide in the direction of American ascendancy in the game. Darwin was the only daily British correspondent present and marked the card for the winner in the three-way play-off.<br>
<br>In the First World War Darwin served in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps as a lieutenant (acting major). He spent two and a half years in Macedonia. For some time he was deputy assistant director of ordnance services for the 26th division. His second visit to the United States was in 1922, when he accompanied the British amateur team which played in the first Walker cup match against the United States. The British captain fell ill and Darwin replaced him. The match was lost but Darwin won his single. He was well qualified to fill that gap for he had just reached the semi-finals of the British amateur championship for the second time (1921 and 1909). He had also to his credit achievements which in his time ranked second in importance only to the amateur championship: eight England caps against Scotland, and victory in the <span class="italic">Golf Illustrated</span> golf vase (1919) and in the President's Putter (1924). In 1934 he received golf's greatest honour when he was elected captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club. He continued writing through the Second World War, both golf articles and fourth leaders, his supply of raw material coming from his own personal experience and from the letters of friends who wrote to him from all corners of the world. Because of the restrictions on newsprint he was never given full rein after the war, and in 1953 he retired from <span class="italic">The Times</span>. His departure was marked by a dinner given to him not by <span class="italic">The Times</span>, whose staff scarcely knew him apart from his writings, but by a host of golfing friends which included not only golfers and writers but a governor-general, members of parliament, and judges.<br>
<br>Golf has always had its eloquent apologists but nobody before had attempted to submit his or her thoughts on the subject to the glare of daily journalism. Blandly expressing ignorance of the workings of Fleet Street, Darwin succeeded in making his reports acceptable to a wide public through the milder qualities of scholarship, humour, and urbanity. When he began to write, golf reporting in the daily press was little more than a list of figures at the bottom of a column; by the time of his retirement he had turned it into a branch of literary journalism. That Darwin was something of a snob few would deny, but this seldom showed in his writings, and when it did the point was so delicately made that it was almost impossible to take offence. More important from the golfing point of view was the fact that whereas his keen, experienced eye could instantly detect a weakness he was uniformly kind to the perpetrators of it. Because he himself had suffered at the highest level, not perhaps from a lack of nerve but from an overheated temperament, he was long-suffering in print about all except bores.<br>
<br>Partisanship was the key to Darwin's outlook on life. A taste for murder trials, to which he readily confessed, may be attributed to his legal background, but what fascinated him most was the contest between the accuser and the accused, and the insight which such trials gave him into the lives of others. He was fascinated by prize-fighting to the extent of writing a book on it, and this pugnacious streak in his temperament may have accounted for his love of Dickens and his battling characters. Darwin quoted freely and without affectation from his favourite authors Stevenson, Thackeray, Hazlitt, Borrow, and Trollope, but in the case of Dickens he seemed hardly able to help himself; quotations spilled over from his abundant knowledge of and deep affection for his characters. He was an entirely suitable choice for the formidable task of writing a foreword to the <span class="italic">Oxford Dictionary of Quotations</span> (1941), and it occasioned little surprise when the citation for the CBE which he was appointed in 1937 spoke of his contribution to both literature and sport. In a thousand small ways he must have kindled in others an appreciation of the joys of good reading.<br>
<br>Darwin married in 1906 Elinor Mary (<i>d</i>. 1954), daughter of William Thomas Monsell; they had one son and two daughters. His son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31003/', "Sir Robert Vere (Robin) Darwin")</script>, became principal of the Royal College of Art (1948&#150;67) and was knighted in 1964. Darwin's wife provided the illustrations for some children's books he wrote, the first of which, <span class="italic">The Tale of Mr. Tootleoo</span>, appeared in 1926. Outside the realm of golf his writings reflected his own interests&#151;a book on the English public school (1929), another on London clubs, and another on W. G. Grace (1934). It was in his autobiographical writing that he scored most heavily. In <span class="italic">Green Memories</span> (1928), <span class="italic">Pack Clouds Away</span> (1941), and <span class="italic">The World that Fred Made</span> (1955) his style was nostalgic without becoming sentimental. It brought vividly to life the gentle pleasures of childhood and family life. Darwin died at Filsham House Nursing Home, St Leonards, Sussex, on 18 October 1961.<br>
