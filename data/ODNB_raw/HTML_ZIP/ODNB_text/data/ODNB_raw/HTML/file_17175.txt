<span class="headword">Lumley,  George</span>, third Baron Lumley  (<em>d.</em> 1507), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the eldest son and heir of Thomas, second Baron Lumley, and Margaret, daughter of Sir James Harrington. Forty years old and more at his father's death in 1485, he received licence for entry into his inheritance on 12 May 1486. Following an early visit to Newcastle, in the wake of his victory at Towton in March 1461, Edward IV entrusted the defence of Tynemouth Castle to Lumley and a garrison of forty men; even with a reduced force of twenty-four from September he managed to hold this northern fortress until 11 January 1462. On 13 November 1461 he was named a commissioner to array men in the county of Northumberland for defence against Henry VI, Margaret of Anjou, and their adherents, and the king's enemies in Scotland. Lumley also held office as sheriff of the county from November 1461 to November 1463. Significantly, in June 1464, he was excused payment of arrears arising out of his shrievalty, partly because the devastation wrought by the king's rebels and traitors had been so great that he had not been able to collect what was due, and partly because he had resisted them at great expense to himself. In the North Riding of Yorkshire he was justice of the peace from May 1461 to June 1464, a commissioner to arrest and imprison rebels there in May 1461, and, jointly with his father, became constable of Scarborough Castle on 14 December 1461.<br>
<br>Elected member of parliament for Northumberland on 23 April 1467 Lumley also served as deputy sheriff of Northumberland under John Neville, earl of Northumberland, in the later 1460s and became sheriff of Durham and Sedbergh in 1471. During the 1470s, following Edward IV's decision to entrust the rule of the north to his brother, Lumley entered the service of Richard, duke of Gloucester. In 1480&#150;81, at a time when the threat from Scotland was once more manifesting itself strongly, he became lord lieutenant of the county of Northumberland; in 1482 he took part in a major expedition into Scotland led by Richard of Gloucester; and, for his services against the Scots, he was created a knight-banneret. Although probably among the northerners who supported Richard III at the battle of Bosworth he rapidly entered the service of Henry VII, appearing on a commission as early as 25 September 1485 to array men in the northern counties in readiness for a Scottish invasion. In April 1486 he attended on the new king during his first northern progress; in 1497 he took part in an expedition against the Scots led by Thomas Howard, earl of Surrey; and when, in 1503, Henry VII's daughter Margaret married James IV of Scotland, he and his son were among those who escorted her from Darlington to the Scottish border.<br>
<br>Lumley married Elizabeth, daughter and heir of Roger Thornton, a wealthy merchant of Newcastle, and granddaughter of John, Lord Greystoke: as a result he seems to have obtained possession of estates including Ludworth and the Isle, co. Durham, and Witton, in Northumberland. Traditionally he is said to have married Elizabeth, bastard daughter of Edward IV, but there is no reliable evidence for this. Lumley died on 13 November 1507 and was buried at Chester-le-Street. Thomas Lumley, his son and heir, had predeceased him and, consequently, in his will George Lumley left his estates in trust for his grandson Richard.<br>
