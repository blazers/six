<span class="headword">Atkinson,  John Christopher</span>  (1814&#150;1900), <span class="occ">author and antiquary</span>, was born on 9 May 1814 at Goldhanger in Essex, the son of John Atkinson, curate there, and his wife, Martha, daughter of Richard Causten of Mundan Hall. He was educated at Kelvedon in Essex, and admitted as a sizar to St John's College, Cambridge, on 2 May 1834; he graduated BA in 1838. He was ordained deacon in 1841 as curate of Brockhampton in Herefordshire, and priest in 1842. He was curate in Scarborough from 1843 until, in 1847, he became domestic chaplain to William Henry Dawnay, seventh Viscount Downe, who in the same year presented him to the vicarage of Danby in the North Riding of Yorkshire, which he held until his death.<br>
<br>Atkinson was an energetic antiquary of wide interests who, in addition to his historical work, published works on folklore, ornithology, and dialect studies, as well as writing books for children. His work on local dialects formed the basis for later scholarly work, and in 1872 he embarked on a <span class="italic">History of Cleveland</span>, which remained unfinished but was reconstructed from his surviving notes and published in 1982. He turned his attention to the editing of records, especially monastic ones, and published <span class="italic">The Cartulary of Whitby Abbey</span> (2 vols., 1879), out of which grew his <span class="italic">Memorials of Old Whitby</span> (1894). He was an indefatigable editor of the <span class="italic">Quarter Sessions Records of the North Riding</span>, producing between 1884 and 1893 nine volumes covering the years from 1605 to 1818. He also excavated between 80 and 100 barrows in Cleveland.<br>
<br>Atkinson's scholarly activity was an integral part of his Christian ministry in his traditional and isolated parish, whose people, customs, and traditions he recorded in his most famous work, <span class="italic">Forty Years in a Moorland Parish</span> (1891). This remains a mine of historical information and a classic account of a rural ministry in Victorian England, and has been reprinted several times. Atkinson entered a parish in which the established church had failed to evangelize the people and where other denominations had sought to overcome their superstitions. By a combination of harmonious relations with other Christian groups, institutional and pastoral reform in the parish, and a sympathetic understanding of the lives of his parishioners, he did much to revive the fortunes of Anglicanism in the area. In 1887 he received the honorary degree of DCL from Durham University, and in 1891 he was installed in the prebend of Holme in York Minster. In 1898 he received a grant of &pound;100 a year from the civil list, which enabled him to employ a curate.<br>
<br>Atkinson was married three times: first, at Scarborough on 11 December 1849, to Jane Hill (<i>d</i>. 1860), eldest daughter of John Hill Coulson of Scarborough; second, on 1 February 1862, at Frome Selwood, to Georgina Mary, eldest daughter of Barlow Slade of North House, Frome; and third, on 28 April 1884 at Arncliffe church, to Helen Georgina, eldest daughter of Douglas Brown QC of Arncliffe Hall, Northallerton. He had thirteen children. Atkinson died on 31 March 1900 at the vicarage, Danby. Some of his papers are held at the North Yorkshire County Record Office, Northallerton, and at the Whitby Museum, where his portrait dominates the reading-room.<br>
