<span class="headword">Fripp,  George Arthur</span>  (1813&#150;1896), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was born in Bristol on 13 June 1813, the second of the six children of the Revd Samuel Charles Fripp and his wife, Mary Ann (1787&#150;1843), daughter of Nicholas Pocock, the outstanding marine artist. He attended Miss Player's Quaker school at Frenchay, Bristol; Rowland Hill's school in Birmingham; and the Revd W. Field's school in Leamington. He had lessons in oil painting from James Baker Pyne and exhibited three studies from nature and a view of Tintern Abbey at the exhibition of the new Bristol Society of Artists in 1832, giving his father's address: 14 Park Row.<br>
<br>In July 1834 Fripp set out with the Bristol artist William James M&uuml;ller on a seven-month sketching tour, visiting Belgium, travelling up the Rhine from Cologne to Schaffhausen, crossing the Alps by the Spl&uuml;gen Pass, and staying for two months in Venice before visiting Rome and Tivoli. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1838, showing a large oil of Tivoli (Bristol Museum and Art Gallery), which had been purchased by a wealthy Bristol cousin, Charles Bowles Hare; he gave a London address but may not have settled there until 1840. He exhibited intermittently at the Royal Academy until 1854, and had a notable success in 1848 with the oil <span class="italic">Mont Blanc from near Courmayeur, Val d'Aosta</span> (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), which J. M. W. Turner is said to have praised; his oils were close in manner to the work of M&uuml;ller. In 1841 he showed for the first time at the Old Watercolour Society, exhibiting seven watercolours of Bristol and continental scenes. In the same year he was elected an associate of the society, of which he became a full member in 1845; he was secretary of the society from 1848 until 1854, and relinquished the post only because of the demands of a very large family. He married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1887), daughter of Thomas William Percival, a merchant, on 26 March 1846; among his twelve children were Charles Edwin Fripp, artist&#150;reporter for <span class="italic">The Graphic</span>, and Thomas W. Fripp, a watercolour painter based in Canada.<br>
<br>Fripp quickly became well known for his watercolours, which were mostly of scenes in Wales, Yorkshire, and Essex, and of views on the Thames and in Dorset. He continued to show views in the Avon Gorge and around Bristol. His early watercolours reflect the influence of Samuel Jackson; however, from the later 1840s the crisp drawing and even colour washes of Jackson's earlier manner gave way to a softer and warmer colouring in Fripp's watercolours. They are characterized &#145;by refined delicacy and tenderness of a&euml;rial effect, by truth of colour, and by the learned breadth and scrupulous balance of their composition&#146;  (Roget, 268). A slight darkening of the paper and fading of the colours over time has sometimes reduced that delicacy to mere fastidiousness. However, since the 1980s the market value of Fripp's work has risen sharply, reflecting the success of his aspiration of maintaining the traditions and standards of the finest of the early English watercolour painters. He died on 17 October 1896 at 50 Holmdale Road, Hampstead, after a long illness, and was buried three days later in Highgate cemetery.<br>
<br>Fripp's brother <a name="cosubject_67573"></a><span class="headword">Alfred Downing Fripp</span>  (1822&#150;1895)<span class="occ"></span>, youngest of the six children, was born in Bristol and probably joined George in London in 1840, at the age of eighteen. He studied with him at the British Museum before becoming a student at the Royal Academy Schools in 1842. In 1843 he made the first of three visits to Ireland, and in the following year visited Wales. There were soon to be many watercolours of Irish and Welsh peasantry, often of one or two poor but picturesque children in a landscape setting. The more crowded and ambitious works, such as <span class="italic">The Irish Piper</span> (Bristol Museum and Art Gallery), which had been commissioned by Charles Bowles Hare, were based on innumerable diligent and delicate pencil studies and could be strongly coloured and impressively composed. In 1844 he was elected an associate of the Old Watercolour Society, and progressed quickly to full membership in 1846.<br>
<br>On 28 April 1849 Fripp married Anne Dalton Allies (<i>d</i>. 1850), daughter of Edwin Allies, a gentleman from Clifton. She died in the following year and Fripp moved soon afterwards to Rome. He stayed for periods in Naples, Capri, and Venice, and did not return to England until 1859. In Rome he shared premises with the painter George Hemming Mason and enjoyed the friendship of Frederick Leighton and Edward Poynter. When Ruskin reviewed his Italian subjects at the Old Watercolour Society in 1859 he hoped that Fripp might prove a worthy successor to John Frederick Lewis, the society's late president. However, after Fripp left Italy he returned to his Irish, Welsh, and English subjects, concentrating especially on Dorset scenery, particularly that at Lulworth. On 12 September 1861 he married Eliza Banister Roe (<i>d</i>. 1895), daughter of John Banister Roe of Blandford, Dorset, where, probably in that same year, he settled. In 1870 the Fripps and their children moved to London, following Alfred's election as secretary of the Old Watercolour Society, an office that he held with some interruptions until his death. He returned briefly to Italy in 1893 but, writing to his daughter from Rome, he complained that the city was now overrun with Americans. He died in London on 13 March 1895 at his home, 33 Hampstead Hill Gardens, from complications following influenza, and was buried at Tarrant Rushton, Blandford. His wife and younger son were too ill to attend the funeral and died, also of influenza, a few days later. Another son, Sir Alfred D. Fripp (<i>d</i>. 1930), was a surgeon, and a daughter, Elizabeth Jane Spencer Fripp (<i>d</i>. 1945), married Sir William Hale-White, physician.<br>
