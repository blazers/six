<span class="headword">Marishall,  Jean</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1765&#150;1788), <span class="occ">novelist and playwright</span>, was born in Scotland. She began writing in London, hoping to surpass typical circulating-library novels. Between her first novel and her second, a sister died, her only brother (a lieutenant) left for the East Indies with the Queen's Royal regiment of highlanders, and a stroke disabled her father from business. When Francis Noble gave only 5 guineas for <span class="italic">The History of Miss Clarinda Cathcart and Miss Fanny Renton</span>, she negotiated an unlimited number of wholesale copies for sale to friends and successfully laboured to win a dedication to the queen; sturdily independent but extremely deferential to her social superiors, she was embarrassed by the royal gift of 10 guineas. Published in October 1765 (2 vols.; new edns 1766, 1767), <span class="italic">Clarinda Cathcart</span> is a sprightly epistolary novel in the Richardson tradition. The <span class="italic">Critical Review</span> noted some plot inconsistencies but it was favourably reviewed. Despite a cavil at her occasional Scotticisms  (<span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, July 1767, 76), so was her next novel, <span class="italic">The History of Alicia Montague</span> (2 vols., 1767), which she published by subscription, a distasteful effort that cleared about 100 guineas. (It was also published, presumably pirated, in Dublin in 1767.) Despite Lord Chesterfield and Lord Lyttleton's polite praise, neither Garrick nor Coleman produced her play, <span class="italic">Sir Harry Gaylove, or, Comedy in Embryo</span>. Foote at the Edinburgh Theatre offered encouragement but not performance, so she published it with an aggrieved preface (1772): the distinguished list of nearly 800 subscribers shows vigorous Scottish support for a native writer. In London, Marishall also attempted a periodical paper; in Edinburgh she taught and boarded pupils. An epistolary novel addressed to a former pupil, <span class="italic">A series of letters, by the author of Clarinda Cathcart; Alicia Montague; and the comedy of Sir Harry Gaylove</span> (2 vols., 1789) is also her apologia. Although her name is sometimes Anglicized as Jane Marshall, the writer signs her dedication &#145;Jean Marishall&#146;. Blending precept with lively anecdote, she boldly defends her choices: her tradition of didactic fiction and its exemplar, Richardson's <span class="italic">Sir Charles Grandison</span>; the propriety of women writing; women choosing to remain unmarried where financial independence permits. Reproving her pupil's libertinism, she criticizes the morals of Chesterfield's famous letters to his son but denies ingratitude. In letters 31 and 32 Marishall brilliantly describes a determined Scotswoman's struggle to become a writer in London.<br>
