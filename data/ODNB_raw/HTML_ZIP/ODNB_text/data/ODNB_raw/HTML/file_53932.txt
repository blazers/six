<span class="headword">F&aacute;el&aacute;n Amlabar</span> <span class="st"> [Fillan the Mute, F&aacute;elch&uacute; mac Dorb&eacute;ni, St Fillan]</span>  (641/2&#150;724), <span class="occ">abbot of Iona</span>, is one of two saints commemorated under the name of Fillan in Scotland and often confused in the literature of the later middle ages; the epithet Amlabar means &#145;the Mute&#146;. His seat was at Rotterns in Perthshire and, according to later traditions, he was buried at Strathfillan and his cult is associated with the Scottish king Robert I. Although a later genealogy made this F&aacute;el&aacute;n the son of the fifth-century Irish prince &Oacute;engus, son of Nad Fra&iacute;ch, a more likely identification is with the eighth-century ecclesiastic F&aacute;elch&uacute; mac Dorb&eacute;ni (F&aacute;el&aacute;n is the diminutive of F&aacute;elch&uacute;). F&aacute;elch&uacute; was elected abbot of the monastery of Iona on 29 August 716, at the age of seventy-four; he died in 724 and his feast is celebrated on 20 June. The other saint is the Irish cleric <a name="cosubject_53932"></a><span class="headword">F&aacute;el&aacute;n</span>  (<em>fl. </em>734)<span class="occ"></span> of Cluain M&oacute;escna in Meath, whose feast is 9 January and who was buried, according to local tradition, at Kilillin in Kintail. Later traditions make him the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39265/', "St Kentigerna (Caintigern)")</script>, daughter of the Leinster king Cellach Cualann; she died in 734. Dedications to St Fillan are found throughout Scotland, from Ross to Galloway and from Argyll to Fife. Perthshire has several, especially round Loch Earn, where are found the village of St Fillan's, the hill known as Dunfillan, and the river valley of Strathfillan.<br>
<br>Two precious relics of F&aacute;el&aacute;n are treasured at Edinburgh in the museum of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. They are his crozier and his bell. Of the crozier the earliest existing record is found in an inquiry (of which the original is preserved in the Breadalbane charter room at Taymouth Castle), held before a jury at Glendochart on 2 April 1428, as to the privileges attaching to its possession by the Dewar family. The name by which the crozier was then called was the <i>coygerach</i>, or, later, the <i>quigrich</i>, a form of the Gaelic <i>coigrioch</i> (&#145;stranger, foreigner&#146;). The name demonstrates that the authority of the crozier allowed its holder to travel out of his own district in pursuit of stolen property. It next appears in letters patent of James III, dated 11 July 1487, which testify that it had been in the possession of the same family from the days of Robert I. The Dewar owner emigrated to Canada after 1795, and all trace of the crozier was lost, until in 1859 it was found in the possession of a descendant of the emigrant. He, at the age of eighty-seven, desiring that the relic should be restored to Scotland, sold it on 30 December 1876, to be kept in the museum at Edinburgh. It is of silver gilt and ornamented with filigree work; but upon examination the silver was found to form an outer case enclosing an older staff of bronze or copper.<br>
<br>The second relic is the bell (which weighs 8 lb 14 oz). It was long preserved in an ancient churchyard in Strathfillan in Perthshire, where it was regarded as possessing great curative powers, especially in cases of insanity. It was stolen by an English traveller in 1798 and taken to Hertfordshire, where it remained until 1869, when it was restored to Scotland by Alexander Forbes, bishop of Brechin. Hector Boece (<i>d</i>. 1536) has linked the saint with the winning of the battle of Bannockburn by a legend, of which he is the sole narrator: that Robert I (Robert Bruce) was accustomed to carry about with him an arm of St Fillan, set in silver, as an amulet ensuring good fortune; that the chaplain to whose care it was entrusted brought only the empty case to the field, fearing that the fortune of war might lead to the loss of the precious contents; but that the night before the battle the case was suddenly heard to open and close itself, and on examination it was found that the arm had returned to its place. Boece puts in the mouth of the king a reference to this miracle in his speech to his army before the battle. Robert I's veneration for the saint is indicated by his provision, on 26 February 1318, of an Augustinian canon to celebrate divine service in the church of St Fillan at Strathfillan. Later in the same year William, bishop of Dunkeld, promoted the church to a priory, and in 1329, shortly before his death, funds were granted by Robert for building expenses.<br>
