<span class="headword">Somerville,  William</span>, first Lord Somerville  (<em>c.</em>1400&#150;1456), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Somerville of Carnwath (<i>c</i>.1370&#150;<i>c</i>.1440), a valued servant of James I, and probably his first wife, Janet Stewart (<i>fl</i>. 1391&#150;<i>c</i>.1405). William was apparently knighted at the baptism of the future James II in October 1430. His estates lay in Lanarkshire, Roxburghshire, Stirlingshire, and Haddingtonshire. They were extensive enough for him to rank as one of the more important Scottish barons of the early fifteenth century and to justify his assumption of a peerage title, as first Lord Somerville, in mid-1445 (at the same time as a number of other prominent Scottish nobles). He was seldom at court during its domination by the Livingston faction, but after its fall in late 1449 he is normally found as a witness to crown charters. Following in his father's footsteps, Somerville served the crown briefly as justiciar in the early 1450s and also as one of the king's council or auditors of causes in parliament to whom legal disputes were referred. On 14 March 1452 he witnessed a charter issued by James II at Stirling, shortly after the killing of the eighth earl of Douglas. James II created Carnwath a free burgh of barony for him in 1451. No later than 1456 the conditions on which the Somervilles held Carnwath included that of presenting a pair of red stockings to the winner of a race from the east end of the town to the Cawlo Cross. The eccentric, but detailed, late seventeenth-century family account <span class="italic">Memorie of the Somervilles</span> asserts that Somerville married Janet, daughter of Sir John Mowat of Stenhouse, <i>c</i>.1428, though a contemporary source shows that in 1438 he was married to Elizabeth (surname unknown). The <span class="italic">Memorie</span> also states that he died at Cowthally, his principal castle, of a surfeit of fruit on 20 August 1456; the service of his heir, however, has the date of death as 3 July 1456. He was apparently buried in the college aisle of Carnwath church, as was Janet on her death about two years later. They had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Their eldest son, <a name="cosubject_54323"></a><span class="headword">John Somerville</span>, second Lord Somerville  (<em>c.</em>1430&#150;1491)<span class="occ"></span>, fought among the successful Scottish forces against the English at the battle of Sark on 23 October 1449. He was seldom at court after he succeeded his father, but he took part in the abduction of the young James III from Linlithgow to Edinburgh on 9 July 1466, for which he, Robert, Lord Boyd (<i>d</i>. 1482), and others were pardoned later that year. He regularly attended parliament, served occasionally on the king's council or as an auditor of causes, like his father, and was himself a frequent litigant there. He married first Helen, daughter of Sir Adam Hepburn of Hailes, on 10 July 1446. They had probably two daughters and a son, William, who married Marjory Montgomery, sister of Hugh Montgomery, earl of Eglinton; William predeceased his father in 1491, and his sons John and Hugh succeeded as third and fourth lords Somerville. The second Lord Somerville married again in March 1456, and he and his second wife, Marion (<i>fl</i>. 1456&#150;1506), daughter of Sir William Baillie of Lamington, had at least one son and two daughters. Somerville had one further daughter, but it is not known whether Helen or Marion was her mother. He died in November 1491 and was also buried at Carnwath. Marion outlived him and about 1496 married John Ross, first Lord Ross of Hawkhead, from whom she obtained a divorce; she was still alive in January 1506.<br>
