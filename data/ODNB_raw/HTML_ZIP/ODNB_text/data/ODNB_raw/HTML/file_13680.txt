<span class="headword">Hood,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1556, <em>d.</em> 1620), <span class="occ">mathematician and physician</span>, was baptized at St Leonard Eastcheap on 23 June 1556, the son of Thomas Hood, a Merchant Taylor. He entered the Merchant Taylors' School on 7 November 1567 and matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, in November 1573. Having gained his BA in 1577&#150;8 he was elected fellow of the college and completed his MA in 1581. Four years later the university granted him a licence to practise medicine.<br>
<br>In the aftermath of the Spanish armada of 1588, concern for a greater knowledge of the mathematical sciences among military officers and naval commanders was voiced by members of the privy council. In consequence, Sir Thomas Smith and Lord Lumley instituted a mathematical lectureship in London, and Hood was invited to become &#145;Mathematical Lecturer to the City of London&#146;. He gave his first lecture on 4 November 1588 in Smith's House, Gracechurch Street. This lecture was published within the next few months: it listed the reasons for establishing the lectureship and spoke of the importance of the mathematical sciences to people in all walks of life. It included a brief history of mathematics from Adam to contemporary scholars. Hood was particularly anxious to stress the centrality of mathematical principles to all parts of creation. Later lectures took place in the Staplers' Chapel in Leadenhall Street, where copies of Hood's textbooks were made available to students. Judging from the title-pages, his lectures ceased at some point in 1592.<br>
<br>At this time Hood was living in Abchurch Lane, but he later moved to a house in the Minories. He continued to teach privately, but turned his attention increasingly to navigational problems and to designing new instruments as aids for navigators and surveyors. He applied for a licence to practise medicine in London from the Royal College of Physicians, but this was denied him owing to his having an insufficient knowledge of Galen. The college finally granted him a conditional licence on 5 August 1597. At some time after this Hood moved to Worcester and established a medical practice. He also had a residence at the nearby village of Shrawley. Hood was married; his wife's name was Frances. He died at Worcester in March or April 1620.<br>
<br>Hood's works demonstrate both his wide range of interests and his skill as a teacher. He wrote two texts concerning globes, which were just beginning to become widely available: <span class="italic">The Use of the Celestial Globe in Plano, Set Foorth in Two Hemispheres</span> (1590) was largely intended to help the student astronomer to recognize the stars and their constellations; <span class="italic">The Use of Both the Globes Celestiall and Terrestriall</span> (1592) supplied definitions and applications for both astronomy and geography. Parts of his writing on the myths associated with the constellations were published more than sixty years later as &#145;Ancient poeticall stories of the starres&#146; in Joseph Moxon's <span class="italic">Tutor to Astronomie</span> (1659).<br>
<br>There were also two books on the use of instruments which he had designed, <span class="italic">The Use of the Jacobs Staffe</span> (1590, republished in 1596 as <span class="italic">Two Mathematicall Instruments, the Crosse-Staffe and the Jacobs Staffe</span>) and <span class="italic">The Making and Use of the Geometricall Instrument called a Sector</span> (1598). The latter marked the appearance in England of this type of instrument, which was to be popularized by Edmund Gunter twenty years later.<br>
<br>Most of Hood's original writing was set in the form of a dialogue between master and scholar. He showed himself able to bring a clarity of expression to complicated topics and the diagrams in his final book, <span class="italic">The Making and Use of the &hellip; Sector</span>, allowed a straightforward presentation of an instrument whose uses cannot easily be explained by the written word. He also did much work as an editor. He produced <span class="italic">Elements of Geometry</span> (1590), a translation of the work by Peter Ramus, and the <span class="italic">Arithmetic</span> (1596) of an obscure Swiss mathematician, Urstisius. His interest in navigation led him to prepare a new version of William Bourne's <span class="italic">A Regiment for the Sea</span> (1592), subsequently reissued twice.<br>
