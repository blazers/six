<span class="headword">Markham, Sir  Griffin</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1565, <em>d.</em> in or after 1644), <span class="occ">army officer and conspirator</span>, was the eldest son of Thomas Markham (1530&#150;1607) of Ollerton, Nottinghamshire, and his wife, Mary Griffin (1540&#150;<i>c</i>.1633), only daughter and heir of Ryce Griffin of Braybrooke and Dingley, Northamptonshire. Thomas Markham was prominent in county society and served as standard bearer in the gentlemen pensioners. Griffin, who seems to have become a Roman Catholic early in life at the prompting of his mother, fought as a volunteer in the Low Countries and France. He was one of those knighted before Rouen by the earl of Essex in 1591, and he was present at the siege of Groningen in 1594.<br>
<br>Having been imprisoned briefly in the Gatehouse prison, London, during 1596, for reasons still obscure, Markham participated in Essex's expedition to Ireland in 1599, holding a cavalry command in Connaught. As a soldier he was well regarded&#151;his cousin Sir John Harington acknowledged him versed in both the theoretical and practical aspects of warfare. By 1603, however, Markham was heavily in debt, frustrated in his suit for the reversion of the keeperships of Bestwood and Clipstone parks, held for life by his father, and convinced that he had been opposed at every turn by the Jesuit faction among the English Catholics. He had by this point alienated many influential county neighbours&#151;the earls of Rutland and Shrewsbury among them&#151;and as early as 1601 was complaining to Robert Cecil about his lack of preferment in Ireland. He had high hopes of better days under James I, but despite some fair promises made to Markham during his journey south to London in April 1603, the king granted the reversion of Bestwood to the earl of Rutland on 9 June. Dismayed and angry, Markham sought a means of revenge. Collaborating with the unstable appellant priest William Watson, and with Lord Cobham's ambitious younger brother, George Brooke, he hatched a plot by which sympathetic Catholics would foregather secretly, surprise the court at Greenwich on midsummer night, kidnap the as yet uncrowned King James, and hold him prisoner in the Tower of London. The monarch once in their hands, they would demand a pardon, toleration of their religion guaranteed by hostages and strongholds across England, and the removal of counsellors identified with Elizabethan persecution. Both Markham and Brooke, in their subsequent confessions, recalled detailed and precise military planning, involving an inescapable degree of bloodshed:<blockquote>Brooke confesseth that the time of the surprise was by Markhams appointment to be on midsomer night both for the execucion and the concealinge of the companies as they came scattred &hellip; that Marcam affirmed to him that he had given a plott of Greenewich Howse to Copley. (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 205, fol. 120)</blockquote>He solicited support from his brothers, the twins Charles and Thomas, but like so many others they were at best noncommittal.<br>
<br>For all the plotters' lengthy discussions about the offices they would hold in their remodelled England, the fantasy was exploded when their hoped-for army failed to materialize. In the new, uncertain politics of Jacobean England, very few Catholics were prepared to commit treason in support of men like Watson or Markham. The plot, known as the Bye in contrast to the Main, a parallel treason involving Cobham and Sir Walter Ralegh, was swiftly betrayed, both to the Jesuits and to the crown.<br>
<br>Markham fled, and a proclamation was issued for his arrest, describing him as a man with a &#145;large broad face, of a bleake complexion, a bigge nose, one of his hands is maimed by an hurt in his arme received by the shot of a Bullet&#146;  (J. F. Larkin and P. L. Hughes, eds., <span class="italic">Stuart Royal Proclamations</span>, 1973, 1.43). He was soon arrested, and was committed to the Tower of London on 23 July 1603. Although no complete record of his examinations survives it is clear that he was questioned repeatedly, and that, like Watson, he made a full confession. At his trial in Winchester on 15 November he was inevitably (and correctly) found guilty. However, it is possible that his dignified carriage that day&#151;one observer states that Markham made &#145;many men sory for him, and my Lord Cecill weepe aboundantly&#146;  (BL, Egerton MS 2877, fol. 175<i>v</i>)&#151;and perhaps his fellow conspirator William Clarke's assertion that Markham had been &#145;over scrupulous&#146; in respect of shedding blood  (TNA: PRO, SP 14/3/29), swayed the king towards mercy. Like lords Grey and Cobham he was brought to the scaffold on 9 December, only to have the death sentence commuted by royal command. On 19 January Markham was moved to the Fleet prison, and he was exiled shortly afterwards. But he was never pardoned. His lands in Nottinghamshire and Essex were granted to Sir John Harington in June 1604.<br>
<br>For the next forty years Markham wandered the continent, seeking employment as a soldier, and attaching himself to the courts of various German princes. Several of his letters survive in English archives, proof of persistent attempts to clear his name. In or before 1595 he had married Anne, daughter of Peter Roos of Laxton. Her husband banished, Anne contracted a bigamous marriage with her manservant, James Sanford. This irregularity was soon common knowledge, and she was forced to perform penance at Paul's Cross in November 1617. Sir Griffin is last glimpsed in Vienna, in the spring of 1644, expressing regret that old age now prevents him fighting for his king. It has been argued by some that his rapid exile was a considered move by the privy council, keen to infiltrate English Catholic forces engaged in the Low Countries. While this might be a possible interpretation of the far from complete evidence, Markham's efforts to secure information may have been taken on his own initiative, keen as he was to recover ground irredeemably lost.<br>
