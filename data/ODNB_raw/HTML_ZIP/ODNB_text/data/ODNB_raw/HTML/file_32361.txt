<span class="headword">Channell, Sir  Arthur Moseley</span>  (1838&#150;1928), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in London on 13 November 1838, the only son to survive infancy of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5112/', "Sir William Fry Channell (1804&#150;1873)")</script>, baron of the exchequer, and his wife, Martha, daughter of Richard Moseley, of Champion Hill, Camberwell, Surrey. He was educated at Harrow School before going on as a scholar to Trinity College, Cambridge. He won the Colquhoun sculls in 1860 and the university pair oars in 1861 when he was in the first Trinity crew which competed successfully at Henley for the Grand Challenge Cup and ladies' plate. In the same year, he was twenty-sixth wrangler and obtained a second class in the classical tripos. He was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1863 and joined the south-eastern circuit. Before and after he was called, his father would make him listen to the cases in his court and draft judgments, which the baron would criticize and revise.<br>
<br>In 1865 Channell married Beatrice Ernestine (<i>d</i>. 1871), daughter of Captain Alexander Wadham Wyndham of Blandford, Dorset; they had a son and two daughters. After her death, in 1877 he married Constance Helena, daughter of Walter Blackett Trevelyan, barrister of Hendon; they had four sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Channell specialized in local government work, where his intellect, industry, and common sense fitted him to thread his way through the tangle of statute and case law. His progress, however, was not rapid. He was unassuming and shy, and had no flair for sensational advocacy. But he gradually acquired a substantial practice, and in 1885 became queen's counsel. In 1888 he was appointed recorder of Rochester, an office which he held until 1897.<br>
<br>In 1897 Channell, then fifty-eight, was appointed a judge of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice and was knighted. He proved an admirable judge&#151;able, dignified, and patient, with a pleasantly astringent wit when needed. His summing-up to juries gave necessary guidance without forcing his own views on them. He tried Richard Archer Prince for the murder of the actor William Terriss in 1898, the jury finding Prince guilty but insane. In 1906 he tried the Great Yarmouth election petition case. Channell differed from his colleague, Sir William Grantham, whose judgment was debated in the House of Commons. Channell also tried the well-known libel action of <i>Jones v. Hulton</i>. Channell's direction to the jury was upheld by the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords. Among other noteworthy decisions were <i>Dulaney v. Merry &amp; Son</i> (1901), on &#145;conflict of laws&#146;; <i>Torkington v. Magee</i> (1902), involving the assignment of choses in action; <i>Compania Naviera Vasconzada v. Churchill and Sim</i> (1905), involving the legal effect of statements in a bill of lading relating to the condition of the merchandise when shipped; <i>Oppenheimer v. Attenborough &amp; Son</i> (1906), involving the authority of mercantile agents to pledge goods; <i>Andersen v. Marten</i> (1907), a case arising out of the Russo-Japanese War, in which Channell held that a ship which is captured and afterwards condemned by a prize court, but wrecked between capture and condemnation, is lost by capture and not by &#145;perils of the sea&#146;; and <i>Carleton Illustrators v. Coleman &amp; Co. Ltd</i> (1910), concerning the right of an artist to prevent the owner of the copyright from altering his work.<br>
<br>In 1914 Channell retired from the bench and became a member of the privy council. During and after the First World War he was a member of the judicial committee in prize-court appeals (1916&#150;21), where his own experience as an amateur yachtsman and yacht-owner since 1876 doubtless assisted him in his masterly discussion of the nautical questions involved in the case of the <i>Ophelia</i> (1917), an appeal from the prize court in which the issue was whether the vessel was a genuine hospital ship or was really engaged in signalling to German submarines. In 1921, when retired judges were asked to help reduce case arrears in the King's Bench Division, Channell, then eighty-three, sat for a few weeks. As late as 1927 he sat in the privy council to hear the last prize appeal arising out of the war. He retired to Hillside, Falmouth, Cornwall, and died at Rathgowry, Falmouth, on 4 October 1928.<br>
