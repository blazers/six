<span class="headword">Macalpine,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1557), <span class="occ">Dominican friar and protestant reformer</span>, also known as John Machabeus, was born in Scotland of well-to-do parents according to John Bale. After studying at the University of Cologne he was licensed as BTh by the Dominican order in 1525. At Cologne he had been a classmate of John McDowell and possibly Henry Balnaves. Macalpine served as prior of the Dominican convent at Perth from 1532 to 1534. By August in the latter year he had adopted protestant tenets, and was cited with others to appear at Holyrood by James Hay, bishop of Ross, acting as a commissioner for Archbishop James Beaton of St Andrews. Instead of complying Macalpine fled to England, prompting the tribunal to condemn him in his absence. In England Macalpine was befriended by Nicholas Shaxton, the evangelical bishop of Salisbury, whose chaplain he had become by May 1535, and who on 12 July 1538 collated him to the prebend of Bishopstone in Salisbury Cathedral. Macalpine married Agnes Matthewson (or Macheson), another Scottish exile, whose sister Elizabeth wed Miles Coverdale about 1540.<br>
<br>By 1540 Macalpine had left England for Saxony, where he matriculated at the University of Wittenberg and associated closely with Philip Melanchthon. With Luther presiding, Macalpine engaged in a scholastic disputation at Wittenberg in 1541. Inclined toward the humanists, Macalpine (who Latinized his own name as Machabeus) was widely read in patristics and scholastics as well as in canon law and the proceedings of church councils. After receiving his DTh degree at Wittenberg, in 1542 Macalpine became professor of theology at the University of Copenhagen, which he served as chancellor in 1544 and 1549, and also chaplain to King Christian III (<i>r</i>. 1534&#150;59). At Copenhagen, Macalpine initiated the Melanchthonian tradition in Danish theology which reached its zenith in his younger contemporary Niels Hemmingsen. Macalpine also found time to assist Scottish students who came to Denmark, including James Erskine of Dun, whose tutor Richard Melville of Baldovie brought Erskine to Copenhagen to study with Macalpine. The latter maintained his contacts with Melanchthon, recommending one James (possibly James Balfour, who would soon join John Knox), to both Melanchthon and Alesius. After Sir David Lindsay visited Macalpine at Copenhagen in 1548, the latter reportedly provided funds for the publication of Lindsay's <span class="italic">Ane Dialog Betuix Experience and ane Courteour</span> (1553); the claim is made on the title-page, but is probably spurious. While visiting Denmark as an ambassador in the spring of 1550, the earl of Rothes took some documents to Macalpine. The same year saw the publication of a folio edition of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in Danish, translated from Luther's German version, a project to which Macalpine contributed.<br>
<br>Although Macalpine was a Lutheran, his outlook toward Calvinists was eirenic. This was evident in 1553 when John a Lasco brought a group of Calvinist exiles to Denmark in search of refuge, only to be denied. Whereas Peder Palladius, superintendent of Zealand, opposed their request for asylum, Macalpine refused to follow suit. The following year Macalpine twice prevailed on Christian III to intervene with Mary Tudor on behalf of Coverdale, whom she finally permitted to go into exile in February 1555. Macalpine wrote a commentary on <span class="roman">Deuteronomy</span>, which was published posthumously, and a treatise, <span class="italic">De conjugio sacerdotum</span>, which Archbishop Matthew Parker subsequently bequeathed to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Following Macalpine's death in Copenhagen on 5 December 1557, his body was buried there, in Our Lady's Church, with Christian III in attendance at the funeral. Macalpine's son, Christian Machabaeus (1541&#150;1598), a professor at Copenhagen from 1565 to 1567 and a friend of Hemmingsen, went on two embassies to Russia and was ennobled in 1580.<br>
