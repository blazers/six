<span class="headword">Lul</span> <span class="st"> [St Lul, Lullus]</span>  (<em>c.</em>710&#150;786), <span class="occ">archbishop of Mainz</span>, was born in Wessex, probably about 710, and entered the abbey of Malmesbury, apparently at a young age. In 738, while in Rome on a pilgrimage, Lul encountered his fellow countryman Boniface, who was then, on his third visit to the city, appointed papal legate in Germany. Lul was one of those whom Boniface persuaded to accompany him back to his mission field east of the Rhine. The prominence which he quickly achieved in the mission, and his closeness to Boniface, are evident from his correspondence, some of which survives among that of his master in three ninth-century, and a number of later medieval, copies. These letters show Lul near the centre of a network of English clerics that covered both those who accompanied Boniface on his continental mission, including Burchard, later bishop of W&uuml;rzburg, and their acquaintances and supporters in England. Prominent among the latter, at least during the earlier part of Lul's career, were a number of abbesses: Lul asked that they support him through their prayers. This notion of confraternity through prayer was one of the English mission's significant contributions to continental religious life. The surviving correspondence reveals that Lul had become a deacon by 745&#150;6, an archdeacon by 746&#150;7, and was employed by Boniface to take letters to Rome. In 752 Boniface made Lul one of two <i>chorepiscopi</i> (assistant bishops) to help him in his efforts to mould a diocesan organization in Germany. Shortly afterwards he wrote to Fulrad, the abbot of St Denis and one of the most influential figures at the court of the new Frankish king, Pippin III, asking that Lul be his successor.<br>
<br>On Boniface's death in 754, Lul duly succeeded to the bishopric of Mainz. He did not, however, also acquire the metropolitan status that Pope Gregory III (<i>r</i>. 731&#150;41) had granted to Boniface. Nevertheless, there are signs that Lul was considered pre-eminent among the bishops of the Anglo-Saxon mission. From the time of his accession onwards, he was in correspondence with the leading members of the English church, including two archbishops of Canterbury and one of York, in a network of mutual support animated by prayer and the exchange of gifts. Furthermore, it was to Lul that King Alchred of Northumbria wrote in 773, asking that he lend his aid to the legates that the king had sent to Charlemagne and confirming his spiritual confraternity with Lul. Other English correspondents of Lul included King Eardwulf of Kent and King Cynewulf of Wessex; the extent of his influence in his native land is also amply demonstrated by his excommunication of the English abbess Switha. On the continent, Lul's advice on the administration of family monasteries and on questions of marriage law was sought by the Frankish bishop Megingoz, who had succeeded Burchard at W&uuml;rzburg. The limit to Lul's episcopal power is evident from his failure to end the privilege of direct jurisdiction from Rome that Boniface's foundation of Fulda had enjoyed since 751. Between 769 and 775, however, Lul established his own foundations at Hersfeld in Hesse and Bleidenstadt in Nassau. He was also able to incorporate into his diocese the short-lived missionary bishoprics of Buraburg and Erfurt.<br>
<br>His correspondence reveals Lul as a pivotal figure in the dissemination of Anglo-Saxon learning on the continent. He wrote requesting the works of Aldhelm, and sent presents to the tomb of Bede at Jarrow, in return for which Abbot Cuthbert dispatched copies of Bede's prose and verse lives of St Cuthbert: he would, he said, have provided more had not the cold of winter hampered the hand of the scribe. Lul had, in any case, also acquired a copy of Bede's <span class="italic">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</span>. The list of that author's other works which it contains prompted Lul to send further requests to Abbot Cuthbert and to Archbishop &AElig;lberht of York: a copy of Bede's <span class="italic">De templo</span>, at least, was forthcoming. Lul had himself been taught metrics by Boniface in Rome and before he became bishop he sent a specimen of his efforts to an abbess and a nun in England. Later he wrote to Milred, bishop of Worcester, asking for a book of the egregiously florid picture poems of Optatianus Porfyrius (<i>fl</i>. 325&#150;333), which, however, Milred could not send, because it had not been returned by Cuthbert, archbishop of Canterbury.<br>
<br>Apart from his letters, with their included snatches of poetry, the only other work of Lul to survive is his profession of faith. This he made <i>c</i>.780, when Pope Hadrian I (<i>r</i>. 772&#150;95), prompted by Charlemagne's desire to complete Boniface's work of diocesan organization, ordered an examination by the bishops of Rheims, Trier, and (perhaps) Tarentaise of Lul's consecration. On the basis of the resulting profession, Hadrian granted Lul the pallium, indicating metropolitan status, probably in the following year.<br>
<br>Lul died on 16 October 786 and was buried at Hersfeld. His epitaph survives in the same manuscript as his profession of faith. Lampert of Hersfeld wrote a life of Lul <i>c</i>.1070 which adds nothing to historical knowledge of him. His cult never took hold in his native England, but there are many dedications to him in Germany.<br>
