<span class="headword">Lyon,  Patrick</span>, third earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne  (1643?&#150;1695), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was probably born on 29 May 1643 (possibly 1642), the only son of John Lyon, second earl of Kinghorne (1596&#150;1647?), and his second wife, Lady Elizabeth Maule (<i>d</i>. 1659), only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18368/', "Patrick Maule, first earl of Panmure (1585&#150;1661)")</script>. He succeeded to the title of earl of Kinghorne at the age of four on the death of his father on 12 May 1647 (sometimes given as 1646). The late earl had spent a fortune engaging the covenanters' cause under Montrose; despite an act of parliament passed in his favour on 27 March 1647, this expense and a fine of &pound;1000 imposed in 1654 by the <span class="roman">Act of Grace</span> left the estate in serious financial trouble. The earl's widow had married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16804/', "George Livingston, third earl of Linlithgow")</script>, on 30 July 1650, and this eventually brought even greater difficulties. Nine years later, on the death of Lady Elizabeth, Linlithgow brought successful claims against the estate, which reduced Kinghorne to relative poverty.<br>
<br>The loss of so much seems to have galvanized Kinghorne into regaining his family's position. Having completed his studies at the University of St Andrews, the young earl returned to his estate in 1660 and took stock. What he found were two large, empty houses whose entire contents had been sold off to satisfy creditors, chiefly the earl of Linlithgow. What could not be carried off was burdened with debt. Embarking on a strict regime of household control, Kinghorne paid off his father's debts within seven years. On 23 August 1662 he married Lady Helen Middleton (<i>d</i>. 1708), second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18674/', "John Middleton, first earl of Middleton (c.1608&#150;1674)")</script>; Archbishop James Sharp performed the wedding ceremony in Holyrood Abbey. The couple moved into Castle Lyon (later known as Castle Huntly) in the Carse of Gowrie, and the earl quickly followed the current trend among the nobility for domestic modernization.<br>
<br>A spectacular example of the craze for &#145;reforming&#146; old houses was later provided in the rebuilding of Castle Glamis, to which the earl was able to move in 1670. From the mid-1670s Kinghorne was an ally of John Maitland, duke of Lauderdale, and, like him, was typical of the royalist aristocracy in his apparently conflicting emotions about his castellated home. These emotions are expressed in his <span class="italic">Book of Record</span>, together with careful details of the extensive building operations which employed him until 1689. On the one hand, he insisted &#145;that everie man who hes such houses would reform them, for who can delight to live in his house as in a prisone&#146;  (Lyon, earl of Strathmore, 33). Indeed, there was &#145;no man more against these old fashions of tours and castles than I am&#146;  (ibid., 19). Yet he was &#145;inflam'd stronglie with a great desyre to continue the memorie of my familie&#146; by retaining &#145;my old Great Hall, which is a room that I ever loved&#146;. His solution involved reorientating and extending the castle into a symmetrical V-plan, by adding a new western wing: both wings were given gables and the roofs were heightened to enhance an already &#145;romantic&#146; profile. An entrance was set at the centre, and a new diagonally aligned series of courts was created. A quite ordinary tower house was thereby transformed into a composition of overpowering baroque dynamism&#151;a startling and (for Scotland) unprecedented solution. Of his design the earl wrote that &#145;tho it be an old house and consequentlie was the more difficult to reduce the place to any uniformitie yet I did covet extremely to order my building so that my frontispiece might have a resemblance on both syds&#146;  (ibid., 41). Internally, a new great apartment was formed in the expanded shell of the castle, and the &#145;old Great Hall&#146; was converted into a drawing-room. Kinghorne designed the whole scheme himself, having decided not to &#145;call in &hellip; Public Architecturs&#146;  (ibid., 42). He was the last of the great self-taught noble architects, and his house is a fascinating expression of his character, romantic yet practical. A magnificent portrait (1683) by Jacob de Witt of the earl and his family reveals as much as any written account could. The luxuriantly wigged earl is pictured in Roman dress within a severely classical setting. His children are gathered round, with sleek hunting hounds in attendance. The earl raises his hand in the style of Marcus Aurelius to gesture at his house in the middle distance, and the viewer's gaze is drawn to Glamis in all its gemlike glory. The complementary cults of house, family, learning, and manliness are all proudly displayed.<br>
<br>The basis of all Kinghorne's endeavours seems to have been the regaining of lost dignity. His title as third earl was a relatively new one (1606), limited to male heirs, and on 30 May 1672 he obtained a new charter enabling him to nominate a successor in the absence of male issue. On 1 July 1677 he managed to procure another charter giving his heirs and successors the titles of earls of Strathmore and Kinghorne, viscounts Lyon, and barons Glamis, Tannadyce, Sidlaw, and Strathdichtie. Strathmore's achievements were family-orientated, rather than on a national scale. After the Restoration he made a minor contribution to public affairs, and on 10 January 1682 he was sworn into the privy council. After the uprising of 1685 he provided stores for the army and carried out various other ancillary duties. He was rewarded with lands in Kintyre but these were soon taken back by the crown, and he obtained instead the post of extraordinary lord of session (27 March 1686) with a pension of &pound;300. In 1688 he resisted his instinct to deny the claim of the prince of Orange, but thereafter he was suspected of Jacobite leanings, and in 1689 he was relieved of his office as lord of session. On 25 April 1690 Strathmore swore allegiance to King William, but this was the end of a relatively uneventful public life. He died at Castle Huntly (Castle Lyon) on 15 May 1695 and was buried in the family lair at his own fantastic creation, Glamis. He left three sons and two daughters; John Lyon, fourth earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne (1663&#150;1712), was a tory and an opponent of the treaty of union, who only escaped arrest as a suspected Jacobite because illness confined him to Glamis. The fifth earl, also John Lyon, took part in the 1715 uprising and was killed at Sheriffmuir.<br>
