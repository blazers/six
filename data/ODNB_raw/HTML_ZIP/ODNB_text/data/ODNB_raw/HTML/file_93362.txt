<span class="headword">Kebbel,  Thomas Edward</span>  (1826&#150;1917), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born at Kilby, Leicestershire, about 23 November 1826, and baptized there on 7 January 1827. He was the youngest of four children of Henry Kebbel (1772&#150;1867) and his wife, Rachel (1784&#150;1862), daughter of Carsten Dirs. Henry Kebbel had been presented to the vicarage of Kilby and Wistow in 1813 by the patron, the court physician Sir Henry Halford, and remained in office until his death in 1867. A small private income, owing to an investment in the Phoenix Fire Office, helped him to maintain a gentlemanly standing: he was a county magistrate and popular in society. He was a high-church tory, committed to the welfare of the agricultural labourers, and was one of the first Leicestershire landowners to introduce allotments. Thomas penned an affectionate portrait of his father  (Kebbel, <span class="italic">English Country Life</span>, 9&#150;16). He remained deeply attached to Kilby's traditional rural lifestyle, and suffered a major emotional blow when the family had to leave the vicarage after his father's death.<br>
<br>Kebbel was educated at two local schools and then for five years at Merchant Taylors' School in London. He failed to get a scholarship at Exeter College, Oxford, but matriculated there in May 1845, before coming into residence the following January. Disapproving of its unintellectual regime, and particularly of the tone of William Sewell, he applied successfully for an exhibition at Lincoln College in 1847, where he found Mark Pattison a stimulating teacher. He was disappointed to take a second-class degree in 1849, seeing this, rather too harshly, as &#145;the just punishment of three years wasted in pleasure, dissipation, and folly&#146;  (Kebbel, <span class="italic">Battle of Life</span>, 149). He planned to read for the bar, but the sum that his father had set aside to pay for a place with a lawyer in chambers had to be diverted to meet his creditors after a series of family financial disasters in the late 1840s. As a result, though Kebbel took rooms in chambers in 1850, he had no confidence of success at the bar and did little work, instead enjoying a carefree life about town until his money ran out. 1853 was a miserable year of poverty, garret life, and pursuit by moneylenders; he was briefly incarcerated in Sloman's debtors' prison. He remained plagued by debts for many years.<br>
<br>However, after a spell as a private tutor and writer of occasional journalism, in 1855 Kebbel was offered &pound;100 a year by D. T. Coulton, the editor of <span class="italic">The Press</span>, a newspaper set up by Disraeli to promote the Conservative Party. He wrote regularly for <span class="italic">The Press</span> until 1858, and then more occasionally, but also for a series of other papers in the Conservative interest. These included the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span> in the first decade of its existence as a daily paper, from 1866, and <span class="italic">The Day</span>, a short-lived publication of 1867, backed by the leading Adullamite Liberals, which advocated co-operation with the Conservative Party. He also edited the <span class="italic">New Quarterly Review</span>, a publication subsidized by the Turkish government to advocate the Ottoman cause after the Crimean War, and wrote pieces both for that and for the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> reflecting the views of the Turkish ambassador, Musurus Pasha. Kebbel was one of the first generation of university men to make a career in journalism, and enjoyed the less as well as the more respectable aspects of the newspaper world of the 1850s and 1860s. A convivial man, he was also a significant social presence in two clubs for young men of Conservative principles, the Ramblers, which flourished until the late 1860s, and the Canning, a failed attempt to promote advanced principles within the party after 1867. He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1862.<br>
<br>In these years Kebbel's situation remained precarious, but from 1872 to 1906 he had a regular position on the leading Conservative daily paper <span class="italic">The Standard</span>. On 17 April 1873 he married Evelyn Catherine (1844&#150;1912), daughter of John Clarke, a country gentleman and family friend; they had a daughter, Eleanor Catherine Joan. From 1884 to 1898 he was on <span class="italic">The Standard</span>'s night shift, commenting on parliamentary proceedings. He also wrote regularly for the periodicals. He had written a dozen articles for the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span> in the 1860s, and nearly thirty articles for other journals in the 1860s and 1870s, but in the 1880s and 1890s produced almost 150 pieces, mostly for <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">National Review</span>, and the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>. Most of these were either on modern politics, from a Conservative perspective, or on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century tory history. He also wrote extensively on rural life and pursuits, particularly hunting and shooting, and on the church. A series on tory prime ministers for the <span class="italic">National Review</span> in 1884&#150;5 was worked up into a book, a <span class="italic">History of Toryism</span>, in 1886. An earlier collection of articles was published as <span class="italic">Essays on History and Politics</span> in 1864, in order to advertise his talents and principles.<br>
<br>Kebbel consistently defended the territorial constitution. He regarded the Conservative Party as the only reliable upholders of it and of the nation's global interests. Toryism, he wrote, was the historic popular party, appealing across the classes. He admired the orderliness and effectiveness of the eighteenth-century political system, and believed that Bolingbroke, Burke, Pitt, and Liverpool all offered strong tory role models. He particularly praised Pitt's visible moral national leadership, and he rued the narrow-minded ultra-protestant opposition to Catholic emancipation of 1801. He regarded Canning as the most inspiring Conservative of the nineteenth century, and his early death as a disaster for the country because it prevented him from leading a united tory party to accept a very moderate reform scheme, which he felt would probably have prevented whig&#150;Liberal dominance, avoided an unnecessary tory split over the corn laws, and slowed the progress of democracy. Kebbel regretted the rapidity of that progress in the late nineteenth century, and the growing threat to property and to good government as he defined it (that is, local propertied autonomy and central executive independence from demagogues and popular pressure). He opposed the 1888 reform of county government as an unnecessary assault on the beneficent rule of a resident aristocracy. But he was also a political realist, who accepted that the Conservative Party's function was to offer positive and imaginative rather than defensive political leadership and to make all the legislative concessions necessary to perpetuate popular faith in rule by the governing classes.<br>
<br>Kebbel particularly admired Disraeli. He was not uncritical, especially of Disraeli's optimism that he could stem the tide of radical and popular pressure. But he appreciated his love of history and patriotism, his admiration for landed rule, his ridicule of whig claims to represent the people, and his panache, which he felt attracted many young men to the party. He had first met him in 1858 and frequently discussed politics with him. Disraeli regarded him as a useful press contact and helped his early career, both journalistically and by trying to find him salaried official positions. Kebbel declined an inspectorship of factories, preferring the excitement of political writing, but about 1877 Disraeli appointed him receiver of fines and penalties at the Treasury, a civil service position which he held until his death. Disraeli appreciated Kebbel's insight into him, and according to Lord Rowton wished Kebbel and Viscount Barrington to write his official biography, but no instructions to this effect were found. Instead, Kebbel edited his speeches in two volumes with an introduction (1882). He also wrote a short biography, <span class="italic">Lord Beaconsfield</span>, for the <span class="roman">Statesmen</span> series in 1888, followed by one of the fourteenth earl of Derby in 1890. He wrote the entries on Disraeli and Canning, along with seven others, in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>.<br>
<br>Kebbel's other significant work was <span class="italic">The Agricultural Labourer</span>, a survey of recently available information on rural social conditions. When it appeared in 1870 it was one of the first to draw attention to the welfare of the labourer; it went through three more editions (the last in 1907) as the issue became more politically central after 1884. Kebbel remained a countryman at heart. His major sport was shooting; he owned a gun before he was fifteen and shot in all weathers, attributing his long good health to his outdoor lifestyle. He died of cardiac disease on 5 November 1917 at his home, Little Peatling, Bois Avenue, Chesham Bois, Buckinghamshire, and was buried locally.<br>
