<span class="headword">Storace,  Stephen John Seymour</span>  (1762&#150;1796), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 4 April 1762 in London, the elder child of Stefano Storace (<i>d</i>. 1783?), double bass player, and his wife, Elizabeth (1739?&#150;1821), daughter of John Trusler, the owner of Marylebone Pleasure Gardens, and sister of the clergyman and author John Trusler (1735&#150;1820). Stefano Storace was an Italian violinist from a village near Naples, who arrived in Bristol in 1747, moved to Dublin, and then in the 1750s settled in London, where he played the double bass for the Italian opera company during the regular theatre season and worked for John Trusler at the Marylebone Pleasure Gardens in the summer. He Anglicized his first name soon after he arrived in Britain. He married Trusler's daughter Elizabeth on 16 June 1761 at St James's, Piccadilly. Stephen was born the following year, his sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26589/', "Ann Selina Storace")</script> (better known as Nancy or Anna) in 1765. Both children were taught music by their father and by 1773, when Richard Brinsley Sheridan and his new wife, Elizabeth Linley, stayed with the Storaces, Stephen was already an accomplished violinist.<br>
<br>In the late 1770s Storace was sent to study violin and composition at the San Onofrio conservatory in Naples, under the care of an uncle who was a local bishop. The painter Thomas Jones portrayed Storace in his diary as &#145;a giddy, thoughtless young fellow&#146;  (Jones, 83) who was more interested in sketching expeditions than his studies. In 1779 Storace left San Onofrio and travelled with his family while Nancy pursued her career as an operatic soprano. He played second harpsichord in Bianchi's opera <span class="italic">Castore e Polluce</span> in Florence that year, and seems to have lost interest in the violin. He was however beginning to compose, and the words of a cantata entitled <span class="italic">Orfeo negli Elisi</span> by &#145;Stefano Storace Inglese&#146; were published in Lucca in 1781.<br>
<br>Stephen and Nancy met the young Irish tenor Michael Kelly in Leghorn. Kelly described them in his memoirs of 1826 as &#145;the warmest and most attached of all my friends&#146;  (Kelly, 1.95). In 1783 Nancy and Kelly became members of the emperor Joseph II's <i>opera buffa</i> company at the Burgtheater in Vienna. Nancy was chaperoned by her mother, her father apparently having died in Italy. Stephen returned to London where he published several songs and chamber works and taught singing and harpsichord. He was soon commissioned to write an <i>opera buffa</i> for the Burgtheater, probably through Nancy's influence with Joseph II. <span class="italic">Gli sposi malcontenti</span> was first performed in 1785 and was followed by <span class="italic">Gli equivoci</span> in 1786. Storace met both Haydn and Mozart in Vienna, but there is no evidence that he became Mozart's pupil. They remained in contact after Storace finally returned to England.<br>
<br>On 20 February 1787 Storace was arrested for rowdy behaviour at a dance; he described the events in a letter to a friend from gaol. He was released two days later and on 24 February the Storace family, Michael Kelly, Thomas Attwood, and Lord Barnard set out for England. They visited Mozart's father in Salzburg and arrived in London on 18 March. Stephen immediately began work at the King's Theatre in London where he arranged and directed Italian operas. He also edited <span class="italic">Storace's Collection of Original Harpsichord Music</span> (1787&#150;9) and built up his teaching clientele. In 1788 he joined the Royal Society of Musicians, composed an unsuccessful <i>opera buffa</i>, and successfully sued the music publishers Longman and Broderip for illegally publishing his aria &#145;Care Donne&#146;. On 23 August 1788 he married Mary Hall (<i>d</i>. 1801&times;17), daughter of John Hall, historical engraver to the king. They had one surviving child, Brinsley John (1788/9&#150;1807).<br>
<br>Tired of intrigues at the King's Theatre, Storace moved to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, at the beginning of the 1788&#150;9 season. He soon became house composer in all but name, composing a total of sixteen English operas with spoken dialogue and acting as music director until his death eight years later. Michael Kelly was already the leading tenor there and Nancy Storace joined them in 1789.<br>
<br>Storace normally composed two operas each season, often combining original and borrowed material. He worked mainly with two writers, Prince Hoare and James Cobb. His afterpiece operas were conventionally light-hearted; his full-length mainpiece operas became increasingly Italianate in their integration of drama and music. Most were successful and many were revived several times. His first two mainpieces, <span class="italic">The Haunted Tower</span> (1789) and <span class="italic">The Siege of Belgrade</span> (1791) were immensely popular. Later works such as <span class="italic">The Pirates</span> (1792) and <span class="italic">The Cherokee</span> (1794) are more exciting musically but suffer from weak dialogue. His most popular afterpieces include <span class="italic">No Song, No Supper</span> (1790), <span class="italic">The Prize</span> (1793), and <span class="italic">My Grandmother</span> (1793). <span class="italic">No Song, No Supper</span> is the only English opera by Storace to survive in full score; the others exist only in reduced keyboard arrangements.<br>
<br>Storace led the life of a reputable London musician. He played in charity performances, entertained Haydn to dinner on 3 June 1792, became friends with John Philip Kemble who was the acting manager at Drury Lane, and acquired Thomas Attwood as his assistant. In 1793 and 1794, while the theatre at Drury Lane was being rebuilt, Storace and Kelly were joint directors of the Italian opera company. His income was probably derived more regularly from his publications than from the theatre, which was often in arrears with his benefit money. By the early 1790s Storace had found a reliable music publisher for his operas in Joseph Dale.<br>
<br>Few contemporaries commented directly on Storace's character. The amateur musician John Marsh thought him arrogant as a young man when he &#145;spoke rather sneeringly&#146; of a composition by Marsh  (<span class="italic">John Marsh Journals</span>, 330). An obituary in <span class="italic">The Oracle</span> described him as a blunt but &#145;friendly, upright man&#146; whose &#145;opinion might be relied on for its value and sincerity&#146; and whose &#145;mind was strong, keen and vigorous&#151;his habits of living uniformly temperate&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Oracle</span>, 17 March 1796). His only known portrait is an engraving in the edition of his last two works, <span class="italic">The Iron Chest</span> and <span class="italic">Mahmoud</span>, published posthumously for his widow in 1797.<br>
<br>Storace became ill while rehearsals for <span class="italic">The Iron Chest</span> (1796) were in progress. A newspaper report described him as dying of &#145;gout and fever&#146; so bad that he was blinded  (<span class="italic">True Briton</span>, 14 March 1796). He died on 15 or 16 March 1796 and was buried in Marylebone church. On 21 March, Kemble, in a rare outburst of emotion, wrote:<blockquote>This Day I followed Stephen Storace to his Grave&#151;I shudder'd to hear the Earth and pebbles rattle on his Coffin!&#151;I hope never to go into Marybone Church again. I will endeavour to live better&#151;He was only thirty four!&#151;One may die tonight. (Kemble, 21 March 1796)</blockquote>
