<span class="headword">Ashton,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1715, <em>d.</em> 1775), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, son of the Revd Francis Ashton, usher of Lancaster grammar school, was baptized on 22 May 1715 at Bolton-le-Sands, Lancashire. Ashton was educated at Eton College from 1730. Intellectually precocious but socially withdrawn&#151;he was taciturn as well as physically awkward, being both tall and ungainly&#151;Ashton formed an intense schoolboy friendship with Horace Walpole, Thomas Gray, and the poet Richard West. The four schoolfellows, who dubbed themselves the &#145;Quadruple Alliance&#146;, are now widely regarded as the prototype of the exaggerated, and somewhat cloying, relationships that later became common in English public schools.<br>
<br>In August 1734 Ashton entered King's College, Cambridge, as a scholar. For some months, until he was joined at King's by Horace Walpole, his only friend was Gray, then at Peterhouse. The bond between the three of them, already close, became much closer. Arguably Ashton's greatest triumph during his undergraduate years was persuading the deistically inclined Horace Walpole to accompany him to Cambridge gaol, where the two of them prayed with the prisoners.<br>
<br>Ashton was elected a fellow of King's in 1737. Thereafter progress in his career was effortless&#151;thanks to Walpole. In the year that Ashton became a fellow of King's, Walpole secured him the tutorship to Lewis Windsor, later fourth earl of Plymouth. Ashton was ordained in 1741. In May of the next year Walpole wrote to Henry Pelham, paymaster-general, asking if there were any crown livings for which Ashton might be considered a suitable candidate. Within three months he had been instituted to the rectory of Aldingham in Lancashire, a living bringing in the substantial sum of &pound;200 a year. Having pulled, with consummate ease, a good plum from the ecclesiastical pie, Ashton had to give up his fellowship at King's. He was, however, quite quickly financially compensated, becoming a fellow of Eton in December 1745. Walpole had, once again, successfully canvassed on his friend's behalf.<br>
<br>Ashton was now able to take care of himself. In 1749 the provost and fellows of Eton preferred him to the rectory of Sturminster Marshall, Dorset, Ashton adroitly securing appointment to Aldingham for his younger brother, John. Three years later Ashton moved from Dorset to the prestigious London living of St Botolph without Bishopsgate. He took his DD in 1759, and was preacher to the House of Commons in 1761 and preacher of Lincoln's Inn from 1762 to 1764.<br>
<br>It was just as well that Ashton was no longer reliant upon the patronage of Walpole. In July 1750 he published a controversial pamphlet, entitled <span class="italic">A Dissertation on 2 Peter 1.19</span>. The pamphlet, a defence of miracle as proof of the divinity of Christ, was a direct attack upon Walpole's close friend, the deist Conyers Middleton. By way of emphasizing his intellectual independence Ashton used as his motto a quotation from Horace: &#145;I am not bound over to swear in the words of any master &hellip; what is right and seemly is my study and pursuit, and to that I am wholly given&#146;. Walpole was outraged, telling Horace Mann in Florence, &#145;I have forbid him [Ashton] my house&#146;  (Walpole, 20.164&#150;5).<br>
<br>Ashton was a celebrated preacher. He made his reputation, in the years immediately following his ordination, as preacher of Queen's Street Chapel, near Shepherd's Market, London. A collection of Ashton's preachments, <span class="italic">Sermons, on Several Occasions</span>, was published in 1770. Conservative in both tone and theological content, this small selection of addresses does scant justice to Ashton's histrionic power.<br>
<br>On 16 December 1760, aged forty-five, Ashton married Judith, sixth daughter of Claudius Amyand, principal surgeon to George II. The marriage was dogged by illness. In 1763, while preaching in Eton College chapel, Ashton had a heart attack. He never fully recovered, and after years of ill health died on 1 March 1775.<br>
