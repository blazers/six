</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dowbiggin, Sir  Herbert Layard</span>  (1880&#150;1966), <span class="occ">colonial police officer</span>, was born in Cotta, Ceylon, on 26 December 1880, the eldest surviving son among the four sons and four daughters of the Revd Richard Thomas Dowbiggin (1838&#150;1901), who was in charge of the Church Missionary Society Singhalese mission in Cotta, and his wife, Laetitia Anna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Layard (1845&#150;1930). Educated at Merchant Taylors' School (1895&#150;1900), where he played for the rugby fifteen, he joined the Ceylon police as an inspector in 1902, rising rapidly through the ranks to become inspector-general in 1913. He was the first officer to have risen up through the Ceylon police ranks rather than being brought in from the Indian police.<br>
<br>In Ceylon Dowbiggin developed his own policing ethos, which was based on civil rather than semi-military practices. His policing concept stemmed in part from the inherited traditions of the Ceylon police, influenced in its own development by two police forces: the Royal Irish Constabulary and the Metropolitan Police. While the Royal Irish Constabulary was theoretically a colonial, semi-military police force, the Metropolitan Police was unarmed and practised the civil concept of &#145;policing by consent&#146;. Yet in practice each type of police force borrowed from the other, which resulted in an overlapping of policing styles. The Ceylon police displayed characteristics of both, though in essence it remained a colonial police force. Cyril Longden, inspector-general in Ceylon from 1905, had introduced civil-style reform, steering Ceylon police officers towards training with the City of London Police rather than the Royal Irish Constabulary. When Dowbiggin succeeded Longden he continued his predecessor's work; by 1926 the Metropolitan Police was providing refresher courses not only for the Ceylon police but for all overseas police officers when specifically requested.<br>
<br>Throughout his tenure of office Dowbiggin put into practice his belief that policemen should be &#145;civilians in uniform&#146;. Police officers patrolled with only a truncheon or a stick, though firearms were available in police stations for use when &#145;the only method of preserving law and order [was] by means of an armed force&#146;. Despite the extent of public disorder and a high proportion of murders in Ceylon at that time Dowbiggin believed that the mere presence of armed police officers when public disorder threatened was sufficient to act as a deterrent  (<span class="italic">Police Journal</span>, 1928, 205). He was also keen to deter serious youth crime and supported the establishment of boys' clubs in Colombo in 1922 for orphan boys. Known as street boys' clubs, they encouraged boys to attend school and helped in securing employment. Throughout his police career Dowbiggin was interested in the creation of youth associations throughout the world.<br>
<br>In line with Dowbiggin's vision of modernization the Ceylon police establishment was strengthened and a new police headquarters was set up. In 1913 the police department purchased the Bambalapitiya grounds in Colombo, which later housed the central police depot. By 1916 the number of police stations on the island had increased to 138. Greater emphasis was placed on the prevention and detection of crime; a CID department was established in 1915 and the analysis and collation of crime reports was standardized. Dowbiggin also promoted new investigative techniques, including finger printing and foot printing (&#145;so useful in an Eastern country where the majority of the inhabitants go about barefooted&#146; and introduced into Ceylon by Superintendent G. Manwaring in 1926; <span class="italic">Police Journal</span>, 1928, 211) and photography (a photographic branch was introduced in 1924). He ensured that police stations could communicate effectively with each other. In 1925 a new training school was set up and run according to the British public school system with separate houses and senior recruits given the title of prefects in charge. From this time roughly 300 recruits passed through the school on a yearly basis. Dowbiggin was also responsible for the creation in 1924 of a police saving association to which police officers (with the exception of Muslim officers) were required to contribute 4 per cent of their salaries. On retirement the association provided an officer with sufficient funds to buy property or set up in business. Dowbiggin always remained sympathetic towards the plight of the rank and file and understood that the reform of police policies and procedures should be undertaken before blaming officers for ineffective policing. From the late 1920s effective police work was sometimes referred to as a <i>darbegum</i>.<br>
<br>&#145;Remarkable&#146; and indeed &#145;eccentric&#146; as Dowbiggin has been described  (O'Regan, 15), and despite his vision of transforming the Ceylon police in an English mould, the force remained essentially colonial in character, and used punitive methods to contain colonial uprisings. During the 1915 riots he authorized the use of draconian policing measures that led to the arrest of one of the leaders, Anagarika Dharmapala, whose legs were broken while he was in police custody. His brother, who was also arrested subsequently, died as a result of his injuries. E. W. Perera, a Cotta lawyer, made a direct and emotional appeal to the colonial secretary for the repeal of martial law and for the investigation of police brutality. The episode haunted Dowbiggin during his years in Ceylon though he maintained his belief in civil-style policing, which he attempted to promote among other colonial constabularies.<br>
<br>In 1926 the colonial office asked Dowbiggin to inspect the Cyprus military police, a semi-military force solely responsible for the defence of the island, and to recommend &#145;police-style&#146; reforms. His detailed report placed an emphasis on the police undertaking civil rather than semi-military duties encapsulated in his famous dictum: &#145;The notebook is to the Policeman what his rifle is to the soldier&#146;  (Dowbiggin, &#145;Inspection of Cyprus military police&#146;, TNA: PRO, CO 67/218/3/59). In Cyprus Dowbiggin encouraged the recruitment of colonial police rather than military officers into the police force, and developed the notion of policing the local population by consent rather than through force.<br>
<br>Dowbiggin had the idea of setting up the first professional police journal for the &#145;police forces of empire&#146;, the <span class="italic">Police Journal</span>, first published in 1928. In it he asserted that, despite the different regulations and conditions of service, &#145;the police forces of the Empire have a common bond &hellip; they are the representatives of law and order, pledged to protect the welfare of their fellow citizens whose servants they are&#146;.<br>
<br>In January 1930 Dowbiggin was sent to Palestine, then governed under the British mandate, to report on the Palestine police, a semi-military force comprising British and Palestinian officers (both Arabs and Jews, although the latter were under-represented). As a result of serious rioting in 1929, which the police failed to contain, a commission chaired by Sir Walter Shaw recommended police reform. Dowbiggin's detailed instructions for its complete overhaul emphasized the need for a civil and impartial police force. He perceived that the different sections of the police had operated in a segregated manner, with the British section carrying out essentially paramilitary rather than civil &#145;police&#146; duties. Recommending that the British, Arab, and Jewish sections of the police work more closely together, he looked to a stable and lasting civic order facilitated by the recruitment into the police of &#145;intelligent men of good character drawn from all nationalities resident in Palestine&#146;  (Dowbiggin, &#145;Report on the Palestine police force&#146;, 8 May 1930, TNA: PRO, CO 935/4/2).<br>
<br>Many of Dowbiggin's recommendations inspired his own prot&eacute;g&eacute; from the Ceylon police, Roy Spicer, who became inspector-general of the Palestine police in July 1931 as part of the continuing reform programme. Spicer described Dowbiggin's report as the &#145;Police Bible&#146;. In practice, however, Dowbiggin's concept of civil policing was undermined by the reality that the only means by which the British could control Palestine was a semi-military police force. While the reformed Palestine police quelled the 1933 riots it proved unable to contain the Arab revolt in 1936, and Sir Charles Tegart was brought in to advise on further reform. Tegart strongly criticized Dowbiggin's ideal of a civil police force and argued that attempts to change its ethos, policies, and procedures had been the principal cause of the Palestine police's inability to confront &#145;Arab terrorism&#146;. Tegart advocated what he termed &#145;flexible security policing&#146; and brought about the reinforcement of the Palestine police's semi-military nature and practices.<br>
<br>Dowbiggin's greatest achievement was to become the first unofficial police adviser to the Colonial Office, acting as a roving police ambassador. On returning home from leave in 1935 he embarked on a grand tour, visiting the police forces of south-east Asia as well as the forces of twelve cities in the United States, two in Canada, and two in Japan, and ending with a visit to the Metropolitan Police. His lengthy report left few in doubt that he was the Colonial Office's &#145;father of the colonial police service&#146;. Officers who had served with him in the Ceylon police took his particular ethos with them when they transferred to other constabularies, and he kept up a stream of correspondence with the heads of many forces, advising on police matters. With the creation of the colonial police service on 1 October 1936 provisional plans had been put in place for the post of a colonial police adviser, who would report directly to the Colonial Office on colonial police appointments, promotions, police policy, and procedures, and would undertake annual inspections and oversee colonial police conferences. Dowbiggin had been one of the first possible candidates suggested, the Colonial Office describing him as &#145;young for his years and exceptionally energetic&#146;  (Furse, CO minute, 15 Feb 1933). In the event, the official post of inspector-general of the colonial police service did not come into effect until 1948 with the appointment of Sir William Johnson. In 1937 Dowbiggin made a final overseas tour, visiting the police forces of Zanzibar, Kenya, Sudan, Mozambique, Northern and Southern Rhodesia, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Honolulu, offering advice on policing matters.<br>
<br>Dowbiggin retired as inspector-general of the Ceylon police in 1937. Awarded the king's police medal in 1920, he was knighted in 1931, and in 1939 received the colonial police medal. He was described as being &#145;a stern disciplinarian, especially of his young officers from the United Kingdom, fearlessly outspoken and direct in all his enterprises&#146; with &#145;a formidable presence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Police Journal</span>, 39, July 1966, 328). In retirement he lived at the Old Rectory, Milden, near Bildeston, Suffolk, where he was a prominent member of the church congregation. He died at St Mary's Hospital, Bury St Edmunds, on 24 May 1966.<br>
