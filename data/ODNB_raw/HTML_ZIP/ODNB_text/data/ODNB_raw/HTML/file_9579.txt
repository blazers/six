<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  Maurice</span>, eighteenth knight of Kerry  (1774&#150;1849), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the elder son of Robert Fitzgerald, knight of Kerry (<i>d</i>. 1781), and his third wife, Catherine, daughter of Launcelot Sandes of Kilcavan, Queen's county. He was born in co. Kerry on 29 December 1774 and succeeded his father as knight of Kerry in 1781. He entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1789 but failed to take a degree; a spell at Lincoln's Inn, London, proved equally fruitless and he was not called to the bar. He was elected MP for County Kerry in 1794 but as he was then under age he had to wait several months before taking his seat. He subsequently represented County Kerry uninterruptedly for thirty-seven years in the Dublin and, after 1801, Westminster parliaments. The knight of Kerry entered public life at the same period as two of his personal friends, the duke of Wellington and Lord Castlereagh. He proved a harsh critic of the Irish parliament, and blamed it for the rebellion of 1798, in which he served as a major in the Kerry militia. Not surprisingly, in the aftermath of the rebellion, he emerged as a firm advocate of union, which he saw as the solution to the Catholic question. On 22 January 1799, a day after he had made a particularly robust defence of union in parliamentary debate, he was offered a seat at the Irish revenue board, Lord Cornwallis, the viceroy, pronouncing him to be a &#145;young man of excellent abilities&#146;. He held this position until January 1801. On the resignation of William Pitt and Lord Cornwallis in 1801, he was chosen by the latter to explain Pitt's position on the question of Catholic emancipation to leading Catholic activists in Dublin. In the same year, following his election to the imperial parliament as member for county Kerry, he was sworn of the privy council and given a seat at the Irish treasury board. Also in 1801 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel of the Kerry militia, a position he retained until his death. Despite these honours, for a number of years he showed himself to be a very irregular attender at Westminster. On 5 November 1801 he married Maria (<i>d</i>. 1829), daughter of David Digges La Touche, of the Dublin banking family, and it is possible that her many confinements (she bore eleven children) made him reluctant to travel. In 1807 he resigned his office out of sympathy with the whig ministry of the duke of Bedford, which had just fallen as a result of the Catholic question. From that date until 1827 he attended parliament regularly and generally took an opposition stance. He was particularly active throughout this period in advocating the cause of Catholic relief, frequently acting in close concert with Daniel O'Connell, and he was bitterly disappointed that the union had not fulfilled its promise in that respect. With the passing of the <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Act</span> in 1829, however, &#145;The Knight&#146; (as O'Connell dubbed him) began to move towards the tories; Wellington had been a friend from his youth and he took office as vice-treasurer of Ireland in Wellington's ministry in 1830. This proved to be his political undoing, for O'Connell, despite Fitzgerald's services to the Catholic cause, denounced him as &#145;an avowed ministerialist&#146; and turned his political weight against him in co. Kerry. He was defeated in the elections of 1831 and 1835. In the latter electoral contest he was overwhelmed by the unscrupulous popular party, which practised intimidation and drew up &#145;the patriot's curse&#146;, to be pronounced on anyone who voted for the knight of Kerry:<blockquote>May his wife, if he have one prove incontinent, being found oftener in the brothel than by the home fireside and may he nightly repose himself in sheets contaminated and adulterous. Amen.<br>
<br>May his children prove ungrateful and disobedient, and should he need a crutch, may they pluck it from their old limping sire, and with it beat out his brains. Amen. (Fitzgerald MSS, PRONI, T3075/15/46)</blockquote>He held office for a brief time as a lord of the Admiralty in Peel's short-lived administration of December 1834, but he never recovered his seat in parliament. In 1845 he addressed a <span class="italic">Letter to Sir Robert Peel on the Endowment of the Roman Catholic Church of Ireland</span> in which he claimed that William Pitt was in fact the originator of Peel's scheme.<br>
<br>Fitzgerald inherited an encumbered estate and the debts mounted as the years passed. He was very interested in &#145;improvement&#146; in his local area and to that end he promoted slateworks on Valentia Island and a fish-curing business at Cahirciveen, and he and O'Connell were shareholders in the American and Colonial Steam and Navigation Company set up to establish navigation between Valentia harbour and places abroad. None of these projects enjoyed more than a brief success, and his debts mounted. He vigorously opposed the Irish poor law, &#145;concocted in English cupidity and a selfish jealousy of Ireland&#146;, which he forecast would bring ruin to Irish landlords. By the 1840s his estate on Valentia Island was grossly overcrowded with impoverished subtenants. He died at Glanleam, Valentia, on 7 March 1849. His four eldest sons predeceased him, and he was succeeded by his fifth son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9581/', "Peter George Fitzgerald")</script>. His second wife, Mrs Cecilia Maria Knight, survived him until 1859.<br>
