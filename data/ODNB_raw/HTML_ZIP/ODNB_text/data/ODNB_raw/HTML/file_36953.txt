<span class="headword">Wilson,  Frank Percy</span>  (1889&#150;1963), <span class="occ">literary scholar and bibliographer</span>, was born at Birmingham on 11 October 1889, the youngest of the nine children of John Wilson (<i>c</i>.1846&#150;1923), wholesaler, and his wife, Alice Mary While. He was educated in Birmingham, at Camp Hill and King Edward's grammar schools, then at the University of Birmingham, where he took a first class in English (1911) and an MA (1912). He went on to Lincoln College, Oxford, obtaining a BLitt in 1913 for a thesis on Thomas Dekker which laid the foundations for much of his later work, and won him the Charles Oldham scholarship.<br>
<br>In September 1914 Wilson volunteered for military service and in 1915 was commissioned in the Royal Warwickshire regiment. He was badly wounded on the Somme in July 1916, and after much surgery was left with a permanent limp and was subject to bouts of infection. After over a year in hospital he served briefly in the Ministry of Food. In 1919 he was invited back to Birmingham by Professor Ernest de Selincourt, who remarked of him that &#145;we have never had a man who showed a more complete instinct (genius it might be called) for the learned handling of books&#146;  (Davis, 442). Wilson returned to Oxford two years later as a university lecturer, and was appointed reader in 1927. Among his pupils was Joanna, daughter of Lancelot Perry-Keene, whom he married on 15 March 1924 and with whom he had three sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>At Oxford Wilson resumed work on Dekker. His edition of Dekker's <span class="italic">Foure Birds of Noahs Arke</span> was published in 1924, and the <span class="italic">Plague Pamphlets of T. Dekker</span> in 1925: these were to be extended to a four-volume edition of Dekker's prose works, a project never abandoned, but never completed (despite a Leverhulme research fellowship in 1938&#150;40 for this purpose). Wilson's Dekker should have rivalled the edition (1904&#150;10) of Thomas Nashe by R. B. McKerrow, the edition which served as Wilson's model, and to which he made corrections and additions when it was reprinted in 1958. An offshoot of this project, <span class="italic">The Plague in Shakespeare's London</span> (1927), proved very successful, and was reprinted in paperback in 1963 with a preface, dated five months before his death, characteristically drawing attention to new source material: to Wilson all work was work in progress.<br>
<br>From 1929 to 1936 Wilson was professor of English at the University of Leeds. Administrative duties, discharged with the same sense of meticulous responsibility which he brought to his scholarship, and the lack of a convenient research library, slowed up his academic work. Fortunately, the Huntington Library in San Marino, California, offered him a research fellowship in 1933, the first of many transatlantic journeys. He was a visiting fellow at the Huntington again in 1952&#150;3 and 1958; and at the Folger Shakespeare Library, Washington, in 1957. In 1943 he was visiting Carnegie professor at Columbia University, New York, lectured at Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts, and gave the Alexander lectures at the University of Toronto (published as <span class="italic">Elizabethan and Jacobean</span> in 1945); in 1952 he was visiting professor at Stanford University, California, and Turnbull lecturer at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland; and in 1958 he gave the Ewing lectures in the University of California at Los Angeles (published in his <span class="italic">Seventeenth Century Prose</span> in 1960).<br>
<br>In 1935 Wilson accepted, together with Bonamy Dobr&eacute;e, the general editorship of the <span class="italic">Oxford History of English Literature</span>. This task consumed a great deal of his time, and he himself undertook the volume on English drama from 1485 to 1642. His British Academy lecture entitled <span class="italic">Shakespeare and the Diction of Common Life</span> (1941) and his Clark lectures at Trinity College, Cambridge (1951), published as <span class="italic">Marlowe and the Early Shakespeare</span> (1953), are a foretaste of this volume; what he had completed at his death was published as <span class="italic">English Drama, 1485&#150;1585</span> (ed. G. K. Hunter, 1968). Two chapters, &#145;The English history play&#146; and &#145;Shakespeare's comedies&#146; were also salvaged in <span class="italic">Shakespearian and other Studies</span> (ed. Helen Gardner, 1969).<br>
<br>The chief merits of Wilson's dramatic criticism were his constant alertness to the exigencies of the stage (he was a promising amateur actor in his early days); and, most remarkably, his unrivalled knowledge of contemporary word usage and phraseology, derived from years of reading and research, which also informed his work on proverbs, mock-prognostications, and jest-books. <span class="italic">The Proverbial Wisdom of Shakespeare</span> (1961) was one of Wilson's many published papers on proverbs. He spent years preparing the third edition of the <span class="italic">Oxford Dictionary of English Proverbs</span>, with the assistance of his wife; it appeared with her introduction in 1970. Wilson would refer defensively to his hobby of collecting proverbs as his tatting, to be done when too tired to write; but he valued proverbs for establishing texts and meanings in Elizabethan authors, and often invoked them himself for explanatory or illustrative purposes.<br>
<br>In 1936 Wilson was elected Hildred Carlile professor of English literature at Bedford College, London. The congenial combination of college life with reading in the British Museum was interrupted by war and evacuation to Cambridge, where, despite his lameness, he joined the Home Guard. In early 1943 he wrote a long essay, &#145;Shakespeare and the new bibliography&#146; for <span class="italic">The Bibliographical Society, 1892&#150;1942: Studies in Retrospect</span> (1945), a jubilee volume. Wilson's personal copy, as revised in 1948, was edited by Helen Gardner in 1970. In it the work of E. K. Chambers, R. B. McKerrow, and A. W. Pollard is duly appraised. The real hero, however, is W. W. Greg, whom Wilson regarded as his &#145;master&#146;, and whose notice he contributed to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. Their friendship dated from early collaboration on an edition for the Malone Society of <span class="italic">Every Man out of his Humour</span> (1920) by Ben Jonson. In 1948 Wilson followed Greg as general editor of the Malone Society; the regular flow of Malone reprints, including works by John Fletcher, Samuel Rowley, and Thomas Middleton, either edited or checked by Wilson, bears witness to the many hours which he devoted to the society and its editors. He did not relinquish this task until 1960, yet also found time to edit three pamphlets for the Luttrell Society.<br>
<br>In 1947 Wilson succeeded David Nichol Smith as Merton professor of English literature at Oxford. Much of the literary work already referred to was done during the next decade, which proved happy and productive; he enjoyed the proximity of the Bodleian and the society of other Elizabethan scholars. His forceful lectures and attractive reading voice were much appreciated, and many research students profited from his advice. On retirement in 1957 he was made a senior research fellow of Merton College for three years. Wilson was always disappointed by his failure to complete his <i>magnum opus</i> on Shakespeare and Elizabethan drama, and towards the end of his life his work was frequently interrupted by bouts of ill health. Yet he was remembered as the most learned Elizabethan scholar of his generation, as well as a master of social graces and a witty conversationalist.<br>
<br>Wilson was made a trustee of Dove Cottage in 1939; he was elected FBA in 1943; made honorary LLD of the University of Birmingham in 1947 and honorary fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford in 1948; and was president of the Bibliographical Society, 1950&#150;52, and of the Oxford Bibliographical Society, 1956&#150;7. <span class="italic">Elizabethan and Jacobean Studies: Presented to F. P. Wilson in Honour of his 70th Birthday</span>, edited by H. J. Davis and H. Gardner (1959), contains &#145;A select list of the writings of F. P. Wilson&#146; by H. S. Bennett. Wilson was president of the Malone Society, 1960&#150;63, and of the Modern Humanities Research Association, 1961. He died at his home, 30 Cumnor Hill, Berkshire, on 29 May 1963.<br>
