<span class="headword">Cooke <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Macook, Cook]</span>,  Henry</span>  (1788&#150;1868), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland</span>, was born on 11 May 1788, the fourth and youngest child of Jane Howe, the second wife of John Macook, a tenant farmer of the Grillagh, near Maghera, in co. Londonderry.<h2>
<a name="Educationandordination"></a>Education and ordination</h2>Henry's early education was in a series of &#145;hedge&#146; schools, and later he recalled how he and a Roman Catholic companion &#145;tended the peaceful flocks with Vergil or fought again the battles of Homer&#146;  (Kennedy, 70). This classical education was supplemented at home by his mother's vivid accounts of the battles of his protestant forefathers for &#145;faith and freedom&#146;. His son-in-law and biographer, J. L. Porter, tells us that to her &#145;Henry was indebted for most of those anecdotes and incidents of Irish history which in after years he recited with such pathos and power&#146;  (Porter, 2). His boyhood experiences, in the disturbed confusion surrounding the 1798 rising, left impressions on his mind which inclined him towards the conservative principles which he adopted in later life.<br>
<br>In 1802 the fourteen-year-old Henry Macook matriculated in the University of Glasgow and began his studies for the ministry. In spite of his failure to graduate in arts he was accepted as a student for the ministry by the Root presbytery in 1807 and licensed the following year by the Ballymena presbytery. Although he was only twenty years of age he was soon called to the congregation of Denain in co. Antrim as assistant and successor to the Revd Robert Scott, being ordained and installed on 10 November 1808. If his university career had been undistinguished, his first pastorate was inauspicious, ending in resignation after only two years. Cook, who had now discarded Mac from his name but had not yet added the letter &#145;e&#146;, was young, poor, and lonely, living in lodgings on a pittance of &pound;25 a year, and in November 1810 he resigned to become the tutor in the family of Alexander Brown, a farmer, of Kells, near Ballymena. This interruption of his ministerial career proved short-lived, however, and on 22 January 1811 he was installed in the nearby Donegore congregation by the Templepatrick presbytery. Donegore had rejected an apparently more attractive candidate in the brilliant Henry Montgomery (1788&#150;1865), destined to be Cooke's great opponent in the conflict which divided the synod of Ulster in the 1820s. The peace of the synod had been threatened for almost a century by the tensions between conservatives or Old Lights, who held tenaciously to traditional Calvinism, as enshrined in the Westminster formularies, and liberals or New Lights, who espoused a latitudinarian theology and opposed the obligation of ordinands to subscribe to the Westminster confession of faith. Cooke's Old Light theology had been one of the reasons for his discomfort in Denain, where his predecessor had been New Light, while Henry Montgomery's biographer, J. A. Crozier, claims that it was Montgomery's unequivocal New Light preaching which led to his rejection by Donegore. Donegore, unlike Denain, preferred Old Light. In Donegore Cooke made a fresh start, and his marriage in 1813 to Ellen Mann (<i>d</i>. 1868) of Toome gave his life a new stability. His gifts as a preacher began to blossom and in December 1814 he was invited to preach in Belfast on behalf of the rapidly growing town's recently founded house of industry. The occasion was a success, Cooke's sermon was printed, and his name begins to appear in newspaper accounts of special sermons for <span class="roman">Bible</span> societies and Sunday schools. Conscious now of the deficiencies in his earlier education, he returned to his studies, and between 1815 and 1818 an indulgent congregation allowed him to spend two winters in Glasgow and one in Dublin, largely in medical studies. This was not unusual at a time when, according to an observer of the Ulster scene, &#145;most Presbyterian ministers were physicians and surgeons likewise&#146;  (Gamble, 222).<h2>
<a name="Emergenceasachampionoforthodoxy"></a>Emergence as a champion of orthodoxy</h2>While in Dublin Cooke was involved in preaching on Sundays in Carlow and Stratford-on-Slaney, where Presbyterian congregations were being formed. This kind of outreach was characteristic of the evangelical movement, which was breathing new life into the dry bones of Irish protestantism and which was to lead to what was called the protestant crusade in Ireland. Dublin was the headquarters of the Irish evangelical movement, in which Dr Benjamin McDowell, the senior minister of the Presbyterian Mary's Abbey congregation, had been prominently involved, and Cooke's sojourn in Dublin and his associations with the Mary's Abbey congregation strengthened his evangelical and Old Light convictions.<br>
<br>To the disappointment of his Donegore congregation, Cooke moved to Killyleagh in co. Down soon after his return from Dublin, being installed there by the Dromore presbytery on 8 September 1818. He had been recommended to the Killyleagh congregation by his New Light predecessor there, the Revd W. D. H. McEwen, who described him as &#145;not bigoted in his opinions&#146; and having &#145;too much good sense not to be charitable towards those who differ from him in sentiment&#146;  (McCreery, 228). Yet within three years of his arrival in Killyleagh he had emerged as an uncompromising champion of orthodoxy. One reason for this was the influence of a ruling elder in the Killyleagh congregation, Captain Sidney Hamilton Rowan. Rowan was the son of the local landlord, the United Irishman Archibald Hamilton Rowan. Captain Rowan shared his father's vigour and public spirit but differed from him in theology and politics. He was an ardent evangelical, and Alexander McCreery, a later minister in Killyleagh, claimed that &#145;to him [Rowan] primarily and mainly is attributable the influence which brought forward Dr. Cooke as the exponent and defender of evangelical doctrine&#146;  (ibid., 366). In 1821 an English Unitarian missionary, the Revd John Smethurst, visited Killyleagh in the course of a preaching tour in Ulster. Rowan and Cooke attended his lecture and Cooke, encouraged by Rowan, announced that he would reply to the Unitarian on the following Sunday evening. So enthusiastic was the response of a crowded congregation to Cooke's polemic that he pursued Smethurst through the province, attacking his teaching.<br>
<br>Few Irish Presbyterians were unitarians in 1821 but some were Arians, who rejected the full deity of Christ, and it was the appointment of an Arian, William Bruce, as professor of Greek and Hebrew in the Belfast Institution in 1821 which drew Cooke into the arena of public theological controversy once more. The Belfast Academical Institution, founded in 1810 to meet the urgent need in Belfast and Ulster for higher education of some kind, had already been a target for conservative political suspicion. Its founders included well-known Belfast radicals such as Dr William Drennan and Dr R. J. Tennent, which led the Ulster-born tory statesman Lord Castlereagh to suspect that the college would be the centre of radical influence. In particular Castlereagh feared that if, as its founders hoped, the institution became the training college for Ulster's Presbyterian ministers, this would defeat his policy of discouraging radicalism and encouraging loyalism among the ministers, some of whom had been implicated in the United Irish movement and the 1798 rising. Castlereagh, one of the architects of the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span>, had thrown the weight of his influence against arrangements to train Presbyterian students for the ministry in the institution, but he had failed because the college authorities and the Presbyterian synods had stood together for academic and ecclesiastical freedom. There were now three Presbyterian synods in Ulster for, during the eighteenth century, covenanters and seceders from Scotland had planted congregations and formed presbyteries in opposition to the increasingly liberal or New Light Synod of Ulster. All three had agreed to allow their students for the ministry to be educated in the institution and had appointed divinity professors to enable them to take their full course of training in Belfast. This had been a success, and when Cooke attacked Arian influences in the institution at the 1822 meeting of the synod of Ulster in Newry he found that few members of synod believed that a crusade against Arianism was necessary or desirable. Nevertheless Cooke persisted, rallying supporters, particularly among the Presbyterian laity.<h2>
<a name="CookescampaignagainstArianism"></a>Cooke's campaign against Arianism</h2>Cooke's election as moderator of the synod in 1824 gave him opportunities to ventilate his convictions, particularly when he was called upon to give evidence to parliamentary committees and government commissions of inquiry, including one into the affairs of the Belfast Institution. His allegations that the institution was becoming a &#145;seminary of Arianism&#146; were publicized and provoked warm controversy. He survived attacks upon his evidence at the annual meeting of the synod in 1825 and succeeded in persuading the synod to demand increased influence in future appointment in the college. This the institution authorities refused to concede, insisting that the synod had already sufficient influence in appointment through the <i>ex officio</i> vote of its moderator. The institution was popular among Presbyterians who saw no evidence of Arian influences on their students for the ministry, and, at the meeting of the synod in 1826 in Ballymena, Cooke found the tide of majority opinion flowing against him as strongly as it had been with him the previous year. His campaign against Arianism in the institution had ended in defeat. The publication in 1827 of evidence given to the commission of inquiry into the affairs of the institution, however, gave him an opportunity to attack ministers of the synod who had avowed their Arian convictions. These included Henry Montgomery and William Porter, the clerk of the synod. When the synod met in Strabane in 1827 Cooke insisted that the reaffirmation of their church's Trinitarian faith was necessary, and in spite of Henry Montgomery's eloquent plea for liberty of conscience and the right of private judgement the overwhelming majority of the members of synod agreed, thus isolating the small minority of Arians and those opposed to doctrinal statements as tests of faith. The rejection, in 1826, of Cooke's allegations of Arian influences in the institution had not implied any approval of Arianism, and this was made clear by the 1827 synod's affirmation of its Trinitarian faith.<br>
<br>The following year the synod, meeting in Cookstown, was persuaded to set up a committee to examine the orthodoxy of students for the ministry, and it was clear that no Arian would be accepted in future. This led Montgomery and his party to publish a remonstrance against the proceedings of the synod, threatening to secede if their objections were not met, and in 1830 seventeen ministers and their congregations withdrew from the synod of Ulster to form the Remonstrant Synod. Before the separation took place, however, there was a final confrontation between the two parties, involving once more the Belfast Institution. The appointment of a Scot, John Ferrie of Glasgow University, to the chair of moral philosophy in the institution was attacked by Cooke on the grounds of Ferrie's doubtful orthodoxy. Montgomery, in reply, attacked Cooke's consistency and integrity because in his evidence to the institution commission of inquiry he had stated that he had never known of any Arianism in Glasgow, but now he was querying the orthodoxy of the former Glasgow University chaplain.<br>
<br>Cooke chose to interpret this as a charge of perjury, as his evidence had been given on oath, and, in the words of the radical Presbyterian journalist James McKnight, &#145;on this rhetorical hypothesis, he made, to the feeling of the audience, an appeal unequalled in the annals of oratory&#146;  (<span class="italic">Londonderry Standard</span>, 24 Dec 1875). This was hyperbole, of course, but, coming from a journalist who did not admire Cooke, it is a tribute to his remarkable oratorical powers. The withdrawal of the remonstrants left Cooke on a pinnacle of influence in the synod of Ulster, and the historian W. D. Killen, who was ordained in 1829, has judged that<blockquote>The popularity enjoyed in this period by the pastor of Killyleagh, was such as perhaps has never been attained by any other minister in this country and wherever he appeared either on the pulpit or on the platform he was sure to attract an overwhelming audience. (Reid, 3.462)</blockquote>He refused a call to the Mary's Abbey congregation in Dublin in 1828, but in 1829 his admirers in Belfast, disappointed that he had not been invited to be the first minister of the new congregation in Fisherwick Place, built May Street Church to provide him with a pulpit in their growing town. His rejection by the Fisherwick Place congregation was clear evidence, however, that he was <i>persona non grata</i> in some quarters, and not all of them Arian or New Light. When Jefferson College, Pennsylvania, made him an honorary DD in 1829, the <span class="italic">Northern Whig</span> commented that &#145;in consequence of distance&#146; the college had discerned &#145;literary and scientific attainments which, in consequence of our too near approximation to the luminary, we are unable to discern&#146;  (14 Dec 1829).<h2>
<a name="Politicalinfluence"></a>Political influence</h2>In his evidence before both houses of parliament in 1824, Cooke had queried the commitment of a majority of Irish Presbyterians to Catholic emancipation, in spite of the synod's declaration in its favour in 1813. This brought him into conflict with liberal Presbyterians but made him a hero with the opponents of emancipation. During the controversy in the synod he was prepared to play the Orange card, as when in Coleraine in 1825 he appealed improperly &#145;to those galleries, crowded with the freemen of my native county &hellip; for a unanimous and cordial verdict of acquittal&#146;  (<span class="italic">Northern Whig</span>, 7 July 1825). It was alleged that the Orangemen in the galleries in Coleraine and in Strabane in 1827 may have influenced the outcome of the debates. Henry Montgomery claimed that it was by uniting evangelicalism and Orangeism that Cooke acquired his extraordinary popularity and influence.<br>
<br>The historian of the Belfast Institution, John Jamieson, has argued that Cooke's real objective in attacking the institution was the destruction of political liberalism in his church. Certainly, after his victory in the synod, Cooke became increasingly identified with the political interests of the protestant establishment in Ireland. He and his great ally, Robert Stewart of Broughshane, were among the few Presbyterians who opposed the concession of Catholic emancipation in 1829. He waged a relentless and ultimately successful campaign against the Irish national education system, introduced by a reforming whig government in 1831 to end Protestant proselytization of Roman Catholics through education by uniting all children for secular education and separating them for religious instruction. He advocated protestant political union in response to the challenge of post-emancipation Irish Roman Catholicism, antagonizing Presbyterian radicals by publishing the &#145;banns of marriage&#146; of presbytery and prelacy at a great conservative demonstration at Hillsborough in co. Down in 1834.<br>
<br>Cooke was a determined supporter of the principle of religious establishments against voluntarism, which demanded the separation of the church and state. He liked to describe himself as a minister of the Church of Scotland in Ireland and was delighted when full communion between the Church of Scotland and the synod of Ulster was restored in 1836 following legislation in the synod to reintroduce subscription to the Westminster formularies for ordinands. In 1837 Trinity College, Dublin, made him an LLD for his services to the cause of religious establishments. The restoration of subscription in the synod of Ulster was a step on the road to union with the Secession synod, which took place in 1840. But union with the Seceders diminished Cooke's authority in what was now the general assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, and in the 1840s he was confronted by a renaissance of Presbyterian liberalism. In 1843, angered by the Disruption of the Church of Scotland and problems relating to the legality of marriages by Presbyterian ministers, the general assembly passed a resolution calling for better representation of Presbyterian interests in parliament, to which Cooke responded by withdrawing from the assembly until the resolution was rescinded in 1847. His absence from the assembly did not prevent his involvement in the negotiations between his church and the government over the foundation of the Queen's Colleges.<br>
<br>Cooke had finally succeeded in breaking his church's links with the Belfast Institution, and he played a significant part in an agreement between church and government by which the government endowed chairs in theological subjects for a Presbyterian college and the church recognized the Queen's Colleges for their ministerial students' pre-theological education. Cooke was considered as a possible first president of the Belfast Queen's College, but his increasingly strident anti-Catholicism ruled him out. A Presbyterian, the Revd P. S. Henry of Armagh, was appointed, and Cooke succeeded him as agent for the distribution of the <i>regium donum</i> at a salary of &pound;320 a year. He was also appointed professor of sacred rhetoric and catechetics by the general assembly in the Presbyterian theological faculty in 1847 and president of the Presbyterian Theological College, which was opened in 1853. Compelled by the law of the church to resign his May Street pastorate, he continued a constant supplier of the pulpit until his retirement in 1867. He had been moderator of the general assembly in 1841 and was so honoured again in 1862.<br>
<br>Cooke continued to champion the causes of political Conservatism and unionism. His greatest political triumph was in 1841 when Daniel O'Connell, visiting Belfast to advocate the repeal of the union, declined to accept Cooke's challenge to debate the subject, and he was hailed as the &#145;cook who dish'd Dan&#146;. It is often said that Cooke changed the political outlook of the Ulster Presbyterians from the radicalism and republicanism of the eighteenth century to Conservatism and unionism in the nineteenth, but this must be qualified. Irish Presbyterians may have become unionists, but they did not become Conservatives until Gladstone made home rule Liberal Party policy in 1886. Cooke's criticisms of the tenant-right movement in the 1850s, which was supported by many Presbyterian tenant farmers, lost him much popularity, and few Presbyterians shared his support for the Church of Ireland or responded to his deathbed appeal to Ulster's electorate to vote tory and save the Church of Ireland from disestablishment in 1868. He died at his home, 124 Ormeau Road, Belfast, on 13 December 1868, his wife and most of his thirteen children having predeceased him. He was accorded a civic funeral and burial on 18 December in Balmoral cemetery, Belfast; in 1876 his statue was placed in the centre of that city. Many of his sermons and addresses were published, but are regarded as failing to convey the dramatic impact of his oratory.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Few have articulated as effectively as Henry Cooke the distinctive and emotive emphases of nineteenth- and twentieth-century Ulster protestantism&#151;evangelicalism, anti-Catholicism, and unionism in politics. Irish Presbyterians have traditionally honoured him as the Athanasius of their church, but many have deplored his identification of the interest of protestantism with unionism. J. L. Porter's biography is indispensable but uncritical, while John Jamieson, the historian of the Belfast Academical Institution, debunks him as a self-seeking demagogue. A study by R. F. G. Holmes (1981) is sympathetic but not uncritical.<br>
