<span class="headword">Mayo,  Katherine</span>  (1867&#150;1940), <span class="occ">author in the United States of America</span>, was born on 24 January 1867 in Ridgeway, Pennsylvania, USA, the daughter of James Henry Mayo, mining engineer, and his wife, Harriet Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ingraham. The Mayos were descended from the Revd John Mayo, who had come to Boston, Massachusetts, from England in 1638. Katherine Mayo was educated in private schools in Boston and in Cambridge, Massachusetts, before the family moved to Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey. Her career as a writer began in 1892 when she sold a short story to <span class="italic">Life</span> magazine. Early in her career she sometimes used the <i>noms de plume</i> Katherine Prence and Katherine Monck. Her writings appeared in the <span class="italic">New York Evening Post</span>, <span class="italic">Scribner's</span>, and the <span class="italic">Atlantic Monthly</span>; but she also supplemented her income by selling indigenous people's relics to various institutions. In 1899 she accompanied her father to Dutch Guiana, where he had gone to prospect for gold. After eight years in the Dutch colony she returned to the United States, where, after meeting her in 1910, she established a permanent home with Margery Moyca Newell (1882&#150;1968), at the latter's estate in Bedford Hills, New York. Her partnership with Newell, an orphaned heiress from a wagon-manufacturing family from Kenosha, Wisconsin, provided Mayo with the financial stability to pursue her writing career. <br>
<br>Mayo found an early patron in Oswald Garrison Villard, of the <span class="italic">New York Evening Post</span>, who introduced her to some of the best-known names in American publishing. She was Villard's research assistant on his book <span class="italic">John Brown, 1800&#150;1855: a Biography Fifty Years After</span> (1910), a role that was later fictionalized in Russell Banks's novel <span class="italic">Cloudsplitter</span> (1998). She was also an assistant to Horace White, editor-in-chief of the <span class="italic">New York Evening Post</span>, with his book <span class="italic">Life of Lyman Trumbull</span> (1913). Villard recruited Mayo and Newell to his campaign for the creation of a state police force in New York to be modelled on the recently created Pennsylvania state police force. Mayo wrote numerous articles and three books for the campaign, providing favourable portrayals of the Pennsylvania state police, notorious among socialists and labour groups as an instrument in the hands of capitalists. Her <span class="italic">Justice to All: the Story of the Pennsylvania State Police</span> (1917), which carried an introduction by Theodore Roosevelt, was distributed to every New York state legislator before the successful passage of the <span class="roman">Albany State Police Bill</span>. Mayo's next book, <span class="italic">That Damn Y</span> (1920), sought to rehabilitate the reputation of the Young Men's Christian Association, which had come under criticism for its international work during the First World War. In 1921, along with Newell, Mayo started the British Apprentice Club in New York to provide hospitality to British seamen.<br>
<br>Mayo's two subsequent books, on American rule in the Philippines and on British rule in India, were both suggested to her by powerful friends at the Rockefeller Foundation. <span class="italic">The Isles of Fear: the Truth about the Philippines</span> (1925) and <span class="italic">Mother India</span> (1927) were designed as strong indictments of the post-First World War colonial policy of the devolution of political authority to subject peoples. General Leonard Wood, governor-general of the Philippines, who was host to Mayo and Newell during their short trip to the islands, credited Mayo with helping him to reverse the policy of &#145;Filipinization&#146; pursued by his predecessor, Francis Burton Harrison. The British writer Lionel Curtis, who wrote the preface to the British edition of <span class="italic">The Isles of Fear</span>, sent it to British officials in India for use as propaganda. For Mayo's case against political reforms in India, the India Office in London decided to become involved unofficially rather than officially. (Indeed, subsequently both Mayo and the India Office denied any collusion.) Mayo's friends at the Rockefeller Foundation had advised her to make her case by focusing on public health in India, but British officials were sceptical of the efficacy of this strategy. J. H. Adam, an officer in the political intelligence department of the government of India, gave Mayo an alternative focus in the sexual problems of India, especially child marriage and premature maternity. <span class="italic">Mother India</span> charged that the cause of all the political, economic, and social woes of India lay not in the impact of British colonialism, but in the sexual degeneracy inherent in Hinduism. <span class="italic">Mother India</span> became an instant international <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>. <br>
<br>While Mayo was no stranger to controversy, her earlier writings having courted controversy for their anti-labour, anti-Catholic, and pro-imperialist bias, the uproar over <span class="italic">Mother India</span> was unprecedented. Even though both supporters and critics indulged in personal attacks, there was also a widespread consensus that India suffered from grave social problems. Where critics disagreed with Mayo, however, was on the causes of and solution to these problems. Mayo's critics, including Mahatma Gandhi, held British policies rather than an oversexed Hindu culture responsible for the social condition of India. Likewise Indian women's organizations rejected Mayo's diagnoses of Indian women's problems, blaming the obstructionist role of the colonial government for preventing necessary social reforms. Even leaders of the radical anti-caste movements in India, who sympathized with Mayo's critique of Indian nationalism, rejected her belief in the inherent superiority of Christianity and in the benefits conferred by British colonial rule. Despite the book's immense popularity, most liberal and anti-imperialist groups, especially in the United States, remained unconvinced by Mayo's argument. Similarly the American women's movement failed to rally behind <span class="italic">Mother India</span>, leaving Mayo to seek allies among such conservative women's groups as the Daughters of the American Revolution. Even the British feminist Eleanor Rathbone, who was an early supporter of <span class="italic">Mother India</span>, eventually parted company with Mayo because of the latter's crusade to absolve the colonial government of any responsibility for the situation in India. By the end of the controversy mainly diehard imperialists like Winston Churchill continued to align themselves with Mayo's attack on further political reforms in India. The controversy had brought the nature of the colonial state, no less than the social condition of India, under intense international public scrutiny. The subsequent mythologizing of Mayo's contribution in <span class="italic">Mother India</span>, by imperialists, imperialist-feminists, and Indian nationalists alike, obscured the mixed results of her imperial propaganda. <br>
<br>Although the India Office continued to play a role in Mayo's further writings on British rule in India, none of these attracted the same attention as <span class="italic">Mother India</span>. Her last book on India, a pictorial study entitled <span class="italic">The Face of Mother India</span> (1935), was ultimately banned by the government of India for its overtly anti-Hindu and pro-Muslim bias. For her later books Mayo returned to focusing predominantly on domestic issues in the United States, though in her final years she had begun work on a book on the international traffic in narcotics. She died at the home she shared with Margery Newell in Bedford Hills, New York, on 9 October 1940. Her funeral service, held at St Matthew's protestant episcopal church at Bedford Center, New York, was a reminder that her career, albeit dwarfed by the notoriety of <span class="italic">Mother India</span>, extended beyond her most famous book. New York state troopers served as pall bearers and provided a guard of honour at the service, while representatives of the British Apprentice Club laid an elaborate floral tribute on her coffin. Messages of sympathy were received from a number of dignitaries, including Lord Lothian, the British ambassador to the United States.<br>
