<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Perkin, Sir  William Henry</span>  (1838&#150;1907), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 12 March 1838 at King David's Lane, Shadwell, London, youngest of the three sons of George Fowler Perkin (1802&#150;1865), a builder and contractor, and his wife, Sarah Cuthbert. With his two brothers and three sisters he inherited a pronounced musical talent from his father. He also inherited a strong Anglican faith, and religion played an extremely important role in his life. After early education at a private school Perkin was sent in 1851 to the City of London School, where his aptitude for chemistry was encouraged by his teacher, Thomas Hall. In 1853 he entered the Royal College of Chemistry as a student under August Wilhelm Hofmann. By the end of the second year he had, under Hofmann's guidance, carried out his first piece of research, the results of which he announced in a paper read before the Chemical Society of London.<br>
<br>In 1854 Perkin fitted up a laboratory at his home, where he undertook independent research, sometimes collaborating with Arthur H. Church, and the next year he started work as Hofmann's assistant. During the Easter vacation of 1856 Perkin attempted, in his home laboratory, to synthesize quinine by oxidizing a salt of allyltoluidine with potassium dichromate. The experiment failed. On repeating the method with aniline instead of the toluidine derivative, he obtained on work-up a purple-coloured solution which proved to possess dyeing properties, especially on silk. This was the first aniline or coal-tar dye to be discovered. Encouraged by Pullars of Perth, he filed a patent for this process (patent no. 1984 of August 1856).<br>
<br>Perkin now resigned his position at the Royal College of Chemistry and embarked on a career in industrial chemistry. Assisted by his father and brother Thomas Dix Perkin he opened a chemical factory at Greenford Green, north-west of London, towards the end of 1858. The dye was first manufactured at the Perkins' works under the name of &#145;aniline purple&#146; or &#145;Tyrian purple&#146;. The name &#145;mauve&#146;, from the French word for the mallow flower, was given to the dye in England early in 1859 (chemists later called it mauveine). Perkin developed improved processes for manufacture of nitrobenzene from coal-tar benzene, and reduction of the nitro compound to aniline. He also undertook research into silk dyeing, and, of far greater commercial importance, the application of mauve to cotton dyeing and (calico) printing, for which mordants were required. Perkin's discovery and manufacture of the first aniline dye eventually led to the displacement of natural by artificial, or synthetic, dyestuffs, also made from various coal-tar products. In recognition of his invention of the mauve process, the <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Industrielle de Mulhouse</i> awarded him, in 1859, a silver medal, and afterwards a gold medal.<br>
<br>On 13 September 1859 Perkin married Jemima Harriet Lissett (<i>d</i>. 1862), daughter of John Lissett, of Huguenot descent. There were two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35478/', "William Henry Perkin (1860&#150;1929)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35476/', "Arthur George Perkin (1861&#150;1937)")</script>. Following Jemima's death Perkin married, on 8 February 1866, Alexandrine (Sascha) Caroline Mollwo, daughter of Ivan Herman Mollwo, of Russian descent. She was the mother of Perkin's third son, Frederick Mollwo Perkin, and four daughters, Helen, Mary, Lucie, and Annie. William Henry Perkin became professor of organic chemistry at Manchester University and later Oxford; Arthur George and Frederick Mollwo both distinguished themselves in the same branch of science as their father.<br>
<br>In 1868 the German chemists Carl Graebe and Carl Liebermann showed that alizarin, the important red dyestuff present in the root of the madder plant and widely used in calico printing and Turkey red dyeing on cotton, was a derivative of the coal-tar hydrocarbon anthracene (and not, as previously believed, of naphthalene). Although they patented a process for synthesis of alizarin the product was too costly to compete with the red dye from the madder plant. During 1869 Perkin, and, independently, the Hoechst dyeworks and Heinrich Caro at BASF, developed much more economical (and almost identical) processes for the manufacture of artificial alizarin via a sulphonic acid derivative of anthraquinone. Perkin also invented a process based on dichloroanthracene. This afforded an anthraquinone derivative similar to alizarin that found considerable use as a textile dye. During 1869&#150;70 Perkin and BASF pooled their resources and agreed to divide up the European market in synthetic alizarin. Perkin, with his brother, designed and erected suitable manufacturing plant.<br>
<br>This branch of the coal-tar dye industry developed rapidly, and through the displacement of the madder dye and the application of formal knowledge to industrial problem-solving, foreshadowed the age of modern, science-based industry. The English market in alizarin was almost entirely held by the Perkins until the end of 1873, at which time intense competition and major technical advances by German manufacturers led the Perkins to sell their works to the firm of Brooke, Simpson, and Spiller. Following retirement after eighteen years in the synthetic dye industry, William Perkin thereafter devoted himself to pure chemical research at his home, The Chestnuts, in Sudbury, near Harrow. Perkin delivered before the Society of Arts in 1879 two lectures, which were published under the title <span class="italic">The History of Alizarin and Allied Colouring Matters, and their Production from Coal-Tar</span>. These described mainly Perkin's work on the manufacture of alizarin.<br>
<br>Even while actively engaged in industrial work Perkin had maintained a strong interest in pure chemistry, publishing many papers in <span class="italic">Transactions of the Chemical Society</span> (where his contributions finally numbered ninety). In 1867 he published a description of his method for synthesizing unsaturated organic acids, later known as the &#145;Perkin synthesis&#146;. During the following year the synthesis of coumarin, the odorous substance contained in such plant products as the tonka bean, was announced, and the continuation of this work after his retirement from industry led to his discovery of the synthesis of cinnamic acid from benzaldehyde. Scientific papers on the chemistry of mauve were published between 1863 and 1879. In 1881 he first drew attention to the magnetic rotatory power of some of the compounds which he had prepared in his researches. It was mainly to the study of this property as applied to the investigation of the constitutions of various compounds that he devoted the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Perkin's services were widely recognized. He joined the Chemical Society of London in 1856, was its president from 1883 to 1885, and received its Longstaff medal in 1888. He was elected FRS in 1866 and received from the Royal Society a royal medal in 1879, and the Davy medal in 1889. He was president of the Society of Chemical Industry in 1884&#150;5, receiving its gold medal in 1898, and at his death was president of the Society of Dyers and Colourists. The Society of Arts conferred on him its Albert medal in 1890, and the Institution of Gas Engineers its Birmingham medal in 1892. He also received honorary doctorates from the universities of W&uuml;rzburg (1882), St Andrews (1891), and Manchester (1904).<br>
<br>In July 1906 the jubilee of Perkin's discovery of mauve was celebrated in Europe and North America. Perkin was knighted and received honorary doctorates from the universities of Oxford, Leeds, Heidelberg, Columbia, Johns Hopkins, and the Munich Technische Hochschule. He was presented with the Hofmann medal by the German Chemical Society, the Lavoisier medal by the French Chemical Society, and a special Perkin research medal by the New York section of the Society of Chemical Industry. After his death, a sum of &pound;2000, subscribed by chemists of all countries, was handed to the Chemical Society as the Perkin memorial fund, to be applied to the encouragement of research in topics related to the coal-tar and allied industries. A Perkin medal was instituted by the Society of Dyers and Colourists in recognition of contributions to the &#145;tinctorial industries&#146;. The first recipients, in 1908, were Graebe and Liebermann. An American joint committee extended the Perkin research medal initiative with, from 1908, a Perkin medal for American chemists engaged in industry-related work.<br>
<br>Perkin attended Christ Church, South Harrow, and supported Anglican and Free Church places of worship with considerable generosity. He died at his home in Sudbury on 14 July 1907, and was buried at Christ Church; his second wife survived him.<br>
