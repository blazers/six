<span class="headword">Herwarth,  Philibert</span> <span class="st"> [Philibert  d' Hervart]</span>, Baron von H&uuml;ningen  (1644&#150;1721), <span class="occ">diplomat and benefactor</span>, was born in Lyon, France, on 10 September 1644 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, the third surviving son of Jean Henri d'Hervart (Herwarth) (1609&#150;1675), banker, and his first wife, Marie Rosine (1616&#150;1646), daughter of Marc Conrad de Rehlingen, who like d'Hervart had been an adviser of Duke Bernard of Saxe-Weimar. His paternal ancestors were Lutherans from Augsburg, and his family, although established in France and associated with the Calvinist Huguenot minority there, maintained ties through marriage and business with Germany and Switzerland. Jean Henri and his elder brother, Barth&eacute;lemy, controller-general of finance under Cardinal Mazarin and Louis XIV, were instrumental in the transfer of Alsace to French sovereignty, and were rewarded with lands and honours in the region, including the barony of H&uuml;ningen, a frontier town on the Rhine just north of Basel. From about 1650 Jean Henri settled at Arles in Provence, where he established a marsh drainage project, but as a younger son Philibert entered military service as a captain in the regiment of Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, vicomte de Turenne (1611&#150;1675), commander of the French army in Germany. Roger Brulart, marquis de Puisieux, Herwarth's regimental superior and future antagonist, recalled later that he had been an impulsive pleasure-seeker, but a strong character, opinionated and persuasive.<br>
<br>Considered to have a greater aptitude for business than his older brother Bernard (1639&#150;<i>c</i>.1700), on their father's death in 1675 Philibert was named the principal heir, inheriting the drainage enterprise and the accompanying title of sieur des Marais. Bernard retained the title of Baron von H&uuml;ningen, although following the death without sons of their uncle Barth&eacute;lemy in 1676 it appears that partible inheritance accorded the barony to Philibert also; in the records he appears variously as M. Herwarth, M. d'Hervart, M. des Marais (especially in Geneva), and Baron von H&uuml;ningen or baron d'Huningue. In the next decade Philibert may have put his energies into managing the family business, but there are also indications that he travelled abroad. It has been claimed that in the later 1670s he entered English service and took his beliefs into Charles II's parliaments, voting for the exclusion of the Catholic duke of York from the succession to the throne. This assertion appears to arise from confusion of Herwarth with William Harbord, and the former was certainly never an MP, but there is evidence that he visited England, although perhaps not with a religious agenda. Writing to him in 1697, his sister, from whom he had become estranged, claimed that &#145;vous estes sorti du Royaume [de France] quelque temps avant que l'Edit de Nantes fut cass&eacute;&#146;, adding immediately, &#145;la religion a eu peu de part a vostre voyage en Angleterre&#146; (&#145;you left the kingdom some time before the edict of Nantes was broken. Religion had little part in your journey to England&#146;; letter of R&eacute;gine Sabine Baudan-Hervart, 16 Oct 1697, Walloon Library, Leiden, quoted by Kolmeschate). Herwarth is also said to have fought for the duke of Lorraine in Hungary.<br>
<br>By late 1685 all surviving members of the Herwarth family appear to have left France, like other Huguenots scattering to different destinations. Philibert's brother Jean Henri Herwarth, seigneur du Fort (1646&#150;1717&times;20), who had been deputy controller-general of finance in Paris, and his sister R&eacute;gine Sabine settled in Delft in Holland, where both soon married; their aunt Anne Marie, Madame Crassel, went to Geneva, her mother's city; their cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/93494/', "Esther d'Hervart, marquise de Gouvernet")</script>, took advantage of ties in England. Philibert probably took service with William of Orange, and by early 1689 he was certainly in London. Reportedly on the recommendation of Madame de Gouvernet's friend the marquess of Halifax, in March Herwarth was named English resident in the Genevan republic and extraordinary envoy to the Swiss confederation. At a time of acute international tension during the War of the League of Augsburg, the nomination provoked anger and consternation. In France the choice of a rebellious subject of King Louis to represent England caused offence in itself, but perceptions that he was a dangerously spirited and generous man made it all too likely that he would succeed in his mission of persuading the Swiss out of neutrality to join France's enemies. The tradition of mercenary employment in French as well as Dutch service complicated the confederation's position, while Geneva, always strategically and economically vulnerable to its powerful neighbours, feared retaliatory action from France.<br>
<br>As Herwarth was delayed first in London (a pass for his household was finally issued on 6 August) and then in The Hague, rumours abounded: he had sustained a headwound falling downstairs; William was prevaricating. In Geneva the French resident, Charles d'Iberville, conferred worriedly with his superior Colbert de Croissy, advising against a plot to kidnap Herwarth <i>en route</i>, while the council, desperate to deflect him, sought support from their Swiss allies and their old friend Gilbert Burnet, bishop of Salisbury. However, on 22 December <span class="smallcap">NS</span> Herwarth and his brother du Fort slipped into Geneva from the lake, having travelled incognito through the territories of Zurich and Bern. They lodged &#145;privately&#146; at the home of a leader of the anti-French faction until Herwarth finally presented his official credentials on 1 January. Ten days later, amid continuing diplomatic posturing on all sides, he was escorted back on to a boat. His offers of much needed grain had been popular, and the secretary of state, Chouet, who wrote a memoir of the affair, paid tribute to his ready tongue, but the visit was completely abortive: however much admiration and even support there was for the new English king, Genevan councillors felt unable to defy Louis. By early February 1690 Herwarth was back in The Hague, but the mission reverberates through English, French and Swiss sources for some months.<br>
<br>Early in 1692 Herwarth's embassy was resurrected, on this occasion in order to replace Thomas Coxe as English resident in Bern, the most powerful Swiss canton and the most sympathetic to the interests of the anti-French alliance. Arriving in April, this time he stayed ten years and seems to have accomplished as much as was possible in a context where Swiss confessional divisions and cantonal rivalries played out against a background of European instability. An immediate problem confronting all in the region was the continuing transit of Huguenot refugees, whose permanent presence in the confederation was neither politically nor economically sustainable in any great numbers. In addition to individual acts of charity to refugees and applying pressure for a softer official policy, with Henri Massue de Ruvigny, Viscount Galway, Herwarth was a central figure in the 1693 plan to transfer Huguenots in Switzerland to a settlement in Ireland. He also played a critical role in giving sustenance to deserters from French service of all nationalities, in encouraging Bernese military assistance to Geneva, and in persuading the Swiss into allied rather than French service, thereby contributing to William's war effort. Like other English ambassadors before him, he was, also with Galway, engaged by the fate of protestant minorities in Piedmont and the Grisons, again at crisis point. In 1699 and 1701 he was entrusted by the archbishop of Canterbury and others with the administration of funds raised in Ireland and England for the relief and the resettlement in Germany of displaced Vaudois, exploiting his longstanding banking contacts in Frankfurt; he continued to be active in this cause after his embassy ended.<br>
<br>By 1696 Herwarth was sufficiently established in Bern to marry into one of its leading patrician families. His young bride, Jedide Azube von Graffenried (<i>bap</i>. 1674, <i>d</i>. 1737), a relative of the secretary of state, brought a dowry of 45,000 livres tournois. This, and perhaps some command of German, put him, and by extension the English interest, at an advantage when in the same year the marquis de Puisieux was appointed French ambassador to Switzerland, having spent two decades sidelined as governor of H&uuml;ningen. Deprived of his lands there at the revocation, Herwarth doubtless had an axe to grind when he told his superiors in London that Puisieux was unequal to the task, but many French observers agreed. Although obliged to co-operate when it came to curbing Spanish and Savoyard ambitions in the region, the two represented opposed interests in the major issue of the next few years, the disputed succession to the protestant territory of Neuch&acirc;tel following the death of its ruler from the French Catholic Longueville family, the duchesse de Nemours.<br>
<br>The death of William III, greeted with dismay in protestant Switzerland, ended Herwarth's embassy. Despite having been naturalized in England in 1698, he moved to Vevey in the French-speaking Bernese territory of Vaud, where he was admitted to the bourgeoisie in 1702 and where there was a tightly knit immigrant community with many English links. He continued to seek English employment after moving about 1706 to The Hague. Hopes of patronage from the duke of Marlborough and the secretary of state, Henry St John, came to nothing, but in 1716 he finally returned to England. He settled at the house of a Mr Winter in Southampton, where his brother du Fort, now largely based at The Hague, had established a second home some years before. Both appear to have been keen to maintain a foothold in more than one country; both contributed to their adopted community in England. In 1717 du Fort altered his will to give 500 Dutch livres to poor refugees in Southampton, a provision honoured after Anglo-Dutch legal process in 1729. The year of the codicil du Fort's elder daughter married a Dutchman at Rijswijk, but soon afterwards his younger daughter Marianne (Anne Mary) (<i>bap</i>. 1688, <i>d</i>. after 1762) married N(icolas?) de Vatas, a London doctor.<br>
<br>In 1720 Philibert Herwarth succeeded Galway as governor of the French hospital in London. He died in Southampton on 30 April 1721 and was buried alongside his youngest son, Frederick (<i>c</i>.1716&#150;<i>c</i>.1720), in the parish church of Holyrood; his funeral was attended by a large crowd of French and English mourners. His will, drawn up in July 1720, instructed his wife and executors to invest much of her substantial dowry in Bank of India, South Sea, or other bonds for their children, as well as remembering the French conforming and dissenting churches in Southampton, their ministers, and the poor in their community; he had given &pound;4000 to the French hospital in memory of Frederick a few months earlier. Other legatees included his friend Jacques Robethon (probably the cousin of his fellow diplomat John Robethon, who succeeded Herwarth as governor of the hospital). His younger surviving son, Jacques Philippe (<i>bap</i>. 1706, <i>d</i>. 1764), who received a gold medal and miniature of King William, and a sword inlaid with gold, was to be sent to the cousins in the Netherlands, &#145;there to learn the Art of Warr the only profession of a Gentleman who in these unfortunate times can scarce apply himselfe to any thing else&#146;; &#145;born a Swiss&#146;, he could be advanced in their regiments  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/579). Having served as a captain of dragoons he eventually joined his mother and sister Sabine Fran&ccedil;oise in Vevey. Meanwhile the eldest children stayed in England, where both were married in 1723, Jean Fran&ccedil;ois Maximilien 
    (Maximilian; <i>c</i>.1697&#150;1762)
   to Marguerite Ang&eacute;lique de Vignolles, and Marianne Ursule 
    (Mary Ann; 1699&#150;1749)
   to the army officer and art collector John Guise. Through the eighteenth century business, marriage, and complex testamentary provision ensured that traffic between different branches of the family in Switzerland, the Netherlands, and England did not cease.<br>
