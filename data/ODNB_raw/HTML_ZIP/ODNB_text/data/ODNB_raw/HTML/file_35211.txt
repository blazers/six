<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Newbold, Sir  Douglas</span>  (1894&#150;1945), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born on 13 August 1894 at Tunbridge Wells, the seventh and youngest son of William Newbold (<i>d</i>. 1900) of Warwickshire and his wife, Eleanor Isabel Ferguson (<i>d</i>. 1942). His father's business interests took him frequently to the USA and Mexico. His mother was the daughter of Colonel David Ferguson of the American army, and she presided over their large family after her husband's death in 1900. In Tunbridge Wells, Newbold was the prankster and the favourite in the family of six brothers and four sisters, and his mother became the dominant influence in his life until her death. He never married. Within his close family in rural Kent, Newbold absorbed a romantic fascination with ancient archaeology that remained with him throughout his life in the more remote regions of the Middle East and the Sudan. In 1907 he followed his brothers to Uppingham School as a scholar. There his insatiable curiosity was strengthened by a deep appreciation of the human condition, symbolized by a fierce individualism that never left him. His success at Uppingham sent him to Oriel College, Oxford, in 1913 as a classical scholar, but his career was interrupted in 1914 by the outbreak of the First World War and a commission in the Dorset yeomanry and the cavalry machine-gun corps. He served in Mudros in Greece, in Egypt against the Senussi in 1915, and also in Palestine, where he was wounded at Zeitun after the fall of Gaza in November 1917. His time in the Middle East, supported by a thorough knowledge of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, also proved to be of scholarly interest that led to his study of the classical and Arab medieval geographers.<br>
<br>After the war Newbold returned to Oxford and Oriel for another year before joining the Sudan political service whose administration in the remote regions of the Nile basin appealed to his romantic temperament. He arrived in the Sudan in 1920 and was sent to the Kordofan province as an assistant district commissioner where, aided by his Arabic studies, he began to fulfil his ambition to explore the remote regions of the country. He undertook exploration by camel and car into the Libyan desert in 1924, 1927, and 1930 in search of the legendary oasis of Zerzura. His experience and success among the nomads of the west resulted in his transfer to the Beja of the Red Sea hills in eastern Sudan, after a brief sojourn in Khartoum as deputy assistant civil secretary in 1924&#150;5. His fascination and fondness for the nomadic Beja (Rudyard Kipling's &#145;Fuzzy-Wuzzy&#146;) thereafter became the paramount interest of his life. His most happy years were those spent as district commissioner, nomad administrator, and deputy governor, Beja, from 1926 to 1932. His return to Kordofan as governor in 1933 made him the chief administrator of the nomadic peoples he had known as a young district commissioner. He was made an OBE in 1933. Promoted deputy civil secretary in 1938, he was also made a CBE. He was appointed civil secretary the following year, and remained in this post&#151;the chief administrative officer of Sudan&#151;until his death.<br>
<br>Newbold's years as civil secretary were devoted to war and political transition in the Sudan, during which he never lost his composure or his concern for the Sudanese. As a district commissioner and governor he had protected the Sudanese from commercial and political exploitation. In war he now defended them from foreign invasion and attempted to create institutions to satisfy their growing political aspirations without sacrificing the social benefits and individual liberties bestowed by paternal but autocratic imperial rule. During his early years he had established a close bond of affection and trust with the great tribal sheikhs which as civil secretary he had greater difficulty in retaining when challenged by younger, educated Sudanese aspiring for greater political control of Sudanese affairs. The Second World War and Newbold's death prevented progress towards self-government. As the chief executive officer of Sudan, he had to organize its defence and the campaigns against the Italians in Ethiopia and Libya, while continuing civil administration in the Sudan with limited human and material resources, all of which intruded upon his ideas for imperial reform and political innovation in which Western representative institutions were perhaps not the solution. Despite being made a KBE in 1944 in recognition for his service to the empire this conundrum troubled him deeply and was only partially resolved in 1945 by the convening of the advisory council for northern Sudan.<br>
<br>Newbold was an intellectual, but also an imperial and pragmatic administrator. An insatiable and prolific writer of letters, he was the author of many articles on exploration and archaeology which were published in <span class="italic">Antiquity</span>, the <span class="italic">Geographical Journal</span>, and <span class="italic">Sudan Notes and Records</span>. A selection of his letters, papers, and lectures were published in 1953 under the title <span class="italic">The Making of the Modern Sudan</span>. In these Newbold expressed his enthusiasm for education, not only to instil greater professionalism in British colonial administration, but also to lay the foundation for a new Sudan. He perceived &#145;a golden chance to use all our powers, moral, intellectual and physical, for the benefit of some of the finest people in the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He never lost sight of the need for educational advance as a condition of popular government and a responsible civil service. He was one of the most influential founders of the Khartoum University College.<br>
<br>Newbold did not recover after being thrown from his horse during an outing in Khartoum. Exhausted by the demands of war, the politics of the coming peace, and an abscess in his hip brought on by years of growing osteoarthritis, he died in the Khartoum Hospital on 23 March 1945 and was buried at Khartoum the following day. He left his library to Gordon Memorial College, now the University of Khartoum, where his portrait hangs.<br>
