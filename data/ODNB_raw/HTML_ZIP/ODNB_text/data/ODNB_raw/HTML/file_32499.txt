<span class="headword">Collier,  John</span>  (1850&#150;1934), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born at 18 Gloucester Road, Paddington, Middlesex, on 27 January 1850, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5921/', "Robert Porrett Collier, first Baron Monkswell (1817&#150;1886)")</script>, a distinguished lawyer and judge, and Isabella Rose (1815&#150;1886), daughter of William Rose Rose of Wolston Heath near Rugby and Daventry. Collier was educated at Eton College (1862&#150;5) and then at Heidelberg. Deciding against his intended career in the diplomatic service, he returned to England, where he worked, temporarily, in the city office of Sir John Pender of the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company. With the encouragement of his father, who himself was a capable amateur artist, Collier then studied at the Slade School of Fine Art, London, under Edward John Poynter. He remained there for three years after which he went to study in Munich and then in Paris under Jean Paul Laurens. His father also introduced him to Lawrence Alma-Tadema and John Everett Millais, from whom he received guidance and encouragement.<br>
<br>Collier first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1874, sending a study of a head. His portraits of Major and Mrs Forster, exhibited in 1877, attracted attention and helped establish him as a society portrait painter. Thereafter he exhibited annually&#151;sending a total of 140 pictures&#151;until his death (though he was never elected a member). He also exhibited 165 works at the Royal Society of Portrait Painters of which he later became vice-president. His output was prolific; over 1100 pictures are recorded in his sitter book and of these over eight hundred are portraits. His sitters included Anthony Ashley-Cooper, seventh earl of Shaftesbury, George Bernard Shaw, Sir Oswald Mosley, Henry Irving, Rudyard Kipling, first Earl Kitchener, and Ellen Terry.<br>
<br>Collier's methodical and faithful rendering of his subjects has led to comparisons with the work of Frank Holl, but some of his more imposing portraits are clearly reminiscent of Millais's statesmen. Collier's portraits of the naturalist Charles Robert Darwin (1881; Linnean Society, 1883 replica; NPG) and of the biologist Thomas Henry Huxley, whom he painted twice (1883; NPG; and 1890; Royal Society, London), are notable works. Collier also produced dramatic depictions of classical and historical scenes such as <span class="italic">Priestess of Delphi</span> (1891; Art Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide) and <span class="italic">A Glass of Wine with Caesar Borgia</span> (1893; Ipswich Art Gallery). During his own lifetime Collier's reputation also rested, in part, on his so-called &#145;problem pictures&#146;. Intended simply to be depictions of moments of domestic tragedy, contrary to his efforts, their interpretation was felt by many to be unclear; conundrums to be unravelled by the viewer. Of these, two examples are <span class="italic">The Prodigal Daughter</span> (1903; Usher Gallery, Lincoln) and <span class="italic">A Confession</span> (1902).<br>
<br>Collier married on 30 June 1879 Marian (1859&#150;1887), daughter of Professor Thomas Henry Huxley. She too had studied at the Slade and exhibited three works at the Royal Academy between 1880 and 1884. Having suffered from mental illness since the birth of their daughter Joyce in 1884, she was taken by Collier to Paris in 1887 in the hope of finding a cure. Tragically she died of pneumonia on 18 November 1887. In 1889 Collier married, with Huxley's blessing, Marian's youngest sister, Ethel Gladys. Owing to the rejection of the <span class="roman">Deceased Wife's Sister Bill</span> (finally passed in 1907) the marriage took place in Christiania, Norway. Their marriage was not warmly accepted by everyone; Collier's sister-in-law, Lady Monkswell, broke off all contact. With Ethel, Collier moved to North House, Eton Avenue&#151;a building he had commissioned from his brother-in-law, Frederick Waller. They had two children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64924/', "Laurence Collier")</script> and Joan.<br>
<br>Collier had various one-man exhibitions during his lifetime: an exhibition of landscapes at the Leicester Galleries in 1915; a retrospective show at the Sunderland Art Gallery in 1922; another at the Museum Galleries, Haymarket, in 1931. He published various treatises on painting: <span class="italic">A Primer of Art</span> (1882), <span class="italic">A Manual of Oil Painting</span> (1886), and <span class="italic">The Art of Portrait Painting</span> (1905). His writings encouraged a strict, practical, accurate approach, thoroughness and attention to detail being rated above artistic flair.<br>
<br>The obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> described him as &#145;a thin, bearded man, he gave the impression of polite independence&#151;a sort of quiet ruthlessness&#151;in personal intercourse, a character which was undoubtedly reflected in his painting&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12 April 1934). Collier was one of the few rationalists of the Victorian establishment. He published his views on religion, morality, and citizenship in <span class="italic">The Religion of an Artist</span> (1926). During the First World War he was employed by the Foreign Office as a clerk in the deciphering department. He was appointed OBE for his services.<br>
<br>Collier died on 11 April 1934 at his home, North House, in Eton Avenue. He had suffered from paralysis for years but worked right up until his death installing a lift in North House so that he could get to his studio, from where he worked from his wheelchair using brushes tied to bamboo staves. His second wife survived him.<br>
<br>Collier, who has no fewer than thirteen works in the National Portrait Gallery, London, is also represented in numerous other collections including the National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin, Brighton Art Gallery, Southampton City Art Gallery, the Tate collection, and the Guildhall Art Gallery, London.<br>
