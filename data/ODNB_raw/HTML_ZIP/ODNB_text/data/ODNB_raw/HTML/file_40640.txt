<span class="headword">Hatsell,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1667), <span class="occ">naval official and politician</span>, was probably born in Plymouth of a commercial family. He married at Barnstaple on 6 February 1637 Margaret Dawe, with whom he had at least one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12601/', "Sir Henry Hatsell (bap. 1641, d. 1714)")</script>, later baron of the exchequer. He became a freeman of Plymouth in 1641, and after the outbreak of civil war was commissioned as an army officer on the side of parliament. By April 1645 he was a captain in the Plymouth garrison, and lent the committee of safety &pound;50 to help sustain the defence against the besieging royalists. After the victories of Sir Thomas Fairfax in the south-west in 1646 Hatsell was able to act on a wider stage for the parliamentary cause, beginning work for the navy in a variety of locations. He was imprisoned by the royalists in Jersey and the Isles of Scilly in 1649, and on his release became pressmaster at Minehead. After moving to Plymouth he first made a significant impression in April 1651 when his promptness and efficiency in assembling men and boats helped General Robert Blake embark nine companies of foot for a successful campaign in the Isles of Scilly against the desperate royalists. Hatsell gave a personal account of the campaign to the House of Commons, which he delivered on 13 June.<br>
<br>In 1652 Hatsell was appointed naval agent at Plymouth, a position he held with that of check of customs there. This gave him an unrivalled authority in maritime affairs in the south-west, with a degree of initiative more appropriate to the post of navy commissioner. His routine problems of recruiting for the navy over far-flung territory and providing it with <i>mat&eacute;riel</i>, often from unsympathetic or self-interested suppliers, were punctuated by consultations with the generals-at-sea, who evidently valued his expertise and godly commitment to the republic. He nominated men for naval captaincies, often with comments on their godly qualities. After the dismissal of the Rump Parliament, Hatsell retained his post and his importance was enhanced with a place on the bench of magistrates in Devon. He survived the transition to the protectorate, and in 1654 became a commissioner for ejecting &#145;scandalous&#146; ministers.<br>
<br>Fierce hostility to the drink trade and other vested interests in Plymouth made Hatsell a natural ally of John Disbrowe in his tour of duty as major-general for the south-western counties in 1655&#150;6. Hatsell was appointed commissioner under him, given command of a militia troop, and helped manage the trials of the Penruddock rebels. He was responsible for arranging the transportation to Barbados of a number of people implicated in these disturbances. His religious outlook accorded with that of the regime, although his antipathy to Quakers, including James Nayler, indicates that his tolerance was not unlimited.<br>
<br>From 1651 Hatsell sought to recover sums he had laid out in the service of parliament by acquiring the properties of sequestered royalists and, when available, crown estates. The most important of these was Saltram House, Plympton St Mary, home of the royalist Bagge family, which Hatsell occupied by 1656. With his new estate went status of another kind: he was elected to sit for Devon in the 1654 parliament and in 1658 for Plympton and Tavistock, choosing the former. In the House of Commons he was named to a wide range of committees, with matters of trade, revenue, and religious provision in the south-west being dominant among them. In March 1657 he was among those attending Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell on the details of &#145;The humble petition and advice&#146;. He spoke frequently, took an interest in procedural matters, and resisted moves to allow the &#145;other house&#146; to resume the title and privileges of the House of Lords lest it allowed the king to return. Hatsell was active in resisting moves towards monarchy in 1659, and ordered part of the western squadron to Chester Water to prevent help reaching Sir George Booth by sea. When the Restoration did come, he was slow to recognize the implications for his career. He lost all local government office, but stayed for the time as navy agent. Imprisoned at Exeter early in 1661, he returned to his post in February until he was dismissed in September. He may have married, on 17 June 1661, Susanna Evanse. Throughout the 1660s until his death he was identified by the government as one who might cause trouble, but in fact he retired to Saltram. He died there in 1667 and was buried at Plympton St Mary on 19 March. The family lost Saltram at his death.<br>
