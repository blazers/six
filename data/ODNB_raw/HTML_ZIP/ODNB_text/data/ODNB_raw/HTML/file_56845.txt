<span class="headword">Belet,  Michael</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1247), <span class="occ">royal servant</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1986/', "Michael Belet (d. 1201)")</script>, the justice of Henry II's reign, and Emma de Chesney. An Oxfordshire man who was in royal service by 1198, Belet was styled &#145;master&#146; by 1201, indicating a university training, very possibly at Oxford. In 1200 he was described as a clerk of the king's household, and in 1206 he undertook to pay &pound;100 for the office of assistant royal butler, which went with the serjeanty he held in West Sheen, Surrey. He continued in royal service until 1208, when his promising career was cut short, presumably as a result of the interdict. In any event, in 1211 he was charged with 500 marks as a fine for the king's benevolence. Despite his absence from the royal circle for at least three years, he was still able to muster an impressive list of the king's <i>curiales</i> in support of his fine. By this year his nephew of the same name had reached his majority, and Michael lost his serjeanty to him.<br>
<br>The younger <a name="cosubject_56845"></a><span class="headword">Michael Belet</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1219)<span class="occ"></span> was a son of Robert Belet (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1205), Michael's younger brother. In November 1215 and July 1216 his lands were confiscated, presumably because he had joined the rebel cause, but on 16 April 1217 he regained some of them, which must have included the serjeanty at West Sheen, and on 2 July 1217 he received letters of safe conduct for his reconciliation with the new administration. By 1219 he was dead, and had been succeeded in his lands by his daughter Matilda (the child of his marriage to Alice), who was a ward of Wimund de Raleigh. As well as the serjeanty in West Sheen, Michael Belet held lands in Bagshot, Windlesham, and Hook, Surrey, and Eastwood, Essex. Confusion between Master Michael and his nephew makes it difficult to establish which of them held particular lands. However it seems clear that Master Michael Belet was a considerable landholder. He was rector of Hintlesham, Suffolk, from September 1200, the advowson of which his father had acquired from King Richard; he was rector of Sebergham, Cumberland, from May 1204; and he was rector of Wroxton, Oxfordshire, from about 1215. He inherited from his brother, John Belet (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1204), land in Thorpe Belet, Northamptonshire, and a knight's fee in each of the vills of Syston, Aunsby, and Scott Willoughby, Lincolnshire, all held from the Ledet barony, and in September 1216 he received the confiscated lands of the rebel Wischard Ledet in Northamptonshire. He also held land in Norfolk, while with Walter de Verdun, the husband of his sister Annora, he owned land in Balscott, Oxfordshire. In Wroxton he held a knight's fee, inherited from John Belet, and here, between 1215 and 1222 (probably 1216 or 1217) he founded an Augustinian house for a prior and twelve canons, which evidently caused dissension within the family, as Walter de Verdun appears to have hoped to succeed to the property. Belet endowed the priory with his lands in Wroxton, in Syston, Lincolnshire, and in Thorpe Belet, Northamptonshire, and also with the chapel of Balscott, and the advowson of Syston and Aunsby.<br>
<br>Master Michael Belet appears again in royal service in January 1224, when he was given custody of the temporalities of the bishopric of Coventry, which he held until the appointment of the new bishop in May of that year. In February 1225 he was appointed a justice in Northamptonshire and in the following January he was appointed to audit the accounts for the fifteenth of 1225. After February 1226 little is known of his activities, and it may be supposed that he went into retirement. His final act in royal service was to officiate as assistant butler at the coronation of Eleanor of Provence in 1236, by right of his serjeanty in West Sheen, which he had clearly been able to reunite with the manor. By February 1247 he was dead. He was succeeded in West Sheen by Emma Oliver and Alice de Vautort, daughters and coheirs of John Belet.<br>
