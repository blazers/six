<span class="headword">Alison,  Francis</span>  (1705&#150;1779), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and college principal in America</span>, was born in the parish of Leck in co. Donegal, the son of Robert Alison, a weaver descended from emigrants from Scotland. His mother's name and ancestry are unknown. He may have received his early education at Francis Hutchinson's Presbyterian academy in Dublin. Later he went to Scotland where he graduated MA at the University of Edinburgh in 1733. He completed his preparation for the ministry by studying for the next two years, possibly at the University of Glasgow. Thereafter, he returned to Ireland where he was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Letterkenny. In 1735 Alison joined the large-scale Scots-Irish emigration to British America where he earned prominence as a minister, teacher, and citizen.<br>
<br>After serving for two years as a tutor in Talbot county, Maryland, Alison was ordained to the Presbyterian ministry and was installed as pastor of the New London congregation in Chester county, Pennsylvania, which he served from 1737 to 1752. Shortly after settling in New London in 1737, Alison married Hannah Armitage of New Castle, Delaware, who survived him. They had a daughter and three sons, two of whom predeceased him. The other, also Francis Alison, became a prominent physician. Alison's sermons demonstrated his reconciliation of Scottish Enlightenment philosophy with moderate Calvinistic theology. He preached clearly from notes that included numerous references to the scriptures. His parishioners appreciated his ministry. Most supported him against a revivalistic intruder into his parish and tried to prevent his departure in 1752. As the allegedly excessive emotionalism of the so-called &#145;great awakening of religion&#146; divided Presbyterians in America during the late 1730s and 1740s, Alison became a leader of the anti-revivalistic Old Side. Nevertheless, he worked for the reunification of the Old and New Side synods, which occurred in 1758.<br>
<br>Important as Alison's ministry was, he was even more significant in the field of education. Shortly after beginning his ministry he opened the New London Academy. The curriculum included Latin, logic, metaphysics, ethics, science, mathematics, and moral philosophy which Alison taught, basing his lectures on Hutchinson's teachings from the Scottish Enlightenment. The Old Side synod adopted the school as its seminary. It became so well known that it attracted and trained capable students who later became ministers, state governors, congressmen, teachers, and physicians. In 1752 Alison left New London to take charge of the Academy of Philadelphia. In 1755 he and the Scottish Anglican William Smith added a college, of which he became academic vice-provost. In 1779 the state's legislature changed the college's name to the University of Pennsylvania. The curriculum that he installed was similar to that of his New London Academy. Because of disagreements with Smith and other problems, in 1766 he obtained funds for and chartered an academy in Newark, Delaware, which became the basis for that state's university.<br>
<br>During Alison's years in Philadelphia he served also as assistant minister of the city's Old Side First Presbyterian Church. His concern for his denomination's clergy and their dependants led him to establish in the mid-1750s the Presbyterian Ministers Fund, America's first life insurance company. With most other Presbyterians he worked against Benjamin Franklin's campaign of the mid-1760s to transform proprietary Pennsylvania into a royal colony, fearing that the change would lead to the legal establishment of the Church of England. As a Presbyterian, he also opposed the Church of England's attempt to secure the appointment of a bishop for the colonies, remembering that in his native Ireland bishops, who exercised not only ecclesiastical but also political powers, had discriminated against dissenters. In 1766 he formulated, with Connecticut Congregationalists, the &#145;convention for religious liberty&#146;. As a staunch supporter of religious freedom, he opened his schools to students of all denominations and nationalities. When the leading German Lutheran pastor in Pennsylvania, Henry Melchior Muhlenberg, attempted to have inserted into Pennsylvania's 1776 constitution a clause to exclude Jews from voting, Alison successfully opposed him.<br>
<br>During and after Alison's lifetime he received numerous honours and testimonies to his achievements and character. In 1756 the University of Glasgow awarded him the honorary degree of doctor of divinity. Ezra Stiles, president of Yale College, called him America's most learned scholar of the classics. According to William Smith, provost of the College of Philadelphia, he was capable of holding any academic post in the country. Bishop William White emphasized his impeccable integrity. Never strong physically, Alison died in Philadelphia on 28 November 1779.<br>
