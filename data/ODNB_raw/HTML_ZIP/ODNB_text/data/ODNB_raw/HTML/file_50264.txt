<span class="headword">Boulers,  Reginald</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1459), <span class="occ">bishop of Coventry and Lichfield</span>, claimed, on the evidence of the heraldic devices on his seals, a connection with the Butler earls of Ormond and Wiltshire, but his family background is otherwise unknown. He was a doctor of theology (probably of Oxford) by 1437, a monk of the Benedictine abbey of St Peter, Gloucester, and may be the monk &#145;Reynolds of Gloucester&#146; who is recorded as delivering a sermon at Oxford <i>c</i>.1432. Royal assent to his election as abbot of Gloucester was granted on 29 October 1437. On 21 November 1440 Henry VI wrote to Pope Eugenius IV (<i>r</i>. 1431&#150;47), recommending Boulers for the vacant see of Llandaff, but by 25 December Boulers had declined the offer, presumably in order to stay at the wealthier abbey of Gloucester, and Henry wrote again to the pope, proposing Nicholas Close (<i>d</i>. 1452) instead.<br>
<br>During the 1440s Boulers came to be regularly employed as both a diplomatic envoy and a member of the king's council. He was part of the embassy that attended the Reichstag held at Frankfurt am Main to discuss ecclesiastical affairs between March and July 1442, and reported back to the council on 21 August; he was commissioned to go as king's proctor to Rome in August 1444, but then ordered to stay in England; on 12 March 1445, together with Bishop Thomas Beckington of Bath and Wells (<i>d</i>. 1465), he informed the papal nuncio of the English clergy's offer of a voluntary grant of 6000 ducats in place of taxation; and on 30 January 1448 he was appointed a member of the plenary embassy to negotiate with the French. He became a regular attender at the council from 1445, and was one of the most frequent witnesses to acts of state.<br>
<br>In parliament in February 1449 Boulers presented, on behalf of Edmund Beaufort, duke of Somerset, the duke's &#145;credence&#146; which raised the issue of the insecurity of the English position in France in the light of French preparations for a renewal of the war. He was further associated with the government's war effort as one of three commissioners appointed on 18 August 1449 to raise loans on security of certain royal jewels in order to supply Normandy. His close association with the failed Lancastrian policy in France, together perhaps with some underlying anti-clerical feeling and local disputes in Gloucester, left Boulers particularly exposed to attack during the period of popular unrest which beset England in the wake of a series of disastrous reverses in France. In 1449&#150;50 people from Gloucester despoiled the abbey's manor of Wynyards, Gloucestershire, and denounced Boulers for his part in the disasters in France, and in 1450 he was clearly regarded by several groups of critics as a central figure in the reviled government. He was targeted for execution by rebels both in Kent and at Westminster in January 1450; identified as a traitor by discontented royal and magnate retainers in June; satirized in a contemporary ballad for his association with the murdered duke of Suffolk; possibly indicted to commissions of inquiry by supporters of Jack Cade, both in London in July and in Kent in August; and included in a petition submitted in the parliament of 1450&#150;51 which requested that twenty-nine named persons should be debarred for life from coming within 12 miles of the king. At the height of his unpopularity, in September 1450, Boulers, together with John (VI) Sutton, Lord Dudley, fled to Ludlow to seek the protection of Richard, duke of York, whose support may at the time have seemed the best guarantee of survival.<br>
<br>In the event, Boulers not only survived the crises of 1450 but saw his career prosper with no interruption during the next decade. Amid the turmoil he had actually been papally provided to the bishopric of Hereford on 14 August 1450; he received the temporalities on 23 December and was consecrated on 14 February 1451. He was translated to the see of Coventry and Lichfield on 7 February 1453. He was, with others, acquitted of any offence by the Lords in March 1451, and resumed his political role. On 9 January 1452 the duke of York invited Boulers and John Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury (<i>d</i>. 1453), his most distinguished neighbours, to Ludlow to hear his declaration of loyalty to Henry VI in advance of the duke's armed demonstration against his rival, the duke of Somerset, at Dartford, Kent. In the wake of this confrontation Boulers was a member of a panel commissioned on 13 March 1452 to arbitrate between the two dukes; nothing came of this. On 23 March 1454 he was included by the Lords in parliament in the carefully chosen delegation to visit Henry VI, then incapacitated by a severe mental collapse, at Windsor. When the delegation reported back two days later, its leader, William Waynflete, bishop of Winchester (<i>d</i>. 1486), deferred to Boulers in reporting the outcome, because Boulers had actually undertaken the hopeless task of gaining a response from the king.<br>
<br>Boulers may, like a number of other lords, have been somewhat wary of involving himself too closely with the duke of York's subsequent protectorate administration; he was equivocal about his membership of the council at a meeting held on 3 April 1454 and was chastised for his absence from a meeting of a great council on 1 July 1454, but it is by no means certain that he was definitively an opponent of the duke. Indeed Boulers was one of three mediators sent by Henry VI's council, probably in late April 1455, to meet with York and his Neville allies during the tense period that culminated in the first battle of St Albans (22 May 1455). He continued to attend the royal council even after the Yorkist victory and was appointed to the committee to consider the defence of Calais and Berwick in the parliament of 1455&#150;6.<br>
<br>Thereafter it became harder not to take sides, and Boulers went with the court. He certainly retained the confidence of the king, but much more significantly, that of Queen Margaret. On 28 January 1457 he was appointed to the council of Edward, prince of Wales. On 2 November 1457 he was named as a commissioner to investigate how the king might settle his debts. However, his episcopal register suggests that he may have withdrawn from his more active role in politics from 1456. He is never recorded thereafter as being in London, but indeed the court itself was rarely in the capital. More notably, after 7 June 1457 he is only ever found in his register at his episcopal manor of Beaudesert, Staffordshire. His rather brief will, which states that the bishop was too ill to particularize at greater length, was made at Beaudesert on 23 March 1459, and one of his bequests was of his five books of theology to his old abbey at Gloucester. He died shortly after the will was made, for it was proved on 10 April 1459. He had requested burial in the lady chapel of Lichfield Cathedral.<br>
