<span class="headword">Sellar,  Patrick</span>  (1780&#150;1851), <span class="occ">sheep farmer and agent of highland clearances</span>, was born on 5 December 1780 in Elgin, Moray, the only son of Thomas Sellar (1754&#150;1817), solicitor, and his wife, Jean Plenderleath, daughter of the minister of college church in Edinburgh. His father, originally from Banffshire, practised successfully in Elgin, served the needs of local landowners, and entered their ranks when he bought the estate of Westfield in 1808. Patrick Sellar was educated at Edinburgh University for a legal career and he entered his father's business in 1803. His father joined a consortium for the reconstruction of harbour facilities at Burghead, in Moray, in 1805. Another partner was William Young, a local farmer and improvement entrepreneur.<br>
<br>In 1809 Sellar and Young began to give advice to Lady Stafford (Elizabeth Leveson-Gower), who was already embarked upon ambitious plans for the improvement of her vast highland estates in Sutherland. In 1810 they were appointed to manage the estate; Sellar was mainly responsible for rent collection and removals. Their policies entailed the massive rearrangement of the population and the land use, emptying extensive inland areas for sheep farms and creating a new coastal economy of crofters. These plans required the eviction of many thousands of small tenants, who resented the changes. Sellar acquired first a large arable farm and then complicated his role by bidding successfully for a large new sheep farm in Strathnaver.<br>
<br>Already responsible for removals in 1812, Sellar himself became the target of fierce hostility following particularly severe removals in Strathnaver in the middle of 1814. Over the following eighteen months various allegations emerged against him and he was eventually tried, in sensational circumstances, for acts of gross inhumanity, including culpable homicide, at Inverness in April 1816. He was alleged to have caused the deaths of several small tenants by setting fire to their houses in the course of the 1814 clearances. He was tried by a jury of landowners from outside Sutherland under Judge Pitmilly, and was completely exonerated. He routed his accusers and the removals were later completed under James Loch and Francis Suther. However, the controversy did not abate.<br>
<br>Sellar's employers, who regarded him as undiplomatic and harsh in his dealings with the people of Sutherland, soon eased him out of the Sutherland management. Sellar remained as their most reliable, but also their most disputatious, tenant and one of the greatest sheep farmers in the highlands. His house in Morvich was the centre of his activities. He was widely respected as an agricultural adviser and an expert on sheep. He was influential in establishing wool and sheep markets in the northern highlands, and in the formation of the Sutherland Association of Farmers. In 1819 he married Anne, daughter of Thomas Craig of Barmuckty, Elgin; they had nine children. Members of his large family were successful in several fields of Victorian society, and they conducted business in England, Australia, and the United States.<br>
<br>Between 1838 and 1844 Sellar bought the estates of Ardtornish and Acharn in Morvern in Argyll, paying &pound;29,850 for 21,575 acres. He evicted 230 people and stocked the lands with Cheviot sheep from Sutherland. He thus established himself as a laird in his own right but, argumentative and combative by nature, he soon quarrelled with his new neighbours. His family played host at Morvern to Francis Palgrave, Alfred Tennyson, Herbert Spencer, Benjamin Jowett, and George Eliot. To the continuing fury of his family, his reputation and his memory were repeatedly sullied, especially by recurrent claims that he had been guilty of the charges unsuccessfully levelled against him in 1816.<br>
<br>Sellar came to personify the entire process of the highland clearances. He was always severely critical of the old highland ways and thought the highlanders should emigrate for everybody's sake. He advocated the suppression of Gaelic and the compulsory teaching of English. He had an exceptionally sharp turn of phrase and a caustic intelligence. After a long illness he died on 20 October 1851 at Park Place, Elgin, and was buried in the churchyard of Elgin Cathedral on 1 November.<br>
<br>The third son of Patrick and Anne Sellar was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25056/', "William Young Sellar")</script>, professor of Latin in Edinburgh University. Their seventh son was <a name="cosubject_25054"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Craig Sellar</span>  (1835&#150;1890), <span class="occ">advocate and politician</span>. He was educated at Rugby School and graduated from Balliol College, Oxford, in 1859; he joined the Scottish bar in 1862. In June 1870 he married Gertrude Joanna, daughter of Octavius Smith of Ardtornish. He was appointed assistant commissioner to the education (Scotland) commission in 1864, and was legal secretary to the lord advocate of Scotland from 1870 to 1874. He was MP in the Liberal interest for the Haddington burghs from 1882 to 1885, before which he had been unsuccessful candidate for Devonport. He was an energetic party organizer but split from Gladstone over Ireland. In 1885 he was elected for the Partick division of Lanarkshire, whose electorate he regarded as somewhat turbulent, and was re-elected in 1886. He joined the Liberal Unionist Party in 1886 and was party whip from 1886 to 1888. He wrote on parliamentary reform, but his promising career was abbreviated by his early death, on 16 January 1890 at Parham Park, Pulborough, Sussex; his wife survived him. He was buried in Elgin Cathedral.<br>
