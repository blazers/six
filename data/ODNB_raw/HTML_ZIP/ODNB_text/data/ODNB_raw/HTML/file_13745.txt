<span class="headword">Hopkins,  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1602&#150;1657), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was probably born in Elton parish, Herefordshire, one of the seven children of Edward Hopkins and his wife, Katherine, who was the sister of Sir Henry Lello, a prosperous overseas trader. A benevolent uncle without children of his own, Sir Henry patronized his sister's family. He probably paid to educate the elder son, Henry, at Cambridge, he dowered his nieces, and he financed Edward's start as a merchant with a gift of &pound;400. At Lello's death in 1629, Edward's brother Henry inherited the manor of Thickoe in Essex and became warden of the Fleet prison and keeper of the palace of Westminster, an ancient and profitable government sinecure that Lello had purchased for about &pound;15,000. Edward himself inherited shares in the East India Company.<br>
<br>At some time in his youth Hopkins rejected &#145;the mixt fellowships, and other pollutions&#146; of the Church of England and attached himself to the puritan movement  (E. Hopkins and W. Goodwin, &#145;The epistle to the reader&#146;, [T.] Hooker, <span class="italic">A Survey of the Summe of Church-Discipline</span>, 1922). He solidified that connection in 1631 when he married Ann Yale (1615&#150;1698), a young woman noted in puritan circles for her intense piety. She was the daughter of Thomas Yale and Ann Yale (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Lloyd), and by 1631 the stepdaughter of Theophilus Eaton, one of the founders of the Massachusetts Bay Company. Unfortunately, Ann Hopkins suffered from debilitating fits of depression that led eventually to insanity. Hopkins and his wife tried various cures, including medicinal waters, but nothing worked and Hopkins was never entirely able to resign himself to &#145;this sad and great tryall which almost overwhelmes my spiritt&#146;  (Edward Hopkins to John Winthrop, 21 June 1648, <span class="italic">Winthrop Papers</span>, 5.231). Hopkins and his wife had no children.<br>
<br>Hopkins joined the puritan exodus to New England in 1637 and soon settled in Hartford in the Connecticut River valley. He was involved in the emerging government of the river settlements and from 1640 he was elected almost every year as governor or deputy governor of Connecticut, often serving alongside, or in alternation with, John Haynes. He was especially important in developing the colony's economy, in helping to establish the confederation of New England, in negotiating secure boundaries with the Dutch in New Netherland, and in adding the Saybrook settlement to Connecticut. Never entirely happy in New England, Hopkins returned to England in 1652 and was quickly employed by the Commonwealth government as a naval commissioner, in which capacity he impressed sailors, collected medical supplies, paid wages, and inspected timber, among other numerous duties. He performed so well that he was named an admiralty commissioner in 1655, with a rise in salary. That same year, on the death of his brother Henry, he inherited the manor of Thickoe and the wardenship of the Fleet prison. Elected to the House of Commons for Dartmouth in 1656, he served usefully on various committees concerned with trade and the war with Spain but did not sign the protest against the way the parliament had been packed and took no part in the debate about offering a crown to Cromwell.<br>
<br>Hopkins probably contracted tuberculosis in his youth and his health was in rapid decline by late 1656. On 7 March 1657 he wrote his will and within a week, on 13 March, he died. He had amply provided for his &#145;deere distressed&#146; wife so that she lived out a widowhood of forty years in material comfort until her death on 14 December 1698  (<span class="italic">New England Historical and Genealogical Register</span>, 38.315&#150;17). Hopkins also left a large trust fund for the education of young men in New England, part of which was used to found the Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven, Connecticut.<br>
<br>Hopkins was fortunate to start life under the patronage of a rich uncle but he greatly improved that advantage. Energetic and competent, he could have wanted no better epitaph than the words of an associate: &#145;Mr. Hopkins &hellip; whom we all know to be a man that makes conscience of his words as well as his actions&#146;  (Edward Winslow to John Winthrop, 2 Aug 1644, <span class="italic">Winthrop Papers</span>, 4.453).<br>
