<span class="headword">Master, Sir  Streynsham</span>  (1640&#150;1724), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born on 28 October 1640, probably at the family home of East Langdon, near Deal, Kent, the thirteenth child and eighth son of the twenty children of Richard Master (1604&#150;1669), landed gentleman, and his wife, Anne (1606&#150;1705), daughter of Sir James Oxenden. Master was relatively well educated. At the age of eight he attended Mr Latham's school at Sutton, and in 1654 he was taught by a Mr Cullen and a Mr Brett. He went to Canterbury in 1655 to study under a Mr Powndall, and in the same year proceeded to London, where he was taught by Mr Thomas Fox.<br>
<br>On 4 April 1656, at age fifteen, Master proceeded to India with his uncle and godfather George Oxenden, arriving at the East India Company's Surat factory (trading station) in November. In January 1659 Oxenden returned to England, leaving Streynsham under the charge of his brother Christopher Oxenden. That year Master was employed as cape-merchant on a voyage to the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, returning to Surat in December. There, in January 1660, he was appointed a company factor, and was employed subsequently both at Surat and, from May to December 1662, at Ahmadabad.<br>
<br>In 1668 Master was appointed warehouse keeper and a member of the Surat council, and in September 1668 he was one of the company's commissioners who received the charge of the island of Bombay from the king's officers. At Surat, where the company's accounts were in a state of confusion, Master devised a new, efficient system of bookkeeping that was subsequently adopted at other factories and &#145;had a commanding influence on the public accounts of the English in India for a long time afterwards&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 1.2).<br>
<br>Later in 1668 Master sailed south to resettle the company's factors at Karwar and Calicut, where he narrowly escaped with his life during a Moplah riot. In 1664, and again in October 1670, he was involved in the defence of Surat from the attacks of the Maratha leader Shivaji. On Master's return to England in June 1672 he was awarded a gold medal by the company in recognition of his gallant defence of the factory during the 1670 attack. Soon after his arrival in England he purchased the estate of Wallett's Court, near Dover, and on 17 May 1674 he married Diana, daughter of Sir Thomas Bendyshe, bt, of Bumsted, Essex. However, she died later that same year.<br>
<br>On 10 September 1675 Master was appointed to succeed Sir William Langhorne as agent and governor of Fort St George (Madras) when the latter's term of office expired in January 1677, until which time Master was to serve as second in council. Master sailed for India on 8 January 1676, and arrived at Fort St George on 7 July. His own proposals for the better administration and regulation of the company's factories were incorporated into his commission, and shortly after his arrival he set off again on a tour of inspection of the factories at Masulipatam and Bengal, not arriving back at Madras until 17 January 1677. When Langhorne returned to England at the end of that year Master formally succeeded him and made significant improvements in the administration at Madras. Perhaps his two most enduring accomplishments at Madras were the founding, in 1678, of the Anglican church of St Mary in the Fort, the first English church in India, and, secondly, the establishment in August 1683 of a court of judicature.<br>
<br>In common with many other company employees at this time, Master engaged in considerable private trading. In particular, he dealt in diamonds, and built up a considerable fortune thereby. In 1679 he again visited Masulipatam, and on 1 August of that year embarked for a tour to Bengal. The extravagant nature of these tours was one reason, or perhaps excuse, for the court's subsequent condemnation of him. Indeed, there is evidence of a largely unwarranted conspiratorial opposition to Master within East India House, an opposition which even gained the support of the king at one time. As a consequence, Master was formally dismissed his post on 3 July 1681 and the agency transferred to William Gyfford. Master was permitted to remain at Madras one year longer in order to settle his affairs before returning to England a wealthy man. However, he was never able to recover the substantial sums of money which were left owing to him at Madras. In September 1682 the company filed a suit in chancery against him, and it was not until October 1691 that the case was settled out of court to Master's advantage.<br>
<br>On 25 September 1690 he married, secondly, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1714), daughter of Richard Legh of Lyme, Cheshire. They had three children: Anne (1691&#150;1788) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6475/', "Coventry, Anne")</script>], Legh (1694&#150;1750), and Streynsham (1697&#150;1759). Although Master and his family resided mainly at their house in Red Lion Square, Holborn, London, in 1692 he also purchased the estate of Codnor Park, Derbyshire, and in 1698 he sold Wallett's Court and acquired Stanley Grange, near Morley, Derbyshire. Also in 1698 he was appointed one of the directors of the &#145;new&#146; or &#145;English&#146; East India Company, and on 14 December of that year&#151;at which time Master happened to be chairman of the court of directors&#151;he was knighted by King William at Kensington Palace. Master is also recorded as one of the trustees in the building of the church of St George the Martyr, Bloomsbury, London.<br>
<br>Sir Streynsham Master died on 28 April 1724 at New Hall in Lancashire, and was buried in a chapel of Macclesfield church. As Henry Yule concluded, he &#145;was a worthy, religious, methodical, and liberal man, and one of strong family affection&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of William Hedges</span>, 2.cclv). However, he was also clearly &#145;a strong man, who went his own way&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 1.129) and made enemies thereby.<br>
