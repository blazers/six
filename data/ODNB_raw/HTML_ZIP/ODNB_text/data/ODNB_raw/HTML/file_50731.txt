<span class="headword">Rochford family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1840&#150;1932), <span class="occ">horticulturists</span>, was founded by <a name="cosubject_50731"></a><span class="headword">Michael Rochford</span>  (1819&#150;1883)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born in Clandulla, co. Clare, Ireland, into a close-knit Roman Catholic family whose ancestors had lived in the Clandulla area for many generations. Little is known of his childhood but in keeping with the family tradition of emigration he moved to England in 1840 and found work as a gardener for Lord Nugent in Buckinghamshire, before becoming a steward for Lord Feversham in Yorkshire. At this stage he pioneered a number of improvements in glasshouse design, in particular the idea of glazing only the underside of the glass to save weight. On 16 July 1848 he married Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1906), daughter of Joseph Henry and Charlotte Mumford. <a name="cosubject_50733"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Rochford</span>  (1849&#150;1901)<span class="occ"></span>, their first son, was born on 15 April 1849. Then followed <a name="cosubject_50734"></a><span class="headword">John Rochford</span>  (1851&#150;1919)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 14 February 1851; Mary, born on 10 November 1852; Edmund, born on 16 November 1854; and <a name="cosubject_50732"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Rochford</span>  (1856&#150;1932)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 3 December 1856. In 1857 the family moved to Tottenham, Middlesex, to run a 2 acre market garden, where Michael became a specialist grower of early grapes. Five more children were born: twins, Michael and George (14 May 1859); Elizabeth (10 July 1861); Charlotte Catherine (29 September 1863); Lucy (28 September 1865); and George (14 August 1867), named in memory of George, one of the twins, who had died at the age of four.<br>
<br>Michael Rochford continued to build up a prosperous business, growing plants and flowers for a wealthy clientele. He was instrumental in raising the efficiency of glasshouse production with the aid of the &#145;Rochford boiler&#146; developed by his son Thomas, and through improvements in the ventilation system. When cheap imported grapes reduced the demand for his more expensive home-produced crop, Michael diversified into more popular indoor plants which were distributed through London agents. He continued to expand his business empire and was an eminent nurseryman in his own right. He died at his home, Stamford Road, Tottenham, on 29 January 1883, leaving the business in the capable hands of his son John. Thomas and John later became more famous than their father as nurserymen.<br>
<br>Thomas Rochford, the most renowned of all the family, left his father's nursery and went to work as a trainee gardener for James Sweet. In August 1876 he married Mary Ann Agnes (1854&#150;1932), daughter of Samuel Straight, ivory cutter, and his wife, Agnes, and moved to nearby Northumberland Park, where he established a nursery in 1882. In 1884 he acquired from his brother Joseph 4 acres of the Turnford Hall estate, Cheshunt, Hertfordshire; in 1887 he purchased Turnford Hall itself. Expansion rapidly followed with the buying of more land and glasshouses at Turnford. Thomas also played a key role in pioneering the use of refrigeration to retard the growth of plants and thus achieve out-of-season flowering.<br>
<br>By 1900 the glasshouses covered 22 acres, of which approximately half were devoted to growing grapes; the rest grew hothouse pot plants&#151;in particular lilies, orchids, and ferns. By the time of the marriage of Thomas's own son Thomas, he was one of the largest greenhouse growers in England, and his importance was recognized in 1901 with eight awards including two gold medals by the Royal Horticultural Society. His success was marred, however, by the discovery that he was suffering from Bright's disease, an incurable illness at that time, from which he died at Turnford Hall on 12 October 1901.<br>
<br>Joseph Rochford, although nationally less well known than his brother Thomas, had worked in conjunction with him until the latter's death. In 1881, following his marriage to Mary Margaret Leech, he had purchased the 8 acres at Turnford Hall estate, 4 acres of which he subsequently sold to his brother Thomas. He pioneered tomato growing in the Lea valley, and he also became wealthy as a result of astute property deals, buying land which was subsequently sold for housing. In 1902, on the death of his brother, he became chairman of Thomas Rochford &amp; Sons; he retained the position until his resignation in 1916. After the First World War he played a key role in helping to revitalize the fortunes of the firm. He died at Turnford on 29 June 1932.<br>
<br>John Rochford's career initially took a different path from that of his two brothers Thomas and Joseph. Following his father's illness and the move of his two brothers to the Lea valley, he remained in charge of the family nursery and rapidly became a well-known nurseryman in his own right. His first marriage was to Diana Benson, and after her death in 1892 he married Blanche Hindley. On the death of his brother Thomas, like his brothers Edmund and Joseph he became a director of Thomas Rochford &amp; Sons. He died at his home, Cedrus Lodge, Turkey Street, Enfield, Middlesex, on 15 December 1919.<br>
<br>One of Michael Rochford's other sons, Edmund, ran his own successful nursery at Cranbrook Street, Cheshunt, specializing in the production of hothouse plants. This unit was, however, considerably smaller and less well known than the Lea valley enterprises organized by his other brothers. Edmund was also involved as a director of the family firm. Following the death of his first wife, May Norwood, on 7 March 1911, he subsequently married Louisa Cudlipp. Another brother, Michael, named after his father, maintained his own nursery at The Ride, Ponders End, for several years prior to his death at the age of twenty-seven.<br>
<br>Michael Rochford senior was, in his youth, described as a tall lanky fellow with piercing eyes, a trait which became less noticeable in later years. Michael and his sons were rotund in appearance. The main branch of the family, associated with the Lea valley area, were large-scale employers who were widely regarded not only as nurserymen but also as committed to their workforce. In the late nineteenth century they were one of the largest glasshouse growers in Britain. In spite of experiencing mixed fortunes in the twentieth century, the firm of Thomas Rochford &amp; Sons, still run by the family, was internationally famous in the post-war period, particularly for the exhibitions it staged at the Chelsea flower show.<br>
