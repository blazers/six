<span class="headword">Horne,  Benjamin</span>  (1698&#150;1766), <span class="occ">coal factor</span>, was born on 8 September 1698 at Arundel, Sussex, the ninth of ten children of Thomas Horne (<i>d</i>. 1718), a glover of that town, and his wife, Susannah (<i>d</i>. 1734), both Quakers. In 1719 he set up in business in London as a coal factor&#151;buying coal by the chaldron or by the entire cargo from the northern colliers, and selling it into the City and suburbs. At first he operated from wharves east of the Tower; later he transferred to Billingsgate. At this time the Quakers were no longer being persecuted and Horne was among those who were able to prosper in business. About 1724 he married Mary (<i>c</i>.1707&#150;1782), daughter of Simeon Warner of Bermondsey, where they soon settled and raised seven children.<br>
<br>When the lightermen who brought the coal from ship to shore combined to demand premiums from the shipmasters, which greatly increased the price of coal to consumers, Horne and several other factors set up an office in the Dog tavern, Billingsgate, in 1728, to act as agents for the masters and evade these extra charges. Objections to the high price of coal by the principal industrial consumers&#151;brewers, soapboilers, and dyers&#151;led to the passing of an act in 1729 allowing any coal trader to maintain his own wharves, lighters, and other craft. This licence was of considerable benefit to such as Horne. When he gave evidence to a House of Commons inquiry in 1730 he claimed that with others he had a concern in over forty collieries to the value in 1727 of &pound;48,262. He also held a joint interest in collieries at West Denton, Northumberland, which he leased to a local operating miner.<br>
<br>In 1742 the customs department uncovered a huge fraud which had continued since 1724. It transpired that shipmasters left bonds with the factors to pay the customs duty when their deliveries had been assessed, so that they were not delayed from returning north. In fact many of these duties had never been paid, the factors having retained the bonds. Horne was one of those found to be owing considerable sums, though he was able to pay when charged. Horne later retired to High Cross, Tottenham, where he died on 25 May 1766. He was interred at the Quaker burial-ground, Long Lane, Bermondsey, leaving, it was said, an estate said to be worth over &pound;70,000  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 439).<br>
<br>Horne's eldest son, Thomas (1725&#150;1802), was apprenticed to his father's friend Caleb Smith, coal merchant of Bankside and his partner in the colliery venture. Smith was in the Clothworkers' Company and Thomas took his freedom by serviture in 1753, the first of a long line of Hornes to serve on the livery of that company; succeeding generations entered into various partnerships with other coal companies, and eventually became part of the Charrington group.<br>
