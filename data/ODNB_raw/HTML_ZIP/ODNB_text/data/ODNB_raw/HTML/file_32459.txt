<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Brock,  Arthur  Clutton-</span>  (1868&#150;1924), <span class="occ">essayist and journalist</span>, was born at Weybridge, Surrey, on 23 March 1868, the third son of John Alan Clutton-Brock, a banker, and his wife, Mary Alice, daughter of the Revd H. J. Hill. After attending Summerfields, Oxford, he went to Eton College with a scholarship in 1882; he then proceeded in 1887 to New College, Oxford. At Eton, where he won an English verse prize with an ode in the manner of Shelley, and still more at Oxford, Clutton-Brock developed his love of literature and art, and the wit of his conversation and the brilliance of his circle at the university were acknowledged by all who knew him. He obtained third classes in classical honour moderations (1889) and in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1891). On leaving Oxford he was apprenticed for a short time in a stockbroker's office, but was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1895, and practised for some years. Meanwhile his natural bent for writing revealed itself in a number of early essays and poems, some of which were printed in a posthumous collection, <span class="italic">The Miracle of Love and other Poems</span> (1926).<br>
<br>In 1903 Clutton-Brock married Evelyn Alice, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36645/', "Leveson Francis Vernon-Harcourt")</script>, civil engineer, and settled down to a life of regular literary and critical work. From 1904 to 1906 he was literary editor of <span class="italic">The Speaker</span> and a frequent contributor to the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>. This latter paper, which was founded in 1902, owed to him much of its early success and wide reputation; indeed, its editor went so far as to say that Clutton-Brock &#145;made it&#146;. After being art critic on <span class="italic">The Tribune</span> and the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> for a short time, in 1908 Clutton-Brock joined, as art critic, the staff of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, for which he wrote on many other subjects as well, ranging from gardening to religion, for the rest of his life. In 1909, at the age of forty-one, he wrote his first important book, which was also considered his best, <span class="italic">Shelley, the Man and the Poet</span> (materially revised in 1923). He also contributed an introduction to <span class="italic">The Poems of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span> (ed. C. D. Locock, 2 vols., 1911). Clutton-Brock combined a serious appreciation of Shelley's poetry with a sober survey of Shelley's life in a way which antagonized the poet's more devoted followers.<br>
<br>The profound joy which Clutton-Brock took in his own daily work led him to accept William Morris's aesthetic approach to socialism, and in 1909 he joined the Fabian Society. When the First World War broke out he had just completed an appreciation of Morris for the <span class="roman">Home University Library</span>. The war wrought a considerable, if not a radical, change in his outlook, making him less of an aesthete and more of a moralist. In a series of articles in the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> (republished as <span class="italic">Thoughts on the War</span>, 2 vols., 1914&#150;15; see also <span class="italic">The Ultimate Belief</span>, 1916) Clutton-Brock preached against turning patriotism into a religion, as he alleged the Germans had done. His outlook became more definitely Christian, and in articles and books from 1917 onwards he professed a religion of love, laughter, and beauty which, had he lived longer, might have established him as a religious philosopher. He continued to produce a series of essays on art, literature, and life, written more for pleasure than for profit, which represent his mature thought and culture. While he repudiated the criticism of art in terms of morals which he found in men like Ruskin and Tolstoy, yet art, literature, religion, and politics were indissolubly linked in his philosophy of life. Thus his earlier interest in Morris's socialism led, in later years, to an active involvement in the Farncombe Labour Party.<br>
<br>In his <span class="italic">Studies in Christianity</span> (1918) religion had given Clutton-Brock &#145;a buoyantly happy mood&#146;, but in 1919 he told his wife that &#145;he felt he had attained his religious optimism too easily&#146;, and at the time of his death he was still seeking a constructive philosophy of life. Hence his <span class="italic">Essays on Religion</span>, posthumously published in 1926, have been described by B. H. Streeter, in the introduction, as &#145;an unfinished torso&#146;. But although his work in this field thus remained imperfect, Clutton-Brock was placed by his contemporaries in the group of first-rate essayists which England produced in the first quarter of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>After three years of intermittent illness Clutton-Brock, died at his home, the Red House, Godalming, on 8 January 1924, leaving his widow and three sons, among them the art critic <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64265/', "Alan Francis Clutton-Brock (1904&#150;1976)")</script>. It was reported that his final act was to direct his physician's attention to the beauty of an iris.<br>
