<span class="headword">Jenkins,  Hugh Gater</span>, Baron Jenkins of Putney  (1908&#150;2004), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Blenheim Dairy, Lancaster Road, Enfield, Middlesex, on 27 July 1908, the only son of Joseph Walter Jenkins (1881&#150;1954), master dairyman, and his wife, Florence Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gater. They later had a daughter, Hugh's much loved sister Evelyn. Joseph Jenkins had moved from Wales to set up his north London business. By the 1930s he was a tobacconist. Jenkins, a choirboy in his local church when young, was educated at Enfield grammar school. On leaving school he had a period of unemployment that he did not forget. He then worked for the Prudential Assurance Company from 1930 to 1940. On 18 July 1936 he married (Ethel) Marie Crosbie (<i>d</i>. 1989), the 28-year-old daughter of Squadron Leader Ernest William Crosbie. This was a loving personal and political partnership that lasted until Marie's death. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>In 1938 Jenkins had volunteered for the Royal Observer Corps. In 1941 he was offered a commission in the RAF as an air traffic controller, with the rank of flight lieutenant. &#145;So I jumped and spent much of the next five years on the radio telephone telling our pilots the height, speed and direction they should fly to shoot the bombers down, first in daylight and later at night aided by radar&#146;  (H. Jenkins, &#145;Shall we get rid of war or will war get rid of us?&#146;, speech made to the Progressive League, Eastbourne, 29 August 1999). In 1945 he was sent to Burma to run the forces radio station in Rangoon. There he became unpopular with his superiors and even under the suspicion of the intelligence services because of his support for the Burmese nationalists. He spent his leave in 1945 actively working for the Labour Party during the election campaign of that year.<br>
<br>After his return to England and demobilization in 1947 Jenkins became the Greater London organizer of the National Union of Bank Employees and editor of the <span class="italic">Bank Officer</span>. He soon judged that the employees for whom he worked were too timid and would not &#145;get off their knees&#146;  (private information). Selected from a list of three hundred applicants, Jenkins then became the assistant secretary of the actors' union, Equity, in 1950. Having been a Fabian Society lecturer and director of Fabian summer schools in the late 1940s, in 1950 he unsuccessfully contested for the Labour Party the parliamentary constituency of Enfield, where his opponent was Iain Macleod. In 1955, by then a councillor for Stoke Newington and Hackney, he contested Mitcham for Labour but again lost. By this time he had acquired a high profile as a left-winger and Bevanite; he was chairman of Victory for Socialism in 1956&#150;60. He was most notably an active critic of nuclear weapons policies, as chairman of the H Bomb Campaign Committee in 1954, an Aldermaston marcher from 1957 to 1963, and a founder member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) in 1958. In 1964, to the considerable dismay of the Labour Party leadership at Transport House, he was selected by the local party to fight the Putney constituency. Some in the Labour Party management had no sympathy for left-wingers and CND activists. He nevertheless had the support of people like Richard Crossman and Anthony Greenwood, and was not deselected. After a spirited and clever campaign he took the seat and held it until the 1979 election, when he was defeated by David Mellor.<br>
<br>Jenkins devoted his maiden speech at Westminster to town planning and arts issues and later became a strong supporter of Jenny Lee, Harold Wilson's arts minister, and the widow of Jenkins's hero, Aneurin Bevan. In 1974 he became arts minister himself (as the under-secretary of state for education and science, with special responsibility for the arts), a post which he held for two years until removed by James Callaghan in 1976. He was an active minister. He promoted the National Theatre project and the development of civic theatre throughout the country. In his contribution to <span class="italic">Essays in Local Government Enterprise</span> (1964) he had written, &#145;it seems to me that the primary role of the municipality is the provision of a good theatre&#146;  (&#145;Towards the civic theatre&#146; in E. Hillman, ed., <span class="italic">Essays in Local Government</span>, 1964, 24). After his demotion in 1976 he did not hold office again.<br>
<br>After his defeat in the 1979 election Jenkins became the national chairman of CND, a movement which he had supported throughout his House of Commons career. He took over the chair of CND at a time of intense activity stimulated in particular by the proposed deployment of American cruise missiles in Britain, which had revived the debate about deterrence and civil defence. Though the nuclear weapon threat was always his primary concern in his later years he, like his contemporary Sir Joseph Rotblat, became more and more committed to the idea that war itself had to be eliminated. Indeed he so opposed the bombing by NATO of Serbia without United Nations approval during the conflict in the Balkans that he resigned from the Labour Party, returning to that fold only when hostilities had ceased.<br>
<br>When in 1981 he was made a life peer (as Baron Jenkins of Putney), on the recommendation of his old friend Michael Foot, Jenkins took his campaigns to the Lords. CND made him an honorary vice-president. In the Lords he spoke on many matters of social and international concern, but nuclear weapons issues were always his first priority. In part because of his skill in stretching the rules, a limit had to be laid down on the number of questions any peer could ask on one day. When the government tried to prevent the publication of Peter Wright's <span class="italic">Spycatcher</span>, an expos&eacute; of the intelligence service, Jenkins thwarted their efforts by reading large sections of it into the <span class="italic">Hansard</span> record.<br>
<br>Typical of the sense of humour that very rarely left Jenkins was his concluding entry in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span>. Under the &#145;recreation&#146; section, &#145;avoiding retirement&#146; was the last activity listed. In this aim he largely succeeded. Even when confined to a retirement home in Kew he did his best to stir up political interest among his fellow residents, by starting a discussion and debating society. On religious matters he remained a non-dogmatic agnostic.<br>
<br>A man of distinctive appearance, with ginger, later greying, hair and a neat beard, Jenkins was well known as a writer and broadcaster. While an MP and afterwards he contributed articles to a variety of journals including <span class="italic">Tribune</span>, the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, and <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>. His book <span class="italic">The Culture Gap</span> (1979) demonstrated again his keen interest in the arts as a popular and public concern. Most moving were his short plays for BBC radio, all of which had an autobiographical theme. Perhaps the best of them was <span class="italic">Solo Boy</span> (1983), which described his first experience of political pressure: as a very young choirboy he had been denied the sixpence owed to the boy who sang solo and as a consequence did his best to organize a walkout. <span class="italic">Lost Tune from Rangoon</span> (1987) was another hilarious true tale of a Christmas day when Jenkins left a Burmese civilian in charge of the radio station and went off for his Christmas dinner in the officers' mess. Immediately after the king's speech, to the rage of the top brass present, Jenkins's substitute put on a record of No&euml;l Coward's &#145;Mad Dogs and Englishmen&#146;. He also wrote poetry. In his short poem <span class="italic">Contradicting Dylan</span> he made it clear that he was not one for Dylan Thomas's &#145;raging&#146;. On the contrary, his own version read:<blockquote>
<div>Help me go gentle into that good night<br>
</div>
<div>I'll welcome quietly dying with the light.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Following the death of his first wife, on 19 April 1991 Jenkins married (Maria) Helena Esmeralda Wilson, a 64-year-old widow, a retired philosophy lecturer and daughter of Nicholas Pavlidis, architect. She died three years later, in 1994. Jenkins spent his last months at Lynde House nursing home, Meadowbank, Cambridge Park, Twickenham. To the end he remained a man of strong socialist conviction. Never personally confrontational, he bore no grudges and was well liked and admired even by those who did not share his world view. He died at Lynde House on 26 January 2004, of cerebrovascular and ischaemic heart disease.<br>
