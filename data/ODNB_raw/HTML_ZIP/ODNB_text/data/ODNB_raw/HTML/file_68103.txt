<span class="headword">Bantock,  Geoffrey Herman</span>  (1914&#150;1997), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born at 22 Layton Avenue, Blackpool, on 12 October 1914, the only child of Herman Sutherland Bantock (1874&#150;1965), musician, and his first wife, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bailey (1885&#150;1936). His father, a viola player, was a cousin of the composer Sir Granville Bantock. At Wallasey grammar school from 1924 to 1933 he gained distinctions in English and history, became head of school, and won borough and state scholarships to Cambridge. At Emmanuel College, Cambridge, he read history followed by English literature, was awarded an honorary senior exhibition in 1936, and completed his degree with an upper second in 1937. Like many contemporary students of English at Cambridge he was inspired by the reform of literary studies under the embattled F. R. Leavis and carried those ideals into the world of education, as a teacher at boys' grammar schools in Ealing and Ilford before his appointment in 1946 to a lectureship in English at the City of Leeds Training College. On 6 January 1950 he married one of his students at Leeds, who was to become a teacher, (Dorothy) Jean Pick (<i>b</i>. 1927), daughter of Robert Pick, master tailor.<br>
<br>While at Leeds, Bantock contributed to the journal <span class="italic">Scrutiny</span>, becoming its dominant voice on educational matters, and challenging concepts of planning, popularization, and freedom. These articles formed the core of his first book, <span class="italic">Freedom and Authority in Education: a Criticism of Modern Cultural and Educational Assumptions</span> (1952), which achieved what he described as &#145;a minor &#147;succ&egrave;s de scandale&#148;&#146;. Meanwhile he had been appointed to a lectureship at University College, Leicester, in 1950, in an education department which was soon to become notable for its progressive outlook and its leadership of the national campaign for comprehensive secondary schools. Bantock, however, stood his ground in defence of selective grammar schools for the intellectual &eacute;lite, and in opposition to progressivism. He was appointed reader in education in 1954, published a study of the novelist L. H. Myers (1956), and continued to write, for the educational press and for academic journals, philosophical critiques of progressivist educational thought and of modern educational methods. In his second major book, <span class="italic">Education in an Industrial Society</span> (1963), consolidating some of his previously published papers, he sought to define a differentiated curriculum appropriate to varying capacities. Against the background of a growing campaign for greater equality of opportunity in secondary schools this book was widely reviewed and generated considerable debate. In the following year he was promoted to the chair of education at Leicester. Bantock published further books and numerous articles in the later 1960s and 1970s.<br>
<br>Bantock's participation in educational campaigns from 1969 projected him into the fray of an impassioned public debate on educational policy. The <span class="italic">Critical Quarterly</span> had taken up the baton of cultural criticism laid down by <span class="italic">Scrutiny</span>, and, responding to a cultural crisis symbolized by the campus unrest of 1968, began to publish its polemical <span class="roman">Black Papers</span> on education, in which Bantock came to write regularly. His contributions over the years 1969 to 1977 included critiques of &#145;discovery methods&#146; and of teacher education. In this connection he was also a founding sponsor in 1972 of the National Council for Education Standards, a pressure group led by university lecturers and independent school headmasters. In 1975 he retired from his university post to bring to fruition his major research project, intended from early in his career, a history of progressive education. This work appeared as the two-volume <span class="italic">Studies in the History of Educational Theory</span>, vol. 1: <span class="italic">Artifice and Nature, 1350&#150;1765</span> (1980), and vol. 2: <span class="italic">The Minds and the Masses, 1760&#150;1980</span> (1984). Volume 2 was awarded a prize by the standing conference on studies in education.<br>
<br>The Leavisian influence on education in post-war Britain was great, effected in part through a number of prominent educationists, of whom Bantock became perhaps the best known. Other professors of education who had been touched by Leavis included William Walsh and Boris Ford, and, of a younger generation, Brian Cox and A. E. Dyson, originators of the <span class="roman">Black Papers</span>. Although differing from this group in many particulars, Bantock shared with them a belief in the values of high culture conveyed supremely in literature, and accessible only to a small &eacute;lite. He considered that in the humanities and especially in literature &#145;is to be found the morality appropriate to a modern, decision-making, sophisticated minority&#146;, set against the &#145;vulgarised cultural order of the industrial&#150;bureaucratic state&#146;  (Bantock, <span class="italic">Education in an Industrial Society</span>, 1963, 227, 202). In the course of his writing he dealt critically with Rousseau for his &#145;child-centredness&#146; and with Dewey for his egalitarianism. &#145;The equality we need is that which reverently accepts the essential nature and uniqueness of every human being; the hierarchy, one which recognises different levels of intelligence and sensitivity and recruits itself on this basis&#146;  (ibid., 224). He wrote appreciatively of Matthew Arnold and Cardinal Newman, but drew inspiration above all from D. H. Lawrence and T. S. Eliot. Eliot offered personal support, sympathizing strongly with Bantock's arguments and recommending the publication of his first book by Faber and Faber; he encouraged him to produce his second major book on education, and Bantock made fulsome acknowledgement in <span class="italic">Education and Values</span> (1965), published shortly after Eliot's death. Bantock also published <span class="italic">T. S. Eliot and Education</span> (1969); a further volume, <span class="italic">Education, Culture and the Emotions</span> (1967), was dedicated to Leavis, who had also supported Bantock in his academic career.<br>
<br>Bantock described himself as an educationist, resisting classification as either an English scholar or a philosopher of education. Sincere and tenacious in his views, he made contributions which lent academic authority to the <span class="roman">Black Papers</span>, but the debate unleashed a reaction in educational policy, aspects of which ran counter to his ideals. A quiet, retiring man, he was hurt by the opprobrium which his ideas attracted. He collected antiques and enjoyed drama, music, and dance, which he promoted as curriculum subjects. He died of lung cancer at his home, the Old Rectory, 1807 Melton Road, Rearsby, Leicestershire, on 1 September 1997, and was buried on 4 September at St Michael and All Angels Church, Rearsby. He was survived by his wife.<br>
