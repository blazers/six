<span class="headword">Baird,  John</span>  (1799&#150;1861), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born at Eccles, Berwickshire, on 17 February 1799, the eldest son of the Revd James Baird, who was successively minister of Legertwood, Eccles, and Swinton, all in Berwickshire. John Baird was educated at the grammar schools of Whitsome and Kelso, and proceeded to the University of Edinburgh. Here he founded the Plinian Society for the study of natural history in 1823, and was its first president. In 1825 he went to Ireland, where he served for some time as a preacher for the Irish Evangelical Society. In 1829 he was ordained minister of Yetholm in Roxburghshire. Four years later, on 11 June 1833, he married Margaret, the daughter of Robert Oliver of Blakelaw. They had two daughters before her early death in September 1837. His second wife, Elizabeth, whom he married on 14 November 1849, was the daughter of Nathaniel Hughes of Wexford; they had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>During his long ministry at Yetholm, Baird continued to pursue his botanical and geological interests. He was a founder member of the Berwickshire Naturalists' Club, of which he was president in 1837. Like many other Scottish ministers, he contributed a description of his parish to <span class="italic">The New Statistical Account of Scotland</span>; in 1822 he published <span class="italic">Geological Remarks on the Rock of Gibraltar</span>. However, he was better known for his evangelical work among the Gypsies of Kirk Yetholm, who were itinerant hawkers for eight months of the year and spent the winter at Kirk Yetholm, living in separation from the village community. Baird was keen to eradicate what he viewed as their particular vices&#151;idleness, ignorance, poverty, and fierceness of temper&#151;and to integrate them back into the God-fearing community. He aimed to persuade the parents to leave their children to be educated under his supervision when they went travelling. Baird was able to implement his ideas after the Society for the Reformation of the Gipsies of Scotland was founded in Edinburgh. In 1838&#150;9 this organization raised sufficient finances to fund education, housing, and apprenticeships for the Gypsy children. Baird enjoyed some initial success, and his successor continued the work, although funds fell off after 1850. When George Smith of Coalville visited Kirk Yetholm in 1882, he found only one Gypsy who attended church, and concluded that the scheme had failed to produce any real improvement. Later opinion, while conceding that the decline of traditional Gypsy trades forced many to become more settled, considered that Baird's missionary activities may have contributed to the later nineteenth-century integration of the Gypsies into the village community. Baird died on 29 November 1861 at Yetholm. His wife survived him, dying in Hanover in April 1872.<br>
