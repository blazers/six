<span class="headword">Diodati,  Charles</span>  (1609/10&#150;1638), <span class="occ">friend of John Milton</span>, was born in Middlesex, probably in Brentford, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7680/', "Theodore Diodati (1573&#150;1651)")</script>, a physician of Tuscan descent; his mother was an Englishwoman whose name is not known. By September 1618 he was living in London with his family (including his sister Philadelphia and his brother John) in the Castle Baynard ward of the parish of St Mary Magdalen, near St Paul's Cathedral and the home of Milton on Bread Street. Diodati was educated at St Paul's School and at Trinity College, Oxford. He was admitted to Trinity in late 1621 or early 1622, and matriculated on 7 February 1623, aged thirteen. He proceeded BA on 10 December 1625 and MA on 8 July 1628; his MA was incorporated at Cambridge on 7 July 1629.<br>
<br>By 1630 Diodati was living in Geneva, the birthplace of his father and the residence of his uncle Jean Diodati, a distinguished protestant theologian. He matriculated as a student of theology at the Academy of Geneva on 16 April 1630; a later record shows that he was still at the academy on 15 September 1631 but it is not known how long he remained in residence. He subsequently decided not to enter the church, and instead followed his father into medicine. There is no record of Diodati having studied medicine at a university so he may have been apprenticed to his father. He practised medicine with his father in Chester and in the London parish of St Ann Blackfriars, where he lived with his sister Philadelphia in the house of a Mr Dollam. The evidence for his intermittent residence in Chester is contained in Milton's poetry, but the name of Theodore Diodati also occurs in the churchwardens' accounts of St Peter's, Chester. In the middle of 1638 Diodati's family buried three of its members in St Ann Blackfriars: Isabel, his brother John's wife since 28 July 1635, was buried on 29 June; his sister Philadelphia was buried on 10 August; and Diodati himself was buried on 27 August, having died at Mr Dollam's house in Blackfriars while his friend Milton was in Italy. The causes of these youthful deaths are not recorded but plague must be a possibility.<br>
<br>Diodati's sole published work was an elegy in Latin alcaics on the death of William Camden, which was published in <span class="italic">Camdeni insignia</span> (1624). Diodati's only other writings known to have survived are two light-hearted letters to Milton, now in the British Library  (BL, Add. MS 5016, fols. 5, 71); the letters, which are undated, are written in Greek prose. The friendship between Milton and Diodati dated from childhood (<i>a pueritia</i>, as Milton says in the headnote to <span class="italic">Epitaphium Damonis</span>). Diodati wrote to Milton from Chester early in April 1626; the letter is lost but Milton's reply, in Latin elegiacs, was later printed as <span class="italic">Elegia I</span>; similarly, <span class="italic">Elegia VI</span> is Milton's response to a lost verse-letter by Diodati written on 13 December 1629. Milton also addressed an exuberant sonnet (<span class="roman">Sonnet 4</span>) in Italian to Diodati, probably in late 1629. In 1637 he twice wrote to Diodati in Latin prose (<span class="italic">Epistolarum familiarium</span>, 6 and 7); these letters allude to Diodati's nascent medical career, and the second letter glances at the fraught issue of Theodore Diodati's remarriage after the death of his first wife.<br>
<br>After Diodati's death Milton wrote a commemorative poem, <span class="italic">Epitaphium Damonis</span>, which survives in a single printed copy in the British Library. The poem is a pastoral elegy which movingly conveys Milton's sense of loss; because it is in Latin it is less well known than &#145;Lycidas&#146; but it is one of the greatest poems in the final flowering of Latin literature.<br>
<br>The exchanges between Milton and Diodati depict Milton as a serious and austere student with a passion for learning, and Diodati as his light-hearted and playful friend with a great appetite for conviviality and the life of the countryside; the literary persona is not a reliable guide to temperament, but the portrait of Milton can be verified from other sources, so it is not unlikely that the literary image of Diodati was a faithful reflection of his character.<br>
