<span class="headword">Browne, Sir  Granville St John  Orde</span>  (1883&#150;1947), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial official</span>, was born at Woolwich on 26 October 1883, the son of Captain Charles Orde Browne, soldier, and his wife, Annie Maria Michell. He was educated at Wellington College and at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, from where he was commissioned into the Royal Horse and Field Artillery in 1902. He was posted to South Africa and Mauritius from 1903 to 1907, serving in the 1906 Zulu rising. He returned briefly to Britain from 1907 to 1909, in which year he was seconded to the Colonial Office as an assistant district commissioner in the British East Africa Protectorate (later Kenya).<br>
<br>Orde Browne continued as an administrative officer until 1915 when he was recommissioned into the Royal Artillery. He then served throughout the German East Africa campaign being promoted to the rank of major, appointed CBE, and mentioned in dispatches four times. In view of his later career it is likely that the suffering of conscripted African labourers during the campaign, over 40,000 from the East Africa Protectorate alone dying from neglect or disease, left a lasting impression upon him.<br>
<br>The nature of British colonialism changed greatly after the war. Colonial governments were now seen as trustees for a dual mandate, formalized by Lord Lugard, of developing territories both for the world at large and also for their inhabitants. The mandate was reinforced by a new measure of accountability to the British parliament, which on occasions took a serious view of abuses of power, such as the harsh exploitation of labour in Kenya in the immediate post-war years.<br>
<br>To these wider perspectives of colonial administration Orde Browne returned, first as a senior commissioner in 1921 and then as labour commissioner in 1926, both posts in Tanganyika where the League of Nations mandate colonial government was additionally accountable to Geneva. He married Margaret Florence, daughter of the Revd H. Fearnley-Whittingstall, in 1923; they had three daughters. While serving as senior commissioner Orde Browne was charged with the investigation of labour conditions in the territory and the task of making recommendations for the establishment of a labour department. He later produced an interesting anthropological study, <span class="italic">The Vanishing Tribes of Kenya</span> (1925). This work secured him a reputation outside Africa as a result of which, sponsored by the Institute of African Languages and Cultures, he wrote <span class="italic">The African Labourer</span> (1933), a seminal study from which all colonial territories were to benefit. The work falls into three parts, the first being a study of practices at the time, in particular housing, diet, wages, the contractual obligations of employer and employee, penal sanctions, recruitment, women, juvenile and child labour, migrant labour, and forced labour, set out together with immediate needs for improvement. The second part is an examination of labour legislation in all the European colonial territories in Africa, and the third and final part is concerned with international draft labour conventions and their application in Africa.<br>
<br>The work was published in 1933, two years after Orde Browne's retirement from the colonial service. In 1934 he became a consultant member of the International Labour Office's committee of experts on native labour. In the course of this work he visited the Belgian Congo, Portuguese East Africa, and later, in 1937, Northern Rhodesia. In 1938 he was appointed the first labour adviser to the secretary of state for the colonies, a post he held until his death in 1947. In this capacity he visited the West Indies in 1938, west Africa in 1939, and in 1941 Ceylon, Mauritius, and Malaya, and, after the war was over in 1945, east Africa. During each visit Orde Browne made a careful analysis of the local problems and in detailed reports, later published as command papers, offered practical suggestions usually, but not always, well received in colonial secretariats; among them was a recommendation for the establishment of labour advisory boards. In his time in office it became accepted that the British Trades Union Congress could offer advice to the Colonial Office on colonial labour issues, and in the case of the West Indies (later to be a precedent for other colonies), that emergent trade unions should be guided and assisted rather than discouraged. He also continually urged research into the social problems facing urban, mine, or plantation workers at work away from their traditional home areas.<br>
<br>Orde Browne's achievement was to provide an entirely new, constructive thinking about African labour, a subject generally ignored prior to his work, an achievement that before long resulted in the creation of specialist labour departments with trained staffs in all but the smallest of British colonies. These, as he foresaw, included both field inspectorates and technical staff for matters such as factory inspections, trade unions, workmen's compensation, and trade testing. These departments drew on his expertise and clarification of their functions. While labour conditions in British colonies could never approach the ideal, substantial improvements in conditions of work and wages, elimination of abuses, and compensation for injury were in large measure due to his inspiration. In January 1947 he was knighted for his services. Orde Browne died on 12 May 1947 at the Middlesex Hospital, London. He was survived by his wife.<br>
