<span class="headword">Raymond,  Ernest</span>  (1888&#150;1974), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 31 December 1888 at Argenti&egrave;res in the Haute Savoie, France. His parents were married to other partners. To give the child the semblance of legitimacy, he was baptized as the son of William and Florence Bell Raymond of Paris. Raymond's true father was Captain, later Major-General, George Frederic Blake of the Royal Marines (1836&#150;1904). His mother was Ida Wilkinson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Calder (1846&#150;1918). Ernest Raymond was brought to England in 1891 and raised in London believing his mother was his aunt. Responsibility for bringing up the child was given to Emily Calder, Ida's younger sister, who was strict and narrow-minded. The general lodged with them until 1901, when his estranged wife died. Known affectionately as Dum, he was kindly, amusing, and generous. He then moved away and married Lilian McKellar. The one other permanent member of the unconventional m&eacute;nage was Dorothy Makepeace. She was Raymond's elder half-sister, and though not acknowledged as such was the daughter of Emily and the general. Despite the unusual circumstances, Raymond's childhood was comparatively untroubled and happy. He discovered the complexities of his parentage in early manhood.<br>
<br>Raymond was educated at Colet Court preparatory school, Hammersmith, 1898&#150;1901, and St Paul's School, London, 1901&#150;5. Dum's death and a consequent lack of funds meant that Raymond spent his last year of education at a cheap boarding-school where he was restless and unhappy. At seventeen he left to become a clerk for the Army and Navy Stores. He had formed an abiding ambition to be a writer, but was persuaded to enter the teaching profession. From 1908 to 1911 he taught classics at Glengorse School, Eastbourne, then from 1911 to 1912 at St Christopher's, Bath. At Bath Raymond caught &#145;the splendid fever of Anglo-Catholicity&#146; from a friend.  (Raymond, <span class="italic">The Story of my Days</span>, 114.) He proceeded to Chichester Theological College, where he graduated first in his class, and then took a first-class degree preliminary to holy orders at Durham University in 1914. He was priested on Trinity Sunday 1915.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the First World War, Raymond immediately applied to the chaplain-general for service overseas with the army. He served as chaplain to the 10th Manchester regiment (1915&#150;17), to the 9th Worcestershire regiment (1917 and 1919), to the East Lancashire territorials in Gallipoli in August 1915, and on five other fronts: Sinai, France and Belgium, Mesopotamia, Persia, and Russia. No other campaign for him proved half so memorable, poignant, or glamorous as Gallipoli. &#145;In the secret places of his heart&#146; he retained unsullied his patriotic idealism  (Raymond, <span class="italic">The Story of my Days</span>, 131). In 1917 Raymond witnessed the dreadful slaughter at the Ypres salient, but on the whole his campaigning experience was comparatively comfortable and safe. During the war Raymond composed a religious work, &#145;God's wheat&#146;. The manuscript was lost when the ship bearing it to England was torpedoed. The project was never resurrected.<br>
<br>Demobilized in 1919, Raymond returned to England and took up a curacy in the busy, prosperous parish of Brighton. In 1921 he married Zoe Irene Maude Doucett; they had two children. In 1922 Raymond published <span class="italic">Tell England: a Study in a Generation</span>. As a schoolmaster Raymond had begun a novel about his schooldays. While in Gallipoli he first realized that he might incorporate the material in a more ambitious work about young men who were called to fight and to die for England. This notion grew to become his first and most famous novel. Rejected by thirteen publishers <span class="italic">Tell England</span> was finally published by Cassell and reprinted twenty times in its first two years; it was still in print fifty years and forty impressions later. The reading public, anxious to be reassured that the sacrifice of a generation had been worth while, approved the novel's elegiac quality, its sentimentality, the mixture of patriotism and piety, the celebration of sacrifice, and not least the unquestioning acceptance by the protagonists of their destiny. The critics were hopelessly divided. It was acclaimed as an epic, and also condemned as commonplace, illiterate, and nauseating. It was made into a very successful film by Anthony Asquith in 1931. The book's success cast a long shadow over Raymond's other work. He was constantly reminded that nothing he wrote would ever match the amazing success of his first novel, while as a writer he was condemned for years to be labelled as a popular sentimentalist.<br>
<br>With Raymond's career as a writer spectacularly launched, each subsequent year produced a new novel. <span class="italic">Rossenal</span> (1922) recounted the experiences of a schoolmaster, <span class="italic">Damascus Gate</span> (1923) the tribulations of an aspiring novelist, and <span class="italic">Wanderlight</span> (1924) the agonies of conscience suffered by a young ordinand who withdraws from the priesthood. Throughout his training as deacon and priest Raymond retained his absolute devotion and loyalty to Anglo-Catholicism. As doubts began to grow, however, he realized he had been na&iuml;ve and uncritical. Insupportable misery now replaced joyous belief and in 1923 he decided he must quit holy orders. Though his belief in God the creator remained inviolate, he found it impossible to accept the Trinity. During forty years of anguished self-exile, he never abandoned his love for the church, and when the church declared partial agnosticism to be admissible, he returned immediately.<br>
<br>From 1925 Raymond was a full-time writer producing novels of varying quality. His most successful book was a collection of essays, <span class="italic">Through Literature to Life</span> (1928), reprinted four times before the end of the year. On the strength of it he took part in a conference on literature and leisure in Vancouver in April 1929. In Toronto he started a two-year love affair with Hazel Reid Marsh. In 1929 he published <span class="italic">A Family that Was</span> (1929), the first novel in a three-volume family saga, the other volumes of which were <span class="italic">Mary Leith</span> (1931) and <span class="italic">The Jesting Army</span> (1930); they were published in one volume as <span class="italic">Once in England</span> (1932). In 1929 he turned his hand to drama; his play <span class="italic">The Berg</span>, based on the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i>, had a short run in the West End and was adapted for screen as <span class="italic">Atlantic</span>.<br>
<br>In 1933 Raymond was made president of the Young PEN society and at a meeting in 1935 he met the novelist Diana Joan Young (1916&#150;2009). They married in 1940 after Raymond's divorce from his first wife in the previous year; they had one son. In 1935 <span class="italic">We, the Accused</span> was a considerable critical as well as commercial success, surprising many reviewers by its gritty realism. It won the Book Guild medal in 1935. It combined the story of a murder with informed criticism of the legal system. This novel was the first of a series of sixteen known collectively as <span class="italic">A London Gallery</span>.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Raymond was an air raid warden and a member of the Home Guard in 1940. He produced a number of novels during the war, including <span class="italic">The Last to Rest</span> (1941) and <span class="italic">The Corporal of the Guard</span> (1943). With his son Patrick, Raymond wrote <span class="italic">Back to Humanity</span> (1945), an impassioned call for a return to human values after the alienation of war. Raymond wrote more than forty novels. Such later works as <span class="italic">A Georgian Love Story</span> (1971) satisfied his considerable and loyal readership; his last novel, <span class="italic">Under Wedgery Down</span> (1974), was published posthumously and is evidence of his lifelong energy and creativity. He also wrote biographical studies of Keats, Shelley, the Bront&euml; family, and St Francis (on the strength of the last book he was made a knight officer in the order of merit of the Italian republic). Raymond's considerable contribution to popular literature was belatedly acknowledged by his appointment as OBE in 1972. He was made president of the Dickens Fellowship in 1971, and he campaigned to have Coleridge's remains reinterred in St Michael's, Highgate, London. He lived in Hampstead for thirty-five years and was on Hampstead council's libraries committee, and in 1961 served as a Liberal councillor. In 1966 he visited Israel in an effort to restore his lost faith; an account of this appears in <span class="italic">The Bethany Road</span> (1967).<br>
<br>Raymond died on 14 May 1974 at his home, 22 The Pryors, East Heath Road, Hampstead, London, of uraemia and an enlarged prostate; he was buried in Hampstead cemetery. His wife Diana survived him.<br>
<br>Raymond was a fluent, compelling story-teller. His novels are illuminated by his deep affection for the north of England and, above all, for London, where he lived for most of his life. There was a strong didactic streak in Raymond though he and his work shared an optimism and a robust, even Dickensian, humour. His stories allowed him to examine social and religious themes with his own radical ideals and ideas; this was done without apology and with uncompromising moral earnestness. This, combined with his reputation for sentimentality, perhaps explains his fall from critical favour.<br>
