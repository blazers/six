<span class="headword">Lees,  Andrew John</span>  (1949&#150;1994/5), <span class="occ">conservationist and environmental campaigner</span>, was born on 8 June 1949 at Sandown Nursing Home, 14 Sandown Road, Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, the eldest among the four boys of Edward Andrew Lees (<i>b</i>. 1923), hotelier and Great Yarmouth borough councillor, and his wife, Beryl, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whiteley (1927&#150;1993). Andrew Lees was a son of Norfolk with a passion for its big skies, low-lying landscape, and traditional village culture. Most of all he loved its myriad of rivers and streams, dykes, marshes, and fens, and its rich diversity of wildlife.<br>
<br>In 1967 (after education at St George's School, Harpenden) Lees enrolled at the University of Wales in Cardiff to study zoology, botany, and philosophy. After graduating with honours in 1971 he worked as a field scientist with the Nature Conservancy Council (NCC). The NCC had a statutory responsibility to protect the best of Britain's natural environment by designating certain areas as &#145;sites of special scientific interest&#146; (SSSIs). Lees's uncompromising commitment to nature conservation first emerged in 1978 when surveying Crymlyn bog in Wales. Having determined that this unique habitat was a potential candidate for special protection he organized the local community and the media to stop it being turned into a rubbish tip. In 1981, working with Friends of the Earth (FOE), he obtained leave for judicial review of NCC's failure to notify part of the bog as a SSSI. The NCC backed down and the site was given SSSI protection. This was Lees's first environmental campaign success. His adherence to scientific discipline and knowledge of environmental laws, combined with his ability to attract media attention and generate local support, provided the winning formula that defined his future environmental campaign strategies.<br>
<br>Disillusioned with the NCC, Lees left Wales in late 1981 and returned to his native Norfolk. The broads were under serious threat from proposals to build deep drainage and barrier systems that would turn the wetlands into vast prairies of cereal production. In 1982 Lees helped to set up Broadlands Friends of the Earth and was appointed as its chairman. He lobbied the media, exposed the environmental contradictions in the government's agricultural policies, and succeeded in galvanizing local and national opinion against the drainage scheme. In 1986, after much campaigning, large tracts of marshlands were designated an environmentally sensitive area (ESA). Two years later, under intense public pressure, the government passed the <span class="roman">Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act</span>. The broads were protected: a success due in large measure to Lees's tenacious campaigning and commitment.<br>
<br>In 1985 Lees was appointed FOE national campaign officer for the countryside and pesticides, and in 1986 as water pollution and toxics campaigner. Pollution in any form was unacceptable to him: agricultural pesticides, sewage discharges, leachate from landfill sites, and traffic pollution. Any activity that threatened human health or the environment would be challenged. He continued to apply his winning campaign formula with vigour and determination. He organized the &#145;dirty dozen&#146; campaign to expose a group of highly toxic chemicals, many of which were later banned. He pioneered the use of judicial review of government legislation. He used formal complaints procedures to ensure proper implementation by the British government of European Community environmental laws, becoming a well-known figure to officials in Brussels. He was extremely wary of the government's plans in 1987 to privatize the water industry, which he felt would undermine water quality in the United Kingdom. He exposed the poorly regulated and weak standards of sewage treatment and showed that concentrations of pesticides in many drinking water supplies breached legal standards. The <span class="roman">Water Resources Act</span>, which was implemented in 1991, included much higher environmental standards and tighter regulatory controls for the protection of water quality than had previously been expected. This was one of Lees's greatest achievements.<br>
<br>Lees's environmental concerns extended beyond the UK. In 1988 he and a fellow FOE campaigner, Charles Secrett, went to Nigeria and exposed the illegal dumping of 8000 tons of mainly Italian toxic waste at Koko on the Niger delta. Lees was incensed that a so-called developed country could show such scant regard for the health and well-being of local people in a developing country. Not content simply to expose those responsible, he continued to track the waste on the <i>Karin B</i> cargo ship. With nowhere for the ship to go the <i>Karin B</i> saga became an international scandal and a major embarrassment to the European Union, which later introduced new regulations restricting the shipment of hazardous waste to developing countries.<br>
<br>In 1990 Lees became FOE's national campaigns director. His enthusiastic and combative campaigning style never abated. He would work day and night to get results, and he expected the same level of commitment from his colleagues. He was demanding and motivating in equal measure. His single-minded and often uncompromising approach would sometimes infuriate his colleagues. But he was also empowering and supportive, always encouraging others to realize their aspirations, hopes, and dreams.<br>
<br>Lees's intense love of life and nature extended beyond environmental campaigning. He had a lively interest in philosophy, politics, and art that shaped his own unconventional perspective on life. But it was his partner from 1984, Christine Orengo (<i>b</i>. 1955), a theoretical biologist, who provided balance in his often over-stressed life. They were a devoted couple. She described him as a wonderful listener, the most caring and loving of partners, completely supportive, and a great strength in times of crisis.<br>
<br>In 1994 Lees turned his attention to Madagascar, the world's fourth largest island and home to some of the most remarkable flora and fauna on earth. QIT, a mining company owned by Rio Tinto Zinc, was proposing to mine parts of the island for titanium dioxide. The mining operation threatened to produce 2 billion tons of titanium dioxide over forty years, and destroy huge swathes of unique littoral forest and sand dunes, along with the livelihood of thousands of local farmers and fishermen. This was a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> of international proportions. Lees went to Madagascar with a photographer, Paul Hellyer, just before Christmas 1994, with the intention of making a film documentary to support his campaign. Sadly, he never completed the project. On new year's eve, despite suffering from chronic diarrhoea, he decided to go into Petriky Forest alone to shoot one last piece of film. Hours later, when he failed to rendezvous with his taxi, there was panic. Eventually his body was found in a small clearing in Petriky Forest on 7 January. There was no indication of foul play. His camera equipment was intact. The autopsy later indicated that he had died of heat exhaustion. He was buried in Norfolk.<br>
<br>Lees was a scientist with principles: a professional campaigner who won international acclaim and respect for his work on the environment. His abrupt and tragic death sent shock waves around the world. Tributes poured in from friends and adversaries alike. The media variously described him as &#145;a secular saint&#146;, &#145;a man of deep principles&#146;, and &#145;an environmental campaigner of a kind we will not see again&#146;, the man who &#145;effected more positive environmental change than any Secretary of State in the government&#146;. A former European commissioner, Lord Clinton-Davis, commented on Lees's remarkable ability to influence an audience by his unassailable evidence and penetrating logic. Following his death the Andrew Lees Memorial Trust Fund was set up to help the people of Madagascar, and the Libanona Ecology Centre was dedicated to his memory. Perhaps the most poignant of memorials erected in his honour is the one at Pant-y-sais fen, the northern limb of the Crymlyn bog, where Lees's remarkable campaigning career began. The memorial carries a quotation from him: &#145;At some point I had to stand up and be counted. Who speaks for the butterflies?&#146;<br>
