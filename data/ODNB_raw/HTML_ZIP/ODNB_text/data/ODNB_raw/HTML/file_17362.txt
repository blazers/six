<span class="headword">Macbride,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1735&#150;1800), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, was one of three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17365/', "Robert McBride (1686/7&#150;1759)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17361/', "McBride, John (c.1650&#150;1718)")</script>], a Presbyterian minister of Ballymoney, co. Antrim, and his wife, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Boyd, of Killabeg, co. Down. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17360/', "David Macbride")</script>, chemist and physician, was his elder brother. John entered the Royal Navy about 1754, having served for some years in the merchant marine. His early days were spent as a midshipman, master's mate, or able seaman in the <i>Garland</i> in the West Indies. He was promoted lieutenant on 27 October 1758.<br>
<br>Macbride came to public attention in August 1761 while in command of the cutter <i>Grace</i>. He secured permission to lead some small boats into the roadstead at Dunkirk and captured a French privateer anchored there. In April 1762 he was promoted to command the fireship <i>Grampus</i>, and shortly afterwards he took over several other vessels, all in home waters. In 1766 he took the frigate <i>Jason</i> to the Falkland Islands, about which he published <span class="italic">A Journal of the Winds and Weather &hellip; at Falkland Islands from 1 Feb 1766 to 19 Jan 1767</span> (1770?). He then commanded several more vessels in home waters, on one occasion, in May 1772, escorting the queen of Denmark to the Scheldt. On 14 July 1774 he married Ursula, daughter of William Folkes of Hillington Hall, Norfolk. The couple had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17364/', "John David Macbride")</script>, who later became principal of Magdalen Hall, Oxford. In 1776 he was appointed to command the line of battle ship <i>Bienfaisant</i> (64 guns) and in her he was engaged in the tactically indecisive action off Ushant on 27 July 1778. Macbride did not play a significant part in the fighting; however, his evidence in favour of Viscount Keppel was instrumental in securing the commander-in-chief's acquittal when court martialled for misconduct in February 1779. Macbride was less supportive of Sir Hugh Palliser when he resigned from the Admiralty and was in turn court martialled.<br>
<br>In December 1779 Macbride sailed in the <i>Bienfaisant</i> with Sir George Rodney to relieve Gibraltar and <i>en route</i>, on 8 January 1780, he captured a Spanish 54-gun vessel. Macbride's ship took an important part in the battle of Cape St Vincent eight days later. The Spanish ship <i>San Domingo</i> blew up while engaged with the <i>Bienfaisant</i>, and then the <i>Phoenix</i>, flagship of Admiral Don Juan de Langara, surrendered to her. Because of a smallpox outbreak on the British vessel, Macbride agreed to let Langara and his officers remain on the <i>Phoenix</i>, but they were to act as if they were prisoners on the British ship. Both vessels eventually arrived safely in Gibraltar harbour.<br>
<br>Macbride was sent back to Britain with Rodney's dispatches and in March 1780 resumed command of <i>Bienfaisant</i>. His next notable action occurred shortly afterwards when, in the company of three other vessels, he went in search of a French privateer with which he eventually made contact off the Old Head of Kinsale on 13 August. Macbride's vessel opened fire first on the French ship, the <i>Comte d'Artois</i> (64 guns; over 600 men). After just over an hour, with the arrival of one of Macbride's supporting vessels, the French surrendered. Of the British squadron only <i>Bienfaisant</i> had suffered any serious casualties. In January 1781 he was appointed to command the former enemy frigate <i>Artois</i> (40 guns), and in her he took part in the battle of the Dogger Bank (5 August). In the aftermath of the battle he briefly took command of the line of battle ship <i>Princess Amelia</i>, whose captain had been killed in the action. He then returned to the <i>Artois</i> and on 3 December was engaged in another sharp fight with privateers, which resulted in his capturing two Dutch vessels in the North Sea. In April 1782, while cruising in the English Channel, Macbride was able to observe a French fleet heading for the West Indies, and reported their position to the main fleet, which intercepted and captured about half of them. In June he was stationed in Ireland, where he was employed to impress men for service with the fleet.<br>
<br>With the return of peace Macbride's career took a new turn. In 1784 he was elected MP for Plymouth, a seat he held until 1790 despite being appointed to command the Plymouth guardship <i>Cumberland</i> in 1788. As an MP Macbride spoke on naval affairs on several occasions. He was one of the naval members of the duke of Richmond's commission which investigated the state of the Portsmouth and Plymouth defences (1785&#150;6) and he spoke out and voted against the proposals in the House of Commons.<br>
<br>Macbride went back to active service with the outbreak of war against France in February 1793. Promoted rear-admiral on 1 February, he became commander-in-chief of a frigate squadron patrolling the downs. He was then placed in command of a squadron off Brest and in December 1793 he led a small fleet to Brittany and Normandy, attempting to create a diversion on behalf of French royalists. On 4 July 1795 he was promoted vice-admiral and by early 1796 he was back in the North Sea, watching the Dutch fleet in the Texel. In February 1799 he was appointed admiral of the blue. His last appointments do not seem to have been especially successful, though for much of his career he was a popular and well-respected officer. He died following a stroke on 17 February 1800 at the Spring Garden Coffee House in London. His wife survived him.<br>
