<span class="headword">Bertram,  Walter</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1495/6), <span class="occ">merchant and provost of Edinburgh</span>, is first recorded in 1464. He received payments for expensive cloth sold to James III in 1473 and by 1477 was clearly wealthy, as he bought the lands of Normangills in Lanarkshire from David Lindsay, earl of Crawford. His links with the royal household as a prominent merchant led to royal favour in the late 1470s, and he was confirmed in his lands and appointed to the important roles of custumar, bailie, and chamberlain of Berwick, regained from England in 1461.<br>
<br>Bertram frequently attended parliament as a burgh commissioner representing Edinburgh from 1478 and he was elected to the influential committee of the articles on three occasions in the crisis of 1482&#150;3. On 4 August 1482, before the dukes of Albany (James III's brother, who was seeking to control the government) and Gloucester&#151;and with 20,000 English soldiers outside his city&#151;Bertram, as provost of Edinburgh, promised that, if requested, the city would repay all the dowry payments made by Edward IV to James III as part of the marriage alliance of 1474. It was the price of an English withdrawal. On 29 September Bertram took part with Albany in the &#145;siege&#146; of Edinburgh Castle, by which the king ended the two-month confinement imposed on him by rebellious nobles. Subsequent events, however, suggest Bertram was not a supporter of Albany, for he had been replaced as provost by 16 November and was omitted from a list of burgesses in a grant of Leith's customs to Edinburgh. On 29 January 1483, as the king began to regain his power after Albany's retirement to Dunbar, James III granted Bertram and his wife an annuity of &pound;40 Scots for his services, particularly in the king's release from captivity. This was renewed in 1489, when it was specifically stated to be compensation for damage perpetrated by Albany.<br>
<br>Bertram married Elizabeth Cant (<i>d</i>. after 1498) before 4 November 1477. He died between 27 August 1495 and 3 August 1496 following a career in which he had been one of the very few members of the Scottish burgess estate to make an important mark on the political stage. He was succeeded by Andrew Bertram.<br>
