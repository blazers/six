<span class="headword">King,  Philip Gidley</span>  (1758&#150;1808), <span class="occ">naval officer and colonial governor</span>, was born at Launceston, Cornwall, on 23 April 1758, the only son of Philip King, a local draper, and his wife, daughter of John Gidley, an Exeter attorney. Educated at Mr Bailey's school, Yarmouth, he joined the navy on 22 December 1770 as captain's servant in the <i>Swallow</i>, and served for five years in the East Indies. In July 1775, on moving to American waters, he became a midshipman in the <i>Liverpool</i>, and after two more changes he was commissioned lieutenant in the <i>Renown</i> in December 1778, according to one of his examiners, &#145;one of the most promising young men I have ever met&#146;. Next year he returned home to serve in the Channel Fleet, coming under Captain Arthur Phillip in November 1781. Two years later he was in Indian waters, still under Phillip, but he was paid off in 1784, when war ended, and was on half pay for two years.<br>
<br>In October 1786, when the expedition to establish a penal colony in New South Wales was being fitted out, Phillip, its commander, appointed King second lieutenant of the <i>Sirius</i> (20 guns), which was convoying the transports. After many delays in sailing the expedition reached Port Jackson (Sydney) on 26 January 1788, and within three weeks Phillip sent King, &#145;an officer of merit, whose perseverance may be depended on&#146; (A. Phillip to Lord Sydney, 15 May 1788; <span class="italic">Historical Records of Australia</span>, ser. 1, 1.20), with seventeen men and six women to occupy Norfolk Island, to &#145;anticipate&#146; any foreign power, and, he hoped, to prepare its prolific flax-plant for use in the navy. Unfortunately he could not do this, having no flax-dressers; he also found that the island had no timber good for naval masts and no good harbour. However, by January 1790 King had 50 acres under cultivation with wheat and maize and a plentiful supply of fruit and vegetables, so Phillip was able to send two companies of marines and 183 convicts with 27 children to the island to relieve the pressure on provisions in Sydney. In April he sent King to England to report on the settlement, and strongly recommended his promotion.<br>
<br>Upon reaching London in December King learned that he had been appointed lieutenant-governor of Norfolk Island, and on 2 March 1791 he was promoted commander. Nine days later, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, he married his cousin, Anna Josepha Coombe (1764/5&#150;1844) of Hattersleigh, Devon, according to marine-officer Ralph Clarke's journal &#145;a genteel woman&#146; but &#145;not very pretty&#146;, though Elizabeth Macarthur thought her &#145;possessed of a great share of good nature&#146; and King's friend, the future commissary W. N. Chapman, described her as &#145;almost an angel&#146;  (Bassett, 16, 20&#150;21). They sailed in the <i>Gorgon</i> on 15 March, reaching Sydney on 21 September and Norfolk Island on 4 November. There, on 13 December, their first child, the future <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15586/', "Captain Phillip Parker King RN (1791&#150;1856)")</script>, was born, to join King's two illegitimate sons, the future naval officers Norfolk (1789&#150;1839) and Sydney (1790&#150;1840), whose mother, Ann Inett (<i>b</i>. 1757), a mantua maker of Grimley, Worcestershire, had been found guilty on 11 March 1786 of stealing clothing and linen, and transported for seven years (in 1792 she married another convict).<br>
<br>On Norfolk Island, Anna Josepha had to live with only one female companion of her own class, Mrs Paterson, wife of Captain William Paterson, bring up her family (increased by two girls), and nurse her husband, as he suffered increasingly from gout, inflammation of the lungs, difficulty in breathing, and stomach pain. However, despite his ill health, trouble associated with the ill discipline of the New South Wales Corps, and shortage of officials King was a success. After a visit the colony's chaplain, the Revd Samuel Marsden, reported to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts that King's &#145;whole attention seems occupied in promoting the real interest&#146; of the islanders  (2 Jan 1796; <span class="italic">Historical Records of New South Wales</span>, 3.1). By 1796 King had built a girls' school and an orphanage, funded from customs duties. He had not been able to promote flax production, for two young Maori brought from New Zealand, said to be flax-dressers, told him that flax-dressing was &#145;woman's work&#146;, and they knew nothing about it. However, he restored the economy, which had deteriorated while he was away, and encouraged former marines and former convicts to cultivate land. By 1796 240 people occupied Norfolk Island, with 1500 acres cleared; there were nearly 5000 livestock, mainly swine, five-sixths of these privately owned, and nearly 350 people working as labourers. Although there was a shortage of labour for public works King had built a strong wharf, a large storehouse, barracks, a water-mill, and a government house. But his health had not improved, and he had to ask for sick leave. The Kings departed in October, reaching London next May, with another daughter, Elizabeth, born in February.<br>
<br>In England, King, now in better health, sent to Sir Joseph Banks and Lord Sydney the native plants he had brought with him, and set about obtaining another appointment. Supported by Arthur Phillip, Banks, and officials at both the Admiralty and the Home Office, King was given, in May 1798, a dormant commission to succeed John Hunter as governor of New South Wales at a salary of &pound;1000 per annum. Although he had been given his sailing orders, lengthy discussions about the design of a ship that would carry Banks's plants for the colony and two false starts delayed his departure and strained his finances. He was promoted post captain in December but did not sail until November 1799 in the 300-ton whaler <i>Speedy</i>, with his wife and his daughter Elizabeth, leaving behind his three sons and his other surviving daughter.<br>
<br>King arrived in April 1800, but Hunter did not leave, much to the new governor's irritation. He could do little more than criticize Hunter, deplore the misbehaviour allegedly prevailing in Sydney, and reiterate his plans for reform, which included establishing a convict outstation, controlling the liquor trade more effectively, and encouraging sheep- and cattle-breeding, cloth manufacture, coalmining, wine-growing, and the budding whale and seal fisheries&#151;and incidentally send Banks a pickled platypus (<i>Ornithorhynchus paradox</i>) to prove to the sceptics that such a creature existed. But on 28 September he assumed command.<br>
<br>The thriving fisheries were stimulated by the discoveries in Bass Strait in 1801&#150;2 by lieutenants Grant and Murray, whom King had sent out from Sydney, and by Matthew Flinders on his voyage to circumnavigate Australia. Following their reports in May 1802, King wrote to London strongly recommending that a settlement be established at the newly discovered Port Phillip. This project (carried out by Captain David Collins but quickly abandoned), he argued, would reduce the number of convicts in Sydney, where he was worried by the arrival of so many Irish rebels, and would anticipate possible French designs in the area, of which the appearance of Nicolas Baudin's allegedly scientific expedition (political according to its hydrographer, Fran&ccedil;ois Peron) had made him suspicious. These fears led him in November 1802 to send a ship to King Island and examine Port Phillip again. In the following year he ordered the foundation of a settlement under Lieutenant Bowen on the River Derwent in Van Diemen's Land, which, founded in September 1803 and reinforced by Collins's party leaving Port Phillip in January 1804, quickly became an important whaling station. In 1804 King sent a party to Port Dalrymple, on the south side of Bass Strait, to investigate Port Phillip further while checking the appearance of Americans whaling and sealing there. King also continued exploration and expansion elsewhere. He helped to develop the pork and sandalwood trades in the Pacific. In 1801 he had sent a party to examine the Hunter River and establish a penal settlement there to exploit the coal, timber, and shells for lime&#151;temporarily in 1801&#150;2 and permanently in April 1804. Unfortunately expeditions of exploration to the west were less successful, as the Blue Mountains appeared an impossible barrier.<br>
<br>This was less important as long as the colony was regarded primarily as a penal settlement, though during King's term only about 2500 convicts arrived, nearly half in 1800&#150;1. Of these about 500 were Irish rebels whom King feared might rebel again in the colony, as indeed about 300 did do in 1804, so he was relieved to ship off the most dangerous to either Newcastle or Norfolk Island. The low numbers of convicts meant fewer public works, with only about 200 men working on them; the majority were assigned to private employment. King reduced the number of government supported servants for military officers and officials from 250 to 58 and tightened the regulations controlling employers' treatment of their convicts. He also laid the foundation of the ticket-of-leave system for the well-behaved, believing that offenders were not consigned &#145;to Oblivion and disgrace for ever&#146;, but when emancipated became &#145;as Free and Susceptible to every Right as Free Born Britons as any Soul in the Territory&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historical Records of Australia</span>, 4.276).<br>
<br>Mindful of the need for economy in public expenditure and for more reliable food supplies, King encouraged agriculture by increasing land grants to private farmers and the assignment of convicts to private service. He insisted on licences for liquor imports and sent away two-fifths of the 170,000 gallons of spirits brought to Sydney while he was governor. He was also active in importing livestock for food, distributing 60 per cent to deserving settlers, and by the end of his term the area under wheat, maize, and barley had risen from 7000 to 11,000 acres&#151;all under private (not government) cultivation&#151;and virtually no farmer remained &#145;on the stores&#146;. These measures, together with the fact that only a small number of convicts were arriving and others were completing their sentences, meant that he was able to reduce the proportion of people drawing government rations from about three-quarters to one-third, and despite an increase of 30 per cent in the total population, he drew 20 per cent less in treasury bills for stores than his predecessor John Hunter had done in 1796&#150;8. He also encouraged the colony's infant industries&#151;flour milling, salt extraction, tanneries and leather, woollen and cloth manufacture, agricultural implements, boat building, timber working, and brick making, though all these were necessarily on a small scale; King showed less interest in wool, though on instructions from London he granted more than 60,000 acres for the first time to assist pastoralists, especially John Macarthur and Samuel Marsden. On the debit side, he was in constant trouble with the officers of the New South Wales Corps and local liquor traders. The opening of an orphanage, financed by the (unauthorized) imposition of a 5 per cent import duty on spirits and all non-British goods, his convict policy, his permission for transported Irish priests to celebrate mass, and his establishment of the <span class="italic">Sydney Gazette</span> (censored though it was) to provide information though not &#145;political discussion&#146; all show a progressive attitude to social policy.<br>
<br>King was a capable and conscientious administrator, and, though occasionally profiting from his position, he did little unusual by eighteenth-century standards, and was a pillar of rectitude compared with almost all his subordinates&#151;and many of his superiors in London. Sickness accentuated his hot temper, but he was plagued by incapable officials and an arrogant, insolent, and often disobedient military force, though his life in Sydney was greatly helped by the presence of Anna Josepha, a tower of strength in the management of &#145;Mrs King's Orphanage&#146; and in many personal relationships; she was a very friendly hostess to both Matthew Flinders and Nicolas Baudin (later receiving a dessert service of S&egrave;vres china) and a devoted nurse to her husband as his gout worsened and his general health declined while he waited two years for his successor, William Bligh, to arrive after King had submitted his resignation in 1804. When he did, King was unfit to travel, and could not sail before the <i>Buffalo</i> departed on 10 February 1807; he settled in Tooting, Surrey, and died in London on 3 September 1808, aged fifty, within a year of his arrival. He was buried in St Nicholas's churchyard, Lower Tooting. He was survived by his wife, his two natural sons, and four of his five legitimate children; his elder surviving daughter, Maria, married Hannibal Macarthur, cousin of his erstwhile opponent John, in 1812.<br>
<br>In May 1809 the Treasury granted Mrs King a pension&#151;&pound;265 per annum, reduced to &pound;200 in 1810&#151;and for some time she and the younger children lived in some poverty in Edgware Road, London, but in time her land and cattle in New South Wales, granted to her by Bligh when he assumed office, improved her financial situation. She longed to go back, but not until 1832 did she overcome the opposition of her children and return with her son Phillip to live with the Hannibal Macarthurs (and her eight grandchildren) at Parramatta&#151;a stately matriarch, as before caring for the local children and the sick and a pillar of the church. A very sensible woman, and one of the more useful and courageous pioneers of the colony, she died on 26 July 1844, aged seventy-nine.<br>
