<span class="headword">Ladbrooke,  Robert</span>  (1768&#150;1842), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born at Norwich. Little is known of his early life, though his parents are said to have been humble. He was apprenticed early to an artist and printer named White, and for several years worked as a journeyman printer. As an apprentice he met and befriended John Crome, his contemporary, who was working for a house and sign painter. They became firm friends, sharing a small studio and devoting their spare time to sketching and copying. On 3 October 1793 Ladbrooke married Mary Berney or Barney (<i>d</i>. 1807) and purchased a house at Scoles Green, Norwich. He set himself up as a drawing-master and worked in partnership with Crome, who was now his brother-in-law, having married Mary Berney's sister. Initially Ladbrooke painted portraits but he subsequently turned to landscape painting, in which he established his reputation. Along with Crome, Ladbrooke took a leading part in the establishment of the Norwich Society of Artists in 1803 and, after a tour of Wales in 1804, he sent fourteen works to its first exhibition in 1805. He also sent works to the Royal Academy between 1805 and 1815. Mary Berney died in 1807, and Ladbrooke later remarried, his second wife dying in 1828.<br>
<br>In 1809 Ladbrooke was nominated president of the Norwich Society of Artists; he continued to exhibit his work regularly. In 1816, with Joseph Stannard, John Thirtle, and several other members, he seceded from the society, having attempted unsuccessfully to modify some of its rules. The precise nature of the dispute is unclear but may have involved the proposed exclusion of amateurs from the society and questions about financial management. Ladbrooke's faction formed a rival society and held their own exhibitions in a hall adjoining the Shakespeare tavern on Theatre Plain, Norwich. This venture, however, proved a failure, and was abandoned after only three years. Ladbrooke therefore sent works to the British Institution for exhibition in 1819, 1820, and 1822. Between 1821 and 1822 he devoted himself to a collection of 700 lithographs of Norfolk churches with the assistance of his son <a href="#cosubject_15869">John Berney Ladbrooke [<i>see below</i>]</a>. This project was published only posthumously in five volumes in 1843. By 1822 Ladbrooke's interests in art dealing and picture framing allowed him to hand over his work as a drawing-master to his son. In 1824 he was reconciled with the Norwich Society of Artists under the presidency of his nephew, John Berney Crome; he sent two paintings to the exhibition that year and continued to send works intermittently until 1833. Success in business ventures led him to retire many years before his death, and in these later years Ladbrooke began to invest in property, leaving a significant estate including land in Beer Street and the Shakespeare tavern at his death on 11 October 1842 at his house on Scoles Green. He was buried at St Stephen's, Norwich.<br>
<br>Few of Ladbrooke's paintings appear to have survived. He published aquatints of two of his pictures, <span class="italic">A View of the Fellmongers on the River Near Bishop's Bridge</span> and <span class="italic">A View of Norwich Castle</span>, besides the posthumous <span class="italic">Views of the Churches of Norfolk</span>. Two of Ladbrooke's sons were well-known artists.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_15868"></a><span class="headword">Henry Ladbrooke</span>  (1800&#150;1869), the second son, was born at Norwich on 20 April 1800. His early desire to enter the church was discouraged by his father, and Henry Ladbrooke became the pupil of his uncle John Crome. He acquired a reputation as a <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, especially for his moonlight scenes, and exhibited intermittently at the Norwich Society of Artists between 1818 and 1833. He then exhibited at the British Institution in 1834 and 1836 as well as at the Suffolk Street Gallery between 1836 and 1865. With his wife, Elizabeth Mary (1795/6&#150;1873), he had two sons and three daughters, of whom two became schoolmistresses. He worked as a drawing-master, first in North Walsham, and later in Valenger's Road, King's Lynn, and was assisted in his teaching by his daughter, Fanny. He died in Norwich on 18 November 1869 and was buried at Norwich cemetery.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_15869"></a><span class="headword">John Berney Ladbrooke</span>  (1803&#150;1879)<span class="occ"></span>, Robert Ladbrooke's third son, was born on 31 October 1803 in Norfolk. His middle name was sometimes spelt Barney. He studied under his uncle John Crome, whose style he acquired, and excelled in the representation of woodland scenery. He exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1821, 1822, and 1843 as well as at the British Institution between 1823 and 1859 and at the Suffolk Street Gallery up to 1873. He worked as a drawing-master in Norwich, and at some stage before 1850 he made a tour of the Netherlands and France. He was married to Hannah (1798/9&#150;1867), but appears to have had no children. The fruit and flower painter Maria Louisa Margitson (1830&#150;1896) was his niece. In 1859 he built a house and studio on Mousehold Heath, Norfolk, which was named Kett's Castle Villa. He died at the house on 11 July 1879 and was buried at the Rosary cemetery.<br>
