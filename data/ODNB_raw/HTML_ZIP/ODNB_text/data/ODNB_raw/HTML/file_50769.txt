<span class="headword">Deyville <span class="st"> [Daiville]</span>, Sir  John  de</span>  (<em>c.</em>1234&#150;1290/91), <span class="occ">rebel</span>, was the son of Robert de Deyville and his wife, Denise Fitzwilliam, of Sprotborough. The Deyvilles, who took their name from D&eacute;ville (Seine-Maritime) in north-east Normandy, were established in Nottinghamshire and north Yorkshire during the twelfth century, above all through their links with the Mowbrays. John de Deyville was probably born <i>c</i>.1234, and was still a minor when his father died. His wardship was entrusted to Roger (II) de Mowbray, who may have abused his trust, or at any rate neglected it, since when Deyville attained his majority in 1254 he found it necessary to sell lands at Adlingfleet valued at &pound;400. Resentment at the exploitation of his assets during his minority, perhaps combined with the economic effects of the loss of his family's Norman possessions in 1204, may help to explain the subsequent course of his career. Nevertheless he was made keeper of the forests north of the Trent for three years in 1257 and was summoned for service in Scotland in 1258.<br>
<br>Deyville was among the supporters of Richard de Clare, earl of Gloucester (to whom he had sold his Adlingfleet lands), a member of the baronial regency council, when Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1262) made an alliance with Henry III in February 1259. He was not then so prominent a supporter of Simon de Montfort to be omitted from the king's summons of his tenants-in-chief and their knights to London in March or April 1260, and he was reappointed keeper of the forests in the north that May. However, he was identified sufficiently closely with the baronial cause to be dismissed in June 1261 in the king's general purge of local officials during his resumption of power at the centre. Thereafter, Deyville became the unofficial baronial keeper (<i>custos</i>) for Yorkshire, during a period of largely unco-ordinated local dissent; that November he led disturbances in York. Following Montfort's initial victory and conclusion of peace with the king in July 1263, Deyville was formally appointed keeper and sheriff of Yorkshire. From December 1263, when Henry III regained control of the central government, to April 1264 he held York Castle in defiance of royal edicts, after which he briefly occupied Carlisle Castle. Deyville reaped the benefits of Montfort's victory at the battle of Lewes in May, being made keeper of Yorkshire once more in June, and receiving licence to crenellate his home at Hood, near Kilburn, in August. In September he was reappointed keeper of the forests in the north and in December he was summoned as a baron to the famous parliament that met the following January. He was among those magnates whom Montfort banned from holding a tournament at Dunstable in February 1265, for fear that it would exacerbate tensions with the new earl of Gloucester, Gilbert de Clare (<i>d</i>. 1295). But he remained a firm Montfortian, and in March was deputed to wrest Richmond Castle, Yorkshire, from royalist control.<br>
<br>After Montfort's defeat and death at the battle of Evesham on 4 August 1265 Deyville's lands were confiscated and granted to Queen Eleanor. He led those who continued in rebellion in the Isle of Axholme, Lincolnshire (a Mowbray estate). Although, along with Simon de Montfort the younger, he was forced to submit to the Lord Edward at Bycarr's Dyke, on the border of Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire, in December 1265, he remained one of the leading &#145;disinherited&#146; rebels. After sacking Sheffield early in 1266, he joined Robert de Ferrers, earl of Derby, and other rebels in May at Chesterfield, where they were surprised and beaten in battle by a royalist force. He was by then heavily in debt to Jewish moneylenders, which may explain why he specifically killed Jews and destroyed charters when he sacked Lincoln after fleeing that defeat. He proceeded to give new heart to the rebel cause by occupying the Isle of Ely, whence he mounted raids on Cambridge and Norwich. Despite negotiations with the committee of twelve magnates who met at Coventry in September and October to agree rules for the redemption of the rebels' lands, Deyville and his men would not accept the dictum of Kenilworth proclaimed on 31 October. According to Robert of Gloucester they replied to the papal legate's overtures with Montfortian demands for the maintenance of the provisions of Oxford and the reversal of their excommunication by the legate. The young and disaffected earl of Gloucester then put himself forward as their champion, and Deyville joined him in his occupation of London in April 1267. &#145;For two months the city was a rebel camp&#146;  (Powicke, <span class="italic">Henry III and the Lord Edward</span>, 543), and the excommunication of Deyville, who had perhaps been responsible for some pillaging in the city, was renewed at St Paul's at Easter.<br>
<br>Although Deyville was excluded from the treaty made between the king and Gloucester at Stratford in June, his long rebellion came to an end on 1 July 1267 when he was formally pardoned at St Paul's and given immediate seisin of his lands, the redemption fine for which was granted to Queen Eleanor at a lenient four-yearly valuation of &pound;600, to be paid by instalments. Like the other disinherited, he was to benefit from financial aid from the clergy. In 1268 the king granted relief from repayment of his Jewish debts until he had settled his redemption fine, but he incurred other penalties, including one for unlicensed marriage to Maud, the widow of James Audley junior (interestingly, a staunch royalist), in 1275, and still owed 380 of his 900 marks fine in 1272. He finally settled his debt to the queen in September 1276, but sold some pledged lands, and remained in debt until his death. Meanwhile, he was restored to favour, served in Wales in 1277 and the 1280s, was a royal banneret by 1285&#150;6, and attended parliament at Shrewsbury in 1283 and the military council at Gloucester in 1287. At an unknown date he had married Alice, and he died in either 1290 or 1291.<br>
