<span class="headword">Savage <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Henry]</span>,  Sarah</span>  (1664&#150;1752), <span class="occ">diarist</span>, was born on 7 August 1664 at Broad Oak, Flintshire, the eldest daughter and third child of a prominent nonconformist minister and diarist, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12976/', "Philip Henry (1631&#150;1696)")</script>, and his wife, Katherine Matthews (1629&#150;1707). Precocious, she was taught while very young to read English by the Revd William Turner and Hebrew by her father; at six or seven she could already read and construe a Hebrew psalm. In childhood she also began a practice continued into old age of summarizing the sermons she had heard preached, because she found reading such reminders comforting and instructive. At sixteen she began participating in holy communion, wherein &#145;through [the Lord's] goodness, I found great sweetness&#146;  (Williams, 30). Thereafter, following the teachings of her father, she aimed to show her faith by zeal for good works. On 25 March 1687, with some reluctance, she married a pious widower with one child, her relative John Savage (<i>d</i>. 1729), a farmer and land agent living at Wrenbury Wood, near Nantwich in Cheshire. The marriage was ultimately a happy one, and their home became a meeting place for fellow dissenters. Throughout her life she would be fond of reading religious works. She also became known in her community as a generous giver of alms.<br>
<br>Diary-keeping was an important part of the Henry family's religious observance. Sarah's father began his in 1657 and continued it until his death, and her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12975/', "Matthew Henry")</script> and her sister Ann Hulton also kept diaries. Sarah's began in August 1686 and, like those of the rest of her family, her diary was concerned with the close scrutiny of the use of her time, and scrupulously analysed her sinful nature. She became the conscientious recorder of her own lapses, albeit concerned also that her husband should not become over-involved in worldly concerns. Sarah had resolved to follow the four rules for a godly woman set down by her father: &#145;obedience to her husband, chastity in conversation, sobriety in adornment, and a &#147;meek and quiet spirit&#148;&#146;  (Crawford, &#145;Katharine and Philip Henry&#146;, 50). Men and women were to respect the division of labour between the sexes, and a woman's highest achievement was to be &#145;a fruitful vine and a nursing mother&#146;  (ibid.). Although Sarah's diary is primarily a spiritual self-examination, in the first years of her marriage it reveals also her desires for a child, sometimes very directly. Thus, supported by her faith but conflicted by desire and fearing barrenness, in October 1687 she writes:<blockquote>If God should see good to delay or totally deny the mercy of children to me still by his grace I will wait on him, and love him not one jot the less, tho' I sometimes can scarce quiet my spirit as I would. (Crawford, &#145;Attitudes to pregnancy&#146;, 44)</blockquote>In 1688, the year when she came safely through smallpox, she also finally bore a premature but surviving son in December (there had already been one miscarriage earlier), but he died on the 18th. After these early disappointments, however, she proved fruitful; on 13 May 1701 she bore her eighth child, Hannah. She produced in all nine children, four of whom, all girls, would survive her and marry. Other disappointments than the death of her first-born (and of her fourth child, a son, on 29 December 1705) were that Philip, her only son to survive birth, died of smallpox at twenty-two in 1721, and that on 27 September 1729 her husband died after forty-two years of marriage. But she never repines in her diary at God's will, ever grateful instead for divine goodness while assured of her own unworthiness. The diary is not entirely limited to self-examination or even personal matters, though her religious concerns dominate it. She is patriot enough to note, for example, King William's part in the battle of the Boyne in 1690 and his death in 1702. Her dedication to her family is a continual theme; her resolution that children are &#145;arrows in the hand and need to be rightly guided&#146;  (Crawford, &#145;Katharine and Philip Henry&#146;, 45) reflects her wish to bring up her children in godliness. However, her diary reveals a tension between Christian love for her children and &#145;creature love&#146;: in 1702 she writes that her greatest sin is &#145;too much love, and too many cares for, my children&#146;  (ibid., 51). Domestic work is seen as necessary and part of a woman's duty but unavoidably worldly, and in her correspondence Sarah frequently apologizes for her attention to family life for its own sake rather than for its spiritual significance.<br>
<br>Following her husband's death, and after living for a while with her children and with friends, in 1736 Sarah Savage moved to West Bromwich, Staffordshire, her home until her sudden death on 27 February 1752. She was buried in the churchyard of West Bromwich; her funeral sermon was preached on 15 March 1752 by the Revd Mr Howell, dissenting minister. She left behind her diary, continued until her final year, of which only the first original volume survives, at Chester Record Office, although transcripts exist elsewhere. With the aid of these, the nineteenth-century nonconformist writer John Bickerton Williams, a relative of the Henry family, compiled a memoir of her life and thoughts for publication in 1818 as an example of &#145;female virtue &hellip; for the imitation and guidance of succeeding generations&#146;  (Williams, v). Williams selected examples from the diary that would emphasize his subject's piety and showed little interest in, for example, the family's financial matters, but this attempt to present Sarah Savage as an example of the religious life to nineteenth-century women would not have surprised her. She had, indeed, continued her record hoping that posthumously &#145;it may be useful to some of mine &hellip; for their quickening &hellip; in the narrow way&#146;  (Williams, 236).<br>
