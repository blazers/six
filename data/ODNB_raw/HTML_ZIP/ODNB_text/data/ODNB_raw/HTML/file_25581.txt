<span class="headword">Simpson, Sir  George</span>  (1786/7?&#150;1860), <span class="occ">governor of the Hudson's Bay Company</span>, was born in the parish of Lochbroom in the Scottish highlands, son of George Simpson. An illegitimate child, he was brought up by his father's family, particularly by his aunt Mary Simpson. After attending the parish school he seems to have gone to London about 1800 where he was found employment by his uncle Geddes Mackenzie Simpson, partner in the London sugar brokers Graham and Simpson. This partnership merged with Wedderburn &amp; Co. in 1812 and, through Andrew Wedderburn, Simpson was brought into contact with the Hudson's Bay Company.<br>
<br>In the first twenty years of the nineteenth century, the Hudson's Bay Company fought a bitter battle with the rival Canadian-based North West Company, a battle which was increasingly inimical to the successful prosecution of trade. Wedderburn&#151;who by now had changed his name to Colville and was on the governing body of the Hudson's Bay Company&#151;successfully urged the appointment of Simpson as locum governor-in-chief in 1820, hoping that his unemotive business sense and bargaining ability would put the area's trade on a steadier and more rational footing. Surprised by the appointment to a part of the world of which he knew little, Simpson immediately sailed for North America, arriving in Montreal in 1820. He at once began negotiations for an end to hostilities with the North West Company, ever ready to use the expertise and experience of Hudson's Bay officers, and quick to perceive that what was needed was a business accommodation, not a battle treaty in the style of the earlier, rather theatrical, dealings between the two companies. In March 1821 the companies amalgamated: Simpson was appointed one of two governors and, unexpectedly, found himself in charge of the northern department, the more promising of the two areas into which the companies' territories had been divided.<br>
<br>Simpson proved an able if autocratic governor, adept at reconciling officers who had a little earlier been bitter rivals, and shrewd at spotting and rewarding talented fur traders. He was helped by the fact that the fur trade prospered and the men were well rewarded. In 1824 he began the most remarkable of his transcontinental journeys during which he acquired the reputation for keen observation, determination, and great speed of travel. He reached the Pacific Ocean from Hudson Bay in eighty-four days (twenty fewer than the previous record), and, once there, set about plans to expand trade in the face of competition from the Russians and the Americans. His vigour and vision were rewarded in 1839 when he was made governor of both departments of the company. He moved his headquarters from York Factory to Lachine, which was close to Montreal, more accessible from England, and the base for company canoes bound for the west. He continued the rapid journeys across the company's territories, cultivating his reputation for action and enabling him to prepare detailed firsthand reports for the company's London committee on new trading areas and routes.<br>
<br>In 1829 he visited to England to seek a wife, finding one in his cousin Frances Ramsay Simpson (1812/13&#150;1853), daughter of his uncle Geddes; they married on 24 February 1830. Simpson's earlier relationships with several women of mixed European/Amerindian blood had been formalized as marriages, according to local custom, but, unlike other officers in the same position, he treated the liaisons simply as arrangements for his sexual gratification. He cut all contact with his former partners after his marriage, and, although he continued to provide for his several illegitimate children in Britain and Canada, he kept them at a distance from his wife and their five surviving children. The marriage was not very happy: Simpson was far older than his wife and rather autocratic; she found life in Canada isolated and her health suffered, particularly after the death in infancy of one of their children.<br>
<br>Simpson became one of the leading figures of the Montreal business community, using his political and business contacts in the company's interests and to promote his own banking, rail, and mining ventures. His position in the company earned him the nickname the Emperor of the Plains. He was knighted in 1841 in recognition of his services to Arctic exploration after having encouraged the journeys of Thomas Simpson, his nephew, and Peter Warren Dease.<br>
<br>Simpson's position brought him into the world of politics as well as trade. In 1838 he visited St Petersburg and negotiated a treaty by which the Russians leased the Alaskan peninsula to the Hudson's Bay Company. He tried to resist American penetration of the Columbia River territories and helped shape British government policy in the area, although American interests ultimately prevailed. Hoping to observe the situation in the Pacific west and in Alaska, at the same time as realizing a personal ambition, he decided in 1841 to travel round the world, accompanied (because of failing eyesight) by a secretary, Edward Martin Hopkins. Setting out from London in 1841, he reached North America, and then crossed it, riding eleven hours a day to gratify his passion for speed. Travelling up the west coast he decided to rationalize the company's organization by closing all but one of the permanent trading posts. He then pressed on to the Sandwich (later, Hawaiian) Islands, forming the opinion that the company's interests would be best served if they remained independent; an opinion which in 1842 and 1843 he succeeded in persuading the British, French, and Belgian governments to adopt. After a further quick visit to Alaska, he headed for Russia and thence London, where he arrived in October 1842 after a journey remarkable for its speed despite his business engagements <i>en route</i>. He continued his voyages almost to the end of his life, finding canoe travel particularly invigorating, but he became increasingly firmly based in Montreal and in 1849, at his request, relinquished the supervision of the Red River territory.<br>
<br>In 1857 Simpson successfully resisted plans that control of Rupert's Land pass from the company to Canada, although this was to happen after his death. By 1859 he was physically weakened and announced his intention to retire. In 1860 he suffered attacks of apoplexy, from which he recovered enough to entertain the prince of Wales, who visited Montreal that summer, before a renewed attack rendered him unconscious and led to his death on 7 September 1860 at Lachine, Montreal. He was buried at Mount Royal cemetery, Montreal, next to his wife. He left over &pound;100,000, principally to his surviving son John Henry Pelly Simpson, with substantial grants to his four legitimate daughters and a tiny annuity to one of his illegitimate children. Ruthless and autocratic at times, he served the interests of the Hudson's Bay Company with great devotion and very considerable business acumen.<br>
