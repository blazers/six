<span class="headword">Peel,  John</span>  (1776&#150;1854), <span class="occ">huntsman</span>, was born on 13 November 1776 at Park End Cottage, Caldbeck, Cumberland, the son of William Peel, a farmer and horse dealer, and Lettice Scott. In 1797 he eloped with Mary White of Uldale to Gretna in Scotland, where young couples could be married easily, quickly, and without parental consent; they were married on 18 December. It was a happy union, and of their thirteen children only one died young. Peel's love of hunting was remarkable. For fifty-five years he maintained, at his sole expense, a pack, usually of twelve couples, of hounds, and generally kept two horses. He had a faultless knowledge of the country and of hunting, and was long aided by his eldest son, &#145;Young John&#146;. He was a coarse, heavy-drinking, rather selfish man, but could also be generous and passionate.<br>
<br>Peel's reputation was largely attributable to the song celebrating his prowess as a hunter by his friend John Woodcock Graves. This was written during the winter of 1829, when Peel and Graves were planning a hunting expedition in the parlour of the inn at Caldbeck. A casual question from Graves's daughter as to the words sung to an old Cumberland rant (tune), &#145;Bonnie Annie&#146;, caused Graves to write impromptu &#145;D'ye ken John Peel&#146;, the five verses of which he sang to the ancient air (William Metcalfe, the choirmaster of Carlisle Cathedral, set the verses to its actual music in 1869). Graves jokingly prophesied that Peel would &#145;be sung when we've both run to earth&#146;. Few songs have so firmly established themselves in popular estimation and so significantly helped to create and diffuse an image of Cumberland.<br>
<br>Late in his life Peel's neighbours and friends, including Sir Wilfrid Lawson and George Moore the philanthropist, presented him with a sum of money in acknowledgement of his long services. Besides his patrimonial estate at Caldbeck, Peel acquired, through his wife, a property at Ruthwaite, on which his last years were spent. There he died on 13 November 1854, probably from a hunting injury. He was buried, and a headstone erected over his grave, ornamented with emblems of the chase, in the churchyard at Caldbeck.<br>
<br>Graves, who was born in a house next to the Market Hall in the High Street of Wigton in Cumberland on 9 February 1795, emigrated to Van Diemen's Land in 1833, and settled in Hobart Town, where he died on 17 August 1886, leaving a large family. He published <span class="italic">Songs and Ballads of Cumberland</span> and a <span class="italic">Monody on John Peel</span>.<br>
