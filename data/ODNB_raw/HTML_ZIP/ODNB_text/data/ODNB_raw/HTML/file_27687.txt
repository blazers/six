</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Trelawny,  Edward John</span>  (1792&#150;1881), <span class="occ">writer and adventurer</span>, was born on 13 November 1792 probably at his grandfather's house at 9 Soho Square, London. His father was Charles Trelawny (1757&#150;1820), formerly a lieutenant colonel in the Coldstream Guards, later MP for Mitchell, who was made rich by the death of a cousin in 1798, and his wife, Mary (or Maria), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hawkins (1759&#150;1852). Trelawny later described his father as an oafish brute, but he seems to have been fond of his mother. He had one elder brother, Harry, and four younger sisters. In <span class="italic">Adventures of a Younger Son</span> (see below) he reports how, at the age of five, assisted by Harry, he killed, taking some time over the deed, a clip-winged raven, his father's pet, which had scared a small female friend of his. Both boys were sent to the Royal Fort Boarding School, run by the Revd Samuel Seyer in Bristol, from which (as he reports in <span class="italic">Adventures</span>) Trelawny was expelled for attacking both an under-master and the headmaster, and for attempting to burn the place down, in revenge for the continuous floggings he had received.<br>
<br>In October 1805 Trelawny joined the navy, in 1806 attended Dr Burney's Navigation School at Gosport (where he was taught no more than he had been in Bristol), and, in various ships, circumnavigated the globe. He took in Mauritius (assisting at its capture from the French), India, Ceylon, the East Indies, Cape Horn, the River Plate, and St Helena. He was wounded in the knee and face in the English attack on Java in August 1811. A musket ball remained in his knee until 1844, when Robert Browning witnessed its removal. He was transferred from ship to ship, guilty (by his own later account) of frequent assaults on his superior officers. He was invalided out of the navy in 1812, a midshipman still, not having been offered a commission. His father gave him an allowance of &pound;300 a year.<br>
<br>In May 1813 Trelawny married Caroline Julia Addison (<i>b</i>. 1794), the nineteen-year-old daughter of an East India merchant. They had two daughters, Maria Julia and Eliza, but in 1816 Caroline left him for her lover, the much older Captain Coleman, and Trelawny divorced her in proceedings which lasted from 1817 to 19 May 1819, and involved much humiliating publicity. Once rid of both unfaithful wife and blighted naval career, he started to read books for the first time, Lord Byron and Shakespeare especially. Byron's heroes fascinated him, as more charismatic and successful versions of himself.<br>
<br>In autumn 1819 Trelawny accompanied his mother and sisters to Paris. The ladies returned, but he moved on to Geneva, which bored him. He made friends with the retired naval captain Daniel Roberts, who shared his keenness for hunting and fishing. At Ouchy he first read Percy Bysshe Shelley, with whose politics, as revealed in <span class="italic">Queen Mab</span>, he could identify. At the house of Sir John St Aubyn near Geneva he met Edward Ellerker Williams, and Shelley's cousin Thomas Medwin. Very briefly, he encountered the Wordsworths. His father's death in 1820 left him no better off. He returned to England, but was soon back hunting with Roberts in the Alps.<h2>
<a name="FriendshipwithShelleyandByron"></a>Friendship with Shelley and Byron</h2>In 1822, at the invitation of Williams, Trelawny left Geneva for Pisa (he arrived on 14 January), where he met Shelley and Byron, and the two legendary episodes in his life began. Byron liked him both despite, and because of, the fact that he seemed to model his physical image and his doubtful autobiographical tales on those of Conrad, protagonist of Byron's <span class="italic">Corsair</span>&#151;a copy of which he was rumoured to keep beneath his pillow. Trelawny was in fact more attracted to the idealistic Shelley than to the satirical Byron: in Shelley's more overt anti-establishment attitudes he found a theoretical justification for his own juvenile rebelliousness. He became&#151;retroactively&#151;a democrat and a republican (one of his great heroes had always been John Paul Jones).<br>
<br>In the aborted Pisan circle production of <span class="italic">Othello</span>, Trelawny was to have taken the lead, with Byron as Iago. Mary Shelley found his company delightful, and he escorted her to balls and carnivals. He was present at the Pisan affray on 24 March 1822, when Sergeant-Major Masi knocked Shelley off his horse, though he played no important part in it. (In his old age he would show off a dagger which, he said, a blind beggar had given him to defend himself against Masi.) Byron saw through his fantasizing with ease and amusement: &#145;Trelawny could not even to save his life tell the truth&#146;, he said. However, he admired Trelawny's practical skills. Trelawny arranged, via Daniel Roberts, for the building of the <i>Don Juan</i> (in which Shelley, Williams, and Charles Vivian were to drown) and of Byron's schooner the <i>Bolivar</i>. Byron employed him as its captain.<br>
<br>Trelawny writes that he was, through his spyglass, the last person to see Shelley and Williams disappear into the squall off Leghorn on 8 July 1822. He took personal charge of the search for their bodies, and planned and carried through the pagan rites in which the disintegrated corpses were cremated, on the shore of Tuscany and at Viareggio, on 15 and 16 August 1822. It was he who snatched Shelley's unburnt heart from the flames. Both Mary Shelley and Jane Williams found him a great comforter at this terrible time. He would sit with them for hours, speaking in praise of their husbands. In April 1823 he organized the removal of Shelley's ashes to the pyramid of Caius Cestius in the protestant cemetery at Rome, the planting of ten trees next to them, and the addition of three lines from Ariel's song in <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> (&#145;Nothing of him that doth fade &hellip;&#146;) to the inscription.<br>
<br>Trelawny had, on first meeting her on 22 February 1822, fallen in love with Claire Clairmont, Mary Shelley's half-stepsister, the mother of Byron's deceased daughter Allegra. He also had a casual affair with Gabrielle Wright, wife of the <i>Bolivar</i>'s designer; but Claire meant much more to him. However, though they may briefly have been lovers, Claire would not marry him, and she left Italy for Austria and then Russia.<h2>
<a name="ToGreecewithByron"></a>To Greece with Byron</h2>When Byron started on his own terminal Greek adventure, Trelawny was happy to answer the poet's request to go with him. Byron wrote, &#145;I shall like your company of all things.&#146; They sailed from Genoa on 21 July 1823. Though Trelawny boxed, fenced, and swam with Byron, he would not wear the pretentious Homeric helmet the poet had had designed for him. Once they had arrived in the Ionian Islands, Byron's unwillingness to move annoyed Trelawny, and with James Hamilton Browne he crossed to the mainland on 6 September 1823, with letters of introduction from Byron, to visit the &#145;seat of Greek government&#146; at Tripolitsa, to investigate the situation as Byron's agent. He was never to see Byron again alive.<br>
<br>Wearing Greek, not western clothes, he arrived at Tripolitsa, where he met the occidentally-clad Alexander Mavrocordato, whom he at once despised, and the Greek-clad Theodore Colocotrones, whom he admired. Passing through to Corinth, he noted the horrible remains of the victims&#151;human and animal&#151;of Colocotrones' victory over the Turks the previous year in the gorge at Dervenakia. Hamilton Browne departed for London to assist in the raising of a loan; at Athens, Trelawny purchased fifteen or so women, and set up a harem, with which, however, he was soon bored. He became an associate of the Greek warlord Odysseus Androutses, whom he was alone in describing as &#145;a glorious being&#146;, and soon became a leader of <i>klephts</i> himself, helping Androutses to storm the Turkish fort at Negroponte (Euboea) without success, and burning several Greek villages without conscience. His capacity for endurance, and indifference to discomfort, endeared him to his men.<br>
<br>When Byron's death was announced, Trelawny hurried to Missolonghi, to take care of the funeral arrangements again, and was disappointed by the decision to send the poet's remains home. But he did (as he reports) take the opportunity to look into the coffin at Byron's withered limb (or limbs&#151;he wrote conflicting accounts of what he saw), and wrote letters about his own vital part in the Greek expedition, explaining that it had been he who suggested that Byron should renounce his quiet life in Italy, and go there in the first place.<br>
<br>After the drama of Byron's death had died down, Trelawny affected to despise his memory. Byron had been &#145;weak and ignoble&#146;, where he, Trelawny, had been decisive and active. He now tried to take control of the Greek situation as he thought Byron ought to have, but only succeeded in making himself unpopular and ridiculous, and soon drifted back into the service of Androutses, even though Androutses was now planning to go over to the Turks. In the well-fortified Mavre Troupa (&#145;Black Hole&#146;) cave, high on Parnassus, he married Androutses's half-sister Tersitza, whose age was probably thirteen. Bride and groom had no language in common.<br>
<br>Androutses was, however, arrested and imprisoned in the Venetian tower on the Acropolis. Trelawny was now in command, though only of the Black Hole. But he was not safe there. On 11 June 1825, one of two of Mavrocordato's agents, William Whitcombe, shot him twice at point blank range, but missed all vital organs. The gun of the other agent, Thomas Fenton, failed to go off. Trelawny's jaw was shattered and his mouth immobilized, but he refused all medical treatment and insisted that nature be allowed to take her course. His body cured itself in five weeks, assisted by small helpings of water and egg yolk. Fenton had been shot dead on the spot; once Trelawny realized he was going to survive, he magnanimously let Whitcombe go. The dead body of Androutses was found soon after at the foot of the Acropolis.<br>
<br>Emaciated, with his right arm paralysed and three teeth missing, Trelawny left the cave, and was shipped&#151;with a free passage from Mavrocordato, but without the blessing of the Foreign Office&#151;back to the Ionian Islands. Tersitza, now pregnant, went with him. On Cefalonia, in June 1826, she bore a daughter, Zella, but on the conception of another child left him to go into a convent. The second child died, and the seventeen-year-old Tersitza managed to divorce Trelawny. He recovered the full use of his right arm, and only a slight hunch remained to tell of what had happened.<br>
<br>In 1828 Trelawny returned to England, where he proposed marriage to Mary Shelley, who refused him. Also in 1828 he met Claire Clairmont, and proposed to her again, with the same result. In 1829 he decided to go to Florence, where he was joined by all three of his daughters, although Eliza died. He stayed with John Keats's friend Charles Armitage Brown, and met Walter Savage Landor, who put him and Tersitza into one of his <span class="italic">Imaginary Conversations</span>. Between 1828 and 1831 he called himself John Edward Trelawny.<h2>
<a name="AdventuresofaYoungerSon"></a>Adventures of a Younger Son</h2>In 1831 Trelawny published, anonymously, his &#145;autobiography&#146;, <span class="italic">Adventures of a Younger Son</span>, in the style, spelling, and moral editing of which he was assisted by Armitage Brown, Landor, and Mary Shelley. The title was chosen by Mary Shelley and the publisher, Colburn. Each chapter has an epigraph from either Byron, Shelley, or Keats. The book is as imaginative as any poem by Byron (though the early chapters seem trustworthy). There are echoes of <span class="italic">Don Juan</span>, especially of Canto 2. Trelawny tells of his adventures in the East, and of his <i>renegado</i> career as a French-backed anti-British privateer, led by a Dutch-American, Shakespeare-reading buccaneer called De Ruyter. There are cruel pranks, sea fights, land raids, a shipboard orgy, and a tiger hunt from which only the elephants emerge with credit. Though the protagonist advertises himself as a foe to oppressors, selective oppression is what he excels at. Scotsmen, surgeons, and other human annoyances exist only to be beaten up or dropped into pits of offal, buildings exist only to be burnt or pulled down, and animals only to be hamstrung, shot, or eaten. Remorse is occasionally expressed for the destruction thus caused. There is a teenage heroine called Zela, whom Trelawny marries, and who learns to take violent initiatives by his side. Very little of the material is verifiable or otherwise, and, almost certainly, none of it is true, though Trelawny might have been thrown off balance had such a thing been pointed out at the time. As a self-portrait it is disagreeable; but the book was a great success, and made Trelawny famous at last; it was said that Byron had modelled Conrad, and even Manfred, on him.<br>
<br>In January 1832 Trelawny sailed to America, in search of adventure, but found none. He met Fenimore Cooper, and John Philip and Fanny Kemble, with whom he visited Niagara, where he swam the rapids, in emulation of Byron's more numerous swimming feats. He became very fond of Fanny Kemble, but she was engaged already. He also met and admired the great engineer Christian Detmold. He visited New Haven, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston, but despite the celebrity status he enjoyed, became bored and disillusioned, and returned to England early in 1835.<br>
<br>Back in England Trelawny found no role. His fame continued, although his dabbling in chic radical politics did him no good. He was friendly with Bulwer, Brougham, and Mrs Jameson, frequented Lady Blessington's dinners, and figures as the Byronic story-telling bore Captain Sumph in William Makepeace Thackeray's <span class="italic">Pendennis</span>, and as the heroic Borromeo in William Godwin's <span class="italic">Cloudesley</span>. When Mary Shelley brought out her first edition of her husband's poems in 1839, Trelawny was outraged at the cuts she made&#151;especially in the notes for <span class="italic">Queen Mab</span>&#151;and their friendship ceased.<br>
<br>In 1839 Trelawny retired from society and lived in Putney, a self-proclaimed vegetarian, teetotaller, and eschewer of both underwear and overcoats. He had in 1838 started the longest relationship of his life, with Augusta, the separated wife of Harry, the future Lord Goring. She was a friend of Mary Shelley. On 5 August 1839 she bore him a son, Edgar (called, to avoid scandal, John Granby). Harry Goring obtained a divorce in 1841. Trelawny and Augusta married, a daughter, Laetitia, was born, and they moved to Usk in Monmouthshire, where Trelawny first built a house and then bought a nearby farm, which he worked with skill and industry, becoming a valued member of the community. Another son, Frank, was born. His Greek daughter Zella, now Mrs Olguin, sometimes came over from Italy. The family lived happily together until 1858, when Trelawny started a liaison with a teenage girl whose identity seems irrecoverable (she was known as Miss B). Augusta left him and went to Italy, and Trelawny took Miss B to London, where she was to be replaced in turn by another young woman called Emma Taylor.<h2>
<a name="RecollectionsoftheLastDaysofShelleyandByron"></a>Recollections of the Last Days of Shelley and Byron</h2>In 1858 Trelawny published <span class="italic">Recollections of the Last Days of Shelley and Byron</span>, and in 1878 a rewritten version, the more confidently entitled <span class="italic">Records of Shelley, Byron and the Author</span>. In the earlier work he gives Byron two clubbed feet, but in the later, just one shrivelled Achilles tendon. However, these narratives brought him fame all over again, and made him a favourite among the Victorians, who found in him a link to the mighty dead whose early reputations for freethinking and free living they had sanitized. His portrait of Shelley, especially, was recognized as more accurate than the cleaned-up versions produced by the colleagues of Lady Shelley, daughter-in-law to Percy Bysshe. Both his books of reminiscence may, with cross-checking, be used as reliable and vivid first-hand accounts. Trelawny's insistence on Shelley's republicanism and atheism was accepted with tolerance. He was introduced to Benjamin Disraeli. <span class="italic">Adventures of a Younger Son</span> had been reprinted, to acclaim, its confession of Trelawny's &#145;desertion&#146; from the navy ignored. Even his most readily disprovable assertion&#151;that he had known Keats&#151;went unchallenged. The positive reading of his character, which made his eccentricity evidence of his sincerity and strength, won the day. Like Teresa Guiccioli (Byron's last mistress), he had come to believe his own fabricated version of the past, but, unlike Teresa Guiccioli, he persuaded the world to believe it too.<br>
<br>Trelawny's last years were spent at 7 Pelham Crescent, Brompton, and in a house at Sompting, near Worthing. He died at Sompting on 13 August 1881. In accordance with his wishes, his corpse was transported to Gotha, Germany, where it was cremated, and his ashes were taken by Emma Taylor to Rome, where they were buried in the protestant cemetery in the plot, next to Shelley's, which he had purchased in 1823.<br>
<br>Trelawny had an imposing, 6 foot physical presence, with dark piercing eyes, tanned Arab features (according to Mary Shelley's description), a long, curling moustache, a deep and gentle though monotonous voice, and an extremely powerful constitution. Robert Browning reports that he endured the extraction of the bullet from his knee with all the equanimity of a man having his hair cut. His sense of humour was rough, not sophisticated. Irony both eluded and defeated him. To both accurate spelling and personal hygiene he was a stranger. In Greece especially, he saw tolerance of dirt and lice as a manly thing, and, although mild dyslexia may be suspected (he often spelt his own name Jhon), his supposed orthographical incompetence may in later years have formed part of a calculated image. His egotism was huge, as was his capacity for revengeful violence, of which he was proud. He despised those who endured suffering meekly. But he was capable of great generosity.<br>
<br>There are portraits of Trelawny by W. E. West and Joseph Severn, and sketches by Sir Edwin Henry Landseer, E. Duppa, Count d'Orsay, Severn, and Seymour Kirkup. Trelawny figures in <span class="italic">The Cremation of Shelley's Body</span> by Fournier and G&eacute;r&ocirc;me (he assisted the painters with detailed notes, which they mostly ignored), and as the old man in <span class="italic">The North-West Passage</span> by Millais. Several photographs were taken in his old age.<br>
<br>Edward John Trelawny was his own worst enemy in the story of the English Romantic movement. If he had not embroidered his role in such confused and dubious ways, he would be known correctly for what he was: one of its most significant and colourful ancillaries.<br>
