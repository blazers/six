<span class="headword">Warton,  Jane</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1724, <em>d.</em> 1809), <span class="occ">author</span>, was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28798/', "Thomas Warton (1688&#150;1745)")</script> and his wife, Elizabeth (1691&#150;1762), daughter of Joseph Richardson, rector of Dunsfield, Surrey, and sister to the &#145;two learned brothers&#146; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28799/', "Thomas Warton (1728&#150;1790)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28796/', "Joseph Warton (bap. 1722, d. 1800)")</script>. She was baptized on 20 August 1724 at Basingstoke, Hampshire, where her father was vicar and master of the grammar school. She contributed a poem on her father's death, &#145;Ode on the Death of the Author, by a Lady&#146;, to the volume of <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> which her brothers produced in 1748 in an effort to raise money to clear their father's debts. Her literary interests were marked and her critical abilities were respected within the family. In 1753 Joseph invited her to write an essay for Johnson's <span class="italic">Adventurer</span>, and <span class="italic">Adventurer</span>, no. 87, &#145;Politeness a necessary auxiliary to knowledge and virtue&#146;, may be by her. Also in 1753 she began working as a governess to the two daughters of William Thoyts of Whitechapel and Carshalton. She remained close to Joan (<i>b</i>. 1747) and Mary Anne (<i>b</i>. 1749) for the rest of her life. Her first major publication was the anonymous <span class="italic">Letters Addressed to Two Young Married Ladies, on the Most Interesting Subjects</span> (2 vols., 1782) which was addressed to them.<br>
<br>Though anonymous, Warton's writing was not secret: Joseph wrote to her in 1781: &#145;I am rejoiced to find you are becoming one of Us&#151;Authors I mean. Depend on my doing my Utmost with Dodsley&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., Don c 75, fol. 38). Like her friend Hester Mulso Chapone she found her way into becoming &#145;one of Us&#151;Authors&#146; by writing prescriptive literature aimed specifically at women. The <span class="italic">Letters</span> concern themselves with questions of morality and behaviour, with a particular emphasis on the role of the mother (or governess) in child-rearing. They advocate early learning; stress the duties of life and the necessity of religion, humility, and compassion; and pay particular attention to girls' education in a way which foreshadows Mary Wollstonecraft's later work. In 1783 James Dodsley published her novel <span class="italic">Peggy and Patty, or, The Sisters of Ashdale</span>, in four volumes. This novel both makes clear her identification with the Wollstonecraftian feminism of her own time and, in its sympathy for the fallen woman, anticipates the preoccupations of Victorian feminists. It develops the idea expressed in <span class="italic">Letters</span> that virtuous women should show charity to &#145;unfortunate women&#146;, the seduced and abandoned, because &#145;the villainy of men&#146; knows no bounds. It is only &#145;particular circumstances&#146; that protect fortunate women: &#145;these wretched women were once happy and innocent as yourselves&#146;  (Warton, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.35). Peggy and Patty are happy, innocent country curate's daughters who go to London to find work and are lured into a brothel, drugged, raped, ruined, and turned into courtesans. The attractions of the courtesan's life are well shown: as the madam of the brothel says, &#145;who lives so grand as a kept lady? How infinitely is her situation to be preferred to a poor devil of a wife&#146;  (Warton, <span class="italic">Peggy and Patty</span>, 1.140). If the &#145;unbridled lust&#146; of men is the initial danger, it is women's subsequent economic dependence on men in a society that offers so few employment opportunities that destroys them. Once turned off, Peggy and Patty have only the streets to go to and only their bodies to trade. In a number of affecting scenes they sicken, starve, and die in a garret. Though sentimental, the novel reveals a caustic impatience with the double standard. It is vividly written and outspoken.<br>
<br>Very little is known about Jane Warton's life, and the observations of others build a picture of an &#145;unfortunate girl&#146;, who had &#145;a Warton Genius, totally perverse in worldly affairs&#146;  (H. Reid, &#145;Jenny: the fourth Warton&#146;, <span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 231, 1986, 84). Warton died, unmarried, at Wickham, Hampshire, on 3 November 1809. In her obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> it was declared that she was disabled by rheumatism and could &#145;only move on her knees&#146;. This, while metaphorically suggestive, seems most unlikely on the evidence available.<br>
