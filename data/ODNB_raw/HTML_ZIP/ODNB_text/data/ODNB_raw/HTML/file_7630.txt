<span class="headword">Digby,  Kenelm Henry</span>  (1795/6&#150;1880), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born at Geashill, King's county, Ireland, the younger of the two sons of the Very Revd William Digby (<i>c</i>.1735&#150;1812), dean of Clonfert, and his third wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wood, of Devon descent, widow of William Cooper. The Irish branch of the Digby family had provided a baron in the seventeenth century, bishops of Dromore and Elphin in the eighteenth, and had originated from a Leicestershire branch of the same name. Kenelm Henry Digby inherited his powerful physique from his father, who had been a considerable athlete, was over 6 feet tall, had a swarthy complexion, and dark hair and eyes. The deaths of his father in 1812, of his mother shortly after, and of his elder brother, Richard Edward, in 1820, provided him with ample independent means and the ability to finance the publication of his works.<br>
<br>Digby was educated at Petersham, near Richmond, Surrey, and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, on 22 October 1814 at the age of eighteen. Having taken his degree in mathematics in 1819, he continued to keep his rooms at Trinity as a base until 1829. In 1820 he won a Norrisian prize for an essay on the evidences of the Christian religion, regarded as displaying a wide range of reading, although not closely reasoned. The rest of his considerable literary output showed precisely these characteristics; his creativity was derivative rather than imaginative. During travel in France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, he researched the culture of the middle ages and the concept of chivalry, resulting in his first published work, <span class="italic">The Broadstone of Honour, or, Rules for the Gentlemen of England</span>, in 1822, and his reception into the Roman Catholic church in 1825 by Father Edward Scott SJ. With Ambrose Phillipps De Lisle, an undergraduate at Trinity with whom he had a long friendship, he rode each Sunday to mass at the nearest Roman Catholic chapel, at the seminary of Old Hall, St Edmund's, Ware, a journey of 26 miles each way. His relationship with De Lisle endured, but a coolness developed when Digby did not share enthusiasm for the members of the Oxford Movement and De Lisle's attitude towards corporate reunion of the churches. Some of their correspondence is preserved by the De Lisle family. Over a hundred letters to another close friend and fellow Roman Catholic, Squire Richard Huddleston of Sawston Hall, are held in the Cambridgeshire Record Office.<br>
<br>Digby rewrote <span class="italic">The Broadstone of Honour</span> after his conversion, with the subtitle <span class="italic">The True Sense and Practice of Chivalry</span>, in four lengthy parts between 1826 and 1829. It and the eleven long volumes of <span class="italic">Mores Catholici, or, Ages of Faith</span> (1831&#150;42), and seven volumes of <span class="italic">Compitum, or, The Meeting of the Ways at the Catholic Church</span>, written between 1848 and 1854, were his major works. The remainder, five books of prose and eleven books of verse, were of less consequence, though two of the latter, <span class="italic">Ouranogaia, or, Heaven on Earth</span> (1872) and <span class="italic">The Temple of Memory</span> (1874), are of interest for their descriptions of his contemporaries at Trinity. All his work showed an uncritical and &eacute;litist view of the past, particularly of the medieval period; his style was laboured, his sentences long, and punctuation sparse; there were few paragraphs. His saving grace was the enthusiasm he was able to transmit. This undoubtedly conveyed itself to those who were open to fresh interest in the middle ages, a large number in the first half of the nineteenth century. Since Digby was, however, one of several contemporary or near contemporary writers in this vein, his particular influence is not easy to gauge. Some of his friends wrote approvingly of his works in his lifetime, but sales were slow and the fact that subsequent editions were paid for by their author makes calculation of appreciation difficult. Modern readers, used to more succinct modes of expression, would undoubtedly find his works hard going; but it is likely that they would find evidence of his character and outlook more interesting than his writing.<br>
<br>In 1833, in Dover, Digby had married Jane Mary Dillon (1816/17&#150;1860), daughter and coheir of Thomas Dillon of Mount Dillon, co. Dublin, and this had brought him further financial provision at the time. Although Irish, she had been educated in France and was sixteen when she married. The couple had seven children: Thomas, Marcella, Kenelm Thomas, Mary-Ann Letitia, John Gerard, and Mary; a fourth daughter died in infancy. The only children who survived their father were Kenelm Thomas, who became an Irish MP, Marcella, a nun, and Mary, who married the Hon. Hubert Dormer.<br>
<br>Digby lived in Paris and various towns in France until 1857 when he and his family settled in England, his literary energy still matched by physical strength. He was credited with having plunged into the Rhine, despite the current, and reaching the further shore with difficulty 3 miles downstream; also with riding a tiger from a travelling zoo. Daily swimming in the Serpentine in London was his practice in old age. He died at his home, Shaftesbury House, Hammersmith, London, on 22 March 1880, and was buried in Kensal Green Roman Catholic cemetery, London.<br>
