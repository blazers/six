<span class="headword">Cushing <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>May; <em>other married name </em>Williams]</span>,  Winifred Emma</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Patience Strong]</span>  (1907&#150;1990), <span class="occ">author and poet</span>, was born on 4 June 1907 in Catford, London, the younger daughter and second of three children of Alfred William May, postal worker at Mount Pleasant, London, and his wife, Nell Mason. She played the piano by ear at the age of four and began composing verses when very young. She was educated at the local school in Catford and then at Cusack's College, where she learned shorthand and typing. She worked in a patent agency and subsequently in a music publisher's office, which stimulated her interest in writing lyrics for popular music. She was nurtured by Lawrence Wright, an influential music publisher of the time, and among the lyrics she subsequently wrote were those for the well-known tango &#145;Jealousy&#146;, and the ballad &#145;The Dream of Olwen&#146;.<br>
<br>In August 1935, spurred by the success of the prose poem writer Wilhelmina Stitch, who wrote regularly for the <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span>, she decided to try to perform a similar service for the rival <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> and, &#145;with a poem in my pocket&#146;&#151;the subsequent title of her autobiography&#151;she visited the paper's features editor with her proposal. He was impressed and invited her to return the following day with eighteen further poems, and a suitable pseudonym for a regular column. That evening a friend visited her with the gift of a book by an American author, Adeline D. T. Whitney, with the title <span class="italic">Patience Strong</span> (1870). The next day she presented the editor with the further poems&#151;and her new name.<br>
<br>Patience Strong continued to write a daily poem for the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, without interruption, from then onwards and throughout the Second World War, under the heading &#145;The Quiet Corner&#146;, which became synonymous with her work. Some critics derided her verse for its sentimentality, but readers responded warmly to her poems and to her philosophy, feeling that they knew her personally and could confide in her; she replied to each correspondent, and her office at her home became something of an adjunct to the local post office, when servicemen and women, and those left at home, wrote to thank her for her poems and support, explaining that she had been able, through her verses, to speak for them. An example of her work is:<blockquote>
<div>Give me a window with a view that flows to meet the sky.<br>
</div>
<div>Give me a garden where the trees can feel the winds blow by &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>Give me good days and sleep-blessed nights when I have closed the door<br>
</div>
<div>&#151;and anyone can have the world. I'll never ask for more.<br>
</div> (P. Strong, <span class="italic">Give me a Quiet Corner</span>, 1972)</blockquote>In the late 1940s Strong transferred from the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> to its sister Sunday newspaper, <span class="italic">The Pictorial</span> (subsequently the <span class="italic">Sunday Mirror</span>), and she also began contributing her poems to the weekly magazine <span class="italic">Woman's Own</span>. Her sojourn with each was over forty years. Latterly her poems appeared in the quarterly journal <span class="italic">This England</span>.<br>
<br>In the late 1930s Strong's books of prose poems began publication, with <span class="italic">Every Common Bush</span> (1937), and many titles followed, published by Frederick Muller, under which imprint her books appeared until her death, when posthumous compilations were issued. Her books, which numbered more than seventy, include <span class="italic">Quiet Corner Reflections</span> (1938), <span class="italic">A Christmas Garland</span> (1948), <span class="italic">The Patience Strong Bedside Book</span> (1953), <span class="italic">The Blessings of the Years</span> (1963), <span class="italic">Come Happy Day</span> (1966), <span class="italic">A Joy Forever</span> (1973), <span class="italic">Poems from the Fighting Forties</span> (1982), and <span class="italic">Fifty Golden Years</span> (1985, to commemorate her fiftieth anniversary as Patience Strong). She also wrote many booklets with a specifically religious basis for the Henry E. Walter Company. Her posthumous publications included <span class="italic">Tapestries of Time</span> (1991) and many of her early titles were reissued by Grace Publishers. Patience Strong's poems appeared on calendars and greetings cards and similar publications for more than fifty years, and also continued to be published. Two gramophone records of the author reciting favourite poems were issued: &#145;The Quiet Hour&#146; (1963) and &#145;The Quiet Corner&#146; (1978).<br>
<br>Patience Strong was attractive in personality and appearance, and her beauty could not better have complemented the nature of her work. She was a devout Christian who explored many churches&#151;Baptist, Methodist, Church of England, Christian Science, and, in later years, the British Israel movement. Her faith in God governed her life. She had a great gift for communication, and regarded this as her mission in life. She was a countrywoman, who found her inspiration in the changing seasons of the English countryside, in all its moods, as shown in her verse:<blockquote>
<div>This is what he dreamed about beneath the desert sky:<br>
</div>
<div>brown earth breaking on the plough and white gulls wheeling by &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>This is what he fought for on a beach in Normandy:<br>
</div>
<div>parish church and village green, his English legacy.<br>
</div>
<div>These things did he know and love. He lived and died for them &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>Speak no word. The evening thrush will sing his requiem.<br>
</div> (P. Strong, <span class="italic">Magic Casements</span>, 1950)</blockquote>In 1931 Strong married the son of a master builder who was an alderman of the city of Liverpool, Frederick Arnold (Paddy) Williams, architect. He died in 1965, and in 1967 she married Guy Cushing, buyer, who had retired from the John Lewis Partnership, the son of William Isaac Cushing, draper, and his wife, Amanda, the great friend of the author who had given her the book <span class="italic">Patience Strong</span> many years before. He predeceased her in 1979. There were no children of either marriage. Patience Strong was made a freeman of the City of London in 1970. She died on 28 August 1990 at her home, Sunnyside, The Street, Sedlescombe, Sussex.<br>
