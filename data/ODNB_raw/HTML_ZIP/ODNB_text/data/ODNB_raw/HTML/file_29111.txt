<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Westfaling <span class="st"> [Westphaling]</span>,  Herbert</span>  (1531/2&#150;1602), <span class="occ">bishop of Hereford</span>, was born in London, the son of Harbert Westphaling, whose family originated in Westphalia. He entered Christ Church, Oxford, in 1547, aged fifteen, where he graduated BA in 1551 and proceeded MA in 1555. In 1561 he took the degree of BTh, and incepted DTh in 1566. In February 1562 he was ordained priest by Edmund Grindal, bishop of London, and the same year was appointed a canon of Christ Church, Oxford, through the influence of Sir William Cecil. His radical sympathies were apparent early in his career, when in 1560 he was one of a number of petitioners to the earl of Leicester who requested the appointment of Thomas Sampson as dean of Christ Church. At the end of 1562 he was appointed Lady Margaret professor of divinity, a post that he held for little more than a year. In September 1567 he was made treasurer of the diocese of Lincoln, in 1570 was mentioned by Archbishop Parker as a possible bishop of Oxford, and in 1572 was appointed to the living of Brightwell Baldwin in Oxfordshire, which he was licensed to hold in plurality. His preferments continued with his appointment as vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford in June 1576, and the acquisition of a canonry at Windsor the following May.<br>
<br>In 1576 Westfaling was appointed by Grindal, now archbishop of Canterbury, to a commission to investigate complaints against the dean and chapter of Gloucester. This resulted in a report incorporating articles for the better observance of capitular duties. The experience may well have influenced Westfaling's subsequent attitude to his own cathedral chapter after his consecration as bishop of Hereford on 30 January 1586. Since at the beginning of his primacy in autumn 1583 John Whitgift had suggested Westfaling as a possible dean of Windsor if William Day became bishop of London, it seems likely that he owed his elevation to the bench to Whitgift's further efforts and the acquiescence of Lord Burghley. Once installed at Hereford Westfaling, like his predecessor John Scory, experienced the problems of a bishop of somewhat advanced protestant views in a remote diocese with profoundly conservative religious opinions. He had particular difficulties with his own chapter, not least because of the machinations of Bishop Scory's venal and corrupt son Sylvanus, against whom Westfaling conducted a suit for dilapidations. In 1586 he castigated the vicars-choral for their suspect religious views and the use of superstitious images and pictures. Although the cathedral had been granted new statutes in 1583, they left unresolved the vexed question of the rights of the bishop to conduct visitations of the chapter. Although Westfaling insisted that the &#145;staffe or rodde of discipline God hath undoubtedly given to all trewe bishops&#146;  (Hereford Cathedral archives, 7031/2 fols. 123 ff.) his four attempts to visit, in 1586, 1588, 1589, and 1598, all met with defeat. More successful was a survey of the morals and educational qualifications of the diocesan clergy conducted in 1587. This revealed that most possessed no degree, and few of those who were licensed to preach were considered to have attained the status of &#145;painful&#146; preachers. Although Westfaling was noted for his zeal in converting Roman Catholics, and was regarded by the lords in council as a fit and able person to be employed in conferences with Jesuits and other recusants, he appears to have had little success in Hereford, for his successor Bennett complained that the diocese was full of traditionalists and recusants.<br>
<br>Westfaling was noted for his gravity, and Francis Godwin, a long-time acquaintance, commented that he had scarcely ever seen him laugh. Portraits in the bishop's palace in Hereford and the Bodleian Library, Oxford, are suitably austere in appearance. His effigy in the north transept of Hereford Cathedral, possibly by the sculptor Samuel Baldwin of Stroud, conveys a similar impression. In December 1592 he gave an oration before Queen Elizabeth in the university church, Oxford, during which he was twice ordered by the queen to be brief so that she could herself deliver a speech later in the evening. Westfaling refused to be hurried and the queen was forced to postpone her own speech until the next day.<br>
<br>In 1582 Westfaling published a collection of seven sermons under the title <span class="italic">A Treatise of Reformation in Religion</span>. He was also the author of a number of manuscript poems in English and Latin, now in the library of Cambridge University (MS Ff.v. 14); but a manuscript translation of &#145;A discourse of Quintus Cicero to his brother Marcus concerning Suete for the consulship&#146;, in the Bodleian Library (MS Rawlinson D. 303) formerly attributed to the bishop, is in fact the work of his son. His personal library contained works by leading reformers of his time, his will mentioning the works of Calvin in folio, which he donated to Christ Church, Oxford, and nine volumes by Wolfgang Musculus, which he bequeathed to Hereford Cathedral Library. Shortly before his death he donated &pound;20 to the Bodleian Library for the purchase of new books.<br>
<br>Westfaling married Anne, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1442/', "William Barlow")</script>, bishop of Chichester, and widow of Augustine Bradbridge, prebendary of Salisbury and brother of William Bradbridge, bishop of Exeter. Anne Westfaling died at Westminster on 9 December 1597, while her husband was attending parliament. The marriage produced a son and three daughters. Anne, who married William Jeffries, would appear to have remarried, as &#145;my sonne Jenkes&#146; was named with the bishop's other two sons-in-law as an overseer of his will in 1601. Margaret Westfaling was married to Richard Eedes, dean of Worcester, while her sister Elizabeth married Robert Walwyn of Newland, Worcestershire, from whose father Westfaling purchased an estate at Batch, in Herefordshire; he subsequently bequeathed it to Jesus College, Oxford, to endow two fellowships and scholarships. Significantly, the bequest contained the proviso that &#145;my kindred shallbe always preferred before anie others&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/99, sig. 12, fol. 90<i>r</i>). Westfaling also acquired the Herefordshire manor of Mansell Gamage, and in 1591 conveyed it to his son, Herbert, whose heirs possessed it until the late eighteenth century. Westfaling died at Hereford on 1 March 1602, and was buried in the north transept of his cathedral. His will contained generous provision for his servants and for the poor of the city of Hereford and the parish of Whitbourne, as well as bequests of plate to his grandchildren.<br>
