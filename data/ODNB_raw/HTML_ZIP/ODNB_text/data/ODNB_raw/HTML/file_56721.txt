<span class="headword">Marten,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1692&#150;1737), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, is probably one of the John Martens enrolled in the Company of Barber&#150;Surgeons in 1692. He may have been the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57715/', "Benjamin Marten")</script>. John Marten's first extant work is a translation of and supplement to the <span class="italic">Treatise of the Safe, Internal Use of Cantharides</span> (1706), originally published in Latin by Joannes Groenevelt in 1698. Dedicated to William, earl of Portland, it made the internal use of cantharides (or Spanish fly) developed by Groenevelt (or Greenfield, as he is called in Marten's translation) much better known in England, and it obtained the imprimatur of the president and censors of the Royal College of Physicians of London. As the title page explains, Marten also added &#145;Several further and very remarkable Observations and Histories of the said Doctor, also of the Translator and others&#146; to Groenevelt's work, which are clearly marked but almost doubling the original size of the work. While Marten claims to have received the blessings of Groenevelt for translating and supplementing his book, he was later accused by J. Spinke of having imposed himself.<br>
<br>According to Marten's preface, signed &#145;From my House in Bridg-water-Square, near Aldersgate-Street, London, a Golden Head over the Door&#146;, he had been particularly &#145;conversant&#146; with the cure of &#145;several in the most deplorable Conditions, especially from <i>Venereal Causes</i>&#146; and found that &#145;the use of Cantharides, when all other means failed&#146; had great benefits. He therefore had approached Groenevelt, who agreed to let Marten translate and correct his book. He also thanked &#145;that great and learned Physitian and favourer of Learning, Dr. Edward Tyson&#146;, for suggesting some of the additions. Marten's own commentary grows in size as the original text begins to end. By pages 189&#150;95, Marten re-emphasizes the usefulness of cantharides in treating the clap, and within another fifty pages or so degenerates into telling stories of a lascivious nature. The book ends with an advertisement for the fourth edition of Marten's own book on gonorrhoea.<br>
<br>This latter work, no longer extant in earlier editions, appeared in a sixth edition in 1709  (<span class="italic">Treatise of All the Degrees and Symptoms of the Venereal Disease, in both Sexes</span>), which went through additional editions thereafter. By way of an appendix it contained a &#145;letter&#146; on sexual relations that veered into pornography, intended to be bound with the book but printed on a separate signature so that it could be separated if appearances warranted. The book and its appendix quickly aroused enemies. One of the chief of them, J. Spinke, published an attack on Marten titled <span class="italic">Quackery Unmask'd</span>, in which he accused Marten of the basest dishonesty; among other charges, he printed an affidavit of one &#145;J.C.&#146; stating that a lawyer, Mr. Joshua Stephens, claimed to have been the real translator of the Latin work on cantharides, although Marten came into possession of his sheets. Marten or a friend rose to the defence with an anonymous <span class="italic">An apology for a Latin verse in commendation of Mr. Marten's Gonosologium novum proving that the same liberty of describing the diseases of the secret parts of both sexes, and their cure, (which is said by some to be obscene) has been us'd both by ancient and modern authors</span> (1709). But in the same year Marten was indicted in the queen's bench for &#145;being evil disposed and wickedly intending to corrupt the subjects of the Lady the Queene&#146;. The indictment was eventually dismissed. But Spinke made further attacks on Marten's seventh edition in <span class="italic">A Short Discourse, Preliminary to the Second Edition of Quackery Unmask'd</span> (1711) and <span class="italic">Venus's Botcher, or, The Seventh Edition of Mr. Marten's (Comical) &#145;Treatise of the Venereal Disease&#146;</span> (1711).<br>
<br>After these incidents Marten continued to publish, but on a safer&#151;if also common&#151;chronic disease related in cause, he and other practitioners thought, to venereal disease: the gout. <span class="italic">Attila of the Gout</span> was published in 1713, promising to show the reader that all previous works on the subject had been vanities, while he had developed &#145;an infallible Method to Cure it&#146; in the form of a new specific. The text describes the symptoms, causes, and cures for the gout, and recommends his own specific liquor (the receipt for which is not given), concluding with letters testimonial for his remedy and an account of how previous practitioners accused of quackery had found new and effective cures. He tried to keep his remedies in the public eye with <span class="italic">Dishonour of the Gout</span> in 1721 and <span class="italic">Treatise of the Gout</span>, 4th edition, in 1738. He seems to have died at about the time he completed his last book.<br>
