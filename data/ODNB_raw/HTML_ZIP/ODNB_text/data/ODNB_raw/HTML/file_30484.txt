<span class="headword">Astbury, Sir  John Meir</span>  (1860&#150;1939), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Grove House, Broughton, near Manchester, on 14 June 1860, the eldest son of Frederick James Astbury JP (<i>d</i>. 1901), chartered accountant, of Hilton Park, Prestwich, Lancashire, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1894), daughter of John Munn, of Manchester. He was educated at Manchester grammar school and at Trinity College, Oxford, where he graduated with a second class in jurisprudence in 1882: in the following year he was the only candidate placed in the first class in the BCL examination, and in 1884 he won the Vinerian law scholarship. In 1923 he was elected an honorary fellow of Trinity College.<br>
<br>Astbury was called to the bar in 1884 by the Middle Temple (of which inn he became a bencher in 1903 and treasurer in 1926). He entered practice on the Chancery side as a &#145;local&#146; at the Manchester bar and soon acquired a practice in the palatine chancery court and at the assizes. In May 1888 he married Evelyn (<i>d</i>. 1923), daughter of Paul Susmann, merchant, of Manchester. He took silk in 1895 and migrated to London, attaching himself first to the court of Sir E. W. Byrne and later to that of Sir H. B. Buckley &#145;going special&#146; in 1905, with a large business in patent litigation, which increased greatly after John Fletcher Moulton became a lord justice of appeal in 1906. In that year he stood as Liberal candidate for the Southport division and defeated E. Marshall Hall, but he was not greatly interested in politics and retired from parliament in January 1910. In 1913 Lord Chancellor Haldane offered him the judgeship in the Chancery Division recently vacated by the promotion of Sir Charles Swinfen Eady; he accepted, and was knighted. For the next sixteen years he discharged the duties of this position with efficiency but without distinction: notwithstanding the assumptions of the English legal tradition, good advocates do not always make good judges.<br>
<br>Astbury was best-known to the general public and is remembered by historians for the part which, as judge, he played during the general strike of 1926. The litigation in question is reported as <i>National Sailors' and Firemen's Union of Great Britain and Ireland v. Reed and others</i>. The union, composed of loyal merchant seamen, under the wise direction of its secretary J. Havelock Wilson, had little sympathy with the attempt of the strikers to subvert democratic government, and when certain local branches called upon members to cease work the union immediately applied to the High Court of Justice for an injunction prohibiting its subordinate officials from usurping the functions of the union as a whole. The case was in Astbury's list on 11 May, and he gave his decision at once, not confining himself to the technical point as to the relations between the union and its branches, but declaring in forcible language that the whole general strike was illegal and that the court would use its powers, by injunction, to prevent any action which might further the strike's objective. On the previous night Sir Henry Slesser, at that time a leading lawyer among the Labour members of parliament, had declared in the House of Commons that the question of the legality of the strike was one to be decided by the courts of justice, and that &#145;whatever the decision of this tribunal, we shall all, as law-abiding citizens, obey it&#146;. When the house met on the following evening, Sir John Simon, with a copy of Astbury's judgment, given earlier in the day, in his hand, in a trenchant speech (which complemented one given a week earlier) charged the leaders of the strike as lawbreakers. Although it was on the following morning that Stanley Baldwin made the announcement that the strike had been called off there is no evidence that, as he himself claimed and his <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary asserted, Astbury's judgment (or indeed Sir John Simon's statement) played any significant part in bringing this about. While it spawned a host of approving commentary in contemporary legal journals, including a somewhat ambiguous one by Sir Frederick Pollock in the <span class="italic">Law Quarterly Review</span>, the comprehensive critique by A. L. Goodhart and that of W. S. Holdsworth have never since been challenged. The judgment ignored the jurisprudence of the <span class="roman">Trade Disputes Act</span> of 1906 (which supplied immunity for strikers involved in trade disputes) and, if sound, would have made superfluous the <span class="roman">Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act</span> of 1927 (which made general strikes unlawful).<br>
<br>Following the death of his first wife Astbury married secondly, in August 1923, Harriet, daughter of George William Holmes, of Philadelphia, USA, and widow of Captain Morrell Andrew Girdlestone. In 1929 his eyesight began to fail and in October he resigned his judgeship: in December he was sworn of the privy council. His last years were saddened by his blindness and by the death in a motor accident of his only child, a daughter from his first marriage. He died at the Guildford Hotel, Sandwich, on 21 August 1939. By his will, he directed that the ultimate residue of his estate should be devoted to legal education.<br>
