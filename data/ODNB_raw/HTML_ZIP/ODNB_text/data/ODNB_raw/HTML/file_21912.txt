</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Perceval,  John</span>, second earl of Egmont  (1711&#150;1770), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 24 February 1711 at Westminster, the only surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21911/', "John Perceval, first earl of Egmont (1683&#150;1748)")</script>, politician, and his wife, Catherine (1687/1688&#150;1749), the eldest daughter of Sir Philip Parker, second baronet, of Erwarton, Suffolk, and Mary Forbrey.<h2>
<a name="Earlypoliticalcareer"></a>Early political career</h2>Styled Viscount Perceval from 1733 to 1748, Perceval received a private education in which his father instructed him in history and antiquities. At the age of twenty he was returned for the seat of Dingle in the Irish parliament. In 1734 his father stood down at his parliamentary seat at Harwich in favour of his son, but Perceval was not returned, and both father and son blamed the defeat on Robert Walpole. Feeling slighted by both Walpole and the king, Perceval gave his support to the opposition and the use of his house in Pall Mall to Frederick, prince of Wales. The offer was refused, but the prince later took Perceval as his political adviser. At Kensington, on 15 February 1737, Perceval married Lady Catherine Cecil (1719&#150;1752), the second daughter of James Cecil, fifth earl of Salisbury, and Anne Tufton. They had five sons and two daughters. Perceval tried twice more to gain a seat in the British House of Commons but was unsuccessful. He was then adopted as an opposition candidate for Westminster after &#145;intriguing&#146; against two government candidates, and after the annulment of the election he was returned unopposed on 31 December 1741. His maiden speech in the Commons was in support of a motion to enquire into the conduct of the war, and was directed against Walpole. His pamphlet <span class="italic">Faction Detected by the Evidence of the Facts</span> (1743) earned the disapproval of the opposition and his constituents, resulting in the loss of his seat in 1747. Perceval was adept at making political enemies, for no sooner had he gained a new parliamentary seat at Weobley with the support of Henry Pelham than he went over to the opposition. He had been defeated at the poll but returned by petition, and demonstrated his loyalty to Pelham by calling him a treacherous servant of the king. After joining the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96922', "Leicester House")</script> faction surrounding the prince of Wales, Perceval was made a lord of the bedchamber to the prince. According to Horace Walpole, both the old and new members of the ministry hated Perceval, and the tories could not forgive him for his conduct in the previous parliament. On 1 May 1748 Perceval succeeded his father as second earl of Egmont in the Irish peerage.<h2>
<a name="EgmontandLeicesterHouse17491751"></a>Egmont and Leicester House, 1749&#150;1751</h2>Egmont was now Frederick's chief political adviser, and between them they drew up detailed plans for Frederick's accession to the throne on the eventual death of his father George II. These plans included a distribution of offices and an analysis of the House of Commons to assist in the general election that would come about within six months of a new reign, the fixing of the civil list, matters concerned with foreign policy, and drafts of speeches to parliament. Egmont was now a prominent opposition speaker in the Commons, and his attack on the <span class="roman">Mutiny Bill</span> in 1749 caused Sir Hanbury Williams to pen an epigram in which he cast Egmont as someone who had mutinied for pay and twice deserted.<br>
<br>In 1749 Egmont published two political pamphlets critical of Henry Pelham and his brother the duke of Newcastle, and another concerning the 1743 treaty of Hanau. The following year he is supposed to have written <span class="italic">Constitutional Queries Earnestly Recommended to the Serious Consideration of every True Briton</span>, which was ordered to be burnt by the common hangman in 1751. The death in March 1751 of Frederick left Egmont's political ambitions in disarray. The princess of Wales summoned him and directed him to go to Carlton House to collect the prince's papers. The political papers concerned with the accession were burnt, though Egmont retained copies that have survived. Egmont then held a meeting at his house in Pall Mall of the main opposition members, and resolved to stand by the princess and her children. However, the princess found that it was in her best interest to abandon her husband's friends, and the bulk of the prince's faction dispersed, leaving Egmont in opposition for the remainder of the parliament. To his political misfortunes was added a personal one with the death of his wife on 16 August 1752.<h2>
<a name="AmbitionsforaBritishpeerage17541762"></a>Ambitions for a British peerage, 1754&#150;1762</h2>In the general election of April 1754 Egmont was returned for Bridgwater. The princess now persuaded him to accept office. He was sworn of the privy council on 9 January 1755, but refused to serve with Henry Fox, now leader of the house. He was also supplanted at Leicester House by Lord Bute. On 26 January 1756 he married Catherine (1731&#150;1784), the third daughter of the Hon. Charles Compton and Mary Berkeley. They had three sons and six daughters. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21916/', "Spencer Perceval (1762&#150;1812)")</script>, his second son by this marriage, became prime minister in 1809 and was assassinated in 1812. In October 1756 the duke of Newcastle offered to make Egmont a secretary of state and leader of the House of Commons, but Egmont refused unless he was also made an English peer. This did not suit Newcastle, as he needed Egmont in the Commons. Egmont again refused office in May 1757. About this time, James Waldegrave, second Earl Waldegrave, described Egmont as a good speaker in parliament who was not easily intimidated and whose only amusements were business and politics, yet &#145;he respected himself rather more than the world respected him&#146;  (Namier, 3.267). Egmont continued in opposition during the remainder of the reign but was not politically active, even though he consistently opposed William Pitt, whom he detested.<br>
<br>The accession of George III in 1760 raised Egmont's hopes that his political fortunes might change. Returned once more for Bridgwater in March 1761, he became associated with Lord Bute. He had asked Bute the year before if he could be of service to the king, hoping that he would be made a British peer. This ambition was achieved on 7 May 1762 when he was created Baron Lovel and Holland of Enmore, Somerset. Three days later he took his seat in the House of Lords, and on 27 November 1762 he was made joint postmaster-general. A less controversial figure than in former times, Egmont now settled down to the work of government. He became associated with a political grouping that came to include Bute and Charles Jenkinson and was attached solely to the crown rather than to any political faction.<h2>
<a name="FirstlordoftheAdmiralty17631766"></a>First lord of the Admiralty, 1763&#150;1766</h2>Egmont's capacity for business was finally realized when, on 10 September 1763, he was appointed to succeed the earl of Sandwich as first lord of the Admiralty, in George Grenville's ministry. First, however, he was able to make use of his position to provide for his numerous family. His third son, Philip, an officer in the navy, was appointed to the command of the <i>Ramilles</i>. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64131/', "Charles Perceval")</script> and Spencer, sons from his second marriage, were made registrars of the Admiralty through reversionary grants by letters patent. But his achievement at the Admiralty has been unrecognized, largely as a result of Horace Walpole's unflattering portrayal of him as a wasteful eccentric who left the navy in a wretched condition, throwing away between &pound;400,000 and &pound;500,000 &#145;on pompous additions to the dockyards&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; George III</span>, 4.136&#150;7).<br>
<br>Egmont's delight in antiquities and his eccentric taste as well as a number of unusual schemes served to make contemporary observers such as Walpole portray him as a figure of ridicule. Egmont had produced two volumes of the <span class="italic">Genealogical History of the House of Yvery</span> in 1742, giving a fanciful account of the origins of his own family. His house at Enmore, near Bridgwater in Somerset, was rebuilt as a moated castle. His most unusual scheme, however, was to submit a memorial to the king in December 1763 asking for a grant of the island of St John in the Gulf of St Lawrence, to be settled on a feudal basis. He estimated that 800,000 acres could be held by military tenure and that, if the system should be extended to the newly acquired lands in Canada, a feudal levy of 724,000 men could be raised for the defence of America. In this venture he gained support from respected naval officers such as Keppel and Saunders, but after strenuous objections from General Conway the scheme was set aside.<br>
<br>There was nothing fanciful about Egmont's management of the navy between 1763 and 1766. By his predecessor's estimate, it would take over five years and more than &pound;3 million to put the navy on a respectable footing after the hardships of the late war. The Admiralty's task was complicated by reduced parliamentary supplies, a navy debt of over &pound;4&frac12; million, and a programme of retrenchment. Egmont made a visit to the dockyards in the spring of 1764, the first such visitation since that of Sandwich and Anson in 1749. He noted a number of inadequacies in the infrastructure and organization of the yards, and he ordered that repair priorities be rearranged so that ships could be brought forward more quickly. All new ships were to be built on slips to free the docks to undertake repairs, and he requested detailed information on the regulation and economy of the yards. Turning his attention to the shipwrights and artificers in the yards, Egmont called for reports on the numbers and occupations of dockyard workers, the condition of the ships, and the length of time and number of men required to undertake specific tasks. He then made a number of productivity calculations. He increased the number of shipwrights by 400 and introduced a scheme of superannuation for deserving elderly shipwrights which allowed their places to be taken by able-bodied and more productive workers. By his efforts the dockyards were made more efficient and productive. It was also during Egmont's period at the Admiralty that Byron was sent on his voyage of discovery to the Pacific, and that a settlement was made in the Falkland Islands, named Port Egmont in honour of the first lord.<br>
<br>In 1765 Egmont's need for further naval expenditure was resisted by George Grenville, first lord of the Treasury and prime minister. Grenville had brought the navy's debt down to manageable proportions and was anxious that an increase in naval appropriation would cause alarm both at home and abroad. Egmont was particularly concerned that the Treasury had reduced the naval estimates and that money needed urgently for the expansion of the dockyards at Portsmouth and Plymouth had been cut entirely. He consulted in secret with the Navy Board, which produced detailed plans of expenditure that Egmont submitted to the king through the earl of Halifax on 30 May, along with accounts of the French and Spanish fleets. The Treasury, on learning of these accounts, attempted to undermine Egmont by dealing directly with the Navy Board on matters of expenditure. Egmont had already removed Grenville's power to cut appropriation for dockyard expansion by obtaining a privy council order directing a sum for this work to be included annually in the estimates. The Treasury's response was to interfere in the affairs of the Navy Board, and this was an affront to Egmont's authority. Grenville was already on bad terms with the king, and further aggravation was avoided by the dismissal of Grenville and his ministry.<br>
<br>Egmont had usually remained silent in Grenville's cabinet, but he emerged from the collapse of the ministry as the king's man. In much the same way that he had advised Prince Frederick in the composition of a new government, Egmont, along with the duke of Cumberland, the king's uncle, now assisted George III in the construction of a new administration to be led by the marquess of Rockingham. Egmont remained in the new ministry as first lord of the Admiralty. He was free from Treasury interference and by September 1765 could report that the fleet would muster sixty-two ships of the line of sixty guns or more, all in good condition, with a further twenty fit for service by the end of 1769. This achievement was in large measure due to Egmont's competent management of the navy's affairs.<br>
<br>The Rockingham administration collapsed in 1766 and a new ministry was formed under William Pitt, now ennobled as earl of Chatham. Despite his antipathy to Pitt, Egmont, with the support of the king, remained at the head of the Admiralty. However, he soon resigned (on 12 August), since he found Pitt's overbearing nature too much to tolerate. He explained to the king that he disapproved of Chatham's foreign policy, and feared that he would embarrass his majesty's affairs if they were debated in council: &#145;He could submit to the majority; but as he found one man was to have more weight than six, he begged to be unemployed&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; George III</span>, 2.155).<h2>
<a name="Deathandcharacter"></a>Death and character</h2>Egmont played no further part in government or politics. He had a clear aptitude for public business, though his political judgement did not always work to his advantage. His parliamentary notes, written in neat columns with tiny characters, display a methodical and highly organized mind. Dr Johnson wrote of him that he was &#145;a man whose mind was vigourous and active, whose knowledge was extensive and whose designs were magnificent, but who had somewhat vitiated his judgement by too much indulgence in romantic projects and speculations&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 5.30). Horace Walpole has left an illustration of Egmont's personality:<blockquote>His heart rather wanted improvement than his head, though when his ambition and lust of Parliament were out of the question, he was humane, friendly and as good humoured as it is possible for a man to be who was never known to laugh; he was once indeed seen to smile, and that was at chess. He did not dislike mirth in others but he seemed to adjourn his attention till he could bring back the company to seriousness. (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; George II</span>, 1.23)</blockquote>Egmont died at his home in Pall Mall, London, on 4 December 1770 and was buried on the 11th at Charlton in Kent. He was survived by his wife, who had been created on 23 May 1770 Baroness Arden of Lohort Castle, and died at Langley, Buckinghamshire, on 11 June 1784.<br>
