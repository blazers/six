<span class="headword">Titcomb,  Jonathan Holt</span>  (1819&#150;1887), <span class="occ">first bishop of Rangoon</span>, was born, with a twin sister, in Kensington, London, on 29 July 1819, the son of Jonathan Holt Titcomb (<i>d</i>. 1851) of Fulham. He was educated in London at Clapham and at King's College School and, after a lacklustre university career, graduated BA (junior optime) from Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1841. In the spring of 1842 he was engaged by Lady Harriet Forde of Hollymount, near Downpatrick in co. Down, as tutor to her nephew, and in the following September was ordained deacon and appointed curate on the estate. Initially he was a high-churchman, but his ministry among the estate workers converted him to evangelicalism and awakened an interest in missionary endeavour. In September 1843 he was ordained priest and in April 1845, after several months as curate at St Mark's, Kennington, London, he accepted the living of St Andrew-the-Less at Barnwell near Cambridge. He took to it his new wife, Sarah (1824&#150;1876), eldest daughter of John Wood of Southport, Lancashire, whom he married on 24 May 1845 and with whom he was to have eight daughters and two sons; the couple's eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101131/', "William Holt Yates Titcomb")</script>, became a noted artist closely associated with St Ives, Cornwall.<br>
<br>Barnwell offered considerable scope for an evangelical preacher. Contemporaries described it as a sinkhole of moral impurity brought about by a massive population increase&#151;from 400 in 1820 to 7000 in 1841. Titcomb initially concentrated on drawing new people into the church with lecture programmes and Sunday schools; but in 1850, fretting about the thousands of people beyond the church's reach, he braved unfavourable comparison with nonconformists by plunging into open-air preaching. He defended the practice in letters to the <span class="italic">Christian Guardian</span> and with growing confidence had made for himself a folding iron pulpit so that he could preach outdoors in style. While at Barnwell he also published the first of several works designed to minimize the effects of doctrinal controversy on churchgoers and broaden evangelicalism's outlook, including <span class="italic">Heads of Prayer for Daily Private Devotion</span> (2nd edn, 1850), and <span class="italic">Bible Studies, or, An Inquiry into the Progressive Development of Divine Revelation</span> (1851). Later publications included <span class="italic">Baptism: its Institution, its Privileges, and its Responsibilities</span> (1866); <span class="italic">Cautions for Doubters</span> (1873); and <span class="italic">Before the Cross: a Book of Devout Meditation</span> (1878).<br>
<br>In June 1859 Titcomb became secretary of the Christian Vernacular Education Society, but he missed direct pastoral work and in April 1861 he accepted the living of the new church of St Stephen's, South Lambeth, London&#151;then in the Winchester diocese. He successfully built up a new congregation while maintaining a busy schedule of London speaking engagements and commitments to the Religious Tract Society and the <span class="italic">True Catholic</span>, which he edited for two years. From 1870 to 1876 he was additionally rural dean of Clapham, London, and in 1874 was made an honorary canon of Winchester Cathedral. The years at South Lambeth were marked by personal sadness: the deaths of two daughters; of his beloved twin sister; and finally, in January 1876, of Sarah, &#145;one of the wisest and best of wives&#146;  (Edwards, 16).<br>
<br>Titcomb struggled to see the wisdom of God in his losses and in March 1876 he was grateful to move on to the living of Woking, Surrey, offered to him by the earl of Onslow. The challenge of a new parish revitalized him and in 1877 he accepted the bishopric of Rangoon, in Burma, a new post funded largely by the Winchester diocese. He arrived in Rangoon with three of his daughters in February 1878 and embarked enthusiastically on strengthening the Burmese church and raising funds to remedy its deficiencies in chaplains and buildings. Among other activities, he held a confirmation in the Andaman Islands, consecrated a missionary church at Toungoo, ordained as deacons several Tamil and Karen Christians, and baptized numerous converts from among Rangoon's indigenous, Indian, and Chinese populations. In July 1879, however, illness again struck his family with the death of his eldest daughter, and another fell so seriously ill that Titcomb had to return with her to England to await her death. During this unhappy vigil he wrote a slim volume entitled <span class="italic">Personal Recollections of British Burma and its Church Mission Work</span> (1880). He returned to Burma in late 1880 but in February 1881 fell over a cliff in the Karen hills and was eventually forced back to England, where he resigned the bishopric in March 1882.<br>
<br>Titcomb did not expect to work heavily again but in January 1884 the bishop of London appointed him his coadjutor for supervising the English church in northern and central Europe, a job hardly less physically challenging than his previous one and which committed him to extensive visitation tours to France, Germany, Scandinavia, Poland, Russia, and numerous countries in between. In 1886, very nearly worn out, he took up the perpetual curacy of St Peter's, Brockley, in Kent. He died at 28 Marina Street, St Leonards, Sussex, on 2 April 1887 and was buried in Brompton cemetery, London, on 7 April. His two sons and four of his daughters survived him.<br>
