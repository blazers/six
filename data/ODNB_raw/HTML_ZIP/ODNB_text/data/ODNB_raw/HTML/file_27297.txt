<span class="headword">Thomson,  David</span>  (1817&#150;1880), <span class="occ">physicist and university teacher</span>, was born on 17 November 1817 in the Italian city state of Leghorn, the eldest son of David Thomson, a Scottish merchant based in that city. Thomson received a multilingual education and attended a M. Godin's boarding-school at Lausanne, Switzerland, from the age of eleven. At the age of fifteen he entered the University of Glasgow, where he was a student of James Thomson (1786&#150;1849), the professor of mathematics, and after four years there he continued his mathematical studies at Trinity College, Cambridge. He was considered a promising mathematician but, according to his biographer, his health prevented him from becoming a candidate for wrangler status. In the context of the strenuous preparation required for the higher divisions of the tripos, this was not an unusual decision even for promising students, and it does not imply that he was in particularly bad health. After graduating Cambridge in the <i>ordo senioritatis</i> he became private tutor to a family of the Irish aristocracy for a brief period. In 1840 he returned to Glasgow University as assistant to the professor of natural philosophy, William Meikleham; one of his students there was William Thomson, later Lord Kelvin, the son of his former professor.<br>
<br>On 14 September 1843 Thomson married Helen Stuart; they had nine children. His career took off in earnest in 1845, when he was appointed professor of natural philosophy at King's College, Aberdeen, where he also occupied a series of senior administrative positions. A rigorous teacher, tenacious and aggressive administrator, and strict disciplinarian, his activities were central to the reform and restructuring of the University of Aberdeen in the middle years of the nineteenth century. His manner was revealed early in his tenure. In dispute with his class over the conduct of examinations after his first session as professor, he suspended their April bursaries until the following October. His teaching was largely mathematical, experiments generally being used for illustration only. Much given to the public humiliation of students who attended lectures without adequate preparation, his oral examinations were known as &#145;the pillory&#146;. There is no evidence that he engaged in research or encouraged it in others. His only publication in his field is the article on acoustics in the ninth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> (1875). This article is strongly pedagogical in tone, combining a graduated introduction to the relevant mathematics with many interesting practical examples. It is, however, weak on physical theory.<br>
<br>Thomson's administrative energies were directed to establishing the superiority of King's, a pre-Reformation foundation situated in the Old Town, over Marischal's College (founded 1593), which was situated in the New Town. The latter had gained the lead in the sciences and in professional education in the course of the eighteenth century, and was strongly identified with the values of the Scottish Enlightenment. It also had the affections of the local citizenry. Thomson's particular involvement in the cause of King's came during the debates over the union of the colleges into one university. It was common ground that the faculties of law and medicine would remain at Marischal's, and the faculty of divinity at King's, but the fate of the faculty of arts, the centre of the traditional university, was in dispute. Thomson was instrumental in maintaining and pushing through the proposition that there could only be one faculty of arts, and that it would be situated at King's. His leading opponent in academic circles was the psychologist Alexander Bain, a Benthamite active in <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span> circles; and he also faced vigorous opposition from local people. Lay government of universities was well established in Scottish academic culture, and Thomson gained considerable notoriety when he questioned the credentials of his auditors at a public meeting set up by the town council. He was, however, successful and the union of the colleges was passed by parliament along the lines of his plan in 1860. As a result of this success, his opposite number at Marischal's, James Clerk Maxwell, left Aberdeen to take up a position in London.<br>
<br>Thomson continued as the leading teacher of physical sciences at the unified University of Aberdeen until the Michaelmas term of 1879, with only occasional absences due to illness. He died at the university in the Old Town on 31 January 1880, shortly after suffering a stroke. His wife survived him.<br>
