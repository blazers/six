<span class="headword">Gee,  Joshua</span>  (1667&#150;1730), <span class="occ">writer on trade and merchant</span>, was the son of John Gee (1635&#150;1704) of Moyvoughley, co. Westmeath. His father was a Quaker, originally from Yorkshire. Nothing is known of Joshua Gee's education. By 1694 Gee was in London, where he became a master of the Grocers' Company by purchase (therefore not having served an apprenticeship) and hence a freeman of the City of London. That same year he married Sarah Hart (1673/4&#150;1704), daughter of a tailor, at the Peel Quaker meeting. They had five children, William (<i>b</i>. and <i>d</i>. 1696), Joshua (1697&#150;1777), John (1699&#150;1719?), Mary (1701&#150;1702), and Sarah (1703&#150;1740). Following his first wife's death, in 1706 he married Anna Osgood (<i>d</i>. 1730), widow of Salem Osgood and daughter-in-law of John Osgood, a Quaker silk and linen merchant. It is possible that it was this marriage which enabled Gee to buy Fenton House, Hampstead, Middlesex, in 1707. Anna was already the mother of two daughters, Rebecca (1695&#150;1783) and Anne (<i>b</i>. 1699); she and Gee had four children, Samuel (1707&#150;1746), Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1708), Osgood (<i>b</i>. 1710), and Mary (<i>b</i>. 1713).<br>
<br>Gee seems to have shared the business interests of the Osgoods, as he was identified as a silkman when he acted as one of the mortgagees of William Penn's proprietary rights in Pennsylvania in 1708. He was also an adviser to the Board of Trade and Plantations. His interests in the American colonies included iron ore. He was the leading force in a partnership that by 1723 owned or controlled more than 12,000 acres in North America that contained or were hoped to contain iron ore deposits; by 1726 his partners included Augustine Washington, father of the first president of the United States, George Washington. He published the work that made him famous, <span class="italic">The Trade and Navigation of Great Britain Consider'd</span>, in London in 1729. It went through many editions (4th edn, 1738) and was frequently reprinted during the eighteenth century, notably by Robert and Andrew Foulis of Glasgow in 1755 and in a French translation in 1750. Gee's most famous work presented its overview of British trade both historically and by national areas, and commented on specific problems of trade (for example devoting chapter 12 to &#145;French <i>fashions pernicious</i> to England)&#146;. However, the greater part of the work was concerned with suggesting remedies: in particular solving the colonial labour problem by transporting domestic convicts and the unemployed poor and the creation of free ports at Gibraltar and Port Mahon; and, more generally, the encouragement of foreign import-replacing production in the plantations.<br>
<br>Gee died at the baths in Hampstead in 1730. He has, possibly wrongly, been identified as the author of two further works, both related to the woollen trade, namely, <span class="italic">An Impartial Enquiry into the Importance and Present State of the Woollen Manufactures of Great Britain</span> and <span class="italic">The Grazier's Advocate, or, Free Thoughts of Wool and the Woollen Trade</span>. Both were published in 1742, twelve years after his death.<br>
<br>Gee is widely thought to have been, in 1713&#150;14, an important contributor to the twice-weekly issues of the <span class="italic">British Merchant</span>, and a collaborator with Henry Martin in arguing the protectionist case against the treaty of commerce with France proposed at Utrecht. The <span class="italic">British Merchant</span> was set up in opposition to the <span class="italic">Mercator, or, Commerce Retrieved</span>, which defended the idea of such a treaty. Gee has been described as a &#145;staunch protectionist&#146;  (Johnson, 145) and (assuming the 1742 works were his) as &#145;the spokesman for the wool manufacturers as well as a merchant enemy of the India Company&#146;  (ibid., 348). David Hume later wrote:<blockquote>The writings of Mr. Gee struck the nation with an universal panic, when they saw it plainly demonstrated, by a detail of particulars, that the balance was against them for so considerable a sum as must leave them without a single shilling in five or six years. But luckily, twenty years have since elapsed, with an expensive foreign war [1739&#150;48]; yet it is commonly supposed, that money is still more plentiful among us than in any former period. (Hume, 61&#150;2)</blockquote>In his <span class="italic">Lectures on Jurisprudence</span> Adam Smith cited Hume's opinion approvingly, but in addition poked considerable fun at Gee's balance of trade data showing all the nations of Europe as having a favourable balance with Britain, with the exceptions of Spain, Portugal, and Ireland, as well as the American (but not West Indian) plantations. Gee's works contained much of the protectionist content with which they were charged.<br>
