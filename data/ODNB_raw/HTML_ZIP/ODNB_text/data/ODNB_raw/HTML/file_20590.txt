<span class="headword">Ogilvy,  Alexander, of Inverquharity</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1446), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was the eldest son of John Ogilvy of Inverquharity, son of Sir Walter Ogilvy of Auchterhouse (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1368&#150;1392), hereditary sheriff of Forfar. It was in this part of north-east Scotland that lands, office, and family connections made the Ogilvys influential. Ogilvy's uncle Sir Walter Ogilvy of Lintrathen served James I as master of the king's household and treasurer, and his cousin Marjory, daughter of Alexander Ogilvy of Auchterhouse, sheriff of Forfar, married David Lindsay, third earl of Crawford. Ogilvy's son, another Alexander, served as a hostage for the ransom of James I from 1427 until 1432, when he is described as the son of the sheriff of Forfar.<br>
<br>On 28 May 1442 Ogilvy was himself present at the sheriff court held at Inverbervie in the sheriffdom of Kincardine, and on 1 August that year he witnessed an agreement between two powerful north-east magnates, Alexander Seton, Lord Gordon, and Robert, Lord Keith, the marischal, at Cluny, in the sheriffdom of Aberdeen. Ogilvy's only recorded appearance as a witness to a royal charter was on 7 September 1444, when he was with the king at Dalkeith, but it is clear from the exchequer accounts for 1445 that he held the offices of bailie of Panmure and keeper of Methven Castle, further evidence of the importance of the extended Ogilvy family as royal agents in the Forfar region.<br>
<br>In 1445, according to the Auchinleck chronicle, the Ogilvys took part in a raid mounted against the Fife possessions of James Kennedy, bishop of St Andrews, for which Kennedy excommunicated the perpetrators. The chronicler ties this in with a dispute which arose in the following year concerning Ogilvy's designs upon the justiciarship of the abbey of Arbroath, contested between himself and Alexander Lindsay, master of Crawford. The abbey deposed Lindsay in favour of Ogilvy, but the former was unwilling to relinquish his position without a fight. Battle was joined at Arbroath, the Auchinleck chronicle reports, late on Sunday 23 January 1446, and resulted in the death of David, third earl of Crawford, who had tried to mediate. Ogilvy, severely wounded, was said by one chronicle source (probably following a local tradition in Angus) to have been taken to Crawford's castle of Finavon, where Ogilvy's cousin Marjory, distraught at hearing of the death of her husband, smothered him to death.<br>
