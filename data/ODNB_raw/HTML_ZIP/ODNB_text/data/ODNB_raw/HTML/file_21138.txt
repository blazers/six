<span class="headword">Pakenham, Sir  Edward Michael</span>  (1778&#150;1815), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, second son of Edward Michael Pakenham, second Baron Longford (1743&#150;1792), and his wife, Catherine (1748&#150;1816), second daughter of Hercules Longford Rowley, was born at Longford Castle, co. Westmeath, on 19 April 1778. His younger brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21139/', "Sir Hercules Robert Pakenham (1781&#150;1850)")</script>. After a perfunctory education he became, on 28 May 1794, aged sixteen, lieutenant in the 92nd foot (an Irish unit afterwards drafted); a few days later he was made captain, and on 6 December, though still not seventeen, he became major in the 33rd or Ulster light dragoons.<br>
<br>On 1 June 1798 Pakenham became major in the old 23rd light dragoons (disbanded in 1802), with which he served in Ireland during the uprising; and on 17 October 1799 he was appointed lieutenant-colonel, 64th foot, which he commanded at the capture of the Danish and Swedish West India islands in 1801. Socially Pakenham appears to have been a general favourite. The inhabitants of St Croix, one of the captured islands, presented some silver cups in token of their esteem for him and his officers. He commanded the 64th at the capture of St Lucia on 22 June 1803, when he was wounded. In 1805, after returning home, he became a brevet colonel. He was then appointed to a lieutenant-colonelcy in the 7th Royal Fusiliers, whose 1st battalion he joined at Weymouth in 1806, and commanded at Copenhagen in 1807 and at the capture of Martinique in 1809; afterwards he returned with the battalion to Nova Scotia. Pakenham joined Wellington, who in 1806 had married his sister Catherine (Kitty), in the Peninsula after the battle of Talavera (27&#150;8 July 1809). He liked, admired, and worked well with Wellington. He was employed as an assistant adjutant-general to the fusiliers; the officers of the battalion placed his portrait in the mess, and presented him with a sword valued at 200 guineas. He was appointed deputy adjutant-general in the Peninsula on 7 March 1810; no desk soldier, he disliked what he called &#145;this insignificant clerking business&#146;  (Ward, 59).<br>
<br>Pakenham commanded a brigade of the two battalions 7th fusiliers and the Cameron Highlanders, in Sir Brent Spencer's division at Busaco and Fuentes d'O&ntilde;oro in 1810, and in 1811 he received the local rank of major-general in the Peninsula, and served with the headquarters staff. At the battle of Salamanca, on 22 July 1812, described by Wellington as the best manoeuvred battle in the whole war, Pakenham commanded the 3rd division, which broke the French centre. The two armies faced each other, and had been moving on parallel lines for three days. They saw each other clearly, from opposite rising grounds, as the valley between was not more than half a mile wide. Marmont's design was to interpose between Wellington and Badajoz; Wellington's object was to prevent this. In their eagerness to gain their point the French leading divisions outmarched those following, and thus left a vacant space in the centre, which Wellington saw, and at once exploited. &#145;Now's your time, Ned&#146;, he said to Pakenham, who was standing near him; Pakenham gave the order to his division, and began the movement which won the battle. Wellington wrote to the Horse Guards on 7 September 1812:<blockquote>I put Pakenham to the third division, by General Picton's desire when he was ill; and I am very glad I did so, as I must say he made the movement which led to our success in the battle of 22 July last with a celerity and accuracy of which I doubt if there are very many capable, and without both it would not have answered its end. Pakenham may not be the brightest genius, but my partiality for him does not lead me astray when I tell you that he is one of the best we have. (<span class="italic">Dispatches</span>, 6.434)</blockquote>Pakenham commanded the division at the capture of Madrid. He became major-general on 4 June 1812, and was appointed adjutant-general on 10 May 1813. He commanded the 6th division at Sauroren (battle of the Pyrenees), was made KB on 11 September 1813, was appointed colonel of the 6th West India regiment the same year, and was present as adjutant-general in the succeeding campaigns. He received the gold cross and clasps for Martinique, Busaco, Fuentes d'O&ntilde;oro, Salamanca, Pyrenees, Nivelle, Nive, Orthez, and Toulouse. On the reconstitution of the Order of the Bath (4 January 1815), he was made GCB. Agreeable and widely liked, he was called by Sir George Napier, &#145;that most delightful of all characters&#146;  (Longford, 357). In 1812 he had proposed to Annabella Milbanke but she rejected him, alleging &#145;all the Pakenham family have a strong tendency to insanity&#146;  (ibid., 117). Instead she married Byron.<br>
<br>Pakenham did not want to fight in the Anglo-American War, but the death of General Ross (of Bladensburg) before Washington (in 1814) led to his selection to command the British force that had operated on the Chesapeake, and which was to be used against New Orleans. Pakenham ought to have joined it in Jamaica, but adverse winds detained him, and he did not reach his command until after a landing had been made at New Orleans, and an action had taken place, in which each side had lost more than 200 men. He found the army on a narrow neck of land flanked on one side by the Mississippi River and on the other by impassable swamp, and unwisely he accepted this unfavourable position. Though brave, he failed in independent command. Against him was one of the ablest United States generals&#151;Andrew Jackson.<br>
<br>After a costly reconnaissance Pakenham erected bastions of hogsheads of sugar, and mounted on them thirty guns; but on 1 January 1815 these were destroyed by American fire. In the following week both sides were reinforced. It is just possible that, if Pakenham had been patient enough to wait the development of his plans, he might have carried the American lines and entered New Orleans. He intended to attack on both sides of the river before dawn on 8 January 1815, but there was delay in crossing, and he sent up the signal rocket before his men on the west side of the river were ready. He was killed, shot through the spine, in the unsuccessful assault that followed. Also killed was his second in command, Sir Samuel Gibbs. Over 3000 officers and men were killed or wounded. Pakenham's body was brought back to Ireland and buried there.<br>
