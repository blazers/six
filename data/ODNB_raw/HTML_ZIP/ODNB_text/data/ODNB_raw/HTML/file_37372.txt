<span class="headword">Drummond,  Dugald</span>  (1840&#150;1912), <span class="occ">railway engineer</span>, was born on 1 January 1840 in Ardrossan, Ayrshire, the son of George Drummond, a permanent-way inspector on the Bowling to Balloch railway, and his wife, Christina Thomson. He had at least one brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37373/', "Peter Drummond")</script>. In 1856 he commenced an engineering apprenticeship with Forrest and Barr of Glasgow. After gaining experience with his father's railway and with Peto, Brassey, and Betts at Birkenhead, he worked under Samuel Waite Johnson at the Cowlairs (Glasgow) works of the Edinburgh and Glasgow (later North British) Railway. In 1865 he became foreman erector at the Inverness workshops of the Highland Railway, under William Stroudley, and works manager in the following year. In 1870 he followed Stroudley, with whom he had developed a close friendship, when the latter moved to the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway as locomotive and carriage superintendent, and Drummond became locomotive and carriage works manager of that railway.<br>
<br>In 1875 Drummond was appointed locomotive superintendent of the North British Railway, where he found the locomotive stock and workshops somewhat run down. He rapidly took steps to improve and re-equip the Cowlairs workshops and to introduce new passenger and freight locomotives of improved performance, initially closely following Stroudley's designs. He then introduced a new type of 4&#150;4&#150;0 express locomotive, with a leading bogie which gave a much smoother and safer ride over curved track at speed, and these ran for fifty years from their entry into service in 1876. This type of locomotive was repeated by him after he transferred to the Caledonian Railway in 1882 and was further developed by his successors on that railway for the next thirty years. Some of these locomotives took part in the railway &#145;race&#146; from London to Aberdeen in 1895, when there was keen competition between the west and east coast routes for Anglo-Scottish passenger traffic, and averaged well over 60 m.p.h. from Carlisle to Aberdeen on severe gradients. Drummond also carried out extensive tests to improve the efficiency of his locomotives.<br>
<br>In 1890 Drummond resigned from the Caledonian Railway to establish an engineering works in Queensland, Australia. This project was abortive and he returned to form the Glasgow railway engineering works, where industrial locomotives were built. In 1895 he was appointed to succeed William Adams as locomotive superintendent of the London and South Western Railway, where he had new and well-equipped locomotive workshops built in Eastleigh to replace the existing inadequate facilities in Nine Elms in London. He introduced new main-line and suburban passenger and freight locomotives developed from those he had designed in Scotland, which gave excellent results and had similarly elegant outlines, although his later and more powerful 4&#150;6&#150;0 type locomotives were less successful. He was a highly innovative engineer, introducing developments in boiler design and the use of locomotive exhaust steam for pre-heating the feed water.<br>
<br>Drummond was a forceful personality and could be dour and difficult, although fair in dealings with his men, who appreciated his locomotives and respected him personally. He was a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, becoming a Telford medallist of the former for his outstanding paper in 1897 on locomotive efficiency trials on the Caledonian Railway. He was married and had one son and four daughters. Drummond died at his home, Morves, South Bank, Surbiton, Surrey, on 7 November 1912, while still in office.<br>
