<span class="headword">Fraser,  John</span>  (1794&#150;1879), <span class="occ">Chartist and publisher</span>, was born in Johnstone, Renfrewshire, the younger of two sons of Thomas Fraser and Isabella McIntosh, both of whom came originally from Inverness-shire. His father, who had been pressed into the navy and had been a prisoner for a time during the American War of Independence, acquired some medical knowledge and started business as a druggist in Johnstone. John briefly attended Paisley grammar school but some accident prevented his continuing and he completed his education at Cameron Green's school in Johnstone. Leaving school at the age of nine he went to work in a cotton mill for three years before taking up an apprenticeship as a handloom weaver. On finishing his apprenticeship he then worked for various employers in Johnstone. It was from one of these, Robert Henry, that he caught an enthusiasm for the temperance movement and, in time, became a committed total abstainer.<br>
<br>Fraser was again struck by an unidentified illness and did not work for nearly two years. On his recovery he was able to get a job as a teacher in Kilmacolm and there, in 1814, he married Marjorie Roy (<i>d</i>. 1869). He also came under the influence of an independent, radical preacher, Niel Douglas, who believed in universal atonement, and Fraser remained a believer. His brother, Thomas, opened a school in Kilbarchan and John became his assistant before opening his own school in Johnstone.<br>
<br>Although he does not seem to have taken any active part in the radical uprising in the west of Scotland in April 1820, Fraser was arrested and held for four months after receiving a letter from one of the fugitive rebels. In the 1820s he founded the Mechanics' Institute in Johnstone and contributed some articles on political reform to the <span class="italic">Glasgow Free Press</span>. He chaired Johnstone's Working Men's Radical Association in the early 1830s and also became an enthusiast for James Morison's &#145;hygeist&#146; universal pills. In 1836 he moved to Edinburgh as a bookseller and newsagent and took part in the formation of the Edinburgh Abstinence Society in September 1836. In July 1838 he launched the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Monthly Democrat and Total Abstinence Advocate</span>, a twopenny unstamped paper, to report on Chartist and temperance activity. He and his associate, Abram Duncan, travelled around Scotland giving lectures on Chartism and preparing for the launch of a weekly paper, the first number of which appeared on 20 October 1838. The title, the <span class="italic">True Scotsman</span>, was aimed directly at the whig <span class="italic">Scotsman</span> newspaper which had been deriding the intellectual ability of Edinburgh Chartists. It was for &#145;sober, industrious tradesmen&#146; and its tone remained one of trying to bring moral improvement to the working classes.<br>
<br>Anxious to maintain links between Chartism and the temperance movement, Fraser was critical of any language threatening violent action. On 4&#150;5 December 1838 he organized a conference of some Scottish Chartist delegates and, at a rally on Edinburgh's Calton Hill, resolutions were passed condemning violent language and proposing that there should be no collaboration with those who advocated physical force. He was accused of betraying and dividing the movement. The Chartist Association in Edinburgh split and Glasgow Chartists produced a rival paper clearly intended to compete with the <span class="italic">True Scotsman</span>. In May 1839 he was at the forefront of a committee which nominated W. Sharman Crawford against T. B. Macaulay for a vacant Edinburgh parliamentary seat.<br>
<br>At its peak the <span class="italic">True Scotsman</span> had a circulation of some 3000, but it declined to fewer than 500 copies a week by the time the last number appeared on 27 March 1841. Its pages were regularly filled with denunciation of even the slightest hint that force might be necessary and with bitter invective against its Glasgow rival. Fraser believed that a union between middle class and working class was essential to restrain the latter from violence and insurrection, but he had no sympathy with the Anti-Corn Law League, believing that farmers needed protection. As a result he still had loyal followers in the borders, and in the July 1841 general election he came forward as Chartist candidate for Roxburghshire, although he did not go to the poll.<br>
<br>By this time Fraser had two grown-up sons and four daughters. Two daughters, Jane and Margaret, were singers. They had been entertaining temperance meetings, and in August 1841 Fraser took them on a very successful concert tour of the borders, accompanying them on the piano, doing readings, and providing historical information on the background to the mainly Scottish songs. Even more successful tours of the north of England followed in 1841 and 1842, and in October 1843 they embarked on a seven-month concert tour of London and the south-east. The tours were clearly lucrative, for in 1847 Fraser was able to purchase Newfield House, Kilbarchan, Renfrewshire, and to lease a farm nearby, where he encouraged experiments in high farming. A first tour of the United States was made at the end of 1851, but Jane was taken ill there, and after a long illness, she died in 1853. Fraser returned to Scotland and, having given up his farm, briefly resumed teaching at Newfield. He continued to interest himself in local political issues, opposing the moves to make Johnstone an independent burgh and campaigning against compulsory vaccination. His wife died in November 1869 and he himself died from liver failure at Newfield House on 3 March 1879, aged eighty-four. He was buried in the churchyard of the Relief Church in Kilbarchan.<br>
