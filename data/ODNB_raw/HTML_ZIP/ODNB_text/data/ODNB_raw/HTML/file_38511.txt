<span class="headword">Ashton,  Margaret</span>  (1856&#150;1937), <span class="occ">local politician and philanthropist</span>, was born on 19 January 1856 at Ashfield, Wilmslow Road, in Withington, Manchester, the third of the six daughters and three sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50518/', "Thomas Ashton (1818&#150;1898)")</script>, a wealthy cotton manufacturer, and his wife, Elizabeth (1831&#150;1914), daughter of Samuel Stillman Gair of Rhode Island, USA, and Liverpool. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30473/', "Thomas Gair Ashton, first Baron Ashton of Hyde")</script>, was her elder brother. She was educated at home and brought up in the family traditions of public service, Liberalism, and nonconformity. She never married, and lived as the &#145;daughter at home&#146; at Ford Bank, Didsbury, Manchester. Her father, the major influence on her life, was a leading Manchester Liberal and Unitarian, renowned for his philanthropy (especially his contribution to the expansion of Manchester University during the 1870s).<br>
<br>From 1875 Margaret Ashton worked on a voluntary basis as the manager of the Flowery Fields School in Hyde, which had been founded by her grandfather, Thomas Ashton (1775&#150;1845), for the children of mill workers. Her first involvement in politics came in 1888, when she helped to found the Manchester Women's Guardian Association, an organization which encouraged women to become poor-law guardians and to take a more active role in local politics. In 1895 she joined the Women's Liberal Association, and the following year became a founder member of the Women's Trade Union League.<br>
<br>Her father died in 1898 and her mother moved to London, leaving Margaret Ashton free to pursue her own political ambitions and interests. She was elected to the Withington urban district council in 1900; in 1903 she was co-opted onto the Lancashire local education authority. In 1908 she stood as an independent candidate and was the first woman to be elected to the Manchester city council. As a councillor she devoted herself to the issues of women's health and education, and campaigned to improve the conditions of employment for women. She supported new legislation to improve the wages and conditions of factory girls, to raise the age of employment of children, and to abolish the sweated system. Ashton House, a municipal hostel for working women, was named in tribute to her work in 1910. In 1911 she was elected a governor of Manchester High School for Girls, and was made a member of the court of governors of the university; she was awarded an honorary MA in recognition of her work for women's education in Manchester.<br>
<br>Margaret Ashton was a member of Manchester's public health committee, and chaired its maternity and child welfare subcommittee. The fall in infant mortality in Manchester between 1914 and 1920 was in part due to her implementation of health reforms, especially her support for municipal mother and baby clinics, and the introduction of free milk for young children and nursing mothers. Her interest in the infant welfare movement was encouraged by Dr Catherine Chisholm (1878&#150;1952); in 1914 they founded the Manchester Babies' Hospital, which Miss Ashton helped to support financially and in which she retained a lifelong interest.<br>
<br>In 1906 Margaret Ashton resigned from the Liberal Party when it became clear to her that it did not intend to give women the vote. She became chair of the North of England Society for Women's Suffrage, and financially supported its newspaper, the <span class="italic">Common Cause</span>. A constitutional suffragist, she regarded the vote as essential for improving women's lives, but did not approve of the militant tactics of the Women's Social and Political Union. Politically, she gradually moved to the left, urged on by her conclusion that women would obtain the vote only with the support of the Labour Party, which she joined in 1913. The suffrage agitation diminished with the outbreak of war in 1914; Margaret Ashton was a committed pacifist, who believed that if women had the vote, wars would be impossible. She was one of the founders of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WIL) in 1915. Her pacifism made her unpopular both on the council and in her own family: she was branded &#145;pro-German&#146; and ousted from the council in 1921. Her civic work was never properly recognized; a portrait by Henry Lamb to commemorate her seventieth birthday was refused by the Manchester City Art Gallery as a protest against her pacifist views.<br>
<br>After she left the city council, Margaret Ashton continued her work for the babies' hospital and the WIL; she joined the National Council of Women, and helped to found the Manchester Women's Citizens Association. Although active for most of her life, she was hampered in her last years by poor vision and heart trouble. She died at her home, 12 Kingston Road, Didsbury, on 15 October 1937 and was cremated at the Manchester crematorium on 22 October.<br>
<br>Margaret Ashton's work for suffrage gave her a national platform, but she always regarded Manchester as the main focus of her philanthropic and political work. &#145;I owe everything to Manchester&#146;, she once said; in return, Manchester owes her a considerable debt.<br>
