<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ridley,  Henry Nicholas</span>  (1855&#150;1956), <span class="occ">economic botanist</span>, was born on 10 December 1855 at West Harling Hall, Norfolk, the third child of the Revd Oliver Matthew Ridley and his wife, Louisa Pole, daughter of William Stuart, of Aldenham Abbey. He was a direct descendant of John Stuart, third earl of Bute (1713&#150;1792), who also achieved botanical distinction and acted as scientific adviser to Princess Augusta when she was initiating the botanical gardens at Kew.<br>
<br>Ridley was educated at Haileybury College and at Exeter College, Oxford, where he obtained a second-class degree in natural science in 1878. In 1880 he was awarded the Burdett&#150;Coutts scholarship in geology. However, the necessity of obtaining paid employment led him, in the same year, to take a position in the botanical department of the British Museum at South Kensington. There he began to develop an interest in the geographical distribution of plants. Seven years later he accompanied the Edinburgh zoologist G. A. Ramage on a Royal Society sponsored expedition to Brazil.<br>
<br>This tropical experience led to Ridley's selection, in 1888, as director of the botanical gardens at Singapore, where his responsibilities included the making of a preliminary forest survey. The survey, combined with his extensive exploration of the adjacent territories, provided much of the material and information which led to his <span class="italic">Flora of the Malay Peninsula</span> (5 vols., 1922&#150;5). In addition to his travels within the Malay peninsula Ridley also visited Borneo and Sumatra (1897) and the Christmas and Keeling islands (1890&#150;91). He was in Sarawak four times between 1903 and 1915. In 1911 he was in southern Siam. He retired from the Singapore gardens in the same year, but his botanical travels continued. In 1912 he was in Burma, India, and Egypt, in 1915 in Java, and a year later in Jamaica. From all these areas he took back material which enriched the collections at Kew and one genus, <i>Ranalisma</i>, is known only from the specimens which Ridley collected.<br>
<br>On his appointment to Singapore, Ridley found there seedlings of the Par&aacute; rubber tree which had been sent from Kew. Ridley's faith in the value of the Par&aacute; rubber as a plantation crop in Malaya led him to persuade planters to experiment with the new crop and to overcome a number of early difficulties. His services in establishing the rubber plantation industry were recognized by the award of the gold medal of the Rubber Planters' Association in 1914 and fourteen years later by the award of the American Frank Meyer medal.<br>
<br>Ridley's active interest in the applied aspects of botany was further demonstrated by his initiation of the <span class="italic">Agricultural Bulletin of the Malay States</span> (for which he wrote many papers) and by his book, <span class="italic">Spices</span> (1912). He was also keenly interested in problems of plant dispersal, especially by animals and wind. This finally found expression in his book, <span class="italic">The Dispersal of Plants throughout the World</span> (1930), which he wrote in the years following his retirement. In 1941 he married his housekeeper, Lily Eliza, daughter of the late Charles Doran, builder.<br>
<br>Ridley was a versatile and entertaining conversationalist who, almost to the end of his days, enjoyed imparting his reminiscences to others. He was elected FRS in 1907, appointed CMG in 1911, and awarded the gold medal of the Linnean Society in 1950. On his hundredth birthday he received numerous tributes from home and overseas, among which was an appreciation from the president and council of the Royal Society. He was a prolific writer. On botanical subjects alone he wrote some 270 papers, and more than fifty others dealt with zoological topics; about ninety more were on agricultural and applied botanical subjects and a further forty on a variety of topics, geological, medical, ethnological, and biographical. Until he became bedridden he was a never-failing observer of the birds in Kew Gardens.<br>
<br>Ridley was short in stature and in later years distinctly rotund, but his appearance was not undistinguished because of the keen observant eyes. He died at his home, 7 Cumberland Road, Kew, on 24 October 1956, less than two months before his 101st birthday. He was the last surviving founder member of the Society for Psychical Research.<br>
