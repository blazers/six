<span class="headword">Tattersall,  William de Chair</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1751, <em>d.</em> 1829), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and musician</span>, was baptized on 11 September 1751 at Charing, Kent, the second son of James Tattersall (<i>d</i>. 1784), and his first wife, Dorothy, daughter of the Revd William de Chair and sister of the Revd Dr John de Chair, rector of Little Rissington, Gloucestershire, and a chaplain to George II. His father was successively rector of Blatchington, Sussex (1742&#150;6), and of Charing, Kent (1746&#150;55); curate of Egerton, also in Kent (1749&#150;55); and rector of Streatham, Surrey (1755), and of St Paul's, Covent Garden, until his death.<br>
<br>William Tattersall was admitted to Westminster School as a king's scholar in 1765; there, as an actor, his performance of Phormio in Terence's play of that name is said to have elicited David Garrick's praise. He was elected to Christ Church, Oxford, in June 1770, as head of the list of king's scholars, and having graduated BA in 1774 and MA in 1777 he was presented by his college in 1778 to the rectory of Wotton under Edge, Gloucestershire. About this time his father presented him to the sinecure rectory of Westbourne, Sussex, where he appears to have spent the remainder of his life. On 16 February 1779, at St Paul's, Covent Garden, he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1852), eldest daughter of George Ward of Wandsworth, Surrey.<br>
<br>Tattersall officiated as chaplain to Sir Francis Buller, and in 1803 was appointed a chaplain to George III. However, his most durable contribution was musical, and consisted of new, more accessible psalm settings, which effectively united music and worship in the lives of the &#145;lower orders&#146;. This formed part of &#145;an attempt to reform English parish church music&#146;  (Holman), which Tattersall achieved by introducing idioms of a dissenting nature into the Church of England. He adapted the &#145;refined and &#147;poetic&#148; version of the psalms&#146;  (ibid.) by James Merrick for the use of his own congregation and then published, complete with preface, <span class="italic">A version or paraphrase of the Psalms by J. Merrick, adapted to the purposes of public or private devotion</span> (1789), set in three parts to new and existing melodies. Encouraged by George Horne (bishop of Norwich), Richard Beadon (bishop of Gloucester), and others, Tattersall divided the psalms into stanzas and republished the work, which appeared as late as 1822. The next volume, entitled <span class="italic">Improved Psalmody</span> (1794), also enjoyed several editions and contained tunes adapted from Handel and the old masters, as well as many new ones contributed by leading composers and organists of the day. Among these were &#145;his intimate friend&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>) Sir William Parsons and Haydn, who produced six masterful settings. Many of the contributors, including Haydn, were members of the Musical Graduates Club. The collection had a very impressive list of subscribers, including royalty; there were, after all, long-standing family connections with the highest echelon of society. A third volume, dedicated to the king, was published in 1802 and &#145;in deference to the tastes of George III&#146;  (Temperley), used settings based solely on Handel's sacred works. These works were a popular and influential, if not lucrative, enterprise. Only three volumes of twenty-five psalms each were issued (rather than all 150 in 6 volumes), though they were conceived with use in the home as well as the church in mind and could incorporate a range of instrumental accompaniment if an organ was not available.<br>
<br>Tattersall, who was &#145;of a most hospitable disposition&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>), died at Rectorial House, Westbourne, on 26 March 1829 (<span class="italic">GM</span>; Temperley gives Wotton under Edge on 26 May). He was survived by his wife, their two sons, James and John, and two daughters, Mary-Anne and Jane. Another son, George, had predeceased his father, leaving a son and a daughter of his own. The eldest son, James, fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and physician to the Surrey dispensary, died on 8 May 1855.<br>
