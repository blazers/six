<span class="headword">Yellowlees, Sir  Henry</span>  (1919&#150;2006), <span class="occ">medical officer</span>, was born on 16 April 1919 at 3 Cumin Place, Edinburgh, the elder son and eldest of three children of Henry Yellowlees (1888&#150;1971), psychiatrist, and his wife, Dorothy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davis, a professional cellist. He spent his early childhood with his siblings David and Dorothy at The Retreat, a Quaker psychiatric centre in York, where his father was medical superintendent from 1922 to 1929 before moving to St Thomas's Hospital, London. He was educated at Bramcote preparatory school in Scarborough and then at Stowe School before reading medicine at University College, Oxford. In 1941 he joined the Royal Air Force, serving as a pilot and instructor until 1945. This delayed his entry into medical school at the Middlesex Hospital, and he graduated BM BCh in 1950. Meanwhile, on 21 August 1948, he had married Gwyneth Bramwell (Sally) Comber, (<i>d</i>. 2001), a nurse two years his senior, the divorced wife of Andrew Stephen Charles Comber, and the daughter of Francis Joseph William Maddox, naval engineer. They had two daughters and one son.<br>
<br>Yellowlees's first post was at the Middlesex as resident medical officer, and his effective management of an outbreak of meningitis among the staff was noted by the chief medical officer, Sir George Godber. Yellowlees gained extensive experience in the medical management of the National Health Service through appointments at the south-west regional hospital board (1954&#150;9) and the north-west metropolitan regional hospital board (1959&#150;63). In 1963 he accepted an invitation from Godber for a secondment to a civil service post at the Ministry of Health as a principal medical officer, and two years later he was appointed as a permanent senior principal medical officer. He worked closely with Godber, and was promoted to the position of deputy chief medical officer in 1967, shortly before the Ministry of Health was amalgamated into the Department of Health and Social Security.<br>
<br>Yellowlees' succeeded Godber as chief medical officer in 1973 and served in that post for the next ten years, until his retirement in 1983, working for five secretaries of state for health: Sir Keith Joseph, Barbara Castle, David Ennals, Patrick Jenkin, and Norman Fowler. The post of chief medical officer was widely recognized as one of the most arduous within government. The occupant acted as a &#145;gatekeeper&#146;, ensuring that appropriate medical advice was provided for the secretary of state to react to health crises and also to develop new health policies and medical services; had responsibility for medical advice given to other government departments, including the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Education and Science, and the Home Office; and acted as a conduit between the government and the medical profession, helping with negotiations on such sensitive issues as doctors' pay, working conditions, medical education, and fitness to practise. It is testimony to Yellowlees' considerable managerial skills that he steered the governments he served through a number of crises, in addition to furthering the development of the medical profession and health service in Britain.<br>
<br>Some of the most difficult situations that Yellowlees handled were related to the economic crises of the 1970s, which forced rationalizations in NHS budgets. The matter became politically complicated in 1974 when Barbara Castle determined to push through Labour's long-held manifesto pledge to remove &#145;pay beds&#146;&#151;one of the final vestiges of private medicine&#151;from NHS hospitals. Yellowlees worked hard to restore the relations between the government and the medical profession, and was knighted KCB in 1975 (having been made a CB in 1971). During his tenure he also initiated some key health policies. He enabled the development of community medicine and accident and emergency medicine, drafted legislation that reduced the amount of lead in petrol, and made the wearing of car seat belts compulsory. He chaired the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food which developed daily nutritional guidelines, a topic he further promoted through his membership of the Council of the British Nutrition Foundation from 1973 to 1995. He was instrumental in reducing the number of hours worked by junior doctors, and helping women doctors to continue with their careers while raising families.<br>
<br>Like previous chief medical officers Yellowlees served as a member of the General Medical Council (1979&#150;89) and the Medical Research Council (1974&#150;83). He was well-connected within the medical establishment both in Britain and overseas. He participated in annual meetings with American and Canadian health officials, and those of the World Health Organization. His time in office also coincided with the global elimination of smallpox, the discovery of Lassa fever, and the first cases of legionnaire's disease in Britain. When he retired as chief medical officer in 1983 he was appointed an adviser to the Ministry of Defence on the restructuring of the medical services of the armed forces. He then became a consultant for the European office of the World Health Organization, and played a significant role in the 1980s Balkans dispute by successfully negotiating with the Turks and Bulgarians for the provision of healthcare for refugees. He remained engaged with British medicine through his position on the council of the British Medical Association from 1986 to 1990, and chaired its group on euthanasia policy.<br>
<br>Yellowlees's colleagues found him &#145;a joy to work with, always considerate of staff and aware of pressures on them, approachable, modest about his own considerable achievements, with a strong sense of humour and a charming manner&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 12 April 2006). He was divorced in 1984, and in the same year he met (Patricia) Mary Porter (<i>b</i>. 1947/8), healthcare consultant, and daughter of William John McGowan, account supervisor; they married on 7 February 2001. Heart bypass surgery in 1997 gave Yellowlees a new lease of life, and he continued to enjoy gardening, walking by the sea, and listening to Gilbert and Sullivan operas. In his last years he found in humanism an expression of his core beliefs and requested a humanist funeral. He died at his home, 33 Lea Road, Harpenden, Hertfordshire, on 22 March 2006 of heart failure, and was cremated at Watford. He was survived by his second wife, Mary, and by the three children of his first marriage, Ian, Rosemary, and Linda, all of whom had followed their parents into medical or nursing careers.<br>
