<span class="headword">Simson,  Patrick</span>  (1556&#150;1618), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born at Perth, the eldest of the seven sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25601/', "Andrew Simson (c.1526&#150;1591?)")</script> and his wife, Violet Adamson, sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/145/', "Patrick Adamson")</script>, archbishop of St Andrews. His brothers, all but one of whom also became ministers, included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25608/', "William Simson (b. 1562, d. in or after 1623)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25603/', "Archibald Simson (1564&#150;1628)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25600/', "Alexander Simson (1570&#150;1639)")</script>. He also had three sisters. His father was schoolmaster at Perth and became minister of Dunning and Cargill shortly after the Reformation, before being translated to Dunbar in 1564. Having been educated in the classics by his father, Patrick entered the University of St Andrews in 1571 and graduated MA in 1575. It was intended that he proceed to Cambridge, but on his way there he met an English gentleman who put the library in his house at Brigstock, Northamptonshire, at Simson's disposal, enabling him to acquire an extensive knowledge of the literary and historical remains of antiquity, both lay and ecclesiastical. His father then fell sick and recalled Simson to Scotland, where he assisted in the school at Dunbar by teaching Greek. In 1577 he was admitted minister of the adjoining parish of Spott, which with Aldhame and the Bass constituted both a prebend in the collegiate church of Dunbar and a free parsonage, and he continued to teach weekly at Dunbar.<br>
<br>In 1582 Simson became minister of Cramond in the presbytery of Edinburgh; he was provided to the vicarage on 30 August 1586. In 1584 the ministers of the presbytery were ordered to subscribe the so-called &#145;black acts&#146; in favour of episcopacy, and to promise obedience to their bishop on pain of forfeiting their stipends. Although his diocesan was his maternal uncle, Patrick Adamson, Simson refused, showing himself then as always implacably opposed to the reintroduction of bishops. During his time at Cramond he was himself offered a see, but unsurprisingly declined it. He later also refused a pension.<br>
<br>In 1590 the general assembly translated Simson to Stirling, a royal residence. He was admitted on 7 August and received the crown's presentation in May 1591. He held the benefice for the rest of his life. He had considerable influence with the king, to whom he was constantly loyal and respectful, and also with John Erskine, second earl of Mar, a leading courtier and Prince Henry's keeper. When James renewed his efforts to reintroduce episcopacy, however, Simson was once more a leading opponent of royal policy. Early in 1606 he attended the trial for treason at Linlithgow of six ministers who had attended an assembly which the king had banned, and was their main supporter; in July that year he drew up and signed the protest against episcopacy presented to the Scottish parliament; and when Andrew Melville was imprisoned in the Tower of London in March 1607 he organized a subscription for him. In the latter year the general assembly nominated him permanent moderator of the presbytery of Stirling, but he refused the appointment, probably because it appeared dangerously similar to episcopal office. However, on 15 June 1608 Simson was elected moderator of the conference at Falkland between bishops and representatives of the kirk, at which the latter called for the maintenance of presbyterianism. He also opposed the liturgical changes which followed the restoration of bishops, regarding them as the deplorable product of English influence and reportedly declaring: &#145;Alace! I see all the midden (or dunghill) of the muck of the corruption of the Kirk of Ingland comeing on upon us, and it will wrack us, if God send not help in time&#146;  (Mullan, <span class="italic">Scottish Puritanism</span>, 268).<br>
<br>In spite of his anti-episcopal fervour Simson was by nature moderate, peaceable, and charitable, so much so that he was sometimes blamed for his conciliatory spirit by extremists on his own side. He took a leading part in preventing schism in the church, and urged his brethren to continue to attend synods after the bishops began to preside over them. He attended at least ten general assemblies before 1610 (only one more was held in his lifetime). He continued his studies into his fifties, when he learned Hebrew, and was often consulted by his clerical brethren for his wisdom and learning. A notable preacher and pastor, he was held in considerable affection by his flock, many of whom venerated him as their spiritual father. On his coming to Stirling he found the townspeople disorderly and violent, with merchants and craftsmen apt to engage in bloody combat in the streets, and he restored order to the community. In times of plague he remained in his parish and performed his ministerial duties at the risk of his own life. When he lay dying people of all ranks crowded to his bedside to receive his blessing and brought their children with them. Nearly fifty years afterwards John Livingstone, writing in exile in the Netherlands, looked back to his childhood in Stirling and remembered Simson as &#145;a man learned, godly, and very faithfull in the cause of God&#146;  (Mullan, <span class="italic">Scottish Puritanism</span>, 35).<br>
<br>Simson married twice. His first wife was Martha Baron, the daughter of an Edinburgh burgess; they had three sons, all of whom became ministers, and a daughter, Lilias, who married John Gillespie, minister of Alva, and was the mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10735/', "George Gillespie")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10737/', "Patrick Gillespie")</script>. Following Martha's death Simson married a daughter of Leslie of Kinnaird. He died after many years of ill health on 31 March 1618 at Stirling and was buried in the choir of Stirling parish church. It was claimed that owing to &#145;the persecution of the Prelats&#146; his funeral sermon had to be delivered at night  (Mullan, <span class="italic">Episcopacy</span>, 130). Between 1609 and 1616 he published four works of church history which were subsequently brought together into a single volume by his brother Archibald as <span class="italic">The Historie of the Church since the Dayes of our Saviour Jesus Christ untill this Present Age</span> (1624). It was dedicated by Archibald to the duke of Richmond, but Patrick Simson's own epistle dedicatory was addressed to Mary, countess of Mar, one of several noblewomen who had held him in high regard.<br>
