<span class="headword">Mellanby, Sir  Edward</span>  (1884&#150;1955), <span class="occ">medical scientist and administrator</span>, was born at West Hartlepool, co. Durham, on 8 April 1884, the youngest of the four sons and six children of John Mellanby, manager of the shipyard of the Furness-Withy Company, and his wife, Mary Isabella Lawson. Elder brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34981/', "John Mellanby (1878&#150;1939)")</script>, the physiologist, and Alexander Lawson Mellanby (1871&#150;1951), who became professor of civil and mechanical engineering at the Royal Technical College, Glasgow. From Barnard Castle School, where he was head boy and captain of cricket and football, Mellanby gained an exhibition to Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Having been placed in the second class in part I of the natural sciences tripos (1904), and the first class with physiology as his special study in part II (1905), he obtained a research studentship at Emmanuel, which he held until 1907, working under the guidance of Frederick Gowland Hopkins, his former tutor, whose influence largely determined the rest of Mellanby's career. He completed his medical studies at St Thomas's Hospital, London, where between 1909 and 1911 he was a demonstrator in physiology, and during 1910&#150;12 held a Beit memorial fellowship for medical research. In 1913 he became a lecturer in and later professor of physiology at King's College for Women, London, where he remained until 1920. He maintained a distinguished association with Cambridge, where he graduated MD in 1915 and was awarded the Walsingham medal (1907) and the Gedge (1908) and Raymond Horton-Smith (1915) prizes.<br>
<br>In 1914 Mellanby married May Tweedy, who had been a fellow student at Cambridge, and was herself engaged in physiological research at Bedford College, London<a href="#cosubject_52398"> [<i>see below</i>]</a>; they had no children.<br>
<br>The research work for which Mellanby was perhaps best known was his investigation of rickets, begun in 1914 at the request of the Medical Research Committee. His first major publication on the subject was &#145;An experimental investigation on rickets&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lancet</span>, 196, 15 March 1919, 407&#150;12). Mellanby established that the main cause of the disease was deficiency of a fat-soluble vitamin, which came to be known as vitamin D. At a later stage he demonstrated the rachitogenic action of certain cereals. His researches, however, extended over a wide range and he was recognized as an outstanding expert in the biochemical and physiological field.<br>
<br>Mellanby was appointed in 1920 to the newly founded chair of pharmacology at the University of Sheffield and as honorary physician to the Royal Infirmary. In 1931 he was appointed chairman of an international conference for the standardization of vitamins. In 1933 he succeeded Walter Fletcher as secretary of the Medical Research Council, having been a member of the council for two years; and shortly after this appointment he accepted the Fullerian professorship of the Royal Institution (1936&#150;7). He was also the chairman of the international technical commission on nutrition in 1934, and in the same year published <span class="italic">Nutrition and Disease: the Interaction of Clinical and Experimental Work</span>. Before and during the Second World War he was involved in schemes concerning wartime diet, as well as the welfare of service personnel and civilians, and was chairman of the royal naval and the flying personnel research committees, a member of a similar committee relating to the army, a member of the scientific advisory committee of the cabinet, and chairman of the colonial medical research committee. The Medical Research Council, under Mellanby's direction, and the Ministry of Health were jointly responsible in 1939 for the setting up of an Emergency Public Health Laboratory Service, which after the war became the Public Health Laboratory Service. He retired from the Medical Research Council in 1949. The previous year the new Institute for Medical Research, with the planning of which Mellanby had been closely concerned, opened at Mill Hill, London.<br>
<br>Mellanby was appointed KCB in 1937 and GBE in 1948 and received a number of foreign decorations. From 1937 to 1941 he was an honorary physician to George VI. He was elected FRS in 1925, FRCP in 1928, and honorary FRCS Edinburgh in 1946. In 1935 he and his wife were jointly awarded the Charles Mickle fellowship of Toronto University.<br>
<br>Among Mellanby's other awards were the Royal and Buchanan medals from the Royal Society and the Bissett-Hawkins, Moxon, and Baly medals from the Royal College of Physicians; the Halley-Stewart prize for medical research from the British Medical Association; and the Cameron prize from Edinburgh University. He was elected an honorary fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge (1946), and received honorary degrees from a number of universities. He gave many special lectures on medical and scientific subjects, including the Croonian lecture of the Royal Society; the Oliver Sharpey and Croonian lectures and the Harveian oration of the Royal College of Physicians; the Linacre and Rede lectures of Cambridge University, published as <span class="italic">Recent Advances in Medical Science: a Study of their Social and Economic Implications</span> (1939); the Ludwig Mond lecture (Manchester University); a special bicentenary lecture at the Royal College of Surgeons; and the Robert Boyle, Stephen Paget, and Hopkins memorial lectures. In 1947 he held the Abraham Flexner lectureship at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, which involved a period of three months' residence in Nashville.<br>
<br>During the last year or two of his secretaryship of the Medical Research Council, Mellanby attended meetings abroad on behalf of the British government and the Colonial Office and at the invitation of the South African Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. After his retirement he undertook two further advisory missions, the first to India (where he played a significant part in the establishment of the Central Drug Research Institute at Lucknow and was its first director for a few months in 1950&#150;51) and the second to Australia and New Zealand. For the most part, however, he spent his retirement at work in his laboratory at Mill Hill and it was there that he died, quietly and unexpectedly, on 30 January 1955.<br>
<br>Mellanby was tall and handsome, friendly and unaffected, with a great sense of fun and a certain boyishness. To those who did not know him well, his more endearing personal qualities were sometimes masked by his brusque, forthright manner; generally, however, this was due to a wish to stimulate argument and, if his help was being sought, to find out what was in the mind of his inquirer, so that he could advise to the best of his ability.<br>
<br>Mellanby's wife, <a name="cosubject_52398"></a><span class="headword">May Mellanby</span>, Lady Mellanby  (1882&#150;1978), <span class="occ">physiologist</span>, was born in London, the eldest daughter of George Tweedy, a businessman, and his wife, Rosa. She spent part of her childhood in Russia, where her father was involved in the development of the oil industry and, after being educated at Hampstead and Bromley high schools, went up to Girton College, Cambridge in 1902. She sat both parts of the natural sciences tripos in 1905 and 1906, achieving the equivalent of a second-class degree. Appointed a research fellow and then a lecturer at Bedford College for Women, London University, she held the latter post until her marriage in 1914.<br>
<br>While at Bedford College, May worked with her future brother-in-law J. S. Edkins on gastric secretion. Following her marriage, she collaborated with her husband on a range of nutritional studies, but also developed her own research on the nutritional influences on dental development which was carried out for the Medical Research Committee and its successor body, the Medical Research Council. May published a number of research papers, which were summarized in a chapter of her husband's <span class="italic">Nutrition and Disease</span> (1934), as well as three <span class="roman">Special Reports</span> for the MRC (1929, 1930, 1934). She was awarded the honorary degree of DSc by the universities of Sheffield (1933) and Liverpool (1934) and was elected to the Physiological Society in 1956. She died in London on 5 March 1978.<br>
