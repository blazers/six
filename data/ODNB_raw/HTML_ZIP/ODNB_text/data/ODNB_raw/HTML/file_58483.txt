<span class="headword">Skeat,  Walter William</span>  (1835&#150;1912), <span class="occ">philologist</span>, was born at Mount Street, Park Lane, London, on 21 November 1835, the second son of William Skeat and his wife, Sarah Bluck. He attended King's College School, Strand, where Thomas Oswald Cockayne, one of the best Anglo-Saxon scholars of the time, was his form-master. From there he went to Sir Roger Cholmeley's School, Highgate, and in 1854 entered Christ's College, Cambridge. There C. S. Calverley, J. R. Seeley, and Walter Besant were among his friends. He studied theology and mathematics, took the mathematical tripos (fourteenth wrangler) in 1858, and was elected a fellow of his college in 1860. In the latter year he took orders, and entered on his first curacy at East Dereham, Norfolk. On 15 November 1860 he married Bertha Clara Jones (1840&#150;1924), eldest daughter of Francis Jones, of Lewisham. They had two sons and four daughters, including <a href="#cosubject_58483">Bertha Marian Skeat [<i>see below</i>]</a> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94840/', "Walter William Skeat (1866&#150;1953)")</script>, colonial administrator and ethnographer. Two years later Skeat became curate of Godalming, but a serious illness affecting his throat closed his career in the church.<br>
<br>Skeat returned to Cambridge, and was appointed to a mathematical lectureship at Christ's College in 1864. The duties left him ample leisure, and he now began the serious study of Early English, which had first been roused by the extracts in the history book which he used at school; he had worked back to them through the <span class="italic">Faerie Queene</span>. But it was Frederick James Furnivall who first set him to work as an editor. The discussion of plans for the <span class="italic">New English Dictionary</span> (later the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span>) had revealed a dearth of trustworthy early texts, and to supply the want Furnivall and Richard Morris formed the Early English Text Society in 1864. Skeat was pressed into service, and punctually edited <span class="italic">Lancelot of the Laik</span> (1865). In 1866 he began his great edition of <span class="italic">Piers Plowman</span>, which was finished twenty years later. This remained the standard edition for over a hundred years, and crucially influenced twentieth-century textual scholarship on the poem; his interpretative and historical notes are still referred to by modern critics and editors. The first part of his edition of John Barbour's <span class="italic">The Bruce</span> appeared in 1870, and by 1872 he had published the <span class="italic">Treatise on the Astrolabe</span>. This was one of many studies preliminary to his seven-volume edition of Chaucer (1894&#150;7), another standard work which was not superseded until the edition of Robinson in 1933, and whose interpretative and historical notes were regularly consulted by editors working on the Riverside edition of Chaucer, published in 1987. This might seem a life's work, but it is only a part of Skeat's contribution to the study of one century&#151;the fourteenth. He produced two standard works in Anglo-Saxon, the <span class="italic">Anglo-Saxon Gospels</span> (1871&#150;87) and &AElig;lfric's <span class="italic">Lives of Saints</span> (1881&#150;1900), and in 1873 he founded the English Dialect Society, which prepared the way for the <span class="italic">English Dialect Dictionary</span> (edited by Joseph Wright, 1896&#150;1905). Another important book, his <span class="italic">Etymological Dictionary</span> (1879&#150;82; revised and enlarged, 1910), was begun with the purpose of collecting and sifting material for the use of the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span>. This project was one to which he made an enormous contribution, ranging from editorial work (including supplying numerous quotations) to supporting the dictionary's editor, J. A. H. Murray, with a mortgage to purchase his house.<br>
<br>Besides these larger works, Skeat found time to edit Chatterton (1871), to write many textbooks for schools and universities, to popularize philology and modernize old authors, and to contribute freely to the learned societies and journals concerned with English studies. Furthermore, in his latter years he led the way in the systematic study of place names, county by county. In 1878 he was elected to the new Elrington and Bosworth professorship of Anglo-Saxon at Cambridge.<br>
<br>All Skeat's vast output is distinguished by accuracy in matter of fact, wide learning, and humanity, and most of it he produced without prospect of reward, out of devotion to his subject. His own prescription for such monuments of scholarship was enthusiasm, with unremitting application, and he wasted no time. He could also set practical limits to his curiosity: in the preface to the first edition of the <span class="italic">Etymological Dictionary</span> he explains that he usually gave three hours to a difficult word&#151;&#145;During that time I made the best I could of it and then let it go.&#146; This requires self-sacrifice in a scholar, but it is the secret of Skeat's great service. According to his obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, Skeat was the first Cambridge professor to ride a bicycle, and was in general better known to the general public of Cambridge than were his professorial colleagues. This was partly because of the fame of his etymological dictionary, on which he conducted a vast correspondence with word enthusiasts both professional and amateur, and partly because<blockquote>in fine weather he almost invariably walked the mile and a half from his house [2 Salisbury Villas] to the Divinity Schools, where he lectured, in a peculiar ambling trot, with his silk gown caught up behind him on one arm. His white beard at once attracted attention, and it never seemed rude to watch him because he always appeared oblivious of passers-by. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 8 Oct 1912)</blockquote>Walter William Skeat died at 2 Salisbury Villas, Cambridge, on 6 October 1912, survived by his wife, two sons, and three daughters. He was buried in the grounds of the parish church of the Ascension, Huntingdon Road, Cambridge. In 1935 a commemorative stained-glass window, designed and executed by one of his grandsons, F. W. Skeat, was placed in the library of his old college. It depicts Geoffrey Chaucer on horseback, with Canterbury Cathedral in the background.<br>
<br>The new school of philology that arose towards 1880, when the lines of Skeat's work were laid down and much of it done, produced men like Zupitza and Sievers in Germany, or Henry Sweet, A. S. Napier, and Henry Bradley in England, who went beyond Skeat in linguistic theory and in exact methods. But Skeat's pioneer work made such advances possible. At a critical moment in English studies he saw the wisdom of Furnivall's doctrine, that the essential thing was to attract workers, and to make available for them quickly a great quantity of materials, edited as well as possible, but always with a time limit in view rather than perfection in minutiae. And perhaps he gained as much ground for his subject by quiet sapping as Furnivall took by storm.<br>

<a name="cosubject_58483"></a><span class="headword">Bertha Marian Skeat</span>  (1861&#150;1948), <span class="occ">schoolmistress</span>, was born on 30 December 1861 at Quebec Road, East Dereham, Norfolk, the eldest child of Walter William Skeat and his wife, Bertha Clara, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones. She read medieval and modern languages at Newnham College, Cambridge (1882&#150;6), and gained a first-class examination result in 1886. After obtaining a Cambridge teacher's certificate she took a PhD degree at the University of Z&uuml;rich, and returned as a lecturer at the Cambridge Teaching College for Women (1890&#150;93). Thereafter she occupied a number of teaching positions before becoming co-founder and principal of Baliol School, Sedbergh, from 1899 to 1932, when the school closed. She published a <span class="italic">Word-List</span> illustrating the correspondence of modern English with Anglo-French vowel sounds for the English Dialect Society (1884), a primer of historical English grammar, and two anthologies of English literature for use in schools. She also wrote some pleasant but undistinguished verse in late-Victorian sentimental style, including school plays, principally concerning the relations between mothers and daughters; such publications include: <span class="italic">The Lamentations of Mary Magdalene</span> (1897), <span class="italic">Atalanta's Race</span> (1907), and <span class="italic">The Crucifixion of Mary, and other Poems</span> [1924]. Bertha Marian Skeat died, unmarried, at Baliol Cottage, Sedbergh, Yorkshire, on 2 December 1948.<br>
