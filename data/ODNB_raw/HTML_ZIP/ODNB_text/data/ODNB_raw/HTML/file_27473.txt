<span class="headword">T&iacute;rech&aacute;n</span> <span class="st"> [St T&iacute;rech&aacute;n]</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>690), <span class="occ">bishop and writer</span>, was the author of the so-called <span class="italic">Collectanea</span> about St Patrick that forms part of the <span class="roman">Book of Armagh</span>. His feast day is 3 July, but his sainthood may have been acquired late: he is not in the <span class="roman">Genealogies of the Saints</span>, nor in any martyrology before the twelfth century. Reportedly a native of Tirawley, co. Sligo, he became a bishop, though no see is named. The <span class="italic">Collectanea</span> implies that he belonged to the U&iacute; Amolngada (in the north-west of the present-day co. Mayo), and to a branch (descended from Conall, son of &Eacute;ndae, son of Amolngaid) who were servants of Patrick. His kinship may thus explain why T&iacute;rech&aacute;n became, with Muirch&uacute; maccu Machtheni, one of two major Patrician hagiographers of the late seventh century. He was a disciple of Ult&aacute;n, bishop of Ardbraccan in Brega (in what is now co. Meath), who died in 657, from whom he claims to have derived information, both by word of mouth and from his book, the exact nature of which is unknown. On the other hand, the <span class="italic">Collectanea</span> was probably written <i>c</i>.690: before 696, the beginning of the reign of Loingsech mac &Oacute;engusso (of Cen&eacute;l Conaill), since he takes for granted the supremacy of the southern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill dynasties; also probably before 693, since he seems to assume that the king of Leinster belongs to the U&iacute; D&uacute;nlainge. The reign of the U&iacute; D&uacute;nlainge king of Leinster, Bran mac Conaill maic F&aacute;el&aacute;in, from 680 to 693, was preceded and followed by kings of a rival dynasty. The date is probably after 688 since he refers to &#145;the recent plagues&#146; in the plural  (<span class="italic">Collectanea</span>, chap. 25). Adomn&aacute;n, writing <i>c</i>.700, speaks of two major plagues in his lifetime, presumably those of 664&#150;6 and the one he dates himself, 686&#150;8.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Collectanea</span>&#151;first given this title by Archbishop James Ussher (1581&#150;1656)&#151;is not a life such as that written at much the same date by Muirch&uacute;. It purports to recount a journey taking Patrick round the northern half of Ireland, beginning in Brega (on the coast north of Dublin), going west across the midlands through the kingdoms of the southern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill, across the Shannon into the lands of the Connachta, round the northern coast as far as what is now co. Antrim, then south-west to Armagh, and finally back to Brega. At the end T&iacute;rech&aacute;n briefly takes Patrick via Leinster to Cashel, seat of the kings of Munster. The journey is a convenient framework: he himself admits that Patrick crossed the Shannon not once, but three times. The purpose was to assert that Patrick was the founder of numerous churches as well as the arbiter of the fates of some local dynasties. T&iacute;rech&aacute;n's loyalty, however, was to Patrick and his <i>familia</i> in general rather than to Armagh in particular, which he mentions only once, and then only in passing. The churches to which he gave his greatest attention were Donaghpatrick (Domnach P&aacute;traic), in co. Meath, and a church by &#145;the Wood of Fochluth&#146;  (chap. 42), which may well have been T&iacute;rech&aacute;n's own local church. Donaghpatrick was adjacent to two other sites mentioned by T&iacute;rech&aacute;n. The first was Tailtiu, the site of the annual assembly and fair, the greatest such event in Ireland, and by T&iacute;rech&aacute;n's time an essential element in the high-kingship, monopolized since 637 by the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill. The other site, R&aacute;ith Airthir, was the royal seat of the kings of Brega; the current ruler, Finsnechtae mac D&uacute;nchada, was also king of Tara (as the high-kings were called). T&iacute;rech&aacute;n's text expressed the hope that an alliance between the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill of Brega and the heirs of Patrick might dominate Ireland; he may also have envisaged Donaghpatrick being the chief Patrician church rather than Armagh.<br>
<br>T&iacute;rech&aacute;n apparently did not know Muirch&uacute;'s work, and the reverse may also be true. In any case their intentions, both literary and political, were quite different: while Muirch&uacute; was the champion of Armagh, T&iacute;rech&aacute;n wished to uphold the claims of the heirs of Patrick, without any special reference to Armagh, by attaching the saint on the one hand to many small, often ancient, churches and, on the other, by harnessing the power of the leading U&iacute; N&eacute;ill dynasty of the time behind the <i>familia</i> of Patrick. T&iacute;rech&aacute;n's text offers the first detailed picture of the ecclesiastical and political geography of Ireland. Later lives of Patrick, notably the tripartite life, were principally based on a combination of Muirch&uacute;'s life and T&iacute;rech&aacute;n's <span class="italic">Collectanea</span>. Some of the personalities he records as disciples of Patrick may well be early figures, but it is difficult to see how this can be demonstrated.<br>
