<span class="headword">Palmer,  George Herbert</span>  (1846&#150;1926), <span class="occ">church musician and music scholar</span>, was born at Grantchester on 9 August 1846, the eldest son of Jonathan Palmer, a master printer, of Cambridge, and his wife, Elizabeth, the daughter of Thomas Stevenson, of Rainton, Yorkshire. He was a cousin of the printer and bibliographer William Blades and also of the music critic and historian George Grove.<br>
<br>Brought up in Cambridge, Palmer was greatly influenced by a friend of his father, the liturgiologist John Mason Neale, and after graduating BA at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1869 was ordained deacon in 1869 and priest in 1871 at Chester. His first curacy was at St Margaret's, Toxteth Park, Liverpool, where he also played the organ and attracted the attention of William Thomas Best, one of the greatest organ virtuosos of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>As priest and organist at St Barnabas's Church, Pimlico, from 1876 to 1883, Palmer made the acquaintance of Thomas Helmore, precentor of St Mark's College, Chelsea (1846&#150;77), and one of the pioneers of the revival of Gregorian chant. With G. R. Woodward, the curate of St Barnabas, he began his work on the rediscovery of the authentic plainchant tradition and the adaptation of the chants to English texts. Despite his adaptations being somewhat free, his work in this area was valuable and he was able to keep in touch with the researches of the Benedictine community at Solesmes, near Le Mans, where his music scholarship was greatly respected. Several examples, including <span class="italic">Sarum Hymn Melodies</span> and <span class="italic">Plain Song Manes</span>, were published in the early 1880s by the London Gregorian Choral Association.<br>
<br>In 1888 Palmer co-operated in the foundation of the Plainsong and Medieval Music Society, to which he later made several contributions. He also actively promoted the training of English religious communities in the liturgical music of the church. He produced <span class="italic">The Antiphoner and Grail</span> (1881) and <span class="italic">Harmonies to the Office Hymn Book</span> (1891), and issued, through St Mary's Press, Wantage, <span class="italic">The Sarum Psalter</span> (1894; 6th edn 1920), <span class="italic">The Order of Vespers from the Sarum Breviary</span> (1899), <span class="italic">The Offices, or Introits</span> (1904; 3rd edn 1927), and <span class="italic">A Selection of Grails, Alleluyas and Tracts &hellip; from the Sarum Gradale</span> (1908), as well as many other adaptations of the music of the mass and divine office.<br>
<br>In 1917 the archbishop of Canterbury, Randall Davidson, acting on a petition from a number of influential musicians, conferred on Palmer a Lambeth degree of Doctor of Music. He was presented for the degree by Richard Runciman Terry, organist and director of music at Westminster Cathedral, demonstrating further the esteem with which Palmer's learning was held outside the Anglican communion. During the same year he went to Oxford, and took over for a time the direction of the music at the church of the Society of St John the Evangelist, Cowley, where he had founded a plainchant tradition many years before. He now had the opportunity to concentrate on perhaps his most important work, <span class="italic">The Diurnal Noted</span>, the text of which appeared in 1921 under the title <span class="italic">The Diurnal after the Use of the Illustrious Church of Salisbury</span>. The manuscript of the music was completed just before his death, part 1 being published in 1926 and part 2 in 1929.<br>
<br>An apparently single-minded but generous man, Palmer died at his home, 18 Fairacres Road, Oxford, on 20 June 1926, and was buried in the churchyard of St Mary and St John.<br>
