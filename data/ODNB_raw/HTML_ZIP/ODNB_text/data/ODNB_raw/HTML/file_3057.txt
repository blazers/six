<span class="headword">Bowes,  Paul</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1702), <span class="occ">lawyer and antiquary</span>, was born at Great Bromley, Essex, the second son of Sir Thomas Bowes (<i>d</i>. 1676), witch persecutor, and Mary (<i>b</i>. 1608), third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7576/', "Paul Dewes (1567&#150;1631)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7574/', "Dewes, Garrat")</script>]; his parents had married on 4 December 1626. After being educated at the school at Moulton, Norfolk, he was admitted pensioner of St John's College, Cambridge, on 21 December 1650. He took no degree; indeed, he does not appear to have matriculated. He chose a career in law, and on 12 May 1654 entered the Middle Temple. He was called to the bar on 10 May 1661 and became a bencher on 24 October 1679. By late 1669 he had married Bridget (<i>d</i>. 1706), daughter of Thomas Sturges of the Middle Temple. They had three sons, of whom the eldest, Martin, was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, in April 1686 aged sixteen, and two daughters.<br>
<br>Bowes was an enthusiastic antiquary, and collected enough books to divide them eventually between his first two sons. His interest in the history of parliament led to his judicious and careful edition of the manuscript work of his celebrated uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7577/', "Sir Simonds D'Ewes")</script>. Entitled <span class="italic">The journals of all the parliaments during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, both of the House of Lords and House of Commons</span>, it was published in 1682, with later editions in 1693 and 1708. Bowes was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 30 November 1699.<br>
<br>Bowes died in June 1702 and was buried on 3 July at St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street. His will, dated 5 August 1699, was proved by his widow and sole executor on 16 July 1702. He had made two codicils (dated 17 April and 12 August 1701), the first of which was needed chiefly because of his disappointment with his third son, Francis, who preferred life at sea to the place his father had found for him in chancery. He possessed property in Lincolnshire, Suffolk, Dorset, London, and Essex. Bridget Bowes died in 1706. Their son Martin married Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Edward Thurland of Reigate, Surrey, and afterwards settled at Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, where he died in 1726, and their second daughter, Anne, became in 1732 the wife of Philip Broke MP, of Nacton, Suffolk.<br>
