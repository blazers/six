<span class="headword">Bernstorff,  Andreas Gottlieb  von</span>, Baron Bernstorff in the nobility of the Holy Roman empire  (1649&#150;1726), <span class="occ">politician and diplomat</span>, was born on 2 March 1649 <span class="smallcap">NS</span> in Ratzeburg, then in the duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg, in northern Germany, the second son of Andreas von Bernstorff (1604&#150;1655), a canon of Ratzeburg Cathedral and courtier in Wolfenb&uuml;ttel, and his wife, Anna Elisabeth, the daughter of Detleff von B&uuml;low, the last dean of Ratzeburg. The marriage produced nine children; only Bernstorff, his elder brother Christian Rudolph (1645&#150;1664), two younger brothers, and a younger sister survived beyond infancy. Bernstorff was sent to the <i>Gymnasium</i> in G&ouml;ttingen in 1662 with his elder brother, where he remained until his brother's death in 1664, at which point he succeeded to the headship of the family and to its estates in Mecklenburg. In spring 1665 Bernstorff went to the University of Helmstedt, where he studied law. Bernstorff left Helmstedt in 1668 and spent a year learning about the practice of imperial law at the imperial chamber court (the high court of the Holy Roman empire) in Speyer; there he was supervised by an uncle who was a jurist. Bernstorff travelled widely in Europe between 1669 and 1670, visiting Paris, Rome, and Vienna.<br>
<br>Late in 1671 Bernstorff entered the service of Christian I, duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, where he acted as an adviser to the duke's new wife, Elisabeth Angelique de Montmorency. The duke and duchess's marriage deteriorated rapidly and Bernstorff was dismissed early in 1673. He entered the service of Georg Wilhelm of Brunswick-L&uuml;neburg, duke of Celle, whom he had encountered on previous diplomatic missions and who belonged to the same dynasty as his father's former employer at Wolfenb&uuml;ttel. Bernstorff was sent to both Kassel and Heidelberg on diplomatic missions and accompanied Georg Wilhelm on campaign against Louis XIV.<br>
<br>In November 1675 Bernstorff returned to Celle and married Johannette Lucie von Sinold (1653&#150;1706), the daughter of Johann Helwig von Sinold (called von Sch&uuml;tz) and his wife, Anna Barbara, <i>n&eacute;e</i> von Fabricus. Bernstorff's new father-in-law was chancellor of Celle and effectively Georg Wilhelm's chief minister. When his father-in-law died in June 1677, Bernstorff took over his official position and duties. Bernstorff was closely involved in the marriage negotiations for Georg Wilhelm's only daughter, Sophia Dorothea, and her cousin Georg Ludwig, the eldest son of Ernst August, duke of Calenberg (Hanover), later George I, king of Great Britain. This union offered the prospect of reuniting all the territories of the junior branch of the house of Brunswick.<br>
<br>Bernstorff's opposition to the growth of Louis XIV's power was clear from his resistance to French attempts to gain north German allies in the 1680s. In May 1688 Hans Willem Bentinck, later earl of Portland, visited Celle to seek Georg Wilhelm's support, should his master, William of Orange, stadholder of the United Provinces of the Netherlands, decide to intervene militarily in Britain against its Catholic and pro-French king, James II and VII. Georg Wilhelm and Bernstorff were willing to allow troops from Celle to be used in the defence of the United Provinces to replace any Dutch forces deployed across the channel. William himself visited Celle in August 1688, three months before his successful invasion of England. Bernstorff, like many of his generation, regarded William's intervention as crucial for tipping the European balance of power against France.<br>
<br>During the Nine Years' War Bernstorff ensured that Celle sided with William III against Louis XIV. He established a strong working relationship with William, whom he saw in the Low Countries in 1691. Bernstorff's expertise in European affairs was supported by an extensive network of informants in other courts; both helped contribute towards the strengthening of the alliance against Louis XIV. Bernstorff was also keenly interested in preserving the protestant succession to the British thrones. Not only would the restoration of James II and VII upset the balance of power in France's favour, but as a servant of the duke of Celle, Bernstorff was also anxious that the senior protestant heir, Sophia of the Palatinate (married to Georg Wilhelm's brother Ernst August of Calenberg), should be guaranteed the succession in Britain if William, his wife, Mary II, and her sister Anne left no descendants. However, Ernst August's determination to remain neutral in the Nine Years' War hampered Bernstorff's efforts to secure north Germany for the alliance. Ernst August was seeking recognition for Calenberg as the ninth electorate of the Holy Roman empire and believed that French support was vital to the achievement of this aim. Through agreements in 1691 Bernstorff ensured that Celle supported Ernst August's campaign to gain the electoral hat (achieved in December 1692) in return for Ernst August breaking his links with France and committing troops to the war against Louis XIV.<br>
<br>In 1694 Bernstorff purchased the estate of Gartow from Georg Wilhelm. The purchase was to prove a point of contention between Bernstorff and the elector of Brandenburg (king of Prussia from 1701), who laid claim to the territory. The general hostility that Bernstorff would later display towards Prussia is probably attributable in part to this personal dispute.<br>
<br>Bernstorff met William III again in London in 1696, and was closely involved in the negotiations at Celle in 1698 between William III and Georg Wilhelm, which in part dealt with the question of the British succession. William III was accompanied by John Robethon, his private secretary. Bernstorff's diplomacy was rewarded by the <span class="roman">Act of Settlement</span> of 1701, which named Sophia as heir presumptive to the English throne; the provision was extended to the whole of Great Britain by the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> of 1707 between England and Scotland. In contrast to Sophia and her adviser, the philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernstorff was concerned not to interfere too much in British domestic politics, as he was cautious of endangering the Hanoverian succession.<br>
<br>Georg Wilhelm died in 1705. Bernstorff, joined by Robethon who had been in the service of Celle since William III's death in 1702, entered the service of Georg Ludwig, son of Sophia and Ernst August, who had been elector of Hanover since Ernst August's death in 1698, and now inherited Celle as well. Bernstorff was preparing to move from Celle to Hanover when his wife died in January 1706. In the course of their marriage she had given birth to four daughters and five sons. Of these, only the daughters and one son survived infancy. In September 1706 Bernstorff's son and heir, Andreas August, also died. Bernstorff subsequently made his son-in-law and cousin Joachim Engelcke von Bernstorff, who had married his second daughter, Charlotte Sophie, his heir.<br>
<br>Bernstorff's influence grew rapidly in Hanover. The death of Franz Ernst, Count Platen, in 1709 made Bernstorff officially the most senior Hanoverian minister but this merely confirmed the existing situation. Hanover was an active member of the grand alliance against Louis XIV in the War of the Spanish Succession. Relations with Anne and the ministry of Marlborough and Godolphin had been good. However, the 1710 general election allowed Anne to appoint a tory ministry keen to make a separate peace, and relations with Hanover began to worsen. Bernstorff used Hans Kaspar von Bothmer to monitor the situation in London closely.<br>
<br>Bernstorff became George I's chief German minister in London in 1714. He had established relationships with some leading whigs, especially with William, Baron Cowper, and his wife, Mary; the intelligence and opinions he gathered may have helped shape George I's preference for an administration where whig postholders were in a majority. Bernstorff, along with Bothmer, Robethon, the new king's German mistress Melusine von der Schulenburg, and his half-sister Sophia Charlotte von Kielmansegg, were mistrusted for their influence. Particular concern was expressed about the control that &#145;the old baron&#146;, as Bernstorff was known, wielded over patronage. After the unhappy experience of William III and his Dutch favourites, British ministers were keen to ensure that control over British patronage remained in British hands. Among the ministers, Charles, second Viscount Townshend, and Robert Walpole also complained that &#145;the Germans&#146; were exploiting their proximity to the king to line their own pockets.<br>
<br>Bernstorff's foreign policy was designed to ensure Hanoverian security and to facilitate territorial expansion, where possible. The decline of Sweden in the latter years of the Great Northern War (clear to observers by 1714) offered the prospect of gaining territory in northern Germany at Swedish expense. Sweden's other enemies wanted British naval support in the Baltic, and Bernstorff was happy to oblige. This led to claims that British resources were being misused to support Hanoverian ends, and that Bernstorff was protecting his estates in Mecklenburg from the encroaching armies of Peter the Great. Mistrust of German influence was one reason behind the whig split of 1717, which saw Townshend and Walpole leave the government. Townshend, Walpole, and their allies attacked Bernstorff and their former colleagues vigorously in parliament. Evidence cited by Ragnhild Hatton suggests that Bernstorff attempted to mediate between Townshend and Walpole and the king, but these efforts were unsuccessful in an atmosphere where one MP, Heneage Finch, Lord Guernsey, could tell the Commons in April 1717 that it was a pity that Britain was governed by a &#145;Mecklenburg squire&#146;  (Hatton, 202).<br>
<br>Between 1716 and 1719 Bernstorff and George's British secretary of state James, first Earl Stanhope, were both involved in schemes to bring peace to southern and northern Europe. Bernstorff was a strong supporter of the Vienna alliance of January 1719, negotiated by Saint-Saphorin, which aimed to unite Hanover, Austria, and Saxony to prevent either Prussian or Russian expansion into Poland. An alliance with Austria and Saxony also reduced the threat to Hanover. Bernstorff's anti-Prussian views played a part here but how far this led to a break between the king, Stanhope, and himself is unclear. Stanhope's and Bernstorff's peace plans diverged, with Stanhope favouring closer co-operation with France and Prussia, as opposed to Austria. More generally Stanhope's vision was broader than the predominantly north German concerns of Bernstorff, and this caused tension between them. When George I returned to London from Hanover in October 1721, Bernstorff remained in Germany. The view that he had been disgraced does not bear scrutiny&#151;he continued to correspond with leading political figures and was treated with respect when George visited Hanover again in 1723. Bernstorff resigned his Hanoverian ministerial post in 1723. He died, after a short illness, on his estates at Gartow on 6 July 1726.<br>
