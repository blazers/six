<span class="headword">Peterson, Sir  William</span>  (1856&#150;1921), <span class="occ">classical scholar and educationist</span>, the fifth son of John Peterson, a merchant of Leith, and his wife, Grace Montford, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Anderson, was born in Edinburgh on 29 May 1856. He was educated at the high school there and the University of Edinburgh; graduating in 1875, he went with a travelling fellowship to G&ouml;ttingen in Germany; in 1876 he entered Corpus Christi College, Oxford, as Ferguson scholar, graduating in 1879. From 1879 to 1882 he was assistant professor of the humanities at Edinburgh, and from 1882 to 1895 first principal of the newly founded University College, Dundee. Successful as an administrator, he secured excellent terms for his institution in the long negotiations leading to union with the University of St Andrews. He also continued his classical studies, editing book x of Quintilian's <span class="italic">Institutio oratoria</span> (1891), the <span class="italic">Dialogus de oratoribus</span> of Tacitus (1893), and Cicero's <span class="italic">Pro Cluentio</span> (1895). Peterson married in 1885 Lisa Gibb, eldest daughter of William Ross, shipowner, of Glenearn, Perthshire; they had two sons, the younger of whom was the diplomatist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35489/', "Sir Maurice Drummond Peterson")</script>.<br>
<br>In May 1895 Peterson was appointed principal of McGill University, Montreal, Canada, in succession to Sir William Dawson. There his talent as administrator had ample scope. He found a group of largely autonomous schools and transformed it into a university. He won the confidence of the wealthy men of Montreal&#151;especially Lord Strathcona and Sir William Macdonald (1831&#150;1917), the head of the Canadian tobacco industry&#151;and obtained from them buildings and endowments, especially for agriculture, applied science, and medicine. Faculties of law, medicine, commerce, education, and social service were added to the university; but Peterson's constant endeavours to strengthen the faculty of arts found less sympathy in a great commercial city.<br>
<br>As principal of McGill, Peterson continued his own classical studies and publications. In 1901 he discovered in the library of Holkham Hall a ninth-century manuscript (formerly belonging to Cluny) of Cicero's speeches; and in 1907 he produced an edition of the <span class="italic">Verrines</span>, based on this text. He also took an active part in educational work in Quebec, and throughout Canada and the United States, and was a very distinct personality among North American university presidents. He was for some years chairman of the protestant committee of the council of public instruction in Quebec, and a most influential trustee, and for a time chairman, of the Carnegie foundation for the advancement of teaching. He received many honorary degrees, and in 1915 was made KCMG. In politics he was an imperialist, and in his later years spoke and wrote much in favour of the continued and closer connection between Canada and Great Britain. Though devoted to McGill and to Canada, Peterson always remained half-Scot, half-cosmopolitan. He could show a salutary hauteur on occasion, and he did not suffer fools gladly, but he had also great personal charm and distinction.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Peterson spoke and worked unceasingly, and on 12 January 1919, while presiding at a meeting on behalf of the dependants of dead or disabled Scottish soldiers and sailors, he was stricken with paralysis. In May he resigned, and returned to England; he died in London at his home, Wildwood, North End, Hampstead, on 4 January 1921, his wife surviving him.<br>
