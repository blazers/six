<span class="headword">Oxenden, Sir  George</span>  (1620&#150;1669), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was the third son of Sir James Oxenden of Dene, Kent, and Margaret, daughter of Thomas Nevinson of Eastry, Kent. He was baptized at Wingham, Kent, on 6 April 1620. His older brother was Sir Henry Oxenden, first baronet (1614&#150;1686), and his nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21051/', "George Oxenden (bap. 1651, d. 1703)")</script>, was a notable lawyer and politician. In 1632 he went to India in attendance upon the Revd Arthur Hatch of Wingham. During the following six years he became fluent in the languages used in north-western India and made himself invaluable, mostly at Ahmadabad, to the East India Company's factors. In their letter to the company (4 January 1639) the president and council at Surat praised the young man's activities and his character and recommended him to the directors for more formal and better-paid employment in the company.<br>
<br>In 1639 Oxenden returned to England, where the Surat council's recommendation for &#145;his civil carriage and expert knowledge of the Industan language&#146; resulted in his formal employment by the company as a factor for Surat on a salary of &pound;25 per year  (29 Jan 1641, Sainsbury and Foster, 2.137). Back in India between October 1641 and January 1653, he continued to demonstrate the linguistic and commercial skills which had so impressed his colleagues. He was entrusted with ventures to Goa, Cape Comorin, and Macau, but mostly to Mocha (Yemen). He also demonstrated a willingness to advocate strong measures against local rulers who attempted to expropriate the company's property, and a constant loyalty for the company's senior officers. These aspects of his character gained him a continuing respect and affection from indigenous merchants and governors and Englishmen alike, throughout his career in India.<br>
<br>In 1653 Oxenden returned to England. Between 1656 and January 1659 he pursued private stock ventures to the East, taking advantage of the East India Company's loss of its old monopoly (1654&#150;7). The ventures do not appear to have been very successful, and when offered the post of president at Surat, Oxenden accepted (25 October 1661). On 24 November 1661 he was knighted at Whitehall. His commission of employment (19 March 1662) described him as &#145;President and Cheife Director of all our affaires at Suratt and all other our factories in the north parts of India from Zeilon to the Redd Sea&#146;. Excluded from his control were Madras, Bengal, and Bantam, areas of which he had little experience. It was also thought that his responsibilities in north-western India would take all his time. His salary, &pound;300 plus a gratuity of &pound;200 per year, reflected his great experience and value to the company.<br>
<br>At the end of March 1662 Oxenden sailed for India, accompanied by the third earl of Marlborough and royal troops intending to take over the old Portuguese possession of Bombay, ceded to Charles II in his marriage settlement with Catherine of Braganza. He arrived at Surat on 18 September. At this time he focused his attention on re-establishing amicable relationships with local powers; trying to secure the release of Englishmen held captive by the Maratha chieftain Sivaji at Rairi; reorganizing the company's trade following the royal charter given to the East India Company; and suppressing private trading activities. Affairs at Bombay were in the hands of the crown's forces. When the Portuguese refused to surrender Bombay, causing great difficulties for the English personnel, Oxenden was forced to take a greater role, especially in supplying the dwindling numbers of men with provisions and shelter. This was made more difficult by the Mughal fears that Bombay would take trade from Surat, and their concern about armed foreigners landing in their dominions. Oxenden skilfully balanced the different contending demands and responsibilities.<br>
<br>Sivaji raided Surat on 6&#150;13 January 1664 and only the English and Dutch factories held out against him. The town itself was severely damaged and looted. The English actions gained the Mughal governor's gratitude and friendship, and the more tangible benefit of a reduction in the customs duties to which English trade had been liable at Surat. For the employees' heroism in protecting the company's substantial possessions the directors expressed their gratitude through a reward of &pound;200 and a gold medal worth &pound;20 for Oxenden, and various much smaller sums of money for other employees at Surat. These were not sent to India until 1668.<br>
<br>In 1665 Oxenden's attention was taken by consequences in India of the Second Anglo-Dutch War (March 1665&#150;July 1667); the transfer of Bombay to the English, and the reprehensible activities of the crown's personnel at Bombay in seizing Indian ships, causing retaliation by the Mughal governor at Surat; and the problems created by Sir Edward Winter's usurpation of the English settlement at Madras. He was also increasingly disturbed personally by the company's willingness to listen to accusations against him of trading privately outside the company's indulgence to him. In 1666 he asked the company to nominate his successor, so that he could return to England according to his contract (1 January 1666). His increasingly poor health, the difficulties in India, and the death of his sister Elizabeth (Dallison), who was also his agent in England, caused him to renew his request on 26 March 1667 to return to England.<br>
<br>This request caused the directors to state their appreciation of, and total support for, Oxenden's administration. The directors realized that they needed Oxenden's experience, abilities, and skills more than ever. The grant of letters patent making Bombay over to the East India Company (27 March 1668) removed the basis for the conflict between the two sets of English authorities in western India, and the directors asked Oxenden to stay in India to secure the company's authority at Bombay (dispatch to Surat, 27 March 1668).<br>
<br>Oxenden made his only visit to Bombay on 2&#150;29 January 1669, where he made clear his hopes for an orderly and efficient settlement under the company's administration. The commission appointing him &#145;Governor and Comander in Cheife of our port and island of Bombay&#146; was sent to India on 10 March 1669; it arrived at Bombay on 4 October 1669, after Oxenden had died. His long struggle with various debilitating illnesses succumbed to a consumptive disease at Surat on 14 July 1669. He was buried the following day in the English cemetery alongside his brother Christopher, who had died at Surat in February 1659. A large mausoleum was erected over their remains, probably by their nephews Streynsham Master and Henry Oxenden.<br>
<br>Reports of his death and funeral demonstrate clearly the high regard in which Oxenden was held among all the communities in Surat. The letter from the council at Surat to the company (26 November 1669) records that he<blockquote>departed this life the 14 July last, to your and our unvalluable loss and the unspeakable greife of the Governor and all the officers and merchants in Surat, among whome his language, wisdome, and obliging deportment hath rendered him highly honnoured. The next day he was enterred with all possible solemnity; the French Director and Dutch Comandore attending the corps on foot, with an incredible number of people, so universally was his loss apprehended by all. (Foster, 13.182)</blockquote>In England, despite all its protestations of appreciation, the company scrambled to audit Oxenden's accounts and liabilities for permitted trade, and only allowed Oxenden's estate to be finalized in July 1675.<br>
