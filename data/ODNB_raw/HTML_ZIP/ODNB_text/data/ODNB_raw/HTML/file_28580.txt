<span class="headword">Wallop, Sir  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1531&#150;1599), <span class="occ">administrator and member of parliament</span>, was born at Farleigh Wallop, Hampshire, the first son of Sir Oliver Wallop (<i>c</i>.1502&#150;1566), landowner, and his first wife, Bridget Pigott of Beachampton, Buckinghamshire. His father, an early protestant, served Hampshire as a justice of the peace from 1554 to 1564 and as sheriff in 1558. In 1547 Protector Somerset knighted him in Scotland. Because his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28581/', "Sir John Wallop (d. 1551)")</script>, a prominent Henrician courtier and diplomat, failed to produce an heir Sir Oliver inherited his large estates which passed to Henry Wallop upon the death of his father on 28 February 1566.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>When Henry Wallop was a youth, Sir John Wallop and Oliver Wallop negotiated a marriage contract with Sir Thomas Wriothesley for a union between his daughter Anne and Henry. That agreement was cancelled on 29 August 1545 for unstated but possibly religious reasons. Henry later married Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1599), daughter of Richard Gifford of King's Somborne, Hampshire, a prominent early protestant in the county. Otherwise his early years were uneventful. It was not until Elizabeth I's reign began that he became active in local government. Appointed a JP in 1558, he continued to hold that office until at least 1594. Bishop Robert Horne of Winchester in 1564 listed both Henry and his father as favourers of the protestant religion.<br>
<br>When Sir Oliver Wallop died Henry became one of the largest landowners in Hampshire. Two months later Sir John Mason, Hampshire's senior knight of the shire, died on 21 April 1566, setting the stage for Wallop's first foray into politics. By September the government had decided to recall parliament, which necessitated a by-election for Mason's seat. The next few weeks were filled with convoluted manoeuvring by the rival factions associated with Bishop Horne and the lord treasurer, William Paulet. By election day on 4 November, Horne and a tightly knit group of protestants had picked Wallop as their candidate, while the Paulet faction had decided on the lord treasurer's grandson Sir John Berkeley. In a closely contested election Wallop lost, causing his friends to accuse the sheriff, Sir Richard Pexsall, of misusing his position. A series of fruitless suits and counter-suits followed in Star Chamber.<br>
<br>The defeat did not affect Wallop's developing career. In 1569 Queen Elizabeth knighted him at Basing, Hampshire. He had also established a residence in Southampton and became a freeman of the town in 1572. That same year the town elected him as one of their burgesses. While in parliament Wallop served on committees for legal matters, weapons, port bills, cloth bills, wine, church discipline, and wharves, all things of interest to a protestant member of the gentry and a resident of Southampton. His hard work gained him a reputation for usefulness. Other local government offices came his way: he was a commissioner for musters in Hampshire in 1573, an ecclesiastical commissioner in 1575, and a commissioner for piracy in 1577. He also worked as a commissioner concerning grain exports out of Surrey and in that capacity revealed himself as a supporter of free trade, an unsurprising stand for a person who maintained his wealth by selling grain on the open market. In religious matters he became recognized as a staunch protestant. He also appears to have gained the favourable notice of Sir Francis Walsingham, the principal secretary of state. Unfortunately for Wallop, his hard work and efficiency were rewarded by an assignment to that great quagmire, Tudor Ireland.<h2>
<a name="ArrivalinIrelandandthesecondDesmondrebellion"></a>Arrival in Ireland and the second Desmond rebellion</h2>Walsingham approached Sir Henry in July 1579 about serving as under-treasurer of Ireland, a post that had just come open as a result of the death of Sir Edward Fitton. Wallop demurred, citing his lack of experience and money. He also requested time to settle his personal business before he could go to Ireland. While no time was especially auspicious for becoming an official in Tudor Ireland, the summer of 1579 was particularly bad as the second Desmond rebellion (1579&#150;83) was just breaking out in Munster. Walsingham ignored Wallop's excuses and ordered him to London in early August where he received his instructions which included command of a company of troops. Adverse winds delayed his sailing from Bristol but on 10 September he was finally able to depart, arriving at Waterford two days later.<br>
<br>Wallop's arrival in Ireland was not a happy one as his reports to Walsingham and Lord Burghley show. The &pound;10,000 he carried into Ireland was consumed with alarming rapidity. Military operations against the Irish were also ineffective as the insurgents had lost their fear of English troops, having acquired up-to-date weapons and tactics. The Irish also hated the English while favouring the Spanish. By 29 December 1579 Wallop could remark to Burghley that &#145;It is easier to talk at home of Irish wars than to be in them&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1574&#150;85</i>, 201). He also began to develop a great dislike for the victuallers supplying the English army, all of whom he considered to be bad. Meanwhile Lord Justice William Drury had sickened and, after a long illness, died on 3 October 1579. Wallop feared for his own life when he too became ill. In an effort to take care of his family he requested that in the event of his death Sir Francis Walsingham be granted the wardship of his son Henry. His hope was that Walsingham would marry one of his daughters to Wallop's son. Wallop also started to complain about having to spend significant amounts of his own money to fulfil his Irish duties. At the same time he recognized the possibilities for economic gain in Ireland. He began to plan an increase of grain farming in Ireland in November 1579 and sought licences to export that grain. By February 1580 he had planted 1000 acres of grain.<br>
<br>The strain of serving in Ireland was beginning to tell on Wallop by early 1580. From his point of view the government provided too little money which arrived consistently too late for the Irish officials effectively to fight the insurgents. His letters and reports to Walsingham and Burghley were filled with complaints and demands. Soon Burghley took exception to Wallop's tone and chided him for it, going on to offer suggestions on how he might write more diplomatically. After that exchange relations between the two men remained soured for years. Burghley viewed Wallop as a sensationalizing complainer while Wallop consistently worried, and rightly so, that Burghley disliked him. Walsingham ended up acting as a protector for Wallop and provided a sympathetic listener for his complaints.<br>
<br>The Desmond rebellion was a grim time in Ireland for Wallop. Although he could report on 1 March 1581 that his troops had killed more rebels than all the other bands in Ireland, he remained deeply pessimistic. Only two weeks later he expressed his doubts to Walsingham about the government ever being able to develop policies that would bring peace to Ireland, and he also expressed his wish to return to England. Increasingly his letters included requests to be relieved of his office along with complaints about harsh treatment by Burghley and even the queen. By 25 June 1585 he was considering turning over his office to the son of the sometime lord deputy Sir William Fitzwilliam. Instead Queen Elizabeth appointed Wallop and Archbishop Loftus joint lords justices of Ireland on 25 August 1582. They held that office until 21 June 1584, an added responsibility about which Wallop complained bitterly to Walsingham. Meanwhile Wallop struggled to make his accounts satisfactory for the royal auditors. The capture and execution of Desmond on 9 November 1583 ended the rebellion and eased the pressures on Wallop and the Irish government.<h2>
<a name="WallopandIrelandattitudesandpolicies"></a>Wallop and Ireland: attitudes and policies</h2>Wallop developed definite ideas on the proper way to pacify and govern Ireland. By January 1580 he was warning that the unsettled state of Ireland was consuming the queen's treasure and the lives of her soldiers with no end in sight. He also quickly became a firm opponent of co-opting Irish lords into the government as he did not feel that they could be trusted. The same observation applied to the practice of training and equipping native troops for use against rebels. By April 1581 he had come to think that such training should be forbidden because in every rebellion it was the Irish rebels possessed of English military training who always proved to be the most dangerous enemies. No admirer of Gaelic Irish people or culture, Wallop advocated the harsh expedient of putting rebels to the sword and planting better people in their stead. Such opinions reflected his typically protestant English world view and prejudices. Nothing that he experienced in Ireland during his almost twenty years of service caused him to alter his early opinions. He advocated a policy of assimilating&#151;or as he would have put it civilizing&#151;the Gaelic Irish and even the Old English settlers. For him, Ireland was a land of great economic promise. A strong economy would help to civilize the Irish, or rather it would turn them into Elizabethan English. Early on Wallop personally worked to increase Irish grain production. By 1585 he was suggesting the growing of woad as a way to develop an export commodity. If such development plans worked, everyone benefited, including Wallop.<br>
<br>The English government in Dublin was riven by animosities and factionalism. Resources were few while problems were myriad and the successful implementation of policies frequently proved elusive. Under such circumstances, recriminations and backbiting among government officials were inevitable. Wallop and Lord Deputy Sir John Perrot hated each other, but most people in the Irish government also hated Perrot. Wallop also disliked and distrusted Thomas Butler, tenth earl of Ormond, but that reflected his anti-Irish stance and he was not alone in his opinion. The royal auditor Thomas Jenyson was a particular <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i> of his, whom Wallop attempted to discredit by calling him a papist. In contrast Jenyson complained that Wallop kept sloppy accounts. There were occasional tiffs with other government officials such as Sir Edward Waterhouse, but overall Wallop worked well with his English colleagues and maintained relations of mutual respect.<h2>
<a name="LateryearsinIrelandandEngland"></a>Later years in Ireland and England</h2>Wallop happily participated in the plantation of Munster that followed the suppression of the Desmond rebellion, and established his own settlement at Enniscorthy, co. Wexford. Peace brought an end to his requests to be relieved of his office. But troubles with Lord Deputy Perrot, the auditing of Wallop's accounts, and petty outbreaks of violence among the Irish continued to keep Wallop busy. He also entered into long-drawn-out struggles to obtain possession of Athlone Castle and the lands of Adare Abbey in Ireland. Beginning in 1586 he sought permission to return to England so that he could handle his personal business there. Initially refused, he obtained such permission in 1587 but the treason of Sir William Stanley that year and the Armada threat of the following year kept him in Ireland. He personally interrogated a number of Armada survivors and showed himself to be both astute and compassionate. Finally, in April 1589, he sailed for England, where he stayed until July 1595 while a deputy performed his duties in Ireland. As early as August 1592 Wallop's long absence aroused the complaint of the royal auditor Christopher Peyton, who had to travel to Wallop's Hampshire home to clear his accounts. But it was not until 19 July 1595 that Wallop returned to Ireland to serve as treasurer-at-war just as the Nine Years' War (1594&#150;1603) was starting to take an ominous turn. He was soon predicting that it would be a long and expensive war. Always an advocate of doing things properly, Wallop called upon the government to provide adequate resources to support the troops in Ireland. All that suggestion earned him was a scolding from Burghley on behalf of the parsimonious queen.<br>
<br>Wallop's final years in Ireland were unhappy as the English position deteriorated. During January 1596 he and Sir Robert Gardiner conducted negotiations with the earl of Tyrone. The earl drove a tough bargain but the agreement resulted in an extension of the peace for a much needed three months. Unfortunately Queen Elizabeth took exception to the obsequious and overly friendly tone that Wallop and Gardiner took with Tyrone. Her royal censure hurt Wallop deeply. In July 1597 Wallop proposed equipping the English army in Ireland with Irish-style clothing, a practical suggestion that was greeted with derision and cynicism. Lord Burghley accused Wallop of seeking his own personal enrichment. This setback came in the midst of Wallop's ongoing struggle to refute charges of peculation that had first surfaced in October 1596 and were still plaguing him a year later. Offended yet again, he attempted to resign but the government in London would not hear of it. They needed his experience and ability. By 22 February 1598 the ageing and ill Wallop was so desperate that he was threatening to leave his post and return to England without licence. It did no good. Meanwhile his son Oliver was brutally killed in a skirmish with some Irish rebels which added to Wallop's misery. Finally in March 1599 the queen agreed to replace Wallop as treasurer with Sir George Carey but ordered Wallop to stay on in Ireland and advise Carey for an unspecified period of time. Sadly Wallop died in Dublin on 14 April 1599, the day Carey reached Ireland. He was buried in St Patrick's, Dublin. His wife, Katherine, died soon after, on 16 July, and was buried alongside him with their son Oliver. He was succeeded by his only surviving son, Henry (1568&#150;1642), who married Elizabeth Corbet of Shropshire and was elected to parliament many times.<br>
<br>The elder Sir Henry Wallop was a typical middle-ranking Tudor official, efficient and conscientious but also continually looking to his own personal advantage. His attitudes toward the Irish were also characteristic of protestant Elizabethan England&#151;conquest followed by assimilation or extermination of the native population.<br>
