<span class="headword">Balliol <span class="st"> [Baliol]</span>,  Henry  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1246), <span class="occ">nobleman and administrator</span>, was the youngest brother of Hugh de Balliol (<i>d</i>. 1229) of Barnard Castle; together with another of his elder brothers, Ingelram or Ingram (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1244), he was the first of his family to acquire lands and interests in Scotland. These interests came through marriage and drew him into Scottish royal service during the reign of Alexander II. He served as chamberlain of Scotland for two terms, from 1223 to 1230 and again from 1241 to his death in 1246, and occasionally acted as the king of Scots's representative or envoy to the English court. In 1237, for example, he was one of the sureties sworn to keep the terms of the treaty of York on behalf of Alexander II, and in 1244 was one of the four barons who swore by Alexander's soul to observe his promise of non-hostility to England. Henry's identity and career are, however, often confused with a Nottinghamshire baron of the same name, active in the reign of King John, and with his own nephew and nephew's son in the Inverkeilor&#150;Urr branch of the family.<br>
<br>Balliol's wife, Lora, whom he had married by 1233, was eldest daughter and coheir of William de Valognes, through whom Henry succeeded to a share of the extensive Valognes estates in England and Scotland, including those subsequently inherited from Lora's cousin, Christiana, countess of Essex. His holdings came to be centred on the baronies of Benington (Hertfordshire) and Cavers (Roxburghshire). The office of chamberlain of Scotland may have been associated, though not strictly hereditably, with tenure of the lordship of Cavers, which had originally been Scottish royal demesne. William de Valognes, and his father, Philip, before him, had both been chamberlains, while Henry's second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1203/', "Alexander de Balliol")</script>, later served in this capacity for the guardians and for his cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1209/', "John, king of Scots")</script>. Henry de Balliol died shortly before 15 October 1246 and, also like his Valognes predecessors, he received the signal honour of burial in the chapter house of Melrose Abbey, where certainly his daughter Ada, and possibly also his widow, who died before April 1272, were interred. In addition to Alexander and Ada, Henry's children included another daughter, Lora, who married Gilbert de Gaunt (or Gant), and two other sons. Guy de Balliol, his eldest son, was killed fighting on the baronial side at Evesham in 1265, and William de Balliol, his third son, became a clerk, later working as agent for his brother, Alexander, when the latter was chamberlain of Scotland.<br>
