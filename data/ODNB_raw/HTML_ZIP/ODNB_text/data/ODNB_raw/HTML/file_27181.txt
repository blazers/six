<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thicknesse,  Philip</span>  (1719&#150;1792), <span class="occ">travel writer</span>, born at Farthingoe, Northamptonshire, on 10 August 1719, was the seventh son (there were also two daughters) of John Thicknesse (<i>c</i>.1670&#150;1725), rector of Farthingoe, and grandson of Ralph Thicknesse of Balterley Hall, Staffordshire. His mother, Joyce Blencowe, was niece of Sir John Blencowe, justice of the common pleas and baron of the exchequer. Of the seven sons, three died in infancy. The surviving four all achieved positions of some influence: Thomas (1706&#150;1742) was a clergyman, a Whitehall preacher, and a candidate for the provostship of King's College, Cambridge, in January 1742; Ralph (1709&#150;1742) was an assistant at Eton College and published an edition of <span class="italic">Phaedrus, with English Notes</span> in 1741, but died suddenly while playing the violin at Bath; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27180/', "George Thicknesse (bap. 1714, d. 1790)")</script> was, successively, chaplain, surmaster, and high master of St Paul's School.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlytravels"></a>Education and early travels</h2>Philip was placed at Aynhoe School after the death of his father in 1725, but soon moved with his mother to London, where he became a gratis scholar at Westminster School through the kindly intervention of the headmaster, Dr Robert Friend, whose family were neighbours of the Thicknesses in Northamptonshire. However, Thicknesse was very unhappy at Westminster, and repeated truancy led to his removal from the school. He was then apprenticed to Marmaduke Tisdale, a London apothecary, but left fairly rapidly after becoming too fond of Tisdale's choicest cordials. Thicknesse had read an account of Georgia by General James Oglethorpe, and&#151;aged only sixteen&#151;contrived to join the general, with a group of Scots and German emigrants as well as the Wesley brothers, on board the <i>Simmonds</i> and the <i>London Merchant</i>, which set sail for America on 20 October 1735. They reached Savannah on 2 February 1736. Despite building himself a wooden cabin on an island in a creek, and living &#145;a true Robinson Crusoe line of life&#146;  (Thicknesse, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 31), Thicknesse abandoned life in Georgia after seeing a vision of his mother while playing the flute on the banks of the creek, and sailed back to England in 1737. He was then given a job in the offices of the Georgia colonists in Old Palace Yard, but was soon dismissed for giving too frank an account of settler life. He failed to obtain a commission in Oglethorpe's projected Georgia regiment, probably because of his tactlessness, but Sir Robert Walpole helped procure him a commission as captain in an independent company at Jamaica. There, he was involved in British attempts to quell the guerrilla activities of runaway slaves in the mountains, and encountered many hair-raising ambushes and near-fatal skirmishes. While in Jamaica he formulated his lifelong conviction that slavery, provided it involved humane treatment of the slaves, was a natural state of affairs.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoEnglandandfirstmarriage"></a>Return to England and first marriage</h2>Probably because he had fallen out with his fellow officers, Thicknesse applied for a six-month leave of absence from Jamaica and returned to London at the end of 1740. Through the good offices of Thomas Townshend (a scholar of King's College, Cambridge, where Philip's brother Thomas was then a fellow), he was appointed captain-lieutenant in a marine foot regiment with headquarters at Southampton. He soon became embroiled in a tavern brawl followed by a duel with another former Jamaica officer who publicly accused Thicknesse of having fled from the enemy slaves. Also while stationed at Southampton, Thicknesse met Maria Lanove (<i>d</i>. 1749), daughter of a prosperous Huguenot refugee and heir to &pound;40,000. In 1742 they eloped and married after he abducted her from a protective cohort of soldiers in Southampton High Street. Once she was pregnant, Thicknesse was appointed to the seventy-gun <i>Ipswich</i> under Admiral Medley, bound for Gibraltar. After a year in the Mediterranean, he returned to England on half pay. He fell out with his parents-in-law, and he and Maria moved to Bath. With time on his hands, Thicknesse threw himself into the social whirl of Bath, and began to enjoy gambling. However, early in 1749 Maria and their children (by now numbering three) contracted a type of diphtheria; she and two of the children died, leaving only one surviving daughter, Anna. Maria's parents died shortly thereafter, her father in his sleep, her mother by hurling herself out of a window onto some iron railings at the very spot in Southampton High Street where Thicknesse had abducted Maria. Thicknesse spent much of the rest of his life in a fruitless attempt (involving an unsuccessful appeal to the House of Lords) to get hold of the fortune to which he believed himself entitled by this unfortunate sequence of events. In the meantime, he did inherit &pound;5000 on his father-in-law's death. A distant relative, Captain Rigg, took Thicknesse and his daughter to live with him in Queen Square, Bath. It was at this time in his life that Thicknesse began to suffer from gallstones and to assuage the pain through the liberal use of laudanum, to which he was thereafter addicted, and the praises of which he was always eager to sing, in person and in print. He especially recommended it to men over fifty, whom he urged to take ten to twenty drops of strong laudanum daily. No doubt Thicknesse's own addiction exacerbated his quarrelsome tendencies.<h2>
<a name="Secondmarriageandfurtherquarrels"></a>Second marriage and further quarrels</h2>A widower for less than a year, Thicknesse married on 10 November 1749 Lady Elizabeth Touchet (1725&#150;1762), eldest daughter and heir of Lord Audley, the sixth earl of Castlehaven. Her father, whose family were long-standing Roman Catholics, raised strong objections to the marriage, but she nevertheless brought a dowry of &pound;5000. With &pound;1200 of this, Thicknesse in February 1753 bought the lieutenant-governorship of Landguard Fort in Suffolk, built by Charles I in 1628 at the mouth of Harwich harbour. At Landguard, Thicknesse soon became involved in wrangles about authority and precedence with various local notables and military personnel. In 1762 he began a long feud with Colonel Vernon of the Suffolk militia, later Lord Orwell. Thicknesse purchased a printing press and produced broadsheets designed to sabotage Lord Orwell's election hopes, which were distributed in Ipswich. The final straw came when Thicknesse made Lord Orwell the mocking present of a cannon-shaped piece of flotsam. Following the infamous &#145;affair of the wooden gun&#146;, Thicknesse was tried at Bury St Edmunds for libel in March 1763. Found guilty, he spent three months in the king's bench prison (where he made many friends), was fined &pound;100, and had to provide security in the form of two friends for &pound;500 each and &pound;1000 himself, to guarantee that he would keep the peace for seven years. Amazingly, he was allowed to resume command of Landguard Fort on his release, even though he had also, as part of his campaign against Lord Orwell, attempted to blackmail Lord Bute into supporting him, by threatening to publish some papers of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (Bute's late mother-in-law). These endeavours are inaccurately represented in <span class="italic">A Narrative of what Passed between General Sir Harry Erskine and Philip Thicknesse, Esq.</span> (1766).<h2>
<a name="ThirdmarriageandvisittoFrance"></a>Third marriage and visit to France</h2>The feud with Lord Orwell was contemporaneous with turbulent events in Thicknesse's personal life: in late March 1762 his wife Elizabeth died, having given birth to a baby boy on 29 June 1760. She had been attended in her delivery and long illness by a close friend, Ann Ford (1737&#150;1824) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27179/', "Thicknesse, Ann")</script>], an accomplished singer and viola da gamba player, who had been involved in a scandalous affair with the aged earl of Jersey in 1761. She and Thicknesse married on 27 September 1762. Their marriage was to last until his death thirty years later. Philip and Elizabeth had produced six children, two of whom died in infancy. The survivors were two girls and two boys. There is confusion over the names of the surviving girls: Charlotte (<i>b</i>. 1751) certainly survived, since Thicknesse recalls (in <span class="italic">A Year's Journey</span>, 1777) having placed her in a convent. One of the other two, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1750) or Joyce (<i>b</i>. 1753), also survived. Elizabeth's surviving sons were George (1757&#150;1818), later Lord Audley, baron of Castlehaven, and Philip (<i>b</i>. 1760). In 1784, following a very public feud with his father, George assumed the surname of Touchet.<br>
<br>While he and his third wife remained at Landguard, Thicknesse continued to embellish the whimsical Felixstowe Cottage, a former fisherman's hut a few miles from Landguard, where they spent the summer months. (An account of the cottage, with a print claiming to be &#145;copied from one of the earliest Productions of Gainsborough&#146;, was published in the <span class="italic">Harwich Guide</span> in 1808, and reprinted in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> in November 1809.) Eventually tiring of the project, Thicknesse sold the cottage to Lady Dowager Bateman for &pound;400 and took his family to France in April 1766. There he deposited Charlotte (Elizabeth, according to Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 9.261) in the convent at Ardres, where she seems to have spent the rest of her life, and had her looks ruined by smallpox. Thicknesse published an account of the French journey, entitled <span class="italic">Observations on the Customs and Manners of the French Nation</span> (1766), much of which takes issue with Smollett's hostile account of France and the French in <span class="italic">Travels through France and Italy</span> (1766). Thicknesse relates suggestively that &#145;an English lady of fashion who resides here [Paris], to whom I lent Smollet's Travels, says, he certainly lodged at ale-houses, and conversed with the lowest class of mechanics that frequent such houses&#146;  (Thicknesse, <span class="italic">Observations</span>, 91). Capitalizing fully on his trip, Thicknesse also published in 1768 <span class="italic">Useful Hints to those who Make the Tour of France</span>, which contains more attacks on Smollett.<br>
<br>On their return to Britain the Thicknesses lived briefly at Quoit, Monmouthshire, where Ann had inherited a small estate. Thicknesse erected a monument to John Wilkes on a mountain there, before they sold up and moved in 1768 to the livelier environment of Bath, &#145;to complete the education of his children&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 9.262). Thicknesse bought a house in the fashionable Crescent and hobnobbed with the leading lights of Bath society. He befriended but then antagonized the comic playwright Samuel Foote, who ridiculed Thicknesse as &#145;Dr Viper&#146; in his play <span class="italic">The Capuchin</span> (1776), a rewriting of Foote's earlier <span class="italic">A Trip to Calais</span> (1775). The name stuck and was used by Thicknesse's enemies, such as James Makittrick Adair, in the years that followed. Thicknesse was also mocked as the character of Graham in Richard Graves's satirical novel <span class="italic">The Spiritual Quixote</span> (1773). In 1774 Thicknesse sold the house in the Crescent for &pound;2000, and based the family at his cottage at Bathampton, which he extended and landscaped in eccentric style, constructing a hermit's grotto in the garden and making ornamental use of ancient skeletons dug up on the plot.<h2>
<a name="Continentalvisittravelwritingsandquarrels"></a>Continental visit, travel writings, and quarrels</h2>On the final collapse of his hopes of inheriting a substantial legacy from his first wife's mother (the House of Lords threw out his case in 1775), Thicknesse once again took his family (now comprising eight children) to the continent, spending most of the year 1776 abroad, and leaving his two youngest daughters (aged ten and thirteen) in a convent to complete their education. The travellers excited much attention in France and Spain, since their pet monkey, Jacko, insisted on riding postilion, dressed in a red jacket and boots. The family were made especially welcome by the monks at the hermitages and convent of Montserrat, where they also enjoyed the botanical richness of the landscape: Thicknesse later put the earl of Coventry in touch with P&egrave;re Pascal, one of the monks, which led to another public quarrel once Thicknesse discovered that P&egrave;re Pascal had sent the earl numerous botanical samples for which he remained unremunerated. Thicknesse produced an account of the trip in <span class="italic">A Year's Journey through France, and Part of Spain</span> (2 vols., 1777). It was a lucrative venture, securing an advance of &pound;580 and boasting a subscription list of 430 worthies, including the duchess of Cumberland, Henry Pelham, David Garrick, and Thomas Gainsborough. Samuel Johnson pronounced it &#145;entertaining&#146;  (Boswell, 3.235). It is a saner and more sentimental travelogue than his earlier exercises in the genre.<br>
<br>Having returned to Bathampton, Thicknesse continued to work on the cottage (renamed the Hermitage of St Catherine in honour of Montserrat), such that it became a popular tourist attraction for people visiting Bath. A monument to Chatterton (the first in Britain) became the garden's centrepiece in 1784, and gained a further gruesome interest after Thicknesse buried his eldest daughter Anna underneath it, &#145;as she was virtuous, dutiful, and not void of some genius&#146;  (Thicknesse, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 407). In 1778 Thicknesse published <span class="italic">The New Prose Bath Guide</span>, containing a wealth of practical information on household management and leisure pursuits at Bath: and in 1780 <span class="italic">The Valetudinarian's Bath Guide, or, The Means of Obtaining Long Life and Health</span>, in which he recommends not only the Bath waters and &#145;Wine, and Drinking to excess&#146;  (Thicknesse, <span class="italic">Valetudinarian</span>, 45), but also frequent inhalation of &#145;the breath of young women&#146;  (ibid., 18) as conducive to long life and good health. This recipe earned him a few lines of mockery in Thomas Mathias's satirical poem <span class="italic">The Pursuits of Literature</span> in 1794 (lines 167&#150;70). In 1784 Thicknesse published <span class="italic">A Year's Journey through the Pais Bas, and the Austrian Netherlands</span>, describing a rather quarrel-ridden tour performed during the preceding months. Also during the early 1780s he consolidated his enmity with James Makittrick Adair, a Bath physician with whom he traded accusations of quackery; and contrived to fall out with Thomas Gainsborough after thirty years of friendship. Thicknesse has a fair claim to have &#145;discovered&#146; Gainsborough in 1754, recognizing his talents as a local painter in Suffolk, and encouraging him to move to Bath, where he first became a successful portrait painter. In 1788 he published <span class="italic">A Sketch of the Life and Paintings of Thomas Gainsborough</span>, much of which describes their trivial quarrel (over an unfinished portrait and a viola da gamba).<h2>
<a name="Memoirs"></a>Memoirs</h2>By this time Thicknesse had fallen out with his two sons from his second marriage, not least because they had recently inherited fortunes from the earl of Castlehaven. The younger, Philip, bought the Hermitage from his father, who later tried unscrupulously to swindle and defame him over the transaction. Young Philip also made an unfortunate marriage to a Bath milliner, a Miss Peacock. Meanwhile, his brother Lord Audley seduced and ruined a Miss Walkins at Bristol, who died in 1780. In 1782 Thicknesse published a bitter pamphlet denouncing his son entitled <span class="italic">Queries to Lord Audley</span>, and in the meandering and digressive <span class="italic">Memoirs and anecdotes of Philip Thicknesse, late governor of Landguard Fort, and unfortunately father to George Touchet, Baron Audley</span> (3 vols.; 2 vols. in 1788, vol. 3 in 1791), he more extensively berates both his &#145;wretched and undutiful sons&#146;  (Thicknesse, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 274). Volume 3, in which his vitriol is especially concentrated, is an extremely rare book since Lord Audley and Philip bought and destroyed all the copies they could find. Thicknesse inserted the following clause into his will, and published it in volume 3 of the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>: &#145;I leave my right hand, to be cut off after death, to my son, Lord Audley, and desire it may be sent him in hopes that such a sight may remind him of his duty to God, after having so long abandoned the duty he owed his Father who once affectionately loved him&#146;  (Gosse, 271).<br>
<br>Thicknesse's <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> attracted a great deal of attention. The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> commended its sensible approval of slavery  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1788). It prompted James Gillray (perhaps encouraged by a Captain Crookshanks with whom Thicknesse had, unsurprisingly, fallen out) to execute one of his more personally offensive cartoons, &#145;Lieutenant-Governor Gall-Stone Inspired by Alecto, or, The Birth of Minerva&#146;. The rather Goya-esque scene features Thicknesse surrounded by skeletons, demons, books, and manuscripts, symbolizing his obsessions, quarrels, addictions, and literary outrages. In 1790 his old antagonist Dr Adair published <span class="italic">Curious Facts and Anecdotes, not Contained in the Memoirs of Philip Thicknesse</span>, a vituperative satire on the &#145;duncical&#146;  (Adair, 34) activities and deranged feuds of the &#145;Censor General of Great Britain&#146;  (ibid., title-page). Adair alleges that Thicknesse &#145;sent a letter to a person and his wife with <i>human excrement</i>, insinuating that Dr Adair was the author of the epistle and the present&#146;  (ibid., 62). The <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> themselves are disarmingly frank about Thicknesse's opportunistic and often rather calculated showdowns. In the dedication he wrote:<blockquote>if &hellip; it be true, that I quarrel with three out of four of my friends, I find that turns up more profitable than living well with them. &hellip; I know not what I should have done to make both ends meet, in my old age, if it had not been for the <i>repeated kindnesses</i> of my enemies. &hellip; I can at any time muster ten or a dozen knaves and fools, who will put an hundred pounds or two into my pocket, merely by holding them up to public scorn. (Gosse, 274)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Finaljourney"></a>Final journey</h2>In 1789 Thicknesse published a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Junius Discovered</span>, in which he claimed (erroneously) to have identified the mysterious satirist as Horne Tooke. Also in this year he and Ann moved to Sandgate, near Hythe, where they converted a barn into a house with a spectacular view of the sea. However, Ann reports that &#145;the daily sight of the Continent soon became <i>infectious</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Harwich Guide</span>; reprinted <span class="italic">GM</span>, 1809, 1015), and, nothing daunted by the early stages of the French Revolution, they made a brief trip to Paris, from where Thicknesse sent lively accounts of political developments to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. After a brief return to England, they departed more wholeheartedly in 1792, planning to reside in Italy; but Thicknesse died of a seizure in the carriage just outside Boulogne, on 19 November 1792. Ann Thicknesse was arrested as a foreigner and confined in a convent for eighteen months until after Robespierre's execution. Thicknesse was buried in the protestant cemetery at Boulogne, where Ann erected a monument to his memory. It bears a plangent epitaph celebrating his &#145;eminent virtues&#146; and paying tribute to the &#145;memory of a man with whom she lived thirty years in perfect felicity&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 9.288). She lived until 1824.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>As a notorious public figure and as a private citizen, Thicknesse is an enigma. Capable of immuring his daughters in convents and quarrelling irreconcilably with his sons, he was also apparently adored by his three wives. Easily the most irascible individual within the arena of late eighteenth-century print culture, he was nevertheless celebrated by, among others, the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (to which he was a contributor of gossipy essays) as &#145;a man of probity and honour, whose heart and purse were always open to the unfortunate&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1792), and &#145;a man of great sensibility&#146;  (ibid., 1789). His twentieth-century biographer observes that &#145;to anyone who has made a close study of Philip Thicknesse, there come occasions when he can but marvel that nobody ever shot him or bludgeoned him to death&#146;  (Gosse, 214). His publications were varied and peculiar, testifying to his opportunistic exploitation of the literary market place. His travel accounts (their abuse of Smollett aside) are some of his more measured publications: casual treatises on man-midwifery, deciphering, gout, and fraudulent automatons exhibited by foreigners in London represent the more bizarre range of his interests. From the early 1760s he contributed gossip paragraphs to the <span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span> under the pen-name of A Wanderer, and to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> under the signature Polyxena. Many of his books were reviewed by the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span> (with which latter journal he conducted a long-standing feud), in whose pages he became something of a comic celebrity. Thicknesse may be considered one of the greatest self-publicists of the eighteenth century. A correspondent to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> in 1791 describes an encounter with him at a hotel in Boulogne, and remarks:<blockquote>(when he chose) he could shew himself the Gentleman, the Philosopher, and the Man of Letters; and for eccentricity of genius few stand superior to him: as a Traveller, he will be remembered by many in Spain as one of <i>monkey-driving</i> memory. (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1791)</blockquote>
