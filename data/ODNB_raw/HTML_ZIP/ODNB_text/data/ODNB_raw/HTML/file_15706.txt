<span class="headword">Knell,  Paul</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1666), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the son of Barnabas Knell (<i>d</i>. 1646), minister of Reculver in Kent from 1602, who was sequestered from the living by parliament in the year of his death. Paul Knell was admitted as sizar at Clare College, Cambridge, on 18 June 1632, graduating BA in 1636. Upon the outbreak of civil war he joined the royalist cause as chaplain to a regiment of cuirassiers, to whom he preached a sermon, &#145;The convoy of a Christian&#146;, in August 1643, during the siege of Gloucester. He later joined the king at Oxford, where he was incorporated DD at Oxford University on 21 January 1644 and where he preached &#145;A severe sentence against secure citizens&#146; at St Mary's on 17 March 1644.<br>
<br>After the end of the civil war in England, Knell lived a peripatetic and insecure life. He was cited for intrusion at the parish of St Dunstan's, Canterbury, in July 1647, and spent much of 1648 in London, where he was able to preach and publish. A sermon at Gray's Inn in April was published as <span class="italic">Israel and England Paralelled</span>, in which Knell defended both church and king, and attacked the &#145;silly schismaticall assembly&#146;  (Knell, <span class="italic">Israel and England</span>, 17). Another sermon, at St Peter Cornhill, was published as <span class="italic">The Life-Guard of a Loyall Christian</span>, in which he cast the king's opponents as the &#145;Devil's darlings&#146;  (Knell, <span class="italic">Life-Guard</span>, 2) and claimed that the institutions of neither church nor monarchy could be destroyed by the deaths of particular incumbents. His most famous sermon, however, was preached at St Peter Paul's Wharf in September 1648 and published as <span class="italic">A Looking-Glasse for Levellers</span>, in which Knell attacked the &#145;conspiracy of Levellers against our sovereign&#146;, and claimed that &#145;destruction is in their way, they are still opposing of treaties, the way of peace have they not known, like horse leaches, they never think they have blood enough&#146;  (Knell, <span class="italic">Looking-Glasse</span>, 13&#150;14). Thereafter, Knell may have been forced into exile. He later claimed to have preached a sermon, &#145;The Assumption of the Messiah&#146;, before Charles II at The Hague in May 1649. However, he soon returned to England, and helped to raise money for royalist ministers in Essex in 1650.<br>
<br>During the late 1650s Knell, like other Anglican divines, appears to have been able to minister unmolested in London. He settled in the parish of St Peter Paul's Wharf, where he had married one Anne Powell on 3 August 1648, and where he was styled &#145;minister&#146; from 1657. In June 1660 he petitioned for a prebend at either Windsor or Worcester, claiming to have suffered greatly by plunder, sequestration, and imprisonment in the troubles, and to have been reduced to destitution. He republished some of his earlier works as <span class="italic">Five Seasonable Sermons</span>, perhaps in order to remind the new king of his service to the royal cause. Knell's request was not granted, but he was made vicar of Newchurch in Kent, in May 1662, and vicar of St Dunstan's, Canterbury, in 1664, although he continued to live in London with his second wife, Elizabeth, whom he married some time before July 1663. Knell was buried at St Dunstan's, Canterbury, on 24 August 1666.<br>
