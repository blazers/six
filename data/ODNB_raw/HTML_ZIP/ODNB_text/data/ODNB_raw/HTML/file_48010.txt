<span class="headword">Mills family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1773&#150;1939), <span class="occ">bankers</span>, was one of the most distinguished families in English banking and came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_48007"></a><span class="headword">William Mills</span>  (1714&#150;1782)<span class="occ"></span>. Five generations of Millses were partners in Glyn's, England's foremost private banking house, from its foundation in 1753 to its take-over by the Royal Bank of Scotland in 1939, the name of Mills appearing in the bank's various names from 1773 onwards. Moreover, in the second half of the nineteenth century, the Mills family was at the very core of the network of relationships linking landed aristocracy and City aristocracy.<br>
<br>Glyn's held a unique position in English banking, offering a combination of deposit, investment, and merchant banking. On the one hand it acted as the London correspondent for a large number of country banks, on the other hand, it behaved almost as a continental <i>banque d'affaires</i>  (Cottrell, 229). The bank's partners, in the first place George Carr Glyn, later first Baron Wolverton, had played a leading role in railway finance in the 1840s; for many years Glyn's was known as the &#145;railway bank&#146;. They had also handled Canadian loans in the 1850s and, with a group of business associates and family relatives, had promoted several overseas banks: in Australasia, with the Bank of Australasia in 1837; in the Middle East, with the Bank of Egypt and the Ottoman Bank in 1856, the latter becoming the Imperial Ottoman Bank in 1863; in central Europe with the Anglo-Austrian Bank in 1863; and in Latin America with the London and Brazilian Bank in 1863 and later with the English Bank of the River Plate in the 1880s. Glyn's also had a large number of major provincial industrial customers, including John Brown, Vickers, Stavely Coal and Iron, and British Westinghouse, and its involvement in industrial finance extended to acting as an issuing house on behalf of customers.<br>
<br>These business activities were reflected in the size of the company. By 1850 Glyn's had probably become the largest London bank, though precise data are not available as private banks did not then publish their balance sheets. From the 1860s onwards, however, private banks could no longer compete in terms of size with the ever expanding joint-stock banks. Nevertheless, Glyn's remained a large bank until the last decade of the nineteenth century and maintained its pre-eminence among private banks, with total assets twice as large as those of its immediate follower, Barclays, in 1891. This partly explains the decision not to enter the amalgamation movement in the 1890s and to preserve, as Algernon Mills put it, &#145;a characteristic which we alone of all large and serious banks possess, namely of having only one door&#146;  (Fulford, 226&#150;7).<br>
<br>Members of the Mills family took an active part in the bank's development, though none of them played the leading role until the twentieth century. As a banking family, however, it was among the most successful in the country, with a remarkable longevity due to the maintenance of the bank's independence until the eve of the Second World War. The first connection was established in 1773, when William Mills, a linen draper, became a partner in Glyn and Hallifax. The bank was forced to suspend payment for a few weeks following a temporary shortage of cash during the crisis of the summer of 1772. William Mills came forward with the sum of &pound;10,000, another &pound;20,000 being advanced by the third Lord Middleton. The name of the bank was then changed to Hallifax, Glyn, Mills, and Mitton. William Mills was the son of John Mills (1676/7&#150;1717), a clerk in the six clerks office of the court of chancery, and his wife, Sarah Best, who also had one daughter, who died in infancy. He inherited &pound;1500 from his father on coming of age and in 1739, married Selina, the only child of Sir John Salter of Warden's Hall, Essex, lord mayor of London, and became prominent in trade with the Orient through his father-in-law. William Mills was almost sixty by the time he joined Glyn's and, with no training or experience in banking, he played little role in the affairs of the bank which was mainly run by Thomas Hallifax. He died at his house, Warden's Hall, Essex, on 1 December 1782.<br>
<br>William Mills had no surviving children and was succeeded in the bank by his nephew <a name="cosubject_48010"></a><span class="headword">Charles Mills</span>  (1755&#150;1826)<span class="occ"></span>, second son of the Revd John Mills, rector of Barford, near Warwick, and his wife, Sarah Wheler. Born on 13 July 1755, he was educated at Rugby School, and was a partner in the bank from 1777 to 1826. The business of the bank expanded considerably during this period, with the number of staff increasing from seven in 1790 to fifty-one in 1830, and the number of country bank agencies from four to forty-nine. The outstanding personality of the period, however, was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10839/', "Richard Carr Glyn")</script>, the other members of the partnerships being of far less consequence. The Mills, however, were important providers of business, especially through their connections with Indian trade. Charles Mills succeeded his older brother William Mills (1750&#150;1820) as director of the East India Company in 1785 and was deputy chairman in 1801. He was MP for Warwick between 1802 and 1826. On 21 March 1810, at the age of fifty-five, he married Jane, daughter of the Hon. Wriothesley Digby of Meriden, Warwickshire, and the sister of his older brother's wife. They had no children. Charles Mills died on 29 January 1826.<br>
<br>Charles Mills was in his turn succeeded at the bank by his nephew <a name="cosubject_66971"></a><span class="headword">Sir Charles Mills</span>, first baronet  (1792&#150;1872)<span class="occ"></span>, third son of William Mills (1750&#150;1820), and his wife, Elizabeth Digby. After his retirement from the East India Company in the 1780s, William Mills bought the estate of Bisterne, near Southampton, and was MP for Coventry from 1805 to 1812. Born at Popes, Hatfield, on 23 January 1792, Charles Mills was educated at Harrow School and Christ Church, Oxford, and became partner in 1821. In 1825 he married Emily, a daughter of Richard Cox, one of the partners in Cox's Bank. He was created a baronet in 1868. Charles Mills was a senior partner at the time of his death on 4 October 1872 at Hillingdon Court, near Uxbridge, Middlesex. He ensured his family's entitlement to four-tenths of the bank's profits after the amalgamation in 1864 with Currie &amp; Co., under the name of Glyn, Mills, Currie &amp; Co., John Wheler Mills (1801&#150;1865), Charles's younger brother, had become a partner in 1835, retiring in 1864 owing to ill health. The bank continued to expand during Charles Mills's years as partner. However, as in the previous generation, the bank's leading figure was a Glyn: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41283/', "George Carr Glyn, first Baron Wolverton (1797&#150;1873)")</script>, was the driving force behind the bank's involvement in railway finance and in overseas issues.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_47575"></a><span class="headword">Charles Henry Mills</span>, first Baron Hillingdon  (1830&#150;1898)<span class="occ"></span>, Sir Charles Mills's only son, was born on 26 April 1830 at Camelford House, Park Lane, London. He entered the bank in 1852 after Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. He became senior partner in 1872 on his father's death, and succeeded to the baronetcy. However, the bank's guiding spirit from the mid-1860s to the mid-1890s was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39423/', "Bertram Woodehouse Currie (1827&#150;1896)")</script>. In 1853 Charles Henry Mills married Louisa Isabella Lascelles (<i>d</i>. 1918), daughter of the third earl of Harewood; they had five sons and three daughters. This alliance with an old aristocratic family reflected the Mills's new social status and their increasing integration into the upper classes. But this marriage also took place within a network of relationships linking the old families of the banking aristocracy (Barings, Glyns, Grenfells, Mills, Smiths) with a few families of the landed aristocracy  (Cassis, 221&#150;43). Charles Henry Mills was the archetypal London private banker of the Victorian age, dividing his life between his bank, his outside City interests, politics, and society. His City directorships included the chairmanships of the London committee of the Imperial Ottoman Bank and of the Union Bank of Australia, two overseas banks in the promotion of which Glyn's had played a major role, and of the North British and Mercantile Insurance Company. In politics he was conservative MP for West Kent from 1868 to 1886 when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Hillingdon. He died suddenly in Wilton Church, Wiltshire on 3 April 1898. One of the wealthiest private bankers of his day, Lord Hillingdon left &pound;1,479,000.<br>
<br>Lord Hillingdon was succeeded to most of his offices by his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_66972"></a><span class="headword">Charles William Mills</span>, second Baron Hillingdon  (1855&#150;1919)<span class="occ"></span>. Educated at Eton and Magdalen College, Oxford, he became a partner in Glyn's in 1879 and was conservative MP for the Sevenoaks division of Kent from 1885 to 1892. His directorates also included the Imperial Ottoman Bank, the Union Bank of Australia, and the North British and Mercantile Insurance Company, as well as the Anglo-Austrian Bank, another overseas bank originally linked to the Glyn's. In 1886 Charles William Mills followed the trend of aristocratic marriages by London private bankers by marrying Alice Marion Harbord, daughter of the fifth Baron Suffield who had himself married Cecilia Baring, sister of Edward Charles Baring, first Baron Revelstoke (1828&#150;1897). Charles William Mills and his wife had three sons. He left about &pound;1 million on his death on 6 April 1919, at 6 Park Place, Mayfair, London. Lord Hillingdon retired from active business life in 1907, owing to ill health, leaving the conduct of the bank to other partners, including his younger brother Algernon Henry Mills (1856&#150;1922), one of the members of the Mills family most directly engaged in daily banking activities, in particular during the war years. The dominant force in the bank during the inter-war years was a Mills by marriage, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34438/', "General Sir Herbert Alexander Lawrence (1861&#150;1943)")</script>, who in 1892 married Isabel Mary, eldest surviving daughter of the first Lord Hillingdon. He joined the bank in 1919, bringing to it much needed enterprise and energy, presiding in particular over the merger in 1922 with Holt &amp; Co., bankers and army agents, and with the West End bank Child &amp; Co. the following year. Lawrence was also chairman of Vickers, Glyn's long-standing customer and one of Britain's largest companies.<br>
<br>The bank's capital was sold to the Royal Bank of Scotland in the summer of 1939. The partners were mostly young men and with the approach of war it was feared that if some of them were to be killed, the payment of death duties on their family holdings would cause formidable difficulties. Although the days of the private banks had long gone, this state of affairs was partly due to the premature death of a promising member of the sixth generation. Charles Thomas Mills (1887&#150;1915), the elder son of Charles William Mills, second Lord Hillingdon, had become a partner in the bank, as well as conservative MP for the Uxbridge division of Middlesex, in 1910. He was killed on the western front in October 1915.<br>
