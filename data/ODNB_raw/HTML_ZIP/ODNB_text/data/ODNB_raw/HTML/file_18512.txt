<span class="headword">Meetkerke,  Edward</span>  (1590&#150;1657), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in the parish of St Botolph, Aldersgate, London, and baptized at the Dutch church, Austin Friars, on 29 September 1590, the only son (of three children) of <a name="cosubject_74105"></a><span class="headword">Adolf  van Meetkerke</span>  (1528&#150;1591)<span class="occ"></span> and his second wife, Margaret (1548/9&#150;1594), daughter of John Lichtervelde, sometime president of Flanders. Adolf, who was born in Bruges and who had published there in 1565 a work on Greek pronunciation, had himself been president of Flanders. He had presided over the states general of the United Provinces (as whose ambassador to England he served) in the immediate aftermath of the assassination of William the Silent in 1584. One of the few trusted supporters of the earl of Leicester on the Dutch council of state in 1585, with his friend Adrian Saravia and with English support he was a leader of the abortive attempt to stage a coup in Leiden in 1587. Like Saravia, a few months later he escaped to England, where he may have received payment from the privy purse. In December 1588 he was placed first in a list of householder members of the Dutch church in London.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Adolf's four sons with his first wife, Jacoba Cervina, Adolf, Nicolaas, Anthony, and Baldwin, continued to distinguish themselves in Anglo-Dutch military service. Nicolaas van Meetkerke fought valiantly at the battle of Sluys in 1587, took 500 troops levied by refugee protestants in England to the Netherlands in 1588, commanded the Dutch regiment that Sir John Norris recruited for the unsuccessful expedition to Portugal in 1589, and commanded a company in the English army in 1590&#150;91. He was killed at Deventer. The earl of Leicester paid for the education of Baldwin van Meetkerke, who joined other young men of his circle at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 11 March 1587, aged nineteen. Between 1591 and 1596 he served in the English army in the Low Countries. He was knighted by the earl of Essex after the storming of Cadiz, probably on 22 June 1596, but died of his wounds and was buried eight days later at sea.<br>
<br>Adolf van Meetkerke died in London on 6 October 1591 and his widow in November 1594; both were buried at St Botolph, Aldersgate. The infant Edward was brought up, as his will reveals, by Mary du Bois of London. He most probably went first to King's School, Canterbury, and then attended Westminster School, being taught Hebrew there by Saravia, before matriculating from Christ Church, Oxford, on 16 January 1607, aged sixteen. He graduated BA on 21 June 1610 and, having declined an offer from the Dutch church of a scholarship to study theology in Leiden, proceeded MA on 10 June 1613. He became a tutor of his college and provided private instruction in Hebrew. In 1616 he published <span class="italic">A Declaration and Manifestation, of the Chief Reasons &hellip; of Master M. Du Tertre</span> and <span class="italic">A Declaration of Henri Marc de Gouffier, Marquise of Boniuet</span>, translations from the French of two conversion testimonies given respectively at Saumur and La Rochelle. He later contributed some Latin and Greek verses to Oxford poetical collections. He proceeded BD and was licensed to preach on 19 June 1620, and on 8 November that year was elected to succeed Edward Kilbye as professor of Hebrew. On 26 May 1625 he proceeded DD and was made a canon of Christ Church.<br>
<br>That year Meetkerke's career took a new turn, however, when he was made rector of Easton, Hampshire, and by 1626 he had resigned his professorship. On 9 January 1632 he was installed as a prebendary of Winchester, and about this time he married Barbara, daughter of fellow prebendary Robert More (1568&#150;1640). Deprived of his prebend during the 1640s, he retained his rectory, &#145;my only Pastorate charge that I ever had&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/267, fols. 88&#150;9). He died at Easton on 10 August 1657 and was buried there, having expressed the desire to be buried in the chancel &#145;under the communion table as it now standeth&#146;. In his will, drawn up on 7 December 1654, and proved by his widow on 24 September 1657, he repeated, &#145;as bound in duty to hir memory&#146;, the &#145;hearts desire for my children, and childrens children&#146; enunciated in his mother's testament. This was that they might all:<blockquote>be brought up in the true reformed Christian Protestant Religion, and not led away by any sects, schismes or heresies of the times &hellip; and that for no temporall advancement or preferment they be enticed from the same to the profession of Popery, it being better that they should for want be forced to beg their bread, then ever to have such nurture. (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/267, fols. 88&#150;9)</blockquote>Property in Hampshire and an outstanding loan of &pound;540 were to go to his widow and their son Adolf (who had followed Meetkerke to Christ Church and graduated in 1654); other beneficiaries included his daughter Frances, her husband Nathaniel Napper, their children, and four godsons&#151;Robert Moore, Adolf Balgnymy, Richard Glyd of New College, Oxford, and Thomas Newcomen. Meetkerke's apparently wide circle of friends is further attested by the identities of the overseers&#151;John Harris, warden of Winchester College and Edward Appleford of Winchester, common lawyer&#151;and of the witnesses, Robert Fishwick, minister of Hideburne Worthy, and Lancelot Addison.<br>
