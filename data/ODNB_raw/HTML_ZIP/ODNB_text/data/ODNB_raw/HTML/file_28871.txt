<span class="headword">Watson, Sir  Thomas</span>, first baronet  (1792&#150;1882), <span class="occ">physician</span>, eldest son of Joseph Watson (<i>d</i>. 1813) of Thorpe-le-Soken, Essex, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Thomas Catton, was born at Montrath House, Broadhembury, Cullompton, Devon, on 7 March 1792. He was educated at the grammar school, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, where Charles James Blomfield, afterwards bishop of London, was his contemporary; they continued friends throughout life. Watson entered St John's College, Cambridge, in 1811, and graduated BA as tenth wrangler in 1815. He was elected a fellow in 1816, retiring in 1826, and in 1818 graduated MA. He studied medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital under John Abernethy in 1819. After spending the session of 1820&#150;21 at Edinburgh, he returned to Cambridge, obtained the university licence in medicine in 1822, was junior proctor in 1823&#150;4, and graduated MD in 1825.<br>
<br>On 15 September 1825 he married Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1830), daughter of Edward Jones of Brackley, Northamptonshire, and took a house in Henrietta Street, London, establishing a practice in a nearby house. He was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1826, and in May 1827 physician to the Middlesex Hospital, which was then connected with London University. He was professor of clinical medicine, and lectured from 1828 to 1831. In 1831 he became lecturer on forensic medicine at King's College, London, and in 1835 professor of forensic medicine, an office which he held until 1840. He continued to be physician to the Middlesex Hospital until 1843. In that year he published his famous <span class="italic">Lectures on the Principles and Practice of Physic</span> (2 vols.), which had first been printed week by week in the <span class="italic">Medical Times and Gazette</span> between 1840 and 1842. It was for thirty years the chief English textbook of medicine; based upon sound clinical observations, it gave a complete view of English medicine of its period, and was remarkable for its good literary style.<br>
<br>At the Royal College of Physicians Watson gave the Goulstonian lectures in 1827, the Lumleian lectures on haemorrhage in 1831, and was a censor in 1828, 1837, and 1838. In 1862 he was elected president, and was re-elected for five successive years. He was elected FRS in 1859, and in 1864 was made an honorary LLD at Cambridge. In 1857 he became president of the Pathological Society, and in 1868 of the Clinical Society. Watson's practice as a physician was large, and in 1859 he was appointed physician-extraordinary to the queen, and in 1870 physician-in-ordinary. He was one of the physicians who attended Albert, prince consort, in his last illness. He was created a baronet on 27 June 1866. He retired from practice soon after 1870. At the last meeting he attended at the Royal College of Physicians in March 1882 all the fellows present rose when he entered the room, a rare mark of respect, and the highest honour which the college can bestow on one of its fellows who has ceased to hold office.<br>
<br>Watson died on 11 December 1882 at Reigate Lodge, Reigate, Surrey, the house of his son, Sir Arthur Townley Watson QC (1830&#150;1907). A daughter, Margaret Catherine Watson, also survived him. Watson died &#145;full of years and honours &hellip; and, withal, he was modest and unassuming, as becomes a truly great and wise man&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, 1040). He was buried at Reigate on 16 December.<br>
