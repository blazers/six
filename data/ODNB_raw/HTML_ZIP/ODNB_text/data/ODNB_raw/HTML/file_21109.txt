<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Paget, Sir  George Edward</span>  (1809&#150;1892), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, on 22 December 1809, the seventh son of Samuel Paget and his wife, Sarah Elizabeth Tolver. After private tutoring in Yarmouth he followed his elder brothers to Charterhouse School in 1824. He matriculated at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1827, won a college prize in mathematics in his second year, and graduated in 1831 as eighth wrangler. His success delighted his family; such were their celebrations that his brothers Charles and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21113/', "James Paget")</script> commented that it was worth a lifetime's reading to have such an hour of rejoicing. In 1832 he was elected to a medical fellowship of his college and began to study medicine. He walked the wards at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, and visited Paris with his brother James. He graduated MB at Cambridge in 1833, ML in 1836, and MD in 1838.<br>
<br>The annual income of &pound;300 from Paget's fellowship proved vital in supporting his family, whose brewing business had fallen on hard times. His loans kept the business going through the 1830s, and in 1841 he raised &pound;1500 on his own credit and security to save it from bankruptcy. He paid for the surgical education of his brother James, and the clerical education of his brother Alfred. He looked after his brothers Frank and Charles who suffered from physical and mental illness respectively&#151;results of their efforts to keep the family business afloat. Paget himself was a lifelong sufferer from rheumatism and hay fever.<br>
<br>Paget was a leading figure within Caius College, and from his earliest days in the fellowship was earmarked to rise to the very top. In 1837 he passed over the chance to stand for the Downing professorship of medicine in the expectation that he would be able to stand for the mastership of Caius when Martin Davy, the incumbent, died. Unfortunately for Paget, Davy died in May 1839, when Paget was considered too young to become a candidate for the mastership. He did, however, become bursar of the college. In 1852, when Davy's successor Edward Chapman died, Paget's Norfolk origins made him unelectable following the university commissioners' attack of 1851 on closed fellowships. Paget took consolation in his election to the Linacre lectureship of physic at St John's College, and in his marriage, on 11 December 1851, to Clara, youngest daughter of Thomas Fardell, vicar of Sutton in the Isle of Ely; they had ten children.<br>
<br>Paget was elected physician to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on the resignation of John Haviland, in 1839. He held this post for forty-five years. He was responsible for innovative uses of the hospital in the education of Cambridge medical students: in 1842 he created a practical examination in clinical medicine, the first of its kind in the country, in which the candidate was required to examine a patient, and discuss the diagnosis, prognosis, and best course of treatment. The following year, in collaboration with the recently elected surgeon George Humphry, he inaugurated a system of clinical lectures at the hospital. Paget and Humphry also collaborated in cataloguing the physiological and pathological series of the anatomical museum in the 1840s.<br>
<br>Paget believed, as did most leading doctors of the time, that individual judgement was the physician's most important skill. He taught his students that for most diseases there was no one method of treatment, and that they should therefore treat each case individually. Nevertheless, Paget recognized the potential of scientific investigation for medicine. As he pointed out in his Harveian oration delivered at the Royal College of Physicians in 1866, he believed that physiological and pathological discoveries would ultimately advance medicine; until then scientific knowledge guarded the clinician against making errors, and was a &#145;trustworthy guide&#146; in the prevention of disease. Paget was an ardent advocate for science within the university and the medical profession. In his presidential address to the 1864 meeting of the British Medical Association, held in Cambridge, he called for a broader public understanding of science among the classes of influence in the country and the empire, as well as among the medical profession, for whom, he argued, science was becoming the measure of its social influence, and its strength in maintaining truth in medicine against the errors of alternative practices such as phrenology or homoeopathy. He reiterated these views in his medico-political dealings in London, where he served as president of the General Medical Council from 1869 to 1874. His support of science was rewarded with the presidency of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, in 1855&#150;6, and his election as FRS in 1873. He was knighted in 1887.<br>
<br>Paget succeeded Henry Bond as regius professor of physic in 1872. By this time he was beginning to feel that the development of medical subjects such as sanitary science, medical jurisprudence, and midwifery were being neglected because most of the university's resources were being diverted towards the rapidly expanding departments of natural science. Paget's campaign on behalf of medicine brought him into direct conflict with scientists such as Michael Foster, to whose departments he had previously given his wholehearted support. He had some early successes: in 1875, at his instigation, the university created a diploma in public health, and in the early 1880s a programme of clinical teaching was created which allowed students to complete their medical education at Cambridge. Paget was unable, however, to procure resources to expand the range of subjects offered at the clinical school, and students continued to leave Cambridge for the majority of their clinical training. This process accelerated after Paget's death when Clifford Allbutt, who did not believe that Cambridge should have a clinical school, was appointed as his successor.<br>
<br>Paget was one of the leaders of the conservative faction within the university, representing their interests on the council of the senate for many years from its inception in 1856. He was strongly against the abolition of university tests and the admission of women, and particularly disapproved of the redistribution of wealth away from the colleges in the late 1870s. Yet even when the university changed in ways of which he did not approve, Paget continued to be passionate in its defence, never letting an attack on Cambridge, medicine, or William Harvey go unanswered.<br>
<br>Paget died of influenza at his home, 2 St Peter's Terrace, Cambridge, on 29 January 1892. His obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> suggested that the &#145;remarkable confidence reposed by the governing body of the University&#146; in Paget's judgement was &#145;a potent factor in effecting the various reforms which resulted in the proper recognition of the study of natural and medical science&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 Jan 1892, 7a). It was a just comment. Paget presided over a remarkable transformation of the Cambridge medical school, and even if it did not become exactly what Paget had intended, the emergence of Cambridge as a leading centre in the natural and medical sciences owes much to his efforts.<br>
