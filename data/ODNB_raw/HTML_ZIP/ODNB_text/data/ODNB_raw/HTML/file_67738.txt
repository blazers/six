<span class="headword">Darton,  Frederick Joseph Harvey</span>  (1878&#150;1936), <span class="occ">publisher and writer</span>, was born on 22 September 1878, the eldest of the two sons and one daughter of Joseph William Darton (1843&#150;1916), partner in the publishing firm of Wells Gardner, Darton &amp; Co., and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1934), eldest daughter of Dr Charles Schooling of Milton, Kent. Darton was educated at Sutton Valence School and Dover College, and won a scholarship to St John's College, Oxford, taking a second class in classical moderations in 1899 and in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1901. He then joined the family firm, which had been established in the eighteenth century by William Darton (1755&#150;1819). He remained until 1928 when it was sold to Love and Malcomson. During his time at the firm, Darton brought a more scholarly approach to its general editorial policy, as befitted the only member of the firm ever to have had a university education; at the same time he was closely involved with its two juvenile magazines, <span class="italic">Chatterbox</span> and <span class="italic">The Prize</span>. (He wrote an amusing account of his experiences with these in the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, May 1932.)<br>
<br>Darton was also engaged in his own literary work. From 1901 onwards he produced many retellings of stories from old legends and romances, published by his firm. He contributed book reviews to the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, short monographs on Arnold Bennett and J. M. Barrie to the <span class="roman">Writers of the Day</span> series, and in 1910 edited the life of Mary Martha Sherwood, some of whose later children's books had been published by the Darton firm. He also wrote two pseudonymous novels touching on his own life, <span class="italic">My Father's Son</span> (under the name William W. Penn, 1913) and <span class="italic">When: a Record of Transition</span> (under the name John L. Pole, 1929). He edited the <span class="roman">Bankside Acting Edition</span> of Shakespeare from 1927 to 1929. On 2 October 1906 he married Emma Lucretia Bennett (<i>b</i>. 1876), daughter of George Lovett Bennett, headmaster of Sutton Valence School, but the marriage was annulled on grounds of non-consummation. At this period he was living in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, London, the centre of a convivial circle of friends, but after the death of his father he left London and lived variously in Kent and Dorset, writing several books about these localities. A gregarious and genial man, he loved the country and its people and, as <span class="italic">The Times</span> obituary said of him, &#145;country sports and all recreations, from shove-halfpenny to cricket and fox-hunting: he knew a good deal of archaeology; and he was at home in any decent public house&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 July 1936). (His last address was a Dorset pub, and he was to die of cirrhosis of the liver.)<br>
<br>The work for which Darton is remembered is the ground-breaking and influential <span class="italic">Children's Books in England</span> (1932), which remains a vital resource for historians and general readers. This survey of children's reading, from Caxton to the later Victorians, written as &#145;a minor chapter in the history of English social life&#146;  (Alderson, vii), stands out for the wealth of its material, its benign, Olympian viewpoint, and lightly carried learning&#151;the product of a cultivated, widely read but non-specialist bibliophile with a classical education. Darton had in 1914 contributed the chapter on children's books to volume 11 of the <span class="italic">Cambridge History of English Literature</span>, having already written on the same subject in the tenth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> (1902&#150;3). He had also acquired an impressive collection of books, games, and illustration material from the Darton firm's publications. However, as he said in the preface to <span class="italic">Children's Books</span>, this had gone to America &#145;in the stress of the Peace&#146;  (ibid., viii)&#151;it is now housed at the teachers college of Columbia University&#151;and when he settled down to write in 1931 he was working from his catalogue of the collection, and from memory, augmented by research at the British Museum. &#145;With these facts to hand&#146;, said Brian Alderson, who revised the original for a third edition in 1982, &#145;he was able to write the book with concentrated energy, and it is this which gives it the homogeneity of style and viewpoint that are its personality&#146;  (ibid., xiii). Darton produced a handful more books after this, but died of alcoholism on 26 July 1936, in Dorchester County Hospital, and was buried on 28 July at Cerne Abbas, Dorset.<br>
