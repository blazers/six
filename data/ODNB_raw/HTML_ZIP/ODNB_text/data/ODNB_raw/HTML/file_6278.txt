<span class="headword">Coppinger,  Edmund</span>  (<em>c.</em>1555&#150;1591), <span class="occ">prophet</span>, was the impoverished younger son of a fervently protestant Suffolk gentry family. He does not appear to have taken a university degree, though two of his brothers were at St John's College, Cambridge. Henry was rector of Lavenham between 1578 and 1622, and Ambrose was MP for Ludgarshall in 1586 as well as &#145;chiefe officer&#146; to the earl of Warwick, the well-known champion of the puritan cause. It was through Ambrose that, around 1588, Edmund made the acquaintance of the presbyterian leader Thomas Cartwright. Some time before 1591 he had acquired a minor post in the royal household and was living chiefly in London. There he developed a firm friendship with a Yorkshire gentleman named <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/104920/', "Henry Arthington")</script>, with whom he shared a belief that the Church of England was in need of far-reaching reform. Both were noted for their religious zeal, and their &#145;itching eares&#146; carried them to the sermons of godly preachers all over the city  (Cosin, 2). It was in the context of the imprisonment and trial of Cartwright and other puritan ministers that Coppinger and Arthington were introduced to the Northamptonshire maltster <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11840/', "William Hacket")</script>, with whom they began to formulate an ambitious and risky scheme for &#145;the deliverye of ther restrained bretheren&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kenyon MSS</span>, 608), the overthrow of the bishops, and &#145;th'expelling of dumme ministers all at one clappe&#146;  (Throkmorton, sig. A2<i>v</i>). Coppinger initially sought sanction for this &#145;secret project&#146; from key figures in the puritan movement, but when his importunate overtures were sharply rebuffed he and his accomplices turned fiercely against them. He also pestered the queen and her close advisers with letters, and used his connections to arrange an interview for Hacket and himself with Lord Burghley, who dismissed them &#145;without further adoe&#146; and accused Coppinger of building &#145;castels in th'ayre&#146; (Cosin, 30; Throkmorton, sig. A4<i>r</i>). Coppinger had a series of close encounters with God in his dreams, during which he was &#145;inwardlie ravished in spirit&#146;. The strange groans he made in his sleep led his bedfellows to suspect him &#145;not to bee well in his wittes&#146;, an opinion shared by Thomas Cartwright, who believed Coppinger suffered from &#145;some crazing of the braine&#146; and on one occasion threatened to confine him in Bridewell or Bedlam  (Throkmorton, sigs. A4<i>v</i>, A3<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>As a result of these experiences Coppinger became convinced that he and Arthington were prophets of mercy and judgment, divinely appointed lieutenants of Hacket, the new messiah and supreme king of the earth. As a consequence, their plot to depose the queen, replace several privy councillors, and establish presbyterian discipline in England gathered momentum.<br>
<br>Always the more energetic and proactive of the two disciples, Coppinger organized the publication and dissemination of hundreds of pamphlets and broadsides on the eve of the planned insurrection. On 19 July 1591 he and Arthington moved through the streets of London proclaiming &#145;newes from heaven&#146;, before mounting a cart in Cheapside and announcing the second coming of Christ in the guise of William Hacket. A tumult ensued, and shortly afterwards all three were arrested. By this time Coppinger seems to have been completely mentally deranged, though in his <span class="italic">Conspiracie, for Pretended Reformation</span> (1591) Richard Cosin alleged that he had feigned madness in the hope of escaping the full rigour of the law. He died in Bridewell on Thursday 29 July, twenty-four hours after Hacket's execution for treason, following a hunger strike which he had begun seven or eight days before. According to Arthington, who recanted and wrote a narrative of his &#145;seduction&#146; in 1592, prior to his death Coppinger had &#145;detested Hacket and asked pardon of the almightie&#146;  (Arthington, 7). The episode was used by spokesmen for the ecclesiastical establishment as propaganda against the puritan movement, and was held up as an example of the dangers of religious enthusiasm.<br>
