<span class="headword">Brooke <span class="st"> [Cobham]</span>, Sir  Henry</span>  (1537&#150;1592), <span class="occ">diplomat</span>, was born on 5 February 1537, the seventh but fifth surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70783/', "George Brooke, ninth Baron Cobham (c.1497&#150;1558)")</script>, soldier and landowner, and his wife, Anne (<i>c</i>.1510&#150;1558), eldest daughter of Edmund Bray, first Baron Bray, and his wife, Jane. His brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61735/', "William Brooke, tenth Baron Cobham (1527&#150;1597)")</script>, and he had four sisters, of whom one died young. He pursued a family eccentricity (or pretension) with unusual determination in using as a surname the family title rather than Brooke.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer15371571"></a>Education and early career, 1537&#150;1571</h2>Cobham matriculated <i>impubes</i> as a pensioner from Trinity College, Cambridge, on 29 September 1547 but did not take a degree and entered the household of the earl of Devonshire&#151;presumably during Edward Courtenay's brief liberty in 1553&#151;where he came to Princess Elizabeth's notice and &#145;liking&#146;  (Birch, 1.17). He was clearly affiliated with Elizabeth's supporters rather than with Mary I's regime and was made gentleman pensioner in 1559, a point from which he then consistently dated self-serving claims of long service to her. Family convention suggests that Cobham might have travelled in his youth. His brothers William and George Brooke (1533&#150;<i>c</i>.1570) went to Italy; another Mr Brooke found in the Veneto in 1555 seems to have been not Cobham but his brother John Brooke (1535&#150;1594), later MP for the family's local seat of Queenborough in Kent  (J. Woolfson, <span class="italic">Padua and the Tudors</span>, 1998, 214). If not before, Cobham learned foreign languages through diplomatic practice. Cobham is, however, a likely candidate for &#145;the brother of Cobham&#146; who came in August 1559 to assure the Spanish ambassador to London, Alvaro de la Quadra, bishop of Aquila, that &#145;the affair of the archduke's marriage was in a very good way&#146;. He might even be the &#145;one of these men called Cobham&#146; whom Quadra reported in March 1562 as implicated in the vague if incriminating intrigues of Margaret Douglas, countess of Lennox, who therefore &#145;sought an excuse for going to the baths of Li&egrave;ge&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1558&#150;67</i>, 93, 231). Quadra usually conversed in Italian; Cobham may or may not yet have known much Spanish, but two decades later he could use Italian as a lingua franca with the Turkish envoy in Paris.<br>
<br>Cobham accompanied Sir Thomas Chaloner to Spain in 1561, returning with dispatches later that year&#151;he thought the ambassador insufficiently appreciative of his efforts, particularly in light of his near shipwreck on the Irish coast. He complained that Chaloner had not provided enough money for his expenses, and succeeded in getting it out of the privy council. In 1567 he joined the embassy of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22993/', "Thomas Radcliffe, third earl of Sussex (1526/7&#150;1583)")</script>, to pursue the project of an Austrian marriage for the queen. Selection for this embassy may have been influenced by his knowledge of Low German. More importantly, he was connected to Sussex, who stepped in to support as &#145;a near kinsman of his own&#146; yet another brother, Thomas Brooke (1533&#150;1578), when the Spanish accused him of piracy in 1565  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1558&#150;67</i>, 455). Sussex's death in June 1583 made Cobham wish, &#145;God rayse unto me as good and noble a frend&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 78/9/130).<br>
<br>Cobham was sent by Sussex to London in October 1567 to seek further instructions; but the answer that he brought back in December included no religious concessions to Archduke Charles and thus brought the negotiation to an end. Cobham gave a different impression by causing his &#145;postilion to sound the horn all the way &hellip; crying, &#147;[Long] live Austria and England!&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Rome</span>, <i>1558&#150;71</i>, 267). Then, acting as a co-envoy, albeit a junior one, he went to see the archduke at Graz in Styria in February 1568. Charles reported to Maximilian II that Cobham agreed he was right not to compromise his faith:<blockquote>But he had hoped that I should go to England &hellip; he &hellip; hoped to be able to arrange matters in a manner which would satisfy both me and your majesty &hellip; All that had been said in England about your majesty and my territories was at variance with what he had seen for himself. But he would at his return give them a more truthful relation.</blockquote>Cobham even offered to &#145;direct&#146; &#145;those few who at his advice had bound themselves by oath&#146; so &#145;that I should see and recognize that he had been my loyal servant and wished always to remain so&#146;  (Klarwill, 296&#150;8).<br>
<br>On 19 August 1570 Cobham set out as special ambassador for the Low Countries with messages for the governor, Alvarez de Toledo, duke of Alva, and for Philip II's new queen, Anne of Austria. These proved rather more cordial than recent tense Anglo-Spanish exchanges, and Cobham went on to visit Anne's father, Maximilian, with whom he had an audience on 12 September, at Speyer. Besides appealing to monarchical solidarity against the papal deposition of Elizabeth, Cobham sought to divert the Habsburgs with a token resurrection of the queen's Austrian marriage project. Bertrand de Salignac de La Motte F&eacute;n&eacute;lon, the French ambassador in London, did not believe that &#145;young Coban&#146; would make more than &#145;a demonstration&#146;, writing sarcastically that after Sussex's failure, &#145;a young gentleman of no authority, who has scarcely grown his beard &hellip; will achieve even less at this juncture&#146;  (Teulet, 3.424&#150;5). Still peripatetic, Cobham passed through France into Spain (20 March to 5 July 1571) to explain English charges against the Spanish ambassador to England, Guerau de Spes, and to explore the idea of restoring a resident ambassador in Spain if the latter were allowed religious freedom, a suggestion that led G&oacute;mez Su&aacute;rez de Figueroa, duke of Feria, to silence Cobham &#145;for fear he should blurt out some impertinence&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1568&#150;79</i>, 316). Though he put a brave face on it, he returned dissatisfied in July 1571, opining, &#145;thynke theys smaule shooes [showers] to be warnyngs of greater storms to cumme, if tymme may fytt them&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 70/118, fol. 2<i>r</i>).<h2>
<a name="Courtierandcountygentleman15711583"></a>Courtier and county gentleman, 1571&#150;1583</h2>Though Cobham claimed when convenient a need as gentleman pensioner to attend the queen, he established a base in Kentish society after his marriage on 27 January 1573 to Anne (<i>d</i>. 1611/12), widow of Walter Haddon and daughter of Sir Henry Sutton of Nottinghamshire. She apparently brought him his main residence at Sutton-at-Hone, Kent, and they had three sons&#151;Calisthenes (1573&#150;1611), who became a soldier and was knighted, John Brooke, later Baron Cobham (1574&#150;1660), and Maximilian (1575/6&#150;1598)&#151;and two daughters, Anne (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1577) and Philippa (<i>c</i>.1579&#150;1613), who married Walter Calverley, known for the murder of their two sons and the attempted murder of his wife.<br>
<br>Cobham had become part of a &#145;recognizable Elizabethan diplomatic cadre&#146;  (Bell, &#145;Men and their rewards&#146;, 208). Rumours of 1572 and 1575 had him receiving the premier diplomatic posting, France. Although his experience of the country had been only in passing, he was sent in 1571 to meet the special French envoy Paul de Foix, in 1572 to meet Fran&ccedil;ois de Montmorency, duc de Montmorency, and to escort the French envoys on the royal progress, and in 1577 to Dartmouth in Devon to meet the Marquis d'Haverie. Instead, he finally went back to Spain as special ambassador from 20 June 1575 to 10 January 1576 fortified with a knighthood. He had an audience with Philip on 26 October, despite de Spes's complaint that &#145;some lord or person of higher position&#146; should have greeted the queen of Spain in 1570  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1567&#150;79</i>, 273). This coincided with an increase in his diet from &pound;2 per day to &pound;2 10<i>s</i>.<br>
<br>Cobham did stay for some weeks at the Paris embassy with Valentine Dale, who apparently took him on his visits to court. In October near Blaye, in Gascony, he &#145;was set on&#146; by Huguenots (ironically) &#145;in a wood&#146;, &#145;with whome we came to the proffer of the pistole, and withstanding then the first brunt we escaped with smaulle inconveniens or losse&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 70/136, fol. 38<i>v</i>). Arriving in Spain, he found there &#145;little commforte&#146;. He complained that both customs and the Spanish Inquisition insisted on &#145;visiting my stuffe&#146;. &#145;So muche more now curious they are become for the respect of religion&#146; that he lacked &#145;those visitacions whiche the last tyme I found&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 70/135, fol. 248<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Cobham believed Alva to be favourable towards mitigation of the Spanish Inquisition's scrutiny of Englishmen in Spain. Even so, the negotiations were marred by &#145;an altercation of some sort&#146;, prompting one historian to ask &#145;why the government felt someone as ill-tempered as he might prove a success in that hostile country&#146;  (Bell, &#145;Men and their rewards&#146;, 209, 210). However, with Chaloner and the disastrous John Man dead, and Sir Thomas Chamberlain retired on health grounds, Cobham was probably the candidate with most experience of Spanish negotiations. According to F&eacute;n&eacute;lon, pro-Spanish privy councillors had mooted Cobham's dispatch as early as August 1574&#151;it was no sudden decision. He also believed that, building on the statements of 1571, Cobham might have become resident ambassador if the initial negotiation had been more satisfactory. The papal nuncio claimed credit for his dismissal in January 1576, and Gregory XIII was &#145;much gratified&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Rome</span>, <i>1572&#150;8</i>, 250). Within a year of his mission, the English were complaining that &#145;nothing was performed that was promised Sir Henry Cobham at his being last in Spain&#146;  (Strype, 2/2.8). Cobham continued to write to the Spanish government personally in an abortive attempt to effect improvement in the treatment of Englishmen there, and to vindicate himself over charges of over-optimism made by the subsequent ambassador, Sir John Smythe. Cobham was allegedly &#145;much blamed and attacked at court&#146; for misrepresentation  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1567&#150;79</i>, 543).<br>
<br>Cobham remained on the look-out for offices. On the death of his kinsman Richard Verney, while accompanying him to Spain in 1575, Cobham sought his post of marshal of the king's bench&#151;&#145;the queene's majestie shoulde thearby give me a stocke to stand by in her sarvice, and with that staffe dryve from her a begger&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 70/135, fol. 248<i>r</i>). Soon after returning from Spain, he did become porter of the bag and keeper of the treasury.<br>
<br>On 15 October 1579 Cobham succeeded Sir Amias Paulet as resident ambassador in France on a diet of &pound;3 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. per day. He later claimed that the principal secretaries, Sir Francis Walsingham and Thomas Wilson, had &#145;commaunded &hellip; that I shoold lay asyde all my juste excuses then alleaged of my insufficiency&#146;, notably lack of a &#145;competent yearly lyvyng of my owne, as [other] your majestes mynysters enjoyed&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 78/9/43; 78/9/13). Others impugned his sufficiency in other respects. Cobham perhaps held &#145;the record for detailed and unassimilated reporting of virtually anything that came to his attention&#146;, especially rumours concerning the activities of English Catholic exiles  (Bell, &#145;Men and their rewards&#146;, 211). He wished, however, to hear whether his reports were confirmed, &#145;otherwyse I may be abused, and her majestie's money ill-bestowed&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 78/7/24). Walsingham warned him that the queen was critical of the expense of Cobham's sending so many reports, advising him to reduce the volume somewhat. Moreover, Cobham was not enciphering as he should have been, given that some letters were going astray. Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, not an intimate of Cobham's though inevitably petitioned by him in his quest for preferment, had already&#151;either helpfully or maliciously&#151;&#145;sent me worde I have very evill intelligence, and that the quene shuld be informed I caryed muche forniture for myself and &hellip; my servauntes&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 78/4/72). Cobham continued &#145;notwithstanding to report what is sent or delivered&#146;, though doubtful whether it was &#145;imployed to any good purpose&#146; (TNA: PRO, SP 78/9/109; BL, Cotton MS Otho E. iv, fol. 23<i>r</i>). At least the government did make considerable propaganda use from 1580 of the articles of a purported international Catholic League given to Cobham by John Leslie, former bishop of Ross.<br>
<br>Views of Cobham's French embassy have varied, from grouping him with Elizabethan colleagues with a &#145;wary distaste for their host country&#146; to finding him &#145;a particularly effective vehicle for fostering the burgeoning friendship between the two realms&#146; (Leimon and Parker, 1134; Bell, &#145;Men and their rewards&#146;, 211). The second judgement is the more true, but the first still describes Cobham's faults accurately. He regarded Henri III and Catherine de' Medici as unreliable, &#145;removing princes&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 78/5/80). As for Catherine, &#145;he trusteth nothinge thatt she says tyll he see yt doone&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 78/4/138). He regarded the half-hearted negotiation combining marriage talks between Elizabeth and Fran&ccedil;ois, duc d'Anjou, and Anglo-French alliance against Spain as a lost opportunity because the former were abandoned, effectively scuppering the latter. He was not, however, completely anti-Spanish as a result of his experiences there and recognized the need to play one Catholic power off against another.<br>
<br>Cobham took a different view from Walsingham as to the subordination he owed the secretary of state. It is, however, an extreme picture painted of him by Walsingham's man Nicholas Faunt:<blockquote>If heretofore he cared little for me, and such as belong to my master, now he is become so stout and strange &hellip; that he hath been at odds with all the honest gentlemen my master favoureth, even to have chased them away; and for those, that yet remain, he hath ever in suspicion and useth these after a strange sort. (Birch, 1.17&#150;18)</blockquote>Fundamentally, though, Cobham was too dependent on Walsingham because the secretary was the most likely person to facilitate his recall and for &#145;the amending of my sillye estate&#146;, an obsessive concern  (TNA: PRO, SP 78/4/4). Even a grant in 1582 worth &pound;2000, when he wanted &pound;3000, tended, in a &#145;staggringe sorte&#146;, to &#145;have dulled my courage&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 78/7/128). By the end of 1582, he claimed to have &#145;no more meanes to countenance this place, nor contentment of mynde to indure this trade&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 78/8/53). Unusually, he was joined on his posting by his wife, who, however, wrote to Leicester, &#145;I lyve a lyfe heere not so muche to my conte[nt] as I trusted I shoulde&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Caligula E. vii, fol. 205<i>r</i>).<h2>
<a name="Finalyears15831592"></a>Final years, 1583&#150;1592</h2>On 15 September 1583 Cobham was replaced by Sir Edward Stafford, with whom, characteristically, he was reluctant to co-operate. There was, however, a history behind this&#151;Stafford, on a mission concerning the Anjou match, had impugned intelligence provided by William Waad, who was cherished by Cobham. It was logical if petty of Cobham to refuse to brief Stafford on reports which the latter did not value.<br>
<br>Cobham's advance of &pound;500 on departure in 1579 was one of the more generous, his diets of &pound;280 per quarter seem to have been paid regularly, and he received extraordinary sums of at least &pound;1382 over four years. However, by 1583 he claimed to have sold land, leaving him owing over &pound;600 in England and 700 crowns in Paris. A younger son, it is probable that he was &#145;no loser&#146; by his diplomatic career&#151;but, between pretension and paranoia, he might still have strained his resources, especially while in Paris  (Bell, &#145;Men and their rewards&#146;, 113).<br>
<br>In 1587 it was suggested that Cobham join his brother William Brooke in negotiations in the Spanish Netherlands and in 1589 it was proposed that he take a message to James VI. However, he had effectively retired to a country sphere. A JP for Kent by 1573, he became <i>custos rotulorum</i> about 1584 and deputy lieutenant in 1588, when he was involved in preparations against the Spanish Armada. He was also active in dealing with recusants in Kent. He returned to parliament, this time as knight of the shire for Kent, in 1586 and 1589 and sat on key committees, including that petitioning for the execution of Mary, queen of Scots, a course he had long advocated. Cobham died intestate and apparently heavily in debt at Sutton-at-Hone on 13 January 1592. Perhaps &#145;embittered and improvident&#146;, nevertheless, even if unable to succeed against the odds in his Spanish missions, he had made a better impression than average for English diplomats in Austria and France and&#151;difficult though he could be&#151;was clearly regarded as one of the more versatile Elizabethan ambassadors  (McKeen, 2.614).<br>
