<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Popham,  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1610&#150;1651), <span class="occ">naval and army officer</span>, was the fifth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22540/', "Sir Francis Popham (1572/3&#150;1644)")</script> of Littlecote in Wiltshire and Wellington in Somerset, and his wife, Anne Dudley (<i>b</i>. 1575). He was not sent to university but was admitted as a student to the Middle Temple on 14 November 1632. He first came to notice as lieutenant of the <i>Henrietta Maria</i> in the ship money fleet of 1636, commanded by the earl of Northumberland. The following year he was promoted to be captain of the sixth-rate <i>Fifth Whelp</i>. In May 1637 he was commended for &#145;a very good piece of service&#146; in rescuing two merchant ships from a Dunkirk privateer  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1637</i>, 136). On 28 June he lost his ship when she sprang a leak in storm-force winds and sank 16 leagues off Holland, while returning from escorting the ships carrying the goods and baggage of the elector palatine. Seventeen men were drowned but the remainder got into a small boat and reached Brill safely. Popham was not blamed for the mishap because the whelps had been made of unseasoned timber in 1628 and were all leaky. By the beginning of the civil wars only two of them were still in service.<br>
<br>Popham did not go to sea the next year because of family problems. His father was a rich man but transferred much of his estate to his eldest son, John, on his marriage. John proved to be a spendthrift and when he died in 1638 he left debts of &pound;38,000. The mortgaging of North Petherton rectory by Edward and his need for a temporary loan of &pound;200 from the countess of Castlehaven may well have been part of the fall out  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1637&#150;8</i>, 384; <i>1638&#150;9</i>, 154, 158). In 1639 he was at sea again, commanding a ship in Sir John Pennington's squadron which kept a watchful eye on the Spanish fleet under Oquendo when it took refuge from the Dutch in English coastal waters. He shared the humiliation of having to watch Tromp sail into the Downs and destroy the Spaniards in English territorial waters, unable to intervene.<br>
<br>Like his father and his elder brothers Alexander and Hugh, Popham supported parliament in the first civil war. He was present at the muster at Wells called by Sir John Horner to put into force the parliamentary militia ordinance. He probably served under Alexander in the early stages of the war but he is not mentioned individually until the parliamentary foray against Sherborne and Portland in April 1643 in which his brother Hugh was killed  (Underdown, 48). In June 1643 he commanded a cavalry detachment involved in a stand between Glastonbury and Wells against Hopton's advancing royalist army. He fought at both Lansdown and Roundway Down and after the fall of Bristol went into Wiltshire to rally support for the parliament there. His movements during 1644 are difficult to piece together but in June he, his brother Alexander, and Colonel Ludlow established a committee at Devizes to raise soldiers and secure the county. His intervention in December played a crucial part in persuading parliament to send a force to relieve Blake at Taunton.<br>
<br>By May 1645 Popham was a colonel in the New Model Army and responsible for organizing the regiments as they arrived at the rendezvous at Romsey in Hampshire  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1644&#150;5</i>, 585), where he also maintained contact with the force under Colonel Ralph Weldon which had just raised the second siege of Taunton. He did not take part in the battle of Naseby, being assigned to the brigade commanded by Major-General Edward Massey which was left to keep a watchful eye on the west. He is not mentioned again by name but he may have fought at Langport and been present at the sieges of Bridgwater and Bristol under his brother's command. Sir Francis Popham died in 1644 and when the recruiter elections were held in 1645 Edward succeeded him as MP for Minehead. The Pophams were allies of the notorious Somerset &#145;county boss&#146; John Pyne, a grandnephew of Sir Francis Popham, and in 1645 a leaked letter from Pyne to Edward Popham, warning that the Scots intended to do a deal with the king, caused a political storm  (Underdown, 121&#150;2). The Pophams supported the candidates favoured by Pyne in the Somerset county election of December 1645. On 15 October 1645 at Guildford, Popham married Ann, daughter of William Carr, a groom of the bedchamber.<br>
<br>Just before the beginning of the second civil war Popham was offered the command of the third-rate <i>Swallow</i> in March 1648 in place of Leonard Harris, who was the original selection; he did not take it up and Harris was reinstated. In August, Popham and Alexander Bence were nominated as commissioners to accompany the fleet under the earl of Warwick against the royalists but again Popham declined office, being replaced by Walter Strickland (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1648&#150;9</i>, 195; <span class="italic">JHL</span>, 10.397).<br>
<br>In February 1649 Popham became one of the three generals-at-sea appointed by the Commonwealth. He was already a close associate of Robert Blake, who later wrote that he had accepted the position because of Popham's persuasion  (<span class="italic">Leyborne-Popham MSS</span>, 38). Blake, who was very conscious of his lack of seagoing knowledge, seems to have begun his military career as a client of the Pophams and there was a close friendship between him and the younger brother. When the 1649 campaign began Popham went to sea with the first detachment of ships to force a squadron of royalist ships out of the channel. An encounter in fog, in which the royalists lost the <i>Constant Charles</i>, forced them to retreat westwards. Deane and Blake then joined Popham at Plymouth and the combined force sailed to Kinsale to confront Rupert. After consultation the generals decided to separate. They drew lots for the different stations as a result of which Popham returned to the Downs. For the rest of the campaign he had the dull but essential task of monitoring the movements of foreign warships and ensuring that Deane and Blake receive their supplies promptly.<br>
<br>Rupert escaped from Kinsale in October 1649 when Blake was blown off his station by a storm, and in March 1650 Blake pursued him to Portugal where he had taken refuge. Information that the French intended to send four powerful frigates to reinforce the royalists led the Commonwealth to dispatch Popham with a squadron of eight ships to supplement the eleven Blake already had. This was counter-productive. King John was embarrassed by Rupert's presence, particularly when Blake and Popham stopped the annual Brazil fleet, but the royalists were reluctant to move while the parliamentarians had such an overwhelming force. Rupert only tried once while Popham was there, on 22 July, and the powerful Commonwealth ships soon had the royalists and their French and Portuguese allies hurrying back to the shelter of the Tagus. At the beginning of September Popham returned to England with most of the fleet, leaving Blake to keep watch with a small squadron of frigates.<br>
<br>The generals separated again in 1651. Deane was now onshore and Blake was given the task of capturing the Isles of Scilly, leaving Popham in the Downs to police the channel and the North Sea. Popham died of a fever at Dover on 19 August 1651 and was given a state funeral in the Henry VII chapel in Westminster Abbey on 24 September, attended by the speaker, Cromwell, and the council of state. His remains were removed by the royalists in 1660 and returned to the family. One year's salary was granted to his widow, Ann, who married Philip, fourth Lord Wharton, in 1661. Popham left two children, Letitia and Alexander.<br>
