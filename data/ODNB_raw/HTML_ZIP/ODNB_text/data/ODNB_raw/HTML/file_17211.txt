<span class="headword">Lushington,  Henry</span>  (1812&#150;1855), <span class="occ">colonial administrator</span>, was born at Singleton, Lancashire, on 13 April 1812, the second son of Edmund Henry Lushington (1766&#150;1839), of Park House, Maidstone, chief commissioner of the colonial audit board, and his second wife, Sophia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Philips (<i>c</i>.1780&#150;1841). He was educated from 1823 to 1828 at Charterhouse School, where he was head boy at the age of fifteen, and became a student of Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1829. Despite ill health, which became chronic, he won the Porson university prize for Greek iambics twice&#151;in 1832 and again in 1833&#151;and graduated senior optime with a first class in the classical tripos. He graduated BA in 1834, was elected fellow in 1836, and proceeded MA in 1837. Although he was called to the bar at the Inner Temple on 20 November 1840, he lacked the constitution and interest to build a law practice, and his skills as a writer and interest in political affairs made him more successful as a pamphleteer.<br>
<br>Lushington was an admirer and later favourite adviser and critic of Tennyson's work; in 1839 he met the poet for the first time, and they became friends. In 1847 Tennyson dedicated <span class="italic">The Princess</span> to him. Lushington's elder brother, Edmund, married Tennyson's sister Cecilia.<br>
<br>In 1847 Lushington was unexpectedly appointed chief secretary to the government of Malta by Lord Grey. This was a demanding post, since the first civil and Catholic governor had just been appointed and constitutional reform was being proposed. In 1849 Lushington brought forward the proposed code of laws before the newly elected legislative council and became deeply involved in debates, in which he supported full religious equality before the law. Although in weak health, he remained at his post until 1855.<br>
<br>Lushington's interests were literary and political. He wrote verse and commentary, and published <span class="italic">Joint Compositions</span> with George Stovin Venables in 1840 and <span class="italic">&#145;La Nation Boutiqui&egrave;re&#146; and other Poems</span> with his brother Frank in 1855. His first political pamphlet was <span class="italic">Fellow Commoners and Honorary Degrees</span> (1837), an indictment of title and privilege, and this was followed by other criticisms of contentious political decisions, such as Britain's invasion of Afghanistan (<span class="italic">A Great Country's Little Wars, or, England, Afghanistan and Sinde</span>, 1844) and the imposition of the railways at home (<span class="italic">The Broad and Narrow Gauge</span> and <span class="italic">Fallacies of the Broken Gauge</span>, both 1846). In 1851 he published <span class="italic">A Detailed Exposure of the Apology put forth by the Neapolitan Government in reply to the Charges of Mr Gladstone</span>, and in 1853 <span class="italic">The Double Government, the Civil Service, and the Indian Reform Agitation</span>.<br>
<br>In 1855 Lushington's health became poor enough for him to decide to leave Malta to visit England. He died on the way home, while staying in Paris, on 11 August 1855. He was buried in Boxley, Kent.<br>
