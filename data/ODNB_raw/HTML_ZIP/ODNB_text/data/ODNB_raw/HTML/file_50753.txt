<span class="headword">Smithies,  Thomas Bywater</span>  (1817&#150;1883), <span class="occ">campaigner for temperance and for animal welfare</span>, was born on 27 August 1817 in York, the second of ten children of James Smithies and his wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bywater. Little is known of his parents other than that they were respectable, and were married at St Peter's Church, Leeds, on 23 June 1812  (<span class="italic">IGI</span>).<br>
<br>Little is known of Smithies's childhood, beyond that as a toddler he would hand out tracts in church; that he was educated at York and Doncaster; and that he was praised for the &#145;singular beauty of this handwriting&#146;  (Rowe, 7). After working as a clerk for the Yorkshire Fire and Life Insurance Company from the age of sixteen, Smithies moved to London in 1849 to join the Gutta Percha Company as a manager. During the intervening years, however, he had worked tirelessly as a Sunday school teacher, a prison visitor, and education reformer. Later he joined the British Temperance League, and became a total abstainer and an ardent supporter of the Band of Hope. By 1850 he had published his first pamphlet on the consequences of intemperance. In January 1851 he issued the <span class="italic">Band of Hope Review</span>, beginning his lifelong involvement with illustrated temperance publications.<br>
<br>On 1 February 1855 Smithies's major publication, the <span class="italic">British Workman, and Friend of the Sons of Toil</span>, a monthly &#145;improving&#146; paper, was launched. The <span class="italic">British Workman</span> became a highly successful penny paper with a circulation in excess of 200,000 copies per month, recognized for the consistency of its editorial position and the superior quality of its illustrations. The success of the <span class="italic">British Workman</span> was almost entirely due to the efforts and personality of Smithies who had, through his philanthropic work in the capital, come into close association with, and earned the respect of, a number of influential individuals and organizations. His circle of friends included Charles Dickens, Angela, Baroness Burdett-Coutts, and Lord Shaftesbury, and his continuing religious work brought him into intimate contact with prominent members of the established church, the Society of Friends, and noted political figures such as Samuel Gurney MP. He was also acquainted with eminent artists and engravers such as John Gilbert, Robert Barnes, Harrison Weir, and John Knight, all of whom contributed significantly to the success of the <span class="italic">British Workman</span>, some coming out of retirement so to do. Smithies edited the <span class="italic">Workman</span> for the next twenty-eight years, along with several other prominent periodicals including the <span class="italic">Children's Friend</span> and the <span class="italic">Family Friend</span>, as well as producing numerous tracts, pamphlets, almanacs, and overseeing the publication of many illustrated books for children.<br>
<br>On moving to London Smithies intended that his parents should join him, but his father died before he was able to make the move. However his mother, <a name="cosubject_50753"></a><span class="headword">Catherine Smithies</span>  (1791&#150;1878), herself a <span class="occ">campaigner for animal welfare</span>, did live with him in his house at Earlham Grove, Wood Green, until her death in 1878. Smithies was devoted to his mother and shared her passion for the well-being of animals, directing his energies and resources in support of the Band of Mercy movement in the foundation of which she had been heavily involved, and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) to whom the rights to the <span class="italic">Band of Mercy</span> journal (and other properties) eventually transferred  (<span class="italic">Animal World</span>, 1 Sept 1883, 137).<br>
<br>Smithies never married, but devoted his life to his numerous publications and, through them, to furthering his many causes. Despite his many business commitments, he still managed to find the time and energy to undertake lecture tours; to serve on the first London school board (1870), representing Hackney; and to take an active interest in the Drinking Fountains Association, as well as numerous other issues. Not only did he show concern for affairs within the United Kingdom, but also in the condition of black people in America, and that of the people of Ireland.<br>
<br>By all accounts Smithies grew up to be a generous and compassionate man, a lifelong Wesleyan Methodist, a total abstainer, and a vigorous campaigner on behalf of the working classes. Pictorial representations depict him as an elderly gentleman with an earnest countenance, sporting a goatee beard and wearing a skull-cap, seated at his desk. He was a totally committed member of the Lord's Day Observance Society, and was known to chastise others for using public transport on a Sunday in order to &#145;listen to a sermon&#146;  (Keefe, 29). He supported the Early Closing Movement.<br>
<br>On 20 July 1883 at Earlham Grove Thomas Smithies, whose health had for a number of years been gradually deteriorating with a serious heart disease, slipped uncomplainingly into unconsciousness, and died. At his bedside were his five sisters. News of his death was widely announced in the press and at his funeral in Abney Park cemetery on 26 July more than 1000 people gathered to pay their respects. The mourners included officers of the RSPCA and his old friend the earl of Shaftesbury. Smithies left the bulk of his estate to his youngest invalid sister, Elisa, his &#145;Sunbeam in life&#146;  (will); it comprised mainly ownership of periodical titles and properties, but very little money. He had never intended to profit from his business, even though he had opportunities to do so. Such resources as were made available to him through his good fortune, and the blessing of God, he shared with others. An obituarist denominated him &#145;a gentle guide, a wise counsellor, a true friend&#146; to his fellow man  (<span class="italic">British Workman</span>, 346, October 1883, 182).<br>
