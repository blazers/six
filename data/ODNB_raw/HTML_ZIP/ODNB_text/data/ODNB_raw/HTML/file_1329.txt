<span class="headword">Barber,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1500&#150;1549), <span class="occ">clergyman and civil lawyer</span>, is of obscure origins. He was a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, from 1528 to 1538, having graduated as a bachelor of canon law (4 February 1525) and of civil law (19 February 1528). He became a member of the College of Advocates on 8 March 1532, and incepted as a doctor of civil law at Oxford on 17 February 1533. He was apparently ordained by 1524, and was admitted as vicar of St Giles', Oxford, on 7 December 1531, where he remained until November 1534. On 6 September 1537 he was collated to the living of Wrotham, Kent, to which was added the living of Charing, also in Kent, on 26 February 1545. In 1538 he became a canon and prebendary of the newly founded King Henry VIII College at Oxford, and he remained there until the college was dissolved on 10 May 1545. He continued to draw a pension on the foundation until 1547.<br>
<br>Barber was one of Archbishop Cranmer's chaplains and an official of the provincial court of Canterbury, but his special vocation was to advise the archbishop on civil law matters. In 1538 he was consulted by Cranmer on behalf of Henry VIII, on a subtle point of law touching the dowry of the duchess of Richmond, widow of the king's natural son; and on 18 August 1538 the archbishop asked Thomas Cromwell to appoint Barber to a royal commission to try and examine whether the blood of St Thomas of Canterbury was not &#145;a feigned thing and made of some red ochre, or of such like matter&#146;  (Jenkyns, 1.260&#150;63). On 21 November 1538 Cranmer attempted to use his influence with Cromwell to obtain a prebendal stall at Christ Church, Oxford, for him, but he does not appear to have been successful, for Barber's name is not mentioned by Anthony Wood in his account of Christ Church. In this letter the archbishop speaks of Cromwell's knowledge of Barber's &#145;qualities and learning&#146;, and calls him &#145;an honest and meet man&#146;. Barber also appeared as one of the proctors for Anne Boleyn at the annulment of her marriage on 17 May 1536.<br>
<br>In 1541 Cranmer appointed Barber to visit All Souls College a second time, as his deputy, because the &#145;compotations, ingurgitations, and enormous commessations&#146; reported there had excited the archbishop's indignation  (Strype, <span class="italic">Cranmer</span>, 1.131). His signature is appended to <span class="italic">A Declaration Made of the Functions and Divine Institution of Priests</span>  (BL, Cotton MS Cleopatra E V, fol. 45) and to a Latin judgment on the rite of confirmation, both of which were framed to meet the demands of the post-Reformation church. In 1543 Barber repaid Cranmer's kindness to him by joining in a plot for the archbishop's ruin. On the authority of Ralph Morice, Cranmer's secretary, John Foxe mentions that the archbishop elicited a condemnation of a hypothetical case of treachery from Barber and Richard Thornden (Thornton), the suffragan bishop of Dover, and then produced their letters, showing that they were the guilty persons. According to Foxe, Cranmer magnanimously forgave them, but Strype says that Cranmer &#145;thought fit no more to trust them, and so discharged them of his service&#146;  (Strype, <span class="italic">Cranmer</span>, 1.173). Barber died at Wrotham in the spring of 1549 and was buried in the churchyard there. His will was dated 27 March of that year and was proved on 20 July.<br>
