<span class="headword">Swain,  Joseph</span>  (1820&#150;1909), <span class="occ">wood-engraver</span>, was born at Oxford on 29 February 1820, the second son of Ebenezer Swain, a printer, and his wife, Harriet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> James, and the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26811/', "Joseph Swain")</script>, pastor of East Street Baptist Church, Walworth, and a religious poet. The family moved to London when he was nine, and in 1834 he was apprenticed to Nathaniel Whittock, a drawing-master and commercial artist with Oxford connections. Swain wanted to learn wood-engraving, in which Whittock was not expert, so he went to work for Thomas Williams, one of a family of wood-engravers who were among the leading practitioners of the craft in the generation after Bewick. With Williams, he moved away from Bewick's way of suggesting texture by means of various ingenious notations towards facsimile engraving&#151;the precise reproduction of an artist's drawing.<br>
<br>Swain set up independently&#151;at 18 Elder Street, Spitalfields&#151;in 1842, and the following year he married Martha Cooper; they had three sons and a daughter. Swain's advancement resulted from a commission handed on to him by the engraver Orlando Jewitt in 1843. Bradbury and Evans, the publishers of <span class="italic">Punch</span> (begun 1841), were seeking new engravers and asked Jewitt to engrave a design by John Leech. Jewitt passed the job to Swain, whose efforts so pleased Leech that Swain was employed as manager of the engraving department of <span class="italic">Punch</span>. In due course, <span class="italic">Punch</span> agreed that Swain could expand his work in other directions, while still retaining responsibility for <span class="italic">Punch</span> engravings (which the firm continued to deal with until 1900). In 1855 Swain reappeared in trade directories as an independent engraver, at 58 Fleet Street, and from 1858 until almost the end of the century at 6 Bouverie Street, Fleet Street.<br>
<br>A member of Swain's staff (said to number six or eight in the early days) recalled that at first everyone&#151;masters, journeymen, and apprentices&#151;worked together in the same room around a large baize-covered table. In due course, hierarchy was asserted. The masters went to a room downstairs with &#145;No Admittance&#146; posted over the door, while &#145;Mr. Swain removed to the first floor, had his room papered; put matting on the floor, and pictures on the walls, and was thus quite up to date&#146;  (Groves, 17). For a time the firm employed as manager W. H. Hooper, who later became better known when, after retirement, he engraved for William Morris at the Kelmscott Press.<br>
<br>The effectiveness of wood-engravings depends largely on the type of drawing provided. Those with tone need adaptation by the engraver, while those with clear lines can be exactly replicated. Engravers tended to specialize in either tint or facsimile. For the latter kind of work Swain's firm received many tributes:<blockquote>How is it you are able to preserve the character of each artist's drawing in the way you do? When I look over any engravings I can generally tell who the engraver is, but when I look at your work I can see at once who the artist is. (Ewart, 240&#150;41)</blockquote>&#145;The proof is simply exquisite&#151;I never had and never saw anything more perfectly engraved. It seems so strange to see anything like my own drawing on a proof that I am quite upset and unmanned&#146;  (Fred Barnard, letter to Swain, 11 Sept 1872, V&amp;A). Swain used photography to assist in the engraving process as soon as this became possible. For instance, he wrote to Ford Madox Brown about a proposed design:<blockquote>Will you draw it on paper &amp; have it photographed on to the wood or draw it on the wood direct? If you do it on paper I would advise that it be done larger than required so that it be reduced in the photograph. (letter, 18 March 1867, V&amp;A)</blockquote>This refers to transferring an image photographically to a woodblock for hand engraving; later it became possible for a photographed image to be mechanically engraved on zinc using acid, and Swain adopted this process.<br>
<br>Swain carried out a great variety of work, artistic and everyday, without becoming especially associated with any in particular. Unlike the Dalziel brothers, he did not try to act as artistic patron or originator of publications. But he had some artistic sensibility. He is credited with urging his workmen &#145;to search the drawing for the motive of the artist and work up to that&#146;  (Hartley, 10). Furthermore, he showed his firm's engravings at the Royal Academy, and went into print (apparently for the one and only time) with a series of short tributes to artists he had known who died before achieving fame (first in <span class="italic">Once a Week</span>, then reprinted in H. C. Ewart, <span class="italic">Toilers in Art</span>, 1891). Among the artistic achievements to which his firm contributed, one of the largest and most brilliant was Arthur Boyd Houghton's &#145;Graphic America&#146; series in <span class="italic">The Graphic</span> (1870&#150;73). The firm's engravings were signed &#145;SWAIN Sc&#146;. Swain died at Ealing on 25 February 1909.<br>
<br>Swain's son, <a name="cosubject_64207"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Blomeley Swain</span>  (<em>b. </em>1844), was also a wood-engraver, at first working semi-independently (according to Engen) as John Swain, from 1860 at 266 Strand, an address shared by several wood-engravers. He took over the family firm on his father's retirement and expanded its activities into half-tone and colour printing.<br>
