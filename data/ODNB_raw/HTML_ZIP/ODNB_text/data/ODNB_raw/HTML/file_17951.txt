<span class="headword">Manners,  Charles Cecil John</span>, sixth duke of Rutland  (1815&#150;1888), <span class="occ">politician</span>, born in Lower Grosvenor Street, London, on 16 May 1815, was the third but eldest surviving son of John Henry, fifth duke of Rutland (1778&#150;1857), and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Howard (1780&#150;1825), daughter of the fifth earl of Carlisle. He was styled marquess of Granby from birth until his father's death in 1857. He was educated at Eton College (1829&#150;32) and as a nobleman at Trinity College, Cambridge, matriculating in 1832 and being made MA in 1835. He was elected as a tory as one of the members for Stamford in 1837 (he and his fellow tory candidate received 200 and 201 votes respectively, their Liberal opponent 1) and held the seat unopposed until his last election, in 1847, when he still won comfortably though there was a Liberal revival. In 1852 he moved to North Leicestershire, where he was unopposed.<br>
<br>Granby was a pronounced and voluble protectionist. He lacked the interest and ability of his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34855/', "Lord John Manners")</script> (later seventh duke of Rutland, <i>d</i>. 1906), but moved on the fringe of the Young England group of which his brother was a leader. His present wealth and future dukedom meant that his tory colleagues had to bear with him; &#145;it is idle to pretend&#146;, wrote Robert Blake, that he &#145;was other than a stick&#146;  (Blake, 262). He was a lord of the bedchamber to Prince Albert in 1843&#150;6, his only political office. His opportunity for power came in 1848, when Lord George Bentinck resigned as leader of the protectionists. Granby was elected on 10 February, but gave up on 4 March, &#145;conscious of his own inadequacy&#146;  (Blake, 262), and no successor could be found; for a time the tory party had no leader in the Commons. Granby then formed part of a trio of leadership with Disraeli (then unpopular with his colleagues) and J. C. Herries, an arrangement concocted by Stanley to allow Disraeli, when Granby inherited the dukedom, to become leader. Disraeli had considerable contempt for Granby and the arrangement was always at best uneasy. Granby resigned from the trio early in 1852. Despite the low opinion held of him by many of his colleagues, and his tendency to break down in debate, Granby was included in the various plans for office. However, when Lord Derby (as Stanley had become) formed a minority tory government in February 1852, Granby declined to join it, but became lord lieutenant of Lincolnshire, Charles Greville remarking that the appointment &#145;will probably have the effect of stopping his mouth, if it does not remove his discontent&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 11.272).<br>
<br>Granby's significance in the leadership of his party rapidly declined from this point. He replaced Lincolnshire with Leicestershire as his lord lieutenancy in 1857, the year in which he succeeded his father as duke of Rutland, and was made KG in 1867. His father had forbidden him to marry Lady Forester, for whom he &#145;nourished a hopeless passion&#146;  (Vincent, 348). He was known as &#145;a splendid rider to hounds&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) and never lost the conviction that protection, and especially agricultural protection, was the answer to all ills. Disabled by gout in his later years, he died, unmarried, at his seat, Belvoir Castle, on 4 March 1888, and was buried in the mausoleum there.<br>
