<span class="headword">Chapman,  Livewell</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1643&#150;1665), <span class="occ">bookseller and Fifth Monarchist</span>, was the son of Edward Chapman, a London scrivener. His father had died by the time he was apprenticed in the London Stationers' Company, on 6 November 1643, to Benjamin Allen, bookseller. After Allen's death in 1646 he continued his apprenticeship in Allen's shop, The Crown in Pope's Head Alley, and was freed on 13 November 1650 by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57039/', "Hannah Allen (fl. 1632&#150;1664)")</script>, Benjamin's widow, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Howse. By September 1651 he and Hannah were married; their children, Livewell (<i>b</i>. 1652) and Patience (<i>b</i>. 1653), were baptized at St Mary Abchurch. From 1651, when his name first appeared in imprints, Chapman continued the radical direction of the business established by his wife, maintaining her associations with printers (notably the Simmons family and Robert Ibbitson) and authors (such as Henry Jessey, Manasseh Ben Israel, and Vavasour Powell) to become the leading publisher of Fifth Monarchist works.<br>
<br>Chapman's adherence to the Fifth Monarchist cause brought him into frequent conflict with the authorities. In October 1654 he was arrested in connection with John Spittlehouse's <span class="italic">An Answer to One Part of the Lord Protector's Speech</span> and was released on security on 2 November 1654. In 1655 he was again arrested, possibly in connection with the reading of an anti-Cromwellian petition at a meeting at Allhallows on 3 December. His responsibility for the petition's publication (as <span class="italic">A Word for God</span>) was later suspected: &#145;mr. Chapman &hellip; was trusted with the printing of it, and is the owner or at least a sharer in the private presse, that hath and doth so much mischeife&#146;  (Thurloe, 4.379, 3 Jan 1656). His most notable publication of 1656 was James Harrington's <span class="italic">The Commonwealth of Oceana</span>. Some time before 11 January 1657 he began to dissociate himself from Fifth Monarchist militancy: with Christopher Feake and a Mr Hudson he was excluded from the Coleman Street meeting and on 5 April he warned Venner that to pursue insurrection would &#145;serve the common enemy, give them advantage, and bury the cause&#146;  (Burrage, 734). On 22 October 1657 the council of state ordered the examination of &#145;an erroneous book&#146; printed by him and on 23 March 1658 he was called before the council concerning &#145;a book reflecting on the Government&#146;, probably John Eliot's <span class="italic">The Christian Commonwealth</span>  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1657&#150;8</i>, pp. 134, 339).<br>
<br>Thus far Chapman had published fewer than twenty titles per year, but in 1659 he produced more than fifty, the majority being topical: addresses to parliament, short polemics, and petitions. In 1660 he was implicated in a plot headed by Sir Henry Vane, though the second of two letters (4 and 8 April) naming the conspirators may have been a forgery, designed to incriminate anti-government activists. A warrant for his arrest was issued on 27 March; on the next day the council of state issued a proclamation that &#145;from a wicked Design to engage the nation in Blood, and Confusion&#146; Chapman had &#145;caused several Seditious and Treasonable Books, to be Printed and Published&#146;  (<span class="italic">Council of State: a Proclamation</span>). These possibly included Milton's <span class="italic">Readie and Easie Way</span> and the anonymous <span class="italic">Plain English</span>, both published in March. Chapman avoided arrest, despite more warrants of 3 and 28 April.<br>
<br>In the early years of the Restoration the surveyor of the press, Roger L'Estrange, established that Chapman was involved with Thomas Brewster, Francis Smith, and Giles Calvert in publishing opposition literature such as <span class="italic">The Phoenix of the Solemn League and Covenant</span> and the <span class="italic">Annus mirabilis</span> pamphlets. This led to Chapman's imprisonment in Ludgate in May 1661, although works continued to appear under his name. In 1662 he fled abroad, returning under the protection of Secretary Morice. Warrants were issued in March and April 1663 for the arrest of Chapman and his landlord, Mr Leonard, and for the seizure of his printing instruments and materials. By November 1663 he was in prison for seditious practices. Hannah petitioned in January and March 1664 to be allowed access to him in the Gatehouse where, despite an order of 31 March that he be moved to Scarborough Castle, he remained until May when he was released on a bond of &pound;300 for his and his wife's good behaviour.<br>
<br>By 1664, perhaps for financial reasons, the Chapmans had moved to an address in Exchange Alley in Cornhill and new publications were few. Chapman's last publication, Henry Jessey's <span class="italic">Miscellanea sacra</span>, was in 1665. With his career as a publisher ended, he continued as a retailer, selling translations of the classics and patent medicines. Francis Smith later remarked that &#145;by continued imprisonments, he and his family [were] ruined&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 7.958). The date of his death is unknown.<br>
