<span class="headword">Pether,  Abraham</span>  (1756&#150;1812), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, a cousin of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22034/', "William Pether")</script>, was born at Chichester. As a child he showed a great talent for music, and at the age of nine played the organ in one of the Chichester churches. Adopting art as his profession, he became a talented pupil of George Smith (1713/14&#150;1776). He painted river and mountain scenery, with classical buildings, in a style somewhat resembling that of Richard Wilson; but his reputation rests on moonlight subjects, which earned him the sobriquet of Moonlight Pether. He painted, with attention to harmony of colour, the combination of moonlight and firelight, as in <span class="italic">Eruption of Vesuvius</span>, <span class="italic">Ship on Fire in a Gale at Night</span>, and <span class="italic">An Ironfoundry by Moonlight</span>. Pether was a frequent exhibitor at both the free and the incorporated societies from 1773 to 1791, and at the Royal Academy from 1784 to 1811. His <span class="italic">Harvest Moon</span>, which was shown at the academy in 1795, was highly praised. He had an extensive knowledge of scientific subjects, and in his moonlight pictures the astronomical conditions are always correctly observed. He was also a skilled mechanic, constructing optical instruments for his own use, and lectured on electricity. Although his art was popular, Pether was never able to do more than supply the daily needs of his large family, and, incapacitated by a lingering disease which eventually caused his death, he was reduced to great poverty. He died at Southampton on 13 April 1812, leaving destitute a widow, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. in or after 1812), and nine children; the fact that they were unable to obtain any assistance from the Artists' Benevolent Fund provoked a fierce attack upon the management of the society. Abraham Pether is sometimes known as Old Pether, to distinguish him from his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22032/', "Sebastian Pether")</script>.<br>
