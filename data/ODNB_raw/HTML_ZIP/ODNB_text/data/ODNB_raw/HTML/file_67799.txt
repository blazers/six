<span class="headword">Walton,  Frederick Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1834, <em>d.</em> 1928), <span class="occ">inventor of linoleum</span>, was baptized on 19 May 1834 in Sowerby Bridge, near Halifax, Yorkshire, the second son and second child in the family of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28654/', "James Walton (1802/3&#150;1883)")</script>, engineer, and his wife, Ann Kenworthy. He was educated in Bradford and Wakefield, and spent some time in France and Belgium before entering into partnership with his father and elder brother in Haughton Dale, near Manchester, manufacturing India rubber wire cards for carding cotton. On 19 March 1867 he married Alice Ann (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1886), daughter of Thomas Scruby, veterinary surgeon; they had one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>For five years Walton was involved in many experiments, and it was while trying to make a quick-drying paint for use in oilcloth manufacture that he discovered oxidized linseed oil, a new elastic mass with a rubbery consistency, when he realized that an open tin of paint had developed a skin similar to rubber. He patented a process for exposing linseed oil to air, enabling it to absorb oxygen and solidify, in 1860.<br>
<br>In 1860 Walton sold his partnership to his father, moved to London, and established his own works in Chiswick, where he continued his experiments. Many people had been trying to produce a durable floorcloth, and patents had been taken out for floor coverings containing India rubber, including Kamptulicon, patented in 1844, a thick floor covering made of rubber and cork. Walton worked on substituting oxidized oil for the rubber, and in 1863 he made the first piece of what he called linoleum (from the Latin <i>linum</i>, linen thread, and <i>oleum</i>, oil), from a mixture of oxidized linseed oil, gum, resin, and ground cork, rolled out on the back of a piece of hessian. This was patented in 1864. He moved to a larger factory in Staines, setting up a company which became the Linoleum Manufacturing Company. Although sales were slow at first, once he began advertising in London railway stations that linoleum was &#145;warm, soft, and durable&#146;, and opened a showroom at 67 Newgate Street, sales increased, and linoleum became a popular floor covering in the home, while its use gradually spread to offices and public buildings such as hospitals, because it was easy to clean and hard-wearing. In 1872 Walton went to New York to set up the American Linoleum Company on Staten Island, and he ran it for two years. His patents expired in 1877, but despite his attempt to retain the exclusive right to use the name linoleum, the High Court ruled in 1878 that linoleum was the name of a material, and not the name of the product of one company. This meant that leading floorcloth manufacturers such as Nairns of Kirkcaldy and Williamsons of Lancaster were able to use the name, and they contributed to the rapid growth of the British linoleum industry.<br>
<br>Walton retired from active management of the company in 1878, although he remained the largest shareholder. In 1877 he patented a method for embossing fabrics suitable for wall and ceiling decoration. Production of Lincrusta-Walton began in Sunbury-on-Thames in 1878, and he also set up companies in Paris and Hanover. Inlaid or mosaic linoleum, patented in 1888 and 1890, was Walton's other major invention. The Greenwich Inlaid Linoleum Company, formed in 1894, was very profitable until 1914, but was taken over by Nairns in 1922.<br>
<br>Walton was an inventor rather than a businessman. He took out eighty-eight British patents, the last in 1914, two-thirds of which concerned oxidized linseed oil. The others ranged from meat extracts and artificial ebonite to wheels for motor vehicles and aircraft components. His development of flexible metallic tubing proved important in oil extraction. About 1922 Walton moved to Nice, where he wrote <span class="italic">The Infancy and Development of Linoleum Floorcloth</span> (1925), and pursued his hobbies of watercolour painting and reading poetry. He was killed in a car accident in Nice on 16 May 1928, and buried there at La Caucada cemetery in August. Picasso became interested in working in linoleum and admired Walton's invention.<br>
