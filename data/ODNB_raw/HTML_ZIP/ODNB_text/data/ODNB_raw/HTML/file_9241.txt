<span class="headword">Featherston,  Isaac Earl</span>  (1813&#150;1876), <span class="occ">politician in New Zealand</span>, the fourth son of Thomas Featherston, a wealthy retail grocer of Newcastle upon Tyne, and his wife, Jane Earl, was born at Newcastle on 21 March 1813. He was educated at a private school in Tamworth and at Edinburgh University, from which he graduated MD in 1836. He then travelled for some years to improve his health (he suffered from consumption). On 10 December 1839 he married Bethia Campbell Scott (<i>d</i>. 1864); they had four sons and eight daughters.<br>
<br>With the intention of emigrating, Featherston took a position as surgeon-superintendent on board a New Zealand Company ship which left England in December 1840; he settled at Wellington, where he began to practise medicine. He soon became conspicuous by advocating the cause of the settlers who had purchased land under the New Zealand Company, and in 1852, when their claims were admitted, his services were recognized by the presentation of an address and a piece of plate. He also played a leading role in the Wellington Constitutional Association, which pressed for self-government for the settlers, and he supported the <span class="roman">New Zealand Constitution Act</span>, which was passed by the imperial parliament in 1852. He welcomed the considerable powers which the act conferred on the superintendents of the new provinces. In 1853 Featherston was elected superintendent of the province of Wellington, a post he retained by constant re-election until his appointment as agent-general in 1871. Under the new act he was also elected to the general assembly as a representative, at first for Wanganui and then, from 1855, for the city of Wellington. In the general assembly he became known as one of the most determined supporters of &#145;provincialism&#146;. After failing to form a government in 1856, he concentrated on a career in politics at the provincial level, and he held office in the general government only twice&#151;for a month in 1861 and as minister without portfolio from 1869 to 1871.<br>
<br>Featherston was a strong critic of the Stafford government's policies regarding the acquisition of land from the Maori that led to war in 1861 over the Waitara dispute. He was worried about the unsettling effects of these policies on race relations generally, and especially in Wellington province. He also feared the increased power of the general government resulting from the war policy, and he became renowned for the skill of his diplomacy in keeping the peace. On the renewal of the war in 1863 he used his influence to persuade the Maori of the province of Wellington not to join the &#145;rebels&#146;. In 1865 he accompanied General Chute in his Taranaki campaign and led a contingent of Maori &#145;loyalists&#146; in several engagements, for which he was awarded the New Zealand cross for bravery.<br>
<br>Featherston assisted in establishing and developing the lines of steam communication between Australia and New Zealand. In 1869 he was sent as representative of the colony to Australia to urge the necessity of retaining troops in New Zealand, and the following year he went as one of two special commissioners to England for the same purpose. In 1871 he was appointed New Zealand's first agent-general; much of his work in this post involved the recruitment of migrants under Julius Vogel's immigration programme. He held the office until his death, at Brighton, Sussex, on 19 June 1876.<br>
<br>Featherston was a formidable politician who fought determinedly and skilfully for what he believed in. He was on the losing side in the struggle to retain the provincial system, and his principal achievement was the promotion of settlement in the southern half of the North Island.<br>
