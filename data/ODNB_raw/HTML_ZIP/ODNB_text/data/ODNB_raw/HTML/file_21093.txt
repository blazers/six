<span class="headword">Page,  Frederick</span>  (1769&#150;1834), <span class="occ">writer on the poor laws</span>, was born in Newbury, Berkshire, the son of Francis Page. He matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford, on 14 July 1786 but left the university without taking a degree. Called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1792, he became a bencher in 1826. A substantial landowner, he was also interested in the development of the navigation of the River Thames and a major shareholder in the Kennet and Avon Canal Company.<br>
<br>Page's attention was first drawn to the poor laws by the manner in which the poor rate affected his own property. Having been assessed to the value of the whole amount of the tolls for the navigation of the Kennet between Reading and Newbury, which were collected by his agent, he appealed to the Berkshire quarter sessions, where the rate was confirmed. The case was later tried in the court of the king's bench in 1792, where the result was upheld.<br>
<br>Between 1794 and 1818 Page served as an overseer in three separate parishes of Berkshire and later he became a magistrate and then deputy lieutenant for the county of Berkshire. His practical experience of administering relief in the difficult year of 1795 was communicated to his friend Sir F. M. Eden, who included it in his <span class="italic">The State of the Poor</span>, of 1797  (Eden, 1.576&#150;87). This account highlighted the difficulties which arose from the practice of subsidizing the wages of labourers in line with the price of bread adopted by the famous meeting of Berkshire magistrates at Speenhamland that year. This mode of relief, Page argued, encouraged idleness in the labourer by removing the necessity of finding additional sources of income and also produced a perverse effect upon the labour market by allowing farmers to retain labourers at less than the market rate, passing their costs on to the community as a whole.<br>
<br>Page continued to study the influence of the poor laws and became an active participant in the debates leading up to their eventual reform in 1834. He favoured an improved organization of the existing model of the poor law through such means as the <span class="roman">Select Vestries Act</span> which facilitated a growing professionalism in pauper management, and retained the belief that local administration provided the most effective model for judicious and economical relief. In opposition to the more radical critics of the poor law, including Malthus, Page defended its moral basis and its practical efficacy in comparison to other systems. To this end he engaged in historical and comparative researches into the principles of relief, travelling to Ireland and more widely in continental Europe, and published two works which set out his comprehensive views on the subject: <span class="italic">The Principles of the English Poor Laws Illustrated and Defended</span> (1822), and <span class="italic">Observations on the State of the Indigent Poor in Ireland</span> (1830). Page died at Newbury on 8 April 1834. In his will he named among the beneficiaries his wife, Sarah.<br>
