<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Vivian,  Valentine Patrick Terrell</span>  (1886&#150;1969), <span class="occ">intelligence officer</span>, was born in Kensington on 17 March 1886, one of four sons and five daughters of (Thomas) Comley Vivian, a portrait painter of 80 Warwick Gardens, and his wife, Elizabeth Baly Farquhar (<i>b</i>. 1846). Comley Vivian exhibited at the Society (later Royal Society) of British Artists in 1874&#150;5 and at the Royal Academy between 1877 and 1892. Valentine Vivian's mother, the daughter of William Farquhar, inventor and chronometer maker, was a miniaturist and, later, portrait painter who exhibited at the Royal Academy under her maiden name between 1867 and 1871, and under her married (and widowed) name between 1886 and 1918.<br>
<br>Like his elder brother Percy (Sylvanus Percival (1880&#150;1958), registrar-general 1921&#150;45, knighted 1937) Vivian was educated at St Paul's School, where he was a foundation scholar in classics; he left in 1905. Intended for a curatorship at the Victoria and Albert Museum, he went instead to India, in 1906, and joined the Indian police in the Punjab. In 1910, still in the Punjab, he was transferred to the small provincial criminal intelligence staff, under a deputy inspector-general, that had been established as a result of Sir Andrew Fraser's police commission of 1903. Vivian served in the Punjab until 1914 and, while there, married, on 14 November 1911, Mary Primrose (1890&#150;1971), daughter of the Venerable Edmund John Warlow, archdeacon of Lahore. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>In 1914 Vivian was appointed to the government of India's central department of criminal intelligence in Simla, as an assistant director. The department, established in 1904 as one of Curzon's reforms, co-ordinated but did not direct the work of the provincial departments of criminal intelligence. It also took an interest in seditious activity outside India. Vivian saw active service in the Indian army in Palestine and Turkey in 1918&#150;19. He was mentioned in dispatches and appointed OBE in 1918.<br>
<br>By 1920 Vivian was holding an ostensibly military intelligence appointment as a major at the headquarters of the general officer commanding, allied forces, Constantinople. His post was in fact jointly sponsored by the government of India, anxious about the threat of pan-Islamism, and by the section of the War Office known as MI1c, a label for Mansfield Cumming's Secret Service Bureau, about to become the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS). Vivian became actively involved in the latter's operations to gain intelligence on Soviet subversive activity in Turkey and Persia. His work must have been sufficiently successful to catch Cumming's eye, for he was promoted CBE in 1923, the year in which he joined SIS, one of the last officers to be personally appointed by Cumming. In his later career he was often referred to by his initials, V. V.<br>
<br>Reluctant to stay overseas after so long abroad, Vivian undertook a short tour of duty with the Allied Control Commission in Cologne and then returned to SIS headquarters in 1925 as head (and for many years the only officer) of section V (counter-espionage). As early as 1921 SIS had circulated annual reports on &#145;Bolshevism, Chinese communism and anarchism&#146;. Under Vivian section V concentrated upon the subversive aspects of Soviet communism, in particular the clandestine activities of the Comintern. He was ideally suited to this task both by experience and temperament and brought to his post habits of meticulous casework and attention to detail acquired in India. The professional experience of Constantinople had also given him first-hand knowledge of Soviet clandestine activity. The mental discipline of a classical education may also have helped.<br>
<br>Later, in 1933, when Johann Heinrich deGraff (known as Jonny), a Comintern agent, offered his services to Frank Foley, the SIS representative in Berlin, Vivian was dispatched by Admiral Sinclair, Cumming's successor, to oversee the handling of the case. As deGraff moved to Manchuria, then to Shanghai, and finally to Brazil he kept Vivian, his case officer, abreast of Comintern activity. Thus by 1938 the British government was completely informed about the internal effect of Stalin's purges on the leadership of the Comintern. Furthermore deGraff's intelligence had also substantially contributed to the failure of the Comintern's 1935 armed conspiracy (orchestrated by deGraff and led by Luis Carlos Pestes) to overthrow the government of President Vargas in Brazil. This was a major success, both for SIS and for Vivian personally.<br>
<br>In 1939 Vivian, now fifty-three and more accustomed to a small service run on a shoestring, handed over the expanding section V to Felix Cowgill. Thus the successes of the war-time section V, based upon the exploitation of German intelligence service communications, were achieved under Cowgill, some of whose junior officers failed to recognize Vivian's role in securing the survival of the section and the relevance of its counter-intelligence experience between the wars. Vivian was promoted to the uneasy triumvirate at the top of SIS as nominal deputy to Sinclair's successor, Sir Stewart Menzies. The other member was the acerbic Claude Dansey, cheese to Vivian's chalk and no believer in counter-intelligence.<br>
<br>Vivian did not have a second good war. His CMG (1947) came long after Foley's (1941) and was eclipsed by Dansey's knighthood. He retired, finally, in 1951, after a number of anomalous appointments in security policy. It is ironical that he retired just at the time that the Soviet Union had resumed its position as SIS's major opponent. The policy of attacking its intelligence apparatus, rooted in Vivian's pre-war penetration of the Comintern, led to considerable success, though it took a decade or more to re-acquire his experience and skills. In this sense Vivian was a man ahead of his time.<br>
<br>Vivian, in his old age, did not escape the controversy that surrounded the treachery of (Harold) &#145;Kim&#146; Philby. He was attacked, with cruel hindsight, for fostering Philby's SIS career. He had known the father, St John Philby, as a self-opinionated assistant commissioner in the Punjab, and his wife had been a childhood friend of St John Philby's wife, Dora. He had thus taken an avuncular interest in the young Philby. But the defects of attitude and approach within SIS that failed to recognize the flaws in Philby or to detect their consequences were as much systemic as personal. Nevertheless the effect on Vivian made an already reserved personality more austere.<br>
<br>Valentine Vivian died at the War Memorial Hospital, Milford-on-Sea, on 15 April 1969. His elder son, John Michael Comley Vivian (1917&#150;1979), was a member of the diplomatic service.<br>
