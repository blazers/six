<span class="headword">Temple <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>MacLeod]</span>,  Olive Susan Miranda</span>  (1880&#150;1936), <span class="occ">traveller and author</span>, was born on 18 February 1880, the second of the two daughters of Sir Reginald MacLeod of MacLeod (1847&#150;1935), twenty-seventh chief of clan and <i>rentier</i>, and his wife, Lady Agnes Mary Cecilia (<i>d</i>. 1921), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20328/', "Stafford Henry Northcote, first earl of Iddesleigh (1818&#150;1887)")</script>, politician and author. Her elder sister was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57013/', "Dame Flora MacLeod (1878&#150;1976)")</script>. The twenty-fifth chief had encumbered his estates, giving aid during times of famine, and consequently the land-based fortune of the MacLeods had dwindled to the point where poverty had driven them from their seat of 800 years, Dunvegan Castle, on the island of Skye. Olive's father was therefore faced with the task of building his own fortune if the MacLeods were to retain their historic pre-eminence. Sir Reginald achieved this through his investments in the City of London, the great success of which eventually returned the family to Dunvegan. These early lessons in social responsibility and the realities of economic survival may well have helped to forge Olive's remarkable character which was to fascinate all who met her.<br>
<br>Olive MacLeod grew up in a warm and intellectually stimulating atmosphere, but her heart was always set on adventure. At first this was by proxy through her relationship with Boyd Alexander (1873&#150;1910), the African traveller and ornithologist whom she met in 1908. Olive, who had many admirers, was uncertain about Alexander's proposal of marriage, and he, a shy and lonely man, took her procrastination very badly. In his frustration Alexander began to plan a further trip to Africa, and it was only shortly before he was due to leave on 12 December 1908 that she finally agreed to marry him. At this point it was too late for Alexander to change his plans, and he proceeded to Africa, hoping to marry Olive on his return. Sadly, however, he was killed on the shores of Lake Chad on 3 May 1910 by hostile local inhabitants. Olive could not help but feel that if she had agreed to the marriage earlier, Alexander would not have died so tragically. Her friend Violet Asquith, who had also recently lost a fianc&eacute;, added to Olive's turmoil by persuading her that she was, to all intents and purposes, a widow. She consequently adopted the dress and demeanour of a bereaved wife&#151;much to the fascination of the sensationalist publications of the period. Her family detested Violet Asquith's influence, feeling that such hysteria was alien to Olive's real nature. Therefore, they fell with relief on Olive's plan to travel to Africa to place a stone on Alexander's grave, and her doting father arranged for her to be escorted by Captain and Mrs Amaury-Talbot (he had experience of Southern Nigeria as a district commissioner, later becoming an official anthropologist, and his wife published <span class="italic">Women's Mysteries of a Primitive People: the Ibidios of Southern Nigeria</span> in 1915). However, the romance of this journey only fuelled the interest of sensation-hungry journalists who covered the story in lurid detail&#151;with at one point Olive's death being incorrectly announced in most papers. In fact she travelled over 3700 miles through Africa, passing many places previously unvisited by a white woman. She also made useful recordings of many matters of botanical, ethnological, and zoological interest, publishing them later in her first book, <span class="italic">Chiefs and Cities of Central Africa</span> (1912).<br>
<br>During that journey Olive MacLeod met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63465/', "Charles Lindsay Temple (1871&#150;1929)")</script>, then chief secretary and acting governor of Northern Nigeria. Though Temple entertained Olive and her party at his residence, he refused her permission to travel up-country thinking the area too unsettled to be traversed by a white woman. Undeterred, Olive planned her own journey in secret, ignoring Temple's instructions. When he found out he was furious, but also fascinated by this enigmatic Scotswoman. Olive must have been equally intrigued for when, back in London, she heard that Temple was home on leave she went to some effort to contrive a meeting. Their marriage followed shortly afterwards, on 28 April 1912. Olive lived with Temple in Nigeria during the remainder of his service as well as travelling throughout Africa with him during his periods of leave. She continued to develop her interests in all aspects of African life, learned Hausa (the lingua franca of Northern Nigeria), and, during her visits to London, presented several serious papers, including one to the anthropological section of the British Association. She also published the data which she had gathered on Northern Nigeria between May 1912 and October 1916, taking full advantage of her privileged access to official documents, in her encyclopaedic compilation <span class="italic">Notes on the Tribes, Provinces, Emirates and States of the Northern Provinces of Nigeria</span> (1919). In addition, her private papers reveal a detailed knowledge and understanding of administrative life as well as an amused contempt for the first governor-general of Nigeria, Sir Frederick Lugard.<br>
<br>In 1917 Olive Temple travelled with her husband to South Africa, and from there to Granada where they lived until Charles's death on 9 January 1929. The anthropologist and travel writer Gerald Brenan (1894&#150;1987), who knew the Temples during their time in Spain, was struck by the gravity and weight of Olive's character, by her liberal broad-mindedness and painful honesty, but above all by her strong sense of responsibility. However, Brenan is probably incorrect in his suggestion that Olive totally subsumed her nature and ambitions under those of her husband&#151;such was the coincidence of their intellectual and artistic interests, to say nothing of the distinctly patrician outlook that they both unconsciously possessed. Following her husband's death, Olive returned to Britain, spending much of her time in Kent. She died on 16 May 1936 at Carmen de los Fosos, Granada, only a year after her much loved father, and was buried beside her husband in the cemetery near their house. Olive Temple was survived by an adopted daughter, Mary Edith Northcote.<br>
