<span class="headword">Broster,  Dorothy Kathleen</span>  (1877&#150;1950), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born at Grassendale Park, Garston, near Liverpool, on 2 September 1877, the eldest of the four children of Thomas Mawdsley Broster, shipowner, and his wife, Emily Kathleen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gething. She was educated privately until she was ten years old; she was then sent to a boarding-school near the coast in Lancashire. When her parents moved to Cheltenham she became, at the age of sixteen, a day girl at Cheltenham Ladies' College, where she was later followed by her two younger sisters, Phyllis and Barbara. She left school when she was nineteen with a scholarship to St Hilda's College, Oxford. She had a lively and intelligent mind and took second-class honours in modern history in 1900, but had to wait until 1920, when the first batch of Oxford women graduates at last were awarded their degrees; she then received her BA and MA simultaneously. At Cheltenham she made a number of friends, but she did not join very actively in the social life and was often seen as a somewhat aloof figure by her juniors. Later, at Oxford, she was known as a worrier, obsessed by the difficulties of daily living, the need to be ready for any and every emergency. Though she had a small circle of admiring friends, she was essentially a very private person and this trait continued throughout her life.<br>
<br>After passing her final examinations, Broster spent the next thirteen years as secretary to the regius professor of modern history at Oxford. During this time she published some poems and her first short story but she seemed to find it difficult to do any sustained work; finally, with the help of one of her college friends, Miss G. W. Taylor, she completed a long historical novel, <span class="italic">Chantemerle</span>, about the rising in the Vend&eacute;e after the French Revolution, and this was published in 1911. Two years later, in 1913, they published <span class="italic">The Vision Splendid</span>, which dealt with the Oxford Movement and the France of Louis Philippe.<br>
<br>At the start of the First World War, Broster registered for war work and found herself, at the end of 1914, nursing wounded Belgian soldiers. She spoke French fairly fluently, so in April 1916 she went to France with the British Red Cross and was stationed in Yvetot, where she cared for wounded French soldiers in an Anglo-American hospital. At new year 1916 she was invalided home with an infection that affected her knee joints; she did not return to France, though she did some further nursing later, in England.<br>
<br>The first novel Broster published as sole author was <span class="italic">Sir Isumbras at the Ford</span>; this had been started before the war and was finally published in 1918, and reflects her interest in the sea. It was followed by what she thought of as her best book, <span class="italic">The Yellow Poppy</span> (1920), and her favourite book, <span class="italic">The Wounded Name</span> (1922). All her early books were set in France and fictionalized various periods of French history, illustrating her continued interest in her earlier academic studies. In 1923, however, she spent five weeks visiting Lochaber in the Scottish highlands and this inspired her to write the trilogy about the Jacobite rising of 1745, for which she is perhaps best remembered: <span class="italic">The Flight of the Heron</span> (1925), <span class="italic">The Gleam in the North</span> (1927), and <span class="italic">The Dark Mile</span> (1929). Because she published as D. K. Broster, she was generally believed to be a man, and a Scotsman at that; she appeared to be somewhat flattered by this and never attempted to put the record straight.<br>
<br>After the war Broster lived for many years in the south-east of England, sharing a house with a friend, Gertrude Schlich, daughter of Sir William Schlich. She continued to produce novels at regular intervals; her last, <span class="italic">The Captain's Lady</span>, was published in 1947. She died on 7 February 1950, of lung cancer, in Bexhill Hospital and was cremated on 13 February at Charing crematorium, Kent.<br>
