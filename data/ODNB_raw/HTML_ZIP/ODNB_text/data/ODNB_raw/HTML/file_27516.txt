<span class="headword">Tomkins,  Thomas</span>  (1637/8&#150;1675), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Aldersgate Street, London, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27510/', "John Tomkins (1586&#150;1638)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27515/', "Tomkins, Thomas (1572&#150;1656)")</script>], organist of St Paul's and gentleman of the Chapel Royal, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Sylvanus Griffith, dean of Hereford Cathedral. Thomas's family connections&#151;notably his uncles, the musicians <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27515/', "Thomas Tomkins (1572&#150;1656)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27509/', "Giles Tomkins (b. after 1587, d. 1668)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27515/', "Tomkins, Thomas (1572&#150;1656)")</script>], as well as his father who died when he was an infant&#151;lay firmly within the world of the Caroline church and court. He &#145;was educated in virtue and learning from the cradle&#146; by his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27513/', "Nathaniel Tomkins (1599&#150;1681)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27515/', "Tomkins, Thomas (1572&#150;1656)")</script>], canon of Worcester Cathedral and a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Archbishop Laud  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.1046). Both Nathaniel and his father, the elder Thomas Tomkins, organist at Worcester, were ejected from their places by the parliamentarian authorities in 1646.<br>
<br>Tomkins matriculated from Balliol College, Oxford, on 12 May 1651, graduating BA on 13 February 1655 and proceeding MA on 6 July 1658. He was elected fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, in 1656, was university proctor in 1663, was incorporated at Cambridge in 1664, and proceeded BD at Oxford in 1665 and DD on 15 May 1675. At the Restoration he distinguished himself as a zealous royalist and churchman. He has been described as one of a stable of pamphleteers whom Gilbert Sheldon, bishop of London and later archbishop of Canterbury, sought to mould popular opinion against any possibility of comprehension within the Church of England or toleration of dissent. Tracts written by Tomkins, George Stradling, Samuel Parker, and others &#145;were tailored to suit the secular political terrain upon which these issues were fought&#146;  (Spurr, 48). In 1660 he published <span class="italic">The Rebels' Plea, or, Mr Baxter's Judgement Concerning the Late Wars</span>, in which he criticized with considerable force Baxter's theory of the constitution, as well as his defence of particular actions of parliament. This was followed the next year by <span class="italic">Short strictures, or, Animadversions on so much of Mr Crofton's &#145;Fastning St Peters bonds&#146; as concern the reasons of the University of Oxford concerning the covenant</span>, a pamphlet which Hugh Griffith in <span class="italic">Mr Crofton's Case Soberly Considered</span> termed &#145;frivolous, scurrilous and invective&#146;.<br>
<br>On 11 April 1665 Tomkins was admitted rector of St Mary Aldermary, London, and about the same time was appointed chaplain to Archbishop Sheldon and employed as an assistant licenser of books; with his move to London he resigned his fellowship at All Souls. In this capacity he nearly refused to licence <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> because he thought treasonable the lines:<blockquote>
<div>As when the Sun, new risen,<br>
</div>
<div>Looks through the horizontal, misty air,<br>
</div>
<div>Shorn of his beams, or from behind the moon,<br>
</div>
<div>In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds<br>
</div>
<div>On half the nations, and with fear of change<br>
</div>
<div>Perplexes monarchs:<br>
</div> (J. Milton, <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>, I)</blockquote>This is Tomkins's main claim on the interest of posterity, and the cause of no little censure, although he overcame his misgivings and granted his imprimatur some time before 20 August 1667.<br>
<br>On 18 July 1667 Tomkins was appointed rector of Great Chart in Kent, and in the same year published a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Inconveniences of Toleration</span>. On 8 November 1669 he was installed chancellor and prebendary at Exeter, and three weeks later, on 30 November, was instituted rector of Lambeth, Surrey, all of which preferments he held until his death, resigning his two former livings. The Lambeth living came, according to Wood, because Archbishop Sheldon &#145;valued him so much that he kept him many years chaplain in his house, and resolving never to part with him, made him rector of Lambeth&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.1046). In 1672 Tomkins added a further living when he was instituted rector of Monks Risborough, Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>Tomkins's career as licenser and polemicist continued. On 2 July 1670 he licensed Milton's <span class="italic">Paradise Regained</span> and <span class="italic">Samson Agonistes</span>. In 1675 he published <span class="italic">The modern pleas for comprehension, toleration, and the taking away the obligation to the renouncing of the covenant considered and discussed</span>. Another edition appeared in 1680 with the title <span class="italic">The new distemper, or, The dissenter's usual pleas for comprehension, toleration and the renouncing of the covenant, consider'd and discuss'd</span>.<br>
<br>Tomkins died at Exeter on 20 August 1675, aged thirty-seven, and was buried in the chancel of the church at Martin Hussingtree, Worcestershire, the parish where his cousin Nathaniel lived. A memorial plaque celebrated him as a staunch defender of the Church of England &#145;contra schismatices&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.1047). Administration of his estate was granted to his brother John. Besides his polemical writings he composed some commendatory verses prefixed to Edmund Elys's <span class="italic">Die pomata</span> (1665). He is sometimes said to have edited <span class="italic">Musica Deo sacra at ecclesiae Anglicanae</span> (1668), composed by his uncle Thomas, in spite of there being &#145;no proof that this eminent and learned divine had any great knowledge of music or deep interest in it&#146;  (Stevens, 69). Nathaniel, the elder Thomas's son, is a more likely candidate.<br>
