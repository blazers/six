<span class="headword">Cockin,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1736, <em>d.</em> 1801), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and writer</span>, was the son of Marmaduke Cockin (1712&#150;1754), a schoolmaster, and his wife, Elizabeth (1716&#150;1770), and was baptized at Burton in Kendal, Westmorland, on 6 September 1736. His father died when he was eighteen so he supported his family for several years. In 1764, following an unhappy period teaching in London boarding-schools, Cockin was appointed writing master and accountant at Lancaster grammar school. Here he influenced the broadening of the curriculum and originated a poetic tradition.<br>
<br>From 1784 Cockin taught at the Revd John Blanchard's Nottingham Academy, where one of his pupils was George Pryme, the economist. Cockin retired to Burton in 1792 to devote himself to literary pursuits. His friends included the artist George Romney, the physician John Dawson, Dr Thomas Wilson, of Clitheroe, and Dr John James, of Arthuret. Cockin successively became Romney's companion at Hampstead and his amanuensis at Kendal.<br>
<br>In the belief that no systematic school mathematical book existed, Cockin published <span class="italic">A Rational and Practical Treatise of Arithmetic</span> (1766). His important work on elocution dedicated to David Garrick, <span class="italic">The Art of Delivering Written Language</span> (1775), reflected his own &#145;mild and impressive&#146; elocution and the &#145;fluency and judgement&#146; of his wide-ranging conversation  (Romney, 276).<br>
<br>Having assisted Thomas West in the compilation of his ground-breaking <span class="italic">Guide to the Lakes</span> (1778), Cockin enlarged two editions of this work which influenced Wordsworth's guide of 1810. Cockin's pride in great men of Lakeland led to his <span class="italic">Ode to the Genius of the Lakes</span> (1780) which was accompanied by short local biographies. Extraordinarily, he proposed here that inscribed pillars should be erected at Lakeland viewpoints in commemoration of significant visitors.<br>
<br>In 1777 Cockin corresponded with Joseph Banks regarding &#145;An extraordinary appearance in a mist&#146;, a description of a type of muted rainbow, which was published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 70, 1780, 157&#150;62) and was considered important by Joseph Priestley. His only independent scientific publication, <span class="italic">The Theory of the Syphon</span> (1781), refers to an invention known by the ancient Egyptians. Cockin's philosophical and religious writing includes <span class="italic">The Freedom of Human Action Explained and Indicated</span> (1775), which considers the opinions of Joseph Priestley, and <span class="italic">The Fall of Scepticism and Infidelity Predicted</span> (1788), written as an epistle to James Beattie. <span class="italic">Occasional Attempts in Verse</span> (1776), demonstrating Cockin's wit and capacity for self-mockery, collects verses to both Romney and Sir Isaac Newton while the posthumous collection of verse entitled <span class="italic">The Rural Sabbath</span> (1805) includes his &#145;Stanzas on the Death of Dr Johnson&#146;, which praises that critic's possession of &#145;Albion's gift&#146; (stanza 3). Cockin was not a brilliant poet himself but his verse is replete with mythological and spiritual references and hints at his disapproval of both industry and Sunday labour. He died at Romney's house at Milnthorpe Road, Kendal, on 30 May 1801 and was buried in the churchyard at Burton in Kendal on 2 June. Cockin's versatility militated against his prosperity but he was remembered for his generosity to the poor and for his shyness, modesty, and integrity.<br>
