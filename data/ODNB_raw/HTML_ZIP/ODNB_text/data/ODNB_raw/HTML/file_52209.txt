<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Koenig <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Tuckman]</span>,  Ghisha</span>  (1921&#150;1993), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 8 December 1921 at 81 St Mark's Road, Kensington, London, the younger of the two children of (Mendel) Leo Koenig (1898&#150;1970), art critic and writer, and his wife, Fanny Hildebrand (<i>fl</i>. 1900&#150;1940), formerly a Yiddish actress. The family was Jewish and culturally conscious, though not observant. Koenig adopted her father's strong left-wing politics&#151;&#145;The Zionists called him a Communist and the Communists called him a Zionist&#146;  (private information)&#151;and his immersion in the arts. Poverty notwithstanding, the family home was the centre of a circle of Jewish artists and writers, including the painters Josef Herman and David Bomberg, who became role models for Koenig. She was educated at Hendon county grammar school where, perhaps because of her lifelong ill health, caused by asthma, she failed to shine academically.<br>
<br>In 1939, defying advice from her school, Koenig won a scholarship to study sculpture at Hornsey College of Art. She joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service in 1942 and was posted to Leeds. She was transferred to London in 1944 to edit the army's <span class="italic">London Educational Bulletin</span>, which involved visiting factories to investigate work opportunities, a formative experience for her subsequent career. Determined to study with Henry Moore, she attended Chelsea School of Art from 1946 to 1948, before moving to the Slade School of Fine Art for a year. Moore discouraged her, as a woman, from practising sculpture&#151;which, given her obstinacy, was probably an important stimulus. On 5 January 1951 she married Emanuel (Manny) Tuckman (<i>b</i>. 1921/2), medical doctor and son of Lewis Tuckman, company director. Tuckman's practice took them to Kent, where he worked on a new housing estate in St Paul's Cray. They moved to Sidcup in 1967 and, on his retirement in 1986, to north London, where Koenig worked in the studio previously owned by the sculptor Naum Gabo.<br>
<br>A solitary worker, Koenig never used assistants but relied on Tuckman for much essential help, from lifting to casting and burnishing. She was a perfectionist, obsessively devoted to her work, which she recorded meticulously. Tuckman's support enabled her to work single-mindedly even after their daughter, Sarah, was born in 1955. The working process that Koenig initiated in 1951 was precisely attuned both to the circumstances of her life and to her political orientation. Both Koenig and Tuckman were consistently left-wing politically; if not members of the Communist Party, they were for a time far from unsympathetic to it. Koenig sold the <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span> outside University College, London. They were politically active, taking part in the first Aldermaston march in 1958, and later holding Labour Party ward meetings in their home. Koenig would spend weeks or months at a local factory with a manual labour force involved in a craft process such as paper making or button carding. She worked in at least ten such factories, the first being the vegetable parchment mills in St Mary Cray. She habitually sketched each stage of the production process, then made enlarged working drawings in the studio as the basis of her reliefs and free-standing figures. They were made in terracotta and sometimes cast in bronze. <span class="italic">The Machine Minders</span> (mixed media, 1956; Tate collection), one of her largest free-standing groups, portrayed two men working at the Coates ink factory in St Mary Cray. Koenig modelled her figures on individual workers and though she never talked to them in the factory, she would invite them to see the completed work. She was best-known for such series of reliefs as <span class="italic">The Tentmakers</span> (bronze, terracotta, 1980). Either these followed the Renaissance model of figures in a stage-like illusory space, or much of the background was omitted, so that the figures were almost free-floating.<br>
<br>Belying her small stature and fragility, Koenig had a strong personality, emphasized by her oversize spectacles. Insecure but driven by ambition, she could be aggressive and short-tempered, though she was highly sociable and loved parties. Close friends included the historian Eric Hobsbawm who, as jazz critic of the <span class="italic">New Statesman &amp; Nation</span>, arranged for her to draw at a dance club in Oxford Street when she was commissioned in 1963 to make a dance trophy (<span class="italic">The Twisters</span>) for Arnold Wesker's Centre 42. She had a pronounced sense of humour and a taste for gossip, good food, and luxury items. She enjoyed theatre and travel; she and Tuckman made long trips to southern Europe and visited the United States several times.<br>
<br>Like many women artists of her generation, Koenig exhibited relatively little. Ferociously independent, she avoided professional groups and disliked the commercial art world, though Eric Estorick's Grosvenor Gallery, which she joined in 1963, did much to promote her work. The high point of her exhibiting career was an Arts Council retrospective at the Serpentine Gallery, London, in 1986, with a simultaneous exhibition of smaller works at Agi Katz's Boundary Gallery in north London. It was there that her memorial exhibition was held in April 1994. Virtually throughout her career, Koenig's work was unfashionable. Her small, narrative, profoundly socialist pieces defied the critical focus on very large abstract sculpture. Nevertheless the commissions, including portraits, that punctuated her career indicated that she was never entirely overlooked. Among the most memorable were <span class="italic">Crucifixion</span> (terracotta, 1961) for St John's, Earlsfield, arranged by Nevile Wallis, <span class="italic">The Observer</span>'s art critic, and the <span class="italic">Blind School</span> series (bronze, terracotta, 1985&#150;6) made at Dalton House School for the Blind, Sevenoaks, Kent, in which she recorded the school's many activities. Her last work was a relief based on children at a local sports centre in north London. She died of chronic bronchitis and emphysema on 15 October 1993 at University College Hospital, Camden, London, and was cremated at Golders Green. She was survived by her husband and daughter.<br>
