<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Finch,  John</span>, Baron Finch of Fordwich  (1584&#150;1660), <span class="occ">speaker of the House of Commons and judge</span>, was born on 17 September 1584 at Hoath Farm, Moat, Kent, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9436/', "Sir Henry Finch (c.1558&#150;1625)")</script>, lawyer, and his wife, Ursula, daughter of John Thwaites. The clergyman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9428/', "Edward Finch")</script> was a younger brother.<h2>
<a name="Earlylegalcareer"></a>Early legal career</h2>Finch was admitted to Gray's Inn on 5 February 1601 after a year at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and was called to the bar on 8 November 1611. The earl of Clarendon said that he &#145;led a free life on a restrained fortune&#146; and &#145;a good wit and natural parts, without the superstructure of much knowledge in the profession by which he was to grow&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 1.130). He was part of the student population that has been characterized as an &#145;ornamental but essentially irrelevant appendage&#146;  (Prest, 40). Finch himself, on his installation as lord chief justice in 1634, publicly confessed before the benchers of Gray's Inn that the first six years of his pupillage were mainly devoted to pursuits other than the study of law  (BL, Sloane MS 1455, fol. 10<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>In 1612 he married his first cousin Eleanor, daughter of George Wyatt; she died in 1623 and in 1627 he married Mabel (<i>d</i>. 1669), daughter of Charles Fotherby, dean of Canterbury. Finch's only child was a daughter from his first marriage, who was contracted in marriage to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22980/', "Sir George Radcliffe")</script> of the privy council of Ireland but died aged ten about 1621.<br>
<br>In 1617 Finch was elected a bencher of his inn. Chosen assistant reader in June, he was selected as reader on 15 May 1618 and began his summer term lectures on 1 August. He was also appointed recorder of Canterbury in 1617, but was refused entry to the position by the corporation. In a letter dated 4 January 1619 to Lord Zouche, warden of the Cinque Ports, Finch solicited his help with the privy council for a mandamus against the corporation for his reinstatement. The corporation refused to obey the order. On 19 May 1620 its members wrote to the archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Zouche praying that they might not be compelled to re-elect him, as it would be &#145;against their consciences and their charter, and greatly to the disquiet of the city&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1619&#150;23</i>, 146). The members changed their minds, however, on 28 May, humbly informing the council that they were willing to re-elect Finch as their recorder, craving &#145;pardon for discontenting their lordships&#146;  (ibid., 148). But he held the position for only another year.<br>
<br>Finch remained an active member of Gray's Inn. He was elected dean of the chapel on 27 January 1625. Appointed king's counsel on 17 March 1626, he was elected treasurer of the inn in 1627, the same year in which he was elected high steward of Cambridge University. In the autumn of 1633 the inns of court provided a grand masque for the entertainment of the king and queen to testify their loyalty and protest against the austere views published by William Prynne in his <span class="italic">Histrio-Mastix</span> that year. Finch was elected as Gray's Inn representative to the committee of management. The performance, which took place on Candlemas (2 February) 1634, is described by Bulstrode Whitelocke as a splendid pageant. Finch was subsequently deputed to convey the thanks of the members of the inns to the king and queen for their gracious reception of the masquers.<br>
<br>The young lawyer was patronized by Sir Francis Bacon from 1614. He defended Bacon's impeachment as lord chancellor in 1621, and became executor of his estate at his death in 1626. He inherited Bacon's library, and was given his chambers at Gray's Inn. Many of Bacon's books were among those that Finch, one of the earliest donors of a collection to the inn, gave in 1634 upon his election as serjeant on 9 October. Throughout these years Finch earned the respect of his colleagues for trying to advance Bacon's programme for law reform. In a controversial incident of 1629 he requested in chancery that an enrolled order be amended. Sir John Salter, master in chancery, called this request an &#145;insolent carriage towards a court of justice&#146;  (Birch, 1.22) and got Finch &#145;put out of the commons&#146;&#151;deprived of his residence rights. The benchers of the Inn rebelled, and invited Finch to dine with them daily as their guest  (Prest, 104).<h2>
<a name="Earlyparliamentarycareer"></a>Early parliamentary career</h2>In 1614 and 1620 Finch was elected MP for Canterbury. He was returned to parliament for Winchelsea in February 1624, but was unseated by a petition that claimed certain voters had been excluded by the mayor. A new writ was issued on 19 March, and he was re-elected. He exchanged Winchelsea for Canterbury at the election of 1625. The king visited Canterbury on 25 May 1625, and again with the queen on 13 June. Finch addressed them as recorder with fulsome adulation, and both were reported to be highly impressed. In 1626 he was knighted and appointed king's counsel and queen's attorney-general, receiving an unprecedented grant from the queen's jointure. He returned to sit for Canterbury in the parliaments of 1626 and 1628.<br>
<br>On 17 March 1628 Finch was elected speaker of the House of Commons. His speech to the throne, couched in the language of the most extravagant loyalty, nevertheless concluded with three petitions: that the house might be assured of the immunity of its members from arrest, that freedom of debate might be respected, and that access to the royal person might be granted on suitable occasions. He spoke at length on the tyranny of the pope, and on foreign problems with the Dutch, Austrians, and the Turks being more important than domestic ones. Later, in addressing the Lords, he spoke eloquently on the virtues of hereditary sovereignty, and the king as an orb of the sun.<br>
<br>On 14 April Finch presented a petition against the practice of billeting soldiers in the homes of private citizens. Realizing perhaps that the king would not take this kindly, he closed with the comment: &#145;Sir, you are the breath of our nostrils, and the light of our eyes&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 2.282). On 5 May he conveyed to the king the answers of the Commons to various royal messages, in particular to the king's demand to know whether the house would be content with his promise to redress their grievances. Finch expressed, on behalf of the Commons, their entire confidence in the royal word, and their settled conviction that &#145;no less than a public remedy will raise the dejected hearts&#146; of the people  (ibid., 2.346).<br>
<br>The censure of the duke of Buckingham was particularly difficult for Finch. In the debate on the royal message of 5 June 1628, enjoining the Commons not to meddle with affairs of state, Sir John Eliot rose to rebut the implied charge of casting aspersions on royal ministers. Finch responded, with tears in his eyes, &#145;there is a command laid upon me to interrupt any that should go about to lay aspersion on the ministers of state&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 2.402). He advised the house on 11 June that Buckingham should not be named as the author of excessive power and evil, unable to understand how a man elected for the reward of service could be ruined by the same. Eliot sat down, and the house resolved itself into a committee of public safety. Finch then went to the king, from whom he brought a conciliatory message. On this occasion Finch seems to have acted as a mediator between king and Commons. Sir Robert Philips, who replied to the royal message on behalf of the house, lauded Finch as one who had &#145;not only at all times discharged the duty of a good speaker, but a good man&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/106/55). Afterwards Finch was flummoxed when the king ended the parliamentary session without his foreknowledge in June. In September and October Finch investigated the circumstances in the assassination of Buckingham with Attorney-General Sir Robert Heath.<br>
<br>Parliament met again in January 1629. On 25 February Finch delivered a message from the king commanding its adjournment. Several members objected that the adjournment was a matter for the Commons to decide. Sir John Eliot proceeded to present a remonstrance on the subject of tonnage and poundage, which Finch refused to read. Eliot then read it himself. Finch, however, refused to put the question. Rising to adjourn the debate, he was forced back into the chair and held there by Denzil Holles and others, Holles swearing, &#145;God's wounds he should sit still till it pleased them to rise&#146;. Finch burst into tears, exclaiming, &#145;I will not say, I will not, but I dare not&#146;, reminding the house that &#145;he had been their faithful servant, and would sacrifice his life for the good of his country; but he durst not sin against the express command of his sovereign&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 2.488&#150;90). Coke called him a spy of the king, and his fellow MPs from Kent berated his failure to fulfil his office. Meanwhile, behind locked doors, the substance of Eliot's remonstrance was adopted by the house and declared as carried. Parliament was dissolved shortly afterwards, not to meet again for eleven years.<h2>
<a name="Judicialcareercourtofcommonpleas"></a>Judicial career: court of common pleas</h2>Finch was appointed chief justice of the court of common pleas on 16 October 1634, a surprise appointment but for his election as serjeant a few days before. He replaced Sir Robert Heath, who was removed from the bench on 14 September after Attorney-General William Noy's death and Sir John Bankes's appointment. These changes inspired a legal wit to phrase the following couplet:<blockquote>
<div>Noy's floods are past, the Banks appear,<br>
</div>
<div>The Heath is cropt, the Finch sings there.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1634&#150;5</i>, 221)</blockquote>The latter refers to his speeches. Both his acceptance speech and address to Gray's Inn were so filled with flattery that some contemporaries considered them obnoxious. Finch had already as king's counsel and queen's attorney-general served the crown by producing arguments for privy council debates on the exercise of the royal prerogative in various areas. In producing the vast extent of the forests of England at the time of Edward I he delivered a speech on the laws of the Forest of Dean to the king at Gloucester Castle on 10 July 1634.<br>
<br>Finch's career as a common lawyer was politically at odds with Sir Edward Coke. Their animosity developed in the parliament of 1621, when for ten hours a day they sat on a committee to survey all the statutes. Throughout the 1630s Finch defended the jurisdiction of the conciliar and prerogative courts. He believed, like Sir John Davies, that the common law was custom, and common-law courts were part of a wide range of customary and statutory courts in a pluralistic legal system. Later he faced considerable criticism because he had agreed not to appoint officers of the court without the king's approval. This request was seen as an extraordinary exercise of royal interference in the court's business. So too was his conduct at the Essex assizes in 1635, where he extended the boundaries of the king's forest against local custom, and at the Devon assizes in 1639, where he denounced the treachery of a grand jury finding on a ship-money case.<br>
<br>The famous case on the legality of ship money, <i>R. v. Hampden</i>, was put before the judges in the exchequer chamber on 12 February 1637. Their unanimous opinion was that the king had an uncontrolled discretion in levying the tax. During the trial Finch interrupted Hampden's counsel often and spoke openly in court against the accused. According to Clarendon, Finch was mainly responsible for the opinion, arguing strenuously against his fellow judges Sir George Croke and Sir Richard Hutton, and carrying the majority of his colleagues. He delivered a long and somewhat rambling judgment, concluding with the statement that &#145;I conceive upon common law, and the fundamental policy of the kingdom, that the king may charge his subjects for the defence of the kingdom &hellip; when it is in danger&#146;, and &#145;that the king is sole judge of the danger&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 3.1243). Clarendon said that the judgment made ship money &#145;more abhorred and formidable than all the commitments by the council table, and all the distresses taken by the sheriffs in England&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 1.127). Later, in 1639, Finch prevented a protest against ship money on grounds of &#145;common liberty&#146; from going forward at the Exeter assizes  (Sharpe, 428&#150;30).<br>
<br>What marked Finch's tenure as chief justice was his penchant for trying to persuade or threaten his fellow judges to agree with him on the merits of the arguments before the court. Possessing the mind of a politician on the bench, he was often quick to judgment and used his eloquence, rather than legal reasoning, to convince his colleagues. The years he spent in socializing at the inns of court instead of attending moots and readings, and immersing himself in the original and secondary texts of law, took their toll on his legal reputation the more deeply he became involved in adjudication. He was, however, a prominent figure on the bench. He knew law, and contemporary laymen were impressed with his advocacy.<h2>
<a name="JudicialcareertheStarChamber"></a>Judicial career: the Star Chamber</h2>Finch was heavily employed in Star Chamber and high commission cases in the mid-1630s, a situation that was enhanced with his appointment as chancellor to the queen in 1636. He was engaged especially in the proceedings against William Prynne in Star Chamber in 1633&#150;4, in which he charged him with a libel against the queen under the name of Herodius. On Prynne's second trial (1637) Finch surpassed himself in brutality. He drew the attention of the court to the fact that some remnants of Prynne's ears still remained, moving that they be cut closer and that he be stigmatized with the letters &#145;S.L.&#146; (seditious libeller) on his cheeks, which proposals were adopted.<br>
<br>Finch became well known for the height to which he carried the royal prerogative, as well as for the severity of his sentences. When James Maxwell and his wife, Alice, were found guilty (17 April 1635) of libelling the king and lord keeper, a fine of &pound;3000 each was proposed for the offence against king and lord keeper. Finch supported the lord chief baron's motion&#151;which was lost&#151;to add a whipping for the woman. In another Star Chamber case (27 January 1637), when Elmstone was sentenced to imprisonment and to stand in the pillory at Westminster, Finch moved to add that he lose his ears: that motion was lost as well. In 1638, in the case of John Langton, a subordinate official of the exchequer charged with abusing the royal prerogative, Finch doubled the fine of &pound;1000 proposed by Lord Cottington, and added the pillory, imprisonment, and disability to hold office, in which the rest of the court concurred (Archbishop Laud, however, was for raising the fine to &pound;5000).<br>
<br>Finch defended Laud in Bishop John Williams's suit against him for libel, and proposed the highest fine of all the judges. He also added a whipping to the sentence of fine, pillory, and mutilation proposed by Lord Cottington for Pickering, a Roman Catholic found guilty in 1638 of libelling the king and queen as Romanists and sacrilegiously converting part of a churchyard into a pigsty. Throughout he was conspicuously harsh on religious offenders. Once he became chairman of Star Chamber in 1640, his opening speeches warned the country of swarming rogues, treasonous villains, and the subversion of religion, law, and government.<h2>
<a name="Judicialcareerthechancery"></a>Judicial career: the chancery</h2>Finch was sworn of the privy council in March 1639, and promoted to lord keeper at the death of Coventry on 17 January 1640 through Henrietta Maria's influence. He rode to Westminster Hall in great estate, was given Durham House as his local residence, and the court of wards paid off the king's loans to him. His was not the most appropriate appointment, and it was much discussed. Sir Richard Cave wrote to Sir Thomas Roe on 7 February 1640: &#145;The lord keeper keeps such a clatter in his new place that they are more weary of him in the chancery than they were before in the common pleas&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1639&#150;40</i>, 436). On 7 April 1640 Finch was created Baron Finch of Fordwich, Kent. Sitting on the privy council, he presided over the House of Lords and Star Chamber.<br>
<br>The new lord keeper focused on extending the court's review of judicial procedure in lesser courts of equity, a problem that many contemporaries had complained of. But he was also accommodating to defendants who sought to restrict the scope of bills in equity. When Lady Cope sued in chancery for her husband's property after his death, Finch refused to hear her petition because it was insufficient in equity, and dismissed her summarily. Unfortunately for his reputation, the House of Lords overruled him and gave her judgment. When he did try to limit the continuation of common-law review of chancery cases that had already been curtailed by the privy council in 1616, he felt the opprobrium of some common lawyers. His use of stern language in his judgments, however, as in Sir William Russell's case of 1640, exacerbated his position. After allowing co-defendants a temporary injunction to try an issue of the case at common law, when the common pleas ruled for the defendants Finch stayed their verdicts, declaring the trial &#145;vexacious&#146;  (Hart, 111&#150;12).<h2>
<a name="TheShortandLongparliaments"></a>The Short and Long parliaments</h2>The Short Parliament of 1640 was opened by the king on 13 April with few words indicating the gravity of the situation. The lord keeper, therefore, was left to expatiate upon the major problems facing the country, which included the Scottish threat and the consequent necessity of obtaining immediate supplies. He enlarged upon these on 20 April, but with no effect. Sir Thomas Aston accused him of eulogizing the king, being impatient with members, inhibiting free speech, and not putting questions to the house (although the French ambassador said his expression was &#145;gracious, mild, and meek&#146;; Cope and Coates, 305). While the text of his speech was full of praise and glory for the king, Charles did not heed his advice on how to deal with the Scots  (Russell, 160).<br>
<br>The Commons resolved that grievances must take precedence over supply, and on 5 May parliament was dissolved. Finch composed <span class="italic">His majesties Declaration to all his loving subjects of the causes which moved him to dissolve the last parliament</span> (1640) to inform the public on why Charles dissolved parliament. A highly selective account, it focused on Charles's patience, good will, and desire to redress grievances, while omitting the named grievances and depicting the Commons as selfish and refusing to compromise. His own editing of the final draft made the distinction between the king's promises and members' refusal to compromise even stronger. Rekindling and perpetuating previous controversies from the tumult in the Commons in 1629, it stood as a focus of attack in the Long Parliament.<br>
<br>Finch was reported to be in poor health at this time but he moved on with considerably more focus and resolve than he had in earlier parliaments. He kept a firm hand on keeping members in order, steering committee reports and joint conferences, and reporting to the king. His speeches on the necessity of supply were more balanced and direct, and they were copied widely: that of 1 May before a joint conference of parliament was finely crafted and detailed, and provided suggestions to resolve the problem of grievances or supply. He still spoke, however, with too much generalization and excessive repetition. In the end he was seen as lacking force and using inadequate political tactics.<br>
<br>In the difficult months between the Short and Long parliaments, Finch supported the king's attempt to devalue the currency, dissuade a London petition calling for a parliament, and request a loan of &pound;200,000 for his troops. Finch gave a forecast of future royal policy when he told the queen that Charles would not adhere to any treaty longer than it was convenient to do so.<br>
<br>Finch was brought to his knees by the Long Parliament. His opening speech presented a one-sided history of England, with a glorious account of Charles and his wife. He seemed unprepared for the forty Commons committees for grievances. When a motion accused the earl of Strafford of treason, Charles asked Finch to prepare the defence. Finch, as lord keeper, was seen as Strafford's protector. Thus it is not surprising that the Commons exhibited articles of impeachment against Finch as chief justice of the court of common pleas and as lord keeper. The principal counts in the indictment for subverting the fundamental laws of the country were writing and publishing the <span class="italic">Declaration</span> after the dissolution of parliament, arbitrary conduct as speaker on Eliot's motion on tonnage and poundage, malpractices on the bench in 1635 for extending the royal forest in Essex, and his conduct in Hampden's case. He was accused of &#145;false and malicious slanders&#146; and working to &#145;incense his Majesty against parliaments&#146;  (Rushworth, 4.138).<br>
<br>Finch appeared at the bar of the House of Commons during the preliminary stage on 21 December and made an elaborate extemporaneous speech in his own defence that was both artful and eloquent. Unfortunately for him, the Commons had possession of the queen's letter to Catholic subjects for them to work with the king against the Scots, a letter written in Finch's hand. His friends in the house, however, delayed the vote until after noon, when the Lords left for the day. The Commons voted for his committal before the Lords for the next morning. That night, the lord keeper gave the great seal to the king and fled to the Netherlands before the order could be delivered. Perhaps he saw the writing on the wall when John Pym moved against the man who would have been Finch's son-in-law, Sir George Radcliffe, confidant of the earl of Strafford.<br>
<br>According to Clarendon the house was &#145;wonderfully indisposed to hear anything against&#146; Finch though Lord Falkland denounced him as the &#145;chief transgressor&#146; in the matter of ship money  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 1.311, 526) and gave a highly vindictive speech against him. While Finch was impeached, the Lords said that they wanted him to appear and answer the accusations, but not to surrender himself to confinement. His estates in Kent and Middlesex, estimated at an annual value of &pound;338, were sequestrated in 1644 but his wife was permitted to occupy them at an annual rent of &pound;100, so long as they were in sequestration. It has been presumed that they were subsequently redeemed for a composition of &pound;7000.<h2>
<a name="Exiledeathandreputation"></a>Exile, death, and reputation</h2>During his exile Finch lived principally at The Hague. John Evelyn met him there in 1641, lodging for a time with him and a Brownist sectary in the same house, where, says Evelyn, &#145;we had an extraordinary good table&#146;  (Evelyn, 26 July, 19 Aug 1641). Letters to Finch from Henrietta Maria, Elizabeth of Bohemia, and the countess of Winchester, with whom he went shooting, show the intimate terms on which he stood with them. On 14 July 1647, when taken ill again, he petitioned the House of Lords for leave to return home to die in his native country. The petition was ordered to be considered, and was entered in the journal of the house. No leave, however, was granted until the Long Parliament allowed him to return to Fordwich just before its dismissal in 1653.<br>
<br>Finch lived quietly and poorly at Fordwich until the Restoration, when he met Charles II on his return to London. Returning to public office at the Restoration, Finch was appointed one of the commissioners for the trial of the regicides in October 1660. However, he took little part in the proceedings beyond the occasional comment. Although he lived to see most of the regicides executed, he died on 27 November at Fordwich and was buried in St Martin's Church, near Canterbury, where a monument was erected. He was survived only by his wife, Mabel, and his title became extinct.<h2>
<a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>Finch was descended from a prominent legal family. His father, Sir Henry's sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons all appeared in the legal profession at Westminster Hall, and Finch's two sisters married into the eminent legal family of the Twisdens. Finch was not a writer like his father, and had little interest in jurisprudence, building his career on political and legal activity. Anthony Wood claimed that he compiled a &#145;Manuale Mathematicum&#146; on vellum with his own hand, formerly preserved in the Ashmolean Museum, but missing from the Ashmolean collection of the Bodleian Library; given Finch's career path, however, this is highly unlikely.<br>
<br>His kinsman Sir Peter Heyman condemned Finch as &#145;the disgrace of his country, the blot of a noble family &hellip; whom posterity will remember with scorn and disdain&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>). Clarendon's account in his <span class="italic">History of the Rebellion</span> fixed in print the negative image of Finch. While an outspoken supporter of royal power, there is no reason to suppose that Finch was other than a conscientious man. He always contended that the king must govern by the &#145;positive laws of the kingdom&#146;  (Sharpe, 932). In religion, he considered himself a devout protestant, claiming that in his public life no one doubted &#145;my affection in religion&#146;  (Nalson, 1.693). A Calvinist, he had a high standard of forensic evidence, argued cases on the facts, and was seen by many contemporaries as a pillar of justice and mercy. His view of the duty of a judge was certainly very humble. He was also free of any accusations of corruption. Possessing good social skills, he acquired many friends, retained them throughout his life, and is said to have suffered fools gladly.<br>
