<span class="headword">Moore,  Thomas Sturge</span>  (1870&#150;1944), <span class="occ">writer and designer</span>, was born at 3 Wellington Square, St Mary in the Castle, Hastings, on 4 March 1870, the eldest of the four sons (one of whom was the philosopher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35090/', "G. E. Moore")</script>) and four daughters of Daniel Moore (1840&#150;1904), a physician, and his second wife, Henrietta, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sturge (1839&#150;1903). The family moved to Norwood in 1871, and he attended Dulwich College from 1879 to 1884, but, dogged by ill health, fell behind academically. In 1885 he enrolled in the Croydon Art School, where he lost his Baptist faith and where he met the artist Charles Shannon. After two years he transferred to Lambeth Art School; there Shannon's lover, Charles Ricketts, was a teacher. When Shannon and Ricketts moved into The Vale, Chelsea, in 1888, Moore rented workrooms there and they introduced him to artistic London at their &#145;Friday Evenings&#146;. He contributed to their periodical <span class="italic">The Dial</span>, and helped to edit and translate a number of books for the Vale Press, which Ricketts started in 1894. In 1895 Moore's parents moved to Torquay, but he remained in London, living mainly off an annuity from an uncle. In 1893 he had privately published <span class="italic">Two Poems</span>, and in 1899 issued <span class="italic">The Vinedresser and Other Poems</span>, which impressed Laurence Binyon. Binyon introduced him to W. B. Yeats in 1899, and the two became lifelong friends.<br>
<br>In 1885 Moore began regular visits to his French relatives and fell in love with his cousin Marie Appia, daughter of George Appia, a Lutheran minister. In 1895, however, she became engaged to his brother Harry, but he was training to be an Anglican clergyman and, assailed by religious scruples about her nonconformity, soon broke off the engagement. Moore declared himself in June 1897, but was rebuffed; he persisted and the two finally married in 1903. Their son Daniel was born in 1905, and their daughter Henriette (Riette) in 1907.<br>
<br>Moore's developing interest in drama led to his association with a number of societies, notably the Literary Theatre Club, which he helped found in 1901 with Florence Farr and Ricketts, and resuscitated as a limited company in 1905. In April 1906 it staged his one-act <span class="italic">Aphrodite against Artemis</span>, based on the Phaedra&#150;Hippolytus story. Although the play was savagely attacked by the reviewers, productions of Wilde's <span class="italic">Salom&eacute;</span> and <span class="italic">A Florentine Tragedy</span> (in Moore's adaptation) followed in June 1906. He joined the Stage Society in 1908, shortly after appearing in its production of <span class="italic">The Persians</span>, and in 1912 was appointed to its council.<br>
<br>Moore designed and illustrated books throughout his life (notably his own works and those of Yeats), and in May 1904 he was elected a member of the Society of Twelve, a group of wood-engravers and lithographers. He published books on Altdorfer (1900), D&uuml;rer (1905), and Correggio (1906), and in 1910 formulated his aesthetic ideas in <span class="italic">Art and Life</span>. His story &#145;A Platonic Marriage&#146; was attacked by the Vigilance Society on its appearance in the <span class="italic">English Review</span> in January 1911, but later that year he was elected to the Royal Society of Literature. In the following year he joined Harold Monro's Poetry Bookshop, and contributed &#145;A Sicilian Idyll&#146; to the first volume of <span class="italic">Georgian Poetry</span>. At this time he helped translate works by Rabindranath Tagore, then becoming popular in England.<br>
<br>In 1919 Moore moved his family from 40 Well Walk, Hampstead, London, where they had lived since 1912, to Steep in Hampshire, where his children attended the progressive Bedales School. In the following year he was awarded a civil-list pension of &pound;75 per annum and published <span class="italic">The Powers of the Air</span>, which propounds his aesthetic in mythological terms, and a play, <span class="italic">Medea</span>. He gave classes in aesthetics at Bedales, and in 1929 these formed the basis of <span class="italic">Amour for Aphrodite</span>, in which he argued that beauty is an intrinsic value. The family had returned to Well Walk in 1927, where he began to keep open house on Friday evenings. His numerous volumes of poems were gathered into <span class="italic">The Poems of T. Sturge Moore</span>, issued in four volumes from 1931 to 1933, and a <span class="italic">Selected Poems</span> appeared in 1934. His <span class="italic">Judith</span> had been staged in January 1916, but there were no more performances of his plays until <span class="italic">Psyche in Hades</span> in 1927 and <span class="italic">Niobe</span> and <span class="italic">Medea</span> in 1930. He underwent a Steinach rejuvenating operation in 1936, and at the outbreak of the Second World War moved to Dorking. He suffered from chronic ill health from 1942, and died in Windsor of kidney infection on 18 July 1944, following an operation.<br>
