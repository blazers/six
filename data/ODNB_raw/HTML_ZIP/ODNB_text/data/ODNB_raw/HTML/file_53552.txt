<span class="headword">Robinson,  Elihu</span>  (1734&#150;1809), <span class="occ">meteorologist and horticulturist</span>, was born on 21 October 1734 at Kirby, near Cockermouth, Cumberland, the son of Samuel and Elizabeth Robinson of Kirby. After his marriage to Ruth Mark of Bowscale on 5 July 1757, the couple lived at Eaglesfield, Cumberland, where Robinson farmed. He also had interests in mining and business, which his diaries suggest brought him little profit. He was an educated man with an extensive library, and has been regarded as the archetypal Quaker yeoman of the period. Lonsdale described him<blockquote>decked out in his three-cocked beaver, light drab coat, vest and knee breeches, yellowish-grey ribbed stockings, and silver-buckled shoes, all in the best style of rich Quakerism, fine and spotless, and walking in sober fashion through the village with silver-headed cane in support. (Lonsdale, 35)</blockquote>This flamboyant description is in direct contrast to Wigham's opinion of the man she labelled &#145;The Recluse of Eaglesfield&#146;  (Wigham, <span class="italic">Examiner</span>, 1890, 547). Robinson played an important role in the local Quaker community, and represented Cumberland at the London yearly meetings on eleven occasions between 1759 and 1789.<br>
<br>Robinson is recognized as the first tutor to John Dalton (1766&#150;1844), who Wigham suggests appears to have been a distant relative; in correspondence Dalton himself refers to Robinson as his &#145;Dear Cousin&#146;. Dalton was born in Eaglesfield and from the age of ten regularly visited Robinson for lessons in literature, science, and mathematics, and as Elihu and Ruth had no children of their own they undoubtedly enjoyed the company of the young boy. Even when based in Manchester, where he taught from 1793, Dalton continued to consult Robinson about meteorological and other scientific matters, including his own colour blindness.<br>
<br>Robinson corresponded for more than forty years with the London banker Thomas Collinson (1727&#150;1803) on matters of scientific interest. Collinson knew Joseph Banks, Daniel Solander, and Benjamin Franklin, and sent details of his meetings with them to Robinson, including notices of voyages of exploration and interesting fossil finds. Collinson supplied Robinson with a microscope in July 1759, the accompanying letter indicating that both men were interested in &#145;the minute world, which testifies that nature is never more perfect than in her least performances&#146;  (Wigham, <span class="italic">Examiner</span>, 1891, 407). However, Robinson's major scientific preoccupation was meteorology: Lonsdale noted that he was &#145;probably one of the first of Cumberland's meteorologists &hellip; recording the readings of thermometer and barometer, marking the seasons and the crops, and many natural phenomena, moreover he had considerable manipulative skill&#146;  (Lonsdale, 35). Robinson makes little of his scientific achievements in a letter to Thomas Collinson in 1763, stating that his &#145;delight was greater in ethics or moral philosophy than in natural science&#146;  (Wigham, <span class="italic">Examiner</span>, 1892, 80&#150;81). Robinson died in Eaglesfield on 20 July 1809.<br>
