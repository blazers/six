<span class="headword">Blackburne,  Richard</span>  (1651/2&#150;1716), <span class="occ">physician and writer</span>, was born in London, the son of Richard Blackburne and the older brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2516/', "Lancelot Blackburne")</script>. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, as a pensioner in 1665 under Thomas Gale. He became a scholar of the college in 1668 and graduated BA in 1670. In May 1676, at the age of twenty-four, he took the degree of MD from Leiden University. His thesis, on the formation of the blood, was published as <span class="italic">Disputatio medica inauguralis de sanguificatione</span> (1676).<br>
<br>Blackburne returned to London, where he assisted John Aubrey in producing a supplement to the prose autobiography of Thomas Hobbes soon after the philosopher's death in December 1679. In February 1680 Aubrey described Blackburne to Anthony Wood as one of &#145;the best scholars in London of his age, &amp; <i>philo</i> Hobbist&#146; as well as a &#145;mighty read man&#146; who &#145;hath harried all Mr Hobbes's adversaries&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ballard 14, fol. 125). Initially Aubrey enlisted Blackburne to be his &#145;Aristarchus&#146;, providing editorial advice. Aubrey however soon relinquished his notes and control of the project to Blackburne, who organized Aubrey's manuscripts and began to produce a Latin translation of the supplement. At first Aubrey was pleased with Blackburne's &#145;delicate style&#146;. He wrote to Wood that &#145;it was as if Mr Hobbes's soule were come into his body&#146;. However Aubrey also complained that &#145;the Dr is a great Judge &amp; consequently magisteriall: he is much against minuteness&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 456a, fol. 23). A serious disagreement developed between Blackburne and Aubrey on the nature of the biography. Blackburne and his advisers, John Dryden and Lord John Vaughan, advocated what Aubrey disparaged as a panegyric &#145;High Style&#146;. Aubrey objected to the omission of small details, such as Hobbes's having been a page. A disgruntled but prescient Aubrey wrote to Wood that &#145;The Dr says I am too minute; but a hundred yeare hence that minuteness will be gratefull&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Wood F39, fol. 340). Aubrey's dissatisfaction with Blackburne's treatment of Hobbes apparently spurred him to begin writing his <span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, in which his own biographical ideas and concern with detail was fully expressed. Blackburne's <span class="italic">Vitae Hobbianae auctarium</span> was completed by September 1680, giving an unusually positive view of the controversial philosopher's achievements. It included a list of Hobbes's friends and detailed bibliographies of his works and those of his critics and admirers. Although Aubrey was not entirely happy with the finished product, an English translation was projected, although it was never produced. The work does, however, form the basis for the English biographical introduction to <span class="italic">The Moral and Political Works of Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury</span> (1750). Blackburne's biography appeared in the materials published by William Crooke in 1681 under the title <span class="italic">Thomae Hobbes Angli Malmesburiensis philosophi vita</span>. This was probably edited by Blackburne and was dedicated to Hobbes's patron, William Cavendish, earl of Devonshire. It contained verses by Abraham Cowley, Ralph Bathurst, and one incorrectly attributed to Aubrey. Blackburne supplied a preface to three works: Hobbes's Latin prose autobiography, <span class="italic">Thomii Hobbes Malmesburiensis vita</span>, Blackburne's much longer <span class="italic">Vitae</span> and finally Hobbes's Latin verse autobiography. The work ran to a second edition in 1682.<br>
<br>The dispute over the biography did not appear to ruin Blackburne's and Aubrey's friendship. In 1681 they co-operated over an attempt to promote the medicinal chalybeate springs at Seend, near Devizes in Wiltshire, which Aubrey had discovered in 1665. Blackburne, who practised annually at Tunbridge Wells, worded an advertisement celebrating the virtues of the waters. These efforts were unsuccessful&#151;the springs were not regularly frequented until after 1688. On 25 June 1685 Blackburne became an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. He was admitted as a full fellow at the extraordinary <i>comitia</i> of 12 April 1687 under the new charter granted to the college by James II. Blackburne became a censor of the college in 1688. The revolution of 1688 brought the validity of the new charter, and the position of the new fellows, into question. Blackburne took a leading role in representing the &#145;new&#146; college in the disputes which resulted in 1689. A sometimes severe critic of the college authorities, Blackburne was a vocal presence at college meetings, being fined on several occasions for &#145;unseasonable Speaking&#146; and &#145;unseemly Language&#146;  (annals, RCP Lond., 5.127, 6.9). In October 1690 he pointed out the technical illegality of one of the new college statutes which prevented the admission of any physician who had practised any less liberal art or had served an apprenticeship in a shop. The statute conflicted with the college's stated duty to reject only for lack of due learning and skill and, as a result of Blackburne's protest, it was withdrawn. In July 1695 Blackburne was part of a group which refused to contribute funds for the establishment of a charitable dispensary (a measure which could also be seen as an attack upon the apothecaries' trade). Later in the same year he was also one of the fellows who refused to contribute a &pound;50 bond to observe the statutes of the college. From 1706 Blackburne is described in the fellows' list as living in &#145;the country&#146; and then from 1709 in Epsom. His will (made in 1714) suggests that he was at that time resident in the village of Sutton in Surrey, where he died in 1716. He was buried in Sutton churchyard on 30 May.<br>
