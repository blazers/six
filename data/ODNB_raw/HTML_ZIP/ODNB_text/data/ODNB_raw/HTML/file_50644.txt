<span class="headword">Cox,  Arthur Hawker</span>  (1813&#150;1903), <span class="occ">manufacturing chemist and local politician</span>, was born in the Haymarket, London, in November 1813, one of a family of ten children born to Edward Treslove Cox and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Homersham. His father, a native of Northampton, was a cabinet-maker. Little is known of the family except that one brother, Edward Homersham Cox, became a successful barrister.<br>
<br>Arthur Cox was apprenticed as a chemist and druggist at the age of fifteen to his uncle, a Mr Perrin, in Northampton and afterwards worked as an assistant at Dinnefords in New Bond Street. The <span class="roman">Apothecaries Act</span> of 1815 had, <i>inter alia</i>, recognized the position of the chemist and druggist as a wholesale and retail supplier of medicines; there was no qualifying examination for the occupation, but a five-year apprenticeship was the norm. Cox's surviving notebook, perhaps dating from his apprenticeship years, indicates a wide range of remedies supplied, including recipes not only for cough linctus and purgatives but also for sheep wash, cold cream, mushroom ketchup, and furniture paste. Family tradition has it that it was during his apprenticeship that he became interested in the development of a coating for pills to disguise the unpleasant taste of the ingredients, but it was not until 1854 that he sought and was granted patent protection for his tasteless, non-metallic coating for pills. The success of the coating provided the basis for his expansion into manufacturing.<br>
<br>On 21 October 1837 Cox married Mary Anne Strudwick; the couple had a son and four daughters. In 1839 they left London for Brighton where, in June that year, Cox opened his own shop at 29 Ship Street. Despite the demands of business and family, Cox soon began to participate in local politics. In the early 1840s he campaigned, as the honorary secretary of the Sussex branch, for the Anti-Corn Law League. A lifelong supporter of the Liberal Party, he was involved in the fight for the incorporation of Brighton. He was elected as one of the first councillors in 1854 and made an alderman in 1859; he remained so for more than forty years, serving three terms as mayor, in 1869, in 1882, and in 1883. The many civic events over which he presided included the opening, in August 1883, of Magnus Volk's pioneering Brighton and Rottingdean seashore electric tramroad.<br>
<br>Cox's business continued to grow as an increasing and more affluent population demanded and could afford medication. In 1871 he split the business, handing over the shop, now at 32 Ship Street, to his son, Homersham Edward; the latter, more dedicated to sailing&#151;also his father's hobby&#151;than to pharmacy, ran it unenthusiastically until the 1880s. Cox senior, although approaching sixty, moved the manufacturing business to St Martin's Place. He bought a house backing on to the factory premises and, on 13 January 1870, after the death of his first wife, he married Elizabeth Frances Claxton (<i>d</i>. 1897); the marriage produced three sons and four daughters. In the late 1880s and early 1890s the two eldest sons of his second marriage took over management of the factory.<br>
<br>Cox died on 6 April 1903 at 35 Wellington Road, Brighton, and was buried in Brighton cemetery three days later. The kindly disposition and engaging personality of his public persona concealed, as with so many of his class and time, an autocrat within his family. His daughter Eliza had married against his wishes and was cut out of his will, which, more significantly, provided for the conversion of his business into a private company to be run by his sons and provide for his unmarried daughters. The pharmaceutical manufacturing business of A. H. Cox &amp; Co. Ltd continued to be largely owned and managed by the three succeeding generations of the Cox family until the 1970s. In 1978 the company moved from Brighton to a new factory in Barnstaple, Devon, and in 1984 it was bought by Hoechst UK, the British subsidiary of the German chemicals and pharmaceuticals group.<br>
