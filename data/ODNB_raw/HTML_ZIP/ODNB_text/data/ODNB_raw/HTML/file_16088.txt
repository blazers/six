<span class="headword">Latham,  John</span>  (1761&#150;1843), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 29 December 1761 at Gawsworth, Cheshire, the eldest son of John Latham of Oriel College, Oxford, vicar of Siddington, Cheshire, and his wife, Sarah, formerly Podmore, of Sandbach, Cheshire. After education at Manchester grammar school he entered Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1778, graduated BA on 9 February 1782, MA on 15 October 1784, MB on 3 May 1786, and DM on 3 April 1788. From 1782 to 1784 he studied medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London.<br>
<br>On 12 April 1784 Latham married Mary, daughter of Peter Mere, vicar of Prestbury. They had three sons: <a href="#cosubject_16092">John (1787&#150;1853) [<i>see below</i>]</a>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16093/', "Peter Mere Latham (1789&#150;1875)")</script>, and <a href="#cosubject_16088">Henry (1794&#150;1866) [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Latham began to practise medicine in Manchester, and was honorary physician to Manchester Infirmary, but he soon moved to Oxford, where, on 11 July 1787, he became physician to the Radcliffe Infirmary. In 1788 he moved to London, and was elected fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 30 September 1789. He was elected physician to the Middlesex Hospital on 15 October 1789, and resigned on his election to the same office at St Bartholomew's Hospital on 17 January 1793, which he held in 1802. He had a large practice at his house in Bedford Row, regularly attended the Royal College of Physicians, where he was censor the year after his election as fellow, and delivered the Harveian oration in 1794. He delivered the Goulstonian lectures in 1793, and the Croonian in 1795. He was president from 1813 to 1819 inclusive. In 1795 Latham became physician-extraordinary to the prince of Wales. He published <span class="italic">A Plan of a Charitable Institution to be Established on the Sea Coast</span> in 1791, and in 1796 <span class="italic">On Rheumatism and Gout: a Letter Addressed to Sir George Baker, Bart</span>, where he stated his opinion that neither acute rheumatism nor gout should be classed among inflammations, and that the seat of both was the radicles of the lymphatic vessels. He denied that gout was inherited, and that attacks were ever beneficial, and advocated a very elaborate system of treatment.<br>
<br>Latham had made a fortune and bought an estate at Sandbach before 1807. In that year he showed symptoms of advanced consumption. Dr David Pitcairn cured him, and he retired for rest to his estate for two years, but he grew tired of country life and returned to London, where he took a house in Harley Street. While continuing to practise he wrote prolifically during the years before his second retirement.<br>
<br>Latham's <span class="italic">Facts and Opinions Concerning Diabetes</span> (1811) consisted of long extracts from the Greek writers and from Francis Willis on the subject, followed by recorded cases. He favoured a dietetic treatment and supported the views of Dr John Rollo. Ten papers on a wide variety of topics were published in <span class="italic">Medical Transactions</span> between 1806 and 1819. Besides his printed works he wrote an elaborate &#145;Dissertation on asthma&#146;. His writings show that he excelled in clinical observation and acquaintance with the materia medica.<br>
<br>Latham moved in 1829 to Bradwall Hall in Cheshire, where he died of stone in the bladder on 20 April 1843. He set aside a portion of his income for charity, and called this (by a term derived from Hebrew) his corban fund.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_16092"></a><span class="headword">John Latham</span>  (1787&#150;1853), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at Oxford on 18 March 1787. He was sent to Macclesfield grammar school when five years old, and to Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1803, where Reginald Heber was his contemporary and friend. Latham was a dedicated and methodical student, and thus had time to indulge his love of sports. In 1806 he won the university prize for Latin verse with a poem on Trafalgar, and in that year, while still an undergraduate, was elected a fellow of All Souls. In December 1806 he entered Lincoln's Inn, graduating BCL in 1810 and DCL in 1815. Soon afterwards he was attacked by ophthalmia, and lost all but residual sight. For fourteen years he spent several months of each year at All Souls, the rest of the time living with his father, until 24 May 1821, when he married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1839), daughter of Sir Henry Dampier; they took a house at Somerset Street, Portman Square, London. Their eldest son, John Henry Latham (1823&#150;1843), an accomplished scholar, died while an undergraduate at Oxford; two sons and a daughter survived him. In 1829 he settled in Cheshire, near his father, whom he succeeded as squire in 1843. He died at Bradwall on 30 January 1853 and was buried on 4 February at Sandbach. Latham published anonymously a volume of poems (1836), and a volume of his <span class="italic">English and Latin Poems, Original and Translated</span>, was printed in 1853.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_16088"></a><span class="headword">Henry Latham</span>  (1794&#150;1866), <span class="occ">poet</span>, third son of John Latham, was born in London on 4 November 1794. From Manchester grammar school he entered Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1812, and there obtained a prize for Latin verse. He graduated in 1815 and was admitted a barrister of Lincoln's Inn in 1820. The three brothers went to Paris and the Low Countries in 1820, and Henry later visited North America. He subsequently entered the church; he was vicar successively of Selmeston with Alciston and of Fittleworth, Sussex. He retained a taste for classical studies, and published in 1863 a collection of translated and original Latin poems. He died of cholera on 6 September 1866, at Boulogne. He was twice married.<br>
