<span class="headword">Stephen family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1750&#150;1976), <span class="occ">shipbuilders</span>, came to prominence with Alexander Stephen (1722&#150;1793), the son of William Stephen, a tenant farmer near Lossiemouth on the Moray Firth; he set up business at Burghead, 8 miles from Lossiemouth, in 1750, building small vessels for local customers. He was joined in 1777 by his brother's son, William Stephen (1759&#150;1838), who worked with him at Burghead for ten years before returning to his home town of Aberdeen to learn ship drafting in James Cochar's yard. Aberdeen at that time had the largest concentration of shipbuilding activity on the east coast of Scotland. By 1793 William Stephen had set up on his own to build ships in competition with Cochar at Footdee in Aberdeen. The Stephens then had two yards, the original one at Burghead operated by Alexander Stephen, and the Footdee establishment at Aberdeen operated by his nephew William Stephen. It was from this second enterprise that a further six generations of Stephens were to become shipbuilders, moving progressively down the east coast from Aberdeen to Arbroath and then Dundee, and finally westward to the Clyde.<br>
<br>The first move outward from the Footdee base was made by William Stephen's eldest son, another William, who leased a yard at Arbroath in 1814 and extended the family interests into a new local market. William's second son, <a name="cosubject_66314"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Stephen</span>  (1795&#150;1875)<span class="occ"></span>, remained to work with his father in the Aberdeen yard. Their Footdee yard, William Stephen &amp; Sons, was the more important of the yards, but in 1824 was still a small affair employing only thirty workers, building mainly brigs, barques, and schooners; these were generally of between 100 and 200 tons. The Arbroath yard did not prosper and was in financial difficulty from the early 1820s, causing William Stephen senior to sign a bond guaranteeing his son's debts. When William Stephen junior's creditors forced the closure of the Arbroath yard in 1828 his father could not meet the full claims and was himself forced into liquidation. The firm of William Stephen &amp; Sons was dissolved on new year's day 1828, when William Stephen senior was sixty-nine.<br>
<br>This enforced liquidation proved to be an opportunity for Alexander Stephen to enter shipbuilding on his own account. He acquired his father's bankrupt business and re-established it as Alexander Stephen &amp; Sons; he also met his father's debts and took over responsibility for the Arbroath yard, where the debts were paid off over seven years. He chose not to operate two widely separated yards and decided to relocate from Footdee to Arbroath at the end of 1830. He immediately acquired the neighbouring yard to the small Arbroath establishment and began building there the next year. However, the long-term viability of the Arbroath site was threatened when the proposed Dundee and Arbroath railway line was routed through the yard. When construction was completed in 1840, the yard was much reduced in scale. Alexander Stephen then used his compensation payments to acquire the bankrupt stock of the New Shipbuilding Company at Dundee in 1842. He paid &pound;550 for the stock and took the yard on a four-year lease of &pound;150 per year, finally closing the Arbroath site in 1843 and transferring all his business to Dundee.<br>
<br>Between 1814 and 1843 Alexander Stephen built ships at both Aberdeen and Arbroath, and during these years he and his sons were also ship repairers and ship operators, and entered the timber trade between the Baltic and Dundee, ranging also to the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Alexander Stephen was undoubtedly a successful businessman, but his daily diary, kept from 1824, gives some insight into his character. He was a disciplinarian, even ruthless, with his men; he frequently held down wages and costs to keep his yard in operation. He himself worked long hours, travelled widely for orders, and systematically collected information on prices, conditions, and commodities. Even when family tragedy struck, his rigid self-control was evident. His diary entry for Monday 7 June 1841 simply reads, &#145;My daughter Elisabeth was killed by the circular saw this afternoon&#146;. Similarly, the move from Arbroath to Dundee is recorded briefly on Thursday 26 January 1843 as &#145;I have now commenced in Dundee by taking on the slip the schooner Sovereign belonging to the Dundee London Shipping Company&#146;. In like vein his determination in front of labour problems is illustrated by an entry of 14 April 1845: &#145;Most of the journeymen left off work again because I discharged one of the ringleaders&#146;. The Dundee yard was to be operated by the Stephens for fifty years from 1843 to 1893, during which time they built and launched ninety-seven ships. The longer-term future of the family, however, was to be associated with the Clyde, and in April 1850 Alexander Stephen agreed to rent a yard at Kelvinhaugh there at &pound;800 per annum.<br>
<br>The move was timely; the future in shipbuilding clearly lay with steam and iron, and the River Clyde was already the leading builder of iron and steam vessels in Britain, and indeed in the world at that time. The logistics of the Stephens' operating two yards, one on the Tay and the other on the Clyde, were eased by the fact that Alexander Stephen's three sons, William, John, and Alexander junior, had all entered the Dundee business. Alexander Stephen senior then went to Glasgow with his sons John and <a name="cosubject_66315"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Stephen junior</span>  (1832&#150;1899)<span class="occ"></span> to establish the Kelvinhaugh enterprise, leaving the Dundee yard to be managed by his eldest son, William. He drew up a deed of co-partnery with William for the Dundee yard in 1856, and in 1858 he arranged for John and Alexander Stephen junior to take over the Kelvinhaugh concern. He himself then returned to work with William at Dundee in 1859. Alexander Stephen senior died of apoplexy at his home, Corona House, Broughty Ferry, Forfarshire, on 24 April 1875; he was survived by his wife, Elspeth Murray.<br>
<br>The Kelvinhaugh yard was already large, employing over 500 men, and Alexander junior had ambitions for extending the business after his brother withdrew at the end of the 1850s. He quickly persuaded his older brother William, and his father, that combining the new iron framing with timber planking to create a composite style of construction had advantages over pure wood frames and struts, while at the same time having the advantages of a wooden hull which could be coppered and consequently escape the problem of fouling which beset iron hulls. He also achieved approval from Lloyd's Register in 1861 for constructing composite ships, being able to class these A1 for fifteen years. This inaugurated a period of composite ship construction at Kelvinhaugh, the Stephens concentrating on fast clipper ships which entered the tea races from China to Britain. The speed and strength of these vessels impressed the Admiralty, but also attracted the attention of agents of the Confederate states of America during the civil war. Alexander Stephen junior applied the same methods to building composite screw steamers, the first of which was the <i>Sea King</i>, built for Robertson &amp; Co. of Glasgow. This vessel was repurchased in a roundabout way by the Confederate agents and was renamed the <i>Shenandoah</i>, a highly successful Confederate vessel. The Dundee yard of the Stephens also adopted the composite construction concept from 1865, but shortly after that was destroyed by fire and a new establishment had to be constructed between 1867 and 1868. At the same time the Kelvinhaugh lease was running out and Alexander Stephen junior negotiated the purchase of the Linthouse estate on the other bank of the Clyde in 1868, with possession early in 1869. In 1870 the Stephens launched their last ship at Kelvinhaugh and began the construction of their first vessel on the new Linthouse site. The long migration of the Stephens through the shipbuilding districts of Scotland had come to an end.<br>
<br>The move to Linthouse coincided with a demand for larger and faster vessels. Alexander Stephen junior concentrated on gaining contracts and on the management and finance of the business, while his brother John was the engineer and outside manager. Alexander took after his father as a disciplinarian and hard worker, and followed his family's preference for adherence to the Free Church of Scotland, being an active member and elder though not a narrow zealot. He had a keen interest in education and was the first chairman of the Govan school board under the 1872 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>; he also defeated Sir William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) to be the first elected chairman of the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College, which was established in 1887. In public life he became lord dean of guild of the city of Glasgow in 1881 and was the first president of the Clyde Shipbuilders' Association in 1889. He was also a keen yachtsman. In 1857 he married Mary Templeton, who outlived him; they had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Alexander Stephen junior ensured that a fifth generation of Stephens would follow into the family business, taking his sons, Alexander Edward and <a name="cosubject_66316"></a><span class="headword">Frederic John Stephen</span>  (1863&#150;1932)<span class="occ"></span>, into partnership in 1887; the company secretary, Alexander Scott, and the yard manager, Robert McMaster, were also admitted as partners with a small share in the business at this time. With this new partnership Alexander Stephen junior remained firmly in control as senior partner, but then decided to withdraw from active management in 1894, passing control largely to his two sons, who were the dominant partners, though his brother John still remained as chairman of a company. The previous year had seen the closure of the Dundee enterprise when Alexander Stephen junior's brother, William, died suddenly; thereafter the Stephens built only at Linthouse on the Clyde. Alexander Stephen junior died on 19 May 1899 at 12 Park Terrace, Glasgow.<br>
<br>During their apprenticeship with their father, Alexander Edward Stephen had been assigned to the engineering department while Frederic John Stephen had gone to the shipbuilding side of the business. Born on 6 August 1863 at 15 Park Circus, Glasgow, Frederic John Stephen studied naval architecture; he was awarded an MA from Glasgow University. In 1891 he married Agnes Renton, daughter of James Young, a muslin manufacturer. The couple had three sons and two daughters. Stephen later married Mabel Frew Young, who survived him. Like his father, he was a keen yachtsman, reputed to be the best helmsman on the Clyde, and in 1924 he successfully defended the Sewanhaka cup.<br>
<br>When their father withdrew from the concern Alexander Edward Stephen took control of engineering while Frederic John Stephen ran the shipyard and the general administration of the business; both had the backing of professional section managers. The management style was familial, with group discussion and decision-taking in the board room, and paternalistic in relation to the men. Like their father the two brothers opposed organized labour and stood apart from the collective bargaining of the Shipbuilding Employers' Federation. They operated the business as before, as a private partnership until 1900, when they converted to limited liability status, registering in Edinburgh with a capital of &pound;350,000, of which there were 200,000 ordinary &pound;1 shares, and 150,000 &pound;1 preference shares. Frederic John and Alexander Edward Stephen each held 41,400 ordinary shares, their uncle John 20,000, and other family members 25,000 shares&#151;keeping the firm firmly within the family control. The formation of the new limited company was also the occasion of a shift of emphasis in construction away from general cargo and cargo&#150;passenger ships into a higher class of cargo liner and passenger liner construction. The balance of control in the company also shifted, for Alexander Edward Stephen suffered declining health and this pushed Frederic John Stephen into the dominant management position in the business, retaining that leadership until his death. He managed a significant expansion of the firm during the First World War, especially in the engineering, boiler, and ship-repairing facilities. He also extended the company welfare schemes, establishing a boys' club and opening a large works canteen in 1919. In 1920 he purchased and laid out 10 acres of recreation ground for his workers, forming Coila Park.<br>
<br>At the end of the war the Stephens, like other shipbuilders, hoped for continued buoyancy in the market and took steps to try to secure long-term orders. In 1919 the board agreed to sell 102,000 ordinary shares to Lord Inchcape, giving him 51 per cent control in the business. This was done in the expectation that the long association with Inchcape, now formalized, would secure long-term orders for the yard, and the move linked the yard to the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Ships Company and to the British India Steam Navigation Company and its subsidiaries. Between 1920 and 1932 these links delivered ten orders to Linthouse, 24 per cent of tonnage constructed in this period; thereafter in the depression of the 1930s the connection offered no protection, nor did it benefit the family in any great way; the shares were eventually repurchased in 1933, restoring complete family control of the business. Frederic John Stephen had also linked his family to a consortium of shipbuilders to acquire control of the Steel Company of Scotland in 1920, with the objective of securing steel supplies for the company. The Stephens eventually held one-quarter of the shares but these were sold to the Colville group in 1935 for &pound;40,155, a loss of over &pound;353,000 to the family.<br>
<br>Frederic John Stephen's stewardship of the family business spanned the hectic expansion into the war, and the prolonged contraction of the 1920s and the early 1930s. By the time of his death in 1932, Linthouse, and shipbuilding in general, was at its lowest ebb. The family strategy was to let dividends take the strain and no dividend was paid on ordinary shares between 1928 and 1937, nor on preference shares between 1933 and 1936. Frederic John Stephen died at Invergare, Rhu, Dunbartonshire, on 16 December 1932. Control of the firm passed to his sons, (Alexander) Murray and John Graeme Stephen, at a very difficult time. He was succeeded as chairman by <a name="cosubject_49538"></a><span class="headword">Sir (Alexander) Murray Stephen</span>  (1892&#150;1974)<span class="occ"></span>. Born at Linnwood, Dowanhill Gardens, Glasgow, on 11 September 1892, Murray Stephen was educated at Cargil Field and Fettes schools. He then went up to King's College, Cambridge, graduating there in 1914 with first-class honours in the mechanical tripos. After service in France, where he was awarded the Military Cross, Murray Stephen finally entered the family business in 1919. He became a director of the firm in 1922. In that year he married Kathrene Paton, daughter of Alexander Moncrieff Mitchell, a lawyer. The couple had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>The troubled circumstances of the early 1930s forced Murray Stephen to take tough and determined action, and it was he who regained the Inchcape shares and negotiated the liquidation of the family holdings in the Steel Company of Scotland, while retaining a seat on the board. He also represented his company on the board of the shipbuilding rationalization company, National Shipbuilders' Security Ltd, and by 1937 he was president of the Clyde Shipbuilders' Association; the following year he also became president of the Shipbuilding Employers' Federation. The next step for him was presidency of the Shipbuilding Conference, the industry commercial agency, and he held that demanding position from 1941 to 1948. These roles, and his wartime service on the Ministry of Transport and Shipbuilding committee, brought him a knighthood in 1946; he was also a member of the post-war shipbuilding advisory committee established in 1946.<br>
<br>After the war Murray Stephen was an advocate of radical change in the shipbuilding industry, notably pioneering the use of welding and advocating the adoption of prefabrication. He also tried to tackle the ingrained over-manning and restrictive work practices in the shipyards, setting up at Linthouse the first shipyard joint council in which labour and management met monthly to discuss the business and any issues of concern. He also tried to accelerate and secure technical change and improve practice by establishing two apprentice training schools within the yard, staffed by professional teachers. While all of this was progressive, the net achievement and benefit for the Stephens was slender; the problems were too deep-seated for a single yard to resolve. Nevertheless, Murray Stephen remained strongly committed to technical change and progress and continued to advocate this for the industry through his chairmanship of the council of the British Shipbuilding Research Association between 1948 and 1950. He undertook wider public service in 1948 when he became a member of the University Grants Committee, and he received an honorary degree of LLD from Glasgow University in 1952. Among many honours he was a lord lieutenant of the county of Lanarkshire, honorary president of the Scottish Conservative Association, and in Glasgow a director of the chamber of commerce, deacon of the Incorporation of Hammermen, and a director of the Victoria Infirmary. When he retired in 1965 his yard at Linthouse was in deep difficulty, in common with other yards on the Clyde and in Britain generally. Sir Murray Stephen died at Bon Secours Hospital, Glasgow, on 17 December 1974. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>The firm of Alexander Stephen &amp; Sons of Linthouse was to pay no dividends after 1965 and the seventh generation of Stephens, James and Alexander, inherited the family firm in its declining years. Family control was finally lost in 1968 when Linthouse was merged into the new Upper Clyde Shipbuilders Ltd, and the yard was closed in 1969, ending a century of building there. The engineering side of the business remained in family hands, but it too closed in 1976, ending more than 200 years of shipbuilding by the Stephens of Burghead, Aberdeen, Arbroath, Dundee, and Linthouse.<br>
