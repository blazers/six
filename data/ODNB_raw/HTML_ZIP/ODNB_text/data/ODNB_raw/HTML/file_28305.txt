<span class="headword">Vilvain,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1576, <em>d.</em> 1663), <span class="occ">physician and philanthropist</span>, was born in the parish of All Hallows, Goldsmith Street, Exeter, and baptized in its church on 17 March 1576. He was the son of Peter Vilvain (<i>d</i>. 1602), steward of Exeter in 1579, and his wife, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1616). Robert received his early education at Exeter and matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford, on 22 February 1594, aged eighteen. He graduated BA on 9 May 1597 and MA on 11 July 1600. On 30 June 1599 he was elected to a Devonian fellowship of his college, which he held until 30 June 1611.<br>
<br>Vilvain began to practise medicine about 1600, and on 20 June 1611 took the Oxford degrees of BM and DM. He was incorporated at Cambridge in 1608, and with these further degrees was reincorporated in 1612. From this date he practised with great success in his native city, where he spent the rest of his life. His wife, Ellenor, second daughter of Thomas Hinson of Tavistock, who married Anne, daughter of Sir William Spring of Pakenham, Suffolk, was buried at All Hallows, Exeter, on 7 December 1622. Their only child, Thomas, matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, on 8 April 1636, aged sixteen, graduated BCL on 7 March 1642, and died unmarried on 20 May 1651. Ten epicedial distichs composed on his death are in his father's <span class="italic">Enchiridium epigrammatum</span> (1654), leaf 185.<br>
<br>In 1640 Vilvain was one of twelve doctors&#151;five in theology, four in medicine, and three in law&#151;living in Exeter. His epigram on them, the English translation, and a list of their names are printed in Richard Izacke's <span class="italic">Antiquities of the City of Exeter</span>  (1723, 156). Thomas Fuller (1608&#150;1661), when he visited Exeter, was delighted by some rare manuscripts in Vilvain's library and his museum of natural curiosities. Vilvain's benefactions to his native city and his college were numerous and costly. He gave &pound;20 towards the cost of the new buildings at Exeter College about 1624, and he founded at the college in 1637 four exhibitions of &pound;32 each per annum, to be paid through the rector and sub-rector. For the free school at St John's Hospital, Exeter, he gave a tenement in Paris Street without the east gate of Exeter, and he erected new buildings within the hospital at a cost of about &pound;600.<br>
<br>On Vilvain's motion the corporation of Exeter in December 1657 allowed the lady chapel in the cathedral to be fitted up as a library, and the valuable collection of books then at St John's Hospital, which had previously formed the cathedral library, to be moved there. Vilvain defrayed the cost of the alterations in the lady chapel, and the care of the library was entrusted to him. The books remained there until 1820. With Vilvain's charitable benefactions and decreasing strength there came a loss of income; the preface to his <span class="italic">Enchiridium epigrammatum</span> refers to his ruined fortune. Between 17 April and 4 November 1662 there are frequent references in the state papers (domestic series) to the lease to him from 1647 by the dean and chapter of Exeter of the manor of Staverton, which he &#145;deserves to forfeit for ill-carriage during the late distractions&#146;.<br>
<br>&#145;In his younger days Vilvain was esteemed a very good poet, orator, and disputant, and, in his elder, as eminent for divinity as his proper faculty&#146;, but what should have been his most productive years were not fruitful and his writings are &#145;nothing but scraps, whimseys, and dotages of old age&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Athen&aelig; Oxon.</span>, ed. Bliss, 3.631&#150;3).<br>
<br>Vilvain died on 21 February 1663 and was buried in the north aisle of the choir of Exeter Cathedral, where a stone marks his resting place; a mural tablet to his memory was placed on the north side of the entrance to the lady chapel, but was later taken to St James's chantry.<br>
