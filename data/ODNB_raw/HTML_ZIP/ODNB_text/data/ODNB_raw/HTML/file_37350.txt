<span class="headword">Deane,  Richard</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1647&#150;1661), <span class="occ">government official and Baptist preacher</span>, came from a Gloucestershire family and was a cousin of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7388/', "Richard Deane (bap. 1610, d. 1653)")</script>, regicide and general-at-sea, but his parentage is unknown. Deane served as a captain of foot in Robert Lilburne's regiment, and he was elected to represent his regiment in the general council of the army in 1647. He became secretary or chief clerk to the army committee of the Rump from 1649 to 1653. His colonel from the winter of 1647 until 1650 was Sir Arthur Hesilrige, one of the most influential politicians of the Commonwealth.<br>
<br>In 1653 Deane followed the more militarily inclined republicans, becoming co-treasurer at war and co-receiver of the assessments with John Blackwell the younger when the army tightened its grip on the fiscal machinery of government. He held this position until the fall of the protectorate in 1659, when he took the republican side. Perhaps thanks to Hesilrige's patronage, he became clerk of the council under the restored Commonwealth of May to October 1659, and again to the committee of safety from October to December 1659. On the latter occasion he chose to serve not Hesilrige, the leading figure in the restored Rump, but the generals, notably Charles Fleetwood and John Lambert. Possibly his religious stance, as a strict Baptist, explains this. He was sent to Scotland on a confidential mission in November 1659, ostensibly to negotiate with General George Monck on behalf of the generals of England, but allegedly to attempt to undermine the loyalty of Monck's army to its commander. He failed to stop the Scottish army's march south in support of a civilian government and, ultimately, of a free parliament. After the return of the secluded members in February 1660, Deane lost his military commissions and other offices.<br>
<br>Following the Restoration, Deane was considered sufficiently dangerous to be listed as one of the twenty-one non-regicides whose property was to be forfeited, and who were excluded from office in perpetuity. He was arrested on 4 January 1661 and placed in the Marshalsea, Canterbury; his wife, Ann, petitioned for his release stating that Deane had sued out a pardon, retired to Lady Scot's house in Kent, and was living quietly. He was released on 16 January 1661 on bond for his good behaviour.<br>
<br>Deane's later career is uncertain. His identification with the Baptist preacher active in and around Bristol from the 1670s to the 1690s is probable, but there were several contemporaneous Richard Deanes with west-country connections. A Richard Deane was credited with the authorship of <span class="italic">A copy of a brief treatise of the proper subject and administration of baptism some years since sent by the author to Thomas late lord bishop of Lincoln</span>, published in 1693 but written about seven years earlier, possibly in response to James II's policy of religious toleration. In it the writer alludes to having known &#145;most persons and actions of note&#146; in the years 1649&#150;59. Deane may well have spent his last days in poverty in Foster's almshouses in Michael's parish, Bristol. He may have been the Richard Deane of Bristol whose widow, Hester, was granted administration of his estate on 8 April 1697.<br>
