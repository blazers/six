</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hunt,  John Joseph Benedict</span>, Baron Hunt of Tanworth  (1919&#150;2008), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born at Northcote, Queens Road, Minehead, Somerset, on 23 October 1919, the elder son of Lieutenant (later Major) Arthur Lionel Hunt (<i>d</i>. 1959), an officer in the Royal Artillery, and his wife, Daphne Winifred, fifth of the six daughters of Captain Henry Ashton-Case. His only sibling, his younger brother, Ronald Francis, died in infancy. His mother's family home was at Beckford Hall, Warwickshire, where the private chapel had been a centre for parish Roman Catholics for over 200 years, and which in 1936 was acquired by the Salesian order as a novitiate.<h2>
<a name="Educationwarserviceandfirstmarriage"></a>Education, war service, and first marriage</h2>At the age of nine Hunt was sent to Avisford Roman Catholic preparatory school, near Arundel, whence he passed, four years later, to the strict tutelage of the Benedictines at Downside School. He won the school history prize and was president of the debating society. He also played in the school cricket, hockey, rugby, and squash teams. In 1938 he went as an open exhibitioner to read history at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where, after two years, he was awarded a second-class war degree. His extra-curricular activities included college cricket and hockey and membership of the committees of the Cambridge Union Society and the Footlights Club.<br>
<br>In common with many undergraduates Hunt joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve on the outbreak of the Second World War and immediately after leaving Cambridge he was deployed on convoy escorts in the western approaches, earning exemplary appraisals for his organization and application. He qualified as a signals officer and in 1944 was transferred to Far Eastern sea duties serving in HMS <i>Taff</i> under Lieutenant-Commander Michael Impey, who judged him more suited to a staff job than front-line command. Nevertheless, Hunt's front-line experience included seagoing command at the age of twenty-four and taking the surrender of a Japanese garrison, receiving the general's samurai sword of command. He was released from the Royal Navy in March 1946. Meanwhile, on 16 August 1941, at the Roman Catholic chapel in Hale House (his parents' home) in Churt, Surrey, he married Magdalen Mary Lister Robinson (1921&#150;1971), younger daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35800/', "Roy Lister Robinson, later Baron Robinson")</script>, forester. They had three children: Michael (<i>b</i>. 1942), Charlotte (<i>b</i>. 1947), and Martin (<i>b</i>. 1962).<h2>
<a name="Ascendingtheladderandsecondmarriage"></a>Ascending the ladder, and second marriage</h2>In February 1946 Hunt joined the Dominions Office as a temporary administrative assistant and in April that year he took the administrative grade examination. At first put on a reserve list for successful candidates, by the end of the year he had been offered a permanent position in his first-choice department, the Dominions Office. It was not long before his organizing skills brought an appointment as private secretary to an up-and-coming parliamentary under-secretary, Patrick Gordon-Walker. The appointment proved seminal in that it gave Hunt an early experience of ministerial work (the partition of India and the dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir were dominant issues). Hunt also benefited from Gordon-Walker's advice to aim for pivotal postings in the central machine of government. On leaving Gordon-Walker's private office Hunt went as second secretary to the British high commission in Colombo, Ceylon, where he was promoted principal, before returning in 1951 to join the teaching staff of the Imperial Defence College for two years.<br>
<br>It was during a subsequent posting, as first secretary in the British high commission in Ottawa, that Hunt's adaptability in getting things done was spotted by the cabinet secretary, Sir Norman Brook. As a result, in 1956 Hunt found himself in the cabinet office for the first time, as private secretary to Brook. Brook was the secretary of the Egypt committee and one of the few civil servants privy to Anthony Eden's thoughts during the Suez crisis. Nevertheless, Hunt maintained in later life that Brook kept things so close to his chest that his private secretary knew little of what was happening.<br>
<br>After a further short spell in London with the Commonwealth Relations Office, in April 1960 Hunt was back again in the cabinet office, as secretary to the joint intelligence committee. When he left in May 1962 the committee recorded their &#145;warmest thanks for the magnificent work Mr Hunt had done which had extended well beyond what was normally regarded as the scope of the Secretary, and upon which [the chairman, Sir Hugh Stephenson] had greatly relied&#146;  (JIC minutes, 10 May 1962, TNA: PRO, CAB 159/37). Thereafter he spent six years (1962&#150;7) on mainstream economic work at the Treasury.<br>
<br>From 1968 to 1971, as a deputy secretary, Hunt served as first civil service commissioner, responsible for the integrity of fair and open competition for appointment to the civil service. He took particular objection to the Fulton committee's damning judgement on civil service recruitment, believing it to be prejudice without a sound basis of evidence. He defended the civil service commission against the committee's strictures and sought the backing of Sir William Armstrong, the head of the home civil service, asking him to intervene to attempt to redress the balance of view. During this same period he was influential in reducing the archaic class barriers that inhibited the effective use of all civil servants, whatever their social origins. From 1971 to 1972 he was a third secretary in the Treasury, where his duties included chairmanship of the committee charged with running programme analysis and review. He later described this initiative (intended to ensure that departments presented clear statements of objectives before any resources were allocated) as a system which &#145;created a great deal of work but not much in the way of results&#146;  (Plowden, 67), but it convinced him of the need for central initiatives to handle cross-cutting issues, driven by a departmentally neutral body like the cabinet office or the new Central Policy Review Staff (also established in 1971).<br>
<br>In 1971 Magdalen, Hunt's wife of thirty years, died, leaving Hunt to bring up their younger son (then aged nine). He was remarried two years later, at the Carmelite church in Kensington on 15 September 1973, to Madeleine Frances Charles (1919&#150;2007), the widow of Sir John Charles, a former chief medical officer, daughter of Sir William Errington Hume, cardiologist, and sister of Basil Hume (later cardinal and archbishop of Westminster). He became stepfather to her son and daughter.<h2>
<a name="Cabinetsecretary"></a>Cabinet secretary</h2>Hunt succeeded Sir Burke Trend as cabinet secretary in October 1973 and remained in post until the end of 1979, serving four prime ministers (Edward Heath, Harold Wilson, James Callaghan, and Margaret Thatcher). It is not known whom Trend had favoured as his successor, nor if he offered advice on the matter. But early in 1972 William Armstrong had commended Hunt to Heath as outstanding among his contemporaries and marked out by &#145;his personal qualities of drive, energy and leadership. He combines a strong and stable personality with the ability to get on with other people both inside the Service and in public life generally&#146;  (W. Armstrong to R. Armstrong, 2 March 1972, cabinet office papers). The result was a further posting (1972&#150;3) as second permanent secretary in the cabinet office and heir apparent to Trend, during which time his managerial drive helped establish two new bodies: a European unit to support ministers in managing the United Kingdom's new membership of the European Communities; and a civil contingencies unit to replace the Home Office emergencies organization, with which Heath had been dissatisfied during the 1972 miners' strike.<br>
<br>The 1970s were years of domestic economic decline, poor industrial relations (known as &#145;the English disease&#146;), and precarious governments. Internationally it was a time of upheaval in the Middle East and in world economic power as oil price rises triggered recession in the West. In 1976 the government of James Callaghan was forced to seek funds from the International Monetary Fund as the markets lost confidence in sterling, resulting in a public expenditure crisis that threatened to split the cabinet irrevocably. Hunt's great contribution was that he so managed the flow of cabinet business and the advice on handling cabinet members that cabinet government never ceased to function. During the nine cabinet meetings on the loan Hunt passed manuscript notes to Callaghan with advice on handling the participants and keeping the discussion in play to the point where collective responsibility could prevail. At the same time he was working with Sir Kenneth Berrill of the Central Policy Review Staff to prepare a most sensitive doomsday scenario, of which only four copies were made; and he went to Germany on a secret mission for the prime minister to solicit the help of the federal government in securing the necessary financial support to calm the markets.<br>
<br>Internationally Hunt created the &#145;sherpa&#146; role as the prime minister's personal representative preparing for the biannual economic summits of Western leaders. He maintained a strong relationship with successive American national security advisers, patiently engaging in the diplomacy around the 1974 defence review and later helping Callaghan secure the agreement of Jimmy Carter to supply Trident missiles to upgrade the Polaris deterrent. He worked successfully behind the scenes to preserve the intelligence &#145;special relationship&#146; between the two countries, while domestically he revived and revitalized oversight of the intelligence agencies on behalf of the prime minister, notably in the aftermath of the United States Watergate scandal.<br>
<br>Constitutionally there were important innovations. The general election of February 1974 produced a hung parliament; this outcome had been foreseen and plans developed accordingly&#151;mainly by Heath's principal private secretary, Robert Armstrong, but with contributions from Hunt on precedents. The incoming Harold Wilson created a policy unit under Bernard Donoughue to work exclusively for him. It was not universally welcomed by permanent secretaries but Hunt wisely set out to implement Wilson's intentions, negotiating a protocol with Donoughue covering the relationship between the new unit and civil servants which smoothed the way forward. A further innovation was preservation of collective responsibility through the cabinet's &#145;agreement to differ&#146; over the 1975 referendum on whether to remain a member of the European Community, the work being driven by the European unit in the cabinet office, which was led by Sir Patrick Nairne and reported to Hunt. The fourth innovation was the establishment of a constitution unit in the cabinet office to handle the Callaghan government's proposals for devolution of powers to Scotland and Wales. Hunt was himself sceptical of the ideas, being one of the first to point up the &#145;West Lothian&#146; problem that Scottish and Welsh MPs would continue to have powers to vote on issues that would only concern England (whereas English MPs would lose their powers over similar matters affecting Scotland or Wales).<br>
<br>There were also defeats. Neither Hunt nor ministers were quite ready for the ruthless and single-minded pursuit of its shareholders' interests by the Chrysler Corporation when it sought $32 million of UK government aid and threatened to close its UK operations (which employed 26,000) by the spring of 1976. On another occasion Callaghan took some delight in reading out a letter from Cardinal Hume stressing a moral imperative not to sell armed vehicles to El Salvador&#151;which Hunt had briefed in favour of doing. But the greatest defeat was when Harold Wilson put Hunt forward to prevent the publication of Richard Crossman's diaries, which drove a coach and horses through the then conventional interpretation in Whitehall of cabinet confidentiality. Hunt himself undoubtedly thought that publication would be wrong but he was also the front man for ministers and struggled to convince the lord chief justice, Lord Widgery, of the government's case. Public opinion was shifting towards greater openness about government actions in its name and government was lagging behind. The case to prevent publication was lost, leading to new rules of behaviour about ministerial memoirs, including a fifteen-year moratorium before revealing cabinet discussions.<br>
<br>Contemporaries spoke with reverence of Hunt's skill at chairing meetings. A fellow permanent secretary described it as knowing where he wanted to get to&#151;and getting there. He captured the essence of his approach in a short guide, &#145;The dos and don'ts of chairmanship&#146;, published in the civil service journal, <span class="italic">Management Services in Government</span>, in 1977. He was made a CB in 1968, knighted KCB in 1973, and promoted GCB in 1977. He was made a life peer, as Baron Hunt of Tanworth, in 1980.<h2>
<a name="Retirementandcharacter"></a>Retirement and character</h2>In retirement Hunt was greatly in demand. His directorships included the Prudential Corporation (of which he was chairman from 1985 to 1990), IBM (UK) Ltd, and the UK arm of the Banque Nationale de Paris (of which he was chairman from 1980 to 1997). In 1982 a committee under his leadership produced an influential and notably liberal report supporting the widespread expansion of cable broadcasting. He was chairman of the House of Lords subcommittee on European trade and industry in 1992&#150;5 when it investigated fraud in the European Union; the subcommittee's report, published in 1994, estimated the cost of such fraud at &pound;5 billion a year. Other chairmanships included the Disasters Emergency Committee (1981&#150;9), the Ditchley Foundation (1983&#150;91), and the European Policy Forum (1992&#150;8). But perhaps the achievement he was most proud of was his chairmanship (from 1984 to 1996) of the trust that published <span class="italic">The Tablet</span>, and his oversight of the financial rescue of that publication.<br>
<br>The dominant influence in Hunt's life was his Roman Catholic faith. In later life he carried with him a prayer by Cardinal Newman which begins: &#145;God has created me to do Him some definite service&#146;. To colleagues he was unfailingly courteous and often kind, though at first sight he could appear forbidding and unapproachable. He was supremely able to compartmentalize the formidable array of issues crossing his desk. He had the gift of making younger colleagues feel that there was no one else he would rather be speaking to at the time. By contrast, some senior colleagues never felt that they got close to him, but as one of them said, &#145;He made the Cabinet Office into a real Department&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Hunt died on 17 July 2008 at his home, 8 Wool Road, Wimbledon, of cancer. A requiem mass was held in Westminster Cathedral on 29 October. He was survived by his two sons and his two stepchildren, his daughter having predeceased him in 1995.<br>
