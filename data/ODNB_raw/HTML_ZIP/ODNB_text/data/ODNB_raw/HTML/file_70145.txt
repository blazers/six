<span class="headword">Besse,  Antonin</span>  (1877&#150;1951), <span class="occ">entrepreneur and benefactor</span>, was born on 26 June 1877 at Carcassonne in southern France, the third son and fourth child in the family of four boys and three girls of Pierre Besse, leather merchant, and his wife, Marie Bonnafous. In failing health Pierre Besse moved his family to Montpellier, where he died in 1884.<br>
<br>Besse attended the local <i>lyc&eacute;e</i> but failed his <i>baccalaur&eacute;at</i>, and after four years' military service he joined a coffee-exporting firm in Aden in 1899. He later set up in business in Aden on his own, keeping himself fit with tennis, swimming, and mountaineering. In 1908 he married Marguerite Hortense Eulalie Godefroid, who came from a wealthy Brussels family, with whom he had a son and a daughter. She contributed money from her private fortune and kept the firm's books. Besse began trading in a wide variety of products, from hides and skins to incense, exploiting the huge demand from churches and mosques. In the seven years to 1914 his annual profits increased twentyfold.<br>
<br>After 1918 Besse opened offices in London and Marseilles, and added steamships to his extensive fleet of dhows. Two years later the errors of a partner left him with large debts. When his creditors threatened to bankrupt him he won an agreement to repay in instalments. This setback was compounded when, in 1922, his wife divorced him. The financial wranglings were acrimonious and long drawn out, and left him with a further massive overdraft, not finally paid off until after his death. In 1923 he married, as his second wife, an employee, Hilda Florence Crowther (1890&#150;1981), daughter of Thomas Crowther, a businessman and his wife, Margaret Leitch, with whom he had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Besse was small, roundish, and keen on creature comforts: his own generator for electricity, the best chef in Aden, a piano and gramophone for his beloved classical music, and hundreds of books, which he devoured while making extensive notes and reading aloud whenever possible. He had a good eye for nature and a quick and exceptionally receptive mind. Those admitted to his hospitality on the roof of his apartment over the business premises in Aden were enchanted by the Arabian Nights atmosphere of luxury. He impressed even hardened travellers such as Freya Stark and Evelyn Waugh, the former dubbing him &#145;a wonderful man who lets life play upon him as if he were an instrument responsive to all its variations&#146;  (Stark, 41).<br>
<br>Besse had a natural empathy for the Eastern mind and spoke fluent, if idiosyncratic, Arabic. However, he showed scant consideration for his expatriate staff; the men were not paid well and they seldom stayed for long. He could be mean with money and would travel second class on European railways. Despite his many failings he and his second wife were devoted to each other, regularly occupying their respective desks in the office. His son and daughter from his first marriage also kept in touch with him.<br>
<br>In 1923 Besse became an agent for Royal Dutch-Shell, distributing oil products throughout the Red Sea area. His vast local knowledge and attention to detail allowed him to hold his own against very powerful American rivals. He later acquired other commercial agencies, entered the sugar- and pilgrim-transporting trades, and even made money out of waste paper. The world depression of 1929&#150;33 hit him badly but his firm soon recovered. His 1937 venture, Arabian Airways Ltd, was one of his very few business failures. The next few years were the most successful in the firm's history; in 1940, however, he injured his back very seriously in an aircraft crash, and this much reduced his energies while inflicting great physical pain. In France during the German occupation, he succeeded in returning to Aden via New York, Colombo, and Bombay. He had already placed all his business interests at the disposal of the British government.<br>
<br>After 1945 Besse started up new ventures in Aden and Ethiopia but as he approached his seventieth year he spent increasingly long periods away from the firm, his son Tony taking the reins. Having made a number of benefactions in the Near East, during 1947 he proposed the establishment of an educational foundation to encourage personal initiative and independence of thought. His approach to the French authorities was rebuffed on bureaucratic grounds, and he at once turned to Britain, where soundings were made on his behalf. The foundation of a college in an existing university seemed the most practicable plan, and Oxford was finally chosen.<br>
<br>Although in the spring of 1948 Besse had a severe stroke he was able to visit Oxford incognito, and that September the university's congregation approved the proposal of a donation of &pound;1,500,000 for a postgraduate college, one third of the students to be French nationals. Although his name was initially kept secret the chosen title was St Antony's College. Besse earmarked &pound;250,000 of this benefaction to help the less well-endowed Oxford colleges to improve their teaching and other facilities. A former Anglican convent in Woodstock Road was acquired and Frederick William Deakin appointed the first warden. Besse was also generous to Gordonstoun School, whose spartan regime chimed with his view of what the wimpishly-inclined younger generation really needed.<br>
<br>In the new year honours of 1951 Besse, a French national, was created an honorary KBE for public services in the British colony of Aden. Shortly afterwards Oxford University offered him an honorary doctorate of civil law, which was conferred at a private ceremony in June of the same year. Shortly afterwards, at Gordonstoun, Besse was taken gravely ill with thrombosis and double pneumonia. He died there on 2 July 1951, and was buried near the family retreat at Le Paradou, outside Toulon.<br>
