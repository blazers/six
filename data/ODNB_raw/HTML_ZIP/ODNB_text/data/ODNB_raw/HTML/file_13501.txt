<span class="headword">Hole,  Matthew</span>  (1639/40&#150;1730), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious writer</span>, is of unknown origins. He matriculated as servitor from Exeter College, Oxford, on 18 March 1658 and graduated BA on 15 October 1661. Elected to a Devonshire fellowship on 30 June 1663 and to a full fellowship on 2 July 1664, he proceeded MA (1664), BD (1674), and DD (1716). Having taken deacon's orders he was appointed lecturer of St Martin's, Carfax, Oxford, on 18 December 1668. In June 1669 he was ordained priest by Bishop Walter Blandford at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, and held the vicarage of Bishops Lavington, Wiltshire, from 1673 to 1674. Through the influence of his friend Henry Godolphin, a fellow of Eton College, he was presented by the college to the vicarage of Stogursey, Somerset, in January 1688. He was made a prebendary of Wells Cathedral on 1 March 1688 and vacated his fellowship of Exeter in February 1689. From 1708 to 1711 he also held the living of Fiddington, Somerset.<br>
<br>Hole delighted in preaching and preached in many churches in Somerset as well as before the University of Oxford. His sermons were clear and straightforward and not overtly intellectual. He stirred up controversy, however, with a visitation sermon on a fixed form of liturgy that he delivered at Bridgwater on 19 August 1695. It provoked an exchange of pamphlets with John Moore (1642&#150;1717), Presbyterian minister in Bridgwater, in 1698 and 1699. He continued to write in defence of the established church and published a two-part rejoinder, <span class="italic">An Antidote Against Infidelity</span> (1702, 1717), to William Coward's <span class="italic">Second Thoughts Concerning Human Soul</span> (1702).<br>
<br>Hole returned to Oxford after his election as rector of Exeter College on 8 March 1716. Two other candidates for the post had divided the college on party lines, and Hole had been chosen as a compromise. He was readmitted to a fellowship in 1718. He was unable to impose his will on the college and became embroiled in a long-running dispute with the fellows and the visitor over the plans of Richard Newton to turn Hart Hall, a tenant of Exeter, into a college. While rector he succeeded, however, in completing his most significant work, with publication of the fourth volume of his weighty <span class="italic">Practical Discourses upon the Communion Service</span> (1714&#150;19). He continued to preach to within a year or so of his death and, according to Thomas Hearne, did not need spectacles even in his eighties. He never married and was cared for by two nieces who lived with him in his final years.<br>
<br>Hole died in his college lodgings on 19 July 1730, aged ninety, and was buried in the chapel on 21 July. He had a reputation for parsimony in his lifetime but left several charitable bequests in his will, including &pound;200 for two charity schools in Oxford and &pound;100 to his college towards building a new library.<br>
