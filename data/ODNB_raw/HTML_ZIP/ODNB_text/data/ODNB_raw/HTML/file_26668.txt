<span class="headword">Strickland,  Thomas John Francis</span>  (<em>c.</em>1682&#150;1740), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic bishop of Namur and diplomatist</span>, was the fourth son of Sir Thomas Strickland (1621&#150;1694) of Sizergh, Westmorland, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74354/', "Winifred Strickland, n&#233;e Trentham (1645&#150;1725)")</script>. He spent his early years at the family seat of Sizergh Castle, where he was educated by Thomas Shepherd, who served as his personal tutor. However, following the collapse of King James II's regime his parents fled to France, and it was not until April 1689 that the necessary passes were obtained that enabled him to follow them into exile. On 18 April 1689 Strickland was stopped by the authorities at Dover, together with another of his siblings and his tutor, on the suspicion of Jacobitism. Fortunately, they were allowed to take ship after producing their letters of safe conduct and arrived at the court of St Germain without further incident or mishap.<br>
<br>After being raised in the household of the fallen Stuarts, Strickland was admitted into St Gregory's College, Paris, at his own expense, on 9 January 1703 to study for the priesthood. Thereafter, his educational career would seem to have been both lengthy and chequered. He appears to have studied at St Sulpice in Paris from April 1704 onwards before returning to St Gregory's in October 1711. He took the degree of doctor of divinity at the Sorbonne in 1712, and left St Gregory's following his ordination as a priest on 2 April 1712. He tended a side chapel in the church of St Sulpice for some months before returning to England&#151;and Sizergh&#151;in 1713. It is probable that he used his time to travel through the northern counties, taking soundings&#151;and gathering intelligence&#151;from the leading recusant families, and his resulting notes formed the basis of his <span class="italic">Memoir on the State of the English Mission</span>. This work, written in French in 1714, was submitted by him to the papal internuncio in Flanders, and was subsequently forwarded to the office of the propaganda in Rome.<br>
<br>Having thus come to the notice of the hierarchy of the church, Strickland was noted as being &#145;ardently ambitious of the episcopal dignity for himself&#146;  (Brady, 3.154), and in 1716 he lobbied hard for his own appointment as co-adjutor to Bishop Bonaventure Giffard of the London district, who was then seventy-four years of age. In this he was supported by John Talbot Stonor, a friend from St Gregory's who had become bishop of Thespiae and vicar apostolic of the midland district that year. It is clear that Strickland had already broken, decisively, with the Jacobite movement that had nurtured him, and it would seem highly likely that it was primarily political considerations that motivated the storm of criticism and complaint that greeted his candidature for the post. Bishop Giffard provided evidence of his own continuing health and competency, while his ally Bishop George Witham appealed to Rome against: &#145;Strickland &hellip; [who] was possessed of less capacity than any of the persons who had been &hellip; proposed for the office of Vicar Apostolic in England, especially as he was very young and had but recently been introduced into England&#146;  (Hornyold, 151). Stonor himself said that he thought Strickland vain and lacking in judgement, and that he could &#145;neither keep his own counsel nor anybody's else&#146;  (Duffy, 351). In the face of such strong feeling and bitter censure Strickland's candidature collapsed.<br>
<br>Strickland had, however, gained a powerful patron in the form of Thomas Howard, eighth duke of Norfolk. Norfolk began negotiations with the papacy in 1716 in order to obtain the pope's support for an oath that would allow English Catholics to swear allegiance to George I, and thereby prepare the ground for the removal of some at least of their civil disabilities. Strickland put pressure on the papal nuncio at Brussels, and succeeded in obtaining a preliminary agreement by which English Catholics would be able to swear allegiance to George I, provided the oath made no mention of the papal dispensing and disposing powers. Strickland also visited Hanover, where he gained the support of George I for the proposed oath. Norfolk sent Strickland on a mission to Rome, where he arrived by Easter 1717, in order to secure papal approval for the scheme. Strickland proved himself to be an intelligent, highly articulate, and socially adept envoy. He won verbal agreement for the desired change in church policy, but his actions also brought him the undying enmity of the Jacobites. Unfortunately, even though the church authorities had committed themselves verbally to the agreement, Strickland's appeals that the decision should be set down in writing and published as a decree were rejected by the church, which did not want to alienate the Jacobites. Consequently, on his arrival in Flanders to inform the nuncio of the pontiff's tacit recognition of the protestant succession, he found his credibility substantially weakened.<br>
<br>Strickland's efforts were still supported by Norfolk, Stonor, and other leading English Catholics, and in spring 1718 he travelled to Paris. There, he contacted John Dalrymple, second earl of Stair, British minister to France, and presented a short memorial to him outlining the plight of English Catholics and arguing that, in return for toleration, they might be persuaded formally to renounce their support for the beleaguered Jacobite cause and be usefully employed within the British governmental structure. Such an offer proved extremely attractive, and Lord Stair was quick to recommend Strickland as &#145;a sensible, good-natured man, who seems concerned for the good and quiet of his country and for the good of the Roman Catholics themselves&#146;  (Hornyold, 152).<br>
<br>In order to drive a wedge more firmly between English Catholics and the exiled Jacobites, Strickland returned to England in July 1718 and composed and published an anonymous pamphlet purporting to be <span class="italic">A letter from a gentleman at R<span class="roman">[ome]</span> dated September 15, 1718, to a friend at L<span class="roman">[ondon]</span></span>. In it he presented an unflattering portrait of James Francis Edward, the Pretender, as a religious bigot and as the unwitting pawn of the &#145;perfectly Despotic&#146; John Erskine, twenty-third or sixth earl of Mar. The pair were shown presiding over their tattered and threadbare court at Urbino, unable to pay the wages of their followers and ridiculing the attempts of the English Jacobites to win back the throne for them. Only Scotsmen, &#145;my Lord M[ar]'s Kindred and Creatures&#146;, were to be valued, and the first effect of a new restoration was confidently predicted to be the &#145;Inundation of S[cots] without Merit [into England], greedy of Money &hellip; fancying that all our Treasure will be little enough to reward them&#146;  (Strickland, 5&#150;6). Following the pamphlet's appearance Strickland received death threats and had his appointment as the vicar-general of Meaux blocked at the behest of Mary of Modena, the Pretender's mother. General Arthur Dillon considered Strickland, as the author of the &#145;scurrilous, malicious English epistle, which is handed about here &hellip; capable of everything base and unworthy&#146;  (Hornyold, 153), while the earl of Mar&#151;predictably&#151;branded his critic as &#145;a little, conceited, empty, meddling prig&#146;  (<span class="italic">Stuart Papers</span>, 7.493). For his part, the Pretender could only pity Dr Strickland's &#145;poor mother&#146;  (ibid., 7.544&#150;5), who still continued in her devotion to his flagging cause.<br>
<br>Strickland returned to Paris by September 1718. The British government was keen to protect its ally, and to see that he was properly rewarded for his services and promoted to high office within the Catholic church. Consequently, vigorous appeals were made to Philippe, duke of Orl&eacute;ans, the regent of France, in order to settle a suitable benefice upon Strickland. The vacant abbey of St Pierre de Preaux in Normandy&#151;which carried with it a stipend of between 12,000 and 15,000 livres&#151;was granted to him on 25 August 1718.<br>
<br>Having been presented to the regent, and thanked him for the gift of the abbey, Strickland travelled to Vienna in January 1719 with a formal diplomatic commission from George I. He was to engineer an alliance between the pope and the emperor, and destroy the influence of Jacobite agents at the imperial court. The emperor would then persuade the pope to give final approval to the proposed oath of allegiance. On 8 February 1719 he was confidently writing to secretary of state James Craggs of his great success with Charles VI. He left Vienna in March, and in June judged it safe to return to England. He took lodgings in London, and formulated a series of proposals&#151;with the approval of Craggs and the British government&#151;which aimed to secure Catholic toleration in return for the acknowledgement of the protestant succession, the severing of all communications with the Pretender, and the removal of the office and title of protector of England from the pro-Jacobite Cardinal Gualterio, at the court of Rome. However, resistance to his plans was strong among many leading English Catholics, who found Strickland self-serving and arrogant. Strickland advised Craggs to arrest Bishop Giffard, Gilbert Talbot, thirteenth earl of Shrewsbury (a Jesuit), and other Catholics in order to leave the way clear for negotiations with more moderate and amenable figures. Some arrests were made, and Strickland met Norfolk on 7 July, but an impasse had been reached over the refusal of the government to allow Catholics to take the oath of allegiance alongside an oath to uphold the authority of the pope. In addition, the ministry of which Strickland had become an agent was perceived as weak. It was opposed in the Commons by Robert Walpole, widely expected to return to power, who employed strongly anti-Catholic rhetoric and who could not be expected to maintain any agreement made on the Catholic question. Strickland's reliance on the authority of the emperor also unsettled English Catholics, as it seemed to confirm protestant allegations that they were subjects of a foreign prince. The negotiations broke up without the issue of Jacobitism ever having been adequately addressed by Norfolk, and Strickland's proposals were comprehensively rejected by his co-religionists. Saddened and gravely dismayed, Strickland left England. The British government continued to regard him as the English Catholics' principal negotiator, but further efforts to revive the allegiance proposals proved fruitless. The return of Walpole to power in 1721 and the revelation of the Jacobite plot of Francis Atterbury, bishop of Rochester, ended hopes that the English Catholics would be able to reach an accommodation with the British government.<br>
<br>Strickland had by then settled at the court of the exiled king of Poland, Stanis&#322;aw Leszczy&#324;ski, at Bar, in Lorraine. He was later to claim that he had obtained a cardinal's hat from Stanis&#322;aw, but had chosen to resign it upon a point of conscience. More probably, Stanis&#322;aw had nominated Strickland as a cardinal after coming under sustained pressure from the British government, and Strickland had then sold the nomination to the emperor for a lump sum and the promise of his support in securing the bishopric of Namur. With the full backing of Charles VI, Strickland was proposed as the new bishop of Namur in 1725, and was finally consecrated by the archbishop of Malines (Mechelen) on Sunday 28 February 1728. He made his entry into his cathedral at Namur on the eve of Pentecost, and celebrated his first pontifical mass the next day, 16 May 1728.<br>
<br>Strickland's taste for diplomatic intrigue had not deserted him. He visited Rome and Vienna in 1733 in an attempt to gather intelligence on the Jacobite exiles domiciled there. His desire to become a cardinal looked like finally being realized as the British government championed his appointment with the Austrians and as he won the trust and friendship of the empress. However, in deciding to carry the prospect of a military alliance between Britain and the imperial court back to Whitehall, at the behest of Charles VI, he at last overreached himself. He returned to London in autumn 1734 disguised as a Mr Mosley, where he attempted to promote the alliance and urged a declaration of war with France. He impressed both George II and Queen Caroline during a private interview, and attempted to form a war party about William Stanhope, Baron Harrington, which might have been capable of replacing Sir Robert Walpole's ministry. However, Walpole's spies had &#145;dogged and traced him to every place he had frequented from his first coming to England, [and] soon found what he drove at&#146;  (Hervey, 2.395). Consequently Walpole was able to destroy utterly Strickland's credit with the king and queen by pointing out that the bishop&#151;&#145;though now near three-score&#146;&#151;had been repeatedly observed going out &#145;late at night on foot, and wrapped up in a red rug riding coat&#146;  (ibid.) to an infamous local brothel. At the same time Walpole posted dispatches to the emperor alleging that Strickland was in correspondence with his domestic and foreign foes, while Harrington suddenly withdrew from his advocacy of the bishop's embassy, swayed by information from one of his own clients that Strickland not only aimed to have a cardinal's hat but also aimed: &#145;[as] his principle ambition &hellip; to slip himself, by one means or other, into some share of the ministry&#146;  (Coxe, 3.177). With his reputation as a diplomat effectively destroyed, Strickland was firmly but &#145;civilly dismissed&#146;  (ibid., 2.444) and returned to France.<br>
<br>Ensconced at his see of Namur, Strickland proved to be&#151;even by the admission of his enemies&#151;a popular, diligent, and wholly competent administrator. He enlarged the cathedral, endowed a seminary, and built a large episcopal palace. However, having distinguished himself as an enthusiastic patron of artists, musicians, and sculptors, he suddenly fell ill towards the end of 1739 and retired to Louvain in a forlorn attempt to regain his failing health. He died at Louvain quickly and peacefully on 14 January 1740 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, and his body was brought back to lie in state at the episcopal palace at Namur. He was buried in the vaults of his own cathedral on the evening of 16 January 1740, but no stone or inscription was ever raised to honour and perpetuate his memory.<br>
<br>Reviled as an &#145;inveterate wire-puller&#146;  (Scott, 191), Strickland was said to have been possessed of &#145;an artful and intriguing &hellip; manner&#146;  (Hervey, 1.392) and to have &#145;passed his whole life in gluttony, drunkenness, and the most infamous debauchery&#146;  (Coxe, 1.443). Yet he won a reputation for fairness and financial probity while at Namur, and genuinely sought to improve the political condition of the English Catholics by dissociating them from Jacobitism in return for a guarantee of civil and legal rights from the Hanoverian British government.<br>
