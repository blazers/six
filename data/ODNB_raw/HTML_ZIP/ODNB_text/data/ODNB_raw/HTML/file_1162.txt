<span class="headword">Clare,  Baldwin  de</span> <span class="st"> [Baldwin fitz Gilbert]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1130&#150;1154), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, is called thus once by Orderic Vitalis, but was more usually known as Baldwin, son of Gilbert (Baldwin fitz Gilbert). He was a younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5436/', "Gilbert de Clare (d. 1117)")</script>, the second post-conquest lord of Clare, and Alice, daughter of Hugues or Hugh, count of Clermont in northern France. He was thus the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5446/', "Richard fitz Gilbert de Clare")</script>, lord of Clare, Tonbridge, and Ceredigion, and of Gilbert, earl of Pembroke (<i>d</i>. 1148). Before 1130 Baldwin bought for himself from Henry I the marriage of Aelina, heir of Richard and William de Rollos, whose lands centred on Bourne, Lincolnshire.<br>
<br>On the seizure of the throne by Stephen, Baldwin supported the new king, and seems to have remained loyal to him: he therefore supported the new regime at a time when his brother Richard opposed it. Following the ambush and murder of Richard in Wales in April 1136 Stephen gave Baldwin a large sum of money and sent him to take charge of the situation. Baldwin hired knights and archers, and arrived at Brecon to hear that the Welsh were out in force and had blocked the roads by felling trees. &#145;Struck with fear&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gesta Stephani</span>, 13) he stayed where he was, hoping to wear the Welsh out or starve them out, but he used up his own supplies first and returned to England needy and discredited. More heroic were his actions at the battle of Lincoln on 2 February 1141. One chronicler attributes to him a lengthy speech to Stephen's troops before the battle, on the justness of Stephen's cause, the superiority of his forces, and the shortcomings of his opponents. Baldwin was among those who fought dismounted round King Stephen, and, when the cavalry fled, &#145;stood loyally by the king and fought courageously with him to the end&#146;  (Ordericus Vitalis, <span class="italic">Eccl. hist.</span>, 6.544). He was severely wounded, and was captured.<br>
<br>Baldwin de Clare and Aelina had a son, Roger, who does not appear to have survived his father, and three daughters; Emma married Hugh Wake, and Margaret married Robert, younger son of Aubrey de Vere. Emma seems to have transmitted the bulk of the inheritance to her Wake descendants. The other daughter, also Margaret, to whom Aelina gave three estates that Baldwin left to his wife on his deathbed, is not known to have married. In 1138 Baldwin founded Bourne Abbey, a house of Arrouaisian canons, to which he gave ten churches on his lands. He gave to Thorney Abbey the church of Deeping St James, Lincolnshire, where a small cell took shape; he occurs as a witness of several charters of Henry I and Stephen for Thorney, and was clearly a friend of that house. He also confirmed gifts of Hugh of Envermeu to the monks of St Lawrence, Envermeu, a priory of Bec in Normandy, and thus continued his family's friendship with Bec. The date of his death is unknown; he was still alive in 1154, but by 1166 his lands were held by his son-in-law Hugh Wake.<br>
