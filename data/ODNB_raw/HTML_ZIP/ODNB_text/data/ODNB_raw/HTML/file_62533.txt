<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Chippendale,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1718, <em>d.</em> 1779), <span class="occ">cabinet-maker and designer</span>, was baptized on 5 June 1718 in the parish church of Otley, a small market town in Wharfedale, Yorkshire, the only child of John Chippindale (<i>bap</i>. 1690, <i>d</i>. 1768), joiner, and his first wife, Mary (1693&#150;1729), daughter of Thomas Drake, stonemason of Otley. His father remarried and had seven more children. Many of Thomas Chippendale's relations were involved in the timber and woodworking trades in this vicinity, so young Thomas probably served a family apprenticeship and received an elementary education at Otley grammar school. The location of the family home may have been in Boroughgate.<br>
<br>As a young man Chippendale was almost certainly employed by Richard Wood, a leading joiner and cabinet-maker of York, who later ordered eight subscription copies of <span class="italic">The Director</span>. One of his apprentices, William Benson, became foreman in Chippendale's London workshop, and in 1771, while working at Nostell Priory, Chippendale asked his former master to supply six locks and to silver a looking-glass. In later life he probably came to regard York, rather than Otley, as his natural base in Yorkshire, although a deed dated 28 July 1770, in which &#145;Thomas Chippendale of St Martin's Lane, London, Cabinet Maker&#146; assisted one of his kinsmen over the conveyancing of property in Otley, shows that he maintained links with his birthplace. The oft-quoted myth that the young Chippendale was employed and encouraged by local grandees such as the Lascelles and Winn families for whom he later provided extensive furnishings cannot be substantiated.<h2>
<a name="StMartinsLane"></a>St Martin's Lane</h2>The earliest evidence of Chippendale's presence in London is the licence recording his marriage to Catherine Redshaw at St George's Chapel, Mayfair, on 19 May 1748 in which he was described as being from the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields. Nothing is known about his wife's background, but it seems unlikely that she provided much in the way of capital or social contacts to improve his condition. Their eldest child, Thomas, was baptized at St Paul's, Covent Garden, in April 1749 and they subsequently had another four boys and four girls. At Christmas 1749 Chippendale rented a modest house in Conduit Court, an enclave off Long Acre, close to the manufacturing centre of many of the luxury trades. At mid-summer 1752 he moved to more respectable premises in Somerset Court, off the Strand, adjoining the earl of Northumberland's great mansion. At this time it is likely that he was making small quantities of furniture for established firms on a subcontracted basis rather than dealing directly with clients. Nevertheless a bald statement in Lord Burlington's private account book for 13 October 1747 recording a payment &#145;to Chippendale in full &pound;6&#150;16&#150;0d&#146; suggests that he had already come to the notice of certain &#145;Persons of Distinction&#146; and &#145;eminent Taste&#146; who, he claimed, encouraged him to publish <span class="italic">The Director</span>. He may also have provided designs for furniture and upholder's trade on a freelance basis.<br>
<br>During 1753 Chippendale prepared the drawings for his ambitious publication <span class="italic">The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker's Director</span> to be dedicated to the earl of Northumberland. Matthias Darly, who engraved most of the plates and who may also have been Chippendale's drawing-master, shared the house for several months in 1753. The two also collaborated on a characteristic rococo invitation ticket for a fellow furniture maker, Caesar Crouch, who later helped organize an appeal for Chippendale's workmen who lost their toolboxes in the fire of 1755.<br>
<br>The year 1754 was momentous for Chippendale: he moved to spacious premises in the fashionable paved thoroughfare of St Martin's Lane (later numbered 60, 61, and 62, opposite the present-day Albery Theatre) which the firm occupied as tenants of Lord Salisbury until 1813; he formed a partnership with James Rannie, a Scottish merchant who provided the capital; and he brought out the first edition of his highly influential furniture pattern book <span class="italic">The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker's Director</span>, copies of which, as the dual appeal of the title intended, were acquired by the nobility, gentry, and many fellow tradesmen. The property consisted of three houses then opposite Old Slaughter's Coffee House, a venue of some of the most interesting avant-garde artists and designers of this period (none of whom, however, were subscribers to <span class="italic">The Director</span>). Other furniture makers operating in St Martin's Lane at this time included John Channon, William Hallett, William Vile, and John Cobb. No. 60 became Chippendale's dwelling, no. 61 the shop, and Rannie lived at no. 62. A plan of the premises of 1803 showed that a covered passageway led to a yard and extensive workshops at the back including a chair room, cabinet-maker's shops, veneering, carpet, glass, and feather rooms, a large upholsterer's shop, various timber stores, workrooms, and a counting house. The name of the new establishment was the Cabinet and Upholstery Warehouse and the partners adopted a chair as their shop sign&#151;presumably the stylish armchair featured on their trade card. No partnership agreement with Rannie has been traced, but their formal association evidently dates from about August 1754 when a joint lease on the St Martin's Lane property was signed. Rannie and his bookkeeper, Thomas Haig, probably looked after the accounting side of the business.<br>
<br>The Sun Fire Insurance ledgers reveal that in March 1755 the partners' premises, utensils, and stock-in-trade were covered for &pound;3700. That April a fire destroyed their cabinet workshop, for which they were compensated with &pound;847. However, some twenty-two journeymen lost their toolboxes which were uninsured. Since the fire gutted only the cabinet shop, it is likely that Chippendale's workforce at this time might have numbered considerably more, possibly between forty and fifty artisans&#151;including cabinet-makers, upholsterers, carvers, gilders, chair makers, polishers, and packers. The names of his specialist carvers or marqueteurs, who must surely have been some of the most accomplished in London, are not known. Chippendale's remarks in <span class="italic">The Director</span> indicate that he was fully conversant with all aspects of the trade but, as a proprietor, his responsibility was for design, quality control, subcontracting, dealing with customers, and, with the assistance of foremen, general workshop management. It would be absurd to think that he might have been employed on the workbench himself at this time. Nevertheless, despite daily pressures as an entrepreneur, there is plenty of evidence that Chippendale was constantly required to supply his clients with bespoke designs or solutions to problems, often at very short notice. Between 1760 and 1766 he was a member of the Society of Arts.<br>
<br>James Rannie died in January 1766. Press notices announced the dissolution of the partnership and that &#145;Trade will for the future be carried out by Mr Chippendale on his own account&#146;. Rannie's executors insisted on withdrawing his capital and on holding an auction sale on the premises of &#145;The entire genuine Stock in Trade of Mr Chippendale and his late Partner&#146; including &#145;a great Variety of fine Mahogany and Tulip Wood furniture &hellip; Pattern chairs and &hellip; Curious Cabinet Work, carpets, fine feathers etc.&#146; This usefully describes the range of furniture displayed in the warerooms. Chippendale's financial difficulties are alluded to in his correspondence with his clients at this time. In December 1766 he had written to Sir Rowland Winn, with whom the firm had continuous difficulties in obtaining payment, &#145;I am in great Need at present on Account of the Death of my late partner, his effects being taken out of trade&#146;  (Gilbert, <span class="italic">Chippendale</span>, 1.167). On other occasions he claimed, &#145;I could hardly keep myself out of jail&#146;, or &#145;I have not a single Guinea to pay my men with tomorrow&#146; and feared being driven out of his mind with money worries  (ibid., 175). His problems were greatly exacerbated by the attitude of the aristocracy towards tradesmen and their habitual tardiness in paying creditors. In fairness, however, there are numerous instances of client dissatisfaction, and Chippendale himself seemed to court difficulties by the ingratiating tone of some of his correspondence.<br>
<br>Chippendale's desperate financial situation resulted in Rannie's bookkeeper, Thomas Haig, who had stayed with the firm, being taken into partnership in 1771, apparently borrowing &pound;2000 from his late master's widow. The rescue also required financial backing from another executor, Henry Ferguson. The business thus became Chippendale, Haig &amp; Co. This arrangement established a measure of financial stability and credit-worthiness, although there were frequent cash-flow problems. This may well have had an impact on the quality of the furniture supplied to these clients; examples of cost cutting and uneven work can sometimes be found.<br>
<br>Chippendale's son <a href="#cosubject_62533">Thomas [<i>see below</i>]</a>, who became a first-class cabinet-maker and designer in his own right, played an increasingly important part in the enterprise, enabling his father to retire, perhaps on the grounds of ill health, about midsummer 1776 when Thomas senior took a modest house in Lob's Fields (now Derry Street), Kensington. Chippendale's first wife having died in 1772, on 5 August 1777 he married Elizabeth Davis at Fulham parish church. She was illiterate, marking her cross on documents. A daughter, Elizabeth, was born four months later, followed by John in 1779 and Charles, after his father's death, in 1780. Thus Thomas Chippendale had twelve children altogether, only four of whom were alive in 1784. During his last illness in 1779 Chippendale moved to Hoxton, where he died of consumption, and was buried on 13 November at St Martin-in-the-Fields. His son paid 4 guineas for his Hoxton lodgings, 5 guineas to the physicians who attended him, and &pound;24 for funeral expenses. No obituary appeared. He had lived quite simply, for the probate inventory valued his house contents at only &pound;28.<h2>
<a name="TheDirector"></a>The Director</h2>Prior to the publication of <span class="italic">The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker's Director</span> in 1754 no cabinet-maker, regarded by society as mere tradesmen, had shown the audacity to issue a collection of designs comparable in scale to the lavish volumes produced by professional architects. The large folio contained 161 plates illustrating &#145;Elegant and Useful Designs of Household Furniture in the Gothic, Chinese and Modern Taste&#146;. It was prefaced by an explanation of the &#145;five orders&#146;, the rules of perspective, and extensive notes. The &#145;modern taste&#146; is today termed rococo, a spirited curvilinear style incorporating naturalistic ornament. It is not known where Chippendale received his artistic education and how he learned the principles of rococo composition; maybe he was taught by Matthias Darly who was an engraver and a professional drawing-master. Chippendale's eloquent drawings for <span class="italic">The Director</span> eventually came into the possession of Lord Foley and most were purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, in 1920. Some had been pirated beforehand and a group of six is owned by the Chippendale Society; others are at the Victoria and Albert Museum among the designs of Matthias Lock, a carver by trade. It was at one time believed that Lock and his associate Henry Copland &#145;ghosted&#146; the <span class="italic">Director</span> designs, but there is now ample evidence that Chippendale was himself a fluent and accomplished draughtsman.<br>
<br>A series of notices, from March 1753 onwards, appeared in London and provincial newspapers, inviting the public to order subscription copies of <span class="italic">The Director</span> for &pound;1 14<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>. bound, representing a saving of 8<i>s</i>. on the full price. Analysis of the 308 names in the subscription list shows that it includes forty-nine members of the nobility and gentry but that the others were nearly all practising tradesmen, plus a scattering of professional men, academics, and booksellers. A second edition with trifling corrections appeared in 1755 and a third revised and enlarged edition containing 200 plates was published in parts between 1759 and 1762. A French edition appeared at this time. Catherine the Great and Louis XV both acquired copies. The first edition had been dedicated to Hugh, earl of Northumberland, who repaid the compliment by patronizing the firm. Most copies of the second edition are dedicated to Prince William Henry, duke of Gloucester, who also ordered furniture between 1764 and 1766.<br>
<br>Publication of <span class="italic">The Director</span> clearly had a stimulating effect on Chippendale's career because all known commissions (with the exception of Lord Burlington's) date from after its appearance. It was also highly influential in disseminating his designs throughout Britain, Europe, and the colonies. In fact until his first documented furniture was identified by Percy Macquoid in 1906 Chippendale's illustrious reputation was based entirely on his celebrated pattern book. He also contributed a dozen or so unsigned designs to a modest anthology, <span class="italic">Genteel Household Furniture</span>, first published by the enterprising printseller Robert Sayer in 1760.<br>
<br>Elegantly finished bespoke drawings intended for his clients which Chippendale produced free of charge (in contrast to architects) survive at Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Nostell Priory, Harewood House, and Burton Constable, Yorkshire. His approach can be seen in a letter to Sir Rowland Winn of Nostell: following a preliminary visit to Harewood in July 1767 he wrote &#145;as soon as I had got to Mr Laselles and look'd over the whole of the house I found I should want Many designs &amp; knowing that I had time Enough I went to York to do them&#146;  (Gilbert, <span class="italic">Chippendale</span>, 1.196). Until quite recently it was thought that at houses where Robert Adam and Chippendale both worked the former regularly supplied Chippendale with drawings to execute. Such arrangements certainly existed between Adam and other leading cabinet-makers but Chippendale is known to have made furniture according to Adam's design on only one occasion when, in 1765, he provided an opulent suite of armchairs and sofas in a transitional neo-classical style for the house of Sir Lawrence Dundas in Arlington Street, London. Adam in fact displayed great confidence in Chippendale's ability to design and make appropriate furnishings for even his finest interiors and apparently recommended him to clients, although as a matter of courtesy he would expect to be consulted about proposals. In 1774 Chippendale wrote to Sir Rowland Winn: &#145;I have sent &hellip; a small case containing a section of the Saloon with designs of the furniture which has been settled by Mr Adams and myself &amp; he totally approves everything therein sketched&#146;  (Gilbert, &#145;Nostell Priory&#146;, 59&#150;60). The number of houses at which Chippendale collaborated with the most influential architects of the day is impressive: James Paine, the Adam brothers, John Carr of York, Sir William Chambers, and James Wyatt (the latter two not without difficulty).<h2>
<a name="Theentrepreneur"></a>The entrepreneur</h2>Information about Chippendale's business can be gleaned from the firm's surviving bills and from two important collections of letters associated with his Nostell Priory and Mersham-le-Hatch commissions. Modern research has identified over seventy clients, their patronage being documented in invoices, payments in account books, and entries in bank ledgers. In many instances the relevant furniture was dispersed long ago. However, substantially more accredited pieces from Chippendale's workshop have been traced&#151;about 600 items&#151;than from any of his London rivals. He therefore fulfils the essential requirement of any major artistic figure, having left a large body of high-quality work (including designs) that displays a steady development from an early, through a middle, to a late style.<br>
<br>Chippendale's versatility is demonstrated by the fact that, in addition to furniture, he was willing to design and supply wallpapers (including, for the gallery at Harewood, for example, a paper &#145;of the Antique Ornament with Palms &amp;c on a fine paper with a pink ground&#146;), carpets, fire grates, decorative ormolu, chimney-pieces, and complete room schemes; on one occasion he devised needlework chair covers for Lady Knatchbull to embroider  (Gilbert, <span class="italic">Chippendale</span>, 1.210). He is known to have visited Paris in 1768 to keep abreast of fashionable taste and the following year was apprehended attempting illegally to import sixty French chair frames. As well as equipping state apartments with luxurious ensembles the firm regularly supplied routine articles for the servants' rooms and domestic offices. Chippendale offered a complete house furnishing service, undertook repairs, removals, hired out furniture, compiled inventories, and was even prepared to direct and furnish funerals for respected customers such as Bridget, Lady Heathcote.<br>
<br>Obviously Chippendale bought in certain items on behalf of his clients and the extent of his subcontracting to outworkers or specialists is not fully known. Clients might well present their own materials with which Chippendale had to work. William Weddell of Newby Hall, for example, provided him with Gobelins tapestry to make into seat covers. Likewise Edwin Lascelles at Harewood supplied him with green silk damask for the furnishings of the state bed- and dressing-rooms and the oriental lacquer to make the accompanying secretaire, commode, and cabinets. The way in which Chippendale was able to use off-cuts of this consignment of lacquer in order to make a twin secretaire for another client, Robert Child of Osterley Park, Middlesex, is still not fully explained.<br>
<br>Perhaps the most expensive activity in which Chippendale acted as an upholder or house furnisher was as a supplier of mirror glass. This was exclusively French, imported into England at great cost and cut in special workshops for his clients' bespoke frames and girandoles. By far the most extravagant items in any Chippendale bill are those which refer to mirror glass for piers and overmantels: this was the age in which mirrors were infinitely more prestigious than paintings with which to cover the walls of a state apartment. All these varied commercial activities add enormously to the interest of the firm's work.<br>
<br>It needs to be stressed that the term &#145;Chippendale&#146; is now widely used as a convenient generic label to describe any high-quality furniture inspired by his <span class="italic">Director</span> designs. However, even if the piece corresponds exactly to one of his published patterns this does not amount to proof of authorship, because many practising cabinet-makers acquired copies of <span class="italic">The Director</span> in order to copy the engravings. The partners never employed a maker's mark, so the only unambiguous way of establishing Chippendale's authorship is to find his original bill, usually preserved among estate papers, or equivalent documentation.<br>
<br>Although most of his identified clients appear to have run up substantial accounts with him, there is ample evidence that Chippendale was perfectly happy to supply relatively inexpensive &#145;off the peg&#146; items to non-account customers. Thus Lady Irwin of Temple Newsam, although one of the wealthiest women in the country, bought a chic but plain &#145;Hexagon Table of very fine yellow sattin wood on a neat pillar &amp; Claw&#146; costing &pound;4 14<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. in 1774  (Gilbert, <span class="italic">Chippendale</span>, 1.268). It was probably a whimsy since she does not appear to have shopped with the firm again until the 1790s. The table itself was probably a variation on a stock model also supplied to the earl of Dumfries, Sir Lawrence Dundas, and Edwin Lascelles.<br>
<br>Chippendale could supply his clients with furniture in categories ranging from &#145;neat but substantially good&#146;, through &#145;genteel&#146;, to &#145;de luxe&#146;, the difference being not only one of price, but also of decorum or appropriateness&#151;depending on the sort of interior the furniture was intended for&#151;and on the individual taste of his customer. Men and women of the professional classes and upwards were by now expected to take an interest in all aspects of decoration. The diaries and journals of Lady Shelburne and the duchess of Northumberland testify to the increased power and discrimination of women in deciding which firms of upholders to patronize. Eva Garrick, wife of the celebrated actor David Garrick, was probably not the only female client of Chippendale to give him a piece of her mind when things went wrong.<br>
<br>It would be misleading to claim that Chippendale towered head and shoulders above other fashionable London cabinet-makers such as Vile and Cobb, Ince and Mayhew, Hallett, the Linnells, or France and Bradburn. He certainly never enjoyed a monopoly of the most skilful craftsmen in the capital, and their finest furniture was technically equal to Chippendale's. His special claim for artistic fame is as a brilliantly original, innovative, and influential designer who also made masterpieces of furniture. His designs were plagiarized from at least the early Victorian period by the publisher John Weale, and more or less free adaptations from <span class="italic">The Director</span> have been a staple product of commercial furniture makers since the mid-nineteenth century.<h2>
<a name="Clientele"></a>Clientele</h2>James Rannie's connections may explain the partners' early success in attracting Scottish patrons such as Lord Arniston (1757), the duke of Atholl (1758), the earl of Morton (<i>c</i>.1759), and, outstandingly, the earl of Dumfries (1759). Virtually all the furniture made by Chippendale for Dumfries House, Ayrshire, survives. It is of exceptional quality and forms easily the finest fully documented repertory of his <span class="italic">Director</span> period work. Interestingly Alexander Peter, a leading Edinburgh wright, simultaneously supplied Lord Dumfries with a sideboard table and set of bed cornices which exactly translate <span class="italic">Director</span> designs. Likewise the duke of Atholl, having received his pair of candlestands from Chippendale, promptly had another four copied by a local man, John Thomson. The practice echoes the way British visitors to Paris might acquire a single item of French silver by one of the great <i>orf&egrave;vres</i> and have a complete set copied back home.<br>
<br>A smaller anthology of rococo pieces at Wilton House, Wiltshire, features the magnificent &#145;violin&#146; bookcase, regarded as one of Chippendale's greatest masterpieces. Aske Hall, Yorkshire, also contains an important group of <span class="italic">Director</span>-style mahogany furniture, much of it made for the London house of that most discriminating of Chippendale's clients Sir Lawrence Dundas. Yet more transitional furniture was supplied to Sir Robert Burdett of Foremark Hall, Derbyshire, and to Sir Rowland Winn of Nostell Priory, Yorkshire.<br>
<br>The furniture made for Nostell Priory and for Sir Rowland Winn's London house is impressively documented by letters, bills, estimates, memoranda, receipts, and drawings which serve to illustrate how the firm programmed a major commission. Whether there was a special connection between Chippendale and his client on account of their being fellow Yorkshiremen is not proven. The tenor of their correspondence is, on the one hand, that of an impatient and frustrated client, railing against Chippendale's dilatoriness, often threatening to withdraw his custom with dire consequences to his reputation. Chippendale, on the other hand, seemed almost permanently desperate for payment and yet always remained obsequious. By this date he is always referred to as Mr Chippendale&#151;an important social nicety, implying that he was a distinctly superior tradesman if not quite a gentleman.<br>
<br>Perhaps the most celebrated piece at Nostell is the carved mahogany library table, delivered in 1766 at a cost of &pound;72 10<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>. and described by Chippendale as &#145;the best work that can be done&#146;  (Gilbert, <span class="italic">Chippendale</span>, 1.175). It should be contrasted with the superb marquetry library table made for Harewood six years later to see the complete change in taste. Likewise the accompanying lyre-back library chair, with its somewhat over-elaborate&#151;maybe insecure&#151;neo-classical ornament, should be contrasted with a similar model made for Brocket Hall, Hertfordshire, about five years later and displaying a far more restrained and assured sense of design. Among many distinguished ensembles still <i>in situ</i> at Nostell is the exotic suite of green and gold japanned furniture in the Chinese taste made for the state bed- and dressing-rooms which Chippendale's men hung with hand-painted Chinese (or &#145;India&#146;) paper. Similarly they can be contrasted with pieces delivered for the lodging rooms at Harewood.<br>
<br>Chinoiserie remained immensely popular, especially for bedrooms, despite the rise of neo-classicism: frequently, as at Nostell, the two styles were combined in quaint juxtaposition. Likewise japanning (painted decoration, not necessarily imitating lacquer) became the last word in chic: David and Eva Garrick, two of the most fashion-conscious people in London, chose it for their villa at Hampton. Simple bedroom furniture, japanned in green and cream with husk flowers, and festive bed cornices, such as examples at Paxton House, Berwickshire, was not necessarily cheap. Lady Shelburne was horrified at Ince and Mayhew's prices for &#145;two pretty cases &hellip; although they are only deal and to be painted white he charges &pound;50 for&#146;  (Gilbert, <span class="italic">Chippendale</span>, 1.239).<br>
<br>Chippendale's work for Sir Edward Knatchbull at Mersham-le-Hatch, Kent, another Adam house, is amply documented in letters and bills, although comparatively little furniture has been identified. The firm often equipped both London and country houses for clients. For example, Lord Melbourne employed them on his palatial residence in Piccadilly, London, and at Brocket Hall, Hertfordshire (perhaps under pressure from his wife, another Yorkshirewoman). Superb looking-glasses, window cornices, bookcases, and library and dining chairs survive, together with an outstanding pair of marquetry cabinets and a majestic inlaid dressing commode, now at Renishaw Hall, Derbyshire. This latter item, closely related to the Diana and Minerva commode at Harewood, is reputed to have cost a staggering &pound;140, making it by far the most expensive piece of cabinet furniture produced by Chippendale.<br>
<br>Other important houses are Newby Hall, Yorkshire, where the sumptuous tapestry room contains the only seat furniture by Chippendale to retain all its original upholstery and the only extant window curtains supplied by the firm. His client there, William Weddell, was, together with his other patrons Sir Lawrence Dundas and William Constable, a true connoisseur and man of the Enlightenment. Constable commissioned the firm to furnish the saloon at Burton Constable in 1778 at a cost of over &pound;1000 and it remains one of the most perfectly preserved of Chippendale's grand neo-classical interiors. By contrast the depleted but still extensive collection at Paxton House, Berwickshire, exemplifies Chippendale's ability to cater for the needs of a client, Ninian Home, who preferred japanned or relatively plain mahogany furniture.<br>
<br>Chippendale's most valuable commission, for Edwin Lascelles at Harewood House, remains the pre-eminent Chippendale country house despite many depletions. At no other place can the full range of the firm's activities be studied or enjoyed in such depth. The programme, begun in 1767, was continued by Chippendale's son until 1797. Its total cost was in the region of &pound;10,000, making it arguably one of the most expensive furnishing schemes anywhere in the eighteenth century. In order to see this figure in context it should be remembered that Lascelles spent nearly &pound;7000 with Capability Brown on landscaping the park, while Sir James Ibbetson, at Denton Park nearby, built and equipped an entire Palladian mansion and park (including furniture by Chippendale) for &pound;10,000 at approximately the same time. Documents at Harewood include invoices, the steward's day work books, letters, and an inventory of 1795, making identification of individual pieces relatively easy as well as providing an extraordinarily interesting case study of a great furnishing commission. The state bed, costing &pound;250 in 1773 (excluding its draperies and trimmings) was removed in the 1840s and assumed lost until its triumphant restoration in 2000.<h2>
<a name="TheShakespeareofEnglishfurnituremakers"></a>The Shakespeare of English furniture makers</h2>There is little doubt that Chippendale was considered one of the most eminent cabinet-makers and designers of his own day, not only by the aristocracy and gentry who were his clients, but also by his peers. After his death the brilliant self-promotion of <span class="italic">The Director</span> would seem to have made him immortal: during the nineteenth and for much of the twentieth centuries his name became associated with almost all furniture bearing even the slightest resemblance to examples in his great publication. Thus with the development of a popular market for antique furniture he became synonymous with a whole period in the history of design, not only in Britain but America. This hero-worship culminated in his nomination as the Shakespeare of English furniture makers. Today a more measured view might be to see him as a highly gifted designer and entrepreneur well attuned to changes in taste and the needs of the luxury market.<br>
<br>Chippendale is well remembered in his birthplace by the Chippendale Society, founded in 1963, who celebrate an annual dinner and own an important collection of furniture and documents, usually on display at Temple Newsam, Leeds. There are no known likenesses of Chippendale: nevertheless in 1986 a bronze statue by Graham Ibbeson was erected in Otley. An idealized statue of him by Albert Hodge (1905) adorns the west fa&ccedil;ade of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.<br>
<br>The younger <a name="cosubject_62533"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Chippendale</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1749, <em>d.</em> 1822/3), <span class="occ">cabinet-maker and designer</span>, was baptized in London at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 23 April 1749, the eldest of his parents' nine children. Details of his upbringing and education are obscure but he probably received a formal training in drawing. After his father's semi-retirement and second marriage in 1777 he assumed a central role in running the firm. His earliest known design is a decorative cartouche on a survey of the High Street, Hull, executed in 1772. In 1779 his only publication appeared, <span class="italic">SKETCHES OF ORNAMENT By Thos Chippendale JUNR</span>. It consists of six plates illustrating an anthology of refined neo-classical motifs, several of which appear on ambitious looking-glass frames at Harewood House and Burton Constable, Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Chippendale junior was also an artist and occasional dealer in pictures. He exhibited five genre paintings at the Royal Academy between 1784 and 1801. In 1794 he bought at Christies a large collection of prints by G. B. Cipriani and F. Bartolozzi, together with various drawings, and in 1799 sold fourteen old master and contemporary paintings. In the early nineteenth century he filled a small book with drawings of French furniture entitled &#145;Sketches by Thomas Chippendale at Various Times&#146;, perhaps derived from a visit during the peace of Amiens. Like his father, he was a member of the Society of Arts, between 1793 and 1811.<br>
<br>On 16 July 1793 Chippendale junior married Mary Anne Whitehead at St Martin-in-the-Fields; no record of any offspring or of his wife's death has been traced. They were probably childless for in his will dated 2 December 1822 and proved 28 January 1823 (where he is described as &#145;late of St Martin's Lane but of 61 Regent Street, Vincent Square, Westminster&#146;) he left all his personal property to a Sarah Wheatley &#145;of Regent Street aforesaid&#146;. It has not been established whether they were related and his place of burial remains unknown.<br>
<br>Following the death of his father in 1779 Chippendale carried on the business with Thomas Haig, the accountant who now became senior partner. The firm traded as Haig and Chippendale, with Chippendale responsible for all matters relating to design and craftsmanship. Haig retired in 1796 and on his death in 1803 bequeathed &pound;10,000 to friends and relations to be paid out of &#145;Monies secured to me on several Bonds of Thomas Chippendale my Successor in Business&#146;  (Gilbert, <span class="italic">Chippendale</span>, 1.15). Unable to pay these large sums, Chippendale was declared bankrupt in June 1804. The subsequent four auctions revealed the extensive nature of his business and stock but the misfortune did not affect his reputation as a furniture maker or designer and he continued trading at 60&#150;62 St Martin's Lane until 1813. Thereafter he moved to 17 Haymarket; between 1818 and 1821 he was at 42 Jermyn Street; possibly then at Great Queen Street before his final address in Regent Street, Vincent Square (now renamed Regency Street).<br>
<br>When Chippendale's father died there were important furnishing programmes remaining to be completed, including Nostell Priory, Harewood House, and Burton Constable, Yorkshire; Paxton House, Berwickshire; and various properties of the Heathcote family. It seems very likely that Chippendale the younger had been closely involved in these since the early 1770s and the designs of such masterpieces as the Diana and Minerva commode, or the state bed at Harewood may be as much his as his father's. His work at these houses shows the consistent development of an elegant and attenuated style and the ability to remain in the forefront of changes in taste. At Paxton he advised Ninian Hume on all matters concerning furnishing and decoration: colour schemes, wallpapers, carpets, even gate-pier ornaments. The largest accredited body of his work is at Stourhead, Wiltshire, ordered by Sir Richard Colt Hoare between 1798 and 1820, costing about &pound;3500 and including the library furniture in the Egyptian style and suites in an advanced Grecian taste. Charles Hoare of Luscombe Castle, Devon, also ordered Regency furniture costing &pound;1434, much of which survives. One of his last commissions (1820) was an elaborate commemorative armchair for the prince regent made from the wood of a famous elm tree left standing on the battlefield of Waterloo (Royal Collection).<br>
<br>Although the reputation of Chippendale the younger has been overshadowed by that of his famous father, he was perhaps commercially more successful and equally distinguished (although less influential) as a progressive designer. At least one contemporary, the cabinet-maker George Smith, recognized his qualities and wrote of him posthumously as &#145;known only amongst a few, [he] possessed a very great degree of taste, with great ability as a draughtsman and designer&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Cabinet Maker's and Upholsterer's Guide</span>, 1826, p. 194). An early nineteenth-century unsigned wax portrait inscribed on the back &#145;Thomas Chippendale&#146; survives in the Victoria and Albert Museum, and a copy of a lost portrait (doubtfully identified) is in the collection of the Chippendale Society.<br>
