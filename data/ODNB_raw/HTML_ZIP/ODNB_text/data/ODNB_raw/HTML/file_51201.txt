<span class="headword">Bannerman <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Watson]</span>,  Helen Brodie Cowan</span>  (1862&#150;1946), <span class="occ">children's writer</span>, was born on 25 February 1862 at 35 Royal Terrace, Edinburgh. She was the eldest daughter and fourth child of seven children of Robert Boog Watson (1823&#150;1910), minister of the Free Church of Scotland, and his wife Janet (1831&#150;1912), daughter of Alexander Cowan of Moray House, Edinburgh, and Helen Brodie. Both Helen Watson's parents were Scottish, as was her husband William Burney Bannerman (1858&#150;1924), a physician, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1313/', "James Bannerman (1807&#150;1868)")</script> and (David) Anne Douglas (1819&#150;1879). She lived in Madeira, where her father was minister at the Scottish church, from the age of two to the age of twelve. When the family returned to Edinburgh she was educated at Miss Oliphant's school. At a time when women were not admitted to Scottish universities she sat external examinations and was made an LLA (lady literate in arts) by St Andrews University in 1887.<br>
<br>After her marriage on 26 June 1889, Helen Bannerman went with her husband to India and lived there as the wife of an officer in the Indian Medical Service (IMS) until he retired as a major-general in 1918. They had four children in India: Janet Cowan Watson (1893&#150;1976), Davie Anne Douglas 
    (Day; 1896&#150;1976)
  , James Patrick 
    (Pat; 1900&#150;1955)
  , and Robert Boog Watson (1902&#150;1988).<br>
<br>The book for which Helen Bannerman is best known, <span class="italic">The Story of Little Black Sambo</span>, was written for her two daughters, to amuse them during a journey from the hill station of Kodaikanal to Madras. This involved being carried on a chair down the steep hillside, then travelling in a bullock cart, and finally going by train, with stops at rest houses and for meals along the way. It took two days and two nights&#151;time to refine the story of the adventures of a little black boy who outwits several tigers until it became a classic of economy and drama. She illustrated the book herself in watercolour and bound it into a small volume, with a picture facing every page. A friend took it to London and sold it to a publisher&#151;despite Helen's admonitions not to sell the copyright&#151;for &pound;5.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Little Black Sambo</span> was published by Grant Richards in London in 1899 and became a runaway best-seller. It was published in the USA in 1900. American publishers rushed out copies of the book with, in later years, illustrations by a variety of artists, many of whom set their pictures in the deep south of the USA, associating the book with the American experience of slavery, and sowing the seeds for hatred of the book by black Americans in the years ahead.<br>
<br>Having effectively lost the copyright&#151;though she had never agreed to its sale&#151;Helen Bannerman made nothing more than the original &pound;5 from her best-seller. She did, however, publish subsequent books, though none was such a success as her first. They were <span class="italic">The Story of Little Black Mingo</span> (1902), <span class="italic">The Story of Little Black Quibba</span> (1903), <span class="italic">The Story of Little Degchiehead</span> (1904), <span class="italic">Pat and the Spider</span> (1905), <span class="italic">The Story of the Teasing Monkey</span> (1906), <span class="italic">The Story of Little Black Quasha</span> (1908), <span class="italic">The Story of Little Black Bobtail</span> (1909), and <span class="italic">The Story of Sambo and the Twins</span> (1937). After her death her daughter Day gathered together some unfinished text and pictures, and completed them, and published <span class="italic">The Story of Little White Squibba</span> in 1966 under her mother's name.<br>
<br>Helen Bannerman was a small, neat figure, with her fair hair in a bun, and blue eyes. She had a quick intelligence and enjoyed puns and verbal wit. She was no housekeeper but very much the intellectual. She was deeply Christian in her attitudes. She knew, at the end of her life, of the criticisms of her book <span class="italic">Little Black Sambo</span> as racist and found them hard to understand; the child is the hero of the story and in her pictures he and his parents are lovingly drawn. In her picture of the closing scene (used in subsequent British reprints), where Sambo and his parents celebrate his escape from the tigers by eating pancakes, she shows the family sitting at a table with a clean white cloth, using plates and forks. In the American Stoll and Edwards edition a debased Sambo, sitting by himself, shovels the food into his mouth off the bare wooden table. As her son Robert put it in a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> on 1 May 1972 when the book was under attack: &#145;My mother would not have published the book had she dreamt for a moment that even one small boy would have been made unhappy thereby&#146;.<br>
<br>Helen and William Bannerman retired to Edinburgh in 1918; he died there in 1924. She suffered a stroke in 1939, after which she was bedridden. She lived with her daughter Day in her home at 11 Strathearn Place, Edinburgh, and died there of a fractured femur and cerebral thrombosis on 13 October 1946; she was cremated.<br>
