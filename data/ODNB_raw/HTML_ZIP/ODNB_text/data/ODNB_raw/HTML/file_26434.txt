<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stevenson,  Joseph</span>  (1806&#150;1895), <span class="occ">historian, archivist, and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 27 November 1806 at Berwick upon Tweed, the eldest son of Robert Stevenson, surgeon, and his wife, Elizabeth Wilson. He had two sisters. After his first schooling at Witton-le-Wear he entered the grammar school attached to Durham Cathedral. The life of a scholar was not inevitable: he had occasionally accompanied an uncle on smuggling expeditions across the border. At Durham he was usually near the bottom of his class and at one time kept a loaded pistol among his effects which went off in the hands of a servant with dramatic although not grave consequences. At all events, Stevenson proceeded to Glasgow University although apparently without taking a degree. His studies were mainly in Latin and Greek, but on his own admission he made little progress. In 1829 he returned to Berwick to pursue a vocation with the Church of Scotland. He also began his literary and antiquarian pursuits in earnest and from 1831 &#145;his pen was never idle&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). His first work was in connection with a new edition of Chaucer; it did not proceed far but in 1832 he published a glossary of Old English. Thanks to another uncle he made a first visit to London about 1821, returning there permanently about 1831 on a coal smack. By midsummer he obtained a good post in the British Museum, which had just acquired the Arundel collection and needed competent assistants to sort and classify. His work having been accepted, he returned to Glasgow to claim a bride, Mary Ann, daughter of John Craig of Mount Florida, whom he married on 19 September 1831. A son, Robert, was born in August 1832; two daughters came later. From this time Stevenson established contact with many notable British historians including Patrick Fraser Tytler, and joined various learned societies. In 1834 he was appointed a subcommissioner of the public records and began work on a proposed new edition of Thomas Rymer's <span class="italic">Foedera</span>. He might have risen notably higher and quickly in his chosen profession had not another vocation drawn him even more strongly. While in London, although with no dramatic suddenness, he transferred his allegiance from the kirk to the Church of England, in which Robert and the two daughters were baptized.<br>
<br>The death of Robert on 5 November 1839 proved traumatic. Stevenson resigned from the record commission and returned to Durham to enter the university and study theology. After receiving the licentiate in 1841, he was ordained for the Anglican ministry, and was also appointed librarian and keeper of records to the dean and chapter. He spent the next seven years cataloguing the charters and deeds in the treasury. In consequence, the university gave him an honorary MA and the church an appointment in 1847 to St Giles, Durham, as a curate. During this period he developed his early interests in St Cuthbert and other early saints. But he was subjected to more influences than one, including George Townsend, a redoubtable protestant, his vicar, who went to Rome to convert the pope, although with no notable success. Meanwhile, Stevenson needed to increase his income to maintain a growing family. He was urged to go no further than Durham, but &#145;dearly as he loved Durham, he was repelled by the rich pluralists who then occupied the posts of dignity in the cathedral&#146;  (Pollen, 339). His idealism was satisfied by the parish of Leighton Buzzard, to which he was inducted in January 1849. By contrast with his comfortable Durham living, here he had to manage on &pound;120 per annum, and to live in a vicarage so decayed as to be uninhabitable. He stayed until 1862, somehow finding the money to fund a curate, rebuild the vicarage, and restore the church after it was struck by lightning.<br>
<br>Stevenson retained throughout his life a reputation as a warm and welcoming individual with none of the dryness or coldness of some scholars. This was sufficiently proved when after the lightning disaster more than one dissenting minister offered him the use of his chapel until the church was repaired. Their kind offers were accepted with alacrity. He took a great interest in his parish, opening a night school, in which he himself taught. All his life he had a special affection for children. He also helped the poor, in spite of his meagre resources. These were augmented by Stevenson's continuing contact with the world of scholarship. Even after his resignation as subcommissioner for the records, he went on to edit some twenty volumes for the Bannatyne, Roxburghe, Maitland, Surtees, and other learned societies. Earlier plans for publishing or calendaring the national records did not come to much, but in 1856 his representations to government induced them to begin the celebrated <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span>. Appointed one of the editors, he visited Paris, Rheims, Chartres, Rouen, and Lille to further his researches.<br>
<br>In 1862 Stevenson resigned his living, but this was not simply to devote himself more completely to scholarship. His progress over many years through the minefield of Reformation history led him to conclude that the Roman Catholic church was where he belonged. On 24 June 1863 he was received at Farm Street Church, London, by Father Peter Gallwey SJ. His wife was received in 1865 by the Dominican Fathers at Haverstock Hill. So dim was the view taken of this step by his peers in the Public Record Office that even Sir Thomas Duffus Hardy, a friend of many years, was alienated for a time, and Stevenson felt obliged to resign as a calendarer although he continued as an editor of the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span>. He continued also to be frequently employed by the Historical Manuscripts Commission. He moved to Selly Park, Birmingham, where he took up residence with the priest, while his wife boarded with the Sisters of Charity. When she died on 11 July 1869, Stevenson moved to neighbouring Oscott to study for the priesthood, which he entered in 1872.<br>
<br>In this year, W. E. Gladstone awarded Stevenson a pension for services rendered to scholarship while he received a commission from the government to search in the Vatican archives for material of interest to English-speaking historians; the task occupied him some four years, and involved scenes reminiscent of Italian opera set in Piedmont as well as Rome before it could be taken up.<br>
<br>Stevenson returned in 1877, with a further desire to join a religious order. His first idea was to join the Franciscans but, not unreasonably, they baulked at admitting a man over seventy to the severe life of a novice. He then approached the Jesuits but had to endure a double rebuff before&#151;thanks to the influence of a fellow scholar, John Morris SJ&#151;he was admitted to the noviciate at Manresa House, Roehampton, on 14 September 1877. Although he was obliged at first to follow the physically demanding routine of his young companions, the novice-master, George Porter, an understanding man, soon put Stevenson on to tasks better suited to his age and experience. When asked why so old a man was allowed to join the society at all, Porter &#145;chuckled in his characteristic way and answered, &#147;Why? Because we hope to get fifteen years' work out of him!&#148; In fact the Society got seventeen&#146;  (Pollen, 506).<br>
<br>After a brief stay at Oxford in 1878, Stevenson spent the rest of his life mainly at 31 Farm Street, Mayfair, the &#145;House of Writers&#146;. On 25 March 1882, by dispensation, he was professed of three vows. Nor were his Scottish connections severed. &#145;His lithe, spare, alert, and slightly stooping figure, his thin and sharp but genial face, and his keen, bright eye, were as well known in the Edinburgh Register House as in Fetter Lane&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Notices</span>, 23, 1895, 120). On 22 November 1893 he was granted the honorary degree of doctor of laws by the University of St Andrews. Active almost to the last, in 1892 he joined, if he did not lead, a demanding pilgrimage to Lindisfarne for 7 September, the day of St Cuthbert's translation. He underwent a very severe illness in the summer of 1893, but in 1894 prepared for publication French ambassadorial dispatches of Queen Elizabeth's time, held in the Bodleian Library. Stevenson was still engaged on this when he died at Farm Street on 8 February 1895 after complications following a paralytic stroke. The date was most significant for one with his interest in the life and cause of Mary Stuart. He was buried in the cemetery of St Thomas's Church, Fulham. His main contribution to British scholarship lay in the transcription of documents dealing with medieval and early modern English and Scottish history, but he also published some forty articles in <span class="italic">The Month</span> and a number of popular lectures delivered north and south of the border.<br>
