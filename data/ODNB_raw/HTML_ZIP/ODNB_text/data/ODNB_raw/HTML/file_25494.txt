<span class="headword">Sibbald,  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1595&#150;1647), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, said to have been of an ancient family in the Mearns, matriculated at Marischal College, Aberdeen, in 1614 and graduated MA in 1618. Two years later he was the first person appointed to act as regent of fourth-year classes in natural philosophy, continuing in that position until 1626. Appointed in 1625 to the first charge of St Nicholas's Church in New Aberdeen, in 1627, following presentation of a thesis later published, he was made a BD by King's College, Aberdeen, and in 1628 a DD, though the non-academic use of that degree was disputed in Scotland at the time. He was noted for his abilities in oriental languages, and in both divine and secular studies.<br>
<br>Sibbald was one of the Aberdonian divines who preached at the funeral of Patrick Forbes of Corse in 1635. His sermon, published as <span class="italic">Holinesse to the Lord</span> and based on <span class="roman">Exodus</span> chapter 28, expressed anti-Catholicism and Calvinist ideas of predestination, both recurrent themes in his writing. In 1637 Sibbald, along with John Forbes of Corse, Alexander Scrogie, William Leslie, Robert Baron, and Alexander Ross, encouraged the unification schemes of John Durie by giving him their opinion that Lutherans agreed with the doctrine of the Church of Scotland in those points which were agreed by the ancient church. In 1638, when the national covenant was being promoted in Aberdeen, those six ministers, together with William Guild, for a time, prepared questions for the covenanting representatives and went on to engage them in a lengthy printed debate on the authority and doctrine of the covenant. In early October of that year, Sibbald signed the king's covenant which was being circulated in opposition to the national covenant. He was elected, along with Robert Baron, to the general assembly of 1638, but neither attended.<br>
<br>In 1639 Sibbald left Aberdeen for England, where he and Baron offered their services to Charles I, but, having met a cooler reception than expected, Sibbald returned to Aberdeen, which had been occupied by covenanters in his absence. In Aberdeen he accepted the political and ecclesiastical situation to the extent of reminding his parishioners not to keep Christmas day, as celebration of it had been banned by the general assembly. Despite some outward appearance of conformity he continued to refuse to subscribe the national covenant, and was at the Aberdeen general assembly of 1640, charged on this count, together with Arminianism and circulating William Forbes's unpublished writings. It was also claimed that he maintained the blessing of private baptism, approved of Lent, called communion <i>viaticum</i> and taught that alms would discharge sin: all these were contrary to the covenanters' interpretation of Calvinist doctrine; all were admitted by Sibbald. He was deposed on 6 August of that year, and was replaced as minister at St Nicholas's by Andrew Cant, one of the region's covenanting ministers. Sibbald's books and papers were seized, but returned to him.<br>
<br>In 1640 Sibbald again sailed for England, and from there went to Ireland, where he received a benefice. He spent the remainder of his career as a protestant episcopalian minister in Dublin, where he was noted for his work with the poor and ill. In 1646 he petitioned Ormond, the lord lieutenant, to preserve episcopalian protestantism in the forms of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, public worship, and episcopacy.<br>
<br>Sibbald died in Dublin in 1647 of plague, contracted while working with the ill of that city. He left a widow, Elizabeth Nicolson, and two children, who were granted &pound;200 Scots (&pound;16 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. sterling) by the Scottish parliament of 1661, after the restoration of both the monarch and episcopacy, and because of his support for both institutions. After his death, fifteen of his sermons were published as <span class="italic">Diverse Select Sermons</span> (Aberdeen, 1658).<br>
