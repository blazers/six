<span class="headword">Grieve, Sir  Robert</span>  (1910&#150;1995), <span class="occ">town planner and public servant</span>, was born on 11 December 1910 at 61 Springbank Street, Glasgow, the son of Peter Paxton Grieve (1886&#150;1960), soldier, and his wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Boyle (1886&#150;1950). His greatest influences were his mother (&#145;a caged tigress&#146;) and an uncle who took him on &#145;enormous walks&#146; beyond Glasgow's tram termini, when he first glimpsed the hills  (private information). His father, a regimental sergeant-major in the King's Own Scottish Borderers, and later a woodcutting machinist, played little part in his life. From 1916 he was a pupil at North Kelvinside School, Glasgow, and, encouraged by his mother's determination that he should &#145;get on&#146;, he trained as a civil engineer at the Royal College of Science and Technology, Glasgow (later the University of Strathclyde), passed the final examination of the Town Planning Institute (later the Royal Town Planning Institute) in 1937, and became an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1938. From 1927 to 1944 he was employed by local authorities. On 1 December 1933 he married Mary Lavinia Broughton (May) Blackburn (1911&#150;1984), a great strength and positive influence. There were two sons and two daughters of the marriage.<br>
<br>In 1944&#150;6 Grieve played a key role in the production of the Clyde valley regional plan, developing the case for the overspill of population from Glasgow to new towns, creating viable communities within new centres for economic development. In 1946 he joined a new planning unit in the Scottish Office, first in charge of the north region and later the west region. In 1960 he was appointed chief planning officer. In 1964 the University of Glasgow appointed him foundation professor of town and regional planning to establish a postgraduate planning course. He had worked closely with Professor Donald Robertson, and bringing together these outstanding planners, one economic, the other physical, was bound to be fruitful both academically and in practical affairs. Grieve followed another great Scottish planner, Patrick Geddes in emphasizing the importance of breadth in education. He recited J. G. Saxe's poem <span class="italic">The Blind Men and the Elephant</span>, relating how six blind men each explain an elephant by touching it, but differ according to which part of it they touched. The poem ends:<blockquote>
<div>So oft in ideologic wars<br>
</div>
<div>The disputants I ween<br>
</div>
<div>Rail on in utter ignorance<br>
</div>
<div>Of what each other mean<br>
</div>
<div>
<i>And prate about an elephant</i>
<br>
</div>
<div>
<i>Not one of them has seen.</i>
<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Grieve then raised his arms and said &#145;We have created the University of the Elephant&#146;  (personal knowledge). His indebtedness to Geddes was developed in his monograph <span class="italic">Grieve on Geddes</span> (1991).<br>
<br>Grieve's appointment as full-time chairman of the newly established Highlands and Islands Development Board in November 1965 removed him from academia before he could fulfil the expectations which his appointment had aroused. As he put it, he was &#145;exchanging the unexceptionable sentiment for the terror of action&#146;  (private information)&#151;modestly overlooking the extent to which his earlier work as local government official and top civil servant had involved action. But now he had to add diplomacy to his professional skills. There had been influential opposition in parliament and in the highlands to the establishment of the new board. The board's first report declared that whatever success it might have in the eastern and central highlands it would be judged by its ability to build population in the fragile areas of the islands and the west. Grieve was not a man to seek the soft option. The policies given greatest emphasis were the fuller exploitation of natural resources, the encouragement of new industries, and the development of tourism, with the provision of grants and loans to increase the business birth rate and increase employment. Oil and gas developments in the North Sea stimulated interest in the Moray Firth, which in turn gave rise to both opposition and competition to acquire potentially valuable assets. There were errors of judgement by two board members, who had to resign, with some pressure on Grieve to resign also. He resisted, and soon had the fledgeling development agency back on an even keel. He made the establishment of a university in the highlands and islands a long-term goal, both for social and development reasons. With support from the Scottish Office and the Millennium Commission in the late 1990s his dream moved closer to becoming a reality. The Highlands and Islands Development Board was comprehensive in both its objectives and its powers, giving rise to considerable international interest. The British Council and the board established an annual seminar for students from &#145;third-world&#146; countries. Grieve planned and chaired these seminars, adding an international dimension to his already powerful influence on planning in the UK. He was knighted in 1969. The Highlands and Islands Development Board commissioned a bust by Benno Schotz on Grieve's retirement, which was placed in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.<br>
<br>Grieve returned to the University of Glasgow in 1970. Some academic colleagues criticized Highlands and Islands Development Board policies&#151;its limited powers on land use were not fully understood&#151;and the recognition of his trials and achievements was uneven. However, as he put it &#145;the encounter with lively students was to me the greatest of pleasures and rewards&#146;  (private information). He retired in 1974, remaining active as chairman of the Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland from 1978 to 1983, and of the Highlands and Islands Development Consultative Council from 1978 to 1986. He was awarded the Royal Institute of Town Planning's gold medal in 1974. In time he took on new responsibilities. He chaired the constitutional steering committee which produced <span class="italic">A Claim of Right for Scotland</span> (1988), the blueprint for the devolved parliament established in 1999. He chaired an enquiry into housing in Glasgow (1986&#150;9), and received the lord provost's award for outstanding public service. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1980), and was awarded honorary fellowships of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland and the Royal Scottish Geographical Society (1989), and honorary degrees from Heriot-Watt and Strathclyde (1984) and Edinburgh (1985). He was a keen mountaineer, and was president of the Scottish Countryside Rangers' Association, the Stewartry Mountaineering Club, the Scottish Mountaineering Club, and the Scottish Mountaineering Council. His wife, May, died in January 1984, a devastating blow from which he never fully recovered. He was a devoted father to his four children, Ann, Elizabeth, Iain, and William. He died in Edinburgh of prostate cancer on 25 October 1995. Although brought up as a Roman Catholic he was agnostic. His ashes were scattered on the Conic Hill overlooking Loch Lomond on 15 June 1996.<br>
