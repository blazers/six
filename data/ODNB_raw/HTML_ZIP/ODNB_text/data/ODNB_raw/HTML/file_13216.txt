<span class="headword">Hicks,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1621, <em>d.</em> 1660), <span class="occ">religious writer</span>, was baptized at Kerris in the parish of Paul, Cornwall, on 2 January 1621, the son of Nicholas Hicks, gentleman. He was educated partly at grammar school in Exeter, Devon, and partly at Liskeard, Cornwall, and was then sent to Oxford. He matriculated commoner from Wadham College on 9 March 1638, where he attended the courses in logic and philosophy but from where he did not graduate.<br>
<br>In early 1642 Hicks's name appeared near the head of those who subscribed to the protestation in Paul. According to the hostile Anthony Wood:<blockquote>he was by his relations put in arms against the king, and in short time became so fanatical in his opinion that he was esteemed by some to be little better than an anabaptist. So that being looked upon as a zealous brother for the cause, he was made a captain in the trained-bands, and became very forward against those of the loyal party. (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, new edn, 1813&#150;20, 3.489)</blockquote>Hicks's own writings suggest that by the late 1650s he was indeed a Baptist, citing in support of belief in the truth of Christ's promised second coming and the thousand-year rule of the saints &#145;the general consent of most of the Baptized Churches for it, as may appear in a Confession of Faith of divers Churches in Wiltshire, Glocester, Somerset, Dorset, and Devon&#146;  (Hicks, &#145;Quinto-Monarchiae&#146;, epistle dedicatory). Hicks shared the millenarian enthusiasm and widespread interest in the books of <span class="roman">Daniel</span> and <span class="roman">Revelation</span> of the 1640s and 1650s. The millennium was the theme of Hicks's book, published in 1659 and re-issued in 1661, <span class="italic">Apokalypsis apokalypseos, or, Revelation Revealed: being a Practical Exposition on the Revelation of St John</span>. The doggerel motto beneath his frontispiece portrait placed Hicks firmly within the mainstream of protestant millenarian writing, conjuring the names of Thomas Brightman, Joseph Mede, and John Napier:<blockquote>
<div>Though Brightman, Napeir, Mede are gone to rest,<br>
</div>
<div>Their Sp'rite yet lives redoubled in thy Breast:<br>
</div>
<div>Yee, that have cast th'Apocalyps to ground,<br>
</div>
<div>Because so dark, mysterious and profound,<br>
</div>
<div>Why take it up againe, and use this Glasse,<br>
</div>
<div>Twill then no longer for a Mystrie passe.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Hicks, like his predecessors, held the pope to be Antichrist:<blockquote>The work of this present generation for all Christian Worthies to set their hands and heart to, being (as I conceive) if not to the downfal of the Throne of the Beast, yet at least to the Eclipsing of the Austrian Sun, the great Pillar of the Antichristian State. (Hicks, <span class="italic">Revelation Revealed</span>, epistle dedicatory, sig. a2)</blockquote>However, as is revealed by the essay which formed the second part of the book (with a separate title-page, dedication, and epistle to the reader, but thereafter with pagination continuous with the rest of the volume), he was an opponent of the radical Fifth Monarchists. In &#145;Quinto-Monarchiae &hellip; or a friendly complyance between Christ's monarchy, and the magistrates&#146;, he sought to demonstrate how their misreading of the biblical texts led them to a presumptuous belief in the role of the saints in bringing about the second coming. They had misunderstood many of the prophecies, applying to the present times passages which &#145;rather wholly relate to that most happy and glorious Millenary Kingdom of Christ, wherein Christ, with all his Saints shall reigne and triumph over all their Enemies, before the end and final Judgement&#146;  (&#145;Quinto-Monarchiae&#146;, &#145;To the Christian reader&#146;). Until that time the duty of the saints was not to rule&#151;or to usurp or overthrow the Christian magistrate, who had his own duties in the struggle against Antichrist&#151;but to struggle against sin and popery through the spiritual weapons of prayer and the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. The millennium was approaching, but not yet come, and its timing was in God's hands alone. The Fifth Monarchists:<blockquote>not weighing the various dispensations of God's Providence, through heedlessness, or the temptations of the Evil One &hellip; [they] are carried out to the opposing of Magistracy, an Ordinance of God, that they may bring about (as they conceive) the predeterminate Counsels of God's commands &hellip; Revealed things pertain unto us; but unrevealed things (times and seasons) pertain unto God until the times of their manifestation come. (&#145;Quinto-Monarchiae&#146;, epistle dedicatory)</blockquote>Appropriately, given Hicks's respect for magistracy, <span class="italic">Revelation Revealed</span> was dedicated to a recent lord mayor of London, Sir Richard Chiverton, whose family came from Kerris. Even more significantly, &#145;Quinto-Monarchiae&#146; was dedicated to his fellow Baptist, Colonel Robert Bennet, governor of nearby St Michael's Mount and a powerful and loyal subject of the protectorate in Cornwall who was &#145;a clear example of a religious radical who was relatively moderate and pragmatic in his politics&#146;  (A. Woolrych, <span class="italic">Commonwealth to Protectorate</span>, 1982, 220).<br>
<br>Wood reported the rumour&#151;current in Cornwall and in Exeter College, Oxford, he claimed&#151;that Hicks was not actually the author of <span class="italic">Revelation Revealed</span>: that he had found the manuscript of the book among the papers of his dead kinsman Alexander Harry, sometime fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, and rector of Roche, Cornwall, and published it under his own name. Hicks died at Kerris at the beginning of March 1660, and was buried in the parish church at Paul on 3 March; the administration of his estate was granted to his widow, Margaret, in July.<br>
