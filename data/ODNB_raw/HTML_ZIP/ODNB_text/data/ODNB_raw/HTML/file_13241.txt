<span class="headword">Higgons,  Theophilus</span>  (1578&#150;1659), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in 1578 in Chilton, near Brill, Buckinghamshire, the son of Robert Higgons and his wife, Alice (<i>d</i>. 1608). He was educated partly at the free school at Thame, Oxfordshire, and in 1592, at the age of fourteen, went to Christ Church, Oxford. He graduated BA, proceeded MA in 1600, and was described as a tolerable Latin poet.<br>
<br>It has been said of Higgons that he was &#145;at first inclined to Puritanism, became a convert to Catholicism &hellip; in search of preferment: but finding none, returned to Protestantism&#146;  (Brown, 132). Thomas Ravis, the dean of Christ Church, appointed Higgons his domestic chaplain when he became bishop of Gloucester. Higgons then became a lecturer at St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street, London, where he had a following &#145;for his sweet and eloquent way of preaching&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.482). It was later alleged that he had been both overtly anti-popish and disaffected to episcopacy. Having been there some time, he married, but apparently so clandestinely that relatives and admirers were unimpressed. He subsequently left his wife and children and went to the north of England. He was rector of Little Comberton, Worcestershire, in 1605 and of Garforth, Yorkshire, in 1607. In 1608 he published <span class="italic">A Briefe Consideration of Man's Iniquitie and God's Justice</span>, a pamphlet on venial and mortal sin.<br>
<br>About this time Higgons was received into the Roman Catholic church by one John Fludde, probably the Jesuit John Floyd, an event which hostile commentators interpreted as motivated by ambition or through debt and want of preferment. This was a routine accusation, though it has none the less been asserted that &#145;Higgons had undoubtedly experienced considerable career and financial problems&#146;  (Questier, &#145;Crypto-Catholicism&#146;, 48). He appears to have spent two years at the English colleges at Douai and St Omer under the name Thomas Forster. His father, Robert, went over to St Omer in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade him to return to England. Instead Higgons published in 1609 <span class="italic">The First Motive of T.H. &hellip; to Suspect the Integrity of his Religion</span>, &#145;a conversion tract almost exclusively devoted to justification for purgatory and prayer for the dead&#146;  (ibid., 60). He also attacked protestant views on the assurance of salvation and the counsels of perfection. Sir Edward Hoby's <span class="italic">Letter to Mr. T.H. Late Minister, now Fugitive</span> was written at this time, including a letter from Robert Higgons dated Chilton, 28 May 1609, strongly criticizing his son. Higgons, then living in Rouen, wrote <span class="italic">The Apology of Theophilus Higgons, Lately Minister, now Catholique</span> (1609). Copies of this book &#145;were among the recently imported Catholic books seized by the English government at the house of the Venetian ambassador in July 1609&#146;  (Allison and Rogers, 1.86).<br>
<br>After living in Rouen for some time Higgons was reconverted to protestantism, reportedly by Thomas Morton, dean of Winchester. Again temporal motivations were alleged, Higgons being seen as not having found &#145;that which he expected, namely respect, preferment, and I know not what&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 484&#150;5). He made a public recantation at Paul's Cross, as a result of which he published in 1611 <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached at St Paul's Crosse</span>. He was appointed rector of Hunton, near Maidstone, apparently secured for him by Hoby, in 1610. He would later publish <span class="italic">Mystical Babylon, or papall Rome &hellip; in which the miserable and wicked condition of Rome &hellip; is fully discovered</span> (1624). In March 1642 he was summoned by the House of Commons as a delinquent for giving his support to the recent prayer book petition from Kent. He was sequestered from his living by April 1647 and went to reside at the house of one Daniel Collins in Maidstone. He died at Maidstone in 1659 and was probably buried at the church of All Saints, Maidstone, &#145;in the cemitery &hellip; near to the south east door of the chancel, but hath no stone or mon. over his grave&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.485).<br>
