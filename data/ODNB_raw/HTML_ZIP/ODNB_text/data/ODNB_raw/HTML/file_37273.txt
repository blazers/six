<span class="headword">Cenwulf</span>  (<em>d.</em> 821), <span class="occ">king of the Mercians</span>, was the son of Cuthbert and, according to a contemporary genealogy, descended from Cenwalh, brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21829/', "King Penda (d. 655)")</script>. He succeeded the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20567/', "Offa")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52312/', "Ecgfrith")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20567/', "Offa")</script>], whose brief reign ended in December 796. Alcuin says that Offa shed much blood to secure Ecgfrith's position, and if this refers to a purge of the royal kindred it may explain why Cenwulf succeeded, despite being a distant relative.<br>
<br>Cenwulf's early years as king were troubled. Offa had been overlord of much of southern England, but in 796 Kent rebelled under Eadberht Praen. In 798 Cenwulf attacked, captured Eadberht, and took him to Mercia, where his eyes were put out and his hands amputated. Cenwulf's brother Cuthred was made sub-king of Kent in the same year and they granted land there jointly and individually until Cuthred's death in 807. The coins of a King Eadwald precede Cenwulf's in East Anglia, and hint at another short-lived rising against Mercian overlordship. Relations with Essex are obscure until 811, when King Sigered first witnesses Cenwulf's charters; in 812 he is described as <i>subregulus</i> and in 814 as <i>dux</i>. Thus Cenwulf seems to have deprived him of royal status, as Offa did rulers of Kent and Sussex. Cenwulf's dealings with Sussex are witnessed only by a grant to the bishop of Selsey of 801. He had little power in other kingdoms. King Beorhtric of Wessex had married Offa's daughter and witnessed Ecgfrith's charters, which suggests some kind of association between the two. But there is no evidence of Cenwulf's influence in Wessex beyond a grant by Pope Leo III in 798 of Glastonbury Abbey to Cenwulf's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39213/', "Cynehelm")</script>, and a confirmation of it by Cenwulf himself, both of which may well be later forgeries. On Beorhtric's death in 802, which also saw the repulse of a Mercian invasion under Ealdorman &AElig;thelmund, Wessex probably passed out of Cenwulf's orbit.<br>
<br>King Eardwulf of Northumbria attacked Mercia in 801, probably for sheltering political refugees, and a long campaign ended in a peace agreement. By 808 Eardwulf had been expelled from his kingdom, and Mercian involvement is suggested by a papal letter revealing that Cenwulf and the Northumbrian rebels had written to Charlemagne, to whom Eardwulf had fled. Nevertheless, he was reinstated by envoys of Charlemagne and Pope Leo III in 809. Cenwulf also fought the Welsh, presumably because the difficult situation which had necessitated the building of Offa's Dyke persisted. The Welsh annals record a battle at Rhuddlan, perhaps involving the Mercians, just after Offa's death in 796; in 816 they attacked Rhufoniog and Snowdonia, and in 818 Dyfed. Cenwulf was probably engaged in another Welsh campaign when he died near Chester.<br>
<br>Little is known of Cenwulf's administration, though charter witness lists suggest some continuity with previous regimes in the dozen or so ealdormen also present at grants of Offa and Ecgfrith. Coins, after <i>c</i>.805 bearing portraits derived from Roman models, were struck at Canterbury, Rochester (after <i>c</i>.810), London, and an East Anglian mint. Their royal title, &#145;COENVVLF REX M[ERCIORVM]&#146;, matches that of the charters. Although Offa may once have aspired to be &#145;king of the English&#146;, Cenwulf did not, and it is arguable, for all his control of southern England apart from Wessex, that Mercian power declined in his reign. In 825 the Mercians were heavily defeated by the West Saxons, and were subsequently unable to cope with viking raids. Sixty years after Cenwulf's death their monarchy no longer existed.<br>
<br>In 797 Alcuin wrote to Cenwulf praising his goodness and nobility and exhorting him to be a model Christian king. In 798 Cenwulf founded a monastery at Winchcombe, where a new church was dedicated in 811. Nevertheless, like his predecessors, &AElig;thelbald and Offa, he had problems with the church, which was too powerful to be left uncontrolled, and Alcuin eventually felt obliged to commiserate with the abbess &AElig;thelburgh, Offa's daughter, because ecclesiastics were ruled by tyrants not kings. Presumably as part of his attempt to rule Kent, Cenwulf gave the monastery of St Peter and St Paul, Canterbury, to his relative Cunred and the nunnery of Minster in Thanet to his daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54441/', "Cwenthryth")</script>. He may also have obtained from popes Leo III and Paschal I privileges giving him control of all the monasteries he had acquired. Offa's difficulties with the archbishop of Canterbury had resulted in the creation of a Mercian archbishopric at Lichfield. Possibly pressed by his churchmen, Cenwulf reversed this. In 798 he suggested to Pope Leo III that the province of Canterbury be reconstituted and moved to London&#151;a Mercian city. This Leo rejected, but after further negotiations he did suppress the archbishopric of Lichfield, and this was accepted by an English synod at &#145;Clofesho&#146; in 803. For a time Cenwulf's relations with Canterbury were good, but by 808 a papal letter suggests that he and Archbishop Wulfred (<i>d</i>. 832) were in dispute. No more is known of this and in 814 and 815 Canterbury received a number of royal land grants; but in 816 a synod at Chelsea attempted to challenge lay control of monasteries. A dispute then arose between Cenwulf and Wulfred over the Kentish houses of Reculver and Minster in Thanet, and the pope seems to have suspended the archbishop at the king's request. He was probably not reinstated until 821.<br>
<br>Known relatives of Cenwulf are his brothers Ceolwulf and Cuthred, his queen, &AElig;lfthryth, daughter Cwenthryth, Cuthred's son Cenwald, and Cyneberht and Abbot Cunwald, who appear in charters. Also his son Cynehelm who was evidently buried at Winchcombe and may be the Cynehelm who last witnesses a genuine charter in 811. By the late tenth century Cynehelm was venerated as St Kenelm, and an eleventh-century life claimed that he succeeded his father as a child but was murdered by Cwenthryth. Cenwulf died in 821, at Basingwerk, near Chester, according to the twelfth-century poet Geoffrey Gaimar, and was buried in Winchcombe. Contemporary sources say he was succeeded by his brother Ceolwulf. It may have been his association with St Kenelm which led John of Worcester to call Cenwulf a saint.<br>
