<span class="headword">Potter,  Gillie</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Hugh William Peel]</span>  (1887&#150;1975), <span class="occ">comedian and broadcaster</span>, was born at 27 Weston Street, St Paul, Bedford, on 14 September 1887, the eldest son of the Revd Brignal Peel, a Wesleyan minister, and his wife, Elizabeth Stimson. He was educated at Bedford modern school and, briefly, Worcester College, Oxford, before embarking on the stage career that first made his name.<br>
<br>He first appeared in E. M. Royle's <span class="italic">The White Man</span> at the Lyric Theatre, London, thereafter in touring theatre, musical comedy, concert parties, and pantomime, and in 1915 was George Robey's understudy at the Alhambra. He served as a lieutenant in the Royal Fleet Auxiliary from February 1917. Returning to music-hall after the war he developed his highly individual comedic style and stage persona, described by critic James Agate as &#145;that sham Harrovian who bears upon his blazer the broad arrows of a blameful life&#146;  (Mosley, 116). In straw boater, wide grey flannel trousers (he claimed to have invented &#145;Oxford bags&#146; at the London Coliseum in 1920), and &#145;Old Borstolian&#146; blazer (blue, with white convict arrow on the breast pocket), and generally carrying notebook and rolled umbrella, he lectured his audience in deadpan tones on unlikely and esoteric themes peppered with literary, historical, and linguistic allusion. Though a classical education was needed fully to appreciate his act, it was widely popular: in 1930 he appeared in the royal variety performance, and the following year made his radio d&eacute;but.<br>
<br>At a time when the BBC was seeking new variety styles beyond the broad humour typical of inter-war music-hall, Potter's literate and allusive humour, with its echoes of <span class="italic">Punch</span> and &#145;Beachcomber&#146;, was hailed as the radio comedy of the future. He was soon one of the most popular radio entertainers in Britain, one of the pioneer generation that included Leonard Henry, Mabel Constanduros, A. J. Alan, and Ronald Frankau. His celebrated opening catch-phrase, &#145;Good evening England. This is Gillie Potter speaking to you in English&#146;, signalled his principal themes of the English language and character. His act included at various times the adventures of &#145;my brother who was educated at Borstal&#146;, burlesques of &#145;society snippets&#146;, and parodies of <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entries. However, his fame rests chiefly on his chronicles of the mythical English village of Hogsnorton&#151;the name a typically arcane reference to the proverbial Oxfordshire village where &#145;pigs play on the organ&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brewer</span>, 523)&#151;its noble but impoverished ancestral family, the Marshmallows of Hogsnorton Towers, and their disorderly world of inverted logic and improbable situations. Potter's combination of mock erudition, absurdity, and nostalgia struck a chord with inter-war audiences and made him a household name. When the BBC evacuated much of its staff to Wood Norton Hall, near Evesham, on the eve of the Second World War, its new base was known, inevitably, as Hogsnorton.<br>
<br>Beyond the comedy routines the English language, history, and people were an abiding passion in Potter's life. He was an authority on heraldry, genealogy, and church history, a knight templar, a member of the Middle Temple and the Society of Genealogists, a vice-president of the Royal Society of St George and the Society of King Charles the Martyr, as well as for many years parish clerk of the church of St Botolph, Aldgate, London. His letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span> from the 1930s to 1960s attest both to his eclectic scholarship (topics on which he offered his expertise ranged from the iconography of St Cuthbert to the heraldic derivations of the bunting celebrating the centenary of Waterloo Station) and his distaste for modern trends. He deplored the &#145;alien&#146; pollution of the English comedic tradition by European and particularly American influences. Though he continued to broadcast throughout the Second World War, he felt increasingly out of sympathy with &#145;this era of Priestley and &#147;Penguins&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 10 Aug 1940). After the war, writing from what he termed &#145;unoccupied England&#146;, his targets included the adoption of the word &#145;university&#146; by new scientific higher education institutions and the plans for the new Coventry Cathedral (a &#145;cross between a super-cinema and an abattoir&#146;; <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 27 Nov 1951). His anger at what he considered the BBC's declining moral standards made him an unlikely spokesman for the Popular Television Association, which campaigned in the early 1950s for a commercial alternative to the BBC. He once considered standing for parliament as an independent on the platform of &#145;England for the English&#146;, with special reference to the theatre.<br>
<br>Potter's style of comedy, and the attitudes that coloured it, were increasingly hard to accommodate in the post-war years. His love of language and eye for the absurd led to his being called the English Thurber, but his comedy lacked Thurber's humanism and seemed increasingly dated, particularly on stage. He retired from live performance, it was said, after a chastening experience at the London Palladium performing to an audience of young girls impatient for the headline act Danny Kaye  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>). He was increasingly at odds with the BBC, partly because of his outspoken criticism of its output, partly because he resisted undertaking any broadcasting other than series, partly&#151;mostly, he believed&#151;because of his political views. He completed his last radio series, <span class="italic">Mr Gillie Potter</span>, in 1952, and the following year made his last broadcasts as a comedian, <span class="italic">Coronation at Hogsnorton</span> for radio and <span class="italic">A Little of What you Fancy</span> for television.<br>
<br>Potter was married to Beatrice Fanny Scott; they had two children, a son (J. H. B. Peel, a <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> writer on country matters) and a daughter. In the early 1960s he retired to Bournemouth, occasionally appearing on talks programmes but refusing to speak to the press. His last broadcast appearance was in the panel game <span class="italic">Sounds Familiar</span> in 1970. He died on 4 March 1975, aged eighty-seven, at Douglas House, 84 Southbourne Road, Bournemouth.<br>
