<span class="headword">Orange,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1800, <em>d.</em> 1878), <span class="occ">author and philanthropist</span>, was baptized on 13 April 1800 in the church of St Mary and All Saints, Chesterfield, the son of William Orange, joiner, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Maw, who married at Chesterfield on 9 July 1792. He had a sister, Maria, baptized on 17 August 1794, an older brother, William, baptized on 28 May 1797, and a twin brother baptized on the same day as he was. Little is known of Orange's early life before his marriage, on 6 August 1823, to Hannah Flint (1793/4&#150;1854) of Fairfield, Derbyshire. The first of their five children, George Flint, was baptized at the Independent chapel, Heanor, Derbyshire, in August 1825; the other four&#151;Mary Anne Flint (<i>bap</i>. May 1829), William Burgess Flint, (<i>bap</i>. Dec 1831), Charles James, (<i>bap</i>. Aug 1832), and James Edward Dakin (<i>bap</i>. Feb 1837)&#151;were baptized at Salem Independent Chapel, Barker Gate, Nottingham, where Orange and his family had settled about 1829.<br>
<br>By the early 1830s Orange was a leading figure at Salem Chapel, helping to establish the adjacent charity school for the poor. When the pastor, a Mr Butcher, became incapacitated he bequeathed his pastorate jointly to Orange and Charles Jones of Highgate. However, the chapel was saddled with a &pound;900 debt, which appears to have prevented the new pastors designate from taking office. It is unclear whether Orange was ever ordained or actually practised as a minister (his name does not appear in lists of Independent ministers) but henceforth he used the title Reverend. In 1839 the creditors sold the chapel and school, forcing both to close. Orange described this as &#145;the heaviest affliction of our lives, to many of us&#146;  (Orange, 947&#150;8). Yet the late 1830s and early 1840s were the most active and productive of Orange's life. He published three books in a single year, emerged as a significant force in the civic life of Nottingham, and almost single-handed began the allotment movement in the east midlands, while building up his business interests and family relationships.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">History of Nottingham</span> was issued serially in 1838&#150;40 and in book form in 1840. According to Orange every copy was subscribed for prior to printing but it was less well received by later historians of Nottingham, partly no doubt because of its moral and political didacticism. W. H. Wylie criticized its strictly chronological plan, while J. T. Godfrey dismissed it as &#145;worthy of little notice&#146;  (Godfrey, 3) and Potter Briscoe was equally scathing. Also published in 1840 was Orange's narrative of George Vason (1772&#150;1838), one of the first missionaries sent by the London Missionary Society to the Pacific islands, and governor of Nottingham gaol.<br>
<br>The third of Orange's publications to appear in 1840 was <span class="italic">A Plea on Behalf of the Poor</span>. This heralded a shift in emphasis towards social activism. Nottingham in 1840 was suffering from overcrowding and from unemployment and low wages in the handloom weaving and lace industries. Orange's solution was allotment provision, which would supplement incomes, improve health, and alleviate unemployment. He obtained the support of local worthies, including a former mayor and leading industrialists, established the Northern and Midland Counties Artisan's and Labourer's Friend Society, and was instrumental in the eventual provision of allotments in Chilwell and at Forest Grove. Meanwhile he formed local allotment societies in villages and towns throughout the east midlands, lecturing to rapt audiences. Sometimes he lectured several times a week, often revisiting places months later to urge on the local poor in their quest for land. This was done without remuneration: although Orange applied to become the salaried agent of the Labourer's Friend Society (LFS), the main organization dedicated to allotment promotion nationally, the LFS turned him down, possibly on religious grounds, awarding him in lieu a grant of &pound;20 for his expenses. Despite this setback Orange achieved remarkable results: by the late 1840s allotments, rare in the east midlands before he began his work, were probably more common than anywhere else in England.<br>
<br>At the same time Orange developed a remarkable variety of business interests. In trade directories of the time he is variously described as lacemaker, publisher, land surveyor, land agent, and iron- and brass-founder. In the early 1840s he operated four power looms from a factory on Leenside, Nottingham, also employing smiths to make steam engines. By 1851 he had become managing partner in the Rutland Iron Foundry, Granby Street, employing thirty-three people. Some time between 1854 and 1861 he sold his interest in this concern, giving the proceeds to his two eldest sons, and moved to London, where he taught Hebrew, and was also recorded as being a dissenting minister. He published <span class="italic">Synoptica Hebraea: Anglo-Hebrew Bible Expositor: a Manual of Self-Instruction</span> in 1858. He continued to take part in civic affairs through the Tower Hamlets vestry, attending, voting, and sitting on committees until 1873. While living in London he married his second wife, Emily (<i>b</i>. 1815/16), who survived him. He died at his home, 471 Mile End Road, London, on 6 January 1878 and was buried on 11 January in Nottingham general cemetery.<br>
<br>Orange was a man of tremendous energy and enthusiasm. His interests were bewilderingly diverse, yet he never wavered in his Independent faith, his dedication to improving the lives of the poor, or his desire to instruct others. His impetuous prolixity made him ill suited for scholarship, and his purportedly academic work has not stood the test of time. But his humanity, durable enthusiasm, and imperturbable assurance were exactly the qualities required to activate the allotment movement, and it is for this and for his activities as a philanthropist and social reformer before and afterwards that Orange deserves to be remembered.<br>
