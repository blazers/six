<span class="headword">Fraunceys,  Adam</span>  (<em>c.</em>1310&#150;1375), <span class="occ">merchant and mayor of London</span>, is of uncertain origin. His parents were called Adam and Constance, but who they were and where they lived is unknown. It is unlikely that the family came from London, and possible that Adam was born in Yorkshire, in view of his close relationship with <a href="#cosubject_52177">Simon Fraunceys [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and of the precautions which he took in 1369 to avoid identification with two felons from that region who shared his name. His exact date of birth is not known, but it must have been during or about the first decade of the fourteenth century, and in youth he was probably sent to London to be apprenticed. By 1339 he was already a merchant of some means, operating in Bruges, and able to offer the king the substantial loan of &pound;100. Details of his business dealings are sparse, but like most wealthy merchants of the period he exported wool, and by the 1340s had become a supporter of the various syndicates of customs farmers which prevailed for most of that decade. At the same time Fraunceys lent large sums of money to the nobility and gentry, military men embarking on service overseas, fellow citizens, religious houses, and not least the crown and members of the royal family.<br>
<br>So successful had Fraunceys become as a merchant and financier that in 1352 he was elected in quick succession alderman of Queenhithe ward (removing in 1356 to Lime Street) and then mayor, holding office for two consecutive years. In November 1352 he was appointed, possibly <i>ex officio</i>, to investigate alleged corruption by collectors of the fifteenth granted in 1348 and 1352. Between 1357 and 1359 he sat on a commission to inquire into the failure to enforce the <span class="roman">Statute of Labourers</span> in London, and in February 1364 both he and his close associate John Pyel were among those sent on a mission to Calais to deal with complaints by the staplers against the government, which resulted in the reorganization of the administration there. He represented London in parliament at least six times, more than most citizens of his day, and his career seems to reflect a clear sense of civic pride and responsibility. He was co-founder of a college of chantry priests at Guildhall in 1356, and in his will he established two chantries in the church of St Helen, Bishopsgate, in whose precinct he had lived for a number of years and where he chose to be buried. If he was not a Londoner by birth, he certainly devoted his energies wholeheartedly to his adoptive city, showing little interest in his native town, wherever it may have been. By 31 May 1359 he had married Agnes, whose surname is unknown.<br>
<br>In common with other members of London's mercantile &eacute;lite Fraunceys was an assiduous purchaser of land. A high proportion of his acquisitions were in London itself, but he also busied himself creating estates outside the city, mostly in the neighbouring counties of Essex and Middlesex. In February 1349, at the height of the plague, he bought the manor of Wyke in Middlesex, comprising lands in Hackney Wick, Old Ford, and Stepney, from his fellow mercer John Causton, and later added to this collection, apparently through local clerical agents who bought small parcels of land on Fraunceys's behalf. In 1357 he bought the manor of Chobhams in West Ham, and in 1359 that of Ruckholts in Leyton. Meanwhile he was buying up lands in North Middlesex, in Enfield, Tottenham, and Edmonton, mostly in partnership with Peter Favelor, a retainer of William de Bohun, earl of Northampton. In 1361 he acquired the manor, and shortly afterwards, probably around 1363, the lordship, of Edmonton, which was to be the centrepiece of his estates. It was at this time, and no doubt to mark this important occasion, that he had an impressive cartulary of his properties drawn up, and it was on the manor of Edmonton that his descendants were settled.<br>
<br>Adam Fraunceys died in London on 4 May 1375 and was buried at St Helen's, Bishopsgate. He was survived by his widow, Agnes, who was still living in 1394, his son, Adam, knight of the shire (<i>d</i>. 1417), and daughter, Maud, later countess of Salisbury (<i>d</i>. 1424) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54445/', "Montagu, Maud")</script>].<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_52177"></a><span class="headword">Simon Fraunceys</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1358), <span class="occ">merchant and mayor of London</span>, was born in the late thirteenth century. He appears to have come from Pontefract, Yorkshire, and, like Adam Fraunceys, may have come to London as a boy apprentice. In 1311 his son, John, was apprenticed to Simon Paris, mercer, for seven years. His civic career began when, though not yet an alderman, he was elected sheriff in 1328. In 1336 he was made alderman of Langbourn ward, and in 1339 alderman of Cheap. Fraunceys was chosen to succeed John Oxenford as mayor when the latter died in office in June 1342, and was re-elected the following October. He served as mayor once again for the year 1355&#150;6, towards the end of his life. He was summoned to represent the king's council and parliament six times between 1339 and 1352, and served on other royal commissions. A wealthy merchant and financier he died holding lands in Essex, Middlesex, Bedfordshire, and Kent. He was closely associated with both Adam and Ellis Fraunceys, executors of his will, although it cannot be said with any certainty that a blood tie existed between them. He died on 4 July 1358, leaving a widow, Maud, and a son, Thomas.<br>
