<span class="headword">Powel <span class="st"> [Powell]</span>,  David</span>  (1549<span class="mult">x</span>52&#150;1598), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and historian</span>, was the son of Hywel ap Dafydd ap Gruffudd of Denbighshire (his father's family possessed a pedigree stretching back to beyond 1073) and of Katherine, the daughter of Gruffudd ab Ievan ap Dafydd. At the age of sixteen, some time between 1566 and 1568, David Powel went to study at Oxford University although his initial college membership is not known. He migrated to Jesus College upon its foundation in 1571 and is thought to be its first graduate, receiving the degree of BA on 3 March 1573 and that of MA on 6 July 1576. In the meantime Powel married Elizabeth, the daughter of Cynwrig of Marchwiail before 1570. The couple had at least three sons&#151;Daniel, the eldest and a layperson, and two clerics, Samuel (1570&#150;1600) and Gabriel (1576&#150;1611). Powel's scholarly talents were considerable enough to attract the support of the church. Even before his graduation he was named vicar of Ruabon in Denbighshire in 1570, and the rectory of Llanfyllin in Montgomeryshire followed in 1571. In 1579 he exchanged Llanfyllin for the vicarage of Meifod, and he also held two prebends in St Asaph Cathedral. Such support allowed Powel to pursue further studies in theology so that in 1583 he earned the degree of BTh from Oxford on 19 February and proceeded DTh on 11 April. Between about 1584 and 1586 Powel was at Ludlow, serving as private chaplain to Sir Henry Sidney, president of the council in the marches of Wales.<br>
<br>Although Powel did not enjoy a long life, he contributed significantly to the development and preservation of Welsh culture and helped to plant the seeds of protestantism in Wales. As both a staunch Welsh patriot and a committed protestant Powel engaged in many activities and projects to forward those interests. In particular, he supported efforts to translate the entire <span class="roman">Bible</span> into Welsh, a project that was finally completed in 1587. Its translator William Morgan gratefully acknowledged Powel's assistance. During 1588 he was mentioned as one of three preachers working in the diocese of St Asaph and for years he kept the privy council informed about illegal and possibly treasonous books, libels, and prophecies that circulated among Welsh Roman Catholics.<br>
<br>Powel was also a respected scholar and early on became associated with the group of geographers that included John Dee and Richard Hakluyt. He may be the &#145;D. P.&#146; who wrote the elementary tract <span class="italic">Brief Rules of Geography for the Understanding of Maps and Charts</span> (1573). When John Dee left England in September 1573, Powel inherited the project of preparing for publication a manuscript in the possession of Sir Henry Sidney. It was the English translation by the antiquary Humphrey Llwyd of some medieval Welsh chronicles. With the help of William Cecil, Lord Burghley, who provided him with access to important documents, Powel went further and greatly expanded Llwyd's work in both depth of detail and in chronological coverage. In doing so he was careful to make his additions typographically distinct. The result was Powel's <i>magnum opus</i>, <span class="italic">The Historie of Cambria, now called Wales</span> (1584), the first printed history of Wales. It remained a major and popular source for medieval Welsh history until the early nineteenth century. In it Powel showed his ardent support of the Tudor dynasty. <span class="italic">The Historie of Cambria</span> also popularized the legend of the discovery of America by the Welsh prince Madoc about 1170. Powel, along with Dee, personally supported the authenticity of the Madoc story which served to justify English encroachments on Spanish America as Hakluyt showed in his <span class="italic">Discourse on Western Planting</span> (1584). It also for centuries spawned countless tales of encounters with Welsh Indians on the American frontier.<br>
<br>The next year, 1585, saw Powel publish an omnibus volume containing editions of Ponticus Virunnius's <span class="italic">Historia Britannica</span>; Gerald of Wales's <span class="italic">Itinerarium Cambriae</span> and <span class="italic">Descriptio Cambriae</span> (omitting its negative comments about the Welsh); and the letter entitled <span class="italic">De Britannica historia recte intelligenda</span>. This volume he dedicated to Sir Henry Sidney, who now employed him as his personal chaplain. According to his son Daniel and the Welsh lexicographer Dr John Davies, Powel also worked on a Welsh dictionary throughout his life which was never published. He died early in 1598 at Ruabon and was buried there.<br>
