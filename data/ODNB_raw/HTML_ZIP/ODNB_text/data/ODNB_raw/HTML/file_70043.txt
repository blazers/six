<span class="headword">Mac an Bhaird family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1400&#150;<em>c.</em>1695), <span class="occ">Gaelic poets</span>, was an Irish family (clann an Bhaird, &#145;the children of the bard&#146;) famous for poetry and learning. The name suggests an early link with learning, through descent from a bard, the earliest kind of poet attested among the Celtic peoples, who was in medieval Ireland regarded as inferior to the learned <i>file</i>. The surname is first attested in the annals in 1173, when M&aacute;el &Iacute;su Macc in Baird died bishop of Clonfert, a see in co. Galway.<br>
<br>What has been regarded as the senior learned line, and possibly the kin of M&aacute;el &Iacute;su of 1173, first appears in the annals in 1408 with the death of Mac an Bhaird of C&uacute;l an Urtainn, <i>ollamh</i> of U&iacute; Mhaine in co. Galway, of which the family of &Oacute; Ceallaigh (O Kelly) were the leaders. The term <i>ollamh</i> is usually translated as &#145;chief poet&#146;, but he also had enormous power as the chief's political counsellor. The first name of this <i>ollamh</i> is not known, and none of his work, nor that of any of the co. Galway family, is known to have survived. Families of Mac an Bhaird (in various Anglicizations, including Ward) are still on record in the &Oacute; Ceallaigh country in the seventeenth century, but by then the learned tradition of the family had moved on. Possibly members of this same branch of the poetic family did continue to produce verse (of some kind) for several centuries, while leaving no written evidence of it; they might conceivably include a group of &#145;McEwards&#146;, &#145;rymers&#146; in Ballymote, co. Sligo, who were &#145;pardoned&#146; by Queen Elizabeth in 1603.<br>
<br>A second branch of the family was clearly in evidence by 1488, when the annals record the death of &#145;Mac an Bhaird Oirghiall&#146;, the head of the branch belonging to Oirghialla (Oriel), an Ulster territory approximating to co. Monaghan; he was Nuadha, son of Se&aacute;n Cam, and his grandfather C&uacute; Uladh probably lived about 1400. This is usually taken to be an offshoot of the Mac an Bhaird family of U&iacute; Mhaine, but there is a hint in Roderic O'Flaherty's <span class="italic">Ogygia</span> (1685) that in fact the Mac an Bhaird family of Oriel was just as ancient as that of U&iacute; Mhaine. None of the Oriel family, however, is identified as a poet before the mid-sixteenth century. After that there are several extant poems composed by a poet (or poets) called Aodh mac Diarmada (Mhic an Bhaird) to patrons in that area, notably &Oacute; Raghallaigh leaders in co. Cavan in 1596&#150;8, and a Maguire (Fermanagh) aristocrat in 1566.<br>
<br>The third branch of the family, the most important and (as far as is known) the most productive, was based in T&iacute;r Conaill (co. Donegal), and it is usually assumed to have derived from one of the two branches already mentioned. This may be correct, but the beginnings of the Donegal family have been placed about the year 1400, very much the same time that the other two families are first heard of. In 1510 the annals record the death of Eoghan Ruadh Mac an Bhaird, <i>ollamh</i> to &Oacute; Domhnaill (O Donnell) of T&iacute;r Conaill, and it is as poets to the O Donnell family that Clann an Bhaird are best known thereafter. This Eoghan Ruadh may have been the son of Gofraidh mac Eoghain, who died in 1478 and is the first Mac an Bhaird T&iacute;re Conaill (head of the Donegal family) on record; the earliest surviving Mac an Bhaird poem is one composed on the death of an O Donnell chief in 1420 by <a name="cosubject_72769"></a><span class="headword">Eoghan Mac an Bhaird</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1420)<span class="occ"></span>, Gofraidh's father. It may be to this Eoghan that a seventeenth-century poet of the family refers when he claims to belong to &#145;Sliocht Eoghain mh&oacute;ir Mhic an Bhaird&#146; (descendants of the great Eoghan Mac an Bhaird)  (Mh&aacute;g Craith, 1.120). Poets of the Donegal family are fairly well documented, both in the annals and in their poetic works, for the next two centuries. Another <i>ollamh</i>, Aodh, was killed in 1522.<br>
<br>Conchobhar Ruadh died in 1541 as <i>ollamh</i> to O Donnell, and he was apparently author of an extant poem of 1505 on the death of the O Donnell chief. His brother Cormac (<i>d</i>. 1534) was also a poet. Conchobhar's son C&uacute; Uladh and grandson Maol Muire (<i>d</i>. 1597) were both learned poets, as were Cormac's sons Flann and Uilliam &Oacute;g (<i>d</i>. 1576). Uilliam &Oacute;g was <i>ollamh</i> to O Donnell, and had two sons who were poets, <a name="cosubject_72770"></a><span class="headword">Eoghan  Ruadh Mac an Bhaird</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1570, <em>d.</em> after 1625)<span class="occ"></span> and a second Uilliam &Oacute;g, who was still composing in 1641. He seems also to have had a third son, Fearghal, whose son Somhairle flourished as a poet about 1649. An unbroken poetic line can thus be identified from Cormac in the early sixteenth century to his great-grandson, Somhairle, about 1649.<br>
<br>Eoghan Ruadh may have been regarded as <i>ollamh</i> to O Donnell about the turn of the seventeenth century, and his life and verse are both closely tied to the varying political fortunes of the O Donnell family. He accompanied his chief in the historic &#145;flight of the earls&#146; in 1607, when Gaelic rule in Ulster was effectively ended. He was living in Flanders when O Donnell died in 1608, and he later went on to Rome; but his poems continue to show his central concern with the misfortunes and hopes of the O Donnells and Ireland. A volume of his work was edited in 1930 (O Raghallaigh). Walsh's verdict on it is that it is &#145;very indifferent&#146;  (Walsh, 204); none the less Eoghan Ruadh was one of the two most prolific and important poets of the Donegal family. In 1612 Eoghan Ruadh received a pension from Philip III of Spain, and he seems to have died in Rome some time after 1625.<br>
<br>Quite possibly a son of Eoghan Ruadh (though there is no overwhelming evidence to that effect) was Aodh Buidhe Mac an Bhaird, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17330/', "Father Hugh Ward (1592&#150;1635)")</script>, who was born in co. Donegal, became a Franciscan, and went to the Irish College at Louvain in 1622 as professor of philosophy.<br>
<br>The other most important Mac an Bhaird poet is <a name="cosubject_72771"></a><span class="headword">Fearghal  &Oacute;g Mac an Bhaird</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1618<span class="mult">x</span>30)<span class="occ"></span>, who lived about the same time as Eoghan Ruadh but belonged to a different kin within the Donegal family. His father, who died in 1550, is named in the annals as Fearghal, &#145;mac domhnaill ruaidh sao&iacute; fhirdhana, 7 oide sccol&#146; (which has been translated as &#145;a learned poet, a master of schools&#146;), and both Fearghal's sons were poets. One, Eoghan Ruadh, was hanged in 1572. Fearghal &Oacute;g may have been born in the 1540s and in 1581 he was in Scotland, where he may even have had King James VI among his patrons, and where he reports his distress, clearly amounting to &#145;culture-shock&#146;  (&Oacute; Mach&aacute;in, 56), at the effects of the Reformation there. He may also have been something of a rebel among Irish poets, for he seems to be the subject of a poem  (O. Bergin, <span class="italic">Irish Bardic Poetry</span>, 1970, 118) by another professional chiding him for composing poetry while out riding his horse: true <i>filidheacht</i> should be composed indoors, in the dark, and involve serious brainstorming. Fearghal also once threw a goblet of wine in the face of M&aacute;g Uidhir (the Maguire chief), and apologized poetically for it. Later in life he lived for a while on the continent, and there are a few unhappy poems from there. He is known to have visited Louvain after 1618 and then to have returned to Ireland, where he died before 1630, but beyond these facts little is known of his life.<br>
<br>Fearghal &Oacute;g left more of his work than any other Mac an Bhaird poet, about sixty poems, his patrons being aristocrats in all parts of the northern half of Ireland, but of course principally the O Donnell leadership; however, primacy as O Donnell poet about 1600 seems to have gone to Eoghan Ruadh (mac Uilliam &Oacute;ig). One critic thought that Fearghal &Oacute;g &#145;was a voluminous composer of simple, if not very distinguished verse&#146;  (E. Knott, <span class="italic">An Introduction to Irish Syllabic Poetry of the Period 1200&#150;1600</span>, 1928, 82). Bergin's opinion is more enthusiastic: &#145;many of Fearghal &Oacute;g's poems have a natural grace and charm beyond the miracles of technique admired and imitated in the schools&#146;  (O. Bergin, <span class="italic">Irish Bardic Poetry</span>, 1970, 118). It has been suggested that a specimen of Fearghal &Oacute;g's handwriting is extant in the National Library of Scotland's manuscript Adv. 72.1.1, which he may have owned at one point.<br>
<br>It is becoming clear that these conservative professional poets, like their masters, were quite willing to collaborate fully, when necessary, with the new English world being imposed by King James. The leading Donegal poets Eoghan Ruadh and Fearghal &Oacute;g have been classed among the great &#145;innovators&#146; of the 1600 period because of the willingness evidenced in their poetry to face up to the grim reality of life under the new masters  (Caball, 4, 12). In 1603 Eoghan Ruadh was a member of an official &#145;inquisition&#146; in Donegal, looking into the extent of the O Donnell lands. In 1922 Eleanor Knott wrote as follows of the introduction of new political themes to professional verse:<blockquote>Towards the end of the 16th century we find E&oacute;ghan Ruadh Mhac an Bhaird attempting to express a more intellectual outlook in verses which reflect a faint gleam of the humanizing influence which was beginning&#151;too late&#151;to rise over the schools. (Knott, <span class="italic">Bardic Poems</span>, 2.xxxiv)</blockquote>Despite the central importance of the Donegal family, the Oriel branch of Clann an Bhaird is also worthy of note. In the sixteenth century Laoiseach Mac an Bhaird, probably a member of the Oriel family and still living in co. Monaghan in 1601, scolds a neighbour (in technically perfect <i>deibhidhe</i> metre, of course) for following &#145;English ways&#146; of dress and hairstyle  (O. Bergin, <span class="italic">Irish Bardic Poetry</span>, 1970, 49); but he is perhaps also the author of two &#145;courtly&#146; love poems that have survived. Gofraidh mac Briain Mhic an Bhaird, of the Oriel family, is an important figure in early seventeenth-century verse, with fifteen professional poems extant, to O Donnell leaders and other Ulster and Connaught figures, as well as religious verse. Gofraidh &Oacute;g Mac an Bhaird (whose father Gofraidh was also a poet, perhaps the same Gofraidh mac Briain) left a poem lamenting an O Donnell chief who died in 1655. Later there is a P&aacute;draig &Oacute;g Mac an Bhaird (whose <i>floruit</i> date has been given as <i>c</i>.1690, but whose family links are unknown) and his son, another Fearghal &Oacute;g, producing poetry.<br>
<br>A Louvain Franciscan priest who called himself in Latin Cornelius Wardaeus&#151;doubtless for <a name="cosubject_72767"></a><span class="headword">Conchobhar Mac an Bhaird</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1641)<span class="occ"></span>&#151;can be firmly linked to the poetic family. Probably a member of the Donegal family, he volunteered in 1624, with other Franciscans (and with the authority of Aodh Mac an Bhaird among others), to take part in a mission to the highlands of Scotland, where Catholics had had few, if any, Gaelic-speaking priests since the Reformation (in 1560). He came to Muckairn, Argyll, and the published English summary of his Latin report to Rome reads:<blockquote>Campbell of Calder was laird; Calder was a man of great importance, but a heretic; it was very difficult to gain access to him; knowing, however, that Calder held poets in high regard, Ward, having composed a poem in praise of Calder, disguised himself as an Irish poet; then, accompanied by a singer, carrying a harp, he presented himself before Calder [<i>mox cum uno cytharoeda, et cantore (ut moris erat) ingredior</i>], and was graciously received; Ward continued in the guise of a poet for three days, and then disclosed to Calder who he actually was; &hellip; later, &hellip; the latter became a catholic. (Giblin, 53&#150;4)</blockquote>Whatever may be meant by the word &#145;disguised&#146;, Mac an Bhaird clearly knew what was involved in being a professional <i>file</i>. He was imprisoned at the Gatehouse in London between 1630 and 1632, and remained on the Scottish mission until it ended in 1637. He then returned to Ireland, where he died in 1641.<br>
<br>The practice of composing syllabic praise poems for patrons did not end with English conquest, but hung on, in places, even into the 1690s. A good example is <a name="cosubject_72768"></a><span class="headword">Diarmaid  mac Laoisigh Mhic an Bhaird</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1675&#150;1695)<span class="occ"></span>, who left nine poems, six of them in praise of Mac Mathghamhna (MacMahon) leaders in co. Monaghan. A modern scholar calls him &#145;one of the last fully-trained classical poets practising his art in this country&#146;  (Hughes, 1987, 67). Little is known about his life, but he can safely be regarded as a late representative of the Oriel family, although some sources say that he belonged to co. Down.<br>
<br>Diarmaid also took part in the last, almost laughably late, poetic <i>iomarbh&aacute;gh</i> or &#145;contention&#146;, of which the four extant component poems are in the <span class="roman">Book of Clanranald</span> (in the National Museum of Scotland), probably written in the 1680s. The contention is about the heraldic right to the symbol of the Red Hand, which Diarmaid claims for the Mac Aonghusa family of co. Down; Eoghan &Oacute; Donnghaile disputes this and claims it for the &Oacute; N&eacute;ill family, and the Scottish poet Niall Mac Muireadhaigh (<i>c</i>.1637&#150;1726) writes a reply to each of the Irish poets, claiming the Red Hand for Clann D&ograve;mhnaill (the MacDonalds). This <i>iomarbh&aacute;gh</i> echoes the much larger poetic contention in which, early in the seventeenth century, numerous Irish poets squabbled learnedly about the relative merits of the north and south of Ireland, just as the English conquest was in the process of destroying their old Gaelic world forever, following the battle of Kinsale. If that earlier <i>iomarbh&aacute;gh</i> exemplified the unreal ivory tower world of the learned poets, the Red Hand contention shows that nothing much had changed in the run-up to the battle of the Boyne.<br>
