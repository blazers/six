<span class="headword">Powell,  Gabriel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1576, <em>d.</em> 1611), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and polemicist</span>, was born at Ruabon, Denbighshire, and baptized on 13 January 1576, the son of David Powell (1549&times;52&#150;1598) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22643/', "Powel, David")</script>], vicar of Meifod, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Cynwrig ap Robert ap Hywel. He entered Jesus College, Oxford, in Lent term 1592, and graduated BA on 13 February 1596. He then spent some time in foreign universities, and probably, from 1601, at his sinecure rectory of Llansanffraid-ym-Mechain, Montgomeryshire, which he held until 1607, and which his father had also held. On 2 March 1605 he supplicated for a BD degree from St Mary Hall, Oxford, but it is not known whether he obtained it.<br>
<br>That year Powell became domestic chaplain to Richard Vaughan, bishop of London, and in 1606 rector of Chellesworth, Suffolk, a crown living. He was collated on 14 October 1609 to the prebend of Portpool in St Paul's, by Bishop Thomas Ravis of London, and on 15 October 1610 he was admitted vicar of Northolt, Middlesex, by Bishop George Abbot of London.<br>
<br>Powell was highly regarded by most contemporaries for his learned and virulently anti-papal polemics. He opposed any toleration of &#145;Romanism&#146; as an idolatrous and even heathenish religion. His <span class="italic">Consideration of the Papists</span> (1604) predicted dire consequences for England should Prince Henry marry a Catholic. The following year he labelled the Roman church the &#145;synagogue of Antichrist&#146; and declared himself &#145;as certain that the pope is Antichrist as that Jesus Christ is the son of God and redeemer of the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Disputationum &hellip; de Antichristo et eius ecclesia</span>, dedicatory epistle). This treatise won the admiration of Matthew Sutcliffe and Thomas Holland, and was sent to Venice when that city appeared on the verge of converting to protestantism. Forty years later Archbishop Laud would denounce Powell's &#145;peremptoriness&#146;, quoting with distaste his equation of the pope with Antichrist as an example of &#145;foul language in controversies&#146; which he doubted &#145;did ever yet convert an understanding papist&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, ed. W. Scott and J. Bliss, 1847&#150;60, 4.309). Certainly Powell never minced words; to his own generation, however, he was simply enunciating orthodoxy.<br>
<br>Theologically a staunch Calvinist, Powell defended particular election, reprobation, and assurance of salvation. Taken together, the zeal of his antipopery, Laud's denunciation, and his authorship of a popular treatise of practical piety, <span class="italic">The Resolved Christian</span> (1600), written to &#145;recall the worldling&#146; from a &#145;voluptuous, foolish, prodigal, passionate&#146; life  (<span class="italic">Resolved Christian</span>, 7) and in its seventh edition by 1617, may explain why some nineteenth-century historians (following Benjamin Brook, <span class="italic">Lives of the Puritans</span>, 1813) mistook him for a puritan. In fact, Powell directed his polemical ire against protestant nonconformists as well as Catholics, and has been more aptly placed &#145;at the centre of the ecclesiastical establishment&#146;, a &#145;government apologist&#146; for the state church and its ceremonies  (Milton, 56, 111). In <span class="italic">De adiaphora</span> (1607), one of three treatises directed against the puritan William Bradshaw, he condemned the &#145;seeds of discord&#146; sown by &#145;factious and giddie brains&#146; who scrupled at the surplice, sign of the cross, and kneeling at communion  (<span class="italic">De adiaphora</span>, 13.60). These are things indifferent, resisted only by &#145;factious frequenters of private conventicles&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Rejoynder unto the Mild Defence &hellip; of the Silenced Ministers</span>, 1607, 100). In the interests of unity and order Powell defended the &#145;absolute power and authority&#146; given by God to the church to establish ceremonies and rites  (<span class="italic">De adiaphora</span>, 9). Underlying much of his anti-Catholic writing was his message to nonconformists that ceremonies and liturgy did not make the Church of England less than thoroughly protestant; he was himself a living emblem of the English church's tradition of denouncing popish superstition while maintaining liturgical order. The theme he hammered home in his exchanges with Bradshaw was that nonconformists undermined the battle against the true enemy, the Roman Antichrist, by creating dissension in the protestant camp and paving the way to separatism.<br>
<br>Powell always made it clear, however, that popery was the greater threat. He stressed both the common theological ground between puritans and conformists and their common devotion to the king. Puritans were merely &#145;factious brethren&#146;, while papists were &#145;bloody traitors&#146; faithful only &#145;unto the pope and the devil&#146;  (<span class="italic">Consideration of the Deprived and Silenced Ministers</span>, 1606, 10&#150;11). Powell died in 1611. The exact date is unknown, but his successor was admitted to the Northolt living on 18 December.<br>
