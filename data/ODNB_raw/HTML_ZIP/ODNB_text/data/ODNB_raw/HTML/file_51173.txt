<span class="headword">Glancy, Sir  Bertrand James</span>  (1882&#150;1953), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born in Ireland on 31 December 1882. His father, Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Glancy, was an officer in the Royal Engineers who spent most of his life working abroad, and his mother, Helen, moved from hotel to hotel on the French riviera, with the result that Bertrand was brought up by a maiden aunt in Roscommon. He met his sister, Ethel, only at a tennis party when he was seventeen. His education began at a school for the sons of army officers at Westward Ho!. He soon moved on to Clifton College as a day boy, where he experienced the trauma of the death of one of his elder brothers. This may have contributed to a further removal to Monmouth, another minor public school more renowned for its rugby than classics, where Bertrand completed his studies before going up to Exeter College, Oxford, as a commoner at the age of nineteen.<br>
<br>Bertrand followed in the footsteps of his elder brother, Sir Reginald Isidore Robert Glancy (1874&#150;1939), when he entered the Indian Civil Service in 1905. Like Reginald, he was to spend many years in the political department working in the princely states of India, although he received his initial training in the prestigious Punjab cadre of the Indian Civil Service. This latter experience reinforced his natural disposition towards unending work, born of social unease and a desperate need to please the ambitions of his &#145;martinet of a mother&#146;. In later years Glancy overcame his shyness by developing a reputation as a brilliant wit and raconteur. He remained anxious to please his mother, however, keeping up a regular weekly correspondence until her death at the age of ninety-one.<br>
<br>In the year before his posting as first assistant to the agent to the governor-general in Rajputana in 1915 he married Grace Steele in Mount Abu, a hill station in Bombay presidency. Only one of their four children, Terence, was to survive; all the others died in infancy. From 1918 to 1921 Glancy was posted to the residency in Kashmir. After a brief spell at the political department in Delhi in 1921 his services were &#145;lent&#146; to the state of Jammu and Kashmir for five years.<br>
<br>On his return from home leave in 1926 Glancy returned to the political department in Delhi. In 1929 however he re-entered the world of the princely states. From then until 1932 he was president of the Jaipur council of state, before beginning his third and final spell of duty in Kashmir. After a home leave Glancy became resident and agent to the governor-general in the princely states of central India in 1933, and was stationed at Indore.<br>
<br>Glancy's dealings with Tukoji Rao Puar III (1888&#150;1937), the ruler of the tiny Maratha princely state of Dewas Senior, some 350 miles north-west of Bombay, were years later held up by the novelist E. M. Forster in his memoir, <span class="italic">The Hill of Devi</span> (1953), as symptomatic of British insensitivity in relationships with Indians. Tukoji's dispute with the political department, which culminated in his flight to French Pondicherry, was occasioned by gross financial mismanagement. The workaholic Glancy certainly had little personal sympathy with the effete ruler and his court, but Tukoji's claim that he acted vindictively in revenge for an earlier humiliation of his brother Reginald is untenable. Forster's account is also tendentious: it was largely prompted by romantic memories of the Christmas house parties at Dewas between 1909 and 1914, which Tukoji put on for his former guardian, Sir Malcolm Darling (1880&#150;1969), and his set of highbrow British friends.<br>
<br>Glancy's pre-eminence as an administrator in princely India was recognized by his appointment in 1934 as political secretary and, from 1938, political adviser to the crown representative. This period was marked by the ultimately futile attempts to secure the princes' accession to a future all-India federation as envisaged by the 1935 <span class="roman">Government of India Act</span>. Many of the princes were unaware of the wider issues at stake; they were also disquieted by the increasing agitation for reform within their domains supported by the Indian National Congress, although it did not formally operate within the princely states. The failure of the federation scheme led ultimately to the collapse of the princely order on the British departure in 1947, and the transfer of power to the two democratic governments of India and Pakistan. Glancy, along with colleagues in the political department, greatly regretted this outcome and regarded it as a desertion of allies and dereliction of Britain's treaty obligations to the states, as the paramount power on the continent.<br>
<br>Glancy was equally disillusioned by the British treatment of the ruling Unionist Party in the Punjab. It had traditionally adopted a loyalist stance and had actively encouraged recruitment to the Indian army. By the time that he became governor of the province in 1941 the first cracks were appearing in the cross-communal Unionist Party as a result of the dislocations brought by the war and the Muslim League's growing campaign for Pakistan in the province, which raised tension among the non-Muslim population. Glancy shared the Unionist leaders' opposition to the Pakistan demand because of its impact on the unity of the Punjab. He encouraged the Muslim Unionist leaders, Sir Sikander Hayat-Khan (premier in 1937&#150;42) and Khizr Tiwana (premier in 1942&#150;6), in their stand against Jinnah, the Muslim League leader who was demanding Pakistan. Indeed, he stretched his constitutional powers to the limit to secure the dismissal of the minister for public works, the pro-Muslim League Shaukat Hayat, on 26 April 1944 to prevent him embarrassing the Unionist government by resigning.<br>
<br>Glancy's relations with Khizr were especially cordial and reproduced those he had earlier established with the princes. When Glancy left India in April 1946 Khizr declared: &#145;I can never adequately thank you for all your many kindnesses &hellip; I never deserved all I got.&#146; Given this relationship, it is unsurprising that Khizr discounted the possibility that the British would desert their Unionist allies. The Muslim League triumph in the rural Punjab constituencies in the 1946 provincial elections surprised both Glancy and his prime minister. The outgoing governor became embroiled in controversy amid claims by the Punjab Muslim League president, the Nawab Iftikhar Husain Khan of Mamdot (1906&#150;1969), that Glancy had denied his party the fruits of its victory by encouraging the formation of a Unionist&#150;Akali&#150;Congress coalition government. There is no evidence however that he paved the way for Khizr to resume office on 7 March 1946.<br>
<br>Glancy retired to Kenya, which held far more appeal than attempting to live off an &#145;inflation-ravaged pension&#146; in austerity Britain. He was kept informed by Khizr of developments within the Punjab. He was greatly saddened by the growing communal violence which culminated in the holocaust which accompanied the partition. He had warned his superiors of such an eventuality, but his voice had gone unheeded. He saw the rapid decision to divide and quit in 1947 as a &#145;betrayal of friends&#146; in which &#145;all values were twisted out of shape&#146;. He was appointed CSI in 1933, KCIE in 1935, and GCIE in 1946.<br>
<br>Time hung heavily on Glancy's hands during retirement: he had been so immersed in his work that he had never taken up any hobbies. He took pride in his collection of Indian coins, which were placed on display in London and New Delhi. He also began writing his memoirs. Unfortunately these remained unpublished at the time of his sudden death in Nairobi on 17 March 1953. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Sir Bertrand Glancy was the ablest administrator of his generation in the political department of the government of India. His hallmarks were industry, wisdom, charm, and a &#145;wonderful way with words&#146; which hid his lingering insecurity. Glancy retained, until the end of the raj, the paternalistic ethos of the Punjab school of administration, preferring rural allies to Indian politicians under the dominance of the Indian National Congress.<br>
