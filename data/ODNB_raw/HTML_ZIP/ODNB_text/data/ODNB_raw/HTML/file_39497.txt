<span class="headword">Ath&eacute;e,  Girard  d'</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1198&#150;<em>c.</em>1210), <span class="occ">mercenary and administrator</span>, was a native of Ath&eacute;e near Tours in north-west France. With hostile intent, the French chronicler Guillaume le Breton claims that he was of servile birth, but in all probability he was a minor knight or subtenant of the neighbouring lord of Amboise. He first appears in August 1198, at the court of Richard I, and by 1201 was serving as official for the seneschal of Poitou at Loches. In August 1202 he was appointed seneschal of the Touraine, and he is said to have led the mercenary soldiers who ravaged Tours and the surrounding region later that same year. With the collapse of Plantagenet power in northern France, and the flight of King John, Girard d'Ath&eacute;e was left behind to command the garrison at Loches, which eventually capitulated to the French in 1205 after a prolonged siege. For the next two years, he was imprisoned by the French at Compi&egrave;gne, a ransom of at least 2000 marks being paid by King John for his release at some time after May 1206. His wife and children crossed to England in September 1207, and were joined there shortly afterwards by d'Ath&eacute;e.<br>
<br>Together, d'Ath&eacute;e and his wife were granted custody of the Wiltshire manors of Aldbourne and Wanborough, confiscated from the count of Perche. In January 1208 d'Ath&eacute;e was appointed sheriff of Gloucestershire and constable of Gloucester Castle, an office to which was added custody of Bristol Castle and the vacant bishopric of Bath in March, and of the county and castle of Hereford and the lands of the earldom of Gloucester in May 1208. By September 1208 he also held some sort of custody over the county and castle of Nottingham, for which he accounted as sheriff in 1209. These appointments formed part of a wider upheaval in local government, including the promotion of mercenary soldiers to local offices and the establishment of a series of provincial treasuries, such as those controlled by d'Ath&eacute;e at Gloucester and Bristol, independent of the royal treasury at Westminster. In general, these changes reflect an increasing severity in King John's administration of England, with the adoption of methods that had formerly served as wartime expedients in Normandy, before the collapse of Plantagenet power. As one of the leading royal officials in the west country, d'Ath&eacute;e joined in the harrying of the marcher lord William (III) de Briouze, while as sheriff of Gloucestershire he earned an unsavoury reputation for his attacks upon local liberties, including his seizure of the seven hundreds of Cirencester, claimed by Cirencester Abbey. In 1212 the exiled bishop Hugh of Lincoln bequeathed 40 marks to a Nottinghamshire knight, to save his daughter from a marriage to d'Ath&eacute;e's son.<br>
<br>Girard d'Ath&eacute;e was dead by June 1215, probably before September 1210, by which time he had been replaced at Gloucester, Nottingham, Bristol, and Hereford by his fellow aliens and kinsmen, Engelard de Cigogn&eacute;, Philip Mark, and Peter and Gioni de Chanceaux. Although associated, both in France and England, with the worst excesses of mercenary warfare, he was none the less a benefactor of the religious, granting property at Tours to the city convent of St Maurice, with the assent of Lupa, his wife, and John, his son. This latter, John d'Ath&eacute;e, continued to receive a pension from the king, in lieu of land at Kingston in Surrey, until at least 1230. A nephew and namesake of Girard, Girard d'Ath&eacute;e the younger, occurs in the king's pay between 1205 and 1211, and by 1228 appears to have entered the order of the knights templar. D'Ath&eacute;e's other kinsmen and associates&#151;the various members of the families of Chanceaux, Cigogn&eacute;, Mark, and Martigny, all of them native to the villages around Ath&eacute;e&#151;were singled out for attack in clause 50 of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>, which required that they be expelled entirely from England. Their appearance here is explained by the crucial positions they occupied in June 1215 as royal constables in the midlands and west country, while the collective term <i>sequela</i> applied to them in the charter is deliberately disparaging, being generally reserved for a group of serfs, or even a brood of animals. Despite the demands of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>, Girard d'Ath&eacute;e's clan remained prominent in royal service throughout the ensuing civil war. In due course several of them were to acquire English estates in fee, while others became attached to the households of Peter des Roches, the alien bishop of Winchester, and of Richard of Cornwall, brother of Henry III and in his own right count of Poitou.<br>
