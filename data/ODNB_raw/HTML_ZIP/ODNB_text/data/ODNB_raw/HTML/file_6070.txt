</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Congreve, Sir  William</span>, second baronet  (1772&#150;1828), <span class="occ">rocket designer</span>, was born on 20 May 1772, perhaps at Homerton, Hackney, Middlesex (where he was baptized), the eldest son of Captain-Lieutenant (later Lieutenant-General Sir) William Congreve, first baronet (1743&#150;1814), Royal Artillery, and his first wife, Rebecca, daughter of Fleet Elmstone RN. The younger William attended Newcome's school, Hackney, a fashionable private school for the sons of noblemen and gentlemen, where Thomas Creevey was his fellow pupil; Wolverhampton grammar school; the Revd John Tucker's &#145;seminary for young gentlemen&#146; at Hever Court, Singlewell, near Gravesend, Kent; and Trinity College, Cambridge. Admitted to Trinity College in 1788, he matriculated in 1789 and was a scholar in 1792. He read mathematics and at the 1793 tripos was placed among the junior optimes; he graduated BA in 1793 and MA in 1796. He may also have attended the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich and, possibly, in the early 1790s, Gray's Inn, London.<br>
<br>Little is known of Congreve's early career. In 1803 he was a volunteer in the London and Westminster light horse, and was a London businessman who published a polemical newspaper, the <span class="italic">Royal Standard and Political Register</span>, which was tory, pro-government, and anti-Cobbett. Following George Cranfield Berkeley's successful libel action against it in 1804, Congreve seems to have withdrawn from publishing and applied himself to inventing. During the threat of French invasion, as a member of the Society for the Improvement of Naval Architecture, he proposed in 1804 an oar-powered, iron-armoured floating battery; but it was never constructed. He also proposed a large flotilla of mortar boats to destroy the Boulogne invasion flotilla and attack enemy ports.<br>
<br>About this time there were experiments with war rockets in several countries, notably France and Ireland. Congreve always denied that he had invented war rockets, attributing their origin to Mughal antiquity. Influenced by their use against the British in India and by the unsuccessful experiments at Woolwich of Lieutenant-General Thomas Desaguiliers (chief firemaster from 1748 to 1780), and backed by his father, who was comptroller of the royal laboratory at Woolwich from 1789 to 1814, Congreve in 1804, at his own expense, began experimenting with rockets at Woolwich. He developed rockets of different calibres and warheads. Through his father he gained official backing, and his rockets were manufactured at the Royal Arsenal there. In September 1805, at the Woolwich marshes, he demonstrated his rockets to William Pitt, the prime minister, and other ministers.<br>
<br>Congreve's father knew the prince of Wales (later the prince regent and George IV) and the duke of York and was liked by them. Congreve had approached the prince, who became his friend and patron, and a keen partisan of his rockets. Thomas Creevey wrote that &#145;Congreve &hellip; took to inventing rocketts for the more effectual destruction of mankind, for which he became patronised by the Prince of Wales&#146;  (<span class="italic">Creevey Papers</span>, 1905, 147), and Earl Grey privately alleged that &#145;the rockets were to be the great instruments of security in the new park against the mob&#146;  (Brougham, 2.59). Congreve's claim, in his dedication to George IV in his <span class="italic">Treatise on the &hellip; Congreve Rocket System</span> (1827), that &#145;the Rocket System not only owes its existence but its present state of perfection to the patronage of His Majesty&#146; was more than a courtier's sycophancy: royal favour was crucial to his career.<br>
<br>Congreve's rockets were rushed into production at Woolwich. His role was essentially in their development and manufacture, though in the early years of their production he sometimes directed their use in combat. They were first used in Sir Sidney Smith's naval attack on Boulogne in November 1805, which Congreve accompanied. With bad weather, the attack failed, and this was followed in Britain by much criticism of rockets. In 1806 Congreve replaced paper-cased by iron-cased rockets. The latter were used, directed by Congreve, in Captain E. R. Owen's attack on Boulogne in October 1806 and were considered by the British to be successful, though apparently with insufficient evidence of the damage inflicted. In September 1807 Congreve directed the successful rocket bombardment of Copenhagen. Rockets were also used elsewhere. Although the duke of Wellington continued to be unimpressed&#151;in November 1810 he wrote that he was &#145;no partisan of Congreve's rockets&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dispatches</span>, 6.591)&#151;they were used in the Peninsular War. In March 1811 Congreve was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.<br>
<br>Also in 1811 Congreve, who apparently never held a British regular commission, was commissioned lieutenant-colonel in the Hanoverian artillery&#151;an honorary rank; later he was promoted to major-general. His Hanoverian rank was resented by Royal Artillery officers, who did not consider him a professional soldier. In February 1811 he was appointed an equerry to the prince of Wales, on whose accession in 1820 he became equerry to the king. In September 1812 he visited Liverpool to become a parliamentary candidate&#151;his opponent Henry Brougham wrote that &#145;Congreve, the rocket-man, stands on the Prince's interest!&#146;  (Brougham, 2.57)&#151;but withdrew for lack of support. In October, through the prince regent's influence, Congreve was elected&#151;in fact appointed by the proprietor, the nabob Sir Mark Wood&#151;an MP for the notorious pocket borough of Gatton in Surrey. As MP he supported the tory government, opposed Roman Catholic relief, and spoke little; in 1816 he vacated the seat in favour of Wood's son. In December 1812 his father was made a baronet.<br>
<br>In October 1813 the Royal Horse Artillery &#145;rocket brigade&#146; (commanded by Captain Richard Bogue) fought with notable success at the battle of Leipzig&#151;the only British troops present. Following this, Tsar Alexander I of Russia awarded Congreve the knighthood of the order of St Anne, and belatedly in 1821 Charles XIV of Sweden awarded him the order of the Sword. Congreve claimed that he had been offered, but declined, command of the rocket corps &#145;with rank in the Regiment of Artillery&#146;  (Congreve, <span class="italic">Details of the Rocket System</span>, 9). Rockets were successfully employed in the Anglo-American War of 1812&#150;14. In 1814 Congreve joined Wellington's army in southern France. The use of rockets continued to be controversial, criticized by some officers and by writers in the press: in July 1814 the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> denounced their manufacture as &#145;tomfoolery&#146;. However, Congreve and his supporters continued to extol their achievements and potential.<br>
<br>In April 1814 Congreve succeeded his father as baronet, afterwards taking over his father's official appointments, which he held almost until his own death in 1828. He was the only head of the royal laboratory in the nineteenth century who was not a Royal Artillery officer. In 1821 he was paid &pound;360 (with housing) as comptroller of the royal laboratory and &pound;101 5<i>s</i>. as superintendent of the royal military repository. He organized the impressive firework displays in London for the peace of 1814 and for the coronation of George IV in 1821. In 1816 he accompanied Grand Duke Nicholas (later Tsar Nicholas I) on his tour of England, and in that year, according to W. A. Shaw's <span class="italic">Knights of England</span>, was made a KCH.<br>
<br>Congreve continued to experiment with rockets. In 1815 he made his most important change to their configuration, moving the guidestick from the side to the centre, so increasing accuracy. He experimented to produce a stickless, spinning rocket, but never satisfactorily solved the problem. He had developed not just war rockets but a weapon system, which he called &#145;the Congreve Rocket System&#146;, and claimed that the rocket was &#145;ammunition without ordnance &hellip; the soul of artillery without the body&#146;  (Hogg, 1.520). Rockets were envisaged as not merely supplementing, but superseding, conventional artillery, and as having immense potential for future war. He claimed that the rocket was &#145;an arm by which the whole system of military tactics is destined to be changed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Treatise</span>, 42).<br>
<br>Self-important and an avid publicist for himself and his rockets, Congreve repeatedly asserted&#151;notably in <span class="italic">The Details of the Rocket System</span> (1814) and <span class="italic">A Treatise on the &hellip; Congreve Rocket System, as Compared with Artillery</span> (1827)&#151;the advantages of rockets over conventional artillery: these included recoillessness, lightness and portability, volume and rate of fire, moral effect, and economy, with an &#145;immense saving&#146; over artillery. He asserted the rockets' &#145;most important property of universal application&#146;  (<span class="italic">Treatise</span>, 38) and, in the longer term, did not want specialized army rocket units, except for the heaviest rockets, but rather the extensive use of rockets by cavalry and infantry. He advocated massed rocket bombardment: &#145;in all cases, I lay the greatest stress upon the use of this arm in <i>great quantities</i>&#146;  (ibid., 78). He envisaged rockets of half a ton to a ton, for bombarding fortifications, and advocated naval use of rockets, supplementing but not replacing conventional ordnance, particularly for coastal bombardment and on steam vessels: &#145;the late introduction of steam navigation opens a new field for naval warfare&#151;by its combination with heavy rockets&#146;  (ibid., 21).<br>
<br>Congreve designed naval gun-mountings which were on sale to merchant vessels, but apparently not much used. He designed a lighter 24-pounder which the navy adopted and used to upgun vessels to counter the heavily armed United States warships, and a gunsight which also was adopted by the navy. In 1828 he proposed a steam-powered, iron-armoured floating battery for, if required, forcing the Dardanelles; the controller of the navy rejected it as impracticable.<br>
<br>In 1818, through the prince regent, who had an apparently strong electoral influence in Plymouth, and backed by the government, which had Admiralty influence there, Congreve, a &#145;Carlton House man&#146;, was elected an MP for Plymouth; he continued such until his death. His father had begun the royal military repository, the artillery museum collection at Woolwich. Congreve improved it and, through the prince regent, secured the erection in 1820 of John Nash's Rotunda, which still houses the Museum of Artillery and contains the best collection of Congreve rocketry.<br>
<br>Congreve lived with a mistress (formerly Creevey's) and had at least two illegitimate sons. In December 1824 he married, at Wessel, Prussia, Isabella Carvalho (or Charlotte), a young woman of Portuguese descent and widow of Henry Nisbett McEnvoy. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Called by the press the &#145;ingenious Mr. Congreve&#146;  (Winter, 28), he made various inventions&#151;including an improved process of gunpowder manufacture, a hydropneumatic canal lock and sluice, a colour-printing process, a rolling-ball clock, and a &#145;perpetual motion machine&#146;&#151;and took out at least eighteen patents. When Drury Lane Theatre in London was rebuilt after a fire in 1809, he designed its anti-fire water system. He also invented a rocket-propelled whaling harpoon, which was a commercial failure. From about 1822, following Henry Trengrouse's initiative, he experimented in adapting his war rockets to ship-to-shore lifesaving rockets, but gave this low priority and died before he could perfect the system. Others developed lifesaving rockets much more successfully, and in the nineteenth century rockets apparently saved more lives than they destroyed. Among his varied publications were <span class="italic">A Concise Account of the Origin and Progress of the Rocket System</span> (1807) and works on cash payments and currency.<br>
<br>In addition to his official appointments, Congreve had his own private rocket factory at West Ham, London, and he supplied the East India Company. In later years he was prominent in various industrial ventures, such as gas companies, which were mostly unsuccessful. He was chairman of the Equitable Loan Bank, and director of the Arigna Iron and Coal Company, the Palladium Insurance Company, and the Peruvian Mining Company. As a director of the Arigna company he was apparently involved in fraud; in 1826 the case went to court, with Congreve among those accused. Ill, he went to the south of France, beyond British jurisdiction. The case dragged on and not until May 1828, shortly before Congreve's death, did the lord chancellor rule that the transaction concerned was &#145;clearly fraudulent&#146; and was intended to profit Congreve and others. Congreve suffered from a &#145;palsy of the limbs&#146; and became paralysed in the lower part of his body. He stayed in a private hotel at 24 place Ste Scarbes, Toulouse, and died on 15 May 1828. The following day he was buried, with military honours, in the protestant and Jewish cemetery of Terre Cabade, Toulouse. In April 1835 his widow married Charles Fenton Whiting; she died on 5 November 1872. Congreve was succeeded as baronet by his son, William Augustus Congreve (<i>b</i>. 1827), who was last heard of in Sydney, Australia, in 1860 when he intended going to the Fiji islands; in 1882 he was legally presumed dead. Following his death the baronetcy became extinct.<br>
<br>Congreve rockets, though erratic and inaccurate, were used by British forces in numerous campaigns, and similar rockets were adopted by other states. In Britain Congreve rockets were declared obsolete in 1866, but Hale rockets, derived from them&#151;though overtaken and marginalized by artillery development&#151;were used in colonial campaigns to the end of the century. Congreve had &#145;created the world's first rocket weapons system&#146; and &#145;initiated the modern process of research and development in rocketry&#146;  (Winter, xiii&#150;xiv).<br>
