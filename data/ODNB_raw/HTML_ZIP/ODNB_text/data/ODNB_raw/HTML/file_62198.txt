<span class="headword">Lichfild,  Henry</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1613), <span class="occ">composer</span>, is known almost exclusively through his single published volume, <span class="italic">The First Set of Madrigals of 5 Parts, Apt for both Viols and Voices</span> (1613), and through the biographical information that may be gleaned from its dedicatory preface to Lady Cheyney of Toddington House near Luton, Bedfordshire. Jane Cheyne or Cheyney, daughter of Thomas Wentworth, first Lord Wentworth, had inherited the estate from her late husband, Henry Cheyne or Cheyney, first Baron Cheney (<i>d</i>. 1587), and Lichfild was in her service, possibly as her household steward. But she also actively encouraged Lichfild's work as a composer, carried out during &#145;some hours of the night&#146;, and his preface also reveals that his madrigals were performed &#145;by the instruments and voices&#146; of her family. Evidently Lichfild was a devoted and trusted servant, for his mistress, who died in 1614, left him &pound;20 in her will.<br>
<br>Lichfild composed his twenty madrigals exclusively in the light canzonet style naturalized into English music by Thomas Morley in the 1590s. His chosen texts were largely amorous effusions from within the pastoral tradition (whether the Daphne who figures in seven of these masked some real-life individual is unknown) and were consistently untroubled by serious or tragic issues; Lichfild made no attempt ever to mine that darker, more substantial musical vein opened principally by Thomas Weelkes and John Wilbye during the preceding fifteen years. That said, it must be conceded he handled this undemanding, anachronistic style very well; his music is highly fluent and literate, the text is always decently set, and the effect gratifying, if anonymous.<br>
