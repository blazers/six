<span class="headword">Lucas,  John</span>, first Baron Lucas of Shenfield  (1606&#150;1671), <span class="occ">royalist landowner</span>, was born on 23 October 1606, the eldest legitimate heir of Thomas Lucas (<i>c</i>.1573&#150;1625), of St John's, near Colchester in Essex, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1647), daughter of John Leighton, gentleman, of London. Lucas was a prominent supporter in Essex of Charles I, which helps to explain the episode in 1642 in which crowds, numbered in their thousands, attacked and plundered his house. This has featured prominently in accounts of popular politics in the English revolution since its inclusion in Clarendon's <span class="italic">History of the Rebellion</span>. Lucas succeeded to a prosperous landed estate in Essex in 1625. His earlier education is unknown, and although he appears not to have attended either Oxford or Cambridge his sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4940/', "Margaret, later Margaret Cavendish, duchess of Newcastle upon Tyne (1623?&#150;1673)")</script>, described him as &#145;a great scholar&#146;. As he was in France at his father's death he may have been sent abroad for part of his education. On 17 December 1628 he married Anne Nevill (<i>d</i>. 1660), daughter of Sir Christopher Nevill.<br>
<br>While the Lucas family traced their descent to the younger son of a fifteenth-century Suffolk gentry family, their fortune had been made by John's great-grandfather who as town clerk of Colchester married into the town's &eacute;lite and later purchased the estates of the dissolved abbey of St John's. This purchase simultaneously removed the family to the &#145;country&#146; seat of St John's&#151;in reality little more than a stone's throw from the walls of Colchester&#151;and bequeathed to them a series of conflicts between the abbey and Colchester that ran back to the peasants' revolt of 1381. Margaret Lucas's detailed, if eulogistic, account of the family's upbringing&#151;emphasizing the care their mother took to instil in her children the values of a culture of honour appropriate to their gentle status&#151;provides a key to Lucas's later history: the family conflicts gained an added edge from his readiness to detect a slight to his and his family's honour, and his religion provided another source of conflict with a town noted for the strength of its puritanism. The anti-Calvinist Samuel Harsnett, then bishop of Norwich, a Colcestrian and friend of the family (who had been his early patrons), had acted as his informal guardian. That Lucas was later suspected, wrongly, of popery probably reflected his patronage of ceremonialist ministers; among them was his chaplain Thomas Newcomen, who may have been Lucas's agent in ensnaring Dr John Bastwick, one of the famous puritan martyrs of the 1630s.<br>
<br>Lucas was a member of a protoroyalist group within Essex and probably played a key role in the group's attempt to win the county for the king in preparation for civil war. Although he never served as a JP, he became sheriff in 1636 and succeeded, where his predecessor had failed, in collecting the unpopular ship money tax. Success won him the public thanks of the king and doubtless helped to win him a knighthood in 1638, but it also gained him enemies in a county dominated by the parliamentarian and puritan earl of Warwick and his allies. Lucas's attempt in August 1642 to steal away from Colchester with horse and supporters to join Charles I led to the attack on his house. Although this has been represented, then and later, as an example of class hostility, the reality was more complex: Lucas had angered both the godly rulers of Colchester and the parliamentarian &eacute;lite within the county, and there is reason to suspect the involvement of the former, and at least the acceptance of the latter, in the attack.<br>
<br>After his imprisonment by the House of Commons, Lucas fled to Oxford and served as colonel of horse in the royalist army. In 1645 he secured the title of Baron Lucas of Shenfield as compensation for his sufferings, though Clarendon implied that a gift from Lucas was also involved. Despite his support for the royalist cause he was not involved in the 1648 siege of Colchester, in the aftermath of which his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17123/', "Sir Charles Lucas (1612/13&#150;1648)")</script> was executed; indeed, when the royalist army came into the county he fled to London to avoid any suspicion of involvement. Nevertheless, he was again imprisoned briefly in 1655. The Restoration brought him revenge over his enemies at Colchester, who were forced to participate in the reburial of his martyred brother in the family church of St Giles. Lucas was made a fellow of the Royal Society on 20 May 1663 but was inactive and was expelled in 1666. In 1671 the printed copy of a speech he had made in the Lords against the subsidy was ordered to be burnt by the public hangman. Lucas, it was reported, died of chagrin at this public disgrace&#151;a strange end for a man whose life had been marked by loyalty to the royal cause. He died on 2 July and was buried at St Giles, Colchester.<br>
