<span class="headword">Darby, Sir  (Henry) Clifford</span>  (1909&#150;1992), <span class="occ">geographer</span>, was born on 7 February 1909 at 3 Cross Street, Resolfen, a coalmining village in the upper Neath valley, Glamorgan, south Wales, the only child of Evan Darby, a pit mechanic and blacksmith, and his wife, Janet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thomas. His father was largely self-taught, and took education seriously, giving lantern slide lectures to men's clubs and church groups on a variety of topics.<br>
<br>Clifford travelled daily to Neath county school, 20 miles from his home. He was a bright pupil, and at sixteen he went to St Catharine's College, Cambridge, on a state scholarship. Although his original intention was to read English, he transferred to geography. Three years later he graduated with first-class honours in both parts of the geographical tripos, and was made a scholar of St Catharine's. When just eighteen Darby deputized for Frank Debenham, the professor of geography, in conducting an enquiry into pioneer settlement in Northern and Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Two substantial chapters came out of the work in 1931&#150;2. Back in Cambridge he completed his doctoral dissertation on the role of the fenland as a physical barrier between East Anglia and Mercia and as a place of refuge in times of turmoil. His supervisor was Bernard Manning, fellow and bursar of Jesus College. Manning was a lecturer in geography and an expert in medieval ecclesiastical history, and he probably stimulated the interest in the medieval world and the <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> as a geographical source which dominated Darby's subsequent professional life. At twenty-two he was awarded the first PhD in geography at Cambridge, and was appointed to a university lectureship in the geography department. A year later he became an Ehrman fellow of King's College, and then an official fellow. For such a young man to succeed so brilliantly in Cambridge immediately after the First World War was a measure of his determination, dedication, and unassuming brilliance. Darby completely reworked the fenland material as an outstanding example of the transformation of the landscape, and his work was published in two volumes, <span class="italic">The Medieval Fenland</span> and <span class="italic">The Draining of the Fens</span> (1940).<br>
<br>The intellectual problem posed by the early fenland work was one with which Darby wrestled all his professional life: how to combine successfully place and time, geography and history; in other words, how to write a historical geography rather than a geographical history. The quest to understand the practical and methodological nuances of what he frequently called &#145;the intellectual borderland between history and geography&#146; epitomized his life's work. He took the view that historical geography was the reconstruction of past human geographies and landscapes, and proselytized with a missionary zeal to establish historical geography as a self-conscious and distinctive discipline.<br>
<br>The opportunity for Darby to put his ideas into practice came with his plan for the volume <span class="italic">An Historical Geography of England before A. D. 1800</span> (1936), encouraged by his friend and mentor Sir John Clapham. It was begun when he was only twenty-four, and was an extraordinary accomplishment, both personally and intellectually, going through many reprints. Darby also began a long association with the publisher Philip, editing locational and historical atlases. <span class="italic">The University Atlas</span> (1937) went through twenty-two editions in six languages. It was followed in 1938 by a sister publication, <span class="italic">The Library Atlas</span>, which ran to fifteen editions. About 600,000 copies of the two titles were produced. Many years later, with the help of Harold Fullard of George Philip &amp; Sons, Darby edited a historical atlas to accompany the <span class="italic">New Cambridge Modern History</span>. The <span class="italic">Atlas</span> appeared as volume 14 in 1970, and was still in print some thirty years later.<br>
<br>On 26 December 1941, at the church of St Mary, Tenby, Darby married Eva Constance (<i>b</i>. 1911/12), daughter of William Thomson, a doctor of medicine. She was a scholar of Girton College, Cambridge, and one of his students. They had two daughters, Jennifer and Sarah.<br>
<br>Darby's intellectual reputation and record for meticulous and rigorous editing was recognized during the Second World War when he was first commissioned into the intelligence corps, and then, in 1941, became the civilian head of the Admiralty's geographical handbook centre in Cambridge, as editor-in-chief. Each handbook was a sophisticated regional geography (with much historical geography) of the countries concerned, liberally illustrated with maps (many drawn by Gwen Raverat), photographs, and statistical appendices. All the volumes remain excellent sources of information, and examples of synthesis and interpretation. Between 1941 and 1945 thirty volumes were produced in Cambridge by a team of about twenty-five distinguished geographers. As well as carrying out his editorial duties Darby wrote most of volumes 2 and 3 of France; Belgium; the Netherlands; volumes 1 and 2 of Germany; volume 2 of Yugoslavia; and volumes 1 and 3 of Greece. Portions of those on France, Greece, and Yugoslavia were revised after the war as parts of &#145;a short history&#146; of those countries. For his wartime service he was appointed OBE in 1946.<br>
<br>In 1945 Darby was appointed to the John Rankin chair at Liverpool University. Four years later he became professor of geography at University College, London (UCL), where he spent his most productive years and which he built into one of the major geography departments in the country. At the same time Darby became fascinated with the United States, its historical geography, and its intellectual life. He made many visits to the USA, and offers of chairs flowed in, including invitations from Berkeley and Harvard, the latter resuscitating the subject after a lapse of forty years.<br>
<br>Darby was a powerful figure at UCL but declined administrative positions, preferring to devote his time to scholarship, building up the department, and proselytizing for historical geography. He also served on three government bodies. From 1953 to 1977 he was a member of the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments (England). His knowledge of the history of the English landscape led to his appointment to the National Parks Commission in 1958, and in 1964 he joined the Water Resources Board. There his knowledge of the human impact on hydrological phenomena gained from his study of the fens, of national parks, and of Wales made him a valuable and active member.<br>
<br>Darby's foremost scholarly project was the geographical analysis of the <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> (7 vols., 1952&#150;75). In recognition of this sustained scholarly endeavour, in 1968 the British Academy elected him fellow, the first geographer so honoured. The <span class="roman">Domesday</span> work overshadowed his other innovative works on novels, agricultural regions, medieval surveys, early censuses on migration, the relationship between history and geography, the problem of geographical description, and the human fashioning of the landscape, which may have more lasting value than the Domesday project. Darby's other major publications were <span class="italic">A New Historical Geography of England</span> (1974) and <span class="italic">The Changing Fenland</span> (1983).<br>
<br>Darby was elected president of the Institute of British Geographers (1961), chairman of section E (geography) in the British Association for the Advancement of Science (1963), chairman of the British national committee for geography (1973&#150;8), and vice-president of the British Academy in 1972 and 1973. He received many honorary degrees, the Victoria medal of the Royal Geographical Society (1975), and the Daly medal of the American Geography Society. He was created CBE in 1978 and knight bachelor in 1988.<br>
<br>On 14 April 1992 Darby died at the Evelyn Hospital, Cambridge, having suffered from bronchopneumonia and Parkinson's disease. His dedication to work was puritanical; he communicated geographical ideas in print and in lectures clearly, succinctly, and unambiguously. He was a towering figure in British geography for sixty years in the mid-twentieth century and was in the first rank of scholars in the country.<br>
