<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sargant,  William Walters</span>  (1907&#150;1988), <span class="occ">psychiatrist</span>, was born at Bryanston, The Bank, Highgate Hill, Highgate, Middlesex, on 24 April 1907, the fifth child and second son in a family of eight. He was the son of Norman Thomas Carr Sargant, a devout Methodist and a wealthy metal broker who later lost his money, and his wife, Alice Rose Walters. Five of his uncles were Methodist preachers and his younger brother became bishop of Bangalore in India. Sargant lost his faith early but retained the evangelical zeal. He attended St Wilfrid's School, Seaford, and the Leys School, Cambridge, where he spent most of his time playing football. Academically he was above average but not outstanding. Sargant read medicine at St John's College, Cambridge, where he used his sporting talents to meet influential people. He became president of the Cambridge University Medical Society and kept a file called &#145;Autograph letters of eminent medical men&#146;. He won a &#145;football&#146; scholarship to St Mary's Hospital, London, where he became captain of rugby and expanded his list of distinguished acquaintances.<br>
<br>Sargant qualified MRCS and LRCP in 1930 and obtained his Cambridge MB degree in 1933; he also held various house jobs at St Mary's. At the age of only twenty-five he was appointed medical superintendent of St Mary's with &#145;complete control&#146; over admissions, beds, junior doctors, and nurses, and seemed likely to be appointed to the staff as a consultant physician, which was his ambition. To do this he needed to conduct research and publish papers, a venture which brought further success and then disaster. Sargant developed a largely spurious idea about the treatment of recalcitrant cases of pernicious anaemia and published papers recommending it in both <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> and the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> (with both of whose editors he had become friendly). His work was praised by uncritical seniors but was eventually discredited by the real experts in the field. About 1934 Sargant became depressed to the point of being mentally ill, spent time as a patient in a mental hospital, and became unacceptable as a future teaching-hospital physician. Sargant suffered from depression all his life, and treated himself with a variety of drugs.<br>
<br>In the mental hospital Sargant became angry about the state of patients with chronic mental illness who were housed in the back wards of the hospital&#151;untreated, uncared for, and ignored. He turned to psychiatry and was probably the only prominent psychiatrist in the twentieth century to express concern about the suffering of chronically mentally ill people, though he confined his interest largely to those of &#145;previously good personality&#146;; his autobiography, <span class="italic">The Unquiet Mind</span> (1967), reveals the zeal with which he set about his mission. He obtained a post at the Maudsley Hospital, London, under Edward Mapother, and devoted the rest of his life to trying to prove that psychiatry was a branch of clinical medicine, not a &#145;metaphysical&#146; exercise. Sargant was enthusiastic in using the new physical treatments in psychiatry&#151;lobotomy (leucotomy), electro-convulsive therapy (ECT), and psychoactive drugs. He always disliked and despised any form of &#145;talking cure&#146;, though he often practised psychotherapy quietly and skilfully himself. His philosophy did not include self-exploration either for himself or for his patients.<br>
<br>In 1938 Sargant was awarded a Rockefeller travelling fellowship to study in the United States. He returned to Britain at the outbreak of the Second World War, which he spent working on the outskirts of London at Sutton Emergency Hospital (later the Belmont Hospital), a centre for psychologically disturbed and injured servicemen. Here he used leucotomies, ECT, acute sedation with Pentothal and Amytal, and ether abreactions to treat patients. The clinical director, Eliot Slater, approved of Sargant's ideas and added many of his own. Together they wrote <span class="italic">An Introduction to Physical Methods of Treatment in Psychiatry</span> (1944), which became a standard textbook and ran into five editions. However &#145;the early extravagant claims for the efficacy of these methods, particularly in schizophrenia, failed to be substantiated&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 24 Sept 1988, 789). Sargant was largely unsupervised in what he did and during these years he worked out and refined the techniques of physical treatments in mental illness for which he became both famous and infamous. On 10 August 1940 Sargant married Dorothy Margaret Katz Heriot Glen (<i>b</i>. 1919/20), daughter of Heriot Riddock Glen, a company director; there were no children.<br>
<br>After the war Sargant returned to the United States and was impressed by Walter Freeman's new modified leucotomy technique. He also became deeply and permanently interested in the &#145;brainwashing techniques&#146; he saw in some of the churches in the south, which he related to the process of religious conversion. Over many years he made a series of films on the subject. These were later lodged in the Museum of Mankind in London. In 1948 Sargant was appointed consultant psychiatrist to St Thomas's Hospital, London, where he remained until his retirement, apart from a period of illness from tuberculosis. He spent his convalescence in Majorca, where he became friends with Robert Graves, who encouraged him to write his influential best-seller about brainwashing, <span class="italic">Battle for the Mind</span> (1957). Graves corrected the book and also contributed to it.<br>
<br>Determined to be a physician rather than a psychiatrist, Sargant called himself a &#145;physician in psychological medicine&#146;. He believed passionately that mental illness was a form of physical disorder and he promoted the cause of physical treatments in psychiatry. He always extolled the virtues of dramatic and often extreme treatments and denigrated psychoanalysis and psychotherapy: &#145;an ounce of phenobarbitone, or rather some modern tranquilizers, may be worth more than a hundredweight of persuasive talk&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 24 Sept 1988, 789). Much of Sargant's success may be attributed more to his therapeutic fervour and dominating personality than to his methods of treatment. He boasted that he could cure cases of schizophrenia, believed strongly in ECT and leucotomy, did everything he could to ensure that psychiatry was part of general (internal) medicine, and predicted that by the year 1990 mental illness would have ceased to exist. In 1956&#150;7 he was president of the section of psychiatry at the Royal Society of Medicine. He gave long service to the Royal Medico-Psychological Association as its registrar but was opposed to its proposed transformation into the Royal College of Psychiatrists because he wanted psychiatry to remain part of the Royal College of Physicians. However, once the establishment of the new college had become inevitable, he was eager to be its first president and was deeply disappointed when he was not elected.<br>
<br>Sargant was described as &#145;the most important figure in post-war psychiatry &hellip; huge by any standards in stature and charisma&#146;  (Munk, <span class="italic">Roll</span>). Of all twentieth-century psychiatrists he was one of the best loved and most hated. He died on 27 August 1988 at Cobley House, East Woodyates, Wiltshire, and was buried on 2 September at St Rumbold's Church, Pentridge, Salisbury. He was survived by his wife. A thanksgiving service was held at St Marylebone parish church, London, on 10 November 1988.<br>
