<span class="headword">Stewart,  Alexander Patrick</span>  (1813&#150;1883), <span class="occ">physician</span>, second son of the Revd Andrew Stewart (<i>d</i>. 1838), minister of Bolton in East Lothian, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Alexander Stewart, tenth Lord Blantyre, was born at Bolton manse on 28 August 1813. His father had graduated MD and practised as a physician before his ordination. Stewart was educated between 1826 and 1828 in the faculty of arts of the University of Glasgow and became a good Greek scholar. He travelled with his family in the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, and France from 1828 to 1830, and learned French thoroughly when he stayed in Geneva. This helped him greatly in his later research, and he wrote for the learned journal, <span class="italic">Archives G&eacute;n&eacute;rales de M&eacute;decine</span>. On his return he entered the medical faculty and graduated MD at Glasgow in 1838, afterwards making further studies at Paris and Berlin. In 1839 he settled in Mount Street, then Maddox Street, and finally in Grosvenor Street, London, and practised there until his death.<br>
<br>In January 1850 Stewart was elected assistant physician to the Middlesex Hospital, and he became physician there in February 1855, in which year he was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. His first lectures in the Middlesex Hospital were on materia medica, his later ones on medicine. Stewart was also physician to the St Pancras Royal General Dispensary. From 1853 he was an active member of the British Medical Association, and was presented for his services a sum of money in 1875, but he gave back &pound;400 to fund the Stewart prize for research on epidemic diseases. Stewart was a promoter of sanitary reform and in 1849 wrote an essay, <span class="italic">Sanitary Economics</span>, and in 1854 he submitted a paper on cholera cases in the Middlesex Hospital to the <span class="italic">Medical Times and Gazette</span>, but his title to greatness rests upon &#145;Some considerations on the nature and pathology of typhus and typhoid fever applied to the solution of the question of the identity or non-identity of the two diseases&#146;, read before the Parisian Medical Society on 16 and 23 April 1840. In Paris, Stewart came across M. Chomel, who had come to the same conclusion, that there was a clear distinction between typhus and typhoid fever. His lecture was published in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal</span>, October 1840. Stewart's experience in the post-mortem room at Glasgow Fever Hospital from the summer of 1836 to June 1838 had led him to believe firmly in the distinction between the two fevers, and in this essay he stated clearly, from his own observation of cases, their differences in origin, cause, course, symptoms, and anatomical lesions, while his remarks against the use of purgatives in typhoid fever entitle him to further distinction as one who contributed to the saving of many lives by pointing out the danger of what had been a prevalent method of treatment. Sir William Jenner's celebrated papers in 1849, 1850, and 1853 were written on the same lines as Stewart's (and it was he who received the credit), but as they were based on a far more extended field of personal observation they had more public effect, and are justly regarded as having finally settled the question.<br>
<br>Stewart was an elder in Regent Square Presbyterian Church of Scotland, where he had a successful Sunday school for young men, and afterwards in the Belgravian Presbyterian Church under the ministries of the Revd Thomas Alexander and Dr Sinclair Patterson. Stewart wrote, in 1843, <span class="italic">Divide and Conquer</span>, and numerous other pamphlets relating to the Church of Scotland. He died as a bachelor at his house, 75 Grosvenor Street, Westminster, on 17 July 1883 from cardiac dyspnoea, but he was well looked after by Dr Wilson Fox. He was buried at Highgate cemetery on 23 July. He did not attain to large practice, because of his tendency to be unpunctual. Often he would work all night and sleep in the morning, annoying those who had to wait for him. But he had so many commitments, as, for example, honorary librarian (1863 to 1868) for the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society of London, which he served as fellow for forty-one years and as its vice-president, 1871&#150;2, and also for years his mission outreach among the non-churchgoing poor of the Chelsea area.<br>
