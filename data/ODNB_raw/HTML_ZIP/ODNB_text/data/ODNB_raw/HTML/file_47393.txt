<span class="headword">Skeffington, Sir  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1590&#150;1647), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the younger son of William Skeffington (<i>d</i>. 1635) of Fisherwick, Staffordshire, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Dering) (<i>b</i>. 1567?), who came from Kent. His father, who gained a baronetcy on 8 May 1627, came from a family prominent in &#145;the great web of intermarried gentry of Warwickshire and Staffordshire&#146;  (Larminie, 74) and with branches in Leicestershire. Richard Skeffington matriculated from Magdalene College, Cambridge, in 1615, but did not take a degree. He acquired estates at Hawkesyard, Staffordshire, and at Arley near Coventry, and a house in the city itself. Knighted in 1624, he was returned as MP for the joint Warwickshire/Staffordshire seat of Tamworth the following year, apparently making no recorded mark whatever in that parliament. In 1626 he married Anne (1607&#150;1637), youngest daughter of Sir John Newdigate (1571&#150;1610) and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52768/', "Anne Newdigate (1574&#150;1618)")</script>, a liaison which confirmed and strengthened the respective positions of both families within midland society.<br>
<br>There is evidence linking Skeffington with the circles around Robert Greville, Lord Brooke, and he has been described as a puritan. He sided with the parliamentarian cause with the outbreak of civil war, while his brother, Sir John Skeffington (<i>c</i>.1589&#150;1651), who had inherited the main family estates at Fisherwick, went the other way, suffering sequestration for his allegiance. Having played little part in local government before 1642, Skeffington now emerged as a vigorous participant in the parliamentary administration of the county. One of the clique opposed to the predominance of the earl of Denbigh within the midland association, some years later, Richard Baxter praised Skeffington as one of the &#145;many very godly and judicious gentlemen&#146; in charge of the Warwickshire committee during the war  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 43&#150;4, cited in Hughes). He was a commissioner for Staffordshire and Warwickshire in respect of reform of the ministry, collection of taxes and sequestration of royalists, and was added to the Staffordshire bench after Naseby. He and Colonel John Needham, governor of Leicester, played a crucial role in securing the capitulation of Lord Loughborough's garrison at Ashby-de-la-Zouch in February 1646, mediating with parliament to secure preferential rates of composition for his lordship's party, they having been effectively driven out of Lichfield in the aftermath of a contest for command among the royalists there.<br>
<br>Later that year, after a hotly contested election in August, Skeffington was recruited as MP for Staffordshire with the support of Sir William Brereton, whose second wife was Skeffington's sister, Cicely. Brereton, who thought his brother-in-law &#145;a most precious excellent man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letter Books</span>, 2.216), had previously failed to secure him a seat at Stafford town, where he had been defeated by a single vote. The margin at the county election was not very much wider. Once at Westminster he was appointed to a committee of the House of Commons to discuss officers' indemnity, as well as the publication of the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span> Greek translation of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> in October 1646, briefly excusing himself from the service of the house shortly thereafter. He took the solemn league and covenant on 9 December, and was added to the committee of privileges a week later. He was appointed to a committee to confer with the Lords about the attempt to convey the duke of York away from the earl of Northumberland in the same month. He was added to the committee of accounts in January 1647.<br>
<br>Skeffington was denied the time or the opportunity to establish his political career on the national stage. He died on 2 June 1647 at Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, where he was buried. A memorial inscription commended in him &#145;that piety which is also peaceable&#146;  (Shaw, 1.366). His will was proved by Richard Newdigate, his brother-in-law, and Richard Pyott, two of his executors. Its overseers were Sir William Brereton, Michael Biddulph of Elmhirst, and his cousin, John Swynfen MP. The Skeffingtons had three daughters and three sons. The eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25656/', "John Skeffington (bap. 1632, d. 1695)")</script>, succeeded his cousin Sir William Skeffington as fourth baronet, and then succeeded his father-in-law as second Viscount Massarene.<br>
