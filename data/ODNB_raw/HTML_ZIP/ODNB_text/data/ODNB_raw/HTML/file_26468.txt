<span class="headword">Stewart,  David</span>, duke of Rothesay  (1378&#150;1402), <span class="occ">prince</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23714/', "Robert III (d. 1406)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8063/', "Annabella (Drummond) (d. 1401)")</script>. He is reputed to have been born on 24 October 1378, when his father was still known as John, earl of Carrick&#151;when the latter became king as Robert III in 1390, his earldom passed to David. From an early stage in his life David was forced to play an important part in royal government because of the physical and political incapacity of his father, who in 1388 had been declared incapable of running the kingdom as guardian on behalf of his aged father <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23713/', "Robert II (1316&#150;1390)")</script>, and replaced by his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26502/', "Robert Stewart, earl of Fife and Menteith")</script>. Even after Earl John succeeded to the throne Fife remained guardian. By February 1393 Fife's guardianship had been annulled, and the growing influence and activity of Carrick and his adherents possibly underlay this decision. In the years after 1390 Carrick's household was dominated by Sir James Lindsay of Crawford, his cousin David Lindsay of Glen Esk, and their kinsmen. His attachment to the Lindsays was romantic as well as political, for he had become involved in an affair with David Lindsay's sister Euphemia.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1395, however, Carrick set aside Euphemia Lindsay and married Elizabeth Dunbar, the daughter of George, earl of March. The marriage provoked political opposition inside Scotland, led by Robert III himself. The marriage was annulled in 1397, but under terms which would allow the couple to marry after a suitable period of separation. When Carrick chose another bride in 1400, the result was a major dispute with the earl of March.<br>
<br>Regardless of his marital problems Carrick assumed a more prominent role in royal government and diplomacy as the 1390s progressed. By 1397 he was established as a member of his father's council, and he acted as the king's chief representative at Anglo-Scottish march days and truce negotiations. Between 1395 and 1397, moreover, he headed a number of judicial and military expeditions into the north of the kingdom. On 28 April 1398 his growing status in the realm was reflected in his being created duke of Rothesay in a ceremony which was conducted at Scone while a general council met at nearby Perth. On the same day his uncle the earl of Fife was made duke of Albany. The two new royal dukes were immediately assigned the task of leading royal forces against Donald, lord of the Isles, that summer. During the course of the campaign, on 6 September, Rothesay received a grant of the earldom of Atholl from his father.<br>
<br>Rothesay's and Albany's leadership of the royal host in 1398 resulted from the personal incapacity of Robert III as war leader, and the Perth general council had implicitly criticized the king's failings in a number of other areas. Rothesay, on the other hand, was young, vigorous, and capable. The duke was also fast approaching the age of full legal adulthood, reaching twenty (and entering his twenty-first year) in October 1398. Continued dissatisfaction with the king's governance of the realm contributed to the growth of a political consensus which supported the creation of a royal lieutenancy for the heir to the throne. In November 1398 a meeting at Falkland, involving Rothesay, Albany, and Archibald, third earl of Douglas, seems to have cleared the way for Rothesay's appointment as royal lieutenant. A general council meeting at Perth in January 1399 removed Robert III from active power and created a three-year lieutenancy for Rothesay. His tenure of this office was hedged with qualifications which meant that he would be answerable to the three estates for his behaviour and actions as lieutenant. Furthermore, the duke was enjoined to govern with the advice of a large council of twenty-one named men, a group which included Albany and Douglas. Whether the subjection of Rothesay's office to conciliar supervision was the product of a general concern over the delegation of critical royal powers to a relatively youthful lord or a more specific response to worrying aspects of the duke's character is unclear.<br>
<br>As lieutenant Rothesay seems to have been energetic and reasonably effective. In February&#150;March 1401, for example, he held a parliament in Perth which passed a number of statutes designed to improve the exercise of criminal and civil law. But he also made a number of political mistakes. Most notably, his decision early in 1400 to marry Mary Douglas (<i>d</i>. in or before 1421), daughter of the earl of Douglas, provoked a furious response from the earl of March, father of the jilted Elizabeth Dunbar. In February 1400 March opened treasonable negotiations with the English king, Henry IV, and his disaffection was one of the factors which induced Henry to launch an invasion of southern Scotland in the summer of 1400. In late June March crossed the border to meet Henry, who was mustering his forces at York, and during his absence Archibald Douglas, son of the earl of Douglas, seized March's chief castle of Dunbar, forcing him into English service. Henry's army advanced into Scotland on 14 August, but the expedition soon ran into logistical problems and found no Scottish forces willing to take the field against it. Rothesay sat out the invasion in the safety of Edinburgh Castle, and replied to Henry's demands for homage with the offer of a combat between the noblemen of the kingdoms, to the number of 100, 200, or 300 a side, in order to limit the shedding of Christian blood. By 29 August the English army had left Scotland, having achieved nothing. One important result of the events of 1400, however, was the Douglas seizure of Dunbar and the exile of the earl of March. The cross-border Douglas&#150;March feud was to play a critical role in Rothesay's downfall in 1401. Moreover, many in Scotland, perhaps including Albany, seem to have sympathized with March's predicament.<br>
<br>The real crisis of Rothesay's lieutenancy was sparked by the young duke's behaviour during 1401. The chronicler Walter Bower saw the catalyst as the death of Rothesay's mother, Queen Annabella, in the autumn of 1401; after that, he wrote, &#145;it was as if a noose had become worn: he hoped to free himself and, spurning his council of honourable men, gave himself up to his previous frivolity&#146;. Bower reports that, unable to control Rothesay, &#145;the council of magnates assigned to him resigned to the king, observing that even if they wished, they could not divert him to a serious way of life&#146;  (Bower, 8.39). In response, Bower claims, the king wrote to Albany requiring him to arrest Rothesay and place him in custody, until &#145;after punishment by the rod of discipline, he should know himself better&#146;. Bower's account is generally sympathetic to Albany, and his presentation of Rothesay as a dissolute and indolent character seems to reflect the political viewpoint of Albany and his allies in 1401&#150;2 and was intended to justify their action against Rothesay. Bower is probably correct, however, in suggesting that the crisis was precipitated by Rothesay's rejection of the constraints of conciliar supervision and his adoption of a more aggressive and independent approach to the administration of the realm during 1401. In the exploitation of royal revenues, in particular, Rothesay appears increasingly to have bypassed established conventions and officials, arbitrarily seizing money directly from the custumars of the east coast burghs even when these men had already paid their dues to Albany as royal chamberlain. Similarly, his occupation of the temporalities of the bishopric of St Andrews, following the death of bishop Walter Trail shortly before 1 July 1401, aroused resentment.<br>
<br>Alarmed by his diminishing ability to control the activities of his nephew, Albany arranged for Rothesay's &#145;arrest&#146; on the outskirts of St Andrews by members of Rothesay's own household, Sir John Ramornie and Sir William Lindsay of Rossie, on a date late in 1401 or early in 1402. Bower's account suggests that Albany justified the arrest on two grounds, namely Rothesay's breaking of the terms of his commission of lieutenancy and the express approval and instruction of the king, although whether the action against Rothesay was sanctioned by Robert III, as Bower claims, is unclear. After Rothesay's arrest, and while the young duke was held in the episcopal castle of St Andrews, Albany met with Rothesay's brother-in-law Archibald Douglas, now fourth earl of Douglas, and secured Douglas's approval of his actions by sanctioning the breakup of the earldom of March among Douglas and his supporters and by committing himself to a more aggressive foreign policy aimed against Douglas's exiled rival March and his English backers. Following Albany's agreement with Douglas, Rothesay was transferred to Albany's own castle of Falkland.<br>
<br>After a prolonged spell as a prisoner Rothesay died in the dungeons of Falkland between 25 and 27 March 1402; he was buried in the nearby abbey of Lindores. Although it was claimed that he had died of dysentery, others suspected, perhaps correctly, that he had been starved to death. One of his most prominent supporters, his maternal uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54171/', "Sir Malcolm Drummond")</script>, lord of Mar [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54170/', "Drummond family")</script>], also died in custody under suspicious circumstances during 1402. In a general council of May 1402 Albany and Douglas received a royal indemnity for themselves and any of their men and adherents who had been involved in Rothesay's capture and imprisonment. The terms of the pardon suggest that many were directly accusing the two men of Rothesay's murder: it declared that the heir to the throne had died &#145;by divine providence and not otherwise&#146; and commanded that no one should &#145;murmur against&#146; Albany and Douglas. By the 1470s a popular cult had developed which regarded Rothesay as a saint and martyr, put to death in horrific circumstances, and his tomb at Lindores was a pilgrimage centre and the scene of miracles.<br>
<br>Rothesay's marriage to Mary Douglas produced no children. After his death Mary married Sir Walter Haliburton of Dirleton. Rothesay's younger brother, the future <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14587/', "James I")</script>, succeeded to the earldom of Carrick.<br>
