<span class="headword">McAuley <span class="st"> [McGauley]</span>,  Catherine Elizabeth</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Mary Catherine]</span>  (1778?&#150;1841), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic nun</span>, was born at Stormanstown House, Dublin, probably on 29 September 1778, though her birth year is sometimes given as 1781. She was one of three children, two girls and a boy, born to James McGauley or McAuley (<i>c</i>.1723&#150;1783) and his wife, Elinor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Conway (<i>c</i>.1753&#150;1798). Her parents belonged to the prosperous Dublin professional middle class by virtue of her father's work as an architect and builder and her mother's family involvement in the medical trades. They were both Roman Catholics, though her father seems to have been by far the more committed. At his death the three young children and their mother were left well provided for and remained in Dublin. Little is known of McAuley's education other than that it was undertaken at home and in the social and intellectual milieu of fashionable medical families. Much has been made of the children's indifference to their Catholicism after their father's death and their subsequent sojourns in protestant as well as Catholic households, but they made their first holy communion and were confirmed. Shortly after her mother's death in 1798 McAuley joined her brother and sister in the household of the protestant apothecary Armstrong, leaving there in 1803 for the home of another apothecary and physician, William Callaghan and his Quaker wife Catherine.<br>
<br>The Callaghans, who had no children, treated McAuley as their adopted daughter and for the next twenty years her life centred on them, her own extended family, and the charitable activities which she undertook among the poor in the locality of the Callaghans' estate at Coolock House in north-east Dublin. She continued to practise her faith, attending St Mary's, Liffey Street, and she became well known to a number of priests who were leading figures within Irish Catholicism, including Dean Andrew Lub&eacute;, Dr Daniel Murray, and Father Michael Blake. During this period she became involved in the contemporary debates about how best to combat poverty and was particularly concerned about the precariousness of life for young working-class women. Ideas for a lay organization appealed to her but she took no definite steps. This phase of her life ended with the deaths of Catherine Callaghan in 1819 and William in 1822, at which point she became sole heir to their considerable estate. From 1822 until her death she made use of this legacy and her independent status to put into practice some of her earlier ideas.<br>
<br>McAuley's focus was the establishment of a permanent institute for educational, religious, and social services for women and children. To this end she leased a property in Baggot Street in south-east Dublin in June 1824 and commissioned a new building. Known as the House of Mercy, the institute opened in September 1827 as a school for the education of poor girls and a residence for homeless women and girls; McAuley also adopted nine children, seven of whom were either orphaned or motherless members of her own family. She soon invited other women to work with her, particularly those &#145;who prefer a conventual life, and are prevented embracing it from the nature of property or connections&#146;  (Sullivan, 11). By 1830 there were twelve in the community and they had added visiting the sick poor to their activities. A devotional life was practised from the outset and a chapel was dedicated in the house in 1829, but McAuley's original intention was for a lay and not a religious community. In 1830, however, she and her companions experienced a change of heart and took steps to found a new religious congregation for women, beginning in September of that year with a period of formation with the Presentation Sisters in Dublin. The first members of the new congregation, the Sisters of Mercy, made their vows on 12 December 1831 and McAuley was appointed superior by Archbishop Murray. In addition to the usual vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, the Sisters of Mercy took a fourth vow: to devote themselves for life to the service of the poor, sick, and ignorant. The first chapters of the constitutions and rule were submitted to Rome in December 1833, leading to initial approval of the congregation in March 1835. Branch houses of the Sisters of Mercy were opened in McAuley's lifetime in other parts of Ireland and in England (1839), while plans were agreed for a mission to Newfoundland.<br>
<br>McAuley was one of the pioneers of the active religious life in the English-speaking world, creating a highly adaptable and stable organization which spread rapidly throughout the English-speaking world and then beyond, to Newfoundland (1842), the United States (1843), Australia (1845), Scotland (1849), New Zealand (1849), and South America (1856). McAuley died on 11 November 1841 at the House of Mercy, Baggot Street, Dublin, from pulmonary tuberculosis and an internal abscess, and was buried in the convent cemetery at Baggot Street. She was declared venerable in 1990.<br>
