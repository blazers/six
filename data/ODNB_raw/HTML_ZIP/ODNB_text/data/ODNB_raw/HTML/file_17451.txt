<span class="headword">Macdonell,  Alastair, of Glengarry</span>, Jacobite first Baron MacDonald  (<em>d.</em> 1724), <span class="occ">Jacobite army officer</span>, was the eldest son of Ranald Macdonell of Scotus or Scothouse (<i>d</i>. 1694), chief of clan Macdonnell of Glengarry, and Flora MacLeod, daughter of Alexander MacLeod of MacLeod. On the death in 1680 of his cousin Aenas Macdonell of Glengarry, Lord Macdonell and Aros, Ranald Macdonell succeeded to the estate of Glengarry and the chieftainship of the Macdonnell clan. Like his father an episcopalian and a loyal supporter of the Stuarts, Alastair Macdonell raised 300&#150;400 men during Viscount Dundee's rising in 1689 and joined Ewen Cameron of Lochiel in Lochaber. Macdonell and Lochiel were considered the leading highland supporters of the rebellion.<br>
<br>In June 1689 Macdonell refused the Williamite General Hugh Mackay's request to join the government side. At Killiecrankie on 27 July he was the first Jacobite leader to urge Dundee to attack Mackay's army, and carried the Stuart royal banner on the right of the first line amid a troop of thirty horsemen. The clan regiment served in the centre of the line. In battle the Glengarry Macdonnells lost more than sixteen men, including Donald, Alastair's son from his second marriage, to Lady Mary Mackenzie (<i>d</i>. 1726), daughter of Kenneth, third earl of Seaforth. With Mary, Macdonell had four more sons; his first marriage to Anne Fraser, daughter of Hugh, seventh Lord Lovat, also produced one daughter, Anne, who married Robert Mackenzie of Applecross.<br>
<br>On 24 August 1689 Macdonell signed the Jacobite bond of association at Blair Castle in which he promised to levy 200 men. On 3 January of the following year he was declared a rebel by the privy council, and by parliament on 14 June.<br>
<br>Despite the Jacobite defeats at Dunkeld and Cromdale, Macdonell and his father opposed other Jacobite chiefs who now sought to make accommodations with the Williamite government. The intransigence of the Glengarry Macdonnells was inspired as much by their hatred of the Campbells, including the marquess of Breadalbane, as by their loyalty to James VII. On 15 May 1691 Colonel Hill, governor of Fort William, reported that Macdonell's residence, Invergarry Castle, was being fortified with an earthwork and palisade. This show of defiance, coupled with the remoteness of Invergarry, led Sir John Dalrymple to exclude the Glengarry Macdonnells from his expedition against some of the more notorious Jacobite clans. In fact, the Macdonnells' decision to surrender on terms before 31 December 1691 eliminated any pretext to include the clan as part of the expedition, with the result that Dalrymple's forces were concentrated on the Macdonalds of Glencoe. Following the Glencoe massacre of February 1692 Macdonell was active in gathering evidence against government forces for the Scottish parliament's commission to investigate Dalrymple's actions.<br>
<br>The death of Ranald of Glengarry in 1694 gave Alastair Macdonell a free hand in running the Glengarry clan. However, his authority was in part circumscribed by the presence of a government garrison at Invergarry after 1692. None the less Glengarry was able to increase his income by cattle droving, which enabled him to purchase Knoydart about 1700. By 1703 Lord Tarbet reported that the &#145;popishly inclined&#146; Glengarry Macdonnells could muster several hundred men  (Brown, 131). On 3 August 1704 Glengarry petitioned the Scottish parliament for the removal of the garrison and for reparations. Though his petition failed, he now dropped his fanatical support of the Jacobite cause. Of all the Macdonald chiefs he alone, having allied himself with Atholl, refused to sign the engagement of 7 May 1707 in favour of the chevalier de St George (James VIII).<br>
<br>In the wake of the Hanoverian succession Glengarry followed a course similar to that of the earl of Mar. Thus, having sent a letter to the earl promising allegiance to George I, he was one of Mar's first adherents when he raised the Jacobite standard at Braemar on 27 August 1715. In September he led 500 men to reclaim Invergarry Castle from a seventeen-strong garrison. At the battle of Sheriffmuir on 13 November his clansmen held a position to the right of the flank and, following the death of Allan MacDonald of Moidart, chief of Clanranald, Glengarry rallied his wavering clansmen with a call for revenge. Inspired by Glengarry, the Clanranald regiment quickly routed the left wing of the duke of Argyll's army.<br>
<br>After Sheriffmuir Glengarry returned to Invergarry. However, he was soon a target for the newly zealous whig Simon Fraser, claimant to the chiefship of the Lovat Frasers and the title Lord Lovat. On 9 April 1716 Glengarry submitted at Inverness to the Hanoverian General Cadogan after negotiations with Robert Munro of Foulis the younger. Even so, the clan's refusal to surrender their weapons led government forces to burn down Invergarry on 24 August. As a reward for his loyalty, Glengarry was made Baron MacDonald by the Pretender on 28 September 1716 with descent limited to his heirs male. Among the Jacobite leadership, worried about retaining support after the failure of the 1715 rising, Glengarry became an exemplar of loyalty.<br>
<br>Two years later the duke of Argyll purchased MacDonald's debts, but came to an accommodation with him instead of claiming his lands. The Jacobite rising of 1719 placed him under suspicion, especially after he refused to appear when summoned for questioning. MacDonald claimed that he feared wrongful arrest and was preoccupied by concern for his dying wife (who lived for several more years). His allegiance to the Stuarts continued, despite his failure to join the rising of 1719. In the following year he was named by the Old Pretender as one of his trustees for managing affairs in Scotland. Lord MacDonald died at Invergarry on 28 October 1724, &#145;a man of profound judgment and great courage &hellip; brave, loyall and wonderfully sagacious and long-sighted&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, ed. Drummond, 255, 261).<br>
<br>MacDonald was succeeded in the chiefship and the Jacobite peerage by his son John (<i>d</i>. 1754), who married a daughter of Colin Mackenzie of Hilton. Like his father he supported the Jacobite cause and offered to raise his clan during the rising of 1745, though he refused to go out himself. Arrested in 1746 during the pacification of the highlands, he was imprisoned at Edinburgh until he successfully petitioned against illegal imprisonment in October 1749. He died on 1 September 1754 and was survived by his eldest son, Alasdair Ruadh MacDonnell, also known as Pickle the Spy.<br>
