<span class="headword">Bennett,  Peter Frederick Blaker</span>, Baron Bennett  (1880&#150;1957), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, was born on 16 April 1880 at Dartford, Kent, the eldest son of Frederick Charles Bennett, a carpenter, and his wife, Annie Eliza Blaker. When Bennett was twelve the family moved to Birmingham, where he was educated at Five Ways grammar school of the King Edward's Foundation. A convinced Christian like his father, who had been a YMCA organizing secretary, Bennett was brought up as a Methodist and was an active worker in his younger years, a Sunday school superintendent, and a teetotaller.<br>
<br>On leaving school, Bennett worked for a time with an electrical company in India. The course of his business career was set in 1903, when he joined the Electrical Ignition Company of Sparkbrook, makers of sparking plugs, trembler coils, and switches. As sales manager Bennett met the motor factor Albert Thomson in 1905 and in 1907, with Thomson's backing, set up Thomson-Bennett Ltd to manufacture products similar to those of the Sparkbrook firm. The new business began on a small scale, as Bennett described it in <span class="italic">British Industries</span>, &#145;four white-washed walls, my signature and the little money I had scraped together&#146;  (Bennett, 143&#150;4). Thomson-Bennett began making magnetos, but only for specialized purposes as a result of the virtual monopoly on the car magneto maintained by the German Bosch company.<br>
<br>The outbreak of the First World War underlined the seriousness of this dependence on German supplies and British manufacturers such as Joseph Lucas, British Thomson-Houston (BT-H), and Morris and Lister, eventually under Admiralty control, endeavoured to develop magnetos and to rationalize and expand production. (The Admiralty's concern was for aero-engine magnetos for the Royal Naval Air Service.) It was in this context that Bennett's business skills found the environment in which to expand and mature, when his company was taken over by the older and much larger Joseph Lucas Ltd in the early months of the war. The latter, founded in 1875, employed about four thousand in 1914, in comparison with the Thomson-Bennett workforce of about a hundred. Harry Lucas had seen the need for British-made magnetos, vital to the development of mechanized armed services, and for this reason he acquired Bennett's small firm with its specialist production.<br>
<br>Bennett's wartime role was on the home front, where he was appointed chairman of the two bodies set up to co-ordinate magneto producers, the Aero Magneto Manufacturers' Association and the British Ignition Apparatus Association. Bennett was remembered by A. P. Young of BT-H as &#145;a humble and kindly man with a keen business brain&#146;, with whom &#145;right from the start we established a friendly relationship&#146;  (Young). Within the Lucas concern Thomson-Bennett was run as a separate business under Bennett as managing director.<br>
<br>In the early post-war years the Lucas board suffered internal disputes, which opened the way for Bennett to join Harry Lucas in 1920 as one of two managing directors. In the following year Oliver Lucas was made a director and he and Bennett became joint managing directors in 1923. Oliver, born in 1891, had been educated at King Edward's School and had then gone into the family firm, where his skill as a motorist proved of considerable practical use. His war service resulted in the development of the &#145;OL&#146; signalling lamp for the army. Despite the eleven-year difference in age, the partnership of Bennett and Oliver Lucas was crucial for the inter-war growth of Joseph Lucas and the development of Bennett as a leading entrepreneur in the motor component industry, although his qualities and capabilities would have brought him to prominence whatever the external circumstances of his career.<br>
<br>The Bennett&#150;Lucas partnership from the early twenties was described by Nockolds as one of the most remarkable the motor industry has ever seen. Oliver Lucas brought to it his technical skill and good commercial judgement, while Bennett's significant contribution lay not in his early technical experience, but in the strength of his main interest, the expansion of the company. Though the two differed widely in their personal interests and beliefs, within the company the outstanding feature of their partnership was their unanimity in business decisions. As Bennett expanded his public life and Oliver Lucas immersed himself in the technical details of engineering development, their partnership was increasingly supported by Bertram Waring as company secretary.<br>
<br>Bennett came to play a major role in public life in Birmingham and on the national scene. He was a member of the British delegation to Ottawa in 1932, president of the Birmingham chamber of commerce, 1932&#150;3, of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, 1935&#150;6, and of the Federation of British Industries during the crucial period 1938&#150;40, which included the 1939 negotiations with the German Reichsgruppe Industrie. In 1940 Bennett succeeded Neville Chamberlain as Unionist member for Edgbaston. Rearmament and war brought numerous official appointments, such as membership of the panel of industrial advisers to the Ministry of Supply, 1938&#150;9, and the chair of the Automatic Gun Board, 1941&#150;4. The war also proved the long-term value of the decision of Bennett and Oliver Lucas to set up CAV-Bosch in 1931, without which a deficiency in supplies of fuel-injection equipment might well have paralleled that in magnetos in the First World War.<br>
<br>In the house Bennett commanded respect by his moderation and modesty, speaking only on what he knew, in a quiet and persuasive manner. This was especially important during his term of office as parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Labour and National Service, 1951&#150;2. Bennett resigned on health grounds in 1952, rejoining Lucas as joint managing director with Waring in August of that year. His great partner in business, Oliver Lucas, had died, from overwork, four years earlier, prompting Bennett's comment that he had lost his lifelong friend and colleague.<br>
<br>Bennett was a generous public benefactor, donating &pound;10,000 to the Birmingham Children's Hospital in 1936 and the same amount to Lucas employees' hard luck fund two years later. He was knighted in 1941 and raised to the peerage in 1953. He married Agnes, daughter of Joseph Palmer, in 1905; there were no children of the marriage. Bennett's wife had a distinguished record of social service and she provided guidance and encouragement throughout his career. For recreation Bennett turned to sport, rugby giving place to golf and tennis, and he was an enthusiastic walker. He remained with Lucas until his death at his home, Ardencote, 18 Luttrell Road, Four Oaks, Warwickshire, on 27 September 1957. Great figures of industry, especially the motor industry, attended his funeral on 2 October (the Rootes brothers, Sir Leonard Lord, and Sydney Guy) and his memorial service, at which the Federation of British Industries (Sir Norman Kipping), Jaguar Cars (Sir William Lyons), ICI, the Dunlop Rubber Company, the Standard Motor Company, and Vauxhall Motors were represented.<br>
