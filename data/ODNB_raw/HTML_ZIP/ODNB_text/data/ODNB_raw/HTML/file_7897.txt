<span class="headword">Douglas,  James</span>, second duke of Queensberry and first duke of Dover  (1662&#150;1711), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Sanquhar Castle, Dumfriesshire, on 18 December 1662, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7936/', "William Douglas, third earl and first duke of Queensberry (1637&#150;1695)")</script>, and Lady Isabel Douglas (<i>d</i>. 1691), sixth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7934/', "William Douglas, first marquess of Douglas")</script>. He entered his studies at Glasgow University in 1676 and thereafter travelled in continental Europe, returning in 1684. On 1 December 1685, aged nearly twenty-three, he married Lady Mary Boyle (1670/71&#150;1709), second daughter of Charles Boyle, styled Viscount Dungarvan, and Jane Seymour, daughter of William, duke of Somerset; the marriage produced four sons and five daughters. His title was lord and then earl of Drumlanrig, before he succeeded his father in March 1695.<h2>
<a name="Earlypoliticalcareer"></a>Early political career</h2>Drumlanrig appears to have first entered the political scene in February 1684, when he was named by the privy council as one of the commissioners for the borders, and on 15 July 1684 he was sworn of the new privy council. On the same day he was appointed to the privy council's committee for public affairs, and he was also made a lieutenant-colonel of the regiment of John Graham of Claverhouse. On 1 August Drumlanrig's troop of horse was ordered to lie at Dumfries as part of the privy council's policy of suppressing conventicles. He was issued with a licence from the privy council on 12 August for importing English cloth to clothe his troop. Following a petition by the partners of Newmilns cloth manufactory against the imports, on 19 August the privy council set up a committee on which Drumlanrig sat to consider the claim that these partners were capable of providing Scottish cloth. The privy council received a letter from Charles II on 6 September ordering members of the council to &#145;proceed to the disaffected shires with the object of securing obedience to the laws&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 8.155&#150;6). In line with the king's instructions, Drumlanrig and John Graham of Claverhouse (later first Viscount Dundee) were to be sent to Dumfriesshire and Wigtownshire. On 13 September Drumlanrig's troop of horse and Captain Strachan's dragoons were ordered by the council to proceed to Dumfries to attend the district commissioners appointed as part of the policy of the suppression of religious disorders in the western shires. On 15 November five rebels and fugitives subscribed the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> in the presence of Drumlanrig at Sanquhar Castle, and on 5 December he was appointed to a privy council committee to consider the cases of gentlemen and their wives in Teviotdale who were fined for their &#145;irregularities&#146;  (ibid., 10.47). The activities of Drumlanrig and Graham of Claverhouse in the south-western shires were applauded by the privy council on 12 December, and they were given &#145;hearty thanks for ther so good and acceptable service done to the King on this occasione&#146;  (ibid., 10.58). In 1685 Drumlanrig was appointed as a member of the new privy council on 9 April. His father was summoned to court in 1685, and on 7 August the privy council allowed Drumlanrig to accompany him. On 12 August a precept for &pound;500 sterling was issued to cover Drumlanrig's expenses at court. He was appointed to the privy council in 1686 and 1687, though he attended only once, on 30 March 1686. With the escalating tension in the reign of James VII and II, a commission to Drumlanrig as a lieutenant-colonel of horse was issued from Whitehall on 19 September 1688. Nine days later, on 27 September, orders were sent from Whitehall to the Scottish privy council ordering troops to march into England and magazines to be removed from Edinburgh Castle to Stirling Castle. Acting on the king's orders, John Drummond, first earl of Melfort, was to instruct Drumlanrig to go to his command in Scotland.<h2>
<a name="ServantofKingWilliam"></a>Servant of King William</h2>Drumlanrig was present at the privy council meeting of 1 October 1688, but he was shortly to change his allegiance to William of Orange, following his landing in England. Along with Prince George and the duke of Ormond, Drumlanrig joined Prince William at Sherborne, Dorset, on 30 November 1688. Drumlanrig's shift in allegiance away from James to William was scathingly commented on later by the Jacobite George Lockhart of Carnwath. According to Lockhart, Drumlanrig was &#145;the first Scotsman that deserted over to the Prince of Orange, and from thence acquired the epithet (among honest men) of Proto-rebel, and has ever since been so faithful to the revolution party, and averse to the king and all his advisers, that he laid hold on all occasions to oppress the royal party and interest&#146;  (<span class="italic">&#145;Scotland's Ruine&#146;</span>, 11). Drumlanrig did not attend the convention of estates (1689), nor was he present in the parliamentary sessions of 1689&#150;90 which enacted the revolution settlement in Scotland. A commission for William's privy council was issued from Hampton Court on 27 May 1689. Drumlanrig was included on the king's council, and he attended the diets of 6 and 17 July 1689. That he had found favour with William was further reflected in his appointment as one of the gentlemen of the bedchamber and his appointment as colonel of the sixth or Scottish troop of Horse Guards.<br>
<br>In April 1690 Drumlanrig wrote to William Carstares seeking the position of extraordinary lord of session, an office which had been held by his father before the revolution. However, he failed to secure this position, which was later bestowed on his father on 23 November 1692. Drumlanrig served William's military cause against his former associate, now Viscount Dundee, in the first Jacobite rising. Drumlanrig was also a member of the 1690 privy council and, from 16 April, of a specialized committee dealing with artillery. Later, in September 1690, he was sent to Stirling with government forces for the potential defence of the town, and was instructed by the privy council to be ready to attack enemy forces should they proceed towards Dumbarton to the west or Perthshire to the east. Drumlanrig was present at the extraordinary meeting of the privy council on 4 November 1691 which issued a proclamation celebrating William's safe return from Ireland following his military success there. Having been appointed as a Treasury commissioner on 3 March 1692, he made his first formal appearance in the Scottish parliament in the fourth session of the parliament of William and Mary, which sat from 18 April to 15 June. George, first earl of Melville, the parliament's high commissioner, produced a letter from William authorizing Drumlanrig to sit and vote as lord high treasurer. Drumlanrig took his place in the 1693 parliamentary session as an officer of state. In accordance with current parliamentary legislation, he took the oath of allegiance, the parliamentary oath, and he signed the assurance.<br>
<br>On 28 March 1695 Drumlanrig succeeded to the dukedom following the death of his father, and thereafter attended that year's parliamentary session (9 May to 17 July). On 25 May 1696 he was appointed as lord privy seal, and on 26 June he took his seat as an extraordinary lord of session. In the next parliamentary session (7 September to 12 October 1696) Queensberry was present in the capacity of an officer of state as lord privy seal, and on 10 September he signed the association directed against Jacobite conspiracy towards King William, which also acknowledged the king as the rightful and lawful monarch. On 25 September he was named as one of the commissioners of supply for Dumfriesshire. Queensberry also attended the parliamentary session of 19 July to 1 September 1698 as lord privy seal. He was reappointed as a commissioner of supply for Dumfriesshire on 30 July, and on 31 August parliament passed legislation which ratified his earldom and regality of Drumlanrig. His general political and specific parliamentary profile was raised by the Darien disaster in 1699. Owing to public outcry William was reluctantly forced to summon a parliament in Scotland, and Queensberry was appointed as high commissioner to the parliamentary session which met from 21 to 30 May. He also served as high commissioner in the remaining sessions of the Williamite parliament (29 October 1700 to 1 February 1701 and 9 to 30 June 1702, the latter sitting under Queen Anne's authority after William's death). Queensberry's political credit was significantly enhanced by his successful political handling and containment of the Darien crisis in Scotland on William's behalf. As a reward for these services, Queensberry was made a knight of the Garter on 18 June 1701. He maintained his important political profile with the accession of Queen Anne, not only being retained as high commissioner to parliament, but also being appointed as one of the secretaries of state for Scotland, along with George Mackenzie, first earl of Cromarty. The 1702 session fulfilled the last wish of William III and met with the first request of Queen Anne by empowering the crown to appoint commissioners to treat for a union of the kingdoms. However, Queensberry had to bring the session to a sudden end on 30 June.<h2>
<a name="Movestounionandpersonalcrisis"></a>Moves to union, and personal crisis</h2>Queensberry played an important role in the abortive negotiations of 27 October 1702 to 3 February 1703 for a treaty of union with England. As the spokesman for the Scottish commissioners, on 10 November he made a speech in which he spoke of the union as &#145;highly advantageous for the peace and wealth of both Kingdoms and a great security for the Protestant Religion everywhere&#146;; he also stressed the &#145;sincere intentions&#146; of the Scottish commissioners to &#145;advance this great design&#146;  (<span class="italic">APS</span>, <i>1670&#150;1707</i>, 11, appendix, 148). Queensberry was appointed as high commissioner to the 1703 parliamentary session, which met from 6 May to 16 September and was the first session of a newly elected parliament which met over four sessions between 1703 and 1707. On 1 July the earl of Seafield wrote to Sidney, first earl of Godolphin, informing him that he and Queensberry had worked together in parliament concerning the disputed elections of the commissioners of the shires for Orkney. Seafield and Queensberry had therefore used their influence to secure &#145;the electione by a great majority&#146; of those &#145;very well inclined&#146; for the queen's service  (<span class="italic">Letters Relating to Scotland</span>, 2). Nevertheless, in the face of aggressive constitutional nationalism in the 1703 session and the possibility that Scotland and England might have different monarchs in the future, Queensberry prorogued the session on 16 September.<br>
<br>Soon after, the duke's political fortunes suffered a severe setback with the exposure of the &#145;Scotch&#146; or &#145;Queensberry plot&#146;. Queensberry was discredited by his involvement with Simon Fraser, later Lord Lovat, a political charlatan closely associated with the exiled Jacobite court, who had returned to Scotland in summer 1703 (as a result of a government indemnity allowing Jacobite exiles to return to Scotland) ostensibly to co-ordinate a Jacobite rising. Fraser was driven by personal ambition to secure the restitution of his estates, following their earlier confiscation and his being declared an outlaw for the rape of, and forced marriage to, the daughter of the marquess of Atholl (she was the widow of the previous chieftain of the Frasers) in his drive to secure the Lovat title and chieftainship of the Frasers. The unreliable Fraser turned Jacobite informer and sought Queensberry's protection in an attempt to secure these personal objectives. Fraser implicated some of Queensberry's main Scottish political rivals in the Jacobite plot, especially John Murray, second marquess and first duke of Atholl. Without exploring the details of the plot in full, Queensberry secretly passed on the information to the queen, and provided Fraser with a feigned name and pass to go to France and report on Jacobite activity. However, the conspiracy was exposed when Fraser unwittingly passed on the details to one Robert Ferguson, who then warned Atholl and others of their implication in the supposed plot. Lockhart of Carnwath later argued that Queensberry and his associates deliberately &#145;resolved one way or other to frame such a plot, as, when lodged upon those they designed it against, should, in all humane probability, be their utter ruin and destruction&#146;  (<span class="italic">&#145;Scotland's Ruine&#146;</span>, 49). Queensberry's subsequent fall from favour was accelerated by two key events. Firstly, following a memorial presented to the queen by Atholl, exposing the conspiracy against him, the House of Lords resolved that there had been a dangerous conspiracy in Scotland in favour of the Pretender (James Stuart). Secondly, a deputation from Scotland, consisting of politicians from the country party who were shortly to become part of what was known as the &#145;new party&#146;, arrived in London to protest at Queensberry's behaviour. Queensberry was replaced as high commissioner to the 1704 parliamentary session by John Hay, second marquess of Tweeddale, and the &#145;new party&#146; was installed in power.<h2>
<a name="RevivaloffortunesandtheUnion"></a>Revival of fortunes and the Union</h2>Yet Queensberry's power base in Scotland was too strong to be ignored, and the demands of the escalating crisis in Anglo-Scottish relations resulted in his rehabilitation in 1705 when he was reappointed as lord privy seal and made a lord of the Treasury. John Campbell, second duke of Argyll, was appointed as high commissioner to the parliamentary session which met from 28 June to 18 September 1705. Queensberry attended in the capacity of lord privy seal, but Lockhart of Carnwath argued that Argyll operated in liaison with Queensberry. Indeed, Lockhart claimed that Queensberry &#145;used him as the monkey did the cat in pulling out the hot roasted chestnuts&#146;  (<span class="italic">&#145;Scotland's Ruine&#146;</span>, 85). It is clear, however, that lobbying took place for the rehabilitation of Queensberry, within the court interest in general and in the run-up to the 1705 parliamentary session in particular. Accordingly, David Boyle, first earl of Glasgow, wrote to the earl of Godolphin on 12 May, informing him that &#145;It is my opinion that the only means and way to setle the succesion is that the Duke of Queensberrie come down to Scotland as soon as possible and cordially assist my Lord Duke of Argyll, her Majesties Commissioner&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters relating to Scotland</span>, 179). In response to the outrage among Scottish politicians caused by the English <span class="roman">Alien Act</span>, Queensberry introduced a motion in the 1705 session that a separate address should be made to Queen Anne informing her of the indignation of the nation at the interference of the House of Lords in Scottish affairs. Queensberry's motion was successfully carried, and his personal anger at the Lords may have been related to its stance over and interference in the recent &#145;Scotch plot&#146;. Of greater importance is the fact that Argyll and Queensberry collaborated to ensure that James Douglas, fourth duke of Hamilton, was not nominated to the 1705 council of trade. Chancellor Seafield informed Godolphin of this in a letter from Edinburgh on 18 August 1705. Hamilton was not to be nominated, despite his own intense personal lobbying, because of his leading role in ensuring that the council of trade was to be elected by the parliament and not nominated by the queen. Accordingly, Argyll and Queensberry were &#145;positive not to have him named, nor any that voted against the Queens nominatione&#146;  (ibid., 71).<br>
<br>Queensberry was one of the Scottish commissioners who negotiated the treaty of union with their English counterparts in the summer of 1706, but, unlike the 1702&#150;3 negotiations, Chancellor Seafield, and not Queensberry, was their spokesman. As high commissioner, Queensberry played a crucial role in the last session of the Scottish parliament, sitting from 3 October 1706 to 25 March 1707, which ratified the treaty of union. Instructions issued to Queensberry from Anne at Windsor on 31 July stressed that &#145;an entire Union&#146; was the only acceptable political option for &#145;the Peace and happiness of our Subjects of this Island&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters relating to Scotland</span>, 190&#150;91). Thus Queensberry was instructed to endeavour to obtain the ratification of the articles of the treaty in the forthcoming session of the Scottish parliament. Moreover, he was clearly informed that if &#145;a Federal Union or any other measure in opposition to an entire Union will carry in Parliament&#146; then he was &#145;in that case to adjourn the Parliament&#146;  (ibid., 191).<br>
<br>Queensberry was also empowered to give the royal assent to any parliamentary legislation for the security of the presbyterian Church of Scotland for the post-Union future, as well as being instructed that the Scottish parliament was to decide on the manner of choosing the sixteen elective peers for the House of Lords and the forty-five MPs as the Scottish representation for the new British parliament. He was in correspondence with Godolphin prior to the opening of the parliamentary session on 3 October, and during the actual progress of the session. In a letter of 22 September John Erskine, twenty-second earl of Mar, secretary of state, wrote to Godolphin from Edinburgh and informed him that Queensberry and the court interest were currently considering &#145;what are the most advisable methods and measurs for manadging and cairying on business when the Parl. Meets&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters Relating to Scotland</span>, 176). Popular disquiet at the Union meant that Queensberry was subjected to verbal abuse by the Edinburgh mob, suffered an attack on his coach, and saw his guards and servants wounded on a regular basis. Despite these external pressures, Queensberry played a crucial part in steering the treaty through the house, and he had a key role in the covert distribution of the &pound;20,000 sterling sent north to pay the debts and arrears due to government servants. He worked closely with Chancellor Seafield and the Scottish treasurer, David Boyle, first earl of Glasgow, along these lines. On 4 October Glasgow wrote to Godolphin informing him that he had been ordered by Queensberry to acquaint Godolphin that:<blockquote>you would be pleased to remitt the s<sup>d</sup> money to Scotland so soon as possible, in regard that many of our nobility who are come to Parliament, that want their bygone pensiones, are calling for some money, and it is for her Maties service that they have a part at this juncture. (ibid., 182&#150;3)</blockquote>Ironically, Queensberry received the bulk of this money with a payment of &pound;12,325, though he actually had recorded arrears of &pound;26,756 9<i>s</i>. &frac12;<i>d</i>.<h2>
<a name="Britishpolitician"></a>British politician</h2>As a reward for his services to the queen and securing the treaty in Scotland, Queensberry was rewarded with a British peerage. On 26 May 1708 he was created duke of Dover, marquess of Beverley, and earl of Ripon, with remainder to his third son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7877/', "Charles Douglas, earl of Solway")</script>, who was later to succeed him as third duke of Queensberry. Queensberry's post-1707 political career was consolidated by his appointment as joint keeper of the privy seal, and on 9 February 1709 he was appointed as third secretary of state. This latter appointment gave Queensberry a continued significant influence in the management of Scottish affairs. Yet his position as a British peer aroused controversy during the general election of 1708, in the context of the election of the sixteen Scottish peers to be represented in the new British parliament. His vote was protested against at the general election of the Scottish peers on 17 June 1708. This resulted in a more general resolution issued by the House of Lords on 17 January 1709. Accordingly, the Lords resolved that a peer in Scotland, who chose to sit in the House of Lords by virtue of a patent under the great seal of Britain, was to have no voting rights in the election of the Scottish representative peers. Nevertheless, it would appear that the Queensberry interest secured a strong profile in the 1708 election. One Alexander Rigby, writing from Edinburgh on 19 June 1708, stated that prior to the election nine of the sixteen elected peers were &#145;supposed to be for D. Queensberrys party&#146;, and that &#145;the D. of Dover and his friends have the greatest stroak in the Kn<sup>ts</sup> of the Shires and in the burroughs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters Relating to Scotland</span>, 185&#150;6). As secretary of state, in January 1711 Queensberry was in correspondence with the Board of Trade and Plantations concerning the reopening of trade to ports in Livonia and Ingria.<br>
<br>Queensberry died in London on 6 July 1711, just under two years after his wife's death in October 1709. He was buried at Durisdeer, near Drumlanrig, Dumfriesshire. He is remembered as one of the Scottish statesmen and politicians who were responsible for securing the safe passage of the treaty of union through the Scottish parliament. In an essay written in 1703 on the &#145;character of families&#146;, Lord Cromarty stated that Queensberry was &#145;in estate as great as any mentioned, and considerable in his following; but the more by his being now the most considerable family of Douglass, who ever were the most eminent family and most active in Scotland, or perhaps elsewhere&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters Relating to Scotland</span>, 130).<br>
