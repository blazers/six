<span class="headword">John the Chanter</span> <span class="st"> [Johannes Cantor; <em>nicknamed </em>Planeta]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1191), <span class="occ">bishop of Exeter</span>, is of uncertain identity. One contemporary, Ralph de Diceto, identifies him as a former <i>cantor</i> (precentor) of Exeter; and George Oliver believed that he had held that office for thirty years before his promotion to the bishopric. Another contemporary, Roger of Howden (followed by Oliver) describes him as subdean of Salisbury. Both dignitaries existed, and it may be a case of pluralism. It is also possible that John was a nephew or chaplain (or perhaps both) of Robert of Chichester, bishop of Exeter, who accompanied his uncle to Exeter in 1155 together with other relatives and clients. One, if not both, of John's own nephews, whom he promoted in due course in his cathedral church, was surnamed Basset; and it could be that John was related to that landed family through a sister. Even more perplexing is the problem whether the Salisbury&#150;Exeter John was also Thomas Becket's clerk of that name. If so, he may well have been a pupil of Abelard at Paris about 1136, who had also studied at Montpellier, but is not included in Herbert of Bosham's list of Thomas's <i>eruditi</i>, the twenty-two scholars at his court. This John was a companion of the future martyr in exile and his indefatigable ambassador at the papal court, a friend who missed the martyrdom only by his absence on a mission; and one of the few who subsequently also served Thomas's successor at Canterbury, Richard of Dover. He could have returned to Exeter about the time of Richard's death (16 February 1184). He was very much a wandering star, hence the nickname Planeta sometimes bestowed on him.<br>
<br>After Bishop Bartholomew's death in mid-December 1184 there was a vacancy of almost two years at Exeter, for John was not consecrated until 5 October 1186. The delay may have been caused in part by Henry II's absence in Normandy from April 1185 to April 1186, in part by disagreement over the succession. If John had been Thomas Becket's clerk that would have made him suspect to the king and to some others. It is unlikely that he was the choice of King Henry, who is more likely to have favoured the candidacy of his own clerk, Godfrey de Lucy, who was elected to the see on 1 July 1186 but declined it. Once installed, John acted very much like a new broom at Exeter. His closest helpers among the cathedral canons were not his predecessor's men, and he seems to have been the first bishop of Exeter to make use of the newfangled episcopal administrative, perhaps primarily judicial, deputy, an &#145;official (principal)&#146;. Yet all parties may have been anxious for a quiet life after the turmoil of the Becket era. John was elderly when elected, and a possible lack of legal expertise may have disqualified him from acting as a papal judge-delegate. After attending Richard I's coronation on 3 September 1189 and witnessing the preparations for the third crusade, he returned to Exeter to enjoy his position. But the last eighteen months of his life may not have been tranquil. Richard had made unsatisfactory arrangements for the government of England and Normandy during his absence on a military adventure from which he might not return. He endowed his youngest brother, John, count of Mortain, with vast estates in England, including the counties of Devon and Cornwall (albeit without the castles of Exeter and Launceston) but made him promise to stay out of the kingdom for three years. In the winter of 1190&#150;91 John broke his promise; and although he operated in the midlands, there must have been unease also in the south-west.<br>
<br>John the Chanter died on 1 June 1191, seven months after the death of Archbishop Baldwin at Acre and one week before King Richard's arrival there. He was buried under the south tower of his cathedral. The see of Exeter then remained vacant until February 1194. John the Chanter enriched the cathedral treasury with a cope of baldechin, ornamented with small double-headed eagles, and, according to John Hooker, he &#145;was very well reported for his forwardness and liberalitie in continueng the newe inlarginge and buildinge of his Churche&#146;  (Hooker, 228).<br>
