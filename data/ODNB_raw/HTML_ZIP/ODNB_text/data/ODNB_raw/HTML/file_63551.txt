<span class="headword">Amir Chand <span class="st"> [Omichund, Umichund]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 1758), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was a major trading partner of the British in Bengal and deeply involved in the events that gave them political power there. Very little is known about his origins. He appears to have been a Nanakpanthi Sikh who came to Bengal early in the eighteenth century from Agra in north India with his brother Deep Chand, to seek his fortune. Both men prospered. Amir Chand seems to have begun business under a great Calcutta merchant, Bostom Das Sett, who supplied the East India Company with cotton cloth. By the 1730s Amir Chand had himself become the leading supplier of the company, undertaking to procure up to one-third of what they required to ship to Britain in any one year. He lived in Calcutta in great state, owning a number of houses and employing a huge retinue. He was described as &#145;the most opulent inhabitant of the colony&#146;, whose way of life &#145;resembled more the state of a prince than the condition of a merchant&#146;  (Orme, 2, pt 1, 50). As well as trading with the British, Amir Chand dealt with the nawabs, the rulers of Bengal, from whom he received grants to control certain trades in return for his services. He and his brother were particularly concerned with the province of Bihar, where they dominated the trade in saltpetre and opium.<br>
<br>In 1756 Bengal was thrown into crisis when the British provoked the nawabs to attack and take their settlement of Calcutta. Amir Chand had to make hard choices between the two sources of his wealth and influence and he played his cards badly. The British governor believed that he was at first siding with the nawab and confined him for a time. In 1757 the British under Robert Clive recaptured Calcutta and Amir Chand successfully sought a reconciliation. He is described as &#145;going up and embracing each member of the Council among whom Colonel Clive was sitting&#146;  (Sinha, 1.244). He involved himself in the plots to overthrow the nawab which followed the British recovery of Calcutta, backing a candidate who appeared to have far less chance than the one whom the British eventually chose to support. Nevertheless, he did his best to exploit the situation and to gain a huge reward for himself. He insisted that any agreement with the future nawab should contain clauses guaranteeing him 5 per cent of the Bengal nawabs' accumulated treasure and a quarter of their jewels. Since British estimates of the treasure put it at some &pound;40 million, this meant that he was claiming at least &pound;2 million. Clive had no intention of giving him what he wanted, but believed that he had kept in communication with the reigning nawab and might betray the conspiracy to him prematurely. He and his colleagues therefore decided to trick Amir Chand. A false treaty was drawn up to be shown to Amir Chand which included a generous provision for him. Because the British admiral Charles Watson, whose signature was essential, had scruples about this piece of skulduggery, his name was added by somebody else. After the British victory at Plassey, in a scene immortalized in Macaulay's essay &#145;Lord Clive&#146;,<blockquote>Clive then turned to Mr Scrafton one of the servants of the Company, and said in English, &#145;It is now time to undeceive Omichund.&#146; &#145;Omichund&#146;, said Mr Scrafton in Hindostanee, &#145;the red treaty is a trick. You are to have nothing.&#146; Omichund fell back insensible into the arms of his attendants. He revived; but his mind was irreparably ruined.</blockquote>Whatever the truth of the rest of the story, there is no evidence that disappointment drove Amir Chand insane. He continued to do business with the company for the short remainder of his life. He died in December 1758, apparently away from Calcutta, leaving a fortune estimated at some &pound;450,000, the bulk of which, presumably since he died without issue, was bequeathed to a Sikh shrine. Much of his wealth was used up in litigation brought by his brother-in-law Huzuri Mal, who contested the management of the estate.<br>
