<span class="headword">Hoar,  Leonard</span>  (1630&#150;1675), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was the son of Charles Hoare (<i>d</i>. 1638), a brewer, alderman, and sheriff in Gloucester, and Joanna Hinksman (<i>d</i>. 1664). His father's will provided for Leonard to matriculate at Oxford, but following the elder Hoare's death in 1638 and the deprivation of the Revd John Workman, whose ministry the Hoares had followed, Joanna and her children migrated to New England, settling in Braintree, Massachusetts. Hoar thus attended Harvard College rather than Oxford, receiving his AB in 1650 and his MA three years later.<br>
<br>Like many Harvard graduates of this period, Leonard journeyed to England following his studies in order to pursue a career in the ministry of the reforming English church. He was incorporated MA at Cambridge in 1654. After preaching in various places, in 1656 he was presented by the protector to the post of rector at Wanstead, Essex, which he held until he was ejected following the Restoration. He married Bridget Lisle (<i>d</i>. 1723), the daughter of the regicide judge <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16756/', "John Lisle")</script> and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16754/', "Lady Alice Lisle")</script>, and was active in the dissenting community during the 1660s. During this period he pursued interests in botany and medicine, which brought him into contact with Robert Boyle and other members of the Royal Society. Such connections were instrumental in obtaining a royal order to the University of Cambridge that led to his being granted the degree of doctor of physic in 1671. The university subscription book shows that he signed his name to the three articles despite his puritan religious convictions. During this time Hoar also continued his theological studies and published <span class="italic">Index Biblicus</span> (1668), a guide to the historical books of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>.<br>
<br>In 1672 Hoar returned to New England, ostensibly to accept a ministerial post with the Third Church of Boston. The previous year, however, Massachusetts leaders had written to John Owen, John Collins, and other English dissenters seeking aid for Harvard and soliciting advice regarding a successor to the ageing Charles Chauncy as president of Harvard College. When he arrived in the colony, Hoar carried with him a recommendation from Owen and the others that he be the new president. From his installation in December 1672 his tenure was not very successful. Some colonists questioned the fact that Hoar did not bring with him a letter of dismissal from his English congregation, and further criticism concerned the fact that in accepting the Harvard post he had broken an implicit promise to minister to the Third Church. In addition, he was probably the victim of disaffection sowed by unsuccessful candidates for the post. The fellows and students turned against Hoar, and a number of them left the college. Though the authorities gave him lukewarm support, his position became untenable and he resigned the post in March 1675. Yet his vision for the college was a forward-looking one. He had sought to introduce experimental science into the curriculum and provided equipment to do so. He secured a new charter that gave more power to the college fellows and less to the overseers. He had also used his English connections to raise funds to replace some of the older college buildings.<br>
<br>Hoar's health declined dramatically after he left Harvard. He died in Boston on 28 November 1675, and was buried on 6 December in Braintree, Massachusetts.<br>
