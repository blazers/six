<span class="headword">Shardlow <span class="st"> [Shardelowe]</span>, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1344), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was probably born at Thompson, Norfolk, though the name of the family may have been derived from the village of Shardlow in Derbyshire. He became a serjeant-at-law in 1318, and in August 1319 received the first of more than 130 commissions of oyer and terminer recorded to him in the chancery rolls. During the London eyre of 1321 he acted as pleader in twenty-nine cases, and received a fee of 40<i>s</i>. for his services on behalf of the city of London after the conclusion of the eyre. In July 1326 he is mentioned as chief justice of the common bench in Ireland but seems never to have taken up his duties there. During Michaelmas term 1329 he acted temporarily as justice of the king's bench; a permanent appointment to the common pleas followed in January 1332. In this year he also became a knight of the Bath. Shardlow appears in year-book reports from Michaelmas 1320 onwards, though his contributions cannot always be clearly identified, because the abbreviated form of his surname may sometimes refer to his colleagues William Shareshull (<i>d</i>. 1370) or Robert Scarborough. Apart from his work in the common pleas he also frequently acted as justice of assize on the eastern circuit and as justice of gaol delivery, as well as on special commissions; in October 1337 for instance he was appointed to deal with deserters from the royal army in the north of England.<br>
<br>After Edward III's unexpected return to London on 30 November 1340 Shardlow's career seemed to have come to an end when, despite a commission to act as justice of oyer and terminer addressed to him on 8 January 1341, he was among those royal officials who by 13 January had been arrested and subjected to the scrutiny of a judicial commission. In the following month he was among the thirteen justices against whom accusations and complaints were invited. His disgrace lasted for more than a year until on 16 May 1342 he was again appointed justice of the common pleas. In the second phase of his career he received several commissions to investigate smuggling, the import of counterfeit money, and other economic offences. This was part of a concerted campaign in several counties; Shardlow concentrated mainly on East Anglia. Summoned to parliament in July 1332 he also heard petitions from Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Gascony, and other areas during the Easter parliament of 1343.<br>
<br>The income from Shardlow's legal practice enabled him to lend substantial sums of money (&pound;20, &pound;40) to neighbouring landholders in 1324/5, and after 1332 he purchased several estates in Cambridgeshire and Suffolk. At the time of his death, on 5 March 1344, he held parts of the two manors of Fulbourn (near Cambridge) and Leverington (near Wisbech), three shops in Wisbech, and lands and rents to the value of &pound;1 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. in six places in Suffolk, as well as estates in Norfolk. In 1349 his sons John and Thomas founded a chantry for him and his wife, Agnes, in the church of Thompson, Norfolk.<br>
