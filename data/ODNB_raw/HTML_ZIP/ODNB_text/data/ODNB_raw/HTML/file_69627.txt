<span class="headword">Learmonth,  Christian</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1718, <em>d.</em> 1762), <span class="occ">milliner and shopkeeper</span>, was baptized at Bo'ness, Linlithgowshire, on 21 October 1718, the daughter of John Learmonth, schoolmaster and postmaster at Bo'ness, and of his first wife, Christian Livingston (<i>d</i>. in or before 1726), third daughter of Alexander Livingston of Parkhall, near Falkirk, Stirlingshire. She had a sister and four brothers, and three stepsisters from her father's second marriage, with Ann Crawford.<br>
<br>Christian lived in a house in Carrubber's Close, Edinburgh, on the north side of the High Street, which she bought in 1754. Her shop was in Lyon Close, further up the High Street, also on the north side. She was already in business by 1745, when another milliner, May McCrabie, first came to know her, and she was still actively engaged in business at the time of her death. As she had had no funding from her father she probably had difficulties in keeping the business afloat but she was given &pound;200 to help her to carry on her business by her lodger, Lady Charlotte Gordon, one of the twelve children of the second duke of Gordon. In her will, dated 20 May 1756, Christian left all her movable goods to Lady Charlotte but this was contested, after Christian's death, by her two stepsisters, Ann and Jean, who were also milliners, and a dispute ensued. In the following court case one of the witnesses, Mary (or May) McCrabie, a milliner, stated that she had heard Christian say that any of her money that was free, and thus not required to pay off debts, would be left to Lady Charlotte. Christian requested that her linen and clothes should be given to one of her stepsisters. During the court case evidence of Christian's personal and business circumstances was given by Mary McCrabie and another milliner, Ann (or Annie) Wardrope. Ann, the daughter of William Wardrope, a surgeon in Edinburgh, had been apprenticed to Christian Learmonth when she was eleven years old, Christian having found one of her own stepsisters unsatisfactory as an apprentice. Ann was later allowed to put &pound;30 into the business and to become a partner &#145;in Company&#146;, and she kept the proceeds of work done for her own customers. Lady Charlotte Gordon allowed Ann to carry on business after Christian's death.<br>
<br>Christian Learmonth died on 12 August 1762 in Carrubber's Close, Edinburgh, in her forty-fourth year. Lady Charlotte Gordon was made her executor. Christian had requested that her cousin Alexander Learmonth should make all the necessary arrangements for her funeral. Her shop goods were rouped (auctioned) and there is therefore a detailed inventory of these in the court papers, the details of which are of interest from the point of view of both eighteenth-century shopkeeping and the fashions of the period. Like other eighteenth-century Scottish milliners Christian and her partner made up bespoke accessories, such as caps and handkerchiefs, in the shop; details of the fabrics used are usually given in bills. The inventory of the shop can be compared with that of the milliner in the English context, such as Elizabeth Brown (or Browne) in Norwich, who had a similar business, for which a similar inventory and valuation survives. Christian's customers came from the families of town merchants and craftsmen as well as those of the landed gentry. Her total inventory, with the debts due to her, was valued at &pound;5472 12<i>s</i>. 5<i>d</i>. sterling.<br>
