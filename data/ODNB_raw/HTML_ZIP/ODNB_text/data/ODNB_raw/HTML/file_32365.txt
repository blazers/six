<span class="headword">Chapman,  Edward John</span>  (1821&#150;1904), <span class="occ">mineralogist</span>, was born on 22 February 1821 at an inn on the Kent&#150;Surrey border as his parents were returning to London from France. His father died two years later. Educated principally in France, Chapman attended the Lyc&eacute;e Henri IV and the Sorbonne in Paris, where his studies focused on mineralogy and chemistry. During the late 1830s he accompanied friends to Algeria and enlisted in the French army. After being wounded he returned to convalesce in England, where he married the daughter of a Colonel Cogan, with whom he had a son who predeceased him; following her death he later married Frances Sutherland, daughter of Captain Sutherland of Sydney, Nova Scotia, who outlived him.<br>
<br>Following his convalescence Chapman studied civil engineering, and worked for a time under William Froude (1810&#150;1837) on the staff of I. K. Brunel (1806&#150;1859). Nevertheless, he retained his interest in mineralogy, publishing two treatises in the mid-1840s: <span class="italic">Practical Mineralogy</span> (1843) and <span class="italic">A Brief Description of the Characters of Minerals</span> (1844). In the session 1848&#150;9 he gave lectures in mineralogy at University College, London, and, in 1851, he was appointed to a newly established chair in the subject. He also continued to publish in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span> and the <span class="italic">Chemical News</span>. In 1853 he was appointed to the new chair of geology and mineralogy at University College, Toronto. He remained there until 1889, when he moved to the University of Toronto's new school of practical science.<br>
<br>Chapman performed important public services in promoting and popularizing the work of the geological survey of Canada. Broadening his research to embrace Canadian geology and mineralogy, he also travelled widely to assess the commercial value of local deposits. He refined blowpipe analysis as a tool in testing for mineral traces through chemical reactions to flame. The bulk of his publications appeared in the Canadian Institute's <span class="italic">Canadian Journal of Industry, Science, and Art</span>, which he helped to edit for many years.<br>
<br>Chapman wrote one of the first Canadian scientific responses to <span class="italic">The Origin of Species</span>, and reviewed both the Revd James Bovell's <span class="italic">Outlines of Natural Theology</span> (1859) and J. W. Dawson's anti-transformist <span class="italic">Archaia</span> (1860). Sceptical of the theory of natural selection, he nevertheless preferred Darwin's impressive amassing of scientific evidence to Bovell's error-ridden compilation, especially in light of recent geological theory. Chapman admitted to occasional doubts regarding the fixity of species, and resisted the full implications of the cosmogony and natural history that Dawson attributed to scripture. Chapman was at his most effective, however, when conveying practical knowledge to general readers; his <span class="italic">Popular Exposition of the Minerals and Geology of Canada</span> appeared in serial form (1860&#150;64), along with several other texts.<br>
<br>Chapman received a PhD from the University of G&ouml;ttingen (1862) and an honorary LLD from Queen's College, Kingston (1867). A charter member of the Royal Society of Canada (1883), he retired in 1895 and returned to London. He died on 28 January 1904 at his home, The Pines, Hampton Wick, possibly as the result of after-effects of a serious accident in December 1901. His last work, on mineralogical classification, appeared posthumously. An amateur actor, master raconteur, published poet, and one-time fencing opponent of Louis Napoleon, Chapman is noteworthy for his scientific contributions to an important Victorian ideal, the wide dissemination of useful knowledge.<br>
