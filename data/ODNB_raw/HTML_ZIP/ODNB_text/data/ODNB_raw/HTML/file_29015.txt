<span class="headword">Wells,  John</span>  (1623&#150;1676), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister</span>, son of Hugh Wells of London, was born on 29 January 1623. He must be distinguished from the John Wells of Mickleton, Gloucestershire, who later became vicar of Tewkesbury and for some time lived at St Ives, Huntingdonshire. John Wells of London was admitted to Merchant Taylors' School on 11 September 1634. He matriculated from St John's College, Oxford, on 3 July 1640, was elected a fellow in 1643, and took the degree of BA on 7 May 1644. In November 1646 Wells was acting as chaplain at Ilford Hospital, in Essex, but he returned to Oxford and was created MA on 14 April 1648; his submission to the parliamentary visitors is not recorded, and it seems that he took up his rights as a fellow in response to their call. Certainly he was one of those appointed on 10 August 1648 &#145;to take care of all the affairs of St John Baptist College in the absence of Mr Cheynell&#146;  (Burrows, 182). Wells was minister of St Olave Jewry by January 1649, signing together with many others <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Ministers of the Gospel in and about London</span> in opposition to the trial of Charles I. He was a leader with Edmund Calamy of the City's sixth classis and acted as scribe of the London Provincial Assembly in November 1654.<br>
<br>Wells was ejected from St Olave's in 1662. On 3 May 1665 he was reported to be preaching at his house in Moorfields, and in 1669 another report had him preaching at the Blackamore, in Wood Street. On 1 July 1670 the governor of the Tower, Sir John Robinson, reported that the Moorfields house was no longer used as a meeting-place, but on 17 April 1672 Wells took out a licence to preach as a presbyterian there. He died on 18 June 1676 when, as the administration of his property records, he was resident in the parish of St Leonard, Shoreditch. In his sermon at the funeral of Wells on 2 July 1676, Thomas Watson, former minister at St Stephen Walbrook, recalled a minister who &#145;preached intelligibly to the capacity of his auditory&#146;, who was &#145;charitable and of a forgiving spirit&#146;, a man of &#145;candour and courtesy&#146;, &#145;not morose but affable&#146;  (Watson, 33&#150;4). Wells's wife, Maria, survived him, but Sarah, the daughter of a minister named John Wells, was buried at St Giles Cripplegate on 25 July 1664.<br>
