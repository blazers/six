<span class="headword">Manningham,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1722), <span class="occ">bishop of Chichester</span>, was born in St George's, Southwark, the son of Richard Manningham (<i>d</i>. 1682), rector of Michelmersh, Hampshire, and Bridget Blackwell. He was admitted a scholar of Winchester College in 1661. He was elected a probationer fellow of New College, Oxford, matriculating on 12 August 1669, graduated BA in 1673, and proceeded MA in 1677; he was a fellow of New College from 1671 to 1681. He received a Lambeth DD on 21 December 1691.<br>
<br>On ordination Manningham became, according to Anthony Wood, &#145;a high flown preacher&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.555). In 1681 he was presented to the comfortable living of East Tisted in Hampshire, &#145;Where being settled, he was passionately desirous to collect himself, to be known to few, and to be envied by none&#146;  (ibid.). It was there that his two eldest sons were baptized, in 1683 and 1685. Nothing is known of his wife, Elizabeth (1656/7&#150;1714) apart from the high-flown phrases on her monument in Chichester Cathedral: &#145;Comely in person, meek in her temper, most humble in her behaviour, prudent in all her actions, and pious through her whole life&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 1.208).<br>
<br>The king admired Manningham's preaching and in 1684 promised him the prebend at Winchester vacated by the promotion of Thomas Ken to the bishopric of Bath and Wells, but it was found to be in the gift of the lord keeper. Manningham succeeded Gilbert Burnet as preacher at the Rolls Chapel after the latter was dismissed because of his controversial sermon on 5 November 1684, in which he was supposed to have made a disloyal allusion to the lion and the unicorn. Manningham became a lecturer at the Temple and on 8 September 1691 rector of St Andrew's, Holborn, where, E. G. Rupp says, &#145;high churchmen and Non-Jurors were thick upon the ground&#146;  (Rupp, 69). He retained the living until April 1713, leaving so that Henry Sacheverell, the anti-whig preacher and pamphleteer, might receive a rich reward from Queen Anne after the three-year moratorium imposed upon him after his trial in Westminster Hall. Manningham was an early supporter of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, founded in 1699, further evidence of his high-church sympathies.<br>
<br>Appointed by Sir John Trevor as speaker's chaplain in 1690, four addresses were made by the House of Commons to the king on Manningham's behalf. The second, uniquely, specifically asked that &#145;the next prebend of Windsor or Westminster that should fall vacant&#146; be conferred on him  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 1688&#150;93, 10.736). This came about on 28 January 1693 when he was installed as a canon of Windsor. In 1708 Manningham became rector of Great Haseley, Oxfordshire, and in 1709 dean of Windsor.<br>
<br>Manningham served as a chaplain to William and Mary and had praised the queen's enthusiasm for ensuring the printing of court sermons, believing that the multitude of plain, useful, and practical sermons she caused to be printed were &#145;her gift to the publick&#146;  (Claydon, 97&#150;8). Royal favour continued, Queen Anne valuing his ministrations. On one occasion, when she was confined to her chamber by illness, it was suggested that Manningham should pray in an adjoining room, but he refused saying, &#145;he did not chuse to whistle the prayers of the Church through a key hole&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 1.208). A Hanoverian tory, a high-church supporter of the succession laid down by the <span class="roman">Act of Settlement</span> rather than to the Jacobite cause, he became bishop of Chichester on 10 November 1709, an appointment which pleased the queen. At Chichester he found a chapter of whig sympathies and consequently quarrels ensued. He reported to Archbishop Wake his concern about the danger to the church from the strength of dissenters in his diocese and opposed the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>.<br>
<br>Manningham was one of the bishops who signed a declaration in 1715 deploring the Jacobite rebellion of that year. He died at his house in Greville Street, Holborn, on 25 August 1722, and was buried in St Andrew's, Holborn. Many of his sermons were published in his lifetime. His will mentions ten children, of whom the names of six can be established: four sons (Thomas, Richard, Charles, and Simon) and two daughters (Mary and Dorothea). Thomas Manningham (<i>bap</i>. 1683, <i>d</i>. 1750) became, like his father, chaplain to the speaker (1718&#150;23); <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17982/', "Richard Manningham")</script>, the only one of the sons not to become a clergyman, became a leading man-midwife.<br>
