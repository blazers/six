<span class="headword">Knill,  Richard</span>  (1787&#150;1857), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, fourth child of Richard Knill, carpenter (<i>d</i>. 15 December 1826), and his wife, Mary Tucker (<i>d</i>. 1826), was born at Braunton, near Barnstaple, Devon, on 14 April 1787. In 1804 he enlisted as a soldier, but was soon afterwards bought out by his friends. He became a student of the Western Academy at Axminster in 1812, and under the influence of a sermon by Dr Alexander Waugh volunteered for missionary work. He was accepted by the London Missionary Society, and embarked for Madras on 20 April 1816. There he took services in English, while studying the native languages. His health soon failed, and he was sent in September 1818 to Nagercoil in Travancore, from where, after suffering from cholera, he returned to England on 30 November 1819. A cold climate was recommended for his health, so he sailed on 18 October 1820 for St Petersburg, intending to go to Siberia as a missionary, but British and American missionaries persuaded him to remain in that city. His mission had some success and obtained the support of the tsar and the royal family. A Protestant Bible Society was formed for supplying the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in their own tongues to Germans, Finns, Poles, Livonians, and other persons not belonging to the Greek church. A school was opened for the children of foreigners, and a mission to the sailors at Kronstadt established. On 9 January 1823 he married Sarah, daughter of James and Isabella Notman of St Petersburg, with whom he had five children.<br>
<br>On his return to England in August 1833 to obtain funds for building a larger church in St Petersburg, Knill was so successful a fund-raiser for the London Missionary Society that he was asked to remain at home, and for eight years he travelled widely in the United Kingdom, pleading the claims of the foreign missions. Exhausted by these labours, he on 1 January 1842 settled down as Congregational minister at Wotton under Edge, Gloucestershire, where he remained until he moved to Chester in 1848. His last days were some of the best of his career, and his preaching in the Chester Theatre for twenty Sunday afternoons was most successful. Few men of his time had greater mastery over large groups of people. Knill published a number of works on religion and missions, including <span class="italic">The Happy Death-Bed</span> (1833) and <span class="italic">A Dialogue between a Romish Priest and R. Knill, Missionary</span> (1841). He died at 28 Queen Street, Chester, on 2 January 1857.<br>
