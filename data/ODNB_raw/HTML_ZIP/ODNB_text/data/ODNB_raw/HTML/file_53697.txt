<span class="headword">Clod,  Frederick</span>  (<em>b. </em>1625<span class="mult">x</span>35, <em>d.</em> in or after 1661), <span class="occ">physician and alchemist</span>, was born between 1625 and 1635 in Holstein in Germany, where his father, Johann Clod (an itinerant experimenter), had agricultural interests. Clod had travelled widely in Germany and the Low Countries before arriving in London, probably early in 1652, when he became acquainted with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12500/', "Samuel Hartlib")</script>. On 18 August 1652 he was co-signatory (with Hartlib and the ecclesiastical negotiator John Durie) of the <span class="italic">Christianae societatis pactum</span>, a manifesto for a protestant fraternity devoted to the reformation of religion and the &#145;rational sciences&#146;. In the summer of 1653 he married Hartlib's daughter Mary (with whom he had a son, born early in 1655). Early in 1654 Clod established a &#145;goodly laboratory&#146; in the kitchen of his father-in-law, dedicated to alchemical and iatrochemical experiments. The &#145;Laboratorium Clodianum&#146; was to be a centre for medical and pharmaceutical reform, dedicated to public health including the distribution of medicines to the poor. It was part of a scheme to establish a &#145;general chymical council&#146; with his friend and correspondent Sir Kenelm Digby, who promised to provide &pound;600 of funding per year for the venture, and Robert Boyle was approached to sponsor a new and larger laboratory. Clod was a regular scientific correspondent of Boyle, Digby, Joachim Polemann, Johann Morian, Peter Staehl, and other English and continental chemists and physicians, with whom he exchanged information on alchemical processes and chemical and herbal medicines. His medical and alchemical knowledge seems to have been well-regarded by some of his peers, but he developed bad relations with his competitor George Starkey. In addition strong doubts about his character were expressed by John Evelyn and Henry More: Evelyn later dismissed him as &#145;a profess'd adeptus, who by &hellip; pretence of extraordinary arcana insinuated himselfe into acquaintance of his father-in-law&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of John Evelyn</span>, 3.391). Evelyn's judgement may reflect Clod's fraudulent dealings with patients. In 1653, on More's recommendation, Clod treated Anne, Viscountess Conway, for debilitating headaches, and also promised to convey a portrait of her to her brother John Finch in Padua. According to More, Clod received sixteen pieces of gold for his services but purloined the picture and provided the viscountess with an ineffectual or dangerous medicine. He was, according to More, a &#145;snap&#146; (swindler), a &#145;misshapen monster&#146; whom it was &#145;impossible ever to prove honest&#146;, and &#145;as accurs'd a Raskall as ever trod on English ground&#146;  (<span class="italic">Conway Letters</span> and Hutton, 88, 94&#150;5). Clod's shady reputation persisted. In May 1661 Durie wrote to Hartlib during the latter's last, fatal illness, lamenting &#145;the continuance of your son Clod's misdemeanours&#146; which made him &#145;incapable of the love of honest friends who will not &hellip; trust or assist him.&#146; On the other hand, writing only a few weeks earlier, Hartlib had commented to John Worthington that William Brereton &#145;would use no other physician but Clodius&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary and Correspondence of Dr John Worthington</span>, 1.304). Clod's subsequent fortunes and the date and place of his death are not known for certain, but he may have died during the plague of 1665.<br>
