<span class="headword">Torrigiani <span class="st"> [Torrigiano]</span>,  Pietro</span>  (1472&#150;1528), <span class="occ">sculptor and draughtsman</span>, was born &#145;sopr' Arno&#146; at noon on Sunday 22 November 1472 and began life probably in the family town house (first rented, later purchased by 1480) at the top of Borgo San Jacopo (near the Ponte Vecchio), Florence. Pietro, or Piero as he was baptized in Florence Cathedral on 24 November 1472, was the fifth of the eight children of Torrigiano di Antonio Torrigiani (1429&#150;<i>c</i>.1500) and Dianora di Francesco Tucci (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1449). His parents were both Florentine, and Pietro's uncle, Luca di Antonio Torrigiani, was responsible for establishing the main branch of the well-known Torrigiani family in Florence, whose roots can be traced back to 1258. Pietro's father worked as a silk merchant in Florence and also owned smaller country homes and vineyards in nearby Signa, known for the production of clay and terracotta.<br>
<br>Although several new documents have been discovered, still relatively little information about Pietro Torrigiani's family background, youth, and early training is known. According to the later sixteenth-century Florentine source Giorgio Vasari, as an adolescent Pietro Torrigiani studied drawings and terracotta, bronze, and marble sculpture with Bertoldo di Giovanni in the Florentine academy of Lorenzo de' Medici in the gardens near San Marco until about 1492. Vasari described Pietro's early works as &#145;very beautiful&#146; and thought his personality was strong and powerful, even haughty (<i>superbo</i>), overbearing, and prone to violence. The rivalry between Torrigiani and Michelangelo (nearly four years younger) led to the famous fist fight probably just before or during early 1492 in the Brancacci chapel in Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence, where Torrigiani broke Michelangelo's nose, permanently disfiguring him (an incident recorded by Vasari and Benvenuto Cellini). Consequently, Vasari reports that Lorenzo de' Medici banished Torrigiani from Florence; by August 1492 he is recorded in Bologna making a terracotta bust of a physician, Stefano della Torre. Vasari further records that Torrigiani then moved to Rome to work with Andrea Bregno and Bernardino Pinturicchio and their workshops on the stucco and marble decoration of the Torre Borgia apartments in the Vatican for Pope Alexander VI (who reigned from 1492 to 1503). Recently discovered documents dating between 1493 and 1506 establish that Torrigiani was active as a sculptor in Rome, Florence, Siena, and elsewhere in Italy and in Avignon, and that he may not have moved northwards to northern Europe and England until after 1506.<br>
<br>Documented in Rome as &#145;Magistro Petro Scarpelino Florentino&#146;, and also called &#145;Petrus Scarpelinus florentinus&#146;, Torrigiani was commissioned by Cardinal Adriano Castellesi, Pope Alexander VI's papal secretary, to produce a series of large marble sculptural monuments and architectural sculptures, including a cantoria, marble doorways, tombs, and monuments for San Giacomo degli Spagnoli, now called Nostra Signora del Sacro Cuore, on Piazza Navona in Rome. Torrigiani also produced at least three finely carved busts, of Santa Fina, St Gregory, and Christ for his landlord in Rome, the priest Stefano Coppi, who later donated these to his native town of San Gimignano. These were produced about 1498 in Rome, the same year Torrigiani wrote his will with Coppi as executor. Vasari records that concurrently Torrigiani supplemented his income by enlisting as a mercenary in Cesare Borgia's army in the war of Romagna (1499&#150;1500); he then joined the Florentines in their battle against Pisa (autumn 1499) and later fought at Gagliano, in December 1503, with Piero de' Medici and the French forces. He was lauded as a valiant soldier and returned to Florence at least by early to mid-1503, when he married Felici di Francesco di Niccol&ograve; Mori Ubaldini (<i>d</i>. 1541), with whom he had one child, a son, Torrigiano (1503&#150;1528). During this time Torrigiani carved the marble statue of St Francis (<i>c</i>.1501) for Cardinal Francesco Piccolomini's family altar (Siena Cathedral, completed by Michelangelo). Francesco Todeschini Piccolomini (<i>d</i>. 1503), the cardinal protector of England from 1492 to 1503, before being elected as Pope Pius III, and Cardinal Castellesi, Torrigiani's two main patrons during his formative years in Rome, were highly influential with the church and courts in England and Spain. They, along with the Florentine banking families Baroncelli, Bardi, Cavalcanti, and Frescobaldi, who also had branches in Rome, London, and throughout Europe, helped to arrange a network for the necessary introductions for the prestigious commissions Torrigiani would later receive in England.<br>
<br>In February 1504 Torrigiani is documented in Avignon, where he was commissioned to sculpt three statues for a <span class="italic">Crucifix with the Virgin and St John</span> for members of the Baroncelli family. In and out of Florence also during these years, Torrigiani made many drawings and marble and bronze sculptures &#145;with nobility and good style&#146;  (Vasari, 4.260) for merchants. In January 1506 he purchased in Rome two large blocks of marble which Michelangelo had previously owned, suggesting the two sculptors maintained professional contacts during this period. Thus, until 1506 Torrigiani travelled and worked as a talented sculptor throughout Italy and southern France while remaining active in Rome and Florence, probably with the workshops of Andrea Bregno, Giuliano da Maiano, and Antonio Pollaiuolo.<br>
<br>About 1506&#150;7 Torrigiani travelled north, perhaps with Florentine merchants or members of banking families. In April 1510 he is documented working for Margaret of Austria, regent of the Netherlands. In Bruges he repaired a bust of Mary Tudor, the daughter of Henry VII, king of England, and advised Margaret on the tomb of Mary of Savoy and unnamed funerary commissions, most probably for her priory church at Brou. He is first recorded in England on 23 November 1511, when he received the commission to make the tomb of the mother of Henry VII, Lady Margaret Beaufort (<i>d</i>. 1509), in the newly built Henry VII chapel in Westminster Abbey, London.<br>
<br>Torrigiani was, however, probably in London by about 1507, from which date he is thought to have advised Henry VII on plans for the king's family monuments, modelled the bust of Mary Tudor for her proposed marriage of 1507&#150;8 to Margaret of Austria's nephew Charles I, and then produced about 1509&#150;11 the three superb polychromed terracotta busts <span class="italic">King Henry VII</span> (V&amp;A), the young <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span>, and <span class="italic">John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester</span> (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), as well as the polychrome plaster and wood <span class="italic">Death Mask</span> and <span class="italic">Funeral Effigy of Henry VII</span> (Westminster Abbey Museum, London), on the king's death in April 1509.<br>
<br>The documented sculptures Torrigiani produced in England were all made for Westminster Abbey between 1511 and 1522/5, when he left to work in Spain. Working in the abbey precinct, Torrigiani collaborated with various northern craftsmen on the distinctive black touchstone, white marble, and gilt bronze tomb of Lady Margaret Beaufort. Verrocchio's earlier Medici tomb in San Lorenzo, Florence, and Pollaiuolo's papal tombs in St Peter's, Rome, probably inspired this new combination of precious materials. The surviving contract and documents establish that, for Lady Margaret's tomb, for a fee of &pound;500 Torrigiani designed and carved a new Italianate-inspired timber model of the tomb chest and the chest itself, incorporating Italian Renaissance decorations. He also made the life-like gilt bronze effigy and canopy based upon a two-dimensional design by Maynard Vewicke, a London painter. This system follows the more traditional medieval collaborative process then prevalent for the production of late Gothic tombs in England and northern Europe rather than the Italian Renaissance practice of allowing the sculptor greater artistic autonomy. As a result, the design of the Beaufort tomb is somewhat unbalanced, and the monument exhibits an uneven visual tension between the northern late Gothic tabernacle and the new Italianate-inspired tomb chest.<br>
<br>However, Torrigiani's next major work, the tomb of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York, commissioned on 26 October 1512 from Henry VIII, his next English patron, allowed Torrigiani considerably more freedom in design and execution to demonstrate further his many artistic talents. Torrigiani agreed <blockquote>to make and worke, or doo to be made and wrought, well, surely, clenly, workemanly, curiously and substancyally, for the sum of &pound;1,500 sterling, a tombe or sepulture of whit marbill and of black touchstone wt. ymags, figures, beasts and other things of cuppure gilt. (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 3/1, no. 7)</blockquote>For this central monument in the newly built chapel of Henry VII in Westminster Abbey, Torrigiani rejected the earlier estimate and design of 1506 which Guido Mazzoni had submitted based on the tomb of <span class="italic">Charles VIII of France</span> (St Denis, Paris). For the Henry VII tomb Torrigiani designed four elegant gilt bronze Italianate seated angels holding the epitaph and royal arms to flank the two gilt bronze life-size effigies which lie on a sarcophagus with Italian Renaissance motifs (naked Verrocchiesque putti, grotesques, garlands, and birds) and six roundels with reliefs representing pairs of the king's patron saints. The Henry VII monument and chapel were lauded as early as 1530 as one of &#145;the wonders of the world&#146; (<i>orbis miraculum</i>) in John Leland's description of Westminster Abbey  (<span class="italic">De rebus Britannicis collectanea</span>, 6 vols., 1530, ed. T. Hearne, 1715). More recently it was described as &#145;the finest Renaissance tomb north of the Alps&#146;  (Pope-Hennessy, 219). Its Italian Renaissance design was influential on tombs in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England.<br>
<br>The success of this tomb led Torrigiani to receive other important commissions in England. On 5 January 1519 he was commissioned by the king to design and produce for a fee of &pound;2000 an even larger and more monumental tomb (later abandoned) for Henry VIII and Katherine of Aragon. On 5 March 1517 he received the commission for &pound;1000 to produce the high altar for Henry VII's chapel (mainly destroyed 1644, but reconstructed with surviving pieces, 1932&#150;5). This was a sumptuous monument of gilt bronze reliefs, polychrome and white glazed terracotta statues, marble, and black touchstone. In June 1519 Torrigiani travelled from London to Florence and later that year returned with additional assistants and collaborators to work on these and other commissions, one of whom was probably Benedetto da Rovezzano. He contracted the painter Antonio Toto del Nunziata and the sculptors Antonio di Piergiovanni di Lorenzo da Settignano and Giovanni Luigi di Bernardo di Maestro Jacopo da Verona to return with him to London. Cellini refused Torrigiani's invitation to the Tudor court but described their meeting in his <span class="italic">Vita</span>, where he records that Torrigiani unsuccessfully attempted to enlist him to make &#145;a great work for my king&#146;, and boasted of his &#145;gallant feats among those beasts of Englishmen&#146;  (Cellini, 18). During these years Torrigiani designed and produced several other distinguished portrait busts and tombs in England in marble, bronze, and terracotta, including the wall tomb of Dr John Yonge (<i>d</i>. 1516) for the Rolls Chapel, Chancery Lane, the first completely Renaissance-style monument in England; the wall tomb of Dean John Colet (<i>d</i>. 1519) in St Paul's, Covent Garden (destroyed); the marble head and roundel of Christ the redeemer (<i>c</i>.1520/22; set before 1532 in the western exterior wall of Abbot Islip's chapel, Westminster Abbey, now in the Wallace Collection); the bronze profile bust of Sir Thomas Lovell (<i>d</i>. 1524); and other works, for example, at Hampton Court. Torrigiani's Florentine followers, including Giovanni da Maiano the younger and Benedetto da Rovezzano, continued to produce Italianate sculpture at the Tudor court for several decades after his departure.<br>
<br>Torrigiani left England for Spain either in 1522, when Charles V visited Henry VIII and his aunt, Katherine of Aragon, in London, or about 1525, when he is recorded after modelling a terracotta bust of Empress Isabella of Portugal (1503&#150;1539) for her marriage in 1526 to Charles V in Seville. Torrigiani may have worked for Isabella in Portugal and/or also on the Spanish royal tombs in Granada Cathedral. He is documented at the royal monastery of Guadalupe (Extremadura, Spain) in 1526 producing a polychrome terracotta statue of St Jerome (now in the sacristy), originally placed on the high altar. In Seville, Torrigiani modelled and painted masterful and influential life-size polychrome terracotta statues of the <span class="italic">Penitent St Jerome</span> and two <span class="italic">Virgin and Child</span> groups (one of these for the Hieronymite convent of San Jer&oacute;nimo de Buena Vista outside Seville&#151;both it and the <span class="italic">St Jerome</span> are now in the Museo de Bellas Artes, Seville). These powerful, expressive statues influenced later Spanish sculptors and painters, especially Monta&ntilde;es, Vel&aacute;squez, Zurbar&aacute;n, and Goya.<br>
<br>While in Spain in 1525, Torrigiani transferred ownership of a family farm in Tuscany to his nephew for 1100 gold Florentine ducats. According to Vasari, Torrigiani was so incensed after being tricked with an inadequate payment of sacks full of worthless &#145;maravedis&#146; as payment from the duque de Arcos in Seville that he destroyed a life-size terracotta statue of the Virgin and child that he was creating. He was imprisoned for this sacrilege, and due to his melancholic spirit he then starved himself to death. While this story remains unsubstantiated, estate documents refer to Torrigiani's widow receiving restitution of her inheritance, including various properties, and indicate that he died in the summer (July or August) of 1528.<br>
<br>Although Vasari, Cellini, and other supporters of Michelangelo created an unsympathetic image of Torrigiani and his work in Italy, his modelled and carved sculptures, especially his sepulchral monuments in Westminster Abbey and his polychrome sculptures made in England and Spain, are among the best Florentine Renaissance sculptures anywhere. He may rightly be credited as being one of the first Italian Renaissance artists to bring the new Italianate style and new combinations of sculptural materials and techniques into Tudor England. His influence in England continued with the work of other Italian sculptors and inspired later tomb monuments by Hubert Le Sueur, court sculptor to Charles I, in the Henry VII chapel in Westminster Abbey. Torrigiani was a brilliant and versatile Florentine Renaissance artist, whose most significant, innovative, and influential works were produced in early sixteenth-century England and Spain.<br>
