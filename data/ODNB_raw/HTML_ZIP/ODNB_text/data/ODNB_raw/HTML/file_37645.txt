<span class="headword">Laidler,  (Gavin) Graham</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Pont]</span>  (1908&#150;1940), <span class="occ">cartoonist</span>, was born in Newcastle upon Tyne on 4 July 1908, the only son and younger child of George Gavin Laidler, owner of a painting and decorating business, and his wife, Kathleen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Crosby. He was educated at Newcastle upon Tyne preparatory school and later at Trinity College, Glenalmond, Perthshire. His father died when he was thirteen and his family moved south, eventually settling in the village of Jordans, Buckinghamshire. He started drawing cartoons when still a schoolboy and was determined to earn his living in that way. But in 1926, as a result of family pressure, he enrolled at the London School of Architecture.<br>
<br>Laidler became seriously ill shortly after taking his first job in a surveyor's office. A tubercular kidney was diagnosed and he was advised to give up office work and to spend his winters abroad. He concentrated on drawing cartoons and in 1932 had his first acceptance from <span class="italic">Punch</span>, the beginning of a partnership which established him as a major comic artist and one of the most original talents in the long history of the magazine. His exceptional talent was eventually recognized by the editor, E. V. Knox, who placed him under an exclusive contract, an almost unprecedented arrangement. His cartoons, done under the name Pont, were in the <span class="italic">Punch</span> tradition of George Du Maurier and Frank Reynolds, poking fun at the middle classes. But his drawings were remarkable for their acuteness of observation and their complete lack of sentimentality, qualities which placed them in a different league. He excelled at grumpy antisocial males, harassed mothers, and their stony-faced domestic servants. His most successful series, called <span class="roman">The British Character</span> (later published as <span class="italic">The British Character Studied and Revealed</span>, 1938, with an introduction by E. M. Delafield), included a number of his most memorable drawings, with such titles as &#145;Weakness for Old Beams&#146;, &#145;Strong Tendency to Become Doggy&#146;, and &#145;Love of Travelling Alone&#146; (a bowler-hatted man who has covered the seats of his railway compartment with his umbrella and briefcase).<br>
<br>Laidler, who became an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects, came into his own at the outbreak of war in 1939. Another book, <span class="italic">The British Carry on</span> (1940), portrayed the atmosphere of the phoney war and the national response to the threat of invasion. Examples of this are his fierce-looking lady (to a heavily armed German soldier advancing over the lawn): &#145;How <i>dare</i> you come in here!&#146;; or a placid scene in a country pub where the radio on the bar is tuned to the German propaganda station: &#145;Meanwhile, in Britain, the entire population, faced by the threat of an invasion has been flung into a state of complete panic.&#146; These cartoons have frequently been used to illustrate the social history of that period.<br>
<br>Laidler was a tall, good-looking man, quiet and observant, who remained cheerful in spite of his illness. He was remembered with great affection by all who knew him in the course of his short life. He travelled widely, usually for reasons of health, which gave him an opportunity to observe the habits of British tourists. He died, unmarried, of polio on 23 November 1940 at the County Hospital, Hillingdon, near Uxbridge, Middlesex, at the age of thirty-two. During his brief career he had drawn over 400 cartoons, enough to furnish the material for five books, two of which were published posthumously.<br>
