<span class="headword">Crawshay,  William</span>  (1764&#150;1834), <span class="occ">ironmaster and merchant</span>, was the only son, in a family of one son and three daughters, of the ironmaster <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45891/', "Richard Crawshay (1739&#150;1810)")</script> and his wife, Mary Bourne (1745&#150;1811). Little is known of Crawshay's early life and education, only that he joined his father's business as a young man. It was the beginning of a tempestuous career. Like his father, William Crawshay was a masterful character and he found it difficult to work under the direction of a man of Richard Crawshay's autocratic temper. This led to repeated estrangements. A visitor to the Crawshay ironworks at Cyfarthfa, near Merthyr Tudful, in 1797 reported that the two<blockquote>would not sit in the same room together&#151;the young one however kept possession of the parlour, &amp; the old gent took possession of the counting house &amp; the business they were about was transacted by letters sent from the old Crawshay in the counting house to the young one in the parlour &amp; vice versa. (Gilbert Gilpin to William Wilkinson, 19 July 1797, Shropshire Records and Research Centre, 1781/6/25)</blockquote>About 1784 Crawshay married Elizabeth (Eliza), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Couzens (1760&#150;1825); they had three sons, Richard (1786&#150;1859), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6656/', "William Crawshay (1788&#150;1867)")</script>, and George (1794&#150;1873), and two daughters, Elizabeth (1790&#150;1877) and Mary (1793&#150;1881). Increasingly, William Crawshay was entrusted with running the firm's merchant house at George Yard in London, while his father remained at Cyfarthfa. Their physical separation could not, however, ameliorate relations completely. A fresh quarrel in 1809 led to the old man's revising his will. William Crawshay was replaced as his father's executor and residuary legatee by Benjamin Hall (1778&#150;1817), his brother-in-law, and left without a share in the ironworks. A belated reconciliation ensured William Crawshay's partial reinstatement, but he still acquired only a three-eighths share in the Cyfarthfa works upon his father's death in 1810, an outcome he described as &#145;disinheritance&#146;.<br>
<br>For much of the next decade Crawshay strove to reverse this humiliation and make himself the undisputed master of Cyfarthfa. His cousin Joseph Bailey (1783&#150;1858), who had inherited a two-eighths share in the works, was bought out for &pound;32,000 in 1813. Hall was more difficult to dislodge and Crawshay does not seem to have acquired his share in the works before Hall's death in 1817. Crawshay had more success in his dealings with Anthony Bacon, the illegitimate son of Anthony Bacon (<i>c</i>.1717&#150;1786), the founder of Cyfarthfa, to whom a royalty on the works' output was due. Through a mixture of intimidation and bluff&#151;including a deliberate running down of production at Cyfarthfa&#151;Crawshay persuaded Bacon to sell his interest in the site for &pound;95,000 in 1814.<br>
<br>The Cyfarthfa ironworks was the largest in Britain, producing 24,200 tons of pig iron from eight blast furnaces in 1823, yet the functioning of the Crawshay firm was far from smooth. William Crawshay adhered to the policy of his father, that George Yard should be the exclusive outlet for iron produced in Merthyr. Unfortunately, his partners in the London house saw no reason why they should carry large stocks of Cyfarthfa iron when trade was slack. And his manager at Cyfarthfa, his son William Crawshay, had no wish to be tied to George Yard if he could command a higher price as an independent seller. Yet Crawshay was committed to using the financial resources of the merchant house to stockpile iron for which there was no immediate market, allowing the Crawshay firm to stand aloof from the price wars which afflicted the early nineteenth-century iron trade. It was a policy which fomented dissension within the Crawshay firm until William Crawshay's death&#151;an event which his partners and sons awaited with ill-disguised eagerness.<br>
<br>William Crawshay, the Iron King, died on 11 August 1834 at his suburban mansion at Stoke Newington, Middlesex. He was afterwards a rather forgotten figure. Normally resident in the vicinity of London, he did not live on in the folk memory of south Wales as his father and his son were to. Nevertheless, Crawshay's guile and ruthlessness were characteristic of the Crawshay clan and he used these qualities to the full to maintain the family's position at the head of the British iron trade.<br>
