<span class="headword">Powle, Sir  Stephen</span>  (<em>c.</em>1553&#150;1630), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was born at Cranbrook, Essex, the youngest son of the chancery clerk Thomas Powle (1514&#150;1601) of St Anne's, Aldersgate, London, and Jane Tate (1521&#150;1577) of Wraxham, Norfolk. About 1564 Stephen went to Broadgates Hall, Oxford, where he was admitted BA (March 1569) and MA (December 1572). In November 1574 he entered the Middle Temple, lodging for some time with the young Walter Ralegh. Despite success in his legal studies, Powle left London in 1579 for Geneva, where he attended Beza's lectures, thus demonstrating his Calvinist leanings. He then spent six months at Basel University before enrolling as a student at Strasbourg in early 1581. After study at Strasbourg, and excursions to Speyer and Heidelberg, he went to Paris in late 1581, and was back in England by March 1582.<br>
<br>Powle now entered the service of the lord treasurer, Burghley, but by April 1583 he had gone north to Scotland, where he spent six months studying under Andrew Melville at New College, St Andrews. In early 1585 he returned to Heidelberg as Burghley's agent at the court of Duke Casimir, where he passed his time at the university until in March 1586 Casimir entrusted him with letters for England. As his next assignment, in March 1587 Powle was dispatched by secretary Walsingham as an agent to Venice, from where he sent regular newsletters, reporting on papal plots against Elizabeth. Within a year, however, he was recalled from Venice and once more languished in London, living with his father in Maiden Lane. Eager for employment, in early 1589 he sought Burghley's permission to return to Switzerland, while Walsingham suggested service with the duke of Brandenburg; a rumour that he was to be sent as ambassador to Scotland came to nothing.<br>
<br>At last Powle decided to remain in England. In March 1590 he married Elizabeth Hobart (1556&#150;1590) of Wraxham, Norfolk, but she died on Christmas eve the same year, following childbirth. In late 1593 he married an Essex widow, Margaret Smyth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Turner), and settled with her at Smyth Hall, Blackmore, Essex, where he lived the life of a country gentleman and served as a JP. He became a friend of the Essex poet Nicholas Breton, who dedicated <span class="italic">The Court and Country</span> (1618) to him. Following concerns about his elderly father's neglect of his chancery duties, in April 1596 Stephen was appointed deputy clerk of the crown in chancery, and in 1601 Thomas surrendered his six clerkships to his son. On 8 July 1604 Stephen Powle was knighted by James I at Theobalds. In March 1609 he enrolled as an &#145;adventurer&#146; in the Virginia Company and subsequently served on its London council; he also invested in an expedition to Guiana.<br>
<br>Powle divided his time between Blackmore and his houses in Chancery Lane and at Mile End, Middlesex, until April 1621, when his wife, Margaret, died and Smyth Hall passed to her heirs. In May 1623 he married Ann (<i>d</i>. 1631), widow of Sir Richard Wigmore, and they settled in her house in King Street, Westminster, where Powle passed his declining years. He died intestate, and was buried at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 26 May 1630. Powle's papers, including several commonplace books and travel journals, are preserved in the Tanner manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.<br>
