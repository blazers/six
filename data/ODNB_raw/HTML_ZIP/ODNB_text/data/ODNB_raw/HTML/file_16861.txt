<span class="headword">Lloyd,  William Forster</span>  (1794&#150;1852), <span class="occ">political economist</span>, was born at Bradenham, Buckinghamshire, the fourth son of Thomas Lloyd (<i>d</i>. 1815), rector of Aston-sub-Edge, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ryder (<i>d</i>. 1814). He was the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16822/', "Charles Lloyd (1784&#150;1829)")</script>, bishop of Oxford. Educated at Westminster School (captain in 1811), he was elected to a studentship at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1812. He graduated BA in 1815, with a first class in mathematics and a second in classics. He proceeded MA in 1818. He was Greek reader in 1823, mathematical lecturer at Christ Church until the end of 1824, and filled the Drummond chair of political economy in 1832&#150;7. He published <span class="italic">Prices of Corn in Oxford in the Beginning of the Fourteenth Century</span> (1830). His lectures as Drummond professor, on checks to population (1832), the notion of value (1833), the poor laws (1834, 1836), the justice of poor laws (1836), and on rent (1836) were also published, and were gathered together in <span class="italic">Lectures on Population, Value, Poor-Laws and Rent</span> (1837). He was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1834.<br>
<br>Lloyd relinquished his Christ Church studentship on his marriage, at Hackney on 6 July 1837, to Eleanor, daughter of Augustus William Bode. Although in holy orders, he held no preferment, but lived on his property, Prestwood, Missenden, Buckinghamshire, apparently in poor health. He died there on 2 June 1852. Although he was a comparatively obscure figure by the time of his death, his work was rediscovered in the early twentieth century by the American economist E. R. A. Seligman, who suggested that Lloyd had anticipated the marginal utility theory of value. His work has been described as &#145;a distinguished technical contribution&#146; to economic analysis, exemplifying a distinct Oxford approach to political economy  (Hilton, 47, 50). Concerned with the plight of working people during the transition to a manufacturing economy, he defended the right of the poor to poor relief, and criticized the optimistic view of the market economy promoted by some Oxford contemporaries. While they made little impact on public policy in his lifetime, Lloyd's writings remained of posthumous interest: the example of individual farmers over-grazing common land, used in his 1833 lectures on population, influenced the twentieth-century biologist Garrett Hardin's article on &#145;The tragedy of the commons&#146; (1968).<br>
