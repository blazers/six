<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tillemans,  Peter</span>  (<em>c.</em>1684&#150;1734), <span class="occ">painter and draughtsman</span>, was born in Antwerp, the Netherlands, the son of a diamond cutter. He was brother-in-law to the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4864/', "Pieter Casteels")</script> (it is assumed he married before leaving Antwerp) and studied painting under various masters before being brought to England in 1708 by a picture dealer named Turner.<br>
<br>Establishing an exact chronology is difficult as Tillemans worked in many different styles, rarely dating his works. However, after initially working as a copyist, he seems to have rapidly made a name for himself, gaining in 1709 two prestigious commissions, <span class="italic">Queen Anne in the House of Lords</span> (<i>c</i>.1709; Royal Collection) and <span class="italic">The House of Commons</span> (<i>c</i>.1710; Palace of Westminster Collection). He became a founder member of the Great Queen Street Academy in 1711, describing his speciality as &#145;landskip&#146;, and by 1715 was painting battle scenes for the Revd Dr Cox Macro. 1717 saw a further expansion of Tillemans's repertoire, his picture of the royal family making music being exhibited at Bartholomew fair. This theatrical vein in Tillemans's work continued in the 1720s, including a collaboration with Joseph Goupy, in 1724, on scenery for the Haymarket opera house.<br>
<br>Between 1719 and 1721 Tillemans worked as a topographical artist for the antiquarian John Bridges, completing about 500 drawings for Bridges' proposed history of Northamptonshire; a number of these were later published in Peter Whalley's <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of the County of Northamptonshire</span> (2 vols., 1791). The early 1720s also saw Tillemans moving successfully into the field of horse painting and racing scenes. He produced several versions of such works, including his <span class="italic">Newmarket: the Long Course</span> (1723; Gov. Art Coll.). It was also during this period that Tillemans painted some of his best Thames-side views. His grand panorama <span class="italic">The Thames from Richmond Hill</span> (<i>c</i>.1723; Gov. Art Coll.) was one of three pieces done for Lord Radnor.<br>
<br>A member of the Rose and Crown Club, Tillemans was recorded by Vertue as steward, for 1725, to the Society of the Virtuosi of St Luke. Vertue also noted that he was in a position of &#145;acquaintance amongst &hellip; people of fashion &amp; persons of Quality&#146;  (Vertue, 3.14), much in demand as a painter of country-house and estate views. <span class="italic">Chatsworth House</span> (1720s; Holker Hall, Cumbria) and <span class="italic">Chirk Castle</span> (1725; Chirk Castle, Denbighshire) stand out among his best essays&#151;the houses situated firmly within finely painted landscapes enlivened by animals and hunting scenes.<br>
<br>However, Tillemans's work at Little Haugh Hall, Suffolk, for Dr Cox Macro remains the best documented. In addition to battle scenes, landscapes, hunting pieces, and renovation work, he also painted one of his finest portraits, <span class="italic">Master Edward and Miss Mary Macro</span> (<i>c</i>.1733; Norwich Castle Museum). Such versatility must have been a major factor in Tillemans's success and is tacitly acknowledged in <span class="italic">The Artist's Studio</span> (<i>c</i>.1716; Norwich Castle Museum)&#151;a self-portrait, with Cox Macro and pupils, surrounded in the studio by a variety of works, complete and incomplete, after different masters.<br>
<br>In 1733 Tillemans retired to Richmond, Surrey, and died on 5 December 1734 while staying at Little Haugh Hall. He was buried on 7 December at Stowlangtoft church, Suffolk. The auction of his picture collection, conducted by Cox on 19 and 20 April 1733, included paintings by James Tillemans&#151;likely to have been a son or close relative&#151;and Arthur Devis, who, like Joseph Francis Nollekens, was almost certainly a pupil.<br>
