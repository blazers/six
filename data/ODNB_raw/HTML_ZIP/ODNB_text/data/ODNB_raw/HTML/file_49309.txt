<span class="headword">Leathart,  James</span>  (1820&#150;1895), <span class="occ">lead manufacturer and art collector</span>, was born on 25 November 1820 at Hill House, Alston Moor, Alston, Cumberland, the son of John Leathart (<i>b</i>. 1793), mining engineer and lead miner, and Margaret Setree (1792&#150;1870). He attended Alston grammar school until the age of fourteen when he was briefly employed by Burnett and Pattinson, an industrial chemical firm, before accepting a position as clerk at Locke, Blackett &amp; Co. in Newcastle upon Tyne. He devoted his entire career to this firm of lead manufacturers, studying chemistry and metallurgy in his spare time in order to improve his knowledge of the industry. He was rewarded when he was placed in charge of a new smelting and refining plant at St Anthonys, Newcastle upon Tyne, in 1846. He became sole managing partner of the firm in 1857. In the following year, on 22 June, he married Maria Hedley (1840&#150;1899), the daughter of a Newcastle soap manufacturer, with whom he had thirteen children.<br>
<br>Although Leathart's salary never exceeded &pound;600 per annum, he managed to form one of the finest collections of contemporary art in England. His early interest was in the English landscape school, represented by artists such as David Cox and John Varley. After he met the artist William Bell Scott, head of the Newcastle School of Art, his taste shifted to the more avant-garde Pre-Raphaelites. Scott's enthusiasm for advanced art impressed Leathart and he gradually sold off his earlier purchases to finance the acquisition of paintings and watercolours by artists including Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Ford Madox Brown, John Everett Millais, Edward Burne-Jones, Albert Moore, and James McNeill Whistler. His collection was distinguished by his predilection for solemn subjects, such as Millais's funereal <span class="italic">Autumn Leaves</span> (1855, Manchester City Galleries), Albert Moore's sombre <span class="italic">Elijah's Sacrifice</span> (1863, Bury Art Gallery and Museum), and Burne-Jones's compelling representations of <span class="italic">Sidonia von Bork</span> and <span class="italic">Clara von Bork</span> (both 1860, Tate collection). Leathart displayed his collection at his home in Gateshead alongside the blue and white Chinese porcelain favoured by devotees of the aesthetic movement. Fellow art lover John Hamilton Trist ranked Leathart's collection as &#145;one of the first in England&#146;  (J. H. Trist, 9 March 1868, Leathart MSS, University of British Columbia).<br>
<br>Leathart introduced Pre-Raphaelite and aesthetic art into the unusually close-knit community of Novocastrian businessmen, both in his capacity as secretary of the school of art and of the North of England Society, and as a member of the executive committees of the mechanics' institute and the Newcastle Arts Association. As a result of his proselytizing, chemical merchants Jacob Burnett and Alexander Stevenson embraced the credos of the aesthetic movement, and even more conservative collectors, such as ironmaster Sir Isaac Lowthian Bell and the armaments manufacturer Sir William Armstrong, commissioned works from Rossetti and Burne-Jones. Due to Leathart's enthusiastic but unassuming influence, Tyneside merchants and manufacturers shared artistic as well as business interests. His propensity for networking among businessmen&#150;collectors affected his own family circle: his daughter Margaret married the son of the Liverpool banker George Rae, who was one of Rossetti's major patrons.<br>
<br>Despite his passion for collecting, Leathart was forced to sell a number of works of art privately after Locke, Blackett &amp; Co. suffered financial reverses due to foreign competition, overcapacity, and the failure of new laboratory processes. Money worries weakened Leathart's constitution and brought on his death from pneumonia on 9 August 1895 at his home, Bracken Dene, Low Fell, Gateshead, co. Durham. He was buried at St John's Church, Gateshead Fell, co. Durham. His main asset was his art collection, which his heirs sold at the Goupil Gallery in June and July 1896 and at Christies on 19 July 1897; a few items remain in the family.<br>
