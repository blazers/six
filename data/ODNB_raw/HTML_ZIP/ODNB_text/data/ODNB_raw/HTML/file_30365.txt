<span class="headword">Alderson, Sir  Henry James</span>  (1834&#150;1909), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Quebec on 22 May 1834, the son of Lieutenant-Colonel Ralph Carr Alderson (1793&#150;1849), Royal Engineers, and his wife, Maria , daughter of Henry Thorold of Cuxwold, Lincolnshire. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/305/', "John Alderson (bap. 1757, d. 1829)")</script>, physician, was his grandfather. Educated at Stoton and Mayer's school at Wimbledon (1844&#150;8), he entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in May 1848. He was commissioned second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery on 23 June 1852, and served in Canada until 1854, when, on promotion to lieutenant, he returned to England. Serving through the Crimean War, he was at the Alma, Inkerman, and the siege and fall of Sevastopol. He was mentioned in dispatches, and received the L&eacute;gion d'honneur (third class). He was promoted second captain on 1 April 1859 and from February to June 1864 was attached on special mission to the headquarters of the Federal army under General O. A. Gillmor during the American Civil War, being present at the bombardment of Charleston.<br>
<br>On his return to England, Alderson joined the experimental department of the School of Gunnery, Shoeburyness, and became successively captain on 6 July 1867, major on 3 July 1872, lieutenant-colonel on 1 October 1877, brevet colonel on 1 October 1881, and major-general on 9 July 1892. He married in 1877 his second cousin, Florence (<i>b</i>. 1844/5), youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/303/', "Sir Edward Hall Alderson (bap. 1787, d. 1857)")</script>, baron of the exchequer. They had one son, and Florence survived her husband.<br>
<br>From 1871 Alderson held various appointments in the department of the director of artillery at the War Office. From 1891 to 1896 he was president of the ordnance committee. He retired on 22 May 1896, and from 1897 until his death was a director of Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co., an armaments manufacturer. He was made CB on 21 June 1887, KCB on 30 May 1891, and was appointed colonel-commandant in the Royal Artillery on 4 November 1905. He died at Durham on 10 September 1909.<br>
