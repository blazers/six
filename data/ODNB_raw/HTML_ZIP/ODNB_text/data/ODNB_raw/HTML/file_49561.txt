<span class="headword">Ayrton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Walshe; <em>other married name </em>Balchin]</span>,  Elisabeth Evelyn</span>  (1910&#150;1991), <span class="occ">novelist and writer on cookery</span>, was born on 2 February 1910 at Littlefield Farm, Worplesdon, Surrey, the eldest child of Douglas Thomas George Walshe (1880&#150;1952) and his first wife, Phyllis Sydney, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Johnson (<i>c</i>.1882&#150;1929). Both her parents were journalists; Douglas Walshe also wrote light-hearted and extremely popular romantic novels, allowing his family a comfortable life in the large house in Worplesdon, where Elisabeth grew up with her brother, William (1914&#150;1981), and much younger sister, Veryan (<i>b</i>. 1921).<br>
<br>Elisabeth Walshe attended Sherborne School and Sutton high school, matriculating at seventeen and determined on university. In 1929 she entered Newnham College, Cambridge, reading English in part one and archaeology and anthropology in part two of her degree. She married fellow graduate <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62402/', "Nigel Marlin Balchin (1908&#150;1970)")</script> on 21 January 1933 and taught English at an exclusive London school until the birth of her daughter Prudence in 1934. A second daughter, Penelope, followed in 1937. During the war she joined Maurice Buckmaster's Special Operations Executive, selecting and screening agents for undercover work in Europe.<br>
<br>A third daughter, Frej&auml;, was born in December 1944, and in 1947 the family moved to a house near Canterbury, where Balchin, now a successful novelist, could write undisturbed. Elisabeth, too, was writing poetry and short stories, but he was dismissive, and she remained uncertain of their merit. Frustrated and isolated, her marriage effectively ended in 1948 when she fell in love with a friend of Balchin, the young painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30777/', "Michael Ayrton (1921&#150;1975)")</script>. They married on 28 November 1952, a year after her divorce. It was only then, in her early forties, that she began to take her writing seriously: encouraged by Ayrton, she sent stories to <span class="italic">Vogue</span> and <span class="italic">Harper's Bazaar</span>; her poetry was read on the BBC's Third Programme, and she made extensive contributions to <span class="italic">Woman's Hour</span>. She also wrote her first novel, <span class="italic">The Cook's Tale</span> (1957). A love story with recipes, it is set in the south of France, ranging in time from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. All the recipes were tested in her own kitchen.<br>
<br>Living with Ayrton, Elisabeth had become interested in cooking, from which came <span class="italic">Good Simple Cookery</span> (1958), a book for housewives suddenly cooking for themselves, and bewildered by the new diversity of ingredients. It became a classic, and remains among the best basic cookery books. Her next book was very different: a photographic volume, <span class="italic">Doric Temples</span> (1961), for which she provided a text informed by her archaeological interests. She and Ayrton travelled extensively in Greece from 1957, especially in Crete, the background for her second novel, <span class="italic">The Cretan</span> (1963), an atmospheric, sometimes brutal account of deafness, peasant life, and smuggled antiquities.<br>
<br>1967 brought another practical cookery book, <span class="italic">Time is of the Essence</span>, but it was her next books which united her various passions in a virtually new genre, the historical cookery book. <span class="italic">Royal Favourites</span> (1971) explored the origins of famous dishes from royal kitchens, with updated recipes, while <span class="italic">The Cookery of England</span> (1974) set concise, easy-to-follow recipes against a cultural background stretching from the fifteenth century to the present day, meticulously researched and engagingly presented.<br>
<br>In addition to work, there were many demands on Elisabeth's time. At Bradfields, the sprawling Essex farmhouse where the Ayrtons arrived in 1952, she played hostess to a wide circle of friends while managing and maintaining house, garden, and workaholic husband, and remaining in close contact with her daughters. Yet she never lost sight of her own need to write: she completed her third novel, <span class="italic">Two Years in my Afternoon</span>, in 1972, and an expedition to Kenya in 1973 left her planning a fourth.<br>
<br>Michael Ayrton's health, never robust, gradually deteriorated; his early death in November 1975 was a blow from which Elisabeth found it difficult to recover. She moved to Gloucestershire, where with her extended family she struggled to begin life again. Her Kenyan novel, <span class="italic">Day Eight</span> (1978), was followed by several cookery books, including <span class="italic">English Provincial Cooking</span> (1980) and an early response to the growing vegetarian movement, <span class="italic">The Pleasure of Vegetables</span> (1983). Her last book, <span class="italic">Traditional British Cooking</span> (1985), written with Theodora Fitzgibbon, continued the marriage of history and good food, celebrating British cooking during a period when its culinary traditions were generally despised. She created another splendid garden, and, with two of her daughters, ran a small antiques business, while also overseeing the continuing exhibitions of Michael Ayrton's work. Her appetite for travel remained prodigious, supported by health which remained good until almost the end of her life. Of middle height and build, fair-skinned with striking auburn hair, brown eyes, and a tendency to freckle which she deplored, Elisabeth Ayrton never looked her age. Her energy, common sense, and efficiency hid a shyness and lack of self-confidence which only those closest to her recognized. She could be alarmingly aloof on occasion, especially when inwardly intimidated; but when at ease she was warm, charming, and profoundly interested in people. She was an atheist and a lifelong socialist, with a firm belief that people should have what they needed; she was also unstintingly generous, and always preferred giving to receiving. She could, perhaps, have written more, but her diverse life, thoroughly enjoyed, enriched others as much as herself.<br>
<br>Elisabeth Ayrton died on 15 November 1991 at her home, the Maze House, Rockhampton, after a brief battle with cancer, and was buried with Michael Ayrton at St Botolph's Church, Hadstock, Essex, on 20 November. Her fifth novel, <span class="italic">The Echoing Voyage</span>, remained unfinished.<br>
