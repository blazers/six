<span class="headword">Overton,  John Henry</span>  (1835&#150;1903), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and ecclesiastical historian</span>, born at Louth, Lincolnshire, on 4 January 1835, was only son of Francis Overton, surgeon, of Louth, a man of learning and of studious habits, and his wife, Helen Martha, daughter of Major John Booth of Louth. Educated at Louth grammar school (1842&#150;5) and at a private school at Laleham, Middlesex, under the Revd John Buckland, Overton went to Rugby School in February 1849, from where he obtained an open scholarship at Lincoln College, Oxford. He gained a first class in classical moderations in 1855 and a third in the final classical school in 1857 (BA 1858, MA 1860), was captain of his college boat club, rowed stroke of its eight, was a cricketer and throughout his life retained a keen interest in the game, and in his later years was a keen golfer.<br>
<br>In 1858 Overton was ordained to the curacy of Quedgeley, Gloucestershire, and in 1860 was presented by J. L. Fytche, a friend of his father, to the vicarage of Legbourne, Lincolnshire. While there he took pupils and studied English church history, specially of the eighteenth century. On 17 July 1862 he married Marianne Ludlam, daughter of John Allott of Hague Hall, Yorkshire, and rector of Maltby, Lincolnshire; she survived him with one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1878, in conjunction with his college friend Charles John Abbey, rector of Checkendon, Oxfordshire, Overton published <span class="italic">The English Church in the Eighteenth Century</span> (2 vols.), intended as a review of &#145;different features in the religion and church history of England&#146; during that period rather than as &#145;a regular history&#146;  (<span class="italic">The English Church in the Eighteenth Century</span>, 2nd edn, 1887). It was well received and ranked high among English church histories; an abridged one-volume edition was published in 1887.<br>
<br>Overton was collated to a prebend in Lincoln Cathedral by Bishop Christopher Wordsworth in 1879, and in 1883, on Gladstone's recommendation, was presented by the crown to the rectory of Epworth, Lincolnshire, the birthplace of John Wesley, in whose career he took a warm interest. While at Epworth he was rural dean of Axholme. In 1889 he was made honorary DD of Edinburgh University. From 1892 to 1898 he was proctor for the clergy in convocation, and took an active part in its proceedings, speaking with weight and judgement. In 1898 he was presented by the dean and chapter of Lincoln to the rectory of Gumley, near Market Harborough, Leicestershire, and represented the chapter in convocation. He was a frequent and popular speaker at church congresses. In 1901 he was a select preacher at Oxford, and from 1902 Birkbeck lecturer at Trinity College, Cambridge. Early in 1903 Dr Carr Glyn, the bishop of Peterborough, made him a residentiary canon of his cathedral; he was installed on 12 February and, as the canonry was of small value, retained his rectory. He kept one period of residence at Peterborough, but did not live to inhabit his prebendal house. A high-churchman and member of the English Church Union, he appreciated the views of those who differed from him. He was an excellent parish priest, and was courteous, good-tempered, and humorous.<br>
<br>Overton died at Gumley rectory, Leicestershire on 17 September 1903. He was buried in the churchyard of the parish church of Skidbrook, near Louth, where many of his family had been interred. As memorials, a brass tablet was placed in Epworth parish church by the parishioners, a stained-glass window and a reredos in Skidbrook church, and a window in the chapter house of Lincoln Cathedral.<br>
<br>As a historian and a biographer Overton specialized in the history of the Church of England from the mid-seventeenth century into the mid-nineteenth century. His most important work was <span class="italic">The English Church in the Eighteenth Century</span>, which has maintained an important place in the historical literature, and which can be read as an ecclesiastical analogue to the <span class="italic">History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century</span> by Leslie Stephen, which appeared two years earlier in 1876. The pioneering work of Abbey and Overton retains much which is of enduring value to scholars of the eighteenth-century church.<br>
<br>Much of Overton's work has strong associations with his own Lincolnshire connections, including his membership of Lincoln College, Oxford. This is most apparent in his admiring biography <span class="italic">John Wesley</span>, which appeared in the <span class="roman">Leaders of Religion</span> series in 1891. It is also discernible in his <span class="italic">Life of Christopher Wordsworth, Bishop of Lincoln</span> (1888; 2nd rev. edn, 1890), which he was invited to write alongside the bishop's daughter, Elizabeth Wordsworth, principal of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. Similarly, <span class="italic">John Hannah, a Clerical Study</span> (1890), which he acknowledged to be something of a study in high-church clerical failure, has strong associations with Lincolnshire and Lincoln College. He also wrote a volume entitled <span class="italic">Biographical Notices of the Bishops of Lincoln, from Remigius to Wordsworth</span> with another canon of Lincoln, George Cresley Perry, which, although set up by the printer in 1900, did not finally appear in print until 1972. Although Overton does not directly refer to his work, it is interesting that Mark Pattison, a fellow of Lincoln when Overton and Abbey were undergraduates, should have developed his own interests in the eighteenth-century church in his contribution to <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span> (1860).<br>
<br>There is certainly an air of apologetic in much of Overton's writing, and his frequently sympathetic understanding of eighteenth-century Anglican theology acted as an implicit antidote to elements of the criticism of the evolving status of revealed religion as discussed in the writings of Pattison and Stephen. His high-churchmanship, which informed much of his work in <span class="italic">The English Church in the Eighteenth Century</span> and a great deal of his appreciation of Wesley's career, came to the fore in two of his more openly apologetic studies, <span class="italic">William Law: Nonjuror and Mystic</span> (1881) and <span class="italic">The Nonjurors: their Lives, Principles and Writings</span> (1902). He also provided a useful edition of Law's devotional classic, <span class="italic">A Serious Call</span>, for the <span class="roman">English Theological Library</span> in 1898. His high-church piety was also reflected in the short character sketches which were posthumously published as <span class="italic">Some Post-Reformation Saints</span> (1905). Overton was also sympathetic to the aims and ideals of the earlier generations of evangelicals, and this appreciation informed both the whole of his useful, if too biographical, study <span class="italic">The Evangelical Revival in the Eighteenth Century</span> (1886) and his otherwise rather high-church-inclined surveys <span class="italic">The English Church in the Nineteenth Century</span> (1894) and <span class="italic">The Anglican Revival</span> (1897). Overton saw the high-church and the evangelical movements as complementary wings in the Church of England; his real suspicions were of latitudinarian and liberal churchmanship, as is demonstrated in much of the argument of <span class="italic">Life in the English Church, 1660&#150;1714</span> (1885), a work which began life as lectures to his Wednesday evening congregation at Epworth, and which has the directness of approach one would expect of it. His strong sense of the specifically English nature of the Church of England pervades his study <span class="italic">The Church in England</span> (2 vols., 1897), which covered the inextricably linked life of the church in national life from its origin in St Augustine's mission to his own time. His strongly Anglican style of churchmanship and ecclesiology was reflected in a sermon repudiating the papal denial of Anglican orders, which was published in Lincoln at the request of his bishop as <span class="italic">Anglican Orders</span> (1896).<br>
<br>At his death Overton left unpublished <span class="italic">A history of the English church from the accession of George I to the end of the eighteenth century</span>, which was edited and completed by the Revd Frederic Relton in 1906. In his preface to this last work, Relton defined Overton's approach in terms which suggest the central defect of his work for other scholars: &#145;Canon Overton, moreover, had not, in this instance, departed from his favourite method of writing history, namely, that of dealing with the lives of the great men of the time rather than writing a consecutive narrative of events and tendencies&#146;  (F. Relton, &#145;Preface&#146; to J. H. Overton, <span class="italic">English Church from George I</span>, 1906, ix&#150;x). At times, Overton's biographical instincts tended towards the hagiographical, especially when he was writing about high-churchmen or pioneering evangelicals. He contributed many memoirs of divines to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, and wrote for the <span class="italic">Dictionary of Hymnology</span> and the <span class="italic">Church Quarterly Review</span>, and other periodicals.<br>
