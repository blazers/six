<span class="headword">Warde,  James Prescott</span>  (1792&#150;1840), <span class="occ">actor</span>, the son of J. Prescott, was born in the west of England on 27 September 1792, and brought up in wealthy circumstances. Beginning with a grammar school education, including instruction in Latin and Greek, he went on to become a cadet first at the Royal Military College, Great Marlow, in 1806, and then at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich in 1807. He became a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery in 1809 and the following year was sent to the Cape of Good Hope, where he remained for three years. Ill health made him return to England in 1813 and resign from the army. He took to the stage, adopting the name of Warde, which was his mother's maiden name.<br>
<br>Warde's first appearance was at the Liverpool theatre as Lord Towneley in Colley Cibber's <span class="italic">The Provoked Husband</span>, followed by the Duke in John Tobin's <span class="italic">The Honeymoon</span>. To gain more experience he toured Derbyshire, Lancashire, and other provincial theatres. In Bath in December 1813 he was Achmet in Browne's tragedy <span class="italic">Barbarossa</span>, and the following year he played Faulkland in Sheridan's <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>, Harry Dornton in Thomas Holcroft's <span class="italic">The Road to Ruin</span>, and Aladdin in a pantomime at Christmas. In 1815 he was Laertes to W. C. Macready's Hamlet, and in the ensuing years he played a variety of other Shakespearian characters, such as Orlando in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, Macduff in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, Shylock in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, Edgar in <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, Posthumus in <span class="italic">Cymbeline</span>, and Florizel in <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span>. He was given the original role of Fitz-James in <span class="italic">The Lady of the Lake</span>, but found greater opportunities in the numerous revivals staged in Bath. He was seen as Jaffier in <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>, Joseph Surface in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>, Doricourt in <span class="italic">The Belle's Stratagem</span>, Standard in <span class="italic">The Constant Couple</span>, Alonzo in <span class="italic">Pizarro</span>, and Bevil in Richard Steele's <span class="italic">The Conscious Lovers</span>. In April 1818 he appeared as Rob Roy when the play of that name was performed in Bath for the first time. In the meantime, during the vacations he widened his horizons by making successful and profitable visits to Cheltenham, Weymouth, and other provincial towns.<br>
<br>Warde made his d&eacute;but in London at the Haymarket on 17 July 1818, as Leon in Beaumont and Fletcher's <span class="italic">Rule a Wife and have a Wife</span>. His choice of part was judicious and he was well received. He was less successful as Shylock a few days later, but gradually established his reputation with the roles of Faulkland in <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>, Don Felix in Susannah Centlivre's <span class="italic">The Wonder</span>, Valmont in William Dimond's <span class="italic">The Foundling of the Forest</span>, and Inkle in <span class="italic">Inkle and Yarico</span>. At the close of this engagement Warde received an offer to play leading roles in Dublin, and appeared there for the first time in June 1820 as Leon. He remained in Dublin until a long and severe illness forced him to retire and set up as a teacher of elocution. After his wife nursed him back to health he was able to return to the stage, and made a strong impression in Birmingham. He became the manager of the Birmingham theatre for a while, but sustained heavy financial losses and had to retire in a state of insolvency.<br>
<br>Warde reappeared on the London stage in the autumn of 1825, when he was engaged at Covent Garden as second lead to Charles Kemble, and was seen as Brutus, Rob Roy, Iago, and the original Kruitzner in Harriet Lee's <span class="italic">The Three Strangers</span>. He continued to act in many of his old parts, but occasionally tried new roles, such as Rolla in <span class="italic">Pizarro</span>, Macbeth, Cassius in <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span>, Richmond in <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, Bolingbroke in <span class="italic">Richard II</span>, and Sir Brian de Boisgilbert in <span class="italic">Ivanhoe</span>. He played the title role in <span class="italic">Henri Quatre</span> for his own benefit in June 1830. Soon, however, the quality of the plays produced at Covent Garden began to decline and the finances of the house fell into a state of hopeless confusion. This reached a climax in 1833, when inability to obtain his salary drove Warde to seek refuge at the Olympic and afterwards at the Victoria Theatre, under the management of Abbott and Egerton. The decay of the old &#145;legitimate&#146; drama to which he was accustomed combined with the decay of his own acting powers to reduce his opportunities to a minimum. He was engaged at Covent Garden during Macready's brief lesseeship of 1837&#150;8, but was entrusted only with second-rate parts, such as Williams in <span class="italic">Henry V</span>. His personal life degenerated and he was constantly in debt and under arrest. He died in penury, without friends, in a lodging in Manchester Street, London, on 9 July 1840, at the age of forty-eight.<br>
<br>According to contemporary opinion, Warde was a seldom great but eminently pleasing actor. He was full of promise at the time of his first appearance in London; latterly, however, he developed &#145;an unfortunate whining drawl&#146; which prevented him from ever emerging completely from the ranks of &#145;utility&#146; actors.<br>
