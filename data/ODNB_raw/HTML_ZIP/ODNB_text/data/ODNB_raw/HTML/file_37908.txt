<span class="headword">Meuland <span class="st"> [Meuleng, Meulent, Molend]</span>,  Roger  de</span> <span class="st"> [Master Longesp&eacute;e]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1215&#150;1295), <span class="occ">bishop of Coventry and Lichfield</span>, was a kinsman of Henry III. He is once referred to by the chronicler Matthew Paris as Master Longesp&eacute;e  (Paris, <span class="italic">Chron</span>., 5.644), prompting speculation that he was the son of William Longesp&eacute;e, earl of Salisbury (<i>d</i>. 1226), Henry III's uncle, but there is no supporting evidence for this and his paternity remains uncertain. The reason why Roger was styled de Meuland (Meuleng, Meulent, and Molend are among the variant forms of his name) is unclear, although it probably indicates some connection with Meulon in Normandy. Perhaps it was there that he was born or brought up.<br>
<br>Nothing seems known of Meuland's early career. By 1257 he was a canon of Lichfield and a papal chaplain. He owed his election to the bishopric of Coventry and Lichfield, in the January of that year (his consecration followed on 10 March 1258), to the influence of the king's brother, Richard, earl of Cornwall. Later in 1257 Meuland went out to Germany with Richard, where the latter had been elected king. He repeated the journey in 1258. Meuland was no mere creature of Henry III and his brother, however. In 1259 he incurred Henry's wrath by attempting to subject the royal free chapels in his diocese to episcopal control, a dispute that rumbled on until Meuland's final capitulation in 1281.<br>
<br>On the other hand, Meuland cannot be ranked as one of the episcopal supporters of Simon de Montfort. In July 1263 the king empowered him, with Richard of Gravesend, bishop of Lincoln, and Henry of Sandwich, bishop of London, to reach a settlement with Montfort, but the reimposition of the provisions of Oxford that resulted reflected the realities of the political situation rather than Meuland's own political stance. The latter is seen more clearly in March 1264 when Meuland represented Henry III in the abortive negotiations before the final outbreak of hostilities. He was prepared to co-operate with the subsequent regime of Simon de Montfort&#151;in December 1264 he helped to arrange a temporary settlement with the marcher barons&#151;but he was not one of the bishops suspended from office after the battle of Evesham. Between 1258 and 1272 Meuland, like previous bishops of Coventry and Lichfield, was frequently appointed to be the king's representative in negotiations with the Welsh. After 1272 this and any other political activity ceased. Despite being, as Henry III expressed it, &#145;bound to the king by right of blood [<i>iure sanguinis</i>] before all other prelates of the realm&#146;  (<span class="italic">Close Rolls</span>, 10.486), Meuland appears to have played but a modest part in affairs of state.<br>
<br>As bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, Meuland's record was mixed. In 1282 Archbishop John Peckham, after a visitation of the bishopric, wrote him a blistering letter of criticism. Peckham had discovered the prevalence of incest, an infinite multitude of children lacking confirmation, the appropriation of churches to the great damage of the cure of souls and Meuland himself, &#145;as though not caring about these things and others&#146;, living outside the diocese. Meuland was ordered to appoint a suffragan bishop &#145;knowing the language&#146;  (Martin, 2.479&#150;80), a hint perhaps that Meuland himself (who may have been brought up in France) did not. While there is evidence to support some of Peckham's accusations, especially over appropriations, they were made when Meuland was already a sick man in decline: when he died, on 16 December 1295, he was described as of great age. On the more positive side, Meuland and his officials ordained or enlarged at least five vicarages. He was also the first bishop of Coventry and Lichfield to keep an episcopal register (later lost).<br>
<br>If Meuland did neglect his diocese, he certainly spoke of his &#145;devotion to his spouse, the church of Lichfield&#146;  (Savage, 164) and did much to display it. &#145;For the increase of divine worship&#146; (though also to provide patronage for his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s), he created three new prebends, one endowed with land he himself had acquired. One of his last acts was to issue new statutes governing the conduct of the chapter, which increased the daily provision for each prebendary. Earlier, in 1278, when Meuland permitted the appropriation by Stafford Priory of the church of Stowe by Chartley, he made no stipulation about the creation of a vicarage, but he did obtain an annual pension of 10 marks for the dean and chapter of Lichfield's common fund. Likewise, when he secured an annual pension of 30 marks from the church of Wigan, he assigned 10 marks to the fabric fund of the cathedral and 20 marks to the sacrist, of which half was to be assigned to six boys appointed by the bishop.<br>
<br>The reference to the fabric fund is significant. It was during Meuland's episcopate that the whole of the present nave of Lichfield Cathedral was built, together with the lower part of the great west front. Meuland may have played a significant part in raising funds for the enterprise. He may also have inspired certain elements of the design. In particular, the unique clerestory windows, consisting of three trefoiled circles, were modelled on the external triforium windows of Henry III's Westminster Abbey, perhaps a graceful tribute by Bishop Roger to his royal kinsman. Roger de Meuland's record, both as a political and as a diocesan bishop, was mediocre. As a builder he has at least a claim, albeit an unprovable one, to fame.<br>
