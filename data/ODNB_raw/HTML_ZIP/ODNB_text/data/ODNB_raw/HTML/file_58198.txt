<span class="headword">Wight,  James Alfred</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>James Herriot]</span>  (1916&#150;1995), <span class="occ">writer and veterinarian</span>, was born on 3 October 1916 at 111 Brandling Street, Sunderland, the only child of James Henry Wight (<i>d</i>. 1960), a ship plater and accomplished musician, and Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bell (<i>d</i>. 1981), a talented contralto who sang at local concerts. Alf was born in the house owned by his maternal grandfather, Robert Bell, a printer. Immediately after their marriage, James Henry and Hannah moved to Glasgow, where there was much work for a ship plater in the First World War, but Hannah came back to her parents' home to have the baby. Three weeks later, the family moved permanently to Glasgow.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducation"></a>Early years and education</h2>The first Wight home in Glasgow was a ground-floor flat of a tenement in the suburb of Yoker. Although working-class, the family was far from the bottom rung of the economic ladder and its relatively spacious accommodation was in no way a slum dwelling. An advantage of living in Yoker was that fields and farmlands were within walking distance. James Henry supplemented his income by leading a cinema orchestra, but with the end of the war, shipbuilding slumped and he lost his job at the yard. He went to work as a joiner and later, when Alf was in his teens, opened a fish and chip shop. Hannah, meanwhile, turned a room of the family home into a dressmaker's and remained in the business for thirty years.<br>
<br>Alf Wight attended Yoker primary school, where he loved history, did well in English, but had trouble with arithmetic. Wight entered Hillhead high school, Glasgow, in September 1928. He was an avid reader and an outstanding student, but he also excelled at sports, especially tennis. As a reward for his excellent schoolwork, Wight was given an Irish setter in 1928, the first of a long line of dogs. The following year he read an article in <span class="italic">Meccano Magazine</span> describing the career of a veterinarian. As a dog-lover and as a bright young man considering a possible career, he quickly decided to become an animal doctor. A visit to Glasgow Veterinary College, then under the principalship of Dr A. W. Whitehouse, confirmed Wight in his vocation.<br>
<br>On 29 June 1933, in the midst of the great depression, Wight left high school with a higher education leaving certificate and was qualified for admission to veterinary college when four months short of his seventeenth birthday. College life was a surprise, however. The extracurricular part&#151;gambling, partying, drinking, and playing practical jokes&#151;amazed a young man whose parents seldom drank alcohol and who were very circumspect in their use of language. But Wight was a hard-working student and he was well aware that the cost of tuition and his keep was a burden on his family. Although instruction at Glasgow Veterinary College was out of date and the school was not the premier institution in its field, Wight benefited from hands-on experience.<h2>
<a name="AppointmentatThirskmarriageandwaryears"></a>Appointment at Thirsk, marriage, and war years</h2>On 14 December 1939 Wight qualified as a member of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. He took up his first job in January 1940, serving as assistant to a veterinarian named J. J. McDowall in Sunderland. As it was a temporary position, he continued to look for a more permanent appointment. In June a position with the practice of Donald V. Sinclair became available 50 miles away in Thirsk. Wight was offered a junior partnership with a salary and he arrived in Thirsk on 18 July, and lived above the surgery at 23 Kirkgate. Almost immediately, Sinclair joined the Royal Air Force and departed, leaving Wight to run a practice that primarily treated large animals&#151;horses, cattle, sheep&#151;in an unfamiliar area. Under McDowall, Wight had mainly treated cats and dogs, and indeed his interest was in caring for small animals. Yet he worked hard and learned fast. Sinclair was dismissed from the RAF in November 1940 for having lied about his age. He was nearly thirty and too old for pilot training. However, his expertise with large animals was more valuable for the war effort in helping maintain the precious food supply. Brian Sinclair, Donald Sinclair's younger brother and frequent antagonist, came to live with the bachelors during his summers off from veterinary school. Donald and Brian Sinclair became the models for Siegfried and Tristan Farnon in the Herriot saga and Thirsk was transformed into Darrowby.<br>
<br>At a dance in March 1941 Wight met Joan Catherine Anderson Danbury (1918/19&#150;1999), a secretary. Although he had signed up to join the RAF and knew that eventually he would be called for flight training, Wight proposed in July and was accepted. He and Joan married on 5 November 1941 at St Mary Magdalene Church in Thirsk. The couple's first home was on the top floor of the building that housed the surgery. On 3 October 1942 Wight was finally called for active duty. The long delay reflected the fact that veterinary medicine was a reserved occupation, and Britain had a large number of volunteers for the Royal Air Force. Although Wight trained hard and wanted to fly for Britain, he was absent without leave on more than one occasion so he could visit Joan, who was pregnant with their first child; luckily, he was never caught. On 13 February 1943 he was in Thirsk for the birth of James Alexander Wight.<br>
<br>Wight finally learned to fly and took his first solo flight on 7 June 1943. Shortly afterwards, a medical condition from which he had suffered since youth flared up. After surgery and convalescence, followed by dental problems, he decided to apply for a discharge, and on 10 November 1943 he was sent home. Back in Thirsk, Wight found that the business had grown since his departure. He now wanted a full partnership in the practice, but did not receive it until 1949. The Wights' second and last child, Rosemary Beatrice, was born on 9 May 1949. They finally moved to a house of their own in 1953. Wight had bought a plot of land on Topcliffe Road and had a house built to Joan's specifications.<h2>
<a name="Breakdownandfirstwritings"></a>Breakdown and first writings</h2>The death of Wight's father on 8 April 1960 was a great psychological blow. The two had always been close, as much friends as father and son. At the time Wight was working extremely hard in the practice and worried about money for the children's higher education. He suffered a nervous breakdown, underwent psychiatric treatment, and eventually recovered from his depression with the help of his wife, colleagues, and friends. In 1961 he accepted an assignment as a Ministry of Agriculture veterinarian on a trip to the Soviet Union. He fulfilled the same role in Spain in 1962 and in Istanbul in 1963. As more and more the idea of writing a book about his life as a country vet possessed Wight, he began to write seriously. It seems to have helped him to deal with his depression and even to order, soften, and perhaps idealize his memories. He frequently talked to Joan about it, and finally she scornfully informed him that men nearly fifty did not write books. Stung, Wight set out with determination in 1965 to put on paper the book in his head. After a year and a half he had finished a novel, which was rejected. He was, however, encouraged to recast his material in the form of a memoir. He rewrote the novel as a first-person narrative, a fictionalized autobiography called <span class="italic">If Only they could Talk</span>. After some rejections the book was placed by an agent with Michael Joseph.<br>
<br>Wight was reluctant to use his own name as the author because the Royal Academy of Veterinary Surgeons forbade advertising, and the book could be perceived as such. Watching Birmingham City and Manchester United play football one February evening, Wight hit on the idea of using the name of the Birmingham goalkeeper, James Herriot, as his pen-name. <span class="italic">If Only they could Talk</span> was published in April 1970. It was modestly successful. A sequel, <span class="italic">It shouldn't Happen to a Vet</span>, followed in 1972. Newspaper serialization made the character of James Herriot a familiar figure in Britain. <span class="italic">Let Sleeping Vets Lie</span> appeared in April 1973 and <span class="italic">Vet in Harness</span> the next year. Reviews were good, and paperback sales were enormous.<h2>
<a name="LiterarysuccessandtheHerriotindustry"></a>Literary success and the Herriot industry</h2>In summer 1970 Tom McCormack, the enterprising head of St Martin's Press in New York, was in London looking for books that could rack up significant sales in the US. He was given a copy of <span class="italic">If Only they could Talk</span> and considered publishing it, but it was too short. When he learned that <span class="italic">It shouldn't Happen to a Vet</span> had also been published, he was even more interested. The two books together would make a more marketable book in the States. He got Wight to add chapters about Herriot's wedding and they hit on the perfect title for the American publication&#151;a line from the hymn &#145;All things bright and beautiful&#146;&#151;<span class="italic">All Creatures Great and Small</span>. The book was published in November 1972 and with McCormack's marketing campaign, the reviews were outstanding. In February 1973 Wight was brought to America twice for successful book tours.<br>
<br>Alf Wight, as James Herriot, had become the most famous veterinarian in the world. His gentle, humorous, compassionate stories set in a somewhat remote place and a distant time had captured the imagination of an enormous number of readers. Mainly through reworking episodes from the memoirs, a Herriot industry was constructed with books about cats and dogs; delightful children's books; <span class="italic">James Herriot's Yorkshire</span> (1979), a photo-travel book; and <span class="italic">The Best of James Herriot</span> (1982). But the Herriot saga's greatest success was in film and television. First came a motion picture shot in 1974, <span class="italic">All Creatures Great and Small</span>, with Simon Ward as Herriot and Anthony Hopkins as Siegfried. <span class="italic">It shouldn't Happen to a Vet</span> with John Alderton and Colin Blakely was filmed in 1975. In 1977 Wight bought the house in Thirlby that was to be his last home. In that year the BBC began filming the television series <span class="italic">All Creatures Great and Small</span>, starring Christopher Timothy and Robert Hardy. Four series and forty-one episodes appeared over thirteen years.<br>
<br>Although the stories are part fiction, the life of James Herriot was not so different from that of his creator. Both were healers of animals and both had gentle, self-deprecating senses of humour. Of medium height and weight, Wight had a ruddy complexion, high forehead, and light brown, somewhat wavy hair that turned a silvery white as he aged. In 1979 he was appointed OBE and in that same year received an honorary DLitt from Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh. Wight was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons in 1982 and was awarded an honorary DVSc from Liverpool University in 1983. In 1992 he was the British Veterinary Association's first recipient of the Chiron award, designed to acknowledge exceptional achievement in the field.<br>
<br>James Alfred Wight died of cancer at Mire Beck, Thirlby, on 23 February 1995. In 1999 Jim Wight published the authorized biography of his father, <span class="italic">The Real James Herriot</span>. Thirsk, the town known to millions of viewers worldwide as Darrowby, remains a tourist destination. &#145;Skeldale House&#146; at number 23 Kirkgate, restored to how it was in the 1940s, has become a museum of veterinary science, while the region of north Yorkshire in which it lies is still known as Herriot Country.<br>
