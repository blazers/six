<span class="headword">Catterick <span class="st"> [Ketterich]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1419), <span class="occ">bishop of Coventry and Lichfield</span>, was from Yorkshire, quite likely from near the North Riding village. His immediate origins are unknown, but in his will he remembered two sisters, Matilda and Margaret, and also the latter's two daughters. Robert Catterick, to whom he gave a prebend in Lichfield Cathedral, was his nephew and inherited all his books. John Catterick was master of arts of Oxford by 1398, bachelor of both laws by 1401, and licentiate in canon law by 1406. Evidently he impressed his fellow student, Bishop Henry Beaufort of Lincoln, and had entered his service by 14 January 1400. His preferment came entirely from the bishop, notably as treasurer of the cathedral on 21 March 1403. When Beaufort was translated to Winchester, Catterick went with him as his chancellor in 1405, still holding this post in September 1408 when he made a visitation of the cathedral. He and Beaufort moved the emphasis of his preferments to Winchester too, notably as archdeacon of Surrey on 12 November 1410.<br>
<br>Although Catterick was called &#145;king's clerk&#146; on 2 March 1403, this was simply for a visitation of a hospital in the king's jurisdiction. It was the need for the king to justify his execution of Archbishop Richard Scrope, and control the consequent vacancy at York, that elevated Catterick's career from local to national; while Archbishop Thomas Arundel was aghast, Henry's Beaufort kin rallied round: on 3 July 1405 Catterick set off &#145;in all haste&#146; to help defend the king's position in the Roman curia, returning to London only on 3 February 1406. Beaufort then had him included in his own mission to Calais, from 26 March to 22 May 1406; from 6 October to 23 December he was touring trading centres in Germany and the Low Countries; and until October 1411 he was often engaged in lengthy embassies to France to try to keep the truce with France or turn it into something more secure. Possibly his continuing association with Beaufort in both diplomacy and diocese reduced his attraction to Henry IV at that point, but on 18 April 1412 he was preparing to go abroad once more, reason unspecified. On 1 July 1409 he had been appointed as a papal notary, not in itself demanding attendance in the curia but a signal that he had made his mark, and in 1413 was referred to as a notary in the papal chancery. More to the point, on 22 May 1413 the new king, Henry V, who had made Beaufort chancellor immediately after his accession, appointed Catterick his permanent proctor to the Roman curia.<br>
<br>On 27 April 1414 Catterick was papally provided to the see of St David's, was consecrated by John XXIII, perhaps at Bologna, and received the temporalities on 2 June. In a rare moment of public candour, the pope allowed him to retain some of his benefices until a &#145;fatter&#146; see could be found for him. This became possible that same week, although distance meant the appointment to Coventry and Lichfield took time; he was elected by the chapter (perhaps on 23 July), received custody of the temporalities on 13 October, and was translated formally on 1 February 1415. Meanwhile, on 20 October 1414 he was appointed one of the king's representatives at the Council of Constance. He took part there in the deposition of his recent host, John XXIII, as one of the commissaries to take evidence against him. Shortly after 23 May 1415 he left for England, with a commission to collect papal revenues, but really to consult with his principals. He was home in time to receive French envoys at Winchester on 4 July and act as a witness to Henry V's will at Southampton on the 24th.<br>
<br>On 20 July 1416 Catterick was reappointed by the king as a proctor at Constance, although his commission on 5 August to discuss the council with the duke of Burgundy probably delayed his journey. On 21 December he had a wide commission to seek trading opportunities with Aragon, Genoa, the Hanse, and German princes, probably through contacts at Constance. On 18 July 1417 he was named by the king as one of the five bishops who were to direct all English delegates at the council, enabling Henry to control the vote of this &#145;nation&#146;. The day after the death of Bishop Robert Hallum at Constance on 4 September, Cardinal des Ursins wrote to the king recommending Catterick for the vacancy at Salisbury, noting the judgment and learning he had shown during the council. In fact, because of the vacancy in the papacy and the king's absence in France, John Chaundler, the innocuous dean of Salisbury, had the promotion by election and without papal provision; possibly Archbishop Henry Chichele, no friend to Beaufort, had a hand in this peculiarity. Meantime Thomas Polton, another of the English bishops at the council, had met Beaufort at Ulm and brought him to Constance. There Beaufort dramatically swung the English delegation and, in turn, the whole council to making an election of a pope and in effect ending its own existence. Catterick then went with Martin V in early 1418 into Italy in his former role as king's proctor, and was with him, for example, on 5 May 1419 at Mantua. In the previous month he had been authorized to take all Normans in the curia into Henry V's obedience. It emerged years later that he had also been working and paying out money to gain Beaufort a personal and diocesan exemption from the jurisdiction of the archbishop of Canterbury, which would have outraged Chichele and Henry V, had it come to pass.<br>
<br>On 20 November 1419 he was elected to the see of Exeter, with royal assent. However, on 28 December he died at Florence, where the papal curia had been staying since February. In accordance with a codicil to his will, he was buried in the Franciscan church of Santa Croce there, in the centre of the nave near the choir. After some pious bequests to a few kin and of twelve cups to Beaufort, his residual estate went especially to &#145;poor land labourers who have lost animals by murrain and are otherwise depressed by misfortune&#146;  (<span class="italic">Register of Henry Chichele</span>, 2.179), especially on his own estates. He had probably never seen these people. Just possibly he may have managed a brief visit to his Lichfield diocese in 1416, but he had always left the administration to deputies. It is unsurprising that he expressed no wish for burial there.<br>
