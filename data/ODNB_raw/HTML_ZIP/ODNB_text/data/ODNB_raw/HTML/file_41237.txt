<span class="headword">Rowntree,  Joshua</span>  (1844&#150;1915), <span class="occ">social reformer</span>, was born on 6 April 1844 at Princess Street, Scarborough, the fourth of the five children of John Rowntree (1788&#150;1845), grocer, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Priestman (1807&#150;1880). In 1860, on leaving Bootham School, York, he was articled to a solicitor in that city, subsequently practising from 1866 to 1886 in Scarborough. He married on 22 September 1880 Isabella Ann Tindall (1843&#150;1929): there was one child, the social worker Maurice L. Rowntree (1882&#150;1944).<br>
<br>Rowntree's interventions in municipal affairs were often unpopular: nevertheless he was chosen as mayor in 1885, relinquishing the position to stand as Liberal candidate in the 1886 parliamentary election. He entered the Commons as MP for Scarborough with his brother-in-law John Edward Ellis (1841&#150;1910): though almost as unlike as possible in temperament and tastes, the tie between them was particularly close for there was underlying unity of aim. Rowntree was a firm home-ruler, visited Ireland on several occasions, and earned a tribute from John Dillon. He was also a temperance reformer and a vigorous supporter of the social purity campaign of Josephine Butler (1828&#150;1906). He consistently attacked the opium traffic, and when a royal commission (1893&#150;5) presented a report demonstrating the impossibility of stopping the trade between India and China he set to work patiently and painstakingly to examine its conclusions, which he confuted in <span class="italic">The Imperial Drug Trade</span> (1905); he lived to see his judgement accepted and acted upon.<br>
<br>Defeated at Scarborough in the 1892 election, Rowntree &#145;gave himself with whole heart and mind to the modern interpretation of Quakerism&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Monitor</span>, 130). He took a quiet (sometimes underestimated, but indisputably effective) part in enabling British Friends to come to terms with scientific discoveries and biblical criticism and with shaking off outdated customs&#151;notably through the Manchester conference (1895), Scarborough summer school (1897), and the establishment in 1903 of a study centre at Woodbrooke, Birmingham, of which he and Isabella were the first wardens. He did not take part in leading Quaker worship until beyond middle life: his gift in the ministry was recorded by Pickering and Hull monthly meeting in 1896.<br>
<br>Rowntree was known in Scarborough simply as Joshua (accented by many on the last vowel). He was well versed in geology, botany, archaeology, and history, a lover of the moors and of the sea: he knew how to sail a boat in all weathers, he was at home with the fisherfolk and they with him, and in the last summer of his life he was rowing visitors with boyish enthusiasm. It was this breadth of interest and his ability to draw out the shy that made him so successful an adult school teacher.<br>
<br>Rowntree and his wife visited Friends' missions in Palestine and Syria in 1899. Concern for peace and conciliation led, in the South African War, to his promoting a meeting at Scarborough (March 1900) to be addressed by S. J. Cronwright Schreiner (1863&#150;1936): this resulted in mob violence against the Rowntree families and property. With his wife and nephew Harold T. Ellis (1875&#150;1930) he visited South Africa between December 1900 and April 1901 to investigate possible Quaker relief work, particularly in the concentration camps. Among contacts made was &#145;an Indian barrister, Mr Gandhi&#146;  (Hewison, 163), who spoke to him of the demoralizing conditions to which all Asian people were subjected. In 1902&#150;3 he and his wife, who were part of a deputation on behalf of British Quakers to Friends in Australia and New Zealand, visited American Friends on their way home. Rowntree died at the home of his sister, Maria Ellis (1845&#150;1941), at Wrea Head, Scalby, on 10 February 1915; his body was interred two days later in Scarborough cemetery.<br>
