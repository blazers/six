<span class="headword">McCulloch,  George</span>  (1848&#150;1907), <span class="occ">mine owner and art collector</span>, was born on 23 April 1848 in Lanark, the youngest child in the family of four sons and one daughter of James McCulloch (1797&#150;1849), a road contractor, and his wife, Isabella Robertson. He was educated at Glasgow high school and Anderson's University, Glasgow. He travelled in Mexico and South America to study farming before, in the 1870s, deciding to seek his fortune in Australia. Here his cousin, Sir James McCulloch, a politician in Victoria, appointed him manager of a large sheep station, Mount Gipps, near Broken Hill, giving him an eighth share in the business. It was at Broken Hill that Charles Rasp discovered large deposits of silver in 1883: McCulloch thus became a member of the syndicate owning the mine, and went to London to raise more capital in 1885. He later rose to be manager and chairman of the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, and thanks to this, and other investments in west Australian goldfields, became enormously rich, a multi-millionaire by Victorian standards.<br>
<br>There is an enduring legend that McCulloch won the Broken Hill mine in a game of penny nap with another miner. The truth is more prosaic: McCulloch already owned a share in the syndicate, and he acquired a further fourteenth share in a game of euchre (an American card game resembling whist) with an English prospector. He is described as &#145;large in build &hellip; [a man who] delighted in feats of strength and practical jokes&#146;  (<span class="italic">AusDB</span>). McCulloch was portrayed by contemporaries as a self-made man, but his background was respectable, middle class, and educated.<br>
<br>In 1893 McCulloch returned to Britain, and on 11 May at the Strand register office he married Mary Agnes Mayger (1857&#150;1945), the widowed daughter of a miner, William Smith. He promptly set about acquiring the trappings of wealth and social position, buying a large house at 184 Queen's Gate, London, to which he added several large galleries, and thereafter devoting himself to forming a major collection of modern art. His adviser was David Croal Thomson, who was an art dealer, connoisseur, and critic: he was editor of the prestigious <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, and a director of the Goupil Gallery, and later Agnews, but at the time such a combination of roles was not considered to represent a conflict of interests.<br>
<br>In little over ten years McCulloch spent more than &pound;200,000, buying over 300 pictures. His taste was conventional, and he preferred narrative pictures and landscapes, both English and French. He was, however, a friend of J. S. Sargent, and acquired pictures by him and by Whistler and Orpen. He also admired the works of Scottish artists, such as William Quiller Orchardson, John Pettie, David Murray, and John Lavery. McCulloch's collection was certainly one of the most remarkable late Victorian accumulations, and among its stars were major works by Millais, Leighton, G. F. Watts, Burne-Jones, J. W. Waterhouse, and George Clausen. These included <span class="italic">Sir Isumbras at the Ford</span> by Millais (Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight), <span class="italic">The Garden of the Hesperides</span> and <span class="italic">The Daphnephoria</span> by Leighton (also both Lady Lever Art Gallery), <span class="italic">Fata Morgana</span> by Watts, <span class="italic">Saint Cecilia</span> and <span class="italic">Ophelia</span> by Waterhouse, and <span class="italic">Love among the Ruins</span> (Wightwick Manor) and <span class="italic">The Wedding of Psyche</span> (Museum of Modern Art, Brussels) by Burne-Jones. McCulloch also bought one of the sets of <span class="roman">Holy Grail</span> tapestries designed by Burne-Jones for Morris &amp; Co.<br>
<br>McCulloch died on 12 December 1907 at 184 Queen's Gate, leaving an estate of &pound;436,000. In 1909 his collection was shown at the Royal Academy winter exhibition, arousing considerable controversy: the academy was accused of commercialism in exhibiting a private collection which was about to be sold. Eventually McCulloch's collection was dispersed in 1913 at a series of sales at Christies, from 23 to 30 May. The 326 lots made a total of &pound;136,859, showing a poor return on McCulloch's investment. A major buyer at the sale was William Lever, first Lord Leverhulme, later the founder of the Lady Lever Art Gallery. In 1909 McCulloch's widow married the Scottish artist James Coutts Michie (1861&#150;1919). During the First World War 184 Queen's Gate became a hospital, known as the Michie Hospital, and in 1920 Mary Coutts Michie was made CBE for her war work. She returned to Broken Hill in 1925 and later lived in Cobham, Surrey, where she died on 29 November 1945.<br>
