<span class="headword">Clarke,  John Smith</span>  (1885&#150;1959), <span class="occ">politician, lion-tamer, and newspaper editor</span>, was born on 4 February 1885 at 66 Albert Street, Jarrow, co. Durham, the thirteenth child of John Smith Clarke, circus entertainer, and his wife, Sally Ann Chiswell, who came from Gypsy stock. Only seven of the children survived childhood, and poverty stalked the family. Clarke's father relied on casual work, interspersed with spells of unemployment, which necessitated travelling about Britain in search of employment. As a consequence, his son John received little formal education.<br>
<br>Clarke was proud that his family had been pioneers of the circus, performing in the open air before there was a giant top. He boasted that he was the country's youngest lion-tamer, starting in the ring when he was seventeen, and continuing almost until his death. His body had many scars, inflicted by wild animals, that testified to his labours. Eager for adventure and new experiences, Clarke spent some years as a sailor. In a series of autobiographical articles later published in the <span class="italic">Sunday Mail</span> under the title &#145;Roughing it round the world&#146; he described witnessing a crew member killing a mate, being stuck on a sandbank off the German coast, and gun-running to Russian revolutionaries. On one occasion he jumped ship in Durban and started hitch-hiking from South Africa back to Tyneside. Along with his fund of fascinating stories he acquired, in a haphazard manner, an immense knowledge of a range of subjects. This gave him an entry to the world of writing and lecturing. He married Sarah Millicent Balkind before 1911; they had one son.<br>
<br>Opposed to what he saw as the dull conformity and poverty of contemporary society, Clarke became a fervent socialist. He edited <span class="italic">The Socialist</span> and contributed to other left-wing journals, including <span class="italic">Forward</span>, <span class="italic">Plebs</span>, and the <span class="italic">Reform Journal</span>. In the First World War, he was lucky not to be imprisoned for strongly expressed anti-war writings. He joined the so-called &#145;flying corps&#146;, flying away from the police and military to avoid arrest. Many of his poems became well known among the disenchanted workers of Clydeside.<br>
<br>In 1920 Scottish shop stewards elected Clarke as their delegate to the Second Congress of the Communist International. After accomplishing a hazardous journey, going up into the Arctic circle and then through the front lines in the civil war, he eventually reached Moscow. There he met leading Bolsheviks, including Lenin, whose dog he cured of an ailment. On his way back from Russia, he was arrested. Escaping from his captors, he took a boat and single-handedly navigated it across the North Sea. Though impressed by the Soviet Union, Clarke did not consider Bolshevik methods could be applied en bloc in Britain. Nor did he believe in hero-worship of Lenin or Stalin. For these reasons he never joined the Communist Party. Clarke gave a vivid account of his Russian visit in <span class="italic">Pen Pictures of Russia under the &#145;Red Terror&#146;</span> (1921).<br>
<br>Clarke's politics became more moderate in the late 1920s. He joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and served on Glasgow city council. Proud of public enterprise, in 1928 he wrote a pamphlet extolling the new municipal Loch Katrine Reservoir. In 1929, standing for the ILP he was elected MP for Glasgow Maryhill; but parliament was not congenial to him and in his two years there almost all he seems to have done was to enliven proceedings with scurrilous poems and pranks. On one occasion he persuaded twenty other MPs to join him aboard the airship R101; on the next voyage it crashed, killing forty-five passengers and crew. An extremely vivid and entertaining speaker, at the height of his popularity he could fill a cinema for one of his lectures.<br>
<br>One of Clarke's infuriating amusements was penning mock epitaphs of his fellow MPs. His victims included Ramsay MacDonald, singled out for this treatment at the time of his departure from the Labour Party in August 1931; the piece was later published  (<span class="italic">Bulletin of the Society for Labour History</span>, 27, 1973, 35). Clarke stood again for Maryhill in the 1931 election, but was defeated, and in 1932 he left the ILP when it disaffiliated from the Labour Party. Thereafter he was active only in local politics, serving again on Glasgow city council from 1941 to 1951.<br>
<br>In his later years Clarke was increasingly occupied with the arts in Scotland. By 1925 he was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. He later became an expert on early primitive and Renaissance art, and was involved with the purchase by Glasgow corporation of the famous Morten portrait of Mary queen of Scots. He served as a member of the Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland, and from 1930 to 1933 was a trustee of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. A magistrate, he also was a member of the Clyde Navigation Trust and of the board of government of Glasgow School of Art.<br>
<br>Because of his encyclopaedic knowledge of Scotland, Clarke was often consulted as an authority, while among the young he acquired popularity on the <span class="italic">Scottish Daily Express</span>, writing as Uncle Mac of the Sachel Club. His many writings included <span class="italic">Satires, Lyrics and Poems</span> (1919), <span class="italic">Robert Burns and his Politics</span> (1921), and a lucid exposition of historical materialism, <span class="italic">Marxism and History</span> (1938).<br>
<br>Clarke lived in a small rented house in the Ibrox area of Glasgow. There he kept his large collection of antiques and curios, including Marie Antoinette's snuff-box, Harry Lauder's walking-stick, a signed photograph of Lenin addressed &#145;To Comrade Clarke, Vladimir Oulianoff 6.8.1920&#146;, and an array of torture instruments. He died on 30 January 1959 at the Southern General Hospital, 1301 Govan Road, Glasgow. His wife predeceased him.<br>
