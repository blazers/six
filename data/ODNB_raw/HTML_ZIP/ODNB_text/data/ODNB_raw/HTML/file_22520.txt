<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Poole,  (Reginald) Stuart</span>  (1832&#150;1895), <span class="occ">numismatist and Egyptologist</span>, born in London on 27 February 1832, was the younger son of Edward Richard Poole (<i>c</i>.1805&#150;1884), bibliophile and vicar of Alvaston, Derbyshire (1846&#150;84), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22522/', "Sophia Lane Poole (1804&#150;1891)")</script>, sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15990/', "Edward William Lane")</script>. From July 1842 to October 1849 he lived with his mother and her brother in Cairo, where his education was directed by Lane and by the Revd G. S. Cautley. He began at an early age to study ancient Egypt, examining private collections in Cairo and Alexandria and twice travelling up the Nile. Before he was seventeen he contributed a series of articles to the <span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span>, which were republished in 1851 as <span class="italic">Horae Aegyptiacae, or, The Chronology of Ancient Egypt</span>, under the patronage of Algernon Percy, fourth duke of Northumberland. The duke was a trustee of the British Museum, and through his influence Poole was appointed a first-class assistant (lower section) in the department of antiquities (26 February 1852). In 1858 the museum's trustees discovered that only three printed catalogues of the coin collection existed&#151;the most recent dated 1826&#151;and directed that a complete catalogue be made, beginning with the Greek coins, which at that time, with the Roman series, were the most valuable part of the collection. Poole, who had dealt with this series, was asked to undertake the work. When the department was divided in 1861 on the retirement of the keeper of antiquities, Edward Hawkins, Poole was assigned to the new department of coins and medals, with the more senior Samuel Birch becoming keeper of the department of oriental antiquities (which included Egyptian antiquities). Poole's career would therefore be as a numismatist, although his private interest in Egypt persisted. He was promoted to the upper section of the first class on 11 November 1865 and assistant keeper (deputy to the keeper) on 4 July 1866. Following the resignation of W. S. W. Vaux he succeeded as keeper on 29 October 1870. On 6 August 1861 he had married Eliza Christina Forlonge, daughter of William Forlonge. She survived him, as did three of their four children.<br>
<br>Poole was an energetic keeper. He was the driving force in the production of British Museum catalogues of Greek coins, which still remain the standard reference set, and whose publication is the foundation-stone of modern Greek numismatics. In 1873 he published the first volume (on Italy), which was followed by three further volumes (Syria, 1878; Ptolemies, 1883; Roman Egypt, 1892). More importantly, between 1873 and 1894 (in collaboration with Barclay Head, Percy Gardner, and Warwick Wroth) he worked on and edited seventeen volumes of a total of over thirty produced during his keepership, a quite remarkable achievement. His energy was felt in other areas such as his involvement in the catalogues of Anglo-Saxon coins (1887, 1893), of Swiss coins from the Townshend collection, then in the South Kensington Museum (1878), and of the shahs of Persia (1887). Eager to make the collections generally accessible, he introduced exhibitions of electrotypes and subsequently original coins and medals in the public galleries, for which popular guides were written by his staff.<br>
<br>From 1879 Poole urged the necessity of constructing a new medal room above the Lycian gallery, a project which was achieved in 1894. Outside his official work, he wrote articles on Greek, Arabic, Persian, and other coins in the <span class="italic">Numismatic Chronicle</span> and in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Royal Society of Literature</span>, and lectured frequently. During his keepership the collection expanded rapidly. The Wigan collection of Roman coins was purchased in 1872, although the Treasury's insistence that the museum repay its cost made it difficult to purchase other major collections which subsequently came on to the market. Poole did, however, acquire the south Indian series of Sir Walter Elliot and, by purchase and bequest from Sir Alexander Cunningham, &#145;the finest collection of Indian and Bactrian coins ever got together by any collector&#146;  (British Museum officers' reports, 29 Nov 1887). He successfully negotiated the transfer to the museum of the numismatic collections of the Bank of England (1877) and the India Office (1882).<br>
<br>Poole's essentially amateur writings on Egyptology have endured less well than his numismatic scholarship. Some of his essays were collected in 1882 as <span class="italic">Cities of Egypt</span>. He contributed numerous articles to Smith's <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Bible</span> (from 1860) and to the eighth and ninth editions of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. He read papers on Egyptian subjects before the Royal Asiatic Society and the Royal Society of Literature, and was an occasional reviewer in <span class="italic">The Academy</span>. In 1869 he was sent by the museum to report on antiquities at Cyprus and also to Alexandria on the death of A. C. Harris, a trip that resulted in the purchase of the Lang collection of antiquities and coins discovered at Idalion and the Harris collection of Egyptian antiquities and papyri. In 1883&#150;5 Poole was appointed to lecture on Greek, Egyptian, and medallic art at the Royal Academy, and in 1889 he succeeded Sir Charles Newton as Yates professor of archaeology at University College, London. His principal contribution to Egyptology came in 1882, when at her urging he joined <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8529/', "Amelia B. Edwards")</script> in founding the Egypt Exploration Fund to promote excavation and study of ancient Egypt, after Samuel Birch had refused to become involved in this project. Poole and his wife developed a strong friendship with Miss Edwards. His involvement gave the fund the British Museum's support and some facilities, although as the fund's activities became centred round Poole's department, this led to criticisms that it was being run from Bloomsbury.<br>
<br>Poole devoted most of his spare time and energy to the fund, and was its honorary secretary (1882&#150;5) and later its vice-president (1885&#150;95). Many of his decisions are in retrospect considered misguided, such as favouring Edouard Naville over the more meticulous archaeologist Flinders Petrie. His relations with the latter were for a time cool, after Petrie had blamed Poole for the fund's poor administration, which was largely owing to Poole's being seriously overworked. Poole's relations with Birch also deteriorated and he seems never to have overcome his disappointment at losing the oriental keepership: he deplored Birch's emphasis on Assyriology, and in 1885 wrote that he had &#145;blocked out the only possible Englishman who could succeed him&#146;  (Egypt Exploration Society IIIg158, 31 Dec 1885). Poole founded, in conjunction with the artist Professor Alphonse Legros, in 1885 the Society of English Medallists, in the hope of reviving the design and production of cast medals. In 1876 he was elected a correspondent of the Acad&eacute;mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres of the Institut Fran&ccedil;ais and in 1880 he received the honorary degree of LLD at Cambridge. On 31 January 1893 he retired from the British Museum and in 1894 he resigned his professorship because of failing health. He died of heart disease on 8 February 1895 at his home, 2 Gledstanes Road, West Kensington.<br>
