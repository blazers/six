<span class="headword">Lawrie, Sir  Archibald Campbell</span>  (1837&#150;1914), <span class="occ">lawyer and antiquary</span>, was born on 8 September 1837 in West Nile Street, Glasgow, the eldest son of John Adair Lawrie (1801&#150;1859), surgeon and professor of surgery at the University of Glasgow, and his wife, Janet Finlay, of The Moss, Stirlingshire. He was educated at the University of Glasgow, where he graduated BA in 1856, and was admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates in December 1860. At about this time he moved to Edinburgh. Lawrie was active in the Speculative Society at Edinburgh University, holding the offices of secretary and president in the early 1860s.<br>
<br>Lawrie was introduced through family connections to Cosmo Innes (1798&#150;1874), an antiquary of medieval Scotland, and was therefore brought into contact with the movement&#151;particularly associated with publishing clubs such as the Bannatyne and Maitland clubs&#151;responsible for gathering, editing, and publishing early Scottish records. As Lawrie put it later, he did not know if he had been attracted to record scholarship and antiquities by Innes or the reverse. The fruit of his close working relationship with Innes was their compilation, with another advocate, Archibald Anderson, of the great index to the eleven volumes of <span class="italic">The Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland</span>. This appeared in 1875 and crowned an enterprise begun in the early part of the century by the pioneering record scholar Thomas Thomson and completed by Cosmo Innes.<br>
<br>While in practice at the bar Lawrie acted on several occasions as interim sheriff-substitute at Glasgow, Greenock, and Peebles. In 1873, shortly before the completion of the index, Lawrie was appointed, on the recommendation of Lord Advocate George Young, as district judge of Kandy, Ceylon. The ingrained sceptical turn of his nature, which was held to be a mark of his historical work, was also reportedly a feature of Lawrie's judicial practice, together with a patient approach to investigation and unfailing good humour. The latter could sometimes run to &#145;playful&#146; sarcasm. Residence in Ceylon did not mean, however, an abandonment of his work as a compiler. <span class="italic">A Gazetteer of the Central Province of Ceylon</span> (1896), a descriptive miscellany with translations of source material about his jurisdiction, marks Lawrie's continuing interest in such work even while overseas. In 1880 he married Constance, daughter of John Dennistoun and widow of John W. Hamilton. She died in 1890.<br>
<br>Lawrie remained in Kandy until his appointment as senior puisne judge of the supreme court of Ceylon in 1892, at which time he moved to Colombo. During his time there he met and entertained many of the dignitaries of empire, including Edward, prince of Wales, and Prince George. From this position he retired in 1901 and was knighted in the same year.<br>
<br>During the last part of his life Lawrie earned a leading reputation in his own right as a collector, editor, and critic of early Scottish records. He chose on his return to Scotland to settle at The Moss, Dumgoyne, Stirlingshire, the ancient home of the Buchanan family, from whom he claimed descent. The house, which he had inherited from his uncle William Finlay, was a good setting for work on his plan to make a critical study of the early reigns in Scottish history, beginning with David I. In 1906 Lawrie played host to the &#145;pilgrimage&#146; made to The Moss to mark the quatercentenary of George Buchanan, tutor to James VI. He did not, however, contribute to the accompanying volume and was generally reported to be averse to speech making, essay writing, and reviewing.<br>
<br>In 1905 Lawrie, in accordance with his scheme, published <span class="italic">Early Scottish Charters Prior to <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 1153</span>. He used annals, charters, and cartularies, and the result was less a narrative than a collection of texts with extensive annotation of each document. Although not always accurately transcribed, the documents in this work became essential for historians of Scotland because of the void in pre-fourteenth century Scottish records caused by Edward I's removal of documents to England in 1291. Lawrie's zeal for caution was a hallmark of his work. George Neilson commented that he was &#145;a constitutional doubter, but generous enough in his admission of his own occasional error&#146;  (Neilson, 247). Even this description may have been too lenient, as is suggested by Lawrie's refusal to believe new documentary evidence in support of the authenticity of the Scone foundation charter of 1120, which he had denied. This aside, he avoided generalizations and ethnological inferences, and concentrated his interest on chronology, genealogy, and cross-examination of individual sources. In the same year (1905) as this work was published, Lawrie received recognition from his alma mater in the form of an LLD from Glasgow University.<br>
<br>A change in his plan was revealed by the publication in 1910 of his second major work, <span class="italic">Annals of the reigns of Malcolm and William, kings of Scotland, <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 1153&#150;1214</span>. In this the annals appeared and were edited separately, and were intended to be followed by the charters. This intention was not to be fulfilled, but after his death Lawrie's material was put in the hands of John Maitland Thomson, who had given him valuable help and to whom the volume of 1910 had been dedicated. It was later deposited in the Advocates' Library in Edinburgh. Lawrie died at The Moss on 11 May 1914 of a heart-related illness and was buried on 15 May in the parish church graveyard at nearby Killearn.<br>
