<span class="headword">Macdonell,  James</span>  (1841&#150;1879), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 21 April 1841 at Dyce, Aberdeenshire, and baptized there on 2 May, the eldest son of James Macdonell (1810&#150;1858) of the Glengarry Macdonells and Rachel Allardyce. His father was a Roman Catholic and his mother a protestant. An exceptionally bright scholar in local parish schools in Dufftown and Rhynie, the death of his father in 1858 forced Macdonell from Bell's school, Inverness, into a clerkship at Messrs Piries' paper mills. He also doubled as an excise officer, his father's former occupation. Already a precocious book reviewer, in 1858 Macdonell was introduced to the mysteries of newspapers at the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Free Press</span>, an advanced organ of political Liberalism. Here, as a leader writer in embryo, he formulated the main studies of his life: ecclesiastical controversies and church dialectics. He became a lifelong passionate Francophile, admiring French literature, history, and character.<br>
<br>Noted as an intensely earnest young man, easily carried away by his subject but blessed by a brilliant literary style, in 1862 Macdonell moved to the notoriously sectarian Edinburgh <span class="italic">Daily Review</span>. After less than a year he saw himself as &#145;pitchforked &hellip; at a ridiculously early age&#146;  (Nicoll, 97) into the editorship of the <span class="italic">Northern Daily Express</span> in Newcastle at &pound;150 per annum. Circulation rose rapidly, but a buy-out by William Saunders in 1865 hastened his departure to Fleet Street. Macdonell had reacted fiercely to the decision to use syndicated news (including leaders, his own province), which had resulted in the paper's politics coming from London daily by train, in a box. In a letter to William McCombie dated 1 May 1865, the youthful editor objected to the London establishment owned by Saunders where<blockquote>a staff of journalists prepare the news of the day, and write leaders on the principal current topics. The matter thus obtained is put in type; then stereotyped &hellip; and then the blocks are sent by afternoon train to Plymouth, Hull, and other places in which the firm have papers of their own. &hellip; Not one single leading article will be written in this office. &hellip; For Mr Saunders thinks &hellip; that it is not the duty of a journalist to write strongly, or to commit his paper to the advocacy of any opinion or any principle. (Nicoll, 108&#150;9)</blockquote>Aged twenty-four, Macdonell reluctantly declined a senior post on <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> and thus sacrificed certain Scottish prominence in favour of an assistant editorship on the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>. Thanks to his friend Hugh Gilzean Reid (1836&#150;1911), the northern newspaper magnate, he secured the position of &#145;confidential helper&#146; to Edward Levy (1833&#150;1916), a son of the principal proprietor. His first article in a national daily appeared on 8 July 1865, inevitably on a Scottish topic. Well-versed in philosophy and church history, Macdonell brought a real highland charge to the <span class="italic">Telegraph</span> from 1865 to 1875. Numbered by Matthew Arnold among the &#145;magnificent roaring of the young lions&#146; of that paper  (Nicoll, 199), his cogently argued leaders best met the needs of the day, perceived as perfectly formed literary gems in essay form. In addition to visits to war-threatened Paris in 1870 and 1871, he was at this time writing six leaders a week for his editor, another for the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span>, and one for the <span class="italic">Levant Herald</span>.<br>
<br>Eager to find the widest possible recognition Macdonell, after a trial period beginning 26 March 1875 as a leader writer on <span class="italic">The Times</span>, parted from the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> on 4 July of that year, moving immediately to Printing House Square. Within five days he brought his graceful literary style, scholarship, keen analysis, and cultural breadth to topics as diverse as Burma, Spain, Russia, Canada, and ironclad warships. Now the consummate journalist enjoying a European audience, occasionally Macdonell's pronounced radicalism proved intrusive. His powerful material on current affairs, moral theories, and religious trends in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>, and the <span class="italic">North British Review</span> between 1865 and 1873 had no place in &#145;The Thunderer&#146;. But, unlike his previous employers whose edict against journalistic freedom was absolute, the editorial diaries kept by J. T. Delane reveal how leading articles were assigned to the writers best inclined to debate and liberal expression. Not always, however, was he in harmony with the paper's direction. Most notably, Gladstone's handling of the eastern question found sympathetic support from Macdonell, ardent to commit <span class="italic">The Times</span> to a pro-Russian line. An irate Delane had to curtail a much needed holiday with the prince of Wales at Dunrobin Castle in October 1876 to telegraph that his chief foreign affairs writer should be &#145;shunted to safer topics&#146;  (Nicoll, 294).<br>
<br>Macdonell married Anna Jemima, daughter of Daniel Harrison, on 22 August 1871 in Beckenham, Kent; they had three sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34713/', "Sir Philip James Macdonell")</script>. Her sister, Agnes, in 1873 married his younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34712/', "Sir John Macdonell (1845&#150;1921)")</script>, a barrister and useful contributor concurrently to <span class="italic">The Times</span> on legal and philosophical subjects. Macdonell died suddenly at his home, 78 Gower Street, London, on 2 March 1879, widely revered by his contemporaries in the media and politics. Even when ill, in the year running up to his death he wrote often for days without a break on French politics, and his posthumous volume of collected essays, <span class="italic">France since the First Empire</span> (1879), edited by his politically aware and articulate wife, admirably summarizes his power of expression and high culture. He was buried on 6 March in Beckenham, Kent.<br>
