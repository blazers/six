<span class="headword">Freeman,  (Thomas) Walter</span>  (1908&#150;1988), <span class="occ">geographer</span>, was born on 27 December 1908 in Congleton, Cheshire, the eldest of the three children of Thomas Ernest Freeman (1872&#150;1957), a Methodist minister, and his wife, Mary Gibson (<i>c</i>.1875&#150;1960). The family moved frequently, and lived variously in Colwyn Bay (1909&#150;12), Great Yarmouth (1912&#150;15), Creswell, Derbyshire (1915&#150;19), Nantwich, Cheshire (1919&#150;22), and Bridgend in south Wales. Between 1922 and 1926 Freeman attended grammar schools in Nantwich and Bridgend. The variety of south Wales landscapes evoked a lifelong enthusiasm for field research, regional geography, and the history of civilization.<br>
<br>In 1927 Freeman entered the University of Leeds and in 1930 graduated with a first-class honours degree in geography, followed in 1931 by a diploma of education. His undergraduate dissertation was on pre-Norman Glamorgan. During his student years he developed a strong interest in the League of Nations and international peace: &#145;In those days we thought in terms of the world, its major areas and problems, and international affairs were constantly discussed&#146;  (Freeman, &#145;A geographer's way&#146;, 92)&#151;hence the broad-ranging theme of his MA thesis (Leeds, 1932) on modern migrations from Asia. In 1931, at the School of International Studies in Geneva, he witnessed growing &#145;tensions between French and Germans, forebodings of an imminent civil war in Spain, the deep regret of many Americans that they were outside the League of Nations, even the aggression of a picked group of Fascist Italian students&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>&#145;The shadow of the First World War hung over our childhood&#146;, Freeman recalled, &#145;and by the mid-1930s few doubted that another war must follow, sparked off by some real or manufactured crisis&#146;  (Freeman, &#145;A geographer's way&#146;, 93), but he never became cynical; &#145;the earlier teaching in geography combined with the evolutionary approach of geology gave a vision of one human world that could lapse into barbarism or advance towards universal peace&#146;  (ibid.). A devout Christian, he contemplated entering the ministry, but realized by the early 1930s that he could no longer be a Methodist. In July 1932 he was received into the Church of England, a move which caused substantial difficulties in the family, but one which he never regretted. Throughout his life he contributed to local church life.<br>
<br>Freeman's first appointment was to an assistantship in the department of geography at Edinburgh University (1933&#150;6), where he met scholars such as Alan Ogilvie and Arthur Geddes, who became lifelong friends. In 1934 he assumed some editorial responsibilities for the <span class="italic">Scottish Geographical Magazine</span>. In January 1936 he moved to Trinity College, Dublin, where he initiated an honours course in geography and began research on Ireland, particularly on nineteenth-century population patterns. On 9 December 1941 he married Olive Elizabeth Aykroyd (1913&#150;1991), a colleague at Trinity College and the youngest daughter of a well-established Dublin wool merchant and Methodist family. She was a devoted wife, keenly interested in painting and the natural world. She returned to work as a cytologist when their three children, Michael (<i>b</i>. 1943), John (<i>b</i>. 1945), and Mary (<i>b</i>. 1948), had grown up.<br>
<br>Freeman's fourteen years in Ireland were challenging and productive:<blockquote>I walked, cycled, joined any possible student tour, used holidays to acquire some understanding of a country that seemed to me different from Scotland, Wales or England. There was a heavy teaching programme &hellip; but there were some responsive students. And life in Dublin was very entertaining and enjoyable. (Freeman, &#145;Some personal recollections&#146;)</blockquote>&#145;I am sure that I learned more about geography when accompanying him on his excursions&#146;, his pupil Joe Haughton wrote, &#145;than from any textbook&#146;  (Haughton, 117). His research spanned historical and contemporary subjects. He discovered a wealth of archival material on nineteenth-century Ireland and began work on <span class="italic">Pre-Famine Ireland</span>, a work which was completed only in 1957. &#145;Writing <span class="italic">Pre-Famine Ireland</span> was pure joy. I never enjoyed anything more&#146;  (Freeman, &#145;Some personal recollections&#146;). At the same time he initiated a comprehensive land-use survey of the Dublin region. During the war (1941&#150;5) he worked part-time at the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge as assistant to P. M. Roxby, who was preparing Admiralty handbooks on China. Having received the sad news in 1942 that the ship on which his sister Margaret was travelling had been torpedoed off the African coast, he threw himself into writing his famous book <span class="italic">Ireland: a Regional Geography</span> (1950, repr. 1965, 1969, and 1971), which was dedicated to her. He was active in the Geographical Society of Ireland and edited the <span class="italic">Bulletin of the Geographical Society of Ireland</span> (later <span class="italic">Irish Geography</span>). It was to this society, and to the department of geography at Trinity College, that Freeman left the collection of books and papers now known as the Freeman library at Trinity College, Dublin.<br>
<br>In 1950 Freeman became reader in geography at Manchester University, where he remained until his retirement in 1976, and where he wholeheartedly engaged with applied geography or planning. The need for such work had been impressed on him during his student years at Leeds: &#145;I walked for miles through the poorest areas of the town, through quarters inhabited by poor Irish, Jews and others and saw the tentative moves to make a more humane environment through building new estates&#146;  (letter to author, 4 Nov 1980). From this period came three important works, <span class="italic">Geography and Planning</span> (1958), <span class="italic">The Conurbations of Great Britain</span> (1959), and <span class="italic">Geography and Regional Administration</span> (1968), in which he argued that the geographer could &#145;induce people to see the life of people in terms of environment, in terms of home and workplace and the journey between them, in terms of recreation, land conservation, and those amenities providing adequate living conditions for an increasing population&#146;  (Freeman, &#145;A geographer's way&#146;, 97). Later, however, he was critical of planning in Britain. &#145;Can it be that as a reaction to the baleful congestion of people and workplace central city areas are becoming human deserts?&#146; he asked. &#145;Each solution to a problem appears to raise new difficulties unforeseen in the earlier flush of hope&#146;  (ibid.). &#145;Slum clearance has been followed by some disastrous experiments in re-housing; in the 1950s the status symbol of an enterprising municipal authority was the multistorey block of flats, but how many people want them now?&#146;  (ibid., 100).<br>
<br>The Manchester years were not altogether happy. Freeman found there &#145;nine people doing less work than Joe Haughton and I were doing in Dublin&#146;  (letter to author, 9 July 1980). He was promoted to professor only in 1974, but on his retirement in 1976 the senate and council of Manchester University applauded his &#145;sustained literary output&#146; and noted his &#145;strong sense of social responsibility outside the University&#146;  (University of Manchester, 1976).<br>
<br>Soon after his retirement Freeman and his wife moved to Abingdon, near Oxford. Now most of his time and energy was devoted to his long-standing interest in the history of geographical thought. The British Association committee established in 1947 to study the growth of modern British geography had invited him to write <span class="italic">A Hundred Years of Geography</span> (1961). This was followed by <span class="italic">The Geographer's Craft</span> (1968), <span class="italic">The Writing of Geography</span> (1971), and <span class="italic">A History of Modern British Geography</span> (1980). From 1968 to 1988 he was secretary and treasurer of the newly formed Commission on the History of Geographical Thought, and editor of its series <span class="roman">Geographers: Biobibliographical Studies</span>, twelve volumes of which he saw through the press.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Freeman loved to travel, preferably on foot or by bicycle. He recalled vividly his first international geographical congress in Amsterdam in 1938:<blockquote>It was good to realize that there were interested colleagues all over the world, and to get to know some of them as friends. &hellip; One had no illusions about the near future of Europe and it was perhaps the last chance to travel before the lights went out. (Freeman, &#145;A geographer's way&#146;, 94)</blockquote>Conference-going, however, lost its lustre in post-war days: &#145;in the end scholarship depends on isolation, on contemplation, on silence as well as on debate and discussion&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Freeman identified field work as the single most influential factor in his work. He was also impressed by mentors who projected visions of a better world, including Roxby, Arthur Geddes, Halford Mackinder, and Dudley Stamp. His hope was to inspire students to take up research where he had left off or to channel their reforming zeal &#145;into practical activity through some profession helpful to society&#146;  (Freeman, &#145;A geographer's way&#146;, 98).<br>
<br>Freeman died of cancer of the liver on 11 March 1988, and his remains were cremated on 17 March at the Oxford crematorium. He was survived by his wife and their three children. A tireless researcher, a generous correspondent, and an eager traveller, Freeman was the embodiment of the liberal and compassionate scholar. He was outspoken, frank, and at times quite formidably critical. Geography was his vocation, music, religion, and long country walks his inspiration, and writing his favourite activity:<blockquote>Geography &hellip; recognizes the changes made currently as well as in past time on the face of the earth and studies the physical mechanisms as well as the human decisions through which they occur. And if such a study leads at least some geographers to hope that they may in some small way contribute to the making of a better world, at least through giving others a better understanding of it, their work will be more than a dream and a shadow. (Freeman, &#145;A geographer's way&#146;, 101)</blockquote>
