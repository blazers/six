<span class="headword">Lye <span class="st"> [Leigh]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (1621&#150;1684), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister</span>, was born on 25 March 1621, the son of Thomas Leigh of Chard in Somerset. He matriculated from Wadham College, Oxford, on 4 November 1636, was elected scholar on 6 October 1637, and graduated BA on 25 May 1641. He then migrated to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he was elected fellow and proceeded MA in 1646. He was headmaster of Bury St Edmunds School for a short time in 1647, and was incorporated MA of Oxford on 8 May 1649. He appears not to have been chaplain of Wadham College, as Wood claims, but was vicar of Chard when signing the attestation of Somerset ministers in 1648.<br>
<br>In 1651 Lye ran into trouble at the hands of Colonel John Pyne (1600&#150;1678), a powerful man in Somerset. On 4 August the council of state wrote requiring that Lye be required to take the engagement to the Commonwealth or face banishment from the town and its surrounding area and debarment from preaching in Somerset; on 24 August, apparently resigned to his fate, he preached a farewell sermon to his parishioners. But on 18 November the council, &#145;being now satisfied of Mr Lye, takes off their said order, and leaves Lye at liberty to preach at Chard or any other place&#146; ordering that &#145;this be signified to Colonel Pyne&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1651&#150;2</i>, 21). In 1654 Lye's official rehabilitation was complete: he was named as an assistant to the Somerset commission for the ejection of scandalous ministers. In 1658 he was invited by the parishioners to the charge of All Hallows, Lombard Street, London, and was admitted on 27 October. He was named as a commissioner for the approbation of ministers under the act of 14 March 1660. Lye married twice. His first wife, Rebecca, in her will, left property at Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk; the will was proved on 16 February 1658. His second wife, Sarah, was buried at Clapham on 28 September 1678.<br>
<br>In November 1660 Lye and other London ministers wrote thanking the king for his gracious concessions concerning ecclesiastical affairs, but he was ejected from All Hallows in 1662 by the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>. It was reported in 1665 that, though lately in Scotland, he now kept a school at Clapham in Surrey. In 1669 he was said to be preaching at Morgan's Lane, Southwark. Wood recorded that &#145;he usually held forth in conventicles with Dr Henry Wilkinson &hellip; and William Bridge&#146; of Yarmouth  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.134). On 30 April 1672 Lye was licensed as a presbyterian teacher at his house in Clapham, where he continued to teach children for many years. In this role he is said to have been popular and successful, and issued his <span class="italic">Plain and familiar method of instructing the younger sort according to the lesser catechism of the assembly of divines</span> in 1673. Edmund Calamy the younger was taken to Dyers' Hall (aged about four) by his mother to be catechized by &#145;good old Mr. Thomas Lye &hellip; she having been herself catechised by him in her younger years&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Historical Account</span>, 1.73). On 1 January 1678 Ralph Thoresby, then in London, was &#145;At the Fast all day. Mr Lye prayed and preached very well &hellip; showing that examination is everyone's duty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 1.9). On 18 April 1683 Lye was presented at the Guildhall for holding conventicles, and may have been imprisoned. One of his former pupils recalled in a lawsuit, <i>Attorney-General v. Hewer</i> (1700), that Lye often attended service at the parish church before preaching in his own house, that he gave up schoolteaching after being imprisoned in the Marshalsea, and that he used to go to town on Saturday nights in order to preach at a conventicle the following day. This was probably the congregation Lye had gathered which met at Dyers' Hall, Thames Street. He died at Bethnal Green on 7 June 1684, and was buried four days later at Clapham; two unmarried daughters, Sarah and Mary, survived him.<br>
