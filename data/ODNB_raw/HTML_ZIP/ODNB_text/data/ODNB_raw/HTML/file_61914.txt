<span class="headword">Wood,  John</span>  (1788&#150;1860), <span class="occ">naval architect and shipbuilder</span>, was born at Port Glasgow, Renfrewshire, on 10 October 1788, one of at least two sons of John Wood (<i>d</i>. 1811), a Port Glasgow shipbuilder. He followed his father into the business and his training included a spell of two years at the shipyard of John Brockbank (<i>d</i>. 1822) at Lancaster between 1806 and 1808. Lancaster was then in its brief heyday as a shipbuilding centre and Brockbank was an eminent builder from whom Wood doubtless learned much about naval architecture.<br>
<br>Wood returned to Port Glasgow and, on his father's death in 1811, took control of the yard with his brother Charles (1790&#150;1847). Their first contract, accepted before their father died, was for the hull of Henry Bell's pioneering steamship, the <i>Comet</i>. Thereafter they built further steamships of increasing size, including a towing steamboat, the <i>Tug</i> (1817), which gave its name to that class of vessel, and the <i>Talbot</i> (1818), which was the first steamer to ply between Dublin and Holyhead. In 1818 Wood experimented with screw propulsion, albeit hand-powered and without any immediate practical application. In 1822 the Woods built the <i>James Watt</i> (140 ft), which inaugurated a steamer service between Leith and London, a measure of how far steamers had come in the space of ten years.<br>
<br>The brothers diverged in their interests, with Charles travelling to Quebec where he experimented with two raft-ships, the <i>Columbus</i> and the <i>Baron Renfrew</i>. Designed in 1824 to bring timber across the Atlantic, they were both wrecked. He later returned to the Clyde and built at Bowling and at Dumbarton, as well as spending some time in the Netherlands. John Wood worked with both David Napier, who built engines for many of the earlier steamers, and Robert Napier, who was a great friend and admirer. When Samuel Cunard ordered four ships for the north Atlantic service, Robert Napier contracted John Wood to design and build the <i>Acadia</i> (1840), while Charles Wood built the <i>Caledonia</i> to the same design. John Wood also built the <i>Europa</i> for Cunard in 1845, but this was the last of his major contracts. He continued to build small wooden vessels, but more for recreation than business.<br>
<br>Although Wood had no interest in building in iron himself, in 1839 he had become a partner in the shipyard of John Reid &amp; Co. (Reid was married to Wood's niece). It was on Wood's initiative that the yard undertook the building in iron of a floating church, later moored in Loch Sunart, which the Free Church of Scotland needed for congregations denied sites by hostile landowners. Wood also helped the Free Church of Scotland by providing the plans for a schooner, the <i>Breadalbane</i>, which was used to transport ministers to remote locations.<br>
<br>Awarded the silver medal of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts in 1814, Wood was likewise awarded the silver medal of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1844, for the invention of a self-registering tide-gauge. He was also an astronomer and a student of French. He was of a modest, retiring, and kindly disposition, entirely free of professional jealousy and endlessly generous with his time and knowledge to anyone who approached him. While recognizing the science that went into his construction, John Scott Russell considered him &#145;remarkable for the great refinement of his taste. He was a consummate artist in shipbuilding, and every line was as studied and beautiful as fine art could make it. John Wood was, in fact, a pattern shipbuilder&#146;  (Russell, 145). Wood died peacefully at his home in Port Glasgow on 22 December 1860.<br>
