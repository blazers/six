<span class="headword">Shirreff,  John</span>  (1759&#150;1818), <span class="occ">agricultural writer</span>, was born at Captainhead, Haddington, the son of Matthew Shiraff (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1785), a Haddingtonshire tenant farmer, and Jean Maitland, probably his wife. Very little is known about his early life, wife, or children, though he was said to have received a liberal education. As a young man he was for a number of years a merchant in the West Indies with his brother-in-law, Mr Burton. Following the death of his father he returned home to take on the tenancy of the family farm and to develop a number of agricultural innovations. In 1793, in conjunction with Robert Brown and George Rennie, he was appointed by the board of agriculture to undertake the survey of the West Riding of Yorkshire. Their impressive report, of which Brown was the main author, was widely praised by William Marshall, who had been critical of the accounts of other counties. On his return from Yorkshire, Shirreff attempted to popularize a number of agricultural innovations including a wind driven threshing machine and to encourage the use of bonemeal as an agricultural fertilizer. His success in persuading other farmers to adopt these methods was very limited.<br>
<br>In 1801 Shirreff obtained an award from the board of agriculture for an essay on the most appropriate ways of cropping and reseeding pasture fields. He also compiled an account for the London Society of Arts on the osier plantations on his farm. The death of his eldest two sons in their early twenties devastated him. He sublet the farm, moved initially to Craigside, Abbeyhill, and later to other residences in the Edinburgh region. He made a precarious living from writing articles and reports (on various scientific subjects and the rural economy) which were published primarily in the <span class="italic">Farmers' Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">Scots Monthly Magazine</span>. These included &#145;Discussions on turnips, potatoes and apple trees&#146;, &#145;Curled disease in potatoes&#146;, &#145;Introduction of exotic heaths&#146;, and &#145;Method of stacking turnips to preserve them through the winter&#146;. His main achievement was to undertake, for the board of agriculture, separate surveys of the Orkney and Shetland islands, which included detailed suggestions for improving their subsistence farming methods.<br>
<br>Shirreff was a recognized authority on agriculture and botany, and was widely consulted by agriculturists. His knowledge of Poa, Festuca, and Tritica and the smaller grasses was described in his obituary in the <span class="italic">Farmers' Magazine</span> as perhaps superior to that of any other man in existence. His countenance and figure were denoted as being exceedingly manly and graceful, with highly prepossessing manners and address. According to his obituary he was rather outspoken, which meant that in spite of all his advantage &#145;he was ill-calculated to secure the patronage of the great&#146;  (<span class="italic">Farmers' Magazine</span>, 207&#150;9). During the last years of his life he lived in the countryside, taking responsibility for the management of several estates. Following a prolonged illness, during which he was looked after by his wife, his children, and his brother, Alexander Shirreff, he died on 2 November 1818 and was interred at the burial-ground of his ancestors at Prestonkirk, Haddingtonshire.<br>
