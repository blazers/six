</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Orchardson, Sir  William Quiller</span>  (1832&#150;1910), <span class="occ">artist</span>, born in Edinburgh on 27 March 1832, was the only surviving son of Abram Orchardson, a tailor, and his wife, Elizabeth Quiller, whose family was of Austrian origin. His father was descended from a branch of a highland clan or sept named Urquartson, from the Loch Ness region in Inverness-shire.<br>
<br>Orchardson entered the Trustees' Academy, Edinburgh, on 1 October 1845, aged thirteen. The master of the academy, Alexander Christie ARSA, taught ornament and design, and John Ballantyne RSA, who was a competent teacher, took the antique and life classes. Although the academy's reputation had declined, it produced a number of notable artists around this time, including, among those slightly older than Orchardson, James Archer, Thomas Faed, and Erskine Nicol&#151;all of whom, like Orchardson and his friends, were to contribute significantly to the genre tradition already established by their great countryman Sir David Wilkie.<br>
<br>From the start, Orchardson himself showed a remarkable degree of facility. His friends recorded that &#145;he mastered &hellip; in weeks&#146;  (Armstrong, <span class="italic">W. Q. Orchardson</span>, 13) feats possible to them only after months of labour, and he carried off first prizes for all three academic sessions between 1849 and 1852. He was also noted for his independence. Orchardson claimed that on his first day at the academy he refused to draw from the antique, politely insisting that he preferred to work from nature, and the quality of his work was such that he was allowed to have his way.<br>
<br>In February 1852 the mediocre Christie was replaced by Robert Scott Lauder, a change which persuaded Orchardson, who had completed the course, to return to the academy and remain as a mature student until 1855. Orchardson recalled with approval the system of &#145;wise neglect&#146;  (Gray, 25) which Lauder adopted, allowing students to develop their individual talents unconstrained. Lauder was an inspirational teacher with &#145;a contagious enthusiasm for all that was beautiful&#146;  (Caw, 230), and under his tutelage the school regained its former prestige. Despite the stylistic affinities which would always identify his students, Lauder did not teach a particular method, but in the life classes he communicated his enthusiasm for the great Venetian painters whom he had studied first-hand for many years. His painterly approach, and his emphasis on tonal values and on the unification of the subject through a subtle play of light and atmosphere, provided a welcome alternative to the conventions of traditional academic training. Other younger pupils much influenced by Lauder were William McTaggart, Peter Graham, and two who were to remain Orchardson's lifelong friends, Thomas Alexander Graham and John Pettie.<br>
<br>In 1848, at the age of sixteen, Orchardson began to exhibit at the Royal Scottish Academy. Of his more ambitious subjects, <span class="italic">George Wishart's Last Exultation</span> (1852, exh. 1853; University of St Andrews), a multi-figure scene from the last days in the life of the Scottish martyr, is a most impressive achievement for so young an artist. Painted in only three days, it owes much to Wilkie's <span class="italic">John Knox</span>, which Orchardson had seen, unfinished, at the Royal Scottish Academy exhibition of 1842. In 1854 the first of a long line of Orchardson's portraits appeared at the academy, and, in the years following, subjects from Dickens, Shakespeare, and Walter Scott&#151;<span class="italic">Little Nell</span> (1855), <span class="italic">Claudio and Isabel</span> (1856), <span class="italic">Jennie Deans and the Laird o' Dumbiedykes</span> (1860; priv. coll.)&#151;signified the beginnings of a lifelong interest in literary subjects.<br>
<br>In 1862 Orchardson, Pettie, and Tom Graham moved to London, initially staying at various addresses in Pimlico before sharing a home together at 37 Fitzroy Square in 1863&#150;5. From 1863 Orchardson exhibited annually at the Royal Academy; in the first five years these were mainly literary subjects, including <span class="italic">An Old English Song</span> (1863), <span class="italic">The Flowers o' the Forest</span> (1864; Southampton Art Gallery) and two Shakespearian subjects, <span class="italic">Hamlet and Ophelia</span> (1865) and <span class="italic">Talbot and the Countess of Auvergne</span> (1867). A historical genre scene, <span class="italic">The Challenge</span> (1865), showing a confrontation between a cavalier and a puritan, won a prize from the dealer Henry Wallis, and was exhibited in his French Gallery in Pall Mall. It also earned considerable acclaim when it appeared at the Paris Universal Exhibition two years later. By this date Orchardson's reputation was well established, and in 1867 he was elected an associate of the Royal Academy.<br>
<br>The next decade was to mark a considerable advance in Orchardson's career. In 1870 he made the one extended continental visit of his life, to Venice, and in the years following he exhibited several Venetian figurative subjects and townscapes. It was, however, a literary subject that marked his full maturity as an artist. <span class="italic">The Queen of the Swords</span> (exh. RA, 1877; Forbes Magazine collection), was inspired by a description of a Shetland sword dance in Walter Scott's novel <span class="italic">The Pirate</span> (1821); but Orchardson's subtle elaboration of the scene, his evident delight in exploiting its formal elements, and his restrained but convincing characterization showed a significant advance in his work and ensured his election as Royal Academician that year. Significantly, this was the last of his Scottish subjects and the last subject from Scott. Orchardson now began to concentrate on the ballroom and drawing-room subjects for which he is best known, and which were suited to the tastes of a great &#145;metropolitan centre of wealth and fashion&#146; such as London  (Errington, 41).<br>
<br>Like Pettie, Orchardson was especially attracted to the elegant d&eacute;cor and fashions of the later eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. He was an enthusiastic collector of the decorative arts of this period, so that his scenes of high society are authentic as well as glamorous; but what most distinguishes them is their psychological realism. His major exhibit of the following year, <span class="italic">A Social Eddy; Left by the Tide</span> (1878; Aberdeen Art Gallery), exemplifies the original touch which he brought to this genre, sympathetically suggesting the anxieties and embarrassments attendant on grand social events. On a similar theme, <span class="italic">Her First Dance</span> (1884; Tate collection) convincingly portrays the shyness and timidity of a young girl in contrast to the egotistical self-confidence of her partner; while in <span class="italic">The Rivals</span> (1895; NG Scot.), a bored young woman is obliged to suffer the presence of three persistent suitors, each silently angling for her attention.<br>
<br>Orchardson scored his first real sensation with his portrayal of a historical event based on an eyewitness account: <span class="italic">Napoleon on Board the &#145;Bellerophon&#146;</span> (1880; Tate collection)&#151;the ship which transported the emperor to his final exile on the island of St Helena. A lone figure, the deposed Napoleon stands brooding on deck, oblivious to the group of officers (all individual portraits) closely observing him as the shores of France recede in the distance. <span class="italic">The Times</span> described it as &#145;by common consent, the cynosure of the exhibition&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 May 1880, 9), and Walter Armstrong defined it as the occasion when the artist &#145;first blazed out into popularity&#146;  (Armstrong, <span class="italic">W. Q. Orchardson</span>, 45). Its importance was widely recognized, not least by the trustees of the Chantrey Bequest, who purchased it for &pound;2000. Other French subjects from this later period, both real and imaginary, include <span class="italic">Voltaire</span> (1883; Kunsthalle, Hamburg; version NG Scot.); <span class="italic">The Salon of Mme Recamier</span> (1885), and <span class="italic">The Young Duke</span> (1889; Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight), which was rapturously received on its exhibition at the Royal Academy. Orchardson returned to his hero in <span class="italic">St Helena, 1816; Napoleon Dictating the Account of his Campaigns</span> (1892; Lady Lever Art Gallery).<br>
<br>Orchardson's gifts for restrained composition, economical story telling, and subtle characterization found a new outlet in a series of edgy domestic dramas which focused on the emotional tensions between sophisticated married couples. Although few in number, their modern context gives them added significance, and it is these which have secured his reputation as an innovator. <span class="italic">Mariage de convenance; Before</span> (1884; Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum) and <span class="italic">After!</span> (1886; Aberdeen Art Gallery), portray the predictable consequences of an alliance between a rich, elderly husband and a pretty young wife. In the first, the husband anxiously observes her as she sits, bored and resentful, at the opposite end of a long table. In the second, he sits alone at the fireside, the table set only for one. <span class="italic">The First Cloud</span> (1887; replica, Tate collection) depicts signs of growing conflict between another affluent couple; while in <span class="italic">Trouble</span> (exh. RA, 1898) some unspecified revelation has evidently initiated a serious rift between husband and wife.<br>
<br>Orchardson maintained a judicious balance between the demands of narrative on the one hand and aesthetics on the other. He insisted that a worthy subject, and in particular &#145;the dramatic moment&#146;  (Gray, 273) were essential to him; indeed, his generous disposition of elegant figures in space and his exploitation of artificial light invite comparison with the stage, but his scenes are never theatrical in the pejorative sense of the word. The restraint and economy of his work and, in particular, his recognition of the value of empty space and its pictorial function&#151;the sense of isolation and alienation which it achieves&#151;won universal favour. Orchardson's respect for the formal elements of painting was such that contemporary critics discussed his work in largely technical terms. Of his &#145;society&#146; pictures, Gleeson White concluded that it is &#145;not so much their subject as their &#147;painting&#148; which entitles [them] &hellip; to rank with the most important of our time&#146;  (White, 3.20); and James Little perceived Orchardson's compositions as primarily &#145;decorations &hellip; alluring patterns&#146;  (Little, 9). It is understandable that Degas, Walter Sickert, and J. A. M. Whistler were among the artists who admired his technique.<br>
<br>Orchardson married, on 6 April 1873, at St Mary Abbots, Kensington, Ellen, the daughter of the London publisher Charles Moxon, with whom he had four sons and two daughters. His own favourite among his paintings was a double portrait of his wife and his son Gordon, <span class="italic">Master Baby</span> (1886; NG Scot.), and this was Sickert's choice also. Orchardson had received portrait commissions from his first years in Edinburgh. In later life the demand was such that, from 1894, portraiture made up the bulk of his work. In 1902 <span class="italic">The Bystander</span> singled out Orchardson's <span class="italic">Mrs Mosscockle</span> as &#145;the finest portrait in the Academy&#146; and talked of the artist as a &#145;subtle psychologist. No shade of character&#146;, the critic wrote, &#145;is too fine for his acute analysis&#146;  (Gray, 295). Orchardson's sitters included Queen Victoria, Albert Edward, prince of Wales (later Edward VII), and the latter's second son, later George V. He was appointed master of the Society of Portrait Painters in 1897.<br>
<br>Orchardson's kindness, affability, and sociable disposition won him universal popularity. From his youth he was a keen sportsman; although he gave up hunting on his marriage, he remained a keen angler and tennis player, and he was also adept at billiards. At his house in Westgate-on-Sea, Kent, he had his own tennis court constructed, and in his later years he took up golf. Orchardson's urbanity and success led T. H. Escott to name him&#151;with Marcus Stone and G. D. Leslie&#151;as one of the artists who typified this affluent period: &#145;finished and prosperous men of the world in social request everywhere&#146;  (Gillett, 34)&#151;men who had contributed materially to raising both the status and fortunes of their profession.<br>
<br>Orchardson was made an honorary member of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1871; a DCL of Oxford in 1890; a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1895; and an honorary member of the Royal Society of Miniature Painters in 1900; he was knighted in 1907. He died at his home, 13 Portland Place, St Marylebone, London, of heart disease on 13 April 1910, only a fortnight after completing, with some difficulty, the portrait of Lord Blyth which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in the same year. A modern ballroom subject, <span class="italic">The Last Dance</span>, remained unfinished. A retrospective exhibition of sixty-eight of Orchardson's works was held at the Royal Academy in the winter of 1911. His widow was granted a civil-list pension of &pound;80 in 1912.<br>
