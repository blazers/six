<span class="headword">Barnett,  Lionel David</span>  (1871&#150;1960), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, was born in Liverpool on 21 October 1871, the eldest son of Baron Barnett, banker, and his wife, Adelaide Cowan. He was educated at the high school, institute, and University College, Liverpool. He went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1892 and was elected a scholar in 1893. He was Sir William Browne's medallist (Greek ode, 1893, 1894, 1896; Greek epigram, 1893); gained a first class (division 1) in part one of the classical tripos in 1894 and was elected Craven scholar the same year. In 1896 he was awarded a first class, with special distinction in language, in part two of the classical tripos, together with the chancellor's medal. He was appointed Craven student in 1897 and in 1900 the University of Manchester conferred on him the degree of LittD. He studied Sanskrit at Cambridge and Halle. In 1901 he married Blanche Esther (<i>d</i>. 1955), daughter of the Revd B. Berliner, minister of the St John's Wood synagogue. They had a daughter and a son.<br>
<br>In 1899 Barnett joined the staff of the British Museum as assistant keeper in the department of oriental printed books and manuscripts, and after only nine years was promoted keeper of the department in succession to Sir Robert Douglas. To the duties of this post, its functions officially defined as &#145;to conserve, augment and catalogue the collections&#146;, he brought a remarkable threefold equipment of fine scholarship, administrative ability, and business acumen which resulted in the museum's store of oriental manuscripts and books being enormously enriched during his twenty-eight years of office. The vast range of his erudition in the cultures of both East and West was probably unique in the museum's history. He compiled a monumental series of no fewer than ten descriptive catalogues of oriental printed books in the Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages, covering Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrit, Kannada, Badaga, Kurg, Tamil, Telugu, Burmese, Hindi, Bihari, Pahari, Panjabi, Saurashtra, and other languages, large quarto volumes containing in all some 8000 columns of text.<br>
<br>Library administration and bibliography on this massive scale were only a part of Barnett's many-sided activity. From 1906 to 1917 he held the professorship of Sanskrit at University College, London. When the university's School of Oriental Studies was founded he was included on its staff from 1917 as lecturer in Sanskrit; he was also lecturer in ancient Indian history and epigraphy (1922&#150;48) and librarian (1940&#150;47). When he retired from the school in 1948 a special volume of its <span class="italic">Bulletin</span> was published in his honour. He was elected FBA in 1936 and appointed CB in 1937. A prominent figure in the Royal Asiatic Society, he was at various times a member of council and vice-president, its honorary librarian from 1939 onwards, and was awarded its gold medal in 1950.<br>
<br>The Greek and Latin classics were Barnett's first love and throughout life his prodigious memory was stored with them. For the benefit of the young student and the cultured lay public he published between 1900 and 1904 a succession of useful volumes, some translated from the German, on classical history and literature. Thereafter the works he produced, as separate books or as monographs in learned periodicals, dealt almost entirely with Indological subjects. In addition to his translations, editions, and secondary studies of classical Indian texts in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and other languages, he also published a number of accessible and successful works aimed at informing a wider readership in Indian history, religion, and culture; these included several volumes in the series called <span class="roman">The Wisdom of the East</span>, some of which can still be profitably read by students. His numerous articles and book reviews in learned journals embraced Indian history, epigraphy, folklore, drama, philology, and Tibetan as well as Indian texts. He published translations of Spanish documents relating to the history of the Jewish community of which he was a faithful and active member, holding several of its honorary offices.<br>
<br>Barnett's encyclopaedic learning was carried with effortless ease and with never a trace of ostentation. His natural humility and his countless unobtrusive kindnesses, especially towards younger scholars, drew to him the affection of a host of friends. Although little given to outdoor recreation he enjoyed constant good health, until suddenly in 1932 his eyesight gave way under the intense strain of years, one eye becoming permanently useless and the sight of the other impaired. This grievous blow did not deter him, after a brief convalescence, from pressing on with fruitful academic work both in the study and in the lecture room. In 1948 when he retired from his university duties he might reasonably have sought an easier life after half a century of ceaseless industry, but hearing that his old department at the British Museum from which he had retired in 1936 was in sore straits for staff, he offered his services as an assistant keeper and for the last twelve years of his life the museum once more profited from his vast knowledge and experience. A fortnight before his death in London on 28 January 1960, the Asiatic Society of Bengal awarded him the Sir William Jones gold medal. His son, Richard David Barnett (1909&#150;1986), was keeper of the department of western Asiatic antiquities in the British Museum from 1955 to 1974.<br>
