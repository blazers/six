<span class="headword">Oakley,  John</span>  (1834&#150;1890), <span class="occ">dean of Manchester</span>, son of John Oakley, estate and land agent, of Blackheath, Kent, was born at Frindsbury, near Rochester, Kent, on 28 October 1834. He was educated at Rochester Cathedral school, and afterwards at Hereford grammar school. He entered Brasenose College, Oxford, as an exhibitioner in 1852 and graduated BA in 1857 (MA, 1859). He was an ebullient president of the Oxford Union for the Michaelmas term of 1856, during which he was sent down for non-attendance at college chapel. His father intended him for the profession of civil engineer, and for a short time he worked in an engineer's office at Chatham, but his own leanings were towards the church.<br>
<br>In 1858 he was ordained deacon, and had his first curacy at St Luke's, Berwick Street, Soho, London. After ordination to the priesthood in 1859 he served as curate at St James's, Piccadilly, while acting as secretary to the London diocesan board of education and as a promoter of the London Lay Helpers' Association. On 21 January 1861 he married Clara, daughter of Joseph Phelps of Madeira; they had a large family.<br>
<br>In 1867 Oakley was appointed vicar of the slum parish of St Saviour, Hoxton, London, where he remained until 1881 and proved a zealous and popular pastor. He was a committed high-churchman, but his ritualism aroused no opposition. A follower of Frederick Denison Maurice, his views on political and social questions were essentially liberal and he had genuine sympathy with working people and with the cause of the trade unions. He served as chairman of several conferences of trade union members and other parties. His popular touch earned him the compliment of a costermonger who dubbed him &#145;the poor bloke's parson&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1881 Oakley accepted the offer of the deanery of Carlisle from W. E. Gladstone, one of whose sons was curate at Hoxton. Before leaving London, Oakley received an address and testimonial from a large number of clergy and laity. He remained at Carlisle for only two years, but this was long enough to make his mark as an innovator who sat light to the dignity of his office and eschewed gaiters. In November 1883 he was appointed dean of Manchester at a time of considerable difficulty, on account of legal disputes between the cathedral chapter and the Manchester rectors, and the prosecution and imprisonment of the ritualist S. F. Green, whose cause Oakley defended in opposition to Bishop James Fraser. In Manchester, as in London and Carlisle, movements that aimed to improve the condition of the working classes won his wholehearted support, even if this meant conflict with the more conservative members of his flock. Oakley cultivated ecumenical relations with the free churches and with Roman Catholics, took a keen interest in local education, and was a frequent contributor on church matters to the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. His articles for that newspaper, signed Vicesimus, include a memoir (14 November 1883) of his friend H. N. Oxenham (1829&#150;1888). Besides many separate sermons and papers, he published <span class="italic">The Christian Aspect and Application of the Decalogue</span> (1865) and <span class="italic">&#145;The Conscience Clause&#146;: its History, Terms, Effect and Principle</span> (1866).<br>
<br>Oakley's commanding figure, approachable manner, and fine countenance impressed all who met him. His health, however, was undermined by the strain of incessant activity, and he died, aged only fifty-five, at Deganwy, near Llandudno, on 10 June 1890. He was buried at Chislehurst, Kent, and a stained glass window was erected by public subscription to his memory in the south aisle of Manchester Cathedral.<br>
