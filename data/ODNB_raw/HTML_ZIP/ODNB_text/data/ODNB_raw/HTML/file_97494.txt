<span class="headword">McManners,  John <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>  (1916&#150;2006), <span class="occ">historian and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 25 December 1916 at 14 Lanark Terrace, Ferryhill, co. Durham, the eldest of three sons of Joseph (Joe) McManners, a miner, and his wife, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marshall, a schoolteacher. He grew up in an Anglican vicarage after his father was ordained, and was educated at the Alderman Wraith Grammar School, Spennymoor. In 1936 he won an exhibition to St Edmund Hall, Oxford, and graduated with first-class honours in modern history in 1939.<br>
<br>Abandoning plans for a research degree on the outbreak of the Second World War, McManners at once volunteered for officer training in what he saw as a just and necessary conflict. Joining the Northumberland Fusiliers, a machine-gun regiment, in 1940, he was posted to Egypt and almost immediately found himself in the besieged garrison of Tobruk. The first sight of dead Germans strengthened a hitherto weak vocation to be ordained after the war ended. Subsequently he was wounded, but served throughout the north African campaign, rising to the rank of major and adjutant of his battalion. He ended the war, vividly chronicled in his memoir <span class="italic">Fusilier</span> (2002), as a liaison officer with the Greek army in exile, and was made an officer of the order of King George of the Hellenes.<br>
<br>Once more unsure of his vocation, McManners was nevertheless persuaded on demobilization to take a theology course at St Chad's College, Durham. In 1948 he was finally ordained. At Durham he also met his wife, Sarah Carruthers, a 31-year-old geographer, and daughter of William Isaac Errington, farmer. They were married by McManners's father at St Oswald's Church, Durham, on 27 December 1951, and had two sons and two daughters. By the time of his marriage McManners had returned to his old Oxford college as chaplain and tutor in modern history, remaining until 1956. In that year, perhaps inspired by wartime memories of Australian comradeship, he took a chair in history at the University of Tasmania. His years in Hobart were scarred by disputes not of his making, but they brought the completion of <span class="italic">French Ecclesiastical Society under the Ancien R&eacute;gime: a Study of Angers in the Eighteenth Century</span> (1960), which instantly established his reputation. The result of summer vacations in the early 1950s spent in French archives, it painted a lively picture of a provincial church on the eve of violent disruption by the revolution. It was unpartisan, but showed an empathetic understanding of pre-revolutionary ways seldom found in French historiography. All its author's subsequent work was imbued with the same spirit.<br>
<br>From 1959 McManners spent happier years at the University of Sydney, but a sabbatical leave in 1965&#150;6 as visiting fellow at All Souls College, Oxford, reminded him of how distant Australia was from the best scholarly resources, not to mention his ageing parents. He returned to England in 1967 to become professor of history at the University of Leicester. From there he published the &#145;harvest of that delightful year&#146; back in Oxford, a brilliant short distillation of current knowledge, <span class="italic">The French Revolution and the Church</span> (1967), and a fuller discussion of later relations between Catholicism and the Third Republic, <span class="italic">Church and State in France, 1870&#150;1914</span> (1972). When in the latter year the regius chair of ecclesiastical history at Oxford fell vacant, requiring as it did a holder in orders, he was an obvious candidate. He hesitated before accepting an offer that took him by surprise, but his appointment was widely welcomed in the university. It entailed a canonry at Christ Church, and membership of two faculty boards. He served as a very popular and successful chairman of that of modern history from 1978 to 1981. It seemed the peak of his career, with election as a fellow of the British Academy in 1978, and the publication in 1981 of <span class="italic">Death and the Enlightenment</span>, which won the Wolfson prize for history. But when he reached the customary retirement age in 1984 he was invited to return to All Souls as chaplain. He remained there for seventeen years, which he described as the happiest of his life. They saw the publication of the best-selling <span class="italic">Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity</span> (1990), which he had edited, and culminated in his eighty-second year in the magnificent, two-volume <span class="italic">Church and Society in Eighteenth Century France</span> (1998). Condensing a lifetime's learning, it avoided what its author called &#145;morbid analysis&#146;  (<span class="italic">Church and Society</span>, 1.1), making points with teeming examples and anecdotes, &#145;no good story&#146; as he put it, &#145;knowingly left out&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 16 Nov 2006). It offered a vast panorama of the church first encountered in microcosm in Angers, with all its idiosyncrasies, inconsistencies, and vices, but also many humble virtues, comforts, and decencies, all doomed to perish tragically in a largely unexpected revolution. No Englishman had ever written better, or with more insight, about the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i>.<br>
<br>Invested as a commander of the Ordre des Palmes Acad&eacute;miques in 1991 and the Ordre National du M&eacute;rite in 2001, and appointed CBE in 2000, McManners was an accomplished lecturer and preacher, invited to give many endowed lectures outside his own institutions. Widely respected for his integrity, common sense, and quiet generosity of spirit, he was unfailingly good-humoured, a lover of puns, and an assiduous reader of the popular press for its human interest stories. Wiry in build, he was also a lifelong sportsman, playing football when younger, and tennis almost daily well into his eighties. He died of chronic obstructive airways disease at his home, 71 Cunliffe Close, Oxford, on 4 November 2006, and was survived by his wife, Sarah, and their four children.<br>
