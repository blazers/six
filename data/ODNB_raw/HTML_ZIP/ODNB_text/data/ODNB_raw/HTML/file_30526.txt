<span class="headword">Bailey,  John Cann</span>  (1864&#150;1931), <span class="occ">writer on literature</span>, the third son of Elijah Crosier Bailey, solicitor and clerk of the peace for Norwich, and his wife, Jane Sarah, daughter of William Robert Cann, of Cavick House, Wymondham, Norfolk, was born at Cavick House on 10 January 1864. He was educated at Haileybury College and at New College, Oxford, where he obtained second classes in classical moderations (1884) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1886); he was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1892. He moved to London with sufficient private means to enable him to stand for parliament (he unsuccessfully contested the Sowerby division of Yorkshire in the Conservative interest in 1895 and 1900), but with few social contacts other than those which he had formed at university. Bailey's easy, agreeable, and intelligent conversation gave him, however, a ready entrance into the metropolitan society of the 1890s. On 26 April 1900 he married Sarah Kathleen (<i>d</i>. 1941), the eldest daughter from his second marriage of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17307/', "G. W. Lyttelton, fourth Baron Lyttelton")</script>. They had three daughters, the youngest of whom predeceased Bailey. Herself a spirited conversationalist, his wife gave him not only a very happy home life but the association of several important brothers-in-law, including Neville Gerald Lyttelton, army officer, Arthur Temple Lyttelton, suffragan bishop of Southampton, and Alfred Lyttelton, lawyer and statesman. He was a constant and valued member of the Literary (dining) Society, of which he eventually became president, and, as might be expected of so ardent a Johnsonian, was immensely gratified by his election to &#145;the Club&#146;.<br>
<br>Bailey's intense pleasure in good talk may possibly have restricted his literary output, but his literary ambition was always circumscribed. He related that when people asked him to write a <i>magnum opus</i> he used to counter by enquiring: &#145;If I write it, will you buy it and will you read it?&#146; It is arguable that his best work was, in fact, slight in compass. He himself may have rated highest his <span class="italic">Milton</span> (1915), a little book, but many of his contemporaries felt that <span class="italic">Dr Johnson and his Circle</span> (1913) gave his particular powers their fullest scope. Bailey's other publications include <span class="italic">Studies in some Famous Letters</span> (1899); an edition of the <span class="italic">Poems of William Cowper</span> (1905); <span class="italic">The Claims of French Poetry</span> (1907); <span class="italic">Some Political Ideas and Persons</span> (1921); <span class="italic">The Continuity of Letters</span> (1923); an edition of the <span class="italic">Diary of Lady Frederick Cavendish</span> (2 vols., 1927), the author being his sister-in-law; and <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span> (<span class="roman">English Heritage</span> series, 1929). Bailey was a constant contributor to the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>, for which he did much important, though anonymous work; to the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, of which he was deputy editor in 1907&#150;8 and again in 1909&#150;10; to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>; and to the <span class="italic">London Mercury</span>.<br>
<br>As chairman (1912&#150;15) and president (1925&#150;6) of the English Association, Bailey made a further contribution to the study of English letters; and as chairman (1923&#150;31) of the executive committee of the National Trust, and also of the Fulham branch of the Charity Organization Society, he disclosed a practical interest in things of beauty and in matters of social welfare. During the First World War he worked in the intelligence bureau of the Department of Information, and was responsible for propaganda in France, Spain, and Italy. In 1918 he moved to the Foreign Office's political intelligence department, where he was involved in the planning for the Paris peace conference.<br>
<br>Never a strong man physically, Bailey was still actively involved in the literary world when he died, at his home, 4 Onslow Gardens, Kensington, London, on 29 June 1931. He was buried on 2 July in the churchyard of Wramplingham near Wymondham, as befitted one who valued both his connection with the county of Norfolk and his membership of the Church of England. His outlook had been that of a broad-churchman.<br>
