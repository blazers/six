<span class="headword">Mearne,  Samuel</span>  (1624&#150;1683), <span class="occ">publisher and bookbinder</span>, was born at Reading at 11 a.m. on 20 April 1624, the son of Henry Mearne, yeoman. In 1637 he was apprenticed to Robert Bates, a member of the Stationers' Company, subsequently turned over to John Arnold, bookseller, and in July 1646 freed by both Arnold and Bates. In 1653 Mearne took the first of his twelve apprentices. Two years later, when he bound a book for one Cor: Pigeon, his address is given as &#145;Pellecan Courte, in Littill Brettin&#146;. He lived in Little Britain, in the parish of St Botolph, Aldersgate, all his working life.<br>
<br>In 1655 a pass was granted for Cornelius Bee, Samuel Mearne, and William Minshaw to go to the Netherlands. He may there have been of service to Charles II, who was at Middelburg. In any event, he was speedily rewarded at the Restoration by being granted, by letters patent of 20 June 1660, the office of bookbinder to the king at a fee&#151;which he seldom received&#151;of &pound;6 per annum. Mearne was already referred to as a bookseller in 1655 and his first publication also dates from that year. Only two other books survive which he issued before 1670, but from then onwards until his death in 1683 he published regularly. He was not himself a printer, but he had a share in the king's printing house, as one of the assigns of John Bill and Christopher Barker. His success as a businessman was partly due to keeping on good terms with the establishment as a zealous seeker-out of illegal presses, an activity which helped the government to suppress seditious pamphlets and helped the leading members of the book trade, such as Mearne himself, to suppress possible competitors. In 1668 the king requested the Stationers' Company to admit, as member of the court, among a number of other royal servants, &#145;Samuel Mearne, our bookbinder&#146;. Mearne subsequently served as warden and master of the company and continued to be concerned about illegal printing for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Mearne is, however, best known as a bookbinder. His first surviving binding in blind-tooled brown calf was that made for Cor: Pigeon in 1655. At this time he married; his eldest child, Anne, named after her mother, was born on 3 January 1656, but she did not live long and her burial is recorded on 3 March of the same year. On 2 January 1657 his eldest son, Samuel, was born, followed by Charles (<i>b</i>. February 1658) and Anne (<i>b</i>. 26 May 1665). Another son, James, was buried on 29 May 1664.<br>
<br>From 1660 onwards, Samuel Mearne the elder was much too important a figure in the book trade to have worked at the bench himself, but he did have a bookbinding shop on the premises of his bookselling business and the Mearne bindery was responsible for the most splendid gold-tooled and onlaid bindings produced during the reign of Charles II. Mearne also carried out all the standard binding for the royal library, mainly in red turkey leather, decorated with gold fillets, the royal arms block, a conventional flower, or, later and most frequently, with Charles II's cipher. More elaborate bindings were supplied for use in the various royal chapels, for members of the royal household, for presentation to ambassadors and plenipotentiaries, and for the ceremonies of the Order of the Garter. Several sets of <span class="roman">Bibles</span> and prayer books survive, bound for the chapel and the closet at Whitehall, the set for the king's own use the most elaborate and costliest of all in red turkey leather, decorated with black paint, and lavishly tooled in gold to a cottage roof design with small massed floral and curling tools and the king's cipher, their foredges painted beneath the gold with the royal arms or ciphers. The Mearne bindery also supplied a considerable number of other <span class="roman">Bibles</span> and prayer books for use in the royal chapels, the most elaborate of which, in gold-tooled and onlaid black, olive, or red turkey with painted foredges, may have been for the altar. Although Mearne's favourite style was the &#145;cottage roof&#146;, he occasionally produced a design based on the French &#145;fanfare&#146; style, as well as simpler panel designs. He also supplied books to the dean of Windsor as register of the Order of the Garter, the registers bound in velvet, and the manuscript copies of the statutes for the newly installed knights in very dark blue turkey leather.<br>
<br>In 1674, on the death of Francis Bowman, Mearne had become stationer in ordinary to the king and in May 1675 a new grant of the offices of bookbinder, bookseller, and stationer to the king was made to Samuel Mearne and his son Charles for their lives and the life of the survivor. Mearne died at Little Britain in May 1683 and was buried at St Botolph, Aldersgate, on 16 May of that year. On 9 July, Mr Secretary Jenkins wrote to the lord mayor: &#145;The late Mr Mearne was so zealous in the King's service that I think myself obliged to remember it on every opportunity of doing a good office to his son.&#146; Charles Mearne, who was apprenticed to his father and freed by patrimony on 24 June 1682, but who had been working in partnership with his father since 1678, continued as royal bookbinder, bookseller, and stationer to supply the <span class="roman">Bibles</span> and prayer books to the closet. He survived his father by only three years, when his elder brother, Samuel junior, was appointed royal bookbinder, an office he held until the revolution in 1688.<br>
