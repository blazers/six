<span class="headword">Plumptre,  Edward Hayes</span>  (1821&#150;1891), <span class="occ">dean of Wells</span>, came from a family originally of Nottingham [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22403/', "Plumptre, Henry")</script>]; the branch to which Edward belonged subsequently moved to Fredville in Kent. He was born on 6 August 1821, the son of Edward Hallows Plumptre (1785&#150;1851), a London solicitor. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22401/', "Charles John Plumptre")</script> was his brother. He was educated at home, and (after a brief stay at King's College, London) entered Oxford as a scholar of University College, of which his uncle Frederick Charles Plumptre (1796&#150;1870) was master from 1836 until his death. In 1844 he took a double first class in classics and mathematics (the only one of his year); he was elected to a fellowship at Brasenose, which he resigned three years afterwards, on his marriage with Harriet Theodosia, daughter of Michael Maurice and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18384/', "Frederick Denison Maurice")</script>. For some years the influence of his brother-in-law was apparent in his religious views. Ordained in 1846 by Bishop Wilberforce, he proceeded MA in 1847, and joined the staff of King's College, London. There his work mainly lay for twenty-one years, and he enlarged the scope of the institution by introducing evening classes. From 1847 to 1868 he was chaplain there, from 1853 to 1863 professor of pastoral theology, and from 1864 to 1881 professor of exegesis. He proved a most sympathetic teacher, and took a genuine interest in the future welfare of his pupils. He also took a leading part in promoting the higher education of women as a professor of Queen's College, Harley Street, where he was principal during the last two years of his work there (1875&#150;7).<br>
<br>Throughout this period Plumptre was also occupied in clerical work. From 1851 to 1858 he was assistant preacher at Lincoln's Inn, and in 1863 prebendary of St Paul's. He was rector of Pluckley from 1869 and of Bickley from 1873. He was Boyle lecturer in 1866, the lectures being published as <span class="italic">Christ and Christendom</span>. From 1869 to 1874 he was a member of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> revision committee, and from 1872 to 1874 Grinfield lecturer and examiner at Oxford.<br>
<br>In 1881 he resigned his work in London on becoming dean of Wells. He was an ideal dean, possessing a genuine talent for business, and being always ready to consider the suggestions of others. Not only the cathedral and the theological college, but the city of Wells, its hospital, its almshouse, and its workhouse, commanded his service.<br>
<br>Meanwhile his pen was never idle. He wrote much on the interpretation of scripture, endeavouring to combine and popularize, in no superficial fashion, the results attained by labourers in special sections of the subject. He contributed to the commentaries known respectively as the Cambridge <span class="roman">Bible</span>, the <span class="roman">Speaker's Commentary</span>, and the <span class="roman">Bible Educator</span>. His other works included <span class="italic">Biblical Studies</span> (1870; 3rd edn, 1885), <span class="italic">St Paul in Asia</span> (1877), <span class="italic">Movements in Religious Thought: Romanism, Protestantism, Agnosticism</span> (1879), and <span class="italic">Theology and Life</span> (1884). His most remarkable theological work was <span class="italic">The Spirits in Prison, and other Studies on Life after Death</span> (1884&#150;5), a review of previous teaching on the subject of eschatology. His characteristic sympathy with &#145;the larger hope&#146; is moderated throughout by a characteristic caution. He had passed beyond the influence of Maurice, and, though his loyal admiration for his earlier teacher remained unchanged, he had rejected his conclusions.<br>
<br>In 1888 he issued a little work on <span class="italic">Wells Cathedral and its Deans</span>, and in the same year appeared his <span class="italic">Life of Bishop Ken</span>. Though diffuse, the book has something of the charm of Isaak Walton's <span class="italic">Lives</span>, and breathes the still air of a cathedral.<br>
<br>Plumptre published several volumes of verse. He had a keen perception of literary excellence, unappeasable ambition, and unwearied industry; but his gifts were hardly sufficient to ensure him a place among the poets. <span class="italic">Lazarus</span> and other poems appeared in 1864 (3rd edn, 1868), <span class="italic">Master and Scholar</span> in 1866, and <span class="italic">Things New and Old</span> in 1884. All his pieces are refined and earnest; few are really forcible. Three of his hymns were included in <span class="italic">Hymns Ancient and Modern</span>. Plumptre translated the plays of Sophocles (1865) and of Aeschylus (1868). For twenty years he studied Dante, and his English version of Dante's work appeared as <span class="italic">The &#145;Divina Commedia&#146; and &#145;Canzoniere&#146; of Dante Alighieri: with Biographical Introduction, Notes and Essays</span> (2 vols., 1886&#150;7).<br>
<br>Plumptre died on 1 February 1891 at the deanery of Wells, and was buried in the cathedral cemetery beside his wife, who had predeceased him on 3 April 1889. The marriage was childless.<br>
