<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bentley,  Derek William</span>  (1933&#150;1953), <span class="occ">victim of a miscarriage of justice</span>, was born on 30 June 1933 at 13 Surrey Row, Blackfriars Road, Blackfriars, London, the third of five surviving children of William George Bentley (1905&#150;1974), an engineer, and his wife, Lilian Rose (1903&#150;1976), daughter of William Cooper and his wife, Sarah. Bentley, the survivor of a pair of twins, was born into a respectable working-class family. He was legally borderline feeble-minded, with a mental age variously estimated as between nine and twelve years and an IQ of 66&#150;77. He was rejected for national service as mentally sub-standard. He was ill co-ordinated, epileptic, and totally illiterate. He attended several state schools but received little education and left Ingram Road School in July 1948, immediately after his fifteenth birthday. A timid person, he kept many pets, including cats, dogs, and a chicken. He was particularly attached to his elder sister <a name="cosubject_64834"></a><span class="headword">Iris Pamela Bentley</span>  (1931&#150;1997)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 5 August 1931, also a surviving twin, with whom he was dug out of house rubble during the blitz.<br>
<br>At fifteen Bentley was convicted of petty theft and sentenced to twenty-one months at the Kingswood approved school near Bristol. After his release he was mentally disturbed, and refused to leave the house for over six months. He worked as a furniture remover, then as a dustman before being downgraded to road sweeper. He was ultimately dismissed as even this proved beyond him. When arrested for murder he was unemployed, and almost certainly unemployable.<br>
<br>On the night of 2 November 1952 two figures, identified in court as Derek Bentley and Christopher Craig, were seen entering a warehouse in Croydon. The police arrived and trapped the youths on the roof. Detective Constable Fairfax climbed up and seized Bentley, placing him under arrest. Police witnesses claimed&#151;but both defendants steadfastly denied&#151;that Bentley shouted &#145;Let him have it, Chris!&#146;&#151;an instruction which, even supposing it had been said, &#145;was on any showing ambiguous&#146; (as the Court of Appeal observed in 1998). Craig, the dominant male leader, fired a revolver, and Fairfax received a graze on the shoulder and let go of a cowed Bentley, who made no effort to escape. Craig fired several more shots, one of which killed Police Constable Miles. Craig then dived off the roof in a futile effort to kill himself.<br>
<br>Bentley's defence was not well handled. In a two and a half day trial no defence witnesses were called on his behalf, and neither the details of his mental incapacity nor the fact of his being on prescribed medical drugs was revealed. The judge, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31152/', "Lord Chief Justice Rayner Goddard")</script>, was a domineering man who acted in a partisan manner. He created an atmosphere which led to a verdict of guilty by the use of emotional language and behaviour, prematurely used the word &#145;murdered&#146;, muzzled a defence witness, and helped prosecution witnesses; his summing up was also biased and lacked proper direction to the jury. Both Bentley and Craig were found guilty, the former with a jury recommendation for mercy. Craig at sixteen was too young to hang but Bentley was sentenced to death.<br>
<br>Bentley appealed but Goddard refused to add his recommendation for mercy to that of the jury. The appeal was rejected, despite apparently valid legal grounds being available. The home secretary, Sir David Maxwell Fyfe, refused to recommend that the queen exercise the prerogative of mercy. In the House of Commons, Sydney Silverman's attempt to get this decision debated was refused, the speaker ruling that only after Bentley had been executed could it be discussed. There was a widespread feeling of disquiet that Bentley, who was dim-witted, had no record of violence, had no gun, had not fired the shot, and had been under police arrest for fifteen minutes before the fatal shooting, was to hang. Petitions and letters, and even a delegation of MPs, failed to alter Maxwell Fyfe's decision. Bentley was executed at Wandsworth prison at 9 a.m. on 28 January 1953 while an angry crowd waited outside.<br>
<br>There is little doubt that the home secretary was wrong in refusing to commute the sentence of death. Clemency can normally be exercised for any one of the following reasons: youth; mental problems; a jury recommendation for mercy; widespread or strong local public opinion; the principle that if the leading actor cannot be executed then neither should any associate; and the existence of more than a scintilla of doubt about the evidence. Bentley met each criterion. Maxwell Fyfe's advisers recommended clemency but he remained obdurate to the end.<br>
<br>Despite a broken marriage to Stewart Dingwall and a twenty-three-year battle against cancer, Bentley's sister Iris devoted her life to campaigning for a pardon for him. In 1966 his body was disinterred from the grounds of Wandsworth prison and reburied in Croydon cemetery on 4 March. Initially a headstone was not permitted; in July 1994 it was allowed, after a dispute about the wording. The tombstone bears the words &#145;A victim of British justice&#146;. In 1991 Peter Medak's film <span class="italic">Let him have it</span> revived the general public's interest. In 1992 Iris achieved a police re-examination of the case, but the home secretary refused to take further action. A new home secretary, Michael Howard, granted a rather strange partial pardon on 29 July 1993, which admitted it had been wrong to execute but maintained the guilty verdict. During the 1990s linguistic evidence emerged that suggested police witnesses had lied; and Police Constable Claude Pain, who claimed he had been on the warehouse roof at the time, but was never called as a witness, maintained that police witnesses had perjured themselves and the fatal words &#145;Let him have it, Chris&#146; had never been uttered. Iris Bentley died on 22 January 1997 at St George's Hospital, Tooting, and was buried on 31 January at Croydon cemetery.<br>
<br>In 1997 the case was one of the earliest examined by the Criminal Cases Review Commission for a suspected miscarriage of justice. The commission determined that it merited referring back to the Court of Appeal to reconsider the verdict. This time the court decided that the conviction was unsafe and quashed it on 30 July 1998. The lord chief justice, Lord Bingham, ruled that Goddard's summing up had been &#145;a highly rhetorical and strongly-worded denunciation of both defendants and of their defences. The language used was not that of a judge but of an advocate (and it contrasted strongly with the appropriately restrained language of prosecuting counsel)&#146;. The appeal court noted that Bentley's appeal had mistakenly not complained about Goddard's summing up, for it was questionable if it &#145;would have been thought acceptable even by the standards prevailing at the time&#146;  (Court of Appeal judgment in <i>R. v. Bentley</i>, 30 July 1998).<br>
<br>This was one of the most controversial British criminal trials of the twentieth century. It affected public opinion, causing many supporters to reconsider the desirability of capital punishment; it raised the issue of parliament's inability to discuss matters of royal prerogative; it is a case that is regularly cited as an example of the irreversibility of the death penalty should the verdict be later called into question; and it is a shocking reminder that state criminal justice systems can sometimes be barbarous and fail with disastrous consequences.<br>
