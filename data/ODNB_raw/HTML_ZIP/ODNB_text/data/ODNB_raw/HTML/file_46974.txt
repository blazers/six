<span class="headword">Gower, Sir  Thomas</span>, second baronet  (1604/5&#150;1672), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58565/', "Sir Thomas Gower, first baronet (1584&#150;1651)")</script>, of Stittenham, Sheriff Hutton, Yorkshire, and Anne Doyley (<i>d</i>. 1633). He went to Wadham College, Oxford, in 1617, aged twelve, and was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1621; he could be considered a scholar and linguist as well as an active politician. He was knighted in 1630 and the next year, following the death of his first wife, Elizabeth Howard, he married Frances Leveson (1614&#150;1661), a marriage which led to the future aggrandizement of his family. As sheriff of Yorkshire in 1642 he vainly strove to achieve consensus among the Yorkshire gentry as civil war approached. After diligently carrying out the orders of parliament, he was named in the king's commission of array together with Sir Marmaduke Langdale and others previously sympathetic to the parliamentary cause. He, his father, and his five brothers all fought for the king. Having raised a regiment, he lent Charles &pound;2250, eventually receiving repayment in 1665. He criticized the management of the siege of Hull and the damage it did the king's cause and later, in October 1642, commented on the problems Sir John Hotham's success caused the royalists in Yorkshire. He surrendered at Oxford in 1646 and, with Sir Thomas Fairfax's assistance, made his peace with parliament. Compounding cost him &pound;730, which he paid in 1650.<br>
<br>During the interregnum Gower maintained his wife's interest in the great estate of her uncle Sir Richard Leveson of Trentham, Staffordshire, and opposed the machinations of her nephew and rival, Sir Richard Temple of Stowe, Buckinghamshire. The officials of the protectorate regarded him with suspicion and confined him to within a narrow radius of his house in 1657, when two of his brothers were imprisoned; he used this detention to study medicine to help his poor neighbours. Gower's letters to Sir Richard Leveson describe how Fairfax, the duke of Buckingham, and many Yorkshire gentry including the Gowers took York from Lambert at the beginning of 1660.<br>
<br>The Restoration brought Gower into national politics. Although Thomas Danby defeated him in the election for Malton in 1661 Gower won the seat on appeal, and his elder son, Edward, was active in the Scarborough election. Gower served the government in Yorkshire as JP, as deputy lieutenant for the North Riding, as collector of taxes, and as an invaluable source of intelligence on dissident activities. He learned early on of the Yorkshire, or Farmley Wood, plot of 1663, which drew on the large number of disaffected parliamentarians in Yorkshire, and ensured that two of his spies attended the plotters' preliminary meeting at Harrogate on 9 June. He informed the government, who promptly sent the duke of Buckingham north with a troop of horse, and himself began the series of arrests which soon rounded up 100 or so suspects. He continued to monitor developments closely, making use of the informer, Major Joshua Greathead. The planned uprising petered out in October, though the government response was relatively harsh. Gower's deployment of numerous agents had been of considerable value, and he would remain a source of information on suspicious activities in Yorkshire up to 1670.<br>
<br>Gower was a conscientious member of the Cavalier Parliament, serving on 389 committees. He was considered an ally of Buckingham or of Ormond and was not a supporter of Clarendon; indeed, he was far from uncritical of government proceedings. A major disappointment for him was the fate of the Leveson inheritance&#151;for Sir Richard Leveson, who had considered Gower's son Edward as his heir for a time, left the estate to another relation. In 1668, united with his enemy Sir Richard Temple, another disappointed heir, Gower opposed a bill to settle the Leveson estate. An unexpected death in September 1668, however, gave the estate to the next heir, his younger son William, who took the name of Leveson-Gower. Gower continued active in the House of Commons, which instructed him to look into the historic precedents when trade between England and Scotland was being debated in 1668. He spoke in the debate about the assault on Sir John Coventry in 1671 and was serving on a committee enquiring into the growth of popery when he died, at Stittenham Manor, Sheriff Hutton, after a short illness, on 3 September 1672. He was deemed &#145;a right valiant and learned knight and true patriot of his country&#146;  (Plaxton). Gower was buried at Sheriff Hutton church.<br>
