<span class="headword">Poyntz, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>b. </em>late 1440s, <em>d.</em> 1520), <span class="occ">courtier and landowner</span>, was the son of John Poyntz (<i>d</i>. 1465/6), landowner, of Iron Acton, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Alice Cocks, who came from a Bristol merchant family. While a minor his wardship and marriage were granted to Thomas Herbert of Little Troy in Herefordshire in reward for service to the Yorkist cause. A grant of wardship in 1467 indicates that Poyntz was born in the late 1440s. His prominence stemmed more from his marriage in 1479 to Margaret, an illegitimate daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29937/', "Anthony Woodville, second Earl Rivers (c.1440&#150;1483)")</script>, and Gwenllian. The couple had five sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22689/', "Sir Anthony Poyntz (c.1480&#150;1532/3)")</script>, <a href="#cosubject_70797">John Poyntz [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and <a href="#cosubject_22690">Sir Francis Poyntz [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and four daughters. His dependence on Rivers, Edward IV's brother-in-law, led to his advancement to local office in Hampshire, where Rivers held the lordship of the Isle of Wight, first as constable of Carisbroke Castle and then in 1482 as sheriff of the county.<br>
<br>Following Edward's unexpected death and the usurpation of Richard III in spring 1483, Poyntz was replaced as sheriff on the instructions of the new king. Whatever the nature of his involvement in Henry Stafford, second duke of Buckingham's rebellion, by which men hitherto adherents of the Yorkist regime expressed their disillusionment with Richard, he found it expedient to seek sanctuary at Beaulieu Abbey in Hampshire, and it was as &#145;of Beaulieu&#146; that in 1484 he sued out a pardon. Poyntz seems not long after to have gone into exile, where he joined the group of English dissidents centring on Henry Tudor, second earl of Richmond, in Brittany. He was a member of Richmond's expeditionary force landing at Milford Haven in summer 1485, and for his valour at the battle of Bosworth he was knighted on the field by the new king. As a proven supporter of Henry VII, and particularly after the marriage in January 1486 of the king to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8635/', "Elizabeth of York (1466&#150;1503)")</script>, one of his kinswomen, Poyntz belonged to the small circle of trusted men upon whom the Tudor dynasty relied in its formative years. Restored to the bulk of his offices, he took his place as a knight of the body at court while also assuming the role played by his forebears in Gloucestershire. In 1486 he entertained Henry and Elizabeth at Iron Acton while they were travelling to Bristol.<br>
<br>On the marriage of Arthur, prince of Wales, to Katherine of Aragon in 1504, Poyntz and his eldest son, Anthony Poyntz, obtained appointments in their household. Poyntz was successively vice-chamberlain and chancellor of the household to Katherine, remaining in her service until his death on 5 November 1520 when he was aged seventy or more. His last major appearance as a member of her entourage was early in 1520 at the Field of Cloth of Gold, where he received a gift of plate from Fran&ccedil;ois I. At least one other of his sons, John Poyntz, entered Katherine's service, being one of her sewers by 1520. A third son, Francis Poyntz, seems to have benefited from the enlightened educational system promoted by Katherine and to have had sufficient command of Latin to undertake, on his elder brother's suggestion, a translation of a text, then wrongly attributed to the Greek philosopher Cebes, on how a man should conduct his life. He could speak Spanish and French. Of Sir Robert Poyntz's own intellectual achievements there is only one clue, his employment in 1520 of the astronomer and maker of scientific instruments Nicholas Kratzner to provide a design for a sundial at Iron Acton. Poyntz's eldest son, Sir Anthony Poyntz, succeeded him. In turn, he was succeeded by his own heir, <a href="#cosubject_70798">Sir Nicholas Poyntz [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_70797"></a><span class="headword">John Poyntz</span>  (<em>c.</em>1485&#150;1544), <span class="occ">courtier and landowner</span>, was Sir Robert Poyntz's second son. He was returned to the parliament of 1529 as a representative of the Wiltshire borough of Marlborough, which belonged to Katherine as queen consort. He cut a figure in the parliament early in 1533 when he expressed reservations about the important bill in restraint of appeals to Rome. His alignment with other Aragonese supporters evidently did not harm his advancement to the Gloucestershire bench or his marriage prospects, which led to his acquisition of an estate in Surrey. His first marriage, by 1528, to Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Matthew Browne of Betchworth in Surrey, linked him distantly with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11721/', "Sir Henry Guildford (1489&#150;1532)")</script>, comptroller of the royal household. The couple had four sons, including Matthew Poyntz (<i>b</i>. after 1528, <i>d</i>. 1605), and three daughters. He later married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1563/4), daughter of Nicholas Saunders of Charlwood, Surrey, and Alice Hungate. The date of their marriage is unknown but probably occurred in the early 1530s; the couple had two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22692/', "Robert Poyntz (b. c.1535, d. in or after 1568)")</script>, later a Catholic theologian, and William, and two daughters, Alice and Elizabeth. The brother of Poyntz's first wife, Richard, married Margaret's sister, Anne. An indenture between Poyntz and his father-in-law, Nicholas Saunders, possibly resolving his wife's dower rights prior to John's departure on campaign, is dated 1 May 1544  (Maclean, 115). Poyntz's modern fame rests not on his political activity but on a surviving drawing of him by Hans Holbein the younger and an epistolary satire addressed to him by Sir Thomas Wyatt the elder, in which the poet extols the virtues of country living away from &#145;the press of courts&#146;. He fought in the military campaign of 1544, which culminated in the capture of Boulogne. He died on 19 November 1544, either during the final stages of his service abroad or shortly after his return. His eldest son, Henry Poyntz, then aged sixteen, was unable to inherit because he was mentally handicapped, leading to Matthew Poyntz's recognition as heir. His widow later married James Skinner (<i>d</i>. 1558), who was twice elected MP for Reigate, Surrey.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_22690"></a><span class="headword">Sir Francis Poyntz</span>  (<em>c.</em>1487&#150;1528), <span class="occ">diplomat</span>, was Sir Robert Poyntz's third son. He followed his father to court, where by 1516 he was an esquire of the body to Henry VIII, rising in 1521 to be a carver. In 1526 the king granted him the manor of Holborn, Middlesex, during the minority of Edward Stanley, third earl of Derby, and some lands formerly in the possession of Edward Stafford, third duke of Buckingham. Like his oldest brother, Sir Anthony Poyntz, he was also employed in diplomacy. In 1527 the king sent him to Charles V with instructions to negotiate peace between France and the empire. As a mark of the trust shown in him, Henry knighted him. He had an audience with the emperor on 2 July, and although authorized to threaten war if Charles was unresponsive, he failed to persuade him of the reasonableness of his mission. Travelling back from Madrid he met Fran&ccedil;ois in Paris. He died of the plague in London on 26 January 1528, leaving as widow Joan, who was the sister of his brother John Poyntz's wife, Elizabeth: his marriage clearly had formed one of a series linking his family to the Guildfords. There were no children.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_70798"></a><span class="headword">Sir Nicholas Poyntz</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1510, <em>d.</em> 1556), <span class="occ">courtier and landowner</span>, was the eldest son of Sir Anthony Poyntz, naval commander, and his first wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. in or before 1527), daughter of Sir William Huddesfield of Shillingford, Devon. On 24 June 1527 he married Joan (<i>d</i>. in or after 1556), daughter of Thomas Berkeley, <i>de jure</i> fifth Baron Berkeley. The couple had five or six sons, including Sir Nicholas Poyntz (<i>c</i>.1528&#150;1585), and three daughters. The Berkeley family was staunchly Catholic and the connection strengthened Poyntz's local connections in Gloucestershire, but disputes arising out of which properties had been settled on his wife soured his dealings with her kin as well as with his neighbours. These disputes prompted an official investigation by the privy council in October 1541, together with a report on him by the king's council in the marches of Wales. Pending their outcome he was committed to the Fleet prison, but early in 1542 he was released on condition that he resided within 40 miles of London, only to be re-committed several months later. He was finally released following his wife's appearance to plead on his behalf. Although instructed to make amends over two of the properties concerned, he failed to do so, and the matter went to litigation during Edward VI's reign.<br>
<br>Nicholas Poyntz's career was an almost seamless continuation of his father's. In 1532 he accompanied Henry to Calais for the meeting with Fran&ccedil;ois. He was often at court, where by 1539 he had become a groom of the bedchamber. During the 1530s and 1540s he was present for the principal state occasions. He often saw active service on land and at sea. In 1534 he served in Ireland together with other Gloucestershire men, and in 1536 he was a member of the county contingent directed to help suppress the Pilgrimage of Grace. Notwithstanding his initial selection to join the military force sent to the Low Countries in 1543, he was appointed to the naval patrol protecting the Bristol Channel. During 1544 Poyntz saw both military and naval action against the Scots, and his prowess at Calais earned for him the praise of John Russell, Baron Russell. In 1549 he led forces against the western rebellion. His last appearance as a soldier seems to have been in 1554, when he helped to defend the Tower of London against Sir Thomas Wyatt the younger's supporters.<br>
<br>Poyntz seems to have been brought up in the reformist zeal shared by so many of his closest relatives, an aunt in 1522 engaging William Tyndale as tutor to her children. He was prominent among the group of evangelical sympathizers living in the Severn area. Poyntz endowed lectures at his parish church. He displayed his contempt for traditional religious observances by incorporating in several of his properties, including Ozleworth, Gloucestershire, stones from smashed crosses from churches. In August 1535 the king and Anne Boleyn visited him at Iron Acton as part of a progress intended to promote religious change. To accommodate them he erected a new wing which reflected the current Renaissance or &#145;antique&#146; fashion at Whitehall Palace. It was sumptuously equipped with Italian maiolica and Venetian glass. He may have received his knighthood at the culmination of this visit. Poyntz was drawn by Holbein wearing a gold chain denoting his knighthood. His extravagant lifestyle far outstripped his income. He acquired property at the dissolution of the monasteries for &pound;1000, but by 1546 he was forced to surrender part of his property to the crown in settlement of arrears. Poyntz nearly succumbed to his creditors. In October 1541 he was sent to the Fleet prison over a property dispute, and on his deathbed he owed his creditors &pound;700. Poyntz was twice elected to parliament. While knight of the shire for Gloucestershire from 1547 he was imprisoned in the Tower during the winter of 1551&#150;2 as a close adherent of Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset, and in December 1555, while MP for Cricklade, he voted with the opposition to defeat a major government bill penalizing religious exiles. Even so, during the succession crisis in 1553 he did not rally to the protestant Lady Jane Grey against the Catholic Mary Tudor. Poyntz was suspected of complicity in the Dudley conspiracy early in 1556, but his death on 27 or 28 November may have prevented any allegation against him from being investigated. He left some eight surviving children.<br>
