<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Vile,  William</span>  (1714/15&#150;1767), <span class="occ">furniture maker</span>, was probably born in Somerset, where the name is common. Support for a west-country origin is provided by Vile's will, in which he left money to his Humphrey cousins at South Petherton and Middle Lambrook. (Vile's father's will may have been among the twenty-four Vile wills proved in the Taunton archdeaconry, but all of them were destroyed in Second World War air raids on Exeter.) Vile's tombstone inscription in the Wandsworth Huguenot cemetery states that he died in 1767 aged fifty-two years and from this record his birth date has been calculated. In the late 1730s he married Sarah (<i>b</i>. 1709/10); her surname may have been Strickland, as there are bequests to several Strickland nephews and nieces in Vile's will. His wife's Christian name was recorded when their son, William Waldron Vile, was baptized at St Paul's Church, Covent Garden, on 2 June 1740; she died in 1782 and was buried alongside her husband.<h2>
<a name="Educationpartnershipandearlycommissions"></a>Education, partnership, and early commissions</h2>Apprentices were normally put to learn a trade at the age of fourteen years, but the first notice of Vile's affiliation to furniture making was in 1749: on 10 August he wrote on behalf of &#145;My Master&#146;, the maker William Hallett senior (1707&#150;1781), to George Selwyn. The letter suggests that, in view of Vile's marriage, and the birth of his son in 1740, and his needing a job, he probably continued to serve Hallett as a journeyman. By 1749 he was in any case well trained and no longer an apprentice. Soon afterwards he seemed to be hankering after setting up his own furniture making firm.<br>
<br>To set up in business required money and there is evidence to suggest that Vile and his new partner, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39316/', "John Cobb (c.1715&#150;1778)")</script>, turned to Hallett for this. First, the rate books show them establishing premises in London in 1751 in the New Street ward of St Martin-in-the-Fields. By 1752 they were paying rent on four premises&#151;they were next door to Hallett's own premises&#151;but by 1755 the latter's property was taken over by Cobb. Hallett married successfully in 1756 and, significantly, from this year his bank account at the Royal Bank of Scotland, Drummond's branch, London, shows cash paid in from Vile and Cobb, almost monthly, in amounts of &pound;150 to &pound;300. A receipt of 1758 shows various payments from the partners (whose own accounts were at the same bank) totalling &pound;3219; in 1761 there were four further substantial payments, adding up to &pound;2350. It was this intermeshed practical form of financial backing which allowed the partnership to flourish, although there is no reason to think that Cobb, from his training as an upholsterer, looked solely after this side of the business. Either partner received payment, and applied it to their common good.<br>
<br>The furniture that Vile made in partnership with Cobb was done between about 1751 and 1764. In these busy years the two partners took on as apprentices Thomas Plaistowe on 23 December 1752 and John Daniel on 27 February 1753. Their parents were charged the high premiums of &pound;60 and &pound;63 respectively.<br>
<br>The first commission to which Vile's name has been attached was work in 1752&#150;3 for Anthony Chute at The Vyne, Hampshire. The bills, for some &pound;222, cover the whole range of furnishing provision: carpeting, festoon curtains, beds, bedding, neat mahogany chairs stuffed under linen covers, even a stand for Chute's hardstone cabinet, corner and other tables, a walnut bureau, and other minor items such as bellows and hearth brushes. The accepted role for furniture makers then included inventory listing, and sometimes the conduct of funerals. The making of coffins, and their equipping, was a morbid duty of furniture makers to families who had used their service in other ways. When Anthony Chute died in 1754, Vile at least took an inventory of effects, assisted by the London auctioneer John Prestage.<br>
<br>Commissions in the early 1750s were plentiful. Making most of their furniture of mahogany, and assisted now by Samuel Reynolds, who in 1753 had transferred his services from William Hallett senior to Vile and Cobb, the partners worked for the fourth duke of Beaufort providing furniture for Badminton House, Gloucestershire; the second duke of Cleveland of 19 St James's Square, London; Sir William Proctor in Bruton Street, London; and Caroline, Lady Bridges. The reference in the Bridges bill to a mahogany dressing table with cutwork sides is of interest in view of Vile's later use of this style in the early 1760s. It resembled a complex array of thin horizontal and vertical timbers in precise geometrical formation, investing the sides and back of the object with a filigree quality almost unknown before. The firm's fire insurance valuation was first recorded in 1752  (Sun register 95, no. 129677, Guildhall Library, London), for three houses, warehouses, and workshops, but with a valuable stock of timber and mirror glass this was increased by 1755 to &pound;6000.<h2>
<a name="Themiddleyears"></a>The middle years</h2>In an advertisement in the <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span> (20 May 1754) Vile and Cobb had announced themselves as &#145;Messrs Vile &amp; Cobb's Cabinet and Upholstery Warehouse, the corner of St. Martin's Lane, Long Acre&#146;. Neither partner is known to have issued published designs, although they probably made some use of those issued by their contemporary and near neighbour Thomas Chippendale senior (1718&#150;1779) who had issued the first edition of his <span class="italic">The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker's Director</span> in 1754. One of the most important eighteenth-century country houses, Holkham Hall, Norfolk, was ready for furnishing in the 1750s. Its owner, Thomas Coke, earl of Leicester, built the Palladian-style house from 1734, and the work was continued after his death in 1759 by his widow. The earl paid &pound;8 to Vile on 3 May 1755 for a &#145;Pattern Chair like the Duke of Devonshire's&#146;. This was a recognized activity&#151;to make furniture, or indeed parts of buildings, after a pattern seen elsewhere. Vile, as an accomplished craftsman, was also able to provide the earl with a domed bed and all its accoutrements, fabric, fringes, and mattresses, the latter at an extra cost of &pound;4 15<i>s</i>.<br>
<br>There were at least eleven other known commissions in hand in the high years of the firm's activity prior to 1760. These were all for private owners, and none was more supportive than George William, sixth earl of Coventry (1722&#150;1809). The earl patronized several leading furniture makers during his fifty or so years of buying. He had to furnish both a Worcestershire house, Croome Court, and a London house at 29 Piccadilly. Inheriting his title in 1751, he set about rebuilding the Jacobean Croome Court and furnishing it from 1757 onwards. He left the main task of its interior design from about 1760 to the architect Robert Adam (1728&#150;1792), and to Adam's group of reliable craftsmen, including Vile and Cobb. They were, however, involved from a few years earlier, in 1757, and Vile worked on until his retirement in 1764, with his partner continuing to work for the earl until 1773. Their various bills in the Croome estate office have been listed and some of the furniture itself, together with that of other makers, is still in the possession of family descendants. Much has since moved to other locations&#151;for example, a pair of looking-glasses and pier-tables, supplied by Vile and Cobb in 1760 for &pound;173 and &pound;33 12<i>s</i>. respectively, is now at Temple Newsam House, Leeds. In June 1763 the library at Croome Court was embellished with two pedimented breakfront bookcases, made to correspond with the Ionic frame of the room's Venetian window. Adam supplied the detailed drawings for Vile and Cobb to work to, and they charged &pound;260 for their work which included two men working for 226 days at the house taking down old bookcases and putting up the new ones. The applied carving in the bookcase pilasters was entrusted to the carver Sefferin Alken (<i>fl</i>. 1744&#150;1783), who was also employed again on carving a clothes press. This last was supplied by Vile and Cobb in 1764, but after Vile's retirement Cobb charged a further &pound;129 on 26 February 1766 for changing the press into a pair of cabinets. These bookcases and cabinets are now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. From the late 1750s the firm, with plenty of work, had been employing the furniture makers William France senior (<i>c</i>.1734&#150;1773) and John Bradburne (<i>fl</i>. 1750&#150;1781), and they were presumably responsible for much of the finer carved work on some of the pieces made in these years.<h2>
<a name="Royalservice17611764"></a>Royal service, 1761&#150;1764</h2>After receiving the royal warrant on 5 January 1761 which confirmed Vile and his partner as &#145;Joint Upholsterers in Ordinary to His Majesty's Great Wardrobe&#146;  (TNA: PRO, LC 5/57) their names started to appear regularly in accounts, firstly for the quarter ending Lady day (25 March) 1761. All their relevant bills are in the bill books of the great wardrobe  (TNA: PRO, LC 9/306&#150;10), the organization responsible for the embellishment of royal palaces. They made much of their new position, soon providing George III and his wife, Queen Charlotte, with several pieces of furniture. An important medal cabinet, started in 1760 for the king, now only survives in the form of its two end-cabinets. The central part connecting the ends probably consisted of drawers and folio shelves. Vile charged in 1761 for &#145;3 Difft pieces of work fited in Bet. the Legs of His Majesty's Grand Medal Case with Carved Doors &amp; Ends and a New Sub plinth to Do on a Frame, &pound;80&#146;  (TNA: PRO, LC 9/306). The two end-cabinets have been described in detail  (Shrub), and are in the collections, respectively, of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Despite being but part of the whole they are very impressive in appearance.<br>
<br>In 1761 Vile also made a superb mahogany bureau-cabinet for Queen Charlotte's apartments. It was invoiced at &pound;71 in March 1762, and included similar cutwork sides to the dressing table provided to Lady Bridges in 1753. The cutwork is a feature of at least three other secretaire cabinets. Two of these were made for Robert D'Arcy, fourth earl of Holdernesse, secretary of state from 1751 to 1761. It is a form that has gone through the salerooms frequently, but a good example of &#145;handsome cuttwork&#146;, as it appears in accounts, may be found on the secretaire acquired by Noel Terry in 1964, and now part of the collection he bequeathed to Fairfax House, Castlegate, York, where it is on permanent display.<br>
<br>Perhaps the two finest items made by Vile for Queen Charlotte (and still in the Royal Collection) are her jewel cabinet and a fine bookcase, both dated to 1761. The first has a mahogany frame with its front ends and top inlaid with ivory, and is further embellished with veneers of several exotic woods&#151;olive, padouk, amboyna, tulip, and rosewood. The hinged top is inlaid with the royal arms, and a concealed catch secures this. It can only be opened when the doors are also open. Therein is a nest of eight drawers and a further drawer, secured by a lock. It cost &pound;138 10<i>s</i>. in 1762 and has often been illustrated. Queen Charlotte's jewels were celebrated and were purchased by George III from his uncle. The bookcase, always credited to Vile, has been similarly illustrated, but the bill for it needs explanation. The bookcase, as at present, does not have one of the distinctive features described in the bill: &#145;one side of this is all in one Door that opens from Top to bottom and serves for the Door that goes into the Water Closet within the Bed Chamber&#146;  (TNA: PRO, LC 9/308). The entry implies that the bookcase was made for the queen's bedroom on the north-west corner of Buckingham House. A closet was in the north-east corner of the room, to the left of the queen's bed, and it could be expected that the bookcase showed some evidence of this opening. None has been found. When the bookcase was exhibited in an exhibition held at the queen's gallery, Buckingham Palace, in 1990 (&#145;A royal miscellany&#146;, no. 2), it was noted that a possible explanation might lie in a subsequent payment of &pound;31 in 1767, to John Bradburne. With his partner, William France senior, Bradburne had succeeded Vile and Cobb in royal service and remedial tasks lay therefore with them. With the payment there is an entry which reads, &#145;A New Mahogany Book Press made out of the Water Closet which was one Part a Book Press, the other part a Passage Door, but now the Whole Front is made into one Press&#146;  (TNA: PRO, LC 9/314). It was, if this explanation is correct, a careful transformation of Vile's work.<br>
<br>One of the most unusual tasks Vile was entrusted with in 1763 by his royal patrons was to amend a mahogany organ case which had been made about 1735, probably by Benjamin Goodison. He was to refashion it to form a cabinet and did this at a charge of &pound;57. This involved putting the whole on a mahogany plinth and ornamenting it with &#145;Ovals of Laurels and other Carved Ornaments &amp; Carved Mouldings&#146;  (TNA: PRO, LC 9/308, 310). The ovals had appeared on pieces made in the Hallett shop. Vile, from his years there, carried forward the idea and their presence is usually some indication of his involvement, given a correct date and, hopefully, some documentation. The resulting piece in the Royal Collection has been illustrated both in its early and later states. Finally, among much else, a small item for which &pound;5 5<i>s</i>. was charged in 1764  (TNA: PRO, LC 9/293) was the carcass of a large shaped toilet-table, made from mahogany. The serpentine shape of this can be discerned beneath the fabric &#145;toylette&#146; in the painting by Johan Zoffany, <span class="italic">Queen Charlotte with her Two Eldest Sons</span> (1764; Royal Collection).<br>
<br>On 31 May 1763 the master of the great wardrobe, Francis, Baron le Despencer, had nominated William France senior to succeed Vile and Cobb in royal service, and in the following June a similar concession was granted to France's partner, John Bradburne  (TNA: PRO, LC 5/57). No reason was given for Vile's discharge, but it is known that he &#145;retired&#146; at the age of forty-nine years, made his will, and was dead three years later. So he was probably unfit for health reasons to carry on his trade, and there seems no reason to attribute his discharge from service to overcharging. Some overcharging by his firm had occurred&#151;in the first quarter of 1763 there was a deduction of &pound;75 for work in the &#145;New Japan Room&#146; of the queen's house, the total being reduced from &pound;858 18<i>s</i>. to &pound;783 18<i>s</i>.  (TNA: PRO, LC 9/308). Vile had also been guilty of overcharging Lord Folkestone in 1760  (Coleridge, <span class="italic">Chippendale</span>), but this was a common trait among craftsmen, and was usually due more to faulty calculation than to dishonesty. There is no doubt that Vile and his partner were competent at what they had done over some fourteen years, and Cobb's success in trade in later years presages what the two of them might have accomplished had Vile not been sickly in health, forcing his early retirement.<h2>
<a name="Willanddeath"></a>Will and death</h2>With ever-present thoughts of his mortality thrust upon him, Vile compiled his will in August 1763. He bequeathed to his wife, Sarah, two houses then in his own possession at Battersea Hill, his household furniture, and a sum of &pound;300. There were bequests to his nephews John and William Strickland, and &pound;20 each to his workmen Samuel Reynolds, John Bradburne, and William Eversley. He owned that he had not made any calculations in respect of his partnership with John Cobb, and left the settlement of this to his two executors, William Hallett senior and the London upholsterer and cabinet maker Charles Smith (<i>fl</i>. 1763&#150;1767). They were to make such allowances to Cobb as they thought proper, and to invest the remainder of the estate so that his wife could receive &pound;25 a year in her lifetime, and at her death this was to pass to a named list of nieces and nephews. Wills often have later codicils added, and Vile's was no exception. On 9 November 1764 the &pound;20 he had left to his three workmen was only to be paid them if they were still in Vile's employment at his death. This excluded Bradburne, who had taken up royal service at Vile's discharge, and the &pound;20 went instead to Mrs Vile. Reynolds continued with Vile and Cobb, not only appearing as a friend to testify to his knowledge of Vile when the will was proved on 23 September 1767, but also serving John Cobb in later years. Of Eversley nothing further is known. The cause of Vile's death on 21 August 1767 in Battersea is likewise unknown.<br>
<br>It was established by Tessa Murdoch that Vile was buried in the Huguenot cemetery at Wandsworth, although neither he nor his wife is known to have any Huguenot connection. The inscription on his chest tomb is now almost illegible, but was, fortunately, transcribed in 1885. It reads: &#145;In memory of William Vile, Gent., of St. John's Place Battersea who died August 21st, 1767 Aged 52 years. Also the body of Mrs Sarah Vile, his Wife, who died June the 17th, 1782, Aged 72 years&#146;.<br>
