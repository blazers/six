<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dobson,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1611, <em>d.</em> 1646), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was baptized at St Andrew's, Holborn, London, on 24 February 1611  (City of London Guildhall MS 6667/1). His father was also called William Dobson (<i>d</i>. 1626), and was probably the painter&#150;stainer mentioned in the corporation of London court of common council records on 5 February 1622  (journal 31, fol. 393). John Aubrey described the artist's father as a gentleman who was assistant to the lord chancellor, Francis Bacon, helping him in the building and decoration of Verulam House, near St Albans  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 1.78). In 1607 a William Dobson was paying taxes at &#145;The Villa, Albani&#146;. Whether he was the same William Dobson who was master of the alienation office and &#145;clerk of recognizances for recovery of debts in the Courts of the Chief Justices of King's Bench and Common Pleas&#146;  (Spencer, xiv) remains speculative. William Dobson senior married Alice Barnes (<i>d</i>. 1642&times;4?), a prosperous mercer's daughter, on 8 April 1605 at All Hallows, Honey Lane, London, and they had eight children. At her death in 1642, the artist's grandmother Katherine Barnes owned a number of pictures, including <span class="italic">Judith and Holofernes</span> and two royal portraits  (PROB 11/191/20).<br>
<br>Facts about Dobson's life are few. He was married twice: in the first instance to Elizabeth (surname unknown, date of marriage unknown), who was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 26 September 1634, and secondly to Judith Sander on 18 December 1637 at St Bride's, Fleet Street, London  (Guildhall MS 6537). After his death, Judith may have been married again, to one Henry Boulton in 1648, but, although according to Aubrey  (2.318) she lived to see the Restoration, her death has not been traced.<br>
<br>Dobson senior lived beyond his means, and when he died intestate in February 1626, the young Dobson was forced to think of earning a living. According to Buckeridge, Dobson spent his apprenticeship under William Peake, the Holborn picture dealer, printseller, and stationer  (Buckeridge, 369). Elizabeth's death in St Martin-in-the-Fields suggests the young Dobsons had set up house there. Abraham van der Doort, surveyor of the king's pictures, would have been their neighbour in St Martin's Lane, which was close to the court in Whitehall. A haunting portrait, possibly by Dobson and traditionally said to be van der Doort, who committed suicide in 1640, now hangs in the Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg. Richard Symonds noted that Dobson then took further training under Francis Cleyn, the German engraver, decorative painter, and designer of Mortlake tapestries, whose work survives at Ham House, Middlesex  (Symonds, fol. 89<i>v</i>). Cleyn's influence can be seen in Dobson's curious painting at Rousham, Oxfordshire, entitled <span class="italic">The Civil Wars of France</span>, made in preparation for the engraved frontispiece to the translation by Sir Charles Cotterell and William Aylesbury of D'Avila's <span class="italic">Istoria delle guerre civili di Francia</span> published in 1647.<br>
<br>During his formative years Dobson is said to have had &#145;the advantage of copying many excellent Pictures, especially some of Titian and Van Dyck&#146;  (Buckeridge, 369). Anthony Van Dyck had arrived in London in 1632, and later imported his private collection of paintings known as his Cabinet du Titien. According to Graham, Dobson's first biographer, it was through Van Dyck's encouragement that Dobson received royal favour  (Graham, 340). Dobson plainly benefited from this contact with the king's principal painter, and with van der Doort's help, too, he would have been able to view the exceptional pictures (many Venetian) in the Royal Collection. <span class="italic">The Four Ages of Man</span>, now at Hardwick Hall, Derbyshire, and thought to be one of Dobson's rare subject paintings, is indebted to both Van Dyck and Titian. Copying may have provided him with a meagre living, but a paucity of surviving works from the 1630s shows that Dobson did not easily build a reputation. Rogers estimated that he set up independently by about 1640, not the most auspicious moment to start a career  (Rogers, 12).<br>
<br>The metropolis was seething with unrest, and the king and his supporters abandoned London in January 1642. Civil war skirmishing began in early summer, and in October the court settled in Oxford. The Dobsons moved to Oxford early in 1643, where in April 1644 William was listed as a parishioner of All Saints in the High Street. Here, in 1645, another Elizabeth Dobson was buried (perhaps a child of William's first wife). The Dobsons presumably remained there until the court left the city in June 1646. William found a workshop assistant, a priest called Hesketh, who also painted landscapes. There is a puzzling reference in Symonds's notebook  (fol. 102) to a Mr Vaughan of the exchequer office releasing Dobson from prison by paying his debts, but this incident cannot be placed or dated. It proves only that Dobson received few financial rewards either in London or in Oxford.<br>
<br>Van Dyck died in December 1641 and, without his towering shadow, Dobson could make more headway. He was called upon to paint not only the king (priv. coll.), the prince of Wales, the duke of York (both Royal Collection), and the palatine princes Rupert and Maurice (both priv. coll.), but many of the cavaliers who had flocked to Oxford. A fine <i>ad vivum</i> study (NMM) of the elderly Inigo Jones dates from this period (second version, Chiswick House, Department of the Environment). Dobson built up a busy practice, and possibly took profile drawings of the king and the prince of Wales for the military award medals produced by Thomas Rawlins in Oxford. Rawlins wrote a collection of poems called &#145;Calanthe&#146; (now lost) which contained a eulogy to Dobson. The title referred to Dobson's royal appointment as serjeant painter to the king and groom of the privy chamber, and the artist was hailed as &#145;the very Soul of Art, the Prince and Prime of Painters&#146;  (Vertue, BL, Add. MS 19027, fol. 43<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Apart from one drawing attributed to Dobson (see Brown, 70&#150;71; Rogers, 11) there are no preparatory drawings by his hand. He usually worked <i>alla prima</i>, painting directly onto the canvas. His earlier Oxford portraits are rich in pigment, but towards the end of 1645 the paint begins to be brushed thinly onto visibly unprimed canvases, revealing the difficulty of getting materials during wartime. As royal hopes sank, his portraits took on a &#145;ghostly insubstantiality&#146;  (Rogers, 19). Three of Dobson's paintings were engraved by William Faithorne (another of Peake's trainees) and sold in London, but surprisingly few were copied by miniaturists.<br>
<br>Dobson's portraits are distinguished by their directness. They glow with brightly coloured silks and rose-red royalist sashes, and often carry symbolic allusions to the sitter's role in life. Lacking the spaciousness of Van Dyck's portraits, Dobson's portraits fill the canvas, and he conveyed their individuality with force. He painted intimate head and shoulders compositions, such as the portrait of his wife, Judith (priv. coll.), or his good friend and patron Sir Charles Cotterell, master of ceremonies to Charles I (priv. coll.), which is counted among his finest personal tributes. His unfinished painting of the king is equally sensitive (priv. coll.).<br>
<br>Dobson attempted full-length portraits but these are less successful. He also experimented with double and triple portraits, and whole families, though his skill at bringing individual studies together into one composition is doubtful. His group portraits have been described as &#145;inelegant&#146;, but some can be applauded for their vigour and novelty. His triple portrait of Prince Rupert and Colonel John Russell, with Colonel William Murray dipping his cockade into a glass of wine (priv. coll.), commemorated a particular historical moment. There is a mock-heroic analogy in the choice of Hercules behind another painting of himself with Sir Charles Cotterell, who appears to be shielding him from the pleasurable temptation offered by a third figure, almost certainly Nicholas Lanier (priv. coll.).<br>
<br>By far Dobson's most successful portrayals are half and three-quarter lengths. Those painted between 1640 and 1644, such as <span class="italic">Endymion Porter</span> (Tate collection), <span class="italic">The Prince of Wales</span> (Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh), and <span class="italic">John, first Lord Byron</span> (University of Manchester), brim with resplendent colour and rich impasto, as well as defiant confidence in the royal cause. Lord Byron's portrait, which is painted in flamboyant gold, scarlet, and crimson, was chosen to represent the visual richness of this era in the &#145;Treasure houses&#146; exhibition at the National Gallery, Washington, DC, in 1985. The portraits of Sir Thomas Chicheley (priv. coll.) and Sir Richard Fanshaw (Valence House Museum, Dagenham, Essex) are perhaps the most Van Dyckian and confident of his works. Other likenesses, such as those of Colonel Richard Neville (NPG), the earl of Northampton (priv. coll.), the earl of Macclesfield (Dunedin Art Gallery, New Zealand), Lord Rockingham (priv. coll.), and Sir Charles Lucas (priv. coll.), reflect the anxieties of wartime and the sitters' fears for the future. The last two particularly show the raw weave of the canvas beneath the thin paint. Another late picture, signed and dated 1645, of an unknown girl from the Annesley or Hanbury families (Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery), demonstrates his sympathetic touch when painting women.<br>
<br>Dobson painted several self-portraits. Buckeridge described him as:<blockquote>a fair middle-sized man, of ready wit, and a pleasing conversation, yet being somewhat loose and irregular in his way of living, he, notwithstanding the many opportunities he had of making his fortune, died poor at his house in St. Martin's Lane &hellip; (Buckeridge, 369)</blockquote>His burial took place on 28 October 1646 at St Martin-in-the-Fields  (Westminster city archives, St Martin's register, no. 3). His death was plainly unexpected for he had been nominated as a steward of the Painter&#150;Stainers' Company on 5 August  (Guildhall MS 5667/1, fol. 209).<br>
<br>Considering that artists of standing at the English court until then (and indeed for the following seventy years) were, with the exceptions of the miniaturists Hilliard and Cooper, imported from abroad, it was astonishing that there should emerge such a striking home-bred talent, able to convey with penetrating sensitivity such psychological depths. As a gentleman, Dobson would have brought a personal insight into the values of the aristocracy when many were under threat. A very promising career, with only some sixty known paintings to his credit, was cut short at the age of thirty-five. His influence can be detected in the paintings of Sir Peter Lely, John Michael Wright (who also trained with Cleyn), Isaac Fuller, and John Hayls. For many years he was overlooked, but two exhibitions in the twentieth century (the exhibitions at the Tate Gallery in 1951 and at the National Portrait Gallery in 1983&#150;4) established his reputation among the first rank of English painters. Other examples of Dobson's works are in the National Gallery, London; the Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh; the Tate collection; the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich; the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool; and the Courtauld Institute.<br>
