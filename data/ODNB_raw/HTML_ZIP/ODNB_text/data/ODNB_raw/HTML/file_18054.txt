<span class="headword">Margetson,  James</span>  (1600&#150;1678), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland archbishop of Armagh</span>, was a native of Drighlington, Yorkshire. He matriculated at Peterhouse, Cambridge, in Michaelmas 1619, and graduated BA (1622&#150;3) and MA (1626). Ordained deacon and priest at Peterborough in 1626, he was rector of Thornton Watlass, Yorkshire, from 1626 to 1635. Sir Thomas Wentworth took him as chaplain to Ireland, where he served as dean of Waterford, beginning in 1635, and rector of Arvagh, co. Cavan (1635&#150;7). He became rector of Galloon (Dartry), co. Monaghan, in 1637; dean of Derry in 1638; prebendary of St Fin Barre's, Cork, in 1639; and dean of Christ Church, Dublin, in December 1639. No new dean of Derry was appointed until after the Restoration. Margetson was incorporated doctor of divinity at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1637. He was prolocutor of the lower house of convocation in 1639.<br>
<br>When the rebellion of 1641 broke out, Margetson assisted refugees in Dublin. In August 1646 he signed the document in which eleven bishops and seventy-seven other clergymen congratulated Ormond upon the conclusion of peace, and thanked him for his efforts on their behalf. The parliamentary forces controlling Dublin in June 1647 ordered the protestant clergy to use the directory for worship instead of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. The bishop of Killaloe and eighteen clergymen, of whom Margetson was one, formally protested, unsuccessfully seeking to continue the traditional liturgy.<br>
<br>Ormond left Ireland on 28 August 1647, and Margetson fled to England about the same time. There he conducted services according to the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. Imprisoned at Manchester, he was freed in a prisoner exchange. After settling in London, he dispersed alms from wealthier cavaliers to needy loyalists in England and Wales, reportedly including William Chappell, bishop of Cork, Milton's old tutor.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Margetson was sworn of the Irish privy council in December 1660. On 29 January 1661 he was consecrated archbishop of Dublin and bishop of Glendalough; he also held his old living of Galloon, his Cork prebend, and the treasurership of St Patrick's, Dublin. To augment the revenues of his archbishopric, he and his successors received the lands of those attainted by treason formerly held of the archbishopric and the see of Glendalough, and various properties, rectories, and vicarages in co. Dublin and elsewhere to the value of &pound;1000 p.a. net, but the maximum income was not to exceed &pound;2000 p.a.<br>
<br>Margetson was translated to the archbishopric of Armagh on 20 August 1663, where he succeeded John Bramhall, who reportedly recommended him on his deathbed to Ormond. As an archbishop, Margetson generally followed a moderate course in dealing with protestant nonconformists. The Presbyterian Patrick Adair, who called him &#145;a man of mild spirit&#146;, averred that he was &#145;not of a persecuting temper, but rather inclinable to engage the country and increase his estate&#146;  (Adair, 282, 300). Although as archbishop of Dublin he had prohibited the Presbyterian Edward Bagshaw from preaching, as archbishop of Armagh he later permitted John Howe, ejected from his living but by then Lord Massereene's chaplain, to preach in Antrim's parish church. When Margetson succeeded Bramhall, he implemented a policy of indulgence for six months, infuriating George Wild, bishop of Derry. On his triennial visitation in 1664, Margetson persuaded some dissenters in Derry to conform. Meanwhile, with Michael Boyle, archbishop of Dublin, he endeavoured to protect protestantism in the face of increased Catholic activity in 1664, and six years later he was monitoring the work of Oliver Plunket, Catholic archbishop of Armagh.<br>
<br>By 1669 the growing number of conventicles in Dublin worried Margetson, and as covenanter activity increased in the late 1660s he opposed an indulgent policy, avouching that almost every Ulster parish had a Presbyterian meeting-house, and that presbyteries had been established, ministers salaried, and elders elected. To demonstrate his authority over Roger Boyle, bishop of Down and Connor, Margetson declined in 1670 to prosecute nine Presbyterian ministers, though he left four in prison elsewhere for refusing to subscribe the oath of supremacy.<br>
<br>Margetson acted in numerous ways to uphold the established church, and opposed the practice of holding an ecclesiastical post in Ireland while residing in England. Following Jeremy Taylor's death in August 1667, he insisted that the sees of Dromore, on the one hand, and Down and Connor on the other be separated because they were disorderly and disaffected. He succeeded Jeremy Taylor as vice-chancellor of Dublin University and remained in office until his death. Earlier, in November 1663, he had been appointed the king's almoner, for which he received a stipend of &pound;100 (English). By 1668 his annual income exceeded &pound;3500. Armagh Cathedral had been burnt by Sir Phelim O'Neill in 1642, and Margetson contributed generously to its rebuilding, as he also did to the refurbishing of St Patrick's and Christ Church cathedrals, Dublin. He founded a free school at Drighlington and made the master of Peterhouse its patron. At the king's appointment he was responsible in 1666 for adding special prayers to the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> for 30 January, 29 May, 23 October, and 5 November, and in 1670 he and other prominent clerics were commissioned to review the profits of all ecclesiastical livings with a view to more accurately assessing first-fruits and twentieths.<br>
<br>In the winter of 1677 Margetson became seriously ill and suffered fainting spells, but nevertheless insisted on communicating publicly the following May. By this point his house had become an oratory for private devotion. He died in Dublin on 28 August 1678, and was buried two days later within the altar rails of Christ Church. His charity and exemplary life had won him such reputation that many came to his deathbed to receive his blessing. At his funeral Dr William Palliser spoke of his conciliatory attitude towards theological opponents. According to Henry Jones, bishop of Meath, who preached his funeral sermon, he left &pound;4000 apiece to two children.<br>
<br>Margetson's son James (BA 1676, MA 1679, Trinity College, Dublin) was ordained at Lincoln in 1699, and served as rector of Little Stukeley, Huntingdonshire (1699&#150;1701), and vicar of Exning, Suffolk (1701&#150;37); he died on 4 March 1737. His son John was killed at the siege of Limerick, being then a major in William's army, leaving a daughter, Sarah, from whom the earls of Bessborough and Mountcashell are descended. The earl of Charlemont is descended from Anne Margetson (<i>d</i>. 1729), the primate's only daughter.<br>
