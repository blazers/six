<span class="headword">Banister,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1570&#150;1626), <span class="occ">oculist</span>, whose precise date and place of birth are unknown, was the son of Gabriel Banister. He was one of four brothers, two of whom died early, all apprenticed to surgeons or barber&#150;surgeons. His grandfather was John Banister of Cobham, Surrey. He studied surgery under his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1280/', "John Banister (or Banester)")</script> and practised for fourteen years in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, during which time he was also trained in couching cataracts by various oculists, including the itinerant Henry Blackborne, Robert Hall of Worcester, Master Velder of Fennie-Stanton, Master Surflet of Lynne, and Master Barnabie of Peterborough. From these he learned &#145;much practice, but little Theorie&#146;, for which reason, by his own account, he read late at night the writings of &#145;Rasis, Mesue, Fernelius, Vesalius, and others&#146;. Thereafter Banister was based in Stamford, 25 miles from Sleaford, travelling as requested to other towns, such as Norwich and even London. He practised primarily as an oculist, but also gave &#145;helpe of Hearing by the instrument, the cure of the Hare-lip, and the wry Necke&#146;.<br>
<br>An incomplete and anonymous memoir preserved in the British Library (MS Sloane 3801), entitled &#145;Briefe discourse of ye chefeste oculistes&#146;, can confidently be assigned to Banister. It is an important source for the social role of early English oculists, as in it he comments on the prominent oculists of his day and on his own training. The names of many of these contemporary oculists are repeated in the preface to his <span class="italic">Breviary of the Eyes</span>, a collection of aphorisms, ocular therapies, and case histories compiled by Banister in 1621 while in Stamford; it was published the following year in London, as an essay preceding a reprint of an English translation (said by Banister to be long unavailable) of the <span class="italic">Trait&eacute; des maladies de l'oeil qui sont en nombre de cent treize</span> by Jacques Guillemeau, originally published in Paris in 1585. The first printing of this English translation had appeared in London some time between 1586 and 1589 under the title <span class="italic">A Worthy Treatise of the Eyes</span>; the translator, given as A. H. (possibly A. Hunton of Nottinghamshire), had, like Guillemeau himself, dedicated the work to Banister's uncle, John Banister. It was bound in one volume with three other medical treatises. These same three treatises were included, along with the English translation of Guillemeau's book, in Banister's book, published in 1622 under the general title <span class="italic">A treatise of one hundred and thirteene diseases of the eyes, and eye-liddes, the second time published, with some profitable additions of certaine principles and experiments</span>. From the preface it is evident that Banister did not intend to claim credit for any but the first item, his <span class="italic">Breviary of the Eyes</span>, although later writers unjustly accused him of plagiarism.<br>
<br>Banister's <span class="italic">Breviary</span> contains, in addition to an expos&eacute; of &#145;proud quacksalving Mountebankes&#146; and &#145;emptie empirickes&#146;, some interesting observations of medical practices of the day. In it he recognized hardness of the eye as an important diagnostic and prognostic sign, anticipating by a century and a quarter the work of J. Z. Platner. Banister also published <span class="italic">An Appendent Part of a Treatise of One Hundred and Thirteene Diseases of the Eyes</span>, which was intended to follow on the <span class="italic">Breviary</span>, published in 1622, but was in fact printed in London the year before. It consists of sixteen chapters devoted to the uses of a &#145;purging Ale&#146; of his devising, with case histories attesting to its usefulness.<br>
<br>Of Banister's personal life very little is known, although he has provided many anecdotes about other oculists of his day. His first wife, Anne, died in 1624 in Stamford; they had three daughters, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1619), Brigett, and Susan, and four sons, Gabriel, Richard, John, and Francis. Banister died in April 1626 at the age of about 56 and was buried on 7 April 1626 at St Mary's churchyard in Stamford. He had been a benefactor of the church, having built a public library in the south choir to which he donated books, including the writings of Galen and others on medicine and surgery; he left an additional sum in his will for the continued increase and maintenance of the library. His personal library appears to have been substantial, for in his will he divided his collection of medical and Latin books, as well as his medical equipment, among his sons. To his two surviving daughters he left &pound;50 each, large trunks, and all his English books, with the elder also receiving a cloak and gown belonging to his first wife, and the younger his medical bag and <i>lignum vitae</i>. His second wife, Elizabeth, was left the lands he owned in Stamford and in the county of Northampton.<br>
