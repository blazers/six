<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Nixon, Sir  John Eccles</span>  (1857&#150;1921), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Brentford, Middlesex, on 16 August 1857, the youngest son of Captain John Piggott Nixon of the 25th Bombay native infantry and later the Indian political service and his wife, Ellen, daughter of G. Cooper of Brentford. He was educated at Wellington College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Nixon was commissioned as a sub-lieutenant in the 75th foot in September 1875. In May 1878 he entered the Bengal staff corps and joined the 18th Bengal cavalry. For ten years he served with his regiment, fighting in the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1879&#150;80) and the Zaimukht punitive expedition, for which he was mentioned in dispatches. In 1881 he participated in the Mahsud Waziri expedition on the north-west frontier. Nixon joined the garrison instruction staff in April 1888 as a captain, beginning a fifteen-year period of continuous staff employment during which he served with the Chitral relief force (1895) and the Tochi field force (1897&#150;8). For the former he was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel in January 1896, and was mentioned in dispatches on both occasions. With the rank of colonel Nixon was appointed an assistant quartermaster-general in March 1899, and at the end of 1901 he was sent to South Africa where he remained until the end of the South African War, commanding a cavalry column operating in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. Nixon was awarded the campaign medal with four clasps, was mentioned in dispatches, and was created CB in 1902.<br>
<br>Following his return to India, Nixon held a succession of command and staff appointments. In 1902 he resumed his job as assistant quartermaster-general for intelligence. In May 1903 he was made commander of a second-class district, in August 1906 inspector-general of cavalry, and in May 1908 a divisional commander. Nixon was then given the prestigious appointment of general officer commanding the southern army in October 1912, which he held until February 1915, when he assumed command of the northern army. During this period he rose steadily through the ranks: major-general in March 1904, lieutenant-general in February 1909, and finally general in May 1914, establishing a reputation as an energetic and capable staff officer and commander. For his services he was created KCB in 1911.<br>
<br>In April 1915 Nixon took command of Indian expeditionary force D deployed in Mesopotamia, which had originally landed in November 1914 following the entry of Turkey into the war to protect Basrah and oilfields near the Shatt al-&#145;Arab. Shortly after he arrived the Turkish army attacked an entrenched British position at Shaybah, but they were repulsed after heavy fighting. General Sir Beauchamp Duff, commander-in-chief in India, ordered Nixon to retain control of the Basrah vilayet, the mouth of the Tigris River, and as much of the surrounding area as deemed necessary to protect a pipeline and local oilfields. Although the secretary of state for India had expressly ordered that no further advances should be undertaken, Nixon was also instructed by Duff, after acquainting himself with the local position, to submit plans to secure the Basrah vilayet and for a subsequent advance on Baghdad. He was also specifically ordered to report on the military requirements of such an expedition, particularly about the adequacy and suitability of the river transport expected to arrive from India, Burma, and Egypt.<br>
<br>A series of operations was undertaken under Nixon's command, with the approval of the government of India, to control the Basrah vilayet. On 31 May troops led by Sir Charles Townshend captured a strong Turkish position at Kurna, despite severe flooding of the surrounding area. This difficult feat of arms was followed by the capture of Amara, 90 miles upriver, and then Nasiriyyah on 25 July, which was defended by a large Turkish force. Following these successful operations an elated and over-optimistic Nixon proposed, in order to consolidate control of the Basrah vilayet, the capture of Kut al-Amara, located 150 miles upriver, which was eventually sanctioned by the government of India and the cabinet. The enemy defensive positions on either side of the river were skilfully captured by Sir Charles Townshend, who entered Kut on 29 September. The defeated Turks were pursued 60 miles further northwards to Aziziyyah, which was occupied on 3 October and fortified as the northernmost British defensive outpost.<br>
<br>Nixon was not content with his recent successes, however, and proposed further offensive operations to offset the effects of recent Turkish victories at the Dardanelles. On 3 October he telegraphed the secretary of state for India, &#145;I consider I am strong enough to open the road to Baghdad, and with this intention I propose to concentrate at &#145;Aziziyyah&#146;. Nixon's force was still badly short despite repeated earlier requests for tugs, barges, and other shipping, however, on which he was completely dependent for transport and supply along the narrow, winding Tigris River. Moreover, reserves of medical personnel and stores available in Mesopotamia and India were insufficient to support a major operation. The deadlock at the Dardanelles finally convinced the cabinet of the merits of advancing on Baghdad. Two Indian divisions were dispatched from France as reinforcements, but no serious endeavour was made to increase the amount of water transport. Despite continued doubts expressed by Sir Beauchamp Duff that insufficient troops and transport were available, on 23 October 1915 the secretary of state authorized Nixon to advance if he judged sufficient forces were at his disposal for the operation.<br>
<br>On 22 November Townshend attacked a superior number of Turkish troops entrenched in a strong position astride the Tigris at Ctesiphon. By nightfall the battle was lost, and several days later Townshend conducted a fighting retreat to Kut, where he was besieged on 6 December by several Turkish divisions. A series of unsuccessful attempts was made to relieve the beleaguered division by the remaining British and Indian troops in Mesopotamia and further reinforcements. Sir John Nixon relinquished his command on 19 January 1916 through ill health, leaving behind for his successor an administrative nightmare. A chronic shortage of river transport meant it was impossible to evacuate large numbers of sick and wounded from either Kut or the relieving force, which suffered hardships owing to a lack of doctors and medical supplies. Despite further attempts during the spring to relieve the town, imminent starvation compelled Townshend to unconditionally surrender Kut on 29 April 1916.<br>
<br>Nixon was summoned to England to appear before the Mesopotamia commission of inquiry appointed in August 1916 to investigate the underlying causes of the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle in Mesopotamia. &#145;The weightiest share of responsibility&#146;, the commission's final report noted, &#145;lies with Sir John Nixon, whose confident optimism was the main cause of the decision to advance&#146;  (&#145;War in Mesopotamia&#146;, 111). The army council also ordered that Nixon submit a written explanation of his conduct during the campaign, depending on which further action might be taken. An announcement was finally made in the House of Commons on 28 October 1918, however, that the army council considered Nixon's description of events satisfactory. In recognition of his services, in 1919 a GCMG was conferred on Nixon, and he was also posthumously made a grand officier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1922. The nine months of command in Mesopotamia were Nixon's last active service. He had married in 1884 Amy Louisa, daughter of James Wilson, of Gratwicke, Billingshurst, and Felpham Manor, Sussex, and they had one son. His health gradually deteriorated and on 15 December 1921 he died at St Raphael, Var, France, survived by his wife.<br>
