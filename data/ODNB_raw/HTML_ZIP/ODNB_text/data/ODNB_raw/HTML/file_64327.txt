<span class="headword">Coan,  John</span>  (1727/8&#150;1764), <span class="occ">sideshow performer</span>, was born at Tivetshall, Norfolk. Although he has been known as the Norfolk Dwarf, both accounts of his development and pictorial representations of him reveal that he was not a dwarf but a midget. Coan appeared to grow normally in his early years but by the time he was exhibited at the Lower Half Moon, Market Place, Norwich, in July 1744, aged sixteen, was &#145;not three foot high&#146;  (<span class="italic">Norwich Mercury</span>) and weighed 27&frac12; lb. By the time he was exhibited in Norfolk in April 1750 he had reached his full height and weight of 3 ft 2 ins. and (with clothes) 34 lbs.<br>
<br>The first evidence of Coan's move to London is his presentation before Frederick, prince of Wales, at a party in Leicester House in January 1751, where he proved a highly popular guest. During this period dwarfs and midgets were very much in vogue with royalty in general and often lived in their patrons' homes. Much of Coan's appeal lay in the combined attraction of his very small but well-proportioned limbs (he was frequently referred to as the Man in Miniature) and his precocious personality. He was not simply a biological curiosity, therefore, but was distinguished from similar performers of the period by a sharp wit, intelligence, and capacity for entertainment through recitation, imitation, and singing.<br>
<br>Coan appeared at a number of London fairs and tavern venues. Thomas Frost describes an early appearance he made, aged twenty-three, at the Swan in Smithfield during the three days of Bartholomew fair in 1751. Although Frost reports that the &#145;principal show seems to have been one containing two dwarfs, a remarkable negro, a female one-horned rhinoceros, and a crocodile&#146;  (Frost, 167), a giant of 7 ft 4 in. named Henry Blacker (<i>b</i>. 1724) from Cuckfield in Sussex was also included in the show. Coan is featured in an engraving by J. Roberts standing next to another giant named Edward Bamfield. Following this he featured much more as an individual performer. Although he was exhibited (for a payment of 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.) as a curiosity to the public at a watchmaker's opposite the Cannon tavern, Charing Cross, Westminster, and for members of the Royal Society, it is clear that his twelve-hour-long daily exhibitions also included much active and interactive participation on his part. He appeared in taverns such as the Ship, the Anchor, and the Windmill near Temple Bar, and played an extravagant host in John Pinchbeck's Dwarf's tavern in Spring Gardens and at the Star and Garter tavern, both in Chelsea Fields, where Coan's humorous entertainments over dinner would be followed by Carlo Genovini's firework displays.<br>
<br>According to Highfill, not only does <span class="italic">Owens' Weekly Chronicle or Universal Museum</span> of 5&#150;12 June 1762 print a prologue which explicitly invokes Coan and which is reported to have been spoken by the actor William Gibson (1713&#150;1771) at a performance of Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">The Orphan</span> at the Haymarket Theatre on 31 May 1762 but, following Coan's death in London on either 24 or 28 March 1764, an effigy of him was displayed at Rackstraw's Museum of Anatomy and Curiosities in Chancery Lane  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>).<br>
