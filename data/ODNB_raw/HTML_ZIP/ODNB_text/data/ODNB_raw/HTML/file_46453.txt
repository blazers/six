<span class="headword">Dickson,  William Kennedy Laurie</span>  (1860&#150;1935), <span class="occ">electrical engineer and film-maker</span>, was born on 3 August 1860 at Ch&acirc;teau St Buc, Le Minihic-sur-Rance, Brittany, France, the second of three children of James Waite Dickson (<i>d</i>. 1870s), an artist, and his second wife, Elizabeth Kennedy-Laurie (1823?&#150;1879). His father had three daughters by his previous marriage. Dickson apparently spent much of his youth in Brittany, except for a short stay in Germany while his older sister, Antonia, a child-prodigy pianist, studied in conservatories in Leipzig and Stuttgart. He may have been able to claim US citizenship since there was an unverified report that his mother was born in Virginia. His multinational background, combined with an education based on the arts and classics and a strong interest in science, provided Dickson with unusual resources for his future career as an inventor and as the producer of some of the first motion pictures exhibited to audiences throughout the world.<br>
<br>In 1879 Dickson, his mother, and two sisters moved from Britain to Virginia in the United States. His mother died very shortly after they arrived. In 1883 he moved to New York city, where he was employed in the testing-room of the Edison Electric Light Co., Thomas Edison's prototype for urban electrification. By 1884 Dickson was designated as Edison's photographer and in 1887, when Edison opened a state-of-the-art laboratory in Orange, New Jersey, he was on the staff as an experimenter and photographer. In 1888 Edison designated Dickson as leading experimenter for the Kinetoscope, &#145;an instrument to do for the Eye what the phonograph does for the Ear&#146;  (Dickson and Dickson, <span class="italic">Century Magazine</span>, May 1894). Simultaneously, Dickson was also a principal experimenter on Edison's favourite project, a costly and ultimately unsuccessful experiment to separate low-grade ores magnetically&#151;a project that took priority over the effort to make images move. Dickson was co-patentee with Edison on the ore separation process.<br>
<br>Experimental work on the Kinetoscope (a peep-show viewing device) and Kinetograph (camera) was completed late in 1893 and the Kinetoscope, showing a small image which ran for about thirty seconds, was introduced on 14 April 1894 and was a short-lived sensation. There were immediate demands for projection but Edison was sceptical about the future of moving pictures and reluctant to develop a &#145;screen machine&#146;. Within two years a number of rival &#145;scope&#146; and &#145;graph&#146; projection machines appeared, stimulated by a worldwide demand for new, novel film subjects. Although many of these machines were directly influenced by the Kinetoscope, the rapid acceptance of projection pushed Edison's innovative peep-show machine aside and Dickson's contribution to the development of the newly popular form of communication was obscured.<br>
<br>Most of the parts used in the Kinetoscope had been used in earlier inventions. Edison's and Dickson's achievement was the innovative assembly of these components and Edison, whose name alone was marketable, was the first successfully to commercialize a cinema device. Although he had solved a number of design problems, Dickson's most tangible and enduring contribution was the creation of the standard film gauge known today as 35 mm film. At the end of 1891 he increased the size of his image to a width of one inch and placed four rectangular sprocket holes, slightly rounded at the corners, on either side of the image or frame. His film was designed to record a sequence of successive images on a single strip which moved perpendicularly through the camera and the viewing device. Following the introduction of the Kinetoscope, Robert Paul, Birt Acres, C. Francis Jenkins, and Thomas Armat each produced machines designed to use &#145;Edison standard film&#146; and the format gained immediate international acceptance. Although the size of the sprocket holes and the frame ratio have altered slightly, the film used today is essentially identical with the film Dickson began using in 1892. Dickson's 35 mm &#145;standard&#146; was the common substructure that made it possible for films to be produced and shown throughout the world&#151;the common denominator that sustained the rapid spread of one of the earliest, most pervasive, and most popular forms of international communication.<br>
<br>Dickson also pioneered the production of movies and during his career, from 1891 through to 1903, he produced more than 500 films. In 1893 he designed the first operational motion picture studio, Edison's &#145;Black Maria&#146;, and a laboratory to develop and copy the films shot in the studio. He trained camera operators and initiated the first regular production of motion pictures. During 1894 and 1895 he produced about 125 films which were exhibited before any competing films were produced. He is one of the few film-makers who also designed cameras, production facilities, and viewing machines.<br>
<br>In April 1895 Dickson resigned from Edison's laboratory. Edison's manager, William Gilmore, learned that Dickson was visiting the Lathams, who were making a rival camera and projector, and he accused Dickson of disloyalty. The exact nature of Dickson's relations with the Lathams was, and still is, controversial. Some historians assumed that Dickson designed the Lathams' Eidoloscope, but the Lathams denied this and Dickson never claimed that he invented their machines, even though he considered joining their company. Instead, Dickson and three long-time friends&#151;Elias B. Koopman, Henry Marvin, and Herman Casler&#151;formed the KMCD syndicate to market the Mutoscope, a flip-card peep-show machine built by Casler with unspecified help from Dickson. At the beginning of 1896, after making a camera and projector, the syndicate established the American Mutoscope Company (later the American Mutoscope and Biograph Co., then Biograph Co.), a well-financed challenge to Edison's domination of the American motion picture business. After designing some equipment for the company, Dickson organized film production. He designed a roof-top studio in New York city, a laboratory to develop and print film, and he trained several projectionists and camera operators, among them G. W. &#145;Billy&#146; Bitzer, later famous as D. W. Griffith's cameraman. Regular production began in the summer of 1896 and the Biograph projector, showing film about the size of today's Imax, premi&egrave;red in New York in October 1896.<br>
<br>In May 1897, after the American operation was established, Dickson and Koopman moved to London to create a multinational production&#150;exhibition company. A semi-autonomous British company was established, distribution offices for Belgium, Italy, South Africa, and India were set up, and production branches were created in France, the Netherlands, and Germany. Once again Dickson designed studios and technical facilities, and trained camera operators. He travelled throughout England and Europe making films that were popular features on the programmes of the most important variety theatres in several countries. During the last years of the Victorian era the Biograph was a prominent and regular feature on the programs of Keith's Union Square in New York, the Palace in London, the <i>Folies Berg&egrave;re</i> in Paris, and the Winter Garden in Berlin.<br>
<br>Although often thought of as a cameraman, Dickson actually functioned as a producer&#150;director and rarely operated the bulky Biograph camera. He chose subjects, negotiated the arrangements for filming, planned and timed the shots, and supervised the set-up of the camera. His films were carefully composed, with the subjects clearly defined in the frame. Since most of the films were less than one minute long, the camera was placed to make maximum use of the short lengths of film, and subjects were chosen to appeal to the varied tastes of a multinational audience. He developed or improved a number of film genres which sustained the popularity of the Biograph: &#145;phantom&#146; train rides, spectacular military manoeuvres, and vividly pictured scenes of newsworthy current events and prominent world figures. Several topical films, including one of the return of the sirdar from the Sudan, were premi&egrave;red on the day they were filmed. In May and June 1898, after several weeks of negotiations, Dickson made news by filming Pope Leo XIII, one of the most sensational and longest-running spectacles of the early cinema. His pioneering films of troop movements and some actual combat during the South African War were a remarkable accomplishment, considering that the immense Biograph camera weighed more than 1000 lb. On his return to Britain he published his diary notes of the campaign as <span class="italic">The Biograph in Battle: its Story in the South African War Related with Personal Experiences</span> (1901).<br>
<br>While Dickson was still experimenting on the Kinetoscope, he began selling still photographs made from his films to newspapers and the illustrated press, a practice he continued throughout his career. These photographs were used both as publicity for the films and as illustrations for newsworthy stories. Beginning in 1892, and with Edison's permission, Dickson's photographs of Edison, the laboratory, and projects at the laboratory were offered for sale by <span class="italic">The Phonogram</span> magazine and he continued the practice when he began producing films. The half-tone process that made the publication of photographs possible was a recent development, and Dickson's practice created an early link between motion pictures and the emerging illustrated press at a time when the public was still curious about distant lands and anxious to learn what public figures really looked like. It also established precedence for publicity photographs of film productions.<br>
<br>In 1893, independent of his work for Edison, Dickson and his friend Herman Casler designed the Photoret, a &#145;detective&#146; camera the size and shape of a pocket watch. It was one of the smallest cameras ever made and it attracted international attention. Dickson also patented a lamp for bicycles and another for use by miners. He had brown, wavy hair and frequently had a moustache and/or a short goatee beard. Slender until late in life, he was a stylish dresser. He was a skilled rifle marksman, a talented amateur musician, and was made a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society for the discovery of three caves in Virginia. Although he had no professional degree, he was made an associate of the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1909 and an honorary member of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers in 1933. Dickson was twice married. He married Lucie Agnes, daughter of Allen L. Archer, of Petersburg, Virginia, on 21 April 1886. She died early in 1908. There were no children. He secondly married Margaret Helen Gordon (<i>d</i>. 1938), daughter of James Urquhart Mosse, in 1913. It was her second marriage, and they had one son.<br>
<br>In addition to his remembrances of the South African War, Dickson and his sister Antonia Dickson wrote a series of articles, <span class="italic">The Life and Inventions of Thomas A. Edison</span>, which appeared in <span class="italic">Cassier's Magazine</span> (November 1892&#150;December 1893). These articles, supplemented by two articles they wrote about the Kinetoscope, were compiled in book form as <span class="italic">The Life and Inventions of Thomas A. Edison</span> (1894). The Kinetoscope articles were also adapted by the two Dicksons as <span class="italic">History of the Kinetograph, Kinetoscope and Kineto-Phonograph</span> (1895), a publicity brochure distributed to Kinetoscope dealers by Raff and Gammon's Kinetoscope Co. All of these publications had photographs taken by Dickson as well as some original decoration created by him. In 1933, at the request of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers, he described his experiences in an article for their journal: <span class="italic">A Brief History of the Kinetograph, the Kinetoscope and the Kineto-Phonograph</span>.<br>
<br>Shortly after returning from South Africa Dickson retired from motion picture work and opened a testing and experimental laboratory and machine works at 64 Strand, London. Modelled on Edison's laboratory, but on a more modest scale, Dickson worked on a variety of projects, a number of them related to the amusement industry. Among these were an automatic piano, an amusement park ride, and a portable dining facility for carnivals. He was joined in the laboratory by his friend Eugene Lauste, whose pioneering experiments to record sound on film were begun in Dickson's laboratory. Dickson operated this laboratory until about 1920, when he retired. During his retirement Dickson lived in Richmond upon Thames, Twickenham, and Jersey. He died of carcinoma of the prostate at Montpelier House, 29 Montpelier Row, Twickenham, on 28 September 1935, and was buried in Twickenham cemetery on 2 October.<br>
