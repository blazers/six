<span class="headword">Littleton,  Adam</span>  (1627&#150;1694), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and philologist</span>, was born on 2 November 1627 at Halesowen, which was then in Shropshire, the sixth son of Thomas Littleton, the vicar there. He claimed to descend from the ancient Littleton/Westcote family of Worcestershire, which included the fifteenth-century jurist Sir Thomas Littleton. Having been educated under Richard Busby at Westminster School, in 1644 he was admitted to Christ Church, Oxford. By 1647 he was a stipendiary student at Christ Church, but he was ejected in 1648 by parliamentary visitors. He might have written the single sheet <span class="italic">Tragi-Comoedia Oxoniensis, a Latin Poem on the Mad Proceedings of the Parliamentary Visitors</span> (1648), but this is doubtful.<br>
<br>Soon afterwards Littleton became usher under Busby at Westminster School, where he was later (1658) appointed second master; he also taught at other places. His fame as a grammarian dates from this time. He wrote <span class="italic">Pasor metricus, sive, Voces</span> (a Greek and Latin grammar printed in 1658 with <span class="italic">Diatriba in octo tractatus distributa</span>) and <span class="italic">Elementa religionis, sive, Quatuor capita catechetica totiden linguis descripter, in usum scholarum</span> (supposedly printed in 1658 with <span class="italic">Complicatio radicum in primaev&ocirc; Hebraeorum lingu&acirc;</span>). By 1657, when his first child was born, he had married his first wife, Elizabeth, but having given birth to a second child in 1659, she died that year and was buried in St Paul's, Covent Garden.<br>
<br>During the 1660s Littleton was appointed a chaplain in ordinary to Charles II, who at some point also granted him the reversion of Busby's post, although the ageing master in the event outlived him. In 1662 he published <span class="italic">Solomon's Gate, or, An Entrance into the Church</span>, ostensibly commemorating the north gate of Westminster Abbey, but, in fact, a sort of catechism &#145;of the grounds of religion conteined in &hellip; the Lord's prayer, the Apostles creed, the <span class="roman">Ten commandments</span>, the sacraments&#146;. On 24 January 1667 Littleton married his second wife, Susan Rich of West Ham, Essex. Two years later Littleton obtained the rectory of St Luke's in Chelsea, where he may already have done some teaching, and also in 1669 delivered the funeral sermon for Lady Jane Cheyne, wife of Charles Cheyne, later Viscount Newhaven, also of Chelsea and perhaps his patron. The same year he became a prebend at Westminster and some time later was subdean. On 12 July 1670 he received a DD, &#145;without taking any in arts, on account of his extraordinary merit&#146;, because letters from Humfrey Henchman, bishop of London, recommended him for his humanity, manners, genius, &#145;and ready faculty in preaching&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 2.58&#150;60n.). Increasingly this talent was exhibited in occasional sermons at, among other places, Guildhall, Westminster, and Whitehall, before the royal family; he may have been chaplain to the prince Palatine. Many of his sermons were published in three large folio volumes, entitled <span class="italic">Sixty One Sermons Preached Mostly upon Publick Occasions</span> (1680). They emphasized the ceremonies and uniqueness of Anglicanism, &#145;having stood intirely (<i>sic</i>) upon her own Bottom&#146;  (2.sig. B[3]), and being neither Calvinist nor Lutheran. He repeatedly attacked &#145;the foolish and outragious zeal and odd practises of our fanatick brethren&#146;  (1.172) and reminded dissenters of their obligation to authority. Indeed, loyalty and a distrust of nonconformity were his watchwords. Even during the Popish Plot scare, when he delivered <span class="italic">A sermon at a solemn meeting of the natives of the city and county of Worcester, in the church of St Mary le Bow</span> (1680), he hoped &#145;that neither Popery nor Schism may ever prevail over&#146; us and recommended charity for &#145;the old Cavaliers&#146;, who &#145;have since the Kings happy Restauration been too too much neglected&#146;  (p. 34).<br>
<br>Alongside his active preaching schedule, Littleton maintained his philological research and in 1678 published <span class="italic">Linguae Latinae liber dictionarius quadripartitus</span>, a huge Latin dictionary, which was published at least four times by his death, and several more times in the eighteenth century before it was superseded by later dictionaries. He was working on a Greek lexicon at the end of his life and read and annotated pieces in Hebrew, Chaldee, and Arabic. His skill in languages allowed him to publish an edition of Cicero in 1681 and translate from Greek a life of Themistocles, which appeared in an edition of Plutarch's <span class="italic">Lives</span> (1683). The same year, adopting the pen-name Redman Westcote in evocation of his Worcestershire ancestors, he published as <span class="italic">Tracts Written by John Selden</span> a translation of the latter's <span class="italic">Jani Anglorum facies altera</span>. He also composed some commendatory verses to his friend, Baldwin Hamey, which he published appended to Hamey's posthumous <span class="italic">Dissertatio epistolaris de juramento medicorum</span> (1693) (Greek and Latin texts of the Hippocratic oath), and several other pieces. He purchased so many books and manuscripts from Europe, Asia, and Africa that he might have exhausted his income, because his successor at Chelsea, John King, claimed he died insolvent and left his widow, his third wife, the daughter of Richard Guildford of Chelsea, in distressed circumstances even though she had brought her husband some wealth. Neither the Greek lexicon nor his pieces on &#145;mystical numeration&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 2.60n.) survive.<br>
<br>Littleton retained the Chelsea living to the end of his life. He may also have held the rectory of Overton, Hampshire, from 1683, and he was minister of St Botolph, Aldersgate, London, from about 1685 until about 1691, when he resigned, perhaps because of ill health. He died at Chelsea on 30 June 1694 at the age of sixty-seven and was buried at St Luke's, Chelsea, where a tablet to his memory was placed. A catalogue of his library, <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Littletoniana</span> was printed the next year and his books dispersed. His widow died in 1698 and was buried at Chelsea on 14 November.<br>
