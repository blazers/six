<div class="para">
<span class="headword">James,  Cyril Lionel Robert</span>  (1901&#150;1989), <span class="occ">historian and writer</span>, was born on 4 January 1901 in the village of Caroni, Trinidad, the eldest of three children of Robert Alexander James and his wife, Ida Elizabeth (Bessie) Rudder. His paternal grandfather and both maternal grandparents had been migrants from Barbados. His father was a schoolmaster and later headmaster; his mother's love of English literature was a crucial formative influence on James: Shakespeare, Dickens, and the possibly more surprising figure of Thackeray remained aesthetic touchstones throughout his life. Known to friends as Nello, in print, when not using pseudonyms, he was always C. L. R.<br>
<br>The family moved during James's childhood to the larger settlement of Tunapuna&#151;home also to his friend <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57269/', "Malcolm Nurse (1902&#150;1959)")</script>, subsequently a noted writer and politician under the name George Padmore&#151;and his early education was in his father's own schoolrooms. His was by local standards a comparatively prosperous&#151;indeed, under the influence of the sternly aspiring Robert James, a rigidly conventional&#151;upbringing. But it was also a childhood in a colonial society where slavery remained a living memory, and where people of the James family's colour could achieve even their modestly middle-class status only by exceptional ability and hard work. James certainly had ability, but his application to schoolwork was more questionable: to his father's distress, he increasingly preferred reading and writing fiction, or watching and playing cricket, to his studies. In 1910 he won a scholarship to Queen's Royal College, the island's most prestigious school; but early top grades were not sustained as the teenage James carved his own idiosyncratic path. He knew he did not want to be a teacher or civil servant, or to apply to Oxford or Cambridge, as his father intended, but to be a writer. On graduating from Queen's Royal College, although he found employment as a schoolmaster and private tutor, this was merely a means of paying the rent while he pursued his real interests.<br>
<br>James entered the literary circles centred on pioneer Trinidadian authors Albert Gomes and Alfred Mendes, and first achieved public notice with a short story, &#145;La divina pastora&#146;, published in 1927. Other short stories, essays, and then a novel, <span class="italic">Minty Alley</span> (written in the summer of 1928, but not published until 1936) followed. His fiction reflected fascination with the world his family spurned, that of the Trinidadian poor and their &#145;barrack-yard&#146; homes. This was linked, too, with a slowly awakening political consciousness. James became sympathetic to the Trinidad Workingmen's Association and its charismatic leader, Captain A. A. Cipriani: a biography of Cipriani was to be his first published book (1932). From 1927 he was briefly, and unhappily, married to Juanita Samuel Young.<br>
<br>Despite his modest literary success James found colonial Trinidad an increasingly restricting environment. In 1932 came his chance to break from it. He had become friendly with local cricketing hero Learie Constantine, who had moved to England to play professionally in the Lancashire league. Constantine, needing a collaborator for his autobiography <span class="italic">Cricket and I</span> (1933), invited James to join him there. The solidly working-class Lancashire mill town of Nelson, where the Constantine family lived, seemed an improbable new location for the aspiring Caribbean intellectual. Yet it prompted the next great turn in James's career. Through Constantine, whose broad interests included left-wing politics, James made the acquaintance of local socialist and trade union activists. And from this there rapidly grew an enthusiasm for Marxist, then specifically for Trotskyist, political theory and activity.<br>
<br>James moved to London at the start of 1934 and, while scraping a living as a cricket correspondent for the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> and other papers, plunged into political action. He joined both the Independent Labour Party (and, soon, the Trotskyist faction that operated within it) and the small group of West Indian and African &eacute;migr&eacute;s who were agitating from London for colonial independence. To his surprise he discovered that a key member of the latter circle, the pseudonymous George Padmore, was in fact his cousin Malcolm. James also began research in London and Paris for what was to be his most famous book, <span class="italic">The Black Jacobins</span>, a study of the Haitian revolution, published in 1938. It was not only a major history of those events, but in effect a political manifesto for forthcoming anti-colonial revolt and for Pan-Africanism. This was only the highest peak in James's substantial range of literary activity during the later 1930s: he also published his novel <span class="italic">Minty Alley</span> (1936), a polemical history of the Communist International, <span class="italic">World Revolution</span> (1937), a short but pioneering <span class="italic">History of Negro Revolt</span> (1938), a translation of Boris Souvarine's <span class="italic">Stalin</span> (1939), numerous political articles, and of course cricket journalism, while his Haitian work additionally produced a play, <span class="italic">Toussaint l'Ouverture</span>, performed at the Westminster Theatre in 1936, with Paul Robeson in the title role.<br>
<br>In 1938 James was a delegate to the founding conference of Trotsky's Fourth International in Paris, and then travelled to the United States: partly, it seems, on Trotsky's urging, partly driven by his own restlessness and curiosity. He intended to return to England in time for the 1939 cricket season; but the outbreak of war in Europe extended an American sojourn that was eventually to last fifteen years. For much of that period, he was a full-time political activist: first, for the main US Trotskyist group, the Socialist Workers' Party; then, after seceding from it, working with an even smaller group of like-minded friends in what was labelled the &#145;Johnson&#150;Forest tendency&#146;, &#145;Johnson&#146; was James's own &#145;party name&#146;, &#145;Freddie Forest&#146; that of Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; Raya Dunayevskaya. James wrote a mass of political material during these years, both alone and in collaboration with Dunayevskaya and their colleague Grace Lee. Little of this writing has retained lasting interest except among devotees of the minutiae of ultra-left politics; but it included James's <span class="italic">Notes on Dialectics</span> (1948), an innovative work of Marxist philosophy. Still, James's capacious interests could not be confined in a single political mould: his American years also produced <span class="italic">Mariners, Renegades and Castaways</span> (1953), a study of Herman Melville, and the remarkable <span class="italic">American Civilization</span>. The latter, mainly drafted in 1949&#150;50 but never fully completed and published only posthumously in 1992, was far ahead of its time in many ways; not least in its close analysis of &#145;popular culture&#146;&#151;cinema, comic-books, radio serials, mass-market fiction&#151;as a key to understanding a society.<br>
<br>These were also crucial but turbulent years in James's personal life. In 1939 in Los Angeles he met and fell in love with the eighteen-year-old Constance Webb. It seemed a hopeless infatuation: not only did Constance initially not return his love, she was twenty years his junior, already married, and (still a significant, even dangerous, fact in the USA of the 1940s) she was white, he black. Gradually his affections came to be reciprocated, and he and Constance were married in May 1946. Their son, also C. L. R. James, known as Nobbie, was born in April 1949. Yet theirs remained a stormy relationship, which finally broke down in 1950&#150;51, to James's lasting regret. Although in later life he was married a third time, to Selma Weinstein, there is no doubt that the relationship with Constance was the most important of his life. His many and long letters to her, posthumously published as <span class="italic">Special Delivery</span> (1996), are deeply poignant documents, as well as providing the most intimate available insight into the workings of James's mind.<br>
<br>In 1952, at the height of the USA's early cold war &#145;red scare&#146;, James was arrested for supposed passport violations, and interned on Ellis Island. The final draft of <span class="italic">Mariners, Renegades and Castaways</span> was written there, in prison, and included a desperate plea against the injustice of his position. Feeling squeezed between US authorities who called him a communist and communists who thought him a heretic, finally despairing of being able to regularize his resident status in the United States, he headed back to England in the autumn of 1953.<br>
<br>London was to remain James's usual home for the last thirty years of his life, although until the 1980s he travelled more widely than ever before. He was able to revisit the USA many times, lecturing and holding visiting professorships at various American universities. He was a welcome guest in Ghana, whose first post-independence leader Kwame Nkrumah had been a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of his&#151;until he expressed publicly his growing disillusion with Nkrumah's authoritarianism. His <span class="italic">Nkrumah and the Ghana Revolution</span> (1977) traces the enthusiasm, the doubts, the disenchantment, and eventual denunciation&#151;though even at the last James insisted on the political horizons that Nkrumah's project <i>could</i> have opened up. In 1958 he relocated to Trinidad, on the invitation of Prime Minister Eric Williams, who had been James's school pupil thirty years before. Williams made him editor of his party's newspaper, <span class="italic">The Nation</span>, but strains grew between James's radicalism and Williams's more conservative direction. The crisis came over Williams's decision to allow the US Navy to retain a base at Chaguaramas on the island; something James bitterly opposed. He resigned from <span class="italic">The Nation</span> in March 1960 and was expelled from the party in October, but remained in Trinidad for some time, writing and lecturing. From this period date his books <span class="italic">Modern Politics</span> (1960), <span class="italic">Party Politics in the West Indies</span> (1962), and perhaps the most important of his later works, <span class="italic">Beyond a Boundary</span> (1963), a meditation on the cultural and social meanings of cricket which also included substantial autobiographical elements.<br>
<br>James returned again to England in 1962 but continued to range widely from there, lecturing in Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda, Cuba, and Canada as well as the USA, covering the 1965 England cricket tour of the West Indies for the London <span class="italic">Observer</span> and <span class="italic">Times</span> (arriving in Trinidad to watch the test match there, he was promptly placed under house arrest by Eric Williams), and helping initiate the Sixth Pan-African Congress in 1974. He also continued to write extensively on politics, history, literature, and sport, but no substantial new books appeared after the mid-1960s. The major publications of his last years, notably three volumes of essays, <span class="italic">The Future in the Present</span> (1977), <span class="italic">Spheres of Existence</span> (1980), and <span class="italic">At the Rendezvous of Victory</span> (1984), mostly collected earlier work.<br>
<br>In 1981 James finally settled back in London, living in a tiny book-filled apartment at 165 Railton Road, Brixton, above the offices of the magazine <span class="italic">Race Today</span>, which was run by friends and admirers of his. They cooked and cared for an increasingly frail but still mentally vigorous man who, unable now to travel, instead received a stream of visitors from throughout the world in his bedroom. He continued to watch that world with a keen eye, welcoming with equal enthusiasm the Polish workers' 1980s uprising against communism, the emergence of a new generation of black women writers, and the West Indies' cricketing successes. He died at home of a chest infection, after a short illness, on 31 May 1989. His remains were returned to Trinidad and buried there, in his childhood hometown of Tunapuna.<br>
<br>Very few figures in twentieth-century Caribbean, or British, life and letters have matched the sheer range of James's interests and activities. Revolutionary and aesthete, novelist, historian, literary critic, philosopher, political analyst, and in many eyes the foremost of all writers on cricket, he seemed somehow to bring a unified, intensely personal sensibility to all these spheres. Even if many of his numerous projects never came to full fruition&#151;the unfinished book <span class="italic">American Civilization</span>, and the autobiography he long planned but never really began, would surely have been his twin masterpieces&#151;he still left a literary and political legacy of remarkable power and continuing influence.<br>
