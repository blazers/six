<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bowyer,  William</span>  (1699&#150;1777), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was born on 19 December 1699 at Dogwell Court, Whitefriars, London, the only son to survive infancy of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3092/', "William Bowyer (1663&#150;1737)")</script>, printer, and his second wife, Dorothy Allport (1665&#150;1727), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7341/', "Thomas Dawks (1636&#150;1689)")</script> of London, printer [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7340/', "Dawks, Thomas (bap. 1611, d. 1670)")</script>], and his wife, Anne. Young William attended a private school at Headley, Surrey, kept by Ambrose Bonwicke. Then, most unusually, his father sent him to university. In June 1716 William was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, as a sizar under Robert Jenkin. There he remained until June 1722, mastering Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. At home, at school, and at university he was much among nonjurors and their sympathizers, which is perhaps why he did not take a degree.<br>
<br>The intention was to place a learned corrector at the heart of the firm, the better to serve the new English scholarship. The success of this plan may be seen in the list of works printed by the Bowyers between 1699 and 1777 given in the Maslen&#150;Lancaster edition of the Bowyer printing ledgers (1991). The two functions of scholar and printer were at best complementary. Often Bowyer acted as a patron of scholarship by encouraging authors to publish on their own account, at times going beyond what was commercially prudent by himself sharing or bearing the financial risk, as when in 1766 he published his friend Samuel Pegge's <span class="italic">Essay on the Coins of Cunobelin</span>. However, sometimes there were tensions, expressed by Bowyer himself in a letter of 11 January 1767: &#145;My father, good man, sent me thither [to Cambridge] to qualify me (by a new kind of experiment) for a printer. But it served only in trade to expose me to more affronts, and to give me a keener sensibility of them&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 3.13).<br>
<br>In June 1722 young William entered the firm and took over the correcting of proofs; not that he did all himself, for father and son both employed a succession of nonjuring (and hence unbeneficed) clergymen to help with this work. How the complex task of correction was allotted can usually only be guessed. Nichols draws attention to Bowyer's correcting of Selden's <span class="italic">Opera omnia</span> (1726). Letters between author and printer, some acrimonious, also tell a tale. Unsent letters of 1757 to William Warburton protest vigorously that the bishop unfairly blamed Bowyer for not correcting the author's own mistakes. Nichols notes Bowyer's freedom in correcting the press, citing his letter to Antony Alsop, author of <span class="italic">Odarum libri duo</span> (1752): &#145;in the last sheet I made it <i>obstrepat</i> against your authority, and will give you leave to advertise me if it is wrong&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 2.234&#150;5n).<br>
<br>On 9 October 1728 at St Clement Danes, Strand, London, William married his mother's niece Ann Prudom (<i>c</i>.1705&#150;1731), by whom he gained farms in Danby Dale, Yorkshire, and at Navestock, Essex. Their second and only surviving son, Thomas, was born on 5 September 1730. Ann died in childbirth on 17 October 1731.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Bowyer was venturing in new directions. In 1729, through the friendship of Arthur Onslow, speaker of the House of Commons, he was appointed to print the votes of the House, a profitable employment which remained in the firm until 1940.<br>
<br>The acquisition of copyrights was another line which became increasingly important. At first Bowyer was careful not to be seen to compete with the booksellers, but later his standing in the trade placed him above such question. In any case, for Bowyer owning copy was primarily useful in conferring the right to print. In 1729 Bowyer began to collect copyrights of pieces by Jonathan Swift and his countrymen. George Faulkner, the notable Dublin printer, who had worked not long before as a journeyman for the Bowyers, initiated the lifelong habit of sending Bowyer printed copies of works first published in Dublin, English copyright going to whoever first printed an English edition. Bowyer did as much for Faulkner. Between May 1729 and February 1733 Bowyer thus reprinted a number of pieces of Swiftiana, including, for instance, <span class="italic">A vindication of his excellency the lord C&#151;t, from the charge of favouring none but tories, high-churchmen and Jacobites</span>. To confirm possession Bowyer secured through the Revd Matthew Pilkington a form of assignment from Swift himself. When Pope protested, meaning to reprint some of these pieces himself, Bowyer insisted on his rights. In later years Bowyer's share of Swift copyrights gave him a valuable stake in the ever expanding editions of Swift's <span class="italic">Works</span>.<br>
<br>After his father's death on 27 December 1737 Bowyer was on his own. He took charge of the all-important accounts, which William senior had kept almost to the last, and a decline in the standard of bookkeeping soon begins to appear. One more step was necessary. On 4 July 1738 Bowyer was made free of the Stationers' Company by patrimony, and almost immediately called to the livery. Thereafter, being retiring by nature, he refused higher office in the company as he became eligible, and paid the usual fines. On 5 May 1741 he bound the first of seventeen apprentices. Some time in the early 1740s he also took stock of his printing materials and equipment by means of a linked inventory and type specimen, which he occasionally updated. These show his care to renew his text types, for instance by buying regularly from Caslon. Also revealing is his ownership of exotics: Hebrew, Greek (in no fewer than fourteen faces and sizes), Anglo-Saxon, Gothic, and Coptic.<br>
<br>However, output steadily if not alarmingly declined. Complaints by Bowyer about being given only part of a work to print belong to these years. Nevertheless, his learned printing grew in prominence. Bowyer was appointed printer to the Society of Antiquaries in May 1736, and on 7 July was elected to membership. Between 1738 and 1748 he was one of three printers employed by the short-lived Society for the Encouragement of Learning, printing works by Thomas Tanner and others, which brought prestige if not profit.<br>
<br>On 21 August 1747 Bowyer married Elizabeth Bill (<i>c</i>.1700&#150;1771), a widow who had long been his housekeeper. She read proofs for him. Less helpfully she favoured William Emonson, son of and apprentice to Bowyer's overseer James Emonson, against her stepson Thomas Bowyer, who had been apprenticed to his father on 5 August 1746. Disappointing his father's hopes, Thomas left home before completing his time, and after other false starts eventually retired to the country under the name Mr Thomas, and died on 17 December 1783.<br>
<br>On 10 October 1754, being &#145;sick of the World&#146; and hoping to lessen &#145;the fatigues of Business&#146;, Bowyer entered into a partnership with James Emonson  (Emonson Partnership MSS). Bowyer soon changed his mind, instancing the bookseller John Knapton's bankruptcy in September 1755 following his partner's death. Emonson cited Bowyer's unfairness in refusing to print the second part of Warburton's <span class="italic">Divine Legation of Moses</span>, while promising to proof-read it. The causes were deeper. Bowyer found he was not ready to retire or accept a likely change to the character of his press. Emonson moved on to print a newspaper, <span class="italic">Lloyd's Evening Post</span>. The partnership legally ended on 4 July 1757.<br>
<br>The nonjuring loyalties of Bowyer's father were transformed into a banking service offered by the son to a dozen or so country clergymen, one-time members and fellows of Bowyer's own college of St John's.<br>
<br>Early in 1757 Bowyer took yet another boy for training. John Nichols, not yet thirteen, quickly proved himself to be the helper Bowyer had long desired. Nichols was formally apprenticed on 6 February 1759. On 4 July 1761 Bowyer successfully applied to the earl of Macclesfield, the president of the Royal Society, to follow Samuel Richardson as the society's printer, first completing vol. 52, part 1 of the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>. A later initiative was unsuccessful. During 1765 Bowyer treated with Cambridge University for a lease of its printing privileges. Nichols was freed on 4 March 1766, and made a junior partner on 5 April, with a one-third share in the business. Bowyer cautiously imposed strict conditions. Among Nichols's many duties were keeping most of the accounts and binding the apprentices. Once again, Bowyer was not to be compelled to read proofs.<br>
<br>The year 1767 brought three &#145;revolutions&#146; in Bowyer's affairs. He complained to his son in a letter of 13 May that Nichols had deceived him by secretly marrying  (Nichols MSS). Also, the &#145;Printing house in White Fryers being propt up &amp; like to fall&#146;, he had taken a new one in Red Lion Passage, with access to Fleet Street. There the printing house remained until it too was destroyed by fire, on 8 February 1808. Finally, he had just been appointed printer of the retrospective series of <span class="italic">Journals of the House of Lords</span>, to be completed in 31 volumes, 1768&#150;77. Nichols was essential to this undertaking, and Bowyer had to overlook his behaviour.<br>
<br>By this time Bowyer's health, long troublesome, was giving way; Elizabeth Bowyer had died on 14 January 1771. On 15 May 1773 Nichols, already effectively in control, was made an equal partner. It was he who superintended the slow passage through the press of <span class="italic">Domesday Book</span> (1783), using the record type cut to order by Joseph Jackson.<br>
<br>Bowyer's duties as corrector often led him to indulge in the more congenial scholarly tasks of annotating, commenting, emending, epitomizing, indexing, and translating. These works are listed in the index to the <span class="italic">Bowyer Ledgers</span> (1991), and a selection of such minor pieces was published by Nichols in 1785 as <span class="italic">Miscellaneous tracts, by the late William Bowyer, printer, F.S.A. and several of his learned friends</span>. Correspondence between Bowyer and these friends, notably Jeremiah Markland and William Clarke (printed in Nichols's <span class="italic">Literary Anecdotes</span>), was predominantly antiquarian and textual. Roman and English coinage was a favourite topic of inquiry. Bowyer himself was most proud of his <span class="italic">Conjectures on the New Testament, Collected from Various Authors</span> (1772). This work attracted some later attention.<br>
<br>Bowyer died in London on 18 November 1777, and was buried at Low Leyton, Essex. In his will, having handsomely provided for his errant son, and remembered those who had helped his father after the destructive fire of 30 January 1713, he gave charitable bequests to the Stationers' Company to benefit elderly printers, and also a journeyman compositor aged at least thirty-one &#145;who shall be able to read and construe Latin, and at least to read Greek fluently with accents&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 3.270&#150;89). To John Nichols, his residual legatee, he gave &#145;all the Books that relate to Cicero, Livy, and the Roman History &hellip; my Grammars and Dictionaries, with Swift's and Pope's Works&#146;, also his &#145;Old Bureau &hellip; to survey and preserve my Papers in&#146;  (ibid.). These materials together with the old printing house books of account formed the nucleus of Nichols's <span class="italic">Literary Anecdotes</span>.<br>
<br>William Bowyer was surely, as Nichols claimed, &#145;the most learned [English] Printer of the Eighteenth Century&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 1.2). His printing house is also the best documented. His successor's care to preserve the Bowyer business records for posterity allowed the operations of a major London printing house of the hand-press era to be understood in their fullness. Bowyer was a printer not only of works of learning of every sort (including medical and scientific), but of works of imaginative literature from Pope, Swift, and Voltaire to the soon forgotten publications of Grub Street hacks, and parliamentary papers. Interspersed with these were ephemeral pieces of every description. His achievement, like his father's, was to be not only distinctive, but representative of the vigour and service to society of the best of his trade. Bowyer well understood that scholarly printing, however highly valued, was something of a luxury, needing to be subsidized by more commercial work. His devotion to printing the works of the learned stands out as all the more laudable.<br>
