<span class="headword">Robinson,  Joseph Armitage</span>  (1858&#150;1933), <span class="occ">dean of Westminster and Wells</span>, was born in the vicarage of Keynsham, near Bath, on 9 January 1858, the third son among thirteen children of George Robinson of Monagham, Ireland, vicar in turn of the poor parishes of Keynsham and St Augustine's, Everton, and his wife, Henrietta Cecilia, daughter of Arthur Forbes of Craig-a-ved, co. Down. He was educated at the Crypt Grammar School, Gloucester, at Liverpool College under George Butler (<i>c</i>.1872), and, like three of his brothers, at Christ's College, Cambridge, of which he was scholar (1877), fourth classic and second chancellor's medallist (1881), fellow (1881&#150;99), and honorary fellow (1905). After ordination (1881, 1882) he was during 1883&#150;4 domestic chaplain to J. B. Lightfoot, a powerful bishop and probably the leading patristics scholar in Europe. Lightfoot gathered round his home at Auckland Castle six or eight ordinands for instruction in pastoral matters and direction in theological study. Later at Westminster Abbey Robinson adapted this custom, but enlarged the range to include promising pupils in history and science. On returning to Cambridge he engaged in teaching and research, varied by a curacy at St Mary the Great (1885&#150;8) and the vicarage of All Saints (1888&#150;92).<br>
<br>On the way to Patmos in 1887 Robinson met at Athens S. P. Lambros, who, in discussing a famous forgery by Constantine Simonides, showed him an essay he had written and a fresh collection he had made of the Athos manuscript of the <span class="italic">Shepherd of Hermas</span>. For these Robinson secured publication by the Cambridge University Press, with an English translation and valuable prefaces and appendices of his own. In 1890 he discovered in MS Brit. Mus. 11884 the original Latin of the <span class="roman">Acts of the Scillitan martyrs</span>, and shortly after in Vienna he detected the Buddhist romance of Barlaam and Joasaph (or Josaphat), and the original Greek of the <span class="italic">Apology</span> of Aristides, of which a text and translation from a Syriac version found by James Rendel Harris at Mount Sinai were passing through the press. The result appeared in 1891 as the first of a new series of Cambridge <span class="roman">Texts and Studies</span> under Robinson's editorship, with an elaborate appendix by himself, which helped &#145;to open a new field before the students of Christian Apologetics&#146;. In 1891 the series was continued with freshly edited text of St Perpetua, &#145;the most beautiful of all the records of Christian martyrdom&#146; and of the Scillitan martyrs, and in 1893, separately, of Origen's <span class="italic">Philocalia</span>. His high position in international scholarship was marked by the honorary degree of PhD from G&ouml;ttingen University (1893) and by Halle University's conferral of the degree of DTheol (1894). He was elected to be Norrisian professor of divinity at Cambridge in 1893. From 1894 to 1899 he held the prebend of Compton Bishop in Wells Cathedral. In 1895 he published <span class="italic">Euthaliana</span> (<span class="roman">Texts and Studies</span>, 3/3), a work which required great editorial skill and proved his mastery of Armenian. In 1920 he produced his translation of the Armenian version of St Irenaeus's <span class="italic">Demonstration of the Apostolic Preaching</span> and his most useful introduction to this &#145;handbook of Christian evidence &hellip; as it presented itself to a master-mind at the end of the second century&#146;.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Robinson's reputation had been growing as a scholar who was also a preacher; and his appointment to the rectory of St Margaret's with the annexed canonry of Westminster Abbey was welcomed in 1899 to a stall which was exchanged for another in 1900. The approach of the coronation of Edward VII gave the new canon, with the approval of Archbishop Temple, on whom the responsibility for the service lay, an opportunity of dealing with the disastrous changes in the rite introduced by William Sancroft with his ill-advised alterations for James II, followed by those of Henry Compton for William and Mary, until the ceremony reached its lowest liturgical level in the form adopted for William IV. This process of restoration and repair was carried further in the service for George V prepared by the Lambeth librarian, Claude Jenkins, under Robinson's supervision in 1911. After Edward VII's coronation (9 August 1902), the octogenarian Dean Bradley resigned and Robinson was appointed to succeed him at the age of forty-four. He came to high office when energetic action and even drastic decisions seemed to be called for. If allowed mostly to go his own way he was not difficult to work with, even if he appeared at times to be angular and unbending. The powers of a dean of Westminster are very extensive, and Robinson was considered by his colleagues to have exercised his powers without adequate collaboration with the canons. He was an unflinching upholder of the rights of the abbey, which he served with devotion. But his deanship (1902&#150;11) was marked at times by serious differences with a chapter that also believed they had rights. In August 1908 three canons (Beeching, Hensley Henson, and Duckworth) formally made appeal to the sovereign as visitor of the abbey as to whether the dean should be considered as ordinary. The king then asked the lord chancellor, Loreburn, to act for him. In March 1911 the king decided the matter according to the chancellor's advice that the dean ought to be treated as the ordinary. Robinson had suffered from the strain and decided to resign from Westminster, but retained the office of lord high almoner, to which he had been appointed in 1906. He thereupon accepted nomination to the deanery of Wells.<br>
<br>Robinson's literary work at Westminster followed two distinct lines, theological and historical. In one class were vivid and stimulating essays such as <span class="italic">Unity in Christ</span> (1901) and <span class="italic">The Vision of Unity</span> (1908), <span class="italic">The Study of the Gospels</span> (1902), <span class="italic">Some Thoughts on the Incarnation</span> (1903), <span class="italic">On Inspiration</span> (1905), <span class="italic">On the Athanasian Creed</span> (1905), and especially an elaborate and masterly commentary on the <span class="roman">Epistle to the Ephesians</span> (1908; new edn, 1929). To the other category of his writings belong four works especially of great help to the study of early monasticism in England: <span class="italic">An Unrecognised Westminster Chronicler, 1381&#150;94</span> (1907), <span class="italic">The History of Westminster Abbey by John Flete</span> (1909), <span class="italic">Gilbert Crispin, Abbot of Westminster</span>, and <span class="italic">The Abbot's House at Westminster</span>, both published in 1911. To these must be added his share in <span class="italic">The Manuscripts of Westminster Abbey</span> by M. R. James (1909).<br>
<br>At Wells the new dean was in familiar surroundings and was able to renew friendships, especially at Downside. Robinson found additional happiness in his marriage, on 5 January 1915, to a close Lambeth Palace friend, Amy Edith, daughter of Francis Grantham Faithfull of Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, clerk to the Merchant Taylors' Company. Care of another great church of peculiar architectural features, to which he added a rood, stimulated and extended his antiquarian interests, especially his extensive study of medieval glass. His work <span class="italic">The Saxon Bishops of Wells</span> (1918), his <span class="italic">Somerset Historical Essays</span> (1923) and contributions to the Somerset Record Society's <i>collectanea</i>, his Ford lectures at Oxford in 1922 entitled &#145;The times of St Dunstan&#146;, and the studies <span class="italic">Two Glastonbury Legends</span> (1926) and <span class="italic">St Oswald and the Church of Worcester</span> (1919) are valuable, indeed essential, in separating off much piously produced legend. In other fields he published work on Irenaeus, a notable article on the early history of Canterbury convocation  (<span class="italic">Church Quarterly Review</span>, 81, Oct 1915, 1&#150;137), further study of Hermas and the <span class="roman">Didache</span> (1920), and speeches and booklets on prayer book revisions. He had maintained since early manhood deep interests in liturgical origins.<br>
<br>Cardinal D. J. Mercier of Mechelen (Malines) and Charles Lindley Wood, second Viscount Halifax (1839&#150;1934), had a deep friendship that worked to bring together Roman Catholics and Anglicans. They assembled at Mechelen a few leading theologians of each group. Archbishop Cosmo Lang of York (1864&#150;1945) urged Robinson to join in. Both Mercier and Robinson were devoted to the cause of reunion, but recognized it would advance only very slowly. But they and the Malinists generally made a new beginning in <i>rapprochement</i>. Yet such enterprises were condemned in the encyclical <span class="italic">Mortalium animos</span> of January 1928 by Pope Pius XI.<br>
<br>Robinson's last months were clouded by recurrent ill health. After resigning in March 1933 he died, childless, at his home, the Old Manor House, Upton Noble, Somerset, on 7 May 1933, and was buried on 11 May in Cloister Garth, Wells Cathedral. He was one of the early fellows of the British Academy (1903) and was appointed KCVO in 1932.<br>
