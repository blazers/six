<span class="headword">Burghill <span class="st"> [Burghull]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1330&#150;1414), <span class="occ">bishop of Coventry and Lichfield</span>, was the son of Thomas Burghill and his wife, Sibylla; heraldry links his father with the Burghills of Burghill, in Herefordshire; his mother's arms were a version of Peverel of Leicestershire. His family background is otherwise obscure. His will mentions two brothers (William and Thomas) and also two nephews, presumably the sons of at least one sister.<br>
<br>Burghill became a Dominican, being presumably a member of the Hereford house when ordained acolyte in March 1350 and priest in September 1354 by Bishop Trillek. These dates indicate that he was born in the early 1330s. His pre-episcopal career was tied to that of Thomas Rushook, warden of the Hereford Dominicans in the 1350s and later (having become confessor to Richard II) bishop of Llandaff, Chichester, and Kilmore. Burghill followed Rushook to the royal household, as his companion or chaplain. The early 1380s reveal him collecting corrodies, on the king's nomination, and receiving tithes from a forfeited alien priory. His Gloucester corrody caused litigation between 1388 and 1392, following an &#145;inadvertent&#146; displacement which may have been a side-effect of political turmoil. In 1394 Burghill became king's confessor, and participated in Richard II's expedition to Ireland that year. On 12 April 1396 he was provided to the see of Llandaff, being consecrated at Rome.<br>
<br>Burghill's provision to Coventry and Lichfield on 2 July 1398 was probably fortuitous. On Richard Scrope's translation to York earlier that year, his intended successor was John Buckingham, the bishop of Lincoln. (Whether his move was being orchestrated to allow Henry Beaufort to acquire Lincoln is unclear.) Buckingham left Lincoln but declined Lichfield, and died later that year. Burghill was then nominated, obviously because of his familiarity with the king (who lent 1000 marks to cover his dues to the papacy), but probably not as a political act. His enthronement on 8 September 1398 was attended by Richard II, several nobles, and three archbishops (of York, Canterbury, and Dublin). Initially Burghill was an absentee, spending much of his time in attendance on the king, whom he accompanied to Ireland in 1399. That expedition gave the opportunity for Henry Bolingbroke's invasion and Richard II's removal from the throne, a revolution to which Burghill was probably an eyewitness.<br>
<br>Under Henry IV Burghill concentrated on his episcopal duties, rarely leaving his diocese. His principal residences were first Eccleshall and later Heywood, both in Staffordshire. This may have been a reaction to the events of 1399: Burghill remained loyal to Richard II's memory, being the sole bishop to attend his interment at Kings Langley on 14 March 1400. His own tomb became the new site for the chantry in Lichfield Cathedral that Richard Scrope had founded for himself and Richard II. However, his loyalty was pragmatic: he did not join any of the Ricardian plots of the early 1400s. From 1400 he had effectively retired from the national scene, possibly as a result of advancing age: he seems not to have attended any parliaments after 1399.<br>
<br>As bishop, Burghill fostered both his cathedral churches. At Coventry he promoted the cult of St Osberga, whose relics lay in the priory. To acknowledge his support an annual commemoration was established for him in 1409. He also supported Lichfield, making gifts of vestments and aiding the vicars-choral. By August 1409 his tomb had been constructed near the high altar, and here he was eventually buried. Burghill died in 1414, a grant of the temporalities <i>sede vacante</i> issuing on 20 May. His character is obscure, although Adam Usk calls him <i>vir avarissimus</i>. His will, made on 21 June 1412, scattered bequests widely, much going to religious houses. His arms in stained glass were depicted at several points in Lichfield Cathedral, with representations of himself and family members over the south door; but these have all disappeared.<br>
