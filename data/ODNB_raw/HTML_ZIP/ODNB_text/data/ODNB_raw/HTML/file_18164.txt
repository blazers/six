<span class="headword">Marston,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1576, <em>d.</em> 1634), <span class="occ">poet and playwright</span>, was baptized on 7 October 1576 at Wardington, Oxfordshire, the son of John Marston (<i>d</i>. 1599), lawyer, and Maria (<i>d</i>. 1621?), daughter of Andrew Guarsi, possibly a descendant of Katherine of Aragon's Italian physician, Balthasar Guarsi. His parents married at Wardington on 19 September 1575, where his maternal grandmother, Elizabeth Grey, had resided since her marriage to her second husband, John Butler.<h2>
<a name="Thelawandearlydramaticcareer"></a>The law and early dramatic career</h2>Marston's father belonged to the Middle Temple but retained strong midlands connections. He was appointed counsel to the city of Coventry (22 September 1585) and its steward (13 April 1588), and he acted as lawyer to Thomas Greene, Shakespeare's &#145;cousin&#146; and solicitor to the corporation of Stratford upon Avon. Marston senior's grant of arms (29 November 1587) describes him as &#145;late of the Middle Temple &hellip; now of the city and county of Coventry&#146; although the family retained property in Wardington and Cropredy as well as acquiring a new house in Cross Cheaping, Coventry. By 1592 the Middle Temple records were listing Marston senior as &#145;of Coventry&#146; and his son, who matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford, in February 1592, described himself as a gentleman from Warwickshire. Marston junior may in fact have been at Oxford since 1591 and he graduated BA in February 1594. Although he continued at Oxford until 1594 he was also &#145;specially&#146; admitted to the Middle Temple (on 2 August 1592) by his father during his term as reader. By November 1595 Marston resided at the Temple (he and his father stood surety for Thomas Greene as a new entrant) studying under the tutorship of John Armitage and probably sharing chambers with his father.<br>
<br>As the son of a prosperous and prominent lawyer, Marston was expected to follow his father into the law but in 1598 he published the Ovidian erotic poem and Juvenalian verse satires <span class="italic">Metamorphosis of Pigmalion's Image and Certaine Satyres</span>, and later in the same year his <span class="italic">The Scourge of Villanie</span> appeared. His father's will (written 24 October 1599) shows that although he had &#145;hoped that my son would have profited in the study of law&#146;, he feared that his son might even sell his precious law books as he took &#145;delight in plays and vain studies and fooleries&#146;. These lines, cancelled in the final version, reveal that Marston had theatrical interests some time before 1599; they may also show that the burning of his poems under the bishops' ban on 4 June 1599, often assumed to have caused Marston to adopt a dramatic career, probably occurred after he had begun to write plays. Unfortunately, the opening work of Marston's dramatic career cannot be determined, and although it has been generally accepted that he began with the revision of an older play, <span class="italic">Histriomastix</span> (published 1610), possibly written for the inns of court for Christmas 1598, the evidence remains far from convincing. <span class="italic">Histriomastix</span> was never attributed to Marston during his life and, indeed, the attribution (only made by Richard Simpson in 1878), rests on limited internal evidence complicated by the poor state of the text and the likelihood of further revision.<br>
<br>It is possible, then, that Marston's dramatic career began as early as 1598, although the auspices, exact date, and even the title, remain unknown. By September 1599 his literary fame was sufficient for Henslowe to employ him as a jobbing writer for the public stage although most of his earlier work was written for the Paul's Boys, one of the new &#145;private&#146; children's companies. Marston produced <span class="italic">Jack Drum's Entertainment</span> (1600), <span class="italic">Antonio and Mellida</span> (1600), and <span class="italic">Antonio's Revenge</span> (1601) for this company, combining Italianate settings, romance, and Senecan and revenge elements with witty satire of contemporary literary and social fashions and his particular, extravagantly inventive vocabulary. Throughout his career Marston's work is characterized by an acute awareness of new literary fashions and styles, drawing on Aretino (possibly directly from the Italian), Montaigne through John Florio's translation, and upon the fashionable, intellectual cultures of the inns of court. By 1601 Marston was an established literary figure, praised as a satirist by Francis Meres (<span class="italic">Paladis tamia</span>, 1598), while for John Weever he &#145;enharbour[ed] Horace vein&#146;, and he merited enough attention to be one of the central targets of the Cambridge satirical play, <span class="italic">The Return from Parnassus, Part Two</span> (1601&#150;2). Extracts from his plays appear in the commonplace book of Edward Pudsey, a Warwickshire gentleman who recorded the fashionable plays he had seen about 1600&#150;01 (including <span class="italic">Merchant of Venice</span> and <span class="italic">Every Man in his Humour</span>), and Marston also contributed to Robert Chester's <span class="italic">Love's Martyr</span> (1601) along with others of the &#145;best and chiefest of our modern writers&#146; (as they were described on the title-page).<br>
<br>Marston was notoriously quarrelsome. John Manningham's <span class="italic">Diary</span> (21 November 1602) records his gratuitous rudeness to Alderman More's wife's daughter (he first commended her beauty and then when she saluted him as a poet, he retorted &#145;poets feign and lie, and so did I &hellip; for you are exceeding foul&#146;), although this rebarbative tone also belongs to Martson's poetic persona. In <span class="italic">Certaine Satyres</span> he signed himself as &#145;Kinsayder&#146;, a punning name (&#145;kinsing&#146; is the castration of a dog) alluding to the dog-like barking of satire which, though rough and cynical, can equally fawn and flatter. In <span class="italic">The Return from Parnassus, Part Two</span>, Marston's poetic mask is criticized as merely &#145;lifting up your [his] leg and pissing against the world&#146;  (<span class="smallcap">I</span>.ii, ll. 266&#150;70) while the braggart Furor Poeticus imitates Marston's poetic violence and linguistic experiments. Furor's &#145;roister doister&#146; &#145;cuts, thrusts and foins at whomsoever he meets&#146;  (<span class="smallcap">I</span>.ii, ll. 272&#150;3), and encapsulates Marston's fractious relations with contemporary satirists, such as Joseph Hall (who may have authored the <span class="italic">Parnassus</span> plays), who had angered Marston due to his attack on <span class="italic">Pigmalion</span>.<h2>
<a name="MarstonandJonson"></a>Marston and Jonson</h2>Marston's other famously difficult relationship was with his poetic rival and sometime collaborator, Ben Jonson. Jonson told William Drummond in 1619 that he had beaten Marston and taken his pistol from him (an incident that underlies Jonson's <span class="italic">Epigrams</span>, 68), although in &#145;On Playwrights&#146; their relations are characterized by sly admiration for Marston's folly and perseverance. This epigram implies that the two writers continuously compared themselves and debated each other's work. The relationship exploded into public disagreement during the &#145;War of the theatres&#146; (<i>c</i>.1600&#150;02), when Jonson attacked Marston, first in <span class="italic">Every Man out of his Humour</span> (1600) (through Clove and Orange) and in <span class="italic">Cynthia's Revels</span> (1600) (as Hedon) and then at greater length in <span class="italic">Poetaster</span> (1601), where the idiotic, effeminate Crispinus is forced to vomit up his Marstonian fustian. The precise occasion of this public spat remains opaque but Marston may have satirized Jonson in <span class="italic">Histriomastix</span> (as Chrisoganus, if the attribution is accepted) and possibly again in his farce-like <span class="italic">Jack Drum's Entertainment</span> (as Brabant Senior). Although many of the motives for the &#145;war&#146; are unclear, Weever's comparison of both Jonson and Marston as the heirs of Horace, and Thomas Dekker's devastating satire on Jonson as a false Horace in <span class="italic">Satiromastix</span> (1601), may suggest a genuine debate over the role and method of the satirist, perhaps combined with or fuelled by the commercial rivalries between the boy companies. Marston's unjustly neglected play, <span class="italic">What You Will</span> (1601), dramatizes the failure of the railing Lampatho Doria to achieve moral reform of the debauched &#145;duke&#146; of Venice. Indeed, even the play's epicurean philosopher Quadratus fails to appeal to the duke's sensual side sufficiently. The incapacity of both satirist and philosopher presents a bleak view of the inability of writers to reform their society, while the play's depiction of Lampatha Doria as both Jonsonian and Marstonian (he is called a &#145;Don Kinsayder&#146;) suggests the failure of both approaches to social satire.<br>
<br>Despite the antagonism and violence in their relationship, Jonson and Marston had much in common. Certainly Marston admired Jonson, writing a prefatory poem to <span class="italic">Sejanus</span> (1605) and dedicating <span class="italic">The Malcontent</span> to his fellow writer and &#145;amico suo candido et cordato&#146;. This published dedication to a living person, unique in Marston's <i>&#339;uvre</i>, conveys the primacy of Jonson's role in shaping Marston's sense of himself as a writer. In contrast to Jonson, Marston's independent means allowed him to disdain the search for patronage that preoccupied his rival. Instead, Marston offered his works to &#145;the most honourably renowned Nobody, bounteous Maecenas of Poetry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Antonio and Mellida</span>) or &#145;to the world's mighty monarch, Good Opinion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Certaine Satyres</span>) and &#145;To Everlasting Oblivion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scourge of Villanie</span>).<br>
<br>Some time in 1603&#150;4 Marston exchanged the Paul's Boys, now devoted to developing a more citizen-oriented market, for another &#145;private&#146; company, the Children of the Blackfriars (also briefly known as the Children of Queen's Revels after 1604), at some point also becoming a shareholder in the company. It was for this company, notorious for a &#145;railing&#146; style that constantly tested the authorities' patience and the limits of privilege granted by their connection to Anne of Denmark's court, that Marston produced his two most successful and sustained plays, <span class="italic">The Malcontent</span> (<i>c</i>.1603; revised <i>c</i>.1604 by Webster for the King's Men) and <span class="italic">The Dutch Courtesan</span> (<i>c</i>.1604&#150;5). In particular, <span class="italic">The Malcontent</span>, a harsh comedy that debates both the possibility and desirability of revenge and political and social reform, became Marston's trade-mark play. The appeal to a &#145;reformed muse&#146; may echo the hopes for political reform at the outset of the Jacobean regime, but the restless, darkly cynical humour embodied in its central figure, Malevole, also suggests a stark realization of the unlikelihood of its achievement in a pervasively corrupt world.<br>
<br>In 1605 Marston collaborated with George Chapman and Jonson on <span class="italic">Eastward Ho</span>, a play that satirized both citizen mores and their literary taste for romance, repentance narratives, and moral dramas, while also not sparing the pretensions to gentility of the impecunious knight, Sir Petronel Flash, and his deluded search for fabulous wealth in Virginia. Although the play appears to have been performed in 1605, during the court's summer progress, it attracted the attention of the authorities. One copy of the play retains a cancel leaf with a vicious satire on colonial enterprises, borrowing from Thomas More's <span class="italic">Utopia</span> to describe Virginia's fantastical plenty, where the dissolute adventurers may also &#145;live freely &hellip; without sergeants, or courtiers, or lawyers, or intelligencers&#151;only a few industrious Scots&#146;  (<span class="smallcap">III</span>.iii, ll. 42&#150;4). The authors were &#145;delated to the king&#146; by Sir James Murray, brother of John Murray, a member of the king's bedchamber, and Chapman and Jonson were imprisoned for &#145;writing something against the Scots&#146;  (&#145;Conversations with Drummond&#146;, ll. 273&#150;7, in <span class="italic">Ben Jonson</span>, ed. C. H. Herford and P. E. Simpson, 11 vols., 1925&#150;52, vol. 1). Marston appears to have escaped. The precise cause of the offence (Chapman and Jonson claimed it was &#145;but two clauses&#146; and shuffled the blame on the actors) and the exact sequence of events remain unclear but the offence seems to have either been mitigated or explained away. In 1606 Marston produced his <span class="italic">Parasitaster, or, The Fawn</span>, widely held to satirize King James, even though, as the printed text suggests, he may have done this from a safe distance from London. However, <span class="italic">The Dutch Courtesan</span> was staged during the king of Denmark's visit in July and August 1606 and Marston wrote some Latin verses for the king's ceremonial entry into London on 31 July. The presentation of a holograph copy of these verses to James VI and I (BL, Royal MS 18 A.xxxi) might suggest that Marston either had arrived back in favour or was seeking forgiveness.<h2>
<a name="Leavingthestage"></a>Leaving the stage</h2>During 1605&#150;6 Marston finally parted company with Jonson as the prefatory epistle to <span class="italic">Sophonisba, or, The Wonder of Woman</span> (1606) criticizes Jonsonian pedantry by its refusal &#145;to transcribe authors, quote authorities, and translate Latin prose orations into English blank verse&#146;, a pointed critique of Jonson's <span class="italic">Sejanus</span>. <span class="italic">Sophonisba</span>, a heroic tragedy set in the Carthaginian wars, prefigures Fletcherian drama and marks an increasingly serious temper in Marston's writing. By 1607 he had left the professional stage, his final work (published 1613, although it may have been begun as early as 1603&#150;4), <span class="italic">The Insatiate Countess</span>, was left unfinished and was completed by William Barkstead and Lewis Machin (<i>c</i>.1608&#150;13). The only other work which can be certainly attributed to Marston, <span class="italic">The Entertainment at Ashby</span> (1607), is a country-house masque, written to be performed at the home of the earl and countess of Huntingdon to celebrate the arrival of Alice, dowager countess of Derby (the countess of Huntingdon's mother). The masque circulated in manuscript among the midlands gentry who had commissioned and performed the piece (such as Sir Gervase Clifton of Nottinghamshire, the addressee of Marston's one extant holograph letter) and the manuscript, Huntington Library, MS EL 34 B9, originates from the Egerton (Bridgewater) Library. None of the other later works attributed to Marston, such as <span class="italic">The Mountebank's Masque</span> (1616) or the satires on the duke of Buckingham (<i>c</i>.1628), can confidently be ascribed to his authorship.<br>
<br>Although Anthony Nixon's <span class="italic">The Black Year</span> (1606) suggests that Marston was &#145;sent away westward for carping both at court, city and country&#146;, in <span class="italic">The Dutch Courtesan</span>, and perhaps <span class="italic">Eastward Ho</span>, there is no evidence that Marston was compelled to leave the stage. It may be that the furore created by <span class="italic">Eastward Ho</span> or financial exigency impelled him to give up writing for the public stage by late 1606, but a more likely reason was his marriage to Mary (<i>d</i>. 1657), daughter of William Wilkes, one of James VI and I's favourite chaplains. Documentary evidence for the marriage date has not survived but in his will (6 May 1630), Wilkes forgave Marston &#145;all that is or may be due unto me for lodging and diet, for himself, his wife, his man and maid which he had of me eleven years&#146;. As Marston left the Wilkes household some time in 1616, the &#145;eleven years&#146; lodging implies a marriage in 1605. Marston also sold his shares in the Blackfriars company to Robert Keysar some time between 1606 and 1608 (probably in 1606 or 1607) and in 1609 when he supplicated to read at the Bodleian Library in Oxford he stated that he had been studying philosophy for the past three years. Although it has been conjectured that he was the John Marston condemned to Newgate in 1608, the extant extracts from the privy council registers omit any offence and do not identify the prisoner precisely. E. K. Chambers and others incorrectly identified and dated the author of a letter to Lord Kimbolton with the playwright rather than with the radical Canterbury cleric of the same name and argued that Marston could have written the infamous &#145;Scots Mine&#146; play (or plays) that precipitated the closure of the Children of Blackfriars. There is, however, no evidence to suggest that Marston was either in prison or responsible for this dramatic satire.<br>
<br>By 1609&#150;10 Marston had transformed himself into a cleric. He was ordained deacon on 24 September 1609, joined St Mary Hall, Oxford, and became a priest on 24 December. This conversion caused some comment at the time and Thomas Floyde, in a letter to William Trumbull in Brussels, received in February 1610, noted that &#145;Marston the poet is minister and hath preached at Oxon&#146;. In 1619 Jonson wryly observed that &#145;Marston wrote his father in law's preachings, and that his father-in-law his comedies&#146;  (&#145;Conversations with Drummond&#146;, ll. 273&#150;7, in <span class="italic">Ben Jonson</span>, ed. C. H. Herford and P. E. Simpson, 11 vols., 1925&#150;52, vol. 1), while more contemporary comments convey the surprise at Marston's change of direction. John Davies ascribed the translation to &#145;malcontentedness&#146; over &#145;Time mis-spent&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scourge of Folly</span>, 1610, epigram 217, &#145;To acute Mr. John Marston&#146;) while Francis Beaumont's verse epistle to Jonson (before 1616, possibly <i>c</i>.1610&#150;11) comments on Marston's &#145;wretched&#146; &#145;state&#146;<blockquote>
<div>ordained to write the grin<br>
</div>
<div>After the fawn and fleer.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>By 18 June 1610 Marston appears as &#145;clerk&#146; (priest) at Barford St Martin, Wiltshire, presumably acting as a curate to his father-in-law who held the living, and in October 1616 he was preferred to the living of Christchurch, Hampshire, the first fruits of which were paid in 1617.<br>
<br>After 1616 Marston fades into obscurity. In 1621 he inherited lands from his mother and in 1624 his only son, John, died. In 1631 he resigned his living and returned to London. His only activity connected to his former literary career was to lobby, through William Whalley, to have his name removed from the title-page of the 1633 collected edition of his plays printed by William Sheares. He died in London on 24 June 1634 (his will was dated 17 June) and was buried in Middle Temple Church, where the inscription on his tomb read <i>Oblivioni sacrum</i>. His wife died in 1657.<br>
