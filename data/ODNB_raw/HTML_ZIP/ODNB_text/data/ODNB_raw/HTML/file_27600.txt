<span class="headword">Towne,  Joseph</span>  (1806&#150;1879), <span class="occ">anatomical modeller</span>, was born in Royston, near Cambridge, on 25 November 1806, the middle of the five sons of the Revd Thomas Towne (<i>d</i>. 1830), pastor to the New Meeting-House and also a director of the London Missionary Society, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1839), a schoolteacher. His father was an accomplished painter and in his later years a writer on painting and the camera obscura. Little is known of the youth of Joseph Towne but almost certainly he benefited from the teaching of both his father and his mother. The former, as well as being a minister, ran the local boys' school, and the latter a school for middle-class young ladies.<br>
<br>Through his literary work and his great interest in art, his father would have encouraged Joseph Towne's enthusiasm as a child for modelling animals in clay. He later arranged for Joseph to take his 33 inch high wax model of a human skeleton to Cambridge to show the professor of anatomy, William Clark. Encouraged by his favourable reception in Cambridge, at the age of nineteen Towne travelled to London intending to enter the Society of Arts competition in wax modelling. His brother Jireh and cousins Jonah and Alexander (the latter training as a surgeon at the Webb Street school) were living in the City area. On 17 February 1826 Towne was introduced to three doctors, including W. O. Grainger, lecturer in anatomy and physiology in Webb Street, who referred him to Sir Astley Cooper, a surgeon at Guy's Hospital. Cooper responded positively to Towne's evident skill and authenticated his wax model as an accurate rendition of the human skeleton. Towne was given a letter of recommendation to Mr Harrison, the treasurer of Guy's Hospital, who engaged him as the modeller for the new medical school. He was to remain at Guy's for fifty-three years.<br>
<br>Towne's skeleton in wax was subsequently entered in the Society of Arts' competition and won second prize, the silver medal. A year later Towne exhibited models of the brain, highly praised by Astley Cooper, which secured him the gold medal. He settled into his work at Guy's and five years later, in 1832, he married Mary Butterfield.<br>
<br>During the many years he worked at Guy's Hospital Towne completed a prodigious amount of work. Modelling human anatomy in wax from the careful dissections of John Hilton, who was appointed lecturer in anatomy in 1828, he produced in the next ten years over two hundred anatomical wax models. The work was carried out in a room in the old anatomy theatre at Guy's which he always kept locked. During this time he trained his younger brother Elihu who became a wax modeller himself. No one else was privy to the technique that was used and the secrets of his skills in preparing and colouring the wax died with him. His brother Elihu died at an early age in 1834.<br>
<br>In the middle period of his work at Guy's, Towne produced in association with Dr Addison, physician to Guy's, over five hundred models of skin diseases. In 1834 he exhibited for the first time a marble bust at the Royal Academy. Throughout his working life he exhibited altogether thirteen sculptures in marble at the Royal Academy and another seven which were privately commissioned. Included among these were two busts of the duke of Wellington (one, exh. 1837, is in Guy's Hospital, London; the other, exh. 1842, is in the Junior United Service Club, London), and busts of Benjamin Harrison, Sir Astley Paston Cooper (1841), and the physician Addison (1852) (the last two in Guy's Hospital, London). His bust of Florence Nightingale (marble, 1850) is in the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, Bournemouth. He produced a small equestrian statue of the duke of Kent, which was presented to Queen Victoria by Benjamin Harrison on 1 November 1837. Towne himself was presented to the young queen.<br>
<br>In his later years Towne gave a course of lectures at Guy's on the brain and intellect. From 1862 to 1870 he gave lectures on stereoscopic and binocular vision and was still exhibiting at the Royal Academy at the age of sixty. Towne died at his home, Sefton House, Eltham, Kent, on 25 June 1879, and was buried in Norwood cemetery in a grave next to that of his father. His wife and descendants are buried close by. Thomas Bryant (1828&#150;1914), surgeon to Guy's Hospital, wrote a memorial and short biography:<blockquote>of my old friend Joseph Towne, the late well-known, highly esteemed, skilled modeller of Guy's Hospital &hellip; all who ever walked round Guy's Hospital can testify &hellip; the magnitude of the work he has left behind &hellip; [the] magnitude in respect to the number of works executed, upwards of one thousand &hellip; [and] with respect to their importance and scientific value &hellip;</blockquote>Whereas France was the main source of expertise in this medium, with skills being transferred to England via Madame Tussaud who arrived in England in 1802, Towne's wax models are some of very few nineteenth-century British anatomical waxes to survive. The majority of his models are on display in the Guy's Hospital medical school museum.<br>
