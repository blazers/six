<span class="headword">Manby,  Thomas</span>  (1769&#150;1834), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born on 1 January 1769 of a family long settled at Manby in Lincolnshire, was the son of Matthew Pepper Manby (<i>d</i>. 1774) of Hilgay in Norfolk, lieutenant of marines, captain in the Welch fusiliers, and afterwards aide-de-camp to Lord Townshend when lord lieutenant of Ireland (1767&#150;72). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17919/', "George William Manby")</script> was his elder brother. Townshend, when lieutenant-general of the ordnance, gave Thomas Manby a post in the department, but the boy, preferring to go to sea, was entered on the frigate <i>Hyaena</i>, on the Irish station, in 1783. In 1785 he was moved into the sloop <i>Cygnet</i>, in which he went to the West Indies. He was afterwards in the <i>Amphion</i> and, returning in her to England, served briefly in the <i>Illustrious</i>. Towards the end of 1790 he joined the <i>Discovery</i>, then fitting out for a voyage to the Pacific and the north-west coast of North America, under the command of Captain George Vancouver. In early 1793, when it was necessary to send some of the officers of the expedition to England and to China, Manby was appointed master of the brig <i>Chatham</i>, the <i>Discovery's</i> consort, in which he remained for the next two years engaged in the arduous work of the survey. In 1795 he was moved back into the <i>Discovery</i> as acting lieutenant, and on his return to England was confirmed in that rank on 27 October 1795. In 1796 he was a lieutenant of the <i>Juste</i>, and when Lord Hugh Seymour was preparing for an expedition to the Pacific, Manby, at Seymour's request, was promoted on 5 February 1797 to command the <i>Charon</i>, a 44-gun ship that was armed <i>en fl&ucirc;te</i> as a store ship. The proposed expedition was afterwards countermanded, and the <i>Charon</i> was employed in transporting troops to Ireland during the Irish rising (1798). Reportedly on one occasion she took on board a thousand men at Portsmouth, landed them at Guernsey within twenty-four hours, embarked another thousand, and landed these on the following day at Waterford. She also convoyed the local trade and cruised against privateers. In the two years during which Manby commanded her he is said to have given protection to no fewer than 4753 vessels, not one of which was lost.<br>
<br>Manby was advanced to post rank on 22 January 1799 and towards the end of the year was appointed to the <i>Bordelais</i>, a remarkably fine and fast vessel built as a French privateer and captured on her second trip by the <i>R&eacute;volutionnaire</i>, herself a prize and the work of the same builder. The <i>Bordelais</i> was considered to be a most attractive vessel, though dangerous because of the weakness of her frame. During 1800 she cruised off the Azores. Afterwards she was on the blockade of Flushing but proved very unfit for this service, being long, narrow, and low in the water and consequently so wet that her crew became very sickly. She was therefore ordered to Spithead, and thence to the West Indies, sailing at the end of the year with the frigate <i>Andromache</i> and a large convoy. The convoy was dispersed in a gale off Cape Finisterre, Spain, and Manby was afterwards sent to look out for the stragglers to the eastward of Barbados. On his way he recaptured two of them, already prizes to a French privateer, and on 28 January 1801 fell in with two large brigs and a schooner, French warships, which had been sent by the governor of Cayenne to prey on the British West India fleet. The brigs had very inferior armament to that of the <i>Bordelais</i>, but they carried nearly twice the number of men and apparently thought to carry her by boarding. No sooner, however, did the <i>Bordelais</i> open fire on the leading brig, the <i>Curieuse</i>, than the others turned and fled. Following a brave fight the <i>Curieuse</i> surrendered and sank shortly after. This action helped to save the scattered convoy from danger. During the year Manby was employed in cruising, and when peace came he was moved into the <i>Juno</i>, one of the squadron on the coast of San Domingo, and in her returned to England in August 1802.<br>
<br>Manby was shortly afterwards appointed to the <i>Africaine</i>, a 48-gun frigate in which, on the renewal of the war, he was stationed off Helvoetsluys with a 24-gun frigate to blockade two large French frigates there with troops on board. This irksome service lasted for nearly two years until, the French frigates having been dismantled and having passed through the canal to Flushing, the <i>Africaine</i> joined the squadron off Texel. After serious damage in a heavy gale, she had to go to Sheerness to refit. She was then sent to the West Indies with convoy and arrived at Barbados with a crew of 340 men, all in perfect health. Her orders were to return to England with the homeward-bound trade and to take on some invalids from the hospitals. Within forty-eight hours of her departure from Carlisle Bay virulent yellow fever was raging on board. The surgeon and the assistant surgeon died on the second day. Manby himself carried out their duties and, on the advice of a doctor at St Kitts, dealt out large doses of calomel. However, his anxiety brought on an attack of the fever, which nearly proved fatal. At Tortola in the Virgin Islands a surgeon was procured, and after a terrible passage of six weeks, during which a third of her crew was lost, the <i>Africaine</i> arrived at Falmouth. From there she was sent to do quarantine at the Isles of Scilly, after which she was paid out of commission.<br>
<br>About the time of Manby's appointment to the <i>Africaine</i> he was presented by Lady Townshend to the princess of Wales, who was friendly towards him. Afterwards several witnesses swore that she conducted herself towards him with undue, if not criminal, familiarity; on 22 September 1806 Manby made affidavit that this testimony was &#145;a vile and wicked invention, wholly and absolutely false&#146;  (<span class="italic">&#145;The Book!&#146;</span>, 181&#150;2). These allegations continued, however, sometimes making Manby the father of a child of the princess. She herself always maintained that she had humbugged him in this business.<br>
<br>In 1807 Manby, in the <i>Thalia</i> in command of a small squadron, was stationed at Jersey, and in 1808 he was sent, in company with the frigate <i>Medusa</i> and a brig, to look out for two French frigates supposed to have gone to the Davis Strait to prey on the whalers. After a trying and unsuccessful cruise of twelve weeks, he and his crew stocked up with wood and water at a harbour on the coast of Labrador, which he surveyed and named Port Manvers. They then returned to England by way of Newfoundland, the Azores, and Gibraltar. The Arctic service had severely tried Manby's constitution, which was already impaired by yellow fever. His health was ruined, and he was obliged to give up his command. He purchased an estate at Northwold in Norfolk, where he settled for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>In 1810 Manby married Julia Hamond of Northwold; they had two daughters. On 27 May 1825 he was promoted to the rank of rear-admiral. He died from an overdose of opium at the George Hotel, Southampton, on 13 June 1834.<br>
