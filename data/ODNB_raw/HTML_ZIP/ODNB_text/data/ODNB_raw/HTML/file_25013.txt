<span class="headword">Sedgwick,  Daniel</span>  (1814&#150;1879), <span class="occ">hymnologist</span>, was born on 26 November 1814 in Leadenhall Street, London, the son of William Sedgwick and his wife, Frances. He was baptized at St Katharine Cree, London, on 25 December 1814. After serving an apprenticeship, he became a shoemaker. In 1839 he married, and joined the Strict Baptist congregation at Providence Chapel, Grosvenor Street, Commercial Road. In 1837 he had given up shoemaking to deal in secondhand books. He gradually worked up a connection among collectors, mainly of theological literature. His shop was at 81 Sun Street, Bishopsgate.<br>
<br>In 1840 Sedgwick taught himself writing, and acquired a neat and clear hand, but never gained any facility in literary composition. In 1859 he commenced publishing reprints of works by the rarer hymn writers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, under the general title of <span class="roman">Library of Spiritual Song</span>. Pursuing his studies in hymnology, he produced in 1860 <span class="italic">A Comprehensive Index of Many of the Original Authors and Translators of Psalms and Hymns</span>, with the dates of their various works, chiefly collected from the original publications; an enlarged second edition appeared in 1863. After this he was recognized as the foremost living hymnologist. He was consulted by men of all opinions&#151;by Charles Haddon Spurgeon, when compiling <span class="italic">Our Own Hymn-Book</span> (1866), and Josiah Miller, when writing <span class="italic">Singers and Songs of the Church</span> (1869). When Sir Roundell Palmer was compiling his <span class="italic">Book of Praise</span> in 1862 the sheets were submitted to Sedgwick's inspection; he identified the majority of the compositions. In fact, hardly a hymnbook appeared in his later days in which his aid was not acknowledged. Ironically, &#145;the hymn-books in use in every religious denomination&#146; during Sedgwick's career &#145;were directly indebted to &hellip; a man whom many people would have been ashamed to speak to in the streets on account of his seedy appearance&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 409). His manuscripts were used in J. Julian's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Hymnology</span>. Sedgwick died of heart disease at 93 Sun Street on 10 March 1879, and was buried in Abney Park cemetery. His wife, Hannah, survived him; they had had no children.<br>
