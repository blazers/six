<span class="headword">Pryce,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1735, <em>d.</em> 1790), <span class="occ">surgeon, mineralogist, and antiquary</span>, was born at Redruth, Cornwall, and baptized there on 14 June 1735. He was the only son (there was also a daughter, who died in infancy) of surgeon Samuel Pryce (<i>d</i>. 1741) and his wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1744), daughter of William Hill and his wife, also Catherine, who was sister of the antiquary William Borlase (1695&#150;1772). Orphaned at an early age, Pryce was cared for by the prominent Falmouth attorney Philip Webber, a kinsman who became a lifelong friend.<br>
<br>In 1751 Pryce was apprenticed to the Redruth surgeon Philip Tingcombe. Following an additional period studying dissection under a Dr Hunter (probably either John or William Hunter of London), Pryce himself set up as a surgeon in Redruth. About this time, he also bought shares in local mines (and managed some small-scale mining operations). On 17 August 1758 he married Catherine Michell (<i>bap</i>. 1733, <i>d</i>. 1813) in Redruth. The couple had two sons, Samuel Vincent (1761&#150;1817), who became a surgeon and banker, and William, a surgeon, and a daughter, Catherine (1764&#150;1765), who died in infancy.<br>
<br>With commercial interests in local mining, Pryce appreciated the advantage of bringing coal more cheaply to the local tin and copper mines. As a result, he initiated a scheme to build a quay at Portreath in 1763 but failed to meet his part of the costs; his shares were sold in 1767. Some time thereafter Borlase encouraged Pryce to develop his notes on mining into a book. He drew on manuscripts on the history of mining in Cornwall, adding information obtained from his own observations and from local experts, as well as from such diverse characters as Cookworthy (on the divining rod) and Matthew Boulton (on Watt's improvements to the steam engine). Pryce's <span class="italic">Mineralogia Cornubiensis</span> was published by subscription in 1778.<br>
<br>A freemason, in 1773 Pryce proposed that the Redruth lodge should be known as the Druids Lodge of Love and Liberality. It proved an inappropriate name, as in 1779 relations between the brethren became far from loving and he set up an irregular lodge.<br>
<br>Pryce was awarded the degree of MD by the University of St Andrews in 1781. Two years later, on 26 June 1783, Pryce was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. The society's vice-president, Daines Barrington, knew that Pryce was the owner of a manuscript on Cornish by Tonkin and that he intended to publish a Cornish grammar and dictionary. <span class="italic">Archaeologia Cornu-Britannica</span> was finally published in 1790. In it, Pryce collated the manuscripts of Tonkin, Hals, and others and added information gained by interviewing old people who claimed to speak Cornish. Although accused at the time of plagiarism, he referred to himself as editor and fully acknowledged his sources in the work's preface. He died at Redruth in December 1790 and was buried there on the 20th of that month.<br>
