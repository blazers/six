<span class="headword">Bynoe,  Benjamin</span>  (1803&#150;1865), <span class="occ">ship's surgeon and naturalist</span>, was born at Christ Church, Barbados, on 25 July 1803, the son of Samuel and Elizabeth Bynoe. Nothing is known of Bynoe's education and though he was sometimes styled MD there is no record that he obtained this qualification in the British Isles. However, Bynoe obtained his &#145;London diploma&#146; on 18 March 1825 and on 20 May 1825 he became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons.<br>
<br>In September 1825 Bynoe passed for appointment as assistant surgeon, Royal Navy. Four weeks later he joined the surveying ship <i>Beagle</i>, on its voyage to South America. When the <i>Beagle</i>'s senior surgeon was invalided in July 1828, Bynoe was appointed acting surgeon. The <i>Beagle</i> surveyed Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego, and the Strait of Magellan. For three months in 1829 Bynoe joined a small party crewing the tender <i>Adelaide</i>; they surveyed the Magdalen and Barbara channels. Bynoe was also aboard the <i>Adelaide</i> during its survey of the Gulf of Penas. His name was given to two landmarks on that notoriously dangerous coast: Cape Bynoe (Bynoe Point) and Bynoe Island. They rejoined the <i>Beagle</i> at Port Famine in May 1830. By October Bynoe was on half-pay, lodging in the New Kent Road area of London.<br>
<br>On 5 July 1831 Bynoe qualified as a surgeon, but he found promotion elusive and rejoined the <i>Beagle</i> as assistant surgeon; they sailed in December 1831. Joining them on this voyage was Charles Darwin, sailing as private naturalist. Darwin profoundly influenced Bynoe, who subsequently became an ardent collector. In April 1832 the <i>Beagle</i>'s surgeon was invalided and Bynoe again became acting surgeon. The ship visited the coasts of South America; while at Valpara&iacute;so, Bynoe treated Darwin with calomel after he had become unwell, possibly with the illness which was to recur throughout his lifetime. They then travelled on to the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands, Polynesia, New Zealand, Australia, Mauritius, and the Cape; he returned to England via Brazil, and arrived at Falmouth in October 1836. After his return Bynoe's rank of surgeon was officially confirmed, and he was appointed surgeon of the <i>Beagle</i> in February 1837, on its voyage to survey the Australian coast. In September 1839 Captain Wickham named a coastal feature Bynoe harbour (Bynoe Bay). The Bynoe inlet and Bynoe River, on the Gulf of Carpentaria, commemorate Bynoe's skill as a surgeon, as it was here that he saved an officer's badly damaged foot. The <i>Beagle</i> reached England in September 1843. Bynoe married about this time and he and his wife Charlotte lived at various addresses near the Old Kent Road, London.<br>
<br>In early 1844 Bynoe was appointed surgeon superintendent of the convict ship <i>Blundell</i>, destined for Norfolk Island. Later he was appointed surgeon on the survey vessel <i>Fly</i>, travelling with John MacGillivray, the earl of Derby's private natural history collector on the ship's survey of the Great Barrier Reef and Torres Strait. During his absence Bynoe was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. In March 1846 Bynoe joined the <i>Lord Auckland</i>, a convict transport to Hobart, but he was landed at the Cape of Good Hope with pneumonia and returned to England. Throughout the winter of 1846&#150;7 Bynoe worked for his certificate proving that he had &#145;performed the capital operations of surgery on the dead body&#146;  (Keevil, 105). In February 1847 Bynoe was sent to Cork to aid victims of the potato famine, but he fell ill himself with dysentery and fever.<br>
<br>Bynoe returned to London in October 1847 and in succession joined the <i>Ocean</i>, the <i>Ganges</i>, and the <i>Wellington</i>; in 1850 he joined the <i>Monarch</i>, and in November 1851 the <i>Aboukir</i>, a convict transport. Although in increasingly poor health, he joined the <i>Madagascar</i> in 1853. In 1860 he was appointed staff surgeon but he did not return to sea again; he was put on the retired list on 23 January 1863. Bynoe died at his home, 440 Old Kent Road, London, on 13 November 1865. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Professionally, Bynoe was a ship's surgeon, but he was immortalized in geographical features and in the names of Australian plants and animals, notably the Acacia <i>Acacia bynoeana</i>, the Golden Whistler <i>Pachycephala melanura bynoei</i>, and the kangaroo <i>Halmaturus binoe</i>. Bynoe collected many natural history specimens; many still exist in museums. Of his birds and mammals, about twenty-five were new to science.<br>
