<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Coffin,  Albert Isaiah</span>  (1790/91&#150;1866), <span class="occ">medical botanist</span>, claimed to have been born in Ohio, USA, in 1798, but his death certificate suggests 1790 or 1791. Coffin's early life is obscure. According to his own account he received some formal medical instruction at an early age but had to withdraw from study because of an illness which orthodox physicians failed to cure. He recovered after being treated by a Native American woman who had called at his home. Coffin claimed to have been so impressed that he spent time among the Native American people learning about the herbs they used. Such &#145;foundation myths&#146; were common among practitioners of unorthodox medicine, especially in the United States. Coffin was in practice in Troy, New York, by 1829, but he left the United States for France in 1832 after a court case. In 1838 he came to Britain, advocating a system of medical botany similar to that popularized by Samuel Thomson in the USA. Coffin's key remedies were lobelia (an emetic) and cayenne pepper (for warmth).<br>
<br>Coffin began to be successful from the mid-1840s, especially in the north of England, where his medico-botanical societies attracted plebeian supporters also interested in temperance and Methodism. Adherents bought copies of his <span class="italic">Botanic Guide to Health</span> (1845) and purchased his recommended remedies, which he supplied from his headquarters in Manchester. Coffin attracted official attention in 1847 when one of his agents, Ellis Flitcroft of Bolton, was gaoled for one month for manslaughter and then released to popular rejoicing. From 1848 Coffin was also active in London, though until 1853 he was described as practising in Manchester, in partnership with Thomas Harle.<br>
<br>Coffin was said to be a large man, weighing 14 stone (196 pounds). He seems to have been a brash American salesman with a simple message that appealed to working people. He argued against &#145;medical mysteries&#146; and opposed the <span class="roman">Medical Act</span> of 1858 which increased the status of orthodox medicine. His many books and periodicals, some of which were regularly reprinted, included <span class="italic">Medical Botany</span> (1851), <span class="italic">A Treatise on Midwifery, and the Diseases of Women and Children</span> (1849), and his <span class="italic">Botanical Journal and Medical Reformer</span>, price 1<i>d</i>., which was issued in ten volumes between 1847 and 1861. In these works he advocated self-help and herbal remedies. According to Coffin, bodies, like steam engines, required heat, and women should not be corsetted, nor attended in childbirth by male doctors.<br>
<br>It was Coffin's custom to appoint assistants, with some of whom he later quarrelled. One of the best-known was John Skelton, a radical politician turned healer. John Boot, father of Jesse Boot, the founder of the pharmaceutical company, was a follower of Skelton. Some of Coffin's followers, and ex-followers, including Skelton, gained orthodox medical qualifications and, as in the USA, styled themselves &#145;eclectics&#146;&#151;taking the best from all medical systems. The later institutions of British herbalism, notably the National Institute of Medical Herbalists, can be traced back to Coffin.<br>
<br>Coffin died of cancer of the stomach on 1 August 1866 at 24 Montague Place, Russell Square, London, the address he shared with the patent medicine dealer John Morris Brooks. He was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. Coffin's obituary in John Skelton's <span class="italic">Eclectic Journal and Medical Free Press</span> claims that his &#145;name will be ever remembered wheresoever Medical Botany is known &hellip; and although he may have had some failings it is the duty of everyone to draw the veil of charity over them&#146;  (1.149).<br>
