<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sonntag,  Jacob</span>  (1905&#150;1984), <span class="occ">journal editor and translator</span>, was born on 15 April 1905 at Vijnita (Wiznitz), northern Bukovina, then a part of the Austro-Hungarian empire (and now in Ukraine), the eldest child (there were three younger brothers and one younger sister) of Ben-Zion Singer-Sonntag, a bookbinder, and his wife, Edel David. (As a young writer, Jacob Sonntag sometimes called himself Jacob Singer, after his grandfather.) Born to poverty, his family moved to Kosov, in eastern Galicia, where he attended the local elementary schools, and then, during the early stages of the First World War, moved to Innsbruck and then to Vienna, where he attended a local <i>Gymnasium</i> to the age of about sixteen. He had also received a traditional Jewish religious education in Orthodox <i>cheders</i>, but abandoned this outlook for secular pursuits in literature and philosophy. He also became a convinced Zionist, attending a <i>hachshara</i> (training in agriculture for intending migrants to Palestine). Here he met Berta (Batyah), daughter of Israel and Chaja Weinraub of Czernowitz, then in Romania, whom he married in Vienna in January 1927. During the 1920s he contributed prose and verse to German-language Jewish newspapers in Vienna and, in 1930, moved briefly to Palestine but returned to Vienna after six months. For the next five years he worked as a freelance journalist in Vienna, contributing mainly to Jewish newspapers and periodicals and also working as a foreign correspondent for Jewish newspapers in France and the United States. After the fascist coup in Austria in 1934, he moved to Czechoslovakia, where he worked as a freelance journalist for three years, first in Brno and then in Prague.<br>
<br>With the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Nazi regime, Sonntag was fortunate to escape to Britain (Berta's parents perished in the holocaust). He arrived in England in November 1938 among the first group of refugees who emigrated with the help of the Czech Trust Fund and the National Union of Journalists. After internment on the Isle of Man and spells of unemployment and menial work, he resumed work as a freelance writer and translator, chiefly for Jewish publications in Britain. He also edited <span class="italic">Zeitspiegel</span>, a small publication of the Austrian Centre, consisting of translations from the English press. As a survivor of the decimated Jewish communities of eastern Europe, Sonntag was acutely aware that Jewish literary culture and commentary could only be carried on if the seeds of the vanished Jewish civilization of Europe were somehow replanted, and flourished, in Britain. Berta Sonntag was active in the field of children's education and in 1941&#150;2 was honorary secretary of the refugee teachers association of the National Union of Teachers. After the Second World War, Britain contained one of the largest remaining Jewish communities in Europe, in a democratic society with a literate culture. Yet the Anglo-Jewish community was lamentably lacking in a continuing tradition of Jewish literature and commentary, containing few organs in which Jewish writers could feel at home or speak freely. Nor had Anglo-Jewry many close ties with any of the vigorous intellectual and political traditions of Jewry on the continent. It was this situation that Sonntag spent the rest of his life attempting to ameliorate. In 1947 he launched an illustrated monthly, <span class="italic">New Life</span>, intended to provide a platform for Jewish writers and artists who had survived the holocaust. This lasted for less than two years before it was unfortunately discontinued because of paper restrictions. He also edited two other short-lived publications, the <span class="italic">Jewish Literary Supplement</span> and the <span class="italic">Jewish Literary Quarterly</span>.<br>
<br>In spring 1953 Sonntag founded the <span class="italic">Jewish Quarterly</span>, the periodical with which his name is associated. It provided a distinguished forum for Anglo-Jewish writers and intellectuals who wished to emphasize the Jewish component of their outlook, or to comment on Jewish affairs. Many of the most notable Anglo-Jewish writers of the post-war decades published in the <span class="italic">Jewish Quarterly</span>, particularly younger authors who were increasingly concerned with their Jewish roots, among them such notables as Danny Abse, Brian Glanville, Wolf Mankowitz, Alexander Baron, Frederic Raphael, Jon Silkin, and Arnold Wesker (whose first published works appeared there). The <span class="italic">Jewish Quarterly</span> also featured vigorous commentary on key Jewish issues such as secular Jewish identity in Britain, the central role of Israel in contemporary Jewish affairs, and the persecution of Jews in the Soviet Union. Although ever aware of Jewish history and tradition, Sonntag was a liberal intellectual who was uncomfortable with the growth of Jewish religious fundamentalism and right-wing Israeli nationalism since the 1960s. Two anthologies of notable works from the <span class="italic">Quarterly</span> were published in his lifetime; these were <span class="italic">Caravan: A Jewish Quarterly Omnibus</span> and <span class="italic">Jewish Perspectives: 25 Years of Modern Jewish Writing</span> (1980). Sonntag edited the <span class="italic">Quarterly</span> almost single-handedly, always on a shoestring budget, and operating from his own home in north London. It was widely noted that for its range and quality the <span class="italic">Quarterly</span> was without equal in the English-speaking world. The Jewish Literary Trust Ltd was established in 1976 to fund the periodical, allowing it to be published without desperate financial worries. The <span class="italic">Quarterly</span> continued to be published after Sonntag's death.<br>
<br>Sonntag also published a number of translations from the Yiddish, in particular a narrative poem by Abraham Sutzkever, <span class="italic">Siberia</span> (1953), which appeared with original illustrations by Marc Chagall. He edited two anthologies of Jewish writing, much of which had not appeared in the <span class="italic">Quarterly</span>, namely <span class="italic">Jewish Writing Today</span> (1974) and <span class="italic">New Writing from Israel</span> (1980). He contributed several surveys of Yiddish literature to encyclopaedias of world literature, and organized many symposia on topics of Jewish interest. He was renowned for his absolute integrity and editorial independence, and was sometimes compared to the <i>maskilim</i> of nineteenth-century Europe who sparked the so-called Jewish enlightenment. Britain has not known another figure like Sonntag either before him or since his death. Jacob Sonntag died at 68 Worcester Crescent in north London on 27 June 1984.<br>
