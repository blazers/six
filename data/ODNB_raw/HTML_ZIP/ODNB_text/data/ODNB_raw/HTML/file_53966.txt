<span class="headword">Brus <span class="st"> [Bruce]</span>,  Robert (II)  de</span>, lord of Annandale  (<em>d.</em> 1194?), <span class="occ">baron</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3748/', "Robert (I) de Brus (d. 1142)")</script> and his wife, Agnes. Described as <i>iuvenis</i> (&#145;a youngster&#146;) on his seal and in one of his father's charters, he was probably born after <i>c</i>.1120. A late family chronicle claims that the younger Robert had already been given Annandale by his father when he was in David I's army at Northallerton in 1138, that he was taken prisoner by his father at the battle of the Standard, and handed over to King Stephen, who courteously gave him to his mother. Staying in his father's house, he complained that wheaten bread was unobtainable in Annandale, so his father gave him Hart and Hartness (co. Durham) for wheat growing. This pleasant fable is unreliable in every respect, and Robert may not have been at Northallerton and may have received his lands after the battle; Hartness he and his heirs held of the senior (Skelton) line of the family, but Annandale of the Scottish king. He was also assessed as having five knights' fees in Yorkshire, but these have not been identified. Edenhall in Cumbria, given by Henry II, was later held by him of Bruce of Skelton.<br>
<br>Robert (II) de Brus was one of those who sought unsuccessfully on behalf of David I and the empress to cajole the monks of Durham into electing William Cumin as bishop of Durham in 1141, but thereafter he is hard to trace in politics, Scottish or English. He was a frequent witness to charters of David I (<i>r</i>. 1124&#150;53) and Malcolm IV (<i>r</i>. 1153&#150;65), but was distant from William the Lion (<i>r</i>. 1165&#150;1214), witnessing only three of his charters; perhaps he had failed to support William's claims to the earldom of Northumberland in 1157. Before 1173 the Scottish king gave a charter at Lochmaben confirming the lordship of Annandale as held by Robert's father, but with exceptions which trimmed their extensive franchises; it was to be held for the service of ten knights, a figure not disclosed in earlier charters and high for Scotland. In 1173&#150;4 Brus supported Henry II against the young king and William the Lion.<br>
<br>In the 1140s Brus had welcomed Malachy at Annan, and granted the future saint's wish that a thief be pardoned; the following morning Malachy saw the thief on the gibbet and put a curse on Annan, where the river obligingly washed away part of the motte. Robert probably built the extensive motte and bailey at the new <i>caput</i> of Annandale, Lochmaben, whose cost may help to explain his borrowing of over &pound;237 from Aaron the Jew. He settled a long-running dispute with Ingram and Jocelyn, bishops of Glasgow, over the churches of Annandale, which had been given to Guisborough Priory, of which he was a careful patron (and where he was probably buried).<br>
<br>Robert (II) de Brus married Euphemia, niece of William, earl of Albemarle, who bore three sons, Robert, William, and Bernard, and a daughter, Agatha, who married Ralph, son of Ribald of Middleham. He was alive at the time of the pipe roll of 1193; but in that of 1194 both he and his heir occur, so he probably died in that year, on either 17 February or 26 August. His first son, <a name="cosubject_3750"></a><span class="headword">Robert (III)  de Brus</span>  (<em>d.</em> before 1191)<span class="occ"></span>, married an illegitimate daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29452/', "King William the Lion")</script> in 1183, and had died without surviving children by 1191, so that on his father's death Annandale and Hartness passed to the second son, <a name="cosubject_53966"></a><span class="headword">William  de Brus</span>, lord of Annandale  (<em>d.</em> 1211/12)<span class="occ"></span>, of whom almost nothing is known. The pipe rolls show him reluctant to pay King John's scutages, but making a part payment of &pound;25 in 1209, and he died on 16 July in 1211 or 1212, having witnessed one charter of King William and bought for Hartlepool a market and fair at a cost of 20 marks in 1201. He had married a Christina, who bore two sons; the younger, who was a hostage in King John's hands in 1213, was possibly called William de Brus, and the elder was <a name="cosubject_3751"></a><span class="headword">Robert (IV)  de Brus</span>, lord of Annandale  (<em>c.</em>1195&#150;1226<span class="mult">x</span>33)<span class="occ"></span>. He was of age in 1215, when King John made him minor conciliatory grants on the eve of, and soon after, conceding <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>. Unlike his distant cousin Peter de Brus, lord of Skelton, he played no known part in the civil and Anglo-Scottish wars of 1215&#150;17, though Alexander II would surely have demanded his knight-service. He attested the marriage settlement of that king at York in 1221 and owed scutage until 1226, but is not recorded thereafter. His marriage to Isabel, second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49365/', "David, earl of Huntingdon")</script>, which annals once attributed to John Fordun placed before Earl David's death in 1219, was probably not long before, and there is no authority for the often repeated claim that his son was born in 1210. This marriage would have given him some lands in the south which perhaps kept him in England. Robert (IV)'s death has been placed wrongly in 1245: his fief of Hart was in his kinsman's wardship when Richard Poor was bishop of Durham (1228&#150;37), and the bishop's grant of privileges to the borough of Hartlepool in September 1230 may place the wardship that early; indeed there is no evidence that he was alive after 1226, and he was certainly dead by March 1234. He died on 21 April or 26 August, between 1226 and 1233, and was buried at Guisborough Priory. Isabel died in 1251 and was buried at Sawtry Abbey in Huntingdonshire. They had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3752/', "Robert (V) de Brus")</script>.<br>
