<span class="headword">O'Keeffe,  Robert</span>  (1814&#150;1881), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born on 11 April 1814 in Green Street, Callan, co. Kilkenny, the posthumous son of Robert O'Keeffe, grocer and ironmonger, and his wife, Eleanor Fennelly. He was educated at Callan, at St Kieran's College, Kilkenny (1831&#150;4), and at St Patrick's College, Maynooth, co. Kildare (1834&#150;40), where he was admitted to postgraduate studies in the Dunboyne Establishment. In 1840 he was ordained priest and appointed to St Kieran's College, where he was teacher and administrator until 1849. From 1849 to 1860 he served as curate at Ballyragget, co. Kilkenny, and in the latter year became parish priest of Rathdowney, Queen's county, and one of the vicars forane of the diocese. In January 1863 he became parish priest of his native Callan.<br>
<br>O'Keeffe mobilized opinion and resources in Callan in support of a number of projects including the devotional and charitable Society of St Vincent de Paul, but mainly in the field of education. The Christian Brothers opened their doors to the schoolgoing boys of Callan in September 1868 in substantial new premises provided through the voluntary effort and subscriptions of townspeople under O'Keeffe's direction. Pupils flocked to the brothers, leaving only a handful on the rolls in the boys' national school, of which O'Keeffe was <i>ex officio</i> manager. He was soon busily revitalizing the national school to compete with the Christian Brothers, and it reopened in January 1869 as Callan Academy. It had a board of management, a former model school headmaster as principal, and a wide range of subjects, and was affiliated to the Department of Science and Art, South Kensington. His promotion of the academy brought O'Keeffe into bitter conflict with his curates and the bishop, Edward Walsh. His offence was that by advancing an alternative to the conventional model of governance and curriculum in Irish Catholic schools he had broken ranks on one of the most contentious issues in the contemporary church&#150;state conflict.<br>
<br>Between 1869 and 1875 O'Keeffe fought a series of civil actions for libel against the curates and Bishop Walsh, and eventually against Cardinal Cullen, who in 1871 had been given plenary papal authority to address the Callan problem. O'Keeffe was successful in most of these cases, but ultimately he was routed. For contravening the canonical prohibition against a cleric taking a fellow cleric before a civil court, he was first suspended and then, in November 1871, removed from office. He refused to yield up his parish church, which was thereupon placed under interdict by Cullen. Already the townspeople were bitterly divided between opponents and supporters of O'Keeffe, and riots and affrays were to be a feature of life in Callan for a number of years. On foot of the bishop's certification that he was no longer parish priest, O'Keeffe was removed by the relevant government bodies from his positions as school manager and workhouse chaplain. He appealed to British opinion and initially received substantial financial support; his case was raised in both houses of parliament during 1872. The title of his book <span class="italic">Ultramontanism v. Civil and Religious Liberty</span> (1874) signified an appeal to liberal and protestant sensibilities. By late 1875, however, it was clear that neither government nor parliament, courts, or British liberal opinion would prevent the deployment of canon law in Ireland against one who had freely submitted to it.<br>
<br>Comprehensively defeated and in dire financial straits, O'Keeffe held out until 1879, when he signed an unqualified apology and was granted a small pension. Thereafter he lived quietly with relatives near Thomastown, co. Kilkenny, until his death on 1 February 1881. His funeral mass in Thomastown was attended by a large number of priests and he was buried in his family's grave in Newtown cemetery, co. Kilkenny. The dramatic events in Callan with which he is identified have inspired two works of fiction: Francis MacManus, <span class="italic">The Greatest of these</span> (1943), and Thomas Kilroy, <span class="italic">The Big Chapel</span> (1971).<br>
