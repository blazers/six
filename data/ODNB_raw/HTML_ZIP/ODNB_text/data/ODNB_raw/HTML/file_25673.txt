<span class="headword">Skevington <span class="st"> [Skeffington; <em>formerly </em>Pace]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1533), <span class="occ">abbot of Beaulieu and bishop of Bangor</span>, was the son of John Pace of Leicestershire and Margaret, daughter and heir of William Cobley; he is reputed to have been born at Skeffington, Leicestershire, the seat of the family of that name, and to have been related to Richard Pace, dean of St Paul's and Henry VIII's secretary. He entered the Cistercian abbey of Merevale, Warwickshire, and was educated there and at the Cistercian college of St Bernard, Oxford, to which he bequeathed &pound;20 in his will. He took a new name when entering religion&#151;Skevington, or Skeffington, from his supposed birthplace, where the church window bore the blazon of his arms. He became abbot of Waverley, Surrey, possibly in 1478, and was still there in 1500, when he was dispensed to hold a benefice <i>in commendam</i>. By 1508 he had become abbot of Beaulieu, Hampshire. The last of the pre-Reformation bishops of Bangor, he was papally provided to the see on 23 February 1509 and, like all his predecessors since 1436, he was in religious orders. He was given licence to retain his abbey of Beaulieu <i>in commendam</i>. He was consecrated at Lambeth on 17 June 1509 and had his spiritualities restored to him on the 20th.<br>
<br>Skevington seems to have spent more of his time in the congenial surroundings of his Hampshire abbey than in his remote north Wales diocese. One of his enemies reported to Thomas Cromwell, with no little exaggeration, that he was the &#145;richest monk in England&#146; and that he had not set foot for fourteen years in his diocese, which he had set to farm to his vicar-general, William Glyn  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 4/3, no. 5533). Some of his Bangor registers survive, giving details of fifty-eight appointments, about one-third of them to clerics outside the diocese. Among them were John Baddesley, abbot of Merevale, and Richard Pace. During his episcopate Bangor was much troubled by disagreements between Sir Richard Bulkeley and Skevington's confidant, William Glyn, chancellor of Bangor and archdeacon of Anglesey. They came to a head in 1524, when Glyn was appointed archdeacon in preference to Wolsey's nominee, Thomas Runcorn, and again in 1529, when there was conflict between Edward Johns (Wolsey's representative) and Glyn.<br>
<br>In spite of prolonged absence from Bangor, Skevington was responsible for extensive building work there&#151;a mark of contrition for past neglect of his church and see, one hostile commentator suggested. In 1529 he rebuilt the previously grass-grown nave, so the priest&#150;poet, Dafydd Trefor, averred; and, according to an inscription over the tower doorway, built the tower and the church (&#145;hoc campanile et ecclesia fieri fecit&#146;) in 1533. Trefor maintained that the work cost this &#145;willing-hearted bishop&#146; a &#145;goodly chestful of gold&#146; and expressed the wish that he should live as long as St Deiniol and crown his efforts by placing bells high in the steeple  (Williams, <span class="italic">Welsh Church</span>, 310). He is also credited with an inscription over the entrance to the episcopal palace to the effect that &#145;Thomas Skevington ep'us Bangor fecit&#146;, suggesting that he completed the rebuilding begun by Bishop Henry Deane (1496&#150;1500). When Skevington died, on 16 or 17 August 1533, at Beaulieu, he left a will directing that the steeple and loft of the cathedral at Bangor be completed and four bells hung there. He was buried later that month at Beaulieu, but his heart was placed before the picture of St Deiniol on the north wall of his cathedral.<br>
