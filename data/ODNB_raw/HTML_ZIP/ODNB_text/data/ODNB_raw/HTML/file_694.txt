<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Arnott,  Neil</span>  (1788&#150;1874), <span class="occ">physician and public health reformer</span>, the son of William Arnott, a manufacturer and farmer, and his wife, Ann Maclean, was born at Arbroath in Forfarshire, Scotland, on 15 May 1788. A Roman Catholic by upbringing, he was educated by his mother, at the parish school of Lunan, and at Aberdeen grammar school, which he went to in November 1798. In 1801 he went to Marischal College, Aberdeen, where he graduated MA in 1805, and began to study medicine. He supported himself partly by working as a shop assistant to a chemist. After moving to St George's Hospital, London, in September 1806, Arnott obtained an appointment as surgeon in the East India Company and undertook two trips to China. On his return to London in 1811 he established himself in lucrative private practice in Hunter Street, Brunswick Square. He was awarded his MD by Marischal College in 1814, and had obtained the diploma of the Royal College of Surgeons the previous year. Arnott's facility with languages gained him many foreign patients and he was also sometime physician to the French and Spanish embassies.<br>
<br>Attaching himself to progressive Benthamite circles in London, Arnott quickly matured into a versatile lecturer, author, and inventor. In 1827 he published his <span class="italic">Elements of Physics</span>, which had gone through six editions by 1865 and which was translated into every major European language. In 1832 he produced the prototype of a waterbed, intended to reduce the pain experienced by elderly, non-ambulant patients. Six years later he completed his essay <span class="italic">Warming and Ventilating</span> (1838), which described the principles underlying the Arnott stove, for which he subsequently received the Royal Society's Rumford medal in 1854. Arnott was one of the founders of the University of London in 1836 and an original member of the senate. He was appointed physician-extraordinary to Queen Victoria in 1837 and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1838. Arnott retired from private practice in 1855. A year later he married Marianne Knight (<i>d</i>. 1876), a widow, and daughter of G. H. Holley of Blickling, Norfolk; there were no children.<br>
<br>Between the 1820s and the mid-1850s Arnott was intimately involved in the technical and ideological reconstruction of the theory and practice of public health. He played an important role in bringing the youthful Edwin Chadwick into contact with Jeremy Bentham; six years later he successfully pressed the claims of William Farr as the only suitably qualified candidate for the position of compiler of abstracts at the newly established office of the registrar-general. Arnott introduced Chadwick to the complexities and political deployment of social and medical statistics. In 1838 Chadwick chose Arnott, together with Thomas Southwood Smith and James Kay, to undertake a series of investigations for the poor-law commission into the prevalence of fever in London. These co-authored reports proved seminal, not least since they marked the &#145;first occasion on which the government had formally employed fully-qualified medical men to gather factual information as a prelude to possible parliamentary action&#146;  (Flinn, 44). They also paved the way for Chadwick's conversion of important sections of medical and professional opinion to the view that filth and odour were inextricably associated with and prime causal factors in the generation of disease and death. Arnott's views on the deleterious impact of dust whipped up from the surface of non-macadamized roads and the alleged weakness of W. P. Alison's insistence that fever was more likely to be precipitated by low wages than miasmatic factors were fully incorporated into Chadwick's seminal text.<br>
<br>In the early 1840s Arnott drew on his experience of Asian conditions to canvass a malarial variant of the filth-based theory of infection. Playing down the primacy of regular work and adequate food and heating to the prevention of fever, he emphasized the centrality of environmental intervention. Convinced that it was necessary to stimulate a moral, temperate, and thrift-based regeneration among the urban working class, Arnott travelled to Edinburgh and Glasgow to report on a savage epidemic of typhus. He concluded that living conditions rather than economic distress had been predominantly responsible for the severity of the outbreak. Observations of slum life in the same cities encouraged Chadwick and Arnott to formulate a blueprint for the profitable sale of liquid manure to local farmers. According to this plan, town waste would boost agricultural productivity, thereby reducing the price of food for the ever-expanding urban proportion of the national population. In 1844 Arnott once again bolstered the Chadwickian account of disease transmission by providing the health of towns commission with a persuasive synopsis of interactions between inadequate ventilation and miasmatically determined infection.<br>
<br>Arnott also became a provisional director of Chadwick's ill-fated Towns Improvement Company, which sought to supply nothing less than an &#145;increased and well-distributed supply of pure water, a complete system of house and street drainage, the removal of middens, cesspools, and the accumulations of decomposing filth and other organic matter, and the purification of rivers&#146;  (Finer, 241). When this Utopian project failed to survive the company's financial collapse in 1846, Arnott continued to support the sanitarian cause as a member of the recently reconstituted metropolitan commission of sewers.<br>
<br>In 1852 Chadwick proposed his friend's name as governmental co-investigator of the origins of a serious epidemic of typhoid in Croydon, a town which had made extensive use of the controversial and undertested pipe-drain and sewer system. Refusing to do what was expected of him, Arnott informed Chadwick that he must &#145;speak of faults and failures in works that you had hoped to be deemed perfect&#146;  (Lewis, 316). In the aftermath of the Croydon fiasco, Chadwick repeatedly and unsuccessfully sought to revise or rewrite Arnott's critique. But the rancour appears to have been short-lived, and, as Arnott gradually reduced his commitment to the sanitary cause, Chadwick took every opportunity to praise his friend's work in the field of ventilation theory. For his part Arnott refused to acknowledge that research by John Snow and William Budd had in any way undermined the filth-based theory of infection. Appointed to the committee of scientific inquiries, which reported on the traumatic cholera epidemic of 1853&#150;4, Arnott rejected statistical evidence which appeared to point to the specificity of disease, and reiterated a belief in the causal role of environmental and meteorological precipitants.<br>
<br>During the 1860s Arnott, weakened by ill health, returned to themes originally raised in his <span class="italic">Elements of Physics</span>. Depicting the &#145;human race as one great intellectual being&#146;  (Arnott, 126), he nevertheless approached social and economic development from an exclusively Anglo-centric, if not quasi-racist, perspective. Idealizing self-made men who had profited from unprecedentedly rapid upward social mobility during the peak period of industrialization, Arnott chauvinistically commended large and impersonal systems of free trade and imperialism. North American and Chinese agriculturalists, he argued, had been created explicitly in order to provide Britons with cotton and tea, though even in the &#145;highest civilization yet attained&#146; social perfection had proven elusive. Good health and happiness were unevenly distributed between the upper, middle, and lower classes; unrepentantly Benthamite, Arnott contended that it was only through &#145;yet further refinement of reason, within an inclusive system of national education&#146;, that there could be a maximization of psychological well-being. At an extreme he believed that &#145;individuals who learn little and badly are left to act chiefly from the low propensities of the mere animal, and so continue to resemble the animal&#146;  (Arnott, 9).<br>
<br>After the completion of a pamphlet on educational reform in 1869, Arnott suffered a fall which irreparably damaged his physical and mental health. He died at his home, 2 Cumberland Terrace, Regent's Park, London, on 2 March 1874, and was buried in Dean cemetery, Edinburgh. His wife survived him by two years. During his lifetime Arnott had been widely admired as an accessible and reliable popularizer and synthesizer of scientific knowledge. It is now clear that his most significant contribution was as part-shaper and highly effective disseminator of the Chadwickian or miasmatic theory of disease. The Neil Arnott prize in natural philosophy was later instituted at the University of Aberdeen, and a Neil Arnott studentship for postgraduate studies was established at the University of London.<br>
