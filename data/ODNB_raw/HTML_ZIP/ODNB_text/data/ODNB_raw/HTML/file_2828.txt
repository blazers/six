<span class="headword">Bond,  John Linnell</span>  (1764&#150;1837), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 14 September 1764. Of his parents nothing is known. Though described as having been taught architectural drawing by James Malton, it is more probable that it was from Thomas Malton junior that he received instruction, for when exhibiting his first design, for the inside of a banqueting room, at the Royal Academy in 1782, his address was given as Mr Malton's, Carlisle Street, Soho. In the same year Thomas Malton junior exhibited a design for the front of a banqueting house, when his address was given as 8 Carlisle Street, Soho. Bond entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1783, aged nineteen, and won a silver medal in 1784, and a gold medal in 1786 with a design for a mausoleum. His architectural drawings and designs, which he continued to exhibit at the Royal Academy until 1814, included views of the temples of Jupiter and Minerva, as well as Tintern Abbey, Raglan Castle, and other Gothic ruins. His varied designs included an anatomical theatre for J. Brooks in Blenheim (now Ramillies) Street, a cast-iron bridge over the Thames near the Adelphi at the Strand (eventually built by John Rennie to his own designs), a naval obelisk, an altar, an Egyptian hall, a &#145;Gothic villa&#146; and several villas at Wimbledon, Bushey, and in Kent. Of his exhibited designs, those which include further reference to construction include &#145;a room erected at Southampton Castle for the Marquis of Lansdowne after the manner of the Moorish architecture at Granada&#146;  (Papworth, 1.108), and a shop-front &#145;lately erected&#146; to Messrs Tatham and Bailey's premises, 13&#150;14 Mount Street, Grosvenor Square, London. His most important work appears to have been that commissioned by Sir Gerard Noel MP, for whom Bond built the nucleus of Exton Hall, Rutland (1811), and the neo-classical Stamford Hotel at Stamford, Lincolnshire (<i>c</i>.1810&#150;1829).<br>
<br>In 1818 Bond travelled to Italy and Greece; he returned in 1821, after which date he appears to have ceased practising as an architect, although he continued to contribute several papers on architectural subjects to the <span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span>. In 1833 he exhibited at the Society (later Royal Society) of British Artists, Suffolk Street, <span class="italic">The interior of the Temple of Jupiter at Olympia, designed from the description of it in the 5th book of Pausanias</span>, and in 1834 <span class="italic">The interior of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, designed from the description of it in the 10th book of Pausanias</span>, together with <span class="italic">The interior of the Parthenon at Athens, attempted to be restored from the description of it in the 1st book of Pausanias, in Pliny, and in other authors</span>  (Johnson, 1.47). A noted classical scholar, William Gifford, editor of the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, gave Bond a copy of his translation of Juvenal for comment. It was suggested by a contemporary that:<blockquote>his retired habits and the modesty of his disposition rendered him averse to appear before his public, and that he preferred to confine his labours to the gratification and service of the few friends who had discernment enough to appreciate his merits. (Colvin, <span class="italic">Archs</span>., 136)</blockquote>He died, apparently unmarried, at his home, 87 Newman Street, London, on 6 November 1837, leaving in manuscript a translation of Vitruvius on which he had worked for more than twenty years.<br>
