<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Aske,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1500&#150;1537), <span class="occ">lawyer and rebel</span>, was the third son of Sir Robert Aske (<i>d</i>. 1529), landowner, of Aughton, near Selby, Yorkshire, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of John Clifford, ninth Baron Clifford, and his wife, Margaret. His elder brother John Aske (<i>b</i>. 1498/9, <i>d</i>. after 1546) was heir to the family property. The family was reasonably well-connected: he was a cousin of Henry Clifford, first earl of Cumberland, whose brother-in-law was Henry Percy, sixth earl of Northumberland. Aske's brother Christopher Aske (<i>d</i>. 1538) was Cumberland's steward.<br>
<br>Aske was probably sent to Gray's Inn to study common law. He was subsequently an attorney and fellow of the inn. He was Northumberland's secretary in the late 1520s and can be seen disbursing small sums of money on his behalf in 1527. Thereafter he seems to have made his living as a lawyer. He appears on several occasions as counsel on Star Chamber bills, and it is significant that he stumbled into the Lincolnshire rebellion while travelling to Westminster for the beginning of the law term. He never achieved sufficient local standing to be appointed JP but this may reflect his youth. There is no sign that he ever married. He inherited several small estates in Hampshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire, including Bubwith, between Aughton and the Percy estate at Wressle.<br>
<br>Aske left Yorkshire for Lincolnshire on 4 October 1536, ignorant, when he set out, of the rising at Louth in that county. The rebellion was triggered by the activities of an episcopal commission in Lincolnshire to inquire into the state of the local clergy, but which, it was feared, was instructed to confiscate church goods. The Louth commons were proud of their church and the arrival of the commissioner there on 2 October caused disorder to break out, which escalated rapidly throughout the northern part of the county. Aske was taken and sworn by a band of commons at Sawcliff on the morning of 5 October and assisted them in raising other areas of north Lincolnshire. He then rode deeper into the county on their behalf to make contact with the Louth rebels under another lawyer, Thomas Moigne, at Hamilton Hill near Market Rasen before riding back to his own band of rebels to report on what he had seen. They then allowed him to cross over the Humber back into Yorkshire. There he told the commons of the Marshland not to rise until they heard the bells of Howden ring and the commons of Howden not to rise until they heard the bells of Marshland, so either pacifying both districts or making a rising contingent on his instruction. Having then gone back to Aughton, Aske decided to return to Lincoln on 7 October in expectation that the king's answer to the Lincolnshire rebels would be read the following day, but was advised when he got there to leave the town for his own safety, as he was regarded in Lincolnshire as a renegade. He travelled back into Yorkshire, probably by way of Burton upon Stather, and, on his own account, went into hiding (probably at Whitgift).<br>
<br>The Marshland rose in rebellion on 10 October after Sir Brian Hastings tried to muster troops to be deployed in the repression of Lincolnshire. Aske threw in his lot with the rebels and, the following day, put his name to a proclamation calling out a further area in which he called himself the &#145;chief captain of the Marshland, the Isle and Howdenshire&#146;  (Dodds and Dodds, 1.148). In the following days he gathered the commons about him at a series of musters and entered York without a siege on 16 October with about 10,000 men. Aske issued a proclamation that laid out the aims of the rebellion:<blockquote>For thys pylgrymage we have taken hyt for the presevacyon of Crystes churche, of thys realme of England, the kynge our soverayne lorde, the nobylytie and comyns of the same, and to the entent to macke petycion to the kinges highnes for the reformacyon of that whyche is amysse within thys hys realme. (Fletcher and MacCulloch, 26)</blockquote>There are no signs that Aske wished to align himself with the commons' rising when he went into Lincolnshire, and he professed to disbelieve the rumours of the impending confiscation of church goods which prompted that rebellion. He was drawn back to Lincoln in the expectation of hearing the king's answer to the letter sent him by the Louth rebels on 3 October. His curiosity is evident: but he declared himself for the commons and emerged as one of their leaders only after he had seen the articles sent by the Lincolnshire gentry to the king from Lincoln on 9 October. Having read these and found them to his taste, he set out to create an East Riding branch of the Lincolnshire movement, adopting the Lincoln articles as his own manifesto and focusing an existing disturbance of the commons upon him. The reports of the conversation he had with some emissaries of Lincolnshire on 13 October make it clear that he regarded his actions as extending the activities and agenda of the Lincolnshire rebels. It was, for instance, a breviate of the Lincolnshire articles that Aske attached to his request to be allowed a free passage through York. It was only after the disintegration of the Lincolnshire revolt that Aske wrote his own oath, gave the movement the title of the Pilgrimage of Grace, and shifted it from the broad commonwealth concerns of the Lincoln articles to the critique of Cromwell's religious policies contained in his oath.<br>
<br>From York Aske advanced to Pontefract Castle, Yorkshire, apparently against the advice of other leaders of the commons, and took the castle after a short siege on 20 October. Among those taking refuge in the castle were its captain, Thomas Darcy, Baron Darcy, Edward Lee, archbishop of York, Thomas Magnus, archdeacon of the East Riding of Yorkshire, and a number of Yorkshire gentry. While he may have envisaged sharing power with them, it is fairly plain that they cold-shouldered him, probably because he was critical of the nobility. From Pontefract Aske called the gentry leaders of the other sectors of the commons' revolt to him&#151;men such as Robert Bowes and Sir Thomas Percy, all of them involuntary captains of the commons&#151;so that by about 24 October a sizeable force of 20,000&#150;30,000 or more men were confronting a much smaller royal army under Thomas Howard, third duke of Norfolk, and George Talbot, fourth earl of Shrewsbury, among others camped on the south side of the River Don at Doncaster. There are signs that Aske was frozen out of the leadership of the pilgrimage: when negotiations took place with Norfolk on 26&#150;27 October, Aske was excluded; and the conclusion of the discussions, that both armies should disband while Sir Ralph Ellerker and Robert Bowes travelled to the king, destroyed his power base among the commons.<br>
<br>It is clear that Aske and Darcy came to co-operate more fully during November, if only for their own protection against Henry, and it seems that Aske took the initiative of drawing up the articles made at the Pontefract conference held on 3 December. (He also convened the parallel gathering of the clergy modelled on a convocation.) The Pontefract articles were presented to Norfolk at Doncaster on 4 December. He conceded both a pardon and a parliament to be held at York without considering the articles. After this the pilgrimage formally disbanded, with Aske leading the other captains in pulling off their badges.<br>
<br>There are indications that the commons were reluctant to agree to the Doncaster settlement. Aske accepted the king's invitation to go to court over Christmas 1536 where he advised Henry on the future government of the north. Back in Yorkshire, he found that his standing was diminished by his contact with Henry, and that the settlement had been further undermined by the king's decision to restart the collection of the clerical tenth and the circulation of his inflammatory printed answer to the Yorkshire rebels (written in early November). While Aske argued by both speech and letter for the king's good faith, scepticism among the commons and the actions of a renegade gentleman, Sir Francis Bigod, led to a new rising in the East Riding in January 1537. With further violence in Cumberland during February the agreement at Doncaster progressively became a dead letter and none of the concessions made by Norfolk was ever implemented although the pardon was honoured.<br>
<br>Aske travelled through the north in Norfolk's entourage in March 1537. On the 24th he set out to London with a letter of commendation from Norfolk to the king and was arrested there, together with Darcy and Sir Robert Constable, on contrived charges of renewed conspiracy after the pardon, on 7 April. He was interrogated, tried, and executed at York by being hanged from a chain on 12 July.<br>
<br>Any account of Aske's activities must be based on a small number of sources, none of which is entirely satisfactory. He wrote&#151;apparently for Henry's scrutiny&#151;a self-justificatory memoir of his role in the pilgrimage. There are also some of the answers to the interrogatories put to him while he was imprisoned and a few letters written while he was grand captain. From these limited materials his attitudes and motivations have to be deduced. How he is understood must turn, in large measure, on an overall assessment of whether the pilgrimage was a gentry conspiracy or a rising of the commons. Several interpretations of Aske's role have been advanced. M. H. and R. Dodds gave him an almost saintly status but did not probe too deeply into his motives. Geoffrey Elton and others have seen him as a linkman between conspiracies in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, the first going off at half cock and collapsing before the parallel revolt in Yorkshire had gathered momentum. The most recent interpretations see the pilgrimage as a revolt of the commons and view Aske as being fundamentally an opportunist, taking advantage of a rebellion not of his making.<br>
<br>Aske exploited the Lincolnshire revolt to press his own political point of view. He did not create the risings of October 1536: the very title of his memoir, &#145;The manner of the taking of Robert Aske&#146;, shows how he believed that he had gone through the same experience of capture and coercion as the other northern gentry in 1536. But where most gentry tried to restrain the commons and to divert them into essentially harmless timewasting activities such as mustering and petitioning, Aske adopted a forward strategy and exploited their numbers to place pressure on the king. He admitted while under interrogation that he had been willing to fight the king if Henry had not conceded the grievances expressed in the pilgrims' petition. It is less clear how tender he was to the predicament of the smaller dissolved monasteries. Aske wrote eloquently in their defence, and a number of monasteries were reoccupied during the Yorkshire pilgrimage; but while he issued an order on behalf of the disposed monasteries, it seems likely that their reoccupation was the result of spontaneous acts by the commons. There can be no doubt that in the autumn of 1536 he was able to draw upon a vein of popular revulsion at the direction of Henry's policies. He had no hesitation in offering the commons leadership and organization, referring to them on one occasion as &#145;my people&#146;. He made a mistaken calculation in early December, agreeing to disband the pilgrimage in return for the promise of a parliament in which he, and other conservatives, surely intended to repeal the legislation of the Reformation Parliament. It may be argued that it was the failure of the pilgrimage to press home its advantage which allowed Henry to proceed with the incremental reformation of the last years of his reign.<br>
