<span class="headword">Baldwin, Sir  Timothy</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1619, <em>d.</em> 1696), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was baptized at Burwarton, Shropshire, on 28 September 1619, the second son of Charles Baldwin (1598&#150;1675) of Elsich, Shropshire, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1669), daughter and coheir of Francis Holland of Burwarton and widow of Robert Lutley. He matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, on 6 March 1635, graduating BA on 17 October 1638. He was elected a fellow of All Souls College the following year and retained his fellowship until 1661. He gained a BCL on 26 June 1641, and in 1647 he was appointed sinecure rector of Llandrillo-yn-Rhos, Denbighshire. After initially losing his fellowship during the parliamentary visitation of the university in 1648, he retained it by dint, according to Wood, of paying judicious attention to Thomas Kelsey, deputy governor of the city of Oxford, and plying his wife with presents. He gained a DCL on 6 December 1652.<br>
<br>In 1654 Baldwin published <span class="italic">The privileges of an ambassador, written by way of a letter to a friend who desired his opinion concerning the Portugal ambassador</span>, which deals with the manslaughter charge against Don Pantaleone, the brother of the Portuguese ambassador. In 1655 he was reported by Wood to be one of a number of royalists who were encouraging an Oxford apothecary to sell coffee publicly near to All Souls. In 1656 he translated into Latin and published Lord Herbert of Cherbury's <span class="italic">History of the Expedition to Rh&eacute; in 1627</span>. On 24 January 1660 Baldwin was admitted to Doctors' Commons and on 21 June 1660 he became principal of Hart Hall, Oxford. On 31 July 1660 he was named one of the royal commissioners to visit the university. In 1663 he edited and published Richard Zouch's <span class="italic">The Jurisdiction of the Admiralty of England</span>. Baldwin resigned his principal's office in 1663, the same year he was appointed chancellor of the diocese of Hereford and Worcester. In 1667 he became high steward of Leominster. At some point in or after 1668 he married Ellen, daughter of Sir William Owen of Condover, Shropshire, the widow of Sir George Norton (<i>d</i>. 1668) of Abbotsleigh, Somerset. On 29 June 1670 he was made a master in chancery, and knighted on 10 July following.<br>
<br>Baldwin resigned his mastership in 1682. This may have been because of ill health, for he made his will, &#145;languishing and weak in body&#146;  (will, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/436, sig. 24), on 1 May 1685. By the time he came to make his will he had married again, his second wife being Mary (1630&#150;1702), daughter of Gerard Skrymsher of Aqualate, Staffordshire, the widow of Nicholas Acton (<i>d</i>. 1664) of Bockleton, Worcestershire. In 1685 he was replaced as steward of Leominster, but returned to the post in 1688. Although he may have relinquished it to his nephew Charles Baldwin in 1691, Luttrell thought Baldwin was in possession of it until his death, mentioning his successor in an entry dated 4 August 1696. The main recipient of his will was his nephew Charles Baldwin (son of his brother, Sir Samuel), who had married Elizabeth, the daughter of his second wife, Mary, and her first husband, Nicholas Acton.<br>
