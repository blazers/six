<span class="headword">Wakefield <span class="st"> [Wakefeld]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1575), <span class="occ">Hebraist</span>, was born at Pontefract, Yorkshire. His brother was the renowned Hebrew scholar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28410/', "Robert Wakefield")</script>. In a marginal note in one of the books in his library he records that he was twice married and that he fathered nine children, but he does not name his wives. He was educated at Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1523. He is presumed to be the Wakefield granted leave of absence with pay from St John's College by John Fisher in 1523 so that he could continue his studies abroad. Writing to the master of St John's, Fisher expresses the hope that by going &#145;beyond the sea&#146; Wakefield would become &#145;the more expolite and perfect in the tongue of Hebrew&#146; and on his return would be able &#145;to perfect others in the same learning and do honour both to your college and to the whole realm&#146;  (Baker, 1.358). Of his subsequent career nothing is known until he was elected to the newly created regius chair of Hebrew on 9 November 1540, which carried with it membership of Trinity College. He was buried at Chesterton, near Cambridge, on 24 April 1575. His second wife, also buried at Chesterton, predeceased him in December 1570.<br>
<br>Wakefield held the endowed chair in name but not in practice until his death. Though others were appointed to teach Hebrew between 1549 and 1553, and again between 1569 and 1575, his competence as a linguist was not in doubt. It is probable that he was disqualified from teaching because of his adherence to Roman Catholicism. His place was taken by a succession of religious refugees from the continent, notably Paul Fagius, Immanuel Tremellius, Anthony Chevallier, and Philip Bignon. However, there is little direct proof of his knowledge of Hebrew, for as far as is known he published nothing. His one extant work is an examination of phrases in the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> which have an obvious Hebrew background: <span class="italic">Locutiones seu phrases in novo testamento, quae videntur secundum proprietates linguae Hebraeae</span>. Dated 1544, it is dedicated to Henry VIII and preserved in manuscript in the British Library. The only other clue to his Hebrew scholarship is to be found in the marginalia of the books he inherited from his brother Robert (<i>d</i>. 1537), some of which are now in Lambeth Palace Library. His copy of Felix Pratensis's Latin psalter, a translation from the Hebrew original, is heavily annotated. In the margin of Sebastian Muenster's Hebrew version of the gospel of <span class="roman">Matthew</span>, he identifies the source of the translator's note on a particular word as David Kimchi's <span class="italic">Book of Roots</span>. While Reuchlin's <span class="italic">De arte cabbalistica</span> was also on his shelves, it is not as well-thumbed as the Hebrew version of <span class="italic">The Book of Joseph Ben Gorion</span>. His close perusal of the first three chapters of this latter work indicate considerable competence in post-biblical Hebrew and familiarity with the relevant texts. It would appear that Wakefield's Hebrew books were no mere ornaments. They were read and studied by one who was able to appreciate their contents.<br>
