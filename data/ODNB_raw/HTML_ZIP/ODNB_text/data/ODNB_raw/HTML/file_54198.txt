<span class="headword">Rees,  John Rawlings</span>  (1890&#150;1969), <span class="occ">psychiatrist</span>, was born on 25 June 1890 at 9 The Crescent, King Street, Leicester, the fourth of seven children of Robert Montgomery Rees, a Wesleyan Methodist minister, and his wife, Catherine Millar Tait. A secure childhood in a religious household led Rees to consider becoming a missionary but instead he trained in medicine. Rees was educated at Leeds and Bradford grammar schools, King's College, Cambridge, and the London Hospital, qualifying LRCP, MRCS, in 1914, and MB BChir in 1915. At the outset of war he joined the Friends' Ambulance Unit and saw immediate service in France for which he was awarded the 1914 medal. He transferred to the Royal Army Medical Corps and served at the Somme where he saw soldiers executed for desertion having, in his opinion, suffered nervous breakdown. Later he served in Mesopotamia and India and wrote that he grew up emotionally through his military experience which had also prepared him for his career in army psychiatry in the Second World War, when he saw to it that psychiatric casualties were appropriately diagnosed and properly treated.<br>
<br>Though attracted to public health (he was awarded the DPH by the University of Cambridge in 1920), chance brought Rees to psychological medicine by meeting Hugh Crichton-Miller, a pioneer psychotherapist, founder of Bowden House, a clinic for the early treatment of psychiatric disorder, and later the founder of the Tavistock Clinic. At Bowden House he met Dr Mary (Molly) Isabel (1887&#150;1954), daughter of Charles Robert Hemmingway, a railway contractor. They married on 15 December 1921, and later had one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1932 Crichton-Miller abruptly resigned from the Tavistock Clinic, hurt by criticism of his methods and was succeeded by Rees as director. Under Rees's directorship much energy was liberated; he recruited talented therapists and by 1939 the Tavistock was the major centre of psychodynamic psychiatry in the United Kingdom. Training in psychiatric social work and child guidance work was pioneered there. Rees's own analysis was with Maurice Nicoll but he did not join the British Psychoanalytic Society.<br>
<br>Rees, in contrast to Crichton-Miller, who was an aristocrat in temperament, was a much more natural democrat. Though he shared with Crichton-Miller the background of being a son of the manse and possessing strong Christian values (the Tavistock was derisively termed &#145;the parson's clinic&#146; by Professor Edward Maypother of its rival, the Maudsley Hospital), Rees did not share his zeal for discovering bodily causes of mental illness such as focal sepsis or endocrine disorders:<blockquote>If Crichton-Miller was a Don Quixote with a very high aim, J. R. Rees was the necessary complement as his Sancho Panza, mundane, much more down-to-earth, practical organising and executive person who actually made the Tavistock Clinic function as a living institution. (Dicks, 59)</blockquote>Rees had an almost missionary zeal to promote not only the Tavistock Clinic, but the spread of knowledge of and the techniques of psychotherapy and mental health into wider fields. This he achieved in British army psychiatry and then found his apogee in the World Federation of Mental Health. What he achieved for the Tavistock was one phase of the career of someone who was described as &#145;this natural unself-conscious leader and originator&#146;  (Dicks, 296).<br>
<br>To his surprise, Rees was invited in 1939 to take command of British army psychiatry at home, where he initially found that he was the only psychiatrist available. He quickly assembled a team, mostly from colleagues at the Tavistock Clinic, several of whom had also served in the First World War. Their collective experience gained psychiatrists respect from serving officers and opened the way for them to be both acceptable and influential throughout the war. By 1945 there were 300 trained psychiatrists in the army and significant work was done in personnel selection, the study of morale breakdown and maintenance, and the psychiatric rehabilitation of neurotic soldiers and of returning prisoners of war. Under his direction army psychiatry became efficient and humane. The education and training of mentally handicapped soldiers was a major innovation which led the way in post-war developments. He finished the war with the rank of brigadier.<br>
<br>After succeeding Crichton-Miller, Rees had greatly fostered the growth of the Tavistock Clinic but the position altered greatly after the Second World War. The Tavistock itself was a changed place: a younger generation had experienced power and influence in the armed forces and were enthusiastic to acquire and use psychoanalytic knowledge. Rees, however, was not in tune with this enthusiasm. He felt pressured by the power of the younger generation to give up his position as director, which he did in 1947. So began the third phase of his career. Rees became a leading figure in the movement to maintain and develop wartime co-operation among psychiatrists, to build on what had been learned and his mission became to research and to treat mental illness in its social roots. After organizing the first Mental Health Congress in London in 1948, he was highly influential in the formation soon afterwards of the World Federation for Mental Health, of which he was president for one year, subsequently director for many years. Indefatigable, diplomatic, his activities widely recognized, he became honorary president after retirement. The federation brought modern psychiatry to developing countries, trained their personnel, and stimulated research. His modest apartment at 116 Bickenhall Mansions, Baker Street, London, was at the heart of this new movement, a welcoming place for colleagues worldwide. At one point when the treasurer of the World Federation for Mental Health had to declare the treasury empty he produced a shilling from his pocket to secure its future.<br>
<br>Rees was able to acknowledge that he was not in the top rank of psychiatrists or psychotherapists. His influence derived from his dedication, and his ability to assemble, to work with teams, and to encourage individual development. His tolerant, genial personality and democratic style of leadership was significant in the great expansion of the Tavistock Clinic in the 1930s, to army psychiatry in the Second World War, and in the World Federation of Mental Health. The great influence of the Tavistock Clinic in the professionalization of work in the field of mental health and illness has been analysed by Nikolas Rose in <span class="italic">The Psychological Complex</span> (1985) and <span class="italic">Governing the Soul</span> (1990).<br>
<br>Among Rees's writings the most personal is <span class="italic">Reflections</span> (1966) published at his retirement by the United States committee of the World Federation for Mental Health. His wartime experience is described in <span class="italic">The Shaping of Psychiatry by War</span> (1945) and in <span class="italic">The Case of Rudolph Hess</span> (1947). He became a member of the Royal College of Physicians in 1936, a fellow in 1944, and was made CBE in 1946. Rees died on 11 April 1969 at his home, 116 Bickenhall Mansions, Baker Street, London.<br>
