<span class="headword">Paul,  Robert William</span>  (1869&#150;1943), <span class="occ">maker of scientific instruments and cinematographer</span>, was born at 3 Albion Road, Holloway, London, on 3 October 1869, the son of George Butler Paul, a London shipowner, and his wife, Elizabeth Jane Lyon. He was educated at the City of London School and at the Finsbury Technical College of the City and Guilds of London Institute at Cowper Street, off City Road. There he received an elementary education in electrical instrument making, electric lighting, and general physics. He worked first in the workshops of Elliott Brothers, scientific instrument makers, then in a draughtsman's office. After a short spell in the factory of the Bell Telephone Company in Antwerp he started his own business in 1891 as an instrument designer and maker in Hatton Garden.<br>
<br>Paul maintained links with the college, where Professor W. E. Ayrton and his colleagues, John Perry, Thomas Mather, and others were engaged in designing electrical measuring instruments. Their ideas for instruments often helped Paul to find new products, which were sold under the inventor's name but succeeded thanks to Paul's manufacturing craftsmanship. In just three years his business expanded to include a four-storey factory in nearby Saffron Hill.<br>
<br>Paul became interested in the new art of cinematography; in 1894 two Greek showmen, who had brought some Edison and Dickson kinetoscopes to London, asked him to make another six. In fact he made sixty; Edison had not patented it in Britain, and Paul improved the design. When film from America became unavailable he collaborated with photographer Birt Acres to design a camera. This partnership was short-lived so Paul began to make his own films, designing a mechanical arrangement, a Maltese cross (&#145;Geneva escapement&#146;), to advance the film frame by frame. His projector, patented in March 1896, was called the theatrograph. He demonstrated it at Finsbury Technical College and the Royal Institution and was soon recognized as an expert in cinematography. A famous exploit was to film the prince of Wales's horse, Persimmon, winning the Derby in 1896; he showed the film several times to rapturous applause the following evening at the Alhambra, Leicester Square.<br>
<br>In the same year Paul began to make short films, initially using sets built on the Alhambra's roof. Such was their success that in 1897 he could afford not only to build a proper studio in Muswell Hill, but also, on 3 August, to marry his leading lady, Ellen Dawn; born Ellen Daws about 1867, she was the daughter of Augustus Daws, cabinet-maker, and also had some theatrical background.<br>
<br>Both the cinema side and the instrument making side of Paul's business flourished; in 1902 for the latter he added a purpose-built factory to the Muswell Hill site, where standard products were efficiently manufactured in large numbers. Of particular note was Paul's 1903 invention, the highly sensitive yet robust &#145;Unipivot&#146; galvanometer which &#145;played an important role in taking instruments out of the laboratory and into industrial applications&#146;  (Cattermole and Wolfe, 165). Other Unipivot instruments followed: 126 pages of Paul's 1914 catalogue were devoted to them, and Unipivot was the telegraphic address for his works in New Southgate. His instruments were recognized internationally, winning gold medals at the 1904 St Louis Exposition and the 1910 Brussels Exhibition. By 1910, though, he had become disillusioned with &#145;show business&#146; and concentrated on instrument work. He burnt his stocks of film and sold his film-making equipment. Despite the highly lucrative nature of this work, Paul had always considered it as a sideline, although in 1936, with Hepworth and Barker, he gave an interesting address to a meeting of the British Kinematograph Society entitled &#145;Before 1910: kinematograph experiences&#146;.<br>
<br>Paul often made specialized instruments for friends to help their research. In 1911 he opened a branch in New York to where instruments were sent from Muswell Hill for American distribution. On the outbreak of war in 1914 his works were involved in providing signalling equipment for the army and navy, including wireless equipment for use in the trenches. This continued his association with Finsbury Technical College where W. H. Eccles was working on short-wave equipment for the signals experimental establishment at the War Office. Of particular note was the Paterson&#150;Walsh auto-aircraft height-finder, manufactured by Paul once it was adopted by the War Office. He was also interested in submarine warfare and the problems of acoustic and magnetic mines and the detection of mines and submarines.<br>
<br>In early 1918 his Muswell Hill factory was bought by the War Office (signals department); Paul continued his experimental work in temporary premises in nearby Fortis Green with thirty of his best workmen from the factory. He bought the works back the following March and immediately negotiated to sell them to the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company; this was completed in November to form the Cambridge and Paul Instrument Company. From February 1920 Paul sat on the new company's board but began to withdraw from instrument design, concentrating on financial affairs. In his own workshop, though, he did work on projects of particular interest to him. One such, in 1933, was the Bragg&#150;Paul pulsator, a forerunner of the iron lung, for which he designed and built a small hydraulic machine which pressed and released rubber bellows on the chest of a man (a friend of Bragg's) suffering from muscular atrophy, thus greatly assisting his breathing.<br>
<br>Paul died on 28 March 1943 at The Priory, Roehampton, following a cerebral thrombosis. His will established the R. W. Paul Instrument Fund which was to help those whose research was hampered by the lack of funds for developing a particular instrument. He had also endowed the apprentices' prizes at the Physical Society's annual exhibition of apparatus. He had been loyally supportive of the society for many years, serving as a vice-president in 1928&#150;31 and 1939&#150;42, and as treasurer in 1935&#150;9. He was awarded the Duddell medal in 1938. He was also founder fellow of the Institute of Physics and vice-president in 1927&#150;31. He was a council member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers and served as a manager and vice-president of the Royal Institution, where he played an important role in the success of the Faraday Centenary Exhibition at the Royal Albert Hall in 1931.<br>
