<span class="headword">O'Conor <span class="st"> [O'Connor]</span>,  William Anderson</span>  (1820&#150;1887), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was born in Cork. His family came from Roscommon, and spelt their surname O'Connor. After attending school in Cork for a short period he was dogged by ill health, which kept him at home for several years. Eventually, at nearly thirty years of age, he went to Trinity College, Dublin, with the intention of entering the ministry. His course there was, however, interrupted by his father's financial difficulties, and he resumed his studies by entering St Aidan's Theological College, Birkenhead, Cheshire, where he was appointed Latin lecturer. He did not finally graduate until 1864. After his ordination in 1853 he became curate first of St Nicholas's Church, Liverpool, and then, in 1854, of St Thomas's, Liverpool. From 1855 to 1858 he had sole charge of the church of St Michael and St Olave, Chester, and in 1858 he was appointed rector of St Simon and St Jude, Granby Row, Manchester, a very poor city parish, where he worked for the rest of his life. On 3 March 1859 he married Charlotte Boydell (<i>b</i>. 1829), daughter of Isaac Temple. They had no children.<br>
<br>Several years after O'Conor settled in Manchester his eloquence and originality as a preacher began to attract attention. He worked hard as a parish priest but found his surroundings uncongenial and discouraging. He was said to find much relief in literary pursuits and in the society of men of literary tastes, among whom he shone as a witty and versatile conversationalist and writer. He became a frequent contributor to the <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> of the Manchester Statistical Society and the Manchester Literary Club, and the many papers which he read to the latter were said to have been marked by originality, subtlety, and humour. As well as writing on literary subjects he published a number of sermons, biblical commentaries, and a <span class="italic">History of the Irish People</span> (2 vols., 1882), which was arguably not so much a history as an indictment against English rule in Ireland. Originally a pamphlet, the work was revised and reprinted in 1886&#150;7. He became involved in fashionable societies such as the Dramatic Reform Association and the Manchester Art Museum Committee. He also acted as a poor-law guardian for a time.<br>
<br>In 1885 O'Conor went to Italy, in the hope that this would be beneficial to his health; while there he became chaplain of an Anglican church in Rome. After his return to England he was soon absorbed in work, but before long became ill again. He then went to Torquay, where he died on 22 March 1887 and where he was buried; his wife survived him. At the time of his death he was in straitened circumstances, his estate amounting to less than &pound;250.<br>
<br>O'Conor was a tall, slim man, his features pale and ascetic-looking. A good likeness of him was printed in Peter Okell's paper in the <span class="italic">Manchester Quarterly</span> (January 1891).<br>
