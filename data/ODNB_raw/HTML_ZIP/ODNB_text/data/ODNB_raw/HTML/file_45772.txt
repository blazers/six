<span class="headword">Reynolds,  Alfred</span>  (1818&#150;1891), <span class="occ">wood-engraver and colour printer</span>, was born on 1 April 1818 at Donnington, near Chichester, Sussex, the youngest of seven children of George Reynolds (1766&#150;1851), naval officer, and his wife, Mary Ann (1783&#150;1833), daughter of Richard Prior, yeoman, of Donnington, and his wife, Ann; he was a grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23425/', "Admiral John Reynolds")</script>. He was baptized on 8 May 1818 at Providence (Independent Calvinistic) Chapel, Chichester, reflecting the religious persuasions of his mother. His father was an evangelical churchman. Alfred probably followed his brother William (<i>b</i>. 1815) in attending a school in Southgate, Chichester, before being apprenticed, on 1 August 1832, to George Baxter, colour printer (grandson of the principal founder of Providence Chapel), to learn wood-engraving, at 29 King's Square, Clerkenwell, London, where Baxter lived, and where William Reynolds was already an indentured pupil. About 1836 Baxter moved, with his apprentices, to 3 Charterhouse Square. It appears that Alfred was an inventive pupil but was not alone in finding Baxter's teaching of wood-engraving insufficiently intensive. (He was among former apprentices who in 1849 opposed in court an extension of Baxter's colour printing patent.) Another apprentice was F. W. M. Collins, later joint patentee with Reynolds of the block process.<br>
<br>How Reynolds was employed in 1839&#150;43 is unknown. By 1844 he had joined Collins and another former fellow apprentice, Charles Gregory, in London, as wood-engravers and printers, taking charge of their colour printing. Their skill soon rivalled that of Baxter, and was praised by contemporary critics, including Thackeray. Gregory, Collins, and Reynolds soon specialized in illustrating children's books, including a <span class="roman">Home Treasury</span> series (1846) by the versatile Henry Cole, who apparently introduced Reynolds to another entrepreneur, Herbert Minton, pottery manufacturer of Stoke-on-Trent.<br>
<br>On 14 March 1848, Collins, possibly the financier, and Reynolds, usually referred to as the inventor, patented (no. 12079) a process &#145;for improvements in ornamenting china, earthenware, and glass&#146; by printing several colours exactly on to ceramic or glass surfaces. The result was far superior to the earlier transfer printing. Minton encouraged this project, considering Reynolds as the inventor. Reynolds moved to Stoke-on-Trent in 1848 to manage his process for Minton, who apparently acquired, for fourteen years, a two-thirds share in this patent in May 1849. Reynolds later assumed complete responsibility for Minton's tile department. Some independent evidence shows that at least until the early 1860s Reynolds operated his invention on his own account as well.<br>
<br>Reynolds's technique was immediately used at Mintons for producing large coloured tiles designed by A. W. N. Pugin to decorate the smoking room of the new House of Commons. In 1855 Reynolds's work won a first-class medal at the Universal Exhibition in Paris. In spite of later competition from two breakaway tile firms, particularly after 1868 from Minton Hollins, block printed tile manufacture increased in later years and by 1880 accounted for more than a fifth of Mintons' sales. In 1873 Reynolds was awarded, at a Universal Exhibition in Vienna, another first-class medal. &#145;He was well placed&#146;, Paul Atterbury states, &#145;to mastermind the great revival in pictorial and decorative tiles that occurred in the 1870s&#146;, concluding that &#145;his technical developments were crucial to Mintons' foremost position as producers of decorative printed tiles&#146;  (Atterbury and Batkin, 40, 394). The block process continued in commercial use until the 1920s.<br>
<br>At Stoke, Reynolds, who remained a bachelor, lived in lodgings. Alone among his immediate relations he was a convinced Liberal in politics. His influence secured a clerkship in a local bank for his young nephew Alfred S. H. Reynolds (son of his brother William), who consequently lived with him from 1877 to 1883, and in 1885 married into a Stoke family. In 1886 Reynolds retired on account of heart trouble, but he continued to enjoy an active interest in books, flowers, astronomy, and local good works until his sudden death at his home, Bank House, Vine St, Stoke-on-Trent, on 9 January 1891. Appreciated by Mintons' workpeople for his kindly character, he was buried on 16 January amid public mourning by an old friend, Bishop Sir Lovelace Stamer, rector of Stoke 1858&#150;92, at Hartshill cemetery. He left a surprising quantity of small house property. Harrison Weir, a contemporary pupil of Baxter, wrote from Kent, &#145;his memory has ever been fresh and green in my mind&#146;  (H. Weir letter to A. S. H. Reynolds, 1891). Anonymous commemorative verses appeared in <span class="italic">Poetical Wild Oats</span> (n.d.), 100&#150;06, published by Digby, Long &amp; Co., London.<br>
