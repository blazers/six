<span class="headword">Slade,  William James</span>  (1892&#150;1982), <span class="occ">shipowner and master mariner</span>, was born on 28 April 1892, at 18 Irsha Street, Appledore, Devon, the eldest son of William Kingdon Slade (1865&#150;1943), master mariner, and his wife, Rosina Annie Abigail (1865&#150;1964), daughter of Captain Richard Harding of Appledore. Slade attended the Wesleyan elementary school in Appledore from 1895 until 1904, when he was allowed to leave at the age of twelve after passing an examination.<br>
<br>The male members of the Slade family had traditionally been employed as seamen but, partly as a result of the part-time work of the women of the family in the garments industry, they were just beginning to acquire small vessels of their own. These were employed in the home trade, that is, the coasting trade, and the trade with European ports between Brest and the Elbe. Slade had, since infancy, spent a month or more at sea with his father and his mother (who was an experienced sailor in her own right) in the family's vessels during the summer. Now he went to sea with his father in the ketch <i>Ulelia</i> as boy at 1<i>s</i>. (5p) a passage. His duties were to cook, clean, help to work cargo, and assist with the working of the vessel.<br>
<br>Slade's father was barely literate, but he was a hard-driving man with an excellent business sense, and all the secretarial and business work in connection with the operation of the vessel was given to the boy, at his father's dictation, at the end of each working day, which lasted from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. Increasingly as he grew into his teens Slade was also given responsibility for navigation and pilotage. As a result he was sometimes hardly ashore for months on end, even though the vessels were employed in the home trade. When the <i>Ulelia</i> was partly rebuilt at Appledore he spent five weeks working with the shipbuilders.<br>
<br>Although an unbelievably hard life, it was superb training, of which he took full advantage, and as a result at the age of nineteen was given command of, and managing responsibility for, the schooner <i>Elizabeth Jane</i>. After a difficult start with a drunken crew Slade prospered with this vessel, and later with the schooners <i>Millom Castle</i> and <i>W. D. Potts</i>, which was sunk by a German submarine in 1917 when Slade was in command, the ketch <i>Trio</i>, and the three-masted motor schooner <i>Haldon</i>. In 1930 he lost an eye in an accident ashore but continued in command of the <i>Haldon</i> until 1943. In 1944 he sold her. He had by then acquired sufficient capital to maintain himself to his own satisfaction for the rest of his life and settled, after civil defence work during the remainder of the war, at 29 Bridgeland Street, Bideford, where his wife ran a draper's shop.<br>
<br>Although physically small Slade was immensely strong, a very able shipmaster, and an even more able businessman of great personal charm. To the end of his life he spoke with a strong north Devon accent. Slade also had the twin gifts of total recall and an ability to write in a pleasant, easy style. In 1959 his autobiography, <span class="italic">Out of Appledore</span>, was published. In it he was able to record not merely a form of seafaring life by then completely lost, but the social and economic background to it. The book went into four editions and became a minor classic of its kind. In 1971 he published a collaboration, <span class="italic">Westcountry Coasting Ketches</span>, of which he wrote much the greater part. Slade married in 1915 May Whitton (1892&#150;1971), daughter of a Baptist minister. He had known her since childhood. They had five sons, all of whom became professional men. He died on 31 August 1982 in Barnstaple Hospital, from the long-term consequences of diabetes, and was buried on 3 September in Bowden Green cemetery, Bideford.<br>
