<span class="headword">Garrett family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1778&#150;1884), <span class="occ">agricultural engineers</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_59153"></a><span class="headword">Richard [i] Garrett</span>  (1757&#150;1839), who founded the business in Suffolk in 1778. Richard came from a family that had been bladesmiths since the late seventeenth century at least. He was born at Woodbridge, Suffolk, on 12 October 1757, and at the age of twenty-one set up on his own account at nearby Leiston as a bladesmith. It was a small-scale business, making principally sickles and employing at most eight to ten men. He married Elizabeth Newson in 1778, and they had at least one son. In 1805 Garrett retired from this business and worked as a farmer until his death at Leiston, on 20 September 1839.<br>
<br>His son <a name="cosubject_59151"></a><span class="headword">Richard [ii] Garrett</span>  (1779&#150;1837), who was born on 4 August 1779 at Leiston, took over the management of the forge in 1805. In 1806 he married Sarah, daughter of John Balls of Hethersett, near Norwich. This match was of great significance for Garrett's business, for John Balls was the designer of improved threshing machines that used an open drum with beater bars, a principle of operation that became standard. The couple had three sons, <a href="#cosubject_59152">Richard [<i>see below</i>]</a>, Balls, and Newson. Garrett and his father-in-law began to manufacture threshing machines at Leiston and the firm began to grow. By the time Garrett died (on 6 June 1837 at Leiston) there were about sixty employees.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_59152"></a><span class="headword">Richard [iii] Garrett</span>  (1807&#150;1866) was born on 1 February 1807, also at Leiston. Aged only nineteen he took over responsibility for the finances of the engineering works in 1826. Ten years later he took over general management of the business from his father. Under his direction the firm became one of the leading agricultural engineers of East Anglia, employing about 500 people in the 1850s. In consequence the family advanced from being well-to-do tradesmen to respectable gentlemen-manufacturers. The design of threshing machines continued to develop, with the introduction of portable machines. Garretts started to produce steam engines to provide power for their threshing machines. Two other products for which Garretts became especially noted during the mid-nineteenth century were seed drills and horse hoes. Later machinery included traction engines for ploughing, and also steamrollers; the latter began to carry the distinctive Garrett trade mark on their funnels: a prancing horse in gleaming brass. Machinery from the Leiston works was exported worldwide, and sales were particularly good in Germany and Russia.<br>
<br>Leiston, near the Suffolk coast, was fairly isolated as the base for an agricultural engineering concern of national renown, and to counteract this Richard [iii] Garrett joined the promoters of the East Suffolk Railway. This railway company built the branch line, opened in 1859, that connected Leiston to the national network. Another of his business interests was the Camden Brewery, in north London, which he had founded. He was also involved in the discussions that led to the foundation of the Royal Agricultural Society of England and served as a member of the society's council from 1846 to 1856. Garrett married Elizabeth Dunnell in 1828. They subsequently moved from Leiston to live at Carlton Hall, Saxmundham. He served as justice of the peace and as deputy lieutenant for the county. In 1855 he retired from management of the engineering works, though remaining a partner, and moved to St John's Wood, London. He died on 26 June 1866 at Carlton Hall and was buried in Carlton churchyard.<br>
<br>Garrett and his wife had nine children, four sons and five daughters. The eldest son, <a name="cosubject_52536"></a><span class="headword">Richard [iv] Garrett</span>  (1829&#150;1884), became senior manager of the engineering firm, and brought as much vigour to its direction as his father had done. He was born on 22 July 1829 at Works House, Leiston, and was educated at a private school in Woodbridge. He was apprenticed to the Leiston works at the age of fourteen, appointed works manager when he was twenty-one in 1850, made a partner in 1853, and became senior partner on the death of his father in 1866. He was a first-rate engineer who made many practical contributions to the development of his firm's portable steam engines and threshing machines. Most notable was a threshing machine in which one fan provided all the blasts needed for the operation of threshing, dressing, and finishing; the principle was patented in 1859 in the names of Richard Garrett and James Kerridge. Garrett was a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.<br>
<br>Garrett became a noted agriculturist and sportsman at his Carlton Hall estate, and he also leased an estate of 2000 acres near Brandon, from William Angerstein. He was well known as a breeder of shorthorn cattle, Suffolk sheep, and Suffolk horses. His Suffolk stallions Cupbearer I and Cupbearer III won many prizes. He served on the committees of the Suffolk Stud-Book Association. As a young man he regularly rode to hounds, and in later years he turned to shooting as his main sporting recreation. He joined the Leiston rifle corps on its foundation in 1860, and retired with the rank of major from the 3rd battalion Suffolk rifle volunteers in 1870. He was a governor of Framlingham College, in the foundation of which his father had been active. Also with his father he founded the Leiston Mechanics Institute in 1861. Garrett contracted heart disease and, after a period of illness, died suddenly at Leiston on 30 July 1884; he was buried in Carlton churchyard. He never married, and the ownership of the firm passed to his brother Frank (1845&#150;1918).<br>
<br>By the 1850s the seed drills and horseshoes manufactured by Garretts of Leiston were the best-known in England. Garretts were also pioneers of steam engines and threshing machines for agricultural use, and they succeeded through a combination of inventiveness and productive energy in overcoming the natural isolation of their Suffolk coastal location to create an engineering firm of international renown. By the early twentieth century the firm had about 1200 employees. In the process, Leiston had grown from a small village to a small town, and the Garretts themselves had become a family of reasonable substance in local society, in farming, in horse breeding, and in sporting activities. The ramifications of the family's interests and activities were far-reaching, for Richard [iii] Garrett's brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59154/', "Newson Garrett (1812&#150;1893)")</script>, operated the maltings at Snape (later a major concert hall); among his six daughters were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30406/', "Elizabeth Garrett Anderson")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33096/', "Millicent Garrett Fawcett")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53628/', "Agnes Garrett")</script>.<br>
