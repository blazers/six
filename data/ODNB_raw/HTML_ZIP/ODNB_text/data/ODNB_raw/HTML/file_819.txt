<span class="headword">Astley,  John</span>  (1720&#150;1787), <span class="occ">portrait painter and beau</span>, was born at Wem in Shropshire on 24 June 1720, and baptized there on 6 April 1724, a younger son of Richard Astley, surgeon, and his wife, Margaret. After attending school in Shropshire, in the early 1740s he went to London to study under the fashionable portrait painter Thomas Hudson, the master of Reynolds, and from 1746 practised as a portrait painter and copyist.<br>
<br>About 1747 Astley went to Rome with a commission to copy old masters for Lord Chesterfield, and in 1748 was enthusiastically taken up by Horace Mann in Florence, who recommended him as a colourist with a rare application for one of his age and a deserving young man of irreproachable manners. Back in Rome to study drawing under Pompeo Batoni, Astley joined Reynolds and the circle of English artists working there. Reynolds's biographer James Northcote refers to an excursion they made to the country one hot afternoon when all save Astley threw off their coats, until, unable to withstand their joking, he revealed the back of his waistcoat&#151;made of one of his own canvases of a cascading waterfall. Further patronage from Mann in Florence, whose portrait he painted in 1751 (Lewis Walpole Library, Farmington, Connecticut, USA), and commissions for copies of old masters restored his finances. He returned to London in July 1752, visiting Bologna and Venice on his way, and then Paris, where he stayed to paint portraits.<br>
<br>In London Astley set up as a portrait painter, <span class="italic">Mary Woodyeare</span> (1753; ex Christies, 14 July 1994, lot 4) being an accomplished example; but in spite of some professional success&#151;he was among the artists who proposed a scheme for an academy&#151;he gained neither money nor fame and left for Dublin as an adventurer, probably early in 1756. He prospered beyond expectation by painting more ambitious family groups, such as the <span class="italic">Molyneaux Family of Castle Dillon</span> (1758; Ulster Museum, Belfast), but although his style became freer he never rose above an ordinary competence.<br>
<br>Deriving greater success from his personality than his pencil, Astley returned to England a widower with a young daughter. Travelling in his own post-chaise with an outrider and painting his way to London, he attended the Knutsford assembly, where he captivated Lady Penelope Dukinfield Daniell, a rich widow whom he married a week later, on 7 December 1759. After her death on 31 January 1762 Astley settled in St James's Street, London, where his fortune and inclinations led to a life of dissipation and gained him the reputation of the greatest beau upon the town. With the taste of a connoisseur he became skilled in fitting out interiors of villas and houses; acquiring the lease of Schomberg House in Pall Mall in 1769, he divided it into three, keeping the central part which he &#145;most whimsically fitted up&#146;  (Edwards, 125) for himself. Though he was strapped for cash as a result, the luck that never deserted him allowed him to seize the Dukinfield estate on the death of his stepdaughter in 1771. He built Dukinfield Lodge in 1775, embellishing it with old masters and portraits of family and friends that he continued to paint. He made many improvements on the estate, establishing an iron foundry and building housing for workers; not all these schemes prospered but fortune favoured him again when his brother died in an accident leaving him &pound;10,000. A year after becoming high sheriff of Cheshire in 1776 he sold Schomberg House and married for a third time; his new wife was Mary, daughter of William Wagstaffe, a Manchester surgeon, with whom he had three sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Wild estimates of his wealth had ranged up to &pound;150,000; but Astley died at Dukinfield Lodge, Cheshire, on 14 November 1787, owing&#151;it was said&#151;to the distressed state of his fortune reducing him to imbecility. He confessed to spending &pound;30,000 on seven years' excesses, not including &pound;25,000 that went on fitting up his houses. His obituarist referred to his eagerness for gain and pleasure, and to his good humour and good manners, but said he was more merry than wise, owing &#145;his fortune to his form; his follies to his fortune&#146;  (<span class="italic">European Magazine</span>, 468). He was buried in Dukinfield Chapel on 21 November 1787.<br>
