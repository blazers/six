<span class="headword">Commius</span>  (<em>fl. </em>57&#150;50 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>), <span class="occ">king of the Atrebates</span>, was a native of Gallia Belgica, probably of the tribe of the Atrebates, and an agent of Julius Caesar. He is first mentioned in Caesar's narrative of the Gallic wars  (iv.21) after the battle on the Sambre in 57 <span class="smallcap">BC</span> when Caesar appointed him king of the Atrebates, one of the tribes defeated in that engagement. Caesar was favourably impressed by his courage and diplomatic abilities, and accorded him several privileges. Commius possessed influence over some of the tribes of southern Britain, presumably through personal contacts. When Caesar (then in western Belgica among the Morini) was contemplating an expedition to the island in 55 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>, he sent Commius as a legate to Britain to forewarn the British tribes of the invasion and to persuade them to join Caesar's cause. Commius crossed to Britain with British legates who had earlier been sent to Caesar, taking with him a guard of thirty horsemen. When he sought to carry out his commission he was seized and put in chains, but during Caesar's expedition of the same year he was returned to his Roman overlord. Commius seems to have remained in Britain, for during Caesar's second expedition, in 54 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>, it was through his agency that Cassivellaunus submitted to Caesar.<br>
<br>In 53 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>, as many Gaulish chieftains began to threaten revolt against Rome, Caesar put Commius in command of a cavalry squadron to watch over the Menapii in western Belgica. In the great revolt of the Gauls in the following year, Commius deserted to the side of his countrymen, commanding his own Atrebates and a substantial force of Bellovaci; he himself was endowed with high military authority among the Gauls and took a leading part in the relief of the stronghold of Alesia (south-east of Dijon). Already before this one of Caesar's officers, Gaius Volusenus Quadratus, had tried to entrap Commius by inviting him to a friendly meeting at which the Gaul was to be killed. Although wounded by a sword-blow on this occasion, Commius was able to escape and return to his command of Gaulish forces in the north. In 51 <span class="smallcap">BC</span> Caesar renewed his operations against the Atrebates and Bellovaci. Commius sought help from the Germans east of the Rhine, returning with a cavalry force. But the Gauls fared badly in this campaign and Commius had to take refuge for a time among the Germans. Late in 51 <span class="smallcap">BC</span> he returned, hoping to continue the struggle, but by now the Atrebates had surrendered and only small raiding operations against Roman supply trains were possible. Again Volusenus Quadratus tried to capture Commius, this time by hunting him down. On one occasion the two came face to face, but this time Volusenus was wounded and Commius again made his escape. Soon afterwards, however, Commius submitted to Marcus Antonius, saying that he would accept any agreement provided that he should never again come into the presence of a Roman.<br>
<br>Shortly after this it is reasonably certain that Commius returned once more to Britain, where a coinage bearing his name was current in the region of modern Hampshire, Sussex, and adjacent areas. An undated episode reported by Frontinus may be linked with his final departure from Gaul. Pursued to the coast by Caesar, Commius hoisted his sails while still in harbour, thereby deluding his pursuers that he had already set sail and thus escaping. It is not known how long he continued in power in Britain. He did, however, found a dynasty from his base within the British Atrebates. Three other kings in Britain struck coins bearing their names along with the filiation &#145;son of Commius&#146;: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62297/', "Tincommius")</script> in what is now Hampshire and Sussex, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62299/', "Verica")</script> in Sussex and Surrey, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62298/', "Eppillus")</script> in Kent [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48662/', "Roman Britain, British leaders in (act. 55 BC&#150;AD 84)")</script>]. Commius has a strong claim to recognition as the most successful king of Iron Age Britain. His prestige owed much to his earlier alliance with Caesar, partly through the glamour of association, partly through the advantage of seeing the Roman military machine at work. Had he not decided upon separation from Rome, or had he lived a few decades later, Commius would have made an effective client-king on the frontiers of empire.<br>
