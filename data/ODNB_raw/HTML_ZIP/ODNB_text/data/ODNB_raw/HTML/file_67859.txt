<span class="headword">Leslie,  William</span>  (1621/2&#150;1707), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and missioner</span>, was born between October 1621 and April 1622, the son of Alexander Leslie of Conrack, Moray, and his wife, Agnes Gordon of Cormellat. He entered the Scots College, Douai, in September 1636. In October 1640 he went to the Scots College, Rome, was ordained priest on 15 June 1647 after seven years' study, and in September 1647 proceeded to Paris to prepare for mission work in Scotland. In the winter of 1649 to 1650, however, six Scottish secular priests meeting in Paris, having decided to petition Rome to give them a superior and financial support, agreed that Will Leslie should remain in Rome as their agent.<br>
<br>Leslie's single-minded and lifelong aim was to establish a body of secular priests, with one of them as bishop, controlling the Roman Catholic church in Scotland. Most mission work in Scotland was being done by Jesuits; the rectors of all Scots colleges except that in Paris were Jesuits, and students of the Scots College, Rome, became Jesuits rather than secular priests. Although the Roman Congregatio de Propaganda Fide existed to oversee all missionary work, Jesuits were not responsible to it but directly to the pope. Leslie worked tirelessly to increase <i>propaganda</i>'s influence and in autumn 1661 was appointed its archivist.<br>
<br>Leslie's influence was increasingly powerful, not only with <i>propaganda</i> but also with other church dignitaries and even with popes&#151;of whom he served under eight&#151;and after 1688 with the Jacobite court in exile. Everything affecting the Scottish mission became his concern. He kept a close watch on the Scots College in Rome, sending complaints, memos, and petitions about its rectors and their administration, particularly to <i>propaganda</i>, and was in constant touch with the Paris college, which acted as a staging post and sent students to Rome. Though he declined to assist the missionary plans of the Scottish Benedictines in Germany, he welcomed their assistance to the mission superior in Scotland.<br>
<br>Leslie's life's work was successful. In 1694 Rome appointed a vicar apostolic, Thomas Nicolson, to whom the Jesuit missioners submitted in 1701. When Leslie died on 23 April 1707, having been enfeebled from the 1690s by kidney stones, the Scottish clergy comprised two bishops, Nicolson and a coadjutor, and a majority of secular priests. Leslie's countless lengthy letters (which gained him the sobriquet the Homilist) were long-winded, moralizing, but also outspoken. His consistent opposition, and indeed antipathy, to the Jesuits is plain to see, though his alleged plotting to have their missionary practices in China condemned is at least not proven.<br>
