<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Deloitte,  William Welch</span>  (1818&#150;1898), <span class="occ">accountant</span>, was born in London. Although his family background is not well documented, it is known that his father was a secretary to a well-known firm of provision merchants and his mother was the daughter of a West Indies planter named Welch. Reputedly, his paternal grandfather was a Count de Loitte, who had fled from the revolutionary reign of terror in France during 1793 and found refuge in Hull.<br>
<br>Having spent twelve years on the staff of the official assignee in bankruptcy, Deloitte in 1845, at the age of twenty-seven, set up his own practice. His experience proved invaluable, for at this time the most lucrative assignments that an accountant could win fell in the field of insolvency. His first office, at 11 Basinghall Street, London, was close to his former employers and, significantly, to the bankruptcy courts. Living over the premises, Deloitte gathered some eighty-seven clients (mostly individuals or partnerships) by the end of his first year in practice, and was soon employing ten clerks. Under his leadership the firm continued to grow, so that by 1897 it comprised seventy staff and, by 1900, shortly after his death, its fee income had reached &pound;41,193, having risen from &pound;7597 in 1874.<br>
<br>A crucial event in the long-term success of the practice was the appointment in 1849 of Deloitte to assist the shareholder auditors of the Great Western Railway (GWR). Not the least advantage of this was that Deloitte could then mention the assignment as a measure of his integrity when writing to bankrupts named in the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, offering to prepare their statements of account prior to a court appearance. The shares of the GWR had been falling in value, and the proprietors, increasingly concerned for the company's well-being, recorded in February 1850 that &#145;the auditors have been assisted for the first time throughout the laborious examination of all books, accounts and documents of the company by a public account [Deloitte] whom they appointed without previous communication with any individual connected with the company&#146;  (TNA: PRO, RAIL 250/65, 166). Although surprised by this action by the shareholders, the directors concurred with the arrangement once they were satisfied, in August 1849, that the &#145;sole object [of the auditors] was to strengthen their hands and inspire general confidence in the management&#146;  (ibid., 250/127, 2). In the event, Deloitte continued to advise the shareholder auditors until 1887, when he was personally elected to one of these posts, which he retained until his retirement in 1897. The appointment, of considerable importance in terms of both status and fee income, then passed to his firm.<br>
<br>Deloitte (who audited the Langham Hotel from 1883 and the Savoy from 1890) was said to have been the originator of a system of hotel accounting which was later widely adopted. Unlike some City practices, he built up a strong industrial base among his clientele, and audited not only railway companies (Lancashire and Yorkshire, West London Extension, and the South Wales Railway, as well as the GWR and a large number in South America) but also docks, collieries, and ironworks, including the Vulcan Foundry Company, Powell Duffryn (from 1864), and the Ocean Coal Company. Deloitte was closely associated with Sir Daniel Gooch, Sir John Pender, Sir George Elliot, and Cyrus Field and the other pioneers of submarine telegraphy, so that his firm secured the audit of almost all the large cable companies, including the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company. However, his practice was not exclusively industrial: from 1889 Deloittes audited the Prudential, from 1882 were joint auditors of the London Stock Bank, and had many newspaper assignments, with, among others, <span class="italic">The Observer</span> from 1886.<br>
<br>His standing within the profession led to Deloitte being called upon to investigate frauds&#151;one committed against the Great Northern Railway in 1857, and another at the Great Eastern Steamship Company in 1870. The inroads that financing the employment of his many staff made on his capital encouraged him to seek a partner in March 1857, and he sold a 50 per cent share in the firm to Thomas Greenwood, who was then share registrar of the GWR. When Greenwood left the partnership in 1867, his share of the capital was worth &pound;6000. Deloitte then admitted a succession of partners, all of whom had trained in the firm: Henry Dever (1867&#150;97), Alfred Richard Hollebone (1867&#150;73), and John George Griffiths (1869&#150;1902).<br>
<br>An important aspect of Deloitte's career concerned his involvement with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, of which he served as fourth president in 1888&#150;9, having been the vice-president from 1884. He had been an original council member of its predecessor, the Institute of Accountants in London, and on its foundation in 1880 became a council member of the English Institute. In addition he had been a member of the Manchester Society of Accountants, having joined because of his office in that city, which practised under the style of Deloitte and Halliday. Yet the partnership with James Halliday ceased in 1877 and no further branches were opened in the UK until one was established at Cardiff in 1912.<br>
<br>About 1858 Deloitte settled at Hill House, Mount Pleasant, Southall, Middlesex, where he lived until his death. He was married twice and had at least one child, a daughter. A freemason for more than fifty years, he was also a benefactor of the Church of England, funding the construction of Holy Trinity Church, Southall, and six almshouses for the poor. He did not retire until 1897 when, aged seventy-nine, he was said to be the oldest practising accountant in London. One of those who had worked for his firm described him as &#145;an alert, decisive little man with just a touch of austerity in his manner; this, however, covered a kind heart&#146;  (Kettle, 6). He died at his home, Hill House, on 23 August 1898.<br>
