<span class="headword">Wilton,  Frederick Charles</span>  (1802&#150;1889), <span class="occ">actor and stage manager</span>, was born on 3 December 1802 in Bristol, the son of a saddler. Little is known about his parents, although he recounts that his father died at sea and that he had a brother, James George Wilton, also an actor, who died in Bristol on 20 October 1830. About 1823 he married Amelia Sherrill (<i>d</i>. 1873), a dancing-teacher and actress and a native of Devonport, Plymouth. They had six surviving sons and daughters: Edward George (<i>b</i>. 1823/4); George (<i>b</i>. 1826/7); Tom (<i>b</i>. 1834/5); Elizabeth (Lizzie) Theresa (<i>b</i>. 1832/3), who married John Byron; Amelia Harriet (<i>b</i>. 1840/41), who married Fred Rountree; and Jessie (<i>b</i>. 1845/6), who married an actor named Drury in 1878. A further seven sons died in infancy. Edward, George, Tom, and Lizzie eventually emigrated to Australia.<br>
<br>Wilton made his d&eacute;but as an actor with James Dawson and David Obaldiston's company in south-west England in 1821. He acted in Edinburgh and Perth in 1826&#150;7 and appeared in James Brunton's company in Birmingham, Plymouth, Bristol, and Swansea from 1828 until mid-1831. His association with Plymouth continued until 1837; he became stage manager of the Devonport theatre in 1836 and managed the Victoria Theatre, Plymouth, for a short summer season in 1837. From 1836 he had also been playing for Hay's Exeter company (he was acting there with Samuel Phelps when the latter received an invitation to appear with Macready in London) and in 1839 appeared with other actors on a profit-sharing basis in Honiton and Yeovil. In 1840 he moved to London, and he appeared at the City of London Theatre until 1841; his movements in 1842 are unaccounted for, but during 1843 he became stage manager of the Theatre Royal, Gravesend. In December of that year he was appointed stage manager of the Britannia Saloon (later Theatre) in Hoxton, but he left six months later after a disagreement with its manager, Samuel Lane. He returned to Gravesend, then from 1844 to 1846 was a member of the Royal Victoria Theatre's company in south London, at that time managed by his former colleague Obaldiston.<br>
<br>In January 1846 Wilton returned to the Britannia as stage manager, and he remained there until his retirement on 31 July 1875. The Britannia Theatre, one of London's major East End theatres during the nineteenth century, certainly owed a lot of its success to Wilton's efficient stage management during some of its most formative years: the actor J. B. Howe described him as &#145;one of the best practical stage managers&#146; he had ever seen  (Howe, 99); elsewhere he was described as &#145;the most scholarly, clever, gentlemanly and patient of stage managers&#146;  (Britannia clippings, Theatre Museum). Wilton's responsibilities included the preparation, rehearsing, and staging of plays and the annual pantomime; recruiting extras and novelty acts; representing management if problems arose with the authorities; organizing benefit performances; preparing playbills and newspaper puffs; and dealing with absenteeism. When the &#145;Pepper's ghost&#146; effect was first integrated into a theatrical production in 1863, it was Wilton's responsibility to co-ordinate it. Additionally, he acted in many of the Britannia plays. Until 1863 he and his wife also ran a grocer's shop in Houndsditch: in the 1861 census he is described as &#145;comedian and grocer&#146;.<br>
<br>As early subscribers to the Royal General Theatrical Fund, both Wilton and his wife were able to draw pensions on their respective retirements. In his spare time he was not only a keen angler, gardener, chess player, and reader, but his diaries also reveal a strong interest in current affairs. Just over a year after his retirement he emigrated to Australia, departing on 14 November 1876. He initially resided in Sydney, soon moved to Melbourne with John and Lizzie Byron, though he returned to Sydney in 1880. Even in retirement he records meetings with actors such as Howe, and attempts to track illicit performances of Britannia plays in Australia. His diaries, which are the source for much of this information, cover not only his retirement years but also the last twelve and a half years he spent at the Britannia, providing a unique resource for the reconstruction of day-to-day life in a major nineteenth-century London playhouse. Few English stage managers of the period, apart from James Winston, have left such accounts; interestingly, Wilton's diaries, while chronicling Britannia minutiae, also reveal him as a highly literate, erudite, sociable, and witty individual. He died at his home, 130 Darlington Road, Sydney, on 8 September 1889, and was buried the following day in the city's Waverley cemetery.<br>
