<span class="headword">How,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1657&#150;1719), <span class="occ">bookseller and printer</span>, was the son of Mary How. Little is known of How's heritage but the printer Job How was probably a brother, possibly a twin. John was bound as an apprentice on 3 June 1672 to the London bookseller and printer Benjamin Harris; the indenture recorded his mother as a widow of London. Job was bound on the same day to a different London printer. It appears that How was not trained as a printer, although this is at odds with his later criticism of those who print without serving an apprenticeship. Where book imprints lack a forename, it is difficult to distinguish John from Job, but before 1699 How probably worked primarily as a bookseller rather than as a printer; John Dunton notes in 1705 that How &#145;was a Bookseller for many Years, and now follows the Trade of Printing&#146;  (Dunton, 297). John and Job may have had some sort of business relationship, as they produced at least three works together.<br>
<br>How's first publications appeared in 1680, during which year he was based successively in Mutton Court, Maiden Lane, and at the Seven Stars in Sweetings, or Swithins, Alley to the east of the Royal Exchange in Cornhill, London. By the following year he had moved the Seven Stars to the south-west corner of the Exchange itself. By 1683, however, his imprints place him to the north of Bishopsgate, and in 1684 his sign was given as the Coach and Horses.<br>
<br>At some time before 1686 How married Katherine, with whom he had at least three children: Job, Rachel, and Susannah. How then disappears from the records for over a decade, a gap which may be attributable to his political sympathies as a whig; Dunton claims that How had been &#145;a great Sufferer in King <i>James's</i> Reign, and has had the <span class="smallcap">FATE</span> of being a Traveller&#146;  (Dunton, 298). How's re-entry into the book trade in 1696 was inaugurated by work jointly printed with Job, John Seller's <span class="italic">History of England</span>, and from 1697 until at least 1702 he was based in Ram-Head-Inn-Yard in Fenchurch Street. In 1700 he became quite active, printing at least ten original or subsequent editions of works by Edward Ward.<br>
<br>During his career How commissioned or printed several weekly and bi-weekly newspapers, usually satirical and pointedly anti-Catholic. His first two publications were such periodicals: <span class="italic">Mercurius Publicus</span>, printed for How from 28 February to 18 March 1680, and the <span class="italic">Catholick Intelligence</span>, which survived only a little longer, from 1 March to 29 March 1680. On his return to the trade How printed the <span class="italic">Weekly Comedy</span> from 17 May 1699 to 12 July of the same year. His most contentious periodical was <span class="italic">The Observator</span>, a publication commissioned by the whig pamphleteer John Tutchin, printed by How, and sold by the bookseller Benjamin Bragg; it first appeared in April 1702 and was at times associated with Daniel Defoe. In 1703 How's connection with it resulted in a proclamation by Queen Anne for his apprehension along with that of Tutchin and Bragg. Although <span class="italic">The Observator</span> ran until 1712, How is associated with it only until 1704, perhaps falling victim to Tutchin's tendency to quarrel with political allies as well as opponents. Dunton specifically cites How's involvement with <span class="italic">The Observator</span> as evidence of his awareness of developing trends in the book trade: How, &#145;being a great Projector &hellip; is like to encrease a pace&#146;  (Dunton, 298).<br>
<br>By 1707 How had moved to Talbot Court, Gracechurch Street, where in 1709 he produced one of his final printings, his own pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Some Thoughts on the Present State of Printing and Bookselling</span>. His text is an invective against wealthy printers who pirate texts and freely vend their wares &#145;because they are rich&#146;  (How, 4). He concludes with twelve proposals for securing and protecting copyright laws. The pamphlet is dated 28 November, four months prior to parliamentary approval of the <span class="roman">Copyright Act</span> of 1710. How's pamphlet must have been an irritation, both for the printers to whom he alludes and for those directly named. The proposals were essentially conservative, however, and failed to address two of the most controversial issues connected to the emerging copyright laws: time limits on a printer or publisher's right to print a particular text, and the developing debate over who is entitled to literary property rights.<br>
<br>How was buried at St Benet Gracechurch, London, on 16 September 1719. Dunton describes him as &#145;<i>Generous</i> and <i>Franck</i>, and speaks what he thinks; which &hellip; has given him an <i>Honest Character</i>&#146;  (Dunton, 297). His will, dated 6 September 1719, was proved on 20 September 1720. A year after his death financial pressures led his widow to put the printing house up for sale.<br>
