<span class="headword">Jones,  Emily Beatrix Coursolles</span>  (1893&#150;1966), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 15 April 1893 at 6 St John's Park, Blackheath, London, the youngest of the eight children of Major Charles Jones (1840&#150;1896) of the Royal Artillery, formerly of Toronto, Canada, and his wife, Mary Jane Ross (1855&#150;1936), who, with her siblings, including her brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37915/', "Robert Baldwin Ross (1869&#150;1918)")</script>, had left Upper Canada in 1872. Nicknamed Topsy, Emily was brought up from 1900 onwards at Jesmond Hill, near Pangbourne, Berkshire, and educated by governesses and for one term at St Felix's School, Southwold.<br>
<br>During the First World War, E. B. C. Jones worked for the food control ministry and was assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Common Cause</span>, the suffragette weekly. Later she lived at home, a m&eacute;nage described by her friend Romer Wilson in <span class="italic">If All These Young Men</span> (1919), where Susan has &#145;hair cut straight at the sides and twisted up at the back in the Spanish fashion &hellip; she looked like a thin modern intellectual doll with black hair and red blotched cheeks&#146;  (Wilson, 49), and with her sister Petica Robertson and her husband at 56 Bateman Street, Cambridge. Here she became friends with contemporaries such as Rosamond Lehmann and Dadie Rylands. E. B. C. Jones published twelve poems in <span class="italic">Windows</span> (1917) and her first novel, <span class="italic">Quiet Interior</span>, in 1920; this was praised by Kathleen Murry (Katherine Mansfield) for &#145;its distinction of style&#146;  (Mansfield, 308), while Rebecca West saw &#145;a sense of character that can be brilliant or touching&#146;, adding: &#145;Miss Jones has caught perfectly the tone of life as it is lived among pretty young people with enough money to give them power to amuse themselves, but not so much money that they need move out of Bayswater&#146;  (West, 82).<br>
<br>On 17 February 1921, at the register office in Cambridge, E. B. C. Jones married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34623/', "Frank Laurence (Peter) Lucas (1894&#150;1967)")</script>, a fellow of King's College. They appeared compatible even though Virginia Woolf observed: &#145;she, I suppose, had a deeper experience of life, &amp; somehow vouched for all sorts of things which, with his &hellip; scholar's unworldliness, he was ready to take on trust&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Virginia Woolf</span>, 2.156). At their home, The Pavilion, 20 West Road, Cambridge, she &#145;would lead the conversation, fixing her guests with a bright, determined, searching gaze and firing leading questions at them in a deep voice &hellip; demanding frankness&#146;  (Lehmann, 139). Three more novels were published between 1921 and 1924; in 1927 <span class="italic">Helen and Felicia</span> was described by Cyril Connolly as a &#145;moving and conscientious study of fondness written with sobriety and grace&#146;  (Connolly). In that year an affair with &#145;Rex&#146; (probably Warner) made it inevitable that the Lucases be &#145;separated for ever, owing to her flirtatious ways&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Virginia Woolf</span>, 3.225), and E. B. C. Lucas moved to London. <span class="italic">Morning and Cloud</span> (1932) found a publisher only with difficulty although Dora Carrington, for example, preferred it to previous novels. The shock of the deaths of her and Strachey, the publishers' rejections, as well as the unsatisfactory nature of her emotional life, partially explained her ceasing to write after such a promising beginning; she did, however, write reviews and a few critical pieces and remained friends with writers such as Dorothy Richardson and Walter de la Mare.<br>
<br>In 1930 E. B. C. Lucas fell in love with (Frederick) Donald Livingstone (Ian) McIntyre (1905&#150;1981), a barrister, later QC, who had &#145;desperate reserve&#146; but was &#145;the handsomest man I ever saw&#146;  (private information, R. Cohen). They lived at 2 Peel Street, Kensington, and after 1934 at Craston's Orchard, Yattendon, Berkshire. She had no children, saying &#145;she had fared much better with two much loved nephews who returned her devotion&#146;  (ibid.); these were the sons of Petica Robertson. During the war Ian McIntyre was a prisoner of war in the Far East, where he displayed enormous fortitude. Afterwards they lived in somewhat uneasy harmony until her death, at Newbury District Hospital, from a stroke on 30 June 1966. Her body was cremated at Reading crematorium on 8 July.<br>
