<span class="headword">Fitton <span class="st"> [<em>married names </em>Polewhele, Lougher]</span>,  Mary</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1578, <em>d.</em> 1641), <span class="occ">courtier and gentlewoman</span>, was baptized at Gawsworth, Cheshire, on 24 June 1578, the younger daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9522/', "Sir Edward Fitton (1548/9&#150;1606)")</script> and his wife, Alice Holcroft (<i>d</i>. 1626). At some point between July 1596 and early 1598 she went as a maid of honour to the court of Elizabeth I. The comptroller of the royal household, Sir William Knollys, promised her father that he would play &#145;the Good Shepperd &amp; will to my power deffend the innocent lamb from the wolvyshe crueltye &amp; fox-like subtletye of the tame bests of this place&#146;  (Warks. CRO, CR 136, B244). Occupying the chamber next to the maids, he was well placed to do so, but he soon fell in love with Mary, thirty years his junior. Spurned (he was also married), he confided the pains of unrequited love to Mary's sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52768/', "Anne Newdigate (1574&#150;1618)")</script>, who was living in Warwickshire, in a series of frank letters replete with images of frost, desert, and purgatory. In this relationship, as in others later, there is no direct evidence of Mary's feelings: Lady Fitton complained to Anne on 3 July 1598 that &#145;I never harde from her&#146;  (Warks. CRO, CR 136, B118), and Mary's two surviving letters, addressed to Anne, are affectionate but formulaic.<br>
<br>Knollys remarked on Mary's proneness to melancholy and nervous disorder. By 12 January 1600 she had left court in bad health and retired to her father's London house. She was still there just before 21 February, when she was visited by Lady Sidney. Any prospect of marriage was hindered by the fact that &pound;1200 intended for her portion was in the hands of Sir Henry Wallop, one of Sir Edward's debtors. However, by early summer Mary was back at court, her presence there a valuable asset to her father, who was often absent in the north-east transacting sensitive business between Sir Robert Cecil and the earls of Derby. Before 5 August she warned him that he had been &#145;maligned&#146; behind his back, and advised his presence &#145;to purge&#146; himself  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 10.265). &#145;Mistress Fitton&#146; herself was established in the public eye. When the clown William Kempe of the Lord Chamberlain's Men dedicated to Anne Fitton his <span class="italic">Nine Dayes Wonder</span> (1600), Mary was probably his intended target. Her most prominent appearance was as the leading masker, Affection, in the festivities surrounding the marriage on 16 June of fellow maid of honour Anne Russell and Henry Somerset, Lord Herbert.<br>
<br>By this time Mary had become the mistress of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13058/', "William Herbert (1580&#150;1630)")</script>, also styled Lord Herbert, eldest son of Henry Herbert, second earl of Pembroke. When she was revealed to be pregnant the following January, the queen's wrath fell on the maids' chamber as a whole, and Mary was committed to the care of Lady Hawkins. By 5 February 1601 her lover, now third earl of Pembroke, had confessed his responsibility, but Cecil reported that &#145;he utterly renounceth all marriage&#146;  (Brewer and Bullen, 4.20) and predicted that they would both go to the Tower. In March Pembroke was sent to the Fleet prison, where he remained for some weeks, while Mary gave birth to a son, who died soon afterwards. On 18 May Sir Edward wrote to Cecil that Mary, who seems to have been convinced that she had been promised marriage, was still confident in her claim before God, but he was himself pessimistic. Knollys, still regretting &#145;hyr whom I have so much loved&#146;, shared his gloom, writing furiously to Anne Newdigate that, after he had taken so much care to manure the soil, &#145;the man off synne&#146; spoiled the harvest, &#145;havyng in the night sowed tares amongst the good corne&#146;  (Warks. CRO, CR 136, B238). On 6 June Sir Edward appealed again to Cecil &#145;to let me taste your old and good favour to me and all my children&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 11.218), but to no avail: the earl would not be forced into a socially and financially disadvantageous marriage.<br>
<br>By autumn 1601 Mary seems to have retired to the country, leaving behind a damaged reputation. Probably in October a Mistress Martin of Ludgate, London, misremembered &#145;when Mrs Lytton was in favour &hellip; and the Earl of Pembroke favoured her, she would tuck up her clothes, put on a white clock, and march out of court like a man, to meet him&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>addenda</i>, <i>1580&#150;1625</i>, 411). Within a few months Mary found a new lover in her kinsman, naval officer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16538/', "Sir Richard Leveson (c.1570&#150;1605)")</script> of Lilleshall, Staffordshire, whose wife, Margaret, became insane about 1601&#150;2. Leveson installed Mary on his estate at Perton, in the parish of Tettenhall, also in Staffordshire, and in 1603 she gave birth to their daughter, Anne; but he died in London of smallpox on 2 August 1605. A short-lived, possibly posthumous son, William, was buried at Tettenhall on 8 January 1608.<br>
<br>Against her parents' wishes, but with the powerful encouragement of the Egerton family, early in 1606 Mary married Captain William Polewhele, who had served under Leveson. They continued to live at Perton and had two children, (another) William (1606&#150;1654), baptized at Tettenhall on 1 December 1606, and Frances, baptized and buried in February 1609, before Polewhele died later that year, between 19 September, the date of his will, and 26 September, when he was buried; Mary's pregnancy, noted in the will, subsequently resulted in another daughter, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1667). About 1612 Mary at last married a gentleman of similar social status to her own, John Lougher (<i>d</i>. 1636) of Tenby, Pembrokeshire, a former MP with legal training who had served on the northern high commission court at York. They had at least three children&#151;Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1640&times;47), John, and Lettis (<i>d</i>. 1678)&#151;and lived mainly at Perton, keeping close contact with the Newdigate family even after Mary's sister's death in 1618.<br>
<br>Mary's later life, of which little else is known, saw a series of lawsuits with members of the Leveson family. Sir Richard Leveson had settled his estates on the sons of his cousin Sir John Leveson on condition either that whichever was the heir married his illegitimate daughter Anne Fitton or that they give her a &pound;4000 portion. However, the inheritance was encumbered by debt and the Levesons expressed doubts about Mary's suitability as a mother. In 1609 Polewhele failed to obtain through the court of chancery &pound;1000 due to his wife and in the same court between 1619 and 1624 the Loughers failed to secure Anne's rights. Anne finally married Robert Charnocke of Astley in Chorley, Lancashire, at Tettenhall on 4 April 1625. John Lougher, who was sheriff of Pembrokeshire in 1626&#150;7, died intestate on 8 January 1636. Mary died in 1641 and was buried at Tettenhall on 19 September. Her will, drawn up on 19 December 1640, left the lease of Perton to her son William Polewhele and leases in Pembrokeshire to Elizabeth Lougher. Lettis Lougher, who is not mentioned, had already married Thomas Denton, and was the mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74667/', "Thomas Denton (1637&#150;1698)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74666/', "Denton, John")</script>] and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7514/', "Henry Denton (d. 1681)")</script>.<br>
<br>At a meeting of the New Shakspere Society on 13 June 1884, Thomas Tyler argued for the identification of Mary Fitton as the &#145;dark lady&#146; of Shakespeare's sonnets. For some years, since her first lover, Pembroke, was himself identified as &#145;Mr W. H.&#146;, the theory gained wide acceptance. In his article on Mary Fitton in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, Sidney Lee pronounced it &#145;ingenious&#146; but yet to be proven; long before the second edition of 1908, in which he discounted it altogether, he and others had changed their minds. The chief cause was the appearance in 1897 of Alice Emily Newdigate-Newdegate's <span class="italic">Gossip from a Muniment Room</span>, which included reproductions of portraits of Mary at Arbury Hall. In an extended discussion appended to the second edition of this work (1898), G. C. O. Bridgeman supported Lady Newdigate-Newdegate's suggestion that Mary's colouring, with brown rather than black hair and light eyes, rendered her an unlikely &#145;dark lady&#146;, and others, reviewing this and the shaky identification of &#145;W. H.&#146;, concurred. In 1910 George Bernard Shaw prefaced his interlude <span class="italic">The Dark Lady of the Sonnets</span>, in which the heroine was Mary Fitton, with a statement that this was a mere convenient fiction. However, some authors perpetuated the original theory, and Mary Fitton figured prominently and imaginatively in Charles Creighton, <span class="italic">Shakespeare's Story of his Life</span> (1904), Frank Harris, <span class="italic">The Man Shakespeare</span> (1909) and <span class="italic">The Women of Shakespeare</span> (1911), and Ernest Jones, <span class="italic">Hamlet and Oedipus</span> (1949), and probably longer in the popular mind.<br>
