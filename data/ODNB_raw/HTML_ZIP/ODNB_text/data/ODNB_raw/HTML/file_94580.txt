</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Markova, Dame  Alicia</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Lilian Alicia Marks]</span>  (1910&#150;2004), <span class="occ">ballet dancer</span>, was born on 1 December 1910 at 23 Wilberforce Road, Finsbury Park, London, the eldest of the four daughters of Arthur Tristman Marks (<i>d</i>. 1924), a mining engineer, and his wife, Eileen Mary Roth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barry (<i>d</i>. 1949). Arthur Marks was Jewish, of Polish ancestry, and his wife, who was Irish Roman Catholic, converted to Judaism. Alicia's great uncle, Sir Albert Altman, was like her father an engineer and had designed the drawbridge mechanism for Tower Bridge. By 1914 Arthur Marks owned a factory on the Caledonian Road, London, manufacturing his invention &#145;rubberine&#146;, which was used by the British army to strengthen tyres. The Marks family prospered and travelled in a Rolls-Royce. Aged six, Alicia was a solemn and obedient little girl who had not yet begun to speak. She was mostly taught at home by a strict nanny and governess, Gladys Hogan, known as Guggy.<br>
<br>Physically fragile, Alicia began dancing lessons on a doctor's recommendation. Her mother enrolled Alicia and her second eldest daughter, Doris, to learn &#145;fancy dancing&#146; at a branch of the Thorne Academy, near Muswell Hill where they now lived. (Doris later became a performer in revues, under the name Doris Barry.) On Miss Thorne's recommendation, Alicia gave her first performance in a talent-spotting competition in 1919, at the Muswell Hill Athenaeum cinema. Her parents were astounded: their daughter, so timid in everyday life, was completely undaunted and won the five-guinea prize. Soon after she was taken to see Anna Pavlova perform at the Queen's Hall. She was so overwhelmed that she persuaded her somewhat reluctant father to ask if the ballerina would meet her. The next day, at Ivy House, Pavlova's home, Alicia performed her ballet exercises for the great ballerina who showed her how to rub herself down with cologne after dancing.<br>
<br>Alicia Marks's professional d&eacute;but was in December 1919 at the Kennington Theatre, London, which always used young students for its pantomimes. She was engaged as a principal dancer in <span class="italic">Dick Whittington</span>, for which she earned the considerable sum of &pound;10 a week and was billed as &#145;Little Alicia, the Child Pavlova&#146;. The <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> described her as &#145;a very accomplished ballerina in miniature&#146; (quoted in Leonard, 31), and another dance student, the seventeen-year-old Patrick Healey Kay, who as Anton Dolin would be her stage partner years later, was so impressed that he left flowers at the stage door. Revising her scepticism, Eileen Marks decided to enrol Alicia in the classes of the leading Russian teacher in London, Princess Serafina Astafyeva, at the Pheasantry in the King's Road, Chelsea. Anton Dolin, who was a pupil in the same class, used to pinch Alicia and pull her hair because she was so serious. One day, a friend of Astafyeva arrived to watch the class. Serge Diaghilev was looking for promising talent for his lavish new production of <span class="italic">The Sleeping Princess</span> (better known as <span class="italic">The Sleeping Beauty</span>). He picked Anton Dolin and, amused by the tiny eleven-year-old Alicia, introduced a new character&#151;the diminutive Fairy Dewdrop&#151;who in the ballet's prologue would dance a variation choreographed by Bronislava Nijinska. The production opened at London's Alhambra Theatre in 1921, but diphtheria robbed Alicia of the role. As compensation, Diaghilev arranged regular tickets and sometimes sat with her, explaining the action on stage. Her solemn, intelligent concentration enchanted him and he did not forget her. Three years later he took her, aged fourteen, into the Ballets Russes and Russified her name to Markova.<br>
<br>In that year Markova's father died of pneumonia shortly after a disastrous investment had also caused the family's fortunes to plummet. Accompanied by Guggy, Alicia set off from Victoria Station with the Ballets Russes for Monte Carlo. In the adult world of the company she was a lonely figure, forbidden to accept invitations and gifts, while Guggy forced her to lead a drab life of work and study. On good days, Guggy allowed Alicia two chocolates but if she was criticized in class these were withheld. Her substitute father was Diaghilev, normally an intimidating figure addressed as Sergey Pavlovich, but she called him Sergipops. Because she was so small, casting her required a judicious eye. Her first role was Little Red Riding Hood in <span class="italic">Aurora's Wedding</span> (a compilation from the 1921 <span class="italic">Sleeping Princess</span>); her first major role was as the nightingale in <span class="italic">Le chant du rossignol</span>, choreographed for her in a new 1926 version by Georges Balanchine. Igor Stravinsky guided her through his score's intricacies and Henri Matisse designed her all-white costume. Alicia's virtuosity thrilled Balanchine. He included double <i>tours en l'air</i>, a turning jump from the male lexicon, and devised a diagonal of <i>fouett&eacute;s</i> that evoked a little bird hopping.<br>
<br>Alicia toured for five years with the Ballets Russes until Diaghilev's death in 1929. In this period Balanchine also created solos for her in the world premi&egrave;re of Ravel's <span class="italic">L'enfant et les sortil&egrave;ges</span>. She danced child roles in <span class="italic">La boutique fantasque</span> and <span class="italic">Petrushka</span> and was cast as Papillon in Michel Fokine's <span class="italic">Carnaval</span>, the Bluebird <i>pas de deux</i> in <span class="italic">Aurora's Wedding</span>, and the title role in Balanchine's <span class="italic">La chatte</span>. She appeared in Massine's <span class="italic">Cimarosiana</span> and was also given a single performance of the second act of <span class="italic">Swan Lake</span>. These featured roles apart, she danced in the corps de ballet&#151;once she had grown taller&#151;because Diaghilev thought this essential for her development from child prodigy to mature artist. However, just before the summer break in 1929, he promised to promote her to principal in the autumn and to give her important roles. But on 19 August Diaghilev died and a month later the Ballets Russes folded.<br>
<br>This was devastating news for Markova, who returned to London to live with her mother in Ladbroke Grove. She danced in Monte Carlo during a three-month opera season as one of a group of dancers organized by Serge Grigoriev to perform in ballet sections of operas. She then received an invitation from the young dancer Frederick Ashton, then just starting out as a choreographer, to appear in the ballet sequence he was devising for Dryden's <span class="italic">Marriage &agrave; la mode</span> at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, in 1930. She accepted and in the same year started dancing in ballets he choreographed for two new organizations marking the beginning of regular British ballet seasons: the Camargo Society and Marie Rambert's Ballet Club (later Ballet Rambert). Markova took the Persian title role in Ashton's <span class="italic">La p&eacute;ri</span> (1931), while in his first masterpiece, <span class="italic">Fa&ccedil;ade</span> (1931), she danced the witty polka at the premi&egrave;re and, later, the tango and tarantella. She was the sexy tap-dancing Creole girl in his <span class="italic">Rio Grande</span> (1931), the proud ballerina in <span class="italic">Foyer de danse</span> (1932), the dangerously chic girlfriend in <span class="italic">Les masques</span> (1933), and Marguerite in <span class="italic">Mephisto Valse</span> (1934). The tiny stage of the Ballet Club's Mercury Theatre, with the audience almost at touching distance, probably helped develop her magisterial concealment of strain, and the floating, delicate serenity with which she would later be associated. But her early roles brought out a different, sharp gift for characterization. In Ninette de Valois's <span class="italic">Bar aux Folies Berg&egrave;re</span> (1934) she was La Goulue, for which de Valois suggested she study the walk of the &#145;ladies of pleasure&#146; in Soho. Markova received 10<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per performance, which was enough only to pay for her late taxi home and her ballet shoes. In 1932 she therefore agreed to supplement her income with the commercial shows&#151;performed between film projections&#151;that Ashton was staging at the Regal Cinema, Marble Arch. She danced three times a day, eighteen times a week; and came to the attention of a wide public.<br>
<br>Shortly before, Markova had been invited to join Ninette de Valois's newly launched Vic-Wells Ballet and was now shuttling between theatres in taxis. She began with the Vic-Wells Ballet in several of de Valois's works and the same year (1932) staged and performed Fokine's <span class="italic">Les sylphides</span>. Two years later she danced the premi&egrave;re of Ashton's <span class="italic">Les rendezvous</span>, in a role celebrating her technique, warmth, and wit, and in 1935 she created the role of the Betrayed Girl in de Valois's <span class="italic">The Rake's Progress</span>. With Markova in place, de Valois was able to think of mounting the old classics, starting with <span class="italic">Giselle</span> in 1934 at the Old Vic. Partnered by Dolin, Markova was the first British Giselle and this became her signature role, her dancing moving beyond technique into a world of distilled emotion and ethereality. In the same year she danced two other classical Vic-Wells premi&egrave;res, <span class="italic">The Nutcracker</span> and <span class="italic">Swan Lake</span>, in the first complete productions staged in Britain.<br>
<br>By now it was clear that Markova and Dolin could fill theatres on their own. In 1935 they left to start the Markova&#150;Dolin Company, and from then on de Valois concentrated on developing Margot Fonteyn to fill the gap. The Markova&#150;Dolin Company toured the country for two years, showing an enthusiastic public a mixed repertoire that included Nijinska's <span class="italic">Les biches</span>, with Markova playing the mysterious, androgynous figure in blue. Dancing eight performances a week was, though, a strain. In 1938 Markova accepted L&eacute;onide Massine's invitation to join the new company he was forming, the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. There she created roles in large-scale Massine ballets: <span class="italic">Seventh Symphony</span> (1938); <span class="italic">Capriccio espagnole</span> (1939), <span class="italic">Rouge et noir</span> (1939)&#151;with designs by Matisse who painted the decoration on her thighs&#151;and <span class="italic">Vienna 1814</span> (1940). Her contract meant she was required to tour the USA during the first years of the Second World War, often travelling great distances in considerable discomfort. In 1941 she joined Ballet Theatre (later renamed American Ballet Theatre), where she was reunited with Dolin. She was in the premi&egrave;re of Fokine's last ballet, <span class="italic">Bluebeard</span> (1941), and in his new production of <span class="italic">Les sylphides</span>. She created Juliet in Antony Tudor's <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> (1943), to music by Frederick Delius, and slept in her dressing room between rehearsals to save time. While touring with Ballet Theatre she and Dolin performed <span class="italic">Giselle</span> at the Hollywood Bowl before an audience of 35,000. They appeared in Billy Rose's new Broadway revue, <span class="italic">The Seven Lively Arts</span> (1944&#150;5), dancing <span class="italic">Sc&egrave;nes de ballet</span> (choreographed by Dolin) to Stravinsky's commissioned score. In 1946, with the impresario Sol Hurok, they re-formed the Markova&#150;Dolin Company, and toured the United States, the Caribbean, and the Philippines.<br>
<br>Markova was now the world's highest paid dancer with a weekly income of $1000. But she missed England. In the summer of 1948 she returned to be a guest with de Valois's company (the future Royal Ballet) at the Royal Opera House, where she triumphantly danced <span class="italic">Giselle</span> and <span class="italic">Swan Lake</span> and made her d&eacute;but in <span class="italic">The Sleeping Beauty</span>. In 1949 she and Dolin pioneered the use of British arenas for ballets, having previously performed in a baseball stadium in Montreal, introduced by a regiment of Mounties. They appeared at the Empress Hall in London (with a nightly audience of 7000) and at Haringey. Following this, they toured with a supporting group which was the seed for Festival Ballet. Markova thought of the name, to coincide with the Festival of Britain. Festival Ballet was launched in October 1950, but injury forced her to leave in 1952. Subsequently she concentrated on guest engagements and concert performances. She made her d&eacute;but in Bournonville's <span class="italic">La sylphide</span> with the Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas. She appeared with the Indian dancer Ram Gopal and Pilar Lopez's Ballet Espanol. In 1955 she danced <span class="italic">Giselle</span> in New York with the young Erik Bruhn and four years later, in Ireland, she danced her last <span class="italic">Giselle</span>. The same year, she was the subject of a BBC television's <span class="italic">This is Your Life</span> programme. <br>
<br>Markova's last performance took place in 1962, in <span class="italic">L'apr&egrave;s-midi d'un faune</span> with Milorad Miskovitch and London Festival Ballet. That this would be her final public appearance was not known at the time, since it was later, recovering from illness, that she decided to stop. She was appointed DBE in 1963, having already become a CBE in 1958. Between 1963 and 1969 she was ballet director of the New York Metropolitan Opera House, staging dances for operas and in 1970 she was made professor of ballet and performing arts at the University of Cincinnati. From 1981 to 2004 she was president of the London Ballet Circle and from 1986 to 2004 president of English National Ballet. She was the author of <span class="italic">Giselle and I</span> (1960) and <span class="italic">Markova Remembers</span> (1986), a book of reminiscences which unexpectedly revealed a sharply humorous and disarmingly frank side to her personality. Her phenomenal memory made her an illuminating coach for professional dancers. She gave several televised master classes, although no substantial film record remains of her own dancing. She also involved herself enthusiastically in the activities of ballet schools and competitions. She continued staging ballets, especially <span class="italic">Les sylphides</span>, taught to her by its choreographer, Michel Fokine.<br>
<br>In 2002, at the age of ninety-one, Markova featured in a documentary, <span class="italic">Alicia Markova, la l&eacute;gende</span>, by the French film-maker Dominique Delouche, which included footage of her coaching dancers of the Paris Opera Ballet. Though fragile in appearance, she combined extraordinary resilience with a steely perfectionism that drove her to sacrifice everything to her art. She projected a peerless image of sublime effortlessness on stage and, with her immaculate clothes and small, composed voice, soign&eacute;e refinement off. She was Britain's first prima ballerina and grew into an international star.<br>
<br>Dame Alicia Markova lived at Park Mansions, Knightsbridge, London, with her sister Doris before moving to a nursing home in Bath. She died following a stroke on 2 December 2004 at the Royal United Hospital, Bath. She never married.<br>
