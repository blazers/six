<span class="headword">Holden, Sir  Isaac</span>, first baronet  (1807&#150;1897), <span class="occ">inventor of a wool-combing machine, entrepreneur, and politician</span>, was born on 7 May 1807 at Hurlet, near Paisley, the seventh child of Isaac Holden (<i>d</i>. 1826) and his wife, Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Forrest. His father, a native of Cumberland, combined small-scale farming with leadmining there before moving in 1801 with his Scottish-born wife to Nitshill, between Glasgow and Paisley, where he worked as a coalmine foreman developing local educational facilities in his spare time. The family moved several times during Isaac's youth: to Kilbarchan, where a brief spell at grammar school was followed at the age of eleven by employment as a draw boy and attendance at night school, where he became interested in mechanical matters; to Johnstone, where Isaac combined cotton-factory work with part-time schooling; and when he was fifteen to Paisley, where a year later he became a full-time student, and then teaching assistant, at James Kennedy's school, where the curriculum included maths, physics, Latin, and Greek. Isaac thus received a well-rounded education despite his early acquaintance with the world of work, and his enthusiasm for study, allied to a weak constitution, indicated a cerebral rather than a physical career.<br>
<br>During his early twenties, to support his mother after the death of his father in 1826, Isaac held a succession of teaching posts in Yorkshire and Reading, where he allegedly discovered the Lucifer match. At the same time a deep commitment to Wesleyanism and extensive preaching engagements suggested the possibility of a life of ministry. In 1828 he returned to Glasgow but two years later, poised to establish his own school specializing in commercial subjects, he accepted a bookkeeping position at the worsted manufacturing firm of Townend at Cullingworth, near Keighley in Yorkshire. He achieved semi-managerial status during his sixteen years there and developed, through his own efforts, an expertise in mechanical engineering. Although his employers recognized his value they failed to offer Holden the partnership he frequently requested. At the age of forty he left the firm to form his own small and short-lived worsted factory in Bradford. In 1832 he had married Marion Love, daughter of Angus Love of Paisley, with whom he had four children, Angus (<i>b</i>. 1833), Edward (<i>b</i>. 1835), Mary (<i>b</i>. 1839), and Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1842); Marion died in 1847 following a period of ill health and on 5 April 1850 Holden married his second wife, Sarah Sugden (<i>d</i>. 1890), daughter of John Sugden of Keighley and sister of the Sugden brothers, worsted manufacturers of Oakworth. Her family was known for Wesleyan piety. Sarah was an important force in his life, particularly in religious matters. They had no children.<br>
<br>It was while he was employed at Townends that Holden became fascinated by the problem of mechanizing the combing of wool, which, for several decades since Edmund Cartwright's first patent for the process in 1789, had proved intractable. Holden was determined to produce a commercially viable machine comb and upon leaving Townend he sought to make the acquaintance of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34554/', "Samuel Cunliffe Lister")</script>, a wealthy and influential Bradford worsted manufacturer, who not only shared his intense interest in wool-combing technology, but owned the patents of the main elements of the machine he hoped to bring to perfection. Pooling their knowledge, but making particular use of Holden's efforts, a patent was filed in 1848&#151;significantly in Lister's name only&#151;on which the &#145;square-motion&#146; comb was based. The next step was to exploit the machine commercially, by establishing a wool-combing enterprise. A partnership agreement was reached in 1848 (signed 1 January 1849) whereby Lister was to provide the necessary capital and machinery (and was to be free to develop other interests) while Holden was to manage the business and perfect the machine. The enterprise was to be located in France because the square motion was particularly suited to conditions in the industry there, and because the partners wished to dominate French wool-combing by impeding the diffusion of competing technology and filling the market with combed wool produced on their own machine. Accordingly a factory, previously owned by John Collier, also an inventor of a significant machine comb, was rented at St Denis and business began in 1849. As planned, Holden perfected his machine, and developed an enterprise that was organizationally and technically unique. The square motion was one of 169 combing techniques patented in the peak of the 1840s and 1850s, yet it was one of only a handful that achieved long-term commercial success. It possessed special features and was unique in its ability to comb all grades and thicknesses of wool, but its position among the leaders was also the result of Lister's manipulation of the patent system. Through the practice of purchasing patents on inventions which competed with their own designs, the partners achieved a technical near-monopoly, and Holden created a machine that removed potential competitors by producing the finest combed wool. Once the square-motion comb was fully protected he set his mind on manufacturing and on the problems of conducting business in a foreign country.<br>
<br>Operations at St Denis were immediately successful, returning profits of &pound;2000&#150;&pound;3000 per month by the early 1850s. Expansion into the mainstream of the French industry quickly followed; in 1853 production began at purpose-built factories at Croix and Rheims, which became the focus of the Holden family empire. In 1858 Holden bought Lister's share of the business, thus ending ten turbulent years of partnership, and in 1860 the St Denis plant ceased production. Upon Lister's departure, Holden's sons, Edward and Angus, became partners, while the active management of the French factories was undertaken by his nephews, Jonathan Holden and Isaac Holden Crothers, who each received a 10 per cent share in the firm. Holden's activities took the French industry by storm: between 1865 and 1895 his two factories produced 25 per cent of the industry's requirement of combed wool. Production was on the basis of commission combing, and although Holden could not take credit for introducing it into France, he was responsible for maximizing its potential and extending its practice. His factories, which expanded rapidly, were revered as the marvel of the period and in time were copied and became the standard for the wool-combing industry. On the basis of immense profits (over &pound;1 million at Rheims alone in 1863&#150;80, &pound;4000 per week at the two factories during the 1870s), Holden became a wealthy man. While he was not completely self-made, he did practise the well-rehearsed Smilesean values (to the extent of embarrassing his children with his extreme thrift) and his approach to people and business typified the French paternalist entrepreneur. Such was his influence that he became a respected authority on French textile matters and the town of Croix became known as Holden City.<br>
<br>Upon Holden's return to Yorkshire in 1860, Penny Oak Mills in Bradford were acquired for Angus and Edward, and what was to be his own main wool-combing concern in Yorkshire, Alston Works, Bradford, was opened in 1864. He settled at Oakworth House, constructed to his own specification, and became a central figure in the West Riding textile community, a position strengthened by the marriage of three of his children to members of the Illingworth family [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48712/', "Illingworth, Alfred")</script>]. He retained a close interest in his French factories, which continued to be managed by his sons and nephews, and although business and mechanical issues remained important to him&#151;legal wrangles with Lister over the invention of the square motion preoccupied his later years&#151;political and religious interests absorbed more of his time. He was sustained in his religious life by his exceedingly devout second wife. While in France he built Wesleyan chapels and ran <span class="roman">Bible</span> classes at the sites of each of his enterprises. He gave generously to further the cause of British Wesleyanism, and in 1871 donated &pound;5000 for fifty chapels in the London area. He entered parliamentary politics following the advice of his doctor to find a less onerous occupation after a period of ill health. He sat as Liberal MP for Knaresborough in 1865&#150;8 and remained involved in political activity, offering policy advice on economic matters to the Liberal cause, until he located a replacement seat. In 1882 he became MP for the north-west division of the West Riding and from 1885 to 1895 sat as member for Keighley. In recognition of his contribution to the nation's political life, Holden received a baronetcy in 1893. He died at his home, Oakworth House, Oakworth, on 13 August 1897.<br>
