<span class="headword">Stewart,  John</span>, first earl of Angus  (<em>d.</em> 1331), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of Alexander Stewart of Bunkle, north-east Berwickshire (<i>d</i>. in or before 1319), grandson of Alexander, the steward of Scotland, who had played a prominent part in the politics of the reign of Alexander III; his mother's name may have been Christian. John Stewart's grandfather, also John Stewart of Bunkle, was an auditor for Bruce during the Great Cause, supported Wallace's rising in 1297, and died at the battle of Falkirk in 1298. The younger John Stewart's family allegiances notwithstanding (his father was forfeited of his English lands in 1314 for adherence to Robert I), he seems to have been neither prominent nor particularly favoured until the final year of the reign of Robert I. Alexander died before the end of 1319, but it is possible that John was still a minor at that time, since he makes almost no appearance in the record of Robert I's reign. (One act, dated 1315, was witnessed by a John Stewart, but this may well have been a different man.)<br>
<br>The promotion which Stewart came to enjoy in the late 1320s was presumably the result of his close kinship with Walter Stewart, King Robert's son-in-law. Indeed, following Walter's death in 1327, leaving an infant heir, John was the senior member of the Stewart lineage. On 24 October 1328 a papal dispensation licensed his marriage to Margaret (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1370), daughter of Alexander Abernethy, who was a considerable heiress, with estates centred on Abernethy, Perthshire, on the south side of the Tay. (The date of the marriage may also be evidence of his youth.) Stewart was styled merely lord of Bunkle in the dispensation, and his name is conspicuously absent from the list of signatories to the treaty of Edinburgh of 17 March 1328. A charter of June 1329, however, gives him the title of earl of Angus. The earldom had been in the hands of the Umfravilles since the middle of the previous century, and although the family had been resolutely pro-English for most of the Anglo-Scottish war, it seems that it was not until the last year of his reign that Robert I eventually forfeited the earldom, granting it to John Stewart. He was knighted by David II (again perhaps a sign of only recently having gained his majority) at the king's coronation on 24 November 1331, but died of an unknown cause two weeks later, on 9 December.<br>
<br>Stewart left a son, <a name="cosubject_54328"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Stewart</span>, second earl of Angus  (<em>c.</em>1330&#150;1362)<span class="occ"></span>, who succeeded to the earldom as a very young child. That the petition for the dispensation for his marriage to Margaret, daughter of William Sinclair of Roslin, was seconded by the king of France in 1353 had been taken as evidence that he may have spent at least part of his youth in France. It should be noted, though, that he begins to appear in Scottish record some three years earlier, a fact attributable to his close kinship to Robert Stewart, the king's lieutenant; indeed, he was Robert's closest kinsman except for David II himself. He was a witness to various <i>acta</i> between 1350 and 1357, and in 1354 was described as lieutenant in Angus and the Mearns. According to Walter Bower, in November 1355 he was the prime mover in the seaborne attack on Berwick which briefly captured the town from the English. Chamberlain for nearly two years from June 1356, he was also named in October 1357 as one of the high-ranking hostages offered to the English king as surety for the payment of the ransom for David II's release from captivity.<br>
<br>Angus seems to have been less favoured on the return of King David in 1357. Only once thereafter, in 1360, does he appear as a witness to a royal act, and it may be that his imprisonment in 1361 was the culmination of a period in which the king had been suspicious of him. He was accused of involvement in the murder of Katherine Mortimer, the king's mistress, as well as &#145;disturbances and damaging actions perpetrated by him against the community&#146;  (Bower, 7.318&#150;21), and imprisoned in Dumbarton Castle, where he died of plague the following year.<br>
<br>Angus and his wife, Margaret, had two daughters, Margaret and Elizabeth, who were his coheirs. Margaret married Thomas, earl of Mar, and after his death in 1377 became the mistress of William Douglas, first earl of Douglas, to whom she bore a son, George. Since Douglas's wife was Margaret's sister-in-law, the relationship was technically incestuous. Elizabeth resigned her rights in her father's inheritance to Margaret in 1379, so leaving the way clear for Margaret to transfer the earldom of Angus to George ten years later. A woman of strong personality, Margaret is recorded as defying attempts made in the king's name to dislodge her from Tantallon Castle, Haddingtonshire, in 1388. She may have lived until 1418.<br>
