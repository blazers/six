<span class="headword">Bainbridge,  Francis Arthur</span>  (1874&#150;1921), <span class="occ">physiologist</span>, was born on 29 July 1874 at Stockton-on-Tees, co. Durham, the elder son of Robert Robinson Bainbridge, a chemist, and his wife, Mary Sanderson. Educated at the Leys School, Cambridge, where his contemporaries included Joseph Barcroft and Henry Dale, he gained an entrance scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1893. He studied physiology and took a first class in both parts of the natural sciences tripos (1895 and 1897). He then entered St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, to complete his medical training, obtaining his Cambridge MB degree in 1901 and the MD in 1904.<br>
<br>At this period medicine did not appeal to Bainbridge, and seeing no permanent opening in pure physiology, he devoted himself for a time to pathology and bacteriology. In 1905 he became Gordon lecturer on pathology at Guy's Hospital, where he began studies on urine secretion by the frog kidney, to which he was to return later. In the same year he married Hilda Winifred, daughter of the Revd Edward Thornton Smith, of Bickley, Kent, with whom he had one daughter. In 1907 he went as assistant bacteriologist to the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, where his study and classification of paratyphoid and food-poisoning bacilli gained wide recognition, and formed the basis of his Milroy lectures at the Royal College of Physicians (1912). Throughout this period he had carried out research in the physiological laboratory at University College, encouraged particularly by Ernest Starling. In 1911 Bainbridge became professor of physiology at Durham University and was able to devote himself to physiology. Bainbridge joined the RAMC in 1914 and combined the duties of his chair with those of a medical officer at a local hospital. In 1915, when a chair of physiology was instituted at St Bartholomew's Hospital, he returned to London to fill the post, which he occupied until his premature death, at his home, 37 Clarence Gate Gardens, London, on 27 October 1921. He was elected FRS in 1919.<br>
<br>Bainbridge was of slight physique and had indifferent health. He was not regarded as an impressive teacher, though his lucidity of mind rendered him a very successful one. However, he was a brilliant experimenter, who gave careful thought beforehand to proposed research, and possessed both ingenuity in devising experiments and high technical skill in carrying them out. Thus his contributions to physiological science were of lasting value. Among these were his early work on the activity of lymph gland cells and the mechanism of lymph formation, on urinary secretion and the effect of partial removal of the kidneys, and on the physiology of the gall bladder, and his studies on the circulation. In this last work he established that an increase of pressure on the venous side of the heart acted as a stimulus, which through the nervous system accelerated the rate of the beat, a control mechanism he discovered to be partly due to depression of the vagus nerve, and partly due to the stimulation of the sympathetic supply to the heart. Apart from numerous scientific papers, Bainbridge produced a scholarly monograph on <span class="italic">The Physiology of Muscular Exercise</span> (1919), a masterly review of the subject, and with his former colleague from Durham, J. A. Menzies, wrote <span class="italic">Essentials of Physiology</span> (1914).<br>
