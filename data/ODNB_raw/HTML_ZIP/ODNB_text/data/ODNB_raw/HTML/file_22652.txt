<span class="headword">Powell, Sir  John</span>  (1645&#150;1713), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was born on 26 May 1645 in Gloucester, the eldest son of John Powell (<i>d</i>. 1666) of Dewsall, Herefordshire, and also Gloucester, and his wife, Bridget (<i>d</i>. in or after 1666). Powell's father was mayor of Gloucester in 1663 after the corporation had been purged. Powell was possibly the man admitted to Brasenose College, Oxford, on 21 May 1664, and he definitely entered the Inner Temple in 1664 and was called to the bar in 1671. He had succeeded his father in 1666. He was elected a common councilman of Gloucester in 1672, under the new charter, and was town clerk from 1674 to 1685. Powell was elected to the 1685 parliament by the freemen of Gloucester in defiance of the duke of Beaufort. Beaufort had him removed from the town clerkship in September 1685, but Powell took legal action and regained his place in 1687. Beaufort believed that Powell supported James II's religious policies and he was probably the John Powell who agreed to all three of James II's &#145;three questions&#146;, and who was nominated as a commissioner of inquiry into recusant fines in Herefordshire and Shropshire in December 1687. He was also recommended as a court candidate for the abortive parliament of 1688.<br>
<br>Powell was created a serjeant-at-law in May 1689. He ceased to be Gloucester's town clerk on his appointment as a baron of the exchequer on 31 October 1691, and he was knighted on 4 November 1691. Originally he had been intended as a judge of common pleas, but the master of the rolls, Sir John Trevor, had objected. Powell was transferred to common pleas on 26 October 1695 and following the accession of Queen Anne he was promoted to queen's bench. As a judge he thus took part in the <i>Ashby v. White</i> case over the franchise at Aylesbury, the Tutchin case over the publication of <span class="italic">The Observator</span>, and the prosecution of the Sacheverell rioters. Swift described him to Stella in July 1711 as &#145;an old fellow with grey hairs, who was the merriest old gentleman I ever saw, spoke pleasing things and chuckled till he cried again&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). On 4 March 1712 he presided at the trial of Jane Wenham, the last person to be convicted of witchcraft in England. Though Wenham was found guilty and sentenced to death, Powell&#151;who had expressed doubts over the evidence&#151;first ensured that the sentence was reprieved and later secured her a royal pardon. The trial was also noteworthy for Powell's alleged comment, following a claim that Wenham could fly, that &#145;There is no law against flying&#146;  (Guskin, 53). On 2 June 1713 Powell was discharged from his duties, presumably on account of his age and ill health because he died a few days later on 14 June at his house in Gloucester after returning from Bath.<br>
<br>Powell's will revealed that most of his estate had been settled on the marriage earlier in 1713 of John Snell MP with his &#145;niece&#146; Anna Maria, the daughter of Robert Huntindon, bishop of Raphoe. Powell was buried in Gloucester Cathedral and a monument was erected by Snell to his memory.<br>
