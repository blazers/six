<span class="headword">Standen, Sir  Anthony</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1615), <span class="occ">adventurer and spy</span>, was the eldest of (at least) four sons and four daughters of Edmund Standen, esquire (<i>d</i>. 1571), of East Molesey, Surrey, which lies adjacent to the royal palace of Hampton Court. Anthony's younger brother Edmund (<i>d</i>. 1603) served as a clerk of the petty bag of chancery for much of the reign of Elizabeth I, having begun his career as a servant to Robert Fleetwood, a clerk of the petty bag in the 1550s. He himself aspired to success at Elizabeth's court, where he attached himself to the countess of Lennox and her son Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley. However, when Darnley became engaged to Mary, queen of Scots, in 1565, Standen followed him to Scotland, taking with him a younger brother who was also named Anthony (<i>d</i>. 1611). Standen's position was variously described as first esquire or master of the horse to the new royal consort, while his younger namesake served as cupbearer. Standen later claimed to have saved Queen Mary's life during the murder of David Riccio on 9 March 1566&#151;an incident which he described in great and probably exaggerated detail when trying to curry favour after James VI's accession as king of England. He was supposedly later knighted by Darnley at Mary's request, although he was not known as Sir Anthony Standen in England until 1595. Having been given a licence to travel for two years, Standen was in France during 1567&#150;8, when Darnley was murdered and Mary driven from power in Scotland. His younger brother returned to England, but Standen became an exile. By late 1568 he was cultivating the English ambassador in France in the hope of regaining favour with Queen Elizabeth, and reporting on alleged foreign plans for intervention in Scotland.<br>
<br>Like some other English Catholic exiles during this period, Standen began to promise all things to all sides in the hope of earning money to sustain himself, while capitalizing on the contacts he made as an exile to play a part in international politics which would otherwise have been impossible. After a period in France, he won a pension in Spain in 1571 and subsequently based himself in Flanders. Standen apparently lost this pension and was forced to leave the Low Countries in 1576 after an affair with Barbara von Blomberg, a former mistress of the late Emperor Charles V and the mother of Don John of Austria, who was now the governor of the Netherlands. He subsequently travelled as far as Constantinople before settling in Florence, where he became a servant to the wife of Francesco de' Medici, grand duke of Tuscany, thanks to a recommendation from Mary, queen of Scots. He claimed to be acting as the imprisoned queen's agent in Florence during the 1580s, although he was also in semi-regular correspondence with Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's chief spymaster and Mary's bitter enemy, from at least 1582. Standen and Walsingham may have met during the latter's period as English ambassador in France in the early 1570s. Walsingham offered Standen cash and the prospect of winning &#145;reintegration to her Highnes favour&#146; after his &#145;youthfull forfayte&#146;  (LPL, MS 648, fol. 37<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>In 1587, after Mary's execution and then the rapid-fire deaths of the grand duke and duchess of Tuscany, Standen found himself out of favour in Florence. He now made himself one of Walsingham's most important spies for tracking Spanish military preparations during the great Armada crisis of 1587&#150;8. Supplementing his own efforts with news gathered by other agents he had recruited, Standen wrote regular reports to Walsingham under the pseudonym of Pompeio Pellegrini. He twice visited Spain himself, and was even directed by Walsingham to use his contacts with Spanish spymasters to make a last desperate overture for new back-channel peace negotiations. Elizabeth and Walsingham were so pleased with Standen's work that he was granted a pension of &pound;100 per annum in 1588.<br>
<br>In 1590 Standen's Spanish paymasters sent him to Bordeaux, where he assumed the identity of Andr&eacute; Sandal. This brought him close to disaster. Arrested as a Spanish spy, he discovered that Walsingham's recent death had left him without either an English protector or access to English money. Standen was destitute in prison when he finally managed to contact Anthony Bacon, who was then convalescing in Bordeaux. Bacon was not only a close relative of Lord Burghley, lord treasurer of England, but had himself sent intelligence reports to Walsingham during his travels, and he now helped to secure Standen's release in 1591 and won him Burghley's patronage. After returning to Spain, Standen (using an alias recorded as Mons. La Faye) co-operated with Anthony Rolston, another English exile who took pay from both sides, to gather intelligence for Bacon and Burghley. However, Bacon fell out with Burghley after his return to England in 1592 and became a fervent partisan of Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, who aspired to replace Burghley as Elizabeth's chief councillor. In 1593 Standen was ordered to Flanders by his Spanish paymaster, but his cover was allegedly blown during a stop at Calais, and Bacon hastily arranged for his friend's reception in England by Essex. Standen subsequently became a focus of tensions between Essex and Burghley and the latter's son, Sir Robert Cecil, whose influence ensured that Standen received little favour from the queen.<br>
<br>The following years were deeply frustrating for Standen, whose regular attendance at court brought small reward. Like Bacon, he became a devoted &#145;friend&#146; of Essex. In 1596 and 1597 he accompanied the earl on his naval expeditions to Cadiz and the Azores, and he also joined Essex's great Irish expedition of 1599. Essex probably appointed Standen to a bureaucratic post in Ireland, because he was granted a healthy pension there of 5<i>s</i>. per day and did not accompany Essex back to England after the expedition ended in disaster in September 1599. Standen remained in Ireland for three years, thereby avoiding direct entanglement in Essex's final fall and execution, which was soon followed by the death of Bacon, both in 1601. Late in that year, when he offered his services to Cecil, he claimed that his chief abode was with Mabel, dowager countess of Kildare, a woman who had long been regarded as a Catholic &#145;subversive&#146; by the Dublin authorities.<br>
<br>When news reached Ireland of Elizabeth's death and the accession of James I, Standen wasted no time in returning to England, arriving there in mid-April 1603. He now sought to capitalize on his earlier career as a servant of James's parents, even petitioning for arrears on wages owed to him and his brother Anthony from the 1560s. In July 1603, to the surprise of many observers, Standen was chosen by James to carry news of his accession to Lorraine, Venice, and Florence. He was not an official ambassador and there is much about the mission that is mysterious. James probably hoped that Standen would exploit his Italian contacts to ensure good will for James among Catholic princes and forestall any hostility by the pope. However, the very latitude allowed to Standen gave him delusions of grandeur and he repeatedly ruffled diplomatic feathers during his journey. In France he antagonized the English ambassador, Sir Thomas Parry, and was judged a loose and boastful talker by French ministers. In Italy Standen met Edmund Thornhill, an equally ambitious Englishman who was a canon at Vicenza. Together they promoted a scheme to advance toleration for Catholics in England by trying to encourage contacts between Pope Clement VIII and James's wife, Queen Anne. They claimed that Anne could be used to convert James and ultimately his subjects. It is uncertain whether this venture represented simply an extravagant scheme to win fame and fortune on an international scale or a genuine commitment to religious toleration by Standen. Either way, the venture was spectacularly ill-timed because the high hopes which English Catholics had attached to James's accession had already begun to attract an official backlash. When Standen returned to England in early 1604, he was accused of corresponding with the Jesuit Robert Persons and sent to the Tower. Although an indiscreet letter from Standen to Persons had been seized in Paris (probably by the Scottish spy John Colville, acting with Parry's encouragement), James's chief cause of anger may have been that Standen's activities threatened to direct unwelcome attention to his queen's Catholicism.<br>
<br>Standen was released from the Tower after a few months and was granted a licence to travel abroad again in July 1605. He subsequently breached the conditions of his passport by travelling to Rome, where he seems to have spent the final years of his life. In 1615 he was reported as spending time there with the exiled Hugh O'Neill, second earl of Tyrone. Nothing further is recorded of him, and perhaps appropriately for a man who lived a life of sustained deceit and was &#145;conformable to our English proverbe of the rowling stone&#146;  (LPL, MS 648, fol. 266<i>v</i>), the date and place of his death remain uncertain.<br>
