<span class="headword">Llewelyn,  Mary Catherine  Pendrill</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Mary Catherine Rhys]</span>  (1811&#150;1874), <span class="occ">writer and translator</span>, was born on 12 March 1811 at Cowbridge, Glamorgan, the daughter of Thomas Rhys (1778&#150;1851), schoolmaster, and his first wife, Joanna (<i>c</i>.1775&#150;1815). Educated first at home, she later attended an academy for young ladies at Swansea. She displayed early signs of a literary and artistic flair, and was influenced by Edward Williams (Iolo Morganwg), in whose company she spent many of her childhood evenings. She met her future husband, <a href="#cosubject_73775">Richard Pendrill Llewelyn (1813&#150;1891) [<i>see below</i>]</a>, while he studied in Cowbridge. The two were well matched, as they shared a deep interest in Welsh culture and both were mildly eccentric characters. Rejecting her father's wishes in the matter, she chose to marry Llewelyn, a poor curate: their clandestine marriage took place at Clifton on 25 January 1837. They lived initially at Blaen-gwrach, Glamorgan, before moving to Sussex, where their first two children were born. On returning to Glamorgan in 1841 they took up residence at Llangynwyd vicarage. This was Mary's home for the rest of her life; she had seven more children and did the bulk of her writing here. The living of Llangynwyd was meagre, and the Llewelyns had no money of their own: with the cares of raising a large family and managing a penurious household, Mary Llewelyn's literary work was done in most unfavourable circumstances.<br>
<br>In 1845 the Llewelyns contributed letters, signed &#145;R &amp; M&#146;, to <span class="italic">The Cambrian</span> regarding their collected folklore of Llangynwyd parish, including the first appearance in writing of &#145;The Maid of Cefn Ydfa&#146;, which became a nationally known Welsh folk story. Mary Llewelyn published much poetry of her own, in English and Welsh, notably in <span class="italic">The Cambrian</span> and the <span class="italic">Cardiff and Merthyr Guardian</span>; she also contributed &#145;sacred sonnets&#146; and hymns to the <span class="italic">Church of England Magazine</span>. Her translations were mainly of hymns and popular ballads. She published <span class="italic">Hymns Translated from the Welsh</span> (1850), chiefly those of William Williams, Pantycelyn. John Jones (Tegid) hailed her as &#145;one of the &hellip; very best translators of Welsh poetry&#146;, linking her name with those of Charlotte Guest and Maria Jane Williams as women whose work would assist towards rekindling Welsh nationality and the revival of Welsh literature and music  (<span class="italic">Archaeologia Cambrensis</span>, 1846, 185). Mary Llewelyn died of cancer on 19 November 1874.<br>

<a name="cosubject_73775"></a><span class="headword">Richard  Pendrill Llewelyn</span>  (1813&#150;1891), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 5 August 1813 at Laleston, Glamorgan, the son of Thomas Llewelyn (<i>c</i>.1788&#150;1818), farmer, and his wife, Jane Pendrill (1788&#150;1872), a descendant of John Penderel of Boscobel. He was educated at the Eagle Academy of Thomas Rhys and at the Cowbridge divinity school. In 1838 he received the Lambeth degree of MA. He became vicar of Llangynwyd in 1841 and served there for fifty years. A prominent evangelical clergyman, he published historical work, notably on Samuel Jones, his seventeenth-century predecessor at Llangynwyd. He gave his wife every possible support and encouragement in all her literary endeavours. He died on 22 October 1891; both Llewelyns were buried at Llangynwyd.<br>
