<span class="headword">Wood <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Vining]</span>,  Matilda Charlotte</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Mrs John Wood]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1831, <em>d.</em> 1915), <span class="occ">actress and theatre manager</span>, was baptized on 28 November 1831 at St Peter's Church, Liverpool, the second daughter of the actors Henry Vining and Amelia Vining, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Quantrell (1803/4&#150;1874) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53565/', "Vining family")</script>]. Despite going on the stage when she was ten, Matilda Vining, whose &#145;forte was low comedy&#146;  (<span class="italic">ILN</span>, 28 Feb 1885), came to prominence in England only in the late 1860s after gaining a reputation in America, principally in burlesque, and reached the height of her success in the 1880s in farces by Pinero. Her first stage appearance was in 1841 in Brighton. Shortly afterwards she joined a company playing in Southampton, where, on 25 March 1848, she married an actor, John William Wood (<i>d</i>. 1863), the son of John Wood, a silversmith; both declared that they were &#145;of full age&#146;. She thereafter was known as Mrs John Wood. In October 1849 the couple joined John Knowles's company at Manchester Theatre Royal, where Mrs Wood's cousin George J. Vining (1824&#150;1875) was already engaged and where they came to be regarded as the leading comedians. While Mrs Wood played principally &#145;pert waiting women or the heroines of extravaganzas&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 10 May 1853), she also sang, and she exhibited a rare &#145;sweetness and pathos&#146; when appearing as Ophelia to George Vandenhoff's Hamlet in May 1853  (ibid.).<br>
<br>In August 1854 the Woods sailed for America. Mrs John Wood won immediate acclaim when she appeared in Boston, under Thomas Barry's management, on 11 September 1854, as Gertrude in Planch&eacute;'s <span class="italic">The Loan of a Lover</span>. She also played at Wallack's Theatre, New York, in California, and in New Orleans. Her first experience of management was at the American Theatre, San Francisco, in 1859. Her husband, from whom she had separated, died in May 1863. Again undertaking management she reopened Laura Keene's theatre in New York on 8 October 1863 as the Olympic. Among other roles she played Jenny Leatherlungs in the burlesque <span class="italic">Jenny Lind at Last</span>. Her management lasted three years.<br>
<br>Mrs Wood's London d&eacute;but was on 12 November 1866 at the Princess's Theatre, then managed by George Vining, as Miss Miggs in a dramatization of Dickens's novel <span class="italic">Barnaby Rudge</span>. Here, too, she created the part of Pocahontas in <span class="italic">La Belle Sauvage</span>. After a further visit to America she leased the St James's Theatre, London, which had been closed for ten months, and opened it on 16 October 1869 with <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span>. A month later <span class="italic">La Belle Sauvage</span> began its 197-night run; there were successful productions also of John Poole's <span class="italic">Paul Pry</span>, <span class="italic">Fernande</span> (in which Fanny Brough made her London d&eacute;but), <span class="italic">Anne Bracegirdle</span>, and <span class="italic">Jenny Lind at Last</span>.<br>
<br>In 1872 Mrs Wood sub-let the St James's and went again to America, but returned to London a year later to appear at the Queen's Theatre on 15 November 1873 as Philippa Chester in Charles Reade's <span class="italic">The Wandering Heir</span>, at the opening of the Criterion Theatre on 21 March 1874 in the title role in H. J. Byron's <span class="italic">The American Lady</span>, and at the Gaiety as Mistress Page in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>. After a further spell of management at the St James's she played in 1879&#150;81 at the Haymarket and Criterion theatres, then appeared in central roles in a number of plays by Pinero at the Royal Court. When the Royal Court was rebuilt in 1888 she undertook the management herself, although she leased the theatre in partnership with Arthur Chudleigh. It opened on 24 September, when Mrs Wood's daughter Florence (whose father was &#145;Stephen Fiske, gentleman&#146;) played the title part in <span class="italic">Hermine</span>. Among the successes of Mrs Wood's nine-year management were Pinero's <span class="italic">The Cabinet Minister</span> and the farces <span class="italic">Aunt Jack</span> and <span class="italic">The Volcano</span> by Ralph Lumley (1865&#150;1900), who married Florence in 1890.<br>
<br>Mrs Wood refused ever to give an interview, believing that &#145;artists should be silent off stage&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Sketch</span>, 10 Oct 1894). On stage, however &#145;her intelligence and experience made the most of a strong natural humour&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 Jan 1915). A pen portrait of her in 1874, which praised her as the &#145;Queen of comedy and song&#146;, commented: &#145;To a piquant chic peculiarly French and derived doubtless from the Quantrells&#151;her ancestors upon the mother's side&#151;she adds a frank-hearted humour &hellip; [She is] a female Charles Mathews&#146;  (<span class="italic">ILN</span>, 1874).<br>
<br>Mrs Wood's final years on the stage were spent principally in minor comic roles at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. In 1905 she played the part of Margaret Neilson for 105 performances there in Hall Caine's <span class="italic">The Prodigal Son</span>. Her last appearance was at the Ellen Terry jubilee celebration matin&eacute;e, again at Drury Lane, on 12 June 1906, with Gertrude Kingston (1866&#150;1937) and Genevieve Ward (1838&#150;1922) as &#145;seats on the bench&#146; in Gilbert and Sullivan's <span class="italic">Trial by Jury</span>. She died on 11 January 1915 at her home, Dilkoosha, Spencer Road, Birchington, Kent, and was buried on 16 January at the parish church.<br>
