<span class="headword">Moseley,  Henry Gwyn Jeffreys</span>  (1887&#150;1915), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19389/', "Henry Nottidge Moseley (1844&#150;1891)")</script>, Linacre professor of anatomy in the University of Oxford, and his wife, Amabel Nevile Gwyn Jeffreys (<i>d</i>. 1927), was born at Weymouth on 23 November 1887, and educated at Summerfields School, Oxford (1896&#150;1901), then at Eton College, of which he was a king's scholar, and at Trinity College, Oxford, where he was a Millard scholar, graduating with honours in natural science in 1910. On both sides he was descended from families of great scientific ability. His paternal grandfather, Henry Moseley FRS, was professor of natural philosophy at King's College, London, and his maternal grandfather, John Gwyn Jeffreys FRS, was a specialist on molluscs. Moseley soon showed marked originality of mind and interest in science. As an undergraduate he pursued his studies with great determination, with a preference for his own methods; he also rowed every year for the college.<br>
<br>Immediately after graduation he was appointed lecturer in physics in the University of Manchester and began research under the direction of Professor Ernest Rutherford. He soon developed into a rapid and skilful experimenter with unusual powers of continuous work, and showed to a marked degree that combination of practical ability and philosophic insight so necessary for attacking new and difficult problems. Following a number of important investigations in the subject of radioactivity Moseley began, with C. G. Darwin (grandson of Charles Darwin), that work on the X-ray spectra of the elements with which his name is inseparably connected. Following up the demonstration of X-ray diffraction by Max von Laue, W. H. Bragg, and W. L. Bragg had already shown that the wavelength of X-rays could be determined by the crystal method, and had found evidence of bright lines superimposed on the continuous spectrum. Moseley's fellowship having expired, he returned to Oxford to live with his mother and to be on the spot should a position open in the university. He continued his work in the electrical laboratory directed by J. S. Townsend. There he examined systematically the relation between the bright line X-ray spectra given by different elements; he found that all the elements gave similar types of spectra, and that the frequency of vibration of corresponding lines was proportional to the square of a number <i>M</i> which varied by unity in passing from one element to the next. From these observations, he was able to draw conclusions of far-reaching importance in connection with the constitution of atoms.<br>
<br>Shortly before Moseley began his survey of the high frequency spectra of the elements Rutherford had revived the nuclear model of the atom in which the charge <i>Z</i> on the nucleus, rather than the number of electrons orbiting around it, determined the character of the atom. Rutherford's theory of the scattering of alpha particles, on which he had based his atomic model, required that <i>Z</i> = 2 for helium and <i>Z</i> &asymp; <i>A</i>/2 for heavy metals, where <i>A</i> is the atomic weight of the metal, counting hydrogen's weight as one. Moseley knew these results, which were obtained during his time at Manchester, and he supposed that his <i>M</i> was related to Rutherford's <i>Z</i>. Since <i>Z</i> for helium had to be two, <i>Z</i> for hydrogen evidently was one. Examining the X-ray spectra from the metals from copper through calcium, Moseley determined that the ordinal number <i>N</i> of their place in the periodic table of the elements differed by one unit from <i>M</i>, making irresistible the inference <i>M</i> + 1 = <i>N</i> = <i>Z</i>. On this understanding he called the roll of the elements: if he could not find a specimen that emitted spectra characterized by a given value of <i>M</i> he inferred that the corresponding element had not been discovered and kept a place open for it at <i>N</i> = <i>M</i> + 1. After a few erroneous assignments resulting from haste and the difficulty of procuring rare samples and handling their radiations, he deduced that four elements were missing between aluminium (<i>N</i> = 13) and gold (<i>N</i> = 79), at <i>N</i> = 43, 61, 72, and 75. In this he was almost right; but accepting the opinion of many chemists, he incorrectly identified 72 as a rare earth. Numbers 72 and 75 soon were found in ores of their chemical homologues, zirconium and manganese respectively; the first and second numbers (43 and 61), which do not exist naturally, were first made in a cyclotron and in a nuclear pile, respectively. Moseley's law that an element's main properties are determined by a whole number defining its nuclear charge ranks in importance with the discoveries of the periodic law of the elements and of spectrum analysis, and is in many respects more fundamental than either.<br>
<br>The difference of one unit between <i>M</i> and <i>N</i> = <i>Z</i> naturally aroused great interest. Moseley explained that the effective nuclear charge acting on the electrons that he held responsible for the production of the line spectra was less than <i>Z</i> owing to screening by electrons closer to the nucleus. He tried to derive a screening of one unit from the quantized version of the nuclear atom that Niels Bohr had proposed during Moseley's last year in Manchester. His ingenious attempt to show that <i>Z</i><sub>eff</sub> = <i>M</i>, though premature, was later justified when the mechanisms of X-ray emission on the Bohr theory were worked out.<br>
<br>In 1914 Moseley travelled with his mother to Australia to attend the meeting of the British Association. He returned to England in order to enlist at once in the New Army, and he obtained his commission as lieutenant in the Royal Engineers. He took part in the Gallipoli campaign, and was killed in action in the Dardanelles on 10 August 1915 at the age of twenty-seven. He was buried at Gallipoli. He was unmarried and had no girlfriend; he found his satisfaction in intense and continuous work, which allowed him to complete during two years at the outset of his career a set of researches that would surely have brought him a Nobel prize. The premature death of a young man of such brilliant promise and achievement was everywhere recognized as an irreparable loss to science. His friends and scientific admirers in many countries united to erect a memorial tablet in the physical laboratory of the University of Manchester. He bequeathed his property to the Royal Society to aid scientific research, and a studentship bearing his name was instituted.<br>
