<span class="headword">Steell, Sir  John Robert</span>  (1804&#150;1891), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 18 September 1804 at Aberdeen, eldest son of John Steell (<i>fl</i>. 1800&#150;1829), a woodcarver and gilder, and his wife, Margaret Gourlay of Dundee. He was the elder brother of the animal painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26351/', "Gourlay Steell")</script>. Within a year of his birth Steell's family moved to Edinburgh where he was apprenticed as a woodcarver to his father and attended classes at the Trustees' School of Design. On the completion of his apprenticeship in 1824 Steell went into business with his father at 6 Hanover Street, Edinburgh. Two years later, on 30 November 1826, he married Elizabeth Graham, the daughter of an Edinburgh merchant, and the following year he received his first important independent commission. This was for a colossal oak statue of St Andrew for the fa&ccedil;ade of the Edinburgh office of the North British and Mercantile Insurance Company (dem.). In 1829 Steell studied in Rome for several months before returning to Edinburgh and establishing his own practice as a sculptor.<br>
<br>The work that first brought Steell to public notice was his 1832 equestrian group <span class="italic">Alexander and Bucephalus</span>. For this work he was awarded a special prize of &pound;50 from the board of manufactures (the governing body of the Trustees' School of Design) and in 1833 was granted a special public exhibition of the work for six weeks at the Royal Institution, Edinburgh. When exhibited in London later in the year the work attracted the attention of Sir Francis Chantrey who encouraged Steell to move to London and offered him help to do so. Steell declined the invitation and chose instead to stay in Edinburgh to devote himself to the improvement of art in Scotland.<br>
<br>In Edinburgh, Steell's rapid rise to success continued under the influence of early patrons such as Thomas Thomson, Lord Meadowbank, and the fifth earl of Buccleuch. He became the first sculptor resident in Scotland to obtain royal patronage when in 1838 Queen Victoria granted him several sittings at Windsor Castle for a portrait bust and statue (freestone, completed 1844; Royal Institution, Edinburgh). In the same year he became the first Scottish artist to receive a public commission for a marble statue, that of Sir Walter Scott (completed 1846) for the Scott monument in Edinburgh. This was followed immediately by a commission for a statue of Professor Blaikie (completed 1844) for Aberdeen, which became the first statue in marble completed in Scotland. As well as introducing large-scale marble carving to Scotland, Steell was also responsible for the first pediment group in stone that was carved in Scotland, his 1839 representation of the wise and foolish virgins for the Standard Life Assurance office at 3 George Street, Edinburgh. Of even greater importance, between 1848 and 1852 Steell introduced artistic bronze casting to Scotland when he established a foundry at Grove Street, Edinburgh. This was built initially to cast his equestrian statue for the Scottish national memorial to the duke of Wellington (1852; Princes Street, Edinburgh), but it was later used to cast all of his bronzes and was also used by other artists for the casting of their work.<br>
<br>John Steell was the most outstanding nineteenth-century Scottish sculptor. His early work tended to allegorical and narrative subject matter and he was frequently commissioned for wood- or stone-carving for architectural projects. During the 1830s he attracted increasing numbers of influential Scottish patrons, most of whom commissioned portrait works either in the form of a classicizing bust or funerary monument. By the mid-1840s he had established an international reputation and in doing so he brought unprecedented recognition to sculpture in Scotland. Throughout his lifetime Steell received at least twenty-eight commissions for large-scale commemorative monuments. These include <span class="italic">Robert Burns</span> (1874) and <span class="italic">Sir Walter Scott</span> (1870) for New York; the <span class="italic">Marquis of Dalhousie</span> (1863) and the <span class="italic">Rt Hon. James Wilson</span> (1865) for Calcutta; <span class="italic">Lord de Saumarez</span> (1854) for Greenwich Hospital; and a kneeling effigy of the countess of Elgin (1849) for Jamaica, as well as monumental portrait statues of sixteen of his most notable compatriots for the streets and gardens of Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and Dundee. His public statues in Edinburgh include <span class="italic">Dr Chalmers</span> (1878), <span class="italic">Allan Ramsay</span> (1865), and <span class="italic">Professor John Wilson</span> (1865) as well as <span class="italic">Lord Justice General Boyle</span> (1860) and <span class="italic">Lord Jeffrey</span> (1855) for the Faculty of Advocates. In Dundee he is represented by full-length statues of Sir David Baxter (1863), Robert Burns (1880), George Kinloch MP (1872), and the second Viscount Melville (1857). In addition Steell was a consistent supporter of annual art exhibitions. He exhibited at the Royal Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland from 1828 to 1830, at the Royal Scottish Academy between 1827 and 1880, at the Glasgow (later Royal Glasgow) Institute of the Fine Arts in 1864 and 1865, at Kirkcaldy in 1876, and at the Royal Academy on six occasions between 1837 and 1876. In addition his work was shown at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1889, 1916, and 1926.<br>
<br>A fusion of classical and contemporary elements characterizes Steell's work. His subjects are usually represented in contemporary dress which includes a garment that in form and fall is reminiscent of classical drapery. His portraiture tends to accurate likeness in which the more distinctive features are subtly refined and idealized. Many of his major works were reproduced in small-scale bronze and Parian marble versions. Two hundred such statuettes of his <span class="italic">Sir Walter Scott</span> and 100 copies of <span class="italic">Professor John Wilson</span> were distributed.<br>
<br>In the 1820s Steell was elected an associate of the Royal Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland and became a member of the Royal Scottish Academy on the amalgamation of the institution and the Scottish academy in 1829. In 1838 the honorary position of sculptor-in-ordinary to her majesty for Scotland was created for him. He was knighted for his services to Scottish art in 1876 after the unveiling of his largest project, the <span class="italic">Scottish National Memorial to the Prince Consort</span> (1876; Charlotte Square Gardens, Edinburgh). In 1884 a bronze of his <span class="italic">Alexander and Bucephalus</span> was erected in the City Chambers Courtyard, High Street, Edinburgh, as a public testimony to him.<br>
<br>From 1887, in poor health and the recipient of a civil list pension of &pound;100 per annum, Steell lived in complete retirement. A public sale of all his models and studio effects was held in March of the following year. He died at his home at 24 Greenhill Gardens, Edinburgh, on 15 September 1891 and was buried in the old Calton cemetery. He was survived by his daughter and two sons. His wife had predeceased him in 1885.<br>
