<span class="headword">Douglas, Sir  William</span>, lord of Liddesdale  (<em>c.</em>1310&#150;1353), <span class="occ">soldier and magnate</span>, was the eldest son of Sir James Douglas of Lothian, who was a young valet in 1306, and his wife, Joan. He had possession of his heritage in April 1323, when his father was dead, but seems not yet to have been of age; he was knighted between 1323 and 1330. In 1330 he was a warden of the marches, probably in succession to Sir James Douglas, his distant cousin, and this probably kept him in the south of Scotland when the &#145;disinherited&#146; attacked in 1332. On 25 March 1333, in response to a Scottish incursion into Cumberland (though the two realms were nominally still at peace), Sir Anthony Lucy raided across the Solway, and on his return was attacked by the garrison of Lochmaben, including Douglas of Lothian, as he was known. The Scots were beaten and Douglas was carried off to two years' captivity in Carlisle Castle. When back in Scotland he engaged with Edward Balliol's supporters in Galloway, attended the guardian's parliament at Dairsie in April 1335, and later in the same year served with the guardian (John Randolph, earl of Moray) in fighting the count of Namur, come to help Edward III, driving him into Edinburgh and securing his promise to depart the Scottish war. As Namur's escort made its way to the border it was set upon; the guardian was taken and Douglas was lucky to escape.<br>
<br>Douglas joined the new guardian, Sir Andrew Murray, in refusing the submission which others made to Edward III, and together they cornered and killed David Strathbogie, titular earl of Atholl, a leading supporter of Edward Balliol, at Culblean in Aberdeenshire on 30 November 1335. For his actions in leading the van, the Lanercost chronicle claims that Douglas was given the earldom of Atholl; but it is more likely that he was only promised the earldom. While Edward III was at Perth, and his brother John was ravaging in the south-west in 1336, the latter was harassed by Douglas, who in 1337 was active with Murray in Fife and elsewhere. In 1338, during a truce granted by Edward III, Douglas visited the court of David II at Ch&acirc;teau Gaillard, whence he came with a hired pirate and five galleys to the Tay in 1339. Perth was blockaded, and Douglas bribed the constable of Cupar Castle to surrender it and join in the assault on Perth, which surrendered on 17 August 1339. In 1341 he took part in the ruse which led to the taking of Edinburgh Castle (bogus supplies were lodged in the entrance, so that the gates could not be closed), and by the return of David II in that year he was outstanding among the military commanders on the patriotic side. He had charters of lands in various parts from Robert the Steward and others, possibly as part of the arrangements to finance his war.<br>
<br>The king saw Douglas's value and heaped rewards upon him: the earldom of Atholl, lands in Peeblesshire, Eskdale, and Ewesdale, and a charter of the barony of Dalkeith. He is not known to have used the title of Atholl. In February 1342 the Steward claimed Liddesdale, which Douglas opposed as guardian of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7924/', "William Douglas (c.1330&#150;1384)")</script>, the heir of Archibald Douglas (1294?&#150;1333). Archibald Douglas had in effect seized Liddesdale during wartime disturbance, and the council found for the Steward, to whom William Douglas promptly surrendered Atholl in return for Liddesdale. The whole transaction was clearly fixed to transfer Liddesdale to William's possession, and he is thereafter known as William Douglas of Liddesdale. But his ambitions now took him into more dangerous territory. Jealous of Sir Alexander Ramsay, who had won a high reputation in both war and tournament and was sheriff of Roxburgh, an office Douglas coveted, Douglas seized Ramsay while holding a sheriff court on 20 June 1342, and took him to Hermitage Castle in Liddesdale, where Ramsay died, in effect murdered. Douglas obtained a royal pardon, but the feud won him few friends.<br>
<br>In 1345 the truces with England came to an end, and when, in 1346, David II invaded England in support of the hard-pressed French king after Cr&eacute;cy, he and Douglas were taken prisoner at Nevilles Cross on 17 October 1346, fortunate not to be among the many dead. Douglas now languished in the Tower of London, but about 1348 became involved in the efforts of David II to secure liberty. By 1350 Edward III had once more conceded the title of king to David, and in November negotiations for the latter's release were under way at York. By the end of the year Douglas was in Scotland, evidently with a proposition that David II be ransomed for &pound;40,000, that he be succeeded, if he died childless, by a younger son of Edward III, and also that the &#145;disinherited&#146; be restored. Douglas was back in England with some kind of response by March 1351; negotiations were pushed ahead and Douglas was again allowed to go home. Eventually proposals were agreed at Newcastle, and David II returned to Scotland in November 1351 with Douglas to secure their acceptance. This they failed to do in a parliament held at Scone in February&#150;March 1352, though in February 1352 Edward III had given leave to all the Scots in his allegiance to join Douglas in putting down any Scots who rebelled against David over acceptance of the Newcastle terms.<br>
<br>Once more in prison, Douglas clearly despaired of a general political settlement and of his own freedom; it is not known why his ransom was not negotiated, when that of, for example, the earl of Fife seemed to give little trouble. Instead he entered into an agreement on 17 July 1352, whereby he promised allegiance to Edward, service in war except against Scots, free passage through his lands at all times to invade Scotland, and hostages, and he received in return the assurance of his English-occupied lands as well as release. In August 1353 he was back in Scotland, his treason still unknown, when his cousin William, later first earl of Douglas, the boy who in effect had lost Liddesdale in 1342, killed him in Williamhope, Ettrick Forest. He was buried at Melrose Abbey, Roxburghshire.<br>
<br>According to Bower, Douglas was killed in revenge for the death of Ramsay; but Fordun's annals, Bower's source for the death, do not make that claim. Nor does Fordun have the verdict passed by Bower, that Douglas was &#145;an energetic man when fighting, who endured much for the freedom of the kingdom, expert in war, faithful to his promises, a scourge of the English and a wall to the Scots&#146;  (Bower, 7.275). His career was also marred by cupidity for baronies and rents. He did not fear the risks of war, and showed considerable tactical skill in siege and battle, but the defeat of Nevilles Cross and consequent imprisonment seem to have altered his priorities and consigned him to the category of shameful Scot.<br>
<br>Douglas married an Elizabeth of unknown family before 1346. Their daughter, Mary, who was surrendered as a hostage in 1352, eventually returned to Scotland and married, but died without issue. In 1351 William had entailed his lands on the son of his deceased brother John, from whom the lords of Dalkeith and earls of Morton descended.<br>
