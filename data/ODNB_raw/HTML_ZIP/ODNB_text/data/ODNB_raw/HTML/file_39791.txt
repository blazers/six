<span class="headword">Disraeli <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Evans; <em>other married name </em>Lewis]</span>,  Mary Anne</span>, Viscountess Beaconsfield  (1792&#150;1872), <span class="occ">political wife</span>, was born in Exeter on 11 November 1792, the second surviving child and only daughter of John Evans (1760&#150;1794), naval lieutenant, and his wife, Eleanor Viney (<i>d</i>. 1842), daughter of James Viney, vicar of Bishopstrow, Wiltshire. After her father's premature death in the West Indies, Mary Anne Evans and her elder brother, John, were brought up by their mother at Brampford Speke, near Exeter, the home of her Evans grandparents, a family of Devon farmers. In 1807 Mary Anne and her mother moved to Gloucester to live with her uncle, Sir James Viney of College Green. She was poorly educated, even by early nineteenth-century standards (according to Benjamin Disraeli, she never could remember which came first, the Greeks or the Romans), and her handwriting was execrable; but she early on acquired the habit of keeping accounts and compiling albums. In 1810 she moved to Bristol, where her mother married a second husband, the shadowy and unsatisfactory Thomas Yate. Mary Anne's life at this stage is clouded by myths, some of them invented by her; Augustus Hare's story that she walked barefoot to work in a factory each morning is untrue, though she may have worked in a milliner's shop. Small and birdlike&#151;her feet were size four, her rings the size of a child's&#151;she was a vivacious flirt in Bristol society. In 1815 she married Wyndham Lewis (1778&#150;1838), fourteen years her senior and a wealthy ironmaster (he owned a one-fifth share in the Dowlais ironworks), and she went to live at Greenmeadow, near Cardiff, a small plain house, nestling under green hills and surrounded by dripping trees. She soon tired of the country, and as Wyndham Lewis grew rich on Dowlais profits, becoming MP for Cardiff (1820&#150;26), Mary Anne propelled herself into London society. In 1827 they moved into 1 Grosvenor Gate (now 93 Park Lane), a smart white stucco house belonging to the Grosvenor estate overlooking Hyde Park, and here she flourished in a whirl of parties, one foot in the marquess of Worcester's disreputable set (she had several affairs), another in the literati: she was a friend of Rosina, wife of Edward Bulwer Lytton, and it was through her that she met Benjamin Disraeli in 1832. &#145;A pretty little woman, a flirt and a rattle&#146;, was his verdict; but he made sufficient impression for Lewis to invite him at the last minute to come in as second tory member for Maidstone at the 1837 election.<br>
<br>In March 1838 Wyndham Lewis suddenly died. On 28 August 1839 Mary Anne married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7689/', "Benjamin Disraeli (1804&#150;1881)")</script>. Initially, at least, it was a match of expediency. Disraeli, desperately in debt, needed the wealthy widow's money; Mary Anne, who at forty-seven was twelve years older than Disraeli, was in no position to tarry. A thin, scrawny figure, outlandishly dressed in girlish pink satin and ringlets, she was mocked by the smart young men who revolved around Disraeli. Sir William Gregory found her repulsive&#151;&#145;flat, angular, under-bred, with a harsh, grating voice&#146;&#151;and her embarrassing remarks provided copy for countless unkind stories. She once announced, after learning that Lord Hardinge was sleeping in the room next to hers at a country house party, that she had slept between the greatest orator and the greatest soldier. &#145;You should see my Dizzy in his bath&#146;, she declared, when someone mentioned the beauty of white skin. Then there was the story of her remark about a picture of Venus and Adonis in her bedroom at a country house: &#145;I have been awake half the night trying to prevent Dizzy from looking at it.&#146;<br>
<br>But Mary Anne was not wholly ridiculous. That Disraeli's ascent of the greasy pole only began in earnest after his marriage was no coincidence. Her role was crucial. At elections she campaigned tirelessly and tactfully, winning over the shopkeepers estranged by Disraeli's offhand manner. She entertained, as the rising politician's wife must, but her real strength was less as hostess than as manager. Unstintingly generous in paying off Disraeli's debts, she advanced his creditors about &pound;4000 each year out of her income of approximately &pound;6500, running a very tightly budgeted domestic establishment in order to do so&#151;every expenditure, down to the very last cup of tea or spoonful of sugar, was costed in her account book. Each morning early while Disraeli slept Mary Anne digested <span class="italic">The Times</span>, scanned the reviews for references to her husband, and sorted through his post (this had its disadvantages). She cut his hair and paid his tailor. Above all, Mary Anne's earthy wit and native shrewdness enabled her to give the practical advice and support Disraeli most needed, and her unshakeable belief in his genius gave him the emotional anchor he lacked.<br>
<br>Nervous and prone to bouts of acute anxiety, when she became near-hysterical, Mary Anne was jealous of other women. She quarrelled with Disraeli's sister Sarah and with his brothers. As she grew older, she grew odder. Her stinginess was legendary. She once ordered a quarter pound of cheese from the shop at Hughenden (where their country house was), only to send it back next day when Disraeli returned unexpectedly to London; when the prince and princess of Teck came to stay, she ordered six rolls for breakfast. Despite the strains, and probably the occasional infidelity on Disraeli's part, they were a devoted couple. Driving down to the house one day in 1852 when Disraeli was to make an important speech, she slammed her hand painfully in the carriage door, but remained silent in order not to upset him. Disraeli never forgot how much he owed her. &#145;Why, my dear, you are more like a mistress than a wife&#146;, he famously remarked when he returned home late from the Carlton Club, after celebrating his triumph over the 1867 <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, to find the 75-year-old Mary Anne waiting up with a Fortnum and Mason's pie and a bottle of champagne.<br>
<br>On his resignation as prime minister in 1868, Disraeli persuaded Queen Victoria to create his wife Viscountess Beaconsfield in her own right. Cynics sneered; they little knew that Mary Anne was already gravely ill with stomach cancer. She battled bravely on, her face garishly painted, her body shrunken and swollen; she died at Hughenden on 15 December 1872, a heartbroken Dizzy by her side, and was buried at Hughenden church on 20 December. After her death he discovered that she had squirrelled away packets of his hair, as well as every scrap of paper he ever wrote&#151;the latter a devotion for which historians must be truly grateful.<br>
