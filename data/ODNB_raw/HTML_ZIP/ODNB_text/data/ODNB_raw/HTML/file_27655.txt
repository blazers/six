<span class="headword">Tradescant,  John, the younger</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1608, <em>d.</em> 1662), <span class="occ">gardener and collector</span>, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27654/', "John Tradescant the elder (d. 1638)")</script> and his wife, Elizabeth Day, was born at Meopham, Kent, and baptized there on 4 August 1608. He was educated between 1619 and 1623 at the King's School, Canterbury, while his father was in the service of Lord Wotton.<h2>
<a name="TravelstoVirginia"></a>Travels to Virginia</h2>On 29 February 1628 the younger Tradescant married Jane Hurte (<i>d</i>. 1635), who bore him a daughter, Frances (<i>c</i>.1628&#150;<i>c</i>.1667), and a son, John (1633&#150;1652). No record survives of his having been indentured, the Gardeners' Company records for the relevant period largely having been destroyed, but in 1634 he was admitted a freeman of the company. Three years later he made the first of three recorded visits to Virginia, when it was noted that &#145;In 1637 John Tradescant was in the colony, to gather all rarities of flowers, plants, shells, &amp;c&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP col.</span>, 1, no. 11). The presence of this record among the <span class="roman">State Papers</span> has been taken to imply that Tradescant's visit to Virginia was undertaken at the instigation of Charles I, a contentious conclusion but one supported by a statement by John Morris, master of the watermills, that he was there under the auspices of the king. The latter author mentions that Tradescant brought back with him &#145;a couple of hundred plants hitherto unknown to our world&#146;. Parkinson's <span class="italic">Theatrum botanicum</span> lists several species of these plants (burr reed, columbine, jasmine, cypress, and possibly the Virginian locust tree, as well as a variety of fern) &#145;which Mr. John Tradescant the younger, brought home with him from Virginia, this present yeare, 1638, presently after the death of his father&#146;  (Parkinson, 1045).<br>
<br>Thereafter Tradescant was appointed to his father's former position as gardener at the royal palace of Oatlands, while continuing to develop the garden associated with the family property at Lambeth. Estimates of the son's prowess are more difficult to find than for his father, but Morris accords him the highest honours in this field, describing him as &#145;most experienced in gardening matters&#146;  (Leith-Ross, 103) and delighting in exotic plants, while Hartlib, in his <span class="italic">Universal Husbandry Improved</span> (1650, p. 72), records that Tradescant &#145;daily raiseth new and curious things&#146;. Morris goes so far as to bracket Tradescant's name with those of Thomas Johnson and John Parkinson as &#145;those three great men of our native botanists&#146;&#151;an estimate to which due weight should be given since Morris had no very high opinion of Tradescant at a personal level  (Bekkers, 117).<br>
<br>In 1642, on the eve of England's collapse into civil war, Tradescant again took ship for Virginia, this time on his own account. The length of his stay is not known but was probably months rather than years. He continued to carry out his duties at Oatlands, perhaps up until the sale for demolition of the palace in 1650: in a bill dated 12 April 1648, now in the Ashmolean Library, he claims &pound;40 &#145;for work to be don for amending the Walks in the Vineyard Garden &amp; for repairing the Bowling Greene there&#146;. In 1653&#150;4 he made the round trip to Virginia for a third and final time.<h2>
<a name="TheTradescantmuseum"></a>The Tradescant museum</h2>Throughout this period Tradescant continued to support his family from the proceeds of his gardening activities as well as from income from the museum established by his father at Lambeth. Three years after the death of his wife Jane in 1635, on 1 October 1638, Tradescant married Hester Pooks: an incidental benefit of this match was the series of portraits of all three generations of Tradescants that survives in the Ashmolean Museum, mostly attributed to the brothers Emanuel and Thomas de Critz and to Cornelis de Neve, to all of whom Hester was related. In 1645 the eighteen-year-old Frances Tradescant was to marry Alexander Norman, a widower of fifty-six. Norman's first wife had been a sister of Frances's grandmother and in his capacity as cooper to the ordnance Norman had supplied Buckingham's expedition to the &Icirc;le de R&eacute; on which his new wife's grandfather had served. Norman's death is recorded in 1657 and Frances is thought to have died ten years later. Tradescant the younger's son John evidently followed in the footsteps of his elders&#151;Hartlib says that he was &#145;brought up to looke to the Botanical Garden and plants&#146;&#151;but in 1649 Hartlib records that his father was offering to part with the rarities in the museum in return for an annuity of &pound;100, the value of the collection being estimated at ten times that sum. When the youngest John Tradescant died at the age of nineteen in 1652, however, the collection remained unsold.<br>
<br>It is difficult to detect much in the way of tangible contributions made by the younger Tradescant to the museum, beyond a supposed leg-bone of the Hertfordshire giant Jack o' Legs and a fragment of the True Cross (which &#145;casually had been broken from&#146; a larger relic variously said to have belonged to Charles I or to Henrietta Maria, while it was in Tradescant's care). Tradescant himself, however, was proud to refer to the collection as &#145;those Rarities and Curiosities which my Father had scedulously collected, and my selfe with continued diligence have augmented, &amp; hitherto preserved together&#146;. The quotation comes from the preface to his <span class="italic">Musaeum Tradescantianum</span>, a 183-page octavo volume published in 1656&#151;the first museum catalogue to appear in England. The initiative for this volume (and also the funding for it) came from Elias Ashmole, whose influence looms large in later perceptions of the Tradescants' importance. Both Ashmole and Dr Thomas Wharton (who collaborated in the venture) evidently contributed considerably to the text of the catalogue, which bears a dedication to the president and fellows of the College of Physicians. Interestingly, in 1649 Hartlib recorded in his &#145;Ephemerides&#146; that the physician George Bate offered to endow a physic garden for the college, one possibility being that its basis would be formed by Tradescant's garden. The plant list included in <span class="italic">Musaeum Tradescantianum</span> contains a significantly greater proportion of medicinal plants than was grown by the elder Tradescant; however, no formal association with the college was to develop. The presence of significant numbers of food plants in the list may also hint at a degree of purposefulness on Tradescant's part, a conclusion reinforced by his persuasion by the arguments of his collaborators and voiced in the preface to <span class="italic">Musaeum Tradescantianum</span>, that the catalogue would be &#145;an honour to our Nation, and a benefit to such ingenious persons as would become further enquirers into the various modes of Natures admirable workes, and the curious Imitators thereof&#146;, sentiments which were to have their apotheosis when the collection formed the foundation of the Ashmolean Museum some years later.<h2>
<a name="AshmoleanMuseum"></a>Ashmolean Museum</h2>The transfer of the Tradescant collection to Oxford was not a straightforward matter. Deprived of his male heir and indebted to Ashmole for the large part he had played in publishing the catalogue of the museum (which was to be reprinted with a new dedication to Charles II in the year of the Restoration), Tradescant drew up in 1659 a deed of gift by which he left the museum collection to Ashmole; Hester was to retain a lifetime's interest in the collection. Almost immediately, it seems, Hester prevailed upon her husband to change his mind in this matter, as a result of which he drew up first one will, in which the collection was to be bequeathed to the king, and then another in which it was to go instead to the University of Oxford or of Cambridge, at the discretion of Hester, his executrix. These documents, whose existence was kept secret from Ashmole, were inevitably to become a source of bitter disagreement following Tradescant's death at Lambeth on 22 April 1662. (He was buried at St Mary's, Lambeth, on 25 April.)<br>
<br>Within a month Ashmole had preferred a bill of complaint in chancery, alleging that Hester was attempting to frustrate the terms laid out in the deed of gift drawn up in his favour; Hester vigorously resisted, citing the subsequent will and declaring her intention that the collection should go to Oxford. In May 1664 the case finally came before the lord chancellor, the earl of Clarendon, who found in favour of Ashmole, decreeing that he should &#145;have and enjoy all and singular these Bookes, Coynes, Medalls, Stones, Pictures, Mechanicks, Antiquities and all and every other the Raryties and Curiosities of what sort or kind soever&#146; (TNA: PRO Chancery Proceedings L33/221/774; Josten, 1966, vol. 3, 987&#150;8). Thereafter the collection remained in Hester's possession and relations seem for a while to have warmed between her and Ashmole, until in 1674 he decided to buy the property adjoining the Tradescant house, after which matters turned sour again with Hester accusing Ashmole of harassment and he ultimately demanding a written retraction of various alleged slanders. Subsequently Hester prevailed on him to take some parts of the collection into his own property and following her death by drowning in her garden pond on 4 April 1678 Ashmole took possession of the remainder. Thus it was through Ashmole that the collection was donated to Oxford (which intention he had signalled some eight years earlier) where, in 1683, the purpose-built Ashmolean Museum was formally inaugurated.<br>
<br>It has been held by later writers that in founding the institution in which his own name is commemorated, &#145;the name of Tradescant became unjustly sunk in that of Ashmole&#146;. There can be little doubt, however, that if the collection had passed directly to the university under the terms of Tradescant's second will and without the benefit of the terms Ashmole was able to exact for the provision of new premises and the institution of tightly drafted regulations of his own composition, the benefaction would have proved ephemeral in the extreme in its new environment. However much to the chagrin of the shades of Tradescant and his wife, Ashmole's intervention in their lives contributed not a little to the immortality of their name.<br>
