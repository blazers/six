<span class="headword">Dresser,  Christopher</span>  (1834&#150;1904), <span class="occ">designer and botanist</span>, was born on 4 July 1834 in Glasgow, the second son and third of six children of Christopher Dresser, excise officer, of Yorkshire, and his wife, Mary Nettleton, of Norton, near Doncaster, Yorkshire. The family was posted to Sussex in 1847 and Dresser was educated at the Government School of Design at Somerset House in London from 1847 to 1854. He became arguably the first industrial designer, identified by name on his work, which included ceramic, glass, metal, furniture, wallpapers, and textiles. He was influential as a theorist in Britain and America and anticipated, especially in his metalwork, the functional style of the modern movement.<br>
<br>The interests that provided a consistent source of inspiration throughout his career, botany and oriental art, developed while Dresser was still at the School of Design. He also came under the influence there of Henry Cole, Richard Redgrave, and Owen Jones, whose <span class="italic">Grammar of Ornament</span> of 1856 included Dresser's first published illustration.<br>
<br>Unlike William Morris, who was in some ways influenced by him, Dresser believed it necessary to co-operate with industry to bring well-made objects within reach of the widest possible public. He made a point of working with modern materials such as cast iron and linoleum. His design theory was based on the belief that natural forms should be abstracted and made geometric for use in ornamentation, and he likened the designer's mind to &#145;the vital force of the plant ever developing itself into forms of beauty&#146;. His personal motto was &#145;truth, beauty, power&#146;. His interest in natural sciences ran parallel with his design work at the beginning of his career, and his appointments included the chair of botany applied to the fine arts at the Department of Science and Art, South Kensington (1860), and the chair of ornamental art and botany at the Crystal Palace (1862). In 1854 he had married Thirza, daughter of William Perry, a lay missionary of Madeley, Shropshire. They had five sons and eight daughters, and Dresser's hectic career was driven in part by the need to support them all.<br>
<br>Among Dresser's first important writings were &#145;On the relation of science to ornamental art&#146;, a paper given to the Royal Institution in 1857, and <span class="italic">The Rudiments of Botany</span> and <span class="italic">Unity and Variety</span>, both of 1859. On the strength of the two latter he was awarded a doctorate by Jena University in 1860. He was always extremely proud of this and made a point of being known as Dr Dresser. He was disappointed in the same year when his application for the chair of botany at London University was unsuccessful.<br>
<br>In 1862 Dresser published <span class="italic">The Art of Decorative Design</span>. It shows the influence of A. W. N. Pugin and was important as the first popular book on design to show readers how to create designs themselves. In the battle of the styles, however, Dresser remained neutral, declaring that no style of ornament had yet arisen which had not possessed &#145;some beautiful feature&#146;. In 1880 he set up the Art Furnishers' Alliance at Bond Street to sell &#145;artistic house furnishing material&#146;. Gradually his scientific interests took less of Dresser's time. In 1876&#150;7 he made his first visit to Japan and this confirmed his admiration for oriental design and inspired much of his best work, as well as a book, <span class="italic">Japan: its Architecture, Art, and Art Manufactures</span> (1882). Dresser's unusually prominent role as a named designer and the &#145;rediscovery&#146; of his work in the 1930s have perhaps caused him to be overrated as an innovator. His work forms a distinguished part of Victorian design, but is not <i>sui generis</i>. Dresser died suddenly at the H&ocirc;tel Central, Mulhouse, Alsace, Germany, of a heart attack while on a business trip, on 24 November 1904, and was buried at Mulhouse in an unmarked grave. His work was largely forgotten until 1936 when Nikolaus Pevsner acclaimed him as one of the pioneers of modern design. A sketchbook of his designs is at Ipswich Museum.<br>
