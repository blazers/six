<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bennett,  Donald Clifford Tyndall</span>  (1910&#150;1986), <span class="occ">air force officer and politician</span>, was born on 14 September 1910 in Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia, the fourth and youngest son and youngest of the five children of George Thomas Bennett of Brisbane, cattle estate owner, and his wife, Celia Juliana Lucas. His sister died in early childhood. He was educated at Brisbane grammar school and enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force.<br>
<br>In 1931 Bennett was posted to England on a short-service commission in the Royal Air Force. He resigned in 1935 to join Imperial Airways, having successfully passed the examinations for a civil navigator's licence (first class) and both wireless operator's and ground engineer's licences. In 1938 he gained the world's long-distance record for seaplanes in a flight from Dundee in Scotland to Alexandra Bay in South-West Africa. In 1935 he married Elsa, daughter of Charles Gubler, jeweller, of Z&uuml;rich; they had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>In 1940, as flight superintendent of the Atlantic Ferry service, Bennett flew the first of thousands of American-built aircraft to the British Isles, a feat never before attempted in winter. Despite his technical brilliance and outstanding capacity for work, his relationship with his civilian masters was difficult and he returned to the RAF in 1941. He was posted to Leeming, Yorkshire, to command 77 squadron operating Whitley bombers and in April 1942 to 10 squadron, also at Leeming. During an attack on the <i>Tirpitz</i> in a Norwegian fjord his Halifax was shot down. After bailing out he escaped on foot to Sweden to be repatriated to Britain, where he was immediately awarded the DSO.<br>
<br>When the Air Ministry ordered Bomber Command to create an &eacute;lite target-finding force Bennett was the obvious choice to command it. Promotion followed swiftly and as air officer commanding 8 group his Pathfinder force successfully mastered the identification and marking of chosen targets. In 1943 he was accorded the rank of air vice-marshal. Although regarded by many as the architect of the efficiency of Bomber Command, his relationship with other long-serving bomber group commanders was not without friction. Few had any recent operational experience and most were reluctant to release their best crews to 8 group.<br>
<br>In 1945, having resigned his commission, Bennett was appointed chief executive of British South American Airways, a new airline founded by shipping interests. His policy of operating only British aircraft involved dependence upon a converted bomber, the Lancastrian, until the Avro Tudor was ready for service. The deficiencies of the airport facilities, together with the inexperience of the youthful crews, took their toll in accidents. In 1948, following the unexplained disappearance of a Tudor <i>en route</i> to Bermuda, the minister for civil aviation, Lord Nathan, grounded the remainder, pending an investigation. Convinced that the Tudor was perfectly airworthy, Bennett angrily denounced the minister to the national press. In the ensuing furore he refused to resign and was dismissed.<br>
<br>Almost at once the Russian blockade of road, rail, and river routes to West Berlin provided Bennett with an opportunity to prove the Tudor's merits. He founded Airflight, based at Langley, near Slough, equipping two Tudors as oil tankers and personally flying 250 sorties to Berlin. In May 1949 he registered a new company, Fairflight, based at Blackbushe, Hampshire. Charter flights to the Middle East and Far East were carried out before the company was sold in 1951.<br>
<br>At the invitation of Sir Archibald Sinclair, leader of the Liberal Party, Bennett stood for Middlesbrough West at a by-election in May 1945. He was unopposed but at the general election shortly afterwards he lost the seat to the Labour candidate. In 1948 he unsuccessfully contended North Croydon, and, in 1950, Norwich North. Thereafter the Liberal Party's enthusiasm for the European Economic Community and its defence policies alienated Bennett, whose upbringing was founded on pride in the empire and the merits of imperial preference. He left the Liberal Party in 1962 and five years later polled about 500 votes as a National Party candidate at a by-election in Nuneaton, Warwickshire. Although not a member of the National Front, he supported some of its policies, such as the voluntary repatriation of immigrants, when he organized, in 1969, the Association of Political Independents and, later, the independent democratic movement. He joined the National Council of Anti-Common Market Organizations and was its chairman from 1973 to 1976. From 1946 to 1949 he was chairman of the executive committee of the United Nations Association of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. His most notable publication, <span class="italic">The Complete Air Navigator</span> (1931), ran through many editions until 1967. He also wrote <span class="italic">The Air Mariner</span> (1938) and <span class="italic">Pathfinder</span> (1958), among other books. He was appointed CBE (1943) and CB (1944). The Russian government awarded him the order of Alexander Nevsky in 1944. For services to aviation he was awarded the Johnston memorial trophy in 1937 and 1938, and the Oswald Watt medal in 1938 and 1946. Bennett died on 15 September 1986 at Wexham Hospital, Buckinghamshire.<br>
