<span class="headword">Evans,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Wil Ifan]</span>  (1883&#150;1968), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 22 April 1883 at Vale View, Cwm-bach, Llanwinio, Carmarthenshire, the sixth son of the nine children of the Revd Dr Daniel Evans (1850&#150;1928) and Mary Davies (1853&#150;1932). His father was heavily involved in local politics and culture; he was also editor of the journal <span class="italic">Y Celt</span>. In 1890 he accepted a call to Cwmafan, near Port Talbot, and his son was educated at the local school, then Port Talbot county school (1893&#150;1900) and the University College of Wales, Bangor, where he graduated BA in 1905; he then spent a year at Mansfield College, Oxford.<br>
<br>Evans was ordained in 1906 at the English-speaking Congregational church at Dolgellau, and met there his future wife, Nesta Wyn Edwards (1883&#150;1968), an organist and a first-class honours graduate of the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. They were married on 28 December 1910 and settled at Bridgend, Glamorgan, where he had moved in 1909 as minister of the English Congregational church. In 1916 he accepted a call to Richmond Road English Congregational Church, Cardiff, but in 1925 he returned to Bridgend to serve as minister. He was well loved; the <span class="italic">Glamorgan Gazette</span> in 1925 referred to his &#145;winning gifts of rich humour, geniality and kindness&#146;.<br>
<br>By this time Evans had become a well-known bardic figure, having won the crown at the national eisteddfod of Wales on three occasions: in Abergavenny (1913), Birkenhead (1917), and Pwllheli (1925). He was extremely skilled at writing lyrics in both Welsh and English. The volumes <span class="italic">Songs of the Heather Heights</span> (1914), <span class="italic">A Quire of Rhymes: Short Poems</span> (1943), <span class="italic">Where I Belong</span> (1946), and <span class="italic">Further Poems</span> (1955) praised the beauty of the countryside of west Wales and the Vale of Glamorgan. A convinced pacifist, he voiced his anti-war philosophy in <span class="italic">Dail iorwg</span> (&#145;Ivy Leaves&#146;; 1919) and <span class="italic">Unwaith eto</span> (&#145;Once more&#146;; 1946), while &#145;Atgof&#146; (&#145;Memory&#146;) is perhaps his finest lyric on the subject. He wrote a great many poems for the eisteddfod movement, poems that were recited in chapel and cultural gatherings. These were compiled in <span class="italic">Darnau adrodd</span> (1932) and a follow-up, <span class="italic">Darnau newydd</span> (1944).<br>
<br>Evans also edited the poems of Thomas Jones (1820&#150;1876) as <span class="italic">Gweithiau Taliesin o Eifion</span> (1922) and published three volumes of prose in Welsh, <span class="italic">Gweithio englyn</span> (1948), an introduction to traditional versecraft, <span class="italic">Y filltir deg</span> (1954), and <span class="italic">Colofnau Wil Ifan</span> (1962), which included a selection of his weekly columns for the daily newspaper <span class="italic">Western Mail</span>. He collaborated with musicians such as David Evans, Haydn Morris, and T. Hopkin Evans in writing or translating a variety of songs. His admiration for D. Afan Thomas (1881&#150;1928) led him to write a biography, <span class="italic">Afan: a Welsh Music Maker</span> (1944).<br>
<br>Evans was also a playwright. <span class="italic">Dreams Come True</span> (1916), a biblical drama in three acts, was followed by the Welsh-language plays <span class="italic">Y dowlad</span> (1922), <span class="italic">Yr het goch</span> (1933), <span class="italic">Helbulon llenor</span> (1938), and <span class="italic">Flynyddoedd o flaen Adda</span> (1938).<br>
<br>In addition to contributing cartoons for the <span class="italic">Western Mail</span>, Evans was a regular columnist and broadcaster. He retired as pastor of Bridgend in 1947, and that same year was made an honorary MA by the University of Wales. Between 1947 and 1950 he was archdruid of the national eisteddfod and, at a service to celebrate the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, he became the first nonconformist ever to preach from the pulpit of the Anglican cathedral in St David's, Pembrokeshire.<br>
<br>Evans died on 16 July 1968 at his home at 14 Park Street, Bridgend, six months after the death of his wife; he was buried at Rhyd-y-main, Merioneth. A collection of his poems, <span class="italic">Bro fy mebyd a cherddi eraill</span>, published in 1998, includes the most impressive of his lyrics from his volumes <span class="italic">Dros y nyth</span> (1915), <span class="italic">Dail iorwg</span> (1919), <span class="italic">Plant y babell</span> (1922), <span class="italic">O ddydd i ddydd</span> (1927), <span class="italic">Y winllan las</span> (1936), <span class="italic">Unwaith eto</span> (1946), and <span class="italic">Haul a glaw</span> (n.d.). A Bridgend road is named in his memory.<br>
