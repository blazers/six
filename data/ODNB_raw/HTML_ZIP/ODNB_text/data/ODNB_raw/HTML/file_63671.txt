<span class="headword">Waters,  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1751), <span class="occ">printer and bookseller</span>, was the son of a John Waters (<i>d</i>. 1717?), a papermaker in Dublin. His name first appeared in 1707 as a printer, when he took over from John Brocas at School House Lane, near High Street, and used the metal-cast alphabet that had come originally from Amsterdam. In 1712 he and his father leased from Joseph Leeson a paper mill, printing press, and house at Milltown, near Milltown Bridge, co. Dublin. On 30 November 1717, presumably after his father's death, a new lease was made out in his name only. He married Sarah, daughter of Matthew Gunne, and they had a daughter, Annamaria, who was baptized on 13 June 1709.<br>
<br>Waters now owned a flourishing business. Between 1707 and 1740 he occupied at least five different printing premises in Dublin: in School House Lane, Smock Alley, Essex Street, Copper Alley, and then near Essex Street as well as at Milltown Bridge. In all he started or ran no fewer than seven newspapers, the most significant of which was the <span class="italic">Flying Post</span>, or, the <span class="italic">Post-Master</span> (1708&#150;29), as well as occasional news sheets. He inherited three of the titles from Brocas.<br>
<br>A tory, Waters was often in trouble with the authorities for his Jacobite activities. Described as &#145;Protestant Printer to the late Pretender&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dublin Intelligence</span>, 3 May 1707), Waters and two other protestant printers, Cornelius Carter and Peter Lawrence, and a Catholic bookseller, James Malone, were taken into custody on 19 November 1708 on suspicion of &#145;printing and vending Popish Prayer-Book contrary to Law&#146;  (Pollard, 589). In February 1709 Malone and Carter were tried and found guilty, Waters and Lawrence having turned queen's evidence. Later that year Waters was indicted again for falsely reporting the burning of Wicklow by the French. On 10 June 1714 messengers were sent to arrest him for printing a scandalous ballad about Hanover called &#145;Tis time to come over &amp;c&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 5.460). But Waters had escaped and &#145;gone fishing&#146;, thereby foiling his prosecutors. When they came for him in June 1715 for printing <span class="italic">Polyphemus Farewell</span> he leapt out of the window, two storeys high, at the New Post Office printing house at the corner of Sycamore Alley, but was captured in a nearby cellar. He was again in difficulties in 1720 and was sent for trial by grand jury, and found not guilty, after a prolonged trial for printing Swift's &#145;Insolent and Seditious&#146; <span class="italic">Proposal for the Universal Use of Irish Manufacture</span>  (Pollard, 590). It moved Swift to write to Sir Thomas Hanmer to persuade the lord lieutenant, the duke of Grafton, to drop the case, and when he arrived in Ireland in August 1721 a <i>nolle prosequi</i> was granted. But in 1735 Waters was committed to Newgate for reprinting Bishop Hort's <span class="italic">New Proposal for the Better Regulation of Quadrille</span>. He was soon released after a petition on his behalf was prepared and when the fines were paid. Within a few months, in 1736, he overstepped the mark again when he reprinted a pamphlet whose original publication a month earlier had led to George Faulkner's imprisonment in Newgate. Waters was sent to the same prison but was at work again in 1737.<br>
<br>Waters was the first Dublin printer to publish Jonathan Swift's works, printing in 1711 the <span class="italic">Conduct of the Allies</span>, a scathing expos&eacute; of the deficiencies of British allies in waging the War of the Spanish Succession, and <span class="italic">Proposals for the Universal Use of Irish Manufactures</span> (1720). Waters printed the manuscript work by Manoel Alvarez SJ, <span class="italic">A Jesuit Latin Grammar</span> (1716), as well as the <i>magnum opus</i> of Dr Cornelius Nary, <span class="italic">A New History of the World</span> (1720). One of the most intriguing pamphlets he printed was the eight-page <span class="italic">Letter to the author of the Catholic answer to the seeker showing who are the first foxes he ought to hunt</span> (1736). The pamphlet's theme was transubstantiation and one of the &#145;first foxes&#146; to be hunted was the Jesuit controversialist Robert Bellarmine.<br>
<br>Waters died in Dublin of a lingering illness on 12 October 1751, after a full and troublesome life.<br>
