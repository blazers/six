<span class="headword">Siward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1075), <span class="occ">bishop of Rochester</span>, was a Benedictine monk who was abbot of Chertsey when he was consecrated bishop by Archbishop Stigand in 1058, after Stigand had received his pallium from the usurping Pope Benedict X. Nothing is known of his episcopate, but it cannot have been unsatisfactory, for when Stigand was deposed at Easter 1070 Siward was allowed to retain his see, and he attended both Archbishop Lanfranc's consecration on 29 August following and a reforming church council in 1072. He died in 1075, probably on 30 October, when his obit was celebrated at Rochester. William of Malmesbury confused him with a namesake whom Archbishop Eadsige appointed as his coadjutor and who died in 1048.<br>
<br>The see of Rochester was said to be in a miserable condition in 1075, with its cathedral served by only four or five clerks living in abject poverty. To remedy the situation, <a name="cosubject_95162"></a><span class="headword">Arnost <span class="st"> [Ernost]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 1076)<span class="occ"></span>, a monk of Bec, was made bishop by Lanfranc. He had probably been at Bec since about 1060, and also developed a connection with St &Eacute;tienne, Caen, where he became involved in arrangements for the copying of texts, and where in 1070 Lanfranc recommended him for the office of prior. But there is no evidence that he was promoted, and perhaps he came instead to England, as Lanfranc's assistant&#151;he is recorded as being present at the famous lawsuit over archiepiscopal lands conducted on Penenden Heath, Kent, probably in 1072, and may well have been there in attendance on the archbishop, though his being styled bishop of Rochester is anachronistic. Following Siward's death Rochester's dependence on Canterbury justified Lanfranc in appointing Arnost as bishop in the Canterbury chapter house, probably in January 1076. In his profession of obedience to the archbishop Arnost described himself as having been &#145;chosen by you&#146;. Lanfranc clearly had a high regard for his nominee, who, however, had little opportunity to demonstrate his abilities. Having been consecrated at London, Arnost seems to have applied himself energetically to bringing order to his diocese, judging by a letter to him from Anselm, commiserating over the many and heavy troubles then afflicting him. The prognosticon, the gospel reading taken at random during a bishop's consecration and interpreted as foretelling the character of his episcopate, had been understood by Lanfranc as predicting that Arnost would not live long, and perhaps his labours shortened his life, for he died after a six-month episcopate, probably on 15 July, when his obit was commemorated. It is not known where he was buried.<br>
