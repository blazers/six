<span class="headword">Daniell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Carter]</span>,  Madeline Margaret</span>  (1832&#150;1906), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born at Secrole, India, on 19 May 1832, the daughter of Major Henry Carter of the Bengal native infantry and his wife, Helen Gray. She attended the Edinburgh Institution for the Education of Young Ladies and a finishing school in Europe. On her return to India she married on 13 November 1851 Charles Astell Daniell (1833&#150;1855), a cornet in the 18th light cavalry. He died in Lahore on 24 November 1855 leaving her with one son.<br>
<br>Madeline Daniell made her home at 1 Inverleith Terrace, Edinburgh, where, in the 1860s, she played an important role in the campaign for higher education for women. When the Edinburgh Ladies' Educational Association was being formed, the first meeting of the executive committee was held in her house in 1866 and she became honorary secretary. Mary Crudelius (president) and Mrs Ranken (treasurer) were the other office bearers. Their principal university advisers were professors Masson and Laurie and Dr Arthur Mitchell. The initial object of the association was to provide women with the opportunity for advanced post-school education, but specifically not to encourage women to provoke male opposition by attempting to enter the professions. In the first year (1867&#150;8) 263 women enrolled for the programme which commenced in the Hopetoun Rooms as a series of lectures by Masson on the history of English literature. Thereafter other classes were developed in experimental physics and mental philosophy.<br>
<br>Mary Crudelius was an important leader of the group, but she suffered from poor health; in the period 1866&#150;9 much of the work was actually taken on by Madeline Daniell, whose &#145;devoted labours &hellip; are often mentioned&#146; by Mrs Crudelius in her correspondence  (Burton, 23). Madeline attended many of the lectures and negotiated with Masson about the examinations which, it was agreed, had to be identical to those undertaken by male university students. She appears to have herself sat some of the first exams. Madeline formed friendly contacts with leaders of the women's movement elsewhere, including Emily Davies and Elizabeth Wolstenholme (Elmy), and was in contact with the organizers of the parallel Glasgow association. Madeline's sister Mrs De Lacy Evans, also the widow of an Indian officer and later wife of the editor of <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, was one of the group of women who in 1869 joined Sophia Jex-Blake in the unsuccessful attempt to enable women to gain admission to medical lectures at Edinburgh.<br>
<br>About 1870 Madeline Daniell moved to St Andrews to care for her invalid mother. There she played a part in the establishment of St Leonard's School for Girls, which provided middle-class girls with a high-quality education as a foundation for subsequent university-level study. All the teachers were to be women, one principal aim being to provide appropriate professional occupations for educated women. Madeline seems to have been one of the originators of the plan for St Leonard's and, in 1877, she was one of the two founding honorary secretaries of the St Andrews School for Girls Company.<br>
<br>After the deaths of her mother and her son Madeline Daniell moved to London, where she became active in work for the Charity Organization Society. She lived for a time in the East End of London, where she took a particular interest in the plight of impoverished women. In June 1887 she met the brilliant young essayist and poet Constance Naden (1858&#150;1889), and for the next two years the women were close friends and companions. These were years which Madeline described as &#145;a time of great happiness&#146;. In the autumn of 1887 the two women embarked on an extensive tour of Greece, Turkey, Egypt, and India, before returning to settle at Naden's house in Grosvenor Square. In 1889 Constance Naden died, and when her collection of essays, <span class="italic">Induction and Deduction</span>, was published in the following year under the editorship of Dr R. Lewins, Madeline contributed an affectionate &#145;Memoir&#146; as an introduction, in which she described something of the friendship.<br>
<br>The early death of Naden resulted in another move for Madeline Daniell, on this occasion to Southport, where she lived for a period with Miss Kay Shuttleworth. There once again she was active in various women's and charitable organizations, including the Women's Suffrage Society, the Women's Local Government Society, and the University Extension Society. She was also a member of the Women's Liberal Association. From about 1898 she suffered from a prolonged paralysing illness which effectively ended her active career. Her last years were spent at Southsea, Hampshire, where she died at her home, Ashburton, in Ashburton Road, on 21 April 1906.<br>
