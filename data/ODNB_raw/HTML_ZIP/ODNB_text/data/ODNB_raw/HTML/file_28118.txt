<span class="headword">Vashon,  James</span>  (1742&#150;1827), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, son of James Volant Vashon (<i>bap</i>. 1707), Church of England clergyman at Eye in Herefordshire and lecturer of Ludlow, was born at Ludlow on 9 August 1742. He entered the navy in August 1755 on the <i>Revenge</i>, with Captain Frederick Cornewall, a local figure of property and influence. In the <i>Revenge</i> Vashon was present at the battle of Minorca on 20 May 1756, and when Cornewall returned to England as a witness in the trial of Admiral John Byng he transferred into the <i>Lancaster</i>, with Captain George Edgcumbe, and took part in the capture of Louisbourg in July 1758. The <i>Lancaster</i> then served in the West Indies, as part of the force under Commodore John Moore in the capture of Guadeloupe.<br>
<br>Vashon was then moved to the <i>Cambridge</i>, Moore's flagship, and continued in her, under Captain Goostrey and Rear-Admiral Charles Holmes at Jamaica. While there he frequently served in the <i>Boreas</i>, a cruising frigate, and experienced some sharp boat service in cutting out enemy privateers. Holmes died in November 1761, and on 1 July 1762 Goostrey was killed in the attack on the Morro Castle at Havana. In summer 1761 Goostrey is said to have asked Holmes to make Vashon a lieutenant. Holmes demurred, saying he looked such a boy, but he would make him one in time. The death of both patrons nullified this plan, and though he passed his lieutenant's examination on 7 September 1763, and continued serving without interruption on the Newfoundland station and the West Indies, he was not promoted until 1 June 1774, when Sir George Rodney made him a lieutenant of the <i>Maidstone</i>. After she received a refit in England he sailed in her in 1777 to the coast of North America, under the command of Captain Alan Gardner, and spent the early months of 1778 in active cruising.<br>
<br>In March, Vashon commanded the boats which set fire to a ship they had driven on shore, where she was defended by several field-pieces. In July he carried intelligence of the French fleet to Lord Howe at New York and, having rejoined the <i>Maidstone</i>, assisted in capturing the privateer <i>Lion</i>. Vashon, with twenty-four men, was put on the <i>Lion</i>, but the worsening weather prevented further communication, and the situation of the prize crew with some two hundred prisoners grew precarious. The ship was also in a sinking condition, but Vashon succeeded in keeping the <i>Lion</i>'s crew at the pumps, and so brought the prize safely to Antigua. For this service he was promoted to the rank of commander on 5 August 1779, and ordered home; and on 29 August 1779 he married Jane Bethell at Ludlow.<br>
<br>Vashon was appointed to the <i>Alert</i>, in which he returned to the West Indies. He was sent home with dispatches from Jamaica early in 1781, was for some time attached to the fleet in the North Sea under Sir Hyde Parker, and in December went again to the West Indies with Rodney, where the <i>Alert</i> was stationed off Martinique as a lookout ship. He was with the fleet off Dominica at the battle of the Saints (12 April 1782), when he took possession of the <i>Glorieuse</i>, and was active in saving survivors from the explosion of the <i>C&eacute;sar</i>. He was promoted captain of the <i>Prince William</i> by a commission dated the same day. Rodney soon afterwards appointed him flag captain of the <i>Formidable</i>, a mark of esteem, and, on Rodney's recall Vashon was moved into the frigate <i>Sibyl</i>, which he commanded until the peace.<br>
<br>From 1786 to 1789 Vashon was captain of the <i>Europa</i>, with Commodore Gardner's broad pennant, and in the Spanish armament of 1790 he commanded the <i>Ardent</i> (64 guns) and in 1793 was appointed to the <i>St Albans</i> (64 guns), employed on convoy service to the Mediterranean and to Jamaica. He afterwards commanded the <i>Pomp&eacute;e</i> (80 guns) in the Channel Fleet off Brest, and during the mutiny at Spithead. Following its conclusion a new and dangerous outbreak occurred in the <i>Pomp&eacute;e</i> and though this was promptly quelled and the ringleaders tried by court martial and sentenced to death, Vashon applied to be relieved from the command. He commanded in turn the <i>Neptune</i> (98 guns), the <i>Dreadnought</i> (98 guns) in 1801&#150;2, and the <i>Princess Royal</i> (90 guns) from 1803 until his promotion to the rank of rear-admiral on 23 April 1804.<br>
<br>The command of so many large second rates indicates recognition of solid though not brilliant, professional skills, yet further significant duties eluded Vashon, and for four years he commanded the ships at Leith and on the coast of Scotland. He was made a vice-admiral on 28 April 1808, and admiral on 4 June 1814. He died at Ludlow on 20 October 1827, and was survived by a son, then in holy orders.<br>
