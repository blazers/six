<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Powys,  John Cowper</span>  (1872&#150;1963), <span class="occ">novelist and writer</span>, was born on 8 October 1872 at the vicarage, Shirley, Derbyshire, the eldest of eleven children of the Revd Charles Francis Powys (1843&#150;1923) and his wife, Mary Cowper (1849&#150;1914), daughter of William Cowper Johnson, rector of Yaxham, Norfolk, through whom Powys inherited the blood of the poets John Donne and William Cowper. Through both parents he came from several generations of country parsons. The Powys family, connected in England with the barony of Lilford, was of ancient Welsh origin. In 1879 John's father took a curacy at Dorchester, Dorset, in order to be near his mother in Weymouth; in 1885 he became vicar of Montacute, Somerset. Thus the west country was the major conditioning environment of John and his brothers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40705/', "Theodore Francis Powys (1875&#150;1953)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56994/', "Llewelyn Powys (1884&#150;1939)")</script>, all aware in their writings of the impact of landscape on personality. John was educated at Westbury House preparatory school, Sherborne, and Sherborne School (1883&#150;91). He read history at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, from 1891 to 1894, &#145;years of an unbalanced and chaotic idealism&#146;  (Powys, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>), and was awarded a second-class degree. While walking in Cambridgeshire, Powys experienced &#145;a beyond sensation&#146;, which was &#145;to do with some secret underlying world of rich magic and strange romance. In fact I actually regarded it as a prophetic idea of the sort of stories that I myself might come to write&#146;. In 1896 he married Margaret Alice Lyon (1874&#150;1947), sister of a Cambridge friend, T. H. Lyon; they had one son, Littleton Alfred (1902&#150;1954), who entered the Anglican and afterwards the Roman Catholic priesthood.<br>
<br>From lecturing in girls' schools near Brighton, Powys moved to Oxford University extension lecturing from 1898 and to the American Society for the Extension of University Teaching from 1905. From 1909 to 1934 he spent the large part of each year in the USA, normally returning each summer to his family. As an enthralling, theatrical lecturer, Powys could draw American audiences of 2000 people. Recognition in the USA of his fame and critical intelligence is indicated by his being called, for example, as expert defence witness at court cases on the publication of Theodore Dreiser's <span class="italic">The &#145;Genius&#146;</span> (1915) and James Joyce's <span class="italic">Ulysses</span> (1922), and his being filmed with Bertrand Russell in <span class="italic">Debate: is Modern Marriage a Failure?</span> (1929).<br>
<br>Powys began his literary career with a small collection of lyric poems, <span class="italic">Odes and other Poems</span> (1896), and continued to publish small volumes (in 1899, 1916, 1917, and 1922). His first novel was <span class="italic">Wood and Stone</span> (1915), followed by <span class="italic">Rodmoor</span> (1916). These coincided with his first works of non-fiction: three books of literary criticism including <span class="italic">Visions and Revisions</span> (1915) and <span class="italic">Suspended Judgments</span> (1916), and one of self-analysis, <span class="italic">Confessions of Two Brothers</span> (with Llewelyn Powys) (1916). Thereafter he published steadily throughout his lifetime, growing in power.<br>
<br>In America in 1921, a meeting with Phyllis Playter (1894&#150;1982), one of several powerful, intellectual American women friends, led to a lifelong companionship in which she served as Powys's secretary, influential literary critic, and muse. Critical opinion, supported by evidence in his diaries, is that Phyllis Playter's advice helped to raise the quality of Powys's novels, starting with the first of the &#145;great&#146; ones, <span class="italic">Wolf Solent</span> (1929), written from 1925 to 1928. This novel may in part reflect the contrasting natures of Margaret Alice Lyon and Phyllis Playter in its principal women characters. Retiring from 4 Patchin Place, New York, his base of seven years, in 1930 Powys moved with Phyllis Playter to Phudd Bottom, upper New York state, where, with &#145;the life-blood of his home&#146;, he wrote the massive works for which he is generally most admired, <span class="italic">A Glastonbury Romance</span> (1932), <span class="italic">Autobiography</span> (1934), and <span class="italic">Weymouth Sands</span> (1934). Phyllis Playter accompanied Powys on his return to Britain in 1934, moving with him to Wales for his final years.<br>
<br>Powys did not win the Nobel prize with <span class="italic">A Glastonbury Romance</span>, as he anticipated. Instead he was financially crippled by an out-of-court payment of the novel's royalties and more to a Glastonbury dignitary who thought himself portrayed in the novel. <span class="italic">Weymouth Sands</span> was published in England not under the title of place, but of its main protagonist, <span class="italic">Jobber Skald</span>. A year in Dorchester produced <span class="italic">Maiden Castle</span> (1937). When Powys retreated to north Wales, he identified himself with the Welsh in <span class="italic">Obstinate Cymric</span> (1947), and wrote the Wales-based novels <span class="italic">Owen Glendower</span> (1940) and <span class="italic">Porius</span> (1951), his &#145;masterpiece&#146; set in one week in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 499. His latest fiction was also removed from contemporary life, including <span class="italic">Atlantis</span> (1954), <span class="italic">Homer and the Aether</span> (1959), and a space fantasy, <span class="italic">All or Nothing</span> (1973).<br>
<br>In tandem with his fourteen full-scale novels and other fiction, Powys produced fourteen &#145;philosophical&#146; works to guide the &#145;common man&#146; through the stresses of modern urban life, such as <span class="italic">The Art of Happiness</span> (1923), <span class="italic">The Meaning of Culture</span> (1929), <span class="italic">In Defence of Sensuality</span> (1930), <span class="italic">A Philosophy of Solitude</span> (1933), <span class="italic">The Art of Growing Old</span> (1944), and <span class="italic">In Spite Of</span> (1953). Literary criticism continued, including <span class="italic">The Pleasures of Literature</span> (1938), <span class="italic">Dostoievsky</span> (1947), and <span class="italic">Rabelais</span> (1948). The latter two subjects give some clue to the mixed ingredients of Powys's outstanding works&#151;some six novels and his astonishing <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>. <span class="italic">Autobiography</span> is a self-portrait without reticence, without excuse, virtually without women (Frances Gregg, with whom he had a passionate friendship from 1912 to her death in 1945, appears fleetingly when dressed in boy's costume), and with more than his &#145;touch of caricature&#146;. Here, at sixty, he declared his ambition in fiction to break down fossilized attitudes, putting his readers at pleasant unease by writing a &#145;mystic-humorous, Pantagruelian, Shandean, Quixotic Romance&#146;. It is a fact that Powys's novels can be and are read for their dynamic representation of the landscapes he knew well (&#145;Glastonbury herself&#146; he declared the &#145;hero&#146; of that &#145;story&#146;), for occasional animation of the inanimate, and for their series of spectacular scenes mingling the trivial, the unexpected, the comic, and the sublime, crowded with increasingly large arrays of intriguing and eccentric characters in tortuous relationships. This is their strength but also only their surface: he had a great gift for investing even the inanimate with complex personality. In his lifetime Powys received appreciative reviews, such as Conrad Aiken's praise of <span class="italic">Wolf Solent</span> as &#145;leisurely, copious, humorous&#146;, and the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> critic's contrast of it with <span class="italic">Ulysses</span> as arousing &#145;disgust&#146; but leaving us &#145;with a realisation of the beauty not the ugliness of the world&#146; (1929). Yet, as Angus Wilson put it in 1963, Powys's enthusiastic critics failed him in their expression of &#145;amazement rather than comprehension&#146;.<br>
<br>John Cowper Powys was strikingly handsome in appearance as in personality. The painting by Raymond Jonson (1917) and numerous photographs for dust-jackets, including the National Portrait Gallery's choice, may better represent the novelist than the portrait by his sister Gertrude (1944; NMG Wales), the drawing by Augustus John, and the bust by Jonah Jones of the 1950s.<br>
<br>Official recognition was slight and late: Powys received the plaque of the Hamburg Free Academy of Arts in 1958 and was made DLitt by the University of Wales in 1962. He received a stream of visitors, eminent writers and ordinary readers, to his houses in Corwen (1935&#150;54), and Blaenau Ffestiniog. He died on 17 June 1963 at the Memorial Hospital, Blaenau Ffestiniog. His ashes were scattered on the sea off Chesil Beach, Abbotsbury, Dorset.<br>
<br>Since Powys's death he has been progressively perceived as ahead of or out of his time: that is, as an inter-war novelist with Proust, Woolf, and Joyce; as an anti-novelist in a line from Homer, Rabelais, Spenser, and Sterne; as an ultra-Wordsworthian, &#145;green&#146; novelist who is pervasively aware of the vital interaction of nature and man, inanimate and animate worlds, as a magic realist, and, finally, as a poet-novelist who not only presents individual man's fictive imagination as his liberation but is a teasing creator who gives his reader the novel as a fictive game. He is seen as the &#145;terrifyingly formidable genius&#146; he claimed to be.<br>
