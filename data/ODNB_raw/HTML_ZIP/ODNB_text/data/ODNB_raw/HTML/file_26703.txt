<span class="headword">Stuart <span class="st"> [Stewart]</span>,  Frances Teresa</span>, duchess of Lennox and Richmond <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>La Belle Stuart]</span>  (1647&#150;1702), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was born on 8 July 1647, the eldest daughter of Walter Stewart or Stuart (<i>d</i>. in or before 1657), politician, and his wife, Sophia (1610/11?&#150;1702), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4628/', "Sir George Carew")</script> and widow of Richard Nevill of Newton St Loo, Somerset. Her father was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26513/', "Walter Stewart, first Lord Blantyre")</script>, was elected MP for Monmouth Boroughs in 1624 and 1625, and seems to have joined Queen Henrietta Maria's exiled court in Paris after 1649. Her mother, who as maid of honour to Henrietta Maria had been noted for her beauty and skill in dancing, acted as a dresser to the queen in France, an appointment confirmed after the Restoration. Frances was educated as a Catholic in France, while her half-brother, George Nevill, remained in England &#145;well fixed in the protestant religion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Bulstrode Whitelocke</span>, 466), married in 1657 Mary, daughter of Bulstrode Whitelocke, and was the father of George Nevill, thirteenth Baron Abergavenny.<br>
<br>The young Frances Stuart was a favourite of Henrietta Maria and also acquired the approbation of the duchess of Orl&eacute;ans, who wrote to her brother Charles II on 4 January 1662 that &#145;she is the prettiest girl in the world and the most fitted to adorn a court&#146;  (Hartmann, 11). With such connections it is unsurprising that she secured an appointment as maid of honour to Charles II's new queen, Catherine of Braganza. Louis XIV &#145;would fain have had her mother, who is one of the most cunning women in the world, to let her stay in France&#146;  (Baillon, <span class="italic">Henriette-Anne</span>, 80), but contented himself with giving her an expensive farewell present. She arrived in England early in 1662 and made an immediate impression, one observer noting in February 1662, &#145;beautiful Mrs Stuart is here so admired and so rich in clothes and jewels, she is the only blazing star&#146;  (<span class="italic">Various Collections</span>, 8.65). Although little else is known her of during 1662, she was undoubtedly in waiting on Queen Catherine, who arrived in England in May, and her appointment as maid of honour was formalized in June 1663. Early in 1663, when she was still only fifteen years old, the king began to take notice of her. Possibly spotting a dangerous rival in the making, Barbara Villiers, Lady Castlemaine, the king's mistress, befriended Frances, but could do little to distract Charles from pursuing the latest beautiful addition to his court.<br>
<br>By June 1663 the marquis de Ruvigny was reporting to Louis XIV: <blockquote>no one doubts but that Miss Stuart has taken her [Lady Castlemaine's] place. She did not partake of communion at Whitsun, which is an assured mark of their [Frances's and the king's] recent understanding, so the best Catholics inform me. (Hartmann, 38&#150;9)</blockquote>Frances, however, did not become the king's mistress, nor did she become a pawn in court politics. In the summer and autumn of 1663 various politicians, most notably Sir Henry Bennet (later earl of Arlington), the duke of Buckingham, and the earl of Bristol, tried to use her to influence the king but she was either too &#145;cunning&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 4.366), or too &#145;infantile&#146;  (Grammont in Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 4.37&#150;8n.)&#151;opinion was divided&#151;to be of much use as a political operator. Her chosen amusements were blindman's buff, hunt the slipper, and card-building rather than political intrigue. Such was the king's infatuation with what Samuel Pepys called &#145;her sweet eye, little Roman nose, and excellent taille&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 4.230) that there were rumours that the king intended to marry her. The queen, however, recovered from a near fatal illness she had suffered late in 1663, and Charles II consistently refused suggestions that he divorce Catherine.<br>
<br>Charles continued to pursue Frances, who maintained her position at court. In July 1665 Courtin observed: &#145;she is the rising sun, and in truth too incomparably more beautiful than the other [Castlemaine]&#146;  (Hartmann, 82). By November 1665 it was reported that the duke of York, too, had fallen in love with her. Her fame as one of the most beautiful women of the court increased: in 1667 she was the model for John Roettier's figure of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68196/', "Britannia")</script>, seated at the foot of a rock with the legend &#145;Favente Deo&#146; in the medal entitled &#145;The peace of Breda&#146;, and in a similar guise in the unfinished &#145;Naval victories&#146; medal, with the legend &#145;Quatuor maria vindico&#146;. Pepys noted on a visit to his goldsmith on 25 February 1667, &#145;the king's new medal, where in little there is Mrs Stewards face&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 8.83). Edmund Waller and Andrew Marvell both wrote verses referring to the medal and Frances's role as Britannia, though twentieth-century scholarship has questioned the connection. Subsequently the design by Roettier was used on the reverse side of the copper coinage introduced in 1672.<br>
<br>In March 1667, according to John Evelyn's later account, Frances &#145;could no longer continue at court without prostituting herself to the king, whom she had long kept off&#146;  (Hartmann, 115). An attractive suitor appeared in the guise of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26696/', "Charles Stuart, third duke of Richmond, sixth duke of Lennox, and eleventh seigneur d'Aubigny (1639&#150;1672)")</script>, courtier, whose second wife had died in January 1667. Richmond was distantly related to the king, who affected to agree to a match as long as Richmond made a suitable settlement on Frances. Perhaps suspecting that the king would not in the end allow her to marry, Frances left London secretly and married Richmond about 30 March 1667. The couple returned to London soon afterwards and lodged with Frances's mother at Somerset House in order to gauge the king's reaction. Charles was furious, the earl of Lauderdale writing that he had never seen Charles &#145;more offended than he is at the duke and all concerned&#146;  (Seaward, 321), a reaction not assuaged when Frances returned his presents of jewellery. In response Frances and her husband retired to Cobham Hall in Kent. The secret marriage and the king's reaction to it have even been used to explain the downfall of the earl of Clarendon, whose supposed fault was to encourage the Richmond match in order to ensure that Charles remained married to his barren queen and thus protected the claims of his own grandchildren, princesses Mary and Anne, to the throne. It seems more likely that at most it was one further instance of Clarendon's alienating the king.<br>
<br>The duchess of Richmond remained unreconciled to the king until, while again in residence in Somerset House, she contracted smallpox in March 1668. There were fears for her beauty, but as Charles wrote to his sister in May 1668, &#145;she is not much marked with the smallpox, and I must confess this last affliction made me pardon all that is past&#146;  (Hartmann, 154). The only after-effect of her illness appears to have been some residual eye trouble. She duly returned to court, and on 6 July 1668 Pepys reported that the previous week she had been sworn a lady of the bedchamber to the queen. The duke and duchess moved into new Whitehall lodgings in the Bowling Green. Back at court Frances was still favoured by the king, which gave some alarm to his new mistress, Louise de K&eacute;roualle, duchess of Portsmouth. Although, according to Baron Dartmouth, the king told her husband in 1671 that Frances had surrendered to him after her marriage, she never sought the position of acknowledged royal mistress.<br>
<br>The duke of Richmond was appointed ambassador to Denmark in February 1672, and following his departure the duchess was left with power of attorney to receive the money due from his grant of duties on the aulnage and the payments due for his embassy. She also, in contrast to the frivolity of her younger days and indeed her spendthrift husband, applied herself to running the Richmond estates with prudence and good judgement. Richmond did not return from his diplomatic posting, dying near Elsinore in Denmark on 12 December 1672. The Richmonds had no children, and the titles and estates of Lennox and Richmond reverted to the crown, although the king with characteristic generosity allowed the duchess the use of the Lennox estate for her life. The next duke of Richmond was the son of Louise de K&eacute;roualle and Charles II, who was created a duke in 1675. In 1677 Frances resigned her claims on the Aubigny estate in France to Charles for a pension of &pound;1000 per annum, and about the same time sold her life interest in Cobham Hall to her sister-in-law Lady Catherine O'Brien, thereby ending the bone of contention between them.<br>
<br>Frances lived quietly at court attending the queen, and was evidently concerned to maintain her reputation as a respectable widow, in 1678 demanding and obtaining an apology from the rakish young courtier John Grobham Howe after he falsely claimed to have had an affair with her. She continued at court until 1688, although she was not present at the birth of the prince of Wales. Thereafter perhaps prudence and ill health dictated her retirement. Nevertheless, she defended tenaciously her right to collect the aulnage, petitioning parliament in 1692, 1693, and 1700 when legislation threatened to extinguish her rights. However, her pension from the crown fell into arrears in 1690. She attended the coronation of Queen Anne in April 1702.<br>
<br>Frances died on 15 October 1702 and was buried on 22 October next to her husband in Westminster Abbey. Boyer recorded that &#145;she was a Roman Catholic and very devout in her way&#146;  (Boyer, 1&#150;2.231). Details of her will became public very soon after her death. She left legacies of &pound;500 and &pound;300 per annum to her mother, who died at the end of 1702. She left her sister, the Jacobite <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3899/', "Sophia Bulkeley")</script>, who was married to the exiled Lord Bulkeley, &pound;1000, and &pound;500 apiece to her sister's six children, including &#145;La Belle Nanette&#146;, wife of the duke of Berwick. However, after being &#145;advised I cannot safely do the same in respect of their being in France and other circumstances attending them&#146;, she gave them seven years to return to England and &#145;be taken into the favour and protection of the crown and discharged and freed from the offences against the same&#146; in order to claim the money  (will). She also made the unusual request, which was honoured, that an effigy be made of her &#145;as well done in wax as can bee&#146;  (ibid.), dressed in her coronation robes and coronet, and set up under glass near the tomb of the second duke and duchess of Richmond in Westminster Abbey. Most of her estate was left in trust to the earl of Rochester, Alexander Stewart, fifth Lord Blantyre (<i>d</i>. 1704), Sir William Whitelocke, and James Gray (her gentleman of horse), to be laid out on the purchase of a Scottish estate to be named Lennoxlove, which was to be settled on Walter Stuart, son of Lord Blantyre.<br>
