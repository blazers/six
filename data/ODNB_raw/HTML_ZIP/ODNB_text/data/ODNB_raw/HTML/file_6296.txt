<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Corbett <span class="st"> [Corbet]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1680?, <em>d.</em> 1748), <span class="occ">violinist and composer</span>, was possibly the William Corbett, son of Henry and Sarah, baptized at St Margaret, Westminster, on 18 July 1680. St Margaret's is cited in Corbett's will as his family's parish. The coat of arms depicted in one of his portraits suggests Shropshire ancestry. His early musical training remains a mystery, although it is likely that he enjoyed a period of study in Italy. He quickly established himself in England as a composer and instrumentalist, assisted by his natural flair for self-promotion and the presentation of the novel in performance and composition that he demonstrated throughout his career.<br>
<br>Corbett was given a benefit at York Buildings, London, on 17 March 1699, and his op. 1, a set of twelve trio sonatas in the Italian style, was published in Amsterdam (possibly <i>en route</i> for or from Italy) about 1700. Already associated with Thomas Betterton's company at Lincoln's Inn Fields as a composer and performer, he wrote music and songs (published three years later) for Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Henry IV</span> performed there on 9 January 1700 and also given in Oxford that same year. Incidental music and songs for other productions followed in 1703. He was also actively involved in the long-running and pioneering London concert series organized by Thomas Britton, and his pupils included the Scottish violinist and composer William McGibbon.<br>
<br>Benefits and concerts featuring Corbett's own music followed in 1704&#150;5, at York Buildings and Lincoln's Inn Fields. He was leader of the band at the opening of the Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket on 9 April 1705 and held that position for a number of years (although not during the period 1707&#150;10). He wrote the overture and act tunes for the semi-opera <span class="italic">The British Enchanters</span> by George Granville, Baron Lansdowne, given there on 21 February 1706 with eleven further performances, and his contributions were published during the same year. His annual salary of &pound;40 at the theatre was equalled only by the violinist John Banister. He held a benefit on 18 March 1706 and performed a new Italian solo, billed as &#145;the first he ever play'd in public&#146;  (Edwards, &#145;Espionage&#146;, 327), on 19 March 1707 at York Buildings. In addition to giving frequent performances there, he appeared at Nottingham races (August 1707 and 1709), York (August 1709), the duchess of Shrewsbury's, Kensington, Home's Dancing School, and Hickford's music room. As the lord chamberlain's records testify, Corbett also remained a member of the royal band from the end of 1709 until his death in 1748, gaining prestige, money, and freedom during this period.<br>
<br>With the appointment of a new band following the production of Handel's <span class="italic">Rinaldo</span> at the Queen's Theatre in 1711, Corbett lost the post of leader. However, contrary to Sir John Hawkins's version of events, Corbett did not then leave for Italy. He remained in England, performing (notably at court on Queen Anne's birthday in 1712) and composing. His op. 4, consisting of twelve trio sonatas in two books, appeared in 1713, and &#145;Hail happy day&#146;, a song to commemorate the coronation of George I, in 1714. The ode <span class="italic">Lost is my Love</span> also dates from about this time.<br>
<br>On 25 March 1713 Corbett shared a benefit with the Italian opera singer Anna Lodi, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Signoni, of Milan, the widow of Francesco Lodi. It was the first concert to be given in Hickford's New Room in James Street, and also featured a new mandolin concerto. He made other concert appearances there the following month and held further joint benefit concerts with Lodi in 1714 (28 April) and 1715 (26 April). It was not generally known that Corbett had in fact married Signora Lodi in 1703. Corbett and Lodi had a daughter in 1713 and lived together, presumably in London, until the end of 1715, when Anna parted from him. Corbett followed her to Milan, via Amsterdam, and there they settled in September 1716. The daughter remained with relatives in London.<br>
<br>The pay that Corbett continued to receive in absence from the royal band (said to be an annual stipend of &pound;300) gave rise to the story, kept alive by Hawkins, that Corbett was serving as a spy on James Francis Edward, the Pretender. However, this money may have been intended to fund his valuable collection of music and instruments accrued during his extensive travels around the great cities of Italy, and there is no conclusive evidence either way.<br>
<br>Back in England on 18 March 1724, Corbett played at the New Haymarket Theatre on the <i>viol de venere</i> (a variant of the viola d'amore with twenty-two strings), which, it was claimed, had never previously been heard in England. On 16 May the first of Corbett's sales of instruments, music, and other items was advertised, and during the same month the <span class="italic">Session of Musicians</span> ridiculed his new instrument.<br>
<br>At some time after September 1724 Corbett returned to Milan with his daughter. He continued to tour Italy, and the family settled in Bologna in 1726. The cantata <span class="italic">Lost is my Love</span> dates from this period. However, the death of George I in 1727 required Corbett to return to London and renew his oath of allegiance to the crown. A benefit, billed as the only opportunity to hear him during his stay, took place on 20 March 1728 at Hickford's room and featured his &#145;new Bizzaria's&#146;, op. 8, as well as pieces on the viola d'amore and the supposedly all-new &#145;chamber horns&#146;. Corbett published the first instalment of his op. 8, <span class="italic">Le bizzarie universali, a quatro</span>, his most significant and curious works, while in London in June 1728. These twelve string concertos were written &#145;on all the new Gusto's in his Travels thro' Italy&#146; (title-page) and so reflected the general penchant for Italian music. A second edition, dedicated to Corbett's patron Richard, first Baron Edgcumbe, appeared in 1742 entitled <span class="italic">Concerto's, or, Universal Bizzaries &hellip; in VII Parts</span> and consisting of thirty-five concertos in three volumes. Competent and assured, these works combine effective instrumental writing, contemporary Italianate features, and parody. Each is prefixed with the name of an Italian city or European country. By this time Corbett had been granted a royal privilege, giving his music copyright protection for fourteen years. An advertisement for the sale of his instruments appeared in 1728, and he joined his family in Milan in September of that year.<br>
<br>Corbett's eventful private life then took a turn for the worse. By pretending to arrange a concert tour on which he was to be accompanied only by his daughter, he compounded an earlier controversy caused by his sister-in-law's staying with him in Rome in 1730, before the arrival of his wife and daughter. Such indiscretions led to his family going into hiding in May 1731 and living off valuables they had taken from the home. Corbett petitioned in passionate terms for their return; but while his efforts provide details of their relationship, they were ultimately in vain. He departed from Italy probably during the summer of 1731. Royal Archives place him back in England and present at court from 1732.<br>
<br>Several of Corbett's new <span class="italic">&#145;Bizzaria Universall&#146;</span> concertos, with the composer playing first violin, were given on 8 March 1734 at York Buildings, where a benefit was held the following month. Billed as lately arrived from Italy, he presented &#145;An essay of different kinds of harmony, intermix'd with some pieces on the new Viol D'Venere&#146;. His last solo recitals took place in 1739. Concerts on 4 and 11 August of that year featured the <i>viol de venere</i>, viola d'amore, and &#145;viol volubile&#146;. On 28 August 1739 he became one of the original members of the Royal Society of Musicians. In 1741 he tried, once again, to sell part of his collection of music and instruments, but without success.<br>
<br>Although often accompanied by controversy and subject to bouts of impetuosity, Corbett was evidently an extremely talented musician. He died, probably in London, on 7 March 1748. His will (dated 3 March 1747) was proved on 19 April by Richard Dawson, Daniel Cogdell, and Bridget Bohannon, widow. He requested a private burial in his family grave in the churchyard of St Margaret, Westminster, &#145;at some short time&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>) before midnight, with only two coaches in his cort&egrave;ge. The will includes a sum for his brother-in-law, Isaac Wattlington, late of St Leonard, Shoreditch, although for some reason his sister Ann, referred to as Wattlington's wife, was to receive 1<i>s</i>. only &#145;if demanded&#146;  (ibid.), and Corbett's wife and daughter are not mentioned. The largest bequest, his collection of music, instruments, and other valuables, was left to Gresham College &#145;to be deposited and put in a Room belonging thereto&#146;  (ibid.), although Corbett's connection with the college remains a mystery. He provided &pound;10 annually for Bridget Bohannon to be curator of the collection during her lifetime. Items included Cremonese and Stainer violins, a violin played by Corelli (destined for Giardini), a viola, a cello, double basses, bows, a harpsichord, and pictures, candlesticks, Italian silks, and music books. Included in the music were three sets of concertos, seven books of operas, and fifty-three individual concertos, some of which were to be given to deserving foreign performers but not sold on any account. Nevertheless, internal squabbles resulted in Gresham's turning down the bequest, and the collection was sold at auction in 1751: the instruments at Mercer's Hall, and the books and manuscripts at a house in Silver Street, Golden Square, which Corbett appears to have been renting at the time of his death.<br>
