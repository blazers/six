<span class="headword">Guinness,  (Arthur Francis) Benjamin</span>, third earl of Iveagh  (1937&#150;1992), <span class="occ">brewing company chairman</span>, was born on 20 May 1937 at Elveden Hall, Suffolk, the only son of Arthur Onslow Edward Guinness, Viscount Elveden (1912&#150;1945), and Lady Elizabeth Cecilia Hare, younger sister of William, fifth earl of Listowel, a prominent Labour peer. On 8 February 1945 Arthur Guinness, serving with the allied forces at Nijmegen, was killed by a stray German V2 rocket. Benjamin, as he was always called, was then only seven, and became heir presumptive to a title, an immense fortune, large estates in England and Ireland, and the management of a major international commercial enterprise. He lacked the qualities necessary for shouldering such a burden.<br>
<br>Benjamin Guinness's grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33604/', "Rupert Edward Cecil Lee Guinness, second earl of Iveagh")</script> and head of the dynasty, had lost a brother and two sons in tragic circumstances. He was determined that Benjamin should be groomed to undertake all the responsibilities that family tradition demanded, even though there were other male members of the extensive clan who could have shared these duties. As well as being chairman of the brewery, an active member of the House of Lords, and a prominent philanthropist, Rupert was a leading agricultural reformer. Thus at Eton, and later at Trinity College, Cambridge, the almost pathologically shy Benjamin, who had a passion for history and art, was steered into scientific studies.<br>
<br>As soon as he was twenty-one he was taken onto the brewery board. In 1960 he was appointed assistant managing director of the parent company and two years later his 88-year-old grandfather yielded the chairmanship into his hands. On 12 March 1963 he married Miranda Daphne Jane, daughter of Major Michael Smiley of Castle Fraser, Aberdeenshire. They had two sons and two daughters. In 1967 Benjamin inherited the earldom. It was his misfortune to be thrust into commercial prominence at a time when a new, aggressive, acquisitive spirit was spreading throughout the world of international corporate business. Take-overs and mergers were the order of the day. The era of family concerns run by benevolent proprietors as personal fiefdoms was passing rapidly. Over the next decade Arthur Guinness, Son &amp; Co. diversified and expanded into new markets in its efforts to maintain a lead role among the multinationals, but by the 1980s it was obvious that the company needed to recruit leaders from among the new-style dynamic and ruthless managers who understood the changed rules of the game.<br>
<br>Lord Iveagh had already distanced himself from the brewery and his other English responsibilities. After 1974 he lived permanently on his estate of Farmleigh, near Dublin, for tax reasons, and he subsequently took out Irish citizenship. He was from 1973 to 1977 a member of the Irish senate, thus enjoying the rare distinction of being a member of both the British and the Irish legislature. In 1984 he sold (for &pound;5.7 million) the contents of Elveden Hall, the Suffolk mansion where he had been brought up and where his grandfather and great-grandfather had regularly entertained the leaders of society. At Farmleigh he was able to escape the pressures of big business and enjoy those pastimes close to his heart&#151;racing, farming, and collecting antiquarian books. However, these panaceas could not preserve his health. He had been diagnosed as suffering from diverticulitis, and over the years underwent thirteen operations.<br>
<br>In 1981 Lord Iveagh appointed Edward Saunders as chief executive of the Guinness conglomerate and was content to leave management entirely in the hands of this resourceful, go-getting entrepreneur. The new man restructured the company and dramatically revived Guinness fortunes. At the height of his power he masterminded a management reorganization which elevated himself to the position of chairman and Benjamin to the newly created post of president, effectively shorn of the last vestiges of real power. Within weeks the baroque edifice began to crumble. Saunders's major coup had been the takeover of the Distillers Co. Ltd, but soon afterwards a Department of Trade and Industry enquiry produced evidence of alleged financial misconduct. This led, in 1990, to one of the most sensational and acrimonious trials in British commercial history. It would be over-dramatic to claim that this was the last straw for Lord Iveagh. He was already a broken man. He had taken to heavy drinking and smoking and now succumbed to cancer of the throat. The Iveaghs' marriage had collapsed in 1984, but his former wife nursed Benjamin through the final stages of his illness. Death came on 18 June 1992, in London, three weeks after he had resigned from the Guinness board, the last member of the family to be associated with a company founded by his great-great-great-great-grandfather in 1759.<br>
