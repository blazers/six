<span class="headword">Dobson,  John</span>  (1633&#150;1681), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Warwickshire, in which county his father, whose name is unknown, was a minister. He matriculated from Magdalen College, Oxford, on 9 December 1653, graduating BA in October 1656 and proceeding MA in 1659. Admitted as a fellow of Magdalen in 1661, he was ordained as deacon in the diocese of Lincoln on 21 December of that year. He soon became known as an eloquent preacher and the possessor of a remarkable memory, repeating at Easter 1663 four Latin sermons in St Mary's Church, Oxford &#145;to the wonder of the auditory&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.2).<br>
<br>At this time the president of Magdalen was Thomas Pierce (1622&#150;1691), &#145;a resolute maintainer of the ancient establishment of the Church of England&#146; against &#145;specious and plausible pamphleteers&#146;, but also a domineering and vindictive character, who several times discommuned, and eventually expelled, one of the fellows, Dr Henry Yerbury, &#145;for which action most people cried shame&#146;  (Bloxam, 1.42, 46). A protest, in manuscript, provoked Pierce into print, and in August 1663 there appeared two lampoons, <span class="italic">Dr Pierce his Preaching Confuted by his Practise</span>, and <span class="italic">Dr Pierce his Preaching Exemplified in his Practise</span>. These were purportedly directed against Pierce, but as it later emerged, had been issued anonymously by Dobson with Pierce's connivance, apparently with the objective of getting his opponents into trouble. The Magdalen register refers to Dobson as &#145;one of Pierce's creatures&#146;  (ibid., 46). For breaching the regulations, on 10 September 1663 Dobson was expelled from the university, but rapidly restored. In the same year he was incorporated MA at Cambridge, and in December 1667 obtained the degree of BD from Oxford. He had, on 24 September 1665, been ordained as a priest in the diocese of Peterborough, and on 20 May 1668 he was instituted to the rectory of Easton Neston, Northamptonshire; on the presentation of Sir William Farmor (his former pupil at Magdalen) of that parish, he was admitted on 13 July 1674 to the rectory of Cold Higham in the same county. From 1670 Dobson was also rector of Corscombe, Dorset, and seems to have divided his time between there and his Northamptonshire living. He died on 9 June 1681 at Corscombe and was buried there, where a monument was erected to his memory. In his will, signed on 22 May 1679, Dobson left money to a brother, Samuel, and sisters, Dorothy and Elizabeth; he seems never to have married. To Sir William Farmor he left &#145;several volumes of pamphlets published in the late troublesome times&#146;  (will).<br>
