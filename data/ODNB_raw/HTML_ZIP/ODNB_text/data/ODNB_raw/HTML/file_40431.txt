<span class="headword">Murray,  John</span>, second earl of Dunmore  (1685&#150;1752), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19593/', "Lord Charles Murray (1661&#150;1710)")</script>, who was created earl of Dunmore in the Scottish peerage by James VII in 1686, and his wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1710), daughter of Richard Watts of Great Munden, Hertfordshire, was born on 31 October 1685 at Whitehall, Westminster, London. He was styled Viscount Fincastle from his elder brother's death in 1704 until he succeeded his father in 1710 as earl of Dunmore. Pursuing a military career, he was commissioned an ensign in the 3rd foot guards in 1704 and fought at Blenheim the same year. Promotion was steady and at times rapid: Dunmore became colonel of his regiment in 1712 (a position he held until his death), brigadier-general in 1719, major-general in 1735, lieutenant-general in 1739, and general in 1745. In the same year he was made governor of Plymouth. His active service took place largely on the continent, where he served under a variety of commanders and gained the reputation of being a reliable subordinate. He was part of Lord Cobham's Vigo expedition in 1719, and in 1743 fought under George II at Dettingen, where he was one of sixteen British generals made knights-banneret on the field by the king. He later served under the earl of Stair and the duke of Cumberland in the Low Countries. His lone major command came in 1745 when Cumberland and almost all British troops in the Low Countries were withdrawn to meet the Jacobite threat in Britain, leaving Dunmore in command of remaining allied forces. Greatly outnumbered, he was unable to prevent the capture of Antwerp by the French or their overall dominance in the Austrian Netherlands.<br>
<br>When Dunmore was not on active service his life focused on the court and parliament. A firm supporter of the Union of 1707, he served as a representative peer in 1713&#150;14 and 1727&#150;52. In 1720 he purchased the manor of Stanwell, Middlesex, and appears thereafter to have spent little time in Scotland. Despite the Jacobite leanings of some of his relatives, he remained staunchly Hanoverian in his sympathies and opposed the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745. He exerted himself to save his brother and heir, William Murray of Taymount, who had joined the Forty-Five. Having obtained statements from loyal peers that his brother had helped to save the lives and property of Hanoverian supporters, he successfully interceded with the ministry for a pardon. In politics Dunmore allied himself with Archibald Campbell, earl of Ilay and subsequently third duke of Argyll. He supported Sir Robert Walpole during the excise crisis of 1733 when the fourteen representative peers present divided equally, though in general he did not figure prominently in the upper house's proceedings. He was a lord of the bedchamber to George II from 1732 until his death; on one occasion, according to Lord Hervey, he provoked the king by being overly inquisitive about his health. Dunmore never married, though, according to Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, he lived for a number of years with Mary, Lady Lansdown (<i>d</i>. 1735). He died on 18 April 1752 in London, and was buried at Stanwell on 24 April. He was succeeded by his brother William.<br>
