<span class="headword">Khan, Sir  Sikander  Hyat-</span>  (1892&#150;1942), <span class="occ">politician in India</span>, was born on 5 June 1892 at Multan, Punjab, India, the son of Nawab Muhammad Hyat-Khan, a well-known scion of the Khattar tribe from Attock district, and his second wife, who was the daughter of Ghulam Gilani, the premier of Kapurthala. His father was the divisional judge at Multan at the time of his birth, and a friend and supporter of Sir Saiyid Ahmad Khan. His mother died when he was only three years old, and his father died six years later. Thus his eldest sister-in-law brought him up. He received his early education from the Muhammadan Anglo Oriental Collegiate High School at Aligarh, where he captained both the hockey and the cricket team. He developed a love of literature at an early age, and translated two of Shakespeare's plays into Urdu when he was barely in his eighth grade. Soon after matriculation he was sent to England, where he continued his studies at University College, London. However, he was called back following the death of his elder brother Ghairat. His keen interest in politics during his stay in England and his deteriorating eyesight also contributed to his recall: as his biographer Iftikhar H. Malik revealed, &#145;Sikander Hayat had started playing an active role in the Ghadr Party, much to the annoyance of the British Indian Government. Two of his brothers held Government posts and were subject to official pressures to recall him&#146;  (Malik, 11). Thus he returned to India in July 1910 without a degree.<br>
<br>Back in India, Hyat-Khan started his military career as a <i>jamadar</i> in the army. During the First World War he was posted to the North-West Frontier Province, where he not only rose to the rank of a captain (and was the first Indian to command a company on active service) but was appointed MBE. In 1924 he entered politics by securing a seat in the Punjab legislative council, meanwhile developing an interest in commerce and industry. He was at various points a director of the Punjab Portland Cement Company, the Wah Tea Estate, the People's Bank of Northern India, the Wah Stone and Lime Company, Messrs Owen Roberts, and the Taj Company. He also remained engaged in local politics. Besides acting as an honorary magistrate of his native area he was vice-chairman of the Attock district board and chairman of the Hasan Abdal small-town committee. On 12 May 1912 he married Zobaida Khatoon (<i>d</i>. 1918), eldest daughter of Mir Ibad Ullah. Following her death he married, in April 1920, her sister Amina. He eventually had five sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>Although elected to the provincial legislature in 1921, Hyat-Khan's election was set aside, and he therefore had to wait until 1924 to take his place in the legislative council. His first important assignment came in 1928 when he headed the Punjab reforms committee set up by the legislative council following the announcement of the Simon commission. After that his political career took off. He was appointed the revenue member of the government of the Punjab in 1929. When in July 1932 the lieutenant-governor of the province, Sir Geoffrey de Montmorency, fell seriously ill and took two months' leave, Hyat-Khan filled the position, the first Indian to hold such responsibility. He was knighted KBE in 1933 and the following year, in the absence of the lieutenant-governor, Herbert Emerson, again acted as lieutenant-governor. In February 1935 he was appointed deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India.<br>
<br>During the 1920s and early 1930s the Unionist Party had been riddled with factionalism, Mian Fazl-i-Hussain and Hyat-Khan being the two main adversaries vying for political supremacy in the Punjab. Fazl-i-Hussain gained the upper hand but died in 1936. Hyat-Khan then succeeded him as leader of the Unionist Party (the dominant, and initially non-sectarian, party in the Punjab). In the elections to the Punjab legislative assembly held in 1937 (with a widened franchise and greater powers, under the terms of the <span class="roman">Government of India Act</span> of 1935) the Unionist Party secured a comfortable majority by winning 96 out of 175 seats. Nevertheless Hyat-Khan opted for a coalition cabinet, with three Muslims, two Hindus, and one Sikh. His commitment to political accommodation was also evident in the Jinnah&#150;Sikander pact in 1937, in which he reached an agreement with Mohamed Ali Jinnah whereby the Unionist Party would support the All-India Muslim League at the centre with Jinnah as &#145;sole spokesman&#146; of Indian Muslims, while the Muslim League would be subsumed into the Unionist Party at the Punjab level. The pact provided an entr&eacute;e to the Muslim League in the Punjab in the 1940s. He also played an important role in making the Lahore resolution (23&#150;4 March 1940), an historic event that laid the foundation for Pakistan. During the Second World War he actively supported the British cause, recruiting soldiers, opposing the Quit India movement, and visiting Indian troops in north Africa. His premiership was also notable for improvements in irrigation facilities, roads, and other elements of the rural infrastructure. Despite his privileged background, he was known as a friend of the peasantry, and inspired great loyalty among Punjabi Muslims.<br>
<br>Hyat-Khan died in Lahore on 27 December 1942 of heart failure, following the marriage ceremonies of two sons and a daughter; he was buried near the Badshahi mosque in Lahore. In a message to the viceroy on his death, Churchill observed: &#145;Please convey to the Government and people of the Punjab my sincere sympathy with the great loss they have sustained by the premature death of their wise and valiant leader &hellip; I had the pleasure of meeting him in the Middle East and recognizing in him both a gallant soldier and a statesman with a broad and valiant outlook, loyal to his own province, loyal to India, to the British Commonwealth and to the common sense of freedom&#146;  (Malik, 105).<br>
