<span class="headword">O'Brien,  Charles</span>, styled fifth Viscount Clare  (1670&#150;1706), <span class="occ">Jacobite army officer</span>, was born at Carrigaholt, Ireland, a younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20448/', "Daniel O'Brien, styled third Viscount Clare (c.1630&#150;1690)")</script>, and Philadelphia (<i>bap</i>. 1644, <i>d</i>. in or after 1699), daughter of Francis Lennard, fourteenth Baron Dacre. Nothing is known of his early years or education. The O'Brien family were Roman Catholics and strong supporters of the Stuart cause, for which Daniel had fought at the battle of the Boyne (1690) and had thereafter had his title forfeited. After the revolution of 1688 Charles commanded a regiment of foot in James II's army in Ireland, one of several regiments raised by his father on behalf of the deposed king in 1689 and 1690. Taking command of a cavalry regiment in 1691, he served at the second siege of Limerick.<br>
<br>Having joined James II in France in 1692, O'Brien first served as a captain in the king's <i>gardes du corps</i>, and was subsequently attached to the queen of England's regiment of <i>dragons-&agrave;-pied</i>, of which he became the colonel on the death of Francis O'Carroll at the battle of Marsaglia in Italy on 4 October 1693. His elder brother, Daniel, the fourth viscount, was mortally wounded on the same occasion, and Charles succeeded to the title. On 8 April 1696 he became colonel of the Clare regiment, so named in honour of his family, and he served at the siege of Valenza in Lombardy and on the Meuse during the campaigns of 1696 and 1697. On 9 January 1697 at St Germain-en-Laye he married Charlotte (<i>d</i>. in or after 1714), eldest daughter of Henry Bulkeley, master of the household to Charles II and James II, and Sophia Stuart. His support of the Jacobites led to his being attainted before 1699.<br>
<br>When the War of the Spanish Succession broke out Clare joined the army of Germany, was promoted brigadier-general on 2 April 1703, and took a distinguished part in the rout of the imperialists at the battle of Hochstadt on 20 September 1703. Early in 1704 he was promoted major-general and commanded the Irish regiments of Clare, Lee, and Dorrington at the battle of Blenheim, cutting his way out of the village of Oberklau, and escaping with his three regiments, in admirable order, to the Rhine. Appointed <i>mar&eacute;chal-de-camp</i> on 26 October 1704, Clare joined the army of the Moselle in Flanders. He was wounded at Ramillies eighteen months later and died at Brussels on 23 May 1706. Following his burial in the city's Irish monastery a monument to his memory was erected by his widow in the church of the Holy Cross at Louvain. She married on 19 July 1712 at St Germain-en-Laye <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20750/', "Count Daniel O'Mahony")</script>, who died two years later, leaving her a widow once more. Clare was survived by a daughter, Laura, who married the comte de Breteuil, and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20443/', "Charles O'Brien, styled sixth Viscount Clare, and later styled ninth earl of Thomond")</script>, who succeeded him in the title. The command of the Clare regiment devolved upon its lieutenant-colonel, a kinsman of the Clare family, Murrough O'Brien, but 6000 livres p.a. were set apart by order of Louis XIV, out of the emoluments of the position, for the maintenance of the young viscount.<br>
