<span class="headword">Murdoch,  John  Burn-</span>  (1852&#150;1909), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Edinburgh on 17 June 1852, the eldest son of William Burn-Murdoch (1822&#150;1878), MD Edinburgh, second son of John Burn-Murdoch (1793&#150;1862) of Gartincaber, Perthshire. His mother was Jessie Cecilia, daughter of William Mack. The father's younger brother, James M'Gibbon Burn-Murdoch, was father of Colonel John Francis Burn-Murdoch, a distinguished cavalry officer. Educated at the Edinburgh Academy, at Nice for a year, and at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, Burn-Murdoch entered the Royal Engineers on 2 May 1872. He served in the Anglo-Afghan War of 1878&#150;80, and was at the engagement of Charasia on 6 October 1879 and the operations round Kabul in December 1879, including the storming of the Asmai heights, when he was severely wounded while employed in blowing up one of the Afghan forts. He was mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>Burn-Murdoch took part in the 1882 Egyptian campaign with the contingent from India under Major-General Herbert Taylor Macpherson. The engineers were commanded by Sir James Browne, known as Buster Browne (1839&#150;1896), and Burn-Murdoch and William Gustavus Nicholson were the two field engineers. On reaching Bombay with his companions on 6 August, Burn-Murdoch aided Browne in preparing all the requisite material, and arrived at Suez, where they repaired the roads, local canals, and railways. From Isma&#145;iliyyah they reached Qassasin on 11 September, and were present at the battle of Tell al-Kebir on the 13th. Immediately afterwards Burn-Murdoch, with the Indian force, pushed on for some 30 miles to Zaqaziq, and took a foremost part in seizing the railway there; General Browne sent a captured train back under Burn-Murdoch to help bring in the 72nd regiment, 6 miles off. The brilliant seizure of Zaqaziq, in which Burn-Murdoch did useful service, deprived the rebels of command of the railway and facilitated the capture of Cairo. He was mentioned in dispatches and received the Mejidiye (fifth class).<br>
<br>Burn-Murdoch was promoted captain on 2 May 1884, major on 6 August 1891, and lieutenant-colonel on 1 March 1900. Meanwhile he served in India in the state railways, and in 1893 became commanding engineer of state railways and subsequently was chief engineer of the Southern Mahratta Railway. He married in August 1889 Maud (<i>d</i>. 1893), widow of William Forster; they had no children (his wife already had three sons and a daughter). Burn-Murdoch retired on an Indian pension on 28 May 1900 and died at Bridge of Leith Cottage, Doune, Perthshire, on 30 January 1909. He was buried in Old Kilmadock burial-ground.<br>
