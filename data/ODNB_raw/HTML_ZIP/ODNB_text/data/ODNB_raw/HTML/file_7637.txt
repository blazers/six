<span class="headword">Digges,  Leonard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1515&#150;<em>c.</em>1559), <span class="occ">mathematician</span>, was the son of James Digges (<i>d</i>. 1535), of Digges Court, Barham, Kent, and his second wife, Phillippa, daughter of John Engham of Chart, Kent. Little is known of Digges's upbringing, though he appears to have been educated at Oxford. A letter written by his father in 1531 refers to the maintenance of his son at Oxford and his grandchildren at school. The grandchildren are presumably the children of Digges's elder brother John, son of James Digges's first marriage, so Digges must therefore be the student, though no university evidence survives to prove the point. This letter of 1531 is also the best evidence from which his year of birth can be inferred. His subsequent education is known more securely: he entered Lincoln's Inn in 1537.<br>
<br>The Digges family was substantial and long established, with a record of holding county office, but Digges held no major office. He was named as one of those charged with defending the Kent coast from Dover to Folkestone in 1545 and was also listed as a supporter of Sir Thomas Wyatt the younger's 1549 scheme for a militia. He took part in Wyatt's revolt against the marriage of Queen Mary in January 1554 and, after its failure, was charged with high treason and sentenced to death. He was pardoned on 1 April 1554 but his lands and goods, which had been seized after his attainder, continued to be held subject to payment of recognizances to the crown. Digges's major fine of 400 marks was imposed in February 1555 and paid off in instalments, being finally discharged on 7 May 1558. Digges married Bridget, daughter of Thomas Wilford of Hartridge, Kent, and they had at least three sons and four daughters, of whom the best known is his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7639/', "Thomas Digges (d. 1595)")</script>, who edited and republished several of his father's mathematical works. Leonard Digges was left the manor of Brome, Kent, by his father but sold this and established himself near by at Wootton in 1546 or 1547. The record of lands seized by the crown in 1554 reveals the extent of his landholdings in Kent.<br>
<br>Digges was an important member of the first generation of English mathematical authors to publish in the vernacular. Only two of his works were printed during his lifetime, a popular almanac and a short treatise on mensuration, both of which appeared in the 1550s. However, his interest in practical mathematics had been established much earlier. In 1542 he and three other gentlemen visited the English castle of Gu&icirc;nes near Calais where they impressed their host through debate and demonstration of their skills in geometry, navigation, measurement, and artillery.<br>
<br>The earliest surviving edition of Digges's almanac is <span class="italic">A Prognostication of Right Good Effect, Fructfully Augmented</span>. This was published in 1555 and dedicated to Sir Edward Fiennes, Lord Clinton and Saye, who was thanked for his help in preserving Digges during his &#145;troubles&#146;, evidently a reference to the consequences of Digges's participation in the Wyatt uprising. Digges described the 1555 text as a revision and expansion of a now lost earlier version, referred to as his &#145;general prognostication&#146;, printed in 1553. After 1555 there were at least thirteen subsequent editions into the early seventeenth century, usually under the title <span class="italic">A Prognostication Euerlasting</span>. From 1576, the work became the vehicle for an addition by his son Thomas, which included a presentation of Copernicus's heliocentric world system.<br>
<br>Digges's almanac deliberately departed from the usual form of such texts, which were typically printed for a single year and required annual renewal. The material he included was intended to be more generally valid; surviving fragments of a single sheet almanac for Kent dated 1556 show that he also contributed to the more standard genre. The <span class="italic">Prognostication</span> has calendrical tables and explanations of meteorological phenomena, with basic astrological information and rules for predicting the weather as well as times for planting, grafting, and blood-letting. Digges discussed the use of instruments such as the quadrant and square for time-telling, and provided tide tables for mariners. To satisfy readers who doubted the possibility of the astronomical statements in his early editions he included diagrams of the geocentric world system and of the relative sizes of the planets. This collection of miscellaneous material was prefaced by an apology for astronomy and the mathematical sciences, citing Melanchthon and Guido Bonatus to defend these against charges of impiety and vanity. Digges here recommended the mathematical sciences for their pleasure as well as their utility: &#145;the ingenious learned and well experienced circumspect student mathematical receiveth daily in his witty practices more pleasant joy of mind than all thy goods (how rich soever thou be) can at any time purchase&#146;  (<span class="italic">Prognostication</span>, 1555, sig. [*iiij]<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Digges's <span class="italic">Tectonicon</span> appeared in 1556, advertised on its title-page as a book for surveyors, &#145;landmeters&#146;, joiners, carpenters, and masons. It taught the measurement of land, the calculation of quantities, and the use of various instruments such as the carpenter's rule, the square, and a version of the cross-staff (&#145;the profitable staff&#146;). Digges was at pains to correct common errors practised by those without an adequate grounding in mathematics; this theme of &#145;vulgar errors&#146; became standard in many subsequent mathematical texts. The success of <span class="italic">Tectonicon</span> is evident from its subsequent history: at least twenty editions were printed, the last in 1692. The work also marks the public d&eacute;but of the commercial trade in mathematical (&#145;scientific&#146;) instruments in England: the text's publisher, the Flemish immigrant Thomas Gemini, used the title-page to advertise the availability of the instruments described in the volume.<br>
<br>In the <span class="italic">Prognostication</span> and <span class="italic">Tectonicon</span>, Digges promised several other volumes: a larger work on the use of the square to expand on the brief treatment in <span class="italic">Tectonicon</span>, a treatise on the construction of the letters of the alphabet, a volume devoted to astrology, and a more substantial text on practical mathematics. Only the latter appeared, in the form of <span class="italic">Pantometria</span>, published posthumously by his son Thomas in 1571, with a second edition in 1591. The three books of <span class="italic">Pantometria</span> covered the measurement of length, area, and volume and show Digges's familiarity with the latest continental sources. The work extended and complemented <span class="italic">Tectonicon</span> through its focus on surveying, and offered accounts of new and important devices such as the &#145;topographical instrument&#146;, the first appearance in England of the altazimuth theodolite. Thomas Digges added a work of his own on geometrical solids to the volume but his role in <span class="italic">Pantometria</span> was limited to revising the text for the press. He dedicated the work to Sir Nicholas Bacon, doing so in fulfilment of the wishes of his father, who had both discussed mathematics with Bacon and planned to present him with this particular treatise.<br>
<br>Leonard Digges also wrote on arithmetic, and some surviving papers became the basis for the first book of Thomas Digges's <span class="italic">Stratioticos</span> of 1579, a work on military mathematics whose second edition appeared in 1590. Other investigations by Digges senior never reached print. On the basis of comments by his son, occasional claims have been made that Digges devised a reflecting telescope; there is no evidence that his reported optical experimentation led to a working instrument for astronomical observation, but it seems likely that he did indeed use a rather unwieldy lens&#150;mirror combination for terrestrial viewing. He was interested in the closely related topic of burning mirrors and in the seventeenth century he was also credited with skill in fortification and architecture.<br>
<br>Digges's other major research was on artillery and ballistics. The most important text in this area was Niccol&ograve; Tartaglia's <span class="italic">Nova scientia</span> of 1537, which had inaugurated the mathematical study of ballistics. Although his published works of the 1550s were elementary and popular, Digges's artillery investigations were pursued as a self-conscious combination of theory and practice. After a programme of mathematical work and experimental trials, Digges concluded that a number of the most important results announced by Tartaglia were incorrect. Some of his artillery conclusions were published by his son in <span class="italic">Stratioticos</span>, but in a form which makes the respective contributions of father and son impossible to distinguish.<br>
<br>Thomas Digges, who actively publicized the life and work of his father, is also the only source for his death. From Thomas's autobiographical comments in a legal dispute of the 1590s it can be inferred that Leonard died about 1559, shortly after he had resumed possession of his confiscated lands and when he had only just begun the mathematical education of his eldest son. The close ties between the published work of father and son have obscured the marked differences in their careers&#151;historians have often simply referred to the Diggeses as if the two were indistinguishable. Leonard was an able popularizer who had enormous success in writing for a large audience, but he was more than just a talented compiler with a flair for instrumental innovation and exposition. Through his promotion of the mathematical arts and his claims for the civic utility of practical geometry, he was a key figure in the establishment of the role of the mathematical practitioner.<br>
