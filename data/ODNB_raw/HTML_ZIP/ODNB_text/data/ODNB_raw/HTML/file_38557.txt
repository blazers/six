<span class="headword">Vardon,  Thomas</span>  (1799&#150;1867), <span class="occ">librarian</span>, was the son of Thomas Vardon of Gracechurch Street, London, and his wife, Elizabeth Bryant Tarbutt. His early life is obscure and nothing is known of his education. He married Laura Ann Stapylton Johnson, daughter of the Revd A. Johnson of South Stoke, Somerset, about 1829. In February 1828 Vardon was appointed a clerk in the House of Commons and in June of that year he was appointed to the post of librarian of the house, which he held concurrently with his clerkship until September 1831.<br>
<br>The house had had a librarian only since 1818, but Vardon began immediately to expand the job into a kind of parliamentary factotum, and into spheres which the more senior officers of the house had left untouched. In this he was aided by the inauguration of a commodious new library, designed by Sir John Soane, in the year of his appointment, and by a vigorous and equally enthusiastic assistant, Thomas Erskine May. After the fire of 1834, expansion continued in a well-planned and convenient temporary library, and, after 1852, in the magnificent suite of four&#151;soon expanded to six&#151;fine rooms designed by Charles Barry and A. W. N. Pugin, the centrepiece of public-room provision in the new Palace of Westminster.<br>
<br>Vardon made himself and his department indispensable to the house. &#145;There is no subject&#146;, he told a select committee in 1835, &#145;&hellip; on which I am not called upon to afford instant information&#146;  (&#145;Standing committee on the library&#146;, evidence, 11&#150;12). These are words which might be expected of a modern computer-equipped reference librarian, but in the 1830s they were singular indeed. They signalled the beginning of the House of Commons library as an institution in which the main resources were the intellect, knowledge, and ability of the staff, rather than the shelves of books&#151;perhaps the first example in the world of a library of talents rather than of bibliographical sources. Meanwhile, the development of the collection had not been neglected; in fact, Vardon had built up the stock of the library almost from nothing after the fire of 1834. By 1860 it was far wider than the original idea of a library of historical, parliamentary, and constitutional information, and was particularly rich in political, economic, and topographical works. Under Vardon, and often by him, classified sets of parliamentary papers were assembled, and indexing of journals and reports went forward. As he took care to have the new library suite designed as a place of relaxation as well as one of study, it rapidly became the principal social as well as intellectual centre of the house.<br>
<br>Vardon died at his extensive house (as large as the clerk's) in the Palace of Westminster on 12 April 1867, from heart disease; he was survived by his wife, a son, and two daughters, and left in his will, in a series of trusts, some &pound;80,000. Before Vardon's appointment the House of Commons library could have faded from existence at any time, unnoticed; with his tenure, it became a central pillar of parliamentary life.<br>
