</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fergusson,  Robert</span>  (1750&#150;1774), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 5 September 1750 in the Cap-and-Feather Close (now demolished), off the High Street, Edinburgh, the fourth of the five children of William Fergusson (1714&#150;1767), a clerk from Tarland in Aberdeenshire, and his wife, Elizabeth Forbes (<i>b</i>. 1714), daughter of John Forbes of Templeton in the parish of Kildrummy, Aberdeenshire, and descended from the family of the Forbeses of Tolquhon. While his father was working as clerk to Walter Fergusson, writer to the signet in Edinburgh, the sickly seven-year-old Robert was sent for six months to Mr Philp's private school in Niddry's Wynd. From 1758 for four yours he went to Edinburgh's high school, getting a good grounding in Latin, before moving to Dundee's grammar school. There in 1762 he was awarded the David Fergusson mortification, a scholarship for those with his surname. Having spent the summer of 1764 with his mother on his uncle John Forbes's farm at Roundlichnot, near Old Meldrum, Aberdeenshire, the sometimes ailing Robert progressed on the same scholarship to St Andrews University.<br>
<br>The St Andrews arts curriculum of the period let Fergusson study Greek and Latin throughout his course, along with mathematics and logic in the second year, mathematics and moral philosophy in the third year, and natural philosophy in the fourth. An unusual aspect of St Andrews at this time was the teaching of rhetoric by Robert Watson, professor of logic, whose lectures dealt with the study of English literary texts, emphasizing the importance of Anglocentric politeness, while ignoring the Scottish vernacular. Fergusson was perhaps the first significant poet to study English literary texts at a university. Considered the best singer at St Andrews, he was often asked to officiate as clerk at morning and evening prayers. An excellent student mathematician, he became the favoured pupil of the farmer&#150;poet William Wilkie, professor of mathematics. Best known as &#145;the Scottish Homer&#146; for his English-language <span class="italic">Epigoniad</span>, Wilkie also wrote in Scots during Fergusson's student days. Fergusson's later memorial, &#145;Eclogue&#146;, praised Wilkie's ability to inspire &#145;Scholars and bards&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 2.85). Employed for two summers to make a fair copy of Wilkie's lectures, Fergusson also celebrated other St Andrews University figures. His serio-comic &#145;Elegy&#146; on the death of the mathematician David Gregory is remarkable for its presentation of Euclidean geometry in Scots verse, relishing such expressions as &#145;surd roots&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 2.1). Some years later, in 1773, he wrote another elegy in the &#145;Standard Habbie&#146; Scots verse form on John Hogg, the university porter, and in his &#145;To the principal and professors of the University of St Andrews, on their superb treat to Dr Samuel Johnson&#146; Fergusson attacked his alma mater for its sycophantic reception of Johnson on his visit to St Andrews in 1773, and for failing to champion Scottish vernacular culture. Towards the end of his time as a St Andrews student, Fergusson is said to have begun work on a tragedy dealing with the death of William Wallace. The poet was involved in a St Andrews student &#145;riot&#146; in 1768 and offered up a mock prayer for one of his friends in front of the assembled professors, an act which almost led to his expulsion. Fergusson was a lively student, but not universally popular. Eighteenth-century marginalia in St Andrews University Library describe him as &#145;a stinking fairy&#146; and &#145;a snake in human form stain'd with infamy and wickedness&#146;  (Crawford, 27).<br>
<br>Fergusson, who appears to have had Jacobite and anti-unionist sentiments, left St Andrews in May 1768, without graduating (an omission common at the time), but would not settle to a profession. Early in 1769 he spent six months on his uncle's farm at Roundlichnot, leaving under a cloud. In September 1769 he took a job as clerk in the commissary office, Edinburgh, copying legal documents at the rate of a penny a page. He became a friend to Edinburgh singers and musicians, including the visiting Italian singer Giusto Ferdinando Tenducci, who performed some songs by him. A friend of several actors, Fergusson relished Edinburgh's theatre life. In 1771 <span class="italic">The Weekly Magazine, or Edinburgh Amusement</span> published three &#145;Pastorals&#146; by Fergusson, written in the manner of Shenstone. These were followed by other poems in English, and the poet appears to have enjoyed a passionate friendship with a young woman, designated &#145;Stella&#146; in a series of poems. In 1772 Fergusson published several poems in Scots in <span class="italic">The Weekly Magazine</span>. Poems such as &#145;The death of Scots music&#146;, &#145;Caller Oysters&#146;, and &#145;To the Tron Kirk Bell&#146; celebrated in racily sophisticated vernacular language the pleasures of Edinburgh. Fergusson was hailed by his actor friend Frederick Guion as &#145;The Laureate&#146; of that city, while another commentator praised him for reviving the tradition of Allan Ramsay  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 1.33). By the end of 1772 he was planning the publication of his poems in book form, and was reported as hoping to follow in the footsteps of the great Scots translator Gavin Douglas by translating Virgil's <span class="italic">Eclogues</span> and <span class="italic">Georgics</span>. Walter Ruddiman, editor of the <span class="italic">Weekly Magazine</span>, encouraged the impoverished Fergusson, and gifted to him two suits of clothes.<br>
<br>In early January 1773 Fergusson's volume of <span class="italic">Poems</span> was published in Edinburgh under the imprint of Walter and Thomas Ruddiman. Fergusson is known to have inscribed copies to James Boswell, to the earl of Glencairn (later a patron of Burns), to the ballad collector David Herd, and to several others. Soon after, in 1773, he published <span class="italic">Auld Reekie, a Poem</span> which, though it attracted little immediate notice, ranks as the supreme vernacular Scots celebration of Edinburgh's bustling streetlife and convivial delights:<blockquote>
<div>On stair wi' TUB, or PAT in hand,<br>
</div>
<div>The barefoot HOUSEMAIDS looe to stand,<br>
</div>
<div>That antrin Fock may ken how SNELL<br>
</div>
<div>Auld Reekie will at MORNING SMELL.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 2.110)</blockquote>A poem by &#145;Philanthropus&#146; in the <span class="italic">Weekly Magazine</span> in December 1772 presented Fergusson as charming Edinburgh society with his &#145;quick and lively fancy&#146;, as singing lustily, but also as a slovenly youth who &#145;Wears dirty shirts, nor combs his hair&#146; and who needs to behave more prudently  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 1.46&#150;7). Fergusson's friend and early biographer Thomas Sommers recalled him as &#145;about five feet, six inches high, and well shaped. His complexion fair, but rather pale. His eyes full, black, and piercing. His nose long, his lips thin, his teeth well set and white&#146;. Narrow-shouldered and long-limbed, Fergusson had a voice, Sommers remembered, &#145;strong, clear, and melodious &hellip; when speaking, he was quick, forcible, and complaisant. In walking, he appeared smart, erect, and unaffected&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 1.59).<br>
<br>In October 1772 Fergusson joined the Cape Club, which met in several Edinburgh taverns &#145;to pass the evening socially&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 1.50). Delighting in its quasi-masonic rituals, Fergusson took on the nickname &#145;Sir Precenter&#146; (as a result of his St Andrews exploits), and hymned the Cape's activities. A drawing of him survives in the club's minute book (National Library of Scotland). At the Cape he mixed with ordinary tradesmen as well as with artistic figures such as David Herd and Alexander Runciman, who painted Fergusson's portrait, now in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, and to whom Fergusson addressed some comic verses. Brought up in a protestant milieu, Fergusson knew the <span class="roman">Bible</span> well, but appears to have had difficulties accepting some of the tenets of Christianity.<br>
<br>In October 1773 Fergusson published <span class="italic">A Poem to the Memory of John Cunningham</span>, elegizing a poet who had died in Newcastle's madhouse. The same month he wrote to a friend, complaining how &#145;that fancy which has so often afforded me pleasure, almost denies to operate but on the gloomiest subjects&#146;; in November, he signed a letter &#145;Yours, in the horrors&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 1.67&#150;8). At the end of the year Fergusson had to give up his work at the commissary office, and was seriously ill; possibly he had contracted syphilis. His last poems, in English, include a paraphrase of part of the book of <span class="roman">Job</span>, and an &#145;Ode to Horror&#146;. Severely depressed, Fergusson sought quiet in the village of Restalrig, near Edinburgh, but soon returned to the city, burning many of his poems, and constantly reading the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. One recollection has Fergusson telling a friend near the North Bridge, Edinburgh, that he had just spotted one of the men who crucified Christ  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 1.74). On 2 July 1774 the Cape Club took up a collection to aid Fergusson who, after showing some signs of recovery, fell downstairs, became delirious, and was committed to a cell in Edinburgh's Darien House Asylum where he lay weeping fully-clothed on a bed of straw. He died there on 17 October 1774 and was buried on 19 October in the Canongate churchyard in an unmarked grave.<br>
<br>In 1779 Walter and Thomas Ruddiman issued a further volume by Fergusson, <span class="italic">Poems on Various Subjects</span>; in 1782 and 1785 fuller, collected editions of Fergusson's work appeared from the same publisher. The standard modern edition is by Matthew McDiarmid for the Scottish Text Society (2 vols., 1954&#150;6). Fergusson was Robert Burns's favourite Scottish poet, and, though they never met, they had friends in common. When Burns was awaiting the publication of the Edinburgh edition of his own work in 1787 he complained about the lack of a headstone at Fergusson's grave; eventually he paid for and composed the inscription for such a memorial. Burns addressed several poems to Fergusson, calling him &#145;Heaven-taught Fergusson&#146; and<blockquote>
<div>my elder brother in Misfortune<br>
</div>
<div>By far my elder Brother in the muse.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Poems and Songs</span>, 258)</blockquote>Several of Burns's poems, including &#145;The Cottar's Saturday Night&#146;, are modelled on works by Fergusson, who has continued to be revered by Scottish poets. His fame rests largely on his thirty-five poems in Scots, including &#145;Leith Races&#146;, &#145;The Farmer's Ingle&#146;, and those mentioned above. In the nineteenth century Robert Louis Stevenson regarded him as &#145;so clever a boy, so wild &hellip; so like myself&#146; and planned to add words to his tombstone &#145;as the gift of one Edinburgh lad to another&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 8.290&#150;91). In the twentieth century Sydney Goodsir Smith edited <span class="italic">Robert Fergusson, 1750&#150;1774: Essays by Various Hands</span> (1952) in which Hugh MacDiarmid, Robert Garioch, and other Scottish poets paid tribute to him and bonded his work to their own. In 2000, commissioned by the University of St Andrews, ten poets, including Douglas Dunn, W. N. Herbert, Kathleen Jamie, Edwin Morgan, Les Murray, and Don Paterson, continued the tradition of paying poetic homage to Fergusson.<br>
