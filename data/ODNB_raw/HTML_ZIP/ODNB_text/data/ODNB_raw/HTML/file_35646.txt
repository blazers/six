<span class="headword">Rackham,  Bernard</span>  (1876&#150;1964), <span class="occ">museum curator and expert on ceramics</span>, was born in London on 26 July 1876, the third son of Alfred Thomas Rackham (1829&#150;1912), later Admiralty marshal of the High Court of Justice, and his wife, Anne (1833&#150;1920), daughter of William Stevenson, draper, of Leicester and Nottingham. His eldest brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35645/', "Arthur Rackham (1867&#150;1939)")</script>, the illustrator. Rackham was educated at the City of London School and went with an exhibition in 1895 to Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he took a first in the classical tripos in 1898. He then entered a competition for an assistant keepership at the South Kensington Museum (later the Victoria and Albert Museum) under a scheme whereby the government aimed to attract Oxford and Cambridge graduates to the museum service. Successful, he was posted to the department of ceramics, where he was destined to remain for forty years, during the last twenty-four of which he was its head. In 1909 he married Ruth (1880/81&#150;1963), daughter of Francis Adams, of Clapham, a colonial merchant; they had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>To Rackham belongs the credit of putting ceramic studies in England on a firm footing, a service which in many fields was also of international significance. Before his time the study of English ceramics was based on facts, assumptions masquerading as facts, and vague traditions. Rackham, by his intellectual vigour and grasp of essentials, reduced this formless mass to order, eliminating baseless assumptions and calling in aid only verifiable and relevant information. The same strict method was applied in other fields. With this disciplined approach he combined a real enthusiasm for art in all its manifestations, ancient and modern, oriental and Western. For him the aesthetic quality of an object was its ultimate justification.<br>
<br>Shortly after appointment to the museum, Rackham was detailed to register the vast mixed ceramic collection (some 5000 objects) acquired from the Museum of Practical Geology on its dissolution. This experience underlay his subsequent great and diverse knowledge of ceramics.<br>
<br>Rackham's first publications lay in the field of English ceramics, partly because the main emphasis of the practical geology collection lay there, partly because he was charged with reworking the catalogue of the Lady Charlotte Schreiber collection of English pottery, porcelain, and enamels, the greatest of its kind. The three volumes appeared in 1924&#150;30, only the first volume of the revision having been published previously, in 1915. In 1917 there appeared a complementary catalogue of the English porcelain in the Herbert Allen collection. These works established the basic categories of English porcelain.<br>
<br>After the First World War it fell to Rackham to rearrange the enormous collections of his department. As a fitting complement to this work he undertook the translation from Danish of Emil Hannover's encyclopaedic <span class="italic">Keramisk haandbog</span> (which appeared in three volumes in 1925 as <span class="italic">Pottery and Porcelain</span>). The previous year he had returned to English studies in <span class="italic">English Pottery</span>, written with Herbert Read. This work represented the first modern classification of all branches of English pottery, and was succeeded by his catalogue (2 vols., 1935) of the vast Glaisher collection at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, which has remained one of the most useful reference works on English pottery.<br>
<br>In 1918 Rackham had turned to an entirely fresh theme in the <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Le Blond Collection of Corean Pottery</span>, and although he never explored oriental subjects in great depth, he was perennially interested and stimulated by them, and became a founder member of the Oriental Ceramic Society. By then he was devoting himself increasingly to the European middle ages and Renaissance, particularly tin-glazed earthenware and stained glass. About 1900 he had been invited to help catalogue the works of art inherited by Francis Wyndham Cook, and in 1903 he published his <span class="italic">Catalogue of Italian Maiolica and other Pottery, 8 Cadogan Square</span>. This experience was the beginning of his special interest and mastery in this field. In 1926 he published a pioneer work on the tin-glazed pottery made in the Low Countries (<span class="italic">Early Netherlands Maiolica</span>). He contributed important articles on Italian maiolica to learned periodicals, and in 1933 brought out a <span class="italic">Guide to Italian Maiolica</span> in the museum, a masterly work of compression and lucid exposition. The true fruit of his work in this field, however, was seen in his monumental <span class="italic">Catalogue of Italian Maiolica</span> (1940) in the museum, a two-volume catalogue raisonn&eacute; of the more than 1400 items in that great collection, and the essential tool in all maiolica studies. Rackham's vast erudition in this branch of ceramics was later distilled into the more popular <span class="italic">Italian Maiolica</span> (1952).<br>
<br>In 1936 a series of articles on stained glass culminated in a <span class="italic">Guide to the Collections of Stained Glass</span> in the museum, one of the best short summaries of the whole subject in any language. The summit of his work in this field, however, was reached with his <span class="italic">Ancient Glass of Canterbury Cathedral</span> (1949). This was more than ten years after his retirement, and he continued to publish on various ceramic themes&#151;<span class="italic">A Key to Pottery and Glass</span> in 1940, <span class="italic">Medieval English Pottery</span> in 1948, and <span class="italic">Early Staffordshire Pottery</span> in 1951. He also published important articles on English and continental glassware, on Limoges enamels, and on continental porcelain.<br>
<br>Rackham, who was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, was appointed CB in 1937. He was honorary remembrancer of Guildford, and president of the English Ceramic Circle and of the Guildford Art Society. Apart from his scholarly work, Rackham was also a civil servant, charged with the administration of a department. These duties he conscientiously fulfilled, requiring of his subordinates the same high standards which he imposed upon himself. Personally, he was highly strung and eager, overflowing with enthusiasm, and endowed with a keen sense of humour. He was tall and lean, with a bright eye and a strikingly erect carriage even in old age. He died at the Hillbrow Nursing Home, Liss, Hampshire, on 13 February 1964.<br>
