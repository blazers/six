<span class="headword">Bailey,  Thomas</span>  (1785&#150;1856), <span class="occ">newspaper editor and author</span>, was born at Nottingham on 31 July 1785. His education was received partly in a day school in his native town, and partly in a boarding-school at Gilling, Yorkshire. Afterwards he was for some time engaged in his father's trade of silk hosier at Nottingham, and then as a wine merchant. A liberal in politics, though not a radical, he contested Nottingham, unsuccessfully, at the general election in 1830. From December 1835 to 1843 he was a member of the town council. In 1845&#150;6 he became proprietor and editor of the <span class="italic">Nottingham Mercury</span>, but his opinions were too moderate for his readers, and the circulation of the paper declined. Bailey's leaders on the <span class="roman">Ecclesiastical Titles Bill</span> of 1851&#151;he expected the bill to fail&#151;caused further loss of circulation, and in 1852 the paper closed. Before this, in 1830, he had purchased a mansion at Basford, Nottingham, where he spent the later years of his life, writing and collecting books and engravings. Bailey published several collections of his poems, and <span class="italic">A Sermon on the Death of Byron</span> (1824). He wrote books about Nottinghamshire, of which <span class="italic">Annals of Nottinghamshire</span> (4 vols., 1852&#150;5) is the most substantial. He also published <span class="italic">Village Reform: the Great Social Necessity of Britain</span> (1854), and <span class="italic">Records of Longevity; with an Introductory Discourse on Vital Statistics</span> (1857).<br>
<br>Bailey was an independent in religion, and was twice married. His first wife, who died about 1818, aged twenty-seven, was Marie-Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Taylor. About 1825 he married Katherina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Carver, of Broughton Astley, Leicestershire, who died in 1860. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30529/', "Philip James Bailey")</script> was one of his four children from his first marriage. Bailey died from cancer of the stomach at Basford on 23 October 1856.<br>
