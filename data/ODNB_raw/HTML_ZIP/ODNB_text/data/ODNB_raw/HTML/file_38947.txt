<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Flight,  (Walter) Claude</span>  (1881&#150;1955), <span class="occ">linocut artist and art teacher</span>, was born on 16 February 1881 at 12 Clairville Grove in South Kensington, London, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9748/', "Dr Walter Flight FRS (1841&#150;1885)")</script>, mineralogist and authority on meteorites at the British Museum, and his wife, Katherine Fell (1847&#150;1942), daughter of Dr Fell of Ambleside. Flight's interest in art was a relatively late development; after he left school he worked in an engineer's office for two years, took up librarianship for eighteen months, and then spent seven years farming and bee-keeping in Sussex at Little Bines, Burwash, as a neighbour of Rudyard Kipling. In 1912, aged thirty-one, Flight enrolled as a full-time student at the Heatherley School of Fine Art in London, where he met (Helena) Clare James, whom he married on 20 May 1915 in the parish church of St John, Hampstead; they had two daughters. At the outbreak of the First World War he volunteered as a farrier and subsequently became a captain in the Army Service Corps in France, being awarded the M&eacute;rit Agricole medal by the French government for his three and a half years' service. After demobilization he spent a year at the Paris art schools and purchased for 300 francs a neolithic chalk cave by the Seine at Chantemesle, 40 miles from Paris. He made the cave his regular summer retreat, declaring in an interview: &#145;it is here that I cook, sail my canoe, sketch and dream&#146;  (Flight, &#145;Golders Green artist's life&#146;, 1).<br>
<br>Following his marriage break-up Flight met in 1922 <a name="cosubject_75977"></a><span class="headword">Edith Lawrence</span>  (1890&#150;1973), an <span class="occ">artist</span> working in various media, including textile design and linocut, who moved into his studio at St John's Wood in 1925 and thereafter became his lifelong companion and artistic partner. Born on 22 March 1890 at Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, youngest daughter of George Adams Lawrence, the founder of Jackson's, the fashionable grocery store in Piccadilly, Lawrence trained at the Slade School of Fine Art, London (1910&#150;14), where she was a prizewinning student. Before meeting Flight she had already embarked on her career: in 1916 she exhibited paintings at the Royal Academy and the New English Art Club and from 1917 was teaching art at Runston Hill School. In 1927 Flight and Lawrence set up an interior decoration business from their new studio at 5 Rodmarton Mews, off Baker Street, London, designing murals and utilitarian decorative objects, many of them in textile. A joint exhibition of their embroidered work, mostly designed by Flight and executed by Lawrence, that included fire screens, pictorial door curtains, cushion covers, and even a bedroom hot water cosy, was shown at the Embroiderers' Guild, London, in 1937.<br>
<br>Although Flight's geometrically constructed oil paintings and watercolours were regularly shown at the progressive <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96398', "Seven & Five Society")</script> (1922&#150;8) and were widely reproduced during this period in the leading art magazines, including <span class="italic">The Studio</span>, <span class="italic">Colour</span>, and <span class="italic">Artwork</span>, his importance rests on his championship of the colour linocut as the modern medium for the modern age. Inspired by the machine-age aesthetic of F. T. Marinetti and the Italian futurists (whose work he knew from their well-publicized visit to London in 1912), Flight sought to express the vitality, speed, and movement of modern life through the twentieth-century linocut, which, he claimed, &#145;has no tradition of technique behind it, so that the student can go forward without thinking of what Bewick or Rembrandt did before&#146;  (Flight, <span class="italic">Art and Craft</span>, 63). From 1926 to 1930 Flight gave weekly instruction in linocut technique at the Grosvenor School of Modern Art, founded at 33 Warwick Square, Pimlico, London, in 1925 by the enlightened teacher and wood-engraver Iain Macnab. Among Flight's numerous students were Cyril E. Power and Sybil Andrews, Eileen Mayo, the Swiss Lill Tschudi, and the Australians Dorrit Black, Ethel Spowers, and Eveline Syme, all of whom helped to disseminate his ideas abroad. Syme wrote at the time of his success as a teacher:<blockquote>Sometimes in his classes it is hard to remember that he is teaching so complete is the camaraderie between him and his students. He treats them as fellow-artists rather than pupils, discusses with them and suggests to them, never dictates or enforces. At the same time he is so full of enthusiasm for his subject, and his ideas are so clear and reasoned, that it is impossible for his students not to be influenced by them. (Syme, 3)</blockquote>Flight's book <span class="italic">Lino-cuts</span> (1927) was the first monograph on the subject and became the standard manual for artists and teachers; it was illustrated with examples of his prints that showed the combined influence of futurism and art deco. His second textbook, <span class="italic">The Art and Craft of Lino Cutting and Printing</span> (1934), expressed many of his ideas on art education, particularly for children. He wrote several children's books illustrated with his linocuts, including three with Edith Lawrence written in Basic English in 1938: <span class="italic">A Little about Art</span>; <span class="italic">A Little about Geography</span>; <span class="italic">A Little about History</span>. In 1929 Flight organized the first exhibition devoted exclusively to the linocut in Britain; its success at the Redfern Gallery, London, led to a series of eight annual exhibitions which he arranged, initially at the Redfern and then at the Ward Gallery, London, until 1937. Flight also introduced the linocut to a diverse international audience through exhibitions toured by the Redfern to the United States (1929 and 1934), China (1931), Australia (1932 and 1937), and Canada (1935&#150;6). Flight viewed the modern linocut, with its bold colour, geometric design, and rhythmic expression, as the new democratic art medium that would furnish homes with contemporary decorative designs at affordable prices. With utopian fervour he looked forward to the day when this &#145;art of the people for their homes&#146;  (Flight, <span class="italic">Lino-cuts</span>, 12) might sell &#145;at a price &hellip; paid by the average man for his daily beer or his cinema ticket&#146;  (ibid., 4).<br>
<br>Until the late 1930s Flight conducted regular classes at his cave in France during the summer as well as occasional sketching tours in Dorset. In June 1940 Flight and Lawrence, to escape the threat of aerial attack, moved to a small cottage in Donhead St Andrew, Wiltshire, taking with them their prints and watercolours; the studio at Rodmarton Mews was destroyed during the blitz in 1941, with the loss of all their lino printing blocks and larger oil paintings and screens. In April 1947 Flight suffered a stroke, which left him paralysed. He was nursed by Lawrence at Donhead St Andrew until his death on 10 October 1955. By this date his reputation had declined, with little interest after the war being shown in his work and in that of the linocut movement he represented; it was not until the 1970s that his achievements as an artist and teacher began to receive their proper due. Principal holdings of his prints are in the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra.<br>
<br>Flight's pupil Dorrit Black described him as:<blockquote>a small man with very bright eyes, little bits of side-curls, and one feels instantly at one's ease with him. During the summer he lives in a cave in France &hellip; and in the winter he comes out of his cave to teach lino-cutting to students of the Grosvenor School. (Black)</blockquote>This light-hearted vignette encapsulates the paradoxical qualities of Flight's character: as an artist he openly embraced metropolitan life with its speed and complexity and yet felt compelled to return each year to a caveman simplicity.<br>
<br>In 1955 Lawrence, who had become almost blind during Flight's last years, was able to paint again after a cataract operation. In 1961 she moved to Worth Matravers, Dorset, where she continued to work with the use of one eye for the next twelve years. An exhibition of her work was held at the University of Hull a few months before her death on 2 October 1973, at the Maristow Nursing Home, Bourne Avenue, Salisbury. A joint memorial exhibition of the work of Flight and Lawrence was held at the Parkin Gallery, London, in November 1973, a show which marked the start of their artistic rehabilitation.<br>
