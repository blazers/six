<span class="headword">Vossius,  Gerardus Joannes</span>  (1577&#150;1649), <span class="occ">humanist scholar and author</span>, was born in Heidelberg, Germany, probably in March or April 1577, the son of Joannes Vossius 
    (Alopecius; 1549&#150;1585)
  , Calvinistic minister, and Cornelia Van Buel (<i>d</i>. 1584). In his autobiography and correspondence Vossius mentions that he was born in early spring, without giving a precise date. His parents came from Roermond, a city in the south of the Netherlands. After completing his theology studies at Heidelberg his father, then a merchant, became minister of a congregation in the vicinity of that city in 1573. After serving his office in the Palatinate he was then called to serve in Leimuyden, the Netherlands, in Veurne, Flanders, and finally in Dordrecht, the Netherlands, where Gerardus's mother died in 1584. His father married Anna Fransdochter de Witt, but died soon after. Gerardus attended the Latin school in Dordrecht and enrolled at Leiden University in 1595 as student on a grant in the Collegium Theologicum. In 1598 he obtained the degree of MA. He went on to study theology and also lectured in physics at the university.<h2>
<a name="Dordrecht"></a>Dordrecht</h2>In April 1600 Vossius broke off his theology studies to become vice-rector of the Latin school in Dordrecht. Soon he became rector of the school, which flourished under his guidance. In February 1602 he married Elisabeth Van den Corput (1578&#150;1606), the daughter of a Dordrecht clergyman. They had three children, of whom only the youngest, Joannes (1606&#150;1636), survived. Elisabeth died on 12 February 1606, and on 28 August 1607 Vossius married Elisabeth Junius (1585&#150;1659), daughter of the Leiden professor in theology Franciscus Junius, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15167/', "Franciscus Junius (1591&#150;1677)")</script>. Five more children were born in Dordrecht: Franciscus (1608&#150;1645), Antonius (1609&#150;1610), Matthaeus (1611&#150;1646), Dionysius (1612&#150;1633), and Cornelia (1613&#150;1638). As a student, Vossius had been adding to his father's library and he continued to do so in Dordrecht, and eventually acquired a large collection. A catalogue which he kept until 1630 has survived as well as a little notebook in which he recorded loans in later years. In 1606 he published his first substantial work, the <span class="italic">Oratoriarum institutionum libri sex</span> (&#145;Lectures in eloquence&#146;), a compendium summarizing all that had been published on rhetoric until the present time.<h2>
<a name="Leiden"></a>Leiden</h2>During the twelve-year truce (1609&#150;21) between the Netherlands and Spain, a fierce controversy broke out in the Dutch Reformed church between remonstrants and counter-remonstrants, respectively advocates of a more liberal interpretation of predestination theology and those who clung to the strict Calvinistic theology of divine predestination. Interwoven with this church conflict was a political conflict between the stadholder and the regents on the limitations of their power. The well-known scholar and diplomat Hugo Grotius invited Vossius to participate in this controversy, and from 1613 the two men were in busy correspondence. When Vossius was approached to fill the chair in theology at the Gymnasium Illustre in Steinfurt, Germany, Grotius procured him the post of regent of the Leiden Theological College in June 1615. The job proved a difficult one as the college was the training ground for future ministers for the church. Vossius himself steered a middle course in the theological conflict of those years and also tried to persuade his students to follow his example. But he nevertheless openly championed the cause of the remonstrants, who had been unjustly charged with Pelagian heresies by their opponents, with the publication of his study <span class="italic">Historia Pelagianismi</span>.<br>
<br>In 1618 the conflicts in the republic reached a critical stage. Stadholder Maurits took harsh measures, and had his foremost political opponents (among whom was Grotius) imprisoned. A national synod, held at Dordrecht, passed censure on the remonstrants. Vossius followed these events with an anxious mind. He tried not to issue provocative statements, but could not prevent his students from taking sides in the conflict. He did support his imprisoned friend Grotius and saw to it that he was regularly supplied with cases filled with books; Grotius in fact escaped prison in one of those cases in March 1621. But would Vossius himself escape unscathed? In Leiden a committee had been installed for the removal from the university of teachers and students who had supported the remonstrants. Vossius was dismissed as regent of the Collegium Theologicum, but he was allowed to continue as unofficial member of the academic community. His publications and the stand he had taken as regent had made him suspicious in the eyes of the now all-powerful counter-remonstrants, though apparently there were insufficient grounds for official censure. However, even after his dismissal, Vossius continued to be harassed by the church. Again and again in his career he had to defend himself against certain passages in his church-historical works.<br>
<br>Fortunately Vossius was protected by the university board, which was averse to the church's interfering with its staff. Thus in November 1620 Vossius was allowed to lecture at the Collegium Oratorium, and in 1621 he published a <span class="italic">Rhetorica contracta</span> (&#145;A brief course in eloquence&#146;). In November 1622 he was completely rehabilitated and appointed professor in eloquence and history. He enjoyed great esteem as professor, and was given a variety of responsibilities. When he was offered a chair in history at Cambridge in 1625, the curators of Leiden University made the counter-offer of the vacant chair in Greek language and literature in order to retain him. Vossius was also commissioned to refute Cardinal Baronius's monumental Catholic historiography. There were in addition ordinary executive chores: the educational reform of the Latin schools was particularly time-consuming, but as part of a committee of Leiden professors Vossius formulated an entirely new curriculum and edited new textbooks.<br>
<br>While in Leiden, Vossius revised the old grammatical textbooks of Ludolphus Lithocomus and Nicolaus Clenardus for Latin and Greek, and his own <span class="italic">Rhetorica contracta</span> for rhetoric. He also wrote elementary textbooks, such as the <span class="italic">Elementa rhetorica</span> (&#145;The first principles of rhetoric&#146;), which together with the <span class="italic">Latina grammatica</span> remained in use in Dutch schools through the nineteenth century. In the same period Vossius also published important scholarly works, such as his <span class="italic">Ars historica</span> (&#145;The science of history&#146;) in 1623 and the two lexicons of Latin and Greek historiographers in 1623 and 1627. His publications and his many pupils made him a much valued figure in the republic of letters. As the years progressed his correspondence grew: 1296 letters are known to have been written by him, and at least 2092 letters were addressed to him. Scholarly correspondence with students and scholars all over Europe forms a large part. Faithful letter writers included Hugo Grotius in France, Joannes Meursius in Denmark, Erycius Puteanus in Louvain, and the theologians Ludovicus Crocius and Matthias Martinius in Germany.<h2>
<a name="RelationswithEngland"></a>Relations with England</h2>Vossius had been informed by two English representatives at the Dordrecht national synod in 1618 that he had built a reputation for himself in England with his study on Pelagianism. There was considerable interest in his work in the circles of high-churchmen. Vossius for his part appreciated the Church of England because he felt that it remained close to the early church. Gradually the number of English friends and admirers grew. William Laud, later to become archbishop of Canterbury, especially exerted himself on Vossius's behalf, partly because the latter looked after Laud's interests in the Netherlands. Laud procured Vossius's son Joannes a fellowship in Cambridge and a prebend for Vossius senior in Canterbury. During the final months of 1629 Vossius was in England, where he was received by Charles I and was installed as a canon.<br>
<br>Vossius had several connections in England. In 1624 Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke, offered him a chair in history in Cambridge. Vossius also entertained good relations with the English ambassadors in the Netherlands Sir Dudley Carleton and Sir William Boswell. James Ussher, archbishop of Armagh, and Vossius were in correspondence on the subject of their joint interest in church antiquity. Mericus Casaubon, fellow canon at Canterbury, maintained Vossius's interests there. Edward Herbert, Lord Cherbury, contacted Vossius in connection with his book <span class="italic">De religione gentilium</span> (&#145;The religion of the pagans&#146;). Vossius was also in correspondence with the linguist Thomas Farnaby. For Vossius, England had thus become a second home. The civil war, which wrecked so much that was dear to him and ended in regicide, was to afflict him so deeply that he fell seriously ill as a result.<h2>
<a name="Amsterdamandfinalyears"></a>Amsterdam and final years</h2>In May 1631 Vossius exchanged Leiden for Amsterdam to lay the foundation for the Athenaeum Illustre, later the University of Amsterdam, as professor in history and political science. On 8 January 1632 Vossius officially opened the new educational institute with an inaugural lecture &#145;De historiae utilitate&#146; (&#145;On the usefulness of history&#146;). The athenaeum was then not yet a fully-fledged university, and was intended mainly to prepare matriculants of the Latin schools for the academic curriculum, but it soon became an important scholarly centre in its own right. During his time in Amsterdam, Vossius managed to publish some important works. In 1635 he brought out his monumental Latin grammar, the <span class="italic">Aristarchus, sive, De arte grammatica libri septem</span>. Another impressive work was his <span class="italic">Theologia gentilis</span> (&#145;The knowledge of God among the pagans&#146;), a brilliant and exhaustive summary of everything published on the subject of the natural phenomena that had led many to a belief in a creator. A very modern study on three old creeds was his <span class="italic">Dissertationes tres de tribus symbolis</span> of 1642. His last two major publications were the book on errors in Latin usage, <span class="italic">De vitiis sermonis</span> of 1645, and the <span class="italic">Poeticae institutiones</span> (&#145;Lessons in the poetical art&#146;) of 1647.<br>
<br>When Vossius came to Amsterdam he was the proud father of eight thriving and promising children: in addition to the five children born in Dordrecht, they were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28356/', "Isaac Vossius (1618&#150;1689)")</script>, Gerardus (1619&#150;1640), and Joanna (1623&#150;1640), all three of whom were born in Leiden. A few of the sons had already drawn attention to themselves with their scholarly publications, but the years in Amsterdam, which had started out so full of promise, were to become a period of intense sorrow. In 1633 the highly talented Dionysius died, and in the years that followed all but one of Vossius's children died (the last, Matthaeus, in 1646, leaving his parents two grandchildren). Isaac, the only child to survive his parents, accepted a post at the Swedish court and left his parental home in 1648. For Vossius himself, old and in ill health from a variety of causes, including a kidney complaint, the end came at home, Oudezijds Achterburgwal, after a brief and painful sickbed, on 17 March 1649. He was buried in the Nieuwe Kerk, Amsterdam, on 22 March.<h2>
<a name="Legacy"></a>Legacy</h2>Elisabeth Vossius, who survived her husband by ten years, settled the estate. Vossius's large library was sold to Queen Kristina of Sweden. A number of his works were published posthumously, such as a book on the various academic disciplines (1650), a lexicon of Latin and Greek poets from antiquity (1654), and a large etymological dictionary of the Latin language (1662). Thanks to the efforts of his son Isaac and grandson Gerardus Joannes (1645&#150;1717), the thousands of letters written by and to Vossius were preserved and are now to be found in libraries in Oxford, London, and Amsterdam. The last-named also became the depository of the many collections of Vossius's scholarly manuscripts. In 1690 Paulus Colomesius in London published some thousand letters in <span class="italic">Gerardi Joannis Vossii et clarorum virorum ad eum epistolae</span> (&#145;Letters by G. J. Vossius and by famous men written to him&#146;). At the turn of the century Vossius's collected works were issued in Amsterdam in six folio volumes.<br>
<br>After that, silence ruled. Vossius was one of the last of the great savants from the era of scholarly humanism and after him scholarship took a different direction. Organizing the rich heritage of the past was replaced by experimentation and progression, in search of new knowledge. Vossius, the great representative of late humanism, was the last one to stand in that older tradition. As an exceptionally erudite systematician, he summarized in concise manuals the achievements of the past. He was not a revolutionary thinker, though he did point the way to new methods for research for the future. Instead he was content that after him others would improve on his work. Serviceability was the cornerstone of his character: it was the driving force behind his scholarly work, and also prompted him to be ready for all who required his help. Next to his all-encompassing erudition, it was for this that he was justly admired by his contemporaries.<br>
