<span class="headword">Yorke, Sir  Charles</span>  (1790&#150;1880), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born on 7 December 1790, was the son of Colonel John Yorke, deputy lieutenant of the Tower of London from 1795 until his death on 26 January 1826, and his wife, Juliana, daughter of John Dodd of Swallowfield, Berkshire.<br>
<br>Yorke was commissioned as ensign in the 35th foot on 22 January 1807, became lieutenant on 18 February 1808, and on the 25th exchanged to the 52nd foot. He served with that regiment throughout the Peninsular War, being present at Vimeiro, Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro, Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, Salamanca, Vitoria, the battles of the Pyrenees, the Nivelle, and Nive, and at Orthez, where he was severely wounded. He was also wounded at Badajoz and the Nivelle. He afterwards received the Peninsular silver medal with ten clasps. He was promoted captain on 24 December 1813.<br>
<br>At Waterloo, Yorke was extra aide-de-camp to Major-General Adam, who commanded the brigade of which the 52nd formed part. He received the Waterloo medal. He was placed on half pay on 25 February 1816, but was appointed to the 13th foot on 7 August 1817, and exchanged back to the 52nd on 2 July 1818. On 9 June 1825 he was given an unattached majority, and again went on half pay. On 30 November 1826 he was made lieutenant-colonel and inspecting field officer of militia. He became colonel on 23 November 1841, and was assistant quartermaster-general, first at Cork and afterwards at Manchester from 1842 to 1851.<br>
<br>On 11 November 1851 Yorke was promoted major-general. He was sent to the Cape, and served in the Cape Frontier War of 1852 as second in command under General Cathcart. He was given a reward for distinguished service on 13 July 1853. In May 1854 he succeeded Colonel Airey as military secretary at headquarters in England, and consequently did not serve in the Crimea. As military secretary he was responsible for much of the paperwork at military headquarters in London.<br>
<br>Yorke was made colonel of the 33rd foot on 27 February 1855, and KCB on 5 February 1856. He became lieutenant-general on 13 February 1859, and was made GCB on 29 June 1860, when he ceased to be military secretary. In that office it is said that, as Lord Fitzroy Somerset had &#145;softened the asperity of the Iron Duke, Sir C. Yorke neutralised the exuberant kindness of the Duke of Cambridge&#146;  (Stocqueler, 250). He was made colonel-commandant of the 2nd battalion of the rifle brigade on 1 April 1863, and became general on 5 September 1865. On 5 April 1875 he was appointed constable of the Tower of London, and on 2 June 1877 he was made field marshal, a reward for competence and long service rather than distinction. He died, unmarried, at his home, 27 South Street, Grosvenor Square, on 20 November 1880, and was buried on the 24th at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
