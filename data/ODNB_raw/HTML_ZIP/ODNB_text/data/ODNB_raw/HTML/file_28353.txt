<span class="headword">Holst,  Theodor Richard Edward  von</span>  (1810&#150;1844), <span class="occ">literary painter</span>, born in London on 3 September 1810, was the fourth of the five children of Matthias von Holst (<i>c</i>.1767&#150;1854), professor of music and composer, who was of Livonian descent, and his Russian wife, Katharina Rogge (<i>d</i>. 1838). His precocious talent for drawing was quickly recognized by Henry Fuseli and Sir Thomas Lawrence, the latter buying the first of many drawings from von Holst when he was only ten years old. However, the subsequent commission of erotic drawings, of which some were purportedly destined for George IV, provoked posthumous criticism of Lawrence's patronage. Von Holst became a favourite pupil of Fuseli and spent some time copying from the antique in the British Museum before his admission as a student to the Royal Academy Schools in 1824. His early instruction by Fuseli exerted such a powerful influence on his artistic development that some of his work is almost indistinguishable from that of his master.<br>
<br>As with Fuseli, almost all von Holst's subjects were derived from literature: Virgil, Dante, Shakespeare, Shelley, and Victor Hugo each inspired at least one major work, but it was the German Romantics, particularly Goethe, E. T. A. Hoffmann, and Baron de la Motte-Fouqu&eacute;, which provided the themes for almost half his output. Thus von Holst became the most prolific English illustrator of German Romance, making his exhibition d&eacute;but with <span class="italic">Witches Hastening to the Hartzgebirg</span> (exh. RA, 1827) from Goethe's <span class="italic">Faust</span>, his favourite source throughout his life. While his exceptional imagination and draughtsmanship were widely praised, his choice of subjects were out of step with the age and public taste. His penchant for the demonic, supernatural, and erotic led to a degree of neglect that was otherwise undeserved.<br>
<br>Von Holst exhibited forty-nine paintings at the major London exhibitions and the most successful of these, his later romanticized female portraits, were bought by some of the leading aristocratic collectors of the day. He was awarded a premium of 50 guineas for <span class="italic">The Raising of Jairus's Daughter</span> by the British Institution in 1841; this work was later engraved. In the same year, he married Amelia Thomasina Symmes Villard (<i>b</i>. 1820), at Marylebone on 17 August. Little is known about their relationship apart from a comment by William Bell Scott that von Holst desired an open marriage but his wife &#145;a wild creature &hellip; returned him an unconquerable jealousy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiographical Notes</span>, 1892, 163).<br>
<br>Von Holst's greatest admirer was Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who considered him a significant link between the older generation of English Romantic painters, such as Fuseli and William Blake, and the Pre-Raphaelite circle. Early drawings by Rossetti show a considerable debt to von Holst, as does his poem &#145;The Card-Dealer&#146;, inspired by von Holst's portentous portrayal of <span class="italic">The Wish</span> (exh. British Institution, 1841). His medievalism, jewel-like colours, and firm drawing were much admired by the Pre-Raphaelites, who patronized Campbell's Scotch Stores restaurant in Soho because it was adorned with von Holst's pictures.<br>
<br>Von Holst was the first to illustrate Mary Shelley's <span class="italic">Frankenstein</span> by contributing two designs for Henry Colburn's <span class="roman">Standard Novels</span> edition of 1831. The following year Edward Bulwer-Lytton bought <span class="italic">The Drinking Scene from &#145;Faust&#146;</span> and later based his novel <span class="italic">Lucretia, or, The Children of Night</span> (1846) on a close friend of von Holst's and fellow disciple of Fuseli, the infamous Thomas Griffiths Wainewright. Von Holst was attempting to finish a gratis portrait of Bulwer-Lytton when he died from disease of the liver at his home, 2 Percy Street, Bedford Square, London, on 14 February 1844; he was buried in Kensal Green cemetery on 21 February. He was a pipe-smoker and is also likely to have indulged in opium, a particular fad of the time. The sale of his remaining works took place at Christie and Manson on 26 June. His great-nephew was the composer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33963/', "Gustav Holst")</script>.<br>
