<span class="headword">Maxwell,  Henry</span>  (1668/9&#150;1730), <span class="occ">politician and pamphleteer</span>, was born in Finnebrogue, co. Down, Ireland, the son of the Revd Robert Maxwell (<i>d</i>. 1686?), Church of Ireland clergyman, and Jane Chichester, daughter of the Revd Robert Chichester of Belfast. His family appears to have been of Scottish descent. Educated in his early years by a Mr Harvey, he entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1683, aged fourteen; he received the degree of BA in 1688 and that of LLD (<i>speciali gratia</i>) in 1718. He was a member of the Church of Ireland, and was married twice, first to his second cousin, Jane Maxwell, daughter of the Revd Henry Maxwell, of Armagh, and sister to John Maxwell, first Lord Farnham, and second in 1713, with a dowry of &pound;1500, to Dorothy Brice (<i>bap</i>. 1690, <i>d</i>. 1725), daughter of Edward Brice, a Belfast merchant and Presbyterian of Scottish descent.<br>
<br>After having been successful in a by-election in 1698 Maxwell sat in every Irish parliament until his death, representing the boroughs of Bangor in co. Down (1698&#150;1713) and Killybegs (1713&#150;15) and Donegal (1715&#150;30) in co. Donegal, the latter two on the interest of William Conolly, of whom he was a close adherent. Identified as a whig, Maxwell was an active participant in Anglo-Irish politics and has been associated with the reforming group of &#145;real Whigs&#146;  (Robbins, 6) centred around Robert Molesworth. However, Maxwell disagreed with this group in certain areas, most notably in his strong opposition to the repeal of the test imposed on protestant dissenters in Ireland. He was also associated with William Molyneux, a connection that was reflected in his writings. The first pamphlet attributed to Maxwell, <span class="italic">Anguis in herba, or, The Fatal Consequences of a Treaty with France</span> (1702), was originally published &#145;a little before the death of the late King William, and about the time the second Grand Alliance was formed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anguis in herba</span>, 2). It was published for a third time in 1711, probably as part of the whig opposition to the peace negotiations in the last years of the War of the Spanish Succession. In 1703 he produced his most famous work, published the following year, <span class="italic">An essay upon an union of Ireland with England: most humbly offered to the consideration of the queen's most excellent majesty, and both houses of parliament</span> (1704), in which, motivated by discontent over the subordination of the Irish parliament to that of England, he argued that a union was the only practical solution to ongoing constitutional conflicts, as it would create greater political harmony between the two kingdoms and would be of mutual commercial and economic benefit. He also argued for a more comprehensive union than the type of union espoused by Molyneux or the Molesworth group. However, despite Irish public and parliamentary opinion becoming increasingly in favour of a union, his pamphlet made no impact in England. His continuing concern with English interference in Irish affairs under the existing constitutional relationship led to his expression of dissatisfaction with the appointment of an Englishman to the bishopric of Meath in 1715 and his association with the opposition to the <span class="roman">Declaratory Act</span> of 1720.<br>
<br>Maxwell's next excursion into political pamphleteering occurred in 1721 as part of the disputes over the establishment of a Bank of Ireland, which saw the outbreak of a pamphlet war in the autumn and winter of that year. Although many of the contributions were &#145;hastily written trifles&#146;  (Burns, 1.128), Maxwell's two tracts of November and December stood out as the best arguments put forward for a national bank. His first pamphlet, <span class="italic">Reasons Offered for Erecting a Bank in Ireland, in a Letter to H[ercules] Rowley, Esq.</span> (1721), which quickly went through two editions, argued for a bank on economic grounds, emphasizing how a bank would stabilize interest rates and increase the amount of currency available for trade. He also tried to assuage the fears of the landed interest that a bank would lead to a land tax and ultimately undermine the accepted land-based structure of society. His arguments prompted a response from Rowley, who appears to have been Maxwell's uncle, in opposition to a bank. Maxwell replied in <span class="italic">Mr Maxwell's Second Letter to Mr Rowley, wherein the Objections Against the Bank are Answered</span> (1721), although his arguments failed to convince his fellow MPs, and the proposals were dropped. Maxwell avoided public office for most of his political career until 1727, when he was sworn of the Irish privy council.<br>
<br>Maxwell died in Dublin on 12 February 1730. His father-in-law, Edward Brice, as next of kin to Maxwell's three children, Robert, Edward, and Margaret, became their guardian and the administrator of the family estate, since Maxwell had died intestate and all three children were still in their minority. Maxwell was buried in St Mary's Church in Dublin.<br>
