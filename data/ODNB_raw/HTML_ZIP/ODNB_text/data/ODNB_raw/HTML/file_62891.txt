<span class="headword">Hughes,  Ezekiel</span>  (1766&#150;1849), <span class="occ">settler in America</span>, was born at Cwm Carnedd Uchaf, Llanbrynmair, Montgomeryshire, on 22 August 1766, the second son of Richard Hughes (1734/5&#150;1815), freehold farmer, and his wife, Ann Jones. Hughes received some education at Shrewsbury, and in May 1786 he was bound apprentice to John Tibbot, a clock- and watchmaker at Newtown, Montgomeryshire. After completing his apprenticeship in 1789, Hughes established his own clock-making business at Machynlleth. It was during this period that he came under the influence of the republican and radical William Jones (1726&#150;1795) of Llangadfan. Inspired by Jones's dream of establishing a new Welsh community in a land free from religious, social, and political oppression, Hughes, together with his cousin Edward Bebb, George Roberts (1769&#150;1853)&#151;the younger brother of the Revd John Roberts (1767&#150;1834)&#151;and others, decided to emigrate to America. In mid-July 1795 they led a small party of emigrants from Llanbrynmair and walked to Carmarthen, from where they sailed to Bristol. On 6 August they left Bristol and sailed in the <i>Maria</i> for Philadelphia, where they arrived on 25 October. After spending the winter in the city, Hughes and Edward Bebb set off in April 1796 on the long trail to the River Ohio. Within three months they had reached Fort Washington, now known as Cincinnati, a town which Hughes estimated to be &#145;as large as Machynlleth (a town in Wales of about 800 inhabitants)&#146;  (Peate, &#145;Ezekiel Hughes's autobiography&#146;, 133). There, near the Miami River, Hughes and Edward Bebb (whose son William Bebb became governor of Ohio) bought 100 acres of land, which they began to cultivate. In September 1802 Hughes returned to Wales and in May 1803 married Margaret Bebb of Brynaerau, Llanbrynmair. The couple returned to America, but within less than a year Margaret died, and was buried in the first grave to be opened at Berea. In 1808 Hughes married Mary Ewing, a native of Pennsylvania, and they had nine children.<br>
<br>Hughes undertook many important public and official roles in his adopted country. In 1805 the governor of Ohio appointed him and two others to plan and construct a new road from the mouth of the Miami River to the town of Hamilton, and the following year he was appointed the first justice of the peace in the district. As the years went by he bought a great deal of land which he leased at reasonable rates to his tenants. Hughes also generously supported the religious life of the district. He played an instrumental role in the establishment of the Welsh Congregational chapel at Paddy's Run in 1803, some 10 miles from his home. In 1828 he became a member at Berea, a Presbyterian chapel which was erected in 1822 upon land which he himself donated. William Henry Harrison, who later became president of the USA, attended the same class as Hughes at Berea Sunday school, and the two became great personal friends. As well as helping to build the chapel, Hughes was largely responsible for supporting the work of the ministry.<br>
<br>Despite suffering a serious fall in 1820 which left him lame, Hughes continued to serve his church and his community for many years. He was an extremely popular man who was fondly remembered by his tenants and by the dozens of Welsh emigrant families whom he warmly welcomed to the area. He died on 2 September 1849 at Miami, Ohio, and was buried the following day at Berea cemetery. At his funeral he was described as &#145;a friend of the poor, a true patriot, and a loyal Christian&#146;  (<span class="italic">Y Cenhadwr Americanaidd</span>, Dec 1849). The tale of his eventful journey from Llanbrynmair to Ohio was fictionalized by W. Ambrose Bebb (1894&#150;1955) in the novel <span class="italic">Dial y tir</span> (&#145;The land's revenge&#146;), published in 1945.<br>
