<span class="headword">Phillimore,  John Swinnerton</span>  (1873&#150;1926), <span class="occ">classical scholar and poet</span>, was born at Boconnoc, Cornwall, on 26 February 1873, the fourth son of Vice-Admiral Sir Augustus Phillimore (1822&#150;1897), of Shedfield, Hampshire, and his wife, Harriet Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1924), second daughter of the Hon. George Matthew Fortescue, of Boconnoc, MP for Hindon, Wiltshire, in 1826&#150;31. He was a first cousin of Walter Phillimore, first Baron Phillimore. He was educated at Westminster School, and proceeded with a scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford. At Westminster his talent was recognized and fostered by William Gunion Rutherford, and at Oxford he proved himself the best classical scholar of his time. He obtained first classes in classical moderations (1893) and in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1895), and won the Hertford and Craven scholarships (1892), the Ireland scholarship (1893), and the chancellor's prize for Latin verse (1894). He was already writing distinguished verse, and, like his friend Hilaire Belloc, he was a leading figure at the Oxford Union, of which he became president in 1895.<br>
<br>Phillimore was appointed a lecturer of Christ Church in 1895, student in 1896, and tutor in 1898. With one of his colleagues, S. G. Owen, he published in 1898, under the title <span class="italic">Musa clauda</span>, a collection of versions from English into Latin elegiac verse. He took up the study of Russian, and wrote a translation of Mikhail Lermontov's novel <span class="italic">A Hero of Nowadays</span> (not published until 1921). He also took a serious interest in politics at this period, and he was one of the contributors to the volume <span class="italic">Essays in Liberalism by Six Oxford Men</span> (1897). In the vacation much of his time was spent in mountaineering in the Dolomites. In recognition of his skill and daring the guides and president of the Club Alpino decided that &#145;one of the fine ascents he had made should bear his name&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1899, at the age of twenty-six, Phillimore was appointed to succeed Professor Gilbert Murray in the chair of Greek in the University of Glasgow. He married in 1900 (Margaret) Cecily, only daughter of the Revd Spencer Compton Spencer-Smith, vicar of Kingston, Dorset, and they had one son and one daughter. For some years he took a prominent part in the political life of the west of Scotland as a Liberal Imperialist, but his interests were steadily concentrating on his work as a scholar and teacher. In 1902 he published a translation in rhymed verse of three plays of Sophocles, but the texts of Propertius (1901) and of Statius's <span class="italic">Silvae</span> (1905), which he revised for the Clarendon Press at this period, showed where his real bent lay.<br>
<br>It was a great satisfaction to Phillimore when in 1906 he was transferred from the chair of Greek to that of humanity (Latin), rendered vacant by the retirement of Professor George Gilbert Ramsay. Thenceforward he contributed to the <span class="italic">Classical Quarterly</span>, to the <span class="italic">Classical Review</span>, to <span class="italic">Mnemosyne</span>, and to other periodicals a steady stream of notes, linguistic and textual, on Latin authors. He published a translation and an <span class="italic">Index verborum</span> of Propertius (1906), and he set to work upon a large-scale edition of that poet. His facility in Greek now exercised itself in studies of the intellectual and religious life of the Roman imperial period; and a translation of Philostratus's <span class="italic">Apollonius of Tyana</span>, introduced by a characteristic essay, appeared in two volumes in 1912. From time to time he published papers and addresses on classical subjects, notably &#145;The Greek romances&#146; (in <span class="italic">English Literature and the Classics</span>, 1912), <span class="italic">Some Remarks on Translation and Translators</span> (1919), <span class="italic">The Revival of Criticism</span> (1919), <span class="italic">&#145;Ille ego&#146;</span> (1920), and <span class="italic">Pastoral and Allegory</span> (1925).<br>
<br>Phillimore's growing reputation at home and abroad was shown by the conferment upon him of the honorary degree of LLD by the University of St Andrews (1917) and of that of LittD by Trinity College, Dublin (1921); by the dedication to him, as &#145;philologue, humaniste, po&egrave;te&#146;, of Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Plessis's edition of the <span class="italic">Odes</span> of Horace (1924); and by his appointment for the year 1914&#150;15 to the Sather professorship in classics in the University of California. This appointment he was prevented from taking up by the outbreak of the First World War.<br>
<br>In 1902 Phillimore published <span class="italic">Poems</span>, a volume containing a selection of the verse which he had written up to that year. He issued a second volume in 1918 under the title <span class="italic">Things New and Old</span>. The change of outlook evident in these two volumes is explained by the fact that in 1906 Phillimore was received into the Roman Catholic church. He wrote occasionally for the <span class="italic">Dublin Review</span>, his contributions including a notable essay, &#145;Blessed Thomas More and the arrest of humanism in England&#146; (1913). A substantial work on Christian Latin poetry he left unfinished. In the year of his death he published in a popular series <span class="italic">The Hundred Best Latin Hymns</span> (1926). It was characteristic of his versatility that in the same year he wrote an introduction to a reprint of Francis Hickes's translation of the <span class="italic">Vera historia</span> of Lucian.<br>
<br>Phillimore was an occasional contributor to the <span class="italic">Eye Witness</span>, to its successor the <span class="italic">New Witness</span>, and to <span class="italic">G. K.'s Weekly</span>. As his sympathetic association with those reviews indicated, Phillimore no longer concerned himself with party politics, but he maintained from a new angle his interest in national affairs and international relations, and he welcomed the opportunity to go to France towards the close of the war as a representative of the Franco-Scottish Society. At the universities of Bordeaux and Toulouse and at the Sorbonne he delivered addresses on the cultural relations of Great Britain with France and with Germany. In the public life of the west of Scotland he held a position of his own as a witty speaker and an admired lecturer on a wide variety of topics, among which he once ventured to include the national poet.<br>
<br>But Phillimore's main concern was with his duties at the university. He was scrupulously diligent in attendance at academic committees, and he took his full share in the routine of his chair. Most of the work he published was a by-product of his careful preparation of his lectures. He would undoubtedly have published more had he been a less conscientious teacher, but he took this role seriously and was painstaking in his preparation. As one former student recalled, his Latin teaching was never brought out of &#145;cold storage&#146;. The regard in which he was held by his students found expression in January 1925 when, in their name, a portrait of him painted by Maurice Greiffenhagen was presented to the university. Yet Phillimore's influence was not confined to the Latin classroom. When the students of Glasgow first decided to issue <span class="italic">University Verses</span> (1910), and when all four Scottish universities later combined to publish <span class="italic">Scottish University Verses</span> (1923), he was invited on each occasion to supply the preface introducing the volume to the public. As professor of humanity he exercised a profound influence upon the student body as a whole, and through it upon the cultural life of Scotland. He died at his home, Cam Cottage, Shedfield, Hampshire, on 16 November 1926; he was survived by his wife.<br>
