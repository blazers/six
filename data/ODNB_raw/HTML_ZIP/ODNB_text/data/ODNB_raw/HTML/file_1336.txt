<span class="headword">Barbour,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1330&#150;1395), <span class="occ">ecclesiastic and verse historian</span>, was author of the Old or Middle Scots poem <span class="italic">The Bruce</span>. His birth is usually placed about 1325, as much to give him a toehold in Robert I's reign as for anything his career tells us, and a slightly later date seems likelier. The trade name he inherited suggests that his father was a barber, and John's first appearance, in 1356 resigning the precentorship of Dunkeld which he held for just a year, links his family to that see. <span class="italic">The Bruce</span> records the dash and bravery of William Sinclair, bishop of Dunkeld (<i>d</i>. 1337), and his following in repelling an English force in 1317; John may have grown up on the fringes of the bishop's household, his father barber to Bishop William and perhaps to his successors, for when John obtained the precentorship in 1355 he was evidently at the papal court at Avignon with the new bishop, previously precentor. His promotion may also have been earned by their diplomatic activity on behalf of the guardian, Robert Stewart: in 1354 David II had been about to return from captivity in England, but the unenthusiastic guardian allowed the ransom negotiations to lapse while negotiating for military assistance from France.<br>
<br>In 1356 Barbour was appointed to the archdeaconry of Aberdeen, presumably from the same Stewart patronage. But David II came home in November 1357 for an even larger ransom, at which prospect Barbour had sought leave to study at Oxford; he was the first Scot to be granted a safe conduct for that purpose in August 1357 and in September was his bishop's proctor at the council which discussed the king's release. He had further English safe conducts to leave Scotland during the years 1357&#150;71, when David II was an active king, for study in England (1364), to visit St Denis (1365), and to study in France (1368), which he probably did in the following three years. That he had been to a university is almost certain because he is called on occasion master, but given the rarity of this description it is likely that he had not graduated and was not entitled to it.<br>
<br>After 1356 Barbour received no further advancement in his long life, certainly not the bishopric for which he was as well qualified as any of the bishops. Everything suggests that he was a known client of Robert Stewart, who in 1371 at last ascended the throne as Robert II. Barbour, it seems, wrote <span class="italic">The Bruce</span> for this royal patron, whose father, Walter, appears in a generous measure and light in its pages. When Barbour began to write is a matter of judgement, but the poem as it stands must have taken two or more years, perhaps as many as five or six. Composition started, therefore, about 1372 and detained him at or brought him to court, as a result of which he was employed in February 1373 as one of the auditors at the exchequer (worth &pound;40 per annum), acting for the second time in that office two years later. The date 1375 marks the conclusion of the poem he planned and was followed by a change in his career, for he now appears in a north-eastern context: in 1378 the king granted him a pension of &pound;1 annually from Aberdeen burgh's annual payment to the crown. This was paid until his death and (since the grant was perpetual, to assigns) from 1395 to his legatees, the cathedral chapter; in 1429 it was said to have been granted &#145;for the compilation of the book of the deeds of the late King Robert the Bruce&#146;  (Burnett and others, 4.457).<br>
<br>The poem of 1375, written in rhyming octosyllabic couplets, sketches the Bruce claim to the throne in 1292, but moves rapidly to the Edwardian occupation, presumably of 1304. After the killing of Sir John Comyn, cursorily described, it gives a vivid depiction of the battle of Methven on 19 June 1306 and an extended treatment of the early tribulations of Robert I and of Sir James Douglas. It skims over the years 1309&#150;13, partly because there was a truce, but mainly, it would seem, because of lack of sources. The narrative resumes with the taking of Perth, Roxburgh, and Edinburgh, going on to a full account of the battle of Bannockburn and the king at the top in the revolution of Fortune's wheel; there follow, briefly, the return of the king's daughter, her marriage to Walter Stewart, and the birth of their child Robert, in the fifth year of whose reign, 1375, this poem is being written. It is the only year date in the whole poem, and surely marks the end of the original composition, over 8000 lines long. It is a &#145;romance&#146; (Barbour's word) of chivalry, with emphasis on loyalty, bravery, and wisdom. It claims to be truthful, but Barbour has often been misled by his sources, as over the chronology of events leading to Bannockburn, and sometimes tailors the facts to create a better literary effect, as when Edward I condemns to death the prisoners taken at Kildrummy, an action wrongly placed for dramatic impact at the time of Edward's own death. It has nothing on romantic love, and women are rare in its pages. Its most famous passage is an encomium of freedom, which, it can reasonably be pointed out, in Barbour is enjoyed by men of nobility.<br>
<br>In the 1380s Barbour returned to court, serving as auditor again in 1383, 1384, and 1385; he had several one-off gifts of money from the king in 1382&#150;6 and in 1388 an annual pension of &pound;10 for life, this last suggesting that he had satisfactorily completed a literary work, but was not to be given a bishopric. The work was probably the continuation of <span class="italic">The Bruce</span>, in a further 5000 lines, up to the deaths of Sir James Douglas (1330) and Thomas Randolph, earl of Moray (1332). These sections show a less sure touch and lack the exempla from French romances which are a marked feature of the earlier part.<br>
<br>The division of the whole poem into twenty books is entirely modern. Barbour used a collection of tales of the king's adventures in 1306&#150;8 and a narrative, perhaps put together about 1332 from some annals and personal recollections of the rest of the reign. But the main chivalrous character, of whom a vivid picture is given, is Douglas, and a literary life of him was surely known to Barbour. A highly coloured, minstrel-like narrative of Edward Bruce would explain the erratic account of the Irish campaigns, a tenth of the poem. There are those, however, who would credit Barbour with piecing much of the story together himself, from reminiscences collected by himself, on the grounds that he virtually never mentions written sources, but frequently says, &#145;I heard tell&#146;.<br>
<br>What else did Barbour write? Before 1449 the chroniclers Wyntoun and Bower had ascribed to him <span class="italic">The Bruce</span> (sections and lines from which were silently borrowed by Wyntoun), <span class="italic">The Brut</span>, <span class="italic">The Stewartis Oryginalle</span>, and <span class="italic">The Stewartis Genealogy</span>. The last two are certainly identical, and if a mythical Trojan origin were suggested for the Stewarts, <span class="italic">The Brut</span> could be another title for the same. They surely confirm that Barbour devoted his literary talents pretty single-mindedly to one family, the Stewarts. And whether one or two works, they are lost. Although <span class="italic">The Bruce</span> survives in only two manuscripts, it was clearly influential upon all later Scottish historiography and pseudo-history, for Blind Hary took episodes from it shamelessly to attribute to Wallace. A number of other works were once said to have come from Barbour's pen: <span class="italic">The Buik of Alexander</span>, with many unattributed borrowings from <span class="italic">The Bruce</span>, but ascribed to 1438 in the manuscript of its text; sections of a translation of Guido delle Colonne's Latin history of the taking of Troy; and all or part of a translation of the legends of the saints. Cogent reasons have been given for rejecting all the ingenious hypotheses supporting these attributions.<br>
<br>His patron, Robert II, having died in 1390, Barbour was at Aberdeen in 1391&#150;2, and probably until his death. Aberdeen Cathedral lists give the anniversary of his death on 13 and 14 March, and the transfer of his &pound;1 pension shows that the year was 1395; it is likely that he was buried in the cathedral.<br>
