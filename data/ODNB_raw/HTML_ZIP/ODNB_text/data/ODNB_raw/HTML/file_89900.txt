<span class="headword">Knight, Sir  Arthur William</span>  (1917&#150;2003), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, was born on 29 March 1917 at 47 Park Road, Tottenham, London, the son of Arthur Frederick Knight, a steel hardener and later a railway porter, and his wife, Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Scott. He was educated at Tottenham county school until the age of sixteen, when he joined J. Sainsbury at Blackfriars as a clerk. While working there he took evening classes at the London School of Economics, graduating with a first-class degree in commerce. After spending a year in the LSE's department of business administration he joined Courtaulds in 1938 as a junior economist; the company was then one of the world's largest rayon manufacturers.<br>
<br>Knight's economics training was put to good use during the Second World War. He worked for the Special Operations Executive, was posted to north Africa, and was later given responsibility for finance in the control commission for Austria. He rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In 1945 he married (Beatrice) Joan Osborne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Oppenheim, and they later had three daughters and one son. She died in 1968, and on 1 July 1972 he married Sheila Elsie Whiteman, civil servant, and daughter of Bernard Whiteman, electrician. There were no children of this second marriage.<br>
<br>Knight's wartime experience and his experience in the allied administration of Austria gave him an international outlook which was to prove valuable when he rejoined Courtaulds in 1946. He was assigned to the overseas investments department, dealing with the company's subsidiaries and joint ventures in North America, continental Europe, and Australia. He acquired useful knowledge about the world fibre market and Courtaulds' principal competitors. By the 1950s the company was facing serious problems. It had lost its valuable American subsidiary, American Viscose, sold in 1941 at the government's behest as part of the lend-lease agreement with the USA. It was also heavily committed to rayon at a time when demand was shifting to other synthetic fibres&#151;nylon, polyester, and acrylic. Courtaulds had a joint venture in nylon with Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), known as British Nylon Spinners, and it was developing an acrylic fibre of its own. But it was a long way behind the leaders in the synthetic fibre business, and there was no easy way of catching up. One response was to diversify into other industries. This effort was led by Frank Kearton, an ambitious former ICI chemical engineer who was emerging as the most forceful figure on the Courtaulds board. Knight assisted Kearton in the diversification programme, and was involved in several substantial acquisitions, principally in paints and packaging. He joined the board in 1958 and became finance director three years later. He introduced a more sophisticated approach to financial control, pioneering the use of discounted cash flow techniques for assessing new investments.<br>
<br>As finance director Knight had an important supporting role in the events surrounding the attempted takeover of Courtaulds by ICI in 1961&#150;2. This was an extraordinary event in British business history&#151;by far the biggest hostile takeover by then launched in the UK&#151;and a turning-point for Courtaulds itself. The ICI board, led by its chairman, Paul Chambers, argued that a merger would consolidate the UK's fibre industry in the hands of a single strong group, and eliminate the many sources of friction that had grown up between the two companies. Courtaulds was a partner with ICI in British Nylon Spinners, but also a competitor, and a large customer for ICI's intermediate chemicals. The board of Courtaulds was divided, but Kearton opposed the bid, and he was supported by Knight and several other directors. Their opposition was not to the industrial logic behind the bid, but to the price ICI was offering. But as the battle became more heated, antagonism between the two sides increased, and, even though ICI improved its offer, the Courtaulds board resolved to stay independent. When the offer was put to shareholders ICI won only 38 per cent of the votes. Knight subsequently negotiated an arrangement whereby ICI gave up this shareholding in return for Courtaulds' stake in BNS.<br>
<br>While the defeat of ICI was widely seen as a triumph for Kearton and the new men at Courtaulds, it did nothing to solve the company's strategic problems. Even though the new acrylic fibre, Courtelle, was doing well, the company was still uncomfortably dependent on the slow-growing rayon market. To make matters worse, its principal customer was the Lancashire textile industry, which appeared to be in the throes of irreversible decline. This industry was suffering not only from obsolete equipment and poor management, but also from increasing imports of low-cost fabric from British overseas territories and Commonwealth countries&#151;principally Hong Kong, India, and Pakistan&#151;whose products were allowed into the UK free of duty. The challenge for Kearton, who became chairman of the company in 1964, was to find a way out of this dilemma. His solution was for Courtaulds to embark on a policy of vertical integration&#151;investing in all phases of the textile business, including spinning, weaving, knitting, and garment-making. Part of the rationale was to secure captive outlets for Courtaulds' fibres&#151;not just rayon, but also Courtelle, and the new ventures in nylon and polyester, where Courtaulds faced strong competition from established suppliers such as ICI and Du Pont. Knight, who was appointed a deputy chairman in 1970, worked closely with Kearton on this strategy (although their personal relations were often tense), and provided much of the intellectual rationale for it. His thinking was influenced by the example of the USA, where big textile companies such as Burlington Mills had prospered by investing in large, well-equipped mills to churn out standard fabric in very long runs. Knight believed that the same approach could work in the UK; an injection of capital, technology, and new management would allow the British textile industry to become the low-cost supplier to the rest of Europe.<br>
<br>This strategy depended crucially on the willingness of the British government to provide some relief against import competition. Knight tried to convince the politicians that a period of protection would give the textile industry the necessary breathing-space in which to put its house in order. As he explained in a book published in 1974, <span class="italic">Private Enterprise and Public Intervention: the Courtaulds Experience</span>, he saw a parallel between the textile situation in the UK and the economic arguments often used to support &#145;infant&#146; industries. A rebirth, he wrote, was as important as a new birth  (Knight, 198). Some concessions were obtained, notably a decision by the Labour government in 1969 to impose a tariff on Commonwealth textile suppliers. But the extent of protection was less than Knight had hoped for. Meanwhile vertical integration proved more difficult to implement than he and Kearton had expected. It was a production-orientated approach which, by forcing the company's newly acquired textile mills to buy fibre from Courtaulds, took too little account of what the customer wanted. Moreover, the comparison with the USA turned out to be misleading; the European market was more diverse and more fragmented, offering less scope than the USA for high-volume production of standard yarns and fabrics.<br>
<br>By the time Kearton retired from the chairmanship in 1975, to be succeeded by Knight, it was clear that the &#145;grand design&#146; was failing. Knight, who was knighted that year, largely abandoned vertical integration, and allowed the mills to buy from competing fibre suppliers. Although he still believed in standardization and economies of scale as an appropriate strategy for the British textile industry, he took a more realistic view of what could be achieved through new investment. By replacing Kearton's one-man rule with a greater degree of delegation and collegiality, he brought some order into a group which, thanks to the hectic acquisition activity of the preceding decade, had become a complex collection of disparate activities. He also sought to rebuild relationships with the company's key customers, principally Marks and Spencer. When Knight retired in 1979 some of the excesses stemming from the Kearton era had been corrected, although there were still huge problems left for his successor to deal with.<br>
<br>Knight was unusual among British industrialists in his intellectual approach to business; he had a strong commitment to management education, helping to set up the Manchester Business School in 1964 and serving on the school's council for several years. As he showed in his book, he also had a clear vision of how government and the private sector could work together to improve the UK's industrial performance. It was partly for that reason that he agreed, after retiring from Courtaulds, to take on the chairmanship of the National Enterprise Board (NEB), the industrial development agency that had been set up by the outgoing Labour government as the vehicle for extensive state intervention in industry. Knight presided over the disposal of several NEB shareholdings, but he was frustrated by the restrictions imposed on him by the Thatcher government. He had hoped to be able to reinvest the proceeds of NEB sales in new ventures, but this did not accord with the non-interventionist stance of the new government. He resigned from the NEB in 1980, after little more than a year in the post.<br>
<br>Although Knight was in demand as a non-executive director after he had left Courtaulds (he served on the board of Dunlop Holdings from 1981 to 1984), he spent much of his time at his alma mater, the London School of Economics. He was a member of the LSE's court of governors from 1971 to 1994, and was made an honorary fellow in 1984. He had a particular interest in business history and industrial policy, but he also thought deeply, and read widely, about the future of the capitalist system. Always willing to talk frankly about his own business experience, he was a valuable source of ideas and intellectual stimulation for his LSE colleagues. In retirement he lived at Charlton End, near Chichester, Sussex. He died at the Nuffield Hospital, Broyle Road, Chichester, on 5 April 2003, of cancer, and was survived by his second wife, Sheila, and the four children of his first marriage.<br>
