<span class="headword">Allen,  John Romilly</span>  (1847&#150;1907), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, born at Park Village West, Regent's Park, London, on 9 June 1847, was the eldest son of George Baugh Allen (1821&#150;1898), a well-known special pleader of the Inner Temple, of Cil-rhiw, near Narberth, Pembrokeshire, and his wife, Dorothea Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1868), third daughter of Roger Eaton of Parc Glas, Pembrokeshire. Allen was educated at King's College School, London (1857&#150;60), Rugby School (1860&#150;63), and King's College, London (1864&#150;6). In 1867 he was articled to G. F. Lyster, engineer in chief to the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, with whom he remained until 1870. He was next employed as resident engineer to the Persian railways of Baron Julius de Reuter and then in supervising the construction of docks at Leith, near Edinburgh, and at Boston, Lincolnshire. Meanwhile he was interested in archaeology, and to this pursuit, and particularly to the study of prehistoric antiquities and of pre-Norman art in Great Britain, he devoted the rest of his life. His earliest contribution to <span class="italic">Archaeologia Cambrensis</span>, the journal of the Cambrian Archaeological Association, appeared in April 1873; he joined the association in 1875, was elected a member of the general committee in 1877, became joint editor of the journal in 1889, and was sole editor from 1892 until his death. The extent of his influence on the standards of the <span class="italic">Archaeologia Cambrensis</span> is documented and acknowledged in its pages over twenty years. His article on &#145;Early Christian art in Wales&#146;, which appeared in the January 1899 issue, was the first systematic account of the subject.<br>
<br>Allen's time at Leith gave him the opportunity to visit Scottish archaeological sites; in 1883 he was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland (honorary fellow, 1900), and in 1885 was the society's Rhind lecturer in archaeology. His Rhind lectures, on <span class="italic">Early Christian Symbolism in Great Britain and Ireland</span>, were published in 1887. In England he became FSA in 1896, editor of the <span class="italic">Reliquary and Illustrated Archaeologist</span> in 1893, and Yates lecturer in archaeology in University College, London, for 1898. Allen was comfortably off, but not rich, and it was largely through the support of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland and its jubilee research fellowship, endowed by Dr R. H. Gunning, that he was able to fund his work in Scotland. Allen's only salaried employment, after he left civil engineering, was as an editor. Allen's great work <span class="italic">The Early Christian Monuments of Scotland</span> (1903, with Joseph Anderson) gave him scope for a general analysis and classification of ornament which put the study of early medieval sculpture throughout the British Isles on a new footing. His unrivalled knowledge of the visual material, and the soundness of his approach, widely acknowledged by fellow workers in his lifetime, continue to command respect. Allen was a tireless fieldworker; in his last book, <span class="italic">Celtic Art in Pagan and Christian Times</span> (1904), he was able to claim that he had personally examined nearly all the early Christian monuments of Scotland, England, Wales, and Ireland. Allen pioneered scientific methods of description, but because he was himself an accomplished artist he never lost sight of the aesthetic quality of patterns, and his descriptive writing was fluent and evocative. A passionate advocate of the preservation of monuments, he urged the creation of collections of casts, photographs, and drawings before the monuments themselves had weathered away. Such collections, he pointed out, would not only record the appearance of rapidly disintegrating works of art, but could also be used for study and education at all levels. These views, trenchantly expressed, cropped up regularly in his many contributions to archaeological journals.<br>
<br>Allen's scholarly expertise extended beyond sculpture. He was what would now be called an art historian, as well as an archaeologist. His detailed knowledge of metalwork and manuscript illumination enabled him to show how comparative study of art in various media could help establish chronology. His iconographical research resulted in his listing examples, anticipating the creation of art indices. Allen's more general interests, particularly in the technical appliances of all cultures, found an outlet in his work for the <span class="italic">Reliquary and Illustrated Archaeologist</span>.<br>
<br>As a freelance scholar, Allen was able to express his views without inhibition. He had hard words to say in print of the curators of the London museums, who he thought neglected early Christian archaeology in Britain and were remote from the general public. But his hot indignation was matched by a keen sense of humour and a kind heart. Well-read and a noted conversationalist, he was regarded with great affection by all who worked with him or benefited from his advice. For most of his life Allen lived in London. He died there, unmarried, at his home, 28 Great Ormond Street, on 5 July 1907.<br>
