<span class="headword">Mittelholzer,  Edgar Austin</span>  (1909&#150;1965), <span class="occ">novelist and short-story writer</span>, was born on 16 December 1909 in New Amsterdam, British Guiana, the second child of William Austin Mittelholzer (1865&#150;<i>c</i>.1960), commercial clerk, and his wife, Rosamond Mabel Leblanc (1889&#150;<i>c</i>.1960), a spinner. Of Swiss-German, French, British, and African blood, he was a &#145;swarthy&#146; child, to the horror of his light-skinned, negrophobe father. Some relief from his repressive puritanical upbringing came when a church grant enabled him to enter Berbice high school in 1922. At eleven he began writing, inspired by a Buffalo Bill story, and at nineteen decided to become an author, and never swerved from this vocation. After leaving school in 1927 he took a succession of casual jobs so that he could ply editors in England and America with manuscripts, though with little success. In 1937 he privately published a series of local sketches, <span class="italic">Creole Chips</span>, and sold them from door to door. In 1941 he moved to Trinidad, where he served briefly (and unhappily) in the Trinidad Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, and married Roma Halfhide, a Trinidadian, in March 1942.<br>
<br>In 1941 the London firm Eyre and Spottiswood had published Mittelholzer's novel <span class="italic">Corentyne Thunder</span>, an atmospheric evocation of West Indian peasant life based on childhood memories of visits to coastal Guiana. Although most copies were destroyed in an air raid, this encouraged him to move to England in 1948 with his wife and daughter Anna. Living in Bagshot, Surrey, he worked as copy-typist for the books department of the British Council, and contributed to, and briefly produced, the seminal BBC literary programme <span class="italic">Caribbean Voices</span>, generously encouraging younger writers. In 1950 the Hogarth Press published <span class="italic">A Morning at the Office</span>, Doubleday taking the American rights. A detailed evocation of Trinidad society within the five hours' traffic of an importing company, it established Mittelholzer's literary reputation. In 1951 Peter Nevill published <span class="italic">Shadows Move among them</span>, an eldritch fantasy of life in a jungle commune, and with a second Guianese novel, <span class="italic">The Children of Kaywana</span> (1952), Mittelholzer entered a long-standing engagement with Secker and Warburg.<br>
<br>Mittelholzer now felt able to live entirely by his pen. He visited Montreal on a Guggenheim fellowship in 1952&#150;3, and Barbados in 1953&#150;6. Over fifteen years he published twenty-two novels, besides <span class="italic">A Swarthy Boy</span> (autobiography) and <span class="italic">With a Carib Eye</span> (travel book). His novels were variously set in Guiana, Barbados, and England, and constantly experimented with new styles and forms. They reflect his passionate interest in the interaction of character, place, and weather; and in music, particularly Wagner. Rejecting Christianity, he adopted yoga and occultism, and was fascinated with psychic phenomena. This melded in his novels with a preoccupation with violence, mental abormality, and sexual perversion. Mittelholzer himself paradoxically combined a belief in absolute discipline with gentle kindness to individuals. He wrote out of passionate conviction and with meticulous concern for literary craft. However, his bizarre subjects and extreme right-wing politics, influenced by Clive Bell's <span class="italic">Civilization</span> (1947), generated increasing friction with his publishers, and brought rejection by literary critics. He separated from Roma in 1956, and moved alone to Maida Vale, London.<br>
<br>In 1959 Mittelholzer was granted a divorce, losing custody of his children Anna, Stephan, Griselda, and Hermann. In April 1960 he married the writer Jacqueline Pointer, and moved to Dippenhall, Farnham, Surrey. In 1961 he broke with Secker and Warburg over the subject of <span class="italic">The Piling of Clouds</span>&#151;child rape and murder set in English suburbia&#151;and his bleak last novels reflect deepening financial difficulties and increasing isolation. He had twice earlier attempted suicide, and on 5 May 1965, he poured a gallon of petrol over himself and ignited it. He died at Farnham Hospital, Farnham, Surrey, on 6 May, leaving a two-year-old son, Leodgar Edward.<br>
<br>Mittelholzer was the first British West Indian writer to live entirely by novel-writing. His most popular work&#151;the historical trilogy <span class="italic">The Children of Kaywana</span> (1952), <span class="italic">The Harrowing of Hubertus</span> (1954), and <span class="italic">Kaywana Blood</span> (1958)&#151;reflected a personal interest in Guianese history originating with his Swiss ancestor, Constanz Mittelholzer, a Berbice plantation manager in 1760. It was carefully researched, and broke the taboo against writing of the Caribbean slave past. A prolific writer of great integrity, who breached the fortress of London publishing for Third World writers, he may be considered the &#145;father&#146; of modern Caribbean writing in English.<br>
