<span class="headword">Paxton,  George</span>  (1762&#150;1837), <span class="occ">Original Secession minister</span>, born on 2 April 1762 at Dalgourie, a village in the parish of Bolton, Haddingtonshire, was the eldest son of William Paxton, a joiner or house carpenter, and his wife, Jean Milne. Soon after George's birth his parents moved to Melrose, and then to Makerstoun, near Kelso and the Tweed. The picturesqueness of the place Paxton portrays in his poem &#145;The Villager&#146;. The neighbouring laird, Sir Hay McDougal, colonel of the Scots Greys, became interested in the family, and young Paxton was educated under his eye at the parish school of Makerstoun. He subsequently went to Kelso, learning Latin and Greek, and, after a short experience as a carpenter, entered Edinburgh University, but left without a degree; in 1784 he went to Alloa to study divinity under William Moncrieff, and &#145;became a firm seceder&#146;. On 17 March 1788 he was licensed to preach by the Associate Presbytery of Edinburgh, and his eloquence was at once recognized. He received calls from three churches almost simultaneously&#151;Greenlaw, Craigend, and the united congregations of Kilmaurs and Stewarton. By decision of the synod he was ordained to the last-named congregations on 12 August 1789, and took up residence at Stewarton. After a few years the two congregations, at the advice of Paxton, separated, and Kilmaurs was assigned to him.<br>
<br>Owing to a hepatic malady, Paxton was soon forced to resign pastoral duty for seven years, and on his recovery the General Associate Synod elected him professor of divinity in 1807. He moved to Edinburgh, but his opposition to the union between the Anti-Burgher and the Burgher synods led him to resign his professorship and to his withdrawal from the General Associate Synod in 1820. He then became pastor to a body of sympathizers, who seceded with him, in a vacant chapel adjacent to the Grassmarket under Castle Hill. A new church was built in Infirmary Street, which his preaching soon filled, and he and his congregation joined with the Constitutional Presbytery of Seceders to which Dr Thomas McCrie belonged, and thus formed a new connexion styled the Associate Synod of Original Seceders, also known as the Constitutional Associate Presbytery and the Old Light Anti-Burghers. Paxton became their professor of divinity as well as continuing to minister. Despite his membership of this small sect, he was a strong apologist for established churches. Paxton took part in the controversy over the <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span>, publishing <span class="italic">The Sin and Danger of Circulating the Apocrypha in Connection with the Holy Scriptures</span> (1828). He also published works on religious covenants (1801) and on church unity (1802), a volume of poetry entitled <span class="italic">The Villagers</span> (1813), and <span class="italic">Illustrations of the Holy Scriptures in Three Parts</span> (2 vols., 1819; 3rd edn, 4 vols., 1841&#150;3). He was made honorary DD of St Andrews University shortly before his death on 9 April 1837. He was buried in the West Kirk burial-ground, Edinburgh. In 1790 Paxton had married Elizabeth Armstrong (<i>d</i>. 1800), a daughter of a manufacturer in Kelso. With her he had two sons and three daughters. Paxton's only surviving son, George, was a doctor in India. Paxton's second wife, Margaret Johnstone, daughter of a farmer in Berwick, survived him.<br>
