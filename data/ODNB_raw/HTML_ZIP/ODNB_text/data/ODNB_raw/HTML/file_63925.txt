<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stonor <span class="st"> [Stonore]</span> family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1315&#150;<em>c.</em>1500), <span class="occ">gentry</span>, was founded by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26583/', "Sir John Stonor (c.1281&#150;1354)")</script>, chief justice of the common pleas, who raised the Stonors from their status of very minor Oxfordshire landowners. As a result of his successful career, which began about 1315, he was able to buy estates in several counties, notably Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire, and Devon, and to begin rebuilding the family residence at Stonor, near Henley, Oxfordshire. Although a few additions to the estate were made later by marriage and purchase, the family property remained essentially as he left it. It was worth nearly &pound;250 under Thomas (I). John had five or six sons, of whom one, Robert, was a canon of Wells, and the eldest was another John, <a name="cosubject_63922"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Stonor</span>  (<em>c.</em>1310&#150;1361)<span class="occ"></span>, who succeeded him in 1354. Although knighted by 1351, John the younger had a curiously anonymous career; the lack of activity at home may have been due to prolonged service abroad, but there is no record of this. His wife is said to have been a daughter of John Wenard of Oxfordshire and he died in 1361. He was succeeded by his son <a name="cosubject_63923"></a><span class="headword">Edmund Stonor</span>  (<em>c.</em>1347&#150;1382)<span class="occ"></span>, who became ward of the countess of Bedford, Edward III's daughter, and received livery in 1365. He was the first of the family to take his full place as a &#145;country gentleman&#146;; he took part in local transactions and served as sheriff, MP, and JP in Oxfordshire and Berkshire. He was a commissioner for the poll taxes of 1379 and 1380 in Oxfordshire, which may explain the burning of his muniments and the murder of his servant in Hertfordshire during the peasants' revolt of 1381. He seems to have married a sister of Warin de Lisle of Berkshire, and they had three sons, of whom one predeceased his father, and one daughter.<br>
<br>Edmund's death in 1382 began a lengthy period of almost continuous minorities in the Stonor family. John, the heir, was then about thirteen and died in 1383. His brother and heir <a name="cosubject_63924"></a><span class="headword">Sir Ralph Stonor</span>  (<em>c.</em>1368&#150;1394)<span class="occ"></span> was also a minor and both in turn were wards of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1809/', "Sir Robert Bealknap")</script>, chief justice of the common pleas, and Ralph was given in marriage to Bealknap's daughter Joan. He came of age in 1390, being fortunately too young to share in Bealknap's disgrace at the hands of the appellants in 1388. His only notable action as an adult was to serve on Richard II's Irish expedition of 1394, by which time he was knighted, and he died, probably in Ireland, in that year. Ralph left an infant heir, Gilbert, born in 1393, who died in 1396. By late 1395 Ralph's widow had married Edmund Hampden of Hampden, Buckinghamshire, creating a lasting tie between the two families.<br>
<br>Ralph's second son, who succeeded his brother, was <a name="cosubject_63925"></a><span class="headword">Thomas (I) Stonor</span>  (<em>c.</em>1394&#150;1431)<span class="occ"></span>. He is the first of the family whose activities are revealed through their letters and papers. From 1403 he was in the custody of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5192/', "Thomas Chaucer")</script> of Ewelme, Oxfordshire, son of the poet and a leading Thames valley landowner. Thus began a lengthy family association with the holders of the Chaucer lands and through Chaucer came a connection with Cardinal Beaufort, another power in the region. By 1416 Thomas Stonor was married to Alice, daughter and heir of Thomas Kirby of Horton, Kent, a match that considerably increased the Stonors' rather small estate in that county. Thomas came of age <i>c</i>.1415; he may well have served with Henry V in France in 1419 and 1420, and he played a substantial part in local government, notably as MP and sheriff. He made further improvements to the family home; by the later fifteenth century it was clearly a commodious residence, whose parlours and chambers reflected the new fashion for privacy. It was under Thomas, in the early 1420s, that the protracted dispute with the Fortescues began over the Stonor property of Ermington, Devon, one of those purchased by Justice Stonor.<br>
<br>Thomas died in 1431, leaving two sons, the oldest of whom was <a name="cosubject_63926"></a><span class="headword">Thomas (II) Stonor</span>  (1424&#150;1474)<span class="occ"></span>, and five daughters, and yet another period of minority ensued. Thomas (I)'s widow married Richard Drayton of Oxfordshire and the couple lived at Stonor and then on Alice's dower lands in Kent. Although Alice had a sizeable jointure, there is no sign of tension between Thomas (II) and his mother and stepfather. Thomas wrote movingly of their deaths in 1468 and employed as an intimate man of business Thomas Mull, apparently husband of a daughter of Alice and Drayton. Thomas (II), like his father, was a ward of Chaucer, until the latter's death in 1434. He may then have been in the tutelage of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22461/', "William de la Pole, earl, later duke, of Suffolk")</script>, who had married Chaucer's heiress, since Thomas's wife, Joan, is said, quite possibly correctly, to have been an illegitimate daughter of Suffolk and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58930/', "Jacqueline of Hainault")</script>. Suffolk became the political heir to Chaucer and Beaufort in the region, and the Stonors and other local gentry were drawn into his circle. Thomas (II) Stonor served as local officer in Oxfordshire and Berkshire, although not with any regularity until the 1460s. During the Wars of the Roses, he managed to keep in with both sides, despite serving on Lancastrian commissions of array in 1459 and 1460 and&#151;doubtless encouraged by his tie of service with Warwick's brother, George Neville, archbishop of York&#151;co-operating with the readeption government in 1470&#150;71. The family tie with the house of Suffolk remained under both Thomas and his successor, even though Duke William's son, John, had nothing like his father's influence in the region. Under Thomas (II) the Ermington affair resurfaced in the early 1460s, but in 1468 he was able to record a triumphant victory. He seems to have been a fairly formidable man, perhaps over-formidable with his son and heir, but showed himself to be not just an affectionate son but a loving husband. He had three sons and three daughters and he was able to establish both his younger sons, Edmund and Thomas, independently.<br>
<br>Thomas (II) died in 1474, to be succeeded by his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_63927"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Stonor</span>  (<em>c.</em>1449&#150;1494)<span class="occ"></span>, and was buried lavishly at Pyrton, the parish church for Stonor. His widow survived, probably until 1494. An argument with her son, recorded in 1482, had presumably been resolved by 1493, when she named William executor. William is the Stonor about whom most is known. Although some comments from relatives&#151;that, as a boy he was &#145;a musyr and a studyer&#146;  (Carpenter, 1.128), and that, as an adult, he was too lavish in his expenditure&#151;suggest a wastrel, he was in fact the most notable head of the family since Justice Stonor. This may have had a lot to do with the fact that he was the first since Justice Stonor's son Sir John to inherit as an adult. From 1478 he was part of Edward IV's rapidly expanding affinity, which seems to have been developing into the dominant political connection in the Thames valley in this period. He was made KB at the marriage of the young duke of York in early 1478 and became a knight of the body in 1478 or 1479. Although he himself did not go on the king's French campaign in 1475, his brothers did. That he held important local office in Oxfordshire from 1478 was almost certainly due to the household connection. The rising social level of his three wives reflects his personal rise. Despite the occasional foray into the marriage market, he was unmarried in 1474 but by 1475 had chosen for his wife Elizabeth, widow of Thomas Rich, the son of a wealthy London mercer, and daughter of John Croke, a London alderman. Her chief attraction was almost certainly her money, for William seems to have been rather short of ready cash at this time, but letters from Elizabeth to William from London, where she resided much of the time, show genuine affection. It was through this alliance that William met Thomas Betson, the Calais wool merchant, with whom he went into partnership in the wool trade from 1475 to 1479. Betson became betrothed to Katherine Rich, Elizabeth's young daughter from her first marriage, and his letters to Katherine and her family reveal a man of great charm. Elizabeth died in 1479, leaving no children from the marriage, and in 1480 Stonor married Agnes, widow of John Wydeslade, a gentleman of Devon, and granddaughter and heir of William Wynard, an Exeter merchant with substantial estates in Devon and Cornwall. Although Agnes died soon after, in 1481, it was probably this marriage that brought Stonor a tie with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11560/', "Thomas Grey, marquess of Dorset")</script>, and his wife, the Bonville heiress, that remained important in the safeguarding of his south-western estates. William was still childless and by late 1481 had married again, this time to Anne, daughter and, from 1483, heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19946/', "John Neville, Marquess Montagu")</script>. It was, however, Stonor's move into the highest political circles that was to prove his and his family's temporary undoing. In October 1483, he was one of the many household men, several from the Thames valley, in Buckingham's rebellion against Richard III. He was attainted and his lands confiscated and granted away, some of them to Lord Lovell, Richard's chief representative in the region. Stonor may have gone into exile in Brittany with Dorset. He was in any case restored to his estates, to his household position, and to local office on Henry VII's accession in 1485. In 1487 he fought for Henry at Stoke, where he was made a banneret, and his appointment as steward to Oxford University in 1492 indicates how close he was thought to be to the king. His third wife died in 1486 and he died in 1494, leaving a twelve-year-old son, John, and a daughter, Anne. Both were betrothed to members of the Fortescue family, perhaps in an attempt to end the Ermington affair for good. The question of the wardship of John&#151;<span class="italic">Stonor's case</span>&#151;became a leading precedent in the crown's efforts to extend its prerogative wardship, but the really intensive litigation in the family followed on John's death in 1499, when Thomas (III), William's younger brother, claimed as the heir male against the heir general, William's daughter, and her husband. <i>Stonor v. Fortescue</i> continued until the male line's victory in 1537. Their descendants still reside at Stonor Park. The Stonor family arms were azure, two bars dancett&eacute;e or, a chief argent.<br>
<br>The Stonors would be a typical, if unremarkable, prominent fifteenth-century gentry family, typical as much in their rise as in their subsequent history, were it not for the survival of a large number of papers and, above all, letters from this period. These came into crown hands, either in 1483 or with the <i>Stonor v. Fortescue</i> suit in chancery, and remained there, and are the largest collection of gentry letters from the period after the Pastons'. Although less renowned than the latter, they are much more representative of the gentry world: unlike the Pastons, the Stonors were no longer social climbers and the Thames valley in the fifteenth century was a more stable region than East Anglia. If the letters contain fewer telling personal details than the Paston letters, they nevertheless offer an unrivalled insight into the routine life of a gentry family: estate management, consumption, debt and credit, marriage negotiations, dealing with churchmen, from bishops, archbishops, and abbots to parish priests, performing the king's business, and much else besides. They demonstrate how the family used for its affairs a network of kinsmen, personal agents, neighbours, and friends centred on the Thames valley, and how marriage and kinship with families from the region, such as Cotesmore, Barantyn, Brecknock, Hampden, Harecourt, Ramsey, and Rokes, helped both create and strengthen this network. It was a world where negotiation was the normal response to conflict and, while relations with the nobility may have been important, the nobles did not dominate gentry affairs in the Thames valley as they did in some other parts of England. The letters afford a privileged insight into the mundane but important affairs that must have been the stuff of daily life to almost all gentry families in this period, however enmeshed in local and national politics.<br>
