<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fane, Sir  Henry</span>  (1778&#150;1840), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the eldest son of the Hon. Henry Fane (1739&#150;1802) of Fulbeck, near Grantham, Lincolnshire, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Edward Buckley Batson, London banker, of Avon Tyrrell, Hampshire. Henry Fane senior, who was MP for Lyme Regis from 1772 to 1802, and &#145;keeper of the king's private roads, gates, and bridges, and conductor or guide of the king's person in all royal progresses&#146; from 1772 until his death, was the second son of Thomas, eighth earl of Westmorland. Fane was born on 26 November 1778, educated at Eton College (1791), and entered the army as a cornet in the 6th dragoon guards (Carabiniers) on 31 May 1792. He was promoted lieutenant into the 55th regiment on 29 September 1792, and captain on 3 April 1793, and he exchanged with that rank into the 4th dragoon guards on 31 August 1793. In 1793 and 1794 he served as aide-de-camp to his uncle the tenth earl of Westmorland when the earl was viceroy of Ireland. In his early life Fane's career was promoted by Westmorland.<br>
<br>When Westmorland retired Fane returned to his regiment. He was promoted major on 24 August 1795, and lieutenant-colonel on 1 January 1797. In 1802 he duly succeeded his father as MP for Lyme Regis, then a close (freeman) borough controlled by the Westmorland family. He gave general support to all administrations except Grenville's. He received the lieutenant-colonelcy of the 1st (King's) dragoon guards on 25 December 1804, and on 1 January 1805 was appointed aide-de-camp to the king with the rank of colonel. Though Fane had up to this time seen no active service, he was nevertheless directed to join the staff of Major-General Sir Arthur Wellesley at Cork in June 1808, with the rank of brigadier-general. When the expedition landed at the mouth of the Mondego, Fane, as the youngest and most active of the British generals, received the command of the light brigade, consisting of the 50th regiment and the light companies of all the other regiments attached to the expedition. He led the advance, and at the battle of Roli&ccedil;a he first maintained the connection of the centre with General Ferguson, and then successfully turned General Laborde's right with his light troops by advancing along a mountain road in conjunction with Ferguson's brigade. This operation determined the French to retreat. At the battle of Vimeiro his brigade, with that of Brigadier-General Robert Anstruther, held the village church and churchyard against the first three furious onslaughts of Junot's troops. After the convention of Cintra, Fane was transferred by Sir John Moore to command the 2nd infantry brigade in Mackenzie Fraser's division, consisting of the 38th, 82nd, and 79th regiments, and with this brigade he served in Moore's advance into Spain, in his famous retreat, and in the battle of Corunna.<br>
<br>On Fane's return to England he received the thanks of parliament in his place in the House of Commons, where he still sat for Lyme Regis, and he eagerly pressed to be again actively employed. In the spring of 1809 he was again ordered to the Peninsula, with the rank of brigadier-general. He was placed, as an old cavalry officer, in command of one of Wellesley's three cavalry brigades, consisting of the 3rd dragoon guards and the 4th dragoons. This brigade, as it consisted of heavy cavalry, took no such distinguished part in the battle of Talavera as General George Anson's light brigade, but it did good service throughout the campaigns of 1809 and 1810. On 25 July 1810 Fane was promoted major-general, and as the second cavalry general in order of seniority he was in 1811 detached from the main army to command the cavalry with Sir Rowland Hill's corps in the Alemtejo, which consisted of the 13th light dragoons and four regiments of Portuguese dragoons. With this command he covered Hill's operations, and accompanied his corps to the main army, which it reached in time to be present at the battle of Busaco, where, however, none of the cavalry were engaged. In the subsequent retreat to the lines of Torres Vedras the cavalry under Sir Stapleton Cotton and Fane were most valuable, but the strain of this difficult campaign was too much for Fane's health, and he was invalided home.<br>
<br>Fane thus missed the important battles of 1812, but in 1813, to the satisfaction of both Wellington and Hill, Fane rejoined the army in the Peninsula. He was again appointed to command all the cavalry attached to Hill's corps, namely, a brigade of British cavalry, consisting of the 3rd dragoon guards, 1st dragoons (the Royals), and the 13th light dragoons, one regiment of Portuguese dragoons, and Bean's troop of Royal Horse Artillery. With this command he headed the advance of the right of the British army from their winter quarters at Frenada, defeated the French general Villatte in a cavalry engagement on 26 May&#151;which secured the safe passage of the fords of the Tormes&#151;and was present at the battle of Vitoria. During the winter campaign of 1813&#150;14 the cavalry was hardly employed at all, but when Wellington decided to invade France, Fane once more took his place in front of Hill's corps on the right of the army. He was engaged in innumerable small skirmishes during the advance, and distinguished himself in the charges of the British cavalry which completed the rout of Soult's army at Orthez. He then once more took his place in front of Hill's column, and was present, though not actively employed, at the final battle of Toulouse.<br>
<br>On the conclusion of peace Fane succeeded Cotton as commander of all the British cavalry on the continent, and conducted them safely right across France to Calais. During these long and varied campaigns Fane had won the reputation of being, next to Cotton, the best commander of cavalry in the army. On 13 July 1814 he was made colonel of the 23rd light dragoons, from which he was transferred on 3 August to the colonelcy of his old regiment, the 4th (Royal Irish) dragoon guards. He received a gold cross with one clasp for the battles of Vimeiro, Corunna, Talavera, Vitoria, and Orthez, in which he had been actively engaged, on 26 July 1814 he received the thanks of parliament in his place in the House of Commons (his reply was the only time he spoke in the house), he was made one of the first KCBs (June 1815) on the extension of the Order of the Bath, and he was appointed inspector-general of cavalry for Great Britain.<br>
<br>In 1815 Fane prepared the cavalry regiments which were employed at the battle of Waterloo, though he was not himself present in that campaign. In 1816 he was appointed to a special command in the midlands to put down riots. In 1817 he was made a local lieutenant-general for the continent, and appointed to command all the cavalry and horse artillery in the army of occupation in France, a post he held until the complete evacuation of that country in 1818. In the same year he resigned his seat in the House of Commons to make way for his brother Vere at Lyme, and retired to Fulbeck, near Grantham, Lincolnshire, a country seat which he had inherited on his father's death in 1802. Fane lived for many years with Mrs Isabella Cooke (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Gorges) from Dublin, whose husband was apparently still alive but who called herself Fane. She and Fane may have been &#145;privately married&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>), presumably illegally; they had two sons and a daughter, <a href="#cosubject_47676">Isabella [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>Fane lived in retirement for some years, but in due course was promoted lieutenant-general (12 August 1819), made a GCB (January 1826), and appointed colonel of the 1st (King's) dragoon guards (24 February 1827). In 1829 Wellington induced Fane to accept the office of surveyor-general of the ordnance. He re-entered the House of Commons as MP for the Admiralty-influenced freeman borough of Sandwich, and from 1830 to 1831 was MP for the Treasury (freeman) borough of Hastings. He left office when Grey's reform cabinet was formed, but continued on intimate terms with Wellington, who during his short tenure of office in 1835 appointed Fane commander-in-chief in India. Lord Melbourne's cabinet confirmed the appointment, and Fane took over the command-in-chief from Lord William Bentinck&#151;the last governor-general who was also commander-in-chief&#151;in September 1835, when he found India in a state of profound peace. Fane personally inspected every station in his command in 1836, and an interesting account of this tour of inspection, and of his interview with Ranjit Singh, the ruler of the Punjab, was published by his nephew and aide-de-camp Henry Edward Fane. Towards the end of Fane's period of command there were signs of war on the north-west frontier, and in 1838 he got ready an army to proceed to the relief of Herat, then besieged by the Persians, and Lord Auckland and his advisers then began to mature the plans which brought about the First Anglo-Afghan War.<br>
<br>The &#145;army of the Indus&#146;, as organized by Fane, comprised two divisions from the Bengal army and a contingent from the Bombay army. However, the Persians withdrew from Herat and the army was reduced by one division. Fane then gave up the command and applied to retire as commander-in-chief; he was in very poor health. He handed over the army of the Indus to Major-General Sir John Keane, commander-in-chief of the Bombay army, in January 1839. He was later replaced as commander-in-chief East Indies by Major-General Sir Jasper Nicolls, commander-in-chief of the Madras army. Fane left India in the last stage of weakness, and died at sea on board the <i>Malabar</i> off St Michael in the Azores, aged sixty-one, on 24 March 1840. He requested burial at his country seat, Fulbeck, in Lincolnshire.<br>
<br>Fane's only daughter, <a name="cosubject_47676"></a><span class="headword">Isabella Fane</span>  (1804&#150;1886)<span class="occ"></span>, went with him to India in 1835 as his hostess, and stayed there until 1838. After her father's death in 1840 the family home at Fulbeck was taken over by her brother Henry and his wife, Christine, with whom she found it difficult to live harmoniously. Isabella lived in reduced circumstances largely on the continent, partly at Boulogne and Aix-la-Chapelle. She died, unmarried, at Pau, France, in 1886. While in India she wrote letters to her aunt Caroline Chaplin, and kept a journal. Extracts from these, edited by John Pemble, were published as <span class="italic">Miss Fane in India</span> (1985). Her letters vividly criticized the British she met: she described Julia Margaret Pattle (later Julia Margaret Cameron, the photographer) as &#145;a little, ugly, underbred-looking thing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Miss Fane in India</span>, 61), and wrote of the Misses Eden, &#145;both ugly, and both s&#151;k like polecats!&#146;  (ibid., 63). Her letters, according to their editor, show her &#145;derisive, indignant, ironic, and more than a little vulnerable behind her uncouth sense of fun&#146;  (ibid., 6).<br>
