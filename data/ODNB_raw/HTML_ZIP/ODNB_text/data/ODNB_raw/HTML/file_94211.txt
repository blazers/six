<span class="headword">Moraes,  Dominic Francis <span class="st"> [Dom]</span></span>  (1938&#150;2004), <span class="occ">poet and writer</span>, was born on 19 July 1938 in Bombay, India, the only child of Francis Robert (Frank) Moraes (1907&#150;1974), an Oxford-educated lawyer, who edited the <span class="italic">Times of India</span>, the <span class="italic">Indian Express</span>, and the <span class="italic">Times of Ceylon</span>, and his wife, Beryl, <i>n&eacute;e</i> D'Monte (<i>d</i>. 1989), a doctor. Both his parents were from English-speaking Roman Catholic backgrounds. When he was seven years old his mother became mentally ill and was institutionalized. He subsequently lived with his father in Ceylon, the south Pacific, and south-east Asia before returning to Bombay and continuing his education at Campion School and St Mary's High School.<br>
<br>In 1954 Moraes met Stephen Spender, then on a visit to Bombay, and showed him his poems. Spender published some in <span class="italic">Encounter</span> and helped him secure admission to Jesus College, Oxford. He left India in 1955, and in the year before he went to Oxford travelled widely in mainland Europe. At Jesus he read English from 1956 to 1959 and came to know other leading English and American poets and critics of the period, including W. H. Auden, Cyril Connolly, William Empson, Allen Ginsberg, and Allen Tate. His more immediate circle of friends included the poets John Heath-Stubbs, Julian Mitchell, and Peter Levi, and his first collection of poems, <span class="italic">A Beginning</span>, was published by the select Parton Press in 1957. When this volume was awarded the Hawthornden prize (1958) Moraes became its youngest and first non-British winner and his reputation seemed assured. In the year of the award he edited an issue of the Oxford literary review <span class="italic">Gemini</span>, in which he included poems by Stevie Smith, Ted Hughes, and Sylvia Plath. His autobiographical travel book <span class="italic">Gone Away</span> (1960) and <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1960) followed in quick succession; and a selection of his verse was published, along with the work of Kingsley Amis and Peter Porter, in the second volume of the influential <span class="roman">Penguin Modern Poets</span> series, further confirming his place in the emerging canon of contemporary English poetry. His third collection, <span class="italic">John Nobody</span>, regarded by many as his finest, appeared in 1965.<br>
<br>The acclaim Moraes received, particularly for the technical assurance of his poetry, was complemented by his adoption into the celebrity culture of the day: he became a television personality and a prominent figure in the Soho scene of the &#145;swinging sixties&#146;, which provided the setting for some of the poems in <span class="italic">John Nobody</span>. Despite this he wrestled with personal problems, drank heavily at times, and was twice married and divorced in this period. On 5 December 1960 he married the socialite Henrietta Bowler, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Abbott (1931&#150;1999), remembered as the model for Francis Bacon's <span class="italic">Lying Figure with a Hypodermic Syringe</span>; and in 1963 to Judith St John, with whom he had a son, Francis. In 1970 he made a third marriage: to his childhood sweetheart, Leela Naidu, a celebrated film actress and former Miss India, but this marriage was also subsequently dissolved. Moraes's personal angst during this period can in part be traced to his early years. In his autobiographical volume <span class="italic">Never at Home</span> (1992) he described how the spectre of his mother made him afraid of returning to India. He did so in 1974, when the United Nations agency for which he was then working lent him to the Indian government. His father died in that year and two years later Moraes followed in his footsteps in committing his mother to an asylum, amid feelings of guilt and self-hatred. In the years preceding his return to India, Moraes had been living in New York and Hong Kong, while travelling widely in south-east Asia and Australia and viewing himself as an &#145;international nomad&#146;  (<span class="italic">My Son's Father</span>, ix).<br>
<br>A widely held view of Moraes is that he failed to fulfil the promise of his early bohemian years in England. However, although his poetic output almost completely dried up during his middle period, he remained a prolific writer, columnist, editor, and film-maker. He worked as a war correspondent in Algeria, Israel, and Vietnam and made some two dozen documentaries for the BBC and ITV. He also published more than twenty prose works, including a biography of Indira Gandhi, a book about the cricketer Sunil Gavaskar, and two further volumes of memoirs, <span class="italic">My Son's Father</span> (1968) and <span class="italic">Never at Home</span> (1992), which were republished along with <span class="italic">Gone Away</span> as <span class="italic">A Variety of Absences</span> (2003). He returned to poetry with <span class="italic">Absences</span> (1983), <span class="italic">Serendip</span> (1990), and <span class="italic">Cinnamon Shade: New and Selected Poems</span> (2001), works that represent his most mature achievement. In these volumes the often impressionistic romanticism of his early poetry gave way to a complex engagement with archetypal myths and the poetics of place.<br>
<br>Along with Nissim Ezekiel and A. K. Ramanujan, Moraes was one of the triumvirate of poets who pioneered modern Indian verse in English, but for many years his reputation on the subcontinent was far from assured, because of his supposed Anglicization and the alleged obscurity of his sometimes very personal verse. Towards the end of his life his work received more acknowledgement at home, when, in the words of Ranjit Hoskote, his &#145;repugnance&#146; towards some aspects of Indian culture was tempered by &#145;a certain compassionate equanimity towards its people&#146; and &#145;the literary culture that had long rejected him &hellip; recognised him with awards, and more importantly, with a revival of serious interest in his writing&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Hindu</span>, 3 June 2004).<br>
<br>Moraes's partner during the last years of his life was the architect and author Sarayu Srivatsa, with whom he co-wrote one of his most interesting prose works, <span class="italic">The Long Strider</span>, the story of the early seventeenth-century explorer Thomas Coryate, who walked to India from Somerset. Moraes died of a heart attack, in the city of his birth, now Mumbai, on 2 June 2004. He had been suffering from cancer, for which he refused to take treatment, for several years.<br>
