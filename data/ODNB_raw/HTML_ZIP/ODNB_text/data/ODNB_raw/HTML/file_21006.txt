<span class="headword">Owen,  Hugh</span>  (1639/40&#150;1700), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was the son of Humphrey Owen and his wife, Susan. Humphrey Owen was the grandson of John Lewis Owen, MP for Merioneth in 1572. Hugh matriculated from Jesus College, Oxford, on 21 July 1660. According to Calamy he was &#145;a candidate for the ministry&#146; in August 1662, and &#145;about that time he removed from Oxford to London. But not long after he fixed in his native country&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.710). For some years, it seems, Owen acted as an itinerant preacher chiefly in Merioneth, travelling also into Caernarvonshire and Montgomeryshire. By 1669 or 1670 he had married Martha, whose background is unknown; they had three daughters and a son, John.<br>
<br>On 22 May 1672 Owen was licensed as a congregational teacher at his house in Llanegryn, Merioneth. In July that year he was issued with licences, no doubt for preaching, in Bodwenni, Cynfal, Erwgoyel, Llanegryn, and Peniarth, also in the county. Owen was ordained as a minister in the Independent church centred upon Wrexham about 1675, the year in which Henry Maurice, pastor of the Brecknockshire Independents, wrote an account of the state of the Welsh congregations which seems to indicate that the gathering of a properly constituted church within Merioneth was a recent event:<blockquote>The few professing people that were heretofore in this county were joined either to Wrexham Church, or to Vasavour Powell's, that met in Montgomeryshire &hellip; but since the change most of them turned Quakers, and so continue. Yet of their elders, one Mr Hugh Owen, of Bronclydwr &hellip; is settled in that county, and being ordained a teaching elder of Wrexham church, is sent to those parts to exercise his ministry; so that, of late &hellip; they are about gathering them into church order.</blockquote>Of this order, Maurice could give no details but he thought the people concerned were &#145;of an independent judgement&#146;  (Underhill, 515).<br>
<br>Owen's grandson, Hugh Farmer, claimed that during a period of imprisonment in Powis Castle in the reign of James II, Owen was treated well by Lord Powis (William Herbert, first earl and marquess of Powis), a Catholic who &#145;on hearing him pray, said to his priest, &#147;Surely this is a good Christian&#148;, and on his discharge, engaged him to come to Powis castle every Christmas&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nonconformist's Memorial</span>, 3.493). Owen succeeded Henry Williams about 1685 as minister of a mixed congregation of Independents and Baptists at Ysgafell, near Newtown, Montgomeryshire, and continued its open communion tradition. From 1690 until 1696 the Common Fund of Independents and Presbyterians granted him &pound;8 a year, reduced in 1695 to &pound;4; in April 1696 the Congregational fund board allocated &pound;10 to the congregational churches of north Wales, and in June they earmarked an &#145;additional&#146; &pound;3 for Hugh Owen, who was in the later part of his ministry assisted for some time by James Owen, later of Oswestry and Shrewsbury. Owen died on 15 March 1700 in his sixty-first year and was buried in the churchyard at Llanegryn. He was survived by his wife, and left property valued at &pound;187 11<i>s</i>. He bequeathed &#145;all my books, whether, Hebrew, Greek or Latine&#146; to his son, John, who succeeded to his father's ministry but who died shortly afterwards, on 27 June 1700 at the age of thirty  (will, NL Wales, B/1700/75).<br>
