<span class="headword">Pritchard,  George</span>  (1796&#150;1883), <span class="occ">missionary and diplomatist</span>, born in Birmingham on 1 August 1796, worked from childhood with his father, a journeyman brass-founder, and showed great mechanical skill. In his youth he and his family attended the Congregational chapel in Carr's Lane, and he became a local preacher in villages around Birmingham. He entered a boarding-school in Stafford in 1820, to prepare for further study at the mission seminary at Gosport, from 1820 to 1824. He was ordained as a Congregational minister in 1824, and on 25 July of the same year he married Elizabeth Ayllen (1799&#150;1871), of West Meon, Hampshire. Two days later, on 27 July, they left on a cargo ship bound for Tahiti, in the Society Islands of the Pacific Ocean, where Pritchard was to undertake missionary work for the London Missionary Society.<br>
<br>Pritchard and his wife were welcomed on their arrival by Queen Pomare. On 21 November 1836 the queen refused to admit two French priests, Honor&eacute; Laval and Fran&ccedil;ois d'Assis Caret, from the Catholic mission already established on the Gambier Islands, into her territories, and there followed a long quarrel with the French government, which ended in the islands being placed under French protection in 1842, and temporarily annexed by France in 1843. Pritchard, appointed in 1837 as British consul at Tahiti, with nominal jurisdiction in the other Society Islands and also Tonga and Samoa, advised the queen throughout this critical period, and he helped to pay an indemnity of 2000 Spanish dollars summarily demanded by the French admiral, Abel du Petit-Thouars, in 1838. In 1841 Pritchard went to England to lay the case of the dispossessed queen before the British government, and to describe the outrages that the French had allegedly inflicted on British subjects; but he returned in February 1843 without obtaining any genuine guarantee of security. On 5 March 1844 he was seized by the French authorities on the pretence that he encouraged disaffection among the islanders. Captain Gordon, of HMS <i>Cormorant</i>, negotiated his release, on condition that he should leave the islands and never return.<br>
<br>Pritchard sailed in the <i>Cormorant</i> to Valpara&iacute;so, and then on to London. The British government demanded that the French apologize and make financial reparations: Pritchard claimed that his property had suffered damage to the amount of &pound;4000. Eventually, in the queen's speech of 1845, an announcement was made that the difficulty had been satisfactorily adjusted.<br>
<br>Pritchard returned to the south Pacific in 1845, as Britain's first consul in Samoa. His term of office was marked by controversy about his commercial activities and by quarrels with Samoan chiefs. Even during his missionary days in Tahiti, Pritchard had been involved in private trading ventures, and now, from his consulate at the port of Apia, he began dealing openly in alcoholic liquor and in weapons. The area around Apia was embroiled in civil war for most of Pritchard's tenure, creating a demand for firearms and ammunition, and occasionally leading to the destruction of buildings or livestock. Pritchard forwarded a deluge of complaints to London from British traders and Samoans demanding redress for property damage, while pursuing his own escalating compensation claims. His dispatches also demanded better support from the Royal Navy: visiting captains tended to sympathize more with the Samoans than with Pritchard and the Europeans. A series of these captains, seconded by missionaries and Samoan chiefs, complained to the Foreign Office about Pritchard's unsuitability, and requested the appointment of a consul more sympathetic to Samoan culture, along with instructions to forbid consular trade. Accepting the inevitable, Pritchard resigned his post and returned to England in 1856.<br>
<br>Pritchard subsequently lived in retirement in England. His first wife died in 1871; his second wife, Charlotte Annie, and several of his children survived him. He died from bronchitis at his home, 1 St Andrews Terrace, Hove, Sussex, on 6 May 1883. His son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75486/', "William Thomas Pritchard")</script> had become Britain's first consul in Fiji in 1857. Pritchard published <span class="italic">Queen Pomare and her Country</span> (1878), and left in manuscript an account of French activities in the south Pacific, which was published in 1983.<br>
