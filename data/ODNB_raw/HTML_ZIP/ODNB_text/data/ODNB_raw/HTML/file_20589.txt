<span class="headword">Ogilvie,  William</span>  (1736&#150;1819), <span class="occ">classical scholar and advocate of common property in land</span>, was the only son of James Ogilvie, landowner and farmer, of Pittensear, in Moray, and his wife, Marjory Steuart, of Tannachy. His parents died when he was quite young, leaving him in charge of the estate and with the care of his four sisters. It is likely that he attended the nearby Elgin grammar school before entering King's College, Aberdeen, as third bursar of his year, in 1755. Having graduated MA in 1759 he was schoolmaster at Cullen, Banffshire, for a year. He attended Glasgow University for the winter session of 1760&#150;61 and Edinburgh University for the winter session of 1761&#150;2. Through the influence of his relative Lord Deskford (later earl of Seafield) he was appointed an assistant professor of philosophy in King's College, Aberdeen, on 25 November 1761, on the assurance that he would move into the first vacancy of a regent's place that occurred. He began teaching in November 1762, as an all-round professor of philosophy, and became a full regent in 1764; a year earlier he had been elected a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95092', "Aberdeen Philosophical Society")</script>. He was appointed professor of humanity in 1765, by an exchange of offices, and continued in that role until 1817, when failing health necessitated the appointment of an assistant.<br>
<br>Ogilvie enthralled his students with the outstanding quality of his translations of classical writers, especially Virgil and Horace, although these were never published. His scholarship extended to natural history and the fine arts and he was a keen antiquary, medallist, and numismatist. He collected specimens for a museum of natural history in King's College as well as a group of rare prints, mainly portraits. D. C. Macdonald was strongly convinced that Ogilvie visited the continent at some stage, possibly as travelling tutor and companion to Alexander Gordon, fourth duke of Gordon, but the latter's grand tour coincided with the commencement of Ogilvie's teaching duties and he is known to have taken another tutor.<br>
<br>In 1781 Ogilvie published anonymously <span class="italic">An Essay on the Right of Property in Land</span>. In it he asserted the birthright of every citizen to an equal share of property in land and outlined means by which this could be progressively achieved. He considered land values as having three parts, the original, the improved, and the improvable values; the first and third of these belonged to the community and only the second to the landholder. He argued from experience and wrote in the context of having inherited property, though he had sold the estate of Pittensear to the earl of Fife in 1772, while retaining the mansion house. In 1773 he purchased the property of Oldfold and Stonegavel, just outside Aberdeen, for &pound;1500. With the aid of a &pound;2000 loan from the duke of Gordon extensive improvements to the property were carried out before it was sold, in 1808, for &pound;4000.<br>
<br>Ogilvie's clarity of thought, freedom from preconceptions, and disinterested motives inevitably brought him into conflict with colleagues in King's College. In 1783 he was perturbed at the sale of college ground that might have been used as a botanic garden. He was conscious of the college's other dubious practices, including the misappropriation of bursary funds, and found himself in a minority in opposing private interest pursued to the detriment of the college. These established party lines not surprisingly held good in 1786, when he revived the issue of union between King's College and Marischal College. Given two universities within a mile of one another the eventual fusion of the colleges seemed only a matter of time. However, in spite of the positive attitude of Marischal College and Ogilvie's wholehearted sponsorship, self-interest prevailed at King's College and the union proposals were rejected. Ogilvie had at least won the argument with his lucid and ironic advocacy, and collected much support from outside the college as well as that of the rector, Sir William Forbes, before the latter was deposed.<br>
<br>In 1793 Ogilvie received the honorary degree of STD from Columbia College, New York. Pryse Lockhart Gordon, a former student, visited the already gout-crippled Ogilvie in 1800, bearing Greek and Roman coins and fragments from Pompeii. He recalled:<blockquote>It was delightful to see how the eyes of the old antiquary sparkled (or rather squinted), when I laid before him these treasures as a <i>ricordanza</i>, and the pleasure with which he examined them. I was much surprised to find in our conversation the minute acquaintance which he had of every work of art in Italy, the correctness of his taste and wonderful memory. (Gordon, 24)</blockquote>While Ogilvie's agrarian views were never likely to find powerful friends in their day, his <span class="italic">Essay</span> became a point of reference for subsequent advocates of land reform. His unquestioned benevolence and personal sincerity meant that his radicalism provoked a less hostile reaction than might otherwise have been the case. Having been a lifelong bachelor of reclusive habits, Ogilvie died at Aberdeen on 14 February 1819, recognized as &#145;one of the most accomplished scholars of the age&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 23 Feb 1819), and was buried in the south transept of St Machar's Cathedral, Aberdeen.<br>
