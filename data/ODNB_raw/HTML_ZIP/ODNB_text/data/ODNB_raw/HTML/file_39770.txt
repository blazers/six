<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lacy,  James</span>  (1696&#150;1774), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was descended from an old Anglo-Irish family. Although the Lacys possessed a vast estate before the civil war, their loyalty to the house of Stuart served only to ruin them, their descendants as a consequence being &#145;forced to follow Fortune in almost all the different Services of Europe&#146;  (Victor, 83). Little is known of the early life of James Lacy, but by 1722 he was living in Norwich, where he earned a living as &#145;a reputable Dealer in the Manufactures of that City&#146;  (Victor, 64). With his business failing, however, he looked towards the stage, and made his first appearance with the Norwich company in the season 1723&#150;4. Soon afterwards he moved to London, where he appears to have found employment with John Rich's company at Lincoln's Inn Fields. The date of his stage d&eacute;but in London is uncertain, but on 2 May 1727 he made an appearance as Herodorus in David Lewis's <span class="italic">Philip of Macedon</span>.<br>
<br>Lacy remained at Lincoln's Inn for a further year, before moving to the Haymarket Theatre for the 1728&#150;9 season. His roles there included Acasto in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">The Orphan</span> and Worthy in George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span>. The following year he appeared both at the New Haymarket and with Odell's troupe at Goodman's Fields. He then spent a further season at the Haymarket before engaging with the Covent Garden company in the autumn of 1732. He left Covent Garden in the summer of 1734, possibly to rejoin the players at Lincoln's Inn, with whom he is known to have appeared in the summer of 1735. In the autumn of 1735 Lacy returned to the Haymarket to work under the direction of Henry Fielding. As a member of &#145;the Great Mogul's Company of English Comedians&#146;, he appeared in two popular farces by Fielding, taking the parts of Fustian in <span class="italic">Pasquin</span> (1736) and Sour-Wit in <span class="italic">The Historical Register</span> (1737). On 4 May 1737 Lacy appeared in an afterpiece of his own, <span class="italic">Fame, or, Queen Elizabeth's Trumpets</span>, advertised as &#145;a new Satyrical, Allegorical, Political Farce&#146;.<br>
<br>The passage of the <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span> in 1737 brought an end to all performances at the Haymarket. In December 1737, and in a direct challenge to the terms of the <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span>, Lacy began to offer public &#145;lectures&#146; at the York Buildings in Villiers Street. These readings, which comprised a number of separate speaking parts shared out between Lacy and his assistants, were dramatic performances in all but name. Lacy was consequently arrested and sent to Bridewell, where he remained until the end of February 1738. After being released from prison he continued to defy the <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span>, offering a further series of &#145;orations&#146; at the York Buildings. In 1740 he negotiated the lease of Ranelagh House and gardens, where he designed and built a theatre.<br>
<br>In May 1742 Lacy returned to the London stage, taking the title role in a Drury Lane performance of Thomas Southerne's <span class="italic">Oroonoko</span>. In 1744 he was approached by Amber and Green, city bankers keen to take an interest in the Drury Lane theatre. The two men, perhaps encouraged by Lacy's reputation for &#145;candor and integrity&#146;  (Victor, 73), entered into an agreement whereby they loaned him the money to buy the theatre patent from Charles Fleetwood. David Garrick, who had himself been offered the patent by Fleetwood, quickly fell out with Lacy. The refusal of the new manager to honour Fleetwood's debts incensed the young actor, who in the summer of 1745 quit London for Dublin. The absence of Garrick and the turmoil of the Jacobite rising caused the receipts at Drury Lane to fall alarmingly.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1747 Lacy made his peace with Garrick, and offered the actor the opportunity to buy a half-share of the business, including patent, theatre lease, properties, and costumes, for &pound;12,000. The partnership was immediately successful, and by the summer of 1750 the accumulated profits already outweighed the sum of each partner's original investment. In addition to a handsome share of the profits at the season's end, Lacy paid himself a salary of &pound;500 per year. He ran the financial side of the business, ensuring the theatre remained in good condition, and that the props, costumes, and sceneries were paid for. Garrick managed the actors, and supervised all artistic business. The association between Garrick and Lacy continued until the latter's death in 1774.<br>
<br>In January 1728 a &#145;Mrs Lacy&#146; appeared alongside James Lacy in a performance of John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> at Lincoln's Inn Fields. It is assumed that this actress was Lacy's wife. The same actress appeared with Lacy at the Bartholomew and Southwark fairs in the summer of 1730 and spent the following season at the Haymarket. This Mrs Lacy revisited the fairs in 1734 and 1736, and made her final appearance at Southwark in 1740 in a performance of the pantomime <span class="italic">Harlequin Faustus</span>. Some time before 1748 James Lacy began a relationship with Ann Willoughby, an actress in the Drury Lane company. Willoughby made her d&eacute;but at Drury Lane in September 1748, and remained there for four seasons. She retired at the end of the 1752 season, and died on 11 November 1768. Although she styled herself as a second &#145;Mrs Lacy&#146;, there is no firm evidence that she and Lacy were married.<br>
<br>According to one report, despite the financial success of Drury Lane, Lacy's attraction to increasingly outlandish forms of speculation caused him to lose much of his fortune, a significant part of which was wasted &#145;searching for coal-mines in Oxfordshire&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 69, 1779, 172). On 21 January 1774 Lacy died at his home, Turk's House, Isleworth, Middlesex. He was buried in the churchyard of St James's Church, Paddington, on 30 January.<br>
<br>In 1774 Willoughby Lacy (1749&#150;1831), the son of James Lacy and Ann Willoughby, inherited his father's share of the partnership with Garrick. The same year he appeared on stage in Birmingham, in Norwich, and then at Drury Lane. In 1778, following Garrick's decision to sell the moiety of his patent and other interest in the Drury Lane theatre, Lacy followed suit, selling his half-share in the theatre to the partnership of Sheridan, Linley, and Ford. The sale of the Lacy share raised &pound;45,000, half of which was already owed to Garrick. Following the sale Lacy spent time as an itinerant actor, appearing in London in 1784, and Dublin in 1785. A recipient of a series of theatre benefit performances between 1798 and 1801, he seems to have fallen heavily into debt in later life. In 1813 he published a direct appeal to the public for financial assistance. He died, aged eighty-two, on 17 September 1831.<br>
