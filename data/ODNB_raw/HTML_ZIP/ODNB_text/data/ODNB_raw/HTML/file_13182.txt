<span class="headword">Heywood,  Jasper</span>  (1535&#150;1598), <span class="occ">poet and Jesuit</span>, was born in London, fourth of five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13183/', "John Heywood (b. 1496/7, d. in or after 1578)")</script> and his wife, Joan (<i>d</i>. 1574), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23149/', "John Rastell")</script> and Elizabeth More, Sir Thomas More's sister. Heywood was a schoolmate to Princess Elizabeth at court, where his father (a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of More) was a playwright and music tutor. He went to Oxford in 1547, graduated BA on 15 July 1553, and was elected a fellow of Merton College, gaining repute as a &#145;quaint poet&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.663). On 4 April 1558 his promising career at Merton ended when, in conflict with authority as usual, he had to resign his fellowship after repeated admonitions by the college's warden. Nevertheless Heywood proceeded MA on 10 June 1558 and was in November elected to a fellowship at All Souls College following in his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13180/', "Ellis Heywood's")</script> footsteps.<br>
<br>At All Souls Heywood justified the esteem accorded him by publishing the first English translations of three tragedies by Seneca&#151;<span class="italic">Troas</span> (1559), <span class="italic">Thyestes</span> (1560), and <span class="italic">Hercules furens</span> (1561)&#151;thus making an important contribution to the development of Elizabethan and Jacobean drama. Some of Heywood's poems of this period were later published in Elizabethan miscellanies. Heywood's tenure at All Souls ended when, refusing to comply with Elizabethan religious reforms, he left Oxford to live briefly at Gray's Inn with his uncle William Rastell. He then went into exile at Rome, where he became a Jesuit on 21 May 1562. In Rome Heywood taught and studied for the priesthood until he was sent to the university at Dillingen, Bavaria, in March 1564. On 1 September 1564 he graduated BTh and was ordained a priest on 16 October. Heywood was later chosen to preach on 15 June 1567 at a synod of the diocese of Augsburg held for the purpose of promulgating reforms of the Council of Trent. Having defended a dissertation on the seven sacraments he graduated DTh from Dillingen on 12 August 1567. He professed the fourth vow of the Jesuits on 25 July 1570.<br>
<br>During the 1570s Heywood grew discontented with his situation in Bavaria, deprived of the stimulating intellectual culture he had enjoyed at Oxford and Rome. He suffered from gout and experienced terror at night, an affliction he called a &#145;demon&#146;  (Duhr, 229), which was not cured by exorcism. A further vexation was friction with his Jesuit superior, Paul Hoffaeus, in a controversy over the contracting of loans at 5 per cent interest by Bavarian merchants. Heywood, with many Jesuit colleagues, thought the loans usurious.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1580, while Heywood was in Munich attached to the court of Wilhelm V, duke of Bavaria, he met Edmund Campion, passing from Prague toward Rome to undertake the secret Jesuit mission to England. Campion later wrote to the pope that Heywood could be valuable to the mission. Heywood himself travelled to Rome at the end of 1580, lobbying his case against the 5 per cent loans over the head of Hoffaeus. But Heywood's energetic opposition did not prevent the success of Hoffaeus's policy. With a letter from the pope to Duke Wilhelm, Heywood was reassigned to the English mission. Having left Rome on 6 May 1581 Heywood arrived at Newcastle in June, then travelled toward London to meet Campion and Robert Persons, both in England since the previous spring. Returning after twenty years in exile, Heywood brought to the English mission an outlook and style of missionary work quite different from those of Persons, his superior. Born and bred at the court of Henry VIII, Heywood had personal acquaintance not only with Queen Elizabeth but with other aristocrats in England and abroad&#151;experience that led him, unlike Persons, to think of the mission as largely a matter of influencing great noble houses. This contrast is partly reflected in Heywood's re-entering England through Newcastle, the port controlled by Henry Percy, eighth earl of Northumberland, a leading pro-Catholic peer.<br>
<br>By the time Heywood came south to meet with Persons, Campion had been arrested, a severe loss to the mission. After the uneasy meeting Heywood returned to the north, where pro-Catholic feeling ran strong. In three months he was able to convert hundreds to Roman Catholicism. In October 1581 he returned to London bearing alms for imprisoned Catholics from the northern nobility and gentry. By this time Persons had retired to France for consultations about the crisis of the mission, leaving Heywood in charge.<br>
<br>In December 1581 Campion was executed. Alone, as deputy superior of the mission, Heywood followed his success in the north with a campaign at Oxford and Cambridge designed to make the universities &#145;perpetual aqueducts&#146;  (Jesuit Archives, Rome, Anglia 30.1, 119) through which would pass young English scholars bound to finish their studies at continental seminaries. Heywood also took up Persons's earlier contact with the Spanish ambassador, Mendoza, himself in touch with Northumberland and the pro-Catholic lords. One of Mendoza's concerns was to divert the stream of Heywood's &#145;aqueducts&#146; toward filling the need for officers to lead a contingent of English exiles and deserters attached to the duke of Parma's army in the Spanish Netherlands. These troops were to take part in an invasion of England and restore Catholicism. In this plan, Northumberland's participation was thought essential.<br>
<br>For his part Heywood worked to develop contacts with what he called &#145;big fish&#146;. By early 1583 he had made efforts toward reconciling to Catholicism the three most ancient earldoms of the realm, in the persons of the earls of Arundel, Derby, and Northumberland. Politically the most important of these was Northumberland, who at this time dispatched his trusted aide, Captain William Pullen, to be ordained a priest at Rheims and then to serve as chaplain to the company of English fugitives in Parma's army. Arundel and Northumberland themselves, after contact with Heywood, were formally converted to Catholicism. Despite these successes, Heywood encountered increasingly severe difficulties dealing with a split among the Catholic priests in England. Those ordained abroad sought to conduct affairs by regulations of the Council of Trent; but Marian and earlier priests insisted that, until Tridentine reforms were promulgated in England, the ancient rules of English Catholicism should pertain. These tensions, aggravated under government persecution, culminated in a synod called to settle differences, at which Heywood's attempted rulings were challenged and protested so sharply that he was recalled for consultation with Persons in France.<br>
<br>Heywood had embarked at Rye and was approaching Dieppe when a squall drove his ship back to Queenborough. On 9 December 1583 he was arrested and sent to London for imprisonment in the Clink. On 5 February 1584 he was indicted for treason and on 8 February was transferred into the Tower and subjected to torture. On 6 May his trial was begun but suspended <i>sine die</i>. At Christmas 1584 Heywood was visited in the Tower by his replacement on the Jesuit mission, William Weston, disguised as a family member in the company of Heywood's sister Elizabeth Donne. Heywood's nephew John Donne was present on this occasion and witnessed a discussion between Weston and Heywood about petitioning the queen for toleration of Catholicism.<br>
<br>On 21 January 1585 Heywood, with other priests, was deported to France. Travelling from Rouen to Paris to Rheims, he was debriefed by Persons but was judged &#145;out of step&#146; and prevented from returning to England. Instead he was summoned to Rome, where he arrived in June 1585. In April 1586 he was sent to Naples, where, determinedly protesting against the policies of Persons, he remained until his death on 19 February 1598.<br>
