<span class="headword">Herne, Sir  Joseph</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1639, <em>d.</em> 1699), <span class="occ">merchant and financier</span>, was born in London and baptized on 17 April 1639, the eighth son of Nicholas Herne, a merchant tailor, and the fourth son of Susan, his second wife. His early career is obscure, but in 1671 he became a freeman of the East India Company, and on 23 July 1672 he married Elizabeth, the daughter of Sir John Frederick of Old Jewry, London. Frederick was himself a major figure in trade with the Peninsula, and Herne succeeded him as head of their joint firm in 1685. The Hernes had seven sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1678 Herne was elected to the committee of the East India Company, on which he served continuously down to 1686, and then from 1687 to 1694 and from 1698 until his death. In 1686 he became a London alderman, sitting for Broad Street; but he discharged himself the following year, probably in anticipation of the purging of Anglicans from the bench. Membership of the Mercers' Company followed in 1687.<br>
<br>It was after the revolution of 1688, however, that Herne emerged to some prominence. He was elected MP for Dartmouth on 28 November 1689 (and represented the constituency until his death), and was knighted on 15 September 1690. He invested widely in a number of the new industrial and trading concerns of the early 1690s and, in partnership with the goldsmith&#150;banker Sir Stephen Evance and others, used his international trading connections to handle the government's military remittances, first to Ireland (1690&#150;91) and then, between May 1691 and October 1694, to the continent. This latter business was undertaken in the most difficult financial circumstances and, even after the newly founded Bank of England had taken over from Herne, it was his credit that kept the artillery train in Flanders from starving late in 1694.<br>
<br>After being elected governor of the East India Company for 1690&#150;92, Herne defended the company's monopoly and the record of its previous governor, Sir Josiah Child, in the Commons. With Sir Thomas Cooke, his successor as governor, he appears to have been party to some extremely shady deals to break up the opposition group in 1693&#150;4, and to have engaged in bribery to help secure a new charter for the company in 1694; all this brought a parliamentary storm on his head in the spring of 1696. But when in 1698 a new company finally won the trade in return for a loan of &pound;2 million, Herne broke with Child and brought the &#145;old&#146; company into the subscription so that it could continue in the trade.<br>
<br>East India affairs apart, Herne's parliamentary career was limited to sitting on a number of committees (the committee set up early in 1695 to prevent the clipping of the coin being probably the most notable). During 1696 he was appointed one of the commissioners to receive subscriptions for a land bank, but the subscription failed; and in 1697 he was made one of the trustees for circulating exchequer bills. It fell to Herne, as chairman of the trustees, to face the parliamentary attack of early 1698 on the fraudulent endorsements of these bills by Charles Duncombe. About the same time, and rather surprisingly for a tory committed to the old East India Company and one who had lost the remittance contract to the newly founded Bank of England, Herne also joined the so-called tobacco contractors. These contractors had won from Peter the Great the right to export tobacco from England to Russia, but many were &#145;whiggish&#146; and closely connected with both the Bank of England and the soon to be established &#145;new&#146; East India Company. (Possibly this connection has some bearing on Herne's break with Child.)<br>
<br>Herne died suddenly of a brain haemorrhage on 26 February 1699, worth &#145;near &pound;200,000&#146;, and received a sumptuous funeral.<br>
<br>Herne's brother <a name="cosubject_53021"></a><span class="headword">Sir Nathaniel Herne</span>  (<em>c.</em>1629&#150;1679)<span class="occ"></span>, the eldest son of Nicholas Herne and his second wife, Susan, was apprenticed to Sir John Frederick and took his freedom in the Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company in 1655. On 1 September 1656 he married Frederick's daughter Judith and entered into partnership with his father-in-law. The firm was principally engaged in the Spanish trade and suffered under Cromwell's policy; Herne was probably the &#145;stout and active young citizen&#146; concerned in cavalier plots in the City in 1657.<br>
<br>Herne led an extremely busy life spanning business and politics. His firm's west country connections led him to engage in parliamentary politics in support of Joseph Williamson in 1667. His attendance at East India Company committee meetings from 1667 onwards was exemplary: he held the deputy governorship from 1672 and the governorship from 1674 until his death, and engaged in covert intelligence gathering for the company and the government. In the City he was elected sheriff in 1674&#150;5, common councilman in 1675&#150;6, and alderman from 1676 until his death. Maintaining his links with Dartmouth, where it is believed that he expended no less than &pound;1000 per annum on improving the town's water supply, he was elected its MP in 1679. In parliament he sat on seventeen committees, the most important being that for securing the king and kingdom against popery. Herne died after a short illness on 10 August 1679, leaving a substantial holding of East India Company stock, valued at the revolution of 1688 at &pound;10,838.<br>
