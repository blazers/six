<span class="headword">Colman,  Cecil</span>  (1878&#150;1954), <span class="occ">shoe manufacturer and retailer</span>, was born on 30 May 1878 in Bournemouth, one of nine children of the Revd Robert Colman, Baptist minister, and his wife, Sophia (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Allen). His father was the son of a partner in the mustard firm of J. and J. Colman, and became involved in a number of civic and business enterprises. After an unexceptional school career at Christchurch School, Hampshire, Colman was educated privately before taking his first job at seventeen in a small Bournemouth shoe manufacturing and retailing company of which his father was a director. In 1897 the company failed and Colman set up a short-lived shoe factoring partnership with his brother, Robert. This widened his experience in the wholesaling and retailing of shoes.<br>
<br>In 1901, aged only twenty-two, Colman joined Howlett and White, a leading firm of shoe manufacturers, founded in Norwich in 1846. He became the London sales manager and export agent. In 1903 he married Florence Beatrice Laws; they had four sons and one daughter. In 1912 he was appointed to the board of Howlett and White and he played an increasingly important role in its affairs thereafter. Appointed deputy chairman and joint managing director of the expanded company in 1935, he served as chairman from 1947. By this stage the restructured company employed some 1700 employees in two Norwich factories, over 1000 in a Northampton subsidiary and several hundred more in its Mansfield subsidiary. Colman retired in June 1953.<br>
<br>Colman was the central figure in a managerial team responsible for the company's growth. His precise role is not always easy to distinguish from that of others in the team, but he was highly regarded by his colleagues for his innovative methods and organizational ability in finance and marketing. He was responsible for organizing the process of expansion by merger, which led to the acquisition of a number of important rivals: the Mansfield Shoe Co. in 1919, Oakeshott and Finnemore, a large Northampton firm, in 1922, and S. L. Witton of Norwich, which specialized in children's shoes, in 1934. The company was restructured in 1935 as the Norvic Shoe Co. Ltd and in 1946 it further expanded by acquiring the old Northampton house of John Marlow &amp; Son.<br>
<br>The development of new marketing strategies also owed a lot to Colman. In 1911 the Norvic trade mark was adopted, and an advertising department was created in order that national advertising campaigns could be organized. Impressed by American experience, Colman pioneered the Norvic concentration plan, an early form of franchising which involved over fifty shops. Colman was also involved in the development of a company pension scheme and the expansion of wider welfare provisions, building on a paternalistic tradition in Howlett and White, which had recognized relatively early the rights of its workforce to organize. At the end of the Second World War he supervised the shift of the firm's headquarters to London and its reorganization. The importance of the group in the British shoe industry meant that Colman's influence was able to extend more widely. He was a president of the Boot and Shoe Manufacturers' Association of Great Britain and chaired the Branded Retailers' Association.<br>
<br>After the First World War Colman made his home in Sutton and Cheam where he was first elected councillor in 1929, alderman in 1934, and mayor in 1935. He was also a magistrate and was involved in various local charitable activities as well as the chamber of trade and the Rotarians. A Liberal in politics he was for a long period the president of the Epsom division Liberal Association.<br>
<br>An important figure in the manufacturing and retailing of shoes, Colman played a vital role in the transformation of the industry in the inter-war period. Under his leadership, merger of a number of small businesses led to the emergence of the Norvic Shoe Co. Ltd as the largest manufacturer of shoes in Britain. Colman died at 32 The Avenue, Cheam, on 11 March 1954, and was buried at the South London crematorium on 15 March. He was survived by his wife.<br>
