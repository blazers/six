<span class="headword">Power,  Cyril Edward Mary</span>  (1872&#150;1951), <span class="occ">architect and linocut artist</span>, was born on 17 December 1872 at 14 Redcliffe Street, Chelsea, London, the son of Edward William Power, architect and grandson of Edward Power, architect, of Bristol, and his wife, Amelia Poole Berry. Educated in Kensington and encouraged to draw from a young age, he followed the family tradition by joining his father's architectural practice. His early abilities were recognized in 1900 with the award of the Soane medallion by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) for his design of an art school. In 1902 he was elected an associate member of the RIBA and for the next twenty years he pursued a career in architecture. On 27 August 1904 he married Dorothy Mary Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1882/3), daughter of George Frederic Roper Nunn, agent, of Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, with whom he had three sons and one daughter. From 1905, among other public works, he worked on designing and building the General Post Office King Edward VII Building in King Edward Street, central London, with Sir Richard Allington in the Ministry of Works. During this period Power was a part-time lecturer in architectural history and design in the school of architecture at University College, London, under Professor Simpson, and also at Goldsmiths' College. Academically minded, he published <span class="italic">English Mediaeval Architecture</span> (1912), a two-volume history largely illustrated with his pen-and-ink sketches.<br>
<br>In 1916 Power was commissioned into the Royal Flying Corps, where he supervised the repair workshops at Lympne aerodrome, near Folkestone. On demobilization he moved with his family to Bury St Edmunds, where he resumed his architectural practice, in 1920 designing the library extensions at Bradwell Manor, near Mistley, Essex, for his patron Lord Iveagh. In 1922 when nearly fifty, Power suddenly abandoned architecture, his wife, and four children (the youngest of whom was born in December 1921) and returned to London, with the idea of becoming an artist. He took with him a 24-year-old art student, <a name="cosubject_50787"></a><span class="headword">Sybil Andrews</span>  (1898&#150;1992)<span class="occ"></span>, whom he had met the year before. Born in Bury St Edmunds on 19 April 1898, she was the daughter of Charles Andrews (1861&#150;1922), ironmonger, and Beatrice Martha Trigg (1868&#150;1929). Andrews did war work as an oxy-acetylene welder on aeroplanes in Bristol and began her art education in 1918 with John Hassall's correspondence course. Power helped the young Andrews with compositional drawing and design; they held a joint exhibition of their watercolours and pastels inspired by local subjects at the Crescent House, Angel Hill, in Bury St Edmunds in December 1921.<br>
<br>In 1922 Power and Andrews enrolled at Heatherley School of Fine Art, where Iain Macnab was co-principal. Here they declared their artistic beliefs in a joint unpublished paper &#145;Aims of the art of to-day&#146;; inspired by the rhetoric of the Italian futurists, they called for an art of the modern age that was expressed through dynamism and movement. In October 1925 Macnab appointed Power to teach the principles of perspective for artists and to provide courses on architectural history at his newly opened Grosvenor School of Modern Art at 33 Warwick Square, Pimlico, London; Andrews was appointed as the school secretary. When Claude Flight joined the staff in the following year, Power and Andrews were among the most gifted students in his popular linocut classes. They participated in Flight's &#145;First Exhibition of British Lino-Cuts&#146; at the Redfern Gallery, London, in 1929; thereafter they regularly exhibited their dynamic linocuts of modern speed and movement in group shows during the 1930s. Power and Andrews achieved wider critical recognition with their joint exhibition of monotypes and linocuts at the Redfern in 1933; under the pseudonym Andrew-Power, they also collaborated on several lithographic posters for sports venues commissioned by the London Passenger Transport Board.<br>
<br>Andrews established her studio at 2 Brook Green, Hammersmith, London, which she shared with Power from 1928 until their partnership came to an end in July 1938. At Brook Green they closely collaborated on the themes, colours, and designs of their linocuts; in 1934, a critic for the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> observed, &#145;They are co-workers in the same studio, each inspiring the other in the conception of ideas and their pictorial realisation&#146;  (12 July 1934, 15). By virtue of his wider experience and maturity Power was perhaps the more creative force of the partnership in the development of ideas while Andrews was technically superior in the cutting and registering of the printing blocks. A romantic about the medieval past, Power was equally at home in expressing the modernity of his own age. He took to heart the dynamism of the metropolitan rush; among his most striking images were those inspired by the London underground, where his architectural training informed the bold, architectonic forms and sweeping rhythms. By contrast Andrews's themes, drawn mainly from her native Suffolk, expressed the agricultural cycle and the rhythms of seasonal change. Musically gifted and intensely interested in all things medieval, Power learned to play the viola da gamba and the recorder; he also spent many hours transcribing early music manuscripts in the British Museum Library. The Brook Green studio became a meeting place for the Recorder Society and for those interested in early music, including the Dolmetsch family.<br>
<br>When their artistic partnership broke up in 1938, Andrews moved to Norley Wood near Lymington in the New Forest to a cottage that Power had renovated for her. Power, then aged almost sixty-six, returned to his family at New Malden, Surrey, for the final thirteen years of his life. Although he lectured to local art societies and continued to paint in oils and watercolours until his death, he ceased to make linocuts. A highly cultivated dilettante without the income, Power perhaps dissipated his energies over too wide a field. On 20 May 1951 Power died at his home, 24 Howard Road, New Malden, aged seventy-eight. His obituary in the <span class="italic">Surrey Comet</span> (26 May 1951) was entitled &#145;Artist, architect and musician. Death of Mr C. E. Power&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1943 Andrews married Walter Morgan, a shipyard worker whom she had met in the shipyards near Southampton while doing war work; in 1947 they emigrated to Canada, settling in Campbell River, a remote logging township on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. After initial years of hardship she built a studio and eventually resumed her career as a linocut artist. In 1980 a solo exhibition of her prints was held at the Michael Parkin Gallery, London. A major travelling retrospective organized in 1982&#150;3 by the Glenbow Museum, Calgary, brought her national recognition in Canada. Her notes and thoughts on art gained from her private teaching at Campbell River since 1960 were published in London as <span class="italic">Artist's Kitchen</span> (<i>c</i>.1986). Andrews died at Campbell River on 21 December 1992. A few months before her death she donated a large collection of her linocuts to the British Museum; the Glenbow Museum holds a complete representation of her work in all media.<br>
