<span class="headword">Borthwick,  Alastair Charles</span>  (1913&#150;2003), <span class="occ">journalist and mountaineer</span>, was born on 17 February 1913 at 38 Calderwood Road, Rutherglen, Lanarkshire, the son of Alexander Charles Borthwick, electrical engineer, and his wife, Jessie Scotland, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bayne. He was brought up in Troon, Ayrshire, but moved to Glasgow where he attended Glasgow high school until, aged sixteen, he became a copytaker on the <span class="italic">Evening Times</span>. The job called for literacy, quick fingers, and patience with the person at the other end of the line. For Borthwick it was the way into journalism. Still in his teens, he moved upwards to the <span class="italic">Glasgow Weekly Herald</span> where a minute and overstretched staff gave him the entr&eacute;e to every aspect of the journal and most significantly the open-air page. Through it he discovered the pleasures and skills of rock climbing, an activity hitherto more or less the preserve of the relatively well-off, but which young Scotsmen and women of limited means and none were then making their own. He recounted his experiences for the page and many appeared in his first book, <span class="italic">Always a Little Further</span> (1939), the title taken from the song of the ragged pilgrims in James Elroy Flecker's <span class="italic">The Golden Journey to Samarkand</span>, who aimed to go &#145;beyond that last blue mountain barred with snow&#146;.<br>
<br>It was the fun of exploring and climbing in good company that attracted Borthwick to mountaineering, as much as the romanticism of it. His book was packed with tales of &#145;dossing in howffs&#146; (sleeping in bothies), encounters with the highland underclass of tinkers and poachers, heroic hitch-hiking, and hair-raising climbs by novices. Borthwick was not noted as a pioneer of new routes, but he set down memorably what it was like for the ordinary climber on the rock face. Although he seems not to have frequented the hills after the Second World War, his book became a classic, often reprinted, and more than sixty years later was prayed in aid in the fight to save the small, remote youth hostels which he and his friends had enjoyed from being closed to make the Scottish Youth Hostels Association a commercial success.<br>
<br>One chapter in <span class="italic">Always a Little Further</span>, called &#145;Shilling a night&#146; (the standard charge), described the cheerful internationalism of Scots and Germans carousing after a soaking on the hills at Arrochar hostel, at the head of Loch Long. But Borthwick went to war against the Germans in 1939. He served with the 5th Seaforth Highlanders, mostly as a battalion intelligence officer, from the western desert to Sicily and north-west Europe, having on 24 September 1940 married Ann Falconer Tait Corbett (<i>d</i>. 2003), a 26-year-old civil servant in the Ministry of Information (later a radio journalist), and daughter of James Lockhead Corbett, advertising agent. They had one son, Patrick.<br>
<br>Borthwick came unscathed through the war and achieved his greatest and most terrifying feat almost at the end in the Netherlands, when his sense of direction (the maps were faulty), honed in the very different countryside of the highlands, enabled him to lead 600 men in pitch dark to a position behind the enemy lines, where they dug in. He hated war and the army but, as he told an interviewer in the last years of his life, he regarded his second book, <span class="italic">Sans Peur</span> (1946), as his best. Taking its title from the Seaforths' motto, the book was a history of his unit in the years 1942&#150;5, and unlike many regimental histories was written not by a committee or a retired general but by a humble captain who was there. Conveying some of the same sense of adventure which illumines <span class="italic">Always a Little Further</span>, it was republished as <span class="italic">Battalion</span> in 1994, and was widely acclaimed by military historians.<br>
<br>Before the war Borthwick had spent a short and unhappy spell at the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> in London. He returned to Scotland where he had already started a broadcasting career which ran from 1934 to 1995. A BBC producer, James Fergusson, &#145;saw him in the studio treating the microphone like an old friend, chatting away, waving his arms about, and I knew this was how it was done&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 6 Oct 2003). Fergusson was lured by Borthwick to make what may have been the first live climbing broadcast, from Agag's Groove in Glen Coe. Further commissions followed.<br>
<br>For seven years after the war Borthwick combined smallholding on Jura with broadcasting. On air he was as prolific as he was catholic in subject matter. He presented such long-running radio series as &#145;Scottish survey&#146;, an assessment of post-war Scotland, and &#145;Matter of opinion&#146;. He was appointed OBE in 1951 for organizing a heavy engineering event at the Scottish end of the Festival of Britain. Later he wrote and presented scores of programmes on topics ranging from Senator McCarthy to Scottish history for Grampian TV. Although it is the two books for which he is best remembered, Borthwick took modest pride in his ephemeral broadcasting and journalism, claiming only that he was &#145;fit to turn out a decent job on most subjects as required&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 6 Oct 2003). In retirement Borthwick and his wife lived on a hill farm near Barr, Ayrshire, before moving to a nursing home, Spiers Care Home, Beith. Suffering from cancer of the prostate and oesophagus, he died there of bronchopneumonia on 25 September 2003. His funeral was held at Beith crematorium. He was survived by his son, Patrick, his wife, Ann, having died earlier in the year.<br>
