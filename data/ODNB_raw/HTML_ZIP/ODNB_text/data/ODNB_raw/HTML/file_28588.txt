<span class="headword">Walmisley,  Thomas Attwood</span>  (1814&#150;1856), <span class="occ">composer and organist</span>, was born on 21 January 1814 at 18 Cowley Street, Westminster. He was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28589/', "Thomas Forbes Walmisley (1783&#150;1866)")</script>, composer and organist, and his wife, who was the eldest daughter of William Capon, draughtsman to the duke of York. Displaying musical ability at an early age, he was initially guided by his father and subsequently placed under his godfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/877/', "Thomas Attwood")</script>, organist of St Paul's Cathedral and composer to the Chapel Royal. In 1830 he was appointed organist of Croydon parish church, where he made the acquaintance of Thomas Miller, a former fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, an amateur musician and well-known tutor. Miller not only encouraged Walmisley's interest in literature and mathematics, but was also probably instrumental in his gaining election on 1 February 1833, as organist of Trinity and St John's colleges, and in his subsequent decision to read for an arts degree. An attempt the previous year by the impresario Monck Mason to persuade him to write an opera for his season at the King's Theatre in London had proved unsuccessful, and Walmisley spent virtually the rest of his life in Cambridge.<br>
<br>In 1832 Walmisley competed unsuccessfully for the Gresham prize, awarded annually for the best new anthem or service setting. On 1 July 1833 he graduated MusB from Trinity, his exercise being the orchestrally accompanied anthem &#145;Let God arise&#146;, and in Michaelmas 1834 he matriculated at Corpus Christi College. Later in the year he moved to Jesus College, and he subsequently took the mathematical tripos, graduating eighteenth junior optime in 1838 and proceeding MA (from Trinity) in 1841. The (non-resident) professor of music, John Clarke-Whitfeld&#151;under whom music enjoyed a very low status within the university&#151;was aged and infirm and it fell to Walmisley to compose the <span class="italic">Ode for the Installation of the Marquis of Camden as Chancellor of the University</span>, performed on 7 July 1835 under Sir George Smart and with Maria Malibran as principal soloist. After Clarke-Whitfeld's death in 1836 Walmisley, though still an undergraduate, was chosen to succeed him, and in 1848 he presented himself for the MusD. During his tenure he raised the standing of the faculty of music both through his own position and education (as the first professor to be a full member of the university) and through his institution of regular lectures. After fourteen years in office he could observe that although music was still not greatly cultivated by university members, a taste for it was rapidly increasing.<br>
<br>Professorial duties apart, the main focus of Walmisley's professional activity lay in his direction of the joint choir of Trinity and St John's. This involved playing for at least four services each Sunday, but the choir achieved a reputation as one of the best in England. He composed a number of important services and anthems for them in which, like his contemporary S. S. Wesley, he developed the concept of an independent organ accompaniment. Notable in this respect are &#145;If the Lord himself&#146; and &#145;The Lord shall comfort Zion&#146; (both 1840) and his best-known work, the evening service in D minor (1855). Other works of note are the evening service in B[flat] for double choir (1845), which reflects his admiration for the music of J. S. Bach, and &#145;Remember, O Lord&#146; (with orchestral accompaniment) which won the prize offered in 1838 by the Ancient Concerts Society in Dublin.<br>
<br>Although remembered today solely for his church music, in his youth Walmisley composed extensively for the orchestra and chamber ensembles. A piano trio, two string quartets, two organ concertos, and two overtures all predate his appointment to Cambridge, but thereafter his secular works were predominantly vocal, including some attractive songs and madrigals. Noteworthy exceptions are a fine third string quartet (1840) and two sonatinas for oboe and piano (<i>c</i>.1846). He also wrote a symphony (now unfortunately lost), which was played at the Philharmonic Society in 1840; however, he was disheartened by Mendelssohn's comment &#145;No. 1! Let us first see what no. 12 will be!&#146; (an allusion to the twelve symphonies for string orchestra that Mendelssohn had completed before writing his first one for full orchestra), and never returned to orchestral writing. An early supporter of the Cambridge University Musical Society, Walmisley also established a madrigal society and was active as a conductor: at a concert in the Senate House on 5 July 1847 Jenny Lind, Marietta Alboni, and Luigi Lablache were among the soloists, while the young Joachim played Mendelssohn's violin concerto.<br>
<br>Although renowned locally as an organist and composer, Walmisley never sought&#151;or earned&#151;the national recognition enjoyed by S. S. Wesley. Few of his compositions were published in his lifetime and most of his church music remained in manuscript until his father edited an extensive selection in 1857. Walmisley's health was eventually affected by his fondness for wine, which probably reduced his creativity and contributed to his early death. In the autumn of 1855, by now seriously ill, he moved to the Sussex coast. He died from bronchitis at 4 Caroline Place, St Mary-in-the-Castle, Hastings, on 17 January 1856 and was buried in Fairlight churchyard.<br>
