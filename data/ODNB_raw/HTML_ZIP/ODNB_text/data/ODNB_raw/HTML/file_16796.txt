<span class="headword">Livesey,  Joseph</span>  (1794&#150;1884), <span class="occ">temperance advocate</span>, was born on 5 March 1794 at Walton, near Preston, Lancashire. His parents, John Livesey and Jennette Ainsworth, died of consumption in 1801, and William, his only sibling, died early. Joseph's paternal grandfather, a small farmer also named Joseph, took responsibility for Joseph and for John's hand-loom weaving business, which failed. In a damp cellar, the young Joseph educated himself while working at the loom. Influenced by the Portlock family, he became a Scotch Baptist, was baptized (<i>c</i>.1811) in a Baptist chapel, and in 1815 married a Scotch Baptist, Jane Williams (<i>d</i>. 1869), the daughter of a Liverpool master rigger. The marriage was happy; the couple had ten sons (including the civil engineer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49327/', "James Livesey")</script>) and three daughters, but lost four children in infancy.<br>
<br>In 1816 Livesey moved from Walton to Preston and became a prosperous cheese factor, henceforth his lifelong occupation. Self-denying and economical with time, he was an exemplar of self-help. Acknowledging no barrier between middle and working class, he concentrated on making recruits for respectability and on harmonizing employer with employee. He was active in local government, championing municipal reform and public health with all the early-Victorian radical's angry energy, defending Preston's hand-loom weavers, and helping to fend off local application of the reformed poor law. Sharing the Quakers' distaste for formalities, he attacked privilege in religion as in everything else&#151;once deliberately sitting on a tasselled <span class="roman">Bible</span> cushion before beginning a sermon. But there was a gentler side: he loved children, and in repudiating Anglican and aristocratic values he was discriminating and not vindictive. His religion was unsectarian and practical, his daily life founded on the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>.<br>
<br>There were many early-Victorian Liveseys. Joseph was distinctive for acting upon his belief that economic progress required moral reform. He, above all others, pushed the temperance movement into abandoning beer as well as spirits, thus transforming it into an exhilarating crusade against the entire drink trade. This required courage, if only because beer then seemed essential to health. Yet Livesey was a teetotaller from early in 1831, and on 1 September 1832 joined six Preston men in taking a pledge to abstain experimentally from beer for one year. A temperance &#145;reformation&#146; seemed imminent, and he publicly walked arm-in-arm with drunkards ripe for reclamation.<br>
<br>A resourceful propagandist and courageous lecturer, Livesey gave teetotalism its doctrinal foundation with his populist, closely argued, widely delivered, and oft-reprinted <span class="italic">Malt Lecture</span>, complete with scientific demonstrations that then seemed exciting but now seem flawed. Teetotalism also benefited from the avalanche of his publications, weapons in a lifelong quest to improve the world. His monthly <span class="italic">Moral Reformer</span> (January 1831 &#150; December 1833) became the <span class="italic">Preston Temperance Advocate</span> (January 1834 &#150; December 1837), the first teetotal periodical. Its cheap woodcuts, plain speaking, and diverse approaches to its subject aimed at the millions. Likewise his widely circulated weekly, <span class="italic">The Struggle</span> (235 numbers from 1842 to 1846), helped render the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42282', "Anti-Corn Law League")</script> popular. From there he moved easily into general journalism, and from 1844 to 1859 he and his sons managed the <span class="italic">Preston Guardian</span>, a leading Liberal weekly. Livesey published many more teetotal periodicals and tracts, as well as his autobiography (1867&#150;82).<br>
<br>Yet by the 1850s teetotalism had lost momentum, and with others Livesey turned to prohibition, promoted from 1853 by the United Kingdom Alliance. Drink was, after all, a trade where his free-trade principles clearly did not apply. Characteristically, he soon questioned the new orthodoxy, seeing prohibitionists' political preoccupations as divisive and as downgrading the reclamation and visitation of drunkards which he prized. Controversy resulted, old friends were disappointed, and Livesey's later writings breathe an air of disillusioned nostalgia for the teetotallers' pioneering days. As an old man he was revered as the founder of a movement which now seems somewhat sectarian. It was an ironic outcome, for he had aimed, not at a movement, but at a reformation, nor had temperance ever been his sole enthusiasm. He died on 2 September 1884 at Bank Parade, Preston, and was buried in the nonconformist section of Preston cemetery.<br>
