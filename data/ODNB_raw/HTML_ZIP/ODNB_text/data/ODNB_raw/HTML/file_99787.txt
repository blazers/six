<span class="headword">Wright,  Richard William <span class="st"> [Rick]</span></span>  (1943&#150;2008), <span class="occ">keyboard player</span>, was born on 28 July 1943 at Brookdale Nursing Home, Hatch End, Middlesex, the son of Robert Charles Wright, a research chemist at Unigate Dairies, and his wife, Daisy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hughes. The family lived in Pinner, Middlesex, where Wright grew up with his two sisters. He was educated at Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, then a direct grant school in Cricklewood, north-west London. He showed an early aptitude for music, especially jazz, and played a number of instruments including the piano, trumpet, trombone, and guitar. On leaving school he went to the Regent Street Polytechnic to study architecture and met there Roger Waters and Nick Mason. They initially formed a rhythm and blues band, Sigma 6, with Waters on bass, Mason on drums, and Wright on keyboards, and were sometimes joined by a female vocalist, Juliette Sylvia Veronica Cecilia Gale (<i>b</i>. 1945), daughter of Harold Gale, motor mechanic. Wright later married her on 7 August 1969.<br>
<br>Sigma 6 renamed themselves the Architectural Abdabs (also known as the Screaming Abdabs) and went through various changes of personnel, though the trio of Wright, Mason, and Waters remained constant. In 1964 Wright left the Regent Street Polytechnic and enrolled at the London College of Music. In the following year the band was joined by one of Waters's neighbours, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/97292/', "Syd Barrett")</script>, then a student at the Camberwell School of Art. The resulting quartet first took the name the Tea Set and then the Pink Floyd Sound after the two bluesmen, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council, but Pink Floyd it soon became. They signed for the record company EMI in February 1967.<br>
<br>Under Barrett's influence Pink Floyd became known around London's new &#145;underground&#146; scene for their experimental music, innovative use of film, and dramatic light shows. They produced quirky and eccentric songs such as &#145;Arnold Layne&#146; and &#145;See Emily Play&#146;, their first two singles written by Barrett. Barrett largely wrote their first album, <span class="italic">The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</span>, released in 1967, as well. But he was increasingly dependent on drugs and went into a mental decline. He was replaced in the following year by a new lead guitarist, David Gilmour. Wright played on Barrett's two single albums released in 1970, <span class="italic">The Madcap Laughs</span> and <span class="italic">Barrett</span>.<br>
<br>Pink Floyd's second album, <span class="italic">A Saucerful of Secrets</span>, released in July 1968, was less whimsical. The extended title track to the album was in the distinctively dreamy and ethereal style that defined the group's music at this stage, arguably their most creative period. Wright's instrumental versatility, training in different styles&#151;from blues and jazz to classical and avant-garde&#151;and virtuosity on keyboards and newly emerging synthesizers was a great advantage to a band experimenting with new styles of music, sometimes dubbed &#145;psychedelic&#146; or &#145;progressive&#146;, and new musical and recording technologies. He was also able to sing lead vocals. Pink Floyd scored three films in this period, itself an innovation in the world of pop music: <span class="italic">More</span> (1969), a film by the French director Barbet Schroeder, about heroin addiction; Michelangelo Antonioni's trance-like <span class="italic">Zabriskie Point</span> (1970), about the American counter-culture in the 1960s; and Schroeder's <span class="italic">La Vall&eacute;e</span> (1972), about an encounter with the Mapuga tribe in New Guinea, the music for which became the album <span class="italic">Obscured by Clouds</span>.<br>
<br>Before this in 1969 Pink Floyd had released perhaps the most demanding of all their albums, <span class="italic">Ummagumma</span>. A double album, one record was of live performances and the other gave half a side to each of the members of the band for studio compositions. Wright's piece entitled &#145;Sysyphus&#151;Parts 1&#150;4&#146; was influenced by the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen. In the following year Pink Floyd released their most successful album to date, <span class="italic">Atom Heart Mother</span>, which was premiered at the Bath Festival and required a full orchestra and choir. Arguably it was on their next album, <span class="italic">Meddle</span> (1971), that Wright and the other members of the group made their most notable contribution in co-writing the celebrated piece &#145;Echoes&#146;, which took up the whole of the second side. This was the apotheosis of the Pink Floyd sound. If earlier pieces such as &#145;Interstellar Overdrive&#146; and &#145;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&#146; had tried to capture the sense of flight and space in deliberately futuristic compositions, &#145;Echoes&#146; was oceanic and subterranean. Developing from the sound of a sonar, it induced in the listener a sense of floating and drifting before building through a slow crescendo to a sudden, multi-layered electronic climax. The band played &#145;Echoes&#146; in their 1974 film <span class="italic">Pink Floyd at Pompeii</span>.<br>
<br>A year earlier Pink Floyd had released their most commercially successful album, <span class="italic">The Dark Side of the Moon</span>, which sold 20 million copies around the world, and was a fixture in the British album chart for six years and in the American chart for more than fourteen. In its focus on money, the rat race, madness&#151;the dark sides of modern life, in short&#151;it marked a new phase as the band moved towards the composition of so-called &#145;concept albums&#146;. Wright wrote or co-wrote a number of the most notable tracks including &#145;The Great Gig in the Sky&#146;, &#145;Breathe&#146;, and &#145;Us and Them&#146;. His piano-playing was important to the album's most immediately accessible song, &#145;Money&#146;, but as an instrumentalist it was his use of synthesizers on the instrumental &#145;Any Colour You Like&#146; which was most memorable. Here the many strands and textures of the melody envelop the listener, laying a basis for a powerful guitar solo from Gilmour.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Dark Side of the Moon</span> looked back to the electronic experimentation of the early Pink Floyd sound and forward to a more popular and accessible style favoured by Roger Waters that would ultimately divide the band. Three more albums followed in the later 1970s: <span class="italic">Wish You Were Here</span> (1975), which was a tribute to Barrett that included the memorable song &#145;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&#146;; <span class="italic">Animals</span> (1977); and <span class="italic">The Wall</span> (1979), a double album which explored modern alienation. By the time of its release, however, Waters and Wright had argued and Wright had left the band. Ostensibly over Wright's cocaine addiction and his late return from a holiday, the division also had personal and artistic roots. Wright played on as a salaried musician, however, which was not to his disadvantage: the vast spectacles that the band provided at each venue when they went on tour with <span class="italic">The Wall</span> were so expensive to mount that the three remaining members of Pink Floyd were saddled with a considerable financial loss.<br>
<br>Eventually the tensions between Wright and Waters were so uncontainable that Wright decided to leave altogether. The last appearance of the classic Pink Floyd line-up was at Earl's Court, London, in July 1981. In 1985 Waters himself split with Mason and Gilmour, allowing Wright to rejoin them in a reconstituted Pink Floyd in 1987. He contributed to the album <span class="italic">A Momentary Lapse of Reason</span> in that year and became a full member of the band again in the following year. Two final albums followed: one, in 1992, was the improbable soundtrack to <span class="italic">La Carrera Panamerica</span>, the Mexican classic car race; the other, in which Wright was very prominent, was the highly successful <span class="italic">The Division Bell</span> (1995), for which he co-wrote five songs and provided the lead vocals on &#145;Wearing the Inside Out&#146;. The four band members came together for a &#145;Live 8&#146; concert in Hyde Park in July 2005 but this was an unrepeatable event: Wright, for one, did not favour any further collaboration as a group, though he continued to work with Gilmour, contributing to his album <span class="italic">On an Island</span> in 2006 and touring with Gilmour in that year.<br>
<br>Wright released an unsuccessful solo album himself in 1978 under the unpromising title of <span class="italic">Wet Dream</span>. From 1983 to 1985 he worked with Dave Harris, who had been a member of the post-punk, new-romantic group Fashion, in a duo called Zee. But their album <span class="italic">Identity</span> failed to establish one, or to find an audience. In 1996 he released <span class="italic">Broken China</span>, a collaboration with Sinead O'Connor and the lyricist Anthony Moore on songs about depression.<br>
<br>Wright's marriage to Juliette Gale, with whom he had a son and a daughter, James and Gala, was dissolved in 1982. He married his second wife, Franka, a Greek fashion designer, in 1984; they divorced in 1994. On 16 June 1995 he married Mildred Irene (Millie) Hobbs, a writer, and daughter of Carlton David Hobbs, insurance broker. They had a son, Ben, but were later divorced. Wright, who had homes in France and the British Virgin Islands, died of cancer on 15 September 2008.<br>
