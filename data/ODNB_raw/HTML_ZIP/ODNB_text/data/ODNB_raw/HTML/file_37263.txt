<span class="headword">Carvajal,  Antonio Fernandez</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1659), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was probably born in Portugal, for in his youth he seems to have lived in Fund&atilde;o. He may have fled to Spain at some time, and apparently owned land in the Canary Islands. By the early 1630s he was in London, masquerading as a Roman Catholic in order to evade the prohibition of Jewish settlement in England.<br>
<br>Although no evidence of his activities before 1643 survives, by then he had married, had established a house and warehouse at Leadenhall Street, and had brought over many of his relatives to work for him in England. On 14 March 1643 he petitioned the House of Lords for payment for 300 barrels of gunpowder which he had shipped from Amsterdam, but which had been confiscated by Robert Rich, second earl of Warwick, for use by the parliamentary armies.<br>
<br>Carvajal was also very active in the bullion trade by that time, importing as much as &pound;100,000 per annum during the early 1650s, and thus made himself so indispensable to the parliamentary side that, when he was denounced as a recusant in 1645, a number of City merchants petitioned parliament to have the charge dropped, and the House of Lords soon put an end to the prosecution. Like many other very wealthy Jews during the early modern period Carvajal became an army purveyor, and in 1649 was one of the City merchants who were given the corn contract for the parliamentary forces. His reward came in July 1655 when Carvajal and his two sons were endenizened, thus making him the first English Jew since the expulsion in 1290. His becoming a British subject put his Spanish goods at risk, and Oliver Cromwell himself took extraordinary precautions to ensure that they could be spirited out of the country and sent to England.<br>
<br>Like other Marranos in London, Carvajal prayed at the Catholic chapel of the Spanish ambassador, while simultaneously playing a leading role in the secret Jewish community, which met at the clandestine synagogue at Creechurch Lane. Although he sat on the fence with the rest of London's Jews during the noisy campaign of Rabbi Manasseh ben Israel of Amsterdam to secure a public readmission of the Jews to England, eventually he was forced to show his hand. Spain's war with England in February 1656 put the Spanish subjects in the Jewish community at risk, and when the goods and ships of a fellow Marrano, Antonio Rodrigues Robles, were seized as belonging to an enemy alien Carvajal finally joined with Manasseh ben Israel and five others on 24 March 1656 in petitioning the protector for a formal statement permitting Jewish residence. In doing this, Carvajal and his colleagues finally threw off the disguise of Roman Catholicism, which by then must have worn very thin. The following February, Carvajal and Simon de Caceres successfully petitioned Cromwell to allow the Jews to lease a bit of land at Mile End for use as a cemetery.<br>
<br>Carvajal's character may perhaps be gauged from his actions in the summer of 1658 when &pound;15,000 worth of his logwood was seized by English customs off a Dutch vessel docked in London. Carvajal and his associates raided the warehouse, kidnapped the customs official, and liberated the logwood. The council of state was still examining the incident when Carvajal died in November 1659, according to Samuel Pepys after having been &#145;lately cutt (by the same hand with my selfe) of the Stone&#146;. He was buried in the new Jewish cemetery at Mile End, and the great bell of St Katharine Cree was rung in his honour. Carvajal was survived by his wife, Maria, and two sons: one of them became a broker on the exchange, but neither of them seems to have married.<br>
