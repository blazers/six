<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bywater,  Ingram</span>  (1840&#150;1914), <span class="occ">Greek scholar</span>, was born in Islington, London, on 27 June 1840, the only son of John Ingram Bywater (1812/13&#150;1864), a customs clerk, and his wife, Emma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marshall (<i>d</i>. September 1903). He was educated at private schools, University College School, London (1853&#150;6), King's College School, London, where he started Greek, and at Queen's College, Oxford, where he matriculated as a scholar in 1858.<br>
<br>As an undergraduate Bywater was the pupil of Jowett and Robinson Ellis, and the friend of Pater and Swinburne. He read and was influenced by Carlyle. His father generously supported his education, paying for private coaching by James Bryce and T. H. Green. He gained a first in classical moderations in 1860, and in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1862 (BA 1862, MA 1865). In 1863 he was elected to an open fellowship at Exeter College. As a young fellow he became a close friend of Mark Pattison and his accomplished wife [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32825/', "Dilke, Emilia Francis (1840&#150;1904)")</script>]; they influenced his attitudes. With them Bywater travelled on the continent, visiting many libraries and museums. Pattison collected early printed books, and Bywater's Sunday visits to his lodgings were presumably partly devoted to bibliography. Pattison was also an uncompromising advocate of scholarship, who alleged that the atmosphere of Oxford was inimical to study: &#145;a Fellowship is the grave of learning&#146;. Bywater's opinions were more moderate, and his manner of expression more conciliatory; but he stated that research was undervalued and undersupported at Oxford, and that the college tutorial system left too little time and initiative to the student or his teachers. He became a friend of William Morris and of Dilke, and was an early supporter of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (1877), who always lamented the effect in Oxford of the neo-Gothic revival.<br>
<br>During Bywater's twenty years as a tutor most of his time was spent teaching and on the studies for which he became famous. The publication in 1877 of his edition of the <span class="roman">Fragments of Heraclitus</span> won him an assured position in the world of European scholarship, and he was invited by the Prussian Academy of Sciences to edit the works of Priscianus Lydus (published 1886). He contributed to German journals and his relations with continental scholars, notably Professor Jacob Bernays, of Bonn, were cordial and fruitful. He travelled on the continent, but never visited Greece.<br>
<br>Charles Cannan used to say that though Bywater was doubtless an eminent Aristotelian, it was to be deplored that he had not become a bookseller, in which profession he must have been pre-eminent. Actually, he might have become librarian of the Bodleian. The curators, of whom Pattison was one, and Coxe, the veteran librarian, wanted him; and in 1879 he accepted, experimentally, the post of sub-librarian. He found the duties too irksome. He was expected routinely to read manuscripts and shrank from doing so: &#145;those who care for MSS. <i>per se</i> are usually dull dogs&#146;  (Jackson, 88). He resigned in 1880. He declined the headship of Exeter College, offered in 1887.<br>
<br>In 1884 Bywater was appointed to a new readership in Greek. On 19 August 1885 he married Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 17 Feb 1908), widow of Hans William Sotheby (<i>d</i>. 1874), formerly fellow of Exeter College, and daughter of Charles John Cornish of Salcombe Regis, from the well-known Devon family of Cornish; they had no children. She had ample means and varied accomplishments, literary and artistic. They lived in term-time at a &#145;very ordinary villa&#146;  (Jackson, 212) at 6 Norham Gardens, on the edge of the university parks, and in vacation at Mrs Bywater's London house, 93 Onslow Square, Kensington. This was Bywater's real home until his death; and there, with his wife's help, he gradually increased his remarkable collection of early classical books, on which he spent much.<br>
<br>In 1893 Jowett died, and Gladstone nominated Bywater, whose claims were supported by the testimony of German scholars, as regius professor of Greek. The popularizer and translator was thus succeeded by a scholar more purely scientific: Bywater's aim was &#145;the perfection of learning&#146;  (Jackson, 126). He occupied the chair until 1908. He continued to lecture, especially on Plato's <span class="italic">Republic</span> and Aristotle's <span class="italic">Poetics</span>. Those who believed college particularism or examination demands prevented the university from making the most of its professors noted that few undergraduates attended in the Schools lectures which formerly had crowded Exeter College hall.<br>
<br>Following his wife's death in 1908 Bywater resigned his professorship and retired to his London house. In 1909 he published the crowning labour of his Aristotelian studies, the monumental edition of the <span class="italic">Poetics</span>. Thereafter he undertook no large work of his own, but he continued to contribute occasional articles to the <span class="italic">Journal of Philology</span> (of which he had been an editor since 1879), and to help scholars by reading their proofs.<br>
<br>As an editor of Greek texts Bywater was the first of the English scholars of his generation. He had a wide familiarity with manuscripts, an unrivalled knowledge of the history of classical learning and the editorial art, and a fine sense of what he called the <i>Sprachgebrauch</i>. He added untiring industry and keen insight into the logical sequence of his author's thought. It has been objected to his interpretations of Aristotle that he was too much a grammarian and too little a philosopher; but this apparent limitation was due not to narrowness but to a considered scepticism. In the preface to the <span class="italic">Poetics</span> he reminds us &#145;that the very idea of a Theory of Art is modern, and that our present use of this term &#147;Art&#148; does not go further back than the age of Winckelmann and Goethe&#146;  (Jackson, 136). This was with oblique reference to the work on the <span class="italic">Poetics</span> of Samuel Henry Butcher, much of which Bywater regarded as irrelevant. In private he was more outspoken: &#145;You must not expect from me anything about fine art, for I don't think Aristotle said anything about it&#146;  (ibid., 136).<br>
<br>Scholars evaluating Bywater's published work have laid stress on the quality of its form, the laborious accuracy of his indexes, and the fine judgement which by a punctuation change clarified an obscure passage. But his editions of Heraclitus and Aristotle, and even the ampler commentary on the <span class="italic">Poetics</span>, reflect one side only of his vast learning and his catholic humanism. His profound veneration for Aristotle was untinged by superstition. His statement in 1914 to a <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> interviewer was characteristic: &#145;My chief works &hellip; have been on Aristotle, a philosopher who influences people to this day without their knowing it &hellip; It is astonishing how profound in some ways was Aristotle's knowledge of science&#146;  (Jackson, 199).<br>
<br>Much of Bywater's work was anonymous, and hardly known except to those who benefited by it. He was a delegate of Oxford University Press from 1879 until his death, and assiduous in reading manuscripts and proofs. His immense bibliographical knowledge and his practical wisdom were enough to assure him power and usefulness as a learned publisher; but on many scholarly enterprises he was not content to advise or to decide. He read with care the proofs of the <span class="roman">Oxford Classical Texts</span>, which he and Charles Cannan promoted, and guided the editors' critical methods. He contributed much to the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span> that would otherwise hardly have been found.<br>
<br>Bywater was president of the Oxford Aristotelian Society from its inception in the early 1880s until he left Oxford in 1908. Members met in his rooms weekly during term and construed and discussed one of Aristotle's more important writings. The knowledge and the methods inculcated had far-reaching influence on philosophical studies in Oxford.<br>
<br>In university politics Bywater was a liberal and reformer. He wanted examinations reduced and did not favour compulsory Greek in universities. To national and international affairs his attitude was sceptical; his values were conservative&#151;&#145;the vulgar radicalism of my youth&#146; was his own phrase&#151;and he had no illusions. He considered liberalism destructive, disliked democracy&#151;quoting Carlyle&#151;and disliked the influence of the United States, which he considered &#145;the great breeding-ground of popular crazes&#146;  (Jackson, 187). He was long acquainted with Joseph Chamberlain&#151;whom he referred to as Camerarius&#151;and favoured tariff reform. He had learned much from Germans, and had done much to introduce German scientific methods into English scholarship; but in later years he deplored the growing chauvinism which prevented Germans from admitting that they could learn anything from an English book.<br>
<br>Bywater was an expert bibliophile, &#145;a prince among bibliophiles&#146;  (Jackson, 161). The collection he bequeathed to the Bodleian Library, which there bears his name, is much more than a collection of rare and beautiful books. It is, as he himself wrote, &#145;a conspectus in its limited way of the literature of learning from the age of Bessarion to that of the Elenisgonoi of Scaliger and Casaubon&#146;; and it is also part of the work of a great humanist. He was generous in gifts of valuable books to individuals and institutions, and a benefactor of the Ashmolean Museum and Cambridge University Library. In his London home, surrounded by his books, Bywater was most himself. As one of his younger friends wrote:<blockquote>It was there that he was a great teacher. It was not merely that he was a master of his subject&#151;and of one's own; but one felt powerfully the stimulus of a temperament from which what may be called the casual impurities of intellectual life&#151;pedantry, hurry, irrelevance, pretentiousness, cleverness&#151;had been purged away.</blockquote>Admired as a great scholar, Bywater received honorary degrees from Cambridge, Dublin, and Durham, and foreign academic honours, and was one of the original fellows of the British Academy. He was of medium height with square shoulders, spoke with a &#145;never-to-be-forgotten lisp&#146;  (Jackson, 59), and smoked much, both a large pipe and cigars. He died at his home, 93 Onslow Square, London, on 17 December 1914, and was buried at Salcombe Regis, near Sidmouth, Devon, on 23 December.<br>
