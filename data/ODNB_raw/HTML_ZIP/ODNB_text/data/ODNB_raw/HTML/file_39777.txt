<span class="headword">Martin,  Josiah</span>  (1737&#150;1786), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born on 23 April 1737 in Dublin, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64973/', "Samuel Martin (1694/5&#150;1776)")</script>, a landowner and sugar planter in Antigua, and his second wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1748), the widow of William Irish and the daughter of Edward Wyke, governor of Montserrat. He grew up in Dublin and the London area, where his education, with tutors, was managed by his half-brother Samuel, a Pelhamite MP and London agent for Antigua, Montserrat, and Nevis. His adolescence in Antigua was painful, his widowed father frequently denouncing his &#145;indolence&#146; and &#145;mulish&#146; disposition  (BL, Add. MS 41346).<br>
<br>Early in the Seven Years' War Martin seized his father's approval for study at the Inner Temple as an opportunity to leave Antigua, and he then joined the 4th regiment of foot as an ensign; later he obtained a commission as lieutenant-colonel in the 22nd regiment of foot. According to his biographer, Martin became interested in colonial administration while serving in Canada. He drew on his father's espousal of efficiency, accountability, and humanitarian concerns as the basis of his new personal outlook and imperial perspective. In January 1761, while serving at Crown Point, New York, Martin married his cousin Elizabeth (Betsy) Martin (<i>d</i>. 1778), in defiance of his father's negotiations. Marriage into the New York gentry was consistent with his financial and political status, but he was disappointed in hoping for a New York political appointment. He succeeded only in keeping his wife (in his words) &#145;breeding sick&#146;. Having sold his commission, he remained at a loose end until 1770, when Samuel junior's efforts obtained him the governorship of North Carolina.<br>
<br>Pleased to have his foot on the ladder, Martin approached this lower rung with disdain and resignation. He delayed leaving New York and conferred with William Tryon, whose transfer to New York had made the North Carolina governorship available. Martin perceived that Tryon's departure involved face-saving, both for Tryon and for his and Martin's superiors, and he sensed an opportunity to pacify his troubled new charge.<br>
<br>Tryon had faced the regulator movement, a backcountry farmers' insurrection against the eastern North Carolina planter &eacute;lite. He had successfully led the colonial militia against the regulators, but the backcountry grievances of corrupt local government and legislative under-representation remained. Martin approached the regulators cordially and with an open mind. His challenge came from eastern leaders in the lower house, who moved to narrow the governor's field of political action. Regulator issues were in abeyance&#151;that is, until Martin's efforts to address them raised the eastern leaders' fears that backcountry hostility towards themselves would buttress the governor's political defences. In response, eastern leaders now courted former regulators. Thus Martin unintentionally brought regulator demands to the discussions with which his colony approached the American War of Independence.<br>
<br>Martin was handicapped from London and outmanoeuvred by his challengers, in particular Abner Nash and Cornelius Harnett, who aimed to take control over the proceedings of the lower house and then build public support for the house's authority. Their winning tactic was a foreign attachments clause, which they added to a court bill when the law establishing the colony's courts expired in 1773. Martin's instructions forbade his concurrence. He tried to gain approval for a foreign attachments clause, but he was insecure with London following the resignation in 1772 of his patron, the earl of Hillsborough. In August 1774 the speaker of the house convened a provincial congress composed of most of the assemblymen. Under mounting pressure, Martin withdrew from his New Bern residence in late May 1775 and installed his headquarters aboard the <i>Cruzier</i>, a sloop of war in the Cape Fear river.<br>
<br>There Martin worked steadily until May 1776, sending emissaries into the backcountry and among the highland Scots in the upper Cape Fear valley. He received messages and visits from loyalists throughout the southern backcountry and corresponded with Native American agents and neighbouring governors. Martin pleaded with the government for troops to support a proposed loyalist uprising, and in early 1776 his London dispatch informed him that a southern campaign was in preparation, with troops and arms <i>en route</i> from Ireland for the Cape Fear river.<br>
<br>By the time Martin received this news, the nature of the expedition had been altered without his being informed. His loyalists observed the original timetable. Their clash with revolutionary militia at Moore's Creek Bridge on 26 February 1776 was a fiasco. Martin joined a fleet from Boston in their unsuccessful attack near Charles Town, South Carolina. Soon he was at New York, where he remained until British forces returned to Charles Town, this time successfully, in May 1780. British planners approached the southern campaign of 1780&#150;81 on premises Martin had laid out in 1775: British troops occupying major ports and coastal areas, to be assisted by loyalists, largely in the interior, and by Native Americans. Martin accompanied the campaign's commander, Cornwallis, through the Carolinas, earning his trust and praise. Many of Martin's 1776 commissions remained active, and groups originating therein continued through 1783 in the Carolinas and East Florida.<br>
<br>Martin, widowed in October 1778, returned to his children at New York in 1781. His eldest child, Mary Elizabeth, remained with relatives on Long Island, but the others, Sarah, Alice, Samuel, Josiah Henry, and Augusta, had moved to London with him by 1782. Three other children had died. The family lived among sugar grandees and ranking civil servants near Grosvenor Square and Hanover Square and at an estate near Richmond, Surrey. Martin assisted loyalists who lodged compensation claims with the American loyalist claims commission. He estimated his own losses at &pound;6500, exclusive of perquisites, and the commissioners fixed the amount of his compensation at approximately &pound;3000. He received a governor's salary of &pound;1000 annually during the years 1775&#150;83. Martin died on 13 April 1786 and was buried at St George's, Hanover Square.<br>
<br>Martin undertook his office as governor as a stepping stone. He quickly became absorbed in colonial politics, however, and worked to reconcile the desire for greater representational and legislative integrity with imperial concerns. Once royal authority was usurped, his energetic formulation of a regional plan to displace the usurpers became the base-line of the British southern strategy.<br>
