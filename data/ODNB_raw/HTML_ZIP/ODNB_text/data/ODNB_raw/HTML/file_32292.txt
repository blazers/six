<span class="headword">Carlyle,  Benjamin Fearnley</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Aelred]</span>  (1874&#150;1955), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk</span>, was born at 8 Ashmount, Broomhill, Ecclesall Bierlow, a suburb of Sheffield, on 7 February 1874, the eldest of six children of James Fearnley Carlyle and Anna Maria Champion Kelly. He was baptized at St Mark's Church in the city on 13 March 1874, receiving the Christian names of his grandfather, a Church of England clergyman, one time rector of Badgeworth in Gloucestershire. His father was a railway engineer who worked in England and Argentina, but died unexpectedly when Carlyle was sixteen.<br>
<br>Carlyle entered St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, in 1892 as a medical student. But on his own confession &#145;most of my interest at St. Barts was given to the care of neglected cases of sick children instead of being concentrated on the actual work of taking my degree in medicine and surgery&#146;  (Carlyle, diaries, 3 Dec 1948). He wanted &#145;to help the poor lads in the slums&#146;  (ibid.). He also had an idea to revive the Benedictine order in the Church of England. He believed that the monastic system was &#145;the great solution of many social problems&#146;  (Carlyle to Green, 10 Sept 1897, Elmore Abbey Archives). He therefore made a personal profession to live according to the rule of St Benedict on 22 February 1892. His knowledge of monastic life was derived from visits to the Roman Catholic abbey of Buckfast in Devon. The prior, Benedict Gariador, gave him a copy of the rule. He read the life of the English Cistercian abbot, St Ailred, by J. D. Dalgairns, in 1893 and began calling himself Brother Aelred OSB. He joined a group of Church of England Benedictine oblates in Ealing and was chosen as their superior in 1894.<br>
<br>Carlyle's first attempt to found his own Benedictine community was in 1896 in the East End of London at Glengall Road, Isle of Dogs. There he kept open house for the poor and ministered to the local Boys' Brigade in a black habit. He moved to Lower Guiting in Gloucestershire in February 1898 to find a place &#145;where some of our poor lads might be sent&#146;  (Carlyle to Green, 8 Dec 1897). He wanted &#145;to lead the strict Religious life and train men for Rescue Work&#146;  (Carlyle to Green, 4 Dec 1897). Part of the divine office was recited in Latin from a monastic breviary, but the communal life was minimal. It all ended when an angry mob forced them out of the village.<br>
<br>Carlyle's second attempt began at Milton Abbas in Dorset in 1899, this time in white habits. He moved to Caldy Island off Pembrokeshire, where his seven disciples elected him their abbot on 23 February 1902. In the same year they all moved to Painsthorpe, on Lord Halifax's estate in Yorkshire. It was here that the community first established itself on a regular basis. Numbers passed double figures. A magazine called <span class="italic">Pax</span> was begun in 1904, to which Aelred contributed a &#145;Community letter&#146; fairly regularly, and other occasional pieces. An account of the community's ideals called &#145;Our purpose and method&#146; appeared under his name (1905&#150;6). He also got himself ordained in America by C. C. Grafton, bishop of Fond du Lac, on 15 November 1904.<br>
<br>He returned in triumph to Caldy in 1906. With little money but great enthusiasm he now embarked on an elaborate building programme for a monastery of the purely contemplative life. Only a few of the buildings planned by his architect, J. Coates Carter, were ever completed. They were described as &#145;exotic and eclectic and quite without parallel&#146;  (Anson, 159). Aelred devised an equally elaborate liturgy, based on monastic ritual, with many modern Roman Catholic feasts and practices, but with devotions of his own. For a period between 1906 and 1913 Caldy became a focus of public attention. Anglo-Catholics flocked to the island. The young Ronald Knox came for his ordination retreat and stayed eleven weeks. He described Caldy as having &#145;something of fairyland about it&#146; and Aelred as the &#145;magician who had called all this into being, as with a stroke of Prospero's wand&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pax</span>, 277, 1956, 31). But others questioned his position as an abbot and even as a validly ordained minister in the Church of England. Aelred argued that Frederick Temple, archbishop of Canterbury, had approved of his vocation and enterprise from the beginning; but he also claimed that Caldy was extra-diocesan and that he was free to do as he wished.<br>
<br>In order to regularize his position in the Church of England Carlyle invited Charles Gore, bishop of Oxford, to carry out a visitation. Gore, however, laid down a number of conditions before formal accession to the Church of England would be possible. Aelred replied on behalf of the community in February 1913 that &#145;we can not conscientiously submit to the demands you make of us&#146;  (Carlyle to Gore, 19 Feb 1913, Prinknash Abbey Archives). On 5 March he led nineteen of his monks into the Roman Catholic church.<br>
<br>Carlyle now had no status as a monk, priest, or abbot. He therefore went to the monastery of Maredsous in Belgium to begin a canonical noviciate. He completed it on 29 June 1914, a day after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo. He was informed of the news on the morning of his profession. He was ordained by the bishop of Namur on 5 July and returned to Caldy four days before the outbreak of the First World War. Although he was reinstalled as abbot of Caldy, the legal superior, appointed by Rome for ten years, was now Francis Mostyn, the bishop of Menevia. Financial and other difficulties forced Aelred to leave Caldy in 1920. He resigned the following year and began a new career as a priest in British Columbia. At Bear Creek, 1921&#150;30, he ministered to Okanagan Indians. In 1930 he was made parish priest of the mining town of Princeton. He still hankered after religious life. In 1933, therefore, he returned to Europe to enter the Carthusian noviciate at Miraflores near Burgos in Spain. On the way he stayed two days with his former community now at Prinknash Park in Gloucestershire. The Carthusian vocation did not materialize and he returned to Canada. In 1937 he moved to Vancouver and acted as prison chaplain to Okalla provincial gaol. In recognition of outstanding service there he received the freedom of the city of Vancouver on 1 May 1951.<br>
<br>On his retirement Carlyle accepted an invitation to settle with his former brethren at Prinknash. He was clothed in a white habit on arrival and was allowed to re-make his solemn vows privately on 3 November 1953. He died at St Teresa's Hospital, Corston, Somerset, on 14 October 1955 and was buried five days later under the high altar of the new abbey church at Prinknash.<br>
<br>At the time of Carlyle's death tributes were paid to his charm, his ability to fire young people with enthusiasm, and his greatest virtue, &#145;compassion for the unfortunate&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pax</span>, 277, 1956, 35). Ronald Knox, while admiring his enthusiasm, said that &#145;he was one of those men whose minds are too preoccupied to read the other man's thoughts in a conversation &hellip; It was not easy to tell Abbot Aelred things&#146;. Knox found a &#145;faint air of make-believe&#146; about the whole period at Caldy  (<span class="italic">Pax</span>, 215, 1940, 84). Peter Anson extended this criticism to other periods of Aelred's life. But there is no denying the solid achievements of his pastoral ministry&#151;and the community he created survived and prospered.<br>
<br>There are two biographies of Aelred based on personal knowledge. One, <span class="italic">Abbot Extraordinary</span>, is by Peter Anson, who was a member of the Caldy community. The other (unpublished) is by the Benedictine Michael Hanbury, who came to know Aelred well after his return to the community in 1951. The two works agree upon the facts of Aelred's life but differ sharply on the estimate of his character.<br>
