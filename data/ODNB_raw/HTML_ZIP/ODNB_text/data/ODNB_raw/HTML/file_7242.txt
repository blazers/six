<span class="headword">Davies <span class="st"> [Davis]</span>, Sir  John</span>  (1560<span class="mult">x</span>63&#150;1625), <span class="occ">administrator and conspirator</span>, was the son of John Davies of London. He was born in London about 6 a.m. on 8 February 1560 according to Anthony Wood; the precision suggests that Wood may have seen a copy of Davies's horoscope. An enemy later made much of (and no doubt quite likely exaggerated) Davies's humble origins. However, Davies's funeral monument, which recorded that he died in the sixty-third year of his life, suggests that he was born in 1562 or 1563. He was educated in &#145;grammaticals&#146; in London before being admitted to Gloucester Hall, Oxford, where his tutor was the mathematician and astrologer Thomas Allen  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.373). Gloucester Hall had a reputation as a centre for sheltering church papists nominally conforming to the Church of England, and Davies later owned that Allen had instructed him in the Catholic faith. He graduated BA on 1 July 1577 and proceeded MA on 4 July 1581, continuing at the college for a while thereafter. William Camden considered Davies &#145;an excellent mathematician&#146; and he reportedly wrote much on mathematics and astrology, none of which had survived by the late seventeenth century, and compiled with John Dee and Matthew Gwinne a volume of letters &#145;concernyng chymical and magical secrets&#146;  (ibid.). <br>
<br>Davies went to London, where he learnt more of astrology from Simon Forman. Their connection was parodied in the title of a pamphlet which appeared in 1590 at the time of the Marprelate controversy: <span class="italic">Sir Martin Mar-people: his collar of esses. Workmanly wrought by Maister Simon Sooth-saier, coldsmith of London. And offered to sale upon great necessitie, by John Davies</span>. In 1595 Davies spoke ill of Forman to the latter's mistress's husband and the following year Forman dreamed that Davies stood by watching while a crowd fired arrows at him. <br>
<br>In February 1588 Davies made his entrance at the royal court, where he seems soon to have come to the notice of the earl of Essex. He may already have embarked on a military career: in 1598 he claimed to have served four years in the Low Countries. In 1589 he served with Essex on the expedition to Portugal and may also have gone to France, as Wood claimed. Wood's comment, &#145;whereby he advanced his knowledge, as to men, and the languages of those countries very much&#146;, perhaps hints that Davies had an intelligence, as well as a military, role  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.374). He certainly served with Essex and his brother Walter Devereux in 1591 when they fought in Normandy in support of Henri of Navarre. He was at the taking of Cadiz in 1596, where he was one of thirty-three men knighted on 15 September by the earl. He was also on the expedition the following year to the Azores. About 1593 Davies married his first wife, the widow of Sir Henry Rowse of Devon. <br>
<br>By 1590 Davies had acquired a gunner's place at Sandown Castle. From there in November 1598 he wrote to Essex, then master of the ordnance, seeking the post of surveyor of the ordnance, the third place in the hierarchy of the department, &#145;the principal military storehouse in the kingdom&#146;, after the lieutenant and the clerk  (Ashley, &#145;War in the ordnance office&#146;, 338). To support his application he enclosed a three-page treatise &#145;On the perfection of artillery&#146;, together with<blockquote>some short collections of my former studies in artillery wherein if I had that practice as this place doth of necessity draw a man unto I would not doubt but in short time to discover the true effect of artillery more sufficiently than hitherto hath been by any of our nation. (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 8.440&#150;41)</blockquote>Davies was duly appointed surveyor on 31 January 1599 through the earl's offices. <br>
<br>Later that year Davies went &#145;as a prime officer&#146; with Essex to Ireland  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.374). The earl issued a warrant to the master of the ordnance in Ireland, Sir George Bouchier, to appoint Davies his lieutenant of the ordnance. Later, during Essex's brief lieutenancy of Ireland, Davies was also a factor of the purveyors of victuals for his forces. Davies and his superior Sir Robert Newcomen, the victualler-general for Ireland, were ordered to produce all books and reckonings, &#145;whereby Her Majesty may have a perfect knowledge and account of the matters of victuals in Ireland which now lies wrapped in the folds of much confusion&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1599&#150;1600</i>, 312). Davies accompanied Essex in his apparently unexpected return to England: leaving Dublin on 24 September 1599 they arrived at Nonsuch Palace, Surrey, four days later. Essex was suspended from all his offices, and bitter conflict ensued in the ordnance office where the lieutenant, Sir George Carew, hastened to fill key places with his clients, his kinsman George Harvey and Richard Palfreyman, to Davies's outrage. He physically ejected Palfreyman as being &#145;no officer&#146;, and in front of the lieutenant of the Tower rounded on Harvey as &#145;insolent and no deputy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 10.100&#150;01). <br>
<br>In the submissions to the committee of inquiry that followed, a flood of defects and frauds in the conduct of the officers of the ordnance was revealed, not to speak of the sea of mutually recriminatory allegations. Harvey described Davies as &#145;a shepstar's son, hatched in Gutter Lane&#146;&#151;that is, the son of a dressmaker, or indeed simply the woman who cuts cloth up for dressmaking&#151;and one &#145;who plots that no man shall serve her Majesty in the office but himself and such as depend upon him&#146;. Were not reforms undertaken, the queen could lose and yet again &#145;be deceived of almost 100,000<i>l</i>.&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 10.399). Legal proceedings and further enquiries were overtaken by the Essex conspiracy. <br>
<br>At the final planning meeting of 3 February 1601 Davies produced the most realistic of the various plans discussed for Essex's attempt to seize the court, the city of London, and the Tower, advising taking the Tower and its munitions at the outset, then carrying out a methodical plan to take the court. Sir Charles Danvers, Sir Christopher Blount, Sir Ferdinando Gorges, and their followers would be stationed at strategic points in Whitehall Palace and at a given signal would seize control and open the way for Essex to approach the queen and present a petition on behalf of himself and the realm. Gorges refused to co-operate and the earl of Southampton angrily dissolved the meeting. In the event the carefully contrived plan was replaced by an ill-organized and hot-headed escapade which misguidedly relied on Essex's popularity with the London citizenry but which ended in the earl's surrender and the siege of Essex House where Davies was left guarding the key government hostages, Lord Chief Justice Popham and Lord Keeper Egerton. The rebellion was over the day it began, 8 February 1601. <br>
<br>In the aftermath the authorities made much of Davies's Oxford past and of his Catholicism: &#145;that traitor knave Sir J. Davies, a conjuror and Catholic, who at Oxford occupied himself in the idle art of figure casting&#146;, according to Sir Robert Cecil, &#145;a traitor now in hold, brought up in Oxford, and by profession a setter of figures&#146; in the words of the official &#145;Directions for the preachers&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1598&#150;1601</i>, 555, 566). At his trial Davies owned that his early instruction in Catholicism at Oxford had been confirmed in Ireland by his fellow conspirator Sir Christopher Blount, carefully explaining (when Blount became angry at the claim) that this had been achieved by Blount's example rather than by any direct attempt at conversion. Davies was convicted and sentenced to death on 5 March 1601, but was subsequently pardoned and &#145;saved his life by telling first who was in the deepest&#146;  (Ashley, &#145;War in the ordnance office&#146;, 343&#150;4). Davies suffered but six months' imprisonment and was restored to his forfeited property in St Leonard Shoreditch in 1610, and in 1613 purchased the erstwhile monastic property of Bere Court in Pangbourne, Berkshire. <br>
<br>Controversy and suspicion continued to dog Davies. In 1610 he sought an act of parliament to restore him to the blood. His recusancy remained a cause of concern. The bill was lost in the Commons but not before it had been debated in the Lords. The bishop of St Asaph noted that he had heard Davies<blockquote>confess that when he was to die and was required to have a minister, he answered that he did willingly embrace the minister, but required to have a priest. So then he halted between two opinions. Since that time he hath continually refused to receive the sacrament &hellip; I think it is not fit to restore him to his own blood that refuseth to receive the Lord's blood. (Foster, <span class="italic">Proceedings</span>, 1.206)</blockquote>Other peers and bishops, including Cecil, were more sympathetic, seeing his promising signs in his willingness to come to Anglican church services and in his taking the oath of allegiance at a time when most recusants were refusing it. The bishop of London was all the more optimistic about Davies's conformity, &#145;because he is forward to finish the holy and good work of founding a college begun by Mr Wadham&#146;  (ibid., 1.207). <br>
<br>However, Davies's part in managing Wadham's trust for establishing an Oxford college led to bitter contention with Dorothy Wadham, the widow and executrix. Davies was possibly related to Nicholas Wadham through his second wife, Elizabeth White of Fiddleford, Dorset, whom he had married by 1609. Summoned to Wadham's deathbed in October 1609, he had induced him to make out an instrument making him jointly responsible with Dorothy for establishing the college, &#145;even in a manner at my husbondes last gaspe&#146;  (Briggs, 61). Accusations and counter-accusations of misappropriation of funds ensued. Angrily rebutting his charge that she was herself backward in the business, she bitterly complained that, &#145;his zeale is greater to compasse his owne endes, then benefit the Colledge&#146;  (ibid., 62). Davies perhaps intended to benefit the interests of Gloucester Hall as well as his own. He was excluded from the trust established in July 1610 under a collusive action in chancery directed against him. <br>
<br>Davies died at Bere Court on 14 May 1625. He was buried with his two wives in St James the Less, Pangbourne, where an elaborate tomb, &#145;large of grey stone, three recumbent effigies, coupled Tuscan columns left and right&#146;  (Pevsner), commemorates the Davies family. His son John succeeded as a minor; he also went to Gloucester Hall and was knighted in 1662. The manor at Pangbourne was sold in 1671.<br>
