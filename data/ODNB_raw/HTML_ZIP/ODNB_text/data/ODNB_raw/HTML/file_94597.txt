<span class="headword">Ogilvy, Sir  Angus James Bruce</span>  (1928&#150;2004), <span class="occ">businessman and philanthropist</span>, was born on 14 September 1928 at 47 Park Street, London, the second son of David Lyulph Gore Wolseley Ogilvy, seventh or thirteenth earl of Airlie (1893&#150;1968), and his wife, Lady Alexandra Marie Bridget, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Coke (1895&#150;1984), daughter of the third earl of Leicester. His family was steeped in Scottish history and royal service. The eleventh earl had been lord-in-waiting to George V and lord chamberlain to Queen Elizabeth, the queen mother; his older brother, who became eighth or fourteenth earl, was later lord chamberlain to Elizabeth II between 1984 and 1997. Ogilvy's boyhood was spent between London and Cortachy Castle, the family seat near Kirriemuir, Angus. He was educated at Heatherdown, near Ascot, Eton College, and Trinity College, Oxford. Between Eton and Oxford he did national service in the Scots Guards (1946&#150;8). He graduated from Oxford in philosophy, politics, and economics in 1950. Having left Oxford he was talent-spotted by Harley Drayton, the colourful City financier. For the next twenty-five years he was a successful businessman who focused on real estate and rose rapidly to become director and subsequently chairman of several Drayton companies. He impressed those with whom he worked not only by his personal charm but also by his quick grasp of the essence of business.<br>
<br>On 24 April 1963 Ogilvy married, at Westminster Abbey, Princess Alexandra of Kent (<i>b</i>. 1936), a first cousin of the queen and daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33371/', "Prince George, first duke of Kent")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34877/', "Princess Marina of Greece and of Denmark")</script>. They had two children: James and Marina. At the time of the marriage Ogilvy turned down the offer of an earldom and resolved to create by his own exertions sufficient income to enable the princess to live in the style for which her position called. As a first step he acquired a long lease of Thatched House Lodge in Richmond Park, which remained the family home throughout his life. Ogilvy and the princess entertained formally and informally both there and at their grace-and-favour apartment in St James's Palace through forty-one years of a very happy marriage.<br>
<br>In the early 1960s an ugly cloud began to descend on Ogilvy's business life. In 1961 he was sent by Drayton to southern Africa with the aim of reviving the London and Rhodesian Mining and Land Company (then L and R, subsequently renamed Lonrho). On this trip he met a charismatic Anglo-German entrepreneur, R. W. (Tiny) Rowland, and became convinced of Rowland's ability to rescue and develop Lonrho. Ogilvy persuaded his Drayton colleagues and it was agreed that Lonrho would acquire Rowland's company, Shepton Estates, in return for which Rowland received 1.5 million Lonrho shares. In this deal Ogilvy also received a block of Lonrho shares. Rowland deployed his magic on Lonrho and received appropriate applause. However, his aggressive business tactics and boardroom duplicity also increasingly upset the City establishment. The last straw was an accusation of breaking sanctions which had been imposed on Rhodesia following the country's unilateral declaration of independence in 1965. The resulting malaise rumbled on for several years in the course of which Ogilvy distanced himself gradually, but perhaps not sufficiently, from Rowland and Lonrho. Though he stepped down from the boards of Lonrho's Rhodesian subsidiaries he did not resign as a director of the company&#151;despite private advice to do so&#151;until April 1973.<br>
<br>Matters came to a head in July 1976 when inspectors appointed by the Department for Trade and Industry accused Ogilvy (and other directors) of negligence in the performance of his non-executive duties and of weakness and indecision in his business relationship with Rowland. Arcane rules prevented Ogilvy from defending himself although in late 1977 the director of public prosecutions explicitly cleared him of wrongdoing. Nevertheless Ogilvy's links with Rowland had been sufficiently close for him to deem it wise to offer his resignation from the Drayton organization and all other boards on which he served. That this honourable gesture&#151;partly inspired by his wish not to embarrass the royal family&#151;was turned down by several of the companies concerned (while others, notably GEC and Sothebys, lost no time in inviting him to join their boards) proved that the corporate governance issues involved were in no way cast in stone. Indeed, the way the inspectors expressed their views in their report was strongly criticized at the time by the chairman of the London stock exchange, among others.<br>
<br>Following the Lonrho affair Ogilvy threw himself into philanthropic pursuits. However, rather than spread his commitment thinly over a variety of charities he chose one cause in which he believed passionately and which gradually became a full-time substitute for his previous commitment to business. The chosen charity was the Prince's Trust. This had its origins in the National Association of Youth Clubs (later known as Youth Clubs UK) which Ogilvy had chaired since 1964, and which by 1976 had amalgamated with the Prince of Wales's Youth Business Initiative and in 1988 became the Prince's Youth Business Trust. The charity's role was to create employment for tens of thousands of young unemployed people by giving them modest grants and loans with which to start their businesses, as well as guidance from volunteer businessmen and women on how to run and develop them. Under Ogilvy's leadership very large sums were raised from wealthy entrepreneurs and companies in the UK and abroad, whose interest Ogilvy encouraged with great success. In one single year (1988), that of the prince of Wales's fortieth birthday, Ogilvy raised the huge sum of &pound;80 million. He accomplished this by persuading government ministers, who little suspected what was in store, to match pound for pound the funds he planned to raise. He then surprised Whitehall with a bill for &pound;40 million, which was duly paid. In spite of his absorption in this task Ogilvy also found time for honorary activities with other charities such as Arthritis Care (of which he was president, 1963&#150;9), the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (president, 1964&#150;94), and the Leeds Castle Foundation, of which he became a trustee in 1975. He was also a liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths.<br>
<br>Ogilvy was a workaholic in business and philanthropy, often putting in a twelve-hour working day, lunching at his desk, and dictating letters until late at night. He placed great importance on personal interaction, handwriting innumerable letters on behalf of his causes, and infecting others with his natural enthusiasm. His down-to-earth and self-deprecating personality, coupled with more than a dash of worldliness, made him a stimulating companion&#151;unaffected, inquisitive, and helpful. In difficult situations his natural Scottish charm always came to the rescue. One such situation arose in 1990 when his daughter, Marina, who was then unmarried, became pregnant and gave an account of her family's reaction to a national newspaper. The happy outcome&#151;Marina and her partner were married and the family subsequently reconciled&#151;owed much to Ogilvy's calmness. Another notable occasion, illustrative of his ability to rise above events, occurred several days after the publication of the Department for Trade and Industry's report in 1976 when he and the princess made a scheduled appearance at a Youth Club event at London's Hilton Hotel. Ogilvy faced a battery of paparazzi when many people in similar circumstances would have excused themselves.<br>
<br>Ogilvy had been plagued by poor health since his time at Oxford, though he never let this interfere with his work nor his activities as a royal husband. Indeed, from the day he married and more particularly after his withdrawal from business, he accompanied Princess Alexandra on numerous foreign visits. One of his charming eccentricities, caused by the need to fight constant back pain, was riding a bicycle through London with an elegant briefcase strapped to the saddle. His attitude to health was mildly influenced by his early upbringing as a Christian Scientist, a religion to which both his parents were devoted, but which he himself gave up for the Church of England in his teens.<br>
<br>In 1989 the queen appointed Ogilvy KCVO and in 1997 he was sworn of the privy council, honours that drew a firm line under the events of the 1970s and demonstrated her support. Ogilvy suffered his final and very painful illness with enormous courage and continued to devote himself to menial tasks of fund-raising when others would have given up. After treatment for throat cancer he died on 26 December 2004 from pneumonia and cancer at Kingston Hospital, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, and was buried on 5 January 2005 at Frogmore burial ground, Windsor Home Park, after a funeral service in St George's Chapel, Windsor. He was survived by the princess and their two children.<br>
