<span class="headword">Cooper, Sir  (Thomas) Edwin</span>  (1874&#150;1942), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born at 44 Nelson Street, Scarborough, on 21 October 1874, the eldest child of Samuel Cooper, carriage proprietor, and his wife, Ann, daughter of Thomas Pickering, an agricultural labourer. Cooper's father died during his childhood, and his mother, recognizing his talent for drawing, encouraged him towards his future career. Cooper was articled to the architectural firm Hall and Tugwell in Scarborough from 1885 to 1889, and after further experience with W. Penty and Walter Brierley in York he went to London to Goldie, Child, and Goldie for a further two years. Cooper returned to Scarborough in 1893 with his friend and fellow pupil Herbert Davis to found a practice as Hall, Cooper, and Davis with John Hall, an older architect in the town. On 14 July 1898 Cooper married Mary Emily (<i>b</i>. 1873/4), the daughter of Henry Wellburn, merchant of Scarborough; they had a son and a daughter. Hall, Cooper, and Davis opened a London office in 1895, but local commissions in the north gave Cooper a good start, and included in Scarborough Westwood higher grade school (1897) and Scarborough College, Filey Road (1898). These were eclectic brick buildings, showing signs of Brierley's controlled Romanticism. Cooper travelled in France and Italy, and expressed admiration for the works of Baldassare Peruzzi and Michele Sanmicheli, both of whom were generally admired by Edwardian leaders of revived classicism. <br>
<br>In 1903 Cooper became a fellow of the RIBA, and became a partner of Samuel Bridgeman Russell until 1910, when he set up on his own. By then Cooper had consolidated his technique for competition designs for large public buildings. In 1905 John Belcher selected his design for the rebuilding of Hull Guildhall, on an awkward narrow site, and the building was constructed, faced in Portland stone, between 1906 and 1914. Its emphatic horizontals of cornice and basement enclose an engaged Corinthian colonnade, which became one of Cooper's hallmarks. The terminal piers of the building are crowned with baroque sculptural groups by Albert Hemstock Hodge. Russell and Cooper's design for the County Hall competition in London was similar in mood, and Cooper was among a small group of architects who formed the Classical Society, chiefly in protest against the assessors' selection of Ralph Knott. The centrepiece from this design reappeared in the winning scheme by Cooper for the Port of London Authority's new headquarters on Tower Hill in 1912. His elevational style had by then turned towards the currently fashionable American-influenced Beaux-Arts movement, with &#145;neo-Grec&#146; detailing. Cooper became the favourite architect of Hudson Kearley, first Viscount Devonport, the chairman of the authority, who brought him many later commissions, including the port facilities at Tilbury, where Cooper designed the fine baggage hall (1921&#150;2), whose simple interior achieved a genuine Roman grandeur. <br>
<br>On the completion of the Port of London Authority building, Cooper was knighted in 1923. Contemporaries praised the efficiency of his planning, the tight control of the construction, and the rich ornamental detail of the main rooms. Sir Aston Webb, who had assessed the competition, wrote that it &#145;contains many novel features of plan which will make it a model for buildings of this class in the future&#146;  (Webb to Lord Devonport, 17 Sept 1917, RIBA BAL, Cooper MSS, CoE 1/3). C. H. Reilly described it as &#145;a very bold attempt by a brave man to use Roman baroque architecture to express the majesty of our present day commerce&#146;  (<span class="italic">Country Life</span>, 14 Oct 1922, 465). That such an attempt had not fully succeeded was tacitly admitted even by one of Cooper's greatest admirers, A. E. Richardson, in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, where he wrote:<blockquote>Had the Edwardian period been truly receptive of the classic point of view, it is possible that a return to the qualities of eighteenth-century architecture would have followed. Scholarship, grace, and general culture, however, were lacking, and no individual architect, however earnest, could hope to make up for these deficiencies in his own work.</blockquote>Cooper's Marylebone town hall, also won in competition in 1911, was joined in 1937 by the public library next door, in a slightly simplified style. In the City of London, Cooper designed offices for the Banque Belge, Bishopsgate (1919; now dem.) and for Spillers Ltd in St Mary Axe (1922&#150;3). In 1925 Cooper was commissioned by Lloyds of London to build their new headquarters in Leadenhall Street (completed 1928). The design problem involved planning on an awkward site to an unusual brief. Lloyds itself occupied the back part of the site, with only a small frontage on Leadenhall Street, although the remainder of the street elevation was soon redeveloped by Cooper as Royal Mail House. He composed an entrance front with a pediment and clever use of relief planes and sculpture, which led down a long corridor to the &#145;Room&#146;, the large open floor space where the business of Lloyds is traditionally transacted, around the central feature of the Lutine bell, which Cooper housed in a wooden Greek revival structure. This, together with the original Leadenhall Street fa&ccedil;ade, is the only piece of Cooper's work to have survived the redevelopment of the site 1981&#150;5. Lloyds was decorated with ceiling paintings by William Walcot (who also drew many perspectives of Cooper's buildings) and Fred Taylor. Cooper's last major City building, on a prominent corner site facing the Mansion House, was the National and Provincial Bank, Princes Street, a Renaissance-style palazzo building with a grand Corinthian order. <br>
<br>After an initial design by Giles Gilbert Scott had been rejected as impractical, Cooper offered his services free for the Star and Garter Home (for war veterans) on Richmond Hill (1921&#150;5), conceived in a Wren-like mixture of red brick and Portland stone. His obituarist in <span class="italic">The Times</span> complained that it &#145;comes perilously near to a vulgarisation of the tradition of Wren. There is a relationship between style and scale to which Cooper appeared to be insensible&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 June 1942). Cooper became a specialist in medical and hospital buildings, several of which were funded by his big business patrons, such as Lord Devonport. He worked at St Thomas's Hospital, St Mary's, and the Dreadnought Seamen's Hospital. He also designed buildings at Cranleigh School, Bryanston, and Bedales. Cooper's small domestic <i>&#339;uvre</i> is understated and cold in character. <br>
<br>Cooper was elected ARA in 1930 and RA in 1937. He was treasurer of the Royal Academy and in this role succeeded in attracting financial support. He also participated in the formation of the Royal Academy plan for London during the war, and succeeded Sir Edwin Lutyens as president of the Incorporated Association of Architects and Surveyors, a rival body to the RIBA, in 1937. He refused to pay the standard fee to the Architects' Registration Council, on its establishment in 1933, and was therefore technically not legally entitled to the designation of architect. <br>
<br>A. E. Richardson wrote in appreciation that<blockquote>From the three-dimensional standpoint, Cooper's buildings are models of ingenuity. Everything seems to be combined within a small compass; both deep below ground and soaring skywards. The aim was to produce comprehensive perspective effects internally and rigid academic symmetry externally. (<span class="italic">DNB</span>)</blockquote>Cooper's reputation did not last well in the post-war climate of modernism, and his work has none of the appeal which led to a revival of interest in Lutyens, even though most of his buildings survive and give good service. His chief assistant, Terence Heysham, continued the practice and built a new &#145;Room&#146; for Lloyds in Lime Street (1950&#150;57). <br>
<br>Details of Cooper's personal character and private life are hard to find. His <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary described him as &#145;a pink-faced, silver-haired man of episcopal appearance&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 June 1942). When receiving the royal gold medal for architecture in 1931, Cooper said, &#145;I oftimes think that the less an architect has to say on any matter where he is concerned personally the better&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 6 March 1931, 440). His friends often urged him to work less hard for the sake of his health. He died of a heart attack while at work at 4 Verulam Buildings, Gray's Inn, London, on 24 June 1942. His wife survived him.<br>
