<span class="headword">Pertz,  Dorothea Frances Matilda <span class="st"> [Dora]</span></span>  (1859&#150;1939), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born in London on 14 March 1859, the third and youngest daughter of Georg Heinrich Pertz (1795&#150;1876), royal librarian in Berlin, and his second wife, Leonora Horner (<i>b</i>. 1818). There were three half-brothers, married with children, from her father's first marriage. Dora Pertz (as she was usually called) could claim scientifically distinguished antecedents in that her maternal grandfather was Leonard Horner, geologist, antiquary, and friend of Charles Darwin. Her aunts Mary, Katherine, and Frances Horner were married to Charles Lyell, Henry Lyell, and Charles James Fox Bunbury, respectively, and the two remaining aunts, Susan and Joanna Horner, wrote and travelled widely. All these Horner women, including her mother, had active intellectual lives, studying plants, shells and minerals, writing, translating, editing, and helping their menfolk with their researches. Her father was, moreover, a distinguished historian with a wide acquaintance among European literary scholars of the day, the author of <span class="italic">Monumenta Germanica</span> and editor of Leibniz's papers (1843&#150;63). Dora Pertz remembered meeting these relations and other notable figures as a girl.<br>
<br>Dora Pertz's early life in Berlin was punctuated by annual visits to England. When her father died in 1876 she moved with her mother to Florence. In 1882 she entered Newnham College, Cambridge, where she sat Cambridge higher local examinations. The following year she interrupted her studies to spend time in Italy, returning to Cambridge late in 1884 for another year in which she took part one of the natural sciences tripos. When titular degrees for women were allowed she made up the required time with a final period of residence (1917&#150;18), eventually graduating MA in 1932. At Newnham she showed great ability in botany and soon was introduced to Francis Darwin, a university reader in botany. The introduction was probably made through Ellen Wordsworth Crofts, lecturer at Newnham and Darwin's wife from 1883. Pertz subsequently settled in Cambridge and became one of a small group of women on the fringes of professional science in the early years of the twentieth century. She researched plant physiology under Francis Darwin and taught botany at Newnham, although never formally appointed either at the college or the university's botany school. Her researches mostly supplemented Francis Darwin's work on water movements in plants, and from 1892 to 1900 she published five papers jointly with him. The best known is on plant rhythms, delivered at the British Association in 1891 and published in <span class="italic">Annals of Botany</span>. She produced two short papers in her own right, including one on gravitational effects on plants. She also worked for William Bateson for a while from 1895, a connection again facilitated through the Newnham network, and in 1900 co-authored a paper with him on the inheritance of variations.<br>
<br>In 1905 Dora Pertz was elected fellow of the Linnean Society in the first group of women to be admitted, although the struggle for admittance was orchestrated by others. For this, and indeed for much of her career, she was indebted to Francis Darwin, who actively pushed for recognition of her merits. Like several of his scientific contemporaries, Darwin liked to gather intelligent female researchers around him. After Darwin's retirement, Dora Pertz continued to experiment on plants but eventually abandoned her researches. Her friend Edith Saunders said this was due to disappointing results with germinating seeds  (<span class="italic">Proceedings of the Linnean Society</span>, 151, 1938&#150;9, 246), although Agnes Arber claimed instead that botany was getting too mathematical for her  (<span class="italic">Nature</span>, 143, 1939, 590). Either way, Frederick Blackman enlisted her services in cataloguing pamphlets held at the botany school, followed by indexing and abstracting papers from German journals. The magnitude of the task was very great and Saunders afterwards felt Pertz's achievement was insufficiently appreciated. At this time in her life Pertz also provided illustrations of floral anatomy for Saunders's important text on that topic.<br>
<br>During the First World War Dora Pertz trained as a masseuse in order to work at St Chad's Roman Catholic convalescent hospital in Cambridge, and her charitable work continued quietly afterwards. She was ill for several years before her death in Cambridge on 6 March 1939. She was cremated in Cambridge on 9 March and her ashes buried in Brookwood cemetery, Surrey.<br>
