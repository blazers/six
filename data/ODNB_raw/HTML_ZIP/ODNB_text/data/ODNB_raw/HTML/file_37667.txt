<span class="headword">Leslie,  Henry David</span>  (1822&#150;1896), <span class="occ">composer and conductor</span>, was born in London on 18 June 1822, the fourth of nine children (five sons and four daughters), and the first son to survive infancy, of John Leslie, a fashionable tailor and keen amateur viola player, and his wife, Mary Taylor. He was educated at the Palace School, Enfield, before unenthusiastically joining the family firm. A lugubrious looking, bespectacled, and later whiskery young man, he began musical studies in his mid-teens, studying the cello with Charles Lucas. He later played the cello at the Sacred Harmonic Society concerts.<br>
<br>In 1840 Leslie published his op. 1, a <span class="roman">Te Deum</span> and <span class="roman">Jubilate</span> in D. In 1848 his symphony in F was performed by the prestigious Amateur Musical Society under Michael Balfe. His anthem &#145;Let God arise&#146; was first performed at the Norwich festival of 1849: Charles Lucas called it &#145;the best antiphonal work since the days of Handel&#146;, and <span class="italic">The Times</span> found in it &#145;gifts that are accorded to few&#146;. The next decade saw a dramatic overture, <span class="italic">The Templar</span>, the oratorios <span class="italic">Immanuel</span> (1854) and <span class="italic">Judith</span> (1858), and some chamber music. The <span class="italic">Birmingham Gazette</span> hailed <span class="italic">Judith</span> as a &#145;great work&#146;, but the second part of <span class="italic">Immanuel</span> contains probably the finest music Leslie wrote. About the same time came two cantatas, <span class="italic">Holyrood</span> (1861) and <span class="italic">Daughter of the Isles</span> (1862), and two works given at Covent Garden: the operetta <span class="italic">Romance, or, Bold Dick Turpin</span> (1860) and the romantic opera <span class="italic">Ida, or, The Guardian Storks</span> (1865). The only major late work was a programmatic second symphony, <span class="italic">Chivalry</span>, first performed in 1881 at the Crystal Palace. He edited <span class="italic">Cassell's Choral Music</span> (1867) and other collections of early partsongs.<br>
<br>In 1857 Leslie married one of his pupils, Mary Betsy, the daughter of William Henry Perry, a physician, and moved to her family home, Bryn Tanat, Llansanffraid, near Oswestry on the Welsh border. They had four sons and one daughter. The second son, William, became a master of the Musicians' Company, and the third, Charles, played cricket for Middlesex and England.<br>
<br>In 1847 Leslie became honorary secretary of the newly founded Amateur Musical Society, and from 1855 its conductor. He had also taken charge of a madrigal society which performed in the Hanover Square Rooms and which from May 1856 was known as Henry Leslie's Choir. A basic group of about thirty singers swelled on some orchestral occasions to 240, and over three decades gave several London concerts each year, prepared with a care for detail unique in Britain at the time, though its effects were later attacked as too calculated, even &#145;effeminate&#146;, and many regretted the drift from a pure partsong repertory to grandiose &#145;mixed concerts&#146; with popular soloists. Leslie wrote a hundred or so partsongs for the choir, including &#145;O memory&#146;, &#145;The pilgrims&#146;, and &#145;Annabelle Lee&#146;, which became best-sellers.<br>
<br>By the late 1870s Leslie (and many critics) felt that some of his singers were &#145;becoming a little ropy&#146; and that he himself was tired and stale. A final triumph came at the Paris Exhibition of 1878, where he and Arthur Sullivan organized the British musical element, and Leslie's choir won first prize in the international choral competition. Two years later, after a command performance at Windsor Castle, he disbanded it, and although it was revived at public request under Albert Randegger, with Leslie as president and later conductor (1885&#150;7), and attracted such stars as Charles Santley, it was finally disbanded in 1887.<br>
<br>In 1864 Leslie realized a long-held ambition in setting up a National College of Music, in Piccadilly, to rival the continental conservatories. Although Sullivan, Julius Benedict, and other prominent musicians were among the professors, it collapsed after only two years. A second attempt (in 1878) led to the foundation of the Royal College of Music in 1883. Leslie was always interested in the training of village choirs, and in retirement he launched the Oswestry Festival of Village Choirs, which absorbed him for some years until underfunding brought it to an end. He died on 5 February 1896 at Boreatton Park, Baschurch, Shropshire, after several years of ill health, and was buried in Llanyblodwel churchyard. He was survived by his wife.<br>
