<span class="headword">Smith,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1734, <em>d.</em> 1803), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company and politician</span>, was baptized on 15 May 1734 at St Mary's, Marlborough, Wiltshire, the eldest son of John Smith, a cheesemonger, of Jermyn Street, London. His social origins and allegedly poor education were sometimes to be held against him in later life. He arrived in India as a purser's mate on an East Indiaman in 1752, and on 9 December 1752 was commissioned ensign in the East India Company's Madras army, at a time when the council was desperate for &#145;gentlemen&#146; to officer its rapidly growing army. He was made lieutenant a year later (2 November 1753), captain on 2 June 1756, and major in 1760, following the seniority principle which governed promotion in the company's armed forces. On 25 September 1756 Smith had married Amelia, daughter of Captain Charles Hopkins, a master mariner and later Madras civil servant. They had a son and a daughter. The Carnatic, in south-eastern India, was in a state of discontinuous warfare during these years, largely due to competition between the British and French for the dominance of the province. Smith saw active service throughout, obviously recommending himself to his military superiors, for he was given independent commands of forts and detachments, and in 1758 acted as aide-de-camp to Colonel Stringer Lawrence, the commander-in-chief.<br>
<br>Smith was quick-tempered and haughty, but his disarming candour got him out of a number of scrapes. His experience as a purser's mate and his marriage alliance to a merchant family might also have reflected business talents (certainly they suggest business connections); unusually for a Carnatic officer, he amassed a fortune in the 1750s, perhaps by trade but also through the favourite financial method of many Madras Europeans, who lent money to Muhammad Ali, the nawab of Arcot, at 25 per cent per annum. Clearly also, Smith's political skills and forceful personality had impressed his colleagues and fellow creditors, for he was later appointed their unofficial spokesman in London, charged with securing their financial interests. The nawab, bypassing the enraged directors, entrusted Smith with a letter to the king seeking George III's intercession to get him a better deal with the company.<br>
<br>Smith remained in London until 1764, becoming a prominent member of the company's court of proprietors (shareholders) during the great struggle between Robert Clive and Laurence Sulivan for control of the East India Company (he started in the Clive camp, but ended up a supporter of Sulivan). This, and recognition of his military talents, secured him a royal commission as colonel in the East (11 May 1764) and the appointment to command one of the company's three brigades in the reorganized Bengal army under Clive, the new governor. Smith again fell out with Clive on the voyage out to India, but remained loyal to him during the notorious 1766 &#145;white mutiny&#146; of Bengal officers protesting against the governor's military reforms. None the less, Clive admonished him for his &#145;great ambition and desire to command those who should command you&#146;  (Clive to Smith, 15 Feb 1766, NL Wales, Clive MS 224, fols. 57&#150;60). On Clive's resignation in 1767, his unique appointment combining the roles of governor and active commander-in-chief in Bengal was split between the next senior civil servant, Harry Verelst, a rather weak man, and Smith, now promoted brigadier-general.<br>
<br>Bengal was quiet during Smith's command of the army (1767&#150;70), though there were some alarms that the Afghans intended invading and various schemes for the further military and political penetration of northern India by the company. Smith was enthusiastic both for fighting the Afghans outside company-controlled territory, and for putting the wandering Mughal emperor Shah Alam II back on the throne in Delhi; he probably received a substantial monetary reward from the grateful emperor for espousal of his cause. Clive, back in Britain, warned a director of the company that Smith &#145;will project distant Conquests and every thing else which Pride and Ambition like his can suggest&#146;  (Clive to Thomas Rous, 20 Oct 1767, NL Wales, Clive MS 58, fols. 47&#150;8). Privately, Smith admitted he was bent on &#145;transmitting his name to Posterity&#146;  (Smith to Robert Orme, April 1767, BL OIOC, Orme MS OV 37, fols. 118&#150;19). The Calcutta council's rejection of both these proposals helped provoke a bitter and prolonged dispute between Smith and Verelst over the respective spheres of their authority. Both men eventually resigned and returned to Britain in 1770.<br>
<br>Back in London&#151;allegedly with between &pound;200,000 and &pound;300,000 in his pocket&#151;Smith plunged into East India Company and parliamentary politics, living in Harley Street and buying a country seat, Chiltern Lodge, near Hungerford, Berkshire, and becoming high sheriff of that county in 1779. He made such a flamboyant and arrogant entry into society that he became one of the most notorious of the &#145;nabobs&#146;, the <i>nouveaux riches</i> East India Company servants who flung their money around to the great resentment and contempt of &#145;old wealth&#146;. It was said that he was the model for Sir Matthew Mite in Samuel Foote's lampooning play <span class="italic">The Nabob</span> (1772); he was also the subject of an attack, complete with the only known likeness of him, in one of the &#145;T&ecirc;te &agrave; T&ecirc;te&#146; portraits in the <span class="italic">Town and Country Magazine</span>, opposite <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47472/', "Mrs Elizabeth Armitstead")</script>  (no. 20, 1776, 34), and, later, of a hostile spoof entitled <span class="italic">A Vindication of General Richard Smith</span> (1783) by Joseph Price. Smith became a prominent man of the turf, running racehorses and belonging to the Jockey Club; he also lost a fortune at the gaming table (&pound;180,000, it was said, to Charles James Fox).<br>
<br>Smith's recklessness extended to his parliamentary career. He provoked rage by trying to buy his way into the Shoreham constituency in November 1770, and in 1774 he was disqualified, fined, and gaoled for six months for buying votes to win the election for the seat of Hindon in Wiltshire. He tried other seats before eventually getting into parliament for Wendover in 1780, by purchasing the borough's two seats from Lord Verney (the other went to his son). Speaking ably on Indian issues, Smith made enough noise from the opposition benches to be made chair of the commons select committee on East India affairs in 1781. Burke commented that its seventh report &#145;owed the greatest part of its merit to the General &hellip; and did him infinite honour&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1754&#150;90</span>, 450). Smith lost his seat in 1784 as one of &#145;Fox's Martyrs&#146;, and, deprived of parliamentary immunity, he had to sell his estate and flee abroad to escape his creditors. He returned to England in 1786, and to parliament, as MP for Wareham, Dorset, in 1790. He contributed regularly to debates on India, on which he supported government policy, although he was otherwise in opposition. He became a prominent critic of the ministry's war policy against France after 1794, and of its measures to cope with corn price fluctuations at home. He spoke, among other issues, on the abuse of child labour in factories, but supported the slave trade. Smith did not seek re-election in 1796 and, with his finances partly restored to health, died seven years later, on 3 July 1803.<br>
