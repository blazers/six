<span class="headword">Spearman,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1703, <em>d.</em> 1761), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, was baptized at St Mary-le-Bow, Durham, on 4 March 1703, the eldest son of Robert Spearman (1657&#150;1728), attorney, of the city of Durham, and his wife, Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1737), daughter of William Webster, merchant, of Stockton-on-Tees. He was educated at Durham School and matriculated from Corpus Christi College, Oxford, as a gentleman commoner, on 2 June 1720 but seems to have left in spring 1723 without having taken a degree.<br>
<br>Spearman lived a retired life on his estate, Old Acres, in the large parish of Sedgefield, co. Durham, where, as his epitaph records, he &#145;employed the leisure and abilities which God had given him in the study of His Word and His Works&#146;. He was one of the first followers of the physico-theologian John Hutchinson, whose brief life he wrote and whose complete works he co-edited in twelve volumes (published 1748) with his friend the Revd Julius Bate. Spearman's own two books explained his belief that Hutchinson had a unique key to knowledge. His <span class="italic">Enquiry after Philosophy and Theology</span>, published anonymously in 1755, contained an attack on the perceived contemporary primacy of natural religion that had resulted in Christianity's being in a &#145;cool and lukewarm state&#146;  (p. 402); a repetition of the Hutchinsonian belief that Trinitarian unity is demonstrated in the combination of fire, light, and spirit; and a sustained engagement with some of Sir Isaac Newton's published writings. Spearman concluded with a plea to his readers to look to Hutchinson, where &#145;they will, to their inexpressible satisfaction, both as Christians and men of sense, find the scriptures made one, uniform, compleat system of theology and philosophy, consistent with themselves and nature&#146;  (p. 424). His last major work, <span class="italic">Letters to a Friend Concerning the Septuagint Translation and the Hebrew Mythology</span> (1759), was a defence of the Hutchinsonian approach to scripture and a plea for the accuracy and stability of the existing printed Hebrew text of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> against revisers like Kennicott, for here was &#145;the original record, the <i>Magna Charta</i>, as I may call it, of our eternal inheritance&#146;  (R. Spearman, <span class="italic">Letters to a Friend</span>, 1759, 371). He also made further attacks on natural religion and argued that &#145;Paganism was nothing else but the <i>great truths</i> of Christianity split and debased into a legend of fables, such as we meet with in their mythology&#146;  (ibid., 151).<br>
<br>Spearman was genuinely learned and had some gift for popularizing and shaping Hutchinsonian thinking. He introduced it to many clergy and laity in the north east of England and was respected both for his adherence to the master's views and his willingness to listen to the reservations held by those who could not enter &#145;into all the depths of the Hutchinsonian philosophy&#146;  (Surtees, 3.398). These included his friend Dr Thomas Sharp, archdeacon of Northumberland, who dedicated his <span class="italic">Two dissertations concerning etymology &amp; scripture-meaning of the Hebrew words Elohim and Berith</span> (1751) to Spearman and saluted his &#145;moderation and candour&#146;  (Sharp, iv).<br>
<br>Spearman married, first, Mary Lewen, who died on 18 March 1748, aged forty-two, and, second, Ann (<i>b</i>. 1725/6, <i>d</i>. 1821), the daughter of Robert Sharp (or Sharpe), gentleman, of Hawthorn, co. Durham. He died on 20 October 1761 and was buried on 30 October at Sedgefield parish church, leaving five daughters as coheirs. His widow survived him for almost sixty years; she died in Durham, and was buried at Sedgefield on 24 August 1821, aged ninety-five.<br>
