<span class="headword">Wiffen,  Benjamin Barron</span>  (1794&#150;1867), <span class="occ">biographer</span>, the second son of John Wiffen (1761&#150;1802), ironmonger, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pattison (1761&#150;1841), was born at Woburn, Bedfordshire, on 28 October 1794. His elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29362/', "Jeremiah Holmes Wiffen (1792&#150;1836)")</script>, whom he followed to the Friends' school, Ackworth, near Pontefract, in 1803. On leaving in 1808 he went into his father's business, and remained in it at Woburn until 1838, when his health failed, and he subsequently retired to Mount Pleasant, near Woburn, with his widowed mother and unmarried sisters. His literary interests were encouraged by his brother and by Richard Thomas How of Aspley Guise, Bedfordshire, the owner of a remarkable library.<br>
<br>Early in 1840 Luis de Usoz y R&iacute;o, already interested in the Quakers and in Jeremiah Wiffen (now dead) as a translator of Spanish poetry, arrived in London from Italy and was introduced by George Borrow to Josiah Forster. At Forster's request Wiffen called on Usoz y R&iacute;o in Jermyn Street. There at once sprang up a lifelong friendship between them, and &#145;henceforward Spain took entire possession&#146; of Wiffen. Late in 1840 or early in 1841 he made his first visit there with George William Alexander (a fellow Quaker and first treasurer of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society) as a deputation to forward the abolition of the slave trade; in 1842 he accompanied Alexander a second time to Spain and Portugal. In 1843 or 1844 Usoz wrote to Wiffen of his plan to recover and republish long lost and long prohibited works by sixteenth-century Spanish religious writers of a broadly Reformation character, and to seek Wiffen's help in this task. Now Wiffen began his book-hunting, of which he gives a most interesting account in his &#145;Notices and experiences&#146;. He obtained some unique treasures, both in Britain and from the continent. Many rare works he himself copied line for line; of others he obtained transcripts. All was done to assist Usoz, and without his aid the collection of <span class="italic">Reformistas antiguos espa&ntilde;oles</span> (20 vols., 1847&#150;65) could not have been produced. Wiffen himself edited volume 2, the <span class="italic">Ep&iacute;stola consolatoria</span> (1848), by Juan P&eacute;rez de Pineda, contributing also a notice of the author in Spanish and English which was reprinted with the English translation (by John T. Betts) in 1871. He also edited volume 15, the <span class="italic">Alfabeto cristiano</span> (1861), by Juan de Vald&eacute;s, in Italian, with modern versions in Spanish and English by Usoz and Wiffen respectively. The remaining volumes were edited by Usoz y R&iacute;o. Wiffen also wrote the &#145;Life and writings of Juan de Vald&eacute;s&#146; (1865) which accompanied the English translation of Vald&eacute;s's <span class="italic">Hundred and Ten Considerations</span> by John T. Betts; and a &#145;Biographical sketch&#146; (1869) of Constantino Ponce de la Fuente, to accompany the English version of his <span class="italic">Confession of a Sinner</span>, by the same translator. In 1874&#150;1904 Eduard Boehmer printed the <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Wiffeniana</span> (3 vols.), containing lives and writings of Spanish reformers from 1520, &#145;according to &hellip; Wiffen's plan and with the use of his materials&#146; (as the full title states) but reshaped and with a large contribution by Boehmer himself. The work is a monument to Wiffen's aims and values as stated by himself as early as 1848:<blockquote>No merely sectarian or proselytising motive had suggested this course, but something of a love of books, and literature, and a feeling (call it obstinate or generous, as you will) that the persecuted victims of literature should find a voice in after ages, and protectors from the cruelty and bigotry of the ruling powers of their own times. (Pattison, 127)</blockquote>In early life, and again later, Wiffen wrote verse of some merit but he published nothing separately. He reportedly destroyed his more youthful work. A substantial selection of his later poems (unpublished previously, for the most part) is given in Pattison's <span class="italic">The Brothers Wiffen</span>. Wiffen died, unmarried, at Aspley Guise on 18 March 1867, and was buried in the Quaker burial-ground at Woburn Sands on 24 March. In Pattison's <span class="italic">The Brothers Wiffen</span> he is described as &#145;a small, pale, keen-eyed man&#146;  (81), always dressed in Quaker garb, and strict in all observances of the Friends.<br>
