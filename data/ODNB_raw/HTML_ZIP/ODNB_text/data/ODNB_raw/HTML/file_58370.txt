<span class="headword">Maclean <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Macleane]</span>,  Arthur John</span>  (1858&#150;1943), <span class="occ">Scottish Episcopal bishop of Moray, Ross, and Caithness, and Syriac scholar</span>, was born on 6 July 1858 at 15 Springfield Place, Bath, the last of ten children of A. J. Macleane (1811/12&#150;1858), clergyman and Latin scholar, and his wife, Sarah, daughter of R. S. Hutchings, clergyman and orientalist, and his wife, Elvina. Maclean (he dropped the final &#145;e&#146; after university) belonged to a branch of the Macleanes of Ardgour which migrated to India after the Jacobite rising of 1745 and achieved great prominence there. His father, after a short period in the Indian Civil Service, settled in England but died two months before Maclean's birth. In 1865 Maclean was sent, with his brother Douglas, to live with his sister Flora and her husband, the Revd James Cholmeley, in Lincolnshire. Like his surrogate father Maclean was a gifted mathematician. Educated first in Huntingdon, he then went to Eton College in 1873 as a king's scholar, and then in 1876 to King's College, Cambridge, where he gained a first-class degree, ninth wrangler, in mathematics (1880) and until 1883 was college mathematical lecturer (as he was also at Selwyn College). His vacations from Cambridge were spent in his beloved Scottish highlands (he later claimed to have seen the Loch Ness monster), and especially on the island of Cumbrae where he learned to read and speak Gaelic and was inspired by the teachings of the Oxford Movement. In December 1882 he was ordained deacon, and in June 1883 was priested in the Scottish Episcopal church. From 1882 to 1886 he was priest-in-charge of Portree, Skye, where he began by building a parish church, St Columba's.<br>
<br>In 1886 Maclean travelled to Orumiyyeh, in the Azerbaijan province of Persia, as the first head of the archbishop of Canterbury's mission to the Assyrian Christians which had as its purpose not conversion, which its statutes forbade, but the strengthening of faith and religious practice. He oversaw the establishment, by 1891, of an upper school for young clergy, four high schools for boys, and seventy-eight village schools. The mission press acquired Syriac type and printed liturgical and other works. In 1890 a house of Anglican Sisters of Bethany was founded in Orumiyyeh with an associated girls' school. He learned to speak modern Syriac, and later published an important grammar (1895) and dictionary (1901) of the language, as well as learning classical Syriac which he employed in several significant liturgical studies.<br>
<br>In March 1891 Maclean left Persia for Portree, his former parish. In 1892 he co-authored an account of the Assyrian Christians and in the same year he was honoured by being appointed canon of Cumbrae and dean of Argyll and the Isles. He built a rectory, and married Eva Maclean (<i>d</i>. 1951), daughter of John Maclean MD, on 14 June 1894; they had no children. After a period as rector of St John's, Selkirk (1897&#150;1903), where he became a central figure in the campaign for lay representation in the Episcopal church, he was appointed Pantonian professor and principal of the Episcopal Theological College in Edinburgh. He spent only five terms at the college but his energy, devotion, and financial skills saved it from near ruin. He was consecrated as bishop of Moray, Ross, and Caithness in December 1904 (in the same year he received the degree of DD from Cambridge and from Glasgow) and resigned as principal at Easter 1905. He then took up residence in Eden Court, Inverness, where he remained for the rest of his life, actively involved in diocesan affairs and a central figure in the production of the Scottish prayer book of 1929. On 8 February 1935 he was elected primus of the Scottish Episcopal church, which he represented at the coronation of George VI in 1937. He resigned just a fortnight before his death, at his home, Eden Court, Inverness, on 24 February 1943. He was buried on the 27th in Tomnahurich cemetery, Inverness.<br>
