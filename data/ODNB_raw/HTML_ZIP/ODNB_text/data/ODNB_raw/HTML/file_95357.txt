<span class="headword">Evans,  Evan</span> <span class="st"> [Ieuan Glan Geirionydd]</span>  (1795&#150;1855), <span class="occ">Welsh-language poet</span>, was born at Tan-y-celyn in Trefriw, Caernarvonshire, on 20 April 1795. His father, Robert Evans, a farmer, and his mother, Elizabeth Evans, were people of some culture and literate in both Welsh and English; they were among the founders of Calvinistic Methodism in Trefriw, a village about seven miles north of Betws-y-coed in the Conwy valley. The boy was sent to the free grammar school at Llanrwst, a place he was later to celebrate in a famous poem, <span class="italic">Ysgoldy rhad Llanrwst</span> (&#145;The free schoolhouse at Llanrwst&#146;). On leaving school he went to work on his father's farm but the family was impoverished after the Gwydir estate, which owned the land, put up the rent. At the age of twenty-one, with only a grammar school education, he went to Tal-y-bont, in his native county, as master of a day school.<br>
<br>Evans came to public attention at the eisteddfod held in Wrexham in 1820 after winning a prize with his ode <span class="italic">Hiraeth Cymro am ei wlad mewn bro estronawl</span> (&#145;A Welshman's longing for his country in a foreign place&#146;). On the same occasion he made the acquaintance of a number of gentlemen and clerics such as Ifor Ceri (John Jenkins), who recognized his gifts and encouraged him to seek holy orders. He studied first at Aberriw in Montgomeryshire and then at St Bees Theological College, Cumberland, and in 1826 was duly ordained by the bishop of Chester and licensed to conduct the Welsh services at St Martin's Church, Chester. In the same year he became curate of Christleton, near Chester, where he stayed until 1843, when he was moved to a curacy at nearby Ince.<br>
<br>Ieuan Glan Geirionydd (the name by which Evans was widely known in bardic and antiquarian circles) was a prolific and gifted writer in Welsh. He was for long associated with a group of Anglican clergymen known as <i>yr</i> <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95356', "hen bersoniaid llengar")</script> (&#145;the old literary clerics&#146;) who strove to promote Welsh antiquities, learning, and literature within an Anglican church that was unsympathetic, and often hostile, to such activity. His journalistic talents were put, for the most part, into editing the periodical <span class="italic">Y Gwladgarwr</span> (&#145;The patriot&#146;) between 1833 and 1836, and his erudition into writing or translating books on theological subjects, none of which is still highly regarded.<br>
<br>Ieuan Glan Geirionydd's reputation rests on his literary work, especially his verse which was written in both the strict and free metres. He won the chair at three eisteddfodau: at St Asaph in 1818 with his <span class="italic">Awdl ar farwolaeth y Dywysoges Charlotte</span> (&#145;Ode on the death of Princess Charlotte&#146;); at Denbigh in 1828 with his <span class="italic">Awdl ar wledd Belsassar</span> (&#145;Ode on Belshazzar's feast&#146;); and again at Denbigh in 1850 with his <i>pryddest</i> <span class="italic">Yr adgyfodiad</span> (&#145;The resurrection&#146;). The archaic language and orthography of these poems were adversely affected by the outlandish theories of William Owen Pughe and are little read nowadays. His poem <span class="italic">Y bedd</span> (&#145;The grave&#146;; 1821), however, is among the greatest poems written in the strict metres during the first half of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Even so, it is as a poet in the free metres that Ieuan is chiefly remembered. Much influenced by the English &#145;churchyard school&#146; of Thomas Gray, Robert Blair, and Edward Young, his lyrics display his musical gifts in their smooth melodic metre and clear, dignified language. In such poems as <span class="italic">Caniad y gog i Arfon</span> (&#145;The cuckoo's song to Caernarvonshire&#146;) he imitated the old harp-stanzas to brilliant effect, while <span class="italic">Glan Geirionydd</span> (&#145;On the bank of Geirionydd&#146;) delighted in childhood memories and the poet's communion with nature. Saunders Lewis, who made a selection of Ieuan's work in 1931, thought it was in such poems that he belonged most truly to the tradition of Goronwy Owen and that his work in the free metres showed the paramount spirit of the classical tradition in Welsh, namely stoicism; no later critic has challenged this view. Ieuan's achievement was crowned by his hymns, such as <span class="italic">Ar lan Iorddonen ddofn</span> (&#145;On the bank of the deep Jordan&#146;) and <span class="italic">Mor dedwydd yw y rhai trwy ffydd</span> (&#145;So happy are those who by faith&#146;), which are among the finest ever written in Welsh and are still sung by congregations in Wales.<br>
<br>Ieuan was married, though further details are unknown. Towards the end of 1852, his wife having died and being in indifferent health himself, he left Ince and returned to Trefriw and, shortly afterwards, obtained a curacy at Rhyl. He died there on 21 January 1855 and was buried in the churchyard of St Mary's at Trefriw.<br>
