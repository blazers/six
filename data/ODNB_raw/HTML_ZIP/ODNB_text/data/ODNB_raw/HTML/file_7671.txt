<span class="headword">Dilly,  Charles</span>  (1739&#150;1807), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was born on 22 May 1739 at Southill, Bedfordshire, the third son of Thomas Dilly, a substantial yeoman farmer. The family had been based in Southill for at least two centuries, according to James Boswell. On 1 June 1756 he was bound as an apprentice to his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7672/', "Edward Dilly (1732&#150;1779)")</script>, a bookseller established at the sign of Rose and Crown at 22 Poultry, London, and was freed on 7 June 1763; he became a liveryman of the Stationers' Company on the same day. He made a short trip to America, visiting Philadelphia in 1764, but was back in London by spring that year when he became a junior partner in his brother's successful bookselling business.<br>
<br>During the years of their partnership the Dillys produced a great number and range of titles, with a particular specialism in dissenting and &#145;American&#146; literature, reflecting the brothers' whig and patriot political sympathies. The brothers were well known for their support of their authors&#151;they practically adopted James Boswell, who said they made him feel &#145;like blood relations&#146;&#151;and Charles in particular was described as &#145;a kind and faithful adviser&#146; to &#145;young and inexperienced authors&#146; (<span class="italic">Boswell in Search of a Wife</span>, 151; Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 3.191). Their premises in the Poultry, in which they both lived and worked, became an important nexus for social, political, and literary figures; Benjamin Rush described their shop as a &#145;kind of Coffee house for authors&#146;  (Rush, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 62&#150;3). In particular, the brothers threw legendary dinner parties, which attracted high praise from Nichols and Richard Cumberland among others. The company was varied&#151;Samuel Johnson was a frequent guest&#151;and was by no means limited to those who shared the brothers' religious or political beliefs.<br>
<br>Charles Dilly remained very much the junior partner until Edward's death in 1779, after which he carried on the business in his own name. However, the character and volume of the firm's output did not significantly change. Nichols noted that, on his brother's death, Charles &#145;became the sole proprietor of a very valuable trading concern, which he continued to cultivate with that industry and application which &hellip; leads to opulence&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 3.191). Charles also had interests in the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> until its demise in 1787, and by 1792 had become a partner in the <span class="italic">London Packet, or, New Lloyd's Evening Post</span>. Politically more moderate than his brother, he was a member of John Cartwright's Society for Constitutional Information, and was also one of the controversial &#145;pro-Americans&#146; who supported the colonies during their campaign and eventual war for independence. This did not prevent him from being approached to serve as an alderman and as a sheriff of London, both offers he declined, the latter on grounds of his religious nonconformity. He did, however, accept promotion within the Stationers' Company during the 1790s, eventually serving as the company's master for 1802&#150;3.<br>
<br>At the end of January 1800 Dilly sold the firm to Joseph Mawman of York and retired to Clophill, Bedfordshire. However, he did not take well to his retirement, and returned to London life about 1802, living in Brunswick Row, Queen Square, in Holborn. A sudden &#145;oppression of breath&#146; afflicted him on 3 May 1807 while visiting his friend Richard Cumberland at Ramsgate, at whose house he died the following day  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1807, 480). He was buried on 12 May in St George the Martyr, Queen Square, London. Like his brother&#151;and indeed like his two other siblings&#151;he was unmarried, and his substantial estate (estimated at nearly &pound;60,000) passed primarily to maternal relations. Mawman succeeded to the business although the exact timing and terms of the handover are unclear.<br>
<br>The third Dilly brother, <a name="cosubject_7673"></a><span class="headword">John Dilly</span>  (1731&#150;1806), <span class="occ">gentleman</span>, was born at Southill, Bedfordshire, in 1731, the eldest son of Thomas Dilly. He was known almost entirely on account of kinship to his bookselling brothers&#151;Boswell nicknamed him Squire Dilly  (Tinker, 2.285). He &#145;cultivated the paternal inheritance&#146; at Southill, and maintained the family image as &#145;of some consequence in the higher ranks of old English yeomen&#146;  (Bingham, 1&#150;2). He was elected high sheriff of the county in 1783, and died a bachelor on 18 March 1806 at Clophill, Bedfordshire, while visiting Charles.<br>
