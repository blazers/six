<span class="headword">Seymour <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Thynne]</span>,  Frances</span>, duchess of Somerset  (1699&#150;1754), <span class="occ">poet and letter writer</span>, was born on 10 May 1699, probably at Longleat House, Wiltshire, the eldest child and coheir of Henry Thynne (1675&#150;1708) and Grace (<i>c</i>.1676&#150;1725), daughter and heir of Sir George Strode. Her early upbringing was at Longleat, home of her grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27424/', "Thomas Thynne, first Viscount Weymouth (bap. 1640, d. 1714)")</script>, where she became friendly with Elizabeth Singer, later Rowe (1674&#150;1737). Another early poet friend was her great-aunt Anne Finch, countess of Winchilsea (1661&#150;1720). After her father died in 1708 Frances and her mother moved to Leweston, near Sherborne, home of the Strodes.<br>
<br>On 5 July 1715 Frances, aged sixteen, married the soldier and courtier <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25156/', "Algernon Seymour, earl of Hertford (1684&#150;1750)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25158/', "Seymour, Charles, sixth duke of Somerset")</script>]. Her husband's parents, the &#145;proud duke&#146; of Somerset and his duchess, unaccountably hated her. There were two children of the marriage: Elizabeth (1716&#150;1776) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59609/', "Percy, Elizabeth, duchess of Northumberland")</script>] and George, Viscount Beauchamp (1725&#150;1744). An estate at Marlborough, Wiltshire, was settled on Hertford at his marriage; he completed the grand house begun by his father while Lady Hertford improved the landscape. From about 1730 they also had a modest country retreat at St Leonard's Hill, near Windsor; their town house was in Dover Street until 1721, thereafter in Grosvenor Street. In 1723 Lady Hertford was appointed lady of the bedchamber to Caroline, princess of Wales (later Queen Caroline), with a salary of &pound;500 p.a.<br>
<br>Two short poems by Lady Hertford, based on the sentimental story of Inkle and Yarico retold by Steele in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, no. 11, were printed anonymously in <span class="italic">A New Miscellany &hellip; Written Chiefly by Persons of Quality</span> (1725). Isaac Watts published four short poems by her under the pen-name Eusebia (&#145;Piety&#146;), in his <span class="italic">Reliquiae juveniles</span> (1734); but her unconquerable diffidence ensured that most of her verse remained unpublished in her lifetime. She wrote many lively letters to family members, and to Watts, Elizabeth Rowe, and other friends, including notably Henrietta Knight, Lady Luxborough, and Henrietta Louisa Fermor, countess of Pomfret. Their subjects are, variously, literature, religion, court gossip, family, and the pleasures of a rural life. A few appeared in Rowe's <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works</span> (1739) but most remained unpublished in Lady Hertford's lifetime.<br>
<br>Lady Hertford was patron to two generations of poets, including Watts, Rowe, Laurence Eusden (1688&#150;1730), James Thomson (1700&#150;1748), John Dyer (1700&#150;1757), Stephen Duck (1705&#150;1756), her son's tutor John Dalton (1709&#150;1763), William Thompson (1712&#150;1766), and William Shenstone (1714&#150;1763), all of whom complimented her in published verse. Johnson asserted that Thomson, on his first visit to Marlborough, &#145;took more delight in carousing with lord Hertford and his friends than assisting her ladyship's poetical operations, and therefore never received another summons&#146;  (Johnson, 3.287), but the countess did in fact issue further invitations as well as smoothing Thomson's path to royal patronage. Of even more value was her intercession with Queen Caroline in January 1728, which secured a pardon for Thomson's friend Richard Savage (<i>d</i>. 1743), poet and convicted murderer.<br>
<br>The queen's death in 1737 ended Lady Hertford's service as lady of the bedchamber, leaving her with a pension of &pound;400 p.a. and time to devote to rural pursuits. The estate at St Leonard's Hill was given up in 1739 when the Seymours acquired nearby Richings, near Colnbrook, Buckinghamshire. They renamed it Percy Lodge and adorned it with a hexagon, a hermitage, and a &#145;bungola&#146; (bungalow) in the Indian style.<br>
<br>Lady Hertford was a lifelong evangelical Christian. Rowe's posthumous <span class="italic">Devout Exercises of the Heart</span> (1737), with a preface by Watts, was dedicated to her, and her religious friends and correspondents included, in addition to Rowe and Watts, Selina, countess of Huntington (1707&#150;1791), and Catherine Talbot (1721&#150;1770). Her piety was intensified when her beloved son contracted smallpox on his grand tour and died at Bologna on 11 September 1744, his nineteenth birthday. According to Horace Walpole she then interested herself in spiritualism, influenced by Rowe's famous <span class="italic">Friendship in Death</span>  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 35.179).<br>
<br>On 2 December 1748 Lady Hertford became duchess of Somerset following her father-in-law's death; her husband died on 7 February 1750. She passed her remaining years as dowager duchess of Somerset at Percy Lodge; she died there on 7 July 1754 and was buried on 20 July beside her son and husband in Westminster Abbey.<br>
