<span class="headword">Wolff,  Martin</span>  (1872&#150;1953), <span class="occ">jurist</span>, was born in Berlin on 26 September 1872, the elder child and only son of Wilhelm Wolff, banker, and his wife, Selma Ball. After studying under Heinrich Brunner and Otto Gierke, he became in 1900 a <i>Privatdozent</i> in the Berlin faculty of law and in 1903 an extraordinary professor; in 1914 he was called to Marburg as an ordinary professor; in 1918 to Bonn; and finally in 1922 back to Berlin, where he taught until 1935 when, as a Jew, he was ousted by the Nazis. In 1938, on the invitation of All Souls College, Oxford, he emigrated to England, where he was naturalized in 1945. Wolff married in 1906 Marguerite, daughter of Hermann Jolowicz, silk merchant in London, and sister of another lawyer, H. F. Jolowicz; they had two sons.<br>
<br>Trained in the German universities at a period when the best energies of academic lawyers were bent towards the completion of the German civil code, it fell to Wolff more than anyone else to explain that part of the code which enacted the law of property, to place it in its historical setting, and to draw out its consequences. This he did in lectures which have become a legend among German lawyers and above all, in 1910&#150;12, in the relevant parts of L. Enneccerus, T. Kipp, and M. Wolff, <span class="italic">Lehrbuch des b&uuml;rgerlichen Rechts</span>, a book of the highest authority and influence which in his lifetime ran into nine editions and which the Nazis found no way of superseding. All German private law, indeed, fell within his province, and he wrote extensively on it, but more significant for his later career was his interest in private international law and comparative law, in both of which he acquired an audience extending far beyond Germany. He wrote a succinct but highly authoritative work on the former subject as applied in Germany and he was one of the most active participants in the work of the great Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Comparative Law. He was one of the editors of the <span class="italic">Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Ausl&auml;ndisches und Internationales Privatrecht</span> and of the <span class="italic">Rechtsvergleichendes Handw&ouml;rterbuch f&uuml;r das Zivil- und Handelsrecht</span>, the nearest thing that has yet appeared to a comprehensive encyclopaedia of comparative private law. He also lectured regularly on French civil law.<br>
<br>In England, Wolff was financially assisted by All Souls College in preparing a book on English private international law, which appeared in 1945 and rapidly established itself as an important authority. He made a special contribution to the subject by introducing a comparative element and used foreign experience to suggest the solution of problems which had not hitherto come before the courts; but so accurate was his exposition of English law and so complete his familiarity with the English point of view that reviewers disagreed with him as though he were one of themselves and not an intruder from abroad. A second edition appeared in 1950. He also found time in England to contribute a long account of French private law to the new edition of <span class="italic">Chambers's Encyclopaedia</span> and a brilliant summary of commercial law to the <span class="italic">Manual of German Law</span> published under the auspices of the Foreign Office. He saw appear at last, in 1950&#150;52, a three-volume work to which he had made large contributions, the <span class="italic">Trait&eacute; de droit compar&eacute;</span> by P. Arminjon, B. E. Nolde, and M. Wolff.<br>
<br>Wolff's greatest strength probably lay in his lecturing, which was characterized by extreme lucidity, a wonderful gift for making abstract principles live by an apt choice of examples, and a patently sincere pursuit of justice. In the largest hall of Berlin University, holding between one and two thousand students, this tiny man with his light but clear voice commanded absolute silence by the sheer force of his personality, except when some witticism dissolved his audience into laughter. Moreover, although he never sought to dominate his more intimate pupils but strove to make of them independent thinkers, most if not all of them remained immune from Nazi influence.<br>
<br>In Oxford, Wolff gave only one lecture, a famous and classical one entitled &#145;The nature of legal persons&#146;; he did, however, attend regularly seminars on comparative law and so came into contact with quite a number of undergraduates, who learned to know his power as a teacher. He enjoyed these opportunities of meeting young men until his health began to fail during the last year or two of his life. Since he made no attempt to put himself forward, in the unpropitious conditions of the war and the immediate post-war period he did not become so rapidly known to his fellow lawyers, although he occasionally examined a thesis. But in the end he became well known and when he reached the age of eighty the university conferred on him the honorary degree, rarely given to academic lawyers, of DCL. Scholars from different countries combined to offer him a Festschrift which contains a full bibliography of his writings, and the Bundesrepublik conferred on him the <i>Grosser Verdienstkreuz</i>. He held honorary doctorates from Marburg and Salonika.<br>
<br>Wolff united a remarkably sweet and gentle disposition with a sharp and pungent wit and a clear insight into his own and other people's abilities and character. Those qualities, together with a wide range of interests, of which perhaps the most vital was in the theory and practice of music, made him excellent company. One of the greatest jurists of his age, he influenced deeply a whole generation of pupils and colleagues. He died at 2 Strathray Gardens, Hampstead, London, on 20 July 1953.<br>
