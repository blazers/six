<span class="headword">Stewart <span class="st"> [Stuart]</span>,  John</span>, second duke of Albany  (<em>c.</em>1482&#150;1536), <span class="occ">soldier and magnate</span>, was born in Auvergne, France, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26453/', "Alexander Stewart, duke of Albany (1454?&#150;1485)")</script>, younger brother of James III, king of Scots, and his second wife, Anne de la Tour (<i>d</i>. 1512), third daughter of Bertrand II, comte d'Auvergne, and his wife, Louise de la Tr&eacute;moille. His father died in a jousting accident in 1485 when a splintered lance entered his eye, and on 15 February in either 1487 or 1488 his mother married Louis, <i>comte de la chambre</i> and vicomte de Maurienne, of an illustrious Savoyard family; she lived until 13 October 1512. Albany seems to have been sent to the court of Charles VIII at a young age, probably about 1494, as he later remarked that he had served French monarchs since he was twelve years of age.<h2>
<a name="ServiceinFrancecontactswithScotland"></a>Service in France, contacts with Scotland</h2>In September 1499 Charles's successor, Louis XII, invaded Lombardy with 20,000 soldiers, and in three weeks he had conquered it along with the city of Genoa. The young duke of Albany was among the French nobles who soon afterwards accompanied their king when the latter triumphantly entered Milan. In 1501 he took part in an international crusade to the eastern Mediterranean and apparently distinguished himself in an attack on the Aegean island of Mytilene, where he was slightly injured. On the return voyage in December his ship was wrecked on an inhospitable coast, the survivors being left with little more than their cloaks for protection from the winter wet and cold. Fortunately Albany and his companions were rescued by a Venetian barque which transported them to Corfu, whence they were able to sail for home. In the following year, aged twenty, he was appointed captain of 100 lances <i>des ordonnances du roi</i> garrisoned at Bordeaux, and in 1503 he returned to campaigning in Italy, where, however, the French were everywhere defeated and left without so much as an inch of ground. In 1505 King Louis arranged Albany's marriage to the latter's first cousin, Anne de la Tour, also known as Anne de Boulogne (<i>c</i>.1497&#150;1524), who was then aged seven or eight and was the rich heir to the comte d'Auvergne. The marriage took place on 13 July in that year. Whether it was a reward for or an inducement to loyalty, it had the desired effect, and when Louis invaded Italy again, in 1507, Albany was present in the army, preceding the king when the latter entered Genoa on 28 April.<br>
<br>It seems unlikely that the duke of Albany had forgotten that he was a Scottish peer, but for the first twenty years of his life his interests were predominantly French. On 5 December 1512 Louis XII requested James IV of Scotland to restore his father's dukedom to John Stuart (as his name is invariably spelt in French sources), but even this step was taken in a French context, being intended to place Albany on an equal footing with his wife and so enable him to assign dower to her in accordance with custom. James is not known to have responded. Within a year, however, everything had changed. On 9 September 1513 James was killed at Flodden along with many of his nobles, leaving an infant as his successor. In the aftermath of this disaster the first act of the lords of the council, on 19 September 1513, was to arrange the coronation of the seventeen-month-old James V at Stirling and to appoint his mother, Margaret, as guardian of the king and regent of the kingdom in accordance with James IV's will. Albany was the heir presumptive, and in November that year parliament not only sent ambassadors to Louis XII to remind him of the ancient alliance between France and Scotland but it also requested that &#145;it would pleise and lyke the said maist Cristin king to send the duke of Albany with his help and municounis with all maner of necesseries for weir in the realme of Scotland&#146;  (<span class="italic">APS</span>, <i>1424&#150;1567</i>, 281).<br>
<br>Responding to an earlier communiqu&eacute;, Louis had already agreed that Albany should cross to his homeland, declaring on 4 October:<blockquote>As to the fourth article desiring the King to send the Duke of Albany to Scotland, as having right to the government and regency, he answers that he is willing because Albany is capable of it, although the Duke is much employed in his wars. Yet he will send him because he values the young king's affaires as his own. Before his departure it would be well to know the will of the Queen, Estates, and Council, and the Duke should go in such a way as to be able to render service. (<span class="italic">Flodden Papers</span>, 84)</blockquote>Albany himself wrote in similar terms to his agent Antoine de la Bastie, seigneur d'Arcy, echoing most of the French king's words and appealing to the Scots for support. He offered all possible service to the queen, her son, and the country, and begged them to employ him in France for such service. However, he never mentioned coming to Scotland himself, and at the beginning of 1514 he and Louis seem to have been thinking principally of helping Scotland by strengthening her alliance with Denmark, which had become increasingly important under James IV.<h2>
<a name="FrancoScottishdiplomacy"></a>Franco-Scottish diplomacy</h2>All his engagements with Scottish affairs were coloured by the fact that Albany was perceived as essentially French, and by the effects of this perception on Anglo-French relations. In English eyes he was essentially a French agent in a position to make trouble on the Anglo-Scottish borders, and so to put serious constraints on England's freedom of manoeuvre. In French eyes he was apt to appear in much the same light, but as a liberating rather than a complicating factor and as a valuable card which could bring rich rewards if skilfully played. Henry VIII wanted to keep him away from Scotland, whereas Louis XII and then Fran&ccedil;ois I could hope for diplomatic advantage simply by threatening to send Albany there, and for military advantage if he actually went.<br>
<br>On 3 June 1514, perhaps in an attempt to put pressure on England in the peace negotiations then in progress, French policy became one of positive action, with an &#145;Estimate for the Duke of Albany's Forces&#146; being drawn up for Louis XII. A total expenditure of 438,950 livres tournois was envisaged to cover the wages of 8000 soldiers and sailors for four months and appropriate supplies of armaments and provisions. Although there were rumours that Albany would cross to Scotland with the Yorkist pretender Richard de la Pole, and though the two men did co-operate under French auspices later, Louis was clearly not banking on war, for on the same day he made an &#145;Offer to the King of Scots in the case of peace or truce&#146; of 25,000 livres tournois to help with the finances of the kingdom. Of Albany he wrote that &#145;though the king needs his service in his wars and other affairs, still he is willing he should go so soon as possible&#146;  (<span class="italic">Flodden Papers</span>, 100&#150;01). In a separate dispatch Albany himself explained the significance of the current negotiations for a Europe-wide truce, but he also raised the possibility of further war between England and Scotland, and advised the Scots to prepare themselves for it by raising troops in Denmark and by maintaining domestic union. And he instructed the Scottish ambassador to convey the French king's anxiety &#145;for the good government of the kingdom and his pleasure with the Queen and Council, particularly the Queen's intention to keep on his side in spite of the offers made by England&#146;  (ibid., 108&#150;9).<br>
<br>Hopes of unity were dashed when on 6 August 1514 Queen Margaret married Archibald Douglas, sixth earl of Angus, prompting an immediate decision by the lords of the council that she should relinquish the regency. On 18 September an invitation was sent:<blockquote>to my lord duk of Albany governor of Scotland to cum hame in this realme of Scotland in all possible haist for the defence of the samin and for gud reule to be put and kepit in the said realme in all partis. (Hannay, 20)</blockquote>Albany was also requested to ask the French king for material help. Louis was probably too preoccupied to notice these developments, for three months later, on 9 October, he himself remarried, to the eighteen-year-old Mary Tudor. Albany was present at the wedding. Less than three months later Louis was dead, to be succeeded by the duc d'Angoul&ecirc;me as Fran&ccedil;ois I. If Louis had been reluctant to send Albany to Scotland, Fran&ccedil;ois showed no such inhibitions. He planned to invade Italy, and to have Albany in Scotland would help to keep the English occupied at home. So it was that on 3 July 1515 the lords of the council recorded &#145;that ane excellent and mychti prince Johnne duke of Albany, governour and protectour of Scotland and tutour to the kingis grace to his perfite age, arivit in the said realme the XVIII day of May&#146;  (ibid., 40).<h2>
<a name="GovernorofScotland"></a>Governor of Scotland</h2>By the time Albany landed Margaret had been obliged to give up her children and forced to flee with Angus to England. On 28 September 1515, however, Albany offered &#145;to schew hir all the humanities that he can, sa that sche will return and cum in Scotland and be ane gud Scottis weman as accordis hir to doo&#146;  (Hannay, 57). But as well as trying to deprive Henry VIII of the diplomatic advantage which Queen Margaret's flight to England had given the English king, Albany also applied himself to strengthening Scottish links with France. Following a commission from Fran&ccedil;ois to open negotiations on 29 March 1515, a further confirmation of the &#145;auld alliance&#146; was signed by Albany on 2 January 1516, and then taken to Paris by the bishop of Ross.<br>
<br>It is generally agreed that Albany's first tour of duty in Scotland was successful. The council sat with increasing frequency and effectiveness, creating a clear perception &#145;that land disputes, claims against theft and kidnapping and feuds could be redressed satisfactorily&#146;, and that &#145;Albany could undoubtedly rely on the support of the majority of the ruling class&#146;  (Emond, 60). Nevertheless, Albany had to confront the spoiling tactics of Henry VIII, who exploited the grievances of James Hamilton, first earl of Arran, and Alexander, third Lord Home, probably offended by the duke's restoration to his father's earldom of March in a region where the Homes were now dominant. Home and Arran signed a bond for the removal of the king from the governor's custody and won the support of the earls of Lennox, Glencairn, and Eglinton, and even some highland chiefs. Nevertheless, Albany was able to maintain his position as governor. He showed himself unquestionably loyal to the young king, and soon after his arrival in Scotland he risked offending his principal ally by declining to send James V's brother Alexander to France as Fran&ccedil;ois wanted. On 13 November 1516 his position as second person of the realm was formally acknowledged by parliament.<br>
<br>Yet again, however, the international situation complicated Albany's position. Preoccupied with his campaigns in Italy (his great victory at Marignano on 14 September 1515 was celebrated in Scotland with bonfires), Fran&ccedil;ois did not want to risk hostilities with England, and on 3 November 1516 he declared that a prior Anglo-French peace treaty meant that he could not ratify the treaty proposal of 2 January 1516. The Scots responded by making further efforts to secure the French alliance, and reminded Fran&ccedil;ois of its antecedents, but they also agreed to a truce with England and to Queen Margaret's coming back to Scotland. On 24 May 1517 the council formally agreed to her return and, on the next day, to Albany's leaving for France, &#145;for expeditioun of the materis concernyng the common wele of this realme&#146;  (Hannay, 91&#150;3). On 2 June Albany appointed a council to govern in his absence and on the 8th he departed, intending, it was reported, to return in five months.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoFrance"></a>Return to France</h2>Soon after his return to France, Albany, as governor of Scotland, and Charles, duc d'Alen&ccedil;on, on behalf of France, started negotiations for a treaty of friendship and alliance. This was signed at Rouen on 20 August 1517, and Albany undertook to have it ratified by the Scottish parliament within two months of his return. Alen&ccedil;on in turn promised confirmation by Fran&ccedil;ois when Scottish ratification was forthcoming. The treaty reconfirmed the &#145;auld alliance&#146;, defining in military terms the mutual responsibilities incumbent upon each kingdom should either be attacked by England. There was also agreement in principle for James V's marriage to a French princess. This treaty was one of the most important in sixteenth-century Scottish history. It was constantly referred to and updated during Albany's regency, and after 1528 it was the fundamental plank upon which James V rested his entire foreign policy. Albany's immediate reward was a gift of 10,000 livres tournois, ordered by Fran&ccedil;ois on 28 August 1517 for the duke's services to the French kingdom over the last two years. But Albany did not forget the Scottish kingdom, and in May 1518 he persuaded the French king to grant privileges to Scottish merchants under letters patent signed at Amboise. About this time he was again reported to be collaborating with Richard de la Pole in a planned invasion of England, but the rumours seem to have been baseless.<br>
<br>Albany also had responsibilities in Auvergne and at the French court. On 28 February 1518 Queen Claude gave birth to a son; in April the dauphin, also named Fran&ccedil;ois, was baptized at Amboise, and the ceremony was attended by all the highest-ranking nobility of France, including the duke and duchess of Albany. The dauphin's godfather, Pope Leo X, was represented by his nephew Lorenzo di Medici, duke of Urbino, to whom Fran&ccedil;ois promised Albany's sister-in-law, Madeleine de La Tour d'Auvergne, in marriage. The duke and duchess had a daughter, Catherine, born at Urbino on 19 April 1519, but both died within a month of her birth, whereupon their child became the ward of her great-uncle, Leo X. In France she was a great heiress, for Fran&ccedil;ois declared that she could inherit the French lands of her mother. After the death of Leo X on 1 December 1521, Albany was appointed her tutor, as her closest male relative, and when he returned to Scotland shortly afterwards he appointed his wife to act as his proxy in administering Catherine's possessions.<br>
<br>After he was appointed regent for James V, Albany exchanged a number of letters with the papal curia regarding Scottish ecclesiastical concerns; as his infant niece's closest male relative his standing at Rome, first under Leo X and then under another Medici pope, Clement VII, was greatly enhanced. He used this to promote Scottish interests, as when he approached Leo X on 5 January 1519 for confirmation of Innocent VIII's bull of 1487, &#145;granting delay of eight months in providing for prelatical vacancies in order that the king might forward his supplications&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of James V</span>, 68), and again a few weeks later, when he requested that the pope take James V under his protection. In such moves he had the support of Fran&ccedil;ois, who hoped that Albany's family connections might prove useful to Franco-papal relations in the future.<br>
<br>Meanwhile all was not well in Scotland. Before Albany returned to France in May 1517 he left French garrisons at Dunbar, Dumbarton, and Inchgarvie, and a commission of regency in which Antoine d'Arcy was appointed the king's lieutenant and president of the council. However, after d'Arcy's murder in September 1517 by members of the Home family, in retaliation for Albany's execution of Alexander, third Lord Home, in the previous year, the earl of Arran took charge of the commission of regency. Arran had the support of the earls of Argyll and Huntly and of James Beaton, archbishop of St Andrews, but Margaret Tudor's husband, the sixth earl of Angus (whose growing estrangement from his wife was itself a cause of turmoil), joined the Homes and other disorderly elements in the south-east, and he also exploited, to the discomfort of Arran's government, the popularity which he and his Douglas kinsmen enjoyed in Edinburgh. Friction between Hamiltons and Douglases worsened in the next two years, and culminated in the &#145;cleanse the causeway&#146; fracas of April 1520 in which the Hamiltons were driven out of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Against this troubled background John, Lord Fleming, was sent to France in spring 1520 with a set of memoranda for consideration by Fran&ccedil;ois, and with instructions stating &#145;that unless Albany comes by midsummer he shall lose his right in the crown&#146; and that the French king &#145;will lose Scotland unless he sends Albany within the appointed time, for in that case &#147;thai wil treyt with Ingland Sickyrly and withtout ony falte&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of James V</span>, 76). In the memoranda a long litany of complaints against England concludes with a reiterated warning:<blockquote>If the governor does not return at once, it will certainly be impossible to preserve the king and realm. It is the aim of the English to prevent the return [of Albany] and foster civil strife, undermining affection for France and Albany, and compelling a peace which will give England control. (ibid., 79)</blockquote>Albany promptly set off for Rome, where he was able to obtain a bull, issued by Leo X on 19 June 1520, taking Scotland and James V under his protection and affirming Albany as governor and James's tutor: &#145;all persons of whatsoever ecclesiastical or worldly station however eminent are forbidden under pain of excommunication and disobedience in anywise to disturb the Duke's government&#146;  (ibid., 79&#150;80). It is not known, however, whether Henry VIII or Wolsey were aware of this bull. While Albany was in Rome he also took the opportunity to attend to some private business and to gain permission for himself and his wife to construct a Sainte Chapelle in Auvergne at their Ch&acirc;teau de Vic-le-Comte (now in Puy-de-D&ocirc;me). On 21 June 1520 Leo X issued a bull authorizing its construction. It was probably completed in 1524, not long before the death of Anne in that year.<h2>
<a name="SecondvisittoScotland"></a>Second visit to Scotland</h2>In October 1520 Fran&ccedil;ois responded to the civil strife and English threats, which alike endangered the peace of Scotland, by sending envoys and money. Albany ordered the Scots to obey the French king's instructions, even though Fran&ccedil;ois had decided that Scotland's interests would be better served if the duke remained in France, seeing his return as likely to cause both war with England and internal conflict. In this Fran&ccedil;ois showed himself concerned to maintain the treaty of universal peace of 2 October 1518, whereby Scotland was comprehended in an Anglo-French alliance. In November 1521, however, developments in international diplomacy yet again dictated the course of Scottish affairs and of Albany's involvement in them. The rupture of the 1518 treaty and the renewed outbreak of Hapsburg&#150;Valois hostilities, along with a deterioration in Anglo-French relations, now made it expedient for the French king that Albany should return to Scotland. One of the duke's first actions, on 28 December at Edinburgh, was to ratify the treaty of friendship with Fran&ccedil;ois on behalf of James V, so renewing the &#145;auld alliance&#146; against England.<br>
<br>Inevitably Henry VIII and Wolsey raised objections to Albany's return. In a letter to the Scottish estates dated 14 January 1522, Henry complained that they had given &#145;the charge of James to a stranger of inferior repute, intending to sever the queen from her husband and marry her himself, to the great danger of the king, the ruin of the queen, and Henry's honour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of James V</span>, 86). The accusation that Albany wanted to marry Margaret Tudor (probably dreamt up by Wolsey), though it recurred frequently during the 1520s, was without the least foundation (in her early letters the queen showed herself consistently hostile to the governor, professing to believe that the latter's ambitions were a threat to her son's life). Similarly, English charges that Albany &#145;was unfit to be governor, because his rule was illegitimate; conducted in French interest; to the financial detriment to Scotland, and to the detriment of Scotland&#146;  (Emond, 296) were no more than propaganda and bore no relation to the actual situation. On 22 February 1522 the chancellor and estates of Scotland declared that &#145;Albany was the lawful tutor of their sovereign, repeatedly called by them to the government, and has always been anxious to preserve the peace, nor would he allow any restraint to be put upon the king&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 3/2, no. 2039).<br>
<br>At this point Albany undoubtedly had the full support of the majority of the Scottish lords. In July and August 1522, however, English forces invaded northern France, and in September the duke responded to this attack on his ally by leading a Scottish army to the west march for an invasion of England. But the Scots, more cautious than they had been a few years earlier, and probably mindful of the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle at Flodden, which had also been fought in the name of a Franco-Scottish alliance, refused to cross the border, the treaty of Rouen notwithstanding. Albany did not linger long after this failure but returned to France at the end of October, intending to raise French troops who would follow his orders and attack the English. Before leaving he again appointed a council of regents: the chancellor, James Beaton, the archbishop of Glasgow, the earls of Arran, Huntly, and Argyll, and Monsieur Antoine Gonzolles, whom Albany had appointed captain of St Andrews Castle after the death of Archbishop Forman in 1521. The regents were sworn to do nothing contrary to the duke's instructions and the latter promised to return before 15 August 1523 or forfeit his authority. His second visit to Scotland had enjoyed a significant domestic success, in that it had ended the paralysis brought to government by the conflict between the Douglases and Hamiltons, but his foreign policy had failed, for he left Scotland without having obtained an Anglo-Scottish truce that also comprehended France.<h2>
<a name="LastvisittoScotland"></a>Last visit to Scotland</h2>Nevertheless, a series of purely Anglo-Scottish truces followed, though these did not prevent Henry VIII from engaging in his now familiar attempts at character assassination, traducing Albany as &#145;that person who had aspired to the crown [of Scotland] at the suggestion of the king of France&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 3/2, no. 2666). For his part Albany sent instructions by George Hay to Cardinal Wolsey in January 1523, referring to Clarenceux herald's recent meeting with the Scottish lords and his demands regarding &#145;certain conditions touching the marriage of the King [James V] with the princess Mary [Tudor], and a truce for sixteen years, on condition that Albany be not allowed to return to Scotland, and that no aid be rendered to France&#146;  (ibid., no. 2333). Albany rebuked Wolsey and upheld his own position, saying that &#145;if the Cardinal desires the peace of the two kingdoms he must address himself to the Duke, as the whole business has been remitted to him&#146; by the Scottish lords  (ibid., no. 2765). Meanwhile the Scots gave an equivocal reply to the English demands, whereupon Henry VIII began to prepare for war, and raiding began at the end of March. The French ambassador assured the Scots of Albany's imminent return, and in this he was supported by Fran&ccedil;ois, who at one point seems to have proposed that the duke should invade England from Brittany in the company of Richard de la Pole and who declared in a letter dated 30 May from Blois that the aid promised under the treaty of Rouen would sail no later than 24 June. Early in June 1523 the English march warden, Thomas, Baron Dacre, approached Chancellor Beaton to explore the possibilities for a renewed truce. But Albany remained a stumbling block, and one over which the Scots refused to budge. They had enjoyed good government when the duke was resident in Scotland, but faced the inescapable dilemma that it was impossible to have his rule without war with England as well. No compromise was possible, and English raids accordingly continued. Meanwhile Albany was doing his best to raise money and men, and when he had not returned by 15 August, as he had promised, the lords agreed to allow him until the end of September. In the event he returned on 20 September, along with a fleet of 87 small vessels, 4000 men-at-arms, 1000 harquebusiers, 600 horses, and a fine artillery park. Three days later an English army crossed the border and destroyed Jedburgh.<br>
<br>The combined French and Scottish force, however, took a month to prepare its response, and the outcome of its eventual campaign dealt a fatal blow to Albany's prestige in Scotland. From the time of his return Albany had difficulties both in assembling Scottish troops and in raising supplies for them. As in the previous year there was little enthusiasm for a war which was perceived as dictated by French interests. It was late in the year, with inclement weather which created boggy conditions for carts and artillery and led to difficulties in fording swollen rivers and streams. The Scots also begrudged the need to provide food, fuel, and lodgings for the French soldiers who paid in French money. On 20 October 1523 an act of parliament ordered the acceptance of French coinage as legal tender in Scotland; refusal to accept it was punishable by death. Nevertheless a Franco-Scottish army was assembled on 19 October and the main force set off on the 27th and reached Melrose next day. On the 30th the earl of Surrey, commanding the English army in the north, learned that the assault would be directed against Wark, where the siege began on 1 November. But it lasted for only three days. Albany was unable to capture the castle, and when news of the approach of Surrey's relieving army reached him he crossed back over the Tweed, and on the 4th disbanded his army.<br>
<br>His failure convinced Albany that he must return to France, but the Scots were anxious not to let him go, even for a short time. He regained some prestige when on 24 November he obtained a confirmation of the treaty of Rouen from the estates, thereby committing the Scots to the &#145;auld alliance&#146; and so to continuing the war against England. Throughout the winter of 1523&#150;4 the English expressed an interest in peace with Scotland, but Albany showed his continuing loyalty to the French crown and its policies by continuing to insist that any truce between the two countries must comprehend France as well. Increasingly anxious to leave, on 22 January 1524 he wrote from Dumbarton to Louise of Savoy, the French king's mother, informing her that he had been on the point of embarking for France when he received her request to stay in Scotland. He stated that he had: &#145;reduced the kingdom into excellent order, and could leave it without danger &hellip; [and] thinks it would be better in his present necessity to go to France to give the French king his advice&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 4/1, no. 52). The lords of council still would not let him go, making it clear that if he departed despite their opposition he would lose all his positions of authority in Scotland. But after many pleas for him to remain they finally relented and agreed to give the duke licence to depart for France for three months (until 31 August 1524), on condition that if he did not return by then his governorship would be at an end. On 31 May 1524 Albany sailed from Dumbarton, never to return to Scotland, though he continued to use the title of governor until 1528 and the end of James's minority. He was accompanied on the voyage by David Beaton (nephew of Chancellor James Beaton), who had been appointed Scottish ambassador to France, but left behind his only surviving child, a daughter named Eleanor, who had been born from a liaison with Jean Abernethy. She later came to France and in 1547 married Jean de l'H&ocirc;pital, comte de Choisy.<h2>
<a name="WarinItaly"></a>War in Italy</h2>Albany's regency was terminated by a <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> in July 1524, when Queen Margaret and her supporters arranged for the twelve-year-old James V to be declared of age. On 11 December following, instructions were sent to Fran&ccedil;ois informing him in the young king's name that since the duke of Albany had not returned as promised, &#145;the three estates have accordingly committed the administration to the King and his mother, and removed Albany entirely&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 4/1, no. 917). Albany was also asked to surrender the castle at Dunbar, which he had left garrisoned by French troops, while the French king was notified that negotiations had begun for an Anglo-Scottish peace. James V himself wrote to Albany to the same effect, concluding with the pious hope that the duke &#145;will remain as good a friend as ever to the realm and its king&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of James V</span>, 112). It is likely that by the time Albany returned to France he was a widower, his wife, Anne, having died at their ch&acirc;teau of St Saturnin in the Auvergne shortly after making her last will and testament on 16 June 1524. She named Catherine de Medici as her heir, but left her most personal possessions to her husband, including her jewellery and household furnishings. Since Catherine later married Henri, duc d'Orl&eacute;ans, the future Henri II, her French inheritance eventually passed to the French crown.<br>
<br>Albany had little time to mourn his wife, as he was soon obliged to join Fran&ccedil;ois I's ill-fated Italian campaign of 1525 against Charles V. The king made two disastrous decisions. The first was to lay siege to Pavia, where on 24 February 1525 his army was crushingly defeated and he himself was captured. The second was to detach 6000 troops from his army and send them south under Albany in a bid to conquer the kingdom of Naples. The duke's performance has been condemned as unimpressive:<blockquote>If Albany had moved faster, he might have conquered Naples, which was in a rebellious state, but he moved at snail's pace, allowing himself to become embroiled in Sienese politics. His expedition, however, did help to win the pope over to the French side. (Knecht, 216&#150;17)</blockquote>Albany got no further than Rome, and it is inconceivable that while staying there he did not visit his niece; indeed, it was probably during this period that the duke approached Clement VII with a proposal that Catherine de Medici should marry James V.<br>
<br>From Rome Albany and his men set off back north, but they had only reached Formello, a few miles from the city, when news of the disaster at Pavia arrived, whereupon they quickly retraced their steps to Rome. According to the English ambassador John Clerk, &#145;some 200 of them were killed near the town&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 4/1, no. 1085), but though they were hunted by the imperialists the pope, mindful that Albany had married a kinswoman, took steps to save the rest; most of Albany's men were eventually able to take ship for France from Civitavecchia, and disembarked with their commander at Marseilles in April 1525.<h2>
<a name="ServantoftheFrenchcrown"></a>Servant of the French crown</h2>It appears that shortly after Albany's return to France from Italy the Scots attempted to reactivate his governorship: Louise of Savoy, regent in the absence of King Fran&ccedil;ois, regretted that his services could not be spared. When he was not on campaign Albany devoted himself to the administration of his estates, but he clearly interested himself in Scottish affairs, for when he next appears in the record, on 17 September 1526, it is as a correspondent of Cardinal Wolsey, offering to serve the latter in the interests of peace between England and Scotland. It seems unlikely that he anticipated a particularly close involvement in the conduct of Anglo-Scottish relations, and he must have received a shock the following spring, when his cousin Fran&ccedil;ois, vicomte de Turenne, wrote to him in cipher to say that Wolsey had told him that the queen of Scots wished to retire to France; there the king's aid would be enlisted in her campaign to obtain a divorce from the earl of Angus, after which Margaret would be free to marry Albany himself. The news must have been all the more surprising because Margaret had previously asked Albany to assist her in securing a divorce so that she could marry Henry Stewart, the treasurer of her household, who in fact eventually became her third husband. Nevertheless, Turenne repeated the news in a second letter, reporting that it had also greatly embarrassed and displeased Henry VIII. Probably the report was a <i>canard</i>, for having finally obtained her divorce (with Albany's help, both financial and diplomatic), Margaret quickly married Henry Stewart.<br>
<br>Albany remained a soldier in the service of the French crown. Thus on 13 August 1527 he was paid 180 livres tournois for the previous three months as the captain of sixty lances, and he was also a member of the king's military order of St Michel. But it would seem that he never ceased to concern himself with the welfare of James V and the kingdom of Scotland, to the extent that the possibility of his return could never be discounted. There was probably an inherent plausibility to the rumour which the earl of Angus communicated to Henry VIII at the end of 1527, that Albany was trying to secure an English safe conduct, &#145;to return to trouble Scotland&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 4/2, no. 3704), and to the similar stories which James V reported to Fran&ccedil;ois shortly afterwards, telling how Albany and his kinsman Robert Stuart, seigneur d'Aubigny, had been hiring ships and sending them to Scotland.<br>
<br>Notwithstanding his genuine affection for and sense of obligation to James V, and his services as tutor and governor of Scotland during the young king's minority, devoted service to the French crown lay at the heart of Albany's whole life. That service was both military and diplomatic. As a soldier he lacked flair, but he was a good and just leader of men, as he showed by the skill with which he handled fractious Scottish magnates, something appreciated and attested by the Scottish lords themselves. In truth he was a much better talker than fighter, possessing all the patience, endurance, and consummate <i>politesse</i> required of a diplomat, as he showed in his numerous attempts to negotiate Anglo-Scottish treaties or truces. Between 1530 and 1533 he showed the same skills in his dealings on behalf of Fran&ccedil;ois, when he acted as the chief negotiator for the marriage of his niece Catherine de Medici and the duc d'Orl&eacute;ans. On 23 September 1530 John Stokesley, English ambassador in France, reported to Henry VIII from Lyons how he had recently &#145;met the duke of Albany going with threescore horse to fetch his niece from Florence, to be married in France, as is pretended&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 4/3, no. 6633). The negotiations were protracted and complicated&#151;there were numerous interests to be taken into account&#151;but in mid-August 1533 Albany finally returned to Italy to escort Catherine to France for her wedding. She and her attendants arrived on 6 September at La Spezia, where Albany (who also displayed impressive organizing skills) had provided a fleet of ships, some of which departed the same day for Villefranche. There Catherine and her train waited while Albany and the rest of the fleet picked up Clement VII, accompanied by thirteen cardinals and numerous prelates and officials, before returning to Villefranche on 6 October. On the 9th the entire party set sail for Marseilles, where it arrived two days later. Finally on 27 October the marriage contract was signed by Clement and Fran&ccedil;ois, and next day the young couple (both aged fourteen) were married by the pope, in a ceremony followed by a great banquet, a masked ball, and festivities which lasted for days.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsanddeath"></a>Last years and death</h2>Albany's services notwithstanding, Fran&ccedil;ois ensured that his son and daughter-in-law made the most of their rights in the Auvergne and other lands to which the duke himself had a claim. On 12 October 1534 the king formally barred Albany's rights in many of the Bourbon lands he claimed in the right of his late wife. Those in Picardy were denied to him, as were the fruits of Auvergne since the death of his father-in-law, and he was even required to hand over to Orl&eacute;ans all the furnishings in the ch&acirc;teaux on the de la Tour lands. In the end Albany had to be satisfied with less than half his claims. However, he had no legitimate heir whose interests he could advance or protect; his closest relation in France, apart from Catherine, was his half-brother Philippe de la Chambre, whom the pope made a cardinal during the wedding celebrations at Marseilles on 7 November 1533; he took the title of cardinal de Boulogne.<br>
<br>Albany's last involvement in dynastic politics involved the marriage of James V, who under the treaty of Rouen was to marry a daughter of Fran&ccedil;ois. Other European rulers offered sisters or daughters, but James was set on a French bride. However, the French king could not bear to part with his daughter Madeleine, and instead suggested Marie, daughter of the duc de Vend&ocirc;me. Albany (who was still the heir presumptive to the Scottish throne) had no alternative to offer, and on 3 March 1536 Fran&ccedil;ois therefore signed letters of credence for his ambassadors to negotiate James's marriage to Marie. Albany acted for the Scottish king and signed the marriage contract as his cousin's representative at Cr&eacute;mieu on 6 March, and also the confirmation of it on the 29th. In the event James married Madeleine rather than Marie, but she died shortly after landing in Scotland.<br>
<br>By March 1536 Albany seems to have been ill. Shortly afterwards he retired to his estates, and died at his ch&acirc;teau of Mirefleur in the Auvergne on 2 June 1536. He was buried next to his wife at the Sainte Chapelle, Ch&acirc;teau de Vic-le-Comte, in a place marked by an inscription. There is no evidence for the survival of a will, but in any case the French king had ensured that the duke's French lands and titles were inherited by his own daughter-in-law, Catherine de Medici, and her husband. It is not known if he left anything to his only child, the comtesse de Choisy, but it seems unlikely that he had much left to bequeath after the French crown had taken its due.<br>
<br>Among British historians Albany's regency in Scotland has always been regarded as the single most important episode in his career. Yet in a French context, of no less importance is the role he played from 1530 as tutor for his niece Catherine, and in the subsequent negotiations and arrangements for her marriage, and it may well be that further research, especially the analysis of the substantial corpus of his letters surviving in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale de France, will lead to a greater appreciation of his importance as a servant of the French monarchy, as both courtier and diplomat. The first detailed biography of Albany described him in its title as &#145;the Scot who was a Frenchman&#146;; it remains to be seen whether he would not be more justly described as the Frenchman who was also a Scot.<br>
