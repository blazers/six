<span class="headword">Larminie,  William</span>  (1849&#150;1900), <span class="occ">poet and folklorist</span>, was born on 1 August 1849 at Castlebar, co. Mayo, the fourth child and second surviving son of William Larminie (1796&#150;1856) and his wife, Bridget 
    (Beda; 1812&#150;1903)
  , third daughter of Colonel John Jackson of Ballina, co. Mayo. The Larminies were a family of Huguenot descent, settled in co. Mayo since 1721. On his father's death Larminie's maternal uncle, the Revd William Jackson, later archdeacon of Killala, helped the family to move to Wicklow and provided his nephews with a tutor. Larminie later attended Kingstown School and Trinity College, Dublin, from which he graduated in 1871 with a moderatorship in classics.<br>
<br>Larminie joined the India Office in 1873 as a junior clerk in the store department, and his mother moved to England, keeping house for him in Anerley, Upper Norwood. However, Larminie, who had been writing poetry since adolescence, decided to retire from the civil service in 1887, and devote himself to folklore collecting and to literature. His mother, described by William Kirkpatrick Magee (John Eglinton) as &#145;brilliant and picturesque&#146; and by Douglas Hyde as &#145;a terrible old woman&#146;  (Eglinton, 14), was angered by this decision, for which she never forgave him; however, she returned with her son to Bray, co. Wicklow, where they lived in some comfort at 2 Prince of Wales Terrace, despite Larminie's not having qualified for a pension. Larminie, who had learned Irish, had begun to collect oral folk tales in the west of Ireland in 1884 with the help of a friend, James Lecky. Larminie translated and edited a selection, <span class="italic">West Irish Folk-Tales and Romances</span>, in 1893; he had already allowed Douglas Hyde to use two of his orally collected tales in <span class="italic">Leabhar sgeulaighteachta</span> (1889). W. B. Yeats reviewed Larminie's collection very favourably, describing it as having &#145;the extravagance and tumultuous movement as of waves in a storm&#146;  (Yeats, <span class="italic">Uncollected Prose</span>, 1.328), and one of Larminie's folk tales also provided the source for part of Yeats's poem &#145;The Secret Rose&#146; (1896). Hyde, who greatly admired Larminie's pioneering work and his respect for the specificity of the oral folk tale, described him as &#145;the most under-rated man in Ireland&#146;  (Eglinton, 13).<br>
<br>In 1889 Larminie published his first collection of poetry, <span class="italic">Glanlua and other Poems</span>, a volume which, like Yeats's <span class="italic">The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems</span> (1889), sought to continue the tradition of Sir Samuel Ferguson's <span class="italic">Congal</span> (1872) and to realize Irish mythological subjects in English verse. In 1892 a second volume, <span class="italic">Fand and other Poems</span>, also containing much verse based on Irish mythological and legendary material, followed. Larminie also attempted to introduce prosodic forms (such as assonance) from Irish poetry into English poetry, without conspicuous success, despite the concern with prosody demonstrated in his essay &#145;The development of English metre&#146; (1894).<br>
<br>From the mid-1890s onwards, Larminie's principal concern was with his projected translation of John Scottus Eriugena's <span class="italic">De divisione naturae</span>. In 1897 he published an article on Eriugena, &#145;our Irish Plato&#146;, claiming him as the forerunner of German idealist philosophy&#151;and therefore modern philosophy  (W. Larminie, &#145;Joannes Scotus Erigena&#146;, <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>, April 1897, 558). In December 1897 he began to publish his translation of Eriugena in <span class="italic">The Internationalist</span>, the journal of the Dublin Theosophical Society, of which he was a member. By 1898 he was well enough known to be recommended by Yeats to T. P. Gill as a potential contributor to the Dublin <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> in its brief nationalist phase. Yeats, who thought Larminie a &#145;bad but wildly eccentric poet&#146;, had been very impressed by Larminie's two articles on Norse and Irish mythology, published in the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> in October and November 1895, which Yeats thought showed Larminie to be &#145;a profound Celtic folk lorist&#146; and &#145;more philosophical than Hyde&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Letters of W. B. Yeats</span>, 2.307, 268). Larminie did write for the <span class="italic">Express</span> during the orchestrated cultural nationalist controversy of autumn 1898 and his contribution was reprinted by George Russell in <span class="italic">Literary Ideals in Ireland</span> (1899) as &#145;Legends as materials for literature&#146;.<br>
<br>William Kirkpatrick Magee (John Eglinton), a fellow theosophist, who was probably Larminie's closest friend, described him as &#145;a tall handsome man, something of the Parnell type&#146;, and reported Beda Larminie's pride in her son's good looks  (Eglinton, 12). John Eglinton, who spent most Sundays walking with Larminie in the Wicklow hills, feared that his return to Ireland (or rather to Bray) had been unwise and that the initial excitement and sense of released creativity, on his return to &#145;the enchanted strand&#146;  (&#145;The Finding of Hy Brasil&#146;, <span class="italic">Glanlua</span>, 72), had diminished; however, John Eglinton, who confessed to having never read his friend's verse, was vehemently opposed to the use of Irish mythological materials in modern writing. He recalled Larminie as:<blockquote>a somewhat forlorn figure in Bray, where I have heard him characterized briefly as a &#145;queer fish&#146;: he was in fact a fairly normal, thoughtful, utterly unpretentious human being &hellip; the &#145;return of the native&#146; was in his case as complete a failure as in Hardy's novel, and shortly before his last illness he confessed to me that time hung very heavily with him. (Eglinton, 15)</blockquote>Larminie was coming into closer contact with the leading figures of the Irish literary revival at the close of his life and was a vice-president of the National Literary Society of Ireland from 1896 to 1899. He died of pneumonia following influenza at his home, 2 Prince of Wales Terrace, in Bray, co. Wicklow, on 19 January 1900, and was buried in Enniskerry churchyard, there being no protestant cemetery at Bray. He had retained the respect of contemporaries such as George Russell and Yeats. Russell wrote a eulogistic account of his verse for Brooke and Rolleston's <span class="italic">A Treasury of Irish Poetry in the English Tongue</span> (1900) expressing his bewilderment that Larminie's &#145;many and great gifts as an imaginative poet, should have been so coldly received&#146;  (p. 476). Yeats, in 1919, arranged for his wife to inspect the manuscript of Larminie's translation of Eriugena deposited in the National Library of Ireland, a manuscript which John O'Meara called &#145;a pathetic testimony to his great interest and our indifference&#146;  (O'Meara, 90).<br>
