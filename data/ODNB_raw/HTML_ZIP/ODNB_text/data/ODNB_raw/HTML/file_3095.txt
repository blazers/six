<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boxall, Sir  William</span>  (1800&#150;1879), <span class="occ">portrait painter and museum director</span>, was born on 29 June 1800 in or near Oxford, the son of Thomas Boxall, clerk to the collector of excise, and the brother of Anne (<i>d</i>. 1846), later wife of the Revd Charles Boxall Longland. He was educated at Abingdon grammar school and entered the Royal Academy Schools on 26 March 1819, having already exhibited <span class="italic">Portrait of a Lady</span> at the academy in 1818. In order to study the old masters he made several study trips to Italy, for instance in 1827&#150;8, 1833&#150;6, and 1845. Hoping to establish himself as a history painter he early on painted scenes from mythology, religious texts, and English literature, for example, <span class="italic">Jupiter and Latona</span> (exh. RA, 1823), <span class="italic">The Contention of Michael and Satan for the Body of Moses</span> (exh. RA, 1824), and <span class="italic">Lear and Cordelia</span> (exh. RA, 1831). Of his allegorical works <span class="italic">Hope</span> (exh. RA, 1840) was considered the best. He also painted a few landscapes, including <span class="italic">View of the Turl with Exeter, Lincoln and Jesus Colleges and All Saints' Church, Oxford</span> (exh. RA, 1827).<br>
<br>In search of regular employment Boxall turned increasingly to portraiture and enjoyed some reputation in this field between the mid-1830s and the 1860s. He painted society celebrities and hostesses; leading literary, artistic, and intellectual figures of the day, such as his friend William Wordsworth (1831; NPG); and several high-ranking clergymen. His most important commission was a full-length portrait, <span class="italic">The Prince Consort as Master of the Trinity House</span> (exh. RA, 1859; Trinity House, London). His portraits were rarely acclaimed as good likenesses and sometimes criticized for their lack of finish; several were reproduced as mezzotints by Samuel Cousins. On 3 November 1851 he was elected an associate of the Royal Academy, and in 1863 a full academician (retiring from the academy in 1877); he exhibited eighty-six works at the academy between 1818 and 1880, eleven at the British Institution, and seven at the Society of British Artists in Suffolk Street. He was also elected an honorary academician of the Academy of San Fernando, Madrid, in 1868.<br>
<br>In February 1866 Boxall was appointed director of the National Gallery, succeeding Sir Charles Eastlake; thereafter he virtually ceased to paint. He may have been Eastlake's nominee and certainly was proposed by Gladstone. However, he was not the only, nor the preferred, candidate: the prime minister suggested Austen Henry Layard (under-secretary at the Foreign Office) and Queen Victoria proposed John Charles Robinson (superintendent of art at the South Kensington Museum); Edwin Landseer's name also was put forward. As director Boxall journeyed frequently through Europe to study and make notes on galleries and collections and also to survey pictures for potential acquisition (his papers remain in the National Gallery). He acquired several important paintings during his eight-year tenure, notably Carlo Crivelli's <span class="italic">Demidoff Altarpiece</span>, in 1868; Michelangelo's <span class="italic">Virgin and Child with Saint John and Angels</span> (the &#145;Manchester Madonna&#146;), in 1870; and Mantegna's <span class="italic">Introduction of the Cult of Cybele at Rome</span>, in 1873. He also increased the gallery's collection of Dutch seventeenth-century paintings, buying Pieter de Hooch's <span class="italic">Woman and her Maid in a Courtyard</span> in 1869 and successfully negotiating the acquisition of Sir Robert Peel's collection in 1871. Two of his purchases caused controversy: the authenticity of both <span class="italic">Christ Blessing the Children</span> (the &#145;Suermondt Rembrandt&#146;, now attributed to Nicolaes Maes) and Michelangelo's <span class="italic">Entombment</span> was questioned in the House of Lords in 1869. During his directorship the gallery was reconstructed and extended by Edward Middleton Barry RA.<br>
<br>In 1871 Boxall expressed his wish to retire on account of ill health (he often complained of lameness and seems to have suffered from depression), but he was persuaded to stay on by the trustees and the prime minister until 20 February 1874. He aided the successful candidature of Fredric Burton as his successor. A close friend from the early 1850s of Eastlake and his wife, Lady Elizabeth (whose portrait he painted in 1854), Boxall acted as one of Eastlake's executors after his death. Subsequently, in 1867, he acquired, through Lady Eastlake, nine paintings from her late husband's collection, including Piero della Francesca's <span class="italic">St Michael</span> and Pisanello's <span class="italic">Virgin and Child with Saint George and Saint Anthony Abbot</span>, and also his library. Together with Lady Eastlake, Boxall also ensured that his predecessor's travel journals were collated and transcribed, and a copy deposited in the National Gallery.<br>
<br>Boxall received the degree of DCL from Oxford University in 1870, and a knighthood was conferred on him on 24 March 1871; he was also a fellow of the Royal Society. In character he was solitary and sensitive; his principal companion in his last years was his dog, Garibaldi. Among his closest friends were the sculptor John Gibson (for whom he acted as executor in 1864) and the painters Landseer and Thomas Webster. Boxall died, unmarried, at his home in London&#151;14 Welbeck Street, Cavendish Square&#151;on 6 December 1879, partly from congestion of the lungs, and was buried six days later at Kensal Green cemetery. The contents of his studio were auctioned at Christies on 8 June 1880.<br>
