<span class="headword">Mayo,  Herbert</span>  (1796&#150;1852), <span class="occ">physiologist and anatomist</span>, third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18459/', "John Mayo (1761&#150;1818)")</script>, physician, and his wife, Ann, daughter of Thomas Cock, was born in Queen Anne Street, London, on 3 April 1796. His brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18462/', "Thomas Mayo")</script>, became president of the Royal College of Physicians. Mayo entered the Middlesex Hospital, London, as a surgical pupil on 17 May 1814. He was also a pupil of Charles Bell between 1812 and 1815. He studied medicine at Leiden; his MD thesis, &#145;De urethra ejusque constrictione&#146;, was published in Leiden in 1818. In 1818 he became house-surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital; in 1819 he became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. He was a surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital from 1827 until 1842, was professor of anatomy and surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1828 and 1829, became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1828, was a professor of anatomy at King's College in 1830, became professor of physiology and pathological anatomy at King's College in 1836, and became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1843. He is credited with founding the medical school at Middlesex Hospital. He married Jessica Matilda, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/683/', "Samuel James Arnold")</script>, dramatist. They had a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Mayo discovered that the seventh cranial nerve is the nerve the activity of which causes the muscles of the face to move&#151;that is, it is the motor nerve of the face. He also discovered that the fifth cranial nerve is the nerve that conveys sensation from the face to the brain&#151;that is, it is the chief sensory nerve of the face. Beyond that, he showed that the fifth cranial nerve has two connections to the brain (roots), and that one root is motor and that the other, sensory, root has a ganglion (a collection of nerve cells). In his report of those findings (<span class="italic">Anatomical and Physiological Commentaries</span>, 1822, 107&#150;20), Mayo remarked that he had been led to perform his experiments by reading Charles Bell's report of similar experiments, and added eight pages of unsparing criticism of Bell's methods and conclusions. Bell was later to claim that he had correctly described the function of the nerves of the face and that he had shown that only sensory nerves have a ganglion.<br>
<br>In 1823 Mayo published the second part of the <span class="italic">Anatomical and Physiological Commentaries</span>, in which he reported that stimulation of the optic nerve (the nerve that conveys visual sensation from the eye to the brain) resulted in narrowing of the pupil of the eye, even if the optic nerve and the nerve to the pupil were connected only by that small part of the central nervous system to which the optic nerve travels and from which a nerve travels to the pupil (<span class="italic">Commentaries</span>, 1823, 1&#150;21). In a later generalization he said that &#145;an influence may be propagated from the sentient nerves of a part, to their correspondent nerves of motion, through the intervention of that part alone of the nervous centre, to which they are mutually attached&#146;  (<span class="italic">Commentaries</span>, 1823, 135). Mayo was thus not only the first to discover what we would now call reflex action, but also the first to point out its general significance for the function of the nervous system. Charles Sherrington, perhaps the greatest neurophysiologist of all time and certainly the greatest authority on the reflex, referred to &#145;Mayo's celebrated experiment&#146;, and said that it went far &#145;to draw attention to the fractional powers of the cerebro-spinal organ&#146;  (Sherrington, 786).<br>
<br>Mayo's <span class="italic">Commentaries</span> also contain useful translations from the German of the anatomical studies of the brain by J. C. Reil, as well as reporting other important findings made by Mayo, including his discovery that the walls of arteries contain muscle fibres, the contraction or relaxation of which changes the diameter of the artery. Mayo published several other books and pamphlets, including <span class="italic">Outlines of Human Pathology</span>, which was published in London in 1835, in Philadelphia in 1841, and in translation in Germany in 1838&#150;9.<br>
<br>Following in the footsteps of James Braid, James Esdaile and John Elliotson, Mayo became convinced of the reality and clinical usefulness of mesmerism. His views, like those of his predecessors, were often greeted with scorn and contempt; the author of the entry on Mayo in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> spoke of Mayo as having &#145;thrown himself in the hands of the mesmerists&#146;. In his <span class="italic">Letters on the Truths Contained in Popular Superstitions</span> (1849) Mayo wrote that &#145;As it is certain that there is no disease, which the nervous system is not primarily or secondarily implicated in, it is impossible to foresee what will prove the limit of the beneficial application of mesmerism in practice&#146;  (Mayo, <span class="italic">Letters on the Truths</span>, 138). By 1842 Mayo was disabled by rheumatic gout, sought and found relief in hydropathy, and ended his career as a physician at Bad Weilbach, Germany, where he died on 15 May 1852.<br>
<br>Mayo was a distinguished scientist who made discoveries of great importance and was a major figure in British medicine during the nineteenth century. During his lifetime his reputation unquestionably suffered from Charles Bell's temporarily successful effort to claim that he had made certain discoveries that were in fact made by Mayo and by Fran&ccedil;ois Magendie. Mayo's later reputation was not enhanced by his entry in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> which is curiously defensive and ambivalent.<br>
