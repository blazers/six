<span class="headword">Durant,  Susan Durant</span>  (1827&#150;1873), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born in Stamford Hill, Middlesex, on 8 July 1827, the second daughter of George Durant (1784&#150;1872), silkbroker, and his wife, Mary Dugdale (<i>fl</i>. 1788&#150;1861), both of whom were from Devon. Susan Durant became interested in sculpture when spending a winter in Rome with her parents as a young girl, and decided to adopt it as a profession. She studied with the French sculptor Baron Henri de Triqueti (1804&#150;1874), remaining his pupil and assistant throughout her life, making frequent trips to his Paris studio though maintaining an independent studio in London. In 1847 Durant received the Society of Art's prestigious silver Isis medal for an original portrait bust in plaster. This may have been one of two she exhibited in the Royal Academy that year; she subsequently exhibited almost every year until her death.<br>
<br>From her large social circle in London Durant obtained a clientele for commissions and models for portraits, usually in marble, such as <span class="italic">George Grote</span>, the historian, whose wife campaigned for women's rights (exh. RA, 1863; University College, London). Often her subject was the active woman, for example, <span class="italic">Harriet Beecher Stowe</span> (exh. RA, 1857; plaster version, Castle Howard; marble, Harriet Beecher Stowe Center, Hartford, Connecticut) and <span class="italic">Ruth</span> (exh. RA, 1869; priv. coll. France). Her early neo-classical works, for example her self-portrait (exh. RA, 1853), reflecting her Roman studies, gave way to a more naturalistic style influenced by Triqueti, sometimes incorporating his polychromatic marble inlay technique, as in <span class="italic">Nina Lehmann</span> (1871; priv. coll.). She exhibited two &#145;ideal&#146; subjects in the Great Exhibition of 1851, and lent <span class="italic">Robin Hood</span> (exh. RA, 1856; Society of Female Artists, 1858) to the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester.<br>
<br>In 1866 a contemporary described Durant as &#145;a tall and very comely young woman &hellip; with rounded limbs &hellip; flashing face and massive rippling chestnut hair &hellip; superbly drest [in Paris fashions presumably] &hellip; full of graceful fun&#146;  (Dunford, 89). Charismatic, at ease in society, she charmed all her clients, especially the ageing Grote, and certainly her master, Triqueti. She had a private income but chose to conduct her career on a professional basis to avoid accusations of amateurism and to enhance her status as an artist. She ran her elderly father's household, even from Paris. She supported women's access to the vote, education, and the professions. In 1863 she was the only woman out of fourteen sculptors commissioned by the corporation of London to execute figures from English literature for the Mansion House. Her <span class="italic">Faithful Shepherdess</span> (exh. RA, 1863) earned her &pound;500, was compared favourably with entries by her male competitors, and was &#145;the first important commission for a public work of sculpture given to a lady in this country&#146;  (<span class="italic">ILN</span>, 1863, 587).<br>
<br>Soon afterwards Triqueti introduced Durant into the royal circle and she received a succession of commissions from Queen Victoria including high-relief marble medallions of the queen, Prince Albert, and their children for the Albert Chapel, Windsor Castle (exh. RA, 1866&#150;9; plaster and marble versions, Royal Collection, Osborne; bronze reductions, NPG). Durant worked regularly at Windsor, Osborne, and Potsdam, and taught Princess Louise sculpture, becoming a royal favourite. She captured naturalistic details of hair, features, and costume and enjoyed a facility for achieving a likeness which was recognized by contemporary critics and appreciated by the queen and her family. Durant's most important commission was that from Queen Victoria for a monument to King Leopold of the Belgians for St George's Chapel, Windsor. This monument of the recumbent king with his hand resting on a lion, and behind him two low-relief angels holding the shields of England and Belgium was installed to the queen's satisfaction and to critical acclaim in 1867, but removed in 1879 to the recently renamed Leopold Room in Christ Church, Esher.<br>
<br>At the height of her career, and having completed a further portrait of Queen Victoria for the Inner Temple (exh. RA, 1872), Durant was struck down by ill health. She died of pleurisy on 1 January 1873, in Paris, and was buried in P&egrave;re Lachaise cemetery. She was unmarried. Her early death was regretted by her royal clients and many friends, some of whose unfinished portraits remained in her studio. One, <span class="italic">Dr Elizabeth Garrett Anderson</span>, formed her last Royal Academy exhibit that year. Susan Durant left provision in her will for an infant, Henry Paul Harvey Durant [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73039/', "Harvey, Sir (Henry) Paul")</script>], who was her child by Triqueti.<br>
