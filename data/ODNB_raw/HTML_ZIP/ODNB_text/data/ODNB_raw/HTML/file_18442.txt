<span class="headword">Mayne,  John</span>  (1759&#150;1836), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at Dumfries, on 26 March 1759. Having been educated in the local grammar school he became a printer in the office of the <span class="italic">Dumfries Journal</span>. In 1782 he accompanied his family to Glasgow, where he was engaged for five years in the publishing house of the brothers Foulis. In 1787 he settled in London, first as a printer and then as proprietor and joint editor of <span class="italic">The Star</span>, an evening paper in which he inserted several of his poems. He married, but it is unclear when or to whom. He had written poetry while in Dumfries, and after 1777 he occasionally contributed poems to <span class="italic">Ruddiman's Weekly Magazine</span> in Edinburgh. Sher notes that &#145;Robert Fergusson was certainly a great influence. It is said that they met in Dumfries when Mayne was just 14 &hellip; and Fergusson at most 23&#146;  (Sher, 193). Between 1807 and 1817 several of Mayne's lyrics appeared in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>Mayne's <span class="italic">Siller Gun</span> (1777) describes the celebration of an ancient Dumfries custom, first instituted by James VI and revived in 1777, of shooting for the prize of a silver gun on the king's birthday. Enlarged to two cantos in 1779, and to three and four in 1780 and 1808 respectively, it took final shape in five cantos, with notes, in 1836. Scott considered it superior to anything of Fergusson's and approaching the excellence of Burns  (<span class="italic">The Poetical Works of Sir Walter Scott</span>, 1894, 307). Mayne's <span class="italic">Hallowe'en</span>, published in November 1780, probably stimulated Burns's brilliant treatment of the same theme. &#145;Logan braes&#146;, which appeared in <span class="italic">The Star</span> (23 May 1789), fooled Burns into thinking it a vagrant of an early master and he appropriated two of its lines in a &#145;Logan braes&#146; of his own. &#145;Glasgow&#146;, a poem of description and characterization published in the <span class="italic">Glasgow Magazine</span> in December 1783, is described by Sher as &#145;subtle and genuine&#146;  (Sher, 199); it was enlarged and issued, less successfully, in 1803. In the same year Mayne published a patriotic address entitled &#145;English, Scots, and Irishmen&#146;. Though Mayne expressed a desire to revisit Dumfries he never realized this ambition and he died at his home 2 Lisson Grove, Marylebone, Middlesex, on 14 March 1836. He was buried in Paddington churchyard. Much admired by contemporaries, on his death he was (surely over-) praised by the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> as being second only to Burns among Scottish poets.<br>
