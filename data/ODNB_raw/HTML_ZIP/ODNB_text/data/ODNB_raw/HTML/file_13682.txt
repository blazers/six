<span class="headword">Hood,  Thomas <span class="st"> [Tom; </span></span> <span class="st"> <em>known as </em>Thomas Hood the younger]</span>  (1835&#150;1874), <span class="occ">humorist and journal editor</span>, was born on 19 January 1835 at Lake House, Wanstead, Essex, the son of the poet and humorist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13681/', "Thomas Hood (1799&#150;1845)")</script> and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Reynolds (1791&#150;1846). After the death of his parents, Hood was supported by a civil-list pension. He attended the University College School in London, then Louth grammar school, and finally Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1853. He passed his examinations, but ran up huge debts, and never received his degree.<br>
<br>Living in Cornwall from 1856 to 1859, Hood wrote for and then edited the <span class="italic">Liskeard Gazette</span>. A collection of humorous writing, <span class="italic">Pen and Pencil Pictures</span>, appeared in 1857. Three years later he and his sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3477/', "Frances Broderip (1830&#150;1878)")</script> published their father's <span class="italic">Memorials</span> (1860). After friends found Hood a position in the War Office, he became a London literary jack of all trades, publishing <span class="italic">Quips and Cranks</span> (1861), a poetry collection entitled <span class="italic">The Daughters of King Daher</span> (1861), illustrations for children's books written by his sister, a reissue of his father's 1839 collection <span class="italic">Hood's Own</span> (1861), and contributions to such periodicals as <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">Comic News</span>, and <span class="italic">Temple Bar</span>.<br>
<br>Hood was best known as a writer, an illustrator, and ultimately the editor for the weekly penny comic paper <span class="italic">Fun</span>. A contributor almost from its inception in September 1861, he replaced H. J. Byron as editor in May 1865. Hood's staff included Ambrose Bierce, E. L. Blanchard, Matt Morgan, George Rose (&#145;Arthur Sketchley&#146;), the dramatist T. W. Robertson, and W. S. Gilbert, whose &#145;Bab Ballads&#146; first appeared in <span class="italic">Fun</span>. Hood edited <span class="italic">Fun</span> until he died, making it <span class="italic">Punch's</span> foremost competitor.<br>
<br>Hood issued various collections of his father's works, and wrote fiction, including the sensation novels <span class="italic">A Disputed Inheritance</span> (1863), <span class="italic">Vere Vereker's Vengeance</span> (1865), <span class="italic">Captain Masters's Children</span> (1865), <span class="italic">A Golden Heart</span> (1867), <span class="italic">The Lost Link</span> (1868), and <span class="italic">Love and Valour</span> (1871), the last containing Oxford scenes which may be partly autobiographical. <span class="italic">Tom Hood's Comic Annual</span> began appearing in 1867, and he edited collections of anecdotes, comic readings, stories, and puzzles for children. <span class="italic">The Rules of Rhyme</span> (1869) was frequently reprinted.<br>
<br>As a writer and illustrator, Hood was prolific but seldom more than competent. He was more impressive as an editor and champion of his father's reputation. Hood was tall, handsome, and famously convivial. Literary friends recalled fondly his Friday suppers in his lodgings in Brompton during the 1860s. Other contemporaries saw Hood as proof that literary greatness cannot be inherited, and attributed his early death to dissipation.<br>
<br>Hood's first wife, Susan, often called &#145;Mrs Tom&#146;, died in 1873, aged thirty-seven. He married his second wife, Justine Rudolphine Charotton (<i>b</i>. 1844/5) on 15 August 1874, only a few months before his death at his home, Gloucester Cottage, Peckham Rye, on 20 November 1874, from a liver ailment. He was buried in Nunhead cemetery.<br>
