<span class="headword">Mainwaring, Sir  Henry</span>  (1586/7&#150;1653), <span class="occ">pirate and naval officer</span>, was the second son of Sir George Mainwaring (<i>d</i>. 1628) MP, of Ightfield, Shropshire, and Anne (<i>d</i>. 1624), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37781/', "Sir William More MP")</script>, and his second wife, Margaret. The Mainwarings were well established in Shropshire and Cheshire. Mainwaring matriculated aged twelve at Brasenose College, Oxford, on 27 April 1599, graduated BA on 15 July 1602, and was admitted to the Inner Temple in November 1604. He was granted (but did not take up) the reversion of the captaincy of St Andrew's Castle on 10 June 1611, was appointed to suppress piracy in the Bristol Channel in 1612, and was chosen to accompany Sir Thomas Sherley to Persia, though Spain, fearing that the real objective was the West Indies, blocked the mission.<br>
<br>The rebuff incited Mainwaring to embark on a campaign of piracy, directed principally against Spain. He soon reigned supreme on the Barbary coast. Spain tried unsuccessfully to buy him off, and then took advantage of his absence on a voyage to Newfoundland in 1614 to seize his base at Marmora. Mainwaring transferred to Villefranca and defeated a Spanish fleet in 1615. Complaints from France and Spain reached such a pitch that James I gave him the choice of a pardon or of facing an expedition. Mainwaring would not fight his countrymen, accepted a pardon on 9 June 1616, and subsequently wrote his <span class="italic">Discourse on Piracy</span>, which is full of sound common sense.<br>
<br>Although he hated pirates the king was attracted to Mainwaring, knighting him on 20 March 1618 and appointing him a gentleman of the bedchamber. Despite this post and the gains from piracy, however, Mainwaring had financial problems and he needed employment. In 1618&#150;19 plans for him to enter the service of Venice fell through, but Lord Zouche, the lord warden of the Cinque Ports, although allegedly warned not to do so, appointed him lieutenant of Dover Castle early in 1620. He also joined the Virginia Company. Mainwaring undertook his duties as lieutenant seriously, which the corporation of Dover recognized in 1621 by electing him to parliament, where he spoke on issues which affected the Cinque Ports. At Dover he wrote his <span class="italic">Seaman's Dictionary</span>, the first authoritative treatise on seamanship, published eventually in 1644. But he made enemies in the Cinque Ports and, worse, alienated Zouche, who demanded his resignation on 17 March 1623. Prince Charles intervened on his behalf, but when Zouche surrendered his post to the duke of Buckingham, it was on condition that Mainwaring should not be given any post in the Cinque Ports.<br>
<br>In 1623 Mainwaring was flag captain of the <i>Prince Royal</i>, which brought home Prince Charles and Buckingham from their escapade to Spain in pursuit of a bride for the prince. He failed to secure re-election as MP in 1624 but did, however, secure Buckingham as patron and became one of the group of seamen around Buckingham. He was involved in preparing the abortive naval expeditions of the later 1620s, proposed the development of Portsmouth Dockyard, served on a commission of inquiry into the navy in 1626&#150;7, and was an elder brother of Trinity House by 1627. The assassination of Buckingham on 23 August 1628 deprived Mainwaring of his patron and ended a period of intense English naval activity. His father also died in 1628, leaving him nothing.<br>
<br>Mainwaring was among the suitors in 1629 for the hand of Elizabeth Bennett, widow of a wealthy City merchant, but he failed to find favour. The grant of an island off Brazil was also unproductive. About 1630 he married Fortune Gardiner (<i>bap</i>. 1607, <i>d</i>. 1633), but without the consent of her father, Sir Thomas Gardiner, who refused to allow him access to her portion until he settled &pound;100 per annum in land on her. They had a daughter, Christian (1633&#150;1639); Fortune died in December 1633 and Mainwaring's brother, Sir Arthur, became guardian of Christian until her death at the age of six.<br>
<br>After performing tasks ashore for the navy in the early 1630s Mainwaring served as a senior captain in the ship money fleets in 1637&#150;40, and was vice-admiral in 1639 in the <i>Henrietta Maria</i>. He remained impecunious and is said to have been outlawed for debt in December 1635. Although he failed to become surveyor of the navy in 1638, he was elected master of Trinity House in 1642. Parliament, however, distrusted him, and removed him from all offices in the corporation in November 1642.<br>
<br>Mainwaring went to the king's headquarters at Oxford and received the honorary degree of doctor of physic on 31 January 1643. Age and inexperience in land warfare must have kept him inactive in 1643&#150;4, but early in 1645 he was appointed captain of a ship which lay at Pendennis, ready to transport Prince Charles to the Isles of Scilly if he had to leave England, though the prince eventually travelled in another ship. In dire financial straits, Mainwaring settled first in Scilly, then in Jersey in 1646&#150;8, where he became a friend of Jean Chevalier, the chronicler of Jersey. He may have aroused there the interest of Prince Charles in ships and the sea. After the revolt of part of the parliamentary fleet to the king in the summer of 1648 Mainwaring was appointed captain of the <i>Antelope</i>, one of the rebel ships, but played no part in the subsequent operations under Rupert. He eventually made his peace with parliament in November 1651, when he was worth only &pound;8, and returned to England. Mainwaring was buried on 15 May 1653 in St Giles, Camberwell, where his wife was already interred.<br>
