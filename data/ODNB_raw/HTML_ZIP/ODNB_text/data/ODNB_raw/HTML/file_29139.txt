<span class="headword">Westphal,  Philip</span>  (1782&#150;1880), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the elder son of George Westphal, of a noble Hanoverian family, whose uncle was tutor to the duke of Kent, and his wife, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McGrigor, widow of Captain Bachop RN; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29138/', "Sir George Augustus Westphal")</script> was his younger brother. He entered the navy in 1794 under the patronage of the duke of Kent, on the <i>Oiseau</i> on the North American station. In 1796 he was successively in the <i>Albatross</i> and the <i>Shannon</i> on the home station, and from 1797 to 1800 in the <i>Asia</i> on the coast of North America. In 1801 he was in the <i>Blanche</i>, one of the frigates with Nelson at Copenhagen on 2 April. For his share in this action Westphal was promoted on 5 April to lieutenant of the <i>Defiance</i> (74 guns). In May 1802 he was appointed to the <i>Amazon</i> (38 guns; Captain William Parker) with Nelson off Toulon, and in his cruise to the West Indies in the spring of 1805, and in 1806 with Sir John Borlase Warren, when the French frigate <i>Belle Poule</i> surrendered to the <i>Amazon</i>. The first lieutenant of the <i>Amazon</i> having been killed in the action, Warren gave Westphal an acting order as captain of the <i>Belle Poule</i>, which he refitted and took to England. The Admiralty refused to confirm the acting order, and Westphal continued lieutenant of the <i>Amazon</i> until she was paid off in 1812.<br>
<br>Westphal was then appointed to the <i>Junon</i>, a 38-gun frigate, in which he had active service on the coast of North America. In January 1815 he was moved by Sir George Cockburn into his flagship, and on 13 June was at last promoted commander. In November 1828 he was appointed to the <i>Warspite</i> (76 guns), again with Sir William Parker; but, as Parker was very shortly afterwards appointed to the royal yacht, Westphal was moved to the <i>Kent</i> (78 guns), from which, on 22 July 1830, he was advanced to post rank. In 1847 he was retired on a Greenwich Hospital pension, becoming rear-admiral on 27 September 1855, vice-admiral on 4 October 1862, and admiral on 2 April 1866. He died, the oldest naval officer, on 16 March 1880 at Ryde, Isle of Wight, where he had settled in his retirement.<br>
