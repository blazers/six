<span class="headword">Kelly,  (Martha) Emily <span class="st"> [Pat]</span></span>  (1872/3&#150;1922), <span class="occ">mountaineer</span>, was the eldest sibling in a large family; details of her birth, parentage (and hence her maiden name), and education are not known. Growing up, she found herself responsible for &#145;more than the average girl's share of domestic duties&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pinnacle Club Journal</span>), and all her life she was known for her capacity for hard work combined with a natural organizational flair. These abilities stood her in good stead when later she became a businesswoman. By February 1917, when her will was drawn up, she was married to the celebrated cragsman Harry Mills Kelly (1884&#150;1980), with whom she was living at Levenshulme, Manchester. She shared an office in Manchester with her husband, an insurance clerk.<br>
<br>Pat Kelly began climbing at the beginning of 1914 and was apparently a graceful and bold balance climber. Her husband remarked that most of their climbing on local gritstone was done solo. She did so from choice&#151;wishing, as she said, &#145;to develop her own technique in her own way&#146;  (Clark and Pyatt, 159). Harry Kelly thought one of her most outstanding achievements was to climb solo Jones's route from Deep Ghyll in the Lake District; observers on Scafell pinnacle told him of their consternation on seeing this lonely figure coming up the ar&ecirc;te. Friends described her &#145;indomitable will&#146; and &#145;almost inexhaustible vitality&#146;, but also noted her warm-heartedness  (<span class="italic">Pinnacle Club Journal</span>).<br>
<br>Pat Kelly was dedicated to encouraging other women to overcome their natural timidity on rock. The idea of a women's rock-climbing club germinated naturally from this, and her drive and enthusiasm gradually brought it to fruition. Harry Kelly recalled how by 1920 their &#145;small office at 29 Fountain Street, Manchester, had become the seat of operations&#146;  (Angell, 3). A letter in the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> announcing the proposed formation of a club for women rock-climbers was boosted by an appreciative leader written by C. E. Montague (himself a climber). The inaugural meeting of the Pinnacle Club, the first dedicated rock-climbing club for women, was held at Pen-y-Gwryd in north Wales on 26 March 1921; its entry requirement was the ability to lead a &#145;difficult&#146; rock climb. The club started out with more than sixty members; its first honorary secretary was Pat Kelly, and Mrs Eleanor Winthrop Young its president.<br>
<br>As a young woman in the early 1890s Pat Kelly had readily identified with the mood of awakening feminine consciousness. Influenced by such writers as George Eliot, the Bront&euml;s, and Olive Schreiner, she read a paper on Eliot before a local literary society in which she defended &#145;her kind from the cheap male sneer that woman's only place is at home looking after the baby&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pinnacle Club Journal</span>). But contemporaries took pains to stress that no sex antagonism or rivalry fuelled her convictions. It was just that, when climbing with men, women hardly ever got to lead or to master the finer points of route finding, technique, or responsibility. Mrs Kelly's ambition was to provide an atmosphere of encouragement in which women and girls could discover and develop their own skills.<br>
<br>The accident which killed Pat Kelly occurred on 17 April, the last day of a club meet in north Wales at Easter 1922. No one saw what happened. She was discovered with head injuries at the foot of Tryfan, and with one boot missing, having fallen from apparently easy ground after other climbers had packed up for the night. She was taken to the Carnarvonshire and Anglesey Infirmary, Bangor, where she died from a fractured base of the skull on 26 April 1922, aged forty-nine.<br>
<br>It mystified all who knew her how so sure-footed a climber as Kelly could have fallen in this way. But sixty-six years later, when the history of the Pinnacle Club came to be written, an explanation finally emerged. Its author, Shirley Angell, was told that some months after the accident friends of Pat Kelly found the missing boot jammed immovably in rocks by one of its front nails. She was known to be experimenting with a new pattern of nails that day. Unused to them, she must have caught her foot during descent and been thrown off balance. The boot was clearly wrenched from her as she pitched headlong. Those who made the discovery vowed never to speak of it during the lifetime of Harry Kelly or of the friend who had supplied the new nails for his wife.<br>
