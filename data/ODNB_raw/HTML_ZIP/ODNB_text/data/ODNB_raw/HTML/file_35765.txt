<span class="headword">Rivaz, Sir  Charles Montgomery</span>  (1845&#150;1926), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, the second son of John Theophilus Rivaz of the Indian Civil Service, of Watford Hall, Watford, and his wife, Mary, daughter of William Lambert, was born at Tirlings Park, Essex, on 11 March 1845. After a successful career at Blackheath proprietary school, he entered the Indian Civil Service in 1864, and was almost immediately appointed to the Punjab. Later three of his brothers were also serving in various capacities in the same province, a circumstance which went far to justify the local witticism which alluded to the family as &#145;the five Rivaz of the Punjab&#146; (echoing the name of the province, &#145;the land of the five rivers&#146;).<br>
<br>After six years of district work Rivaz spent 1871&#150;6 in the provincial secretariat, and was then appointed to be superintendent of Kapurthala state during the minority of the ruling chief. He conducted the affairs of this important state with much success from 1876 to 1885. In 1885 he was created a CSI, and after two years (1885&#150;7) in the Kangra district was made commissioner of Lahore (1887&#150;92), and subsequently promoted to be financial commissioner of the Punjab, a post which he held from 1892 to 1897.<br>
<br>In October 1897 Rivaz was appointed to the executive council of the governor-general to serve as member in charge of the home department and of the revenue and agricultural departments. With the arrival of Lord Curzon as viceroy in December 1898 the work in these and in the other departments of the government of India became very strenuous, and Rivaz entered a period of heavy and responsible duty. He was not by nature an initiator of large reforms, but he responded readily to all reasonable suggestions for administrative progress and gave them his vigorous support. In one direction, indeed, he might be considered an initiator, namely in the treatment of landed indebtedness in the Punjab. The alarming expropriation of the peasants by the commercial classes had long engaged the attention of the Punjab officials, but many of them hesitated to advocate restricting land alienation by law. With the support of Lord Curzon, however, and the assistance of Denzil Ibbetson, the secretary of the revenue department, Rivaz prepared a measure to this end, and took the extraordinary course of passing it through the Indian legislature (the <span class="roman">Punjab Land Alienation Act</span>, 1900) in opposition to the wishes of the lieutenant-governor, Mackworth Young. The measure not only halted the expropriation of the <i>zamindars</i> by urban moneylenders, but set the stage for &#145;agriculturalist&#146; domination of Punjab politics.<br>
<br>Rivaz was promoted KCSI in 1901, and early in the following year left the governor-general's council in order to become lieutenant-governor of the Punjab. He held the post until March 1907. He travelled throughout the province during this period. He also encouraged the modernization of amenities in its capital, Lahore. During his term of office the province developed steadily. There were some recurrences of plague, and a terrible earthquake at Kangra on 4 April 1905, but assistance and relief were energetically organized by the lieutenant-governor. Large irrigation schemes were being carried through at this time; and the bold experiment of colonizing the newly irrigated wastes of the province proved eminently successful. Despite these achievements, his tenure of the lieutenant-governorship ended under the cloud of the 1907 rural disturbances. These were rooted in his inopportune enhancement of the Bari Doab Canal water-rate while also pushing ahead with the unpopular <span class="roman">Punjab Colonization of Land Bill</span>.<br>
<br>As an Indian administrator Rivaz in fact represented the characteristics of the official class of his own period. He had little experience of, nor did he attempt to solve, problems connected with Indian nationalism. His interest lay rather in ensuring for the population, and more especially for the agricultural population, a just and efficient official rule, adapted to the needs and ideals of the people themselves, and in this he largely succeeded. Probably no Anglo-Indian official has ever exercised such effective control of affairs with so little recourse to writing; among the voluminous records connected with the passing of the <span class="roman">Punjab Land Alienation Act</span> in 1900, for instance, there are probably few pages where more than five consecutive lines could be found in Rivaz's handwriting, and yet he was the controlling spirit of the measure, fully cognizant throughout not only of the principles but also of the details under discussion.<br>
<br>Rivaz was a man of spare build with an upright carriage, a penetrating eye, and a quick, slightly nervous temperament, coupled with great modesty and restraint; scornful of all pretence and yet contemptuously tolerant of much that would offend others.<br>
<br>Rivaz married in 1874 Emily McGarel, daughter of Major-General Agnew of the Bengal staff corps; they had three sons. After completing his service in India he settled in London and lived a retired life, refraining from public connection with Indian questions. He died in London on 7 October 1926, and was buried at Walton on the Hill, Surrey.<br>
