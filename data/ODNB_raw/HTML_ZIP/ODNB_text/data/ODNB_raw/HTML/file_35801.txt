<span class="headword">Robinson,  Vincent Joseph</span>  (1829&#150;1910), <span class="occ">collector and dealer in Islamic artefacts</span>, was born in London on 5 March 1829, the son of Vincent Robinson, shipowner and merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth Hannah. A younger brother, Henry, was professor of civil engineering at King's College, London, from 1880 to 1902, and his sister Elizabeth Julia (<i>d</i>. 1904) was an artist; a posthumous exhibition of her work was held at the Fine Art Gallery, London, in 1905.<br>
<br>After studying at King's College, London, Robinson took over the family business following his father's premature death, achieving marked success as a commissioning agent. It is not known when Robinson first became interested in Indian artefacts; however, by the mid-1870s his friendship with George Birdwood of the India Office, a noted scholar in Indian studies, prompted him to lend carpets and textiles for display at the South Kensington Museum. There Robinson's loans joined the India Museum collection, which formerly belonged to the East India Company. A number of Robinson's Indian textiles and Islamic carpets were displayed at the 1878 Universal Exhibition, Paris, in the British Indian section, where they were praised by Birdwood as &#145;remarkable &hellip; for their great excellence of quality and design&#146;  (Birdwood, 118); the carpets in particular prompted one curator to note they were &#145;a high class branch of fine art production &hellip; hitherto &hellip; utterly ignored by museum administrators&#146;  (V&amp;A archives, doc. 4149). Robinson's connections with the South Kensington Museum continued through both loans and sales, but it is unclear which artefacts came from his own private collection and which from his London firm. By 1880 the firm was replacing its textile loans often two or three times a month; loans of Islamic pottery, tiles, and metalwork were also given but it is unclear by whom. In 1893 the museum acquired from Robinson the famous &#145;Ardabil&#146; carpet for &pound;2500, then an enormous sum, unaware that he also owned the twin carpet. Heavily used to repair the former piece, it was later sold to the American collector, C. Y. Yerkes, and is now housed in Los Angeles County Museum of Art.<br>
<br>In 1882, perhaps prompted by two German publications (the first carpet studies), one of which was translated into English in 1879, Robinson published <span class="italic">Eastern Carpets: 12 Early Examples</span> drawing from his own collection, with an important introduction by Birdwood and outstanding watercolour illustrations by his sister Elizabeth. Although the majority of attributions, concerning places and dates of production of the carpets illustrated, are no longer tenable, these concerns, alongside his theories of their history, makers, and symbolism, were to dictate the development of carpet research in the West for almost a century. The publication was well received, with the South Kensington Museum sending copies to all major schools of art in Britain and Ireland in 1889, and the book undoubtedly aroused public interest in the subject. Robinson was then asked to contribute an article on Persian-Indian carpets as displayed at the 1891 Vienna Handelsmuseum exhibition. After this, studies in Islamic carpets proliferated both in Britain and abroad.<br>
<br>Robinson was appointed director of the British Indian section at the 1889 Paris Exhibition and created a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur; in the same year he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, London, and was made CIE in 1891. He had retired from his company in 1888, but the loans to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum) continued to cause confusion after his death as his executors queried whether these items were from company stock or his private collection, for he had become an important collector in his own right, travelling extensively with his sister Elizabeth.<br>
<br>This collection was the subject of the illustrated <span class="italic">Ancient Furniture and other Works of Art</span>, published by Robinson in 1902. It was first housed at Hopedene, built by the architect Norman Shaw near Dorking, Surrey, but in 1896 Robinson moved to Parnham House, Beaminster, Dorset, where he lived until the death of Elizabeth in 1904. He then moved into Netherbury Court (near Beaminster) to be close to her grave; he died at home on 21 February 1910 and was buried by her side at Netherbury church. Reportedly blunt and plain-spoken, he never married. The contents of the house were sold at auction by Hampton &amp; Sons (2&#150;9 August 1910) and realized over &pound;13,500, even though many curators had begun to question the provenances, dates, and attributions of some of the items.<br>
