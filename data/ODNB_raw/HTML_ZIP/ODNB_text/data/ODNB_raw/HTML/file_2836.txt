<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bone,  Henry</span>  (1755&#150;1834), <span class="occ">miniature and enamel painter</span>, was born at Truro on 6 February 1755, the son of Henry Bone, a cabinet-maker and carver, who took his family to Plymouth, where Bone learned to paint on hard paste china for the Cookworthy factory. He continued his apprenticeship with Richard Champion in Bristol until the firm went bankrupt in 1779, whereupon he moved to London with 1 guinea in his pocket and &pound;5 borrowed from a friend. Here he worked on jewellery design and enamelling watches and fans. Dr Wolcot (better known as Peter Pindar), also a Truro man, is said to have advised him to return to Cornwall to paint miniatures on ivory and make copies in enamel; but he finally decided to remain in London and began to exhibit miniatures at the Royal Academy in 1781. One of his first portraits was a miniature on ivory, painted in 1779, of Elizabeth Van der Meulen (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1830), a descendant of Philip Van der Meulen, battle-painter to William III, whom he married on 24 January 1780 (Victoria and Albert Museum, London; copy in Bristol Art Gallery). They had many children, of whom five, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2837/', "Henry Pierce Bone")</script>, and also two grandchildren, became miniaturists and helped in the production of an enormous corpus of enamels, mainly copies of well-known portraits and old masters, usually signed with the monograms &#145;HB&#146;, &#145;WB&#146;, and &#145;HPB&#146;, and lavishly inscribed in purple paint on the counter-enamels.<br>
<br>The Bone technique was first to visit a private collection, Woburn Abbey for instance, and laboriously copy the chosen picture on to squared paper. Occasionally the picture might be borrowed from the artist or owner and copied in his studio in Berners Street  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 7.4295). The drawings were in pencil, the exact size of the intended enamel, and could be used for several enamels of various sizes. The paper was notched to allow accurate alignment, laid over another paper coated with red chalk, and traced through to the prepared enamel plaque, usually copper or brass, which was then fired to fix the chalk outline. Sometimes the outline was traced in ink on to transparent paper. The drawings, bound into three large albums and copiously annotated by Bone's sons, are in the National Portrait Gallery library. The number of firings varied from six or seven to twelve or more, and could take as long as three years to complete. Benjamin Haydon described Bone's nervous twitch and creaking voice, &#145;as if he was always watching a bit of Ivory in a furnace for fear it should crack!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, ed. Pope, 3.121&#150;3). And &#145;Rainy Day&#146; Smith believed that the value of Bone's work lay in the preservation of an artist's colours, especially in portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds where &#145;much of the interest is annually lessened by the fading of his colours&#146;  (Smith, 223&#150;4).<br>
<br>The pictures chosen for enamel copies, usually commissioned by the owners, reflect the popular taste of the time. The majority were religious and mythological subjects, in frequency order by Titian, Guido Reni, Correggio, Annibale Carracci, Raphael, and Rembrandt. Most of them were medium sized (about the average postcard today), but Bone was ambitious and some were much larger. His enamel copy of Leonardo's <span class="italic">Madonna of the Rocks</span>, then belonging to the earl of Suffolk, now in the National Gallery, measures 16&frac14; in. &times; 10 in.; it was begun in 1806 and finished in 1808. An even larger enamel, a copy of Titian's <span class="italic">Bacchus and Ariadne</span>, then belonging to Lord Kinnaird and now also in the National Gallery, begun in 1808 and finished in 1811, was exhibited in Bone's studio and visited by several thousand admirers. It was sold to a keen enamel collector, George Bowles, for 2200 guineas, and it is reported that Bone cashed the cheque on his way home, in the nick of time, before Fauntleroy's Bank crashed the next day  (Rogers, 292).<br>
<br>Bone was an immensely prolific artist and towards the end of his life two major projects occupied his energies and were available to the public during May to July 1822. The first was a series of portraits of the Russell family, commissioned by the duke of Bedford and copied from portraits at Woburn Abbey, mostly in 1823 and 1824. They are still at Woburn Abbey. The second was an eighty-five strong series &#145;Portraits of illustrious characters in the reign of Queen Elizabeth&#146;. Bone's collections were valued at &pound;10,000 and the offer to the nation for &pound;4000 was declined. They were exhibited in his studio at 15 Berners Street after his death in 1834, and again at the British Institution where they were sold by Christies in April and June 1836. Most were sold for between 5 and 30 guineas each. The highest price was 124 guineas for lot 62, the Hatfield portrait of Queen Elizabeth. A group of forty kings and queens from Edward III to Charles II, by Henry Bone and his son Henry Pierce Bone, was acquired for the Royal Collection, and many more were bought by William Bankes for his Dorset house, Kingston Lacy, where they still hang in a row in the drawing-room.<br>
<br>Bone was appointed enamel painter to the prince of Wales in 1800, and thereafter to George III, George IV, and William IV. He was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1801, and Royal Academician in 1811, his diploma work, which is still at Burlington House, being an enamel <span class="italic">Nymph and Cupid</span> (exh. Royal Academy, 1963). He died of paralysis in Clarendon Square, Somerstown, London, on 17 December 1834. Likenesses of him by Andrew Plimer (<i>c</i>.1790), G. F. Joseph (1798), John Opie (1799; National Portrait Gallery, London), R. Jean (1803), his son H. P. Bone (1805), Peter Rouw (1808), John Jackson (<i>c</i>.1814; National Portrait Gallery, London), George Harlow (<i>c</i>.1818; Woburn Abbey), Sir Francis Chantrey (1816&#150;20; Burlington House), and by another son William, holding glasses and with the &#145;Elizabethan gallery&#146; in the background (1828; National Portrait Gallery, London), are all discussed in R. Walker's <span class="italic">Regency Portraits</span> (1985).<br>
