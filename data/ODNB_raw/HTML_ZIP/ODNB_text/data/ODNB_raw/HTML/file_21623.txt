<span class="headword">Paulet,  William</span>, third marquess of Winchester  (<em>c.</em>1532&#150;1598), <span class="occ">nobleman and author</span>, was the son of John Paulet, second marquess (<i>c</i>.1510&#150;1576), and his first wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. in or before 1552), daughter of Robert, second Lord Willoughby de Broke. Paulet entered the Inner Temple in 1546, and by 1548 had married Agnes or Anne (<i>d</i>. 1601), daughter of William, first Baron Howard of Effingham. The marriage was unsuccessful and broke down. In addition to a son and three daughters by his wife, he had at least four sons by his mistress Jane Lambert. Attempts were made by the queen in 1578 to reconcile Paulet with his wife: she was supported by Sir Amias Paulet, he by his relative Francis Russell, second earl of Bedford. Paulet made the Lamberts executors and chief beneficiaries of his will, which his family contested amid great acrimony.<br>
<br>Paulet was created knight of the Bath at the coronation of Queen Mary in 1553, served as high sheriff for Hampshire in 1560&#150;61, as commissioner for musters and as joint lord lieutenant for Dorset in 1569, and sat as knight of the shire for Dorset in the parliament of 1571. In 1572 he was summoned to the House of Lords as Baron St John, and on 4 November 1576 he succeeded his father as third marquess of Winchester. Not satisfied with his father's will, he complained of the disposal of the family property due to the influence of his father's widow and third wife, Winifred (<i>d</i>. 1586), daughter of Sir John Brugge, lord mayor of London. He was joint lord lieutenant of Hampshire in 1585 and in 1586 became lord lieutenant of Dorset; in October of that year he was one of the commissioners appointed to try Mary, queen of Scots.<br>
<br>Paulet was a quarrelsome man, frequently embroiled in public and private disputes: he received several reprimands for his conduct from the privy council. His only literary work, <span class="italic">The Lord Marques Idlenes</span>, was printed in 1586 and reprinted in 1587: Thomas Nashe refers to it in his letter written about September 1596 to William Cotton  (<span class="italic">The Works of Thomas Nashe</span>, ed. R. B. McKerrow, rev. F. P. Wilson, 5 vols., 1958, 5.194&#150;5). Dedicated to Queen Elizabeth, Paulet's book takes the form of &#145;sage sentences, prudent precepts, morall examples, sweete similitudes, proper comparisons, and other remembrances of speciall choise&#146;  (sig. *2<i>r</i>). These are gathered in brief paragraphs under headings relating to such subjects as children and youth, death, justice and justicers, knowledge, and love, to form a sort of commonplace book. Written in the author's later years in &#145;mine olde plaine fashion&#146; while unwell and &#145;under the phisitians hands&#146;  (sig. A3<i>r</i>), the brief aphoristic pieces exhibit a concern with the well-being of the commonwealth and a neo-Stoic outlook.<br>
<br>Paulet played a part in the defence of the south coast against the Armada and took part in the trial of Philip Howard, earl of Arundel, in 1589. In 1596 he was lord lieutenant for Hampshire, and in 1597 first commissioner for ecclesiastical causes in the diocese of Winchester. He died on 24 November 1598 at Basing, Hampshire, where he was buried.<br>
