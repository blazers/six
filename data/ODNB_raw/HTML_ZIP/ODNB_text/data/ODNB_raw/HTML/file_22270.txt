<span class="headword">Pilkington <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em> van Lewen]</span>,  Laetitia</span>  (<em>c.</em>1709&#150;1750), <span class="occ">poet and autobiographer</span>, was born in Dublin or co. Cork, the eldest surviving child of John van Lewen (1684&#150;1737), a physician and man-midwife, and Elizabeth Corry 
    (or Casey; <i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1742)
  . Laetitia's father had moved from co. Cork to Dublin by 1711, attracted a fashionable clientele, and eventually rose to be president of the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland. Her mother was a niece of Sir John Meade MP, a former attorney-general in Ireland and progenitor of the Meade earls of Clanwilliam, a connection which in later years opened as many doors to Laetitia as her father's contacts in Dublin. Probably born in 1708 or 1709&#151;she herself claimed 1712&#151;Laetitia was married off on 31 May 1725 to an ambitious young clergyman, the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22276/', "Matthew Pilkington (1701&#150;1774)")</script>.<br>
<br>Through Patrick Delany, a Trinity College classmate of van Lewen's and one of Matthew's early patrons, Mrs Pilkington obtained an introduction to Jonathan Swift about 1729, not long after Matthew did. The couple soon became fixtures at Swift's deanery. By October 1730 Swift was affectionately referring to them as &#145;a little young poetical parson, who has a littler young poetical wife&#146;&#151;both Pilkingtons were diminutive in size&#151;for whom he meant the profits of a projected miscellany of Irish wit  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 3.411&#150;12). A year later, visiting Dublin, Lord Lansdowne's niece, Mary Granville (later Mrs Delany), found Mrs Pilkington &#145;a bosom friend&#146; of the dean's, well worth cultivating. She reported spending convivial evenings with the Pilkingtons on Lazer's Hill and the van Lewens in Molesworth Street  (<span class="italic">Autobiography &hellip; Mrs Delany</span>, 1.301, 335&#150;6, 327).<br>
<br>Thereafter Mrs Pilkington's path tended downwards. Swift's good offices procured Matthew a term in London as chaplain to the lord mayor for 1732&#150;3, but when Mrs Pilkington briefly visited him there in October 1733 she found him knee-deep in intrigue, smitten with a Drury Lane actress&#151;and herself fobbed off on his libertine friend James Worsdale, a painter from whose generosity and connections Matthew hoped to profit. Their marriage survived Matthew's arrest and return in disgrace to Ireland, in April 1734, but not the death of her father less than three years later. In September 1737, having taken up with a wealthy widow, Matthew caught Mrs Pilkington alone in her bedroom with a young surgeon named Robin Adair, much later surgeon-general in England and hero of the ballad bearing his name. Adair fled Dublin, a noisy and acrimonious divorce ensued, and with it the loss of Swift's friendship. Having previously written occasional verse to amuse herself, Mrs Pilkington now turned author in good earnest. With Worsdale visiting Dublin that season, she sold him poems to pass off as his own, produced what she called a &#145;flaming&#146; feminist prologue for his one-act ballad opera <span class="italic">A Cure for a Scold</span> (its text independently revised by Matthew), and apparently wrote the much-anticipated &#145;operatical farce&#146;, never published, called <span class="italic">No Death but Marriage</span>, by &#145;a Lady&#146;, acted at Smock Alley on 3 May 1738.<br>
<br>By the following winter&#151;harassed by Matthew, tired of her notoriety, and alarmed by the would-be seducers it brought her&#151;Mrs Pilkington had fled Dublin for London, where she passed the next eight years, much more quietly, as Mrs Meade. After a brief stint in 1739 as a hack writer for the opposition party she came to the attention of the elderly playwright Colley Cibber. His patronage, and her own amusing conversation, brought her an intermittent stream of ghost-writing commissions from his aristocratic clubmates at White's. At one point she opened a print and pamphlet shop in St James's, at another found herself imprisoned for a &pound;2 debt in the Marshalsea prison (October&#150;December 1742). Originally she sought subscribers for an edition of her collected poems, but by 1743 she instead began soliciting subscriptions for her <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, where almost all her verse eventually appeared. Though patronized up to a point by the novelist and master printer Samuel Richardson&#151;who consulted her about <span class="italic">Clarissa</span> and more than once relieved her in emergencies during 1745 and 1746&#151;Mrs Pilkington never succeeded in finding a publisher for the work in London.<br>
<br>To see the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> into print&#151;and to drum up more subscriptions, sometimes from former friends who feared exposure in them&#151;Mrs Pilkington returned to Dublin in May 1747. On the advice of Cibber she divided the work into volumes. Despite her former husband's best efforts, the first appeared in February 1748 and the second that December. A third volume&#151;apparently detached in part from the original volume 2 and padded out with miscellaneous anecdotes from earlier periods of her life&#151;she left unfinished at her death, though advertised as &#145;In the Press&#146; as early as November 1749. This her son <a href="#cosubject_69112">Jack [<i>see below</i>]</a> finally published in 1754, from London, with a long appendix concluding her life. Mrs Pilkington died in Dublin on 29 July 1750, in modest lodgings on Phraper Lane, of the same digestive disorder (probably ulcers) which had felled her in London in 1744 and again in 1746&#150;7. She was buried at St Ann's, Dawson Street, Dublin.<br>
<br>Though decried by Richardson and his fellow bluestockings, it was the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> which ultimately secured Mrs Pilkington's reputation. Celebrated for their lively anecdotes of Swift, not as a public figure but as he appeared in private life, they anticipated Samuel Johnson's precepts for biography in <span class="italic">The Rambler</span>, number 60. Besides their oft-quoted material on Cibber, Richardson, Swift, and his circle, they provide useful information about such disparate figures as the army generals Charles Churchill and Sir John Ligonier, the scientist Stephen Hales, the publisher Edmund Curll, the collector-physicians Richard Mead and Sir Hans Sloane, the noted jurist Philip Yorke (later Lord Hardwicke), and, apparently, the young William Blackstone, then reading law at the inns of court. They exhibit a breezy conversational style&#151;&#145;write it out just as you relate it&#146;, Cibber had urged her  (L. Pilkington, 160)&#151;and a mastery of dialogue uncommon in narrative at so early a date. Apart from <span class="italic">An Apology for the Minister</span> (1739), an anonymous opposition satire, the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> incorporate almost all her surviving works, including a fragmentary tragedy called <span class="italic">The Roman Father</span>. In April 1748 she and her son Jack briefly turned impresario and rented the little Capel Street theatre in Dublin, for which she wrote a comedy called <span class="italic">The Turkish Court</span>, unpublished and now lost, as well as one or more satiric monologues for Jack to perform in the style of Samuel Foote. Richardson preserved and edited a selection of her letters to him, eventually published by Anna Laetitia Barbauld in <span class="italic">The Correspondence of Samuel Richardson</span> (vol. 2, 1804). A literary-minded young schoolmaster, Bernard Clarke, published his correspondence with her in his <span class="italic">Collection of Poems upon Various Occasions</span> (nos. 2&#150;3, 1751).<br>
<br>Better known as Jack, Mrs Pilkington's younger surviving son, <a name="cosubject_69112"></a><span class="headword">John Carteret Pilkington</span>  (1730&#150;1763)<span class="occ"></span>, tried to follow in his mother's footsteps with his own boyhood memoirs&#151;a less skilful, less high-spirited, and factually less reliable work, originally advertised as &#145;The Adventures of Jack Luckless&#146; (printed proposals, 1758). Padded out with his mother's correspondence with Lord Kingsborough, her last patron in Dublin, this appeared two years later in London as <span class="italic">The Real Story of John Carteret Pilkington</span>, complete with an impressive list of subscribers and dedication to a daughter of Jack's namesake John Carteret, Earl Granville, who had been lord lieutenant in Dublin in the year of his birth.<br>
<br>Escaping from his father's custody about 1741 Jack had found refuge with his mother's uncle in Cork, but then turned to the stage as a boy soprano and struck out again on his own. At various times he attached himself to the eccentric Richard Poekrich, inventor of the musical glasses; to the composer Thomas Arne, in whose troupe he sang and acted in Dublin during 1743; and to a travelling nobleman, Charles O'Neill of Shane's Castle (senior representative of the Clanaboy O'Neills), who allegedly professed his devotion to the boy, offered him a lifetime annuity, but finally dropped him when his voice began to break into a &#145;hoarse disagreeable tenor&#146;  (J. C. Pilkington, <span class="italic">Real Story</span>, 149). The <span class="italic">Real Story</span> ends in 1744, when Jack left Ireland for Scotland.<br>
<br>By 1746, after brief stints as a naval volunteer, Jack had fetched up in London with his mother, whom he accompanied back to Dublin in 1747. By the 1750s, now married, he was back in London writing miscellaneous verse for magazines, following his late mother in and out of the Marshalsea prison (not once but three times), and picking quarrels with Foote and the theatre manager David Garrick. He died on the continent some time during the summer of 1763.<br>
