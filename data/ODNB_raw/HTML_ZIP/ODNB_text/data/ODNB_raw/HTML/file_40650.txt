<span class="headword">Cameron,  Alexander Anthony</span>  (1877&#150;1951), <span class="occ">athlete</span>, was born at Lochtreig Head, Kilmonivaig, in the district of Lochaber, Inverness-shire, on 1 April 1877, the son of Donald Cameron, shepherd, and his wife, Mary McMillan. His father was quite a small man, but his mother's McMillan line were famous for their physique, and Alexander grew to a weight of 17 stone, standing 6 feet 1 inch. Renowned later for his devoted attachment to his native Lochaber, he was for a time in youth a policeman in Partick (Glasgow), but he found a more distinguished way of alleviating rural indigence when he became a star of the highland games circuit. A product of nineteenth-century &#145;invention of tradition&#146;, the highland games developed as centres where local landowners (increasingly, non-Scottish) flaunted their kilts, their tartan-clad retinues, and their noteworthy acquaintance while hard-headed, thick-thewed men of the people earned useful prize money. The first great games star was Donald Dinnie, who was still winning prizes in special competitions as late as 1910, when he was aged over seventy.<br>
<br>In the early twentieth century Cameron was firmly installed as successor to Dinnie and G. H. Johnstone as &#145;Champion Heavy of Scotland&#146;. He set new records in such events as hammer throwing, weightlifting, caber tossing, putting the stone, and the distinctive highland &#145;standing jump&#146;, where his record of 4 feet 11 inches still stood at the time of his death. He was undisputed champion from 1903 to 1914. By this time the games had standardized forms and rules and were regulated by judges and stewards. In 1910 51,000 spectators attended the Cowal gathering, so that prize money on offer of &pound;160 might seem meagre&#151;and indeed, Cameron himself led an athletes' strike for higher prizes at the Turriff games.<br>
<br>English impresarios were greatly interested in &#145;strong men&#146;, and Cameron accepted the lure of high wages. He toured as far as Australia (1904) and Russia. But unlike Dinnie he could not settle for footlights and &#145;gee-whiz&#146; promotions. It is part of Cameron's legend that when George Hackenschmidt, &#145;the Russian Lion&#146;&#151;who thought him, after a wrestling match, the strongest man he had ever handled&#151;made him an especially good offer to tour with his team, Cameron took time to think it over. Pressing him again, Hackenschmidt said, &#145;You'll be going, I take it?&#146; &#145;Aye, I'll be going&#146;, replied Cameron, adjusting (it is said) his bowler hat, &#145;back to Lochaber&#146;  (Webster, 88).<br>
<br>Cameron, who remained unmarried, was nicknamed the Mighty Muccomber (or Mucomir) after the name of his home farm. After the First World War had cut his dominance short, he displayed his disinterested love of the games as a popular judge. Not long before he died, he was chatting happily in Gaelic to athletes at the Glenfinnan games. He collapsed fatally on 18 September 1951, while cutting grass in front of his cottage on the Letterfinlay estate at Spean Bridge, Inverness-shire. In his heyday, he had rarely trained, except by swinging a scythe day after day. He was buried at Blarour cemetery, Spean Bridge.<br>
