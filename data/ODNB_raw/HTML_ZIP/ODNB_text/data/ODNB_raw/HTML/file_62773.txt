<span class="headword">Parker <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Robinson]</span>,  Theresa</span>  (1745&#150;1775), <span class="occ">art patron</span>, was born in Vienna on 1 January 1745, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23878/', "Thomas Robinson, first Baron Grantham (1695&#150;1770)")</script>, then ambassador to the Habsburg court in Vienna, and Frances Worsley (1716&#150;1750). She was named for her godmother Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. She probably had a traditional aristocratic education at home that included drawing; a picture-puzzle letter that she drew in 1761 is preserved in Leeds (W. Yorks. AS, VR6015), and two etchings of landscapes that she made before her marriage are in the British Museum. On 18 May 1769 at Twickenham, Middlesex, she married, as his second wife, John Parker (1734/5&#150;1788), MP for Bodmin in 1761&#150;2 and for Devon from 1762 until 1784, when he was created Baron Boringdon.<br>
<br>In 1768 John Parker inherited extensive family estates in the west country, including Saltram House in Devon. While her husband was gambling, hunting, shooting, racing, or otherwise occupied with politics Theresa Parker focused her attentions on Saltram. She had a close relationship with her elder sister Anne (Nanny) and brothers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23880/', "Thomas Robinson, second Baron Grantham")</script>, and Frederick (Fritz), and much of what is known about her character and views on life, and the decoration of Saltram, comes from her lively and engaging letters to them. She was a warm, intelligent woman whose &#145;amiable disposition, her softness and gentleness of manners, endeared her to every one that had the happiness of knowing her&#146;  (Reynolds, &#145;Character&#146;, 75) and whose sophisticated taste transformed Saltram into one of the showpieces of south-west England.<br>
<br>In 1768 Robert Adam, then at the height of his career, was commissioned to design two grand new rooms&#151;the saloon and the library (now the dining room)&#151;for the east wing; in 1772 he also designed the stag lodges and a ceiling for the Parkers' Sackville Street house in London. Adam's design extended to the carpets, fittings, and some of the furniture for the rooms. The Parkers spent about &pound;10,000 on the saloon alone. The Saltram account books record payments to Thomas Chippendale in 1771 and 1772, and the suite of furniture in the saloon was probably designed and made by him; Matthew Boulton made the four six-branch candelabra in 1772. The velvet drawing room leading into the saloon was redecorated in 1770, when Theresa &#145;with her usual taste orderd all the mouldings, &amp; parts of the Capitals of the Columns to be Gilt, which makes the Room much chearfuller &amp; handsommer&#146;; mirrors and tables designed by Adam were added about 1772  (Johnson, 11).<br>
<br>Theresa Parker chose many of the decorative objects for the house, including ceramics&#151;she had a preference for unglazed black Wedgwood&#151;and designed some pieces in silver herself. In 1772 Grantham wrote to Nanny of an inkstand: &#145;I am delighted with her Design, and am choaking with Jealousy and Admiration of it&#146;  (Johnson, 47). Grantham, a noted connoisseur and amateur architect, commissioned copies of works by Murillo for Saltram while he was ambassador to Spain, and designed the summer house known as The Castle in 1771. Theresa oversaw the landscaping and planting of the grounds, and the creation of hothouses, kitchen gardens, lodges, and a greenhouse; in 1774 she described how she wanted to decorate the new orangery with &#145;good Medallions and Bas Reliefs in Artificial Stone, which properly arranged over Niches may make it clever&#146;  (ibid., 60).<br>
<br>Sir Joshua Reynolds was a close friend of the Parkers. He grew up in nearby Plympton, and according to family tradition John Parker's mother gave Reynolds his first drawing pencil. Reynolds enjoyed hunting and gambling at Saltram, and advised the Parkers on paintings for the house; two are known to have belonged to him. The Parkers purchased paintings by Philippe Jacques de Loutherbourg and George Stubbs, as well as old masters and copies. Other works were commissioned from artists such as Antonio Zucchi, who provided the ceiling paintings for the new rooms, and Angelica Kauffman, who painted Theresa's portrait in 1773 (priv. coll.). Theresa claimed responsibility for acquiring at least four history paintings by Kauffmann for Saltram in a letter to Fritz of 24 August 1775.<br>
<br>There are thirteen paintings by Reynolds at Saltram, including a studio replica; three others were sold in the late nineteenth century. He painted a full-length portrait of Theresa Parker between 1770 and 1772. In 1773 Theresa wrote to Grantham:<blockquote>I have some thoughts (that is) Mr. Parker talks, of having the little Boy [her son, John] put into the half length [of] Sir Joshua's which remains just as you left it, only in bright yellow, which he is very fond of at present but I do not approve of. (Lummis and Marsh, 32)</blockquote>A sitting that year was unproductive; the painting lay unfinished until a more successful result was achieved in 1775. Her son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21321/', "John Parker, first earl of Morley (1772&#150;1840)")</script>.<br>
<br>After contracting a fever Theresa Parker gave birth to a girl prematurely on 20 September 1775; she died of complications following the birth on 21 December and was buried at Plympton St Mary, Devon. Her daughter, Theresa, later married the Hon. George Villiers, and died in 1856. In the obituary of Mrs Parker written by Reynolds  (BL, Add. MS 48252, fol. 15) and published anonymously in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> he says that her death was:<blockquote>occasioned by a stroke of the palsy, which happened soon after her lying-in of a daughter. Of this she appeared to be recovering; but receiving a second stroke, and soon after that a third, it put an end to the life of one of the most valuable of women. (Reynolds, &#145;Character&#146;)</blockquote>He continued his tribute:<blockquote>In so exalted a character it is scarce worth mentioning her skill and exact judgment in the polite arts. She seemed to possess, by a kind of intuition, that propriety of taste and right thinking, which others but imperfectly acquire by long labour and application.</blockquote>
