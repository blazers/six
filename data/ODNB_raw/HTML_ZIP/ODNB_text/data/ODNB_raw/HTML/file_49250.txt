Her parents were first cousins, originally from Unst, Shetland, and had married on 22 February 1889. Her brothers were Basil Ramsay (1892&#150;1960) and William John (1894&#150;1930).<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandeducation"></a>Early life and education</h2>Educated at a small private school (1893&#150;9), Townhead elementary board school (1899&#150;1902), and Montrose Academy (1902&#150;07), she studied classics (1907&#150;10) and English and modern history (1910&#150;11) at St Andrews University, graduating in July 1911 with first-class honours in classics. Awarded the Berry scholarship, she studied English literature from 1911 to 1912. Known as Minnie by her family and during her time at St Andrews University, she took part in the women's debating society, the women's suffrage society, and the students' representative council. She was also on the editing committee of <span class="italic">College Echoes</span> (the student magazine) from 1910 to 1912. She fell in love with Cecil Wilmot Morrison, a rugby player and medical student with a protracted university career (begun 1903&#150;6, resumed 1910&#150;11, and finally qualified 1916) and they became engaged in the summer of 1911. Two years later Cecil confessed &#145;his recurrent peccadilloes&#146; and she dramatically threw her engagement ring into the sea from the pier  (<span class="italic">Belonging</span>, 12).<br>
<br>Willa Anderson's first employment was teaching classics at Brancepeth Rectory home school, 4 miles south-west of Durham, from the autumn of 1912 to the summer of 1914, when the beginning of the war led to her becoming an assistant in Latin at St Andrews University classics department  (Court minutes, 24 Oct 1914). From 1916 to 1918 she researched an (unfinished) thesis on child educational psychology at Bedford College, London, funded by the Carnegie Trust. She spent a few months in Mansfield House University Settlement, Canning Town, a community in east London, where she taught Bryant and May factory girls  (<span class="italic">Belonging</span>, 17&#150;18), then was vice-principal and lecturer in English, psychology, and education at Gipsy Hill Teacher Training College, from September 1918 to summer 1919, resigning when the principal objected to Edwin Muir's &#145;atheism&#146; in <span class="italic">We Moderns</span> (1918).<h2>
<a name="MarriagetoEdwinMuir"></a>Marriage to Edwin Muir</h2>Willa Anderson met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35141/', "Edwin Muir (1887&#150;1959)")</script> in Glasgow in September 1918. They corresponded and met again in Glasgow and St Andrews, and were married on 7 June 1919 at St Pancras register office, London; in September they set up home in two ground floor rooms in 13 Guilford Street, Bloomsbury. They became Peerie Willa and Peerie Breeks (Edwin Muir's mother's name for him) to each other. Willa Muir worked in a cramming institution in Red Lion Square and then, from January 1920 to 1921, as headmistress at a day continuation school. When Edwin Muir was commissioned to write for <span class="italic">The Freeman</span> at $60 an article they decided to travel to Prague as &#145;a good place to start from&#146;  (&#145;Mrs Muir's reminiscences&#146;). They left from Leith on 31 August 1921.<br>
<br>The next three years were spent in Prague, Germany, Italy, and Austria, and provided the pattern of the Muirs' marriage, working in teaching and translating with their decisions to change country made almost at random. In 1922 they visited Dresden for the weekend and decided to move there; in due course they met A. S. Neill (an old friend of Muir's from student days) at a bus stop and decided to teach at his school at Hellerau, 6 miles from Dresden  (<span class="italic">Belonging</span>, 71). Their time there included a walking tour, at Easter 1923, with Gerda Krapp (later Liebricht) and others. After the collapse of the German economy in November, they &#145;fled&#146; to Italy to join Edwin Muir's friend John Holms and his partner, Dorothy Jennings  (journal, 20 Aug 1953). On the way, her husband told Muir that Gerda had declared her love for him as he left, and that he ought to return to her. Muir, describing her feelings of emotional pain and insecurity, claims that they never discussed it again once he had decided not to return  (<span class="italic">Belonging</span>, 82&#150;3), but her journals report a painful conversation with him in Newbattle. She could &#145;still conjure up the emotions of that terrible time&#146;  (journal, 20 Aug 1953). What she never knew, apparently, was that he had written from Italy offering to join Gerda, who refused  (Gaskill, 49).<br>
<br>About Easter 1924 <span class="italic">The Freeman</span> suspended publication, ending the Muirs' only regular income. Invited by Ben Huebsch, the New York publisher, to translate three Gerhart Hauptmann plays into English at $100 a play  (<span class="italic">Belonging</span>, 106), they began the translation work which now provided the basis of their income. Muir had learned Czech and was fluent in German, and later maintained that most of the translation work was hers: &#145;I am a better translator than he is&#146;; she thought she should have shouted aloud: &#145;Most of this translation, especially Kafka, has been done by ME. Edwin only helped&#146;  (journal, Aug 1953), although she said, during the war, that they divided Kafka in two, translated their own half and then exchanged them for further work  (C. Soukup, 24). Their translations between 1925 and 1938 included works by Sholem Asch, Lion Feuchtwanger, Heinrich Mann, and others. Muir also translated Hans Carossa and C. Winsloe as Agnes Neill Scott, and <span class="italic">Songs from the Auvergnat &hellip; into Modern Scots</span> (1931).<h2>
<a name="Muirasnovelist"></a>Muir as novelist</h2>From July 1924 to February 1926 the Muirs lived in Montrose, Penn, Buckinghamshire, and Montrose again (where Muir had a miscarriage in December 1925). They moved to St Tropez, then Menton, between October and May 1927. Muir began her first novel, <span class="italic">Imagined Corners</span>, in St Tropez. It was not published until 1931, because her work on it had been interrupted by translating and by her son's birth. Muir wrote later that she threw herself into characters, living in them as much as possible: &#145;they are bound to be versions of myself&#146;  (journal, 1948); her relationship with Cecil Morrison formed the model for Elizabeth and Hector's marriage and the starting point for the novel  (<span class="italic">Belonging</span>, 125). When she reread the novel, she thought it had &#145;no apparent knowledge of social fabric <i>effects</i>. Quite pre-Marxian! But a good picture of the world I grew up in&#146;  (journal, 1948). Her final judgement was that it contained enough material for two novels  (<span class="italic">Belonging</span>, 163). Despite her reservations, the interlocking stories of the Shand and Murray families in Calderwick make a powerful novel with intense explorations of inner feelings and of the society of the town. The <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> described it as &#145;a memorable contribution to the cartography of the soul of Scotland&#146;  (2 July 1931).<br>
<br>The Muirs returned to England in May 1927 and settled in the White House, Dormansland, Surrey, where Gavin Anderson Cormack Muir (1927&#150;1991) was born on 29 October. Muir kept the Marmaduke journal, 1927&#150;31, observing his progress from six weeks, including psychological analyses and his reactions to breastfeeding. From March 1929 to October 1932 they were based at Crowborough, Sussex  (<span class="italic">Belonging</span>, 106), then they moved to 7 Downshire Hill, Hampstead. It was here that Edwin Muir had a bare study in the attic and Willa Muir's study was on the ground floor, &#145;intruded upon at all hours&#146;  (ibid., 162). She used to work late into the night, finishing translations and correcting proofs. She finished her second novel, <span class="italic">Mrs Ritchie</span>, in the press of other work; &#145;it does not surprise me that I lost control of it in the second half, although the first half is quite good&#146;  (ibid., 163). Published in July 1933, it was also set in Calderwick but concentrated on the damage one woman inflicts on her family, herself already damaged by Calvinism and the constriction of possibilities for women. Darker in tone than <span class="italic">Imagined Corners</span>, it has a powerful and negative sweep with an overly analytic narrator; &#145;the result is nearer to science than to art&#146;  (<span class="italic">TLS</span>).<br>
<br>After Gavin was run over and his leg badly broken in July 1933, the Muirs took him to Orkney for a month to recuperate; Gavin and Muir returned for a three-month stay to Isbister House in the summer of 1934, Edwin joining them after driving through mainland Scotland researching his <span class="italic">Scottish Journey</span>. They moved to St Andrews in August 1935, staying until 1942, because it was cheaper. Muir wrote <span class="italic">Mrs Grundy in Scotland</span> (1936) for Leslie Mitchell's series <span class="roman">The Voice of Scotland</span>. Edwin Muir's <span class="italic">Scott and Scotland</span> (1936), published in the same series, was more bitter and led to their rift with C. M. Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid)&#151;known since 1924, he appears to have already disliked Muir, whose &#145;overpowering presence has always been a nuisance to friends of Edwin's&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Hugh MacDiarmid</span>, 126). Muir collapsed in December 1938 from gynaecological problems caused by Gavin's birth, and had surgery in Dundee conducted by Professor Margaret Fairlie  (<span class="italic">Belonging</span>, 201). In the early years of the war translating work dried up, and Muir taught classics at New Park School, which Gavin attended. She contracted bowel ulcers and, hospitalized in May 1941, experienced, as Edwin Muir held her hand, a &#145;frozen landscape&#146; without feelings, before recovering her sense of connection  (ibid., 207).<br>
<br>In March 1942 Edwin Muir began work for the British Council in Edinburgh and, by August, Muir and Gavin joined him. After the war, Edwin Muir was appointed director of the British Institute in Prague, and Muir took her first flight to join him there in the late summer of 1945. She recorded their stay in her Prague journals, November 1946 to May 1948. The communist coup of February 1948, and subsequent events, led to them leaving Czechoslovakia at the end of July  (E. Muir, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 269). In January 1949 they went to Rome, where Edwin Muir became the director of the British Institute. It closed for financial reasons and they left Rome in July 1950, on the same train as Laurel and Hardy  (<span class="italic">Belonging</span>, 263). Edwin Muir became warden of Newbattle Abbey, Dalkeith&#151;which reopened as an adult education college&#151;a post he held from 1950 to 1955. Muir taught Latin and Greek unofficially but otherwise was the wife of the warden.<br>
<br>Muir's unpublished novel &#145;Mrs Muttoe and the Top Storey&#146; (finished May 1940) had been closely based on their life in Hampstead. Her second unpublished novel, &#145;The Usurpers&#146; (written February 1951 to February 1952), was based on her Czechoslovak journals recording the difficult relationship between the British Institute and the British Council, and personal problems between staff. Circulated to Macmillan, Chatto and Windus, and Hamish Hamilton under the pseudonym of Alexander Croy  (journal, 14 Oct 1952), it was probably libellous; Muir comforted herself that the rejections were for that reason. But as with the earlier unpublished novel she failed to make the fictional transformation of her autobiographical material that she had so successfully accomplished in <span class="italic">Imagined Corners</span>.<br>
<br>After their departure for Harvard, in the autumn of 1955 Muir wrote in her journal that &#145;the whole of Scotland is a locked area for me&#146;. She had loved &#145;Newbattle and the beech trees&#146; but &#145;Lowland Scotland infected Newbattle&#146;  (journal, 26 Sept 1955). Reflecting on her illness during the war, she thought that she came back to life only to devote herself to Edwin Muir &#145;and in a lesser way to Gavin&#146; and that she had to kill her &#145;vanity&#146; and ambition to write:<blockquote>My intelligent Unconscious now told me that in killing, or trying to kill, my vanity I had nearly succeeded in killing myself. &hellip; All the Willas, the passionate little girl, the ambitious &amp; vital student, the positive, hopeful &amp; happy new wife, came back together &amp; fused. (journal, 1 Oct, 1955)</blockquote>Her journals from September to November 1955 record meetings with I. A. Richards, May Sarton, Elena and Edmund Wilson, Robert Lowell, and Karl Miller.<br>
<br>In May 1956 they returned to Britain, Edwin Muir having a grant from the Bollingen Foundation to write on the Ballads. At the start of her 1947&#150;8 journal, Muir had written &#145;All emigrants are Displaced Persons. My parents were D.P.s in Angus. So I grew up not fitting into Angus tradition and therefore critical, resentful, unsure. Hence my secret desire to <i>own</i> a house, to belong somewhere&#146;. Her &#145;secret desire&#146; was only achieved in this last home together, which they bought at Swaffham Prior, Cambridgeshire. During Edwin Muir's absence as visiting professor at Bristol University, from February to March 1958, Muir's letters about her health, Gavin, and Edwin Muir's absence continued to discuss their relationship and her insecurities:<blockquote>My dearest love, our lives are so woven together, with memories &amp; shared experience, that they can't be unwoven, I tell myself; so I have stopped worriting about thee having maybe fallen out of love with me. I always was a bit of a Bad Peerie Ting; that is no thing new; so I am just going to leave it at that. (St Andrews, 9.8.M(i) 14)</blockquote>Edwin Muir died on 3 January 1959.<h2>
<a name="Laterlife"></a>Later life</h2>Muir paid off the mortgage on the cottage in October 1959, &#145;so now I can live here till I die&#146;  (7 Oct 1959, NL Scot., MS 19703, fol. 103), the money coming partly from the transfer of Edwin Muir's Bollingen grant to her for writing <span class="italic">Living with Ballads</span>, he having completed only a few notes. She shared ownership with Gavin. However, Muir became peripatetic once more. In August 1963, relieved of financial worries by the continuation of the Bollingen grant until December 1964, she and her cat Popsy moved into Kathleen Raine's basement, 47A Paultons Square, London. <span class="italic">Living with Ballads</span> was well received on publication in 1965. Forsyth Hardy thought that the early chapters, which referred to her own schooldays at the board school, had a &#145;very special appeal and character&#146; and Robert Kemp, remembering &#145;her own excellent writings&#146;, welcomed the book as coming out &#145;with her own stamp&#146;  (<span class="italic">Arts Review</span>, 18 March 1965, St Andrews 9/8). Despite A. S. Neill asking her in 1964 &#145;How are the book plans? Time you cease to be known as Edwin's Frau&#146;  (<span class="italic">Arts Review</span>, 4 Sept 1964, St Andrews 9/8), her last book, apart from <span class="italic">Laconics, Jingles and other Verses</span> (1969), was to be her memoir of Edwin Muir, <span class="italic">Belonging</span> (1968). She described it as &#145;very like a Scotch bun &hellip; because it has a bit of everything in it, not classified into layers like a respectable English cake&#146;  (22 March 1968, NL Scot., MS 19703, fol. 61). Much of it is drawn from her journals, but its narrative of her and Edwin Muir's lives, with some passages of feminist and psychological analysis, succeeds in a way that &#145;The Usurpers&#146; does not.<br>
<br>In February 1969 Muir moved to the British Red Cross Home, Meadowcroft, Cambridge, then, finding the organization too rigid, to a small private nursing home, Church Farm, Over, Cambridgeshire. In the autumn she moved to St Andrews to live with Lillias Chisholm, F. G. Scott's daughter, not understanding the &#145;transient nature of her impulses&#146;  (31 Oct 1969, NL Scot., MS 19703, fol. 196). After nine days, Lillias told her she had made a mistake. She was rescued by Edwin's niece Margaret and nephew Jim with his wife, Ivy, and she moved to Dunoon in October, &#145;like a stray cat&#146;  (10 Dec 1969, NL Scot., MS 19703, fol. 199), not able to face a move back to London. They promised her a home for the rest of her life: &#145;A short life, I hope&#146;  (5 April 1970, NL Scot., MS 19703, fol. 219). Muir died of heart failure on 22 May 1970 at hospital in Dunoon and was cremated at Greenock crematorium on 25 May. Her ashes were scattered on Edwin Muir's grave in Swaffham Prior.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> obituary (23 May 1970) acknowledged Willa Muir as a &#145;Scottish woman writer and translator &hellip; widow of Edwin Muir and herself a writer of distinction&#146;. Peter Butter, Edwin Muir's biographer, felt able to say in 1990 that her &#145;greatest work, I think she would gladly agree, was to make possible the production of his poetry&#146; before going on to &#145;give her credit for what she, in spite of difficulties, achieved as a writer&#146;  (Butter, &#145;Willa Muir&#146;, 59). But the reprinting of <span class="italic">Imagined Corners</span> (1987) and <span class="italic">Mrs Ritchie</span>, <span class="italic">Women: an Enquiry</span> (first published by the Hogarth Press, 1925) and other non-fiction pieces (1996) have enabled an assessment of Willa Muir as a writer in a way that she did not achieve in her lifetime. Passionate, intellectually confident, assertive, emotionally insecure, and, latterly, indomitable in the face of pain from arthritis, with a lifelong feminist awareness apparent in her novels, letters, and journals, she never stopped writing, one of her last letters hoping &#145;I <i>might</i> get a small book done&#146;  (5 April 1970, NL Scot., MS 19703, fol. 219).<br>
