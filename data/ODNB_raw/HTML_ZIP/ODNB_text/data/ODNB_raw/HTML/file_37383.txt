<span class="headword">Earbery,  Matthias</span>  (1690&#150;1740), <span class="occ">writer and nonjuring Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 11 July 1690 in Hoveton St Peter, Norfolk, the son of the Revd Matthias Earbery (<i>d</i>. 1735), vicar of Hoveton and Neatished. Matthias Earbery the elder had sworn allegiance to William and Mary only &#145;as a conquered person&#146;. In 1695 he was presented by Charles Finch, fourth earl of Winchilsea, to the mastership of Wye grammar school in Kent, though retaining his livings. He published in 1697 an answer to Spinoza's <span class="italic">Tractatus theologico politicus</span>, entitled <span class="italic">Deism Examin'd and Confuted</span>. He also published <span class="italic">A review of the bishop of Bangor's <span class="roman">[Hoadly's]</span> sermon</span> from Neatished (1718). In 1730 he became rector of Barsham in Suffolk, where he died in 1735.<br>
<br>Matthias Earbery the younger was educated by his father before entering St John's College, Cambridge, then noted for its nonjuring sympathies. He was ordained to a curacy in Kent, where he became a friend of Thomas Brett. On 18 November 1715 he was received by George Hickes into the nonjuring communion, and became minister to a congregation in Holborn. In June 1716 he signed the petition which began the &#145;usages&#146; controversy; he soon changed his opinion, however, and fiercely attacked Brett and the &#145;usagers&#146; in <span class="italic">Reflections upon Modern Fanaticism</span> (1720).<br>
<br>Earbery's views on the rights of hereditary monarchy and episcopacy were those of Charles Leslie, whom he admired, but Earbery had none of Leslie's wit or power of reasoning: his numerous works are largely made up of quantities of historical narrative, related with a strong ideological bias, often laced with personal abuse. In 1717 <span class="italic">The History of the Clemency of our English Monarchs</span>, contrasting the treatment of the rebels after the battle of Preston with the leniency of previous reigns, was seized by the government. Earbery escaped to France, and published a second edition, complete with a portrait of himself, in 1720. He was arrested in London in 1723 for seditious libel, and again in 1732 for attacks on Sir Robert Walpole (later first earl of Orford) and King George II in the <span class="italic">Royal Oak Journal</span>. His targets ranged from the &#145;filth of Bangorianism&#146; to John Wyclif, Gilbert Burnet, and Sir John Oldcastle.<br>
<br>Earbery lived apparently by his writing, which accounts perhaps for his translation of Thomas Burnet's notoriously heterodox <span class="italic">State of the Dead</span> (1727). He died, apparently unmarried, at &#145;a gentleman's house in Yorkshire&#146; on 3 October 1740, leaving no account of some &pound;350 subscribed to a projected edition of his works.<br>
