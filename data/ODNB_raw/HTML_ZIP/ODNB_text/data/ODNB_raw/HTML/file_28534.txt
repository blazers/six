<span class="headword">Wallace,  James</span>  (1642&#150;1688), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and writer on Orkney</span>, was born in Banffshire of unknown parentage. He entered King's College, Aberdeen, in 1655 and graduated MA in 1659, thereafter becoming schoolmaster at Fortrose. He was appointed minister of Ladykirk in 1668, then responded to an appeal for ministers to go to Orkney, where he was admitted minister at Kirkwall in November 1672. In October 1678 he was collated to the prebend of St John in the cathedral church of St Magnus-the-Martyr at Kirkwall. His marriage to Elizabeth Cuthbert (<i>d</i>. 1685), probably of the Inverness family of that name, brought them three sons, Andrew (<i>b</i>. 1675), Alexander (who died young), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28535/', "James Wallace (b. 1684)")</script>, and a daughter, Jean, who also died young. Wallace was known as &#145;a man of great industry and scholarship&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fasti Scot.</span>, 222), with a thorough grounding in philosophy, theology, history, and mathematics. He owned a house in Albert Street, Kirkwall, distinguished with the words &#145;Welcome, welcome&#146; and a double heart above the entrance.<br>
<br>When Sir Robert Sibbald (1641&#150;1722), the king's geographer for Scotland, advertised in 1682 for contributions to his projected description of the kingdom Wallace was one of those who sent him materials; he became a prolific correspondent and also provided Sibbald with information on Shetland. Wallace left in manuscript various sermons and other religious pieces, a complete history of the Orkney islands, and the work for which he is known, <span class="italic">A Description of the Isles of Orkney</span>, which his son James issued in 1693, dedicating it to Sibbald and including Sibbald's &#145;An Essay Concerning the Thule of the Ancients&#146;. A second edition of 1700, purporting to be the work of the younger Wallace and dedicated to the earl of Dorset, cut some of the earlier text but added a section on the plants and shells of Orkney. The original version, edited by John Small, was reprinted in 1883.<br>
<br>In the closing months of his life, and in consequence of the revolution of 1688&#150;9, Wallace was deprived by the council of his preferments. He died of a fever on 18 September 1688, &#145;in the flower of his age, to the regrate of all that knew him&#146;  (Craven, preface). He gave a large number of books to the town, together with 100 merks, with which two communion cups were bought and inscribed with his name.<br>
