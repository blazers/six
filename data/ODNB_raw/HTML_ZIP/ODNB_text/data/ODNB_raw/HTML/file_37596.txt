<span class="headword">Jebb,  Richard</span>  (1874&#150;1953), <span class="occ">publicist and theorist on imperial themes</span>, was born at The Lyth, Ellesmere, Shropshire, on 16 October 1874, the second son in the family of two sons and five daughters of Arthur Trevor Jebb (1839&#150;1894), landowner, and his wife, Eglantyne Louisa (a distant cousin), daughter of Robert Jebb of Killiney, Ireland. The philanthropists <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34165/', "Eglantyne Jebb")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56643/', "Dorothy Frances Buxton")</script>, and the agricultural administrator <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50178/', "Louisa Wilkins")</script>, were his sisters. His uncle was the classical scholar Sir Richard Jebb. His family had been landowners in Wales and Shropshire. He was educated at Marlborough College and at New College, Oxford, where he obtained second classes in classical honour moderations (1895) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1897). His interest in the British empire was stimulated by a schoolmaster's setting for a Latin essay prize a subject involving imperial federation. He won the prize, and made the empire his principal concern for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Jebb intended to join the Indian Civil Service, but while he was at Oxford his father and his only brother died, and he inherited the family estate, which provided him with an income for the rest of his life. On 29 September 1900 he married Margaret Ethel (<i>d</i>. 1949), daughter of George Lewthwaite of Littlebank, Settle, with whom he had two sons and one daughter. The years 1898&#150;1901 were spent in travel abroad, mainly in the self-governing colonies. He made many journeys on a bicycle, including a honeymoon trip the length of the north island of New Zealand. The colonial experience gave him material for his propositions about colonial nationalism, the subject which he quickly made his own.<br>
<br>In 1905 Jebb published <span class="italic">Studies in Colonial Nationalism</span>, the book which brought him into public notice. A fervent follower of the tariff reform movement of Joseph Chamberlain, he began to write leaders and articles for the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> under the editorship of his friend Fabian Ware; in 1906 he wrote articles for it during the course of a journey through Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.<br>
<br>At the general election of January 1910 Jebb made his only attempt to enter parliament, contesting the seat of East Marylebone as a Unionist with tariff-reform beliefs; the official Unionist candidate won, with a Liberal second and Jebb third. He took no further part in party politics, confining himself to local bodies: he was a magistrate and served on the Shropshire county council from 1923 to 1934. He continued to express firm opinions in letters to newspapers, but seems to have lost faith in parliamentary institutions, even toying with fascism and social credit. In the First World War he served from 1914 to 1919 in the King's Shropshire light infantry, mostly in Britain, and in the Second World War he commanded the Ellesmere company of the Home Guard.<br>
<br>Jebb's books included the two-volume <span class="italic">The Imperial Conference</span> (1911), <span class="italic">The Britannic Question</span> (1913), <span class="italic">The Empire in Eclipse</span> (1926), and <span class="italic">His Britannic Majesty</span> (1935). In May 1914 he had apparently financed a journal, the <span class="italic">Britannic Review</span>, but it did not survive the outbreak of war in August. <span class="italic">The Imperial Conference</span> received much public notice, but the other books did not.<br>
<br>Jebb's ideas were relatively simple. He saw that there was a sentiment which he called colonial nationalism, which was not merely separatism, but a complex of local feeling and attachment to Britain. Imperial federationists and the Round Table group headed by Lionel Curtis did not understand the strength of this sentiment: their proposals, not taking account of it, would therefore fail. Jebb favoured a system of alliance or partnership between Britain and what came to be known as the dominions: he approved of separate dominion navies in co-operation with the Royal Navy; he wanted tariff reform and imperial preference as means of binding the dominions more closely; and he wanted the Imperial Conference turned into a continuous body handling large defence and economic questions. Jebb died peacefully at his home, The Lyth, on 25 June 1953.<br>
