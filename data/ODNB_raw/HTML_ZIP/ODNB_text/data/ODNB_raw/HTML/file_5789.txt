<span class="headword">Cocks,  Arthur Herbert</span>  (1819&#150;1881), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, third son of the Hon. Lieutenant-Colonel Philip James Cocks MP (1774&#150;1857), of the Grenadier Guards, and Frances (<i>d</i>. 1870), daughter of Arthur Herbert of Brewsterfield, Killarney, was born on 18 April 1819, probably in the parish of Colwall, Herefordshire. His father was the third son of Charles Somers-Cocks, first Baron Somers. Arthur was educated at the Revd Mortlock's school in Brighton and, following his nomination in 1836 to the Bengal civil service, at the East India Company's college at Haileybury.<br>
<br>Cocks arrived in Bengal in 1837 and initially filled a variety of subordinate revenue and judicial posts in the North-Western Provinces. In 1847, after the First Anglo-Sikh War, Cocks was appointed Henry Lawrence's chief assistant in the Lahore residency. Although technically a political posting, the job required Cocks to advise the Sikh durbar on internal revenue and judicial reforms, and he enthusiastically toured the countryside around Lahore, settling legal disputes, adjusting revenue settlements, and abolishing iniquitous taxes. Like many of his colleagues he saw himself bringing justice and order to a grievously oppressed peasantry. In October 1847 he wrote in his tour diary: &#145;My present is a delightful occupation. I feel I am doing some tangible good in every order I give&#146;  (Rayner, 433). In the same year he married Anna Marion Jessie (<i>d</i>. 1914), daughter of Lieutenant-General John Eckford. They had four sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>During the Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1848 Cocks was political officer to the commander-in-chief, Lord Gough, and was present at the battles of Chilianwala and Gujrat, on which latter occasion he was wounded in close combat with a Sikh trooper. He received the Punjab war medal for his services during the campaign.<br>
<br>In 1850 Cocks was briefly a deputy commissioner of the Punjab before taking furlough. In 1854 he was appointed magistrate and collector of Mainpuri and in 1858 judge of Mainpuri. District-level work seems to have best accommodated his desire to do &#145;tangible good&#146; and, but for short postings to Aligarh and the Central Provinces, he remained as judge of Mainpuri until his retirement. During the rebellion of 1857 he joined with a small force of mounted volunteers and engaged in some sturdy but insignificant fighting around Aligarh.<br>
<br>In 1860 Cocks was made a CB, and in 1863 he resigned the service and returned to England. In retirement he became a JP for Worcestershire and from 1865 to 1872 was a captain in the Worcestershire militia. He died at his home, 8 Ashburn Place, Cromwell Road, South Kensington, London, on 29 August 1881. The second of his four sons was father of the sixth Baron Somers.<br>
