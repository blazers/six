<span class="headword">Webster,  Margaret</span>  (1905&#150;1972), <span class="occ">actress and theatre director</span>, was born on 15 March 1905 in New York, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36806/', "Benjamin (Ben) Webster (1864&#150;1947)")</script>, actor and member of a well-known theatrical family, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36809/', "Mary Louise (May) Whitty (1865&#150;1948)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36806/', "Webster, Benjamin")</script>], actress and campaigner for good causes. When Ben's American tour ended the Websters returned with their baby daughter to 31 Bedford Street, off the Strand, their London home for forty-seven years.<br>
<br>Peggy, as she was then known, was educated at Queen Anne's School, Caversham, where she played Puck in a school production of <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>. She studied for the stage at the Etlinger Theatre School. Realizing that her chosen profession was going to be a struggle and that the slight cast she had in one eye would be a handicap, she underwent two successful operations. Her first job was in 1924 as a member of the chorus in <span class="italic">The Trojan Women</span> at the New Theatre, with Sybil Thorndike and Lewis Casson (at 1 guinea a performance). In 1925 she played the Gentlewoman in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> with John Barrymore at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, and then returned to the Cassons to lead the chorus in <span class="italic">Hippolytus</span> followed by her first experience of touring when she understudied Sybil Thorndike in <span class="italic">Saint Joan</span>. Small parts in unmemorable plays were interspersed with appearances with Sunday societies.<br>
<br>On the suggestion of the critic St John Ervine she changed her name to Margaret, but solid success still evaded her until she was spotted in a makeshift production by Lilian Baylis, who offered her a place in the Old Vic company of 1929&#150;30, in which John Gielgud had his first shot at <span class="italic">Richard II</span> and <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> (in which she appeared as the Player Queen). She was in two other plays with Gielgud. The first, <span class="italic">Musical Chairs</span> by Ronald Mackenzie, directed by Komisarjevsky, had a long run which prevented Margaret from joining the Vic at the start of the next season, although she was released to play Lady Macbeth in a production that lived up to the play's reputation for ill luck. She commented that she was probably the only Lady Macbeth to have had four husbands in three weeks. She grew restless during the run of <span class="italic">Richard of Bordeaux</span> (1933), her second engagement with Gielgud in a new play, so in 1935 she turned to directing. In 1937 Maurice Evans, whom she had known when he was an ambitious amateur in London, invited her to direct his <span class="italic">Richard II</span> on Broadway. This was the first of her Shakespearian productions in New York. Although critical of the high costs and a lack of good speaking in the American theatre, she relished the opportunities. Her production of <span class="italic">Othello</span> with Paul Robeson (in which she played Emilia) ran throughout the 1943 Broadway season, which no other Shakespeare play had previously done, and her percentage was the largest she ever received.<br>
<br>With Eva Le Gallienne Margaret Webster hoped to establish the American Repertory Theatre, but this proved to be a short-lived and expensive failure. Having decided that New York was not the right place for the kind of serious theatre they had in mind, she embarked on gruelling bus and truck tours, often visiting towns that had not had a professional theatre for thirty-five years. The long distances, union troubles, and unhappy actors would have broken the spirit of a less determined and idealistic management. The venture was a financial disaster and was dissolved in 1948. To her surprise Rudolf Bing invited her to direct <span class="italic">Don Carlos</span> at the Metropolitan Opera House in 1950. There was a chorus of ninety-eight people, whereas on tour there were eight. She found the production schedules difficult to put into practice but on the whole enjoyed her operatic interlude.<br>
<br>Margaret Webster inherited from her mother a devotion to good causes and fought hard on behalf of Actors' Equity on both sides of the Atlantic. This, and directing Paul Robeson in <span class="italic">Othello</span>, made her suspect in the eyes of Senator McCarthy, and in 1953 she received a summons to appear before the Senate Sub-Committee on Investigations. Her case was dismissed but the experience damaged her confidence for some time. When she returned to Britain in 1955 she was impressed with the state of the theatre and was delighted with an invitation to direct <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span>, a play which had always interested her, although the 1957 Old Vic production was disappointing. In 1960 she was back with the Cassons when she directed No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">Waiting in the Wings</span>. Set in a home for retired actresses, the play had a cast which, as well as Sybil and Lewis, contained several other old friends. She took to lecturing chiefly on Shakespeare, and travelled all over the United States and to South Africa, where she directed Eugene O'Neill's <span class="italic">A Touch of the Poet</span> in 1961. She made good use of her experiences for her book <span class="italic">Shakespeare without Tears</span> (1942). She disliked intensely the idea that Shakespeare wrote for scholars. She wrote and acted in a one-woman programme on the Bront&euml;s which she performed in America and at the Arts Theatre, London, in 1963&#150;4.<br>
<br>In her last years Margaret Webster divided her time between her house on Martha's Vineyard and one in Hampstead, London, which she shared with the novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58791/', "Pamela Sydney Frankau (1908&#150;1967)")</script>. She died of cancer in St Christopher's Hospice, Sydenham, London, on 13 November 1972.<br>
