<span class="headword">Beattie,  John Hugh Marshall</span>  (1915&#150;1990), <span class="occ">social anthropologist</span>, was born on 8 May 1915 at 14 Harthill Avenue, Allerton, Liverpool, the only son and first of the two children of John Crawford Beattie (<i>d</i>. 1916), a civil servant and surveyor of taxes, and Maria Jean Jones (1886&#150;1958), a nurse. His parents, who married in 1912, were both born in Ireland: his father came from the north and his mother from a farming family in co. Wicklow. John Crawford Beattie was given civil service postings in Liverpool, and then in Carlisle, near where John Hugh Marshall Beattie was baptized at Stanwick on 31 October 1915. Beattie senior died in an accident at sea on 3 November 1916, while returning on the <i>Connemara</i> from a visit to Ireland before planning to enlist; the boat was struck by a collier, and sank with the loss of nearly all on board. His widow returned to Ireland with the children, and settled in Monkstown on the outskirts of Dublin. John Beattie attended Dublin high school (1927&#150;33), and then Trinity College, Dublin, where he took a BA degree in mental and moral science in 1937 (and was awarded first place, gold medal, and moderatorship research prize). He then held the position there of assistant lecturer in logic and ethics (1938&#150;9).<br>
<br>Unusually for a philosopher, Beattie decided to apply for a post in the home or colonial service, and was accepted for the latter. The first stage was a training course in Oxford (1939&#150;40) which introduced him to the study of Africa and to anthropology. He was posted to Tanganyika in 1940, and served in Lake Province. On home leave after the war he married Honor Mary Davy (1917&#150;1978) on 27 December 1946. She was an accomplished cellist, who continued to teach and perform throughout her adult life. They returned together to Tanganyika. John was initially posted to Tunduru in the Southern Province, and then transferred to the secretariat in Dar es Salaam, where he served in the department of African affairs and government and became clerk to the legislative and executive councils. A distinguished career in colonial administration no doubt lay ahead.<br>
<br>However, Beattie's interest had been captivated rather by the people and cultural complexities of Africa itself. During a period of accumulated leave in 1949&#150;50 he opted to take the diploma course in general and social anthropology at Oxford, and subsequently decided to leave the colonial service to return to academia. Having gained the BLitt in 1951 with a thesis about checks on political power in African societies, he left for field research in the kingdom of Bunyoro-Kitara in Uganda, before returning to become a university lecturer (later senior lecturer) in social anthropology at Oxford in 1953. After a further period in Uganda in 1955, during which he was acting director of the East African Institute of Social Research, he completed his DPhil in 1956 with a thesis on Bunyoro. In the same year John and Honor acquired the lovely old residence known as The Cottage, Headington Hill, a warm and welcoming family home where their children, Hugh and Frances, were now growing up.<br>
<br>Already a member of Lincoln College, Beattie became a fellow of Linacre House (later Linacre College) in 1964. This appointment recognized his strengths both in teaching and in research in a discipline which was then finding its feet. He was playing a key role in defining the character of post-war British social anthropology, and also becoming well known in the United States (where he was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford in 1959&#150;60 and again in 1966&#150;7). A devoted colleague and disciple of Professor E. E. Evans-Pritchard, Beattie endorsed the shift he advocated from a &#145;natural science&#146; approach in anthropology to a style informed rather by historical, literary, and culturally sensitive insights. Although Beattie was personally agnostic, his writings evidence deep respect for religion in general and for the moral views of others, which he saw as an essential part of social life and action. He excelled as a sympathetic teacher. His introductory book <span class="italic">Other Cultures: Aims, Methods and Achievements in Social Anthropology</span> (1964) became a standard teaching text, well known internationally in English (and translated into Japanese, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Malay). In addition to his reflective writings on topics such as ritual, sacrifice, aspects of the self, and objectivity in anthropology, he published two short but influential ethnographic books (<span class="italic">Bunyoro: an African Kingdom</span>, 1960, and <span class="italic">Understanding Bunyoro</span>, 1965, illuminating his own field methods). He later made an innovative contribution to historical anthropology with <span class="italic">The Nyoro State</span> (1971). Beattie was greatly distressed at news reports of strife in Uganda during his later years. Although he was not able to follow through his research into this later period, his writings remain a testimony to the cultural riches of the country, and now constitute an important historical source in themselves.<br>
<br>Beattie is remembered for his courteous, if firm, defence of the integrity of &#145;the native point of view&#146; and the importance of ethnographic evidence in the face of ambitious theoretical claims of the kind then being put forward by proponents of French structuralism. On Evans-Pritchard's retirement, Beattie accepted an invitation from the University of Leiden to take up a chair of African studies (cultural anthropology), which he held from 1971 to his own retirement in 1975 and return to Oxford. Here he continued to write and to participate in academic activities, but the loss of his wife, Honor, in 1978 led him to withdraw more into private life. He eventually developed Parkinson's disease and died of that condition, aggravated by bronchopneumonia, on 13 April 1990 at Guysfield Residential Home, Willian, Letchworth. He was cremated at Luton on 24 April 1990. A memorial service was organized by Linacre College and held for him at St Cross Church in Oxford on 7 July 1990.<br>
