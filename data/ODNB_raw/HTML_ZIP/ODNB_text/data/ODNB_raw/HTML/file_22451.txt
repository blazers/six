<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pole,  Margaret</span>, <i>suo jure</i> countess of Salisbury  (1473&#150;1541), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10542/', "George, duke of Clarence (1449&#150;1478)")</script>, younger brother of Edward IV, and of his wife, Isabel Neville (1451&#150;1476), eldest daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19955/', "Richard Neville, earl of Warwick and Salisbury (known as the Kingmaker)")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandmarriage"></a>Early life and marriage</h2>At her birth on 14 August 1473 at Farley Castle, near Bath, Margaret's father stood third in line to the throne. Her brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8525/', "Edward, earl of Warwick (1475&#150;1499)")</script>, was the duke's only other surviving child. With the usurpation of Richard, duke of Gloucester, in 1483 the dynastic significance of Margaret and her brother increased. Consequently Richard incorrectly stated that Clarence's attainder barred his children from any claim to the throne, and ordered that they take up residence at Sheriff Hutton Castle in Yorkshire from September 1483. Henry VII's tenuous claims to the throne, combined with the disappearance of Edward IV's sons, further enhanced their importance at his accession in 1485.<br>
<br>Following the Lambert Simnel uprising which championed the dynastic rights of Margaret's brother and culminated in the battle of Stoke on 16 June 1487, Henry arranged Margaret's marriage to <a name="cosubject_75344"></a><span class="headword">Sir Richard Pole</span>  (1458/9&#150;1504)<span class="occ"></span> to ensure that she would not become a figurehead around which another rising might form. The marriage probably took place in November 1487. Her altered circumstances made it less than Margaret might have once expected, and it has been considered a disparagement. However, Margaret was not a woman of wealth and at the time of her marriage had no lands or possessions of her own. Furthermore, Sir Richard's ancestry, while not as illustrious as Margaret's, was certainly not of low degree.<br>
<br>Born in 1458 or 1459, Sir Richard was the eldest surviving child of Geoffrey Pole, esquire (<i>d</i>. 1479), a Welshman who, it has been suggested, could claim descent from the princes of Powys. Richard's mother was Edith St John, half-sister of Margaret Beaufort, so making Richard Henry VII's cousin of the half-blood. Capable and loyal, with an endearing personality, Richard became one of the most crucial members of Henry's regime. Knighted after the battle of Stoke, he was at various times appointed an esquire of the body, constable of the castles of Harlech, Conwy, Montgomery, and Beaumaris, sheriff of Merioneth, chamberlain of north Wales, chamberlain of Chester, and a member of the council in the marches of Wales. In 1495, following Sir William Stanley's fall, Richard replaced him as justice of north Wales, and as constable of Caernarfon Castle and captain of the town. In 1493 he was appointed lord chamberlain to Prince Arthur, whose household was established that year at Ludlow. His high rank was recognized at Arthur's funeral when he received 29 yards of cloth, as was deemed appropriate for a baron with a retinue of six men. Pole was also appointed to commissions of the peace and various other commissions, several times held the position of captain in the king's army, and was steward and receiver of the lordships of Montgomery, Ceri, Cedewain, and Elvell. In April 1499 he officiated at the proxy wedding of Prince Arthur to Katherine of Aragon and was elected to the Order of the Garter in the same year. Following Arthur's death Richard's royal duties continued and in 1503 he accompanied Princess Margaret to Scotland for her marriage to King James IV. Sir Richard died in October 1504 and Henry granted his widow &pound;52 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. along with a loan of &pound;40 to be repaid under generous terms, to ensure that her husband's funeral would be honourable. Richard Pole had inherited the manors of Medmenham, Ellesborough, and Stoke Mandeville in Buckinghamshire from his father, while the king granted him the manors of Long Wittenham and Fifield in Oxfordshire, probably upon his marriage.<h2>
<a name="Peerandpatron"></a>Peer and patron</h2>Margaret Pole had begun her married life at Bockmer in Medmenham, but she also resided at Stourton Castle in Staffordshire to be near her husband while he carried out his duties in Wales, and it was here that their son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22456/', "Reginald Pole")</script> was born. Margaret bore her husband five surviving children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22448/', "Henry Pole, the future Lord Montagu (1492&#150;1539)")</script>, Arthur (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1527/8), Ursula (<i>d</i>. 1570), Reginald (1500&#150;1558), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22447/', "Geoffrey Pole (d. 1558)")</script>. From December 1501 Margaret was a member of Katherine of Aragon's household and this marked the beginning of a loyal friendship, but she ceased to serve Katherine after Prince Arthur's death in 1502. Following her own husband's death Margaret was left in a difficult financial situation; her jointure provided little income, while Sir Richard's salary had come to an end. One consequence was that she was forced to give Reginald to the church, relinquishing all financial responsibility for him, an act he resentfully threw back in her face in 1536: &#145;you never took any care to provide for my living nor otherwise, as you did for other&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 11, no. 92). However, her fortunes improved with the accession of Henry VIII in 1509. She immediately became a member of Queen Katherine's chamber, and in February 1512 was restored to the earldom of Salisbury and all those lands which her brother Edward had held at the time of his death, a tacit recognition of the injustice of his execution. Although Margaret agreed to pay 5000 marks for her restoration, the terms were very generous when compared to the amounts other peers were constrained to pay. Margaret's lands were worth over &pound;2000, but John Tuchet, Lord Audley, paid 6500 marks for the restoration of lands worth only &pound;545 17<i>s</i>. 17<i>d</i>.<br>
<br>As countess of Salisbury, Margaret Pole was the first and, apart from Anne Boleyn, the only woman in sixteenth-century England to hold a peerage title in her own right. Her estates fell within seventeen English counties, predominantly in the south and the midlands, in addition to lands in Wales and Calais. In 1538 her gross annual income of &pound;2311 revealed her to be among the top five wealthiest peers of her generation and potentially one of the most influential women in England. An active landlord and employer, she appointed her officers, several of whom were women, wisely. Although her position was in direct contradiction to what was advocated for women, in many areas she successfully operated on an equal level with her male counterparts, for instance in the marriage negotiations of her children and grandchildren and in litigation. However, there were some areas in which her gender proved a barrier and it was here that she utilized the services of her sons, particularly Henry, Lord Montagu, who led her men in battle, sat in the Lords on her behalf, and represented her on commissions of the peace. The countess was also a supporter of the &#145;new learning&#146; and a patron of humanist scholars, including Gentian Hervet of Orl&eacute;ans who translated Erasmus's <span class="italic">De immensa misericordia Dei</span> into English at her command. Margaret's association with humanist scholars was no doubt encouraged by her son Reginald, who provided a channel of introduction for his humanist friends to his mother. Margaret maintained four main residences, but her principal seat was Warblington Castle in Hampshire, which she commissioned in 1517. It was at Warblington that she founded a hospital, while further up the coast in Christchurch Priory an impressive chantry was built as her intended resting place.<h2>
<a name="TheyoungerPoles"></a>The younger Poles</h2>Margaret Pole's restoration was obviously beneficial to her children, and in 1514 her second son, <a name="cosubject_75345"></a><span class="headword">Sir Arthur Pole</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1527/8)<span class="occ"></span>, was among those chosen to accompany the king's sister Mary Tudor to France for her marriage to Louis XII. A natural courtier, by 1516 he had been appointed an esquire of the body and in 1518 was among those six young men who were described as gentlemen of the privy chamber. An enthusiastic jouster, sophisticated and witty, he also enjoyed a close friendship with the third duke of Buckingham. Following the duke's fall Arthur suffered for this friendship and was expelled from court, but by October 1522 he had been restored to favour and had gained the king's support in a dispute with his father-in-law. Between 1519 and 1522 Arthur had married as her second husband Jane Pickering, daughter of Sir Roger Lewknor and a considerable heiress, and in 1522 unsuccessfully tried to obtain her father's lands at farm. In 1522 Arthur served in France under the duke of Suffolk, who knighted him there on 1 November. It is unclear if Arthur was expelled from the privy chamber in the purge of 1519, but in 1526 the Eltham ordinances caused his removal to the outer chamber, where he again served with the title of squire of the body. The date and cause of his death are unknown, but the likeliest possibility is that he died about 1527 or 1528 from the sweating sickness; he was buried at Bisham. According to Arthur's widow, following his death she was pressurized by the countess of Salisbury and Lord Montagu into taking a vow of perpetual chastity in order to safeguard the inheritance of her husband's children: Henry, Mary, and Margaret. The daughters were placed in the household of his mother, while by 1543 or 1544 Henry was dead. In 1539, following the fall of the Pole family, Jane disregarded her vow and married Sir William Barentyne. The act of parliament of 1543/4 which made provision for Sir Roger Lewknor's other daughters, and declared Jane's children from her marriage to Barentyne to be legitimate in spite of her vow, ensured that Arthur's daughters inherited considerably less than initially expected.<br>
<br>A similar fate befell Margaret Pole's only daughter, Ursula [<a name="cosubject_75346"></a><span class="headword">Ursula Stafford</span>, Lady Stafford  (<em>d.</em> 1570)<span class="occ"></span>]. The latter is first recorded on 22 November 1513, when the king granted &#145;our dear and wellbeloved cousin&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 18826, fol. 38) several gowns, kirtles, and costly materials. In 1515, as a member of the royal family, she was mentioned as a possible bride for the duke of Milan but on 20 October 1518 she made a spectacular marriage with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26205/', "Henry Stafford (1501&#150;1563)")</script>, son and heir of the duke of Buckingham. The duke was fond of her and in 1519 gave &#145;to my daughters Ursula and Mary &pound;3 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 3/1, no. 1285, p. 499), but following his fall in 1521 Ursula and her husband found themselves in a difficult situation financially. In 1522 and 1531 they were jointly granted various manors and lands out of the duke's estates, but not the most valuable ones, and in 1537 Stafford wrote to Cromwell asking to be allowed to buy some dissolved monastic property and threatening to leave the country due to his poverty. To help ease the burden one of their daughters, Margaret, was placed in the household of the countess of Salisbury, who paid 22<i>s</i>. 6<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub><i>d</i>. towards her granddaughter's board during her stay in London in 1538. Another daughter, Dorothy [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69753/', "Stafford, Dorothy")</script>], entered the household of the future queen, Elizabeth. Ursula survived her family's fall and upon Mary's accession Baron Stafford (as he became in 1547) happily exploited the relationship which had existed between the queen and his late mother-in-law, reminding Mary that his wife's family &#145;chose death rather than consent to your disinheritance in your tender years&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 11/1, no. 17). During this period Ursula enjoyed a close relationship with her niece Katherine, countess of Huntingdon, who was Lord Montagu's eldest daughter, and they visited each other often. Warm relations also existed between Ursula and her brother Cardinal Reginald Pole who had returned from exile in November 1554, despite the fact that he did not have &#145;a very high opinion&#146; of Lord Stafford  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1557&#150;8</i>, no. 1287). Ursula outlived her husband and her siblings and died on 12 August 1570. The lands which had been granted to her and her husband in 1522 and 1531, and which she still possessed in 1570, were valued at &pound;175 8<i>s</i>. 11&frac14;<i>d</i>. Her heir was her son Edward Stafford.<h2>
<a name="Undersuspicion"></a>Under suspicion</h2>By 1518 Margaret Pole's restoration to the earldom of Salisbury had been marred by the repossession of several of her manors. It was unclear whether they belonged to the earldom of Salisbury or were part of the duchy of Somerset as the king was now alleging. In strict law neither party was entitled to the manors, but the king's claims were stronger and Margaret's stubborn refusal to accept this was a serious misjudgement. Relations were further damaged by Margaret's open support for Katherine of Aragon and Princess Mary following Henry's decision to annul his marriage. By May 1520 Margaret had been appointed governess to the princess and, although she had been removed by July 1521, when her sons came under suspicion of involvement with the duke of Buckingham's treason, she was reappointed in 1525. In 1533 she refused Henry's request to surrender the princess's jewels and plate, prompting the embattled Lord Hussey, Mary's lord chamberlain, to write to Cromwell &#145;wolde to god that the kyng and you dyd knowe and se what I have had to do here of late&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/78, fol. 160). When Mary's household was dissolved in December 1533 Margaret's offer to serve the princess at her own expense was firmly refused. Suggestions that she was implicated in the Nun of Kent affair, and her attempt to thwart the appointment of Cromwell's nominee as prior of Bisham, contributed to her deteriorating relationship with the king. When Chapuys asked in 1535 that Mary should again be placed under Margaret's care Henry exploded, describing the countess as &#145;a fool, of no experience&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 8, no. 263). Margaret's return to court in 1536 following the fall of Anne Boleyn was swiftly curtailed by the arrival of Reginald Pole's letter to Henry VIII, <span class="italic">De unitate</span>, which declared his opposition to the royal supremacy. Following a message from the king Margaret sent Reginald a letter of rebuke which was no doubt intended to be seen by the king's council. Although the letter admonished Reginald, it described his actions merely as &#145;folly&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 11, no. 93) and could have been delivered in much stronger terms.<br>
<br>In August 1538 Geoffrey Pole was arrested following the discovery that he had been in communication with his brother Reginald, and the whole family was implicated along with several friends and associates. Margaret's interrogation began on 12 November and was carried out by William Fitzwilliam, earl of Southampton, and Thomas Goodrich, bishop of Ely. Innocent of any treasonous activity, she responded with firm and clear answers to all questions, Fitzwilliam declaring &#145;we have dealid with such a one as men have not dealid with to fore us, Wee may call hyr rather a strong and custaunt man than a woman&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS, appx L, fol. 79). Despite Fitzwilliam's dislike of her, his inability to intimidate her prompted a grudging tribute to her strength of character, &#145;we suppose, that there hath not been seen or her[d of a] woman, so earnest in her co[untenance] manlique in continuance and &hellip; so precise aswell in gest[ure or in] words, that wonder is to be&#146;  (ibid., fol. 77<i>b</i>).<h2>
<a name="Attainderandexecution"></a>Attainder and execution</h2>Margaret Pole was initially kept in custody at Cowdray, Fitzwilliam's residence, but by November 1539 she had been removed to the Tower. Her attainder passed through parliament in May 1539 in which she was accused, along with Hugh Vaughan, of having aided and abetted her sons Henry and Reginald and of having &#145;comytted and p[er]petrated div[er]se and sundrie other detestable and abhomynable treasons&#146;  (TNA: PRO, C.65/147, m. 22). In order to facilitate the endorsement of her attainder in the Lords, Cromwell produced a tunic allegedly found in one of her coffers which symbolized Reginald Pole's intention to marry Mary and restore papal authority to England. In all likelihood this tunic was fabricated by Cromwell, as Warblington and the countess's coffers had been thoroughly searched at her arrest in November 1538, and it is hard to believe that it did not come to light until six months later.<br>
<br>The strategic position of Margaret Pole's estates on the south coast, the perceived invasion threat of 1539 in which Reginald Pole was involved, and her embittered relationship with Henry VIII precluded any chance of pardon. However, while in the Tower she was well provided for, the king paying &pound;13 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. a month for the diets of herself, her grandson Henry, son of Lord Montagu, and the son of the marquess of Exeter. She was also allowed a waiting woman to attend upon her who was paid 18<i>d</i>. a week. In March 1541 the queen's tailor was paid &pound;11 16<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. as reimbursement for apparel bought and made for her and a month later a further 66<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. was spent on necessaries for her. The decision to execute her only two months after Henry had spent a considerable sum on her new clothes suggests that it was a spontaneous, rather than a premeditated, one and might have resulted from her implication in the suspected involvement of Sir Thomas Wyatt and Sir John Wallop with Reginald Pole. The rising in the north in 1541 led by Sir John Neville, motivated by animosity to the royal supremacy, and the possible plans by Reginald to rescue his mother would also have contributed. In any case there seems to have been pressure to clear the Tower; according to Marillac, writing on 29 May, &#145;before St Johns tide, they reckon to empty the Tower of the prisoners now there for treason&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 16, no. 868). At 7 o'clock on the morning of 27 May 1541, Margaret was hustled out to a small block. After commending her soul to God, asking the small group present to pray for the royal family, and requesting to be remembered to Princess Mary, she suffered at the hands of &#145;a wretched and blundering youth &hellip; who literally hacked her head and shoulders to pieces in the most pitiful manner&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1538&#150;42</i>, no. 166). Upon hearing the news of her death, her son Reginald announced to his &#145;thunder-struck&#146; secretary that he was now the proud son of a martyr and disappeared into his closet for an hour, &#145;then came out as cheerful as before&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of Cardinal Reginald Pole</span>, 155&#150;6).<br>
<br>Margaret Pole's body was laid to rest in the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula at the Tower, where her remains were discovered in 1876, revealing her to have been of above average height. The portrait believed to be of Margaret which hangs in the National Portrait Gallery has been approximately dated to between 1515 and 1525, thus probably capturing the countess in her forties. In 1886 she was beatified by Pope Leo XIII because she, and many others, had laid down their lives for the dignity of the Holy See &#145;and for the truth of the orthodox Faith&#146;  (Bartollini, 1).<br>
