<span class="headword">Kekewich, Sir  George William</span>  (1841&#150;1921), <span class="occ">civil servant and politician</span>, was born on 1 April 1841, the fourth son of Samuel Trehawke Kekewich (1796&#150;1873), landowner and MP for South Devon, and his second wife, Louisa, only daughter of Lewis William Buck, MP for North Devon. He had three brothers and seven sisters. He was educated at Eton College and at Balliol College, Oxford, taking a second-class degree in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1863. Rejecting the possibility of a career in the church, Kekewich started reading for the law at Lincoln's Inn but in 1867 readily accepted an appointment to the education department as an examiner through the patronage of Sir Stafford Northcote, a distant relative. He was promoted to senior examiner in 1871 and in 1890 Lord Cranbrook appointed him permanent secretary on Patrick Cumin's death, being impressed by his grasp of departmental matters as well as his liberal education views.<br>
<br>Kekewich desired equity in education and believed that schoolteachers should be free to implement the task entrusted to them. The education code of 1890 reflected his views and initiated the demise of the Draconian system of payment by results introduced by Robert Lowe in 1861. Similarly, the establishment of the principle of free elementary education in the 1891 <span class="roman">Education Act</span> owed much to his success in circumventing the more reactionary aims of Lord Salisbury. From 1892 to 1895 he enjoyed a harmonious working relationship with the Liberal vice-president A. H. D. Acland and their adjustments to the annual education department Code effected a liberalization of the elementary school curriculum. The Code was used also to force incompetent schools to improve and the issuing of <span class="roman">Circular 321</span> in 1893 enforced adherence to the required standards for buildings and facilities. Innovations were made in the education of handicapped children, while steps were taken to initiate reform of the secondary school system. These changes were the necessary precursors to a more fundamental overhaul of the system, but one consequence of the election of Lord Salisbury's Unionist government in 1895 was that Kekewich would not oversee this.<br>
<br>An initial rapport with his two new political masters, the eighth duke of Devonshire and Sir John Gorst, allowed Kekewich to continue to contribute to policy formulation and in 1900 he was appointed secretary of the newly created Board of Education. Thereafter he found it difficult to accept policies designed to establish new local education authorities based upon the county and county borough councils and involving the demise of the <i>ad hoc</i> school boards, which he had encouraged since their inception in 1870. His opposition alienated him from the government and he was deemed unfit to ensure the successful implementation of the 1902 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>. His premature retirement was enforced in October 1902, with Robert Morant succeeding him. Kekewich's feeling of injustice was so strong that his first act was to resign from the Junior Carlton Club and thereafter he campaigned vigorously against the act. In 1906 he was elected as Liberal MP for Exeter, a seat he held until 1910; but his hopes that the Liberal governments would redress the imbalances of the 1902 act remained unfulfilled. His lively memoir, <span class="italic">The Education Department and After</span> (1920), provides useful insights about the governance of English education in the late nineteenth century but has to be treated with caution because of its embittered mien.<br>
<br>Kekewich's achievements in education reform have been overshadowed by those of his more charismatic successor but his administration was beneficent. By 1900 he could see the promised land and, while he did not enter it, his efforts earned him the gratitude of many teachers; in 1903 he was made the first honorary member of the National Union of Teachers. A devotee of salmon fishing, which he believed to be a panacea for all human ills, Kekewich was also a keen gardener. He was married twice: first, on 19 November 1863, to Hannah (<i>d</i>. March 1890), daughter of George Lovegrove; and then, on 10 June 1890, to Agnes Jane (<i>d</i>. 1931), daughter of William Symmons. He died at 6 Sackville Gardens, Hove, Sussex, on 5 July 1921. He was appointed CB in 1891, KCB in 1895, and was awarded the honorary degree of DCL by Durham University in 1897.<br>
