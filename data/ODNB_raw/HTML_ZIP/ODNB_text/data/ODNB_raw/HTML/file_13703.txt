<span class="headword">Hoole,  John</span>  (1727&#150;1803), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was born in December 1727 in Moorfields, London, one of six children of Samuel Hoole (<i>b</i>. 1692), mechanician, and his wife, Sarah (<i>c</i>.1700&#150;<i>c</i>.1793), daughter of James Drury, clockmaker, of Clerkenwell, London. He attended James Bennet's school at Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, after being educated by an uncle (the &#145;<i>metaphysical taylor</i>&#146;, according to Johnson; <span class="italic">Boswell's Life of Johnson</span>, 4.187). Hoole enjoyed languages and studied Italian for pleasure. After an unsuccessful attempt to join the theatre, he went as clerk to the East India Company in 1744 where he gained promotion to auditor, wrote <span class="italic">Present State of the English East India Company's Affairs</span> (1772) and remained there until his retirement.<br>
<br>On 25 May 1757 he married Susanna Smith (<i>c</i>.1730&#150;1808), a &#145;handsome Quakeress&#146;  (W. Foster, 156) of Bishop's Stortford. They had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64787/', "Samuel Hoole")</script>. In 1760 John Hoole's first publication <span class="italic">A Monody: to the Memory of Mrs Margaret Woffington</span> appeared. However, it was his interest in translating Italian literature, encouraged by George Oldmixon, a colleague and Italian scholar, as well as his friendship with Dr Samuel Johnson, that forwarded Hoole's reputation. In 1763 he published <span class="italic">Jerusalem Delivered</span> (a translation of Tasso's <span class="italic">Gerusalemme liberata</span>), having had the first book printed in 1761 for his friends. His labours on Tasso's works (<span class="italic">Rinaldo</span> was published in 1792) earned him the nickname Tasso Hoole. Although <span class="italic">Jerusalem Delivered</span> was generally favourably received, Sir Walter Scott, introduced to Tasso &#145;through the flat medium of Mr Hoole's translation&#146;, said the translator was &#145;a noble transmuter of gold into lead&#146;  (Lockhart, 1.29 and 5.9). Charles Lamb, wishing to &#145;gain some idea of Tasso from this Mr Hoole, the great boast and ornament of the India House &hellip; found him more vapid than smallest small beer &#147;sun-vinegared&#148;&#146;  (Fitzgerald, 1.357). Hoole's later <span class="italic">Works of Metastasio</span> (1767) pleased Metastasio himself, although the poet expressed the difficulty of translating Italian poetry effectively.<br>
<br>Samuel Johnson was introduced to Hoole by John Hawkesworth in 1761, and helped the translator's literary career, participating in nearly every publication in some way. He wrote dedications to <span class="italic">Jerusalem Delivered</span> and <span class="italic">Works of Metastasio</span>, urged Warren Hastings, then governor of Bengal, to promote Hoole's works, and encouraged Hoole to adapt plays for the stage. In return Hoole gathered members &#145;who were not <i>patriots</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Boswell's Life of Johnson</span>, 4.87) for Johnson's City Club, belonged to the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/71336', "Essex Head Club")</script> which, dominated by literary figures, had its rules set by Johnson and, with his wife and son, the Revd Samuel Hoole, attended Johnson on his deathbed. Jeremy Bentham viewed such intimacy cynically, calling Hoole one of Johnson's &#145;lickspittles&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Samuel Johnson</span>, 2.363). Johnson bequeathed a book apiece of their choosing to Hoole and his son, while in his own will Hoole left a writing desk formerly belonging to Johnson. Following Johnson's death Hoole published a detailed narrative of his friend's last days.<br>
<br>Hoole's three tragedies, <span class="italic">Cyrus</span> (first performed 1768), <span class="italic">Timanthes</span> (1770), and <span class="italic">Cleonice</span> (1775), were enacted at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden. The failure of <span class="italic">Cleonice</span>, in spite of Johnson's being sure of its success, prompted Hoole to return much of the advanced copyright money for he reasoned that, it being unlikely to be profitable for booksellers, it should not be a loss. <span class="italic">Cyrus</span> and <span class="italic">Timanthes</span> were reasonably successful due, contemporaries implied, to the popularity of the cast members, Mrs Mary Ann Yates in particular.<br>
<br>Having lived in and around London at Wandsworth, Clement's Inn (about 1768), then Shire Lane (1775), Hoole moved to Great Queen Street. From here in 1783 he published his translation of Ariosto's <span class="italic">Orlando Furioso</span>. Included in this first edition was his portrait by Frances Reynolds (sister of Sir Joshua) who temporarily lived with the Hoole family at Great Queen Street. In 1785 Hoole added a biographical sketch to John Scott's <span class="italic">Critical Essays</span> (1785). The following year, having retired from the East India Company, he moved with his wife to live with their son at Abinger, near Dorking, where Samuel had a curacy. Short-sighted, &#145;of middling stature and of athletic make&#146;, a contemporary described Hoole as &#145;gentle, unassuming and affectionate&#146;  (W. Foster, 162). Several portraits were made, including one engraved by his nephew Anker Smith. Most of Hoole's works were reprinted several times but now he is regarded primarily as one of Johnson's circle rather than for his own endeavours. He died on a visit to Dorking on 2 August 1803 and was buried there.<br>
