<span class="headword">Lynn,  William</span>  (1792&#150;1870), <span class="occ">hotelier and sports promoter</span>, was born in 1792 at East Grinstead, but nothing else is known about his early life. He first ventured into the catering trade in London before moving to Liverpool, where in the 1820s he leased the Waterloo Hotel in Ranelagh Street in the suburb of Aintree. He was renowned for the excellence of his seafood&#151;for over forty years he supervised the city's municipal banquets&#151;but his efforts as a sports promoter led to the establishment of the Waterloo cup, hare-coursing's premier event, and the Grand National, the world's most famous steeplechase. Nevertheless, like many publicans and hoteliers of the time, it is probable that he provided sports events as an adjunct to his hotel trade, anticipating that customers would be attracted by the entertainment.<br>
<br>Lynn's first race promotion was in 1828 when he provided the Waterloo Gold Cup, value &pound;100, for a flat race at the Maghull racecourse's second recognized meeting. The next year he leased the adjoining Aintree course, erected a grandstand, and ran a flat-race meeting. Soon he was organizing three meetings there a year and in October 1835 he devoted one of them to hurdle events. Captain Martin Becher (after whom Aintree's Becher's Brook fence is named) rode two winners, both with the same horse, Vivian, and in an ensuing conversation remarked on the success which his friend Tom Coleman had had with the Great St Albans Steeplechase. This tempted Lynn to announce the running of a steeplechase at Aintree for 29 February 1836, appropriately leap year day. The event proved popular with spectators as, unlike most steeplechase courses, which were point-to-point across country, this involved two circuits of a 2 mile course, most of which was visible from the grandstand. In 1839, however, Lynn's name was missing from the Aintree card. The traditional story is that ill health forced him to withdraw from the project, but, given his longevity, this may have been a diplomatic excuse to cover his precarious financial position. He continued to act as secretary to the Aintree Racing Company until 1843 but was declared bankrupt in June 1844.<br>
<br>Lynn has certainly been treated unfairly in sports history: not only does the official history of the Grand National fail to mention his name, but, somewhat illogically, turf historians have always regarded the 1839 race as the first Grand National, despite the earlier races. The title of the race remained the Grand Liverpool until 1843, when it became the Liverpool and National; the more famous name was adopted only in 1847.<br>
<br>Lynn's other sporting achievement was the founding of the Waterloo cup for hare-coursing in 1836. Melanie, a dog nominated by Lynn, won the event, though its owner was Lord Molyneux, eldest son of the earl of Sefton on whose Altcar land the contest was run. The prize at the inaugural meeting was a silver snuff-box and 16 sovereigns&#151;the stake money from the eight participants.<br>
<br>Little is known about Lynn's activities from 1843. He continued as a hotelier until August 1870 when the Waterloo was acquired by a railway company in order to construct a station. He died two months later in the early hours of 11 October 1870 at his home, Norwood Lodge, Norwood Grove, West Derby, Liverpool. He was buried in the grounds of Liverpool Cathedral. His obituary in the <span class="italic">Liverpool Mercury</span> makes no mention of wife or children.<br>
