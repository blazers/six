<span class="headword">Powell,  William Samuel</span>  (1717&#150;1775), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born at Colchester on 27 September 1717, the elder son of the Revd Francis Powell and his wife, Susan, the daughter of Samuel Reynolds (<i>d</i>. 1694), MP for Colchester, and widow of George Jolland. He was educated at Colchester grammar school, under the Revd Palmer Smythies, and admitted pensioner at St John's College, Cambridge, on 7 July 1734. In November 1735 he was elected a foundation scholar, and he held exhibitions from his college in November 1735, 1736, and 1738. He graduated BA (1739), MA (1742), BD (1749), and DD (1757). He was admitted as a fellow of St John's on 25 March 1740.<br>
<br>In 1741 Powell became private tutor to Charles Townshend (second son of Viscount Townshend), who later became chancellor of the exchequer. At the end of that year he was ordained deacon and priest, and was presented to the rectory of Colkirk in Norfolk on 13 January 1742 by Lord Townshend. In 1742 he returned to college life, and was assistant tutor for two years, becoming principal tutor in 1744; in 1745 he acted as senior taxor of the university. His closest Cambridge friends were Thomas Balguy and Richard Hurd; he tutored at St John's the poet William Mason, who later became an important figure in the Hurd circle. On 3 November 1760 he became a senior fellow of the college; he resigned his fellowship in 1763, having left Cambridge for a house in London in 1761, when he inherited the property of a cousin. This inheritance later provoked comment when Powell himself died, leaving some &pound;30,000 in his will. The inheritance came through his mother's eldest brother's marriage to Frances, daughter of Charles Pelham of Brocklesby, Lincolnshire, a member of the duke of Newcastle's family. On the death of their son, Charles Reynolds of Peldon Hall, Essex, that estate, along with other Essex property in Little Bentley and Wix, came to Powell.<br>
<br>On 25 January 1765, backed by the influence of the duke of Newcastle, Powell was unanimously elected master of St John's College, where, following his inheritance, he lived for the rest of his life in some style. Powell had been admitted a fellow of the Royal Society on 15 March 1764; in November 1765 he succeeded to the vice-chancellorship of Cambridge. In December 1766 he was appointed to the archdeaconry of Colchester by the crown. In 1768 he somewhat controversially claimed for himself the rich college rectory of Freshwater on the Isle of Wight (worth &pound;500 a year), which was in the master's option, resigning the benefice of Colkirk in the process. Freshwater was naturally a living coveted by the fellows, and Powell's tactless action was defended by a later biographer, Thomas Hughes, as necessary in guaranteeing that his successor as master could afford to entertain on a scale commensurate with his standing. The consequent ill feeling in the college was mitigated by Powell's personal gift of some &pound;500 to rebuild the first court and to lay out the college grounds under the care of Capability Brown. A strict disciplinarian and a careful steward of the college's revenues, he secured the first place in the university for St John's College. In his first year as master he established college examinations, for which he drew up the papers, and which he always made sure to attend in person. This encouraged applications to a college which was thus seen to be committed to improving academic standards, and it was jealousy of the position thereby achieved that led Powell vigorously to oppose John Jebb's proposal for annual examinations for all students of the university in general subjects. Powell published anonymously in 1774 <span class="italic">An Observation on the Design of Establishing Annual Examinations at Cambridge</span>, to which Mrs Jebb replied in <span class="italic">A Letter to the Author</span>. Powell, a firmly committed Johnian, helped out several of his students financially, enabling them to complete their studies. He also bestowed college prizes at his own expense. All students, whatever their year might be, had to pass an examination in one of the gospels or the <span class="roman">Acts of the Apostles</span>. He attended chapel throughout the year, at six o'clock in the morning. He was a man of rigid and unbending manners.<br>
<br>In addition to the engagement with the Jebbs, Powell provoked two serious controversies at Cambridge, the first of which inadvertently initiated the major controversy concerning undergraduate and clerical subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> which led to the Feathers tavern petition in 1772 [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93823', "Feathers tavern petitioners")</script>]. This was effected through a sermon preached before the university on Commencement Sunday in 1757, and which was published that year as <span class="italic">A Defence of the Subscriptions Required in the Church of England</span>; it was reprinted in 1758, 1759, and 1772. He argued that the articles were studiedly general and indeterminate, providing a means of reading the scriptures which conformed to &#145;the general voice of learned men through the nation&#146;. Powell argued that latitude in the expression of the articles allowed for those improvements in theology which required latitude in their turn. Orthodox critics disliked Powell's latitudinarian position on the matter, while Francis Blackburne, an ultra-latitudinarian and Powell's chief critic, denounced his arguments as being casuistical in the extreme, acting as the denial of religious and moral freedom. In <span class="italic">Remarks</span> on the sermon which he published in 1758 Blackburne questioned the wisdom of Powell's choice of theme for a commencement sermon, since it revived a controversy which did little credit to the Church of England.<br>
<br>The second controversy was of an altogether more personal, indeed collegiate character (it became increasingly difficult to separate the two interests during Powell's years as a fellow and then as master). The Lucasian professorship of mathematics had become vacant in 1760, and among the candidates were Edward Waring of Magdalene College and William Ludlam of St John's College. Waring distributed a portion of his <span class="italic">Miscellanea analytica</span> in support of his candidature, which Powell anonymously attacked in order to serve the interests of Ludlam, a fellow Johnian, in <span class="italic">Observations on the First Chapter of a Book called &#145;Miscellanea analytica&#146;</span> (1760). Waring replied to the piece, to which Powell retorted, again anonymously, in his <span class="italic">Defence of the Observations</span>, which Waring answered in a <span class="italic">Letter</span>. Waring had much the better of the debate.<br>
<br>Powell had a stroke of apoplexy in 1770, and died in his chair from paralysis on 19 January 1775. He was buried in the college chapel on 25 January, the anniversary of his election as master, and a flat blue stone, with an epitaph by Balguy, was placed over his vault. He was unmarried and left his property to his niece, Miss Jolland, who had lived with him. An annuity of &pound;150 was left to his sister, Susanna Powell, a matron of the Chelsea Hospital, from whom he was early distanced: they were too alike in character to get on. He also left &pound;1000 to Dr Balguy, and a sum to be equally divided between six fellows and four members of the college who had been his contemporaries. These collegiate legacies were the subject of some disapproving comment at the time. Jeremiah Markland, the classical scholar, a notably charitable fellow of Peterhouse, thought that an unmarried divine leaving such a sum in his will looked decidedly &#145;<i>unscriptural</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1785). Powell's books were left to four of the college's fellows.<br>
<br>Besides the works mentioned above Powell wrote two others. <span class="italic">The Heads of a Course of Lectures on Experimental Philosophy</span>, published anonymously in 1746 and 1753, demonstrated a particular interest in optics, and was the result of the still comparatively rare practice of providing intercollegiate lectures at Cambridge. A posthumous work, <span class="italic">Discourses on Various Subjects</span>, (1776), was edited by Dr Balguy, who provided an outline of Powell's life and work by way of an introduction. Powell's controversial commencement sermon was included in the collection. They were reprinted, together with the discourses of the Revd James Fawcett, by Thomas Hughes in 1832, who also provided a somewhat defensive account of Powell's career by way of introduction.<br>
