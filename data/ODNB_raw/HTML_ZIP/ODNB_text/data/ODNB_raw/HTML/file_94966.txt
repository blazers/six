<span class="headword">Johnson,  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1836&#150;1917), <span class="occ">assistant bishop of Western Equatorial Africa</span>, was born at Kakanda Town, a freed slave settlement near Waterloo, Sierra Leone. His parents were both Yoruba from Nigeria. They met and married in Sierra Leone, where each had arrived separately after liberation at sea by the Royal Navy. James Johnson was their only son, born a twin with his sister Eliza. His parents, converts to Christianity, were illiterate and failed to register his birth.<br>
<br>The family settled in Benguema. By 1843 James Johnson was enrolled in a nearby school of the West African Methodist church, which had seceded from the English Methodists in 1821. The ideal of an African-managed church was one that would remain with Johnson all his life. Some time before 1847 he entered the Anglican Church Missionary Society (CMS) school in St Matthew's parish of Waterloo. In 1851 he won a scholarship to the society's grammar school in Freetown. On 1 June 1854 he was admitted to the Fourah Bay Institution, which trained Anglican clergy. After graduating on 3 December 1858 he became a catechist in the village of Kent, where a spiritual experience occurred in which &#145;the Lord spoke to me&#146; and &#145;I found salvation&#146;  (Johnson, 17). He resolved to dedicate his life to missionary work. His parents had taught him an abiding hatred of the slave trade and slavery, and a deep gratitude to their British rescuers. Now he committed himself to Anglican theology (regarding other protestants as &#145;dissenters&#146; and Roman Catholics as &#145;idolaters&#146;) in a life of intense piety and dogmatism which would draw both admiration of his principles and condemnation of his inflexibility.<br>
<br>After two years' teaching at the grammar school, in March 1863 Johnson was appointed deacon and curate of Christ Church, Pademba Road, Freetown. In December 1866 he was ordained to the priesthood. The development of his clerical career coincided with the ascendancy of the ideas of Henry Venn, secretary of the CMS from 1841 to 1872, whose vision was the creation of African missionary clergy to manage self-sufficient native churches, exemplified in 1864 by the appointment of Samuel Ajayi Crowther as bishop of the society's Niger mission. Johnson expanded these ideas into a &#145;nationalist&#146; vision of an African church giving birth to an Africa which would &#145;take her place with the most Christian, civilized and intelligent Nations&#146;  (Ayandele, <span class="italic">Holy Johnson</span>, 45). This blend of &#145;nationalist&#146; feelings and missionary impulse provoked opposition from the European missionaries on the spot, backed by some of the African pastors, but at CMS headquarters Johnson's ideals and integrity were admired.<br>
<br>While making his first visit to England in January 1874 Johnson campaigned for the elevation of the Fourah Bay Institution to that of a university college and for African agency in missionary expansion. Meeting the colonial secretary, Lord Knutsford, he outlined his educational plans, and pressed for elected Africans to sit in the legislature. He impressed those whom he met, and the visit brought results: in 1876 Fourah Bay was affiliated with Durham University. By 1880 the Anglican Church of Sierra Leone had become a &#145;native pastorate&#146; whose only European clergyman was the bishop.<br>
<br>In 1874 the CMS moved Johnson to Lagos to take charge of St Paul's Breadfruit Church, patronized by the city's educated African &eacute;lite. In 1876 he was appointed superintendent of the mission stations in Yorubaland, after discussion of his being made a &#145;native bishop&#146;. Despite his missionary successes, especially in Abeokuta, his anti-slavery stance and opposition to polygyny provoked opposition from European missionaries and some of his converts, and he was removed in 1880, returning to the Breadfruit Church. From that time Johnson was increasingly seen by west African Anglicans as a &#145;bishop in waiting&#146;, second only to Bishop Crowther. In 1886 the governor of Lagos, Alfred Moloney, nominated him as one of the two African members of the legislative council. There he displayed independence, supporting the government on taxation of Africans, bitterly opposed by the educated class, while pressing government to increase opportunities for African civil servants and introduce the elective principle. Later Johnson became increasingly critical of Gilbert Carter, who replaced Moloney as governor of Lagos in 1891. His attacks on Carter's role in the war with Ijebu of 1892 led to Johnson's removal from the legislative council in 1894.<br>
<br>In 1887 the CMS again invited Johnson to England, where he presented a scheme for four west African dioceses, each under an African suffragan bishop. In the same year young Europeans entered the Niger mission, unearthed a number of scandals among the African clergy, and by 1890 were &#145;purging&#146; African clergy and shunting Bishop Crowther's authority aside. In response Johnson spearheaded the African opposition which in April 1892 resulted in the separation of the Niger delta churches. In September they requested the archbishop of Canterbury to consecrate Johnson as their bishop. The CMS responded by offering to make Johnson an assistant bishop, an offer he rejected as that of being a &#145;half-bishop&#146;.<br>
<br>A youthful romance having been cut short by his loved one's early death, Johnson remained single until April 1895, when he married Sabina A. Leigh (<i>d</i>. 1901), the daughter of J. S. Leigh, a prosperous Sierra Leonean trader in Abeokuta, Nigeria. In the following years he wrote <span class="italic">Yoruba Heathenism</span>, published in London and Exeter in 1899, a work which displays a distinct mellowing of his views on &#145;paganism&#146;, hitherto generally condemned by both Christian and Muslim missionaries as akin to devil worship. Rather, he approached Yoruba religion as a system of theology, forged by a people groping towards religious truth without benefit of Christ's revelation. The work remains a useful source for students of Yoruba culture.<br>
<br>The delta churches were reunited with the CMS in 1898. In a volte-face, Johnson in 1900 finally agreed to serve the delta pastorate as assistant bishop of Western Equatorial Africa, remaining for the rest of his life a loyal Anglican, a successful missionary, and an honest and effective administrator. He died in harness, of heart failure, on 18 May 1917, at Bonny CMS church, Nigeria, where he was buried.<br>
