<span class="headword">Fiennes,  Celia</span>  (1662&#150;1741), <span class="occ">traveller</span>, was born on 7 June 1662 in Newton Toney, near Salisbury, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9413/', "Colonel Nathaniel Fiennes (1607/8&#150;1669)")</script>, second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9415/', "William Fiennes, first Viscount Saye and Sele")</script>, and his second wife, Frances (1621&#150;1691), daughter of Colonel Richard Whitehead of West Tytherley, Hampshire. Her family were prominent and staunch parliamentarians and, after the Restoration, noted dissenters. Celia had two half-brothers from her father's first marriage, Nathaniel (<i>c</i>.1637&#150;<i>c</i>.1672) and William (1639&#150;1698), the third viscount, and four sisters (three of whom died in infancy) by the second marriage. Her younger sister, Mary (1663&#150;1737), married Sir Edmund Harrison, a London merchant who traded with Turkey. After the death of her mother in 1691 Celia moved to London to live either with or near her sister's family.<br>
<br>Celia Fiennes began to travel in order &#145;to regain my health by variety and change of aire and exercise&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journeys</span>, 1). Her early journeys were to various southern counties, Bath, London, and Oxford. In 1697 she made a tour of the north and of Kent and in the following year she made her &#145;Great Journey to Newcastle and to Cornwall&#146;. During the first decade of the eighteenth century she made further journeys through some of the southern counties and about 1712 she visited Epsom, Hampton Court, and Windsor. On some journeys she was accompanied by relatives but on her &#145;Great Journey&#146; in 1698 she travelled on horseback with only one or two servants, staying at inns or at private houses where she had family connections.<br>
<br>The discovery of England by firsthand exploration was becoming fashionable, though Fiennes was exceptional as a woman traveller, and travel was becoming easier: an act of parliament of 1697 allowed JPs to order the erection of guide stoops in places where the traveller might go astray. Fiennes's comments on these new stoops in Lancashire provide some of the earliest information on this innovation:<blockquote>at all cross wayes there are Posts and Hands pointing to each road with the names of the great town or market towns that it leads to, which does make up for the length of the miles that strangers may not lose their road and have to goe back againe. (<span class="italic">Journeys</span>, 188&#150;9)</blockquote>Celia Fiennes urged others to &#145;spend some of their tyme in Journeys to visit their native Land, and be curious to inform themselves and make observations of the pleasant prospects, good buildings, different produces and manufactures of each place&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journeys</span>, 1). Like Defoe, she did not share the current enthusiasm for antiquarianism. Neither was she particularly interested in the natural world, except where, for example in mining districts, natural resources promised a commercial return. From a family of political and religious nonconformists and with firsthand knowledge of the concerns of urban merchants and tradesmen, she delighted in the new, the busy, the commercial, the prosperous, and had little time for antiquities, decaying towns, ancient customs and privileges, or unchanging rural ways. She preferred Nottingham to York, new country seats to ancient houses, and contemporary manufacturing, mining, and drainage projects to ruins. She was a keen observer of country houses but knew little of art and described their contents as curiosities and was interested in their domestic arrangements. The gardens and rooms at Chatsworth, for instance, were viewed as a series of curiosities:<blockquote>at the end of the dineing roome is a large door all of Looking-glass, its great panells all diamond cutt, this is just opposite to the doores that runs into the drawing roome and bed chamber and closet, so it shews the roomes to look all double. (ibid., 99)</blockquote>Celia Fiennes was a connoisseur of spa waters; indeed, her descriptions of wells and the primitive accommodation that was provided are an important source of information about the early history of spas. At Harrogate, for example, she visited &#145;the Sulpher or Stincking spaw, not improperly term'd for the Smell being so very strong and offensive that I could not force my horse near the Well &hellip; it has an additionall offencivness like carrion or a jakes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journeys</span>, 80). She found that the drink was &#145;a quick purger and very good for all Scurbutick humours&#146;  (ibid., 80).<br>
<br>Celia Fiennes died, unmarried, on 10 April 1741 in Hackney, probably in the home of one of her nieces, and was buried in Newton Toney.<br>
<br>In 1702 Celia Fiennes reworked the notes she had taken during her travels into a journal. She made the standard disclaimer that she intended the work only for near relatives to read, but its style and presentation suggest that she always intended it for a larger audience. It remained wholly in manuscript until 1812 when Southey published unacknowledged excerpts in his <span class="italic">Omniana</span> and at the end of the century it was transcribed and edited for publication by a family member, Emily Griffiths, appearing as <span class="italic">Through England on a Side Saddle</span> (1888). The edition of 1947 with scholarly apparatus by Christopher Morris remains the standard. The sharpness of her observations on contemporary life, particularly its novel aspects, has made her journal a prime source for social and economic historians, ranking with that of her contemporary Daniel Defoe, and her sprightly and engaging style has won her an audience beyond the scholarly world.<br>
