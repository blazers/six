<span class="headword">Pococke,  Richard</span>  (1704&#150;1765), <span class="occ">traveller and Church of Ireland bishop of Ossory, of Elphin, and of Meath</span>, was born at Southampton, the son of Richard Pococke LLB (1660&#150;1710). His grandfather, also Richard Pococke LLB, was rector of Colemore, Hampshire, from November 1662 (or possibly from 1660) to his death in 1719. His father was headmaster of the King Edward VI Free Grammar School, and curate under sequestration of All Saints' Church in Southampton. His mother was Elizabeth, only daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18749/', "Revd Isaac Milles")</script>, rector of Highclere, Hampshire. He was perhaps the Richard, son of parents Richard and Elizabeth, baptized on 24 December 1704 at St Sepulchre, London. Pococke's father died when he was six and he and his mother lived for the following ten years with his maternal grandfather, at whose school at Highclere rectory he was educated. In 1720 his grandfather died and he and his mother moved to Newtown near Newbury, Berkshire. Pococke matriculated from Corpus Christi College, Oxford, on 13 July 1720 and graduated BA in 1725, BCL in 1731, and DCL in 1733.<br>
<br>Pococke's family connections in the church and his ability to get on with patrons ensured his steady promotion through the church hierarchy. As early as 1725 he was appointed precentor of Lismore Cathedral by his uncle Thomas Milles, bishop of Waterford and Lismore, of whose dioceses Pococke became vicar-general in 1734. It was, however, travel rather than church affairs where Pococke made his mark, his clerical duties leaving him ample time to indulge his enjoyment of discovery. He began his travels with a series of tours to Europe between 1733 and 1736; these he made with his cousin Jeremiah Milles, also a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Thomas Milles and like Pococke a clergyman and an antiquary. After their travels the two men continued to correspond and later published joint antiquarian works. On their tours they went beyond the normal confines of the grand tour to visit places such as Prussia, Hanover, and Greece.<br>
<br>Pococke's next and most ambitious journey, from 1737 to 1740, was to the Near East, then virtually unknown to western travellers. On 29 September 1737 he reached Alexandria, and went to Rosetta, where he visited Cosmas, the Greek patriarch. In December he left for Upper Egypt and on 9 January 1738 reached Dendereh. He visited Thebes but did not go up the Nile beyond Philae. In the Nile valley he briefly met the Danish artist Frederik Ludvig Norden. Pococke reached Cairo in February 1738. He next visited Jerusalem, and bathed in the Dead Sea to test a statement of Pliny's about the specific gravity of the water. He travelled in northern Palestine, and explored Balbec. He also visited Cyprus, Crete, where he climbed Mount Ida, parts of Asia Minor, and Greece. He made a thorough survey of the coast of the Troad on horseback in 1740 and made a good guess at the location of Troy (Hissarlik).<br>
<br>After leaving Cephalonia, Pococke made an extensive tour of Europe. He landed at Messina in November 1740. He visited Naples and twice climbed Vesuvius. He travelled through Germany and on 19 June 1741 with an armed party explored the Mer de Glace in the valley of Chamonix. The Savoy Alps at this time were neither frequently visited nor safe and it was typical of the indomitable Pococke that he reached the Mer de Glace. As the travellers stood on the ice they drank the health of Admiral Edward Vernon to celebrate his recent victory at Porto Bello in the West Indies. This event (described by P. Martel in <span class="italic">An Account of the Glaciers or Ice Alps in Savoy</span>, 1744) together with his ascents of Mount Ida and Vesuvius cemented his reputation as a pioneer of mountaineering.<br>
<br>Pococke returned to England in 1742 and his <span class="italic">Description of the East</span> appeared in two volumes in 1743 and 1745. The second volume was dedicated to Philip Dormer Stanhope, fourth earl of Chesterfield, then lord lieutenant of Ireland, to whom Pococke was domestic chaplain. The work was acclaimed at the time, and Gibbon in the <span class="italic">Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</span> described it as of &#145;superior learning and dignity&#146;  (ch. 51, n. 69) though he objected that its author too often confounded what he had seen with what he had heard. Pococke did take some licence in his observations, perhaps most famously in his depiction of the sphinx which he shows with a nose that had been missing for some hundreds of years by the time of his observation. None the less the quality and particularly the earliness of his observations and their record in prose, maps, and diagrams make him one of the most important near eastern travellers, ranking with Frederik Ludvig Norden and Carsten Niebuhr, in stimulating an Egyptian revival in European art and architecture, and recording much that has subsequently been lost.<br>
<br>In 1744 Pococke was made precentor of Waterford, and in 1745 the dedicatee of volume 2 of his <span class="italic">Description of the East</span>, Lord Chesterfield, gave him the archdeaconry of Dublin. In 1756 he was appointed to the bishopric of Ossory by Chesterfield's successor, the duke of Devonshire. This appointment increased his income significantly and he began the restoration of the cathedral church of St Canice, then still in a ruinous state after damage inflicted by Cromwell's men. With Sanderson Miller commissioned to design the works, Pococke energetically supervised them. He also undertook other building works to churches throughout his diocese and supported charitable works in the city. In June 1765 Pococke was translated from Ossory to Elphin and in the following month was translated again, to the bishopric of Meath.<br>
<br>At various periods of his life Pococke made tours of England, Scotland, and Ireland, carefully noting what he saw. His manuscripts were printed only in the latter years of the nineteenth century (Scotland by the Scottish Historical Society in 1887 and England by the Camden Society in 1888). A full account of his Irish journeys appeared only in 1995. The publication and scholarly editing of all of these tours reveal that Pococke was not only a pioneer mountaineer and one of the earliest scholarly explorers in Egypt, but was also among the very earliest systematic explorers of the remoter parts of Britain and Ireland. His English and Welsh tours were made chiefly from 1750 to 1757. His Irish tours were in 1749 and 1752, and his Scottish tours were in 1747, 1750, and 1760. He visited many remote parts of Ireland and reached as far north as the Orkney Islands in Scotland. He travelled on horseback, with two servants and a packhorse following at a respectful distance behind him. He carried with him maps and topographical accounts which he compared, often unfavourably, with the reality he saw. What makes his tours so interesting is that he explored areas very rarely visited and made detailed observations of the people he met and the archaeology, botany, geology, and antiquities that he saw. He was often able to describe these features with scholarly knowledge. His style is terse and plain, not least because some parts of his journal were not polished for publication, but he is evidently genuinely interested in what he sees and&#151;by comparison with other commentators, particularly those on Ireland&#151;does not fall into stereotyping.<br>
<br>Pococke was, like many of his contemporaries, interested in &#145;improvement&#146;, which he thought would convey both economic and moral benefits to the nation. In his tours of Britain and Ireland he showed great interest in trade, manufacture, and farming, and from 1750 was a member of the Dublin Society for Promoting Husbandry and Other Useful Arts in Ireland. While he was bishop of Ossory he founded a linen-weaving school at Lintown. By his will (proved in the prerogative court of Armagh in 1766) Pococke left his property in trust to the Incorporated Society for Promoting English Protestant Schools in Ireland for the purpose of endowing his weaving school at Lintown &#145;for Papist boys who shall be from 12 to 16 years old &hellip; said boys to be bred to the Protestant Religion, and to be apprenticed to the Society for seven years&#146;. The school, like many other similar institutions in Ireland, failed to prosper, however, and in 1839 closed as a manufactory and became a school for protestant boys under the name Pococke College (also school or institution). In 1903 this too closed, and since then Pococke's endowment has been used to support Kilkenny College.<br>
<br>Pococke, who never married, died unexpectedly of apoplexy on 25 September 1765 at Charleville near Tullamore, Ireland, while on a visitation. He was buried in Bishop Montgomery's tomb at Ardbraccan, seat of the bishop of Meath.<br>
<br>Pococke was a member of several learned societies including the first Egyptian Society, founded 1741 (he was its secretary in 1742&#150;3), the Physico-Historical Society of Dublin, from 1744, and the Spalding Society, a very early antiquarian society. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 11 February 1741, and contributed several papers to its <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>, notably on the Giant's Causeway (1748 and 1753).<br>
<br>Pococke's collection of Greek, Roman, and English coins and medals was sold in London at auction by Langford on 27&#150;8 May 1766. His collection of antiquities and his minerals and fossils were sold by Langford on 5&#150;6 June 1766. Pococke left his manuscripts to the British Museum, although some were not handed over immediately after his death and were bought by the British Museum in 1843 and 1859.<br>
<br>Pococke was described by Mrs Delany as &#145;the <i>dullest man</i> that <i>ever travelled</i>: but he is a <i>good man</i>&#146;  (letter of 2 Jan 1761, quoted in Quane, 41). Richard Cumberland said of him: &#145;having given the world a full detail of his researches in Egypt, he seemed to hold himself excused from saying anything more about it&#146; and accused him of &#145;obdurate taciturnity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, quoted in Quane, 41). Others, however, found him a pleasant enough companion and he was evidently able to get on with both his influential relations and patrons and the common people he met on the road. Pococke was one of the foremost travellers of his day and, though it has taken some 150 years for all the records of his journeys to be published, his accounts are a valuable and in many cases unique record of the areas he visited.<br>
