<span class="headword">Larkham,  Thomas</span>  (1602&#150;1669), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was born on 17 August 1602 at Lyme Regis in Dorset, the eldest son of Thomas Larkham, linen draper (<i>d</i>. 1639), and his wife, Jane. He matriculated from Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1619 and graduated BA from Trinity Hall in 1622. On 22 June that year at Shobrooke, Devon, he married Patience (<i>d</i>. 1677), daughter of George Wilton, schoolmaster, of Crediton. Through his wife Larkham came into property and income which helped to support his unconventional career. Ordained priest in London on 23 May 1624, he became curate at Sandford, Devon, where his son John was baptized on 10 October that year. He proceeded MA in 1626 and on 26 December became vicar of Northam, Devon. He later claimed, in the dedication to his <span class="italic">The Wedding Supper</span> (1652), that he endured &#145;suffering (in the time of the prelacy) in almost all the courts in England&#146;, including high commission and Star Chamber. No evidence survives to substantiate this. He left for New England in late 1639 or early 1640, and was deprived in August 1640 for neglect by absence.<br>
<br>Larkham settled with his family at Dover (Paschataqua), New Hampshire, where Hanserd Knollys (1598&#150;1691) had gathered a church. The inhabitants turned to Larkham because he was laxer about church membership, a reputation at odds with his later notoriety as a congregationalist. In 1641 Larkham opposed Knollys's antinomian preaching: Knollys excommunicated him, and his faction marched towards Larkham's house with a bible on a pole. Knollys soon left Dover. Larkham promised to stay, but in November 1642 suddenly left for England. John Winthrop noted sourly in his journal that Larkham deserted his church, and that a widow later confessed she was carrying his child (rumours of this followed him home)  (<span class="italic">Journal of John Winthrop</span>, 421). In his diary, begun about 1648, Larkham noted with pleasure for many years the anniversary of setting sail from New England.<br>
<br>On his return Larkham went to Kent, then became a parliamentary chaplain. In 1645 the committee for plundered ministers supported his right to preach in the parish of East Greenwich. Thomas Edwards in his <span class="italic">Gangraena</span> (1646) branded him a fierce Independent. In February 1647 Larkham went to Ireland as chaplain to Sir Hardress Waller's regiment.<br>
<br>Larkham went to the west country with Waller at the start of the second civil war, and to Tavistock in April 1648. He preached publicly in the town, which had lost its vicar in 1643 when George Hughes (<i>d</i>. 1677) left for Plymouth. The patron, the earl of Bedford, had agreed to let the inhabitants select the incumbent. Larkham claimed he was the parishioners' choice. He left the army after a court martial for inciting disorder, his opponents alleged, though Larkham referred only to disagreements over soldiers' irreligious behaviour. It is not clear whether he gathered a church in the parish immediately, but he quickly caused offence by excluding from communion those he judged ungodly. He alienated trustees of the Lamerton tithe, who withheld a &pound;50 augmentation due to the vicar of Tavistock: Larkham's diary records his dismay. In protest, he went north in August 1651. He joined his son George (1629/30&#150;1700), who had graduated BA from Exeter College, Oxford, the previous year and gone to Cumberland earlier that year. Both were attracted by calls for preachers from the commissioners for the four northern counties.<br>
<br>Larkham preached in itinerant fashion near Cockermouth, Cumberland, at Cross Canonby, Dearham, and Flimby, and may have been attached to troops in the area. During the autumn he instigated a gathered church at Cockermouth, its members drawn from parishes in the neighbourhood. He held no formal office, but the church book shows he played a critical role. George Larkham, who had been ordained by his father and others on 28 January 1652, became curate of Cockermouth and pastor to the church. In both Tavistock and Cockermouth, father and son combined parish livings with ministry to gathered churches&#151;an unusual style of ministry, though possible in the interregnum.<br>
<br>Larkham stayed in Cumberland until April 1652, but set off for Tavistock in response to pleas from supporters. Anticipating more controversy, he went to London to secure support from the committee for advance of money in the Lamerton dispute, and to print his <span class="italic">The Wedding Supper</span> (issued in a new edition in 1656) to defend his ministry. When he reached Tavistock his enemies locked the parish church to keep him out. If Larkham had not formally gathered a church before, he soon did so. He distinguished between duties to parish and church: as he revealed in his <span class="italic">A Discourse of Paying Tithes</span> (1656), &#145;I teach all in the publike meeting-house, but do only baptize the children of such as are received and allowed members of the Church, and admitted to the Lords Table&#146;  (Larkham, <span class="italic">Discourse</span>, 25). His <span class="italic">The Attributes of God Unfolded, and Applied</span> (1656) reveals an active preaching ministry, but parish records suggest half those born between 1653 and 1660 went unbaptized. What perhaps began as an attempt to refuse sacraments to the ignorant or immoral became a church defined ever more tightly, by written covenant and pastoral inquiry. By 1658 the gathered church paid Larkham to use a meeting-chamber in his house, and allied itself with Lewis Stucley's congregationalist church in Exeter. Larkham's opponents tried to persuade the authorities to remove him: those with a stake in the Lamerton dispute, such as Walter Godbeare, John Pointer, and Francis Glanville, were to the fore, with disenchanted church members like Nicholas Watts and William Hore, and ministers excluded by Larkham from Tavistock's pulpit, such as Digory Polewhele of Whitchurch and Andrew Gove of Peter Tavy. When appeals to the Devon commissioners for sequestrations, the commission for plundered ministers, and the commission for the ejection of scandalous ministers came to nothing, Glanville, Polewhele, Godbeare, Watts, and Hore produced <span class="italic">The Tavistock Naboth Proved Nabal</span> (1658), the only tract now extant from a fierce exchange of pamphlets between Larkham and his critics. Their campaign, constructed to fit the expectations of interregnum religious policy, focused on Larkham's unfit conduct as a public preacher, not on his right to gather a church. They glossed his experiments in church discipline as a way to exclude those who had preferred George Hughes's ministry, &#145;for &hellip; he hath often said there were two parties in the Church, the Hugonites and the Larkamites&#146;  (F. G. and others, 67). The existence of this rift is confirmed by Watts's connections with Hughes's ministerial circle (which helped Watts to establish a rival lecture-day in Tavistock in 1659), and by Larkham's isolation from the Devon association formed by Hughes. However, the vehemence of <span class="italic">The Tavistock Naboth</span>'s polemic should not obscure the poor success of the crusade to evict Larkham. Nor should evidence of local support be overlooked: his diary lists those to whom he gave or sold his printed sermons, and notes a stream of gifts from almost eighty donors, many among the town's poorer citizens. Family names that recur in the diary before and after 1660 give a sense of the loyalty to Larkham that carried Tavistock's gathered church into nonconformity.<br>
<br>On 21 October 1660 Larkham resigned as vicar at the patron's request, but stayed in or near Tavistock, preaching when he could. He fled to Cumberland for six months in 1663&#150;4 to escape charges of nonconformity, but he was excommunicated in 1665. He drew up his will, as of Tavistock, on 1 June 1668, mentioning his wife, son George, daughters Patience and Jane, and grandson Thomas. He died in 1669 and was buried on 23 December in Tavistock.<br>
