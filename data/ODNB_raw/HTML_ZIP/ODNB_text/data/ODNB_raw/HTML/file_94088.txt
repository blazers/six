<span class="headword">Wolstenholme, Sir  Gordon Ethelbert Ward</span>  (1913&#150;2004), <span class="occ">physician, charity director, and promoter of public health care</span>, was born on 28 May 1913 at 22 Tapton Crescent Road, Ecclesall, Sheffield, the first son and third of five children of George Ethelbert Wolstenholme (1875&#150;1940), chemical engineer and industrialist, and his wife, Clementina (1880&#150;1955), daughter of Herbert Ward, forge master and steelmaker. Among his ancestors was Sir John Wolstenholme (1562&#150;1639), who had been an incorporator of the East India Company, a patron of exploration by Henry Hudson and William Baffin, and an owner of Nostell Priory. Quebec's Cape Wolstenholme commemorates his association with Hudson. Ancestors on his mother's side included distinguished Sheffield forge masters, steelmakers, and master cutlers, and the founders of Thomas W. Ward Industries. Extending this tradition, Wolstenholme's father achieved prominence nationally and internationally in the pioneering promotion of stainless steel, which he claimed to have named.<br>
<br>Educated at Repton School and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, Wolstenholme initially prepared for a career in the diplomatic service, spending a year between school and university in Vienna (1931&#150;2) advancing his German in preparation. However, re-evaluation of his ambitions following a first year at Cambridge drew him into medicine. Following medical studies at Cambridge (1933&#150;6) and clinical training at London's Middlesex Hospital he qualified in 1939. On 1 June that year he married Mary Elizabeth Spackman (1915&#150;1985), the daughter of the Revd Hubert Middleton Spackman. They had a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War Wolstenholme joined the Royal Army Medical Corps. Service with the Cheshire regiment took him to France, but, adrift of the Cheshires in the confusion and carnage of the last days of May 1940, he was caught up in assisting a casualty-deluged field hospital, where his innovative attention to blood transfusion was noted by his superiors. Soon after his return to England the army blood transfusion service commandeered his services, drawing him into the war-pressurized pioneering of military and civilian blood transfusion services. In 1941&#150;2 he masterminded and commanded blood transfusion services for north-western England and industrial Scotland. His success led to his appointment as officer commanding a new blood transfusion unit that was to support allied troops through the Sicilian and Italian campaigns of 1943 and 1944. For his expeditious and ingenious adaptations of the services of this small unit to the ever changing demands of these campaigns, and his strategic distribution of the first supplies of scarce penicillin within the central Mediterranean theatre of war, he was awarded a military OBE in 1944. With the rank of lieutenant-colonel he took charge of large general hospitals at Trieste and Udine at the conclusion of the Italian campaign.<br>
<br>Wolstenholme remained in the medical corps until 1947, when he returned to house jobs at the Middlesex Hospital and the post-war challenges of advancing his clinical career on overcrowded promotion ladders. He intended to specialize in haematology, but as a registrar found himself shunted into dermatology. His first marriage had not survived the passion of wartime links with Du&#353;anka (Dushanka) Nedi&#263;, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Messinger (1912&#150;2006), a young Belgrade doctor of Hungarian origin serving the Yugoslav partisans. The daughter of Arthur Messinger, civil engineer, and estranged wife of Sava Nedi&#263;, she had attended one of the short courses in resuscitation and trauma care Wolstenholme had developed for doctors of allied forces. Dushanka, whom he married in London on 20 August 1948, and with whom he had two daughters, became a critical pacemaker of the rest of his life, her irrepressible vitality helping propel his career and direct it away from the blocked post-war channels of clinical medicine.<br>
<br>Influenced by Dushanka, Wolstenholme chose to move into a medically related administrative role and in 1949 secured the executive directorship of the newly formed Ciba Foundation in London, a philanthropic and independent creation of the Swiss chemical company CIBA, intended to foster international collaboration among scientists, particularly across chemistry and the life sciences. The role was a risky sidestep into shaping a new and exploratory enterprise, but to this Wolstenholme brought the shrewd administrative skills and innovative commitment that had distinguished his wartime blood transfusion service. Over the next three decades, from 1949 to 1978, he established the Ciba Foundation as a leading promoter of international dialogue in scientific research, mainly through a successful style of symposium he evolved in the 1950s and his effectiveness in persuading eminent scientific visionaries to participate.<br>
<br>Wolstenholme's symposia were finely prepared, intimate, international, two to three-day house-party style events, each involving approximately twenty-five leading scientists carefully selected and briefed to provide interdisciplinary interaction and perspective on a particularly opportune aspect of life science or clinical research. Initially, in the 1950s, he perceptively gave priority to pressing issues of endocrinology and the regulation of cell metabolism in his symposia, pursuing their revolutionary benefits to clinical medicine. In his thirty years at the helm of the Ciba Foundation he masterminded more than 200 symposia of high relevance to biological science and clinical medicine, each yielding a detailed report for dissemination. Most were held in the gracious comfort of the home of the Ciba Foundation at 41 Portland Place, London, where Gordon and Dushanka Wolstenholme also became legendary providers of open-house hospitality to members of the international scientific community. The American biochemist Abraham White described a Wolstenholme symposium as a twentieth-century version of a caravanserai, a gathering of travellers at an oasis where from dawn to dusk the time is spent matching ideas and intellects and trading viewpoints.<br>
<br>Wolstenholme blended his Ciba Foundation commitments with prolific charitable service to other agencies dedicated to scientific and clinical advances, including the Renal Association of Great Britain, the Society for the Study of Fertility, the Arthritis Research Campaign, the National Kidney Research Fund, the Society for Social Medicine, the European Biological Foundation, and the International Society for Endocrinology, all of which he helped establish. He also gave long and distinguished service to the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries, of which he was master in 1979&#150;80, the Zoological Society of London, the Nuffield Institute for Comparative Medicine, the Royal Society of Medicine, of which he became president in 1975&#150;7, and the Royal College of Physicians, of which he was Harveian librarian from 1979 to 1989, following his retirement from the Ciba Foundation. (In this latter role he edited volumes 6&#150;8 of the college's <span class="italic">Munk's Roll</span>.) Among numerous honours he became a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1959 and a recipient of the star of Ethiopia in 1966. He was knighted in 1976.<br>
<br>Facilitating advances in health care became the guiding principal of Wolstenholme's long career, which included advisory contributions to health care in Ethiopia (1963&#150;74) and Venezuela (1969&#150;78), and ultimately the establishment in 1988 of an international charity, Action in International Medicine (AIM), to promote better primary care globally. His greatest regret was in the failure of this organization to thrive through lack of financial support; it folded in 2001. Wolstenholme lived latterly at La Villiaze Lodge, rue de la Villiaze, Forest, Guernsey. He died on 29 May 2004 and was survived by his wife, Dushanka, and his five children.<br>
