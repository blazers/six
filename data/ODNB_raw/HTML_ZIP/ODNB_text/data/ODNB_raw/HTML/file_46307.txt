<span class="headword">Hoare,  Angelina Margaret</span>  (1843&#150;1892), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born on 17 May 1843 at 13 New Street, Spring Gardens, London, the sixth of the twelve children of Henry Hoare (<i>d</i>. 1866), banker, and his wife, Lady Mary <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marsham (1811&#150;1871), third daughter of the second earl of Romney. Her parents were active members of the Church of England, and her father campaigned vigorously for the revival of convocation. She was educated at home, but as a young woman she developed a weak heart; nevertheless she led an active life, and was strongly attracted to missionary work.<br>
<br>Angelina's brother Walter Hoare became curate to Robert Milman at Great Marlow, Buckinghamshire; Milman became bishop of Calcutta in 1867 and in 1874 his sister Maria invited Henry Hoare's daughters to Calcutta to help in the zenana missions for Indian women. Angelina Hoare arrived in Calcutta in January 1876. Within weeks Milman died, but his successor was supportive. Hoare soon realized that schools were more effective as specifically missionary agencies than the zenana houses, which were closely supervised by husbands who objected to the Christian teaching being given to their wives. In 1878 she started village schools south of Calcutta in the extensive rice-growing area called the Sunderbunds. There were no roads and the only means of communication was by flat-bottomed boats. About thirty schools were established, funded by money raised in England principally among Angelina Hoare's banking family connections. In 1882 she bought a large house in Calcutta with 9 acres of land, to serve as her mission house, and began a number of schools for Indians, some of whom became teachers in the Sunderbunds. Hoare adopted Indian dress and learnt Bengali: in return she won widespread admiration and support.<br>
<br>Failing health hastened Hoare's decision to retire from the mission house, and the sisters from the community of St John Baptist, at Clewer, who had been working in Calcutta, were invited to run the mission house while she agreed to retain the schools. Soon after returning from a visit to England she became ill and died from a brain haemorrhage, on 10 January 1892. She was buried in the English cemetery in Calcutta and a memorial was placed in the cathedral. Following her death the Clewer sisters also took over the village schools.<br>
