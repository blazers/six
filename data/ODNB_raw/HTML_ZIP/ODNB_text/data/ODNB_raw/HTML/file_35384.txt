<span class="headword">Parker, Sir  (Horatio) Gilbert George</span>, baronet  (1860&#150;1932), <span class="occ">novelist and politician</span>, was born on 23 November 1860 at Camden East, Addington, Ontario, Canada, the fourth surviving child and eldest son of Joseph Parker (1807&#150;1900), former soldier, justice of the peace, militiaman, and shopkeeper, and his second wife, Samantha Jane (1834?&#150;1908), daughter of George and Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Gardineer) Simmons, a family of United Empire loyalist extraction. His father emigrated to Canada from Ireland about 1834 and pursued a variety of occupations before settling as a shopkeeper. Parker attended various schools, including one in Frankford when the family moved there in 1877. He spent six weeks at Belleville model school training as a teacher and started his teaching career at Marsh Hill, near Frankford, where he stayed for three years until 1880. He continued his teacher training at Ottawa normal school from late 1880 to early 1881. He then taught at Bayside School before teaching at the Ontario Institute for the Deaf at Belleville in January 1882. In April 1881 he was ordained an Anglican deacon and a curate at St George's Church, Trenton. In 1883 Parker began a divinity course at Trinity College, Toronto, where he was also professor of elocution. In 1884 he became lecturer in elocution at Queen's College, Kingston, and he finally abandoned any thoughts of the ministry. Early in 1886 Parker left on a trip to Australia where he joined the staff of the <span class="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</span>, eventually becoming associate editor. While in Australia, Parker began his literary career by publishing stories and articles in the newspapers and he wrote the plays <span class="italic">Faust</span> (1888) and <span class="italic">The Vendetta</span> (1889), both of which were failures.<br>
<br>Parker left Australia in 1889 and settled in Britain as his home for the rest of his life. He contributed to some of the major journals and papers and began his stories of the Canadian north. His first book, <span class="italic">Pierre and his People: Tales of the Far North</span> (1892), was well received in Britain but not in Canada, where it was felt that it lacked realism, a criticism that was applied to many of his later works. Throughout the 1890s he was a prolific writer in both article and novel form. He published his first full-length novel, <span class="italic">The Chief Factor</span>, in 1892 and then followed with his first modern novel, <span class="italic">Mrs Falchion</span> (1893), which received mixed reviews, and <span class="italic">The Trespasser</span> (1893). The year 1894 saw his first historical romance, <span class="italic">The Trail of the Sword</span>, his only novel to be translated into French. His greatest success was <span class="italic">The Seats of the Mighty</span> (1896), a story based on the British capture of Quebec, which Beerbohm Tree persuaded him to adapt for the stage, though without much success.<br>
<br>On 5 December 1895 Parker married Amy Eliza Vantine (<i>d</i>. 1925), a wealthy young New York heiress, and they settled into a fairly hectic social life where he endeavoured to seek influence both literary and political. Parker's love for Canada and his belief in the imperial destiny led him to have political ambitions both in Canada and Britain, and in 1900 he was elected Conservative MP for Gravesend, a seat he held until ill health forced him to resign in 1918.<br>
<br>After a stay in the Channel Islands, Parker wrote <span class="italic">The Battle of the Strong</span> (1898), a story of the French Revolution, and this was followed by <span class="italic">The Right of Way</span> (1901), a psychological study of mental illness and marital disharmony which became a best-seller in the USA. Despite his parliamentary work, he still managed to write both fiction and non-fiction, and in 1902 he published <span class="italic">Donovan Pasha</span>, a story set in Egypt. He used his vast experience of travels abroad in his novels and this is a mark of his style and art. However, a criticism often made was that his characters were too extreme in their make-up and actions to be believable. Despite this, Parker was recognized as a major Canadian writer with the award of a knighthood in 1902. His literary position was recognized in 1912 with the start of the publication of the <span class="roman">Imperial</span> edition of his works, a rare honour for a living novelist.<br>
<br>Parker's staunch support of the empire led him to organize the first colonial universities' conference in 1903 and in the following year he became chairman of the Imperial South African Association. In parliament he promoted colonial interests, a concern reflected in his novels and contributions to periodicals. His ambitions for high political office were slow to be fulfilled (he failed to become high commissioner for Canada) until the First World War provided an opening for his talents. From November 1914 to late 1916 he was in charge of British propaganda in the USA and he &#145;built up an organisation of 13,000 influential people in the USA who were distributing British propaganda&#146;  (Buitenhuis, 17&#150;18). He published <span class="italic">The World in a Crucible: an Account of the Origins and Conduct of the Great War</span> in 1915, and in the same year was rewarded for his political and war work with a baronetcy and the following year was sworn of the privy council. His contribution to the war effort was recognized with the offer of an earldom in 1921, but it was refused as being too late to be of value  (Adams, 186). His wife died in 1925 and Parker never recovered from the loss. His novels no longer satisfied the public, though sixteen of them were filmed.<br>
<br>Photographs show Parker as of medium height, bearded, and with rather intense eyes. He was somewhat of a dandy in his dress. He died of a heart attack on 6 September 1932 at his home, 2 Whitehall Court, Westminster, London, and was buried in Belleville, Ontario, on 27 September; his title became extinct.<br>
