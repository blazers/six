<span class="headword">Venn,  Anne</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1627, <em>d.</em> 1654), <span class="occ">religious radical and diarist</span>, was baptized in London on 1 January 1627 at All Hallows, Bread Street, the only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28186/', "John Venn (bap. 1586, d. 1650)")</script>, a silk merchant trading from his shop on Bread Street but originally from Lydiard St Lawrence in Somerset, and his second wife, Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1594), daughter of Geoffrey Langley of Colchester, Essex, and widow of two Londoners, John Elliot and John Scarborough.<br>
<br>The Venns were a godly and relatively prosperous London family. Although still an adolescent, at the end of the 1630s Anne Venn was allowed to accompany her parents regularly to secret puritan religious meetings. At the meetings, the Venns made the close acquaintance of the zealous divine Christopher Love who, as chaplain to her father's regiment during the civil war, lived with the family at Windsor Castle, where they had moved in October 1642, and for a time became Anne's spiritual confidant. John Venn, her father, had become a leading parliamentarian activist and later became a regicide. Unknown to her parents, from the age of nine Anne began to be tortured by the fear that she might be damned and subsequently kept a careful written record, very much in the genre of the puritan diarist or autobiographer, of her excruciating mental turmoil over an eighteen-year period until she at last gained some comforting assurance of salvation. The handwritten work, which she kept a close secret, was discovered in her closet along with several other godly devotional writings after her death and was published in 1658, organized into three books by her stepfather Thomas Weld, an Independent divine, under the title <span class="italic">A Wise Virgin's Lamp Burning</span>.<br>
<br>The work reveals a clearly well-educated and intelligent woman who sought spiritual reassurance by reading puritan works and attending godly sermons. Personally austere, she would not wear jewellery or vain clothes. She was intensely introspective, probably lonely and depressive, and may not have enjoyed robust health. Yet she could also be self-assertive, if not stubborn, at times when pursuing her spiritual goals. Although remaining on good terms with most of the godly whose acquaintance she made, she and her parents eventually became dissatisfied with Christopher Love and the newly imposed presbyterian settlement. About 1645 the family returned to London, living in Whitecross Street. Anne submitted herself to the required vetting for the sacrament of communion by elders in Love's parish of St Anne, Aldersgate, London, but the experience was blighted by a lack of inner conviction that she was fit to partake of it. The Venns moved out of London to Kensington about 1647, but found the local preaching unsatisfactory and later attended the ministry elsewhere. The sudden and unexpected death of John Venn during the night of 27&#150;8 June 1650 was a great blow to Anne and her mother. By 1651 Anne had become totally disillusioned with presbyterianism and had fallen under the influence of the Independent divine and former chaplain to Sir Thomas Fairfax, Isaac Knight, the curate at Hammersmith in the chapelry of Fulham and later rector of Fulham. When Knight gathered an Independent church at Fulham in 1652, Anne and her mother joined the church and became active and enthusiastic members of it. At long last Anne was able to experience some spiritual peace.<br>
<br>Left a dowry of &pound;1000 in her father's will, Anne never married. She died in Kensington in late December 1654 after a severe cold, but characteristically she maintained her diary until on the verge of death. In her will, made on 19 November 1653 and proved on 26 January 1655, she left bequests totalling &pound;867. Among the beneficiaries were eight leading Independent divines, including Isaac Knight, and the poor of the gathered church at Fulham. She bequeathed her remaining goods, plate, jewels, household furnishing, and books to her mother, whom she appointed her executor.<br>
