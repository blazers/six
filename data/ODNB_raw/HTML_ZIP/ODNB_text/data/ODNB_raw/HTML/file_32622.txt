<span class="headword">Creagh, Sir  Garrett O'Moore</span>  (1848&#150;1923), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, the seventh son of Captain James Creagh RN and his wife, Grace Emily, daughter of Garrett O'Moore of Cloghan Castle, co. Kerry, was born at Cahirbane, co. Clare, in Ireland, on 2 April 1848. He was educated privately, at the Royal Naval School, New Cross, and finally at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He married twice: first, in 1874, Mary Letitia Longfield, daughter of John Brereton of Oldcourt, co. Tipperary, who died two years later; second, in 1891, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1945), daughter of Edward Reade of Kelverton, Buckinghamshire, with whom he had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Creagh was commissioned ensign in the 95th foot in October 1866 and went to join the regiment in India in 1869. In February 1870 he transferred to the Indian army, taking up an appointment on the Bombay staff corps as a lieutenant. He served briefly with the marine battalion, 25th Bombay light infantry, Deoli irregular force, and the Merwara battalion. He was promoted captain in 1878 and served during the Second Afghan War of 1879&#150;80. He was sent with 150 men to protect the village of Kam Dakka on 21 April 1879, where he was attacked by 1500 Mohmands. He retired to a position in a nearby cemetery where his men repulsed every enemy assault until they were relieved late in the afternoon. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions. The commander-in-chief in India, General Sir Frederick Haines, reported that but for Creagh's coolness and gallantry his detachment would probably have been destroyed. He was mentioned in dispatches, and promoted brevet major.<br>
<br>Between 1882 and 1886 Creagh commanded the Merwara battalion and in the latter year was promoted major. In 1890 he participated in the Zhob valley expedition on the north-west frontier of India. He assumed command of the 29th Bombay infantry later the same year and was promoted lieutenant-colonel in 1892. In 1896 he was promoted colonel and became assistant quartermaster-general at Bombay. Creagh was promoted brigadier-general in 1898 and appointed political resident and general officer in command at Aden. In 1900 he led the 2nd brigade during the China expedition, and in the following year became general officer commanding the British expeditionary force in China.<br>
<br>Creagh then commanded a first-class district in India. He was promoted major-general in 1902 and in the same year became a KCB. In 1904 he took over the command of the 5th division and was promoted lieutenant-general. In 1906 Creagh assumed command of the 2nd division, but the following year returned to England on special duty, and in July 1907 was appointed military secretary at the India Office. Creagh, promoted general in November 1907, remained at the India Office until 1909, when he was appointed to succeed Lord Kitchener as commander-in-chief in India. During his tenure of command Creagh did not introduce many new reforms, being primarily occupied defending changes made by his predecessor in the organization and deployment of the army in India as pressure for retrenchment in the military budget mounted following the 1907 Anglo-Russian convention. In 1911 he was appointed GCSI and was made aide-de-camp to George V. He retired in May 1914 and lived in London. He died at his residence, 65 Albert Hall Mansions, Kensington Gore, on 9 August 1923, and was buried in East Sheen cemetery two days later.<br>
