<span class="headword">Pye, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1585, <em>d.</em> 1662), <span class="occ">exchequer official and politician</span>, was baptized on 24 March 1585 at Much Dewchurch, Herefordshire, the fourth and youngest son of Roger Pye (<i>d</i>. 1591) of the Mynde (which lay in the parish) and his wife, Bridget (<i>d</i>. 1624), daughter of Thomas Kyrle of Walford, Herefordshire. Pye did not attend university but was admitted to the Middle Temple in June 1607.<br>
<br>At some date between 1615 and 1618, together with his eldest brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22924/', "Walter Pye")</script>, Robert joined the service of George Villiers (later first duke of Buckingham). In March 1617 he was granted the profit on the extra import duty levied on the goods of foreign merchants entering the country (a kind of revenue farm), in place of Sir Lionel Cranfield, who was moving on to higher things. Their paths were to cross and recross in the years ahead. In April 1618 Pye became co-grantee of a minor but potentially profitable office in chancery&#151;presumably granted by the lord chancellor, Sir Francis Bacon (later Viscount St Albans) to gratify Buckingham. But the decisive advance in Pye's prospects came with the disgrace and dismissal in 1619 of the lord treasurer, Thomas Howard, first earl of Suffolk, and his henchman Sir John Bingley. He succeeded the latter as auditor of the exchequer of receipt and writer of tallies. Successive holders of this post and of the clerkship of the pells, which had overlapping duties, had been at odds during the previous reign. Their relative importance was partly a matter of administrative procedures, but perhaps even more of the personality and political connections of their respective holders. In any case the auditorship was a lucrative office.<br>
<br>Pye was knighted in 1621. In the early 1620s he was able to acquire an estate at Faringdon in Berkshire, the manor house then comprising the castle. By then he had married Mary Croker, daughter of John Croker of Battisford, Gloucestershire; by 1623 they had a one-year-old son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22921/', "Robert Pye")</script>, and three daughters, and at least one more son and a daughter followed. Pye proved able to arrange advantageous matches for the three daughters who survived to adulthood: in 1632 Anne married Edward, son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22090/', "Sir Robert Phelips")</script> of Montacute, Somerset, carrying with her a portion of &pound;3000; Dorothy married Edward Poole of Kemble, Wiltshire, in 1638; and Mary married in 1641 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26099/', "George Speke")</script> of White Lackington, Somerset, whose wardship Pye had earlier bought for &pound;1800 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67750/', "Speke, Mary")</script>]. His youngest son, who died in 1660, Pye set up in business as a Levant merchant.<br>
<br>Pye sat in the parliaments of 1621 and 1624 as MP for Bath. The potential conflict between his financial responsibilities as a royal office-holder and his obligations as servant or client of the Villiers interest emerged openly in the parliaments of 1624&#150;6. In the last parliament of King James's reign, that of 1624, he turned against his old colleague and now chief, the lord treasurer, the earl of Middlesex (as Cranfield had become), who was the victim of the new alliance between Buckingham and the Commons' majority in favour of war against Spain. The auditor appeared as one of the witnesses in the lord treasurer's impeachment. In 1625 Pye was elected MP for Ludgershall and in 1626 for Westminster (where Buckingham was steward). In these first two parliaments of Charles I he defended his master, as in turn relations deteriorated between the Commons and Buckingham, although in 1627 Sir James Whitelocke privately praised Pye's conduct in connection with his disapproval of the then lord treasurer. In September of that year Pye, appalled by the disastrous financial and political consequences of the forced loan, advised his patron that the regime should make &#145;some speedy accommodation of this loan, for nothing pleaseth so long as this is on foot&#146;  (Cust, 71). In the election of 1628 Buckingham was unable to place Pye as MP for Westminster for a second time. In a tumultuous election, one newsletter reported, &#145;when Sir Robert Pye's party cried, &#147;A Pye, a Pye! a Pye!&#148; the adverse party would cry &#147;A pudding! a pudding! a pudding!&#148; and others &#147;A lie! a lie! a lie!&#148;&#146;, and he was beaten by over 1000 votes by his &#145;patriot&#146; opponents and forced to find a seat in the small Cornish borough of Grampound  (T. Birch, ed., <span class="italic">The Court and Times of Charles the First</span>, 2 vols., 1848, 1.327). In the parliament of 1628&#151;when his colleague, the senior revenue auditor of the upper exchequer, was savagely attacked, expelled from the house and committed to the Tower of London&#151;Pye's defence of Buckingham was limited to assuring the Commons that it was the favourite's mother and not his wife who was a recusant Catholic. Otherwise he tended to speak on financial technicalities. He was, however, extremely active in his capacity as an executor after Buckingham's assassination. Indeed, as late as 1638, the lord deputy of Ireland, Sir Thomas Wentworth (later first earl of Strafford) was strongly critical of him for putting the interests of the Villiers family before those of the crown, in connection with the Irish customs revenues.<br>
<br>As against this, Pye seems to have worked hard&#151;or got others to do so&#151;in preparing the revenue and expenditure balances and averages of 1635 (covering the years from 1631) and of 1636&#150;9; and he appears to have set about the same process for the reconstructed administration of 1641. Pye's very lukewarm support for the parliamentarian side may have owed more to his determination to retain his office than to any principled convictions. More than once he was saved from serious trouble only by his connections by marriage with John Hampden, whose daughter Anne had married his son Robert. None the less the king did summon the officers of the exchequer to join him in Oxford; Pye's colleague, who was also his &#145;comptroller&#146; and administrative rival, the clerk of the pells, obeyed this call. So there were two lower exchequers of receipt, in Westminster and in Oxford, during 1643&#150;6, although a large proportion of parliament's revenues came in through various <i>ad hoc</i> treasuries in the City of London, bypassing the exchequer altogether.<br>
<br>Pye's own estate lay in disputed territory which changed hands at least twice. Having been captured by the cavaliers, Faringdon Castle was virtually destroyed in a siege by Pye's own party. More positive evidence for his religious commitment is found in his membership (with his boyhood friend Sir Robert Harley) of a small committee to oversee the destruction of crucifixes and images in the captured royal regalia.<br>
<br>Pye was elected to the Long Parliament in December 1640 in a by-election at Woodstock. Not surprisingly he was among those members secluded at Pride's Purge in December 1648. His record as an MP, especially in the Long Parliament, suggests someone extremely active, and useful to the house, but not of major political importance. He seems to have taken no part in public life under the Commonwealth, but when the exchequer was re-established under the protectorate he failed to regain his old post as auditor, having to wait for this until the Restoration, when he protested, perhaps predictably, that he had never really been a parliamentarian at all. Pye's career epitomizes the interactions between the obligations of patron and client and the public service under the old administrative system. He died at Westminster on 20 May 1662. His will suggests considerable wealth but not vast affluence. The Berkshire estate went to the elder surviving son, Robert. The younger, John, inherited properties that Pye had bought in Staffordshire and Derbyshire which formed an estate substantial enough to support the baronetcy that he acquired in 1665.<br>
