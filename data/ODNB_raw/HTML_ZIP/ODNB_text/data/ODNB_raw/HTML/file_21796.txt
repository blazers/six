<span class="headword">Pelham,  Peter</span>  (1695?&#150;1751), <span class="occ">mezzotint engraver and painter in America</span>, may have been the Peter Pelham born in 1695 in London, the son of Peter Pelham, gentleman, who died in Chichester, in 1756. He was apprenticed in 1713 to the mezzotint engraver John Simon and afterwards scraped good mezzotints for various printsellers, but chiefly Edward Cooper. He married Martha Guy on 29 February 1719 and three sons, George, Peter, and Charles, were baptized at St Paul's, Covent Garden, in 1720, 1721, and 1722 when the family was living in Long Acre. Pelham's portrait of Samuel Shute, governor of Massachusetts, was painted in London in 1724, and in 1727 the family emigrated to America. Later correspondence suggests that Pelham had quarrelled with his father and they remained estranged until 1739. The Pelham family settled first in Summer Street and then in Cornhill, Boston. Pelham launched his career in America with a memorial mezzotint of the Revd Cotton Mather, the celebrated witch-hunter. A subscription for this print was proposed in the Boston newspapers in February 1728. Its price at 5 shillings was three times that of an equivalent print published in London. Pelham also opened a school at which he taught dancing and arithmetic. A son, William, was born at Boston in 1729 and his first wife died soon after. On 15 October 1734 he married Margaret Lowrey and moved to Newport, Rhode Island. He was back in Boston by 1737 where he taught &#145;Dancing, Writing, Reading, painting upon Glass, and all kinds of needle work&#146;  (<span class="italic">Boston Gazette</span>, 6 Feb 1738). At this point Pelham contacted and was reconciled with his father and sisters in England, though his father was uneasy that Pelham had married a second woman with no fortune. On 22 May 1748, however, Pelham was married a third time, to the apparently slightly wealthier Mary Singleton, widow of Richard Copley, a tobacconist. Pelham moved in to her house in Lindall Street and added her tobacco shop to his other interests. He probably taught her son John Singleton Copley the rudiments of art before he himself died intestate in December 1751. Pelham was buried in Trinity Church, Boston, on 14 December 1751.<br>

<a name="cosubject_21790"></a><span class="headword">Henry Pelham</span>  (1749&#150;1806), <span class="occ">surveyor and artist</span>, was born in Lindall Street, Boston, Massachusetts, on 14 February 1749, the son of Peter Pelham and his third wife, Mary. In 1770 he designed <span class="italic">The Fruits of Arbitrary Power, or, The Bloody Massacre</span>. His print was copied and hurriedly published by Paul Revere, an act of piracy that perhaps helped to push Pelham into the loyalist camp. Pelham left Boston for London in 1776, taking with him a fine <span class="italic">Plan of Boston in New England</span> that he published in 1777. He exhibited miniatures at the Royal Academy in 1777 and 1778 before settling in Ireland where he acted as agent to the Irish estates of the first marquess of Lansdowne. He also painted, engraved, and made maps including a twelve-sheet survey of co. Clare (1779). He married Caroline, daughter of William Butler of Castlecrine, possibly in 1778. He was drowned in 1806 while crossing the Kenmare River, co. Kerry.<br>
