<span class="headword">Robertson,  Donald Struan</span>  (1885&#150;1961), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born in London on 28 June 1885, the fourth child and only son of Henry Robert Robertson (1839&#150;1921), etcher and painter, and his wife, Agnes Lucy Turner. His eldest sister was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30427/', "Agnes Arber")</script>, the botanist. He went as a day boy to Westminster School, whence he won a major entrance scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge. He was placed in the first class in part one of the classical tripos in 1906 and in part two in 1908, specializing in classical archaeology. His distinctions included the members' Latin essay prize in 1906, the first chancellor's medal in 1908, and the Stewart of Rannoch (1905), Pitt (1907), and Charles Oldham (1908) scholarships. He competed for a Trinity fellowship with a dissertation on the manuscript tradition of Apuleius's <span class="italic">Apologia</span> which he enlivened with stories from Apuleius's <span class="italic">Metamorphoses</span> and, successful at the first attempt, was elected in 1909.<br>
<br>In the same year Robertson married Petica Coursolles (1883&#150;1941), daughter of Major Charles Jones of the Royal Artillery, to whom he had become engaged after an acquaintanceship as brief as the marriage was successful. She was one of six sisters, all distinguished, nieces of Robert Ross, the friend of Oscar Wilde; one of them was E. B. C. Jones, the novelist. Their first child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94618/', "(Charles) Martin Robertson (1911&#150;2004)")</script>, was later professor of classical archaeology at Oxford; he was followed by Giles Henry Robertson (1913&#150;1987), who became professor of fine art at Edinburgh.<br>
<br>In 1911 Robertson was appointed assistant lecturer on the classical staff at Trinity, joining Ernest Harrison and Francis Cornford. On the outbreak of war, in spite of a slight congenital lameness, he was commissioned in the Royal Army Service Corps, in which he rose to the rank of major. He returned in 1919 to lecturing and supervising at Trinity, and in 1928 he succeeded A. C. Pearson as regius professor of Greek.<br>
<br>Between the wars Robertson lived a full and happy life in his Bateman Street house in Cambridge, where many of the most interesting and distinguished figures of the university young and old, as well as visiting scholars, were to be encountered. His wife was an enthusiastic, although unpretentious, hostess, who gave reassurance to those who sensed a certain intellectual austerity in their host.<br>
<br>From the beginning archaeology and literature were the fields of classical scholarship that engaged Robertson's interest. He was sensitive to the visual arts and had a keen enjoyment of poetry in many languages, although largely indifferent to what in his day was called &#145;modern&#146;. It was on archaeology that he first lectured, but soon after his return in 1919 he turned to Greek literature; he took particular pleasure in his course on poetry from Homer to Aeschylus, which attracted large audiences. His delivery was rapid and his matter highly compressed, but he spoke with patent sincerity touched at times with eloquence, especially when Homer or Pindar was his subject. He gave also specialist courses both on literature and on textual criticism.<br>
<br>Robertson's first book was <span class="italic">A Handbook of Greek and Roman Architecture</span> (1929), which covered some of the same ground as the sections on architecture which he contributed to volumes 4&#150;6 of the <span class="italic">Cambridge Ancient History</span>. It was a masterly survey by one who clearly had it in him to write far more than a textbook. He revised it for a second edition in 1943 and it has been several times reprinted. In 1969 the word &#145;handbook&#146; was dropped from the title.<br>
<br>The work for which Robertson will be best remembered is his text of the <span class="italic">Metamorphoses</span> of Apuleius, published in the <span class="roman">Bud&eacute;</span> series (3 vols., 1940&#150;45). He spent many years over the collation of the manuscripts, whose relationship he established, and produced a greatly improved text accompanied by an apparatus criticus remarkable for its economy.<br>
<br>In 1941 Robertson suffered a stunning blow in the loss of his wife, who, while on duty as an air-raid warden, became the only person in Cambridge to be killed by a German bomb. He now moved from his house to rooms in college, and continued to take an active part in university affairs and in college administration, serving as vice-master from 1947 to 1951. But the shock of his wife's death seems to have caused him to turn away from his old studies. At all times he had read widely in several languages and on varied subjects, and a colleague with some truth described him as &#145;a Renaissance polymath&#146;; but he now ranged far beyond the Greek and Latin classics, acquiring expert knowledge of Icelandic and Old Persian. Soon after his retirement from his chair in 1950, he suffered a series of heart attacks, and the state of his health caused great anxiety; he was looked after with kindness by Nora Kershaw Chadwick, the widow of H. M. Chadwick. But the effect of his wife's loss more than any other factor seems to have been responsible for his failure to complete the work on Pindar of which he had spoken in his inaugural lecture of 1929. In view of the high quality of the articles and notes that he brought out, which combined rare learning with rare literary sensitivity, this is much to be regretted.<br>
<br>A young Trinity colleague of great promise, George Cary, son of Joyce Cary, was writing an important study of the various versions of the <span class="roman">Alexander Romance</span>. Cary died suddenly in 1953, and Robertson became occupied in helping his widow, Margaret Ann (<i>b</i>. 1925), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35520/', "Sir Eric Phipps")</script>, in preparing the work for publication. They were married in 1956, and Robertson spent his last years in their house, 37 Madingley Road, Cambridge. He died in the Evelyn Nursing Home, Cambridge, on 5 October 1961. Robertson had been elected fellow of the British Academy in 1940; he received honorary degrees from the universities of Durham, Glasgow, and Athens.<br>
