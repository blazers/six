<span class="headword">Spurgin,  John</span>  (1796&#150;1866), <span class="occ">physician and medical writer</span>, was born at Orplands, Bradwell, Essex, where he was baptized on 6 October 1796, the son of William Spurgin, farmer, and his wife, Mary, formerly Payne. He was educated at Chelmsford grammar school (1804&#150;13), then at St Thomas's Hospital from 1813 to 1815. He matriculated at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1814 and held a scholarship there from Michaelmas 1815 to Michaelmas 1816. He then studied at Edinburgh, returning to Cambridge where he graduated MB in 1820 and MD in 1825. He was elected fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 30 September 1826, holding the office of censor in 1829 and that of conciliarius in 1851&#150;3 and 1862&#150;4. He delivered the Harveian oration in 1851 and the college lectures on materia medica in 1852, in which he dealt with the science of the blood.<br>
<br>From 1820 Spurgin built up an extensive private practice at 38 Guilford Street, Bloomsbury, moving in 1853 to 11 and then 17 Great Cumberland Street, Hyde Park, where he afterwards remained. He was physician to the Foundling Hospital from 1835 until his death, and physician to St Mark's Hospital from 1855 to 1866. Spurgin and his wife, Rose (1809/10&#150;1882), had a large family, six of whom were baptized at St Pancras. He was the inventor of an &#145;endless ladder&#146;, whereby a pair of endless ropes or chains carrying treads or small tubs ran over revolving drums at the top and bottom of mineshafts or building works, as an efficient method of transporting men and materials. He patented this device (no. 7054) in 1834, and in 1837 filed another patent (no. 7368) for a means of propelling ships by chain-driven paddles. A third patent (no. 12,106) of 1848 related to the zinc plating of steel pen nibs. He also advertised &#145;Dr Spurgin's Condiment&#146;, a solution of common salt and alkaline phosphates, as a digestive and purifier of the blood.<br>
<br>As a young man Spurgin had been attracted to the works of Swedenborg, whose views he gradually adopted and which influenced his religious and moralistic writing. He gave an account of his experiences in a lecture read before the Swedenborg Association on 24 February 1847 and published the same year. He was for a while chairman of the society, and he intended to produce a translation of Swedenborg's philosophical works, but the only volume published was <span class="italic">The introduction to an anatomical, physical, and philosophical investigation of the economy of the animal kingdom</span>, with an address to the reader by Medicus Cantabrigiensis (1861). From December 1860 until March 1861 Spurgin was the plaintiff on behalf of the Swedenborgian Society in a lawsuit against William White, the society's resident bookseller, who, it was claimed, was selling &#145;spiritualist&#146; tracts emanating from a rival author. In an unpleasant and increasingly petulant series of hearings the society failed to dislodge the bookseller immediately as his contract allowed him to sell what books he wished.<br>
<br>Having published his <span class="italic">Six Lectures on Materia Medica</span> in 1852, Spurgin expanded his thesis that blood was the prime fluid, controlling all aspects of the body and its state of health, in <span class="italic">The Physician for All: his Philosophy, his Experience and his Mission</span> (&#145;First curriculum&#146;, 1855; &#145;Second curriculum&#146;, 1857). In his popular booklet <span class="italic">Cure of the Sick: not Hom&#339;opathy, not Allopathy, but Judgement</span> (1860) Spurgin asserted that he himself exercised judgement on the treatment to be applied, and that he had never lost a patient to practitioners of homoeopathy or allopathy, from which he diverted into a lengthy criticism of a recent treatise by Granier on homoeopathy. In <span class="italic">Drainage of Cities, Reserving their Sewage for Use and Keeping their Rivers Clean</span> (1858) he proposed modifications to the current plans to build conduits to divert sewage from the Thames.<br>
<br>Spurgin was considered by an obituarist to be &#145;a practitioner of good common sense &hellip; a large-hearted man and an honour to the profession. At the peak of his career he took to farming and spent his later years in indolence&#146;  (Clarke). On 20 September 1865, returning from a visit to a patient at Wanstead, Spurgin was attacked in Bishopsgate by thieves who tried to garrotte him. The injuries he received led to his death at 17 Great Cumberland Street on 20 March 1866.<br>
