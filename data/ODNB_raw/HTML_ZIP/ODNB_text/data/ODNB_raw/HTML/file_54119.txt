<span class="headword">Dymock,  Cressy</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1629&#150;1660), <span class="occ">agriculturist</span>, was possibly the son of Sir Thomas Dymocke, from the Lincolnshire/Nottinghamshire borders, but little is known of his background. He entered Gray's Inn on 3 August 1629. Surviving poetry in the British Library suggests a ready pen and na&iuml;ve wit. Dymock attributed his commitment to agrarian reform to Samuel Hartlib, whom he met about 1648. In the early 1650s he became one of Hartlib's most loyal admirers, promoting machines for setting corn and grinding, rabbit-farming schemes, and intensive husbandry, mostly known only through Hartlib's papers. He appreciated the weaknesses of contemporary agrarian production and tackled them with mechanical and other innovations. He understood that intensive husbandry involved a planned farming environment. His layout of an ideal farm, which Hartlib published as <span class="italic">A Discoverie for &hellip; Setting Out of Land</span> (1653), deplored the &#145;Want of Enclosure&#146;. At the same time, Dymock was particularly proud of his &#145;universal engine&#146;, the &#145;wedding of strength and tyme&#146; which was advertised in print in 1651. Dymock also contributed to Hartlib's other agrarian publications.<br>
<br>Dymock was not a landowner and finding a suitable location and backers for his schemes proved problematic&#151;the nearest he came to success was in 1653 at Wadworth, near Doncaster, on a cousin's farm. His mechanical drill and roller worked well but the labourers proved &#145;extremely Churlish&#146;, a problem he had anticipated in his proposed &#145;Colledge of Husbandrye&#146;, reflecting the utilitarian educational notions of Hartlib's circle. By the Restoration, however, Dymock was poor. His claim &#145;to the office of [king's] Champion&#146; in the forthcoming coronation (an office to which he believed his family had ancient rights) was disappointed and he apparently died shortly thereafter.<br>
