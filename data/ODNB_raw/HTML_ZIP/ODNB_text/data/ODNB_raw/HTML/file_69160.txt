<span class="headword">Williamson,  Laurence</span>  (1855&#150;1936), <span class="occ">crofter and antiquary</span>, was born on 11 March 1855 at Linkshouse, Mid Yell, Shetland, the only son and the elder of the two children of James Williamson (1800&#150;1872), postmaster and general merchant, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gardner (1819&#150;1906), a native of the island of Fetlar. He was a precocious pupil of Andrew D. Mathewson, an eccentric schoolteacher at East Yell. His family on both sides was full of lore and genealogies from Fetlar and Yell, and he revelled in them. His father, a reserved man, had an important influence on him. &#145;I was under a Medo-Persian law&#146;, Williamson wrote later,<blockquote>not [to] stir anywhere without leave nor meddle with anybody or anything but my own affairs. &hellip; Any deviation from this rule was strictly reprimanded. &hellip; In my sister it developed a spirit of resistance, self-reliance and independence. &hellip; Entirely unlike him &hellip; but bound hand, foot and tongue, I feared to ask the least freedom, otherwise I was kindly dealt with. Naturally I turned to this open pleasant field [of scholarship], away from the hedged and thorny; the result was I remained weak, handless, unmanly, while the understanding developed and knowledge was acquired. (Johnson, 18)</blockquote>After his father's death Williamson left school and succeeded him as sub-postmaster. He became skilled in the use of the telegraph: Mid Yell was a busy herring port in the late 1870s and early 1880s. In 1884, however, he abruptly resigned his post and devoted the rest of his life to what might be called crofting. He frequently neglected his croft to make some mathematical observation, or collect and record some piece of local lore: in a letter of 1900, sprinkled (as was his habit) with local dialect, he told his sister how he:<blockquote>wrought hard at the lay [uncultivated] heads of rigs [small fields] 2 and 4 (counting from east), some 25 pace each, 6 days should have done me: but many interruptions, and yesterday mostly taken up winduing Scots-ets [winnowing Scotch oats] (9 bushel) and taking in ait-skroo [oat-stack] which mice had spoilt&#151;killed 29. Also last piece very bad sooriks [sorrel] so not finisht. (Laurence Williamson to May Williamson, 24 April 1900, Shetland Archives, D.7/9/9)</blockquote>The scholars Karl Blind and Jakob Jakobsen, interested in Shetland lore and language respectively, were impressed by Williamson's scholarship. He happily shared his collections with them: Jakobsen's <span class="italic">Etymological Dictionary of the Norn Language in Shetland</span> (2 vols., 1928&#150;32), for instance, is full of his contributions. He himself found it difficult to record and arrange his work effectively. He transcribed words, definitions, stories, and conversations, using a phonetic system of his own, but he wrote in microscopic script on minute scraps of paper (one of his manuscripts, an A4 page, contains 20,000 words). He published little or none of his material, except for a few pieces of journalism and a short note here and there.<br>
<br>Like many contemporaries, Williamson espoused views about &#145;race-type&#146; and celebrated the Scandinavian ancestry of Shetlanders. &#145;After all&#146;, he wrote to his cousin in 1916,<blockquote>my mind turns with most liking to the Norse type, in spite of their want of philosophic thinking and their terrible persistence. Their simplicity, frankness, sincerity, and their depth and persistence of affections, their firmness and bravery when need is all are most precious, and their independence and love of freedom. (Johnson, 175)</blockquote>At the same time he had reservations about British, and especially Scottish, influences in the islands; he and others saw these as ruinous. In 1897 he refused to attend bonfires in Yell commemorating Queen Victoria's jubilee because, as he said, it was &#145;an Established Church thing&#146;: &#145;I object to the jubilee and kingly craze as unpatriotic, seeing the destruction they have worked on Shetland and its institutions and its opposition to the Norse spirit&#146;  (Laurence Williamson to May Williamson, 22 June 1897, Shetland Archives, D.7/6/12).<br>
<br>Just as most of Williamson's contemporaries looked on him as a curiosity, there is evidence that he himself felt out of place, in Yell and everywhere else. Writing to his cousin in 1901 he said: &#145;In bygone Yule-times &hellip; I have often wished you were here beside us. It is true there were rants [dances] almost every Yule-time, but I never went to them. I seldom felt more isolated than at Yule&#146;  (Johnson, 173). His main contacts with people were with a few select companions; during the last thirty years of his life he lived in poverty with his sister May. He died, unmarried, in Mid Yell on 25 April 1936, but had elected to be buried in the churchyard at Fetlar, the home of his ancestors.<br>
<br>One of Williamson's companions, Laurence G. Johnson, became his fast friend, and, after his death, his literary executor. Johnson sifted through and preserved Williamson's manifold scraps of paper, which are now in the Shetland Archives in Lerwick. In 1971, following years of devoted work, Johnson produced a biography, <span class="italic">Laurence Williamson of Mid Yell</span>, which gives a vivid account of its subject's life and work. Johnson edited selections from Williamson's papers, and thus made them available to a wide readership for the first time; they reveal Williamson's philosophical and scholarly tone of mind and his sometimes beautiful use of the English language.<br>
