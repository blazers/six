<span class="headword">Davie <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Dryer]</span>,  Elspeth Mary</span>  (1919&#150;1995), <span class="occ">short-story writer and novelist</span>, was born in Kilmarnock Infirmary, Ayrshire, on 20 March 1919, the daughter of Oliver Dryer, a Church of Scotland minister, and his Canadian wife, Lilian McFarlane. Her father had a Norwegian grandfather, and Elspeth was always conscious of Norse affinities. Her mother was of old loyalist stock, while her father&#151;who was something of a womanizer&#151;was a strong pacifist; before Elspeth's birth he served in London as secretary of the pacifist Fellowship of Reconciliation. When Elspeth was nine he returned to Scotland, to a parochial charge in Bonnyrigg, Midlothian. Elspeth attended the esteemed George Watson's Ladies' College, in Edinburgh, but would say that she learned less there than in her dame-school in London, where she was bowled over by <span class="italic">Beowulf</span>. However, she made some mark at Watson's, as a winning high-jumper. Her elder sister, Lois, who married the distinguished theologian Donald McKinnon, was a brilliant philosophy student at Edinburgh University. Elspeth followed her there, and she too did well in philosophy, while also studying English and fine art, but her maths was not good enough for her to complete an MA, so she moved to the city's famous college of art, where she took a diploma.<br>
<br>Walking in the borders with a friend on 11 July 1938 Elspeth met in a youth hostel &#145;a dark, heavy sort of fellow &hellip; dark brooding eyes behind glasses&#146;. They talked all evening and carried on after breakfast the next day, &#145;both hungering to talk and discuss real things &hellip; I felt we could, in the end, have spoken about anything&#146;, as she recorded in her diary  (<span class="italic">Chapman 81</span>, 12&#150;13). Her new friend was George Elder Davie (1912&#150;2007), a legend for conversational erudition in Edinburgh student circles, a philosopher just returned from postgraduate study in Germany. His most famous book, <span class="italic">The Democratic Intellect: Scotland and her Universities in the Nineteenth Century</span>, published in 1961, made an enormous and enduring impact on serious Scottish thinking. He and Elspeth married on 5 October 1944; their daughter, Anne, was born in 1946.<br>
<br>Elspeth taught art in schools in Aberdeen and the borders. By 1946 she was in Belfast, where George was teaching at Queen's University. There she painted <i>en plein air</i>, quickly, in a style that echoed French post-impressionism, and sold her canvasses. (She set little store by them, and did not paint after George returned to Edinburgh University in 1959.) She also befriended a general practitioner, Pat Strang, then intimately involved with Philip Larkin. She met Strang for serious discussion of literature once a week, and Larkin took an interest in Strang's quiet friend. She was cautious in forming relationships, having seen in her own family the consequences of over-free &#145;giving&#146;. She could impress people as shy and retiring, yet she talked well; once, when George Davie visited his friend Hugh MacDiarmid at his cottage near Biggar, the poet saw him out with &#145;Next time you come bring Elspeth with you&#151;she will aerate the conversation.&#146; She kept up with old friends from college days but did not go out much to court new ones. She read voraciously, deep into the night. The significant record of the last four decades of her life is simply that of her writing.<br>
<br>Elspeth Davie had composed short stories at school. Published excerpts from her diaries of 1938 show that she arrived at an alarmingly mature prose style extremely early. But her gift did not begin to emerge into public view until <span class="italic">The Observer</span> launched a short-story competition in 1951. The winner was Muriel Spark, from Edinburgh, who thus began her own impressive career in fiction. Elspeth Davie was runner-up. From then her rise to eminence was gradual. Notable magazines began to take her stories. She attracted the attention of a fellow Scot, John Calder, who had been the prime publisher of Samuel Beckett in English. He introduced in translation other experimental European writers, including the French novelist Robbe-Grillet, theorist of the <i>nouveau roman</i>, with whom Elspeth felt an especial affinity. In his world human beings are, up to a point, dominated by objects. Calder and Boyars were therefore the natural publishers for the first novel by this quiet <i>avant-gardiste</i>. <span class="italic">Providings</span> appeared in 1965. Three more novels followed: <span class="italic">Creating a Scene</span> (1971), about art teaching; <span class="italic">Climbers on a Stair</span> (1978); and <span class="italic">Coming to Light</span> (1989).<br>
<br>But it was Davie's short stories that provided the basis for mounting critical esteem, represented by her winning the prestigious Kathleen Mansfield prize in 1978. Calder and Boyars published her first collection, <span class="italic">The Spark</span>, in 1969. Four more followed, from other publishers: <span class="italic">The High Tide Talker</span> (1976), <span class="italic">The Night of the Funny Hats</span> (1980), <span class="italic">A Traveller's Room</span> (1985), and <span class="italic">Death of a Doctor</span> (1992). Three title-stories represent her range and preoccupations. In &#145;The High Tide Talker&#146; a man who claims to be an actor appears every day on the beach of a popular resort and preaches to holidaymakers up to the point where the high tide drowns his words, so that his ultimate message is not revealed. This highly original fable displays Davie's interest in &#145;acting&#146;, and also her abiding theological concerns. The latter emerge also in &#145;The Night of the Funny Hats&#146;, in which a coachload of travellers and tourists progress through the great southern desert of Australia. &#145;Death of a Doctor&#146; is confined to at most an hour in one place. As a nurse moves through a crowded waiting room, breaking to each patient in turn news that their doctor has just died, watchers from windows across the street are jealous because they imagine that some kind of social occasion is in progress. Breaking a simple scene into discrete particles, each dwelt on unemphatically in turn, and changing it into a kind of performance, Davie compels the reader to brood with her on what she called &#145;the secret side of life&#146;  (Gordon, <span class="italic">Beyond the Words</span>, 87).<br>
<br>Davie believed that meaning could not be abstracted, validly, from a good story; the whole story was its meaning. Her meanings are conveyed by unusual methods. Her stories are copiously populated but remarkably few persons are named. It has been noted, astutely, that &#145;unlike many excellent woman novelists&#146; she does not &#145;discriminate in favour of female characters&#146;  (Todd, 179); general humankind attends like a Greek chorus the quiet agonies of male principals. She is absorbed with precise visual and aural detailing, but is usually uninterested in smells or sexuality. She offers a vision of humanity transiently and sadly engaged with life under enduring stars, with the arts (music as well as drama and painting) offering the reader, as they did her, purpose.<br>
<br>Elspeth and George Davie lived for many years at 15 Leven Terrace, Edinburgh&#151;a flat at the top of a handsome mid-Victorian block. From one side the view was across the meadows, past the Royal Infirmary and the university, to the ominous grandeur of Arthur's Seat. On another side, over Bruntsfield Links, was James Gillespie's School&#151;the original of Marcia Blane's in Muriel Spark's <span class="italic">The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</span>. The flat was the venue of Davie's novel <span class="italic">Climbers on a Stair</span>. By 1982 a hundred stairs were too much for the ageing couple. George had just retired from the university and Elspeth had suffered a mild brain haemorrhage. But when they moved to a modern block in north Edinburgh they chose another top flat (albeit one reached by a lift). They shared a taste for the long view. Elspeth did not discuss her reading with George, and he found her almost aggressively indifferent to his obsession with the history of Scottish education. To a reader though, the overlapping of their philosophical concerns is amply apparent. Their outwardly quiet lives suggested mutual devotion.<br>
<br>After her first stroke Elspeth, who had never cared for housework, gave it even less attention, but she kept on writing, very well. The second blow fell in 1992. She could still put up a show for visitors, but she was finished. George nursed her as long as he could but at last had to put her in a home. She died at Queensbury House Hospital, Edinburgh, on 13 November 1995, as quietly as she had lived. She had never been a best-seller, but the brilliant younger generations of more flamboyant Scottish fiction writers who had followed in her wake included many who admired her craftsmanship and deep intelligence. Her ongoing and increasing reputation was indicated by the appearance in 2001 of a large selection of her stories, <span class="italic">The Man who Wanted to Smell Books</span>, published as a <span class="roman">Canongate Classic</span>. Introducing it, Giles Gordon evoked her appearance in a certain notable photograph:<blockquote>The stern, severe, intelligent face&#151;intense searchlight eyes; prominent nose; tight but wide lips; compassionate strong chin&#151;is topped by a sensible fringe and Mrs Davie wears a black, halter-neck jumper. Here is a latter-day Presbyterian visage with a vengeance. (p. vii)</blockquote>Her Presbyterian vision was certainly not a matter of routine adherence to the kirk, in which her father had reared her. It derived more broadly from the overarching protestant traditions and grey starkness of Edinburgh, and from a rigorous intellectualism tempered by devotion to kindliness and beauty.<br>
