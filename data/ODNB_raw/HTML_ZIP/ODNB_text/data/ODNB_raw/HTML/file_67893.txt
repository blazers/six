<span class="headword">Burn,  William Laurence</span>  (1904&#150;1966), <span class="occ">historian and lawyer</span>, was born on 15 October 1904 at Bombay House, Angate Street, Wolsingham, co. Durham, the only son of Laurence Burn (1864&#150;1920) and his wife, Annie (1871&#150;1931), daughter of William Coates of Oakcroft, Wolsingham. Burn's father was a minor landowner and tradesman, possessing a local quasi-patriarchal position which his son was to inherit. Burn was educated at Wolsingham grammar school (1914&#150;19), Durham School (1919&#150;22), and Merton College, Oxford (1922&#150;5). He graduated with a second-class degree in modern history in 1925 and was appointed assistant in history at the University of St Andrews. In 1929 he became assistant lecturer in colonial and American history. While a Rockefeller fellow in America in 1932&#150;3 he married (in the latter year) Alice (1902&#150;1970), eldest daughter of John Proud of Wolsingham. Their son, Nicholas, was born in 1936. In 1932 Burn was called to the bar (Inner Temple), and for the remainder of his life historical scholarship and the law provided twin strands to his career.<br>
<br>During his ten years at St Andrews, Burn established himself as a historian. His main achievement there was the publication in 1937 of <span class="italic">Emancipation and Apprenticeship in the British West Indies</span>. Many years later this was still seen as &#145;a scholarly monograph and the definitive work on apprenticeship&#146;  (E. Williams, <span class="italic">From Columbus to Castro</span>, 1970, 545). Already a distinctive quality which combined his two main interests, history and law, was apparent, for his starting point was the act of 1833 which emancipated the slaves. He posed the questions, &#145;How does the statute emerge, in the end, from the mill of human obstinacy, apathy and selfishness? Are its results such that, had they been accurately foreseen, it would ever have been passed?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Emancipation and Apprenticeship</span>, 7).<br>
<br>Nevertheless, despite scholarly distinction, Burn's years at St Andrews were not entirely congenial. The role of junior staff at Scottish universities was distinctly subordinate. Initially he was essentially an assistant to the lecturer in modern history, and even after his position improved in 1929 he &#145;filled in the many gaps left by the Professor&#146;. Moreover, that academic community was far from harmonious. Burn made many friends and earned a reputation as an excellent teacher, but he also experienced what he later described as &#145;old rancour&#146; there  (letter to Knox, 20 Dec 1938). In 1937 he resigned and returned home to practise as a barrister on the north-eastern circuit and in the Durham chancery court. This did not involve abandoning his historical interests, and he always envisaged a return to academic life.<br>
<br>In the years immediately before the Second World War Burn clear-sightedly appreciated that war was coming, and enlisted in the army reserve. In 1940 he was called up as a second lieutenant in the Royal Army Service Corps, but his army service proved short-lived. Injured during a parachute descent early in 1941 he contracted phlebitis. He was invalided from the army but was seconded to work in the research department of the Foreign Office. He was one of several distinguished historians employed there, and late in 1943 some of them, including Arnold Toynbee, backed him strongly for a history chair at King's College, Newcastle, in the University of Durham. He hesitated before deciding to accept, but in 1944 took up the chair which he held for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Burn made a major contribution to what became, in 1963, the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, by his teaching, his research and publications, and his administrative services. He was largely responsible for the key decision to constitute the senate of the new university as a small body capable of effective executive action rather than as a large and unwieldy assembly. Perhaps even more important, he informally provided counsel to many colleagues. As head of department he was respected and liked by colleagues and students alike. His lectures were popular, interesting, and perceptive. He was a sought-after external examiner, and held visiting appointments at places as diverse as University College, Ibadan, and Johns Hopkins University. He served on the council of the Royal Historical Society from 1954 to 1957, and also on several government commissions.<br>
<br>During his Newcastle tenure Burn consolidated a reputation as a distinguished scholar, although now his interests had moved to mainstream British history. He was in frequent demand as a reviewer and contributor to historical journals. In a review article in 1953 he wrote of Britain after 1832 that<blockquote>There was always plenty, perhaps a majority, of competent, business-like, not too sensitive or scrupulous persons, who took the world as they found it and set themselves to squeeze money or power or position out of it. They were not, perhaps, the most admirable of mankind but they conducted into safer channels feelings which, if left to themselves, might have disrupted society. (<span class="italic">Twentieth-Century</span>, 144.127)</blockquote>His most significant publication was <span class="italic">The Age of Equipoise: a Study of the Mid-Victorian Generation</span> (1964), described by one scholar as &#145;full of learning, sympathy, insights and wisdom&#146;  (D. E. D. Beales, <span class="italic">Historical Journal</span>, 8, 1965, 418). Another distinguished writer commented:<blockquote>To capacious reading, wise discernment, and a scholar's handling of evidence, are added the less usual accompaniments of lightness of touch, visual imagination, and an occasional use of almost impressionistic technique which few professional historians could have devised and fewer would have attempted. (N. Gash, <span class="italic">Alumnus Chronicle</span>, St Andrews, June 1964, 24.5)</blockquote>It was an idiosyncratic work, and the author's command of the law as well as of history was evident. The breadth of coverage involved reflected an immense amount of reading in primary sources (a personal affection for Surtees and Trollope was part of his make-up). The book's title was expanded by the appreciation that &#145;If there was equipoise it was not deliberately planned or contrived. It was the outcome of a temporary balance of forces, but of forces, struggling, pushing, shoving to better their positions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Age of Equipoise</span>, 82). At the time the left-wing &#145;labour history&#146; approach associated with authors like E. J. Hobsbawm and E. P. Thompson was at its height, and <span class="italic">The Age of Equipoise</span>, together with works by such historians as G. Kitson Clark, O. MacDonagh, and D. Roberts, provided useful balancing factors. Burn's sudden death in 1966 was a blow to historical scholarship, involving the loss of two important projects to which he had turned, one a replacement of the volume for 1870&#150;1914 in the <span class="italic">Oxford History of England</span> and the other a major study of Anglo-Irish relations. The president of the Royal Historical Society offered this tribute:<blockquote>He brought to his historical studies a first-hand knowledge and understanding of the law, of local government, of public administration, and of county or country society at all levels. He brought also a broad humanity, a sturdy common sense, an ironic wit, an aversion from humbug, and a profound insight into the complexities of human nature and of social and intellectual life. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 19 July 1966)</blockquote>Burn's university work was only part of a busy and varied life. Under the pen-name Richard Sheldon, he wrote two detective novels, <span class="italic">Poor Prisoner's Defence</span> (1949) and <span class="italic">Harsh Evidence</span> (1950). The latter is much the better of the pair, being written around an imaginary murder trial of 1874; suspense is skilfully built up and lasts until the final verdict at the end. In his early years at Newcastle University commitments still allowed a parallel part-time career as a judge. A Durham county magistrate from 1946, he became deputy chairman of quarter sessions in 1953 and chairman in 1958. This was an important part of his contribution to his home region, but he also served on a variety of local government, farming, and public service institutions. As time went by his commitments became increasingly onerous. The university needed more of his time, and judicial duties grew even more. An observer noted that &#145;He often looked exhausted, as he sat, by the hour, patiently listening to the crimes of the county paraded before him day by day&#146;  (<span class="italic">Northern Echo</span>, 12 July 1966). His health was increasingly threatened, and on 11 July 1966 he died at Dryburn Hospital, Durham, following a sudden heart attack while on his way from his home to Newcastle. His funeral in Wolsingham parish church on 14 July was a most impressive demonstration of the respect and affection felt for him over a wide range of the region's society. He was buried in the churchyard.<br>
<br>Burn was a devout Anglican, and a churchwarden for many years. In politics he was a staunch Conservative, resigning from a local hospital board after the minister of health, Aneurin Bevan, made a notorious speech describing Conservatives as &#145;vermin&#146;. He distrusted the state, noting in 1938 that it was &#145;surely the proper initial step, to believe the government wrong and to resolve upon minimizing whatever amount of power over yourself you are obliged to hand over to them&#146;  (Burn to Knox, 13 March 1938). In late 1941 he wrote that &#145;One great fear that I have is the spread of what I call democratic totalitarianism&#151;the totalitarianism of Bevin and Morrison&#151;in this country after the war&#146;  (Burn to Knox, 22 Dec 1941). His writings and his conversation were spiced with a pleasing dry wit, and he was a very agreeable companion.<br>
