<span class="headword">Edwards,  George</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>George Parker, G. E. Parker, Mr Wards]</span>  (1787?&#150;1843), <span class="occ">modeller and spy</span>, was born in London, the youngest of three children of a man called Edwards and a sometime lottery keeper by the name of Gordon, whom Edwards had courted in a gin shop, according to Aylmer, one of the few biographical sources available. Details of the early life of George Edwards are sketchy, but it is said that, when his father abandoned the family, the youth helped his mother to run her lottery partnership and embarked on a career as a petty thief. By the age of eight he had been caught stealing from a grocer's shop and from a local public house. Having shown early artistic abilities he was encouraged to paint, but preferred modelling, and went on to serve a full apprenticeship with the Smithfield statuary, Chicani. In March 1808 Edwards married Eleanor Hampton, whom he physically abused and abandoned for nine months. Nothing is known of his movements from the end of his apprenticeship to his arrival in Eton some six years later, but it seems likely that his involvement in a scheme with John Castles, a government spy, to free French prisoners of war and then to betray them to the authorities for a reward belongs to this period.<br>
<br>About 1814 Edwards moved to Windsor and ran a modeller's shop at 50 High Street, Eton. One of his best-selling lines was a plaster likeness of Dr John Keate, the unpopular headmaster of Eton College, which was bought by the schoolboys for target practice. The writer and publisher Charles Knight, who was also a customer, remembered Edwards in his <span class="italic">Passages of a Working Life</span> as a &#145;diminutive animal with downcast look and stealthy face&#146;. Another visitor was Sir Herbert Taylor, then private secretary to George III, and it was possibly through him that Edwards was invited to model busts of members of the royal family. While at Windsor, Edwards became an active member of the radical Spencean Society and managed to get his brother William, said to have been a Bow Street officer in Windsor, elected secretary. It is known that following the death in 1814 of Thomas Spence, founder of Spenceanism, the modeller was asked to supply fifteen busts to mark the occasion. Whether or not the two brothers ever shared a genuine interest in the political aims of the Spenceans remains a matter of speculation. What is beyond doubt is that by January 1818 George was willing to sell his knowledge of the society to government officials. Although Edwards and his brother were said to have incited violence among the disaffected at Spa Fields in 1817, there is no evidence that George was a government informer before 1818. After this date, however, Spenceans were closely watched.<br>
<br>By the time Edwards began passing information it would appear that he had left his shop in Eton, where he owed money and had lost patrons. He moved to London, establishing himself in William Hone's former premises at Fleet Street. Here, from January 1819, the radical journalist and publisher Richard Carlile was his next-door neighbour. Carlile commissioned him to make a full-length figure of Thomas Paine and also a likeness of himself, which Edwards completed while Carlile was incarcerated in the king's bench prison. Throughout this period the modeller was busily employed as a government spy, worming his way into the confidence of the Spencean Arthur Thistlewood and other malcontents, reporting his findings to Henry Hobhouse of the Home Office, and inciting violence towards government ministers. After the discovery of the Cato Street conspiracy on 23 February 1820 it was Edwards who led police to the hide-out of Thistlewood [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58584/', "Cato Street conspirators (act. 1820)")</script>]. At the subsequent trial of the leading conspirators the pivotal role of Edwards as the plot's instigator and the chief supplier of weapons and ammunition was revealed. Edwards, however, was never called as a witness. He went into hiding under the name of Wards but early in May was reported to have been spotted in Cambridge. Soon afterwards Alderman Wood MP called for a Commons inquiry to investigate the government's role in the conspiracy. His motion failed, but on 23 May Edwards was indicted for high treason, and a reward of 100 guineas offered for his capture. He is described in <span class="italic">The Times</span>' notice as being 5 feet 3 inches in height, &#145;thin and pale-faced, with an aquiline nose, grey eyes and light brown hair&#146;.<br>
<br>Meanwhile the fugitive had fled to Guernsey under the name of G. E. Parker, leaving behind his wife and four young children, who eventually joined him in July. The Home Office occasionally sent him small sums of money, but there is no record of Edwards ever having received the &pound;1000 reward for the capture of Thistlewood. Early in August 1820 he disappeared completely from Home Office records and the evidence suggests that he emigrated with his family to Cape Colony. A George Parker, modeller, is listed as living at Green Point in 1840. A &#145;George Parker jun., lime-burner&#146;, also of Green Point, is listed in the same issue of the <span class="italic">Cape Calendar and Annual Register</span>. On 30 November 1843, according to a local newspaper, &#145;George Parker senior&#146; died, aged fifty-six.<br>
