<span class="headword">Stacey <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Petrie]</span>,  Margaret <span class="st"> [Meg]</span></span>  (1922&#150;2004), <span class="occ">sociologist</span>, was born on 27 March 1922 at 160 Hazelwood Lane, Palmers Green, Middlesex, the elder daughter of Conrad Eugene Petrie, a mantle manufacturer and businessman, and his wife, Grace Priscilla, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Boyce, a teacher. Retaining the name Margaret for formal, professional use, she was widely known as Meg. Her strong drive to do well academically and to forge her own way in the world owed a lot to her parents. Active in the Christian Science movement, they were also committed to feminist ideas, and in their early years both had been involved in the suffrage movement.<br>
<br>Meg Petrie was educated at the City of London School for Girls, then at the London School of Economics. Initially planning to take a social science certificate, which would have qualified her to be a social worker, she changed to a degree programme on which she studied a range of social science subjects including the nascent discipline of sociology, graduating BSc (Econ) in 1943, with first-class honours. After a brief period of war work, in 1944 she went to Oxford University as a tutor for the extramural delegacy. Her responsibility was to take extramural classes in Oxfordshire and north Buckinghamshire, including the market town of Banbury. This was to prove a decisive move because it led her to undertake a community study, supported by a grant from the Nuffield Foundation, which formed the bedrock of her academic reputation. This work, published in 1960 as <span class="italic">Tradition and Change: a Study of Banbury</span>, came to be seen as one of the high points of British post-war community studies, and a sociological classic.<br>
<br>On 20 May 1945 Meg married Frank Arthur Stacey (1923&#150;1977), a political scientist, and the son of Charles Albert Stacey, a commercial traveller; the couple had five children: Patricia (<i>b</i>. 1948), Richard (<i>b</i>. 1951), Catherine (<i>b</i>. 1952), Peter (<i>b</i>. 1955), and Michael (<i>b</i>. 1958). Their marriage lasted until Frank's death in October 1977. During those years Meg built her own academic career alongside Frank's, not always in the easiest of circumstances. In 1951 Frank Stacey was appointed to an assistant lectureship at the University College of Swansea, and Meg followed him there. Subsequently she came to see the next ten years as wilderness years in her own career. Not that she was inactive in research and writing&#151;far from it&#151;but she never had a secure university position and conducted her work from the academic margins, until finally she was appointed a lecturer at Swansea in 1963. She then turned her attention back to Banbury. She directed a highly talented team for this work and the resulting <span class="italic">Power, Persistence and Change: a Second Study of Banbury</span>, published in 1975, was a major example, without rivals, of tracking social change in a single British community. She also developed a new research interest in the sociology of health and illness, and became one of the pioneers of this sub-discipline within the UK. Beginning with her study of children in hospitals, published in 1970, throughout the remainder of her career she published extensively on illness, health, and healing. She also became involved, at a very senior level, in the governance of health services, including as a member of the Welsh Hospital Board (1970&#150;74) and a lay member of the General Medical Council (1976&#150;84).<br>
<br>In 1974 Stacey was appointed the first woman professor at the University of Warwick. At the same time Frank moved to a chair in local government at Nottingham University. (After his death three years later, Meg Stacey completed his influential book on ombudsmen, published in 1978.) Always a natural leader, once at Warwick Meg Stacey moved progressively into a leadership position in the discipline of sociology within the UK. She had been active in the British Sociological Association as its honorary general secretary in 1968&#150;70 but she assumed an ever more prominent role and became chairperson in 1977&#150;9 and president in 1981&#150;3. She was therefore at the heart of the discipline in times which were very troubled, with sociology under attack from both the media and the government. Her proactive defence of the discipline was epitomized in her presidential address to the British Sociological Association in 1982, which linked it to the parallel task of bringing women to centre stage. Her academic interest in the sociology of gender was another area where she exerted great influence both intellectually and professionally. She left an enduring mark on the position of women in the discipline through her willingness to work actively to secure a better gender balance, including through mentoring and support for younger women colleagues. She always refused to be called an &#145;exceptional woman&#146;, a concept she regarded as a failure of solidarity with other women.<br>
<br>Though never uncritical of the feminist movement&#151;in her later years she came to regard it as deeply ageist&#151;Meg Stacey always acknowledged its impact on her own life, not least on her personal life. Discovering the joy of an intimate relationship with another woman was, she wrote, &#145;a most important and unexpected outcome for me of the Women's Liberation Movement&#146;  (Stacey, &#145;Older women&#146;, 140). She died on 10 February 2004 at Warwick Hospital, from endocarditis, and was buried at Greenhaven Woodland burial-ground, New Clark's Farm, Warwickshire. She was survived by her partner, Jennifer Ann Lorch, and by her five children.<br>
