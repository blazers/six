<span class="headword">Fitzmaurice,  Edmond George  Petty-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice]</span>, Baron Fitzmaurice  (1846&#150;1935), <span class="occ">politician and historian</span>, was born on 19 June 1846 at Lansdowne House, Berkeley Square, London, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22072/', "Henry Thomas Petty-Fitzmaurice, earl of Shelburne, later fourth marquess of Lansdowne (1816&#150;1866)")</script>, and Emily Jane Mercer Elphinstone de Flahault, Lady Nairne (1819&#150;1895), eldest daughter of General Auguste Charles Joseph, comte de Flahault de la Billardrie (1785&#150;1870).<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeeducationintoparliament"></a>Early life; education; into parliament</h2>Edmond Fitzmaurice was educated at home, before moving on to a private school at Woodcote and then to Eton College, from whence he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, as a scholar in 1865. His literary tastes and scholarly aptitude were by then already much in evidence: at Eton he was awarded the prince consort's prize for French, and at Trinity he won the English essay prize before graduating with a first in the classical tripos in 1868. He also captained the Etonian football club and took an active role in the revival of the sport at university level  (<span class="italic">WWW</span>). He earned his first political spurs in 1866, when he succeeded his lifelong friend and political associate Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke, second baronet, as president of the Cambridge Union. In 1871 he was called to the bar, although he never practised.<br>
<br>In 1868, the year of his graduation, Fitzmaurice was returned unopposed at the general election for the family seat of Calne in Wiltshire, where he succeeded Robert Lowe, later Viscount Sherbrooke, whose private secretary he became in 1872. Unlike the anti-reformist Lowe, however, and despite his family's long-time status as one of the pillars of the whig establishment, Fitzmaurice was a leading light, in conjunction with Dilke and Sir William Harcourt, of the &#145;below-the-gangway radicals&#146;. The former was his oldest friend, but Harcourt was his most influential political associate (Fitzmaurice to Sir William Harcourt, 4 Jan 1883, Bodl. Oxf., MSS Harcourt, dep. 212, fol. 3; Fitzmaurice to Lewis Harcourt, 13 June 1906, Bodl. Oxf., MSS Harcourt, dep. 439, fol. 76). Unlike Dilke, he somewhat reluctantly followed Harcourt in supporting Hartington's leadership during Gladstone's &#145;retirement&#146;  (Fitzmaurice to Harcourt, 4 Jan 1875, MSS Harcourt, dep. 206, fols. 1&#150;2). Fitzmaurice's relations with the latter, however, were ambivalent. His amendment to the <span class="roman">University Tests Bill</span> had incurred him the Grand Old Man's displeasure. Fitzmaurice himself held Gladstone and the &#145;theological maggot in his head&#146; responsible for the confusion within the Liberal Party  (ibid.); and generally thought him &#145;a greater tactician than strategist&#146;  (Fitzmaurice to Harcourt, 29 Dec 1898, MSS Harcourt, dep. 239, fols. 181&#150;3). He was dismayed by what he regarded as Gladstone's dictatorial inclinations and his ignorance of the Irish problem  (Fitzmaurice to Vincent, 16 April 1882, D'Abernon MSS, BL, Add. MS 48928, fols. 143&#150;6). Ultimately, however, he remained loyal to his party and its leader during the home rule crisis; and later, in the 1890s, frequently enlisted Gladstone's support in his attempts to be selected as a parliamentary candidate.<h2>
<a name="Thediplomat"></a>The diplomat</h2>With the return of the Liberals to power in 1880 Fitzmaurice's career entered its perhaps most interesting phase. Until the fall of Gladstone's second ministry in 1885 he was involved in Britain's foreign affairs in several capacities. His interest in international diplomacy was perhaps stimulated by his own descent: his father had been parliamentary under-secretary for foreign affairs in 1856&#150;8, a position which he himself would later fill; and his maternal grandfather, the comte de Flahault, the natural son of Talleyrand and <i>aide-de-camp</i> to Napoleon Bonaparte, had served successively as French ambassador at Berlin, Vienna, and finally at London under the July monarchy and Napoleon III. Already in 1878, at the height of the great Eastern crisis, Fitzmaurice had raised the case of Greece in the Commons as a leading member of the Liberals' Greek Committee. Throughout his political career he retained a strong interest in the affairs of the Balkan peninsula. In the summer of 1880 he was Britain's representative on the European commission at Constantinople for the reorganization of the Ottoman provinces in Europe and Crete under the provisions of article 23 of the treaty of Berlin of 1878. In this role he won an accolade as the principal draughtsman of a comprehensive scheme for administrative reform, though ultimately his reform scheme came to nothing because of Sultan Abdul Hamid II's skill in playing off the great powers against each other. Similarly, his proposal for a semi-autonomous greater Albania under Ottoman suzerainty foundered, this time on Russian opposition  (Fitzmaurice to Granville, no. 68, 27 July 1880, and no. 94, 20 Aug 1880, TNA: PRO, FO 97/529).<br>
<br>The various aspects of the Eastern question continued to occupy Fitzmaurice. In 1883 he served, at Lord Granville's invitation, as second British plenipotentiary at the international conference convened at London to settle the complex question of the Danube navigation  (Fitzmaurice to Granville, 31 Jan 1883, Granville MSS, TNA: PRO, PRO 30/29/195). But his skilful negotiations at Constantinople, the breadth of his knowledge of European affairs, and his informed contributions to parliamentary debates had earmarked Fitzmaurice for higher honours. At the beginning of 1883 he succeeded Dilke as parliamentary under-secretary at the Foreign Office, taking particular responsibility for the office's commercial department  (Fitzmaurice to Stead, 10 Dec 1883, Stead MSS, CAC Cam., STED 1/26). In his new role Fitzmaurice earned the respect of his chief, Earl Granville, as well as of the officials with whom he worked. The former rated his abilities so highly that in 1884 he suggested his under-secretary as a strong candidate for the post of ambassador at Constantinople, though, ultimately, the appointment went to a career diplomatist.<br>
<br>But while Fitzmaurice was politically successful, he was now also dogged by recurrent health problems. Continued bouts of neuralgia, the result of an accident in 1875, made him consider resigning in May 1885, although he was persuaded to carry on his duties until the ministry's resignation in the following month  (Fitzmaurice to Granville, 22 and 26 May 1885, Granville MSS, TNA: PRO, PRO 30/29/195). This breakdown came at a most unfortunate juncture in Fitzmaurice's career. In July, despite his illness, he addressed a Liberal meeting at Glasgow, outlining various domestic reform schemes. The speech attracted considerable attention and sharpened his radical profile, and led to his adoption as the Liberal candidate for the Blackfriars division of Glasgow, his old seat at Calne having been abolished under the 1884 <span class="roman">Redistribution Act</span>. But ill health compelled him to withdraw his candidacy, and he retired into private life. He emerged briefly in November 1887 to proclaim his attachment to Irish home rule at a meeting in Old Cumnock, Ayrshire.<h2>
<a name="Withdrawalfromparliamentandreturn"></a>Withdrawal from parliament and return</h2>For thirteen years, between 1885 and 1898, Fitzmaurice remained outside the Westminster fray. In 1887 he was appointed one of the five county boundary commissioners under the <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span>. In light of his family's strong ties with Wiltshire, it was perhaps not surprising that he took an active part in county affairs, serving as chairman of the county council (1896&#150;1906) and of the court of quarter sessions (1899&#150;1905). Throughout this period Fitzmaurice devoted much of his unflagging energy to matters of public education: for fifteen years he was &#145;practically &hellip; Minister of Education&#146; in the county  (Fitzmaurice to J. A. Spender, private letter, 16 Oct 1905, Spender MSS, BL, Add. MS 46389, fol. 146). The town of Bradford-on-Avon, where he resided, also owes him the building of its municipal public baths. On 23 November 1889 he married Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1911), daughter of William John Fitzgerald, of Lichfield, Connecticut, USA. Their marriage was annulled in 1894, and the couple had no children.<br>
<br>Despite the strong interest he took in local and county affairs, Fitzmaurice was none the less anxious to return to national politics. Early in 1892 he put himself forward as a prospective candidate for the Kirkcaldy burghs by-election. His credentials as a home-ruler were impeccable; and through his mother he was related to the grand whig families in Fife and Perthshire. But opposition from &#145;the Scotch gang&#146; led by Edward Marjoribanks, later Lord Tweedmouth, and R. C. Munro-Ferguson, later Viscount Novar, apparently with the support of Lord Rosebery, scuppered his bid to win the nomination  (Fitzmaurice to Gladstone, 29 Feb and 6 March 1892, Gladstone MSS, BL, Add. MS 44514, fols. 73&#150;7 and 108&#150;13). Fitzmaurice unsuccessfully contested Deptford at the 1892 general election, and suffered another defeat in the Cricklade division of Wiltshire at the next general election in 1895. He eventually carried Cricklade at a by-election in 1898 and successfully defended the seat at the &#145;khaki&#146; election of 1900.<br>
<br>Immediately on his return to the Commons Fitzmaurice was invited by his old associate and mentor Harcourt to a place on the opposition front bench  (Fitzmaurice to Harcourt, 18 March 1904, MSS Harcourt, dep. 245, fol. 116). When Harcourt resigned the leadership of a party rent by sectional disputes at the end of 1898, Fitzmaurice threw in his lot with the anti-imperialist or &#145;pro-Boer&#146; section of the Liberals under Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. In the latter's estimate Fitzmaurice was &#145;as straight as a reed in his actions and as sound as a bell in his views&#146;  (Campbell-Bannerman to Herbert Gladstone, private letter, 21 Jan 1900, Campbell-Bannerman MSS, BL, Add. MS 41215, fol. 216). But his support for the new leader exacted a high political price. When the Liberals returned to power in December 1905, Fitzmaurice, to his own bitter disappointment, was passed over for a place in the cabinet: &#145;In my <i>dreams</i> I have seen myself Foreign Secretary. My <i>daylight</i> hopes were by contrast on the Education Office&#146;  (Fitzmaurice to J. A. Spender, 13 Dec 1905, Spender MSS, BL, Add. MS 46489, fol. 146). To some in the party his considerable experience of international diplomacy, his command of foreign languages, and his knowledge of European countries and statesmen singled him out for the Foreign Office. But not only was Fitzmaurice actively opposed by the Liberal Imperialists&#151;and apparently by John Morley&#151;he also lacked a wider following within the parliamentary party (T. R. Buchanan, diary, 1 Dec 1905, Campbell-Bannerman MSS, BL, Add. MS 52520, fol. 83; Fitzmaurice to Pentland, <i>c</i>.January 1919, Campbell-Bannerman MSS, BL, Add. MS 52520, fols. 61&#150;2), a circumstance which was not alleviated by the somewhat idiosyncratic delivery of his speeches in the Commons. The peerage which Campbell-Bannerman offered as a consolation prize he refused with the words of his Cromwellian ancestor Sir William Petty when offered a peerage by Charles II: &#145;A bare <i>title</i> without some <i>trust</i> might seem to the world a Body without soul or spirit&#146;  (Fitzmaurice to Campbell-Bannerman, 12 Dec 1905, Campbell-Bannerman MSS, BL, Add. MS 42214, fol. 201). But he accepted a peerage (conferred on 9 January 1906) after the prime minister also offered him his old post, the parliamentary under-secretaryship for foreign affairs, under the Liberal Imperialist Sir Edward Grey, in order that the Foreign Office was represented in the upper house.<h2>
<a name="TheForeignOffice"></a>The Foreign Office</h2>During his second spell at the Foreign Office Fitzmaurice was a largely isolated and impotent figure. He had little influence over Grey and his impact on policy decisions was limited: his views and recommendations &#145;reflected an earlier era in British foreign policy&#146;  (Steiner, 108): the 1880s, when he had last been at the Foreign Office, a fact of which he himself was not entirely unaware  (Fitzmaurice to Dilke, confidential, 16 Dec 1905, Dilke MSS, BL Add. MS 43882, fols. 140&#150;42). He remained highly suspicious of Russian diplomacy, and inclined towards closer ties with Germany (for example Fitzmaurice to Vincent, 16 Nov 1882, D'Abernon MSS, BL, Add. MS 48928, fols. 147&#150;50; memo., Fitzmaurice, April 1907, <span class="italic">British Documents on the Origins of the War</span>, ed. G. P. Gooch and H. W. V. Temperley, 8 vols., 1928, no. 400). Although by no means blind to German machinations after 1905, he was none the less appalled by the apparent anti-German line of the Foreign Office under Grey (Fitzmaurice to Ripon, 18 April 1906, Ripon MSS, BL, Add. MS 43543, fols. 9&#150;10; Fitzmaurice to Lascelles, 31 May 1906, and confidential, 21 Sept 1906, Lascelles MSS, TNA: PRO, FO 800/13). In consequence, he was critical of Grey's talks with Cambon in 1906, to which he was not party, but of which he was informed and, indeed, the contents of which he leaked to the lord chancellor, Lord Loreburn, thereby stirring dissension within the cabinet (Fitzmaurice to Spender, 21 March 1923, Spender MSS, BL, Add. MS 46389, fols. 200&#150;03; to Pentland, <i>c</i>. January 1919, Campbell-Bannerman MSS, BL, Add. MS 52520, fols. 61&#150;2). His closest ally at the time was the lord privy seal, the marquess of Ripon, through whom he obtained some degree of influence.<br>
<br>It was, however, not only the government's foreign policy with which Fitzmaurice was out of sympathy. With the change of premier from Campbell-Bannerman to Asquith he also found himself at odds with what he regarded as the Liberals' aimless drift in domestic politics  (Fitzmaurice to J. A. Spender, confidential, 10 Dec 1908, Spender MSS, BL, Add. MS 46389, fol. 107 ff.). Asquith's ascendancy created an ambiguous situation for Fitzmaurice: unlike his predecessor, the new prime minister was certainly not favourably inclined towards him; and Ripon's resignation in October 1908 only heightened his isolation  (Fitzmaurice to Ripon, 10 Oct 1908, Ripon MSS, BL, Add. MS 43543, fols. 76&#150;7). On the other hand, it was Asquith who at last raised Fitzmaurice to cabinet rank as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, and who made him a privy councillor. Fitzmaurice retained responsibility for representing the Foreign Office in the House of Lords, though his influence on foreign policy decision making was by this time minimal. His occupancy of a place at the cabinet table, however, was short-lived. Crippled by arthritis, which led to the progressive paralysis of his lower limbs, he was compelled to resign in June 1909. A faithful servant of his party to the very end of his public career, Fitzmaurice was anxious to dispel rumours that his resignation was caused by a rift with Asquith or misgivings over Lloyd George's controversial &#145;People's Budget&#146;  (Fitzmaurice to J. A. Spender, 19 June 1909, Spender MSS, BL, Add. MS 46389, fols. 171&#150;3).<br>
<br>Fitzmaurice never attained a high public profile, and he was perhaps best known to the wider public as a historian. In this field, his three-volume <span class="italic">Life</span> of his ancestor William, earl of Shelburne (1875&#150;6) established his reputation. In 1881 he was offered, but declined, the editorship of the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>  (Fitzmaurice to E. Vincent, 7 Dec 1881, D'Abernon MSS, BL, Add. MS 48928, fols. 139&#150;41). Throughout the period of opposition and exclusion Fitzmaurice was a regular contributor to the <span class="italic">Contemporary</span> and <span class="italic">Quarterly</span> reviews. Shortly before his return to national politics he chose another of his ancestors as the subject for another literary work, the <span class="italic">Life of Sir William Petty</span> (1895). In 1901 he published a small monograph on Charles William Ferdinand, duke of Brunswick, who led the Prussian army during the wars against revolutionary France. Perhaps his best work, however, was the official biography of his old chief at the Foreign Office, Earl Granville (2 vols., 1905), which, nearly a century later, remains the only comprehensive work on this Victorian statesman. His historical works earned Fitzmaurice election as a fellow of the British Academy in 1914 and an honorary DLitt from Bristol University in 1912. From 1881 to 1915 he was a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery. Fitzmaurice died at his home, Leigh House, in Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, on 21 June 1935.<br>
