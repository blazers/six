<span class="headword">Wallace,  William</span>  (1843&#150;1897), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was born at Railway Place, Cupar, Fife, on 11 May 1843, the son of James Cooper Wallace, builder, and his wife, Jane (Jean), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kelloch, both persons of considerable originality and force of character. After attending Madras Academy in Cupar and spending four years at the University of St Andrews, and electing not to pursue theological studies as his parents had hoped, Wallace gained an exhibition at Balliol College, Oxford, in 1864, and in 1867 became fellow of Merton College. He graduated BA in 1868 and proceeded MA in 1871. In 1868 he was appointed a tutor of Merton, and in 1871 he became its librarian. In 1872 he married Janet Barclay, whom he had known from his childhood; a daughter and two sons were born to them. His brother Edwin Wallace, author of <span class="italic">Outlines of the Philosophy of Aristotle</span> (1883), was vice-provost of Worcester College from 1881 to his death in 1884. In 1882 Wallace succeeded T. H. Greene as Whyte professor of moral philosophy, and he held that office, along with the Merton tutorship, until his death fifteen years later.<br>
<br>As a professor, Wallace had a great influence upon many generations of students of philosophy at Oxford. In his lectures he aimed not so much at the detailed exposition of philosophical systems as at encouraging students to think critically. He lectured without notes, and seemed to develop his subject as he spoke. His humorous, elegant, and yet earnest lectures produced a unique impression of insight and sincerity.<br>
<br>Wallace's writings are almost all devoted to the exposition of German philosophy, particularly the philosophy of Hegel. In 1873 he published <span class="italic">The Logic of Hegel</span>, translated from the work known as the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences</span>. The first full English translation entitled this work Wallace's <span class="italic">Logic</span> and was a free and creative rendition, accompanied by notes explicating difficult parts of the text. Wallace drew parallels between classical philosophy and contemporary German and British thinkers, connecting, for example, Hegel's Idea and the Idea of Plato and Aristotle; he also highlighted the links between Hegelianism and Christianity. Reissued a little more than one hundred years after its first publication, it was still deemed &#145;the most masterly and influential of all English translations of Hegel&#146;  (Findlay, v). Such idiosyncratic, often amusing, notes as &#145;the Absolute Idea may be compared to the old man who utters the same creed as a child, but for whom it is pregnant with the significance of a lifetime&#146;  (ibid., v) contributed to the distinctiveness of Wallace's translation. Well read in both classical and modern literature, Wallace was particularly successful in freeing philosophical conceptions from technical terms and reclothing them in language of much literary force and beauty. In 1892 he produced a second edition of <span class="italic">The Logic of Hegel</span>, which was reissued the following year with the addition of a long analytical introduction. His work on Hegel culminated in his translation entitled <span class="italic">The Philosophy of Mind</span> (1894), which was also republished almost a century after its first publication. Regarding Hegel as fundamentally a German philosopher whose thought was alien to a British audience, Wallace's introduction and notes accentuated those elements of the texts which resonated with British readers, especially with fellow idealists [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/98159', "British idealists")</script>]. Accordingly, he treated the dialectic fleetingly but fully discussed themes of unity and community in Hegel.<br>
<br>In addition to his monumental translations of Hegel, Wallace's brief biographical account of Kant (1882), which depicted Kant as engaged in a dialogue with Locke and Hume, added to the growing Kantian scholarship by J. H. Stirling, Edward Caird, John Watson, and others. In his spirited and forceful biography of Schopenhauer, published in 1890, Wallace traced the alternating depth and shallowness of the philosopher's repudiation of empiricism and materialism, complaining of his &#145;unconquerable vanity&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Life of Arthur Schopenhauer</span>, 112) but praising his insight into the power of art and his belief that the best life is one predicated on the underlying unity of all experience. He read widely and travelled to various parts of Germany to acquaint himself with the geographical and cultural environment. Wallace's Gifford lectures on the history of natural theology, delivered at the University of Glasgow in 1892, were posthumously published in a collection of essays and lectures edited by Edward Caird.<br>
<br>Wallace was a keen botanist, cyclist, and mountaineer whose rather abrupt manner concealed a generous and affectionate nature. His knowledge of Kant, Fichte, Herder, and Hegel was exceptional and his contribution towards the reception of German thought in Britain singular. Wallace died at the Rock of Gibraltar inn, Bletchington, near Oxford, on 19 February 1897, the day after a bicycling accident from which he never fully recovered consciousness. He was buried at Holywell cemetery, Oxford, on 22 February.<br>
