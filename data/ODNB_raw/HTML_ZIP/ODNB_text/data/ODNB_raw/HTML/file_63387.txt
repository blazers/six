<span class="headword">Wilkie <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Wilke]</span>,  Dorette</span>  (1867&#150;1930), <span class="occ">promoter of women's physical education</span>, was born at Stendal, Magdeburg, Prussia, on 14 June 1867, the daughter of Friedrich Wilke, a cork merchant who was a Polish refugee in Germany, and his wife, Dorothea. She came to England in 1885, a penniless, delicate, sensitive, receptive teenager suffering from lateral curvature of the spine. A cure was effected through gymnastics and she enrolled at the fashionable training school of Adolf A. Stempel's gymnasium in London, where she received two years' free training in physical education in return for one year's unsalaried teaching at Stempel's and its schools. She later said: &#145;I am so grateful &hellip; for what gymnastics have done for me, that I want to make them a means of doing good to as many people as possible&#146; (<i>c</i>.1899, cited in Webb, <span class="italic">Challenge of Change</span>, 13). In 1888 she became an assistant to the Misses Evelyn and Beatrice Bear at Queen Alexandra House gymnasium, and in 1891 was appointed to the staff of Battersea Polytechnic.<br>
<br>In 1896, taking three students from Battersea, Wilke joined the staff of the South Western Polytechnic, Chelsea, where she had the opportunity to realize her ambition of establishing and running her own physical training college to train gymnastic and games teachers to teach in girls' schools. What later became the Chelsea College of Physical Education opened in September 1898 as the gymnastic teachers' training department of the South Western Polytechnic's day training college for women  (Webb, <span class="italic">Challenge of Change</span>, 9&#150;10). Wilke was its first headmistress, and she held the position for thirty-one years. As she said, early in her tenure, &#145;we are engaged &hellip; in the work of teaching the teachers for, unless the teacher has herself been taught, how can she teach others?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily News</span>, 8 Dec 1903).<br>
<br>The earliest students at Chelsea followed a two-year college diploma course, and were also eligible to gain certificates awarded by external bodies such as the British College of Physical Education and the Gymnastic Teachers' Institute. The first course of training cost 72 guineas, plus library and games subscriptions, examination fees, books, uniform, equipment, and travel expenses. Initially, no defined educational entrance standard was set, but Wilke insisted, &#145;My students must have brains; a healthy active body is not enough&#146;. Scientific subjects&#151;physiology, anatomy, and psychology&#151;were added to the course of study, which had three main strands: practical studies, theoretical studies, and teaching practice. Always keen to keep in the forefront of knowledge and extend her experience, she became, in 1907, an examiner in physical training under the London county council. In 1909 she extended the course at Chelsea to three years &#145;in order to bring the training up to the standard of a University education&#146;  (Webb, &#145;Chelsea College of Physical Education&#146;, 116). The aim of the third year of study was the application of knowledge gained in the first two years to degree standard, as reflected in the following components: extension of teaching experience, theoretical and practical; remedial work; a one-year course in psychology; introduction to the principles of teaching; and research in the laboratories of the polytechnic. She encouraged students' cultural education by the establishment of many student societies.<br>
<br>During Wilke's period as headmistress, the Chelsea college grew from five to more than a hundred students. Those who had passed through the course went on to hold positions in girls' schools and training colleges throughout Britain and around the world. She encouraged the extension of their knowledge and experience, and was proud of the formation of the Chelsea Old Students' Association on 28 May 1904. She set high standards for staff and students in behaviour and dress. The college uniform changed periodically, as fashions changed, but essentially the colours of the earl of Cadogan, blue, white and red, were retained. When the college opened, facilities were limited: the gymnasium was shared with the men's and boys' classes and public facilities were used for swimming. Students cycled to and from the games fields. Local students lived at home, while a few others lived in a boarding house attached to the college. In 1905 a pioneer hostel, Cadogan Lodge, was opened at 11 Carlyle Square for fourteen to twenty resident students under the supervision of a female warden.<br>
<br>From 1907 Wilke developed a close association with Cecil Sharp, who in 1909 established a school of morris dancing in association with the college. She was co-opted onto the provisional committee of the English Folk Dance Society in December 1911 and encouraged Sharp to experiment and test with the students any dance which he collected. A team of second-year students often accompanied him on his tours of Great Britain to demonstrate his latest findings.<br>
<br>On 1 May 1908 Wilke was naturalized as a British subject, a status which she believed would make it easier for her to carry out her duties as an examiner. Thereafter she refused to be called Fr&auml;ulein and was universally known as Domina. At the same time her surname was changed by deed poll from Wilke to Wilkie. She lived in Chelsea until her retirement in 1929. After a painful illness she died of breast cancer on 19 January 1930 at Domina's Cottage, Barley Mow Hill, Headley, near Bordon, Hampshire, which she had purchased in 1914 for her retirement and holidays, and where she had entertained staff and third-year students. She was buried in Headley churchyard. She never married.<br>
<br>Domina's unconventional, dynamic, colourful personality, exemplified in her dress (a red working tunic), and the ever-present sense of service to the community through teaching and voluntary work, influenced her thinking and actions. In 1902 she instituted Saturday games in Battersea Park for deprived children, and Chelsea students taught at London working girls' clubs. She was often outspoken, but her experimental scientific, analytical, and pioneering work at Chelsea resulted in a lasting legacy to British physical education. Vital and lively, with a sense of fun, she encouraged individuality in her students. Her vision for physical education was marked by her courage in overcoming difficulties. One of the early pioneers to provide a &#145;new&#146; profession for women, she was a spontaneous and enduring inspiration to those with whom she came into contact.<br>
