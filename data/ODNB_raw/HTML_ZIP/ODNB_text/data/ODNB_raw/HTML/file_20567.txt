<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Offa</span>  (<em>d.</em> 796), <span class="occ">king of the Mercians</span>, rose to power during the brief period of civil war which followed the murder of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8900/', "King &#198;thelbald")</script> in 757. Offa was the son of Thingfrith, the son of Eanwulf; and Eanwulf was first cousin to &AElig;thelbald: both the great Mercian kings of the eighth century were direct descendants of Eowa, brother and perhaps co-ruler of the celebrated seventh-century King Penda.<h2>
<a name="Origins"></a>Origins</h2>Several records in the Worcester archive associate Offa and his grandfather Eanwulf with the kingdom of the Hwicce and in particular with the minster at Bredon in modern Worcestershire, which was supposedly founded by Eanwulf in 716 or 717  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 55, 116, 117, 146, 147). As they stand these documents would seem to be forgeries, but collectively they may preserve a valid tradition. It has been suggested that Eanwulf may have had some family connection with the royal dynasty of the Hwicce, perhaps through marriage, though there is no direct evidence. One of the suspect Worcester charters has an intriguing subscription of Offa, who confidently attests as &#145;noble youth [<i>puer indolis</i>, perhaps equivalent to atheling] in the province of the Hwicce, not yet having received from God the kingdom of the Mercians&#146;  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 55). This is evidently retrospective, but does reveal at least a very early tradition that Offa grew up among the Hwicce. Since he went on to reign for almost forty years, he is likely to have been a young man in 757. He was probably named from Offa, king of Angeln, one of the legendary ancestors of the Mercian royal dynasty. His heroic descent is emphasized in a collection of royal genealogies which would appear to have been compiled during his reign (although probably in Northumbria rather than Mercia).<h2>
<a name="DominationoversouthernEngland"></a>Domination over southern England</h2>Offa became ruler in Mercia in 757 after driving out a certain Beornred, who had taken over the kingdom in the aftermath of &AElig;thelbald's death. The ascendancy over southern England which &AElig;thelbald had enjoyed in the last decades of his reign is likely to have been dissipated or at least reduced by the period of civil war in Mercia. But Offa contrived by military prowess and political astuteness to equal and then exceed his predecessor's power and reputation. By the end of his reign he was the dominant ruler in England and a force to be reckoned with on the European stage, treated as a (near) equal by Charlemagne. His ambitions were huge, and he struggled hard to establish a long-lasting dynasty; but the early death of his son and successor brought ultimate, posthumous failure.<br>
<br>In Offa's hands the old patterns of Anglo-Saxon overlordship began to change. Earlier kings who had dominated southern England, including &AElig;thelbald, seem to have been for the most part content to exercise their authority in an indirect fashion, interfering relatively lightly in the internal affairs of subordinate kingdoms. During the 770s Offa began to operate on a different level, which involved removing (or at least demoting) local kings and absorbing their territories into a Mercian empire. The first to have experienced this new policy were the South Saxons, then ruled by a multiplicity of minor kings. Offa conquered the people of the Hastings area in 771 and the kings of the South Saxons seem rapidly to have capitulated. A charter issued by Offa in 772 was witnessed by four South Saxons, at least three of whom had formerly ruled as kings in Sussex: they are now called <i>dux</i> or ealdorman, which indicates that they had been demoted below royal status  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 108). From now on their role was to govern Sussex in Offa's name, as his appointees. Something similar seems to have happened in the kingdom of the Hwicce, in the west midlands, long dominated by Mercia. In 757 the Hwicce were ruled by three brothers, members of the established local dynasty. Charters show them operating only with Offa's permission and licence: they are called <i>regulus</i> (&#145;kinglet&#146;) or even <i>subregulus</i> (&#145;sub-kinglet&#146;), and by 777 one of them is referred to as <i>dux</i>. After <i>c</i>.780 there is no sign of an independent local dynasty of the Hwicce: the territory is ruled directly by Offa. About the other midland and Middle Anglian tribes whose territories collectively made up the kingdom of Greater Mercia, almost nothing is known; but it seems likely that any other surviving native dynasties were treated by Offa like the Hwiccean rulers. Offa seems to have been set on ambitiously extending the territory which he ruled directly, eschewing reliance on sub-kings with some pretence to royal dignity.<br>
<br>The kingdoms of Sussex and the Hwicce were relatively small fry, but the wealthy kingdom of Kent was another matter. Offa took advantage of the turmoil which followed the death of King &AElig;thelberht II in 762, and by 764 he was in a position to dispose directly of an estate in Kent, with merely the meek consent of a local ruler  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 105). The situation seems to have changed in 776, when the Mercians and men of Kent met in battle at Otford in West Kent. The notice of the clash in the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> frustratingly fails to mention the outcome. Later medieval historians assumed that Offa had triumphed, and produced circumstantial accounts of his victory; modern historians generally side with the view that this may have been a Mercian defeat, followed by a brief period of Kentish independence under King Ecgberht II. The circumstances leading up to the battle will never be known, but the fact that the clash took place in the west of Kent does suggest that Offa's forces were invading the kingdom, perhaps with the aim of ousting local rulers and imposing direct Mercian rule. This was certainly the ultimate result of Offa's pressure on Kent. The last known charter issued by a Kentish king in his own right is dated 784 (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 38; the date may not be reliable); after this there is no trace of any local rulers, and Offa was in sole charge by 785. Thereafter Kent was entirely subject to Mercia until it was conquered by Ecgberht of Wessex in the ninth century, apart from a brief period of revolt which broke out on Offa's death. The leader of the revolt was &#145;King&#146; Eadberht Pr&aelig;n, a former priest who may have been a member of the native dynasty. He is probably the man of the same name who was given protection by Charlemagne, along with other exiles who feared death at Offa's hands.<br>
<br>It is difficult to make any confident pronouncements about Offa's relations with the other kingdoms of southern England. About the East Saxons there is little information: they still had their own kings in the ninth century, which would seem to show that Offa did not treat their territory as he did Kent, Sussex, and the west midlands (although it is possible that there was a hiatus and a restoration after Offa's death). The one concrete detail about the large and obscure kingdom of East Anglia is that in 794 Offa had the East Anglian king &AElig;thelberht beheaded, apparently while he was attending the Mercian court. Hagiographical sources connected with &AElig;thelberht (who was later venerated as a martyr) lay the blame on Offa's wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54442/', "Cynethryth (fl. c.770&#150;798)")</script>, but it seems likely that Offa had political reasons for ordering the execution. A little light is thrown on East Anglian affairs by the activities of the kingdom's moneyers in the second half of the eighth century: some struck coins for Offa, some for the local kings Beonna, &AElig;thelberht, and Eadwald. At the least this shows that Offa exercised some kind of influence over East Anglia.<br>
<br>Debate has raged over whether Offa was able to claim any degree of overlordship over the relatively powerful kingdom of Wessex. King Cynewulf (<i>r</i>. 757&#150;86) seems to have operated fairly independently, although Offa was able to use his superior military muscle to seize control of disputed territory in the upper Thames valley (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 779; <span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1258). Cynewulf's successor, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2180/', "Beorhtric (or Brihtric)")</script>, may have been more vulnerable. He married Offa's daughter Eadburh and co-operated with him in the expulsion of Ecgberht, the future West Saxon king, in 789; whether this operation most benefited Beorhtric or Offa it is difficult to say. Some hint of subservience is betrayed in the three surviving charters of Beorhtric, where the royal styles are curiously humble and tentative  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 267&#150;9); in one instance he is &#145;king of this province&#146;, which contrasts noticeably with the forthright title &#145;King of the [West] Saxons&#146; usually applied to his predecessors and successors. It seems very likely that Offa dominated his son-in-law.<br>
<br>In 792 Offa married another daughter, &AElig;lffl&aelig;d, to the Northumbrian king <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59595/', "&#198;thelred I")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20928/', "Oswulf")</script>]. &AElig;thelred had had a tempestuous reign (and was to be murdered in 796) and the alliance may have been arranged in order to ensure Offa's support; it seems unlikely that the Mercian would not have made capital from the situation. Northumbria had been politically unstable for decades, and there is a possibility that Offa may have interfered on earlier occasions. Whether he did harbour ambitions to be recognized as the pre-eminent overlord of northern England as well as the south is incapable of proof. Some significance has been seen in the fact that in a small number of Offa's diplomas he is styled <i>rex Anglorum</i>, &#145;king of the English&#146;; in one, from 774, he is even <i>rex totius Anglorum patriae</i>, &#145;king of the whole fatherland of the English&#146;  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 111). It is a problem that none of the charters with this extravagant style survives in its contemporary state; all of them are later copies, and many of them are suspicious or downright fraudulent. In surviving contemporary documents, Offa is invariably simply <i>rex Merciorum</i>, &#145;king of the Mercians&#146;. So perhaps the identification of Offa as <i>rex Anglorum</i> owes more to his great reputation among later generations than to his own ambitions. Nevertheless, the more impressive royal style does occur in diplomas from several archives, and there is clearly a possibility that it was used by Offa in certain circumstances. It is interesting to note that Offa would seem to have owned a manuscript of Bede's <span class="italic">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</span>; he may have been inspired by the careers of the Northumbrian kings Eadwine, Oswald, and Oswiu, who had authority over both north and south, to aspire to a more considerable status over all the English kingdoms.<h2>
<a name="OffasDyke"></a>Offa's Dyke</h2>Offa owes much of his posthumous fame to a single monument: Offa's Dyke, a military earthwork on a huge scale, originally running from the north coast of Wales to the mouth of the Wye. No doubt the dyke was intended to counter insurgent raids from the Welsh, and it may also have played a part in the devastating onslaughts which Offa is known to have inflicted on the Welsh kingdoms in 778 and 784. Its military function is still much debated, and it is possible that its importance lay as much in its symbolic value as a demonstration of Offa's power: perhaps it is no coincidence that one of the remembered achievements of his heroic namesake, Offa of Angeln, was to have established a boundary between his own people and their neighbours. Huge resources of labour and capital must have been needed to complete Offa's Dyke, as well as sophisticated organization. Evidence about eighth-century royal administration is for the most part lacking. Offa's agents must have been able to make use of great quantities of tribute from conquered and subordinate kingdoms, and there is reason to think that the king's revenues were extended by the confiscation of estates previously controlled by ousted kings. In addition, Offa could make use of a system of military obligations set up in Mercia by his predecessor &AElig;thelbald, according to which landowners were supposed to make provision for building and repairing bridges and fortifications, and to participate in military activity or arrange for substitutes to stand in for them. Some manipulation of these obligations may have helped build the dyke. Offa is known to have extended these military conditions to Kent in 792  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 134), and probably did the same in other subordinate kingdoms. Controlling resources of this kind would have enabled him to counter the threat of viking raiders, who were already appearing on the coasts at the end of his reign; at the same time they would have reinforced his military presence in subjugated kingdoms. It is unclear whether Offa's rule of the conquered provinces also involved the imposition of other Mercian laws. King Alfred refers to a law code of Offa as one of the sources for his own legal compilation. This has not survived, and modern scholars disagree on its nature; possibly it was merely Offa's endorsement of a body of ecclesiastical legislation, rather than a full secular code.<h2>
<a name="RelationswithCharlemagne"></a>Relations with Charlemagne</h2>Offa also seems to have exercised a level of control over the ports of southern England, which would have been the main conduits of luxury and overseas trade. The great emporium at London had been a Mercian monopoly since the earlier eighth century, and the important trading settlements in Kent fell into his hands in the 780s. His domination over English trade was such that he could use a total embargo on foreign merchants as a political tool. About 790 Alcuin referred in a letter to a dispute between the Frankish king Charlemagne and Offa which had led both kings to prohibit the passage of merchant ships. Possibly this is the same episode referred to in a ninth-century Frankish source, according to which the quarrel arose from failed marriage negotiations. A match was being arranged between Offa's daughter and Charlemagne's son; but Offa complicated matters by demanding a reciprocal match between his son, <a href="#cosubject_52312">Ecgfrith [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and one of Charlemagne's daughters. There would have been serious questions of status involved here: by attempting to make the alliances exactly equal, the Mercian king was probably intent on ensuring that he stood on an equal footing with Charlemagne, and was not left open to pressure by the presence of a hostage daughter in the other's court. In a spectacular tantrum, Charlemagne barred all English merchants from his realm; Offa responded in kind. Relations had been patched up by 796, by which time the two kings were in correspondence on commercial matters. In response to a letter of Offa (which has not survived), Charlemagne wrote with guarantees for the safety and privileges of English merchants and pilgrims in his realm. He promised to make sure that Offa received some mysterious &#145;black stones&#146; which he had requested, and in return asked that Offa do something about the length of the cloaks being sent from England. The commercial links between the two kingdoms are underlined by an increase in the weight of Offa's penny coinage in the 790s, which brought it into line with coins issued by Charlemagne.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsanddeath"></a>Last years and death</h2>The last decade of Offa's reign was triumphant. In 787 he manoeuvred to ensure the succession of his son, <a name="cosubject_52312"></a><span class="headword">Ecgfrith</span>  (<em>d.</em> 796), by having the young man consecrated <span class="occ">king</span>. It is impossible to discover exactly what this involved, and whether it reflected a formal royal anointing or a less significant blessing, but it does seem very likely that Offa found inspiration in Charlemagne's arrangements to have his sons consecrated by the pope in 781. By associating Ecgfrith with himself in the kingship, Offa was asserting his legitimacy and paving the way for an undisputed succession. (He also seems to have used more reprehensible methods, for Alcuin mutters sadly about the blood which he shed to secure the kingdom for his son.) The other significant event of 787 was the division of the Canterbury province to create a second archbishopric in southern England, with the archbishop's seat at Lichfield, in the heartland of Mercia. This needed papal permission, and is probably to be connected with a fact-finding papal embassy sent from Rome to England in the previous year. There were good practical reasons for dividing the ancient southern province, which was one of the largest in Europe. But there may also have been a personal motive, for Offa is said to have been on very bad terms with the current archbishop of Canterbury, J&aelig;nberht. The synod in 787 called to authorize the elevation of Lichfield was contentious, but Offa had his way, and obtained the services of a compliant archbishop in his own territory. Modern historians have been tempted to link this episode with Ecgfrith's consecration, and to see J&aelig;nberht's humiliation as the consequence of his refusal to co-operate with Offa's plans for his son. A connection has also been made with a letter of Pope Hadrian to Charlemagne (undated, but written between 784 and 791), which shows that the pope had been unsettled by rumours that Offa was conspiring with the Frankish king to oust him and replace him with a Frankish candidate; it has been suggested that these reports were spread by J&aelig;nberht's party, with a view to discrediting Offa. Clearly there was considerable diplomatic activity between Rome and England at this time, although it is unclear whether the most important bone of contention was the consecration of Ecgfrith or the division of the Canterbury diocese (which could be seen as a legitimate reform). The sources for the episode are deeply hostile to Offa and ascribe his actions to personal antagonisms; yet he must have had a serious practical case for persuading the pope to agree to the elevation of Lichfield into an archbishopric.<br>
<br>Offa's wife, Queen Cynethryth, enjoyed an exalted status; her husband had coins struck in her name, and she witnessed his land charters on a regular basis from <i>c</i>.770. The marriage probably did not take place much before this date, since their children do not seem to have reached marriageable age until the late 780s and 790s. Ecgfrith is the only known son, but there were at least three daughters: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8380/', "Eadburh")</script>, who married Beorhtric of Wessex; &AElig;lffl&aelig;d, who married &AElig;thelred of Northumbria; and &AElig;thelburh, an abbess who corresponded with Alcuin. The identification of &AElig;thelburh with a namesake who was abbess of Fladbury Minster, in what is now Worcestershire, seems to be incorrect. During his career Offa founded many religious houses and gained control over others through conquest and other means. From Pope Hadrian he acquired a privilege guaranteeing the rights of his wife and offspring over these minsters. Cynethryth became abbess of Cookham when she was widowed, and controlled at least one other minster; &AElig;thelburh was no doubt abbess of another family house.<br>
<br>Offa died on 29 July 796, and Ecgfrith inherited the kingdom (the first time that a son had succeeded his father in Mercia for many generations). But he was dead before the end of the year and the kingship passed to Cenwulf, a very distant relative; it may be that Offa had made away with all nearer claimants. It was later claimed at St Albans Abbey that plans for Offa's burial there were thwarted by Ecgfrith, and that he was actually laid to rest in a chapel near Bedford on the River Ouse, his body later being lost. The minster at St Albans was reputedly founded and endowed by Offa after he miraculously discovered the remains of the eponymous Romano-British martyr, an episode which naturally provoked considerable interest in the Mercian king's career among later historiographers at the abbey. One of the products generated from this was <span class="italic">Vita duorum Offarum</span>, probably written by Matthew Paris <i>c</i>.1250, which enthusiastically invents parallels between the life of the Mercian king and that of his heroic namesake. Matthew and other St Albans historians who wrote on Offa, notably Roger of Wendover, may have had access to a tract on Offa which may have included some genuine details about his life and his relations with St Albans; but it is tedious and ultimately unrewarding to attempt to extract any worthwhile information from the essentially legendary material presented in the thirteenth-century sources. Offa's actual burial place is unknown.<br>
