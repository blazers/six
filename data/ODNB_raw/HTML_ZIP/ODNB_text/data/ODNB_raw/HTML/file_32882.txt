<span class="headword">Dowden,  Edward</span>  (1843&#150;1913), <span class="occ">literary scholar and poet</span>, was born on 3 May 1843 at Cork, the second son of John Wheeler Dowden (1799&#150;1891), linen merchant and landowner, and his wife, Alicia Bennett (<i>d</i>. 1869). His elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32883/', "John Dowden (1840&#150;1910)")</script>, became bishop of Edinburgh in 1886. There were two sisters, Margaret and Anna. Edward was educated at home and at Queen's College, Cork, from 1858, before being admitted in 1859 to Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated in 1863. On 23 October 1866 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1892), daughter of David Clerke; they had four children, a son and two daughters, and a fourth child who died before 1914. Also in 1866 he became professor of English at Alexandra College, Dublin, a post he resigned in July 1867. The same year he was appointed to the newly founded chair of English literature in Trinity College.<br>
<br>At Trinity College, Dublin, in 1873 Dowden prepared a number of lectures entitled &#145;The mind and art of Shakespere&#146;, lectures that were, eventually, the materials for what was to be his most influential work, <span class="italic">Shakespere: a Critical Study of his Mind and Art</span> (1876). The book went through a number of editions and was translated into a number of languages. Dowden's view of Shakespeare's philosophy was coloured by his study of the positivism of Auguste Comte. There followed a spate of books, biographies, editions, and articles, prominent among which were a <span class="italic">Shakespere Primer</span> (1877), <span class="italic">Studies in Literature</span> (1878), and <span class="italic">New Studies in Literature</span> (1895). Short biographies of Southey, Browning, and Montaigne were crowned by his most extensive work, the biography of Shelley (2 vols.) on which he laboured from 1883 to its publication in 1886. In the biography of Shelley Dowden was faced with the problem of the poet's marriage to Harriet Westbrook and its unsavoury aftermath. Harriet, estranged from Shelley, drowned herself in the Serpentine on 13 December 1816. Dowden wrote of her:<blockquote>There is no doubt that she wandered from the ways of upright living; how far she wandered we need not inquire. If she sinned, she also sorrowed; we would think of her, not as a desperate fugitive from life, but as the fair, bright, innocent, kind-hearted Harriet of her early wedded days. That no act of Shelley's during the two years which immediately preceded her death tended to cause the rash act which brought her life to its close, seems certain. (E. Dowden, <span class="italic">The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 1950, 332&#150;3)</blockquote>The biography was both damned and praised. Dowden was an early admirer of Whitman's poetry and devoted one chapter of his <span class="italic">Studies in Literature</span> to &#145;The poetry of democracy&#146; in which he discussed Whitman's poetry extensively.<br>
<br>On 12 December 1895 Dowden married Elizabeth Dickinson West, daughter of John West, dean of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. She was a minor poet and translator, a student of his at Alexandra College, with whom he corresponded throughout his first, unsatisfactory, marriage. For her he wrote a little volume of poems, <span class="italic">A Woman's Reliquary</span>, published posthumously in 1913. There were no children of this marriage.<br>
<br>Dowden was an opponent of a national Anglo-Irish literature as well as an outspoken opponent of home rule. In the introduction to his <span class="italic">New Studies in Literature</span> (1895) Dowden disclaimed any desire to be thought of as an Irish writer, stating &#145;I confess that I am not ambitious of intensifying my intellectual or spiritual brogue&#146;  (p. 19), with more in the same vein. He was not, understandably, popular with, among others, W. B. Yeats. Dowden had praised the young Yeats, son of his friend, J. B. Yeats, on the publication of the younger Yeats's &#145;The Wandering of Oisin&#146;, when such praise was very welcome. Indeed, the younger Yeats later admitted to having virtually worshipped Dowden. But Dowden's lack of sympathy for Anglo-Irish literature alienated Yeats, and in an article, &#145;The poetry of Samuel Ferguson&#146;, in the <span class="italic">Dublin University Review</span> for November 1886, he wrote:<blockquote>It is a question whether the most distinguished of our critics, Professor Dowden, would not only have more consulted the interests of his country, but more also, in the long run, his own dignity and reputation which are dear to all Irishmen, if he had devoted some of those elaborate pages which he has spent on the much bewritten George Eliot, to a man like the subject of this article. (Yeats, <span class="italic">Prose</span>, 89)</blockquote>In his <span class="italic">Autobiographies: Reveries over Childhood</span> (1915), Yeats devoted sections 24 and 25 to his recollections of Dowden, in which he records his final damning estimation of him. In his essay &#145;At Stratford-on-Avon&#146;, of May 1901, Yeats wrote that he had read Dowden's <span class="italic">Shakespere &hellip; his Mind and Art</span> diligently and went on to disagree radically with his characterization of Richard II in Shakespeare's play. But the two did not become enemies, and Dowden writes in a letter of 14 April 1907 of a visit by Yeats, of whom he says that he &#145;comes and goes and is always intelligent and interesting&#151;but after all, wisdom is better than folly, and he ought to be attending to his higher sense&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 351). Dowden died on 4 April 1913 at Rochdale, Orwell Road, Rathgar, Dublin. In 1893&#150;5 he delivered the Clark lectures at Cambridge and gave the Taylorian lectures at Oxford in 1899. With the exception of these engagements and visits to the United States and Canada, he had spent his entire life in that city.<br>
