<span class="headword">Villettes,  William Anne</span>  (1754&#150;1808), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born at Bern, Switzerland, on 14 June 1754, was the second son of Arthur Villettes (1701&#150;1776), diplomatist. His family, who were Huguenot, had left France and settled in England after the revocation of the edict of Nantes. His father, who was British plenipotentiary at Turin, and afterwards in the Helvetic cantons, retired to Bath, where he died. Villettes was educated at Claverton School, Bath, and St Andrews University; intended for the bar, he completed two or three terms at Lincoln's Inn. But he was set on a military life, and his father granted him his wish and obtained for him a cornetcy in the 10th light dragoons on 19 December 1775. He was promoted lieutenant in the regiment on 25 December 1778 and captain on 22 January 1782. On 24 December 1787 he was promoted to a majority in the 12th light dragoons.<br>
<br>For part of the earlier period of his service in the army Villettes served as aide-de-camp and military secretary to General Sir William Pitt, commanding the forces in Ireland. On 30 July 1791 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel of the 69th foot, and he commanded that regiment during the siege of Toulon, where his good services were acknowledged by General Charles O'Hara and his successor, General David Dundas; here he commanded a mixed force of British and Neapolitan troops, and defended, until ordered to withdraw, the key position of Les Sablettes.<br>
<br>Villettes was next engaged in the conquest of Corsica, in 1794. He commanded a force of 1200 soldiers which landed from the fleet, and, with Nelson, then captain of the <i>Agamemnon</i> and 250 naval gunners, was entrusted with the siege of Bastia. Admiral Lord Hood bore testimony to his good services, and Nelson described him as &#145;a most excellent officer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dispatches and Letters</span>, 1.393). On the surrender of Bastia on 9 May 1794 Villettes was appointed governor of the town and gazetted colonel from 21 August 1795. In June 1796 he led a punitive expedition, accompanied by Sir Gilbert Elliot, the viceroy, to crush a rebellion in central Corsica, but was not permitted to finish the task, as Elliot conceded the rebels' demands. Ill health compelled his return to England, but on 30 November 1796 he was appointed a brigadier-general with a force sent to Portugal under Sir Charles Stuart. On 23 March 1797 he was transferred from the lieutenant-colonelcy of the 69th foot to that of the 1st dragoon guards, and was shortly afterwards made comptroller of the household to the duke of Kent.<br>
<br>On 18 June 1798 Villettes was promoted major-general. In 1799 he was sent to Corfu to raise a corps of Albanians&#151;a mission that proved impracticable. The following year he was posted to Malta as second in command to General Pigot. He succeeded the latter in 1801. On 25 July 1802 he took over from General Fox as commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean. In the meantime he was made colonel of a newly raised regiment of foot from 12 April 1799, and on 28 March 1801 was appointed colonel commandant of a newly raised battalion of the 4th King's Own (disbanded on 24 May 1802). He served in Malta until 1807, exhibiting great tact and firmness during a sometimes difficult period. He had to face the unpopularity caused by the explosion of a powder magazine in the city of Vittoriosa, and to suppress a mutiny in Froberg's regiment in 1807. He raised the Royal regiment of Malta, and was appointed its colonel on 7 December 1804. On 30 October 1805 he was promoted lieutenant-general.<br>
<br>Although he was recalled to England in 1807 to join Cathcart's expedition to the Baltic, Villettes arrived too late to participate, but on 7 November he was appointed lieutenant-governor and commander of the forces in Jamaica, with the local rank of general. On 4 January 1808 he was appointed colonel of the 64th foot. While on a tour of inspection in the island in July 1808 he fell ill with yellow fever, and he died, unmarried, on 13 July 1808 at Union. He was buried with military honours in the parish of Halfway Tree, near Kingston, and a monument was erected to his memory in Westminster Abbey. He had proved to be one of the most popular and capable commanders in the British army, his favourite maxim always being &#145;<i>Suaviter in modo, fortiter in re</i>&#146;  (Bowdler, 11).<br>
