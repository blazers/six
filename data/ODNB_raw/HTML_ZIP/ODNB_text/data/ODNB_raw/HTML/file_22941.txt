</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Quain, Sir  Richard</span>, baronet  (1816&#150;1898), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at Mallow, on the Blackwater, near Cork, while the clocks were striking midnight on 30 October 1816. He was the eldest surviving child of John Quain, a small landowner at Carrigoon, and his wife, Mary Burke. He was educated at a local dame-school before attending the diocesan school at Cloyne. His apprenticeship to Dr Fraser, a surgeon&#150;apothecary at Limerick, was terminated by the general distress in Ireland. He was set to work in the tannery business of his maternal uncle before resuming his medical studies at University College, London, where his cousins Jones Quain (1796&#150;1865) and Richard Quain (1800&#150;1887) were both established in medical practice. In 1840 he graduated as bachelor of medicine, obtaining a scholarship and gold medals, as well as honours in surgery and midwifery. He proceeded to MD (1842) and FRCP (1851).<br>
<br>Working as a house surgeon in University College Hospital, Quain's high capacities were widely recognized. From 1845 he was a leader writer for <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, and afterwards a contributor to the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>. He was one of the founders of the Pathological Society in 1846 (secretary, 1852; president, 1869). In 1849 he published two papers on cerebral apoplexy. However, his paper of 1850 on fatty degeneration of the heart established him as an authority on the disease; he later declared that if he had been physician to a great general hospital, fatty degeneration would have been known as Quain's disease. He also wrote on cognate subjects including angina pectoris and heart aneurysms. On 31 January 1854 he married Isabella Agnes (1828&#150;1891), daughter of George Wray, captain in the Bengal army. They had four daughters.<br>
<br>Quain was assistant physician (1848&#150;55) and physician (1855&#150;75) at Brompton Hospital for Diseases of the Chest. He was also consulting physician to the Royal Naval Hospital at Greenwich and the Royal Hospital for Consumption at Ventnor. But from the 1850s his great success was as a general physician and society doctor practising in Harley Street. Politicians (including Benjamin Disraeli) as well as distinguished authors, painters, and officials consulted him. Such patients introduced him to equally eminent men who became his friends and treated him as a representative exponent of professional opinion. He became the repository of many high professional confidences. A chance remark by Quain at the Athenaeum led to the premature leaking of Lord Northbrook's appointment to the viceroyalty of India in 1872.<br>
<br>Quain's superior connections ensured many public appointments. In 1860 he was nominated by the queen in council to the senate of the University of London. As such he was a leading figure in establishing the university's pathological research centre called the Brown Institution. Quain gave steadfast support to his friend and patient Robert Lowe, afterwards Viscount Sherbrooke, in his successful campaign of 1868 to become first member for the new University of London parliamentary constituency.<br>
<br>Quain's influential friends obtained his appointment to the General Medical Council in 1863. He remained a member continuously for thirty-five years until his death. Active on the council's pharmacopoeia committee (initially as secretary and from 1874 as chairman), he was closely involved with the publication of four new editions of the <span class="italic">British Pharmacopoeia</span> between 1867 and 1898. He served as treasurer of the General Medical Council for nearly thirty years before his election in 1891 as president; he was re-elected in 1896. Throughout this presidency Quain was active in the council's business, and somewhat despotic in his methods. He curbed prolixity at meetings by a reminder that speeches cost the council 13<i>s</i>. per minute. From 1896 younger physicians such as Victor Horsley publicly criticized the anachronistic organization of the council under Quain.<br>
<br>A few bullocks imported from Reval, which were infected with rinderpest and sold in London, caused a national epidemic in 1865. Quain was just leaving on a holiday when he was persuaded to join the royal commission on cattle plague chaired by Earl Spencer. He was convinced that the only way to stop the terrible mortality among herds was the absolute prohibition of moving cattle from infected districts together with the slaughter of all infected beasts, all healthy bovine animals with which they had contact, and all imported animals at their port of debarkation. Through his friendship with John Delane he contributed a series of letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span> signed &#145;Q&#146;, which were widely copied in provincial newspapers. Quain's campaign dispelled popular, parliamentary, and journalistic doubts, and overcame the resistance of railway companies and cattle-jobbing interests to the drastic measures that he advocated. In total, 300,000 animals were killed. Quain more than anyone contributed to ridding Britain of rinderpest. (In 1886 he sat on a government committee reporting on Pasteur's treatment for rabies.)<br>
<br>In 1871 Quain was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and he later received several honorary degrees. His connection with the discovery of the nature of fatty degeneration was beginning to be forgotten by the late 1870s when he accepted the editorship of a <span class="italic">Dictionary of Medicine</span>. He toiled ferociously on this project, sometimes through the night after a full day's work, recruiting distinguished contributors and assiduously scrutinizing their efforts. The dictionary, which sold 33,000 copies in its first edition of 1882, revived his professional standing. Having narrowly failed in 1888 to achieve his great ambition, the presidency of the Royal College of Physicians, he was consoled with its vice-presidency in 1889. Appointed physician-extraordinary to Queen Victoria in 1890, he was elevated to a baronetcy in 1891.<br>
<br>He fell ill in 1897 with a painful and exhausting cancer of the rectum, which required three operations. His herculean constitution astounded his friends: he roused himself to work on council business until his last days. He died on 13 March 1898 at his home, 67 Harley Street, St Marylebone, when his baronetcy became extinct. On 16 March he was buried in Hampstead cemetery.<br>
<br>&#145;An Irishman of the best type, always genial, always kindly, always amusing, an admirable <i>raconteur</i> and after-dinner speaker, Quain frequented most societies and was welcome in all&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 14 March 1898). He had a great power of making and keeping friends. Although never brilliant in medicine, he was endowed with excellent sense. As a diagnostician he was quick and intuitive. He was ready and practical in recommending cures. With patients he was cheerful, sympathetic, and considerate. He worked very hard, and used his time with ruthless efficiency. Though many colleagues relished &#145;his intense, jovial, pugnacious attitude towards life&#146; it riled those who suspected him of &#145;selfish designs and motives&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, 19 March 1898).<br>
