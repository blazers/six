<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lacy,  Thomas Hailes</span>  (1809&#150;1873), <span class="occ">actor, playwright, and theatrical publisher</span>, was born Thomas Lacy Hailes in Bethnal Green, London, the son of Thomas Hailes, gentleman. He made his London d&eacute;but on 7 April 1828 as Lenoir in William Dimond's <span class="italic">The Foundling of the Forest</span> (Olympic). He then acted in the provinces before undertaking management of the Windsor Theatre for Montague Penley, whom he then succeeded as lessee. For a short period from 1841 he was manager of the Theatre Royal, Sheffield. After provincial engagements in Nottingham and Doncaster, he returned to London in 1844 to act at the Pavilion and Victoria theatres. In May he joined Samuel Phelps's new company at Sadler's Wells, where Frances Dalton, under her stage name <a href="#cosubject_15847">Fanny Cooper [<i>see below</i>]</a>, whom he probably married on 25 January 1842 at St Paul's, Covent Garden, was also engaged. On 29 May 1844, the opening night of the season, Lacy was Banquo to Phelps's Macbeth. Other parts that season included Tobias in Benjamin Thompson's <span class="italic">The Stranger</span>, Antonio in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, and Appius Claudius in Sheridan Knowles's tragedy <span class="italic">Virginius</span>. In the 1844&#150;5 season he appeared in Manchester. He was a serviceable actor, capable of a variety of roles, but he never received serious critical attention.<br>
<br>Lacy's activities as a playwright consisted mostly of collaborative adaptations of novels. He adapted Moncrieff's versions of Dickens as <span class="italic">The Pickwickians</span> (1837) and (with T. H. Higgie) <span class="italic">Martin Chuzzlewit</span> (Queens, 29 July 1844); (also with Higgie) W. H. Ainsworth's <span class="italic">The Tower of London</span> (City of London theatre, 26 December 1840); and, via a French version by Jules Janin (with John Courtney), Samuel Richardson's <span class="italic">Clarissa Harlowe</span> (Princess's, 28 September 1846), in which Charles Mathews played Lovelace. At Sadler's Wells on 5 August 1846 his one-act farce <span class="italic">A Silent Woman</span> was the afterpiece, with Fanny Cooper as Miss Sandford. His pieces are unremarkable; several, however, were published in his acting edition, and <span class="italic">A Silent Woman</span> was also printed in New York in De Witt's series. Lacy edited anthologies of recitations (1864, 1866) and collections of costume plates (1865, 1868, 1872). He also projected publication of an updated edition of Baker's <span class="italic">Biographia dramatica</span> (1812), for which he collected new material, six manuscript volumes of which are now in the British Library, along with four annotated copies of Baker's original.<br>
<br>Lacy's main contribution to the theatre was in publishing. In 1849 he opened a theatrical booksellers at 17 Wellington Street, Strand, and in 1857 he moved to larger premises at 89 Strand. He proved an astute, if not especially scrupulous, businessman and from about 1852 onwards bought out the lists of venerable competitors such as John Cumberland, G. H. Davidson, and John Duncombe, and (about 1856) more recent rivals such as Samuel G. Fairbrother, with the evident intention of cornering the market in printing cheap editions of plays. <span class="roman">Lacy's Acting Edition</span>, begun in 1850, with full stage directions and business, rapidly became the largest enterprise of its kind, catering for amateurs and professionals alike. All plays in the series, available individually at 6<i>d</i>. or in volume sets, were kept continuously in print; an up-to-date listing of pieces in Lacy's proprietorship was published separately in 1864. By his retirement in 1873 the series comprised ninety-nine volumes and 1458 plays. His performance fees were deliberately pitched lower than those of the Dramatic Authors' Society, which simply acted as a fee-collecting agent for its members. Lacy specialized in buying up copyrights at knock-down prices from impecunious dramatists; but on occasions he assumed copyright without authority. F. C. Burnand, who as an inexperienced playwright in the early 1860s had reason to mistrust him on both accounts, portrayed him as a rather roguish figure in &#145;dirty shirt sleeves&#146;, &#145;muddling about with books and papers in a very ill-lighted and grimy shop&#146;  (Burnand, 1.368). For his cavalier attitude to copyright Lacy was successfully brought to court for unauthorized dramatizations of copyright novels in <i>Reade v. Lacy</i> (1862) and <i>Tinsley v. Lacy</i> (1863). At his decease the Dramatic Authors' Society claimed from his estate in unpaid or misappropriated copyright fees the sum of &pound;700, which after negotiation with the executor was reduced to &pound;250.<br>
<br>Having sold his business early in 1873 to the New York publisher Samuel French, Lacy retired to Surrey, but died at his home in Benhill Street, Sutton, on 1 August. He was buried at Sutton church on 6 August. His library was sold by auction between 24 and 29 November 1873 for &pound;2650 and his theatrical portraits on 8 December for &pound;1970. In his will the &#145;interest, profits, and rentals&#146; derived from a capital sum of &pound;8000, copyright and acting rights on Cumberland's <span class="italic">British Theatre</span> and <span class="italic">Minor Theatre</span>, and property (including 9, 11, and 13 Garrick Street) he left to a charity for needy actors and actresses, the Royal General Theatrical Fund, of which he was a long-serving board member. Known as the &#145;Lacy Bequest&#146;, it provided the fund with much of its income for the rest of the century and beyond.<br>
<br>His wife, <a name="cosubject_15847"></a><span class="headword">Fanny Cooper</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Frances Charlotte Dalton]</span>  (1814&#150;1872), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born in Greenwich, Kent, in 1814, the daughter of William Dalton. She was the leading actress in Mrs Thomas Robertson's company on the Lincoln circuit in 1837 and made her London d&eacute;but as Lydia in Knowles's <span class="italic">The Love Chase</span> at the Haymarket (16 April 1838), when <span class="italic">The Times</span> (17 April) was much impressed by her &#145;chaste quiet piece of performance&#146;, &#145;genuine feeling&#146;, and &#145;desire to give distinctness to the text&#146;. At Drury Lane in the 1839&#150;40 season she acted a repertory of minor parts such as Margaret in Philip Massinger's <span class="italic">A New Way to Pay Old Debts</span> and Catherine in Colman's <span class="italic">The Heir-at-Law</span>. On 7 September 1840 she joined Madame Vestris's company at Covent Garden, where in November she played Helena in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>. Although, according to <span class="italic">The Times</span> (17 November 1840), &#145;her manner was constrained and artificial &hellip; there was still evident desire to give the words their meaning [and] that evident knowledge of feeling that the part required&#146;. She revived the role in January and February 1842. Fanny Cooper's marriage to Lacy, which is said to have taken place on 25 January 1842 (in Sheffield or London), has not been traced in the official records. In her first season at Sadler's Wells in 1844, she sometimes performed alongside Lacy, as Countess Wintersen in <span class="italic">The Stranger</span>, Nerissa in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, and Virginia in <span class="italic">Virginius</span>. Other parts in her repertory included Aspatia in Knowles's <span class="italic">The Bridal</span> and Mary in Massinger's <span class="italic">The City Madam</span> (1844 season), Margaret Aylmer in G. W. Lovell's <span class="italic">Love's Sacrifice</span> (August 1846), and Mildred in a revival of Browning's <span class="italic">A Blot in the 'Scutcheon</span> (November 1848). But she maintained her affection for Shakespearian comedy and was occasionally rewarded by important parts such as Rosalind (November 1847) and Olivia (January 1848). In late summer 1850 she left Sadler's Wells, where for four seasons she had been increasingly overshadowed by Laura Addison, for the Surrey Theatre under William Creswick. The move, though short-lived and not entirely successful, enabled her to extend her Shakespearian repertory: Lady Macbeth (September) and Volumnia in <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span> (December). Fanny Cooper never quite made the first rank as actress but she was very popular with audiences and was perfectly suited to the ensemble acting for which Sadler's Wells under Phelps became renowned. Phelps re-engaged her for two further seasons from autumn 1853, when she resumed her old role of Helena in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> (a performance which left Henry Morley in <span class="italic">The Examiner</span> rather unimpressed because she was &#145;too loud and real&#146;) and took on a variety of new ones, including Desdemona (November 1853), Portia, and Thaisa (March and October 1854). She died at her home, 89 Strand, on 21 April 1872. There was an only son, Thomas junior, said to be mentally unstable, who died unmarried in 1895.<br>
