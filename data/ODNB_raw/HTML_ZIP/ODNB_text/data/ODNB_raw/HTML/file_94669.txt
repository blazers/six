<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rance, Sir  Hubert Elvin</span>  (1898&#150;1974), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, was born at 8 Langham Terrace, Plymouth, on 17 July 1898, the only son of Frederick Hubert Rance, then serving as a warrant officer in the Royal Engineers, and his wife, Minnie Florence, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Shaw. He was educated at Wimbledon College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Commissioned into the Worcestershire regiment in 1916, he served for six months on the western front during the First World War and was wounded three times. He remained with his regiment following the conclusion of hostilities but in 1926 transferred to the Royal Signals. On 25 January 1927 he married Mary No&euml;l Guy (<i>b</i>. 1904/5), daughter of Charles Alfred Guy; they had a son and a daughter. On the outbreak of the Second World War he was an instructor at the Staff College in Camberley. He served in France with the British expeditionary force as officer commanding 4 division signals. Evacuated from Dunkirk, he was mentioned in dispatches and made OBE. Promotion to brigadier followed and he was director of technical training at the War Office in 1942&#150;3, then on the general staff of western command from 1943 to 1945.<br>
<br>In April 1945, after his name had been recommended to Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, supreme allied commander, south-east Asia, Rance was appointed director of civil affairs in Burma. He arrived in Rangoon at the beginning of June. His tasks were to administer the civilian population and begin Burma's rehabilitation after three years of Japanese occupation. He also became politically involved through his support for Mountbatten's policy of working with the rising tide of Burmese nationalism. Not all of his staff agreed with him. He wrote to Mountbatten in September 1945: &#145;The majority of my officers are Burma officials and they could not or would not see that the present political set-up is quite different to anything that existed in pre-war days&#146;  (Tinker, 1.471). Rance had reservations when Mountbatten's military administration of Burma ended in October 1945 and Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith returned as governor. He thought it too early for civilian government because Burma's police force was not properly trained.<br>
<br>In February 1946 Rance left Burma, never expecting to return. Nevertheless he was back at the end of August 1946 (following a brief spell as deputy commander, south-western district, based at Taunton), this time as governor with a knighthood (as GBE; he had been appointed CB earlier in the year) and the military rank of major-general. He took over from Sir Henry Knight, who had led a caretaker administration since June, Dorman-Smith having left Burma ostensibly on health grounds but in reality because he had been recalled. Relations with the nationalist Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL) and its leader, Aung San, had deteriorated during Dorman-Smith's governorship. Dorman-Smith was hostile to the AFPFL and wanted Aung San tried as a war criminal. In turn the AFPFL was not prepared to co-operate with an extended British timetable for independence. They were behind a police strike which started the day after Rance was sworn in as governor.<br>
<br>Rance played a significant role in Burma's independence. He persuaded a reluctant Labour cabinet in London to negotiate with the AFPFL. Rance insisted they had popular support and warned of an uprising if talks were not held. British ministers believed the AFPFL had no mandate, but Aung San led a delegation to London and concluded an independence agreement with the prime minister, Clement Attlee, in January 1947. Equally important, when Aung San was assassinated in July 1947 Rance acted immediately by inviting Nu to head the government. Hesitation on the part of the governor might have been fatal, especially when it became known that British army officers were implicated in the theft of weapons used in the killings. Much to Rance's own regret, Burma had chosen to become independent as a republic outside the British Commonwealth before Aung San was killed. Faced by local communist opposition, the AFPFL could not accept allegiance to a foreign monarch. Rance lent his voice to others arguing for a change in the basis of membership to enable Burma to remain in the Commonwealth, but it was not until April 1949, fifteen months after Burma's independence, that a formula was agreed allowing India to become a republic within the Commonwealth.<br>
<br>Rance left Burma on independence day, 4 January 1948. He did not enjoy good health during his Burma career and was in hospital more than once with amoebic dysentery. A less taxing assignment awaited him in May 1948 when (having been made GCMG) he was appointed chairman of a Standing Closer Association committee in the West Indies. The committee reported in March 1950, recommending federation as the shortest path to independence within the Commonwealth for the territories of the British Caribbean. Rance was further involved in the federal project as governor of Trinidad and Tobago between 1950 and 1955, but the West Indies Federation, created in 1958, survived only four years. Just before it left office in 1951 the Labour government invited Rance to take charge in Malaya, where the high commissioner, Sir Henry Gurney, had been assassinated by communist guerillas. Pressed by his wife, Rance eventually declined on medical grounds and General Sir Gerald Templer was later appointed by Churchill.<br>
<br>Burma continued to occupy Rance into retirement. He was f&ecirc;ted by the Burmese government in 1956 when he returned on the eighth anniversary of independence. The Burmese wanted to bestow on him an honour of their own but this was not possible because of British regulations. Nu, to whom Rance had turned in Burma's hour of need in 1947, now seemed to the former governor a weak and indecisive leader who wanted to retire to religious life. Rance left Burma apprehensive about the country's future. In 1957 he became the first president of the Britain&#150;Burma Society. In 1967, responding to comments by the Burmese ambassador about Burma's departure from the Commonwealth, Mountbatten asked Rance to write his own account of Burma's independence. Rance's offer to write an official history was declined. Instead, surviving British participants in Burma's independence were invited to write personal recollections. Extracts from these, together with a selection of documents from the official British records, were later published in <span class="italic">Burma, the Struggle for Independence, 1944&#150;48</span> (2 vols, 1983&#150;4). In retirement Rance lived at the Old Farm, Frensham, Surrey. His last years were clouded by ill health, and he died on 24 January 1974 at the Cambridge Military Hospital, Aldershot, of heart failure. He was survived by his wife and their two children.<br>
