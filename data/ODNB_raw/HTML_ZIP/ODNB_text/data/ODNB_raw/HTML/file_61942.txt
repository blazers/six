<span class="headword">Learoyd,  Roderick Alastair Brook</span>  (1913&#150;1996), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born on 5 February 1913 at 15 Turketel Road, Folkestone, Kent, the son of Major Reginald Brook Learoyd, retired army officer, and his wife, Marjorie Scott, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Boadle. The family, of Scottish and Yorkshire descent, had been involved in the Yorkshire textile industry and his father had served in the First World War in the Highland light infantry. Rod, as his family called him, was educated at Hydreye House Preparatory School, Sussex, and Wellington College, Berkshire, before attending Chelsea College of Aeronautical and Automobile Engineering. At the conclusion of his formal education he spent two years on his uncle's fruit farm in Argentina.<br>
<br>In March 1936 Learoyd returned to England and took a short commission in the RAF. Following training at Hamble and at Wittering, he graduated later that year and was posted to 49 squadron at Worthy Down. In 1938 the squadron moved to Scampton where it became the first to be equipped with the new Handley Page Hampden bombers.<br>
<br>On the night of 12 August 1940 Acting Flight Lieutenant &#145;Babe&#146; Learoyd, as he was known to his RAF colleagues because of his impressive physical size, took off with ten other Hampden bombers on a mission to destroy an old aqueduct over the River Ems, north of M&uuml;nster. Having attacked the Dortmund&#150;Ems canal on a previous sortie, he was well aware of the high risk involved. Success depended on his approaching the canal from a direction that took him through a narrow passage of carefully sited anti-aircraft batteries that were able to deliver devastating fire from point-blank range. Disregarding the loss of two other Hampden bombers, Learoyd, blinded by German searchlights directed from close range, made his attack at an altitude of 150 feet. Flying solely on instruments, with his plane almost shot to pieces, he released his bomb load on target. Despite being wounded in the raid, Learoyd brought his plane home successfully although, with the landing flaps inoperable and the undercarriage indicators out of action, he had to wait until the light of dawn before attempting to land at Scampton. This he did without injury to his crew or further damage to his aircraft. For such conspicuous gallantry, Learoyd was awarded the Victoria Cross, his citation in the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> reading, &#145;The high degree of courage, skill and determination which this officer had invariably displayed on many occasions in the face of the enemy, sets an example which is unsurpassed&#146;. The award was popular with his fellow officers at Scampton who held Babe Learoyd in the highest regard for his quiet modesty and cool unflappability. Further honours followed when in November 1940 he received the freedom of the borough of New Romney, Kent.<br>
<br>Following his promotion to squadron leader, Learoyd acted temporarily as personal assistant to Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham before rejoining operations in February 1941 when he was appointed officer commanding 83 squadron at Scampton. He took up a new command as wing commander at operational training unit, Cottesmore, in the following June and six months later succeeded to the command of 44 squadron at Waddington, the first Avro Lancaster unit in the RAF. From January 1943 until the end of the war, Learoyd held a number of non-operational postings with the Air Ministry and with officer training units.<br>
<br>In May 1945 Learoyd returned to operational flying when he joined 48 (Dakota) squadron and moved to west Africa. He returned to England in the following year and was demobilized in October 1946, transferring to the RAF reserve as wing commander. Learoyd then joined the Malayan civil aviation department where he piloted for the colony's governor. On returning to England he was employed briefly in a tractor and construction firm before joining Austin Motor Company as export sales manager. He remained with the company (later British Motor Corporation) for the rest of his working life. In the course of his work he visited the United States and later headed the company's fleet sales, particularly for government departments. His natural charm and wartime reputation led to his becoming involved in British Motor Corporation's public relations division, where he was repeatedly used as unofficial ambassador.<br>
<br>Learoyd was a shy, unassuming man who rarely spoke about his wartime exploits over Germany. He had a lifelong passion for cars, particularly for Aston Martins, regularly attended the Le Mans 24 hour race, and was a frequent visitor to the Silverstone circuit. Although his later years were marred by diabetes that affected his vision, Learoyd was an active member of the Victoria Cross and George Cross Association. His portrait hangs in the Imperial War Museum.<br>
<br>On 24 January 1996 Learoyd died suddenly at his home, 12 Fittleworth Gardens, Rustington, Sussex, from a heart attack, survived by a brother and sister. He never married.<br>
