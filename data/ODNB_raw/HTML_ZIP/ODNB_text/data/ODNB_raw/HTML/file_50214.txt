<span class="headword">Berkeley,  James</span>, first Baron Berkeley  (<em>c.</em>1394&#150;1463), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, born in Raglan, Monmouthshire, was the son of Sir James Berkeley and Elizabeth Bluet and claimant to the Berkeley barony. He was dubbed &#145;James the Just&#146; by the family historian James Smyth. The castle and hundred of Berkeley, Gloucestershire, had descended in the direct line of the lords Berkeley from the early twelfth century. By 1346 the value of the estate under Lord Thomas (&#145;the Rich&#146;) had increased to &pound;1150 p.a., and the marriage of his grandson Thomas to Margaret, daughter and eventual heir of Lord Lisle, added extensive properties in southern England. About 1400 this Lord Thomas (&#145;the Magnificent&#146;), the fifth baron (counting from a writ of summons issued to Thomas de Berkeley in 1295), commanded an income and retinue the size of a lesser earl, his household numbered upward of three hundred persons and was a centre of culture and patronage, and the family had a tradition of distinguished military service and high standing in national affairs. But Lord Thomas's sole child was his daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56573/', "Elizabeth Berkeley")</script>, married to Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick. Though heir-general to all the Berkeley and Lisle estates, her claim to the castle and hundred of Berkeley with its twelve manors, along with one in Somerset, was barred by an entail made in 1349 which limited these to a male heir. This was Thomas's nephew James Berkeley. Such a division would have dismembered the Berkeley inheritance and undermined the family's local hegemony. Lord Thomas never resolved this dilemma; indeed he worsened it through his own indecision, on the one hand seeking to bypass the entail to favour his daughter, on the other rearing James at Berkeley Castle as his heir. James Berkeley probably married first a daughter of Sir John St John (he was certainly contracted to her, though there is some doubt as to whether the marriage actually took place), and second, in 1414, one of Sir Humphrey Stafford (<i>c</i>.1379&#150;1442), MP for Dorset, but both women died young and their names are now unknown. In 1423 or 1424 he married Lady Isabel (<i>d</i>. 27 Sept 1452), widow of Henry Ferrers and daughter of Thomas (I) Mowbray, duke of Norfolk.<br>
<br>When Lord Thomas died on 13 July 1417 Elizabeth and her husband quickly seized Berkeley Castle and secured interim custody of it from Henry V. James Berkeley found it impossible to implement his claim to the entailed lands, for Warwick's occupancy was legally safeguarded while he was fighting with Henry in France. In 1420 Berkeley (who was summoned to parliament as a baron in the following year; this summons was held in the modern period to have created a new peerage) secured the backing of Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, then keeper of the realm in the king's absence, by a bribe of 1000 marks, while the countess of Warwick solicited support from his brother John, duke of Bedford. Each side sought to strengthen its claims by acts of self-help, involving armed confrontation and skirmishes around Berkeley. Fearing that the feud might grow, the council of the young Henry VI persuaded both parties to accept arbitration under heavy financial penalties, but only after a succession of awards had failed, and following Elizabeth's death in 1422 and Warwick's remarriage, was an abiding settlement agreed in 1425. By this Berkeley received Berkeley Castle and most of the entailed lands while the earl was given a life interest in seven manors and until his death in 1439 retained his wife's inheritance, the Lisle lands, &#145;by courtesy of England&#146;. On this basis both sides lived in peace, though Berkeley, who had been knighted by the infant Henry VI in 1426, was forced to mortgage lands and goods &#145;and lived and died in far meaner part and condition than his ancestors&#146;  (Smyth, 2.48). In 1436 his income was assessed at no more than &pound;333.<br>
<br>If James Berkeley looked to recover not only the lands held by Warwick but the Lisle inheritance in 1439 he was disappointed. For Warwick's daughters claimed their mother's inheritance and were backed by their husbands, John Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury, Edmund Beaufort, then earl of Dorset, and George Neville, Lord Latimer, all men of greater power than Lord James. Once again both sides agreed under heavy recognizances to abide arbitration, which eventually in 1448 awarded the disputed lands to the three coheiresses for life. This was not acceptable to Berkeley who resorted to force in 1450, precipitating a private war with Shrewsbury. In September 1451 Shrewsbury's son, Lord Lisle, captured Berkeley Castle, taking Berkeley and his sons prisoners, and forcing him to hand over the castle for two years as security. The countess likewise seized Isobel, Lady Berkeley, to prevent her from appealing to the king, thereby hastening her death. But in July 1453 Shrewsbury and Lisle were both killed at the battle of Castillon in Gascony. Berkeley now found the new earl of Shrewsbury more ready to compromise and his marriage to the earl's sister, Joan, signalled the end of the dispute, formalized by a final reconciliation with the old countess shortly before his death in Berkeley Castle in late November 1463. He was buried in the family chapel at Berkeley church where his tomb and effigy survive. The final contest was a duel fought between his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50216/', "William Berkeley")</script> and the new Lord Lisle, Thomas Talbot, with their followers, at Nibley Green on 20 March 1470 where Lisle was mortally wounded.<br>
<br>James Berkeley's lifelong struggle to secure his inheritance seems to have monopolized his energies, for he took no part in war or politics, often absenting himself from parliaments, and was only intermittently named on local commissions. Whether this effacement reflected his circumstances or his temperament is now impossible to say. As Smyth wrote, &#145;the power and malice of the adversaries of this Lord James kept him for the most part within doors like a prisoner from youth to age&#146;  (2.96). Undoubtedly his lack of political standing and influence handicapped him in his contest with such major figures as the earls of Warwick and Shrewsbury. Technically a lawsuit between the heir-general and the heir male, it was essentially a struggle for land and power in Gloucestershire, fought by political rather than legal or even military means. Lord James's tenacity and longevity procured the survival of the Berkeley barony but as a mere shadow of its former wealth and esteem.<br>
