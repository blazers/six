<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rust,  William Charles</span>  (1903&#150;1949), <span class="occ">political activist and journalist</span>, was born on 24 April 1903 at 5 Eastdene Street, St George's Road, Camberwell, London, the son of Frederick George Rust, journeyman bookbinder, and his wife, Eliza Rogers. He left school at fourteen and worked as an office boy at Hulton's press agency, from where he was sacked for exposing the trade union leader J. T. Brownlie as one of Hulton's labour correspondents. Rust also worked briefly at Sylvia Pankhurst's <span class="italic">Workers' Dreadnought</span> and shortly after its formation in 1920 he joined the British Communist Party.<br>
<br>Unlike most of that first generation of communist leaders Rust never really experienced life as anything other than a party functionary. Initially active as an unemployed organizer in Camberwell, he joined the party's executive as early as 1923 as representative of the Young Communist League, and its political bureau two years later. In the same capacity he made the first of his many trips to Moscow to attend the Fifth Congress of the Communist International. Though he was in many respects a model party bureaucrat, that did not necessarily make for comfortable office routines. In 1925 Rust was among twelve communist leaders imprisoned for sedition, in his case for twelve months, and several times before the war he had to uproot himself to perform party duties both at home and abroad. What his dependence on the apparatus did mean, however, is that he was to be noted even among his fellow communists for his quite exceptional devotion to Moscow.<br>
<br>That may in part have been a matter of ambition. In 1928&#150;9 Stalin made much use of communist youth movements to undermine the older or less tractable elements still prominent in several communist parties. Rust, then working in Moscow for the secretariat of the Young Communist International, could scarcely have been better placed for such a role. One lasting result was an intense rivalry and distrust between Rust and Harry Pollitt, the latter then emerging as the party's secretary, while Rust was installed as editor of the party newspaper launched in 1930, the <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span>. There is much anecdotal evidence from his second spell as editor, from 1939 to 1949, that Rust regarded the paper not least as a vehicle for his own leadership ambitions.<br>
<br>By this time Rust had a formidable record as a party organizer. Ending his first stint at the <span class="italic">Worker</span> in 1932, he then put in spells as a party representative in Moscow, a district organizer in Lancashire, and a base commissar (technically the <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span>'s correspondent), with the International Brigades in Spain. The occasion for his resuming the paper's editorship was a fierce controversy within the party leadership over Moscow's instructions that it oppose the war with Germany. As always Rust kept close to the Moscow line, and for the twenty months in which the communists maintained an anti-war stance he was one of a three-man secretariat which replaced Pollitt. After the Russians entered the war in June 1941 Rust retained his editorship of the <span class="italic">Worker</span>, and on the lifting of its temporary wartime ban in September 1942 he embarked on what many regarded as a quixotic project: the establishment of his communist news-sheet as a fully professional, mass circulation daily.<br>
<br>Rust himself was to recount these events in his <span class="italic">Story of the Daily Worker</span> (1949). Harnessing the goodwill the communists then enjoyed, both within the labour movement and on Fleet Street, the paper recruited a team of impressively talented young journalists, transferred ownership to a non-party co-operative society, and equipped itself with a new printing press and premises. To great fanfares and a torchlight procession, the &#145;new&#146; <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span>, was, after considerable delays, finally launched on 1 May 1948. Briefly it held a six-figure circulation, but in truth its moment of opportunity had passed. With the onset of the cold war not only did many of its erstwhile friends desert it, but the paper itself was now subjected to the tighter political disciplines that the continuing reality of communist control allowed. The paper's long decline had already begun by the time of Rust's sudden death. He was taken ill at an executive meeting of the Communist Party and died from a haemorrhage at Charing Cross Hospital, London, on 3 February 1949.<br>
<br>Even among fellow communists Rust was not widely liked. Of deceptively Pickwickian countenance, he lacked nothing in self-regard and yet displayed a sedulous deference to the Moscow overlords who alone could further his considerable ambitions. Colleagues at the <span class="italic">Worker</span>, several of them indebted to him for their start in journalism, remembered him more positively. Certainly there was no doubt as to the energy and ability with which, not even a journalist by training, he took on the might of Fleet Street. As to his hidden complexities, these may never be fully revealed.<br>
<br>Rust's first marriage, to Kathleen Taylor (originally O'Shaughnessy), produced a daughter, Rosa, born in the USSR in 1925 and remaining there after her parents returned home. Caught up in the wartime deportation of the Volga Germans before coming to Britain in 1944, Rosa's very existence was unsuspected by most of her father's colleagues. Rust, meanwhile, had met his second wife, Tamara Kravets (1913&#150;2008), a Soviet citizen and daughter of a Russian architect who, like so many others, came under suspicion during the terror. The circumstances in which Tamara was allowed to leave the USSR, herself to become a leading member of the British Communist Party, have since prompted considerable speculation among former associates. Rust's career, even more than those of most of his colleagues, may yet be further illuminated by materials from the Russian archives.<br>
