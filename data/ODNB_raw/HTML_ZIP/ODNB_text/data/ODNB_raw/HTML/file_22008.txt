<span class="headword">Peshall <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Pearsall]</span>,  John</span> <span class="st"> [styled Sir John Peshall, sixth baronet]</span>  (1718&#150;1778), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born John Pearsall at Hawn, Shropshire, on 27 January 1718, the eldest son of Thomas Pearsall (1694&#150;1759) of Eccleshall, Staffordshire, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1770), daughter of Samuel Sanders of Ombersley, Worcestershire. He matriculated from Pembroke College, Oxford, on 15 April 1736 and graduated BA (1739) and MA (1745). He worked for a time as a schoolmaster in Highgate and was ordained. On 12 July 1753 he married Mary, daughter and coheir of James Allen, vicar of Thaxted, Essex, and Anne Peers. They had three sons and one daughter. Although he had been preferred to the living of Stoke Bliss in Herefordshire, he spent much of his time in Oxford, where he was active as a county JP and in the philanthropic activities around the city. In or shortly before 1770 (probably after his mother's death on 6 July 1770), he assumed the baronetcy (created in 1611 but which had become extinct in 1712 on the death of the third baronet) and changed his name to Peshall, styling himself sixth baronet. In 1770 he was listed among the subscribers to the Radcliffe Infirmary and in 1772 he laid the foundation-stone for the new workhouse. He was among the most active of the paving commissioners from its inception in 1771 until 1775.<br>
<br>Peshall wrote <span class="italic">The History of the University of Oxford to the Death of William the Conqueror</span> (1772), a short pamphlet of thirty-two pages, which traced the foundation of Oxford from druidical times to the Norman conquest. He also edited Anthony Wood's <span class="italic">Antient and Present State of the City of Oxford</span> (1773) from the manuscript in the Bodleian Library, with additions of his own, and dedicated it to the mayor and aldermen. He preserved the structure of a topographical, parochial survey and the extensive lists of monumental inscriptions and material from parish registers, but his interest in the contemporary improvements initiated in recent years is also reflected in the effusive introductory description of the town and the inclusion of a history of the Holywell Music Room by William Hayes. Peshall died on 9 November 1778 at Halesowen, and was buried at Hawn. He was survived by his widow, whose will was proved in 1801. After his death Richard Gough wrote to John Price, Bodley's librarian, asking him to inquire after Peshall's collections towards the history of Oxford, but it is not known what their subsequent fate was; Gough did not, apparently, trace them.<br>
