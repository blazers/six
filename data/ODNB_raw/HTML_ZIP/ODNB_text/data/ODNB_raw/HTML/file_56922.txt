<span class="headword">Brighton,  Albert George <span class="st"> [Peter]</span></span>  (1900&#150;1988), <span class="occ">palaeontologist and curator</span>, was born on 29 December 1900 at 13 Conyers Road, Streatham, London, the son of George Freeston Brighton, gardener, and his wife, Susan Alice Jayne. He was educated at St Leonard's School, Streatham, and Westminster City School, before gaining a scholarship to read natural sciences at Christ's College, Cambridge. Despite showing considerable early promise of a first, and becoming joint winner of the Wiltshire prize for geology and mineralogy, Bertie, or Peter as he was best-known, graduated from Cambridge with a second-class degree in 1922. There he remained, committed to a career in palaeontology, and eventually began a doctorate which he did not complete. Brighton's first paper, on cretaceous echinoids from Nigeria, was published in 1925. Over the next decade his rate of publication steadily decreased as his palaeontological interests found a new direction, curation. He continued to lecture on fossil echinoids and nurtured many notable research students, but it is for his pioneering curatorial work on the fossil collections of the university's Sedgwick Museum that he is most widely known.<br>
<br>In the late 1920s the Sedgwick Museum remained much as it had been at the end of the nineteenth century, inaccessible, disorganized, and largely neglected. Owen Thomas Jones (1878&#150;1967), who was elected Woodwardian professor of geology in 1930, immediately sought to resurrect its fortunes and appointed Brighton, who was a keen voluntary worker at the museum, to the post of curator in 1931 (the year in which, on 18 June, Brighton married Edith May, daughter of John Martin, accountant). Brighton estimated the museum then held half a million uncurated specimens, most only documented by the label tablets to which they were attached. The collection became his life's work as he slaved tirelessly at its identification, cataloguing, and arrangement. His preoccupation with these tasks perhaps reflected his largely unambitious and reclusive nature, and his obsessively ordered lifestyle. In the early years he also maintained correspondence with academics around the world but was happy to delegate these duties on the appointment of an assistant in 1954.<br>
<br>Brighton was autocratic and donnish, and he imposed rigour and methodology, qualities manifest in his indexes and in the &#145;shelf catalogues&#146; which he developed as physical specimen databases. In a career spanning thirty-seven years he curated 375,000 specimens, and in so doing probably processed three times that number. The Sedgwick collections were transformed into a fully functioning modern palaeontological museum, which also now held a large collection of notebooks, maps, and annotated monographs chronicling its history. Brighton's selfless dedication had produced an unusually data-rich resource which became the basis for pioneering work on the computerization of museum records, work he encouraged and which was ultimately to influence such developments nationally. On his retirement in 1968 Brighton left the museum without ceremony, seldom to return.<br>
<br>Though he lacked social graces Brighton was a cultivated man: he was extremely well read, a fine artist, an accomplished pianist, and a lover of the cigarette. Edith by contrast was very sociable, even charismatic, and their elegant house on Parkers Piece became something of a haven for the fashionable of Cambridge in the post-war years. Both were keen letter writers. Together, diminutive and eccentric, they were a perfect match. Peter Brighton died of emphysema at Langdon House, Scotland Road, Chesterton, Cambridgeshire, on 9 April 1988, and was cremated in Cambridge on 14 April; Edith survived him, dying on 22 September 1994. Brighton's personal memorial was a collection so perfectly curated that those who effortlessly used it failed to realize or credit the labour that had been involved. In 1992, the Geological Curators' Group (GCG), a specialist group of the Geological Society of London, instituted a medal in Brighton's honour. The aims of the GCG mirrored those of Brighton; the A. G. Brighton medal now celebrates those who, in the Brighton mould, have made an outstanding contribution to geology through the interpretation and preservation of geological material in museums.<br>
