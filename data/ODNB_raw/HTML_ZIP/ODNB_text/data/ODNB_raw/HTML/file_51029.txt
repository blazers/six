<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Eyre,  Ronald</span>  (1929&#150;1992), <span class="occ">theatre and television director</span>, was born on 13 April 1929 at 1 Longcroft Cottages, Mapplewell, near Barnsley, Yorkshire, the only son of Christopher Eyre (1899&#150;1970), a miner, and his wife, Mabel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith (1902&#150;1965). He was baptized at the United Methodist church, Mapplewell, on 12 May 1929. His father, who was poorly educated, was passionately committed to the idea of a good education for his son. This almost visionary determination encouraged Eyre to succeed, first at Mapplewell infants' and junior schools and Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield (1940&#150;47), and then, after two years as a wireless mechanic in the Royal Air Force, at University College, Oxford (1949&#150;52). His talents as actor and director were exploited by the Oxford University Dramatic Society (of which he became secretary in 1951), the Experimental Theatre Club, and the Univ Players. He wrote later that<blockquote>Acting, as I then understood it, and would probably understand it still if I tried it again, was an exercise in being beside oneself&#151;and raised alarming possibilities and questions. Hiding in public. Backing into the limelight. Directing seemed, for me, less dangerous. (Eyre to Humphrey Carpenter, 11 March 1984, priv. coll.)</blockquote>After graduating with a second-class degree in English, Eyre became a teacher, first at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Blackburn, and then at Bromsgrove School. He was an inspiring master, but the classroom proved a frustrating arena for his talents, and in 1956 he took up a post at the BBC, where he remained until 1964. He was a founding director of BBC Schools Television, and his productions included <span class="italic">Philoctetes</span>, <span class="italic">The Bacchae</span>, and <span class="italic">The Caucasian Chalk Circle</span>, as well as his own play <span class="italic">The Victim</span>. In Michael Marland's view, &#145;he was a pioneering and brilliant figure in bringing the study of television as a dramatic art form into the country's classrooms&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 23 April 1992). Graduating to adult drama (although he would not have seen it that way), he wrote scripts for <span class="italic">Z Cars</span> and twelve plays for radio and television, including a much praised adaptation of Leskov's <span class="italic">A Crack in the Ice</span>. His television productions included <span class="italic">Condemned to Acquittal</span>, the first play to be broadcast on BBC2, and the television version of Michael Elliot's acclaimed Royal Shakespeare Company <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, with Vanessa Redgrave as Rosalind.<br>
<br>Eyre's first productions in the professional theatre were at the Birmingham Repertory: <span class="italic">Titus Andronicus</span> and James Saunders's <span class="italic">Next Time I'll Sing to You</span> in 1963, <span class="italic">The Quare Fellow</span> in 1964, and <span class="italic">Heartbreak House</span> in 1965. This production, together with his <span class="italic">Widowers' Houses</span> at Stratford East (1965), were credited with starting the so-called &#145;Shaw revival&#146; of the late 1960s. Productions of two plays by John McGrath at the Hampstead Theatre Club&#151;<span class="italic">Events while Guarding the Bofors Gun</span> (1966) and <span class="italic">Bakke's Night of Fame</span> (1968)&#151;took Eyre to the front rank of young directors. Interviewed by Montague Haltrecht after the first of these, he described the job of a director as &#145;putting actors in circumstances where the play works &hellip; creating an atmosphere in which people can function&#146;, and said that the special requirement of a director was &#145;the capacity to be surprised by people&#146;. He disliked the kind of directing that &#145;showed off&#146; at the expense of the play  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 11 June 1966). This perhaps accounted for his immense popularity with those he directed and the consistently high praise his productions received.<br>
<br>1970 was Eyre's <i>annus mirabilis</i>. His production of Donald Howarth's <span class="italic">Three Months Gone</span> at the Royal Court (starring Jill Bennett and Diana Dors) received excellent notices, and transferred to the Duchess. In June of the same year he directed his own reworking of Dion Boucicault's <span class="italic">London Assurance</span> for the Royal Shakespeare Company, with Donald Sinden as Sir Harcourt Courtly and Judi Dench as Grace Harkaway. Critics were unanimous in their praise. Harold Hobson called the production &#145;one of the RSC's outstanding successes&#146;. Success followed success in the early 1970s: <span class="italic">Mrs Warren's Profession</span> at the National Theatre (1970), <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span> at the Royal Shakespeare Company (1971), <span class="italic">A Voyage Round my Father</span>, starring Alec Guinness, in the West End (1971), and Charles Wood's comedy <span class="italic">Veterans</span> at the Royal Court (1972), with John Mills and John Gielgud as two dyspeptic actors. In 1973 he directed <span class="italic">Habeas corpus</span>, the first of his two encounters with new work by Alan Bennett (the second being <span class="italic">Enjoy</span> in 1980).<br>
<br>Eyre's muse was essentially comic. He relished the absurdity of human relationships&#151;the strange postures and pretences men assume in pursuit of dignity or power or money. He keenly observed the world around him, and in rehearsal could cite a dozen incidents to help an actor find the truth of some comic moment. He was also very funny, a gifted clown with a sharp, at times impatient wit. Tragedy sometimes seemed outside his reach. His <span class="italic">Othello</span> for the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1979 disappointed him, and it was this experience perhaps that made him suspicious of the Bard. He always claimed that the title of his great unwritten lecture was &#145;Shakespeare: not my friend&#146;.<br>
<br>From 1975 to 1977 Eyre worked on <span class="italic">The Long Search</span>, a landmark series for BBC2 on world religions. He was the programme's presenter, guide, and author. His research was tireless and exhaustive, his approach questioning but scrupulously non-judgemental. This project at once depended on and developed his interest in man's spiritual life, an interest that drew him to Shaw's <span class="italic">Saint Joan</span> at the National Theatre in 1984, to Ronald Harwood's <span class="italic">J. J. Farr</span> in the West End in 1987, and to a series of religious chat shows for television entitled <span class="italic">Not on Sunday</span> (1990&#150;91).<br>
<br>Eyre directed Berlioz's <span class="italic">Beatrice and Benedict</span> in 1980 at the Buxton festival. It was his first attempt at opera. One review described it as &#145;triumphant&#146;  (<span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, 4 Aug 1980), and another was headlined &#145;Miracle at Buxton&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, 10 Aug 1980). Again his instinct for comedy was sure. He edited the text, translated it into witty, accessible verse, set the whole thing <i>&agrave; la</i> Jane Austen, and&#151;for the spoken sections of the piece&#151;transformed great singers into great actors. In 1982 his production of Verdi's <span class="italic">Falstaff</span> for the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Covent Garden, and the Teatro Communale in Florence was hindered by a weight of expectation, and the grandness of Carlo Maria Giulini's return to the world of opera. Relieved of this double burden in a revival two years later, &#145;Ronald Eyre's exquisitely conceived production&#146;, according to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, had &#145;at last found itself&#146;.<br>
<br>The 1980s found Eyre in many places. There were plays, of course: the brilliant revival of John Osborne's <span class="italic">A Patriot for Me</span> at Chichester, in the West End, and then in Los Angeles (1983); another collaboration with Alec Guinness in Lee Blessing's <span class="italic">A Walk in the Woods</span> at the Comedy (1988); and one of his crowning achievements, <span class="italic">When we are Married</span> at the Whitehall (1986). On television he conducted an unfashionably low-key survey of the generations called <span class="italic">Seven Ages</span> (1987). And he taught: in California, at master classes in Oxford, and at the Hong Kong Academy of Performing Arts. One of his students at the latter recalled: &#145;He not only inspired us with regard to acting&#151;but taught us how to look at life, and face failure as well as success&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Hong Kong Academy of Performing Arts</span>, 1989).<br>
<br>Eyre felt lucky to be able to do so many different things, and believed that each part of his career gained from not being the exclusive occupation of his life. Fastidious in his choice of work, he gave the most scrupulous attention and commitment to those projects where he thought he might be &#145;useful&#146;. He was never motivated by a maverick ambition. &#145;It's not a form of modesty&#146;, he once said, &#145;to say that I lack ambition beyond the success of the current job. It's a fact. And in an odd way, I'm aware of the strength that gives me&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 Dec 1970). He was both explorer and guide. He wanted to understand things, and&#151;a wise and kind companion&#151;he knew how to share his discoveries with those around him.<br>
<br>Eyre's immensely successful life might be defined by the glittering prizes he turned down. He declined invitations to become head of drama at the BBC, artistic director of the Birmingham Repertory, artistic director of the Royal Court Theatre, and associate director at the Royal Shakespeare Company. He was merrily critical of organizations, and believed that the corporate life of an institution invariably became a drag on the quality of work it produced. He became instead a dedicated and mischievously independent freelance, bringing his wit, intellect, and perception to bear on the directing of plays, on teaching, on comparative religion, on broadcasting, and on the production and presentation of television documentaries.<br>
<br>Eyre died of cancer on 8 April 1992, at Southfield House, Vicarage Street, Painswick, Stroud, Gloucestershire, where he spent the last two months of his life. He was buried in the graveyard of St Mary's, Painswick, on 13 April. His gravestone recorded simply: &#145;Ron Eyre, 1929&#150;1992. On the long search&#146;. He was unmarried.<br>
