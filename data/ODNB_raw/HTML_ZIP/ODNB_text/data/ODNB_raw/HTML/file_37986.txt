<span class="headword">Smith,  William</span>  (1790&#150;1847), <span class="occ">merchant navy officer and Antarctic explorer</span>, was born on 11 October 1790 in Seaton Sluice, Northumberland, the elder child of William Smith, joiner, of Seaton Sluice, and his wife, Mary Sharpe, of Earsdon, Northumberland. Nothing is known about his early years and education but he was probably apprenticed aged fourteen to the east coast coal trade. In 1811 he became owner and master of the <i>Three Friends</i> of Blakeney, Norfolk, and in 1812 master of the brig <i>Williams</i> of Blyth, newly built for him. In the years 1812&#150;18 he traded to Europe and South America.<br>
<br>Smith sailed from Buenos Aires in mid-January 1819. In rounding Cape Horn he was driven into a high latitude, and on 19 February 1819 he wrote in his journal, &#145;in latitude 62&deg;40' S and longitude per Chronometer 60&deg;00' West, Land or Ice was discovered ahead bearing SEbS distant about two leagues, blowing hard gales with flying showers of snow&#146;  (Jones, 448). He named the place New South Britain, a name later changed to New South Shetland. What he had seen was Williams Point on Livingston Island, a black promontory that stood out from the ice cap. On returning to Valpara&iacute;so on 11 March 1819, he obtained no credence&#151;&#145;all ridiculed the poor man for his fanciful credulity and his deceptive vision&#146;  (Miers, 369). On his second voyage, in the winter (May&#150;June 1819), he saw nothing of New South Shetland. On his third voyage, from Montevideo, Smith saw the same point again on 15 October 1819, as well as Desolation Island. He took soundings, made a landing on North Foreland in King George Island, where he took possession, and examined the northern coast of the islands from east to west.<br>
<br>Smith returned to Valpara&iacute;so, where Captain William Shirreff RN ordered Edward Bransfield, a master in the Royal Navy, and three midshipmen to accompany Smith to survey the new land. On his fourth voyage Smith examined the north and south coasts of New South Shetland and, from 30 January 1820, part of the Antarctic continent, the Trinity Peninsula. They had thus sighted the continent a few days later than Bellingshausen's sighting in longitude 2&deg;15' W. Bransfield's manuscript chart is in the hydrographic department of the Admiralty. From this, in 1941 Lieutenant-Commander R. T. Gould RN was able to plot Smith's course in great detail, round New South Shetland and from Tower Island to the South Orkneys. In 1821 Smith made a fifth voyage to New South Shetland, but found British and American ships there, killing fur seals, which were almost exterminated in the next five years. He returned to London with the <i>Williams</i>, arriving with 30,000 sealskins worth &pound;7500. His owners were in difficulties and he was bankrupted. Smith published no account of his voyages, which were recorded only in his manuscript memorial and logbook and in a contemporary account by John Miers.<br>
<br>In 1824 Smith was a Thames pilot, and his licence was later extended to the Downs. The Trinity House records of the time describe him as 5 feet 8 inches tall, with black hair and dark complexion. In 1827&#150;30 he was master of the <i>William and Ann</i>, owned by James Weddell, in the Davis Strait's whale fishery; he had little success and did not go again. In these years he often changed his address in the East End of London. In 1838 he was rejected for a place in the Trinity House almshouse, being under age. In 1839 his pilot's licence was withdrawn as &#145;a pilot reduced by age and infirmity&#146;, and he was superannuated. Petitions to the Admiralty for remuneration for his discovery brought nothing. He died in May 1847 at 2 Hungerford Street, St George-in-the-East, London, the exact date not being known. His estate, valued at &pound;100, was left to his wife, Mary, about whom nothing is known. It is not known whether they had any children.<br>
