<span class="headword">Bonnycastle, Sir  Richard Henry</span>  (1791&#150;1847), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born on 30 September 1791 at Woolwich, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2855/', "Professor John Bonnycastle")</script> and his second wife, Bridget, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Johnstone. He studied at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, passing out as second lieutenant Royal Engineers on 28 September 1808, and becoming first lieutenant in 1809. He served at the siege of Flushing in 1809 in the Netherlands campaign, and in the Anglo-American War of 1812&#150;14, during which he was present at the capture of Fort Castine and the occupation of Maine east of the Penobscot, and was commanding engineer at the construction of the extensive works on the Castine peninsula. In 1814 he became captain, and in the same year married Frances, daughter of Captain W. Johnstone. They had two sons and three daughters. Subsequently he served with the army of occupation in France.<br>
<br>After service at home Bonnycastle was sent in 1826 to Upper Canada, serving at Fort George and at Kingston until 1832, when he was posted to York, in Toronto. He was keenly interested in colonial development, did original research in geology and mineralogy, and was a freemason and amateur artist. In 1837 he completed the construction of Fort Henry. As commanding royal engineer in Upper Canada he rendered crucial services during the uprising in 1837&#150;9, particularly in February 1838 when, at the head of an <i>ad hoc</i> force of militia, volunteers, sailors, and Mohawks&#151;in the absence of regular troops&#151;he defeated the attempt of the insurgents at Napanee, and of the brigands at Hickory Island, near Gananoque, to attack Kingston. For these services he was knighted in March 1840.<br>
<br>Bonnycastle was afterwards commanding engineer in Newfoundland. He became a brevet major in 1837 and a regimental lieutenant-colonel in 1840, and retired in 1847. His publications included <span class="italic">The Canadas in 1841</span> (2 vols., 1842), <span class="italic">Newfoundland in 1842</span> (2 vols., 1842), <span class="italic">Canada and the Canadians in 1846</span> (2 vols., 1846), and the posthumous <span class="italic">Canada as it was, is and may be</span> (2 vols., 1852). These were competent and informative, and helped attract immigrants and capital to Canada.<br>
<br>Bonnycastle died on 3 November 1847 at Kingston, in Canada. Liked and esteemed by Canadians, Bonnycastle was a fine example of a &#145;constructive imperial military officer&#146;  (<span class="italic">DCB</span>).<br>
