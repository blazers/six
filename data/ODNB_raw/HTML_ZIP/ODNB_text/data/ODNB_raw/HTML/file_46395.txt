<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Chisholm,  Catherine</span>  (1878&#150;1952), <span class="occ">paediatrician</span>, was born on 2 January 1878 at 10 Railway Street, Radcliffe, near Manchester, the first of two daughters of Kenneth Mackenzie Chisholm (<i>d</i>. 1902), a general practitioner, and his wife, Mary Thornley, the daughter of a Lancashire mill owner. She was educated at a local private school. Her father, an Edinburgh graduate, a respected family doctor, and a magistrate, was the major influence in her life. Sympathetic to the cause of women in medicine, he allowed his daughter to accompany him on his rounds and encouraged her to take up the study of medicine at a time when most medical schools admitted only male students. In 1895 she enrolled at Manchester University and graduated with a BA in classics in 1898; the following year she became the first female student to enter the Manchester medical school. As a student Chisholm played an active role in feminist politics, and was mainly responsible for the founding of the Women Students' and Athletics' Union in 1899. In 1904 she became the first woman to graduate in medicine (MB ChB) from the University of Manchester, gaining first-class certificates in forensic medicine, obstetrics, surgery, and pathology.<br>
<br>After graduation Chisholm spent a year as resident medical officer at the Clapham Maternity Hospital in London&#151;an institution founded by Annie McCall in 1887, and one of the few hospitals which employed only women doctors. This was followed by a further six months as medical officer at a children's sanatorium in Bingley, Yorkshire. In 1906 she returned to Manchester and set up in general practice near the university, drawing her patients from among the female students and middle-class women living in the area. Although Chisholm later specialized in child health she always maintained an interest in health issues which affected the lives of female students and working women, and was regarded as an authority on all aspects of women's health. She was medical inspector for girls for the Manchester education committee, women's medical officer for the university, and an adviser on the health of female workers for a number of Manchester organizations including the civil service and some insurance companies.<br>
<br>Chisholm's MD thesis on &#145;Menstrual molimina&#146; (1912) was an attempt to promote a healthy attitude to menstruation; she argued that schoolgirls and young women needed a sound knowledge of their physiology to counter the prejudice of old wives' tales. She was the school medical officer for the Manchester Girls' High School from 1908 to 1945, and the university medical officer for women students from 1918 to 1947&#151;positions which allowed her to influence attitudes to hygiene and sex education. Chisholm was devoted to the high school, where she was considered a role model as well as a medical adviser. She was a strong advocate of sports and gymnastics; in her book, <span class="italic">The Medical Inspection of Girls in Secondary Schools</span> (1914), she denied that competitive pressures at school were in any way detrimental to girls' health; in her view the best pupils often excelled both academically and on the sports field.<br>
<br>About 1912 Chisholm decided to specialize in children's diseases&#151;an area of medicine which at that time was dominated by male physicians and surgeons. In 1914 she was appointed as a children's physician at the Northern Hospital, a voluntary institution in Manchester, and also at Hope Hospital, a workhouse infirmary in Salford. Chisholm's medical work became increasingly interlinked with the infant welfare movement, and the campaign of feminist reformers in the Women's Citizens' Association to improve social conditions for women and children. James Niven, medical officer of health for Manchester, appointed her as a medical adviser on child health to the public health committee; together with Margaret Ashton, the committee's chairman, and Manchester's first woman city councillor, she helped to expand the health visitor service and introduce infant welfare clinics.<br>
<br>Chisholm opened the Manchester Babies' Hospital on 4 August 1914, established with financial help from Miss Ashton and the city council. The hospital became the main focus of her career as a consultant children's physician; she built a reputation for the care of very small and delicate babies, and she can be regarded as one of the founders of modern neonatology. During the 1920s she set about organizing the hospital of her dreams&#151;a service for children of all ages. A special ward for rickets, a human breast milk bank, laboratory, and teaching facilities, were all added. Chisholm's appointment as CBE in 1935 was an acknowledgement of her important contributions to child health; her hard work at the Babies' Hospital was further recognized by the duchess of York, who officially opened the new surgical block on 10 July 1935 and renamed the hospital the Duchess of York Hospital for Babies.<br>
<br>In addition to her work with sick children and a wide range of publications in the field of paediatrics, Chisholm made a significant contribution to improving the education and status of women doctors in Britain. The babies' hospital became one of the country's main women-run hospitals. Employing only women doctors, its medical posts were highly prized, and Chisholm trained more than 150 medical women at the hospital between 1914 and 1947. She was also mainly responsible for the foundation of the Medical Women's Federation in 1917, an organization established to counter sexual discrimination and protect women's interests within the medical profession. During her presidency (1928&#150;30) she greatly expanded the membership and increased the influence of the federation with the British Medical Association (BMA) and the Ministry of Health.<br>
<br>Munk's <span class="italic">Roll</span> described Chisholm as a strong feminist who could be counted on to support &#145;anything affecting the welfare of women and children likely to have a liberalising influence&#146;. She was an advocate for women's education, and a role model for young women doctors, the first woman to be chairman of the Manchester branch of the British Medical Association (1938), first woman president of the Manchester Medical Society (1943), founding president of the Manchester Paediatric Society (1948), first woman to be awarded an honorary fellowship from the Royal College of Physicians (1949), and first woman president of the British Paediatric Association (1950).<br>
<br>Politically she was Liberal and a suffragist, sympathetic to Margaret Ashton's feminist movement&#151;the North of England Society for Women's Suffrage. In 1914 Chisholm helped Miss Ashton and Mrs Shena Simon to found the Manchester and Salford Women's Citizens' Association (WCA), established to increase the role of women in local government. The WCA was a complex women's network which allowed Chisholm to link her different interests in public health, infant welfare, and women's rights. During the 1920s the WCA influenced the Manchester city council to introduce a number of municipal reforms, including infant welfare clinics, to improve the health of women and children.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Chisholm's work never slackened; indeed she took on extra work as senior consultant at Manchester's Booth Hall Children's Hospital. She persuaded Sir John Stopford, dean of the medical school, to admit more female medical students, and was influential in establishing Wilfred Gaisford as the first professor of paediatrics in Manchester. She retired in 1947 but continued to visit the Duchess of York Hospital until 1950.<br>
<br>Chisholm never married, but lived with her sister, Alice, at 34 Broadway, Withington, Manchester. She enjoyed entertaining a wide circle of medical friends, and her interests included hiking, swimming, driving, and music. She died at home from heart failure on 21 July 1952, and was cremated at the Manchester crematorium three days later.<br>
