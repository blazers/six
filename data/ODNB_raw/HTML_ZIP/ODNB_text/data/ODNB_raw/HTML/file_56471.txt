<span class="headword">Lanchester,  Edith</span>  (1871&#150;1966), <span class="occ">socialist and feminist</span>, was born at 1 St John's Terrace, Hove, Sussex, on 28 July 1871, the fifth child in the family of eight children of Henry Jones Lanchester (1834&#150;1914), an architect, and his wife, Octavia Ward (1834&#150;1916). Her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34388/', "Frederick William Lanchester (1868&#150;1946)")</script> formed the Lanchester Engine Company in 1899 and introduced the Lanchester motor car in 1901; another brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34389/', "George Herbert Lanchester (1874&#150;1970)")</script>, was also prominent in the firm. After attending the Birkbeck Institution and the Maria Grey training college, Edith (known to her intimates as Biddy) was first a teacher and then a clerk-secretary. When she came to prominence in October 1895 she was working for a firm in the City of London.<br>
<br>Edith Lanchester was a convinced socialist and a member of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), Britain's leading Marxist body, lodging in Battersea with working-class SDF comrades. Her celebrity or notoriety resulted from events which followed her announced intention to live with her lover, James Sullivan (<i>d</i>. 1945), without marrying him. Her view was that marriage reduced a wife to the position of a chattel. Sullivan, who was also an SDF member, worked in a black lead factory but he had intellectual ambitions and worked hard at self-education. He later became a short-hand typist and bookkeeper.<br>
<br>One can speculate on Edith's family's reaction had her lover been of a higher social class and not borne an Irish name. As it was, they were determined to stop the union. At the behest of her parents and brothers she was interviewed at her lodgings on 25 October 1895 by George Fielding Blandford, a leading mental specialist and the author of <span class="italic">Insanity and its Treatment</span> (1871; 4th edn, 1892). Although Blandford had warned in the book against mistaking immorality for irrationality he signed a medical certificate to confine her to a mental institution. Under section 11 of the <span class="roman">Lunacy Act</span> of 1890 a single certificate was adequate for seven days' compulsory incarceration in cases of urgency, but a second certificate was obtained shortly afterwards. Dr Blandford explained that as he would have certified her if she had threatened suicide, he was justified in preventing her from trying to commit &#145;social suicide&#146;. Edith forcibly resisted her father and brothers, but in the end she was dragged off to a carriage and driven to The Priory institution, Roehampton.<br>
<br>The affair led to enormous publicity and the intervention of John Burns, MP for Battersea and formerly a member of the SDF. The <span class="italic">New York Times</span> commented (3 November 1895) that the affair had &#145;rivet[ed] the attention of three kingdoms&#146; and that &#145;[n]o penny paper had printed less than ten columns on this engrossing subject during the week&#146;. But according to the report of the commissioners of lunacy, when the papers on the case were put before them on Monday 28 October it was the first they had heard of Edith Lanchester. They took care, however, to visit her at Roehampton the same afternoon, conducted an &#145;interview of some duration&#146; and &#145;satisfied themselves that she was not then insane&#146;. She was freed the following day under section 75 of the <span class="roman">Lunacy Act</span>, as a patient &#145;detained without sufficient cause&#146;  (<span class="italic">Report</span>, 53). She had been in the institution for four days.<br>
<br>Lanchester and Sullivan continued to live together without ever marrying, though socialist and feminist opinion in 1895 suggested that in the conditions of existing society it would have been more sensible to do so. For a period Edith was employed in a clerical capacity by Karl Marx's daughter Eleanor.<br>
<br>The couple paid a considerable price for their refusal to observe the conventions. According to their daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57311/', "Elsa Lanchester (1902&#150;1986)")</script>, the actress whose autobiography is the source for her mother's later life, Edith never saw her father again. (Perhaps she would not have done so even if she had married Sullivan.) She did, however, re-establish friendly relations with her mother, who left her &pound;400. Her socialist, vegetarian, and atheist beliefs may have contributed to alienating her daughter, who wrote that she was never able to like her mother  (Lanchester, 5, 11, 32, 49, 314).<br>
<br>Edith Lanchester was a militant though apparently not very active supporter of women's suffrage. She was a pacifist during the First World War and afterwards joined the Communist Party. She assisted her son Waldo, who after release from prison as a conscientious objector became a puppet maker and weaver. After James Sullivan's death in 1945 Edith moved to Brighton where she spent the remainder of her long life. Elsa wrote that she remained a communist, displaying posters outside her Brighton flat, and attending political meetings so long as she was physically active enough to walk to the bus  (ibid., 316&#150;17). Edith Lanchester died at her home, 18 Highcroft Villas, Brighton, Sussex, on 26 March 1966.<br>
<br>The Lanchester affair had no immediate impact on the lunacy laws, for there was no major legislation until 1959. After the public obloquy to which Dr Blandford had been subjected in 1895 the laws may have been interpreted with more care, at least where middle-class women were concerned. Edith Lanchester's action in defying social convention and her own family at whatever cost was one of many gestures by women in the 1890s to increase their freedom and civil rights. As such she deserves to be remembered as a pioneer of the freedom of her sex.<br>
