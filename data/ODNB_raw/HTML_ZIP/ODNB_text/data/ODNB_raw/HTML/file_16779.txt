<span class="headword">Littler, Sir  John Hunter</span>  (1783&#150;1856), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, eldest son of Thomas Littler and his wife, Diana, daughter of John Hunter, a director of the East India Company, was born on 6 January 1783 at Tarvin, Cheshire, where his family had been established for many generations. He was educated under the Revd Dr Devonport at the grammar school at Acton, near Nantwich. On 19 August 1800 he was appointed ensign in the 10th Bengal native infantry, and in that regiment became lieutenant on 29 November the same year, captain on 16 December 1812, and major on 22 September 1824. He went out to India in the Indiaman <i>Kent</i>, which was captured by a French privateer in the Bay of Bengal. The passengers were set adrift in a pinnace, but arrived safely at their destination. Littler served with his regiment in the campaigns under Lord Lake in 1804&#150;5 and at the reduction of Java in 1811, returning to India in 1816. He then served as sub-assistant commissary-general in the marquess of Hastings's army, continuing in the post until 1824. Littler had previously been married, and on 25 June 1827 married, at Benares, Helen Olympia (<i>d</i>. 12 Jan 1885), only daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Stewart, a claimant of the Orkney peerage; they had four daughters. After his death, in 1858 she married Thomas Aston Cokayne.<br>
<br>Littler became lieutenant-colonel of the 14th Bengal native infantry in 1828, and colonel of the 36th Bengal native infantry in 1839, the colonelcy of which he retained until his death. In 1841 he was promoted major-general, and in 1843 was appointed to command the Agra division of the Bengal army. He commanded a division of Sir Hugh Gough's army at the defeat of the Gwalior army at Maharajpur on 29 December 1843, where he was slightly wounded and had two horses killed under him. He received for his services the thanks of parliament and the Gwalior star, and was made KCB on 2 May 1844. At the outbreak of the First Anglo-Sikh War in 1845 he was in command of the Ferozepore division. Leaving half his troops to protect the cantonment, he marched with the rest to meet the Sikhs when they first crossed the Sutlej on 11 December, but they declined the challenge, although they considerably outnumbered Littler's force, and turned aside to Ferozeshahr. Littler effected a junction with Gough's army on 21 December 1845, and at the battle of Ferozeshahr on 21&#150;2 December commanded a division, and again had a horse killed under him, receiving once more the thanks of parliament. At the close of the campaign he was appointed to command at Lahore. In 1848 he was appointed to the supreme council of India, and was made GCB and deputy governor of Bengal. Littler returned home, with the rank of lieutenant-general, in 1851. The remainder of his life was passed in retirement at his seat, Bigaden, Buckfastleigh, near Totnes, Devon, where he died on 18 February 1856. He was buried at Tarvin, Cheshire.<br>
