<span class="headword">Christie,  Malcolm Grahame</span>  (1881&#150;1971), <span class="occ">intelligence officer</span>, was born on 27 January 1881 at Richmond Hill Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, the son of John Alexander Christie, a bank manager from London, and his wife, Annabelle Findley. He was educated at Malvern College and at the University of Aachen, where he obtained the degree of Doktor Ingenieur, with first-class honours in chemistry. He subsequently worked for a German company manufacturing coke ovens, as general manager of its English branch in Leeds. He was an early aviator, first taking to the air before 1910. On the outbreak of the First World War he naturally joined the Royal Flying Corps, transferring to the Royal Air Force on its foundation on 1 April 1918. He stayed in the service until 1930, serving as air attach&eacute; first in Washington, DC (1922&#150;6) and then in Berlin (1927&#150;30). Illness then forced his early retirement.<br>
<br>Christie never abandoned the belief, produced by his wartime experience, that Germany constituted a permanent threat to Britain, reporting on the German clandestine rearmament during the period of the Weimar republic and writing numerous warning reports after the final withdrawal of British occupying forces from the Rhineland in 1930. On retirement he continued his observation of German revanchism, using his reputation as a pioneer airman to meet Hermann Goering and, through him, Adolf Hitler in 1932. By 1934 his reports on German secret rearmament in breach of the treaty of Versailles had caught the attention of Sir Robert Vansittart, the permanent under-secretary to the Foreign Office, whose apprehension over German revisionism had already led him to bombard the cabinet with lengthy memoranda on the German threat and to press for British rearmament. Thereafter, Christie developed what amounted to a private intelligence service for Vansittart.<br>
<br>Some of his sources were overt senior figures in the German air ministry and Luftwaffe, such as Erwin Milch, Goering's deputy. Others he identified only by codenames or initials in his notes, all of which he set down in German. To judge from those that can be identified, his contacts seem to have been exclusively with members of the German conservative bureaucratic and military opposition to Hitler from whose ranks eventually came the unsuccessful attempt on Hitler's life in July 1944. It was through Christie that Vansittart was first put in touch with Konrad Henlein, leader of the Sudeten German Party in Czechoslovakia, and with Karl Goerdeler, the former mayor of Leipzig, who was to die for his part in the July 1944 conspiracy. It was from Christie that Vansittart received a warning of the imminent German remilitarization of the Rhineland in March 1936. Later in that same year he provided accurate figures of the rate of German rearmament in the air. They proved unacceptable to the air ministry for nearly a year, by which time his source had disappeared.<br>
<br>In 1938, through the Sudeten German princeling Prinz von Hohenlohe, Christie conveyed to Vansittart Henlein's apparent dissatisfaction with Hitler's policy over the Sudetenland and held out the prospect of a Czech agreement with the Sudeten Germans which would have led to Henlein being able to compete for the premiership of Czechoslovakia rather than suffering the fate of becoming gauleiter of a minor German province. This prospect encouraged Lord Runciman's mediatory mission to Czechoslovakia in July 1938. Only the extremist leader Karl Frank, encouraged by the SS (rather than by the German foreign ministry, as Henlein was), could look with equanimity on the prospect of a German&#150;Czech war in which the Sudetenland itself would be left a devastated battlefield.<br>
<br>After the Munich agreement of 30 September 1938, Christie's informants were at least in part responsible for the war scare of the third week in January 1939 which led to the adoption for the first time by a British cabinet in peacetime of a commitment of the British army to a continental war, to the subsequent doubling of the Territorial Army, and then in April 1939 to conscription. By then army and naval intelligence and other members of the Foreign Office had developed their own contacts with reluctant German diplomats and generals ridden by anxiety that a war between Germany and Britain would lead to Germany's defeat. Once war broke out, Christie's sources were involved for a time in the many different approaches made to Britain by sections of the German opposition to Hitler. But Winston Churchill's assumption of the premiership in May 1940 and the defeat of France led to an atmosphere in which such approaches were declared unwelcome, the more so as it became difficult from a British viewpoint to distinguish between Hitler's achievements and the opposition's conditions for making an attempt to overthrow him. From May 1940 Vansittart's private intelligence activities, and with them Christie's work, fade from the scene.<br>
<br>Christie was to survive to the age of ninety. However, apart from a privately printed memoir by T. P. Conwell-Evans, one of his former British collaborators, <span class="italic">None so Blind</span> (1947), his role in obtaining intelligence about Nazi Germany remained unknown until his family deposited his papers in Churchill College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>On the German side, Christie's status as a semi-official contact with British authorities seems to have been an open secret, though he was never, as is often stated, a member either of the Secret Intelligence Service or of the &#145;Z&#146; organization. The question as to how far he was a victim of deliberate misinformation (as for example in the case of the Hohenlohe&#150;Henlein contacts or in some of his early information from Erwin Milch) remains open and probably always will. Nor was he the sole source of Vansittart's remarkable intelligence from Europe. But his steady and accurate reportage had a great deal to do with Vansittart's uncanny ability accurately to predict the development of German foreign policy, the more so as Britain's official Secret Intelligence Service was crippled by lack of funds and by the successive loss of and penetration of its principal centres of attack on the German target.<br>
<br>Little is known about Christie's later years. However, according to his obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, he devoted his energy and private means to encouraging young musicians &#145;in their early struggle for recognition&#146;. He threw himself from a window on 3 November 1971 and was found dead on arrival at St Stephen's Hospital, Chelsea, London.<br>
