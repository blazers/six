<span class="headword">Sinclair, Sir  Robert, of Stevenson</span>, third baronet, Lord Stevenson  (1643&#150;1713), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 15 October 1643, the younger son of Mr John Sinclair, fiar of Stevenson, Haddingtonshire, and Isabel, daughter of Robert Boyd, sixth Lord Boyd. He succeeded his grandfather and his elder brother John as third baronet on 5 July 1652. His lands of Stevenson were ratified to him by parliament on 4 June 1663, and he obtained a further charter of the lands of Carfrae, Haddingtonshire, on 28 June 1670.<br>
<br>Sinclair was one of the counsel for the defence at the trial of the marquess of Argyll in 1661. He was appointed a commissioner of excise and a justice of the peace for Haddingtonshire on 1 March 1670. In the same year he seems to have aspired to the office of lord advocate, but in this hope he was disappointed. On 29 July 1680 Sinclair was &#145;pannelled&#146; and rebuked before the privy council &#145;for seditiously and factiously opposing, at least obstructing his Majesty's service in putting the act of Privy Council to execution for levying 5,500 men out of the militia&#146;  (Lauder, 1.111). He was a commissioner of supply for Haddingtonshire in 1678, 1685, 1689, 1690, and 1704.<br>
<br>At the revolution Sinclair represented Haddington constabulary in the convention of estates and subsequent parliament, serving in this capacity from 1689 to 1702. In March 1689 he subscribed both the act declaring the convention to be a free and lawful meeting of the estates, and the letter of congratulation to King William. He was appointed to a number of parliamentary committees, and appears to have regularly attended, apparently supporting Melville's party in its struggle with the &#145;Club&#146;  (Melville, 194, 202). On 7 December 1689 he was appointed sheriff of Haddingtonshire, a privy councillor in May following, and one of the lords of exchequer. He was also named a lord of session as Lord Stevenson, but through his &#145;uncommon modesty&#146;  (Brunton and Haig, 441), he never took his seat, although he remained some years in the nomination, and at his final resignation of this office was succeeded by Sir William Hamilton of Whitelaw, on 29 December 1693. On 17 July 1695 he was granted the right to hold two yearly fairs and a weekly market at Pencaitland Wester. Following the accession of Queen Anne, in 1703 he was again nominated a privy councillor.<br>
<br>Stevenson was twice married: first, at the palace of Holyroodhouse, on 10 September 1663, to Lady Helen, daughter of John Lindsay, seventeenth earl of Crawford, with whom he had six sons and three daughters, and second, to Anne, daughter of Sir William Scott of Ardross, widow of Sir Daniel Carmichael of Mauldslie; they had no children. His daughter Margaret married Robert Dundas, second Lord Arniston, and was mother and grandmother to two successive lord presidents of the court of session who bore that title. Stevenson died in July 1713, and was succeeded by his son Sir John, as fourth baronet, his testament being confirmed at Edinburgh in December.<br>
