<span class="headword">Tuttell,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1674&#150;1702), <span class="occ">maker of mathematical instruments</span>, was the son of William Tuttell, a member of the Cordwainers' Company of London. He was apprenticed to Henry Wynne of the Clockmakers' Company on 2 April 1688 and freed seven years later, on 1 July 1695. The same year he set up a workshop at the sign of the King's Arms and Globe at Charing Cross, and began making and selling mathematical instruments in his own right. He advertised a full range of navigational, calculational, astronomical, and surveying instruments, and also sold globes and barometers. Between June 1697 and August 1699 he took three apprentices.<br>
<br>Tuttell's position as one of the foremost makers was soon established. Shortly after gaining his freedom he secured the patronage of Colonel William Parsons of the foot guards, and by 1698 his business was strong enough to have opened a new shop beside the Royal Exchange in Cornhill. More importantly, he had also received a royal appointment as mathematical instrument maker to the king.<br>
<br>In 1698 Tuttell published a short book, entitled <span class="italic">The Description and Uses of a New Contriv'd Eliptical Double Dial</span>, in which he described a form of analemmatic sundial which he had recently devised. While concentrating on explaining this dial (which consisted of a horizontal dial and an elliptical projection of the equatorial dial into the plane of the horizon), the book also contains a description of the universal equinoctial ring dial. Both were carefully explained by Tuttell and, as an aid to the user, he included a table of towns with their latitudes as an appendix.<br>
<br>In the introduction to this work, Tuttell declared his intention of writing a further book which would explain the uses of the various mathematical instruments then in use, and which he felt were not sufficiently covered in contemporary mathematical texts. This project was realized in a collaboration with James Moxon, son of the mathematician Joseph Moxon. In the 1701 edition of Joseph Moxon's <span class="italic">Mathematical Dictionary</span> James Moxon and Tuttell appended a short lexicon of mathematical instruments. Not only were the instruments described in some detail, but many of them were illustrated on a plate, very similar in style to Tuttell's later trade cards. The instruments also appeared on a set of playing cards which Tuttell issued in 1701 and which included an advertisement on the king of clubs.<br>
<br>At some point in 1700 Tuttell was appointed as hydrographer to the king, and during the following year he carried out surveys on the west coast of England. He was in the process of surveying the Thames when he was drowned in that river on 22 January 1702. His widow placed a notice in the <span class="italic">Post Boy</span>, describing him as being &#145;of Middle Stature, fair light Hair but his Head newly shaved&#146; and requesting his body to be returned to her if it was found  (<span class="italic">Post Boy</span>).<br>
<br>Despite his very early death, Tuttell held an important position among the makers of mathematical instruments. He was versatile enough to work not only in brass and silver, but also in wood and ivory. Those instruments of his which survive show evidence of the high quality of his workmanship. However, Tuttell was not only an instrument maker: he designed instruments and taught their use, was an able surveyor, and a competent author on mathematical subjects. In just seven years he established himself as a central figure in the mathematical community of which he was a part.<br>
