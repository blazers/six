<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thistlewood,  Arthur</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1774, <em>d.</em> 1820), <span class="occ">radical and revolutionary</span>, was baptized at Horsington parish church, near Horncastle, Lincolnshire, on 4 December 1774. He was the illegitimate son of William Thistlewood, a stock breeder, and Ann Burnet, a small shopkeeper. He probably attended Horncastle Free Grammar School and subsequently trained as a land surveyor. However, in 1795 he is recorded as a grazier of Tupholme, and subsequently he was an ensign in the 1st West Yorkshire militia, July 1798 to February 1799; for a similarly short period in 1803 he held a commission in the 3rd Lincolnshire militia. Claims for his first marriage differ: he may have married a Miss Bruce of Bawtry in 1791/1792, or Jane Worsley of Lincoln in January 1804. Both women are said to have been wealthy, with a fortune reverting to their family after death in childbirth within two years of marriage. A son, Julian, credited to both the 1804 marriage and an illicit liaison, was accepted by Susan Wilkinson, a Horncastle butcher's daughter whom Thistlewood married in 1808. About this time he is said to have inherited a large estate which he sold in return for an annuity, but the purchaser went bankrupt almost immediately. An attempt at farming was also a financial disaster.<br>
<br>Information concerning Thistlewood's early life is confused and some picaresque details should probably be discounted, including his service as a captain with the French grenadiers. This seems to have been his own invention, of which he made much after arriving around 1810&#150;11 in London, where he quickly made the acquaintance of leading radicals, especially the circle round the agrarian reformer Thomas Spence. There he found an ideological framework for his embittered personal experience of financial difficulty and thwarted aspirations: &#145;The Mammonites have swayed us too long, we must have no property mongering jugglers, they have always entailed misery on the most industrious and useful people in every nation&#146;  (J. Watson to A. Thistlewood, 24 July 1818, TNA: PRO, HO 42/178). In 1811 he was secretary to a committee for the defence of an Irish radical journalist charged with libelling Castlereagh, Peter Finnerty. In 1812&#150;13 he was closely involved with a shadowy group that proposed to send an emissary to Paris inviting Napoleon to invade Britain and restore the Saxon constitution. Thistlewood's role was to finance the enterprise out of a rumoured windfall of &pound;10,000 in a chancery case, but the plan folded when the money did not materialize. Ostensibly bizarre, the aim is intelligible within the context of English radicalism's long tradition of Saxon constitutionalism, and the plan was scrutinized closely by the government. Thereafter Thistlewood's activities are well documented in official papers. One spy presciently observed that he was &#145;quite the gentleman in manners and appearance &hellip; from his past life, his present pursuits, principles and low connections etc he seems to be a second edition of Colonel Despard&#146;  (J. Smith to J. Beckett (Home Office), 8 Feb 1813, TNA: PRO, HO 42/136). In 1814 he visited a number of Jacobin &eacute;migr&eacute;s in Paris, among them William McCabe, the United Irish agent.<br>
<br>The peak of the Spenceans' influence came in late 1816, when they briefly secured the leadership of the parliamentary reform movement in London. Henry Hunt was invited by them to address a mass meeting at Spa Fields on 2 December, but agreed to do so only on condition that explicitly Spencean material in their address was deleted. To this the organizing committee, of which Thistlewood and Dr James Watson were leading members, agreed, primarily because it was their intention to use the occasion to foment widespread unrest in the capital that might signal the commencement of a general rising to the country at large. Ground had been laid for this by extensive agitation among taverns and barracks in the capital, and via an extensive correspondence with provincial centres where radicals held themselves in readiness. McCabe returned clandestinely for the meeting. In the event the majority of Hunt's audience remained peaceable, but a sizeable element were responsible for several hours of rioting in the City, while a small force with Thistlewood at its head marched on the Tower of London and demanded its surrender. Only at nightfall was order restored.<br>
<br>There was no immediate crackdown by the government, largely because of the need to keep intact its intelligence network, but early in 1817 habeas corpus was suspended and warrants issued for the arrest of the leading Spenceans. Thistlewood remained at liberty until May, when he was arrested while preparing to leave for America with his family. Along with Watson and two other Spenceans he was charged with high treason. Watson was acquitted in June 1817, however, when the crown's chief witness was exposed as a pimp, perjurer, and plausible <i>provocateur</i>, and the case against the others was withdrawn. Throughout the remainder of 1817 their activities continued, but with Watson increasingly inclined towards open constitutionalism and Thistlewood to a <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> to expedite their objectives. Fresh plans were devised for destabilizing the capital, with St Bartholomew's fair on 6 September the cloak to proceedings. Emissaries were sent into the country and plans made to storm the Bank of England. The plot was real enough&#151;the home secretary, Sidmouth, compared it directly to the Despard conspiracy&#151;but it was defeated by a combination of deft official action and the over-optimism of the protagonists.<br>
<br>The failure prompted Thistlewood to air the idea of an attack on the privy council &#145;in the manner of Despard&#146;  (J. Shegoe to N. Conant, 18 Sept 1817, TNA: PRO, HO 42/170). A further action was planned for 11 October, which dissolved in circumstances approaching farce. Fearful of police surveillance, most of the Spencean circle reverted to tavern-based agitation and publication. Thistlewood struck off on a course of his own, challenging Sidmouth to a duel over the non-return of confiscated property. The dispute had already been the subject of <span class="italic">An interesting correspondence between Thistlewood and Sidmouth concerning the property detained, in consequence of an arrest, on a charge of high treason</span> (1817). The challenge resulted in May 1818 in a twelve-month gaol sentence for threatening a breach of the peace. This Thistlewood served, in circumstances of some severity, in Horsham gaol.<br>
<br>After his release Thistlewood organized with Watson a lavish London reception for Hunt on 5 September 1819, after &#145;Peterloo&#146;. Their involvement compromised Hunt's constitutional stance and this, along with a dispute about radical tactics after Peterloo, led to a damaging public dispute between them. A few days before Peterloo, Thistlewood had proposed a rising. He now began to formulate what would become known as the Cato Street conspiracy [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58584/', "Cato Street conspirators (act. 1820)")</script>]. He visited the provinces, while the Spenceans intensified agitation in London. Though the key conspirators included a spy, George Edwards, the wider web of those implicated in Cato Street will never be clear: the London Irish community and a number of trade societies, notably shoemakers, were prepared to lend support, while unrest and awareness of a planned rising were widespread in the industrial north and on Clydeside.<br>
<br>Thistlewood intended to assassinate the cabinet at the home of the earl of Harrowby, where the cabinet was advertised as going to dine on 23 February 1820. The advertisement, however, was an official hoax. The conspirators were apprehended in a loft in Cato Street by Bow Street runners and a detachment of guards around 8.30 that night. In the struggle that followed, one police officer, Richard Smithers, was killed with a rapier by Thistlewood, who then escaped, only to be captured the following morning. In all, thirteen conspirators were arrested and charged with high treason. Two turned king's evidence, which removed the need for the crown to call Edwards as a witness. The case against one prisoner was dropped. After three days' trial, on 17, 18, and 19 April, Thistlewood was found guilty and sentenced to a traitor's death. Five conspirators were transported, while Thistlewood and four others were hanged, publicly decapitated, and buried at Newgate on 1 May 1820.<br>
