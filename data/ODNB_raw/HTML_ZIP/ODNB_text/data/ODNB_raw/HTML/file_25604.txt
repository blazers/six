<span class="headword">Simson,  John</span>  (1667&#150;1740), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and theologian</span>, was born at Cambaston, Scotland, on 13 July 1667, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67858/', "Patrick Simson (1628&#150;1715)")</script>, minister of Renfrew, and his second wife, Janet Cullen (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Peadie) (<i>bap</i>. 1635, <i>d</i>. 1714). After receiving his MA from Edinburgh University in 1692 he studied divinity at Glasgow University, where he was bibliothecary and quaestor by December 1693, and appeared on the divinity rolls of 5 February 1694. In 1695 the burgh of Glasgow reappointed him bibliothecary, but he left for the Netherlands in August 1696 to pursue his theological studies. Since Simson later claimed to have studied under Jan Marck (1656&#150;1731), his destination was presumably Leiden. After returning to Scotland in 1697 he passed his trials, signed the Westminster confession of faith, and received his licence to preach from the presbytery of Paisley on 13 July 1698. Although Simson admitted to scruples about the way the confession dealt with the covenant of works and about some of its wording, he stressed that one must &#145;be satisfied with the Truth of every Proposition and Consequence contained in it&#146; in order to subscribe  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 7).<br>
<br>In September 1698 Simson re-embarked for the Netherlands as tutor to John, son of Francis Montgomery of Giffin. They spent two years in Utrecht, then travelled home slowly via Flanders, France, and England. Back in Scotland, Simson acted as assistant to his father in Renfrew until he received a call to the parish of Troqueer (presbytery of Dumfries) in July 1705. He was ordained at Troqueer on 20 September 1705, and served there for the next three years. On 10 April 1708 the University of Glasgow elected him professor of divinity. The commission of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland agreed to his transportation from Troqueer to Glasgow on 7 July, and his formal admission to the chair took place on 10 November of that year. On 31 October 1710 he married Jean Stirling (<i>c</i>.1691&#150;1782), daughter of James Stirling, minister, and niece of Glasgow University's principal, John Stirling, by whom they were married; they had fourteen children born between 1712 and 1735 of whom all but three died in childhood.<br>
<br>Enlightened in outlook and familiar with reformed theology on the continent, Simson introduced into the Glasgow divinity school the work of Marck, along with that of the contemporary Genevan theologian Benedict Pictet. He expounded the Westminster confession, noting its differences from other reformed systems and its superiority to them. His students were allowed considerable latitude of argument in making presentations, refuting Christian writers from various denominations, and having group discussions on difficult scriptural passages. His teaching was based on a belief in the benevolence of God and an assurance that a loving creator would never deny his creatures the means of salvation, which could be discovered through the exercise of reason. Simson's efforts to make such a God conform to late seventeenth-century Scottish Presbyterian orthodoxy led to confrontation with devout zealots shortly after his arrival in Glasgow. The ensuing debates produced a wealth of polemic writing and became entangled with political rivalries.<br>
<br>The first suggestions of unsound teaching were made in 1710 by the orthodox Edinburgh minister James Webster. Apparently satisfied by Simson's explanation of his teaching on the imputation of original sin, political differences over the <span class="roman">Act of Abjuration</span> (1712) led Webster to a more extreme position. When he charged Simson with unsound doctrine, the 1714 general assembly of the Church of Scotland sent the case to a committee chaired by William Carstares. Webster's publication (1716?) of Simson's correspondence with Robert Rowan, minister of Penningham, added fuel to the flames. There Simson justified his teaching on federal theology as well as his political views on the <span class="roman">Act of Abjuration</span>. Simson's opponents were further alarmed by his refutation of Webster's libel, published in 1716, which reflected his sympathy with the possibility of salvation. Simson's views included an insistence on the likelihood of more souls being elect than reprobate and the probable election of deceased infants, an aversion to the contractual nature of federal theology, and a belief that in hell sinning would cease, as well as an interest in current astronomical discussion leading him to suggest that the moon might be inhabited. The presbytery of Glasgow and Simson's academic colleagues stood firm behind him, united in their political allegiance to the squadrone, whereas Webster was an Argathelian, supporting the Campbells of Argyll. The general assembly of 1717 determined that Simson had merely been guilty of imprudent expressions, which he should avoid in future: a mild reprimand and a victory for the squadrone managers. In Glasgow, however, the Argathelians succeeded in securing the transportation of John Anderson to a city church against the wishes of the squadrone's presbytery members, causing Simson, in a sermon in May, to speak of &#145;breaking the hearts of five honest men to please one man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of &hellip; Wodrow</span>, 2.272).<br>
<br>In matters of ecclesiastic or academic discipline Simson was authoritarian. His study of Samuel Clarke's work on the Trinity and of patristic writers caused new controversy in the mid-1720s. This enthusiasm for research led to rumours that he had adopted Clarke's semi-Arianism, and that within his strict rules of classroom propriety his divinity students had too much freedom of debate. At about the same time Simson was afflicted with an intestinal disorder which sapped his strength. Ill health limited his ability to teach and to defend himself when in 1726 he was accused by the presbytery of Glasgow of making statements in his lectures which seemed to have an Arian tendency. Simson responded that he had come to believe that the Church of Scotland verged on the modalistic heresy of Sabellianism. He said that he now emphasized in his teaching the personal properties of each person in the Trinity to maintain their individual qualities. He assured his colleagues that he adhered to the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and the Westminster confession, using their terminology in his lectures. The matter was taken to the general assembly, which appointed a committee to investigate Simson's teaching in co-operation with the presbytery of Glasgow, full details of which were published by the Church of Scotland. Simson reiterated his orthodoxy, and the depositions of his students were inconclusive.<br>
<br>A new pamphlet war between ultra-orthodox and liberal presbyterians resulted in deep divisions in the church. Political realities again affected the outcome. The Argathelians, under the earl of Ilay, were now the dominant faction; Simson returned to his family's traditional support of the Campbells. Appreciating that fanatics made ineffective political allies Ilay opposed any increase in power for the ultra-conservative group. Fear of English interference in Scottish ecclesiastical affairs also played a part in the eventual compromise decision (1729) supported by Ilay to suspend, but not depose, Simson. After Simson's supporters failed in 1730 to have his suspension reversed he continued to live in his university house and act as a member of the Glasgow faculty, although not teaching publicly, until his death on 2 February 1740.<br>
<br>Simson's cases formed a watershed in the development of the Church of Scotland in the eighteenth century. Their significance lies less in the fate of Simson than in the effect they had on the church. The secession of 1733 was partly brought about by the dismay at what the extreme group considered Simson's lenient punishment. Freed from the restrictions imposed by the ultra-orthodox, the church embraced Enlightenment ideals while upholding Calvinist Christianity.<br>
