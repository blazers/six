<span class="headword">Stuart, Lady  Louisa</span>  (1757&#150;1851), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born on 12 August 1757, the youngest of the eleven children of George III's prime minister, John Stuart, third earl of Bute (1713&#150;1792). Her mother, Mary (1718&#150;1794), to whom she was greatly attached, was the daughter of Edward Wortley Montagu of Wortley and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19029/', "Lady Mary Wortley Montagu")</script>. The presence of this grandmother was a notable element in her rich dynastic background, with its royal blood and its interlocking Stuarts, Scotts, and Campbells, but a &#145;tainted&#146; one too, as she confided in a letter  (<span class="italic">Letters &hellip; to Miss Louisa Clinton</span>, 2.354). No such suggestion figures in her important &#145;Introductory anecdotes&#146;, concerning Lady Mary, which was published anonymously in 1837. By the age of ten she had begun to take after her grandmother, having embarked upon a French novel and planned a Roman play, and she was to feel threatened by brothers who teased her for her sensibility and learning. &#145;Such are men&#146;, she once sighed, with reference to the brother of her closest female friend, Frances Scott, eventually Lady Douglas  (Miller, 29). Louisa's own brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64138/', "John Stuart, first marquess of Bute")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26697/', "Sir Charles Stuart (1753&#150;1801)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26727/', "William Stuart, archbishop of Armagh")</script>.<br>
<br>In 1765 Lady Louisa's father retired from a bruising experience of political life to the grandeur and seclusion of Luton Hoo and the pursuit of botany. He is understood to have forbidden her marriage to a second cousin, the distinguished soldier William Medows, who campaigned against Tipu Sultan in the Carnatic and took part in the seizure of Seringapatam. She was thought to have worn mourning clothes at his death in 1813.<br>
<br>Lady Louisa Stuart was a gifted writer who hoped, for reasons of caste, never to see her name in print, and it was not until the 1890s that writings of hers were published under her name. Her memoirs and letters are addressed in the main to women&#151;friends and relatives. One of her correspondents was Walter Scott, who, while no immediate relation to these Scotts of Dalkeith Palace, nevertheless saw himself as feudally bound to their dukes of Buccleuch. Scott valued her taste and talent, together with her far descent (Lockhart's <span class="italic">Life of Scott</span> contains several of her letters). Conscious of his poetry, and of that of Pope and Samuel Johnson, she wrote a number of poems of her own&#151;among them elegant, sententious fables, and a ballad about cannibal brothers and an ill-starred woman who marries for money.<br>
<br>Stuart's accounts of Lady Douglas and of Lady Mary Coke are magnificent pieces of writing. The first is an evocation of her friend&#151;a granddaughter of John, second duke of Argyll, and a pattern of afflicted virtue. Frances had to suffer the aversion of her mother, Lady Dalkeith, and was to be shielded from it by her mother's second husband, the brilliant and unstable politician Charles Townsend, whose customs duties hastened the loss of the American colonies. George III  (Miller, 42) was said to have thought him the worst man in the world. Stuart sees him in a sympathetic light, while relating that a dangerous intimacy developed between Frances and her stepfather, and that she had to flee the stressful south of England for the palace of Dalkeith in order to marry her &#145;safe man&#146;  (ibid., 38), in the person of Archibald, Lord Douglas, the claimant in the celebrated lawsuit over the right to the Douglas estates.<br>
<br>The memoir of Lady Mary Coke, dated 1827, also presents&#151;this time in comic vein&#151;a pattern of afflicted virtue. She is seen as a tragedy queen, as a woman subject to paranoid delusions, but as also subject to house arrest at the hands of a brutal husband. Later she was to suffer the imaginary machinations of the empress Maria Theresa; she believed herself, reported Horace Walpole, to have been robbed of a passage by sea from Ostend to England by a codicil in the empress queen's will. Lady Mary was her own woman:<blockquote>The dry rot that broke out in her house was totally different in its nature from the dry-rot at her next neighbour's; and in case of a cold, or a sore throat, woe to the apothecary who ventured to quicken her pulse and excite her ire by tendering that established consolation, &#145;It is going about, madam, I assure you; I suppose I have now twenty patients with just the same symptoms as your ladyship's.&#146; (<span class="italic">Selections</span>, 60)</blockquote>She was also a survivor. Those who &#145;fairly love a grievance&#146;, Stuart writes, may be able to support real evils better than imaginary ones. &#145;As heroic sufferers they are in their proper element&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selections</span>, 64).<br>
<br>Stuart is a writer who is able to produce a compelling aphorism&#151;&#145;the injurer never forgives&#146;&#151;while also, in mid-passage, casting doubt on it  (<span class="italic">Lady Mary Wortley Montagu: Essays</span>, 56). &#145;Most people addicted to romancing&#146;, she declared, &#145;are their own heroes&#146;. Like Walter Scott, she was herself capable of romancing, while remaining a disapprover of the addiction. A &#145;leaning towards the romantic&#146; is linked with possession of &#145;wit, genius or imagination&#146;  (Stuart, <span class="italic">Memoire of Lady Douglas</span>, 37, 56). The loss of the man she might have married is likely to have affected her own romantic leanings and yearnings, this shrewd woman's castles in the air. Her shrewdness is disclosed in the ability to contradict herself to interesting effect, and she can sometimes appear to believe in a spirit of contradiction inherent in the order of things. Her inconsistencies include a fidelity to the old order in matters of politics and government, and an aversion to the mob, accompanied by a regard for unadorned human worth, which could make her resistant to family pride and anxious about Sir Walter's regard for rank and lineage. A chronicler of the patrician bluestockings of her time, she was both for and against the emancipation of women.<br>
<br>Stuart was to settle at 108 Gloucester Place, Marylebone, from which she would go rambling round Regent's Park. She spoke in 1837 of the &#145;quiet hole&#146; in which she had spent her days  (<span class="italic">Lady Mary Wortley Montagu: Essays</span>, 55), but can be accounted a highly sociable recluse. There she sat in her studious closet, bent over her books, deploring the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, listening to the excitements and unreason of a bellowing John Bull, writing about her Lady Marys, and destroying, it was said, many of her manuscripts. But her days were also spent counselling, conversing, corresponding, and on progresses from one great house to another. She is the least-known, but by no means the least, of the good writers of her long lifetime. She died unmarried at the age of ninety-four on 4 August 1851 at her London home and was buried in the catacomb at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
