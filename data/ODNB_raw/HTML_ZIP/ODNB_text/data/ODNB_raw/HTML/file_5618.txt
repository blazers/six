<span class="headword">Clerk,  John, of Eldin</span>  (1728&#150;1812), <span class="occ">naval writer</span>, was born at Penicuik, Edinburghshire, on 10 December 1728, the seventh son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5617/', "Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, second baronet (1676&#150;1755)")</script>, politician and antiquary, and his second wife, Janet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Inglis (<i>d</i>. 1760). His wealthy family background encouraged an open-minded attitude. He was educated at Dalkeith grammar school and started medical studies at Edinburgh University, though he did not complete them. He entered the world of business, and in 1733 there was a mention of him as a merchant in Edinburgh. He was also involved in the coalmining industry and showed considerable interest in geology, which he studied at university with a fellow student, James Hutton. A true child of the Enlightenment, Clerk was also active in the mid-eighteenth-century Edinburgh &eacute;lite, including Adam Smith, Adam Ferguson, Hugh Blair, and David Hume. In 1753 he married Susannah, the daughter of William Adam of Maryburgh and the youngest sister of the architects Robert, John, Adam, and William. John and Susannah had four daughters and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5619/', "John Clerk, Lord Eldin")</script>.<br>
<br>Clerk displayed a passion for harbours and shipbuilding in his youth. His interest in the navy grew in the 1770s when he had frequent contact with Captain Alexander Edgar, who had taken part with John Byng in the battle of Minorca (1756). The American War of Independence was the actual starting point of his work on naval tactics. He improved his knowledge of major battles by reading histories, newspaper articles, and logbooks which enabled him to reconstruct battles. He then put his analyses to the test with the aid of cork models floated on water, an original method distinct from the abstract conceptions favoured by French tacticians such as Bigot de Morogues and Bourd&eacute; de la Villehuet. In the late 1770s Clerk spoke of his work to Richard Atkinson, a friend and secretary to Admiral George Rodney. In an account written in 1804 Clerk also claimed he had given a memorandum to Rodney advising him on the tactical devices he might employ. Disappointed not to see his ideas implemented, Clerk decided to publish his research himself. He was further stimulated by the British defeat at Yorktown when a larger home force lost to the strategy of the French navy.<br>
<br>In 1790 Clerk published part one of <span class="italic">An Essay on Naval Tactics</span>. The study was distinctive as one of the first British accounts of tactics, as opposed to a work in French translation, and for its criticism of the current Royal Naval practice of looking more to signal books to the detriment of fighting instructions. Clerk's focus on practical tactics, developed during the course of the 1790s, sought to redress this habit; parts two, three, and four of the <span class="italic">Essay</span> were published in 1797.<br>
<br>Clerk died on 10 May 1812. After his death there arose a tremendous controversy regarding the true origin of the manoeuvre he is said to have devised: an attack on the enemy's lee side and breakthrough of their battle line, as Admiral Rodney had done at the battle of the Saints (12 April 1782). In an article published in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> (1829) Howard Douglas, the son of Rodney's flag officer, Sir Charles Douglas, maintained that his father, not Clerk, had invented this tactic. The claim triggered a response from Clerk's supporters in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> (1830), where it was alleged that Rodney and Douglas had read Clerk's report, passed on by Richard Atkinson, on the morning of the battle. In 1832 Howard Douglas asked why the first part of Clerk's <span class="italic">Essay</span> had not included a reference to the manoeuvre, and accused Clerk of appropriating Rodney's innovation as his own and of plagiarizing Paul Hoste's <span class="italic">Art des arm&eacute;es navales</span> (1697). Clerk himself had maintained in 1804 that his ideas were not fully developed at the time of the battle of the Saints, and that his thinking had not finally come together until the late 1790s, when he published details of the manoeuvre.<br>
<br>Clerk's abilities as a tactician may have been overrated by friends and disputed by his critics. Nevertheless, he remains an author of the highest order, who attempted to understand manoeuvres while looking for effective ways to bring the battle to a decisive conclusion. Clerk's <span class="italic">Essay</span> certainly helped to inspire a later generation of naval officers, notably Admiral Adam Duncan at the decisive battle of Camperdown (11 October 1797), and was subsequently translated into French, Portuguese, Russian, and Dutch.<br>
