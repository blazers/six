<span class="headword">Rawlinson,  John</span>  (1576&#150;1631), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and college head</span>, was the son of Robert Rawlinson, merchant tailor of London. Admitted to Merchant Taylors' School in 1585, and as a scholar to St John's College, Oxford, on 28 June 1591, he matriculated on 15 October, aged fifteen, graduated BA on 5 July 1595, and proceeded MA on 21 May 1599. He was a college lecturer in 1599 and the following year became master of Reading School. He contributed verses to William Vaughan's <span class="italic">The Golden-Grove Moralized</span> (1600), and left other poems (BL, Royal MS 12.A.LXIV, fol. 24) composed at St John's, where he was elected a fellow on 12 November 1605.<br>
<br>Rawlinson's sermon at Paul's Cross on Rogation Sunday, 5 May 1605, was published as <span class="italic">The Foure Summons of the Shulamite</span> (1606). Although not licensed to preach until 26 February 1606 he quickly gained a reputation as a fluent, florid, and edifying preacher, together with powerful patronage and lucrative preferment. Through Archbishop Richard Bancroft he was rector of Taplow, Buckinghamshire, from 1606 to 1610 and, having proceeded DD on 1 June 1608, vicar of Asheldam, Essex, and canon of New Sarum from 1609. The provost and fellows of Queen's College, Oxford, elected him principal of St Edmund Hall on 1 May 1610; he resigned his fellowship at St John's on 13 December with a gratuity of &pound;10. Soon after he married, and his daughter Joyce was born within a few years; it is not known whether the Catherine named in his will was his first or a later wife. Certainly by 1611, and probably before 1609, when he dedicated his <span class="italic">Fishermen Fishers of Men</span> (preached at the Mercers' Chapel) to Sir John Egerton, Rawlinson was chaplain to Thomas Egerton, Lord Ellesmere. As chancellor of the university and a favourer of Calvinism, Ellesmere supported Rawlinson's candidature in 1611 for the presidency of St John's, the latter having nailed his anti-Catholic colours to the mast the previous year with <span class="italic">The Romish Judas</span> (1611), preached at the university church on 5 November. Narrowly defeated by William Laud, Rawlinson appealed unsuccessfully first to the college visitor and then to the king, but he retained the backing of the Egertons. In dedicating to Ellesmere his <span class="italic">Mercy to a Beast</span> (1612), &#145;an egg of your own laying&#146;, he acknowledged his long-standing gratitude. He acquired the rectories of Selsey, Sussex, in 1613 and Whitchurch, Shropshire, in 1614, and in time royal favour was also forthcoming. <span class="italic">Vivat rex</span> (1619), delivered at Paul's Cross on 24 March 1615, the twelfth anniversary of James's accession, stressed that the king must &#145;voluntarily submit his will to the direction of the law&#146;, but does not seem to have caused offence. James admitted Rawlinson to the prebend of Netherbury in Ecclesia at Salisbury and by 1619 he was a royal chaplain. <span class="italic">The Dove-Like Soule</span>, preached before Prince Charles on 19 February 1619, was one of his four Lenten sermons at Whitehall published in <span class="italic">Quadriga salutis</span> (1625).<br>
<br>Despite his manifold commitments elsewhere Oxford remained Rawlinson's base. His <span class="italic">Unmasking of the Hypocrite</span> (1616) was preached at the university church. In 1623 he was among those before whom Gabriel Bridges was summoned for preaching a university sermon against absolute predestination. Two daughters, Elizabeth and Dorothy, were buried respectively in 1624 and 1629 at St Peter-in-the-East, adjacent to St Edmund Hall. In the interim Rawlinson built a new house on the High Street nearby. On 26 December 1627 William Juxon, now president of St John's, wrote elliptically to Rawlinson's erstwhile rival William Laud, now bishop of London, reporting the fact. In the course of conversation Rawlinson had suggested to Juxon several new ecclesiastical appointments, including Juxon's to the see of Worcester and his own to the see of Oxford &#145;for which his new house was well fitted&#146;. Juxon &#145;trouble[d] the Bishop with these particulars that he may read the good conceit we have of ourselves at Oxford&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1627&#150;8</i>, 479).<br>
<br>Rawlinson's daughter Joyce married Richard Alport at Whitchurch on 23 January 1630 or 1631. On 29 January 1631 Rawlinson drew up his will in the presence of Alport, leaving his Oxford house and property at Cassington, Oxfordshire, and Limbury, Dorset, to his wife, Catherine, during her widowhood, with reversion to Richard and Joyce, who also received property at Whitchurch and all her father's books. Bequests were also made to Rawlinson's sister Elizabeth Heale and her children, and to St Edmund Hall and St John's. The overseers were Rawlinson's &#145;sister-in-law&#146; Ellen Alport and Richard Zouche, principal of St Alban Hall. Rawlinson died on 3 February 1631, and was buried at Whitchurch on 10 February.<br>
