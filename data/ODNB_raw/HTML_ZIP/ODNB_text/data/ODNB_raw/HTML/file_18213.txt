<span class="headword">Martin,  Richard</span>  (1754&#150;1834), <span class="occ">animal welfare campaigner and social reformer</span>, was born in February 1754, probably in Dublin, the eldest son of Robert Martin (1714&#150;1794), landowner, of Dangan in Galway and his first wife, Bridget Barnewall (<i>d</i>. 1762), third daughter of John Barnewall, styled eleventh Baron Trimleston, and his wife, Mary. Both his parents' families were of Catholic Anglo-Norman descent and he was the first family member to be brought up as a protestant&#151;a device planned by his father to entitle Richard Martin to enter parliament to fight for Catholic emancipation. He was sent to Harrow School where a senior master, Samuel Parr, criticized &#145;wanton barbarity&#146; to animals, an attitude already impressed upon Martin by his mother. He matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1773, was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in February 1776, and in June entered the Irish House of Commons where he sat until 1783 as member for Jamestown, co. Leitrim, and from 1798 to 1800 for Lanesborough in the same county. In 1781 he was called to the Irish bar and in the same year, he conducted his only case, that against George Robert FitzGerald, &#145;Fighting FitzGerald&#146;, who was convicted of unlawfully imprisoning his own father. FitzGerald, a notorious madcap, had already earned Martin's contempt for shooting a wolfhound belonging to Lord Altamont. Martin, friend of both dog and owner, eventually challenged FitzGerald to a duel with pistols in which both participants were slightly wounded. This was not Martin's only duel, and at least one was to prove fatal for his adversary.<br>
<br>On the death of his father in 1794, Martin came into property which covered a third of co. Galway, some 200,000 acres of which were bog, mountain, and moorland in Connemara. He took up residence at Ballynahinch Castle, Connemara, at about this time, visiting Dublin, London, and Paris to pursue his political interest in parliamentary reform. In 1801 he was elected to the parliament in London as member for co. Galway which he continued to represent until 1826, speaking up for Catholic emancipation, opposing slavery, introducing a bill in 1821 to secure defence counsel for those on capital charges, and sharing with Sir James Mackintosh a campaign to abolish the death penalty for forgery. In Ireland, too, Martin was known for his humanitarian concerns, urging the pardoning of rebels, interceding on behalf of young men and women in trouble with their parents or the authorities, and for taking into his house and feeding the poor and hungry. So renowned was he for his philanthropy that the prince regent nicknamed him &#145;Humanity Martin&#146;, an epithet which became popularized as &#145;Humanity Dick&#146;.<br>
<br>Martin is best remembered for his robust championing of the protection of animals. On 18 May 1821 he published a bill proposing to make it an offence to &#145;wantonly beat, abuse or ill-treat&#146; any &#145;horse, cow, ox, heifer, steer, sheep or other cattle&#146; belonging to another person. This bill, amended to include mares, geldings, mules, and asses, passed through the Commons on 1 June but was defeated in the House of Lords. Undismayed, Martin reintroduced his bill and, with the help of Lord Erskine in the Lords, it received royal assent on 22 July 1822. This act, known as <span class="roman">Martin's Act</span>, was the first national parliamentary legislation in the world to penalize cruelty to animals. His repeated attempts to introduce further legislation to protect cats, dogs, and animals in slaughterhouses, and to ban dogfighting and bull-baiting, all failed. But Martin vigorously enforced his act, bringing horse dealers, drovers, and carters before the magistrates, often paying their fines out of his own pocket. On 16 June 1824 Martin, with William Wilberforce, Thomas Fowell Buxton, and other reformers, established the body which eventually flourished as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), after a precarious early period in which Martin had to rescue its first secretary, Arthur Broome, from debtors' prison. Martin was among the first to propose that the society should employ inspectors.<br>
<br>Besides his concern for the welfare of horses and farm animals, Martin also denounced vivisection as &#145;too revolting to be palliated by any excuse&#146;  (Greenwood, 82). He denied that he attacked the cruel sports of the poor while ignoring those of the rich, asserting that he was &#145;equally anxious to meddle with both when he found them opposed to the dictates of humanity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 2</span>, 24 Feb 1825, col. 657). When he was once asked why he took so much trouble to defend animals, Martin allegedly retorted: &#145;Sir, an ox cannot hold a pistol!&#146;<br>
<br>Martin was described as &#145;a short, thick-set man, with evidence in look and manner, even in step and action, of indomitable resolution&#146;  (Fairholme and Pain, 47). His niece, Harriet Martin, recalled his &#145;large-hearted sympathy with suffering of whatsoever kind&#146;  (ibid., 47&#150;8). In parliament, it was said, his sense of humour disarmed the opposition&#151;&#145;he holds the House by the very test of the human race, laughter, and while their sides shake, their opposition is shaken and falls down at the very same instant&#146;. Yet, he could be formidable&#151;&#145;he lets drive at the House like a bullet, and the flag of truce is instantly flung out upon both sides&#146;  (ibid., 27&#150;8). It was undoubtedly this combination of warmth, wit, and manly ebullience which enabled Martin to win some of his battles for reform. Anecdotes abound to testify to both his compassion and his pride. It was said that widows and children on his Irish estates would pray for his deliverance, that he had stopped a journey to investigate the reasons for a child's crying, and had comforted a shy girl at a grand function; yet he would also imprison malefactors and debt collectors at Ballynahinch. He was a friend of George IV but, typically, stood up for the estranged Queen Caroline. When the king asked him who would win a Galway election, Martin reputedly replied &#145;The survivor, Sire!&#146;<br>
<br>Martin was twice married. He married first, on 8 February 1777, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1795), daughter of George Vesey of Lucan, co. Dublin, with whom he had two surviving sons, <a href="#cosubject_18213">Thomas Barnewall (1786&#150;1847) [<i>see below</i>]</a> and St George (1788&#150;1800), and a daughter, Letitia (<i>d</i>. 1858). Martin was deserted by his first wife in 1791. On 5 June 1796 he married Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1846), author, the second daughter of Hugh Evans and widow of Captain Robert Hesketh; they had a son, Richard (<i>b</i>. 1797), who emigrated to Canada in 1833, and three daughters who never married, <a href="#cosubject_18184">Harriet Letitia (1801&#150;1891) [<i>see below</i>]</a>, Georgina (<i>b</i>. 1806), and Mary (<i>b</i>. 1810). Harriet Martin published at least two works after her marriage to Martin, <span class="italic">Helen of Glenross</span> (1802) and <span class="italic">Remarks on John Kemble's Performance of Hamlet and Richard III</span> (1802).<br>
<br>Martin enjoyed the theatre and an active social life. He neither drank to excess nor gambled, yet his generosity with money so compounded his inherited debts that eventually he was forced to flee to France to escape his creditors. He died at 6 rue de l'Ecu, Boulogne, on 6 January 1834, his last thoughts being on the care of his family and his dog. Martin's grave was damaged in an air raid in September 1944 and his remains were reinterred in Boulogne's eastern cemetery in 1972, marked by a plaque paid for by the RSPCA.<br>
<br>Martin's son <a name="cosubject_18213"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Barnewall Martin</span>  (1786&#150;1847), <span class="occ">politician and landowner</span>, was born on 4 October 1786 at Ballynahinch Castle, co. Galway. He was member of parliament for Galway from 1832 until his death of &#145;famine fever&#146;, caught when visiting his tenants in the Clifden workhouse, on 23 April 1847. The Law Life Assurance Society subsequently took possession of the Martin estates and sold them. His half-sister <a name="cosubject_18184"></a><span class="headword">Harriet Letitia Martin</span>  (1801&#150;1891), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born in London on 5 July 1801. She travelled extensively in Europe and America and while staying with John Banim and his wife in Paris, she wrote a story entitled <span class="italic">Canvassing</span>. This was published in 1835 and she went on to publish a novel, <span class="italic">The Changeling, a Tale of the Year '47</span>, in 1848. She died in Dublin on 12 January 1891.<br>
