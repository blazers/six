<span class="headword">Booth, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1626, <em>d.</em> 1681), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was baptized on 2 July 1626 at the collegiate church, Manchester, Lancashire, the son of Robert Booth (<i>d</i>. in or before 1637) of Salford in the same county, and Ann (<i>d</i>. 1696), daughter of Oswald Mosley of Manchester. Following his father's death his mother married, in August 1637, Thomas Case, a puritan preacher in Salford. After attending Manchester grammar school Booth entered Gray's Inn in 1642, before matriculating from St John's College, Cambridge, as a fellow-commoner on 20 September 1644. He was called to the bar in November 1649 and practised in London. About 1651 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1660), daughter of Spencer Potts of Chargrove, Bedfordshire. The couple had at least one child, a son Benjamin, who died aged eleven.<br>
<br>Booth next appears in Ireland in 1657 upon becoming a member of King's Inns. His wife, Mary, died in 1660 and was buried in St Michan's, Dublin, on 7 September. On 1 December Booth became third judge of the Irish court of common pleas on the recommendation of Lord Chancellor Eustace. He was knighted at Whitehall on 15 May 1668 and made chief justice of common pleas on 30 January 1669. His second wife, Susanna, daughter of Sir Henry Oxenden of Deane in Kent, whom he married at an unknown date, died on 27 October 1669; the couple had four daughters.<br>
<br>In 1673 Booth's nonconformist sympathies caused the king to veto his appointment as chief justice of king's bench. However, within six years the turmoil caused by the Popish Plot had made his religious convictions an asset to the beleaguered monarch, who promoted him to the post on 26 March 1679. Having inherited a large estate from his father Booth was able to add to it with purchases in Ireland. Although regarded as the ablest man in his profession in Ireland he was frequently ill with gout or absent in England. He died in January 1681 and was buried on 2 March in Salford.<br>
