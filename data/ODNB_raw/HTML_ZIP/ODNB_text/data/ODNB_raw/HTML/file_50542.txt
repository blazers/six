<span class="headword">Berisford,  Charles</span>  (1830&#150;1898), <span class="occ">silk manufacturer</span>, was born at Buglawton, Cheshire, the seventh of eleven children and fourth son of Isaac Berisford (1794&#150;1854), toll-keeper turned farmer, and his wife, Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bonsall (1798&#150;1860), formerly of Monyash. Charles started work when he was nine, presumably in textiles like his brothers. He was so small he had to stand on a stool to work. Later he was formally apprenticed, possibly to James Orme, silk throwster of Macclesfield, whose granddaughter he married, but more likely to a ribbon weaver (the trade he later adopted). He attended Sunday school, and then night school. Tradition has it that he extended his education by reading while at his loom.<br>
<br>In 1858 with his older brothers, William (1827&#150;1879) and Francis (1829&#150;1888), Berisford leased part of the Victoria silk mill on Foundry Bank in Congleton. It was a difficult time to start weaving silk, for Cobden's free trade treaty of 1860 virtually destroyed the British silk ribbon trade, as it allowed the entry of duty-free goods from France. The Berisfords turned to other silk small wares like ferrets (coarse tapes woven from floss silk and used as binding), Prussian or Paris bindings, galloons, and lutes.<br>
<br>In 1871 the three brothers entered into a formal partnership, calling themselves Berisford Brothers, silk manufacturers, but also carrying on a second business as silkmen, throwsters, and ribbon trimming manufacturers at Pool Street Mill, Macclesfield. In 1872 they bought the whole Victoria building at Congleton, on a mortgage paid off in 1893. In 1879 William died and Francis left the partnership to run the business at Macclesfield. By then the brothers had built a four-storey extension to the original mill and employed 110 people.<br>
<br>Charles Berisford married twice, but all that is known about his first wife is that she was the widow of a Captain Birchenhall. In 1861 Berisford married Sarah Ann Orme (1832&#150;1910) of Sutton Lane Ends as his second wife. Of their seven children, three of the four sons were to enter the firm: Harry (1864&#150;1936) in 1879, Philip Charles (1872&#150;1945) in 1889, and Ernest Johnson (1875&#150;1944) about 1893. David Birchenhall, his stepson by his first wife, became a partner in 1891, the firm being renamed Berisfords and Birchenhall. In 1892 they bought Parkside Mill, Prestwich, Manchester, and Birchenhall became its manager. There were also branches in London, Leeds, and Liverpool. Thus from its small beginnings the firm developed into one of the major ribbon and trimming manufacturers in the country. Until the year of his death Berisford retained an active interest in the firm, going to Manchester every Tuesday and Friday to buy cotton and to sound out the market. The firm's motto, &#145;The sapling has at length become a tree&#146;, was a fitting epitaph.<br>
<br>Physically frail from boyhood, Berisford lived a full and active life, &#145;an admirable example of those enlightened Victorian industrialists who to thrift and shrewdness added honesty in business and benevolence towards their work people&#146;  (<span class="italic">Berisfords: the Ribbon People</span>, 40). He was a trustee for the Methodist New Connexion chapel in Congleton (1871&#150;84) and an &#145;Exhorter&#146; for the chapel in Havannah. In 1884 he transferred to the Wesleyan Methodist chapel at Wragg Street, Congleton, and was instrumental in organizing and financing an enlargement of the premises. He was also a justice of the peace.<br>
<br>Berisford died at his home, Poplar Villas, West Road, Congleton, on 22 January 1898, and was buried at Astbury church. After his death his son Harry became chairman. In 1902 Philip Berisford moved to London to run that branch until he retired in 1924. Needing further accommodation to match expansion, in 1908 the Berisfords rented a mill at Derby to produce cotton bindings, and in 1913 they took over the small wares business of R. Thorp &amp; Son of Macclesfield. The enlarged firm was incorporated as a limited company in 1916, known as Berisfords Ltd, a name it retained to its centenary in 1958 and beyond. The flexibility which characterized Charles's early success contributed significantly to the firm's survival between the wars. Berisfords was quick to innovate, introducing rayon in 1919 and producing bias binding in 1931 soon after the patent in the United States.<br>
