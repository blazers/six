<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Llewelyn,  John  Dillwyn</span>  (1810&#150;1882), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born at The Willows, Swansea, on 12 January 1810, the son of the naturalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7670/', "Lewis Weston Dillwyn (1778&#150;1855)")</script> and his wife, Mary Adams (1776&#150;1865). Mary was the illegitimate daughter of Colonel John Llewelyn (<i>d</i>. 1817) of Ynys-gerwn and Penlle'r-gaer, Glamorgan, and she retained her mother's surname. John Dillwyn succeeded to the estates of his maternal grandfather, Colonel Llewelyn, and assumed the additional surname of Llewelyn upon coming of age. He was educated privately by tutors, and at Oriel College, Oxford, from 1827. His eldest sister, Fanny Dillwyn (1808&#150;1894), married Matthew Moggridge; his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47114/', "Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn (1814&#150;1892)")</script>, became MP for Swansea and a director of the Great Western Railway. On 18 June 1833 Llewelyn married Emma Thomasina Talbot (1808&#150;1881), cousin of the pioneer photographer William Henry Fox Talbot and one of the sisters of Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot of Penrice and Margam. They had several children, of whom the eldest, Thereza Dillwyn Llewelyn (1834&#150;1926), married the mineralogist Mervyn Herbert Nevil Story-Maskelyne (1823&#150;1911); the eldest son, Sir John Talbot Dillwyn Llewelyn (1836&#150;1927), married Caroline Julia Hicks-Beach.<br>
<br>Llewelyn's first photographic experiments, which preceded those of his friend and distant relative Calvert Richard Jones, took place at his house, Penlle'r-gaer (Penllergare), near Swansea, in February 1839 and were inspired by news of Fox Talbot's activities. His earliest surviving images are daguerreotypes from 1840 of his family and house. Not surviving, but recorded in letters, are daguerreotypes of orchids grown at Penlle'r-gaer and sent to William Hooker, the director of Kew Gardens, in January 1842, probably the first time that a photographic process was used for the identification of botanical specimens. Later in the 1840s Llewelyn worked with the daguerreotypist Antoine Claudet on some experiments in photography: no details are known, as the only references to the collaboration appear in the diaries of Lewis Weston Dillwyn. However, several daguerreotypes of Llewelyn by Claudet survive.<br>
<br>In 1852 Llewelyn was elected to the first council of the newly formed Photographic Society of London (now the Royal Photographic Society); he remained on the council until 5 February 1857. At a meeting on 21 December 1854 he was nominated as the first country vice-president. Llewelyn wrote a letter, dated 20 March 1854, for the society's <span class="italic">Journal</span> on the calotype process. In 1856 he announced his oxymel process, a mixture of honey and vinegar, whereby the collodion plates of the period could be prepared some time before use and developed when the photographer returned home. He claimed, in a letter to Fox Talbot, to have tried all the then known processes. In 1852 he had built an equatorial observatory at Penlle'r-gaer for his daughter Thereza and in the mid-1850s together they took collodion images of the moon. The July 1856 edition of the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> hailed him &#145;as a gentleman to whom all photographers owe a world of thanks&#146;.<br>
<br>Llewelyn exhibited regularly and successfully in the exhibitions of the Photographic Society until 1858. At the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1855 he won a silver medal of honour for four &#145;instantaneous&#146; photographs. His first instantaneous image had been taken in 1853 of the waves in Caswell Bay, south Wales. One of the Paris images, <span class="italic">Clouds over St Catherines, Tenby</span>, included a cloud taken in the same exposure, probably the first time this had been achieved; the negative, which still exists, dates from mid-1854 or earlier. Other of his photographic images also appeared in <span class="italic">The Sunbeam</span>, which was edited by his friend and fellow photographer P. H. Delamotte in 1859. The <span class="italic">Photographic Exchange Albums</span> was another forum for some of his images; the publisher Joseph Cundall announced &#145;Pictures of Welsh scenery&#146; by Llewelyn in 1854, in parts, but these scenes never appeared. In the 1870s Llewelyn's name appears as a council member of the Amateur Photographic Association.<br>
<br>In 1846 the first <span class="italic">Journal</span> of the Horticultural Society had, as its first article and illustration, an account of the Orchid House which Llewelyn had built at Penlle'r-gaer: heated by steam, the original building dated back to 1835. Specimens of his orchids were used to illustrate Samuel Curtis's <span class="italic">Botanical Magazine</span> over the course of several years. Llewelyn also created two lakes at Penlle'r-gaer, one of almost 20 acres and a man-made waterfall. It was on the lower lake that Llewelyn, in 1848, demonstrated the first boat in Britain to be propelled by an electric motor; it was constructed from a model by his friend Benjamin Hill of Clydach, who had taught electricity to William Grove.<br>
<br>In 1843, as a magistrate, Llewelyn was involved in the Rebecca riots in south Wales when the local farmers protested against the tolls extracted from them, allegedly for the maintenance of the road but usually ending up in the landlords' pockets. This episode ended with a major trial in Cardiff, at which Llewelyn and his brother were on the bench. A great, though unassuming, benefactor to the people and poor of the Swansea region, Llewelyn gave 42 acres of his land in 1878 to create Parc Llewelyn for the people of Swansea, at a cost of &pound;20,000. He was a member of the Swansea school board for many years, though in 1877 he scandalized his colleagues by writing a public letter to the ratepayers of Swansea, condemning the board's waste of money.<br>
<br>Llewelyn was the high sheriff of Glamorgan in 1834 and 1835, and deputy lieutenant in 1836. He became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1836, a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1837, and an FRAS in 1852. For much of his life he suffered from asthma, which in later life prevented him from taking part in his public duties. From 1871 he and his wife lived at 39 Cornwall Gardens, London, and from 1879 at Atherton Grange, Somerset Road, Wimbledon, Surrey. He died at Atherton Grange on 24 August 1882 and was buried in Penlle'r-gaer church in Glamorgan.<br>
