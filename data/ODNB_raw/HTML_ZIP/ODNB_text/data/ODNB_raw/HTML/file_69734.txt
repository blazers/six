<span class="headword">Heaton,  Clement</span>  (1824&#150;1882), <span class="occ">joint founder of a firm of stained-glass makers and architectural decorators</span>, was born on 21 August 1824 in Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, and baptized there on 14 November, the only son of James Heaton (1782&#150;1862), Methodist minister, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Walmsley. His co-founder <a name="cosubject_69734"></a><span class="headword">James Butler</span>  (1830&#150;1913)<span class="occ"></span> was born at The Butts, Warwick, the second son of James Butler (1786&#150;1851?), publican, and his wife, Charlotte. Both men learnt their trade in Warwick where, until 1851, Clement Heaton was employed as a glass painter by the local stained-glass maker, William Holland, and James Butler worked as a lead glazier, very probably for the same firm.<br>
<br>In the early Victorian period the rising tide of the Gothic revival led to a rapid increase in the demand for stained glass. Aware, no doubt, that there were, as yet, few stained-glass makers in the capital, Clement Heaton left Warwick in 1851 or 1852 and travelled to London. Here he set up his own stained-glass studio in Albany Street, and married Mary Louisa Matthews (<i>b</i>. 1835), the daughter of a glass cutter, on 17 November 1853. They lived first at 94 Albany Street, later at 8 D'Aumale Villas, Twickenham, and Verulam House, Watford. Two years later James Butler followed Clement Heaton to London where, by 1857, the two men had founded the firm of Heaton and Butler, with premises at 236 Marylebone Road. That year Butler married Kate Stultz (1830&#150;1858), and they lived in Rutland Street, Hampstead. Kate died the following year. About 1865 Butler married, second, Eliza Bacon (1837&#150;1896).<br>
<br>Although Clement Heaton and James Butler were sound craftsmen, and their business prospered, the artistic quality of the windows they produced in the early years of their partnership cannot be compared with that of the best designers in the field. Two far more accomplished artists, who were also engaged in establishing themselves as stained-glass makers at this date, were John Richard Clayton and Alfred Bell. But though they were skilled designers and draftsmen, their practical knowledge of the processes involved in the manufacture of stained glass was weak.<br>
<br>Clearly, the two firms must have seen advantage in working together for, in 1858, Heaton and Butler took additional premises at 24A Cardington Street, in the same building as Clayton and Bell. As a result, Heaton and Butler's designs drew closer to those of Clayton and Bell, who may on occasion have drawn the cartoons for the other firm's windows, while Clayton and Bell benefited from the technical expertise of Heaton and Butler who, according to one source, did much of their glass cutting, leading, painting, and fixing at this time.<br>
<br>The event which enabled the firm of Heaton and Butler to reach the top rank in terms of design, however, was the advent of <a name="cosubject_69735"></a><span class="headword">Robert Turnill Bayne</span>  (1837&#150;1915)<span class="occ"></span>. He was born on 11 December 1837, at Starton in Stoneleigh, Warwickshire, the second son of Richard Roskell Bayne (1802&#150;1878), architect and engineer, and his first wife, Ann Turnill. Bayne is said to have had a public school education and begun a career as a portrait painter before turning to stained glass. Initially he was apprenticed to Clayton and Bell but soon left to join Heaton and Butler, becoming a full partner on 26 March 1862. From then on the company was known as Heaton, Butler, and Bayne, the title it retained until it was dissolved in 1953. In 1869 Bayne married Marion Charlotte Hutchings, and they lived first at Ravensbourne Park, Lewisham, moving in 1896 to Wimbledon Park and then to Surbiton, Surrey. As part of his training with Clayton and Bell, Bayne learned to follow the principles of medieval design whereby the figurative elements of the composition are surrounded by a decorative architectural framework. But when he became chief designer of Heaton and Butler, a firm which had not as yet developed a distinctive style of its own, Bayne was free to experiment. Abandoning the strictly historicist approach advocated by Clayton and Bell, he began to heighten the drama of his work by exaggerating the gestures and &#145;medieval&#146; facial features of the teeming figures that filled his windows. Fine examples of his work at this time are found at St Mary's, Brome, Suffolk (1863), Nordelph Church, Norfolk (1865), and St James's, Chilton Cantelow, Somerset (1865).<br>
<br>But just as striking as the improvement in design, was the firm's adoption of a much more vivid palette of colours. The production of stained glass is always a collaborative process carried out by a team of craftsmen, and this often makes it difficult to say who may have been responsible for what. However, it seems probable that Clement Heaton played an important part here since he was, throughout his life, particularly interested in the techniques involved in glass making and could, by this date, produce 130 different tints. But such things are also a matter of fashion. Heaton, Butler, and Bayne were not alone in changing their palette in the 1860s; although Clayton and Bell added only a few new colours at this time, Lavers and Barraud, the other major firm established in London during the previous decade, were much more adventurous. Following Pre-Raphaelite taste, both they and Heaton, Butler, and Bayne added lime greens, clear pinks, mauves, oranges, and various shades of blue to the more traditional range of colours&#151;red, blue, amethyst, brown, and yellow&#151;used in the medieval period.<br>
<br>The demand for stained glass reached a peak between 1860 and 1870, and it is no surprise, therefore, to find Heaton, Butler, and Bayne expanding at this time. In 1863 they moved to grand new premises at 14 Garrick Street in Covent Garden, a studio building specially designed for them by Arthur Blomfield, an architect with whom the firm had a long and successful relationship. Here there was sufficient space to experiment with other media and, by 1865, they had not only branched out into the field of painted decoration but were also carrying out designs using mosaic, inlaid stone, and incised mastic work. From 1870 until the beginning of the First World War they were the most prolific of all the firms producing large-scale decorative schemes for churches, public buildings, and private houses.<br>
<br>By the mid-1860s Heaton, Butler, and Bayne were probably employing upwards of a hundred men. Like all stained-glass firms of this date, they used production-line methods to keep the cost of their work within bounds. A few skilled cartoonists did nothing except figurework, while a second tier of draftsmen specialized in architectural decoration, drapery, or repetitive patterning. A further group of craftsmen carried out the more menial tasks of glass cutting, firing, leading, and fixing of the windows. And yet more men were employed to decorate walls and ceilings.<br>
<br>About 1870 taste changed again, and the jewel-like windows of the previous decade, formed by a kaleidoscope of different coloured pieces of glass, began to give way to something more sombre. From this time on until the beginning of the First World War, the colour range most frequently used by Heaton, Butler, and Bayne included brown, green, yellow, blue, and deep red. A typical design would also include plenty of contrasting white glass, with features such as yellow hair and gilded ornaments picked out in yellow stain. At the same time the firm abandoned their &#145;medieval&#146; style, whereby faces and other features were merely drawn in outline, and began to use much more shading to make objects look three-dimensional. This also had the effect of reducing the luminosity of the glass and making the colours darker.<br>
<br>Some of the most outstanding stained glass made by the firm in the last three decades of the nineteenth century, however, was not designed by the &#145;in house&#146; cartoonists but by specially commissioned freelance artists. This was the case at St Elisabeth, Reddish, in Manchester, where about 1883, the architect Alfred Waterhouse commissioned Frederick Shields to make the cartoons for the windows. Some years earlier, he also had Shields design glass for the chapel of the duke of Westminster's vast new mansion, Eaton Hall in Cheshire (house dem. 1961, chapel survives), where Henry Stacy Marks was employed to paint murals. Heaton, Butler, and Bayne made all the stained glass for the house and chapel windows, and were also asked to carry out much of the other decoration. They in turn called in Lewis F. Day, an artist who specialized in the design of wall coverings, tiles, and stained glass for domestic interiors, giving him a contract to help with this particular job.<br>
<br>On 24 February 1882 Clement Heaton died in Bournemouth and was succeeded by his son, Clement J. Heaton (1861&#150;1940). Two years later, following a dispute with the other partners, Heaton resigned and set up his own company, Heaton's Cloisonn&eacute; Mosaics Ltd, specializing in metalwork and enamelling. In 1893 he emigrated to Switzerland where he became a successful designer, eventually moving to America. Sadly, Robert Turnill Bayne had a stroke in 1885 and, although he lived until 1915, was no longer able to work. He died on 18 September 1915 at his home, Losely Hurst, in Surbiton, Surrey. After this the great years of the firm were over. James Butler died in London in 1913 and was succeeded by Clement James Butler (1859&#150;1929). Richard Cato Bayne (1870&#150;1940) joined the company in 1887, and his only son, Basil Richard Bayne (1897&#150;1953) saw it through its final years.<br>
