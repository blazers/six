<span class="headword">Wardlaw,  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1365&#150;1440), <span class="occ">bishop of St Andrews and founder of its university</span>, was the nephew of the influential <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28724/', "Cardinal Walter Wardlaw")</script>; he came of a branch of the Wardlaw family established in the diocese of Aberdeen. A career in the church must have been decided for him at an early stage, as his uncle petitioned the pope on his behalf in 1378 for a canonry of Glasgow. On 7 December 1380 he was granted a safe conduct to enable him and his kinsman Alexander Wardlaw to attend either Oxford or Cambridge university, but there is no evidence for their presence there, and by 1383 both men had taken a BA degree at Paris, where Henry became licentiate of arts by 1385. By October 1387 he had been studying civil law at Orl&eacute;ans for at least two years, after which he continued his studies at the University of Avignon. He was styled scholar of canon law by 1394, bachelor of canon law by 1399, and doctor of canon law by September 1403.<br>
<br>Wardlaw came to hold canonries and prebends in Glasgow, Moray, and Aberdeen, in addition to the precentorship of Glasgow and the church of Cavers. Initially he secured patronage for his ecclesiastical career from his uncle, the cardinal, but following the latter's death in 1387 it was almost certainly royal patronage which secured the Glasgow precentorship for him and service at the papal court, Scotland having espoused the cause of Avignon during the schism, which brought him subsequent rewards. Wardlaw was provided to the bishopric of St Andrews, left vacant by the death of Walter Trail in 1401, by Benedict XIII on 10 September 1403, although his appointment was opposed by Chancellor Gilbert Greenlaw, bishop of Aberdeen, who was the candidate preferred by the duke of Albany, then governor of Scotland, and by the St Andrews Cathedral chapter. He was consecrated between 21 September and 4 October and returned to Scotland in the following year.<br>
<br>Robert III seems to have placed considerable trust in Wardlaw, as it was to him that he sent his son, the young Prince James, for safe keeping some time between 1404 and 1406. Albany's hostility caused Wardlaw to seek other political allies, and he made common cause with Sir David Fleming of Biggar and Cumbernauld and with Henry Sinclair, earl of Orkney. Orkney's sphere of influence was the south-east of Scotland; consequently relations with England were a matter of particular concern to all three men. When Henry Percy, earl of Northumberland, rebelled against Henry IV, Wardlaw, with Fleming and Orkney, provided Scottish support for the rebel earl, and Wardlaw received him in St Andrews Castle following his flight from England. So far was Wardlaw in his confidence that Northumberland left his grandson and heir, another Henry Percy, in the bishop's care, where he was educated alongside Prince James. This period was one of political ascendancy for Wardlaw, Orkney, and Fleming, as the king's closest councillors, but after the death of Robert III on 4 April 1406 and the subsequent appointment of Albany as governor of the realm Wardlaw of necessity turned his attention to ecclesiastical affairs.<br>
<br>St Andrews became the focus of Wardlaw's activities, and he seldom seems to have travelled far from the diocese. Walter Bower, a contemporary of Wardlaw, describes him as a gentle man, but censures him for entertaining on a lavish scale, spending far beyond his means. He certainly devoted considerable effort to restoring St Andrews Cathedral following a serious fire, sending ships to Prussia to fetch timber for the rebuilding, and he improved the route for pilgrims travelling to St Andrews by erecting the Guard Bridge over the mouth of the River Eden. That he concerned himself with trade is shown by the protests which Wardlaw lodged with Henry IV of England over a trading vessel returning to St Andrews from Flanders which was captured by the English in 1404; restitution had been secured by March 1405. In 1405 he received from Robert III a grant of the whole of the customs of St Andrews for himself and his episcopal successors, a significant advance on the one-third enjoyed by his predecessors.<br>
<br>Wardlaw's particular claim to fame is his establishment of St Andrews as the first university in Scotland, the first lectures being delivered, according to Bower, after Whitsunday 1410. On 28 February 1411 Wardlaw issued a charter referring to his foundation as a university, so taking advantage of his influence with Benedict XIII to anticipate papal acceptance; this duly followed in the form of a bull on 28 August 1413 which granted apostolic confirmation and authorized the university to teach theology, canon and civil law, arts, and medicine, and to confer degrees. Wardlaw was nominated chancellor of the new university, and his active interest in its affairs sometimes led to clashes with Laurence Lindores, the principal master of the arts faculty's pedagogy. In 1417 the election of Martin V brought the schism to an end, and by August 1418 the University of St Andrews had made its submission to him.<br>
<br>Wardlaw's influence with the papacy later waned somewhat. As a result of a dispute between Wardlaw and the abbey of Arbroath concerning procurations in 1420 Martin V exempted the abbey from the bishop's jurisdiction for a short time, showing that Wardlaw could no longer depend on papal support. He officiated at the coronation of James I, which took place at Scone on 21 May 1424, but he was not so closely identified with royal policy that St Andrews could not be regarded as appropriately neutral ground for the detention of the Albany Stewarts following their arrest in 1425, and he later failed to support James I in his stand against the papacy. For this defiance the king intervened in university politics, siding with Laurence Lindores against Wardlaw and attempting, unsuccessfully, to transfer the university from St Andrews to Perth. On 15 October 1431 it was to Wardlaw that the three estates entrusted the chest of money raised for the king's northern campaign, in preference to allowing James I direct access to the money for fear he would squander it. Wardlaw died in the castle of St Andrews on 6 April 1440 and was buried in the cathedral.<br>
