<span class="headword">Skeffington, Sir  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em> the Gunner]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1535), <span class="occ">lord deputy of Ireland</span>, was the eldest son of Thomas and Mary Skeffington of Skeffington in Leicestershire. Having been knighted by Henry VII, he served as sheriff of the counties of Warwick and Leicester and as a justice of the peace for Leicestershire in 1509. In 1510 he was issued with a royal pardon and was subsequently reappointed to the commission of the peace for Leicestershire, a post that he intermittently held throughout his career, even during his service in Ireland. By 1512 he was a captain with responsibility for receipt of ordnance, and in the mid-1510s he again held the position of sheriff of the counties of Warwick and Leicester. In May 1515 Skeffington was appointed master of the ordnance for which he was paid 2<i>s</i>. a day. He continued to hold that position until 1529. In 1520 he was listed among those chosen to attend on Henry VIII at the Field of Cloth of Gold. Throughout the 1520s, in his capacity as master of the ordnance, Skeffington was actively involved in strengthening the fortifications of the English pale in Calais and Gu&icirc;nes. In 1525 he was granted a commission for conducting searches in specific quarters of London. He was knight of the shire for Leicestershire in 1529. By then he had been married twice. By his first marriage, to Margaret, daughter of Sir Everard Digby of Tilton, he had a son and heir, Thomas. He and his second wife, Anne, daughter of Sir John Digby of Kettleby in Leicestershire, had among other children, one son, Leonard, who served as a lieutenant of the Tower of London, as a soldier in Ireland, and as a messenger who regularly represented his father at court.<br>
<br>In a new departure in the governance of Ireland a secret council of three officials acted as deputy to the nominal lieutenant, Henry Fitzroy, duke of Richmond, in June 1529. Skeffington arrived in Ireland the following August, having been dispatched as the king's counsellor and commissioner, charged with the task of compiling a report on the military situation in the lordship. He was involved in negotiating a settlement between Piers, earl of Ossory, and the earl of Desmond and in making arrangements for the governance of the midlands. Early in 1530 Skeffington submitted a detailed report in which he asserted that the secret council lacked the money and men to govern effectively. He returned to England, but following the fall of Cardinal Wolsey, the architect of the conciliar scheme, in the summer of 1529, he was appointed lord deputy of Ireland in June 1530. Skeffington duly arrived in Dublin in August along with Gerald Fitzgerald, earl of Kildare, and was received in a solemn procession at St Mary's Abbey with great applause from the citizens. He was instructed to promote good relations between the earls of Kildare, Ormond, and Desmond, and to secure their co-operation against Gaelic resistance. He was to enjoy the active assistance of the earl of Kildare, convene a parliament, and act only with the approval of the council. He unsuccessfully endeavoured to negotiate for a retroactive extra-parliamentary grant of taxation for the period 1529&#150;30.<br>
<br>Late in 1530 Skeffington led a campaign into the territory of Leix (Laois) against O'More and O'Connor, whom he subdued. Following an inactive winter he and the earl of Kildare made inroads into Ulster early in 1531, capturing and demolishing O'Neill's castle at Kinard and destroying neighbouring territories and villages. In May he was granted a commission to convene a parliament. Later that month he received an indenture of submission to Henry VIII on behalf of Odo O'Donnell at Drogheda. While initially Skeffington and the earl of Kildare maintained amicable relations, by July both men were sending messengers to the court with reports of the other's malpractice, and Kildare was apparently treating the deputy less as the king's representative than as a mere commoner. In an effort to secure greater freedom of action from Kildare's influence Skeffington encouraged the feud between Ossory and Kildare. His critics accused him of supporting Kildare's kinsmen against the earl and of having built up alliances with Gaelic lords bordering on the pale in opposition to Kildare. Skeffington's problems were further compounded by parliament's refusal to grant a subsidy when it met in September and October 1531, thereby forcing him to resort to levying scutage on the king's tenants by knight service.<br>
<br>In May 1532 John Rawson and Chief Justice Patrick Bermingham, both former members of the secret council, presented the English council at Greenwich with a list of accusations of maladministration directed against Skeffington, notably that he had deliberately rekindled the Ossory&#150;Kildare feud and had exhibited partiality towards Ossory. Early in July the earl of Kildare visited the court and was reappointed deputy lieutenant. Soon after he assumed office in mid-August, Kildare set about settling the score with Skeffington by humiliating the former deputy publicly during a muster of his troops. Skeffington was then obliged to wait on Kildare until he received instructions regarding the storage of a sizeable consignment of ordnance and military stores which had been in his custody. In mid-October 1532 he finally entrusted the armaments to the charge of the Irish council. Kildare was summoned to court in September 1533, and by October Skeffington had retired to England to lend weight to the mounting campaign instigated by the Butlers with a view to securing Kildare's recall to court. To that end, in December 1533 he submitted his own indictment of Kildare. While Skeffington was &#145;scantily beloved&#146; in English government circles, Maguire, lord of Fermanagh, bemoaned his absence from Ireland early in 1534, alleging that he had &#145;gained the esteem of all&#146; and had &#145;showed himself most just and indifferent&#146; (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 7, 1883, no. 1014; Brewer and Bullen, 1.53).<br>
<br>Before May 1534 the decision had been taken to reappoint Skeffington as lord deputy. His instructions, the &#145;Ordinances for the government of Ireland&#146;, served as a manifesto for administrative reform of the lordship. These also stipulated that he was to lead a campaign against the pope, to resist the pope's provisions and jurisdiction, and to enact both measures at the next parliament. Late in May Ossory formally undertook to assist the new deputy. Skeffington appears to have been virtually the only candidate for the post: the imperial ambassador, Eustace Chapuys, expressed surprise at Henry's choice of incumbent since he regarded Skeffington as the most unfit candidate for governing Ireland that could be chosen. In June 1534 Kildare's son and deputy, Thomas, Lord Offaly, repudiated his allegiance to Henry VIII. In late July preparations were still in progress for Skeffington's dispatch with a modest company of just 150 men, but the situation in Ireland deteriorated when Offaly besieged Dublin Castle in August. The lord deputy dallied in Wales for the months of August and September, blaming desertions, a lack of reinforcements, and poor weather conditions for his failure to sail for Ireland. He sent his son, Leonard, to court to impress upon Henry VIII the dangers of undertaking the crossing without a good company.<br>
<br>By late September 1534 Henry had grown impatient with Skeffington and ordered his immediate departure. On 14 October the deputy and his company finally set sail from Graycott. Skeffington brought heavy artillery with him to Ireland which his forces used to good effect during the siege of Kildare's fortress at Maynooth. Wary of reports that Dublin city and castle had been taken by Offaly, Skeffington opted to land at Waterford. He subsequently changed his itinerary and on 24 October he and his force of approximately 2300 men arrived in Dublin. He was immediately sworn into office. Three days later a friar from Drogheda informed the deputy that Offaly intended laying siege to that town. The following day he set out for Drogheda where he remained stationed for a week. He had Thomas Fitzgerald proclaimed a traitor at the high cross in the town. Having summoned the gentlemen of Louth and Meath to affirm their allegiance Skeffington returned to Dublin via Trim where his son, Leonard, served in skirmishes against Fitzgerald. Immediately upon his return to Dublin Skeffington, along with many of his troops, fell ill. Advanced in age, with a choleric temperament and prone to occasional dysentery, he was prostrated with sickness for much of the winter; he garrisoned the chief pale towns while he lapsed into lethargy, proving both unable and unwilling to control the army. Skeffington used orthodox military tactics in his handling of Lord Offaly, seeing no need to bring the rebel's forces to an engagement, a strategy that frustrated many members of the Dublin government. In December John Alen remarked that &#145;the deputy is old, and cannot take pains by reason of sickness&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 7, no. 1573).<br>
<br>Early in 1535 Skeffington allowed William Brereton and other captains to divide their companies and to burn many Geraldine villages, including Maynooth, Lord Offaly's base. By mid-March the deputy had recovered, and besieged Maynooth Castle which surrendered to him on the 23rd of that month. He authorized the immediate execution of the garrison in what was known as &#145;the pardon of Maynooth&#146;. Skeffington subsequently made Maynooth his base and campaigned throughout Kildare to suppress Geraldine insurgence. In mid-June Skeffington was informed that O'Neill and O'Donnell were conspiring against him, but while the deputy contemplated an expedition into Ulster, O'Neill pre-emptively sought a parley and in July 1535 signed an agreement with Skeffington at Drogheda, following the example of O'More and MacMurrough. In late July Skeffington was replaced as military commander by Lord Leonard Grey. On 24 August Skeffington notified Henry VIII that Thomas Fitzgerald had surrendered to him and that O'Connor had similarly submitted at Castlejordan following his campaign into the Gaelic lord's territory. Skeffington insisted that no &#145;condition either of pardon, life, lands or goods&#146; was made with Fitzgerald; yet members of the Irish council admitted that comfortable words were spoken to Thomas &#145;to allure him to yield&#146; and they interceded with Henry VIII to spare Fitzgerald's life on account of those undertakings  (Brewer and Bullen, 1.73, 74).<br>
<br>The deputy, now known as the Gunner by his Gaelic contemporaries, became ill once again in late summer: John Alen and Gerald Aylmer remarked that Skeffington was &#145;almost dead&#146; on occasions when he had to be out of his bed before ten or eleven o'clock in the day. A planned expedition against Conor O'Brien into Munster had to be postponed. In September William Brabazon, under-treasurer, recommended the recall of Skeffington who had by then sufficiently recovered to attend the takeover of Dungarvan Castle. The deputy himself requested permission to retire from Ireland on grounds of poor health, but in response Henry issued a qualified thanks to him for securing Fitzgerald's submission and insisted that he remain in office, declaring his unabated confidence in Skeffington's capacity for the post. On 31 December 1535 Skeffington died at Kilmainham in Dublin. He was buried before the steps ascending to the altar in the north wing of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, and a monument to his memory was erected at Skeffington.<br>
<br>William Brabazon said of Skeffington: &#145;He was a very good man of war, but not quick enough for Ireland, and somewhat covetous&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 2, pt 3, 279). Several other contemporaries also made the latter observation, and it appears somewhat justified since the deputy died in severe financial difficulties, leaving his widow, Anne, and their children in very precarious circumstances. On 1 January 1536 Lord Leonard Grey was elected justiciar in succession to Skeffington, and in June of that year Thomas Skeffington was granted livery of his late father's property. Skeffington was the first in a long line of exclusively English-born incumbents of the deputyship of Ireland under the Tudor monarchs, and he was also the first military leader to introduce sophisticated weaponry to Ireland.<br>
