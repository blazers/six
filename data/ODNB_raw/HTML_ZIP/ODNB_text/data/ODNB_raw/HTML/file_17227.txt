<span class="headword">Luttrell,  Simon</span>  (<em>c.</em>1643&#150;1698), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the eldest son of Thomas Luttrell (<i>d</i>. 1673) of Luttrellstown, co. Dublin, and his wife, Barbara Sedgrave, a daughter of Henry Sedgrave of Cabra, co. Dublin. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17221/', "Henry Luttrell (1653/4&#150;1717)")</script>, also subsequently a Jacobite officer, was his brother. He married in 1672 Katherine Newcomen (<i>d</i>. 1704), a daughter of Sir Thomas Newcomen, bt, of co. Dublin, and of Frances, a sister of Richard Talbot, earl of Tyrconnell. The marriage was consecrated twice, firstly by a Church of Ireland divine because his wife was a protestant, and secondly by one of his wife's Catholic uncles, Peter Talbot, the archbishop of Dublin, who refused to recognize the first ceremony. In 1673 Luttrell succeeded to an estate of over 4000 acres in the counties of Dublin, Kildare, and Meath.<br>
<br>Luttrell's religion excluded him from any military position until the accession of James II in 1685, when he was granted a captain's commission in Richard Hamilton's regiment of dragoons. When Tyrconnell became the lord deputy of Ireland in January 1687, Luttrell was promoted to the lieutenant-colonelcy of his father-in-law's regiment and made a privy councillor of Ireland. Trapped in England at the time of the revolution, he wrote on Christmas eve 1688 a pathetic letter to the duke of Ormond begging for a pass to leave the country: &#145;I have been sick these two years. I am now paralytic &hellip; If God gives me my health, and if your Grace promises me leave, I will go and serve the Emperor&#146;  (Ball, <span class="italic">Manuscripts</span>, 11). He was allowed to go to France, and within three months he sailed with the exiled King James to Ireland, where he was made a colonel of dragoons.<br>
<br>In May 1689 Luttrell sat as a member for the county of Dublin in the Irish parliament, and in September was appointed the governor of the city. He was responsible for Dublin's security at a time when raids by English men-of-war, armed risings by the protestants, and shortages of essentials were feared and expected. He &#145;chained up the streets and made breastworks at the entrance into each, to secure that naked place&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1686&#150;7</i>, 279). He gave orders prohibiting protestants from carrying arms, assembling in groups of more than five, or going out at night, and issued a proclamation that those who traded in goods at inflated prices &#145;should be punished with death and hanged at their own doors&#146;  (Ball, <span class="italic">Manuscripts</span>, 382).<br>
<br>Luttrell left Dublin shortly before the arrival of King William's victorious troops after the battle of the Boyne (1 July 1690) and travelled to Limerick. In November 1690 he was part of the delegation sent to France to get King James to remove Tyrconnell as lord lieutenant. The duke of Berwick, who described him as being &#145;of an obliging disposition&#146; and &#145;a man of honour&#146;  (Berwick, 82), included him in the mission as a moderating influence on his brother (whom Simon had to restrain from throwing Brigadier Maxwell over the side before their ship had left Galway). The mission to France was unsuccessful in that Tyrconnell was not replaced, but Luttrell stayed on in France to urge the French to send more supplies to Ireland.<br>
<br>Despite Luttrell's efforts, the supply fleet he sailed with only reached Ireland on 20 October 1691, almost three weeks after the treaty of Limerick had been signed. Under its terms he was entitled to recover his estates if he submitted to the new government. He instead returned to France and was outlawed in Ireland for high treason. His estate was confiscated and given to his brother Henry. He remained with the exiled Jacobites as colonel of the Queen's regiment in the Irish brigade, with whom he served in Italy and Spain. He was promoted to brigadier in the French army in January 1696, and died in France on 6 September 1698 aged about fifty-five. He was buried in Crest in southern France. He left no children. His wife erected a memorial to his memory in the chapel of the Irish College in Paris before returning to Ireland, where she sued Henry Luttrell for her jointure on the estate. She died in 1704. Her case was taken to the House of Lords by her second husband, Thomas Amory, who emerged triumphant in 1709.<br>
