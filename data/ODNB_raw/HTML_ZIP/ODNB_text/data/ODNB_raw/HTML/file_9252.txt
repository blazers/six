<span class="headword">Feinaigle,  Gregor  von</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Gregor Feinoegl]</span>  (1760&#150;1819), <span class="occ">mnemonist and educator</span>, was born at Ueberlingen in Swabia, southern Germany, on 22 August 1760, the son of Maria Magdalena Feinoegl. His father's name is not known. He joined the Cistercian abbey of Salem and was professed in 1780 and ordained priest in 1785, but the monastery was dissolved following the Napoleonic wars. From 1803 to 1806 he and his brother Alois rented the monastery weaving mill. Meanwhile he began to lecture on mnemonics, and published a pamphlet about his system at Karlsruhe in 1804. At Paris in 1806 Count Metternich and his staff are said to have followed his course with enthusiasm. Despite Dieulafoy's mocking farce, <span class="italic">Les filles de m&eacute;moire, ou, Le mn&eacute;moniste</span> published in 1807, he continued to lecture in France until moving to England in 1811, where he spoke in London, Liverpool, Glasgow, and other cities.<br>
<br>Feinaigle's mnemonic method, following Cicero, consisted of using mental images to simplify remembering sequences of facts. In particular, his technique involved placing what must be remembered in a pattern located on each wall of an imaginary room. Additionally Feinaigle taught short-cuts in mental arithmetic. Though unoriginal, his skill was to present traditional methods of artificial memory as a rational way to remember quantities of information. He developed an effective lecture performance. He Anglicized his surname, and adopted the aristocratic <i>von</i>. An accomplished showman, by patronage and publicity he stimulated public interest to watch him teach orphans to memorize sequences of dates or poems, and to perform complex mental calculations. The audience would then be invited to sign up for a course of fifteen lectures. Though no charlatan, Feinaigle did cultivate an air of mystery concerning both his own origins as a monk and priest, and the sources of his arcane techniques.<br>
<br>In London Feinaigle gave a demonstration at the Royal Institution on 22 June 1811, and in the same year a full course at the rival Surrey Institution. Notes on this course, taken by John Millard, were published as <span class="italic">The New Art of Memory</span> under Feinaigle's name in 1812. Michael Faraday tried to adopt the system, but Lord Byron satirized Feinaigle in <span class="italic">Don Juan</span>  (can. 1, st. 11). Feinaigle's lectures at Liverpool in September 1811 attracted further attention. Samuel Butler wrote from Shrewsbury for information. Another recruit was Bede Brewer, president of the English Benedictine monks, who encouraged Ampleforth College to employ Feinaigle to teach his system. Apart from mnemonics, another key feature of his educational method was the holding of regular examinations open to the public. These were both a test of the boys' progress and an opportunity to promote the school. Brewer and Peter Augustine Baines, prefect at Ampleforth, encouraged the spread of Feinaigle's system elsewhere.<br>
<br>Feinaigle left Ampleforth and moved to Dublin in 1813. Once again he advertised public demonstrations, then promoted a lecture course. He spoke at the Rotunda in January and at the Royal Dublin Society in February. He was an immediate success and was persuaded to set up a new school, on the same basis as that at Ampleforth, but protestant. Feinaigle himself invested &pound;4800 to purchase Aldborough House, which he renamed The Luxembourg. The Feinaiglian Institution opened in September 1813 and was oversubscribed from the start. Soon more schools were opened on similar lines, characterized by regular examinations and the absence of corporal punishment. The Feinaiglian Institution published a series of half-yearly reports which charts their steady expansion.<br>
<br>On 3 July 1816 Feinaigle married Martha Gregg, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dames (1780&#150;1874), a widow. A son by her first marriage (to Hugh Gregg) was the protestant controversialist Tresham Dames Gregg. Feinaigle had two sons, Charles Gregory (<i>b</i>. 1817), who died in Australia in 1880, and George Leopold, who was born in November 1819 but lived for only two months. Feinaigle himself died suddenly of an apoplectic seizure on 24 December 1819 in Ireland and was buried at St Thomas's Church (Church of Ireland) in Dublin on 27 December.<br>
