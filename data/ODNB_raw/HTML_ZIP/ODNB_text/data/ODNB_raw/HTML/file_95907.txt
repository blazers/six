<div class="para">
<span class="headword">King,  John Leonard</span>, Baron King of Wartnaby  (1917&#150;2005), <span class="occ">businessman</span>, discouraged enquiries about his early years and gave no birth date in his <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry, but in his <span class="italic">Burke's Peerage</span> entry he claimed to have been born in August 1917, the son of Albert John King and his wife, Kathleen. No birth certificate for a John Leonard King, son of Albert and Kathleen King, born in England in 1917, has yet been found; the only John Leonard King born in England that year was born on 21 June 1917 in Farnborough, Cropredy, near Banbury, Oxfordshire, the son of Jane King, a domestic servant, and an unnamed father. It is possible that his origins contributed to what one obituarist described as his &#145;deep insecurity about himself and his early life&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 13 July 2005).<br>
<br>King's schoolmates in Dunsfold, Surrey, described him as a &#145;dunce&#146; in school, but bold and lively out of it  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 15 July 1990). He left at sixteen without qualifications and found manual employment in engineering and motor workshops locally. Noted as a &#145;natty dresser&#146; (ibid.), he graduated to be a car salesman for Coombs Garage in Guildford, run by Arthur Sykes, whose daughter, Lorna Kathleen (<i>d</i>. 1969) he married in 1941 (they had three sons and one daughter, born between 1943 and 1950). King's duties included the uncomfortable task of repossessing cars&#151;the beginnings of his reputation as a tough man not to be trifled with. At the age of nineteen he started his own business, Whitehouse Motors, with finance from some local builders and the help of a Ford sub-agency from Sykes. He was aggressive enough to be chosen as a Ford salesman of the year. Following the outbreak of the Second World War the motor business failed but an engineering sideline, manufacturing components for aero engines, continued and expanded. Crucially King managed to secure access to modern American machine tools provided through the lend-lease programme. These gave him a major advantage when the war ended.<br>
<br>After the war King chose to switch production to Yorkshire, establishing Whitehouse Industries at Ferrybridge, in a depressed mining area, bringing skilled engineers from the midlands to train his workforce. It is not clear whether this move was because of access to scarce labour, or his friendship with the Yorkshireman James Hanson and his friend Gordon White, the founders of Hanson Trust. He later called it a social experiment; &#145;the Beveridge report was kicking around and the idea of doing something appealed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, 7 May 1983). At first he turned out miscellaneous products, from ballpoint pens to steel ladders, but he soon moved into manufacturing ball-bearings, &#145;one of the most basic things you can make&#146; (ibid.). He took over Pollards, which made self-lubricating bearings. He and his wife, Lorna, were a dedicated partnership, working twelve-hour days on tight margins. Both learned to fly and at one critical moment Lorna took their aircraft to Dublin to raise vital funds.<br>
<br>King also played hard, socializing with Hanson and White. The company's move to Yorkshire began an obsession with hunting; he was master of the Badsworth foxhounds in 1949 and of the duke of Rutland's foxhounds in 1958, and chairman of the Belvoir hunt in 1972. Gordon White described him as &#145;the bravest fellow I have seen in the hunting field&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 13 July 2005). In the 1960s business success enabled him to buy a 2000 acre estate at Wartnaby, Leicestershire, prime hunting country, and the country boy relished his place among the landed gentry. He also joined the Conservative Party. &#145;I wondered whether one was grand enough for the Tories&#146;, he later said. &#145;I was certainly too grand for the Labour party. So I had a look at the Liberal party and when I discovered it was nothing more than a convenient attitude of mind, I got on with being a Tory&#146;  (<span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, 7 May 1983). He developed formidable networking skills, adept at finding ways to secure newspaper attention for his businesses. He moved further into political circles, in part with the help of the ubiquitous John Poulson, the corrupt architect and developer married to his wife's sister.<br>
<br>King built Pollards into the country's third largest ball-bearing manufacturer and sought a merger with the Swedish SKF company, but Labour's Industrial Reorganization Corporation intervened in 1969 to compel a merger of the three British companies. King walked away with a personal profit of &pound;3 million but was struck by tragedy when his wife, Lorna, died. He placed a &pound;20,000 pearl necklace in her coffin and was furious when his private gesture was publicized in a newspaper. At his dying wife's request King tried, but failed, to rescue the Poulson business, but in the process met Reginald Maudling, deputy leader of the Conservative Party. Maudling attended King's second wedding, on 21 September 1970, to the Hon. Isabel Cynthia Monckton (<i>b</i>. 1926), the third daughter of George Vere Arundel Monckton, eighth Viscount Galway. They had met while hunting.<br>
<br>King swiftly re-entered business after losing Pollards, returning to Surrey to buy into Dennis, the fire engine and dustcart manufacturer, and becoming its chairman. But it was as chairman of Babcock and Wilcox (1970&#150;94), a prime manufacturer of power station boilers, that he really broke onto the national scene. He was an energetic chairman and began a necessary, but ultimately only partially successful, policy of diversification. His appointment brought an office in St James and a seat at the top tables of the Confederation of British Industry. By the mid-1970s he was a ubiquitous networker in his converted London taxi, with its own phone. From 1973 he chaired the Conservative Party's city and industrial liaison council; he sat on the review board for government contracts, and was knighted in 1979. He was marked out as a potential nationalized industry chairman. He was offered the British Steel Corporation but rejected it, saying he wanted &#145;something do-able&#146;.<br>
<br>After Margaret Thatcher's election victory in 1979 King was appointed to the National Enterprise Board, Labour's mechanism for restructuring industry, and became chairman (1980&#150;81), delighting in his brief to run it down, dismissing it as &#145;a reluctant provider of funds of last resort&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 13 July 2005). Cabinet ministers noted the prime minister's imprimatur. Nigel Lawson described King as a &#145;rugged, astute and politically aware industrialist &hellip; rightly one of Margaret's favourite businessmen&#146;  (Lawson, 227). Then in 1981 came the job he had lobbied for: chairman of British Airways. Norman Tebbit, the secretary of state for industry, acknowledged King's forcefulness. Interviewing him with John Nott as a possible candidate, he said:<blockquote>the impact was extraordinary. He is a man full of controlled, sometimes concealed, brute power with a razor-sharp brain often masked by his apparently na&iuml;ve and simple questions &hellip; Our conversation, far from being a gentle probing exercise &hellip; ended with King agreeing to accept the job. (Tebbit, 168)</blockquote>British Airways (BA) was in need of new direction. Formed by a merger between the British Overseas Airways Corporation and British European Airways years before, it still suffered their rivalries, and customer service was dreadful; cabin staff grudged passengers even a glass of water on flights from Heathrow to Paris. The airline had plummeted into loss against a budget promising rising profits. The key to King's appointment was the brief to bring in private capital&#151;in essence to privatize the airline&#151;the kind of project that King and other Thatcher advisers had been mulling over for years. It was by no means obviously possible; one city banker commented, &#145;I suffer the service. Don't say I have got to buy shares as well&#146;  (<span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, 7 May 1983).<br>
<br>King (who was made a life peer, as Baron King of Wartnaby, in 1983) worked a revolution with the help of smart branding and advertising, a dedication to customer service, and powerful financial engineering that took early write-offs to facilitate rising profits and later privatization. He commissioned a report from the accountants Price Waterhouse on which he based much of his strategy. He cut jobs at all levels including the boardroom. Executive perks were reduced and managers had to be more modest in their choice of company car. Overall staff numbers shrank from 52,000 to 37,500 in two years. The key to his success was to appoint good subordinates&#151;first Gordon Dunlop as financial controller and then Colin Marshall as chief executive. Marshall's remorseless attention to detail and commitment to customer service combined well with King's determined vision and contacts. Though there were strains, it remained a winning combination. King dealt with the politicians, and negotiated some major aircraft deals. Marshall ran operations. Though never soulmates, they spoke regularly at 7:30 every morning.<br>
<br>King switched BA's advertising to Saatchi and Saatchi, the Conservative Party agency. A brilliant slogan, &#145;The world's favourite airline&#146; (based on research showing that while BA did not have the largest overall number of customers it had the widest international spread), was allied to an unflagging drive to put customers first. On one far-flung press trip, King was accused of letting some journalists slum it in club class while others went first class. &#145;Club Class in British Airways&#146;, he returned acidly, &#145;is not slumming it&#146;  (private information). He was demanding, basing action on careful research, but not always close to the details. At an early press conference he gave a recorded television interview. At its conclusion, a public relations assistant leant over. &#145;Please don't use any of the figures&#146;, he said. &#145;He has got them all wrong&#146;  (personal knowledge). In 1985 he hired David Burnside, a combative Ulster Unionist, who had aggressively promoted free enterprise at the Institute of Directors. Under Burnside the BA public relations machine, with a potent mixture of good staff work and free flights for journalists, won over a sceptical press and helped the successful privatization that, delayed by an airline slump, eventually came in 1987.<br>
<br>During King's chairmanship of BA the airline's turnover more than doubled, from just over &pound;2 billion in 1981 to over &pound;5 billion in 1992. Over the same period a loss of &pound;140 million was turned into a profit of &pound;434 million, though profits fell back in 1993 to &pound;185 million. The improvement was matched by a huge change in perception. BA became a symbol of the success of Thatcherite privatization, and a business school model of corporate turnaround. King saw it in patriotic terms, &#145;The message is the Union Jack &hellip; It's an interesting business, and it's British, and it's the best. And there's nothing wrong with that&#146;  (Corke, 136). His belligerent attitude to critics of Margaret Thatcher was typified by his resignation from the Confederation of British Industry in 1980 after its director-general, Sir Terence Beckett, threatened a &#145;bare-knuckle fight&#146; with the government. But he could use strong-arm tactics with the tories too, cancelling political donations over a dispute on Heathrow landing slots.<br>
<br>King's acerbic, pigeon-chested, but always immaculately suited style embroidered the myth. He could be a bully with a &#145;beagle stare&#146;, but employees at BA saw him as their champion and he was popular with the shop floor at Babcocks. He enjoyed a good party and relished the company of celebrities. While confrontational with some journalists, he was particularly close to the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, where he became a director.<br>
<br>Competition from other airlines was fierce and King used his links with the Conservative government remorselessly. In 1984 he was able to stop plans to hand some of BA's treasured Heathrow landing slots to British Caledonian and other airlines, and in 1987 he won an even sweeter victory when BA took over British Caledonian in spite of concerns about competition. But he was less successful internationally; key strategic aims of links with airlines in the United States and Belgium were thwarted. Competition from Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic and its readiness to tease BA as monopolistic were persistent irritants, particularly when some of BA's routes were handed to Virgin. In 1991 rivalry broke into open warfare when Branson accused BA of a dirty tricks campaign. King, who had described Branson as &#145;a grinning sweater&#146;, made the mistake of publishing his reply, counter-accusing Virgin of a public relations campaign against BA. It precipitated a libel suit by Virgin in January 1993, alleging the spreading of smear stories, the poaching of passengers, and the shredding of documents. BA had to plead guilty and pay damages. In the storm that followed Burnside left and King, though probably ignorant of exactly what had gone on, agreed to bring forward his retirement, due later in the year. His consolation was to be appointed BA's president and, more strikingly, the standing ovation he received at BA's annual general meeting, when he entered the hall, from the small shareholders to whom he was a hero.<br>
<br>King retired to Wartnaby and his country interests, but continued to use his BA office until 2001. He stepped down as chairman of Babcocks in 1994, again becoming president. In 1994 he briefly became chairman of the engineering group Aerostructures Hamble but this flotation was not a success and it was soon taken over. He died of heart failure on 12 July 2005 at his home, Friars Well, Wartnaby. He was survived by his second wife and the four children of his first marriage. His estate was valued for probate purposes at more than &pound;27 million.<br>
