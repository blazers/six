<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Nuthall,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1716, <em>d.</em> 1775), <span class="occ">lawyer and public official</span>, was baptized on 22 April 1716 at the Presbyterian meeting house in Norwich, Norfolk, the only surviving son of Benjamin Nuthall, merchant (twice mayor of Norwich, in 1721 and 1749) and his second wife, Mary; Benjamin Nuthall had three surviving children from his first marriage and seventeen in all. It is not known where he was educated or where he trained as a solicitor. On 12 October 1736, at St Peter Mancroft, Norwich, he married Lucy Scott (<i>bap</i>. 1716, <i>d</i>. 1761), only surviving child of Edward Scott (<i>d</i>. 1727/8) and his wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pearse (<i>d</i>. 1746). She was the heiress to &pound;2000 as well as property in Norwich and Diss. His Norfolk background may have helped him win his first official post from Sir Robert Walpole's ministry, as registrar of warrants in the Excise Office (1740). In 1749 he became receiver-general for hackney coaches. Nuthall also transacted legal business for at least two Norfolk politicians: Charles, third Viscount Townshend, and the elder Horace Walpole, the diplomat, as well as for Charles Yorke. In 1751 Nuthall was engaged by the younger Horace Walpole to provide legal support for his scheme to detach the heiress Margaret Nicoll from her guardians, with the intention that she should marry George Walpole, third earl of Orford. The younger Horace became convinced that Nuthall was working against the family interest, to Nuthall's frustration, and the marriage plan collapsed in acrimony.<br>
<br>Nuthall's own marriage was the subject of an action he brought against Arthur Griesdale, warehouseman, of Ludgate Hill, in March 1756, accusing him of an adulterous relationship with Nuthall's wife. Griesdale was found guilty, and Nuthall was divorced by act of parliament on 1 February 1757. On 24 November that year at St Helen's, Bishopsgate, London, Nuthall married Susanna Custance, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Press (1728/9&#150;1761), widow of Hambleton Custance (<i>d</i>. 1757) and daughter of John Press, like Nuthall's father and his first wife's father a Norwich merchant.<br>
<br>A more successful relationship developed between Nuthall and William Pitt. Nuthall drew up Pitt's marriage settlement in 1754. By 1762 he was negotiating on behalf of Pitt with Thomas Pelham-Holles, duke of Newcastle, over the terms by which they might collaborate in bringing down the ministry of John Stuart, third earl of Bute. Nuthall received a series of appointments which he attributed to Pitt, his &#145;great benefactor and patron&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of William Pitt</span>, 2.325n.). These included the position of solicitor to the East India Company. On the retirement of Philip Carteret Webb in July 1765 he was appointed solicitor to the Treasury, an appointment through which Charles Watson-Wentworth, second marquess of Rockingham, hoped to win Pitt's support for his ministry. Nuthall characterized himself as a loyal follower of Pitt, writing that he would resign his offices if he were called upon to &#145;do anything that I can even surmise to be repugnant to your generous and constitutional principles&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Nuthall's moment came in February 1766 when Rockingham used him as an intermediary in an attempt to bring Pitt into the ministry. The period of negotiation, when much government business was on hold, has been called the &#145;Nuthall interlude&#146;  (Sherrard, 206). Nuthall expressed his relief when the negotiations were done, agreeing with Pitt that &#145;ambassadorship is a troublesome trade&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of William Pitt</span>, 2.401). He seems to have avoided political intrigue after that date, corresponding with Pitt over the scheme he had devised as ranger of Enfield Chase for conserving its oak trees for the construction of naval vessels. Pitt commended his plan, but the scheme failed to survive Nuthall's death, and the chase was divided and disafforested by act of parliament in 1777.<br>
<br>In August 1767 Nuthall drew up the power of attorney through which Pitt's wife, Hester, could direct her husband's financial affairs. Nuthall's good relationship with Pitt (from 1766 earl of Chatham) was seriously damaged in 1772, when he revealed to Chatham that he had mismanaged the mortgage agreement that had enabled Chatham to buy an estate at Hayes in Kent from Thomas Walpole. The purchase had been financed by a loan from Chatham's brother-in-law, Richard Grenville-Temple, second Earl Temple. Temple assessed Nuthall as &#145;that facetious man of business in so many departments &hellip; whose fellow is not easily to be met with&#146;  (Smith, 4.545) and listed further examples of incompetence, including Nuthall's failure to have Chatham's marriage settlement witnessed.<br>
<br>Nuthall seems to have been in partnership with a solicitor called John Skirrow at Lincoln's Inn in 1766; he later nominated Skirrow one of his executors. Nuthall's death was unexpected. Returning to London from Bath on 7 March 1775, his coach was attacked by a highwayman on Hounslow Heath, Middlesex. The attacker left when Nuthall returned fire. On reaching an inn at Hounslow, Nuthall wrote a description of the man for Sir John Fielding, but &#145;had scarcely closed his letter when he suddenly expired&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of William Pitt</span>, 2.166n.). His will drawn up on 14 January 1774 mentioned his third wife Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Spencer, from Hadley, near Epsom in Surrey and two young illegitimate sons, Thomas, aged four in 1774, who was at school at Chigwell in Essex, and John, with his nurse in Chelsea. An adult son, Robert, was also mentioned, and he too may have been illegitimate.<br>
<br>Nuthall's death exposed further irregularities in his conduct. Following a complaint by the deputy Treasury solicitor, Thomas Francis, the Treasury prevented administration being granted to Nuthall's executors. Francis successfully proved that he was owed &pound;2002 15<i>s</i>. in unpaid expenses and a further &pound;3282 18<i>s</i>. in unpaid fees, as Nuthall had deferred finalizing his accounts since his second year in office. The Treasury appointed Francis and William Masterman as trustees with the task of realizing Nuthall's debt from his effects; by February 1776 they had raised &pound;2239 16<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. Horace Walpole, never one to forget a grudge, wrote in 1775 that Nuthall &#145;had embezzled &pound;19,000&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 41.311).<br>
<br>Nuthall did not share the antiquarian interest in legal precedents that made his predecessor at the Treasury, Webb, a highly regarded government servant. His use was as a political man of business, who maintained excellent relations with Pitt for a number of years, but events proved that his skills, when tested, were limited.<br>
