<span class="headword">Matheson,  Hugh Mackay</span>  (1821&#150;1898), <span class="occ">overseas trader and Presbyterian lay supporter</span>, was born on 23 April 1821 in Edinburgh, son of Duncan Matheson (1784&#150;1838), advocate and afterwards presiding magistrate of Edinburgh, and his wife, Annabella (1796&times;9&#150;1829), daughter of Thomas Farquharson of Howden. He had an elder brother and two sisters. He was educated in Leith, in Edinburgh at the high school, and at Cunningham's academy, and later in part-time classes in logic and moral philosophy at Glasgow University. He had a devout upbringing and was convinced from an early age of his need to seek God's guidance in all matters by Christian prayer and scriptural readings.<br>
<br>Matheson became a clerk in the Glasgow merchant house of James Ewing in 1836, and in 1843 he was invited to join the Hong Kong trading firm of Jardine Matheson, in which his uncle, afterwards Sir James Matheson, was a partner. He declined, apparently out of scruples at the firm's involvement in the Chinese opium trade, but accepted a post with their London correspondents, Magniac, Jardine &amp; Co. In an attempt to improve his health he took leave of absence in 1845, and spent eighteen months touring the Orient and studying British trade there. His meetings with both merchants and missionaries convinced him that Christianity must be the salvation of the East: Europeans were superior in civilization to oriental people (so he concluded) because of their Christian faith. He returned to Britain fired with an ardour to spread biblical teachings; for the rest of his life he was committed to the Presbyterian church's China mission, of which he was successively treasurer and convenor.<br>
<br>Magniac Jardine was reconstituted as Matheson &amp; Co. in 1848 with Hugh Matheson as managing partner. Based in Lombard Street, its chief business initially was importing China tea and silks on Jardine Matheson's behalf, but in the 1850s the firm began exporting Lancashire cotton piece-goods and other commodities to China as well as importing Indian commodities to Britain. During the 1860s the firm managed Indian tea estates, and was involved with Jardine Matheson in promoting railways and cotton mills in China. It indirectly profited from the opium trade which Matheson had publicly indicated that he found &#145;objectionable&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 Feb 1870).<br>
<br>After the shah of Persia in 1872 granted an exclusive concession to Baron Julius de Reuter to build and operate all Persian railways, tramways, and canals, and to exploit natural resources, Matheson attempted to raise the finance to exploit this concession. He was more successful in 1873 when he formed an international consortium to buy from the Spanish republican government the state-owned pyrites mines at Rio Tinto. Having paid &pound;3.68 million, the Rio Tinto Company began working the concession in 1874 with Matheson as its first chairman. Under Matheson's leadership the company surmounted various financial, marketing, and political obstacles to become the world's largest supplier of sulphur and copper. The Rio Tinto mines were technologically advanced and well-managed (mainly by Scots; these expatriate managers were also responsible for introducing soccer to Spain).<br>
<br>As a businessman Matheson was shrewd at appraising risks and bold at hazardous moments. He was a hard negotiator who could be ruthless in pressing his advantages and was adept at winning the confidence of others. As a Christian, Matheson was protective of his Spanish employees, and provided houses, churches, stores, medical services, and schools (he was personally involved in the curriculum). However, his concern for the spiritual and economic welfare of his workers did not prevent him from justifying the use of Spanish troops to repress their political aspirations.<br>
<br>In the 1840s Matheson was shocked by the decline of Presbyterianism in England and as soon as he had the means dedicated himself to its revival. At the time of his death he was acknowledged as Presbyterianism's leading lay advocate south of the Tweed. He financed Presbyterian newspapers, educational initiatives, church building, and doctrinal work. Holy Trinity Church, near his home in Hampstead, was erected with his money. For many years, when in London, he went from his City office to Whitechapel or Spitalfields at the end of his working day to rescue prostitutes and drunkards. He was a strict sabbatarian. His religion was bigoted: he was an entrenched opponent of Roman Catholicism, and had an even more violent antagonism against ritualism and Anglo-Catholicism. Although given to many private charities he was thought harsh and offensively righteous even by some fellow Presbyterians. He was exceedingly conservative in his domestic arrangements and social attitudes but was president of the Hampstead Liberal and Radical Association and was much besought as a radical parliamentary candidate. He supported Irish home rule and the widening of electoral suffrage. Notwithstanding his commercial interests he hated the jingo policies of the Conservatives and was never a business imperialist. He enjoyed high standing in the City of London but pointedly did not join its hierarchy. Though a deputy lieutenant and magistrate in the City, and chairman of the committee of London merchants during the Anglo-Chinese negotiations of 1870, he desired neither the lord mayorship nor the accompanying baronetcy. He was, unusually for a Liberal, a bimetallist.<br>
<br>In 1855 Matheson married Agnes Ann (1830&#150;1900), daughter of David McFarlen of the Indian Civil Service. They had a son and two daughters. In 1858 he bought an estate in the Scottish highlands, Elswick House, near Strathpeffer, in Ross-shire, along with nearby property at Lower Scatwell. King Alfonso XII of Spain invested him as a knight grand cross of the order of Isabella the Catholic in 1882. He died of heart disease on 8 February 1898, at Heathlands, Hampstead. His widow published the <span class="italic">Memorials of Hugh M. Matheson</span> in 1899.<br>
