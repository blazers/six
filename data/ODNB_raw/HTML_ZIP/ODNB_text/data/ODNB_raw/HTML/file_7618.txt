<span class="headword">Dickson,  James</span>  (1738?&#150;1822), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born at Kirke House, Traquair, Peeblesshire, allegedly of humble parentage, and began work as an apprentice in the gardens of the earl of Traquair. He then went to London and worked as an improver at the famous nurseries of Jeffrey &amp; Co. in Brompton. He held several posts as a gardener before opening his own shop in Covent Garden in 1772 and establishing a business as nurseryman and seedsman. Dickson could now count among his friends William Forsyth, the king's gardener, Sir Francis Drake, master of the household, and Sir Joseph Banks. With Banks's support he secured in 1781 the contract to maintain the British Museum's garden. Several of Banks's overseas correspondents enclosed with their letters plant material for Dickson.<br>
<br>The identity of Dickson's first wife is unknown, but after her death he married, on 24 October 1786 at Selkirk, Margaret (1762&#150;1837), sister to his friend the then medical student and later explorer, Mungo Park (1771&#150;1806). Their son, James (<i>b</i>. 1800), and daughters Isabella (<i>b</i>. 1796) and Jean (<i>b</i>. 1805) were baptized at the Scottish presbyterian church in Covent Garden. Before leaving for Africa, Park gave Dickson power of attorney, and in 1806 and 1807, when Park had been missing for some time, Dickson reminded the Treasury of the government's promise to support Park's family.<br>
<br>In February 1788 Dickson was one of seven who formed the first &#145;fellows' meeting&#146; of the Linnean Society at Marlborough Coffee House. Sixteen years later, on 7 March 1804, he was one of seven who gathered in the house of bookseller John Hatchard to found &#145;a society for the improvement of horticulture&#146;. This body developed into the Royal Horticultural Society, with Dickson as one of its vice-presidents.<br>
<br>Although his daily work concerned cultivated plants and vegetables, Dickson's reputation as a botanist rested on his studies of mosses, begun in 1781, and on grasses and fungi, much of his material being gathered in visits to Scotland between 1793 and 1802. In 1785 he began publication of <span class="italic">Fasciculus plantarum cryptogamicarum Britanniae</span>, a quarto work in four parts with 400 descriptions. However, Dickson himself was ill-educated, as his correspondence shows, and the Latin texts were prepared by John Zier, a Polish-born London apothecary. Zier died in 1796, before the last volume was completed, and Dickson was then assisted by Robert Brown. Neither man was credited in the work, and Zier's role only came to light in the 1880s with the discovery of some of his manuscripts. Dickson also published <span class="italic">A Collection of Dried Plants, Named on the Authority of the Linnaean Herbarium</span> (1789&#150;92), consisting of 425 species, followed by <span class="italic">Hortus siccus Britannicus</span> (1793&#150;1802). Few copies of this work survive as many purchasers extracted the specimens to add to their own dried collections.<br>
<br>From the 1790s Dickson also had a nursery garden at Croydon, Surrey. He lived at Bedford Street, Covent Garden, from 1795 to 1799, thereafter at Broad Green, Croydon, where he died on 14 August 1822. On 22 August he was buried, at his own request, in the churchyard of All Saints, Sanderstead, among the Surrey hills where he was accustomed to gather mosses. The Covent Garden nursery passed to Dickson's nephew, James Anderson (1800&#150;1830), and Margaret Dickson inherited the Croydon house and garden; she was buried at Sanderstead on 17 June 1837, passing the property to their unmarried daughter Jean. Dickson's memory is preserved in the genus <i>Dicksonia</i>, consisting chiefly of tree ferns.<br>
