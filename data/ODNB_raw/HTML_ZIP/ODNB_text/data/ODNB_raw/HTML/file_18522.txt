<span class="headword">Melbancke,  Brian</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1600), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was probably born in Yorkshire, where he attended Sedbergh School. Later he went to St John's College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in the same term as the playwright Robert Greene (Michaelmas 1575) and graduated BA in 1580. He is identified in his own book, entitled <span class="italic">Philotimus</span> (1583), as &#145;Student in Graies Inne&#146; and the book is prefaced by an epistle to the gentlemen of the inns of court. Nevertheless Melbancke's admission to Gray's Inn is not officially recorded.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Philotimus</span>, subtitled &#145;The Warre betwixt Nature and Fortune&#146;, is an obvious imitation of John Lyly's <span class="italic">Euphues</span>. It contains many proverbs and pieces of verse, including an allusion to the story of Romeo and Juliet. One part of the dedication&#151;to Philip Howard, earl of Arundel&#151;might allude to Howard's time as a student at St John's. The other part of the dedication&#151;to the &#145;Gentleman Students in the Inns of Court and Chancerie, and the University of Cambridge&#146;&#151;is clearly an attempt to solidify whatever ties Melbancke had to Gray's Inn and Cambridge. It has been hypothesized that &#145;George Wastnes Esquire&#146;, who contributed some verses to Melbancke's collection, was a relative of Gervase Wastenys, student of Gray's Inn in 1571.<br>
<br>&#145;Brian Mullebanke and Sara Baker&#146; were married on 3 June 1583 at St Olave's, Southwark. Melbancke had buried a daughter named Margaret on 9 December 1582 in the parish of St Mary Magdalene, Bermondsey, but the identity of her mother is unknown. All the subsequent life events of Melbancke's immediate family were recorded in the parish registers of St Mary Magdalene, where he and his wife seem to have lived following their marriage. The registers include baptismal and burial records for eight other children, from 1584 to 1595, as well as Melbancke's own burial (20 June 1600) and what is probably that of his widow (13 August 1603). How Brian Melbancke made a living remains a mystery. <span class="italic">Philotimus</span> (now extant in only a few copies) appears to have been printed only once, in 1583 by R. Warde (although some title-pages bear the date 1582), and there were seemingly no subsequent printings of it or other publications bearing Melbancke's name.<br>
<br>The Milbankes of Yorkshire, who possibly were relatives, were distinguished by a long line of baronets and famous aristocrats, including Admiral Mark Milbanke and Anne Isabella Milbanke, Lady Byron.<br>
