<span class="headword">Bliss,  Douglas Percy</span>  (1900&#150;1984), <span class="occ">painter and printmaker</span>, was born on 28 January 1900 at Karachi, then part of British India, the son of Joseph Bliss (1868&#150;1936), pharmacist, and Isabel Douglas Percy (1868&#150;1966). He was educated in Scotland, where he attended George Watson's College in Edinburgh from 1906 to 1917. After military service in the Highland light infantry, he studied English, history, and art history at Edinburgh University from 1919 to 1922. He moved to London to study painting from 1922 to 1925 at the Royal College of Art, where he knew the graphic artists and painters Eric Ravilious and Edward Bawden.<br>
<br>Bliss held printmaking in high regard alongside painting. He produced fantastic woodcut illustrations to his selection <span class="italic">Border Ballads</span>, published by Oxford University Press in 1925. His imagination was populated by flying devils and grotesque hags in vertiginous and stormy perspectives. Further dramatic illustrations followed. In 1926 J. M. Dent in London published Dr Johnson's <span class="italic">The History of Rasselas</span>, in which Bliss provided intense drama in small-scale wood-engravings. In 1927 he exhibited at the St George's Gallery, London, with Bawden and Ravilious, and his wood-engravings were published by Oxford University Press as illustrations to Cervantes' <span class="italic">The Spanish Lady</span> in 1928. That year he exhibited prints in Paris and Buenos Aires and wrote <span class="italic">A History of Wood Engraving</span>, published by J. M. Dent. He provided coloured wood-engravings to <span class="italic">The Palace of Pleasure</span> by William Painter, published by Cresset Press, London, in 1929, and he again exhibited at the St George's Gallery. He illustrated, and introduced, <span class="italic">The Devil in Scotland</span>, published by Maclehose, London, in 1934. A career in illustration seemed assured.<br>
<br>After Bliss married the portrait painter Phyllis Dodd (1899&#150;1995) on 18 April 1928, they settled in Lambeth, London. His fearsome subjects mellowed and painting dominated his work. In 1934 he exhibited drawings at the Lefevre Gallery, London, and in 1937 he showed paintings there in a joint exhibition with Barbara Hepworth. He moved to Blackheath, London, in 1932 and taught at Blackheath School of Art and Hornsey College of Art. He also wrote for <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> newspaper and illustrated Edgar Allan Poe's <span class="italic">Some Tales of Mystery and Imagination</span> for Penguin Books in 1938. His paintings frequently depicted gardens seen from a window, contrasted against wilder landscape beyond. Home was a secure base separated by the garden from the vicissitudes of the world beyond. These landscapes could be both intimate and panoramic in their balance of man and nature, even in the city gardens of Blackheath. Bliss was committed to conservation in the face of development and war. In 1937 he was a founder of the Blackheath Society for Amenity Conservation. But his house at Blackheath was bombed early in the war and in 1940 he and his family were evacuated to Shottle in Derbyshire. Here the landscape was certainly a refuge. He painted its image as an idyll of domestic peace and natural plenty where rural craftsmen worked with nature to produce their crops. He found industrialized agriculture as menacing as invasion. His direct contribution to the war effort was in the department of concealment and decoy of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve from 1941 to 1945.<br>
<br>After the war Bliss returned to teaching at Hornsey College of Art and also taught at Harrow School of Art in 1945&#150;6. He held a joint exhibition with Phyllis Dodd in Derby City Art Gallery in 1946. His appointment as director of the Glasgow School of Art took him back to Scotland until his retirement in 1964. His work and opinions were increasingly recognized. He exhibited watercolours at the Lefevre Gallery in 1948, wrote for <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> and the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> newspapers, and in 1952 <span class="italic">Memoirs of Prince Alexy Haimatoff</span> by T. J. Hogg, with illustrations by Bliss, was published by the Folio Society, London. Bliss became a member of the Scottish Council of Industrial Design and in 1954 visited the USSR. He was invited by the Swedish and Danish governments to make official visits in 1956. In 1957 the Leverhulme Foundation funded a tour of northern Italy and the Italian government presented him with a medal for promoting Italian culture. A study tour of West Germany followed in 1963. Throughout this period Bliss tirelessly produced paintings. On his retirement in 1964 he was appointed governor of the Derby College of Art and was awarded an honorary DA (diploma in art and design) at Manchester College of Art.<br>
<br>In 1978 Bliss was commissioned to write a biography of Edward Bawden which was published in 1979 by the Pendomer Press, Godalming, Surrey. That year he suffered a slight stroke after the visit of a BBC film unit to record his garden in Derbyshire, which was populated by his grotesque and imaginative sculptures. Yet the following year two exhibitions were held in London at which the Tate Gallery acquired examples of his work. A retrospective exhibition followed at the Hatton Gallery of the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1981, and a further exhibition was held in Derby that year. A second stroke led to Bliss's death at the hospital in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, on 11 March 1984. He was buried on 17 March in Turnditch parish church, near Belper, Derbyshire. A further retrospective exhibition was held at the Museum and Art Gallery, Derby, in 1996.<br>
<br>In both his art and his writing Bliss was an outspoken defender of the British cultural heritage, especially in Scotland where he was instrumental in preserving the designs and furniture of Charles Rennie Mackintosh, whose most celebrated building he occupied during his directorship of the Glasgow School of Art. The Ingram Street tea-rooms in Glasgow, designed by Mackintosh, owe their survival at least in part to Bliss. He was a sharp critic of artists, both past and present, who made their own importance a priority, and he lampooned their styles and self-esteem in a long series of watercolours. He was also charming in day-to-day life, however, and his articulate criticisms, when they came, found their recipients unguarded and defenceless. Public collections of Bliss's works are in the National Museum and Gallery of Wales, Cardiff; the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh; Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum; Royal Leamington Spa Art Gallery and Museum; Perth Museum and Art Gallery; the Tate collection; and the British Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum, London. His work was also acquired by the National Art Collections Fund and the Contemporary Art Society.<br>
