<span class="headword">Stack,  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1833), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Ireland, coming from a family styled Stack de Crotto, three members of which served in the French army in the eighteenth century. Edward entered the French army in early life, and became an aide-de-camp to Louis XV. In 1777 he became lieutenant and accompanied La Fayette to America to aid the colonists in their revolt. He was on the <i>Bonhomme Richard</i> on 23 September 1779 when her commander, Paul Jones, captured the <i>Serapis</i> in the North Sea. Shortly afterwards he was placed in command of Dillon's regiment in the Irish brigade, and proceeded to the West Indies, where he served under the marquis de Bouill&eacute;, governor of the Windward Islands, and assisted in taking Tobago, St Kitts, Nevis, and Montserrat from the British. He was promoted captain in 1789, and for his services in America was made chevalier de St Louis and chevalier de Cincinnatus d'Am&eacute;rique.<br>
<br>Stack remained in Dillon's regiment until the French Revolution, when he entered the British service as an officer of the Irish brigade. He became lieutenant-colonel in the 5th regiment on 1 October 1794. The brigade was disbanded in 1798, but he was promoted to a colonelcy on half pay on 1 January 1801. On the rupture of the peace of Amiens in 1803, he was one of those detained in France by Bonaparte. Released on parole, in 1804 he was detected while performing a secret mission for the British government, and was to have been shot with the duc d'Enghien, but was reprieved at the last minute; he was first imprisoned at Biche for three years, and then at Verdun. He was released in 1814 on the restoration of the Bourbons.<br>
<br>While in captivity Stack was promoted to the rank of major-general in the British army on 25 April 1808, and to that of lieutenant-general on 4 January 1813. After his release he was made a general on 22 July 1830. He was &#145;tall and thin in person, sprightly and elegant, his manners most accomplished&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 226). He died at Calais, France, at a great age, in December 1833.<br>
