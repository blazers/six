<span class="headword">Angel,  Moses</span>  (1817/18&#150;1898), <span class="occ">headmaster and journal editor</span>, was one of the eleven children of Emmanuel Moses (<i>d</i>. 1841), a publican, and his wife, Sarah. At some stage he transposed his name from Angel Moses to Moses Angel, probably in 1839 when his father was convicted at the Old Bailey for his part in a great coach robbery.<br>
<br>In an interview given in the last year of his life (in <span class="italic">Young Israel</span>, 1898), Moses Angel said that at a young age he had been virtually adopted by a &#145;non-Jewish gentleman&#146;. At the age of eight, he became a boarder at Henry Solomon's school in Hammersmith, where he was made school captain. He attended University College School in 1831 and 1832, and was immediately placed in the sixth form. By special grace of the council of University College, London, he was allowed to sit in on their lectures, and matriculated at the age of fourteen. It was intended that he should enter the law, but just when he was due to start his patron's business failed and his legal career was aborted.<br>
<br>Thrown back on his own resources, in 1838 Angel started work as a clerk at the Dublin branch of the Provincial Bank of Ireland. He left in 1840 to take up a position as English master at the Jews' Free School, in Bell Lane, Spitalfields, London. In August 1842 he was elevated to headmaster, an office he held for fifty-five unbroken years until he retired in November 1897. He was also appointed editor of the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>, the first edition of which appeared in October 1841, and he later joined the rival publication, <span class="italic">Voice of Jacob</span>. For a short time he combined his teaching and editing duties, but resigned from the journals when he no longer had time to meet both commitments.<br>
<br>A practising Orthodox Jew, Angel married Rebecca, daughter of G. Godfrey, on 11 January 1843. The couple had three sons and three daughters, and for many years their home was the master's house on the school premises. Autocratic and meticulous, Moses Angel had an indomitably strong will and resolute perseverance. A superb teacher, organizer, and administrator, he believed that discipline led to efficiency, and presided over the growth of the school roll from 500 pupils to 4250; it was the largest elementary school in Great Britain, and probably in the world, at that time. &#145;He has the School in his entire command&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>, 14 July 1854), wrote Matthew Arnold on his first inspection of the Jews' Free School in 1843. Forward-looking, he was held in high esteem by government. A. J. Mundella, minister of education, said that when he wanted an impartial opinion &#145;free from prejudice, free from all selfishness, there is no man I can apply to with so much confidence as to Mr Angel&#146;  (ibid., 4 Jan 1889).<br>
<br>Despite his enormous administrative burden, Angel was at the school entrance when pupils arrived, and saw them off at the end of the day. He moved around the school constantly, but still found time to teach several classes each week, at all levels. The school's curriculum and facilities, largely due to the beneficent support of the Rothschild family, were a remarkable achievement for an elementary school of that time. Its teachers were drawn almost exclusively from the ranks of former pupils and pupil-teachers, each one of whom benefited from his personal supervision when they attended University College, London, to obtain their teacher's qualification.<br>
<br>According to James Picciotto, Angel's numerous contributions to the Anglo-Jewish press, usually under the <i>nom de plume</i> A, displayed great erudition and marked literary powers  (Picciotto, 406). Angel's well-received book <span class="italic">The Law of Sinai and its Appointed Times</span> (1858) was written in the hope that it would contribute to a better understanding between Jew and Christian.<br>
<br>During Moses Angel's time as headmaster, one-third of all London's Jewish children, a high percentage of whom were foreign-born, passed through his hands. The school was Anglo-Jewry's main vehicle for integrating the Jewish poor into English society, and in this regard Angel probably had more influence in moulding nineteenth- and twentieth-century Anglo-Jewry than any other individual. He died at his London home, 12 Randolph Crescent, Maida Vale, on 2 September 1898, in his eighty-first year, and was buried in the Willesden cemetery of the United Synagogue.<br>
