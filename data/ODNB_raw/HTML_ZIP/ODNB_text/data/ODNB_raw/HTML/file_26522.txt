<span class="headword">Stichill,  Robert  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1274), <span class="occ">bishop of Durham</span>, presumably took his name from the village in Roxburghshire where Durham Priory held the patronage of the parish church. He was the son of a priest, quite possibly Master William Scot (or William of Stichill), rector of one of Durham's Yorkshire churches and archdeacon of Worcester, who was elected (abortively) to the see of Durham in 1226. Robert of Stichill became a monk of Durham and, having put aside youthful levity, rebelliousness, and ill temper in favour of the study of scripture, was one of the monks entrusted with obtaining the bishop's licence for the election of a prior in 1244; in 1249 he was one of those sent to the king for licence to elect a bishop. By 1246 he was sacrist of the monastery, and he was prior of the highly favoured dependent cell at Finchale when, on 30 September 1260, he was the first of their number to be successfully elected bishop by the Durham monks; a dispensation for the defect of his birth had apparently already been obtained by his fellow monk Henry of Horncastle. The temporalities of the see were restored to him on 5 December and he was consecrated by the archbishop of York, Godfrey of Ludham (<i>d</i>. 1265), in Southwell on 13 February 1261.<br>
<br>The best-attested activities of Stichill's pontificate are those relating to his relations with the Durham community. He granted to the priory tracts of wood and moorland amounting to 1300 acres; one of the books that the monks claimed against Bishop Antony (I) Bek in 1302 was a copy of a volume of the <span class="italic">Decretals</span>, said to be a gift of Stichill and worth 80 marks. But there was also dissension, for during December 1272 and January 1273 Stichill, having resisted Prior Hugh of Darlington's repeated requests to be allowed to resign, then objected to details of the provision made for his support in retirement. He went on to complain of the monks' failure to make their professions before him as head of the cathedral community, to appoint as custodian of the vacant priory the constable of Durham Castle, a layman, whose unprecedented intrusions he declined to restrain, and to cavil over the wording of the monks' petition for licence to elect a new prior. The Lanercost chronicle also reports that there was a three-year dispute over visitation.<br>
<br>Stichill was prompt in defence of his secular rights, most notably those pertaining to the palatinate&#151;the regalian liberty of the bishopric of Durham. In November 1266 his officers were obstructing the payment of aid on merchandise to the king. When Henry III made a grant of the manor of Greatham in co. Durham, forfeited by Peter de Montfort for his rebellion in the barons' war, Stichill secured a royal revocation in May 1267 that acknowledged the bishop's right to forfeitures within his regality, so establishing an important precedent. When he obtained the assistance of the royal courts in a case before his own court in December 1269, it was acknowledged that his liberty was held of the king and the crown as the king's special alms. Elsewhere he was successful, defending in 1268 his right to the return of writs in the liberty of Howden, in accordance with a grant of Richard I. The Lanercost chronicle records that he deprived the burgesses of Durham of free pasture.<br>
<br>Having bought out any claim to the manor of Greatham by the Bertram family, Stichill founded there in 1273 a hospital for forty paupers; this still flourishes. In 1274 he attended the second Council of Lyons, and obtained permission to resign his see, but he died at the castle of l'Arbresle near Lyons, on 4 August, and was buried at the Benedictine abbey of Savigny. His heart was taken back to Durham for interment.<br>
