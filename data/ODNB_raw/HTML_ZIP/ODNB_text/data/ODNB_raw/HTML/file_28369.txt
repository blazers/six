<span class="headword">Wadding,  Luke</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Francis]</span>  (1588&#150;1657), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and historian</span>, was born in Waterford, Ireland, on 16 October 1588 and baptized on 18 October, St Luke's day.<h2>
<a name="Familybackground"></a>Family background</h2>Wadding was the eleventh of fourteen children of Walter Wadding (<i>d</i>. 1602), merchant, and Anastasia Lombard (<i>d</i>. 1602). The family, originally from Wexford, had land near Tramore Bay and a tomb in the Franciscan friary in Waterford; they were Old English, and three of them became mayors of the city in Luke's time. Other forms of the surname are Waddy and Wotton. Luke is sometimes confused with his first cousin, Luke Wadding SJ (<i>d</i>. 1651) of Salamanca, and with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68236/', "Luke Wadding")</script>, bishop of Ferns from 1683 or 1684 to 1687. His brother Ambrose became a Jesuit lecturer, as did his first cousins <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28370/', "Peter Wadding")</script> and Michael Wadding, the latter being better known in Mexico as Miguel God&iacute;nez. Other famous relatives included six bishops, Peter Lombard (Armagh, 1601&#150;25), Thomas Walsh (Cashel, 1626&#150;54), David Rothe (Ossory, 1618&#150;50), John Roche (Ferns, 1624&#150;36), Patrick Comerford (Waterford, 1629&#150;52), and Nicholas French (Ferns, 1645&#150;78). The Jesuit Peter Sherlock, rector of Irish colleges in Spain, and Andrew Wyse, grand prior of the knights of Malta, were also related to Wadding. Two of his nephews, Francis Harold and Bonaventure Baron, followed him into the Franciscans; the former became his biographer and successor as chronicler of the order, while the latter (brother of the lawyer Geoffrey, an important envoy for the confederate Catholics) was a lecturer and writer of copious output.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlyworks"></a>Education and early works</h2>There is some confusion about Wadding's early teachers. Peter White in Kilkenny (<i>c</i>.1560s) was too early; a Mrs Barden, a Father Dermot O'Callaghan, and fugitive priests have been suggested; another possibility is John Flahy, that &#145;famous and very fortunate schoolmaster&#146; in Waterford, &#145;to whom especially the province of Munster is beholden for good breeding&#146;  (Comerford, 19). Wadding himself said that his father watched over his Catholic training and his education; and Harold recorded that Luke's brother Matthew tutored him in elementary logic and physics, and that he received a good grounding in Latin (the language of the family prayer book, the <span class="italic">Pius Quintus</span>), and could write Latin when he was thirteen. Later he learned Hebrew and Greek, and quickly became fluent in Portuguese, Spanish (Castilian), and Italian. A poem in Irish, eight lines in honour of Nicolaus Claudius Fabricius Peyresius, was published in Rome in 1638, but this may be a translation by another friar in St Isidore's of a short eulogy in Latin by Wadding.<br>
<br>Luke's parents died in 1602&#151;his mother of the plague, and she was not buried in the family grave. The following year Matthew, a merchant, brought Luke to Lisbon and placed him with his cousins under the Jesuits in the Irish College, where he continued his studies for six months. He left it to join the Franciscans in September 1604 at the friary of the Immaculate Conception, Matozinhos, near Porto. He was given the name Francis in religion, and sometimes used the title Luke of St Francis. He made his profession on 23 September 1605; he studied the philosophy of Duns Scotus and his school for two years at Leiria, and theology first at Lisbon and then, from 1609, at the University of Coimbra under various professors including the Jesuit Francisco Su&aacute;rez. He had begun to edit the writings of St Francis of Assisi when he was ordained in Vizeu in 1613. He preached in Portuguese and Spanish, and compiled two manuscript volumes of quotations from the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, the fathers, and others. His talents attracted attention, and the vicar-general of the Franciscans, Antonio de Trejo, brought him to the Franciscan province of St James in Spain, of which he became a member. He studied Hebrew in Alba de Tormes, and taught theology at Le&oacute;n and at the University of Salamanca while he was director of the Franciscan students and chaplain to the Poor Clares. In 1614 he was asked to publish the summa of cases of conscience by the Franciscan Manoel Rodrigues, and in 1618 the spiritual talks of the Franciscan Luis de Miranda. When the Salamanca friary was redecorated for the general chapter of 1618, he provided 268 lines of Latin verse for a long series of paintings there of Franciscan popes, cardinals, martyrs, and writers, which were published later. Here it can be added that he did not write the Christmas poem (two verses) repeatedly attributed to him; it is from a Wexford carol collected or written by Father William Devereux (<i>d</i>. 1771).<h2>
<a name="WorkfortheSpanishdelegation"></a>Work for the Spanish delegation</h2>Antonio de Trejo became a bishop in July 1618, and as King Philip III's special <i>orator</i> was sent to Rome to plead before Pope Paul V for the defining of the doctrine of the immaculate conception of Mary, &#145;in order to remedy the grave scandals [concerning the doctrine] which were threatening the public peace of his kingdom&#146;  (Bali&#263;, 474); he took Wadding with him as his theologian and secretary. They arrived on 17 December 1618 and stayed with Cardinal Gabriel de Trejo, the bishop's brother. Wadding moved to the friary of San Pietro in Montorio in Trastevere, where Hugh O'Neill, earl of Tyrone, had been buried in 1616 beside his son, the baron of Dungannon, and his brothers-in-law, Ruairi and Cathbharr O'Donnell. Through the Franciscans in Spain and Rome the Old English Wadding made contact with Old Irish persons and ideas. He was asked to save the writings of Angelo del Paz (<i>d</i>. 1596), who had lived in San Pietro, and, with the help of Anthony Hickey, edited some of his scripture commentaries in 1623&#150;8; he was to follow Angelo's example as a fervent Franciscan, writer, editor, and founder of a library. Wadding moved between the friary in Trastevere and the head house at Aracoeli, and finally to San Isidoro (see below). His collection of discussions, orations, and reports for the <i>legatio</i> of Philip III and Philip IV to Paul V and Gregory XV he sent privately to Florence Conry in Louvain; but it was printed there without Luke's permission in 1624, and a folio edition appeared in Antwerp in 1641. This work established his fame in Rome; and about it Charles Bali&#263; OFM wrote, &#145;side by side with his [Wadding's] tenacity, there stand out his profound theological learning, his vast erudition, his prudence, and his uncommon tact&#146;  (ibid., 475). Wadding continued to work for this ongoing commission, and much later (when illness had restricted his activities) published three further volumes in Rome, <span class="italic">Immaculatae conceptioni B. Mariae virginis non adversari eius mortem corporalem</span> (1655), <span class="italic">De redemptione B. Mariae virginis</span> (1656), and <span class="italic">De baptismo B. Mariae virginis</span> (1656).<br>
<br>Such work in speculative theology entailed the study of scripture, and Wadding knew Hebrew. In 1621 he edited by papal request four large volumes of concordances of the Hebrew <span class="roman">Bible</span> by Friar Marius (<i>d</i>. 1620) from Cajazzo, with whom he had lived. This entailed his making special printing arrangements at Aracoeli, and writing under various pseudonyms all the preliminary articles. In 1624 Wadding enlarged and edited a Latin concordance of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> (concerned with virtues and vices) then attributed to St Anthony of Padua but in fact the work of several Franciscans  (Kleinhans). He appended to it a <span class="italic">Promptuarium sacrae scripturae</span>, a preachers' aid, by an anonymous Irish Franciscan. His work for the Spanish delegation also entailed a study of the teaching of John Duns Scotus. Eager to free him from the ignominious title of &#145;dunce&#146; and the myths repeated by the Dominican Abraham Bzowski (Bzovius), Wadding began to prepare an edition of the Scotsman's writings, with an account of his life that included a tactful discussion of the question of his country of origin and commentaries by other Irish friars (see below). Written in twelve tomes, some in two parts, it was eventually published in sixteen volumes in 1639. Collecting everything that was thought to be by St Francis, Wadding had the first edition of his works printed at Antwerp in 1623. It included commentaries and a preface wherein Wadding explained what inspired the work: his resolve to answer the attacks of others on the saint and his followers as ignorant and unlettered men. This explains, too, his two printed refutations of Augustinian theories about St Francis; it explains his labours on the writings of Scotus and on his <i>magnum opus</i>, the <span class="italic">Annales minorum</span>, a history of the Franciscan order from 1208 to 1540, in eight folio volumes (1625&#150;54), begun when he was in the friary of San Pietro in Montorio, and compiled from material gathered also by Bartolomeo Cimarelli, Jakob Pohl, and others. His collection of papal bulls appended to each volume inspired the <span class="italic">Bullarium Franciscanum</span>. It explains, too, his very useful <span class="italic">Scriptores ordinis minorum</span>, with a list of martyrs (1650), and his books and essays on Franciscans, as well as work in progress on the general chapters, rules, and constitutions of the order, and the contents of old Franciscan libraries. As he said: &#145;My research-work [on St Francis] intensified my purpose, while the joy at what I found aroused the desire to find still more&#146;  (Mooney, &#145;Writings of Father Luke Wadding&#146;). His <span class="italic">B. P. Francisci Assisiatis opuscula</span> appeared in many small editions.<h2>
<a name="FoundationofStIsidoresCollege"></a>Foundation of St Isidore's College</h2>As the Franciscans were then being persecuted in Ireland, Wadding wished to set up a house for Irish candidates in Rome. The minister-general asked him to make use of a new Spanish Franciscan foundation, an unfinished and debt-laden friary and church (between Ludovisi and Barberini properties) dedicated to the recently canonized farmer St Isidore of Madrid (1622), to whom King Philip III was devoted. Wadding took responsibility for the building in June 1625, and it is presumed that he became a member of the Irish Franciscan province about this time. With the help of his generous neighbours and others, he completed the church, and over the years famous artists such as Carlo Maratti, Pier Naldini, Andrea Sacchi, and Gianlorenzo Bernini decorated its side-chapels for wealthy patrons. The friary became a house of prayer as well as a famous school. There the students defended theses in philosophy and theology in the presence of distinguished guests, cardinals, and even a pope, Innocent X, in 1649. Many of them went on to lecture on Scotist philosophy and theology in Franciscan and other schools throughout Europe.<br>
<br>There, too, the students of the Irish College attended lectures from 1628 to 1635. The cardinal protector of Ireland (from 1623), Ludovico Ludovisi, nephew of Pope Gregory XV, having taken the advice of Luke Wadding and John Roche (then made bishop of Ferns), had begun to provide for six students chosen by Wadding. They first attended the Collegio Romano under the Jesuits, whom the cardinal favoured. Then a house was rented for them across the street from St Isidore's so that they could attend lectures there. It was referred to in some early account books as the seminary of St Patrick (other Irish colleges on the continent were dedicated to him), and was also known as the Collegium Ludovisianum. The cardinal, who died in 1632, supplied the necessary ongoing financial support, which was doubled in his will and a large vineyard with fruit trees in Castel Gandolfo donated; but his testament revealed that he wanted the education of the students to be in the hands of the experienced Jesuits. This was a blow to Wadding, who had inspired the project and drawn up the statutes for the college, and was its first president. He contested the provision with the support of the cardinal's brother, Prince Ludovisi, but the case went against him, and the ruling in favour of the Jesuits came into effect in January 1635. Wadding was consulted about the problems involved in founding Irish friaries in Prague and Wielun (Poland); in 1648 he was instrumental in having erected necessary accommodation at the head friary (Aracoeli) for the Franciscan representatives of some northern European provinces of the order, including Ireland; and in the year before his death he was given permission to make his final foundation, a noviciate house for the Irish friars, attached to the church of Santa Maria del Piano at Capranica, north of Rome, near Viterbo. Apart from visits to Umbria and Naples in particular, it seems that Wadding stayed mostly in Rome. It was at Viterbo in 1656 that he arranged for the printing of <span class="italic">De oculo morali</span>, moral and spiritual applications for prelates and others of the current scientific knowledge of the eye. Wadding tried hard to prove that the author was the Franciscan John of Wales, but it is now attributed to Pierre de Limoges (Petrus de Seperia, known to Wadding as La Cepiera). He had already printed in Rome in 1655 a combined <span class="italic">Florilegium de vita et dictis illustrium philosophorum et breviloquium de sapientia sanctorum</span> by the same author. About two dozen of Wadding's works were published, and about six more prepared for the press; besides these he had planned to edit further works by Angelo del Paz and John of Wales, a history of episcopal sees, and the lives of six recent popes and the cardinals they had appointed.<br>
<br>There is some evidence for a Carmelite influence on Wadding's spirituality. In 1637 he published a book on the life and deeds of Blessed Peter Thomas of Aquitaine (<i>d</i>. 1366), a Carmelite patriarch of Constantinople; in his preface he explained the Franciscan connections that had induced him to print it, &#145;out of gratitude for the most holy order, which I venerate highly&#146;. In Spain Wadding had studied Hebrew at Alba de Tormes where Teresa of Avila, who reformed the Carmelites, had died in 1582, only six years before Wadding was born. She was canonized in 1622 together with Isidore of Madrid, the patron of the church taken over by Wadding, which had been founded by Alcantarine Franciscans in 1621. Peter of Alcantara, counsellor to Teresa, had been beatified in that same year (he had died on the feast of St Luke). Wadding would have been impressed by the ceremonies; thirty-five years later his attendance at a sermon in honour of Blessed Peter brought on pneumonia and his death. He left an annotated notebook that contains spiritual exercises based on a Discalced Carmelite source.<h2>
<a name="Churchandpolitics"></a>Church and politics</h2>Wadding was a much respected consultant to some Roman congregations and commissions, and he planned to edit selected material from such sources. By the early 1630s archbishops and bishops in Ireland were seeking his help in the matter of appointments to vacant sees and other offices. The Holy Office and the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (founded in 1622) consulted him on matters relating to the church there; in 1634 on recovering some of the places in the Holy Land; in 1637&#150;9 on the theological problems of missionaries in China; in 1640 on an Armenian union with the Holy See; and in 1644 on a revision of the Arabic <span class="roman">Bible</span> and the ritual of the Greek church. He assisted the Congregation for Rites in the reform of the breviary ordered by Pope Urban VIII in 1629, compiling new readings when he could, and taking the opportunity to have the feast of St Patrick inserted into the calendar for the universal church. As a consultor for the Holy Office and the Congregation of the Index he was involved in the controversy concerning the doctrine of grace, opposing the Jesuit leniency; but he failed to detect the denial of free will in Cornelius Jansen's <span class="italic">Augustinus</span>, and thought that the propositions taken from it could be given an orthodox interpretation, but he accepted their condemnation. In his writings he appears &#145;an upright and unbiassed man&#146;  (Ceyssens).<br>
<br>Nevertheless Wadding was bitterly attacked, even by a minister-general of his order. From the beginnings of the Irish College in Rome the perpetual dissensions between Old Irish and Old English arose among the students. After the death of Cardinal Ludovisi in 1632 a list of complaints against Wadding was sent to the new cardinal protector of Ireland by a disgruntled person in Rome (possibly a Jesuit student from Connaught), who claimed some backing, but whose statements were suspect. He said that for about four years Wadding had been practically the only one in the city supplying information for appointments in Ireland even though he had been out of the country since he was a child (&#145;ab infantia fere&#146;); and that he favoured his own province (Munster) and class (Old English merchants), and impeded the applications made for other candidates, even by the earls of Tyrone and Tyrconnell &#145;who had fought against Queen Isabella of England for nearly twenty years&#146;! He asked that a special inquiry be made into the abuses that he listed by the secretary of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, Francesco Ingoli, who, incidentally, knew Wadding very well; it seems that nothing came of the request  (Jennings, &#145;Miscellaneous documents&#146;, 184&#150;7). Twenty years later the old brew of rivalries boiled over again, and a previous friend of Wadding's, the Franciscan Pedro Manero, who had become minister-general, complained bitterly to the king of Spain about his activities in 1653&#150;4 which were thought to be pro-French and anti-Irish. The Spaniards had lost influence in Rome and the French party was predominant. The Old Irish clung to the dream of Spanish help for Ireland, while the Old English there favoured the French connection with the king of England. Internal Franciscan politics, Irish and European, were mixed into the brew, and Wadding had to drink a bitter draught of provincial jealousies. In 1654 a clique wanted him out of St Isidore's, and Francis Magruairk poured out his venom in a memorial presented to the king of Spain in the autumn of 1656. He said that Wadding, the Barberini, and others in Rome were to blame for the Cromwellian devastation in Ireland; that Wadding had been a secret agent of the marquess of Ormond, and had got Old English bishops appointed; that the money he collected went not to the Old Irish but to English Youngs, Dutch Harolds, and Jewish Waddings; that he possessed diabolical powers and succeeded where others failed in driving the Irish out of Ireland. Magruairk exhorted King Philip IV to make a name for himself by attacking the Barberini, Mazarin, and Wadding; he accused his fellow friar of ambition, hypocrisy, and calumny, of being harsh and unjust, of refusing to obey the pope, and of causing the deaths of certain persons. In 1665 it was reported that Magruairk had &#145;died a heretic in Dublin&#146;  (Mooney, &#145;Was Wadding a patriotic Irishman?&#146; and &#145;Father Francis Magruairck&#146;).<br>
<br>Wadding had done his best to help the Catholic cause in the war years from 1641, when neither the Spanish king, nor the French, nor the popes Urban VIII and Innocent X wanted to intervene overtly. The Thirty Years' War was still on, and the great powers were watching each other warily. Then the Old Irish rebelled, and the <span class="roman">Act of Adventurers</span> of 24 February 1642 branded all Irish Catholics rebels, and forced the Old English and Old Irish to unite at Kilkenny on 24 October. Even before the confederate Catholics there appointed him agent and procurator in Rome and Italy in December 1642, Wadding put pressure on pope, princes, and others to support his people. He saw the need for sending someone from Rome to get accurate information, to unite the Catholics, and co-ordinate their efforts. He got Pope Urban to send the Oratorian Pierfrancesco Scarampi as special envoy in July 1643, bringing money and arms. Wadding was so highly thought of in Europe that the confederates wished to see him made a cardinal (he blocked that), and votes were cast for him in the papal conclave of 1644. He persuaded the new pope, Innocent X, to send a well-briefed nuncio to Ireland, Archbishop Giovanni Battista Rinuccini, in October 1645. Wadding had earlier helped Owen Roe O'Neill, Thomas Preston, and other Irish officers on the continent to go to Ireland with arms and men; and after the victory at Benburb in 1646, he sent from St Isidore's, by Dionisio Massari, the sword of Hugh O'Neill, earl of Tyrone, to Owen Roe. Others took offence at what was said about this, and Ormond somehow got the sword. It is because of the relatively small amount of money and arms obtained for the confederates in those years that Wadding was called a gun-running priest. But he was caught in the cross-fire between the Irish Catholics, who were split over the question of a foreign protector, and again over the truce of 1643 and 1646 that did not guarantee freedom of religion and conscience, and over the Inchiquin treaty (1648). Wadding was accused of being an Ormondist; the marquess of Ormond (representative of the embattled Charles I) had in fact written to him, as had Queen Henrietta Maria, expecting him to side with the Old English friars who, urged on by Ormond, sought separation from the Old Irish in a divided Franciscan Ireland. For Wadding the important thing was concord among the friars. He tried to pour oil on a very troubled sea, a veritable storm of conflicting interests, English and Irish, French and Roman, Catholic and protestant, clerical and lay. In the end he was bypassed in Rome, and some influential men on the scene held conflicting views about him. The Capuchin Francis Lavalin Nugent (Old English) thought him too Irish; while the pro-Irish nuncio Rinuccini suspected Wadding of turning against him. It was true that he realized how divisive the nuncio's excommunication of the Ormondist Catholics could be; but in May 1649 the friar wrote to congratulate the cardinal on his safe return from Ireland, and said among other things:<blockquote>I confess that every time I hear mention of that infamous peace and the way of acting of that country, or even recall it to my mind, I am ashamed, and regret that I was born among such a people.</blockquote>Was he thinking of his Old English heritage? Wadding said he would not be sorry to see them punished by God, if he did not fear &#145;it might mean the complete extirpation of the Catholic religion&#146;  (Mooney, &#145;Was Wadding a patriotic Irishman?&#146;, 53). Three months later Ireland was struck by the plague in the west and by Cromwell in the east; the Waddings in Waterford lost their lands and were banished to Connaught. It is clear that Wadding was working only for the Catholic religion in Ireland, not for a party; there were Catholics on both sides of the political divide (which was not always strictly Old English versus Old Irish). Wadding wanted to keep them united, and he paid the price of the man in the middle, being attacked by both. He was replaced as guardian of St Isidore's by an ungrateful Paul King, whom he had once ransomed from pirates, one of the Aracoelitani (Irish friars at Aracoeli) who fought to oust Wadding.<h2>
<a name="Assessmentlateryearsanddeath"></a>Assessment, later years, and death</h2>Wadding's life's work was, of course, in the service of the Franciscan order, as an observant religious, a lecturer in theology and preacher, a guardian (four or five times) of a student house with all its problems of administration and discipline, a vice-procurator (1633&#150;4) and vice-commissary of the order (1645); he avoided becoming a definitor or a minister-general. Wadding is best-known as a historian and chronicler, a collector of manuscripts and books, a writer, and an editor of Franciscan texts. He was urged to write an ecclesiastical history of Ireland, but the sources were beyond him, and his confr&egrave;res in Ireland and Louvain were trying to bring them to light. When one takes into account as well his constant work for Roman congregations and voluminous correspondence, one can understand why he was compared with the mythical Briareus of the Hundred Hands; he himself had applied that name to another indefatigable worker for the church, Anselm the younger, bishop of Lucca (1071&#150;86), friend of Pope Gregory VII, whose life and minor spiritual works he published in 1657 as a model for prelates; it was dedicated to Cardinal Marco Antonio Franciotto, a former bishop of Lucca, to whom he felt particularly bound and had already dedicated his <span class="italic">Scriptores</span>. Wadding was not alone; he had helpers, learned companions, and paid copyists, such as Jean Claude Thierry from Besan&ccedil;on. John Punch helped with the works of John Duns Scotus, and good use was made as well of the earlier commentaries by Maurice O'Fehily and Hugh MacCaughwell. Most notably Anthony Hickey (<i>d</i>. 1641), one of the best theologians in Rome at that time, joined his confr&egrave;re in his labours for the immaculate conception, for the revision of the breviary, for the church in the East, and for the honour of Scotus. Wadding's nephew Francis Harold was at hand to assist him, especially in his last years. Wadding needed all the help he could get; Harold recorded that sickness laid him low for a total of two months in every year. From his student days in Lisbon he suffered at times from severe headaches and vomiting; he had chronic nasal problems and bronchitis, but the worst pain of all for him was not being able to get on with his work. We are told he was of medium height and had fair hair. A portrait (now in Killiney, co. Dublin), dated 1645, when he was fifty-seven, shows him round-faced, almost clean-shaven, with a shiny pate; not at all like the ascetic, bearded Father Luke seen in later portraits by Ribera (disputed) and Maratti. When he was sixty-three Wadding became very ill, and was not expected to live. Thereafter, for the last seven years of his life, he was unable to go out without transport; but he continued to write and to meet people. He probably met the young Oliver Plunket, who was ordained on 1 January 1654 in Rome by an Irish Franciscan, Anthony MacGeoghegan, bishop of Clonmacnoise; Plunket had been ten years in Rome by the time of Luke Wadding's death. In his last illness he was visited several times by Pope Alexander VII, by cardinals, princes, prelates, and courtiers. As famous for sanctity as for learning  (<span class="italic">Acta sanctorum</span>, Maii, 3.546), Wadding died at St Isidore's Friary, Rome, at 10 a.m. on Sunday 18 November 1657. An autopsy revealed diseased lungs, one kidney destroyed, a large gallstone, and an enlarged heart. In view of his many painful illnesses, the amount of work he did was most remarkable. It was said of him, &#145;No man ever served so successfully and so faithfully so many causes with so few resources&#146;  (see McClean, <span class="italic">Bethlehem</span>, 11). Wadding was buried in St Anthony's chapel in St Isidore's three days later, when the church was filled to overflowing. A Dominican preached the funeral oration, and Wadding's epitaph was written by a lawyer friend, Hercule Ronconio. A new tomb was erected in 1890, but the remains were later placed in the crypt. So well known worldwide was the name of Luke Wadding that, about two years after his death, an Irishman condemned to death in Mexico, wishing to make a good impression on his judges, claimed to be related to him. The man was William Lamport from Wexford, whose extraordinary escapades probably gave rise to the story of Zorro.<br>
