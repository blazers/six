<span class="headword">Stewart,  Robert</span>, earl of Lennox and earl of March  (1522/3&#150;1586), <span class="occ">bishop-elect of Caithness and magnate</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26487/', "John Stewart, twelfth or third earl of Lennox (d. 1526)")</script>, and his wife, Elizabeth Stewart, daughter of the first earl of Atholl. In 1548 he was a student at St Andrews, and he later disposed of books which suggest that he retained an interest in theology, since they included works by Bullinger, Calvin, and Erasmus. Briefly provost of Lincluden collegiate church in 1529, in the following year he was provided to the provostry of the collegiate church of Dumbarton, though he does not appear to have occupied the benefice until 1539. Having resigned it in 1546 he was reinstated in 1564, retaining the dignity until 1570. On 8 September 1541 he was nominated bishop of Caithness and papally provided on 27 January following. As he was too young to be ordained priest he was only the administrator of the diocese&#151;he could not receive title to the see until his twenty-seventh year. In fact he was never consecrated bishop, but he none the less retained the revenues for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Following the death of James V on 14 December 1542 the third earl of Arran was appointed governor of Scotland. However, Robert's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26497/', "Matthew Stewart, thirteenth or fourth earl of Lennox")</script>, had returned from France to contest the appointment and when Arran, having at first responded to English diplomacy, changed tack late in 1543 and allied himself with France, Lennox, who had come to Scotland as Arran's agent, promptly became agent for Henry VIII. On 17 May 1544 Robert Stewart, who was to remain in England as a hostage, was a signatory at Carlisle to the indenture whereby his brother (and the third earl of Glencairn) undertook to promote religious reform and to provide support to English military operations in south-west Scotland, while Henry VIII agreed to Lennox's becoming governor and to his marrying Margaret Douglas, only daughter and heir of the sixth earl of Angus and Margaret Tudor, widow of James V and Henry's sister. Lennox's military campaign failed, but the marriage took place on 6 July following, leading to the earl's forfeiture for treason on 9 October.<br>
<br>In December 1545 Robert Stewart's activities had been referred to the pope by Arran's government, with the request that he be summoned to Rome and that Alexander Gordon, brother of the fourth earl of Huntly, be provided to the see. Gordon appears to have received some of the revenues, and only withdrew his claim in 1548. Stewart obtained a crown remission and escaped forfeiture, but his revenues were sequestrated by Cardinal Beaton on the grounds of his political association with Henry VIII, so he remained in England. On 24 March 1546, though still not of canonical age, he was appointed by the crown to the canonry of the eleventh prebend in Canterbury Cathedral. He had resigned it by 9 May 1548. Only three weeks after his preferment at Canterbury he returned to Scotland; he arrived at Dumbarton on 27 May 1546, and submitted himself to the crown and governor on 16 July. Following two years of negotiations it was resolved on 6 August 1548 that Gordon should renounce his claim to the diocese of Caithness in return for a pension, and Stewart was restored to the see. In September 1550 he went to France (at his own request) in the retinue of the queen dowager, Mary of Guise. He returned no earlier than October 1551.<br>
<br>Stewart now took up the administration of his diocese. Until at least 1558, when he attended the execution of the protestant Walter Mylne, he seems to have remained conservative in religion, and his management of his bishopric was in some respects old-fashioned too, for in 1553 he granted all the lands of his see to his brother-in-law, the eleventh earl of Sutherland. Yet he may have been influenced by the evangelical sympathies of his brother the earl of Lennox, and also by his own stay in England, for by 1561 the English ambassador wrote of Stewart, who was then in Edinburgh, that he &#145;comes daily to the sermon and is reputed honest enough&#146;  (Donaldson, 58). Stewart resided in his diocese almost continuously throughout the 1560s and applied himself to reforming its parishes, above all by installing protestant ministers, who were maintained partly at his own expense. Donald Munro, archdeacon of the isles and commissioner of Ross, was appointed to assist Stewart in preaching and establishing churches, no doubt because he knew Gaelic. A year later it was reported that Stewart himself &#145;sometimes preaches&#146;  (Kirk, 215).<br>
<br>In October 1570 Stewart's appointment as commendator of St Andrews Priory largely ended his involvement with his diocese. The administration of the latter was left to commissioners, while Stewart was reported (by James Melville, admittedly a highly partial witness) to have devoted much of his time to golf and archery. In 1576 his nephew Charles Stewart, earl of Lennox, died leaving only a daughter, and on 16 June 1578 Robert as his male heir was created earl. Early in 1580, however, he was persuaded to resign the title in favour of the king's favourite, Esm&eacute; Stewart, and on 5 March he was created earl of March instead. On 6 December 1578 he had married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69924/', "Elizabeth Stewart (c.1554&#150;1595?)")</script>, daughter of the fourth earl of Atholl, but on 19 May 1581 she divorced him on grounds of impotency (though he is reported to have had an illegitimate daughter), and shortly afterwards she married James Stewart, earl of Arran, with whose child she was already pregnant. Robert Stewart had resigned his office in St Andrews by October 1585, but he remained nominally the diocesan of Caithness until he died in St Andrews on 29 August 1586, aged sixty-three. He was buried in St Leonard's Church, St Andrews.<br>
