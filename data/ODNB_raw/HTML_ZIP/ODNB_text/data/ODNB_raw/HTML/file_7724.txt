<span class="headword">Dockwra <span class="st"> [Dockwray]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1635?, <em>d.</em> 1716), <span class="occ">promoter of the penny post and copper and brass manufacturer</span>, was born in the parish of St Olave Jewry, London, and was almost certainly the son of John Dockrey (<i>d</i>. 1646&times;50), armourer, and his wife, Margaret, baptized there on 26 April 1635. William was apprenticed in 1651 to Anthony Hatch of the Armourers' Company. He was probably the William Dockwra who, on 16 May 1661, married Rebekah Dukeson at St Clement Danes, London; his will mentions his wife Rebekah. They had nine children. The marriage of his niece, Mary Davies, to Sir Thomas Grosvenor of Eaton in Cheshire provided an influential contact with that family.<br>
<br>In the 1660s Dockwra was able to secure an official position at the London custom house. His involvement in the African slave trade was later challenged by the Royal African Company in defence of its monopoly. As a consequence he suffered losses in 1676 when the <i>Ann</i>, a merchant ship in which he had the major share, was seized. On bringing an action against those responsible and petitioning for redress, Dockwra further alienated the company and its supporters. He suffered additional losses in other aspects of his African trade.<br>
<br>In 1683, at a time when no adequate provision existed for the carriage of letters and parcels between different parts of London, Dockwra improved upon an idea suggested and partly implemented by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19646/', "Robert Murray (bap. 1633, d. 1725?)")</script> to establish a penny postal system in the city. He secured a patent allowing letters and parcels taken in at the receiving houses in principal streets to be carried by messengers at hourly intervals to six large &#145;grand offices&#146;. When the letters and parcels were sorted and registered, other messengers delivered them six or eight times a day in central streets near the exchange. Within the city 1<i>d</i>. was charged for delivery of letters and parcels not exceeding 1 lb in weight, or any sum of money, or parcels of not more than &pound;10 in value. In the suburbs there were four deliveries daily at a charge of 2<i>d</i>. for delivery within a given 10 mile radius.<br>
<br>For Dockwra there was little benefit from this enterprise. Complaints resulted from city porters, who felt their interests were threatened, and legal action ensued from the duke of York, to whom revenue had been granted from the Post Office monopoly. This lawsuit resulted in losses of &pound;2000 to Dockwra and the surrender of his patent. In 1690, in recompense for this treatment, parliament granted him a pension of &pound;500 a year for seven years, which was continued on a new patent until 1700. In 1697 he was appointed as comptroller of the penny post, and in that year a poem on his &#145;invention of the penny post&#146; is recorded in a volume entitled <span class="italic">State Poems</span>. He later complained of the transfer of a number of his destinations in favour of the general post. He was then accused of removing the Post Office from Cornhill to a less central station, of detaining and opening letters, and of refusing to take parcels of more than 1 lb in weight, thereby injuring the trade of the Post Office porters. After an investigation by Sir Thomas Frankland and Sir Robert Cotton, postmasters-general, Dockwra was eventually dismissed from his post as a comptroller of the penny post in June 1700.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Dockwra had involved himself in the Armourers' Company, in 1688 becoming a member of the courts of assistants and master between 1692 and 1694. During the 1680s Dockwra had acquired other interests through association with the Grosvenors, owners of lead mines in Flintshire. Acting as London agent for sales of lead from these mines, he learned of new lead-smelting methods being developed at Bristol. The practical application of this work was largely due to John Coster, who was later responsible for extending similar coal-fired techniques to the smelting of copper. The old monopolies, whose failure to establish a lasting production in copper and brass had left the country dependent on expensive imported goods, were restricted by the <span class="roman">Mines Royal Act</span> of 1689. This act, legalizing the formation of new enterprise in this industry, enabled the adoption of the new smelting methods under development.<br>
<br>In 1689 Dockwra led a new partnership, formed to smelt copper ore. Cornish ore was carried by water to Redbrook on the Wye in Gloucestershire to be processed there by Coster. From Redbrook refined copper ingot was transported by Severn and Thames to Esher in Surrey, mainly for the production of brass and for manufacture to finished goods. The Esher works, established in 1690 under a separate partnership led by Dockwra, was convenient to supply the lucrative London market. Formerly the premises had been the brass works of Jacob Momma, who earlier in the century had struggled for survival against the old privileged monopolies and the price manipulation of imports. Under Dockwra brass was now produced in the traditional manner from refined copper and crushed calamine (the carbonate ore of zinc) from Mendip in Somerset. Brass and copper sheet was manufactured by water-powered rolling mills, believed to have been quite new to England. The resulting brass sheet was beaten under water-powered hammers to form pots, pans, and industrial vessels. Brass rod drawn to wire was used for pin manufacture in the first comprehensive works of its kind. By 1696 it was found that such advances in technical expertise provided only small profit margins. A newly introduced manager was dismissed after two years by a leading co-partner when Dockwra himself, now elderly, was withdrawing from practical involvement. The action precipitated a lawsuit, and compensation, culminating in a decline of the Esher works until, in 1709, it came under the control of the brass works at Bristol.<br>
<br>Dockwra's fortune, reduced by his dismissal as comptroller of the penny post, was further depleted by diminishing profit from Esher and by litigation expenses. In 1702 he petitioned Queen Anne for compensation, stating that six of his seven surviving children were unprovided for. In his will, made on 26 October 1712, Dockwra described himself as being over seventy-seven years old and named his wife as his executor. He died on 25 September 1716, regarded implausibly by some contemporaries as &#145;aged near 100&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historical Register</span>, 544). By the time his will was proved on 12 November his wife had died too.<br>
