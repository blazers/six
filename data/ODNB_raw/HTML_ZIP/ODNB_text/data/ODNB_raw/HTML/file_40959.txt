She was ostensibly and legally the child of Peniston Lamb, first Viscount Melbourne (1745&#150;1828), but her natural father was probably <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30141/', "George O'Brien Wyndham, third earl of Egremont (1751&#150;1837)")</script>. She received her formal education (such as it was) from governesses, but learned the skills for her future life as a political hostess from her adored mother and her mother's close friend, Georgiana, duchess of Devonshire. She also acquired their loose interpretation of sexual morality, a firm sense of family, and the &#145;Devonshire House drawl&#146;, a distinctive mode of pronunciation common to the whig aristocracy. She enjoyed a particularly close relationship with two of her four brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15920/', "William Lamb, later second Viscount Melbourne")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15914/', "Frederick Lamb, later Baron Beauvale and third Viscount Melbourne")</script>. (Her only sister, Harriet, died in 1803.)<br>
<br>The charming, coquettish Emily Lamb made her society d&eacute;but in 1804, and her elegant figure, grey eyes, dark hair, and translucent complexion won her many male admirers. Women, especially those of an age to be her rivals in the marriage market, were less taken with her. Lady Melbourne was ambitious for all her children, and encouraged the suit of the young, handsome, rich whig peer Peter Leopold Louis Francis Nassau Cowper, fifth Earl Cowper (1778&#150;1837). The couple were married on 20 July 1805 at Melbourne House in London. But Cowper was dull. Having so much, he lacked ambition, and despite the hopes of the whig grandees he never came to anything as a politician; it was only the sparkle of his wife that kept him from fading completely into obscurity. As early as December 1805 Lady Harriet Cavendish (no admirer of Lady Cowper) observed that:<blockquote>He is never with her and affects great indifference and neglect, though I believe he really cares for her as much as he can for anything and she seems tolerably contented, though I hear she is reduced to rejoice when he comes home drunk, as he talks to her more then than at any other time. (Cavendish, 139)</blockquote>Although initially much in love with her husband, Emily Cowper was not one to put up with such treatment for long. She followed her mother's dictum and provided her husband with an indisputable heir&#151;George, Viscount Fordwich, born in June 1806&#151;and then (her husband complaisant) proceeded on her merry way through a throng of admirers, suitors, and lovers. The paternity of her four further children&#151;Emily, William, (Charles) Spencer, and Frances, born between 1808 and 1820&#151;was a matter for speculation then and is now, but William bore a striking physical resemblance to his mother's most consistent lover, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27112/', "Henry John Temple, third Viscount Palmerston (1784&#150;1865)")</script>, who was also supposed to be the father of her youngest child, Frances.<br>
<br>After Lady Melbourne's death in 1818 Emily assumed responsibility for her brothers, and much of her energy was directed towards the management of (or interference in) their affairs. William's tormented marriage with Lady Caroline Lamb and the wreckage of his political career in the 1820s was a matter of lasting concern, and with Frederick, a career diplomat, she maintained a regular political and social correspondence. She also inherited her mother's role as a leader of fashionable society, becoming (with Lady Jersey and Madame de Lieven) one of the &#145;lady patronesses&#146; of the society balls held at Almack's, and a regular member of the court of George IV. By the late 1820s she had established herself as a hostess to the Canningite whigs, which grouping included both her brother William and her lover Palmerston, at the Cowper mansion, Panshanger, in Hertfordshire. When the widowed Melbourne became home secretary in 1830 and then prime minister in 1834, Lady Cowper naturally assumed the role of his hostess; her ties to the ministry were cemented by Palmerston's position as foreign secretary. She sincerely mourned the death of Lord Cowper, on 27 June 1837, barely a week after the accession of Queen Victoria, and consequently played little public part at the court during the first year of Victoria's reign, though she offered advice to Melbourne on his handling of the young queen. The marriages of her children, especially her daughters, were also a major preoccupation: her namesake, Lady Emily, had inherited all her mother's liveliness, and it was something of a surprise to society at large when in 1830 she decided to marry the earnest, evangelical tory Anthony Ashley-Cooper, later seventh earl of Shaftesbury. Despite considerable personal attractions, her younger daughter, Lady Frances, was more difficult to suit, and Frances was still unmarried when, on 16 December 1839, Emily Cowper and Palmerston were finally married. Lady Frances (who did not like Palmerston) was not amused. The queen, young love embodied, felt sure the match between the elderly couple would make Albert smile, but she gave them a condescending blessing because Palmerston &#145;is quite alone in the world, and <i>Lady C.</i> is a very clever woman, and <i>much</i> attached to him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Queen Victoria</span>, 1st ser., 1.255). But if Victoria and Albert represented the love match of the century, Emily and Palmerston ran them a close second. &#145;What is the use&#146;, Palmerston was to write, &#145;of People being Married, if they are to pass their Lives away from Each other?&#146;  (Reynolds, 6). At the age of sixty-two Emily refused to travel alone with &#145;Poodle&#146; Byng, an old admirer, lest it arouse Palmerston's jealousy.<br>
<br>The wife of the foreign secretary had important social obligations, for in addition to any political entertaining she might undertake on behalf of the ministry, she was expected to receive and entertain the diplomatic corps in London and in the country, and she was required to present the wives and daughters of the corps at court. Lady Palmerston threw herself into the part with gusto, but the ministry was on its last legs, and when it fell in September 1841 she and Palmerston took themselves off on a tour of his Irish property. A period out of office she considered beneficial, for it would allow the whig party, &#145;grown supine and tired&#146;, to &#145;start up like a Giant refreshed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Lady Palmerston</span>, 257).<br>
<br>Lady Palmerston was soon established, in office and out of it, as the premi&egrave;re political hostess in London. Her regular Saturday parties during the season at 5 Carlton House Terrace and, from 1855, at Cambridge House, Piccadilly (which conveniently had two gates, facilitating the arrival and departure of her guests' coaches), were packed with politicians, diplomats, and courtiers, peers, bishops, and office-seekers, as well as a smattering of carefully selected journalists, notably John Delane of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and the inevitable array of d&eacute;butantes with their ambitious mamas. The point about Lady Palmerston's &#145;drums&#146; was that everybody who counted, or who aspired to count, went to them. They served to bolster the governments in which Palmerston was involved, and to forge support for him in opposition, but they were not restricted to his political colleagues. In a time of great fluidity of political parties and personal allegiances, at Lady Palmerston's everyone could meet. Only when Palmerston suffered personal indignity or when party feeling ran particularly high did Lady Palmerston exclude his opponents from her soir&eacute;es, and then only for a few days. But the huge Saturday night parties for hundreds were only part of her role. More intimate gatherings, dinners (often preceding a big evening party), and country house parties at the Palmerstons' Hampshire home, Broadlands, were directed with aplomb by Emily, to explicitly political ends. She was a great believer in the power of social influence, and when a contentious vote was forthcoming in the house she would declare &#145;Stay! we will have a party!&#146;  (Airlie, <span class="italic">Lady Palmerston</span>, 2.43). Few political men cared to admit the power of such influence, the insinuating charm of social recognition, the frisson from hearing the latest political gossip at first hand, the satisfaction of wives and daughters at being invited to balls and parties at Cambridge House; fewer still admitted that their votes in the house, or their acceptance or refusal of office, could be affected by the warmth of Lady Palmerston's greeting, or the heartiness of her husband's; but Palmerston's friends and enemies alike acknowledged the importance of his wife's hospitality in maintaining his position.<br>
<br>Emily Temple entertained indefatigably for her husband for twenty-five years. As importantly, she was his friend and confidante: Henry Greville thought that &#145;no other human being than his wife share[d] his confidence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Henry Greville</span>, 4.259). She was not a political thinker, but had a firm grasp of the realities of the political system and its operation. She had learned her political loyalties at her mother's knee; family, not ideology or party, was her ultimate master, and in her eyes Palmerston could do no wrong. As an intelligence gatherer with sources in Britain and all over continental Europe she had no equal. She had a reputation for indiscretion, but it was always calculated:<blockquote>She always understood full well what she was telling, to whom she was telling it, when and where it would be repeated, and whether the repetition would do harm or good &hellip; no one ever knew from or through Lady Palmerston what Lord Palmerston did not wish to be known. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 15 Sept 1869)</blockquote>After the deaths of her brothers William and Frederick, in 1848 and 1853, she inherited the Lamb estates, at Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire, Melbourne in Derbyshire, and elsewhere. The Palmerstons' health failed slowly but inevitably in the 1860s, but the parties went on, and Emily continued to listen to Palmerston from the ladies' gallery of the House of Commons, or anxiously to await his late-night return from the house. Palmerston died, still in office as prime minister, at Brocket on 18 October 1865. Emily was devastated, but consoled herself with her children and grandchildren. She moved out of Cambridge House into 21 Park Lane in January 1866, and divided her time between Brocket, Broadlands, London, and her children's houses. London society continued to call on Lady Palmerston until her death at Brocket on 11 September 1869; six days later she was buried next to her husband in Westminster Abbey.<br>
