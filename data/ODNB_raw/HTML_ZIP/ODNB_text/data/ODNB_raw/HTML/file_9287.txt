<span class="headword">Fenner,  Dudley</span>  (<em>c.</em>1558&#150;1587), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and Calvinist theologian</span>, was a native of Kent, said by the puritan printer Robert Waldegrave to have been &#145;heir of great possessions&#146;  (Fenner, <span class="italic">Certain Godly and Learned Treatises</span>, Waldegrave's Epistle). He matriculated fellow-commoner of Peterhouse in 1575, but left Cambridge without taking a degree, in his own words, &#145;pluckte from the university as from the sweetest brestes of the nurse&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), for reasons unknown but which may have had to do with the puritanism which soon manifested itself. No graduate, Fenner was the most learned of the &#145;godly ministers&#146; of his generation, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Thomas Cartwright whose posthumous reputation was boosted both by his premature death and by his avant-garde Ramism; for the profound impact of the logical and rhetorical method of Ramus 
    (Pierre de la Rame; <i>d</i>. 1572)
  , which was advanced as a substitute for Aristotelianism, is evident in everything that he published. He is said to have preached in Cranbrook, Kent, in the mid-1570s, but there is no trace of his presence in that well-documented parish before 1583. The intervening years were spent in Antwerp, where Fenner shared a ministry to the Merchant Adventurers with first Walter Travers and then Cartwright. There is no evidence that he was episcopally ordained, and, like Travers, he may have received a form of presbyterian ordination.<br>
<br>Cranbrook was a populous, industrial parish where the vicar, Richard Fletcher, found it convenient to placate a vociferous and powerful puritan element by employing a succession of radical curates: the preacher&#150;printer John Strowd, Thomas Ely (or Hely), and, finally, Fenner. Strowd and his supporters had clashed violently with Fletcher and his son, the future Bishop Richard Fletcher of London. But when in 1584 a critic of the Kentish puritan ministers (probably Reginald Scot) accused Fenner of making &#145;broile and contention&#146; in Cranbrook  (Peel, 1.238&#150;41), the charge was denied. The nature of the <i>modus vivendi</i> with Fletcher was that Fenner had total charge of the Saturday lecture. Within months of his arrival on this scene, Archbishop Whitgift was pressing subscription to his three articles, and Fenner became (with Josias Nicholls of Eastwell) the ringleader of seventeen non-subscribing Kentish ministers in a series of encounters with the archdeacon, with Whitgift in person, and with the privy council. The ministers had a favourable hearing from the council, thanks perhaps to the absence of some of its more senior members and the undue influence of its clerk, Robert Beale, who was highly sympathetic to their cause, and Whitgift was asked that they be treated &#145;with moderation&#146; and &#145;conscionable favour&#146;  (Fenner, <span class="italic">A Defence of the Godlie Ministers</span>, sigs. C2<i>v</i>&#150;3). This was in contrast to their reception by the archbishop who, in the presence of many gentlemen, railed on the ministers as &#145;boyes, princockes, and will you teache all others?&#146;  (ibid., sig. G<i>v</i>). &#145;By my traweth, Mr Fenner, youe are as bad as the worst &hellip; Can you tell mee, I was a preacher before some of you weare borne&#146;  (Sheffield City Library, Wentworth Woodhouse MSS, tracts 32, no. 16). The ministers were suspended, and Fenner was one of a small minority of non-subscribers, nationally, whose suspension would never be lifted. Presently, he was the author of a formal petition to the lower house of convocation, ostensibly &#145;tending to reconciliation&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Parte of a Register</span>, 323). This was taken to the upper house but not heard of again.<br>
<br>At about this time, Fenner was singled out for a searching examination before Whitgift, conducted on the <i>ex officio</i> oath, which, unlike some other puritans, he did not refuse. Many of the seventeen articles on which he was charged concerned his presbyterianism: that he should have taught that there ought to be no archbishops in the church; that the &#145;whole government&#146; of the church consisted of pastors, doctors, elders, deacons, and widows; that &#145;the people&#146; ought to choose their own ministers; that there should be an equality of ministers. But in the final and most interesting article, Fenner was charged with having baptized children with such unusual names as Joy Again, From Above, More Fruit, and Dust. In response, Fenner gave a detailed account of the circumstances in which some of these names had been used. More Fruit was the name he had chosen for his own daughter, &#145;that I mighte have her to carye a fruitfull remembrance of thestymacyon I made that after a deare sonne taken to the Lorde he gave me more fruicte by my wife which I scarsely looked for&#146;  (Northamptonshire Record Office, MS F. (M).P.62). More Fruit made her will on 8 April 1602 (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/99, sig. 25), another daughter, Faint Not, on 16 February 1604 (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/104, sig. 85). According to Fenner, the vicar, Richard Fletcher, raised no objection to these names, which may reveal more about the politics of Cranbrook than about Fletcher's views on the matter. More than once in his published writings Fenner defended this practice, which William Camden was to mention critically in his <span class="italic">Remains Concerning Britain</span>, and Ben Jonson to parody in his plays. It was the first duty of a father to present his child for baptism &#145;and there to give a name in the mother tongue which may have a godly signification for that work&#146;  (Fenner, <span class="italic">Certain Godly and Learned Treatises</span>, 49). A more common practice of the godly was to use such biblical names as Samuel, or Barnabas, or Timothy, which Fenner pointed out were meaningful in the original Hebrew or Greek, but not in English. Fenner's eclectic and even deviant practice seems to have been confined to the Kent and Sussex weald, and to Northamptonshire, where it may have been introduced by John Penry, another Peterhouse man. But whether he was its inventor is not certain. Thomas Ely, who preceded Fenner in the Cranbrook pulpit, moved on to Warbelton in Sussex, where about half the children born in the next few years received such names, many more than were so baptized in Cranbrook.<br>
<br>A tradition that Fenner was imprisoned and eventually forced to subscribe runs counter to his own statement, dated 12 June 1585, that after his suspension he received no censure &#145;or other paine in that respect&#146;  (Peel, 1.296). It must have been soon after recording this formal &#145;testimony&#146; that Fenner withdrew into voluntary exile in the Netherlands, becoming preacher to the English merchants at Middelburg. He could count on the protection of the earl of Leicester, who arrived in the Netherlands at the same time, and to whom he had dedicated in 1583 an anti-Catholic polemic, <span class="italic">An Answere unto the Confutation of John Nichols his Recantation</span>, which acknowledged &#145;many incoragements in those things which are good&#146;  (Fenner, <span class="italic">An Answere</span>, epistle). To the Merchant Adventurers he wrote of &#145;howe much I am bound unto your worshippes, who have not onely orderly called me to the woorke of the ministerie amongest you, but more liberallie entertayned mee &hellip; then any of the lights whiche have heretofore shined unto you&#146;  (Fenner, <span class="italic">The Song of Songs</span>, 1594, Epistle). That was in the preface to Fenner's metrical version of the <span class="roman">Song of Songs</span>, in which he states that it was the custom of the merchants &#145;ordinarilie, eare you depart from the table, both at noone and at night, [to] admonishe your selves by singing some spiritual songs&#146;  (ibid.), which were then expounded by the minister.<br>
<br>In Middelburg, Fenner lived in close proximity to Richard Schilders, who at this time was beginning to take over from Robert Waldegrave as, so to say, printer-in-ordinary to the organized puritan movement, and Schilders was busy printing Fenner's own prolific output: <span class="italic">The Artes of Logicke and Retorike</span> (five editions between 1584 and 1588), an exposition of the ten commandments, a catechism, a treatise on the sacraments, a little book on &#145;lawfull and unlawfull recreations&#146; (the unlawful included mixed dancing, dicing, &#145;wanton pictures, vain gestures&#146;; Fenner, <span class="italic">A Short and Profitable Treatise</span>, 1590), and a Parthian shot, detailing the bitter experiences of 1584: <span class="italic">A Defence of the Godlie Ministers, Against the Slaunders of D. Bridges</span> (1586). Fenner's treatise on logic and rhetoric was a popularization of the system devised by Ramus, &#145;plainlie set foorth in the English tounge, easie to be learned and practised&#146;, together with godly &#145;examples&#146;: an order for the godly household, an interpretation of the Lord's prayer, an exegesis of the epistle to <span class="roman">Philemon</span>. The argument was advanced on all occasions by means of binary opposites, the Ramist procedure: &#145;the prayer it selfe hath two partes&#146;  (Fenner, &#145;The resolution and interpretation of the Lordes prayer&#146;, <span class="italic">The artes of Logicke and Retorike</span>); &#145;the entrance to this Epistle hath two partes&#146;  (Fenner, &#145;The epistle to Philemon&#146;, ibid.). Fenner's treatise was reprinted in the seventeenth century without the &#145;examples&#146;. It was not difficult to be a Ramist when it came to expounding &#145;the whole doctrine of the sacramentes&#146;: &#145;The sacraments are two: Baptism, The Lords Supper&#146;.<br>
<br>Fenner's major literary achievement was a substantial work of Calvinist theology, <span class="italic">Sacra theologia, sive, Veritas quae est secundum pietatem</span> (1585), more Ramism. All theology was divisible into two parts: &#145;de Deo&#146;, and &#145;de actionibus Dei&#146;. Further editions were published at Geneva in 1586 and 1604, with a dedication to the earls of Warwick and Leicester. There is internal evidence that Thomas Cartwright exercised some oversight in this venture, and an epistle from Cartwright refers to the shared ministry in Antwerp. Another preface acknowledges the contribution of Josias Nicholls, the only other Kentish incumbent to baptize his own children with such names as Above-hope and Suretonhie. Manuscript copies exist of <span class="italic">Sacra theologia</span> in English translation, but <span class="italic">The Sacred Doctrine of Divinitie</span>, printed by Schilders in 1599 and with a preface dated 1 January 1589 making reference to Fenner as having died three years earlier, was not by Fenner but was the work of Sir Henry Finch. Since Finch was Nicholls's parishioner at Eastwell, the relationship of these two works may deserve further investigation. Fenner's <span class="italic">Sacra theologia</span> was a book which lasted. A copy of the 1585 edition in Peterborough Cathedral Library (deposited in the Cambridge University Library) was once the property of White Kennet, bishop of Peterborough from 1718 to 1728, while the Cambridge University Library copy of the 1586 edition belonged to John Hacket, post-Restoration bishop of Coventry and Lichfield.<br>
<br>Fenner died in Middelburg in 1587. His widow, Joan, married the celebrated Cambridge Calvinist William Whitaker, and, after Whitaker's death, Josias Nicholls. In a posthumous edition of Fenner's works of practical divinity, published in Edinburgh in 1592, Robert Waldegrave, now king's printer in Scotland, wrote of &#145;one whome the Church of God in this age could have hardliest spared: he ended his testimonie in this life being under thirtie yeres of age&#146;  (Fenner, <span class="italic">Certain Godly and Learned Treatises</span>, Waldegrave's Epistle). The presbyterian and anti-prelatical polemics attributed to Fenner (including <span class="italic">A Counter-Poyson, Modestlie Written for the Time</span>) were reprinted in 1593 in <span class="italic">A Parte of a Register</span>.<br>
