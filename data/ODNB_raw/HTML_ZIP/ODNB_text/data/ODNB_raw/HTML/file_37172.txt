<span class="headword">Beeton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Mayson]</span>,  Isabella Mary</span>  (1836&#150;1865), <span class="occ">writer on household management and journalist</span>, was born on 14 March 1836 at Milk Street, off Cheapside in the City of London, the eldest in the family of three daughters and a son of Benjamin Mayson (1801&#150;1840), linen factor of Milk Street, London, and his wife, Elizabeth Jerrom (1815&#150;1871). Isabella's father died when she was four, and in 1843 her mother married Henry Dorling (1806&#150;1873) of Epsom, who had two sons and two daughters from a previous marriage. To these eight, a further thirteen children were added over the next twenty years. They were housed for most of the year with their maternal grandmother, Mary Jerrom (1794&#150;1874), in the Epsom grandstand, which was let to Henry Dorling in his capacity as clerk of the course. As the eldest girl among the twenty-one children, Isabella was her grandmother's chief assistant, and in this unusual establishment her informal education began. Her formal education, after a brief period in Islington, was in a school in Heidelberg which she probably entered in summer 1851. Here, as well as developing her musical talents, she acquired a facility in languages which was to be useful in her later career. She also took to pastry making, which she continued to practise at a local confectioners when she returned to Epsom in 1854, though her family thought this to be &#145;ultra modern and not quite nice&#146;.<br>
<br>On 10 July 1856, at St Martin's, Epsom, Isabella married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45481/', "Samuel Orchart Beeton (1831&#150;1877)")</script>, the son of Samuel Powell Beeton, an innkeeper at Milk Street, London. They had four sons, the first of whom died in infancy (1857) and the second aged three (1864). Samuel Beeton had already begun to make a name for himself as a publisher and editor. His early involvement in the English edition of Harriet Beecher Stowe's <span class="italic">Uncle Tom's Cabin</span> had helped to finance a series of innovatory publications. The most important of these for Mrs Beeton was the <span class="italic">English Woman's Domestic Magazine</span>, a twopenny monthly launched in 1852, which pioneered the middle-class woman's magazine.<br>
<br>For the eight and a half years of their marriage the Beetons developed a partnership in which the personal and professional were intertwined. Mrs Beeton entered almost immediately into her husband's publishing business, and within a year was writing on domestic matters for the <span class="italic">English Woman's Domestic Magazine</span> and had begun the &#145;four years' incessant labour&#146; which she claimed <span class="italic">Beeton's Book of Household Management</span> cost her. Her role in the production of the various Beeton journals is not self-evident in their pages, since a public persona was not part of her style. However, she was &#145;editress&#146; of the <span class="italic">Domestic Magazine</span> and was involved in the upmarket weekly <span class="italic">The Queen</span> which was launched in 1861. A visit to Paris in 1860 established a French connection for the firm, and a new series of the <span class="italic">English Woman's Domestic Magazine</span> included monthly accounts of the latest Paris styles, a high-quality colour fashion-plate, and the offer of a pattern service for readers, a combination which was to become a staple of twentieth-century women's magazines. Whether she was visiting Paris, writing articles, dealing with layout, even demonstrating how to cut out a pattern for a perplexed reader, Mrs Beeton's energy and organizational skills were crucial to the management of the publishing house. It is not for this, however, that she is remembered, but for her writing on domestic matters and especially for <span class="italic">Beeton's Book of Household Management</span> (1859&#150;61), which in its various editions made &#145;Mrs Beeton&#146; a household name in a double sense.<br>
<br>Part of the extraordinary success of this book may be attributed to skilful marketing&#151;as a part-work between 1859 and 1861, the illustrated edition in 1861, and the cheap reissues begun by Samuel Beeton and continued by Ward, Lock, and Tyler, to whom he sold his titles after Isabella's death. Its success, however, also rested on its quality, especially the combination of clear structure and precise detail. Recipes, for example, were arranged alphabetically in sections, with ingredients, prices, weights, and cooking times all precisely stated. The book's style moved easily between detailed instructions and neat aphorisms.<br>
<br>For Mrs Beeton, a people's &#145;way of taking their meals, as well as their way of treating women&#146; were marks of civilization. Dining well &#145;implies both the will and the skill to reduce to order, and surround with idealisms and grace, the more material conditions of human existence&#146;. That will and skill she showed in large measure. The popular image of Mrs Beeton as a middle-aged housewife given to the confection of extravagant recipes is doubly mistaken. First, her book is notable for its attempt to combine good living with economy. Second, she never lived to middle age; she died aged twenty-eight at her home, Mount Pleasant, Swanscombe, Kent, of peritonitis and puerperal fever on 6 February 1865, eight days after the birth of her son Mayson, who later had a distinguished career in journalism and government. She was buried on 11 February at Norwood cemetery.<br>
