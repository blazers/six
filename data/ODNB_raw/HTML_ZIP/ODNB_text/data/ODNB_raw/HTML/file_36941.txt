<span class="headword">Wilmot,  John Charles</span>, Baron Wilmot of Selmeston  (1893&#150;1964), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at 36 Garibaldi Street, Woolwich, London, on 2 April 1893, the eldest of the four sons of Charles Samuel Wilmot, a journeyman engraver in metal, originally from East Anglia, and his wife, Marian Newton. After attending Hither Green central school, which he left at the age of fifteen to work as an office boy, he pursued his education at evening classes at the Chelsea Polytechnic and at King's College, London. There he won the Gilbart prize in banking, which enabled him to join the Westminster Bank Piccadilly branch. He rose rapidly, first to the general manager's office and then to the secretaryship of the Anglo-Russian Bank. In the First World War he served as an aircraftsman in the Royal Naval Air Service, and following demobilization he returned to the bank.<br>
<br>Wilmot took an early interest in politics, and joined both the Independent Labour Party and the Fabian Society at the age of sixteen. Back from the war, he helped to found East Lewisham Labour Party in 1919. By 1933 this had become one of the ten biggest constituency parties in the country, and for this Wilmot, who stood as candidate in the three elections of 1924, 1929, and 1931, deserves much of the credit. It was through his constituency work that he came to know his wife, Elsie May (Elsa) Slate (<i>b</i>. 1895/6), who was chairman of the women's section and shared her husband's political concerns. She was the daughter of George Alfred Slate, a civil servant, of Hastings. They married on 18 August 1928. There were no children.<br>
<br>Wilmot came close to taking East Lewisham in the general election of 1929. But in the unfavourable conditions of the 1930s this was not a seat which could be won, and he was glad to become a candidate in an unexpected by-election at East Fulham in October 1933. Fighting a particularly vigorous campaign and benefiting from a mid-term swing against the government, he won with a majority of 4840, overturning the tory majority (14,521) of the 1931 election. This result gained a significance beyond the improvement in morale and debating strength which it gave to the tiny parliamentary opposition. In his maiden speech, on 13 November 1933, Wilmot described his victory as a symptom of &#145;a general feeling, a passionate and insistent desire for peace&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 281, col. 613). Rightly or wrongly, this interpretation was widely believed and three years later gave rise to Stanley Baldwin's &#145;appalling frankness&#146; speech, in which he said that the loss of the Fulham seat &#145;on no issue but the pacifist&#146; had helped to convince him of the political impossibility of rearmament  (K. Middlemas and J. Barnes, <span class="italic">Baldwin</span>, 1969, 970). In fact Wilmot was not a pacifist&#151;rather, he was a member of the group which Hugh Dalton called the &#145;bloody-minded pacifists&#146; who thought that peace could best be preserved through a strong and effective League of Nations. Wilmot lost his seat in the 1935 election, but he remained a national political figure and served for a time on the party executive, first as a runner-up and replacement, and then in 1940 as an elected member in the constituency parties section. In 1939 he returned to parliament at a by-election in Kennington. In 1945 he moved again, this time to Deptford.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Wilmot had seen much of government from the inside, largely through the patronage of Dalton, who chose him in May 1940 as his parliamentary private secretary at the Ministry of Economic Warfare. Because of his close personal friendship with the minister, Wilmot had great influence both at the ministry and in Dalton's secret empire, the Special Operations Executive, which dealt with propaganda and subversion. His special role was as a personal link with the propaganda staff stationed at Woburn Abbey.<br>
<br>Dalton valued his parliamentary private secretary highly. Wilmot gave the impression (as another friend put it) of &#145;a shrewd and eminently jolly abbot&#146;. His minister liked both qualities&#151;the irrepressible good humour and also the canny understanding of the movement, especially the trade union part of it. When Dalton moved to the Board of Trade in 1942 he took Wilmot with him (still as parliamentary private secretary), and two years later secured the latter's promotion to joint parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Supply. This crucial step up the ladder led to a further promotion, after Labour's election victory in 1945, to minister of supply and aircraft production. Wilmot was thus put in charge of an immensely important department with a big staff and a huge labour force, with indirect control over raw material industries. It was an &#145;executive-administrative&#146; ministry, calling for frequent major decisions from its chief.<br>
<br>Wilmot cut an imposing figure: &#145;a modern Cockney, a successful child of the pavements&#146;, as a 1946 newspaper article put it&#151;tall, well-built, well-dressed, well-brushed, with polish and without accent, big, bustling, a sophisticated man of the world. But while he radiated bonhomie he lacked self-confidence, and he was badly mauled in the major controversy of his tenure of office. In November 1945 Wilmot circulated a memorandum recommending nationalization of iron and steel. This was opposed not only within the industry itself but also by Wilmot's own officials and, crucially, by Herbert Morrison. A compromise scheme presented in July 1947 by the two ministers, involving public supervision and partial nationalization, was rejected by the prime minister, and the matter was shelved by the cabinet. In the course of complex discussions Wilmot lost almost all his allies. &#145;He was unlucky&#146;, wrote Morrison's biographers: &#145;being outside the Cabinet, he lacked the power to control the destiny of his ministry&#146;  (B. Donoughue and G. W. Jones, <span class="italic">Herbert Morrison: Portrait of a Politician</span>, 1973, 403). Finally, Stafford Cripps demanded his sacking, and Attlee was told that he was unpopular even among Labour MPs, where his policies found most support. In October 1947 he was dismissed. Having first refused, he accepted a peerage in January 1950.<br>
<br>After leaving politics Wilmot pursued his business interests, building upon his reputation as a Labour politician with a sympathy for the financial world. He had been seized on early as &#145;a useful recruit to any company board whose owners or managing-directors saw Labour coming into power&#146;  (N. Davenport, <span class="italic">Memoirs of a City Radical</span>, 1974, 101). By 1949 he was on the board of sixteen companies and served as chairman of six. He also took a keen interest in theatre and opera and was chairman of the governors of the Old Vic and of the trustees of Glyndebourne. Good at public relations and revelling in the limelight, Wilmot was more a communicator and popularizer than a planner or decision taker. He came from the grass roots, and he had an instinctive appreciation of the feelings of the rank and file. In this sense he was a party rather than a government man, and his greatest impact was at elections, in the constituencies, and at the Labour Party conference, rather than in the government in which he held such a crucial but difficult brief. Wilmot died in St George's Hospital, Westminster, on 22 July 1964, and the barony became extinct. He was survived by his wife.<br>
