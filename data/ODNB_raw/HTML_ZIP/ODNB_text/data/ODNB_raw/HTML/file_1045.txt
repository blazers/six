<span class="headword">Bagshaw,  Henry</span>  (1631<span class="mult">x</span>4&#150;1709), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Broughton, Northamptonshire, a younger son of the lawyer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1043/', "Edward Bagshaw (1589/90&#150;1662)")</script>, an opponent of Laudianism who in the divisions which arose in the early 1640s became a defender of episcopacy and royalist. The noted Independent minister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1044/', "Edward Bagshaw")</script> was an elder brother of Henry. The year of Henry's birth remains uncertain, as there is a contradiction between his reported ages at matriculation of seventeen in 1651 and at death of seventy-seven in 1709.<br>
<br>After attending Westminster School, Henry Bagshaw was elected a student of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1651, graduating BA in 1655 and proceeding MA in 1657. In 1663 he was appointed chaplain to Sir Richard Fanshawe, ambassador to Portugal and then Spain. Bagshaw preached the ambassador's funeral sermon in Madrid and returned to England in the retinue of his widow, Anne, Lady Fanshawe, and became chaplain to Richard Sterne, archbishop of York. He was collated in turn to the prebends of Barnby in York Minster in August 1667 and Fridaythorpe in May 1668, and resigned the latter in July 1670. Thanks to Sterne's influence he was also made a prebendary of Southwell Minster in 1668 and rector of Carlton in Lyndrick, Nottinghamshire. He was created BD in 1668 and DD in 1671.<br>
<br>In 1672 Bagshaw was made chaplain to Lord Treasurer Danby and rector of St Botolph without Bishopsgate, London. In April 1674 he married Mary Nicholls (<i>b</i>. 1647/8), the daughter of Sir Edward Nicholls, baronet, of Foxton, Northamptonshire. Two of his children were baptized at St Botolph without Bishopsgate, in 1676 and 1677. In the latter year he exchanged his London parish for Houghton-le-Spring, co. Durham, and in 1680 he was appointed a prebendary of Durham. Further children were baptized in Durham Cathedral (in 1684, 1688 and 1690), Houghton-le-Spring (1685), and (perhaps) St Andrew's, Holborn (in 1682). However, of the children known to have been born, nothing is known of the fate of the two or three daughters; only one of the four sons, Edward Bagshaw, seems to have survived.<br>
<br>Bagshaw was renowned for his pulpit oratory and published a number of sermons. In 1673 he preached before the lord mayor <span class="italic">The Excellency of Primitive Government</span>, which&#151;suitably enough for a sermon upon the mayor's election&#151;expounded the duty of the magistrate to create a faithful and righteous city. In 1676 he published <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached before the King at Whitehall</span> on <span class="roman">Psalm 37</span>, and in 1680 his <span class="italic">Diatribae, or, Discourses upon Select Texts</span>, in which he discussed what were in his view the &#145;two great enemies to Christianity, &hellip; the Papist and the Socinian&#146;  (epistle dedicatory). Bagshaw died at Houghton-le-Spring on 30 December 1709, and was buried in the chancel of the church.<br>
