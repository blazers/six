<span class="headword">Chase,  Drummond Percy</span>  (1820&#150;1902), <span class="occ">college head</span>, born on 14 September 1820 at Ch&acirc;teau de Saubruit, near St Omer, was the second son of John Woodford Chase, an army paymaster, of Cosgrave, Northamptonshire. Matriculating at Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1838, he became an open scholar of Oriel College in 1839, and obtained first-class honours in classics in 1841. He graduated BA in 1841, proceeding MA 1844 and DD in 1880, and was ordained deacon in 1844 and priest in 1849. He was president of the Oxford Union in 1842. Elected fellow of Oriel College on 1 April 1842, just when the question of John Henry Newman's relation to the Anglican church was at its acutest phase, he retained his fellowship until his death, sixty years afterwards.<br>
<br>Chase was tutor of Oriel from 1847 to 1849 and again from 1860 to 1866. He was senior proctor of the university in 1853, and printed his Latin speech on leaving office on 26 April 1854. He was a select preacher before the university in 1860, and was vicar of St Mary's, Oxford, from 1855 to 1863 and again from 1876 to 1878. When he began his duties as college tutor, he took the unusual step of printing the substance of his principal course of lectures for the use of his pupils and other Oxford passmen. This was an edition, with translation and notes, of Aristotle's <span class="italic">Nicomachean Ethics</span> (1847; 4th edn, 1877).<br>
<br>In 1848 Chase became vice-principal of St Mary Hall, Oxford, and on his appointment as principal in 1857 set himself vigorously to reform the place. He would admit no idle or extravagant candidate who was seeking to migrate from a college. But he welcomed diligent and frugal men, whose poverty excluded them from expensive colleges. On 28 June 1859 he married Caroline Matilda Northcote (<i>d</i>. 1904), but was allowed to retain his Oriel fellowship, to which a celibacy restriction was attached, by virtue of his headship of St Mary Hall. As a result of the 1881 statutes of the university commissioners, on Chase's death the hall merged with Oriel College, with which it was connected locally and through various individuals, after an independent existence of nearly 600 years.<br>
<br>Between 1854 and 1881, Chase published frequent pamphlets on academic questions, and many occasional sermons preached before the university. He resisted in 1854, in the interests of poor professional men in country places, the abolition by the university commission of all local and other special qualifications for scholarships and fellowships. In 1870 he gave evidence to a select committee of the House of Lords in defence of religious tests. A don of the old school, courteous, gentle, and kindly, brimming over with quiet fun and quaint Oxford anecdotes, he died at St Mary Hall on 27 June 1902. He was buried in Holywell cemetery, Oxford. He had no children.<br>
