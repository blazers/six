<span class="headword">Cuthbertson,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1743, <em>d.</em> 1821), <span class="occ">instrument maker</span>, was baptized at Dearham, Cumberland, on 1 July 1743. He was the second of four children (the eldest of whom predeceased him) and elder son of Jonathan Cuthbertson, an innkeeper and yeoman, and his second wife, Mary Fisher. He has been confused with his younger brother, Jonathan, also born in Dearham, and baptized on 11 September 1744, who followed the same profession; their publications have been listed in several prominent works under John's name alone. Jonathan died in 1806.<br>
<br>Nothing is known about the brothers' formal education or early apprenticeships. In 1761 John Cuthbertson was apprenticed to the instrument maker James Champneys and moved with him to Amsterdam in 1768. Champneys was one of a number of prominent London instrument makers who brought a petition against Peter Dollond in 1764 to annul (unsuccessfully, as it turned out) the achromatic lens patent which had been granted to Dollond's father in 1758. In 1766 Champneys had to pay a heavy fine for infringing Dollond's patent, and he was made bankrupt in that year. This may have been one of the reasons for his move to the Netherlands with his apprentice. Cuthbertson followed the fairly common practice of marrying his master's daughter; he and Jane Champneys were married on 1 September 1768, and it must have been shortly afterwards that the move to the Netherlands took place, as Cuthbertson appears in the Amsterdam <i>poorterboek</i> on 29 December 1768. Only John took the poorter's oath necessary for those who wanted to establish a business; from this we may surmise that James Champneys lived with the newly married couple, and that the business was solely in Cuthbertson's name. Cuthbertson and his wife had four children in Amsterdam, but only their sole daughter, Jane, survived.<br>
<br>Cuthbertson became noted for his glass-plate frictional electrical machines, a technology which he took with him from London but which he developed to a high state of perfection in the Netherlands. Some of the improvements may have originated from his brother, Jonathan, who had set up a flourishing instrument-making business in Rotterdam. Cuthbertson also advanced the subject of electricity, writing books, giving public lectures, and assisting some of the foremost Dutch scientists with their experiments. In 1783 he constructed a very large twin-plate electrical machine for one of these scientists, Martinus van Marum, the director of the experimental cabinet of the Teyler's Foundation in Haarlem. This frictional generator, the largest of its type, produced 24 inch discharges, equivalent to about 300,000 volts.<br>
<br>Cuthbertson returned to London some time between 1793 and 1796, perhaps because of the worsening political situation in the Dutch republic. His brother decided to remain behind and died in Rotterdam. John settled at Poland Street in London. It cannot have been easy for a man in his fifties to start afresh as an instrument maker there. In 1799 he invented an electrometer named after him and produced a simplified version of his plate electrical machine, which became the most popular type in England. He also designed several air-pumps. In 1810 he wrote his last scientific papers. He was buried on 18 July 1821 in his parish church, St James's, Piccadilly. He probably died intestate.<br>
