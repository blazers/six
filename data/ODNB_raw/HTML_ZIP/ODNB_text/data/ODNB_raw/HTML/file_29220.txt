<span class="headword">Whitaker, Sir  Frederick</span>  (1812&#150;1891), <span class="occ">entrepreneur and premier of New Zealand</span>, the eldest son of Frederick Whitaker, deputy lieutenant of Oxfordshire, and his wife, Susanna Humfrey, was born on 23 April 1812 at Manor House, Bampton, Oxfordshire. In 1839, soon after he had qualified as a solicitor, he emigrated to Australia and settled in Sydney. He went on to New Zealand in March 1840 and began to practise at Kororareka, then the seat of government, and moved with the government to Auckland, the new capital, the following year. In 1842 he was appointed a county court judge; in 1844, however, these courts were abolished, and he once more returned to the practice of his profession, and also began investing in mines. On 4 March 1843 he married Jane Augusta Griffith (<i>d</i>. 1884), the stepdaughter of Alexander Shepherd, colonial treasurer of New Zealand; they had four sons and three daughters who survived childhood.<br>
<br>In 1845 Whitaker was appointed an unofficial member of the legislative council. A superb legal draftsman, he there began an enduring association with the attorney-general, William Swainson, and the chief justice, William Martin; over the years they framed a new code of statutes. Under the new constitution of 1852 Whitaker was elected a member of the Auckland provincial council; he later became provincial law officer and a member of the superintendent's executive. In 1853 he was nominated a member of the legislative council of the colony, and in 1854 took his seat as such in the first general assembly. In 1855 he was appointed attorney-general in succession to Swainson, and later in the year he became speaker of the legislative council. In June 1856, shortly after the grant of responsible government, Whitaker became attorney-general under Edward William Stafford, and acted as leader of the government in the legislative council. This stable ministry lasted until it was defeated over native affairs on 12 July 1861; this had become an explosively divisive issue with the opening of the New Zealand wars in 1860.<br>
<br>Shortly afterwards, Whitaker entered into a legal partnership with Thomas Russell, a dashing speculator and already a founder of financial institutions. Together they set up one of the most lucrative practices in the colony. Whitaker became attorney-general to the Domett ministry on 1 June 1863. When Domett resigned in October, Whitaker himself became premier, and his partner Russell was appointed minister of defence. Together they represented the &#145;war party&#146; of Auckland, standing for a military reckoning with &#145;rebel&#146; Maori and for a sweeping confiscation of their lands. Outraged at the extent of the confiscations envisaged by Whitaker, the governor, Sir George Grey, contrived to topple this ministry in November 1864. In 1865 Whitaker was elected superintendent of Auckland, and in the same year was member for Parnell in the house of representatives. He led the opposition to the change of the seat of government from Auckland to Wellington. His scheme for the administration of the land fund was one of the chief items of his policy.<br>
<br>In March 1867 Whitaker retired from the assembly and the post of superintendent, and devoted himself once more to his profession and his business interests, which had suffered because of his preoccupation with politics. Between 1867 and 1871 he invested heavily, and generally successfully, in provincial gold mining companies. In the 1870s, invariably in association with his partner Russell, he extended his investment in timber, banking, coal, and companies. But above all else Whitaker and Russell were land speculators. Some of their land claims, such as the Piako swamp, came before the legislature and were the subject of acrimonious debate.<br>
<br>In 1876 Whitaker once more returned to politics, and was elected for Waikato to the house of representatives; in September 1876 he entered Atkinson's government as attorney-general, a post he held on seven occasions during his political career. On 15 October 1877 the government was defeated, and in the general election which followed Whitaker lost his seat. But the incoming ministry was relatively short-lived, and when Sir John Hall formed his administration in October 1879 Whitaker became once again attorney-general with a seat in the legislative council. On 21 April 1882, on Hall's resignation, he became premier, albeit reluctantly, and reconstructed the ministry, but on 25 September 1883 he resigned to attend to private affairs, now threatened by a deepening colonial depression. He was created KCMG in January 1884. Again, in October 1887, Whitaker resumed his old position of attorney-general, under Sir Henry Atkinson, and sat in the council until his health began to fail in 1890; in December of that year the ministry resigned, and Whitaker retired from public life. He was broken in health and distraught over heavy business losses: he who had once been wealthy was on the brink of poverty. He died at his office desk, in Symonds Street, Auckland, on 4 December 1891, and was buried on 6 December in St Stephen's cemetery, Parnell, Auckland, with masonic honours and much sign of public mourning.<br>
<br>Whitaker was described by a fellow politician as &#145;probably the most remarkable public man in New Zealand&#146;  (Gisborne, 71). Yet he avoided the limelight, preferring to exercise his influence behind the scenes. There, by the 1880s, his mastery was absolute. Within the legislative council he was said to be &#145;a Triton among minnows&#146;. As a counsel on political matters he was without peer; his skill in drafting bills in clear, unambiguous language was a byword. Twentieth-century research and better understanding of the Maori people, however, have much diminished the reputation of one so anxious to amalgamate indigenous people with Western society regardless of consequences. Nevertheless, he could be liberal in other causes concerned with colonial democracy, and in such was much ahead of his time.<br>
