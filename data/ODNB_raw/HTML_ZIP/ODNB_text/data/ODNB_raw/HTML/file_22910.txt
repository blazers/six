<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pusey,  Edward Bouverie</span>  (1800&#150;1882), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and theologian</span>, was the second child of Philip Pusey (1746&#150;1828), landowner, the youngest son of Jacob Bouverie, first Viscount Folkestone, who took the name Pusey when he inherited extensive property at Pusey, a small village in Berkshire, and Lady Lucy Sherard (1770&#150;1858), the daughter of the earl of Harborough and widow of Sir Thomas Cave. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22911/', "Philip Pusey")</script> was his elder brother; their sister Charlotte married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6423/', "Richard Lynch Cotton")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandeducation"></a>Early life and education</h2>Pusey was born at Pusey House, Pusey, on 22 August 1800 and attended a preparatory school at Mitcham in Surrey run by a clergyman, Richard Roberts, who grounded him well in the classics. In 1812 he went to Eton College under &#145;Flogger&#146; Keate. A shy, rather weakly boy, not much interested in sport though a good chess player, he made few close friends there. Then, after fifteen months with a private tutor, Edward Maltby, later bishop of Durham, in January 1819 he went up to Christ Church, Oxford, where he was tutored by Thomas Vowler Short (later bishop of St Asaph). He graduated with a first class in 1822, and in 1823 successfully competed for an Oriel fellowship, then one of the most coveted distinctions in the university.<h2>
<a name="Furtherstudiesandfirstpublication"></a>Further studies and first publication</h2>Aspiring to ordination, Pusey attended the lectures of Dr Charles Lloyd, regius professor of divinity and later bishop of Oxford, whom he described as &#145;a second father&#146; to him. Lloyd, conscious of the disturbing developments in German biblical scholarship and theology, urged Pusey to learn the language and to study in Germany. Pusey responded willingly, as he was already aware of the threat of rationalism to the Christian faith through his attempts to counter the scepticism of Julian Hibbert, a friend from Eton. He spent the long vacation of 1825 and a whole year, 1826&#150;7, in Germany at the universities of Berlin, Bonn, and G&ouml;ttingen studying theology, most notably under Schleiermacher. Realizing that the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> was the most vulnerable area to attack, he also learned Hebrew, Arabic, and other cognate languages, with Freytag and Kosegarten.<br>
<br>Already he showed the immense capacity for work which was characteristic of him throughout his life, studying from fourteen to sixteen hours a day. Soon after his return to England, in May 1828, he published his first book, <span class="italic">An historical enquiry into the probable causes of the rationalist character lately predominant in the theology of Germany</span>. He was encouraged to do this by his German friends who were very critical of the recently published lectures by Hugh James Rose on the same subject. Pusey consequently wrote more sympathetically. This, coupled with his rather obscure style, led to his being widely misunderstood. Whereas Rose had attributed the condition of German theology to the lack of credal formularies and episcopal government which protected the English church, Pusey attributed it to what he confusingly called &#145;dead orthodoxism&#146;, the aridity of Lutheran scholasticism, a phenomenon which he also detected in the Church of England. He consulted Newman and produced a &#145;Second part&#146; in 1830, defending himself against suspicions of rationalism. Dissatisfied with the work himself, he withdrew it from sale a few years later. This did not prevent charges of early liberalism being made from time to time in his later life, and in his will he directed that the book should never be reprinted. It did not, however, damage his prospects.<h2>
<a name="Hebrewprofessorship"></a>Hebrew professorship</h2>On 1 June 1828 Pusey was made deacon, and the following November he was appointed by the prime minister, the duke of Wellington, regius professor of Hebrew at Oxford; to the chair was attached a Christ Church canonry, so Pusey had to be ordained to the priesthood. On 12 June 1828 he had married Maria Catharine Barker (1801&#150;1839), the daughter of Raymond Barker of Fairford Park, with whom he had fallen in love at their first meeting ten years earlier. Neither father had approved of the match; Pusey's consequent unhappiness and frustration partly accounted for his burying himself in work. They had one son, Philip Edward (1830&#150;1880), and three daughters: only his youngest daughter, Mary Amelia (Mrs Brine), survived him. His wife died of consumption, aged thirty-eight, on 26 May 1839. On 23 November 1828 he was ordained priest by Bishop Lloyd at Cuddesdon and on 9 December was installed canon of Christ Church.<br>
<br>As Pusey understood it, his work was as much theological as linguistic. All cathedrals, indeed, had a responsibility for the education of those intending to be ordained, as he argued in his pamphlet <span class="italic">Remarks on the Prospective and Past Benefits of Cathedral Institutions</span> (1833). The German system of clerical education provided a model which cathedrals could adopt. Meantime the two ancient universities were the only institutions for such education in England and Pusey intended to use his position to improve it. The university statutes envisaged only one lecture twice a week, but, with the help of a deputy, he provided three courses of lectures, three times a week. He treated the study of Hebrew as a religious subject and aimed to impart a full idiomatic knowledge so that students might &#145;enter more fully into the simple meaning of God's Word&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, who attended his lectures in 1845, said &#145;the whole atmosphere of [them] breathed the spirit of Germany to a degree&#146;  (E. G. W. Bill, <span class="italic">University Reform</span>, 1973, 252). In 1832 Pusey, together with his elder brother, Philip, and a friend, Dr Ellerton, founded the three Pusey and Ellerton Hebrew scholarships. For some years he gave board and lodging to students in his house so that they could study theology and, when his wife was ill, rented a house nearby for them. Later he accommodated non-graduates to help prepare them for ordination. He also founded a Theological Society, mostly for young fellows, which met in his lodgings, where papers were presented and discussed. He supported the establishment of theological colleges, giving, for example, &pound;2500 towards the founding of Salisbury Theological College (1861).<br>
<br>Pusey felt obliged to complete the catalogue of the oriental manuscripts in the Bodleian Library begun by his predecessor, Alexander Nicoll. The laborious task took him nearly six years. The only work he published in direct connection with his chair was <span class="italic">Lectures on Daniel the Prophet</span> (1864). He chose the subject because &#145;disbelief in Daniel has become an axiom in the unbelieving critical school&#146;  (p. vi). It is usually dismissed as a monument of conservatism but his successor, Dr S. R. Driver, who was far from sharing Pusey's views, acknowledged it as &#145;extremely learned and thorough&#146;  (Butler, <span class="italic">Pusey Rediscovered</span>, 111). His <span class="italic">Minor prophets, with a commentary, explanatory and practical and introduction to the several books</span>, which appeared in parts between 1860 and 1877, was the only published part of a projected popular commentary on the whole <span class="roman">Bible</span> planned by Pusey.<br>
<br>Pusey's Hebrew scholarship was widely acknowledged and is also attested by his astute purchases of Hebrew manuscripts for the Bodleian, of which he was a curator. He was invited to take part in the revision of the Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in 1870 but, although he had himself made an abortive attempt at a revision of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> on his return from Germany, he declined.<h2>
<a name="AdherencetotheOxfordMovementandcontributiontotheTracts"></a>Adherence to the Oxford Movement and contribution to the Tracts</h2>Pusey occupied the chair of theology for over fifty years and faithfully fulfilled the duties of his office, but his name will always be associated with the Oxford Movement, the Catholic revival in the Church of England. His election to a fellowship at Oriel had brought him into close contact with John Keble and John Henry Newman who, together with Richard Hurrell Froude, were the real originators of the movement, but he had not immediately joined them. His other commitments, to his work on the catalogue of manuscripts, to his growing family (four children between 1829 and 1833), and a period of ill health diverted his energies. His political liberalism, too, had led him to support Peel and Catholic emancipation in 1829, which they had opposed. Initially he had wondered whether he &#145;could not best aid the plan by separate action with the same end&#146;  (Trench, 80). Eventually, however, he threw himself into the movement, to use his own words,<blockquote>as an effective means of bringing to the vivid consciousness of members of the Church of England, Catholic truths, taught of old within her, presupposed in her formularies, but unhappily overlaid or watered down in the meagre practical teaching of the 18th century</blockquote>in order to realize the ideal God had set her, &#145;to represent in life and in doctrine the teaching of the undivided Church&#146;  (<span class="italic">University Sermons, 1859&#150;72</span>, 1872, v&#150;vi). He agreed to write a tract on the value of fasting, which was published at the end of 1833 as <span class="roman">Tract 18</span>, on condition that his initials were attached to it. Since the earlier tracts were anonymous the unintended result was that his name became synonymous with Tractarianism and the movement was popularly known as Puseyism. As Newman acknowledged in his <span class="italic">Apologia</span>, &#145;he at once gave to us a position and a name&#146;. This was due as much to his character as to his status.<blockquote>He had a vast influence in consequence of his deep religious seriousness, the munificence of his charities, his Professorship, his family connexions, and his easy relations with University authorities. &hellip; He was a man of large designs, he had a hopeful sanguine mind; he had no fear of others; he was haunted by no intellectual perplexities. (<span class="italic">Apologia</span>, ed. M. Svagelic, 1967, 646)</blockquote>Pusey's adherence to the movement changed the character of the <span class="roman">Tracts</span>. They became weighty theological treatises, none more than his own. In 1835 he contributed a major study, <span class="italic">Scriptural Views of Holy Baptism</span>, which was published in three parts as <span class="roman">Tracts</span> <span class="roman">67</span>, <span class="roman">68</span>, and <span class="roman">69</span>. In it he sought to demonstrate the biblical and patristic basis of the doctrine of baptismal regeneration. In 1839 he produced an enlarged edition of the first part, <span class="roman">Tract 67</span>, expanding it from 48 pages to 400, incorporating in it material from some very original lectures he had given on types and prophecies. He also wrote a tract, <span class="roman">81</span>, on the other great sacrament, the eucharist, <span class="italic">Testimony of writers of the later English church to the doctrine of the eucharistic sacrifice, with an historical account of the changes made in the liturgy as to the expression of that doctrine</span> (1837). Pusey wrote the historical account, although the catena of quotations was largely the work of Benjamin Harrison. The doctrine was widely forgotten in the Church of England and Pusey's exposition of it was much vaguer than his later teaching.<br>
<br>
<span class="roman">Tract 81</span> shows the importance Pusey attached to the Caroline divines as witnesses to the teaching of the Church of England. One of the great projects of the Oxford Movement was the <span class="roman">Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology</span> (1841&#150;63), which republished many of their works, but, according to Newman, neither he nor Pusey was &#145;warm&#146; about it. Pusey, however, was the driving force behind the other great literary project, the <span class="roman">Library of Fathers of the Holy Catholic Church, Anterior to the Division of East and West</span> (1838&#150;85). This made available in translation the works of thirteen writers, mostly of the fourth century, notably Athanasius, Chrysostom, and Augustine. The burden of organizing the translators, revising their work, negotiating with the publishers, and raising subscriptions fell on Pusey. He provided the first volume, a revised translation of St Augustine's <span class="italic">Confessions</span>, with a preface on the need and value of patristic study. There were forty-eight volumes in all, the last ones appearing after his death.<h2>
<a name="ApologistfortheTractarians"></a>Apologist for the Tractarians</h2>Pusey's position in Oxford made him the obvious spokesman and apologist for the Tractarians. In 1836 he wrote <span class="italic">An Earnest Remonstrance</span>, published as <span class="roman">Tract 77</span>, in response to an anonymous attack on their teaching on prayers for the dead. Three years later Richard Bagot, the bishop of Oxford, puzzled by the refusal of Pusey and the other Tractarians to subscribe to a memorial to the protestant martyrs, asked him to explain their attitude to the Reformation. This he did in an open <span class="italic">Letter to the Bishop of Oxford</span> (1839). It was Pusey's most explicit exposition of his understanding of the Church of England as the <i>via media</i>, treading &#145;a broad and tangible line, not verging towards, or losing itself in Romanism&#146;, and &#145;distinct from the bye-ways of Ultra Protestantism&#146;  (4th edn, 1840, 22), a line which was moreover &#145;the &#147;old path&#148; of the Primitive Church&#146;  (ibid.). In 1841 he defended Newman when he was attacked for trying, in <span class="roman">Tract 90</span>, to demonstrate that the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> were patent of a Catholic interpretation. He persuaded the bishop not to censure the tract and published another open letter, this time to his Etonian friend and fellow canon of Christ Church Dr R. W. Jelf, in which he claimed significantly that Newman's interpretation was not &#145;only <i>an</i> admissible, but <i>the</i> most legitimate interpretation of them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letter to Jelf</span>, 1841, 148f.). In the autumn Archbishop Howley sent for Pusey to ascertain the state of things in Oxford and, at the suggestion of his chaplain, Pusey wrote an open letter to the archbishop defending the movement against the criticisms levelled at it in many bishops' charges and urging that the church &#145;be what she is in theory and in her prayer book&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letter to the Archbishop</span>, 3rd edn, 1842, 119).<h2>
<a name="Leadershipofthemovement"></a>Leadership of the movement</h2>Pusey was becoming increasingly prominent in the leadership of the movement. Newman was on his Anglican &#145;deathbed&#146; and retired to live at Littlemore in 1842, while Keble was resident in his country parish and no longer professor of poetry. In 1843 Pusey was attacked for his teaching in a university sermon, <span class="italic">The Holy Eucharist: a Comfort to the Penitent</span>. Six doctors of divinity were appointed to examine it and, without his being allowed to speak in his own defence, he was condemned for preaching unspecified doctrines &#145;dissona et contraria&#146; to those of the Church of England and suspended from preaching before the university for two years. Many sprang to Pusey's defence, including W. E. Gladstone and Lord Coleridge. Pusey took the advice of Newman, whom he feared would be further unsettled by the condemnation, and published the sermon with supporting quotations from the Caroline divines and notes from the fathers.<br>
<br>Newman's submission to Rome on 9 October 1845, &#145;one of the deep sorrows of my life&#146;  (letter to <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 9 Oct 1865) as Pusey described it, left him exposed as the reluctant leader of the party. Almost immediately he had to face a storm of hostility over the consecration of St Saviour's, Leeds, on 28 October. He had built the church anonymously after the death of his wife to further the work of his friend W. F. Hook in evangelizing the city and as an act of penitence. Hook was fearful and did not even want him to come to Leeds, and the bishop of the diocese, C. J. Longley, raised repeated objections to its furnishings, even, most hurtfully to Pusey, to the inscription on the communion plate given by Pusey's daughter, Lucy, on her deathbed the previous year. Pusey wished the octave of the consecration to be kept as a kind of retreat, and there were sermons every day, mostly preached, though not all written, by him, which were subsequently published. The early death of Maria Pusey in 1839 after only eleven years of marriage was but one of the tragedies in Pusey's private life. Of their four children, one died in infancy, one, the only son, Philip, became deaf and lame after an illness in 1838, and a third, the eldest, Lucy, who was particularly close to him because she shared his hopes for the revival of the religious life, died, like her mother of consumption, in 1844. He outlived most of his closest friends, even some of the younger ones such as Bishop Forbes, news of whose death in 1875 caused him to go deaf, and Miss Sellon in 1876. Affectionate and sensitive by nature, he felt these losses deeply. He retired from society after his wife's death and became reclusive. He was also wounded by the misrepresentations and criticisms of his theological position and the questioning of his loyalty to the Church of England. He regarded his personal losses and the obloquy he endured as chastenings, or even punishment, by God for his sins. He lived the life of a penitent, rather like a desert father and, in his private papers, expressed self-loathing. He had practised systematic fasting from about 1835 but after 1839 he adopted other traditional ascetic practices, such as wearing hair cloth and using the discipline, the extent of which are revealed in the rule of life he showed Keble, whom he asked to be his confessor and director  (Liddon, 3.104&#150;8). Rumours of his own asceticism and the advice he gave to others, particularly nuns, both fascinated and repelled people. By some he was regarded as a saint, by others as unbalanced or worse. For those who agreed with his beliefs, his sufferings and reputation for holiness gave him great moral authority.<br>
<br>For the rest of his long life Pusey acted as the stabilizing force of the Catholic revival, steadfast in his loyalty to the Church of England, quietly persistent in his teaching about the meaning of the sacraments and their value in practice, dogged in his fight against rationalism and liberalism.<h2>
<a name="Eucharisticteaching"></a>Eucharistic teaching</h2>Pusey's personal spirituality increasingly centred on the eucharist. He urged more frequent celebrations, and himself, in middle age, used to celebrate every day in his own house at four in the morning. He was concerned, however, that increased communions should be accompanied by more disciplined lives. In 1853 he preached another university sermon, <span class="italic">The Presence of Christ in the Holy Eucharist</span>, &#145;to set forth to young men the greatness of the mystery, that they should be more careful to live as they should, to whom such gifts are vouchsafed&#146;  (Liddon, 3.424). The prosecution of Archdeacon Denison for preaching the same doctrine, though rather unwisely expressed, led Pusey to produce notes to his sermon setting out the patristic evidence. They constituted a volume of 724 pages, published in 1855. The following year he drew up a declaration in protest against a church court's condemnation of Denison, which was signed by most of the leading high-churchmen. In 1857 he wrote another volume of minute scholarship, <span class="italic">The real presence of the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, the doctrine of the English church</span>, defending their teaching from the Anglican formularies. The prosecution of another friend, W. J. E. Bennett, vicar of Frome, for his eucharistic teaching, expressed in an open <span class="italic">Letter to Pusey</span> in 1868, drew Pusey once more into the defence of eucharistic doctrine. He felt himself to be on trial as, except for two careless expressions which he persuaded Bennett to retract, the language of the letter was largely his. He even tried to get the Church Association to prosecute him instead. The court of arches acquitted Bennett in 1870 and its judgment was upheld by the privy council in 1872. In the interval Pusey published his last statement on the eucharist, a university sermon, <span class="italic">This is my Body</span> (1871). He always claimed to have no interest in eucharistic ceremonial, although he invariably used a mixed chalice and even wore vestments in places where it was the custom, but when &#145;ritualist&#146; priests were prosecuted under the <span class="roman">Public Worship Regulation Act</span> of 1874 he came to their defence on the grounds that they were &#145;setting before the eyes&#146;, giving outward expression to what he believed. It was in response to the bishops' first attempt to restrain the ritualists that he declared that<blockquote>if it should be decided by competent authority, that either the real Objective Presence, or the Eucharistic Sacrifice, or the worship of Christ there present &hellip; were contrary to the doctrine held by the Church of England, I would resign my office. (E. B. Pusey, &#145;Will ye also go away&#146;, 1867, 28, <span class="italic">University Sermons, 1864&#150;1879</span>, 1880)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Practiceofconfession"></a>Practice of confession</h2>Pusey's name will always be associated with the revival of auricular confession: he became a kind of confessor extraordinary to the Church of England. In a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> on 13 November 1866 he said, &#145;I have been applied to to receive confessions from persons in every rank, of every age, old as well as young, in every profession, even those which you would think least accessible to it&#151;army, navy, medicine, law&#146;. His first university sermon after his suspension, in 1846, was on the spiritual and practical value of confession, <span class="italic">The Entire Absolution of the Penitent</span>. He followed it up with a second sermon, defending his interpretation of the Anglican formularies which had been questioned, and two days later made his own first confession to Keble. In 1850, having been criticized for hearing confessions outside his home diocese, he defended his practice in an open letter to W. U. Richards, <span class="italic">The Church of England Leaves her Children Free to whom to Open their Griefs</span>. He was also criticized for hearing confessions of young persons without parental knowledge and consent. For this and other practices which, it was alleged, &#145;tended to the spread of Romanism amongst us&#146;  (Liddon, 3.302), his own bishop, Samuel Wilberforce, secretly inhibited him from preaching in the diocese of Oxford. The unwise petition of 483 clergymen to convocation for the &#145;licensing of qualified confessors&#146; in 1873 roused a furore. Pusey, T. T. Carter, and one or two others drafted a <span class="italic">Declaration on Confession and Absolution, as Set Forth by the Church of England</span>, a concise and careful statement of their understanding. In 1878 he published an edition of a French <span class="italic">Manual for Confessors</span>, by the Abb&eacute; Gaume, adapted for the use of Anglicans, with a lengthy historical and apologetic preface. Later that year the second Lambeth conference passed a resolution which appeared to condemn detailed confessions and the practice of habitual confession. Pusey responded by publishing a letter to the archbishop, <span class="italic">Habitual Confession not Discouraged by the Resolution Accepted by the Lambeth Conference</span>, minimizing the resolution and asking whether he should consider himself censured by the resolution.<h2>
<a name="Revivalofthereligiouslife"></a>Revival of the religious life</h2>Pusey first began thinking about the revival of the religious life in 1834, partly for practical reasons (for evangelism and for relief and educational work among the poor) and partly for spiritual reasons (to meet the desire for a more devout life on the part of some who might otherwise have become Roman Catholics). He collected information about the rules, work, devotions, and discipline of Roman Catholic communities, and even visited several convents in Ireland in 1841. Independently of him a group of laymen led by Lord John Manners decided to establish a sisterhood in memory of the poet Southey, and a house was opened in Park Village, London, on 26 March 1845. The external work was under the direction of the parish priest, William Dodsworth, but Pusey was the spiritual superintendent, and in fact had to take on more and more responsibility for its direction and finances. A similar experiment was started in 1848 in Plymouth by Priscilla Lydia Sellon, and after a few years the two communities joined together to form the Society of the Most Holy Trinity. Pusey had no official connection with the society, although he became adviser to, and intimate friend as well as spiritual director of, Miss Sellon. He also heard the confessions of many of the sisters and was a great benefactor of the community. He gave most of the money he inherited from his mother in 1858 towards the building of a priory for the sisters and a convalescent hospital at Ascot. He often spent part of the long vacation there with Miss Sellon and went abroad with her on more than one occasion. Their relationship caused much gossip and her brother eventually published a formal denial of any engagement between them. In 1841 Pusey had received the vows of Marian Rebecca Hughes, who eventually started the Society of the Holy and Undivided Trinity in Oxford some ten years later, after what she called &#145;a sort of novitiate&#146;, in Pusey's house in Christ Church. He also influenced another early community, the Sisters of Bethany, through its founder and first superior, Ethel Benett, who was one of his penitents. Pusey had hoped to establish a college of celibate priests living under a rule at St Saviour's, Leeds, but this ambition was never realized. Father Ignatius (Joseph Leycester Lyne) claimed the support of Pusey in reviving the Benedictine life in the Church of England but, although Pusey initially encouraged him, he had little to do with his later experiments. Pusey presided at the first meeting which led to the foundation of the Cowley Fathers, the Society of St John the Evangelist, in 1866, but his influence on the community was only indirect, through Father Benson, the first superior, who owed much to him both intellectually and spiritually.<h2>
<a name="Ecumenicalendeavours"></a>Ecumenical endeavours</h2>Pusey must also be regarded as one of the leading ecumenists of the nineteenth century. He early appreciated that unity was of the essence to the church and that reunion involved not only the search for truth but also prayer and penitence and the pursuit of holiness. In 1844 he published the first of a series of Roman Catholic devotional books mostly by the French affective writers Jean Baptiste Avrillon and Jean Joseph Surin, adapted for use in the Church of England, in order to encourage and deepen holiness of life. He was much criticized for the project, although there were precedents for such adaptations. He justified it on the grounds that &#145;whatever the Holy Spirit has anywhere given to the Church, He has given to the whole Church. It belongs to us as a portion of that Church&#146;  (J. B. Avrillon, <span class="italic">Lent</span>, 2nd edn, 1844, xiii).<br>
<br>Newman's secession to the Roman Catholic church was a crushing blow to Pusey, but within a few days he published his prophetic view that it might help to bring about reunion between Roman Catholics and Anglicans:<blockquote>If anything could open their eyes as to what is good in us, or soften in us any wrong prejudices against them, it would be the presence of such an one, nurtured and grown to such ripeness in our Church and now removed to theirs. (Liddon, 2.461)</blockquote>Henceforth he adopted a neutral position towards the Roman Catholic church. In 1850, in the face of mounting hostility towards Rome in the wake of further defections over the Gorham judgment and rumours of the establishment of a Roman hierarchy in England, he resolutely resisted the attempts of some in the Catholic movement to make any formal anti-Roman declaration to defend themselves against the accusation of being a fifth column. He spoke powerfully at meetings of the Church Unions in both Bristol and London and carried the day.<br>
<br>In 1865, stung by a taunt of Manning and perhaps stimulated by a reunion with Newman and Keble at Keble's vicarage in Hursley, Pusey published what was to be the first part of an <span class="italic">Eirenicon</span>, an open <span class="italic">Letter to Keble</span>. There were two further parts, in the form of <span class="italic">Letters to Newman</span>, published in 1869 and 1870, on the eve of the meeting of the first Vatican Council. Pusey was motivated by the belief that the two communions could be reconciled by mutual explanations of their formularies. From the Anglican side, he was convinced they were &#145;kept apart much more by that vast practical system which lies beyond the letter of the Council of Trent, things which are taught with quasi-authority in the Roman Church, than by what is actually defined&#146;  (<span class="italic">Eirenicon</span>, 1, 1865, 98). In the <span class="italic">Letter to Keble</span> he set out the difficulties of Anglicans over the cult of the Virgin Mary, particularly the doctrine of the immaculate conception, and over the position of the papacy. The fact that he did not make his purpose clear led to Newman's accusing him of &#145;discharging his olive branch as if from a catapult&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letter to Pusey</span>, 1866, 9).<br>
<br>Pusey also tried to explain the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> which, he admitted, &#145;made negative statements to show against what she [the Church of England] protested, but set down no positive statement to explain what on the same subjects she accepted&#146;  (<span class="italic">Eirenicon</span>, 1, 1865, 267). First, in 1865, he reprinted Newman's <span class="roman">Tract 90</span> together with a historical preface by himself, and an essay by Keble, which had only been privately circulated earlier, <span class="italic">Catholic Subscription to the 39 Articles</span>. All through 1867 he worked closely with his friend Alexander Forbes, bishop of Brechin, on a lengthy volume entitled <span class="italic">Explanation of the 39 Articles</span>. Although it was published under Forbes's name alone in 1867, parts of it are by Pusey.<br>
<br>Spurred on by rumours of an imminent council, Pusey went to France in the autumn and again in the winter of 1865 to meet bishops and theologians, to get a hearing with &#145;the non-extreme party&#146; as he put it. He was greatly encouraged, particularly by the response of the archbishop of Paris, Darboy, and the bishop of Orl&eacute;ans, Dupanloup. Both offered to lay any propositions he might make before the council. Pusey and Forbes also entered into a correspondence with a Belgian Jesuit, Victor De Buck, who suggested that Forbes should go in person to the council with Pusey as his theologian. Pusey was cautious. He preferred his own idea of written propositions and actually drafted some in Latin which he sent to Newman for comment. In the end, no propositions were submitted. The climate of opinion at Rome became increasingly unfavourable, and any interest in the question of reunion was overwhelmed by the mounting pressure to define the infallibility of the pope. The definition crushed his hopes. &#145;I have done what I could&#146;, he told Newman, &#145;and now have done with controversy and <span class="roman">Eirenica</span>&#146;  (Liddon, 4.193).<br>
<br>Pusey was not solely concerned with the possibility of reunion with Rome, although he came to think of it as a priority. He had, in fact, originally looked to Orthodoxy. He withdrew his initial support for the proposal in 1841 to establish a bishopric in Jerusalem for Anglicans and Lutherans when he discovered that Anglican and Lutheran missionaries were proselytizing among the Orthodox. He joined the Eastern Church Association at its foundation in 1864 and had discussions with various Orthodox dignitaries when they visited England. In 1867 he was largely responsible for altering the draft of a memorial on reunion, which was to be presented to the First Lambeth conference, so that it commended attempts to approach both the Orthodox and Roman Catholics. However, 1870 saw the dashing of his hopes for reunion with the Orthodox as well as with the Roman Catholics. Conversation with a visiting bishop, Archbishop Lycurgos of Syria and Temos, convinced him that the filioque controversy was insoluble. He subsequently elaborated his views in a long historical essay in the form of a letter to H. P. Liddon, <span class="italic">On the Clause &#145;and the Son&#146;</span>, in 1876. He was convinced that the Orthodox view that it involves heresy was &#145;invincible prejudice&#146;, although he was willing that the Western church should anathematize that heresy so long as it had the right to retain the clause in the creed. Dr Dollinger, the leader of the Old Catholics, claimed that &#145;the mischief&#146; done by Dr Pusey in the line which he took on the filioque was one of the reasons for there being no third Bonn conference on reunion between Anglicans, Orthodox, and Old Catholics. Pusey, convinced that he was being eirenic, characteristically ended his essay hopefully, speaking of it as his &#145;last contribution to a future which I shall not see&#146;  (<span class="italic">On the Clause</span>, 1876, 181).<br>
<br>Pusey had little to do with protestantism, although he was always charitable in his dealings with individual protestants. In the preface to the volume <span class="italic">Essays on the Reunion of Christendom</span> edited by F. G. Lee in 1867, however, he wrote against a proposal for reunion with the Lutherans in Scandinavia on the grounds that they had a &#145;radically different&#146; doctrine of the fall and redemption, were &#145;in error&#146; as regards the eucharist, and that for them to receive Episcopal consecration or ordination would only be &#145;a concession to our supposed prejudices&#146;. With Lord Ashley (later Shaftesbury), &#145;a Protestant of the Protestants&#146;  (Hodder, 325), he had a fluctuating relationship. They were cousins and Christ Church contemporaries, disagreed over the Jerusalem bishopric and other religious issues, but were reconciled in 1864 in opposition to &#145;neology&#146;. After Pusey's death Shaftesbury wrote that, despite their disagreements, &#145;I &hellip; reverenced his profound piety&#146;  (ibid., 735).<h2>
<a name="Fightagainstrationalism"></a>Fight against rationalism</h2>Another of Pusey's lifelong interests was his fight against rationalism and secularism, liberalism as he and Newman called it, or the &#145;strong tide of half-belief, misbelief, unbelief, which so largely occupied every sort of literature&#146; as he once characterized it in a sermon  (Liddon, 4.77). The experience of failing to win back to Christianity his sceptical Eton friend Julian Hibbert haunted him. He referred to it at the last meeting which he attended of the governing body of Christ Church in 1882. His opposition to Dr Hampden's being made regius professor of divinity in 1836 was motivated by his fear of rationalism, &#145;the assumption that uncontrolled human reason in its present degraded form is the primary interpreter of God's Word&#146;  (ibid., 1.373). When a royal commission revealed its plans for the reform of Oxford University in 1852, Pusey was foremost in defending it as a place of moral and religious education rather than as &#145;a forcing house for intellect&#146;. His lengthy evidence, informed by his first-hand knowledge of university education in Germany on which the commissioners' proposals were modelled, was the largest contribution to the volume produced by the university authorities in opposition to them. He backed it up in 1854 by a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Collegiate and Professorial Teaching and Discipline</span>. When, in spite of the opposition, an act reforming the university on the basis of the commission's report was passed, Pusey was elected to the new hebdomadal council and proved a hardworking and effective member. His influence softened the impact of the reforms, slowing down the process of change so that the ethos of the university remained predominantly Anglican in spite of the abolition of subscription to the articles and the admission of nonconformists.<br>
<br>One of the most influential liberals was Benjamin Jowett, the master of Balliol and regius professor of Greek. He was one of the contributors to <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span>, a volume published in 1860 which became a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> for its perceived heterodoxy. Pusey opposed a very reasonable proposal to increase Jowett's salary on the grounds that it would express the university's approval of his theological views. He even went to the lengths of prosecuting him for those views before the court of the vice-chancellor of the university, although he eventually had to drop the case as there was doubt about the court's jurisdiction. The attempt outraged the liberals, and Pusey's subsequent support for increasing the endowment of the Greek chair in a different way alienated some of his friends.<br>
<br>Meanwhile two other contributors to <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span> had been prosecuted for heresy in the church courts. In 1864, however, the judicial committee of the privy council, the then final court of appeal, reversed the lower court judgment and ruled their statements were not contrary to the formularies of the Church of England. Pusey was prominent in trying to neutralize the effects of this. He was one of a group that drew up a declaration on the inspiration of scripture which was eventually signed by 11,000 clergymen. He published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Case as to the Legal Force of the Judgment of the Privy Council</span> (1864), and preached a series of powerful university sermons countering the essayists' views on the atonement, prophecy, everlasting punishment, and the ground of faith. His lectures on <span class="roman">Daniel</span> also come from this period.<br>
<br>In 1869 an attempt was made to drop the use of the Athanasian creed in accordance with the rubrics of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, largely because of the misunderstanding of the damnatory clauses. Much of Pusey's correspondence, both public and private, over the next few years was occupied in agitating against this attempt and in defending and explaining the creed. He also delivered a fine university sermon in Advent 1872, <span class="italic">The Responsibility of the Intellect in Matters of Faith</span>, expounding its teaching. His public threat to retire from his teaching office if the use or the wording of the creed were altered led to the abandonment of the project, although he agreed to the publication of an explanatory note and, indeed, suggested various versions of it. A few years later his views on everlasting punishment were attacked by Dr Farrar in a series of sermons in Westminster Abbey, subsequently published in 1887 under the title <span class="italic">Eternal Hope</span>. After a delay of two years, largely due to his prostration after the death of his only son, Philip, Pusey answered this in a book which was very influential at the time: <span class="italic">What is of Faith as to Everlasting Punishment?</span>
<br>
<br>Pusey was rigid in his stance on doctrinal orthodoxy and very conservative in biblical criticism, but he encouraged the introduction of natural science into the university and supported the setting up of the University Museum. In a paper to the church congress in Norwich in 1865, he tried to reconcile the supposed antagonism between the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and the physical sciences, claiming that there was no need to fear scientific research and asserting that &#145;the right interpretation of God's Word will never be found in contradiction to the right interpretation of His works&#146;  (Liddon, 4.80). In his penultimate sermon to the university in 1878, <span class="italic">Unscience, not Science Adverse to Faith</span>, which had to be read by his disciple and biographer H. P. Liddon, he reaffirmed his view that Christianity need have no fear of true science. He even allowed a place for evolutionary theories. &#145;Theology does not hold them excluded by <span class="roman">Holy Scripture</span>, so that they spare the soul of man&#146;  (ibid., 334).<h2>
<a name="Asapreacher"></a>As a preacher</h2>The list of Pusey's published writings occupies over forty pages in an appendix to Liddon's biography. Most are works occasioned by some controversy, some, such as the incomplete <span class="italic">The Royal Supremacy not an Arbitrary Authority</span> (1850) and <span class="italic">The Councils of the Church</span> (1857), so substantial as to be works of reference. The most widely read were his collections of sermons, nine in all. He preached not only in the university and cathedral but also in London and Bristol, and places where he holidayed. He was no orator. He spoke &#145;in a low, deep, rather monotonous voice, which in his later years was thick and husky&#146;. His style was crabbed and quaint, his sentences long and involved, full of neologisms and archaic words. His sermons were packed with references to the fathers and Anglican divines, but he delivered them with intense earnestness &#145;as from a man inhabiting his message&#146;, and conveyed an &#145;overwhelming impression of personal saintliness&#146;. He preached ecstatically on the joys of heaven and the union of God and man, but he was also outspoken on the social evils of the day and the hypocrisy of the rich. He taught a very practical form of holiness, especially to the country people of Pusey, &#145;in short pithy sayings which stuck in their minds&#146;. At the end of his weighty university sermons, his manner would change:<blockquote>He would lift his eyes from his manuscript to the Undergraduates' Gallery, and, addressing us as &#145;My Sons&#146; would give us a quarter of an hour of directly personal appeal; searching the hearts' secrets, urging repentance, and exhorting to a way of life more consistent with our Divine vocation. (Russell, 97, 170f.)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Appearanceanddeath"></a>Appearance and death</h2>Pusey would never sit for his portrait or allow a photograph to be taken of him, probably because he had refused his wife's request but also out of humility. He told Newman it was &#145;utterly unfitting that any likeness should be taken of me, who have so sorely injured the likeness of God in me&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Letters and Diaries of John Henry Newman</span>, ed. C. S. Dessain and others, 31 vols., 11-31, 1961&#150;77, 11.36). After his death a death mask was taken. George Richmond sculpted a bust of him, and also painted a portrait, as did Rosa Corder. The personal feature most often remarked on was &#145;his gentle winning smile&#146;. Pusey died at The Hermitage, Ascot Priory, Berkshire, on 16 September 1882, and was buried, in the same grave as his wife and two eldest daughters, at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, on St Matthew's day, 21 September. After his death his friends purchased his theological library and endowed the Dr Pusey Memorial Library (the &#145;Puseum&#146;), later Pusey House, St Giles', Oxford, both a library and a &#145;house of sacred learning&#146;, providing pastoral care and theological instruction to members of the university. Pusey Street, Pusey Lane, and Pusey Place, Oxford, were later named after him.<h2>
<a name="Significance"></a>Significance</h2>Pusey devoted his life to the recovery and reaffirmation of the Catholic inheritance of the Church of England. To this end he threw in his lot with the Oxford Movement, seeing himself as one strand in the &#145;triple-cord&#146;, together with Newman and Keble. When Newman seceded to Rome he kept the movement on a steady course, in spite of the defections to Rome. Frederick Oakeley, one of the converts, described him as the &#145;St Barnabas of the movement&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historical Notes</span>, 1865, 49). His role was to reconcile and explain, which he did with singular reasonableness and charity. His last public intervention in controversy, the publication of the pamphlet <span class="italic">Unlaw in Judgements of the Judicial Committee and its Remedies</span> (1881), was a plea for peace in the church and the reform of the court of appeal. Pusey was a man of great learning and patient scholarship, so that it was appropriate that his library was preserved as his memorial in Pusey House. He was also a man of profound spirituality, the &#145;doctor mysticus&#146; of the Tractarians, as Brilioth called him  (<span class="italic">The Anglican Revival</span>, 1925, 296). This is apparent in his <span class="italic">Spiritual Letters</span> and published prayers, but above all in his sermons, where his theology and scholarship, his personal sufferings and wrestlings in prayer, his eucharistic devotion and love of God come together.<br>
