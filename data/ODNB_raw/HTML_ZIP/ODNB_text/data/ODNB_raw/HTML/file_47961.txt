<span class="headword">Newdigate, Sir  Richard</span>, second baronet  (1644&#150;1710), <span class="occ">landowner and mining entrepreneur</span>, was born on 5 May 1644, the eighth child and third (but first surviving) son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20002/', "Richard Newdigate (1602&#150;1678)")</script> and his wife, Juliana (<i>c</i>.1610&#150;1685), sister of Sir Francis Leigh, Baron Dunsmore, later earl of Chichester. He claimed William Fuller (1608&#150;1675) as his old schoolmaster, and was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1654 when his father was created sergeant. Matriculating at Christ Church, Oxford, on 21 March 1661, he was still in residence in 1662, but left without a degree. However, he retained lasting links with Oxford, especially through correspondence with the dean of Christ Church, John Fell (1625&#150;1686).<br>
<br>After his first marriage, on 21 December 1665 to Mary (1646&#150;1692), daughter of Sir Edward Bagot of Blithefield, Staffordshire, Newdigate settled at Arbury Hall, the family seat near Nuneaton in Warwickshire. Here, in addition to acting as broker for certain Birmingham gunsmiths and drawing up proposals for a canal between the Severn and the Avon, he embarked on increasingly ambitious and costly schemes for the improvement of his estates. To his house were added an elaborate private chapel, grandiose stables, and gardens which impressed his contemporaries. A comprehensive five-volume study of his parish, Chilvers Coton, undertaken for him between 1681 and 1684, provides a uniquely detailed and accurate picture of landownership, land use, and community structure at this time.<br>
<br>Newdigate's particular enthusiasm was reserved for his coal mines, and he considered himself such an expert on them that &#145;it was morally impossible that he should fail&#146;  (Newdigate, <span class="italic">The Case</span>). His inventiveness extended to the construction of a waterway to carry coal from Arbury to Nuneaton (1687), the pioneering use of gunpowder blasting, and the installation of a &#145;great water wheel&#146; to drain the pits (1707). The wheel cost about &pound;2360, but soon after Newdigate's death it was superseded by a Newcomen engine. Investment was heavy; returns habitually fell short of Newdigate's over-optimistic expectations.<br>
<br>Newdigate's private writings reveal a pious, orthodox Anglican, and he had friends in the Caroline clerical establishment. However, he had an acrimonious dispute with the incumbent at one of his family's residences at Harefield, in Middlesex, and his uncompromising anti-popery and chosen political stance brought accusations of over-familiarity with &#145;fanatics&#146;. Appointed in 1675 to the Warwickshire commission of the peace, on which he was fairly active, he soon displayed wider ambitions. An abortive attempt in early 1678 to enter the war against France brought charges of levying troops without a warrant. His unsuccessful candidacy for a county seat in both elections of 1679 alienated a majority of the Warwickshire gentry, who were critical of his &#145;country&#146; stance and personal demeanour. In November 1679 the lords Denbigh and Brooke gained his dismissal both from the magistrates' bench and from his position, briefly, as gentleman of the privy chamber. Yet two months later he was offered a peerage and, &#145;despite abominable foul play&#146;  (Newdigate to Conway, <span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1680&#150;81</i>, 43&#150;4), reported to Edward, earl of Conway, the vindication of his behaviour at the summer assizes. Elected to the Oxford parliament of 1681, he made contact with Monmouth, but had his considerable armoury confiscated after the Rye House plot and had to work hard after James's accession to prove his loyalty. Restored to the bench and returned to the Convention Parliament in 1689, he continued an active and loyal magistrate to William III.<br>
<br>In the last decade of Newdigate's life, his once affectionate relations with most of his seven daughters and four surviving sons deteriorated. Their petition in 1701 to have him declared insane was withdrawn after arbitration, but rifts reopened after his second marriage, to Henrietta (<i>d</i>. 1739), daughter of Thomas Wigginton, contracted on 6 August 1703 but acknowledged only after a court of arches case in 1704. Newdigate's outrage at his &#145;persecution&#146; was manifested in a colourful, but largely unconvincing, pamphlet in 1707. There were no surviving children from this marriage.<br>
<br>Newdigate died in London on 4 January 1710 and was buried with his ancestors at Harefield. His heir, Richard, whose so-called &#145;hellish contrivances&#146;  (WCRO, CR136, C1977) led to his exclusion from Newdigate's will, inherited by prior settlement an estate overburdened by debt.<br>
