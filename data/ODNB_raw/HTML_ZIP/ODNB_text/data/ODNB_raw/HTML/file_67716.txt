<span class="headword">Leigh,  John</span>  (1812&#150;1888), <span class="occ">medical officer of health</span>, was born on 8 June 1812, reputedly at Foxdenton Hall, Chadderton, near Oldham, but possibly in Liverpool, the son of Thomas Leigh (<i>c</i>.1778&#150;1847), druggist and tea dealer of Ashton under Lyne, and his wife, Hannah (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1778), daughter of Hugh Shaw of Saddleworth. He later claimed affinity with the Leighs of West Hall, High Leigh, Cheshire, and the earls of Bridgewater  (Ormerod, 1.456&#150;7), but Stancliffe doubts the validity of this claim  (Stancliffe, 277), and Egerton Leigh of High Leigh refers to him only as &#145;my talented young friend Mr John Leigh&#146; without attributing kinship  (E. Leigh, x). He was educated at the Moravian school at Fairfield and apprenticed in 1827 to William Dyson, surgeon, of Ashbourne. In 1831 Leigh went to Manchester for further training at the infirmary and associated medical schools, and he subsequently lectured in two schools in chemistry and forensic medicine. From 1834 to 1837, holding the licence of the Society of Apothecaries of London, Leigh was physicians' clerk (resident medical officer) at the Manchester Infirmary. Following additional surgical training at Guy's Hospital, London, he proceeded to membership of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1837.<br>
<br>Thereafter Leigh practised from 26 St John Street, Deansgate, Manchester, and became registrar of births and deaths of the Deansgate sub-district, analyst to Manchester gasworks, and consultant to chemical manufacturers. A fellow of the Chemical Society, while experimenting with coal-tar he resolved the basic chemistry of aniline dyes, which he reported to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1842 and in subsequent papers. However, he failed to patent his discoveries, and others profited commercially from them. He published various papers on public health, that with Ner Gardiner, the superintendent registrar, being the definitive description of Manchester's 1849 cholera outbreak. In 1844 he lectured to the Manchester Royal Institution on the sanitary condition of Manchester, and the next year he published a pamphlet praising Alderman Alexander Kay for his long-standing interest in the condition of the inhabitants of Manchester.<br>
<br>In 1868, after intense pressure from the Manchester and Salford Sanitary Association for the appointment of a medical man to spearhead a reversal of the city's notoriously poor status in public health, Leigh was appointed Manchester's first medical officer of health by a majority vote of the council, at a salary of &pound;500 per annum, while retaining his private practice. He made strenuous efforts, detailed in his annual reports, to improve the health of the population. He worked to overcome the prevalent infectious diseases, including smallpox and typhus, through district inspections, the notification of infectious disease, disinfestation of clothing and houses, and the provision of baths, wash-houses, open spaces, parks, and hospital beds; and he campaigned for the total abolition of cellar dwellings. Leigh's report of 1868 to the corporation suggesting the need for more isolation hospitals led to the opening in 1871 of a new fever hospital at Monsall to the north of the city.<br>
<br>Leigh also urged the council not to pursue wholesale clearance of slum housing, but to upgrade &#145;back to back&#146; houses by opening the wall between each pair, so as to create &#145;through-houses&#146;. When he took office, the majority of dwellings in the centre of Manchester were in courts, with privy-middens and cesspools for excreta, classically described earlier by James Kay and Friedrich Engels. Leigh introduced a general pail-closet system with cinder sifters to replace the middens. He did not favour water systems, partly because of distrust about the sustainability of Manchester's water supply, but also because his pail system yielded saleable manure, potentially benefiting the council. By the end of the century Leigh's system had failed because Manchester's householders did not maintain the closets adequately, and evidence emerged that council workers secretly discharged raw sewage in volume into the River Medlock. At Leigh's death, though the health of Manchester residents had improved substantially, it still remained the worst of the large cities of the country.<br>
<br>Leigh had many interests. He assisted E. W. Binney in pioneering geological surveys in and around Manchester. During one, at Newtown, near Collyhurst, they discovered a number of fossil shells not previously described. One was named in Leigh's honour <i>Rissoa leighi</i>. Leigh also published several poetic works, including <span class="italic">Lays and Legends of Cheshire</span> (1880), and was president of the Spenser Society and poet laureate of John Shaw's Club. His large library contained a fine reference collection of English plants, and many rare books, including a celebrated collection of Bewick's works, reflecting an ornithological interest. He was a founder of the local Rosicrucians: twelve gentlemen who dined monthly and made antiquarian field visits. John Harland, another founder, recorded each meeting in his newspaper, the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. At the inaugural meeting at Leigh's home, Leigh himself presented a paper on a bronze statue of Jupiter Stator, excavated at Campfield, Manchester.<br>
<br>Leigh married, on 29 August 1840, Marianne (<i>c</i>.1809&#150;1847), daughter of Robert Goodwin of Ashbourne, Derbyshire, and they had a daughter, Marianne, and a son, Francis; on 11 October 1848 he married Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1820&#150;1891), daughter of William Collier of Weaste, Salford, with whom he had two daughters, Gertrude and Beatrice, and three sons, Arthur, Piers Henry, and Egerton. On becoming medical officer of health, Leigh moved to a new home, Sandiway, in the emerging Manchester suburb of Whalley Range. In 1879 he erected a large mansion in the Tudor style, in Hale Barns, Cheshire, which he called the Manor House, moving again to become one of Hale Barns's first commuters. He died there, from cardiac disease, on 11 November 1888, still in office. His will gave a life interest in his estate to his widow, and the residue to his three daughters, seemingly excluding his three surviving sons. Leigh was buried on 15 November 1888 in the nearby churchyard at Timperley.<br>
