<span class="headword">James,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1550&#150;1601), <span class="occ">record-keeper and physician</span>, was the only known child of Richard James (<i>c</i>.1524&#150;1581) and Jane Overnone (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1524), of Newport, Isle of Wight. James matriculated as sizar from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1564, becoming a scholar in 1565. He proceeded BA in 1568; became a fellow in 1569 and MA in 1571; and was licensed to practise medicine in 1575 before receiving his MD in 1578. Travelling to the Netherlands in September 1578 as England's first student at Leiden University medical school, he entered the &#145;physic line&#146; and successfully incorporated his Cambridge degree into a second MD. Admitted as a candidate (1582), fellow (1584), and censor (1588, 1591, 1594) of the College of Physicians, he became physician to Queen Elizabeth's household in November 1595 at a fee of &pound;50 per annum. Skilled in Spanish and other modern languages, he also served as the queen's reader, and a prebendary of Salisbury Cathedral (1591). He married in 1570 Elizabeth Caplin, with whom he had at least three sons, including the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14601/', "Francis James")</script>.<br>
<br>The patronage of the earl of Leicester and Sir Francis Walsingham, secretary of state, secured James a mastership of requests (1577), to assist Thomas Wilson, Leiden alumnus and &#145;clerk of the papers&#146;, in recovering government documents from private hands. James succeeded Wilson as custodian of the papers in November 1578 at &pound;40 per annum, and often used his proficiency in languages in translating manuscripts. He found the state papers scattered among the shelves and storage chests of an inadequate Whitehall muniment room, on loan to government departments and antiquaries, and &#145;in the study&#146; of Walsingham's &#145;post house&#146; in Seething Lane, London. Consequently, he soon joined the council clerk Robert Beale in requesting that &#145;publicke&#146; papers no longer remain in government officials' homes; and then set about to make an inventory of all of Secretary Walsingham's manuscripts, and to catalogue them in a volume entitled &#145;Walsingham's table book&#146;. Next, he began using &#145;docquets of parcels&#146; to itemize all manuscripts and instruments entrusted to departing diplomats, and occasionally provided them with historical briefs of Anglo-European relations, such as his &#145;Compendium Ansiaticum&#146;, which summarized all Anglo-Hanseatic relations, beginning with Edward VI and continuing into Elizabeth's reign.<br>
<br>Now an experienced archivist, James was assigned to examine and confiscate Walsingham's official papers following his death in 1590, only to discover that manuscript collectors had already pilfered the collection. The privy council ordered James to confiscate these essential documents, many of which he successfully retrieved. Still, he grew frustrated with his inadequate staff and muniment room, as well as the lack of a principal secretary of state between 1590 and 1598. He found many of the largely unbound domestic manuscripts in disarray or missing, due to unregistered loans. He also found it time-consuming and exhausting to sort, pack, and deliver &#145;diverse bookes, letters and other writinges for her Majesty's service&#146; when her court was away from Whitehall. Finally, in October 1597, James created order out of chaos by having three rooms built under the decrepit Banqueting House at Whitehall. There he installed manuscript &#145;presses&#146;, storage shelves, and a fireplace for drying documents, and sorted, indexed, and bundled all available letters and papers &#145;of lesser use&#146; dating from 1550. Following Lord Burghley's death in 1598, his private secretary, Sir Michael Hicks, and James were ordered by the secretary of state, Robert Cecil, to transfer all books and papers from his lordship's Covent Garden house to Sir Robert's Thames-side house in the Strand; they were not deposited in the Whitehall Paper Office, in order to avoid the antiquarian pilferings of that &#145;engrosser of antiquities&#146;, Robert Cotton. For this and other archival services James was paid the considerable sum of &pound;20. The substantial manuscript collections at Hatfield House, Hertfordshire, confirm Cecil's success in protecting his family's papers. However, what neither he nor James knew was that, between Burghley's death and funeral, Hicks had confiscated an equivalent 115 volumes of the treasurer's papers (now the Lansdowne MSS), and carried them off to his country house at Ruckholt, Essex.<br>
<br>James represented St Ives, Cornwall, in the 1584&#150;5 parliament at the behest of the two lords of the borough, Mountjoy and Winchester. He helped to formulate a bill making it treason knowingly to receive or aid Jesuit priests, only to be stunned by John Parry's vehement speech against the bill, and the subsequent discovery of his intent to assassinate the queen. James also scolded the &#145;undecent forms of speech&#146; of the corrupt and quarrelsome member for Gloucester, Thomas Atkins, who quickly reinterpreted his speech to the satisfaction of the house. Lord Burghley's submission of a bill to the Commons to end fraudulent conveyances incensed James and his colleagues as a violation of house prerogative and procedure, as it allowed victims of such fraud to seek redress in the Star Chamber, instead of the common law courts. Later, James represented Newcastle under Lyme in the reactionary 1593 parliament, which seemed determined to end puritan political power, recently weakened by the deaths of Leicester, Walter Mildmay, Walsingham, and the earl of Warwick. Sitting at the behest of his patron Robert Devereux, earl of Essex, James protested against Archbishop Whitgift's over-zealous drive for religious conformity. He also baulked at the Lords' unprecedented demand for three subsidies of &pound;140,000, in violation of the ancient tradition that such bills must originate in the Commons, and he served on the committee that negotiated a satisfactory compromise. His parliamentary career ended with membership on committees for &#145;reducing disloyal subjects to their due obedience&#146; and investigating the activities of Staffordshire brewers. The &#145;Mr. Doctor James&#146; serving on the privileges and subsidy committees of this parliament was the civilian lawyer Francis James.<br>
<br>In December 1599 Elizabeth sent James to a &#145;desperately sick&#146; earl of Essex with a message of comfort, the written opinions of eight physicians, and a pot of broth. Following the death at Christmas 1600 of Michael Heneage, James was promised the post of keeper of the Tower records, but took sick and died on about 26 January 1601. Soon afterwards his wife successfully petitioned Elizabeth for &#145;small&#146; pensions for her sons &#145;to relieve her family's wants&#146;.<br>
