<span class="headword">Smith,  Cyril James</span>  (1909&#150;1974), <span class="occ">pianist</span>, was born on 11 August 1909 at 101 Costa Street, Middlesbrough, Yorkshire, the youngest in the family of two sons and one daughter of Charles Ernest Smith, a bricklayer at an iron foundry, and his wife, Eva Mary Harrison. His father played the cornet in a brass band and organized piano lessons from local teachers for his children. Cyril Smith won a scholarship to Middlesbrough high school, and in 1926 was awarded a scholarship by the Royal College of Music, where he studied with Herbert Fryer and won the silver medal of the Worshipful Society of Musicians (1928) and the Dannreuther concerto prize. In 1929, while still a student, he was asked by Adrian Boult to perform the Brahms piano concerto no. 2 in B[flat] with the Birmingham City Orchestra, and this led to his first appearance at a Henry Wood Promenade Concert, in 1930, when he again played the Brahms concerto. After leaving the Royal College of Music in 1930, he took a job at the Baird television studio in Long Acre, London, accompanying the entertainment transmitted experimentally by the BBC every night after radio broadcasting had finished. He remained at this job after the BBC took over altogether and moved the studio to Broadcasting House, until 1934, when he was appointed professor of pianoforte at the Royal College of Music.<br>
<br>Cyril Smith became a very successful concert pianist, known especially as an interpreter of Rachmaninov's concertos and <span class="italic">Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini</span>. Rachmaninov thought his performances of the notoriously difficult third concerto the best he had heard from an English pianist, and arranged for him to record the work with Malcolm Sargent. Smith was married twice. A first marriage on 11 August 1931 to Andr&eacute;e Antoinette Marie (<i>b</i>. 1903/4), daughter of Elie Paty, a doctor, ended in divorce.<br>
<br>On 16 October 1937 Smith married his second wife, <a name="cosubject_98827"></a><span class="headword">Phyllis Doreen Sellick</span>  (1911&#150;2007), a talented <span class="occ">pianist</span> who specialized in the twentieth-century English and French repertory. She was born on 16 June 1911 at 13 Newbury Road, Newbury Park, Ilford, Essex, the daughter of George Montague Sellick (1871&#150;1933), electrical engineer, and his wife, Rosetta Grace, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Reynolds (1875&#150;1964), an amateur painter, and studied at the Royal Academy of Music, London, and the Paris Conservatoire. She made her d&eacute;but at Harrogate in 1933, playing Grieg's piano concerto. She also broadcast live on television, early broadcasts closing with a close-up of her hands playing suitably soporific music. For a few years after their marriage Cyril Smith and Phyllis Sellick continued to pursue independent careers, and during the war Smith toured for the Entertainments National Service Association, often playing several concerts a week. Smith played at the National Gallery lunchtime concerts while continuing to perform the piano concerto repertory with the leading English orchestras, especially the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra under Malcolm Sargent. Sellick gave the first performance of Michael Tippett's &#145;Fantasy Sonata&#146; for piano at the Queen Mary Hall, Bloomsbury, in 1938, and of his &#145;Fantasia on a Theme of Handel&#146; at the Wigmore Hall in 1942.<br>
<br>Cyril Smith and Phyllis Sellick formed a duet partnership in 1941, when Sir Henry Wood asked them to play Saint-Sa&euml;ns's <span class="italic">Carnival of the Animals</span> on the opening night of the 1941 series of Promenade Concerts, the first to be held in the Royal Albert Hall following the bombing of the Queen's Hall. After this, they built up their two-piano repertory, touring together for the British Council and the Entertainments National Service Association and notably making a tour of the Far East for the latter in September 1945. Their repertory increased as British composers began to write works for them: Vaughan Williams wrote <span class="italic">Introduction and Fugue</span> (1946), &#145;for Phyllis and Cyril&#146;; Joseph Cooper arranged Vaughan Williams's 1930 piano concerto, and they gave the first performance of this work, entitled <span class="italic">Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra</span>, under Adrian Boult in 1946; and they gave the first performance of Lennox Berkeley's concerto for two pianos, op. 30 (1948), which was also dedicated to them. At the same time, Cyril Smith had a heavy international touring schedule of solo recitals, mainly of pieces by Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt, and Rachmaninov, and performed concertos by Rachmaninov (nos. 2 and 3), Grieg, Tchaikovsky, and Beethoven (nos. 4 and 5). While he worked with many conductors, he had the closest relationship with Malcom Sargent.<br>
<br>In 1956 Cyril Smith and Phyllis Sellick&#151;who had two children, Graham (<i>b</i>. 1947) and Claire (<i>b</i>. 1949)&#151; took part in a tour by British musicians of the Soviet Union as part of a cultural mission led by Sir Arthur Bliss, master of the queen's music. In Kharkov, in Ukraine, Smith had a stroke, as a result of which he lost the use of his left arm. This stimulated friends and pupils to take the four-hand piano repertory and rearrange it for three hands: in his autobiography, <span class="italic">Duet for Three Hands</span> (1958), Smith describes the difficulty of learning to play one-third of the music with his right hand, while his wife had to learn to play one-third with each hand. Their first public performance as a three-handed act was in the summer of 1957, in Birmingham town hall, playing an arrangement of Mozart's concerto in E[flat] for two pianos, K365. Sir Arthur Bliss arranged his concerto for two pianos (1924) as a concerto for two pianos (three hands) for them, and they gave the first performance in 1968. Malcolm Arnold was one of several composers who wrote new works: Smith and Sellick gave the first performance of his <span class="italic">Concerto for Phyllis and Cyril</span> in 1969, and Gordon Jacob wrote a concerto for piano duet (three hands) and orchestra (1969). They recorded a three-hands arrangement of Lennox Berkeley's <span class="italic">Polka, Nocturne, and Capriccio</span>, op. 5, originally written for two pianos in 1934.<br>
<br>Cyril Smith and Phyllis Sellick were both appointed OBE in 1971. Smith died suddenly on 2 August 1974 at their home, Oak Lodge, 33 Fife Road, East Sheen, Surrey. After her husband's death Sellick formed a new professional partnership with the pianist Terence Beckles, but increasingly concentrated on her work as a piano teacher, continuing to give lessons until incapacitated by a stroke in 2006. One of her pupils, the Venezuelan virtuoso Clara Rodriguez, described her as &#145;a real inspiration in every way&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 28 May 2007). She died at Galsworthy House nursing home, Kingston Hill, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, on 26 May 2007, after another stroke. She was survived by her daughter Claire, a photographer, her son Graham having predeceased her in 1988.<br>
