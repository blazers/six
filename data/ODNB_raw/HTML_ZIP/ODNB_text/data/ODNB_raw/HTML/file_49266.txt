<span class="headword">&Oacute;l&aacute;f <span class="st"> [&Oacute;l&aacute;fr]</span> Tryggvason</span>  (<em>d.</em> 999), <span class="occ">king of Norway</span>, first appears in 994 when in the company of Swein Forkbeard (<i>d</i>. 1014) he failed to conquer London and afterwards raided Essex, Kent, Sussex, and Hampshire. His first appearance in England has often been dated to 991 and he has been made a participant in the famous battle of Maldon in that year. This story is, however, based on an entry in the A text of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, which conflates information relating to both 991 and 994. &Oacute;l&aacute;f had probably joined Swein on his expedition of 994 because Swein exercised the traditional Danish overlordship of Norway. While the army was wintering in Southampton, however, &AElig;thelred II (<i>d</i>. 1016) persuaded &Oacute;l&aacute;f to enter his service. A treaty, known as II &AElig;thelred, was set up to regulate the relationship between the English and the Norwegians while they were in England. The deal also involved &Oacute;l&aacute;f's baptism at Andover and an agreement that &Oacute;l&aacute;f would return to Norway and never return to England with hostile intentions. &AElig;thelred no doubt meant to make mischief between &Oacute;l&aacute;f and Swein, since stirring up problems for Swein in Scandinavia would help keep him away from England.<br>
<br>In later Norwegian historiography Haraldr inn H&aacute;rfagri 
    (Harald Finehair; <i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.930)
   was regarded as the founder of Norway, which was called his <i>allod</i> (his personal estate). Legitimacy therefore required descent from him. &Oacute;l&aacute;f is duly presented as a great-grandson of Harald but the account of his childhood and youth given by the Icelanders Oddr Snorrason (<i>c</i>.1200) and Snorri Sturluson (1179&#150;1241), based on Oddr, is conventional hagiography showing that ideas about his origin were very dim indeed. The story is that &Oacute;l&aacute;f's father, Tryggvi &Oacute;l&aacute;fsson, was killed before &Oacute;l&aacute;f was born. His mother then fled to Sweden, and, having been separated from her, &Oacute;l&aacute;f first spent six years as a slave in Estonia and later came to the court of King Vladimir (<i>d</i>. 1008) at Kiev. At the age of eighteen he left, intending to return to Norway but only reaching Poland where he married a princess and governed half the kingdom for three years. He then left the Baltic and went raiding in western Europe, finally marrying the sister of &Oacute;l&aacute;f Sihtricson (<i>d</i>. 981), king of Dublin. In reality &Oacute;l&aacute;f must have been a chieftain of some standing in Norway when he accompanied Swein to England. His descent from Harald is a postulate made in the twelfth century when the myth of Harald Finehair was constructed.<br>
<br>On his return to Norway &Oacute;l&aacute;f based himself in Tr&oslash;ndelag and secured recognition as king after the murder of H&aacute;kon, earl (<i>jarl</i>) of Hlathir. He extended his influence to all coastal Norway, partly through alliances with leading magnates like Erling Skjalgsson, who was married to &Oacute;l&aacute;f's sister. &Oacute;l&aacute;f is credited with a determined effort to evangelize Norway by the sword, although the eleventh-century chronicler Adam of Bremen described him as a pagan wizard. Efforts to organize the government of Norway and the appointment of <i>lendmen</i> as his local representatives are also ascribed to him, but the basis for this is very slender and the role accorded him in the Christianization of Iceland is pure myth. The only tangible evidence of his government is a few coins struck in his name. On these the moneyer's name is Godwine, but this Anglo-Saxon moneyer did not work for &Oacute;l&aacute;f any more than he did for Swein Forkbeard or Olof Sk&ouml;tkonung, king of Sweden, on whose coins his name also appears: the three kings simply imitated the same Anglo-Saxon coin type.<br>
<br>Whatever its character &Oacute;l&aacute;f's rule was too brief to leave permanent traces. He was killed fighting against Swein Forkbeard and Olof Sk&ouml;tkonung at the battle of Svold in 999 (a more probable date than the traditional 1000). According to legend he jumped into the sea from his ship, the <i>Long Serpent</i>, when the battle was lost, in order not to fall into the hands of his enemies. Danish overlordship over Norway was re-established until challenged by King &Oacute;l&aacute;f Haraldsson (<i>d</i>. 1029).<br>
