<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Garson,  (Eileen Evelyn) Greer</span>  (1904&#150;1996), <span class="occ">film actress</span>, was born on 29 September 1904 at 88 First Avenue, Manor Park, Essex, the daughter of George Garson (1865&#150;1906), a commercial clerk, and his wife, Nancy Sophia (Nina), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Greer (<i>d</i>. 1958), who claimed descent from Rob Roy McGregor. Her father died when she was two and as her mother was preoccupied with managing a row of inherited townhouses the sickly child spent much time in the care of her aunt, Alexina Logie, and her maternal grandparents in Castlewellan, northern Ireland; hence the popular misconception that she was Irish. Always a loner at both Essex Road elementary school and East Ham secondary school, she entered the University of London in 1921 after her mother refused her permission to apply for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. She considered herself &#145;The Girl Least Likely to Succeed&#146;  (Troyan, 3), although she was listed in a college yearbook as &#145;a unique blend of La Belle Dame Sans Merci and Goldilocks&#146;  (ibid., 19). An academic career seemed likely until she began acting in amateur productions while studying at the University of Grenoble.<br>
<br>After a spell working in Lever Brothers' advertising department Garson made her professional stage d&eacute;but in the Birmingham Repertory production of Elmer Rice's <span class="italic">Street Scene</span> on 30 January 1932. She was billed as Greer Garson for the first time in George Bernard Shaw's <span class="italic">Too True to be Good</span> at the New Theatre, London, in September 1932, stirring the playwright to opine she would be &#145;the new Ellen Terry! Never leave the theatre. I shall be very disappointed indeed if you go to Hollywood to work with magic lanterns&#146;  (Troyan, 30). On 28 September 1933 she married Edward Alec Abbott Snelson (1904&#150;1992), then a junior judge in India, only to realize on honeymoon that she had made a mistake. (The marriage ended in divorce in 1940.) Remaining in London, she continued to act, finally making her name opposite Laurence Olivier in Sylvia Thompson's <span class="italic">The Golden Arrow</span> (1935). Despite being of the opinion &#145;she is so piss-elegant that it hurts. Too mannered. Too old. Too tall. And her voice is too deep&#146;  (ibid., 51), No&euml;l Coward offered her the lead in <span class="italic">Mademoiselle</span> in 1936 and prevented her from accepting Douglas Fairbanks Jr's offer of a film contract.<br>
<br>Garson broke into television with <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> in May 1937, becoming the medium's highest-paid star when she earned about &pound;100 to appear in <span class="italic">How she Lied to her Husband</span> that July. But it was Hollywood that beckoned, after MGM boss Louis B. Mayer saw her in Keith Winter's <span class="italic">Old Music</span> at the St James's Theatre in August 1937. An instant fan, he later wrote: &#145;if she were a man, she could be prime minister of England&#146;  (Troyan, 367). Yet she refused the many supporting roles Mayer suggested, before finally agreeing to play Kathie in <span class="italic">Goodbye, Mr Chips</span> (1939), a performance that brought her an Oscar nomination and prompted <span class="italic">Time</span> magazine to describe her as &#145;a goddess sculptured in butterscotch&#146;  (ibid., 169). A spinal injury sustained in a riding accident caused MGM to cancel her contract, but it was swiftly restored after she received the nomination.<br>
<br>A reunion with Olivier in <span class="italic">Pride and Prejudice</span> (1940) was followed by a second Oscar nomination for <span class="italic">Blossoms in the Dust</span> (1941). Yet it was the lead in <span class="italic">Mrs Miniver</span> (1942) that secured the Garson legend. Winston Churchill considered her performance as a village housewife surviving the blitz to be worth more than six divisions, while Queen Elizabeth thanked her for making &#145;us feel more brave than we actually were&#146;  (Troyan, 1). Greer Garson dolls sold healthily, and she was voted &#145;the woman we'd like to spend the rest of our lives in the nose of a bomber with&#146;  (ibid., 151) by British troops. An Oscar duly followed, only for her to gain an unwanted place in the award's history by giving the longest-ever acceptance speech, at an unscripted five and a half minutes. <span class="italic">Miniver</span> had other consequences, including an introduction to her second husband, the actor Richard Ney, whom she married on 24 July 1943. Moreover, it established her screen partnership with Walter Pidgeon, with whom she would co-star in a further seven features, landing Oscar nominations for <span class="italic">Madame Curie</span> (1943) and <span class="italic">Mrs Parkington</span> (1944).<br>
<br>Further performances in <span class="italic">Random Harvest</span> (1942) and <span class="italic">The Valley of Decision</span> (1945), for the latter of which she was again nominated for an Oscar, reinforced Garson's reputation as a statuesque sophisticate whose red hair betrayed a deeper passion. Yet she was keen to debunk this wholesome image and nicknamed herself &#145;the walking cathedral&#146; and &#145;Metro's Golden Mare&#146;  (Troyan, 176). She longed to do comedy or play a villain, but instead found herself saddled with Clark Gable's post-war return to movies, <span class="italic">Adventure</span> (1945), which bore the grisly advertising slogan &#145;Gable's Back and Garson's Got Him&#146;&#151;although this was infinitely preferable to the alternative, &#145;Gable Puts the Arson in Garson&#146;  (ibid., 194).<br>
<br>The disappointing box-office showing of <span class="italic">The Miniver Story</span> (1949) convinced MGM that Garson's star was waning. Moreover, her second marriage having ended in divorce in 1947, on 15 July 1949 she married the Texan oil billionaire Colonel Elizah E. (Buddy) Fogelson (1908&#150;1987), and became more interested in cattle, with her &#145;white short-horned Greers&#146; becoming a prize-winning crossbreed. She also later successfully bred racehorses. Disillusioned with the new MGM regime of Dore Schary, she left the studio in 1954. Few of her freelance films were worthy of her talent, although she did draw her seventh Oscar nomination for playing Eleanor Roosevelt in <span class="italic">Sunrise at Campobello</span> (1960). Taking only occasional stage and television assignments, she retired after starring in <span class="italic">The Madwoman of Chaillot</span>, at the Greer Garson Theatre, Santa Fe, in June 1975. Poor health dogged her following a heart attack in 1980 and she lived quietly in Dallas until her death, at the Dallas Presbyterian Hospital, from congestive heart failure, on 6 April 1996. She was buried at the Sparkman Hillcrest Memorial Park, Dallas, on 9 April. She was survived by a stepson from her third marriage. She had been appointed honorary CBE in 1993.<br>
