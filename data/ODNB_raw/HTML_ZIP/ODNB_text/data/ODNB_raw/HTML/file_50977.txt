<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Home,  William  Douglas</span>  (1912&#150;1992), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born on 3 June 1912 at 23 Moray Place, Edinburgh, the third son and fifth of the seven children of Charles Cospatrick Archibald Douglas-Home, Lord Dunglass, later thirteenth earl of Home (1873&#150;1951), and his wife, Lady Lilian (1881&#150;1966), daughter of Frederick William Lambton, fourth earl of Durham. After an infancy spent at the ancestral homes of the Hirsel, near Coldstream, Berwickshire, and Douglas Castle, Lanarkshire, Will disliked going to Ludgrove School in Hertfordshire in 1921. He was a shy nervous child who learned to hide behind a mask of flippancy. His characteristic mode of speech would later be a light, allusive banter, accompanied by whimsical half-smiles. He became a teller of anecdotes and also the subject of them, emerging as a practical joker at Eton College (1926&#150;31) and New College, Oxford (1931&#150;4).<br>
<br>On leaving university with a fourth in history, the Hon. William Douglas Home&#151;he dispensed with the hyphen&#151;spent two years at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London before making his stage d&eacute;but in Brighton in 1937. He looked an acceptable leading man, with his slender build, high brow, straight nose, and small eyes, but his acting ability was insufficient to launch a career. In any case writing interested him more. His first full-length play, <span class="italic">Great Possessions</span>, appeared at the Q Theatre in London in March 1937. Subsidized by his father, he shared a flat in South Eaton Place with his friends Jo Grimond and Brian Johnston.<br>
<br>Having been an idealistic supporter of appeasement, Douglas Home helped Kenneth de Courcy produce <span class="italic">Intelligence Digest</span> in 1939&#150;40, a newsletter that some deemed defeatist. Douglas Home described himself as 99 per cent pacifist, yet, when drafted into the Royal East Kent regiment (the Buffs) in July 1940, he went on to serve as a second lieutenant in what became the Royal Armoured Corps. However, the Second World War brought out his stubborn and opinionated side. Douglas Home contested three parliamentary by-elections between 1942 and 1944 as an Independent Progressive, denouncing Churchill's objective of unconditional German surrender. He then refused in September 1944 to participate in the assault on Le Havre after the allies turned down a German request for a ceasefire to allow civilian evacuation. When Acting-Captain Douglas Home publicized this in the press, he was court-martialled and sentenced to a year's hard labour, first at Wormwood Scrubs and then at Wakefield. He defended his conduct ever after, though his eventual appeal for a review of the case failed in 1991. Will was not simply a charming jester.<br>
<br>On his release in June 1945 Douglas Home wrote <span class="italic">Now Barabbas &hellip;</span>, a compassionate prison drama which made his name as a playwright when it opened in London in February 1947. This was followed at the Vaudeville Theatre in August 1947 by another hit, more typical of subsequent ones. <span class="italic">The Chiltern Hundreds</span> exploited the comic potential of an upper-class socialist facing the family butler as his tory opponent in a by-election. Douglas Home based the benignly eccentric aristocrats on his own relations. Thoroughly good-humoured, with easy conversational dialogue, the piece gave rise to a film, an American version, and two sequels. His next few plays fared less well, however; audiences booed the anti-war fantasy <span class="italic">Ambassador Extraordinary</span> (1948).<br>
<br>In 1950 Douglas Home was Conservative prospective parliamentary candidate for Kirkcaldy Burghs, but only briefly: he opposed the Korean War. Grimond later induced him to contest Edinburgh South as a Liberal in 1957 and 1959. On 26 July 1951 Douglas Home married Rachel Leila Brand (<i>b</i>. 1929); she succeeded as Baroness Dacre in 1970. They had one son and three daughters and lived for thirty years (1954&#150;85) at Drayton House, East Meon, Hampshire.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Reluctant Debutante</span>, a polished light comedy, proved highly popular at the Cambridge Theatre, London, where it received 752 performances (1955&#150;6), with Wilfrid Hyde White, Celia Johnson, and Anna Massey, prior to success on Broadway and on film. Then came the backlash: drama critics, exhilarated by John Osborne's <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span> (1956), suddenly turned Douglas Home into an Aunt Sally who symbolized everything snobbish, out-of-date, and shallow in British theatre. Kenneth Tynan, especially, aimed to drive &#145;the Honourable William&#146; off the stage. Douglas Home held out doggedly against the &#145;new wave&#146; of social realism. His <span class="italic">Aunt Edwina</span> (1959) made fun of a retired colonel changing sex after mistakenly taking equine hormone pills. Incensed by vitriolic reviews, the author backed it with his own money and lost.<br>
<br>Douglas Home's dramatic range was broader than many allowed. He wrote serious works on contemporary moral themes (though maybe not very effectively), topical skits, and a string of plays about historical figures, such as <span class="italic">The Thistle and the Rose</span> (King James IV of Scotland) in 1949, <span class="italic">Caro William</span> (Melbourne) in 1952, <span class="italic">Betzi</span> (Napoleon) in 1965, and <span class="italic">The Queen's Highland Servant</span> (John Brown) in 1967. Nevertheless, he remained pigeon-holed as a purveyor of &#145;bourgeois&#146; drawing-room comedies. The mid-1960s were lean years. The appointment of his brother Sir Alec Douglas-Home (1903&#150;1995) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60455/', "Home, Alexander Frederick Douglas-")</script>] as prime minister ensured a fair London run for <span class="italic">The Reluctant Peer</span> (1964). Otherwise he had to retreat into the provinces, whence he contrived his comeback in 1967. <span class="italic">The Secretary Bird</span>, a comedy of marital infidelity, premi&egrave;red in Swanage, Dorset; it went on to achieve 1463 performances in the West End, showing impresarios that audiences and critics were not the same. Fresh commercial successes followed: <span class="italic">The Jockey Club Stakes</span> (1970), <span class="italic">Lloyd George Knew my Father</span> (1972), and <span class="italic">The Kingfisher</span> (1977). Actors of the calibre of Kenneth More, Alastair Sim, Rex Harrison, and Ralph Richardson starred in his shows.<br>
<br>Douglas Home was prolific, writing memoirs, verse, and magazine columns, as well as forty-five performed plays. Interest in his stage works slowly faded from the late 1970s, but they appeared at regional venues, in amateur productions, and in France (where they retained high critical esteem). Never financially prudent&#151;he was a lifelong devotee of the turf&#151;he felt obliged to take a smaller house in 1985, when heart trouble required the fitting of a pacemaker. Still he kept creating well-crafted new dramas; the last to be staged was <span class="italic">The Christmas Truce</span> (1989). William Douglas Home died at his home, Derry House, Kilmeston, near Alresford, Hampshire, on 28 September 1992. He was buried four days later in the churchyard of All Saints, East Meon, Hampshire.<br>
