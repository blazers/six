<span class="headword">Vaughan,  William</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1716, <em>d.</em> in or after 1780), <span class="occ">army officer in the Jacobite and Spanish service</span>, was the third son of John Vaughan (1675&#150;1752) of Courtfield, near Ross, Herefordshire, and his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Philip Jones of Llan-arth Fawr, Monmouthshire. Both families were recusant. After the landing of Prince Charles Edward, the Young Pretender, in Scotland in 1745, William Vaughan left Monmouthshire for the north, in the company of David Morgan (executed for high treason, 30 July 1746), who &#145;seldom kept company with any Gentleman of his Neighbourhood&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete History of the Trials of the Rebels</span>, quoted in Blaikie, <span class="italic">Origins</span>, 172), and Francis Townley, of Towneley Hall. They joined the prince's army at Preston on 27 November, with &#145;some few common people, but no numbers as was expected&#146;  (Blaikie, <span class="italic">Itinerary</span>, 28). Vaughan was at first attached to the prince's life-guards, but subsequently served as lieutenant-colonel in the Manchester regiment. He was present at Culloden, but succeeded in effecting his escape into France. His name was included on a list of rebels guilty of treason (22 May 1747), and he was later excepted from the general act of pardon.<br>
<br>Early in 1747 Vaughan accompanied Prince Charles on his journey from Paris to Madrid, and on Charles's recommendation was admitted into the Spanish service, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, in the regiment called Hibernia. In this he served over twenty-nine years, attaining in December 1773 the rank of major-general. On 26 October 1777 he was appointed <i>mariscal de campo</i>, or &#145;major-general&#146;, of the royal armies, but towards the end of 1778 he joined the Spanish expedition to Buenos Aires. He is last mentioned in the Spanish records under the date of 29 March 1780 as being nominated to serve with the troops under the general command of Don Vittoria de Navia. He probably died soon after.<br>
<br>Vaughan's elder brother, Richard (<i>b</i>. 1708), the second son, also took part in the Jacobite rising, joined the duke of Perth's division, and was also present at Culloden. He was indicted, by Justice Henry Fielding of Bow Street, for forging English banknotes. He also subsequently entered the Spanish service, and died in that country, having married a Spanish lady, Do&ntilde;a Francesca, with whom he had a daughter, Elizabeth (who married the count of Kilmallock, colonel in the Spanish service), and a son, William (1740&#150;1796), who succeeded to the Courtfield estate, and continued the line, Cardinal Vaughan and Roger William Vaughan, Roman Catholic archbishop of Sydney, being his great-grandsons.<br>
