<span class="headword">Waterston,  John James</span>  (1811&#150;1883), <span class="occ">physicist and physical chemist</span>, was born in 1811 in Edinburgh, the sixth of nine children, at least five of them sons, of George Waterston, a manufacturer of sealing-wax and stationery requisites, of Edinburgh, and his wife, Jane Blair of Dunkeld. He was educated at Edinburgh high school, was a pupil in a firm of civil engineers, and attended lectures at the university in mathematics, physics, and other subjects.<br>
<br>At the age of twenty-one Waterston moved to London, working briefly as a civil engineer before joining the Admiralty hydrographer's department. From 1839 he worked as a naval instructor in Bombay, which left him time for his main interest, the study of science. Waterston's ideas were advanced but, being outside the scientific establishment, he was not always taken seriously. His theory of the meteoric bombardment as the source of the sun's heat was, through its being taken up by William Thomson, quite influential for a short time. His most significant paper, in which he developed much of the kinetic theory of gases, was refused publication by the Royal Society in 1845. Some years later better-known physicists developed similar ideas, which gained acceptance rapidly. Waterston, never interested in personal glory, did not try to claim priority, but J. W. Strutt, third Baron Rayleigh, rediscovered the paper and had it published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> in 1892, with an introduction which belatedly gave Waterston due credit. Between 1845 and 1868 Waterston published papers in various journals, on the nature of heat, the behaviour of gases and liquids, related chemical topics, and on astronomical matters. Other of his papers, however, were rejected.<br>
<br>In 1857 Waterston returned to Edinburgh to live an agreeable bachelor life among his family and friends. Through his family he was closely connected with the Sandemanian church but he does not seem to have been a member. On 18 June 1883 he left his lodgings and disappeared. It is surmised that he fell into the sea near Leith, perhaps overcome by the giddiness to which he was prone following an attack of sunstroke in India.<br>
