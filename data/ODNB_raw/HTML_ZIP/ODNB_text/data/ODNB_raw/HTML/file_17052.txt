<span class="headword">Lovel,  Philip</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1258), <span class="occ">administrator and royal councillor</span>, was a kinsman of the Lovels of Minster Lovell in Oxfordshire, perhaps a younger son of William Lovel (<i>d</i>. 1213); the kinship is proved by the fact that the manor of Snorscomb, Northamptonshire, in Philip's possession in 1257, passed after his death to John Lovel the justice, an illegitimate son of John Lovel of Minster Lovell (<i>d</i>. 1287). Before entering the church Philip Lovel had married and fathered at least three children. He first appears in 1223, as witness to a grant of property in Blewbury, Berkshire, involving Richard Poore, bishop of Salisbury (<i>d</i>. 1237), and had been ordained subdeacon by 1231/2, when he was presented to the living of Lutterworth in Leicestershire by Nicholas de Verdun. The Verduns were subtenants of the earls of Winchester, and it may have been through his Verdun connection that Lovel entered the service of Roger de Quincy, earl of Winchester, lord of Galloway, and constable of Scotland (<i>d</i>. 1264). He witnessed Earl Roger's charters from before 1240, and rose to become the earl's steward for his English estates, earning the favour of the Scottish royal family. In 1246/7 he obtained promotion to the church of Hanslope at the presentation of William Mauduit, chamberlain of the English royal exchequer, which suggests that he was already active on the fringes of the court. By the time of his death, he was also rector of Stanground in Huntingdonshire, and of Rock in Worcestershire, and was a canon of London, with the prebends of Weldland (from <i>c</i>.1255) and (later) Islington.<br>
<br>By 1249 Lovel had entered court service and in November of that year, through the influence of John Mansel (<i>d</i>. 1265), was appointed a justice of the Jews. In 1250, styled clerk and counsellor of the king, he took the cross but did not go on crusade. At Michaelmas next year he was accused of taking bribes from various wealthy Jews of the north of England, in return for a reduction in their liability for tallage, allegations which the chroniclers suggest were inspired by the personal rivalry of Robert de la Ho, another of the justices of the Jews. Lovel was briefly disgraced, but on offering a fine of 10 marks of gold, and through the mediation of John Mansel and Alexander III of Scotland, he recovered the king's favour. On 27 August 1252 he was appointed treasurer of the royal exchequer, again through Mansel's advice, and in 1255 he was appointed to an inquiry into the king's revenues and rights in eight midland counties, an inquiry he is said to have conducted with great harshness. In 1257 Henry III unsuccessfully petitioned the monks of Coventry to elect Lovel as their bishop. His years as treasurer coincided with a crisis in royal finance, resulting in the levying of forced loans, harsh exploitation of Jewish debt, and a great increase in the sums demanded from the king's sheriffs. In the early stages of the baronial reform movement Lovel was allowed to retain his offices, but in October 1258 he was arraigned on a series of trumped-up charges relating to his infringement of forest law, and on 2 November 1258 he was replaced as treasurer by a candidate more acceptable to the baronial council. He was handed over to the keeping of the earl marshal, but released on the payment of large sums of money. He retired to his rectory of Hanslope, where he died on 29 December 1258, through vexation at the king's refusal of reconciliation, according to Matthew Paris. His estates at Little Brickhill in Buckinghamshire, Littlebury in Essex, Dunton in Warwickshire, and Snorscomb in Northamptonshire, for the most part acquired by purchase after 1252, were seized by the crown, but were eventually divided between his kinsman John and his own three children, Philip the younger, Amicia, the wife of Richard de Curzon of Derbyshire, and Master Henry Lovel, a clerk who served as his father's executor.<br>
