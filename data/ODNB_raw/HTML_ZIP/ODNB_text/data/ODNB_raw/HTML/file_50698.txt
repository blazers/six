<span class="headword">Hudson,  John</span>  (1795&#150;1869), <span class="occ">agriculturist</span>, was born at Grimston, Norfolk; little is known about his early life, but in 1822 he and his father took on the tenancy of Lodge Farm (788 acres) and of Manor (or Lower) Farm (653 acres), at Castle Acre, Norfolk, from Thomas William Coke of Holkham. He soon became a leading figure in the second generation of improving farmers on the Holkham estate.<br>
<br>1822 was a time of agricultural depression and the previous tenant of Lodge Farm (Mr Purdey) had sold up for the benefit of creditors in that year. The farms were said to be in poor condition and had been refused by three previous prospective tenants. Yields were no more than 20 bushels of wheat and 24 bushels of barley per acre. The root crops grown had not enabled the outgoing tenant of Lodge Farm to winter more than 10 bullocks  (Jenkins, 460&#150;74).<br>
<br>The background of the Hudsons is obscure, but they must have had plenty of capital. This they immediately put to use in improving the farms. According to the 1851 census John's wife, Anne Rebecca, was three years his junior and born in Warham, Norfolk, possibly the daughter of a Holkham tenant there. The Revd Armstrong, writing in 1856, described Hudson as a &#145;princely yeoman of Norfolk&#146; and was told that he had been a postilion to Mr Hammard (landowner of West Acre, Norfolk), &#145;in which capacity he had saved &pound;100. He married a widow of Lynn by whom he had accession to a fortune, became Lord Leicester's tenant at Castle Acre and is now worth &pound;100,000&#146;  (Armstrong, 63). Hudson managed both farms until his father's death in 1840. Manor Farm was then run by executors until his son, Thomas, took over in 1857; Thomas Hudson remained there until his death in 1903.<br>
<br>John Hudson's immediate task in 1822 was to improve the fertility of the farms, which he undertook in two ways. First he followed the traditional method of increasing stocking rates to produce more manure, which involved the expenditure of between &pound;2000 and &pound;3000 per annum on oil cake and other artificial feeds. He thus doubled the number of animals kept and claimed that by feeding sliced turnips and oil cake to his sheep in the fields he had increased the output of the land by a third. By 1850 there were 2500 sheep and 150 bullocks on the two farms; in 1822 there had been only 400 sheep and 40 bullocks. Second, he spent &pound;800 to &pound;1000 per annum on the new artificial manures such as superphosphates and guano. As a result of this extremely high investment he claimed that the barley crop had nearly doubled. In 1843 he told R. N. Bacon, author of <span class="italic">The Agriculture of Norfolk</span>, published that year, that &#145;with more capital and more skill, this country might be an exporting rather than importing country&#146;  (Norfolk RO, MS 4363).<br>
<br>In spite of the large quantities of artificial fertilizers being used, Hudson preferred to farm by the four-course rotation system which he was said to practise &#145;with the greatest skill and liberality&#146;  (Jenkins, 460&#150;74). William Keary, the Holkham agent, noted in 1851 that the farm was almost weed-free and &#145;that such lands produce this enormous bulk of roots and corn is truly astonishing and proves indisputably the high condition of the farm and the skill of the tenant&#146;  (Holkham MS, Keary's report).<br>
<br>Hudson was also interested in mechanization. By 1843 he had erected a steam engine to drive a threshing machine and grind oil cake. Such machines were unusual in Norfolk, a county far away from coal supplies and where cheap labour was plentiful. By 1850 he had two steam engines on his farm, one stationary and one portable, as well as one threshing machine worked by horsepower. In 1866 he bought his own steam plough to overcome the need to hire steam tackle  (Jenkins).<br>
<br>It was Hudson's methods of &#145;high farming&#146; and his enthusiasm for and promotion of this high-input, high-output system that made him famous. By 1842 he was a member of the recently formed Royal Agricultural Society of England and at that time he was portrayed in a painting of the society's meeting at Bristol. In 1850 he wrote an essay for the Royal Agricultural Society's farm prize competition and it was published that year. In it he described himself as having spent &#145;a life devoted to practical farming&#146;  (Hudson, 282&#150;7). He was in addition the first chairman of the Farmers' Club in London in 1842&#150;3, and a member of the club's tenants' rights committee in 1846.<br>
<br>Hudson died on 26 July 1869 at The Beeches, Cirencester, Gloucestershire. He was survived by his wife. An obituary in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society</span> described him as &#145;one of the first exponents and chief illustrators of the principles and practice of high farming&#146;. Lodge Farm was then run by executors until 1878, when it was re-let.<br>
