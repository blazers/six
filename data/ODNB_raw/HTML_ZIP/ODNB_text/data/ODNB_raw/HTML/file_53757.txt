<span class="headword">Dinizulu <span class="st"> [Dinuzulu]</span> ka Cetshwayo</span>  (1868&#150;1913), <span class="occ">Zulu king</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39590/', "Cetshwayo ka Mpande (c.1826&#150;1884)")</script> and his senior wife, Novimbi Msweli, and thus the heir apparent to the Zulu kingship. Aged five, in 1873 he witnessed his father's coronation by Theophilus Shepstone. In 1879 British forces invaded and conquered the Zulu kingdom, defeating Cetshwayo's forces. Cetshwayo was exiled, and the kingdom was divided into thirteen kingdoms. Dinizulu was left in the area assigned to the Mandhlakazi chief, Zibhebu, who had quarrelled with Cetshwayo and was hostile to his Usuthu faction. Dinizulu was briefly reunited with his father when in 1883 Cetshwayo was restored to a truncated kingdom shorn of a large reserve on the Natal border and another area in the north set aside for the renegade Zibhebu. The ensuing civil war (a direct consequence of the British policy of causing dissension among the Zulu), Zibhebu's victory over the Usuthu, and Cetshwayo's flight and death in 1884 left Dinizulu in mortal danger. As Zibhebu's forces ravaged the kingdom's heartland, Dinizulu was hidden by Ndabuko in the fastnesses of the Nkandla Forest.<br>
<br>The Usuthu petitioned the British to install Dinizulu as king and to restore order, but there was official reluctance to reinstate the Zulu kingdom. As many of the Usuthu were reduced to starvation by Zibhebu's raiding, Usuthu leaders negotiated with a committee of Transvaal Boers, who offered to install Dinizulu as paramount chief in return for land on which to establish a so-called New Republic. On 22 May 1884 the Boers proclaimed Dinizulu king. They then supported the Usuthu forces in attacking and routing Zibhebu; in return, however, they claimed almost the entire Zulu heartland, right down to the coast. In response to Zulu pleas, growing anarchy, and their own hostility to Boer expansionism, the British intervened, acknowledging the New Republic within greatly restricted boundaries; it was shortly afterwards amalgamated with Transvaal. The rest of the Zulu territory was annexed and placed under direct crown rule on 14 May 1887.<br>
<br>Informed that his kingship was abolished, and enraged by the reinstatement of Zibhebu as a chief by the British, Dinizulu put himself at the head of an uprising. His forces successfully attacked Zibhebu, but were broken up by British troops on 2 July 1888. Dinizulu then fled to Transvaal, but was persuaded by the missionary and Zulu sympathizer Harriette Colenso to travel to Bishopstowe, the Colenso family home in Natal, where he surrendered to the British. He was convicted of treason, and was exiled to the island of St Helena. There, allowed considerable freedom, he learned to read and write, and to play the American organ. In 1898 he was freed and allowed to return to Zululand, no longer as king but as &#145;government <i>Induna</i>&#146; (local headman), a role which recognized the authority he still held in the eyes of many Zulu. He was also installed as chief of the core of the Usuthu faction, which was now constituted by the British administration as a tribe with a defined territory. Before his return, however, Zululand had been handed over to Natal; the authorities in the territory were thus responsible to a legislature elected exclusively by white men, who had a direct interest in exploiting its resources of land and labour. Dinizulu found his central role deeply frustrating. He had little opportunity to influence legislation or administrative policy in the interests of his people. His function was rather to justify government policy to his tribe, a role which threatened to destroy the widespread loyalty and respect he still enjoyed. He thus spent most of his time in his local chiefdom at Osuthu, using it as a base to maintain and extend his personal authority and links among the Zulu at large. He married wives from the leading lineage groups of the previous kingdom, dispatched messengers to the headquarters of its constituent chiefdoms, and received visits from their leading men.<br>
<br>By the early years of the twentieth century, changes in the South African economy and policies of the Natal government conspired to raise tensions in Natal and Zululand, which made Dinizulu's position increasingly difficult. The crown, absentee landlords, and land companies could now more profitably sell or lease land to white capitalist farmers than to African tenants. Many African tenants were forced off the land and the rents of those who remained were raised. Their struggle to maintain economic independence became increasingly difficult. In 1902 the Natal government tightened the squeeze by making substantial areas of Zululand available to white farmers, confining the Zulu to defined reserves in the heartland of their old kingdom. Finally, in 1906, taxes on Africans in Natal and Zululand were substantially raised by the introduction of a poll tax. Attempts to collect the tax met with a number of instances of resistance. Bambatha, chief of the Zondi in Natal, was involuntarily involved in one of these attempts, and, accompanied by a wife and two children, sought asylum at Osuthu. Anxious not to offend the government, or to undermine his standing with his own people, Dinizulu sent Bambatha back to Natal but allowed his wife and children to stay. On his return, Bambatha found that he had been deposed in favour of an uncle, and at once attacked him, initiating a rebellion. To strengthen his support, he claimed that Dinizulu had authorized his attack, and given him charms which would turn bullets into water. The rebellion spread, and proved difficult and costly to suppress. To prove his own loyalty to the government, Dinizulu offered to send all his forces to assist against Bambatha; but in the later stages of the rebellion he allowed some of the rebels who fled to Osuthu to remain there, rather than hand them over to the authorities.<br>
<br>On these grounds, and on suspicion of his involvement in the murder of some pro-government chiefs, Dinizulu's arrest was ordered. Once again on the advice of Harriette Colenso he surrendered himself. Through the efforts of the Colensos and their friends, his defence was undertaken by the former liberal premier of Cape Colony W. P. Schreiner. Although the presiding judge remarked that his actions had not been motivated by any hostile intention against the state, Dinizulu was convicted of treason for harbouring rebels, and sentenced to four years' imprisonment. On the inauguration of the South African Union in 1910, however, its first prime minister, Louis Botha (who had been involved in the Boer expedition to put Dinizulu on the throne in 1884), released him. Dinizulu settled on a farm in Transvaal, but his health had long been poor, and he died there on 18 October 1913.<br>
<br>Dinizulu's lifelong commitment to maintaining the Zulu kingship had tragic consequences for his people as well as for himself. It facilitated the annexation by Transvaal of a large part of the Zulu kingdom, precipitated direct British rule, and assisted the formal extinction of the kingdom and its incorporation into white settler-ruled Natal. It did, however, keep the idea of the kingdom alive in the minds of the Zulu people and of white administrators and politicians, with profound consequences for the future.<br>
