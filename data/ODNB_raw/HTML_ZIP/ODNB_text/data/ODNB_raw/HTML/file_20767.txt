<span class="headword">O'Neill,  Conn  Bacach</span>, first earl of Tyrone  (<em>c.</em>1482&#150;1559), <span class="occ">chieftain and magnate</span>, was the youngest son of Conn More O'Neill (<i>d</i>. 1493), chieftain, lord of Tyrone, and his wife, Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1497), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9585/', "Thomas Fitzgerald, seventh earl of Kildare")</script>, and his wife, Joan. Rival O'Neill factions had been fighting for decades to exert control over Tyrone, the unwieldy O'Neill lordship which stretched across much of Ulster. Conn More's marriage to Eleanor Fitzgerald in 1480 secured for him a powerful ally in Kildare and prompted the Irish parliament to recognize Conn More and his issue as English subjects. Subsequently the earls of Kildare intervened periodically in O'Neill politics to install candidates more sympathetic to their position. Following the death in 1519 of his elder brother Art Oge O'Neill, Conn Bacach (&#145;the lame&#146;), supported by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9555/', "Gerald Fitzgerald, ninth earl of Kildare (1487&#150;1534)")</script>, succeeded to the chieftaincy. He subsequently married his cousin Alice, fourth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9554/', "Gerald Fitzgerald, eighth earl of Kildare")</script>, cementing an alliance with the Geraldines.<h2>
<a name="LordofTyrone15191534"></a>Lord of Tyrone, 1519&#150;1534</h2>Conn's accession, however, had not gone unopposed; the sons of Art Oge O'Neill, led by Niall Conallach (<i>d</i>. 1544), allied with the neighbouring O'Donnells, who were receptive to any interest capable of destabilizing the O'Neill lordship, mounted consistent opposition. The replacement of the ninth earl of Kildare as lord lieutenant by Thomas Howard, earl of Surrey, in 1520 prompted Conn to threaten the pale's northern marches. However, the O'Donnell&#150;O'Neill alliance &#145;behind&#146; Tyrone raised the prospect of a two-front war as Surrey marched northwards. In a letter to Conn, John Kite, archbishop of Armagh, urged that he:<blockquote>should cultivate a mind worthy of your abilities and character, and no longer take delight in wild and barbarous manners &hellip; It is much better to live in a civilized fashion, than to seek a living by arms and rapine, and to have no thought beyond pleasure and the belly. (Brewer and Bullen, 1515&#150;74, no. 8)</blockquote>Conn submitted and Henry VIII, eager to win his allegiance inexpensively, sent him gifts and authorized Surrey to grant him a knighthood and to induce him to repair to court. Conn, however, could not offer the lord lieutenant, or the king, his full attention while Sir Hugh O'Donnell threatened, and in summer 1522 he invaded Tyrconnell.<br>
<br>Rumours of Conn's alliance with Colin Campbell, third earl of Argyll, in summer 1521 caused consternation among English officials. Their fear was misplaced as Scottish aid represented only a part of a greater confederacy formed by Conn to crush O'Donnell the following year. Conn brought to the field an impressive array of preponderantly Gaelic clans from across Ireland in what was a battle to confirm traditional O'Neill hegemony in Ulster. After several initial successes, however, the greatly outnumbered forces of O'Donnell inflicted a sharp defeat on Conn at Cnoc Buidhbh near Strabane, in Tyrone, in mid-August 1522. The confederacy disintegrated; and though fighting between Conn and O'Donnell continued intermittently for the rest of the decade, neither could secure a decisive advantage. With his ambitions in Ulster cooled, Conn concentrated on his alliance with his brother-in-law the newly restored ninth earl of Kildare, attending his installation in 1524: &#145;and so O'Neill, being in the council house with them, bare the sword before the deputy till they went to Thomas Court and there dined, and after dinner had a goodly banquet&#146;  (TCD, MS 543/2, s.a. 1524). He subsequently accompanied Kildare on a hosting against O'Donnell, and in 1526 attended a council held by him in Dublin. This close association with Kildare continued despite Conn's marriage to Sorcha (<i>d</i>. 1530), daughter of Hugh Oge O'Neill, chief of the Clandeboye O'Neills; among their children was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20785/', "Shane O'Neill (c.1530&#150;1567)")</script>.<br>
<br>During Kildare's absence at court, Conn did his best to obstruct the stop-gap government of Richard Nugent, third Baron Delvin, which had superseded that of Kildare's brother Sir Thomas Fitzgerald of Leixlip. In May 1528 Conn complained to Cardinal Thomas Wolsey that Delvin withheld his traditional blackrent and requested Kildare's return. Sir William Skeffington, however, was appointed lord deputy on 22 June 1530. In an effort to demonstrate his loyalty, Kildare accompanied Skeffington on a campaign against Conn in 1531. The campaign, carried out with the assistance of both the O'Donnells and the rival O'Neill faction, dealt Conn a devastating blow. The following year the weakened O'Neills underwent a second assault that saw their enemies penetrate the heart of Tyrone. The annals of Ulster note:&#145;do impoadur Gaidhil Letha Cuind uile ar &Oacute; Neill 'munn am sa, achtmadh becc&#146; (&#145;the Gaidhil of all the half of Conn, except a few, turned on O'Neill about that time&#146;; Hennessy and MacCarthy, vol. 3, s.a. 1532). However, Conn's chieftaincy survived the onslaught. Kildare's restoration in 1532 ushered in more peaceful conditions which allowed Conn to re-establish his power base.<h2>
<a name="Rebel15341542"></a>Rebel, 1534&#150;1542</h2>Like many Kildare clients Conn initially supported the rebellion of Thomas Fitzgerald, Baron Offaly, in 1534, but abandoned the Geraldines as the rebellion faltered. In July 1535 he entered into a detailed submission with Skeffington at Drogheda. The terms of submission were renewed the following year, although the new lord deputy, Leonard Grey, Viscount Graney, complained of Conn's refusal to give hostages. Unable to predict the government's future alignment in the wake of the rebellion of Offaly, now tenth earl of Kildare, and weakened by the invasions of 1531&#150;2, Conn doubtless hoped to secure his lands and position through formal submission. He had also been engaged in a <i>rapprochement</i> with certain O'Donnells since 1535. Sir Hugh O'Donnell's son Manus was particularly receptive to Conn's overtures and their friendship grew into a solid alliance. Shortly before 29 November 1538 Conn married Mary (<i>d</i>. in or after 1560), daughter of Alexander MacRandal Boy MacDonald. By 1539 Graney's aggressive behaviour prompted Conn and Manus O'Donnell to form a confederacy against the government, the so-called Geraldine league, whose nominal aim was Kildare's restoration. They were encouraged by Conn's receipt of a letter from Paul III in June, which revoked the bull <span class="italic">Laudabiliter</span> and styled Conn &#145;King of Our Realme of Ireland&#146;. Conn and O'Donnell invaded Meath in August, but failed to press their advantage and on their return to Ulster were routed by Graney at Bellahoe, on the border of Meath and co. Monaghan. This rare mustering of Gaelic strength was a worrying development for the government and demanded a change of tack. Graney was replaced by Sir Anthony St Leger, who shortly after his arrival in August 1540 embarked on a markedly more conciliatory initiative to defuse the confederacy.<br>
<br>St Leger's conciliatory strategy succeeded gradually in detaching Conn's allies from the confederacy. Yet despite O'Donnell's submission in July 1541 and St Leger's diplomatic advances towards him in March and June 1541, Conn remained unmoved. Two campaigns launched into Tyrone that autumn also failed in securing his submission. A devastating third invasion launched in December left the already isolated Conn with little choice but to surrender unconditionally, condescending at last to offer his son as hostage for his loyalty. His submission marked the confederacy's end and exercised a profound effect on powerful chiefs such as Murrough O'Brien, who subsequently consented to terms offered by St Leger. In January 1542 Conn acknowledged Henry VIII's laws and sovereignty, agreeing to renounce the pope and attend parliament. His submission was formalized at Drogheda on 29 May and the following month he attended St Leger's parliament at Trim. The king baulked at offering the earldom of Ulster, for which Conn petitioned, but offered instead the earldom of Tyrone. Conn accepted and, with his expenses borne by St Leger, afterwards repaired to England to submit formally to Henry.<h2>
<a name="EarlofTyrone15421559"></a>Earl of Tyrone, 1542&#150;1559</h2>Following his submission to Henry at Greenwich Palace on 24 September 1542, Conn was created earl of Tyrone for life on 1 October. The title was to revert to his illegitimate son and heir with Alison Kelly, Mathew (<i>d</i>. 1558), who was concurrently created baron of Dungannon. The significance of the occasion was not lost on St Leger, who reminded the privy council that: &#145;yt can not be knowen that ever any Oneile repaired in person before this in to England to any of his noble progenytours, but hitherto usurped to call them selffes Prynces of Ulster&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 3.417). Conn surrendered both his kingdom and his Gaelic title to the crown in exchange for an earldom, incurring the wrath of a Gaelic poet as a result: &#145;&Oacute; N&eacute;ill Oiligh is Eamhna, r&iacute; Teamhrach agus Tailtean, tugsad ar iarlacht Uladh r&iacute;oghacht go humhal aimhghlic&#146; (&#145;O'Neill of Oileach and Eamhain (Macha), the king of Tara and Tailte, has exchanged in foolish submission his kingship for the Ulster earldom&#146;; &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, 273). The promise of immediate stability and hereditary succession, however, doubtless appealed to Conn, whose tanist, prior to the indenture, was his rival Niall Conallach. With the succession assured and his enemies outmanoeuvred, Tyrone returned to Ireland.<br>
<br>On 7 May 1543 Tyrone was admitted to the Irish privy council and received a grant of lands in Dublin on 9 July. He subsequently set about reaffirming his traditional suzerainty in Ulster both by bringing pressure to bear upon lesser Ulster chiefs and by rekindling hostilities with O'Donnell. His neighbours, however, had very different expectations from St Leger's negotiations: the former understood their tenurial independence, guaranteed by their respective submissions, as tantamount to exoneration from traditional obligations to Tyrone, while O'Donnell withheld payment for lands in the Inishowen peninsula from which the new earl had withdrawn his claim as part of his submission. Detailed judgement on the rights and status of lesser Ulster chiefs was postponed, but St Leger recognized the potential danger posed by an O'Neill&#150;O'Donnell feud at this juncture and brokered a mutually acceptable compromise, finalized by August 1545. Tyrone enjoyed relative stability in the following years, and in 1544&#150;5 he readily provided ninety kerne for the king's war with France and Scotland. Niall Conallach's death in 1544, moreover, removed any immediate internal threat to Tyrone's leadership.<br>
<br>The tanist's death, however, threatened a conflict between English and Gaelic succession laws. Dungannon, heir to the earldom, was indeed Tyrone's eldest son, but appears to have been illegitimate or a &#145;named&#146; son, born to the wife of a Dundalk blacksmith. Tyrone, a much married man, fathered many children. Four identifiable male children, however, were eligible for the chieftaincy under Gaelic law: Turlough, Brian, Conn, and Shane. Conflict was averted owing principally to Tyrone's strong presence and his continued support of Dungannon. But St Leger's recall and the more aggressive policies introduced by Edward VI's regime placed Tyrone's leadership under considerable strain. The deployment of an English garrison at Newry led to disputes between the earl and its captain, Nicholas Bagenal, who proceeded to raid Tyrone with impunity. The English, moreover, began assisting Dungannon against Tyrone in a premature succession dispute. In January 1551 Tyrone repaired to Dublin to seek redress from the Irish privy council, but Andrew Brereton, constable in Lecale, accused him of complicity with the French. He returned home and commenced hostilities against Dungannon and his other sons who had exploited their father's weakness in pursuit of their own interests. In May 1552 the new lord deputy, Sir James Croft, lured Tyrone into the pale, where he was detained.<br>
<br>During the earl's absence, the earldom of Tyrone descended further into civil war. The earl's younger sons struggled with Dungannon, whom many held responsible for Tyrone's imprisonment, for control of the region. It was, however, his youngest son, Shane, who rose to prominence, emerging as the lordship's defender and Tyrone's likely successor. A desperate attempt to restore the earl was made in December 1552. He was now an old man but nevertheless set about reasserting his authority. He was reconciled with Dungannon and assembled an army to attack the Scots in Clandeboye in 1554. Shane, however, supported the Scots and easily defeated Tyrone and Dungannon. Tyrone was powerless against his enemies, who later imprisoned his wife, son, and grandson in Scotland. Shane was now the dominant force among the O'Neills; his orchestration of Dungannon's assassination in 1558 merely confirmed to the government what had long been apparent in Tyrone. Tyrone himself escaped to the pale, residing with William Walsh, bishop of Meath. He died before 16 July 1559 and was survived by his last wife, Mary. Shane was proclaimed O'Neill under Gaelic law, and subsequently petitioned for recognition as earl of Tyrone. The annals of the four masters note: &#145;Conn &hellip; d&eacute;cc iar ccaitheamh a aoisi agus aimsire gan oilbeaim gan imdhearccadh, agus ro ba doiligh do Chen&eacute;l E&oacute;cchain a &eacute;ccsidhe munbhadh a sheandataidh agus a shean&oacute;rdhacht, agus a dh&iacute;ol doidhre dfaccbh&aacute;il ina ionadh .i. Seaan&#146; (&#145;Conn &hellip; died after having spent his age and time without blemish or reproach. His death would have been a great cause of great grief to the Kinel-Owen but for his great age and infirmity, and that left an heir worthy of him, i.e. John&#146;; <span class="italic">AFM</span>, s.a. 1559). Conn's successful transition from Gaelic chief to English earl had a profound influence on the Gaelic order's perceptions of Tudor England. However, the government's inability to prevent Shane from undermining his father's authority exposed both the weakness and impermanence of Conn's transition.<br>
