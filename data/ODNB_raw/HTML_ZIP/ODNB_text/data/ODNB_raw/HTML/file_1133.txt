<span class="headword">Baker,  Robert</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1563), <span class="occ">mariner and poet</span>, is known only through his one published writing. Possibly a relative of the Bakers of Sissinghurst who had connections with the London overseas trading community, Robert Baker composed a poem about two English voyages to Guinea, undertaken in the early 1560s, on which he had served as a factor or commercial agent. The poem may have been published when licensed in 1568, but if so, no copy seems to be extant. It eventually appeared, perhaps not in its original entirety, in the first (1589) edition of Hakluyt's <span class="italic">Voiages</span>  (Hakluyt, 130&#150;42), but was omitted from the second, better-known edition, leading to its being for long overlooked in studies of the period. The poem, in 1384 lines as published, is thin on facts identifying the precise voyages, and certain details in the title and side-notes may have been added by Hakluyt. Nevertheless, it undoubtedly refers to two actual voyages, although these are semi-imaginatively related. It concentrates on adventures&#151;or rather misadventures&#151;while trading on the coast of Guinea, on the first voyage an affray with local Africans, on the second voyage the separation of a boat from the mother ship and a desperate journey along the coast, avoiding a Portuguese fort, before Baker and his companions find refuge ashore with an African group. Three survivors are finally rescued by a French ship, and Baker claims to be writing the poem in a prison in France, awaiting ransom. In the poem he sets the misadventures within an extensive but clumsy overall framework of classical mythology, rival gods assisting or otherwise harming the English voyagers.<br>
<br>Baker's poem, although providing only limited evidence on voyages which were among the earliest to far continents by Englishmen, does throw some light on English attitudes of the period. In particular, his general lack of sympathy with things African, most probably engendered by his unhappy misadventures, extends to a jaundiced view of Africans which has been latterly interpreted as an early manifestation of typical &#145;racist&#146; disparagement of non-European peoples by the English. Considered as literature, the poem, albeit composed in somewhat clip-clop verse, is not without occasional felicities, while its subject matter and form give it a notable place in English and even European literary history. Among writings in English other than the entirely factual, it is almost the first, in either prose or verse, to take as its theme long-distance sea travel and cultural encounter in distant lands, a theme within the genre of travel literature to which English readers later became much attached. Further, its mythological framework places it firmly within a common style of contemporary European literature, if only as a small leaf on a broad stream. Yet the combination of mythology with an account of genuine distant voyaging gives this minor poem a measure of significant resemblance to a more considerable and subtle work, a masterpiece of European literature of the period, the epic <span class="italic">Os Lusiadas</span>. Each of these works sprang out of novel overseas experience, that of a maritime nation and that of an intercontinental traveller, and each celebrated access to worlds new to Europe, while lamenting occasional marine disaster. Camoens published in 1572; Baker wrote a decade earlier.<br>
