<span class="headword">Willoughby, Sir  Francis</span>  (1546/7&#150;1596), <span class="occ">coalowner and industrialist</span>, was probably born at Woodlands, Dorset, the third child of Henry Willoughby (<i>d</i>. 1549), a Dorset landowner, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1548), daughter of Thomas Grey, marquess of Dorset. Henry Willoughby had come into the very considerable family inheritance built up at Wollaton, Nottinghamshire, including its lucrative coal pits, on the death of his uncle, Sir John Willoughby, on 10 January 1549; but on the outbreak of Kett's revolt he took a contingent of supporters from Nottingham to Norwich and was killed on 27 August 1549 on Mousehold Heath. His wife had died the previous year, and he left three orphans: the eldest, Margaret; Thomas, aged eight; and Francis, aged two. Thomas succeeded to the family inheritance, his guardian being named as his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11535/', "Henry Grey, marquess of Dorset")</script>, whose importance at the court of Edward VI was soon to be recognized by his elevation as duke of Suffolk. Grey's involvement in the plot to thwart Queen Mary's succession and place his daughter, Lady Jane Grey, cousin of the Willoughby children, upon the throne, not only cost both of the Greys their lives in February 1554 but also brought those associated with them under suspicion, and the guardian of Francis and Margaret, George Medley, was taken to the Tower of London for a time. If psychological explanations are to be sought for Francis Willoughby's subsequent waywardness and instability, one factor may have been the troubled circumstances of his childhood, having already lost both parents.<br>
<br>Willoughby's education was carefully supervised and in addition to private tuition he was at school in London, Saffron Walden, and Cambridge. He was taught Latin, Greek, Hebrew, arithmetic, and how to write in italic script. He was also instructed in social accomplishments and was taught to play on the virginals, and to dance and sing. He duly succeeded his brother, Thomas, after the latter's death in August 1559, and his wardship was conferred upon Sir Francis Knolles. He refused Sir Francis's daughter in marriage, and the executors then bought the wardship in June 1564 for &pound;1500. Now independent at seventeen and with a great estate, Willoughby applied himself to finding a wife and soon informed his uncle, Lord John Grey of Pirgo, that his choice had fallen upon Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1595), the daughter of Mr Littleton of Frankley, Worcestershire, whom he married the same year. Elizabeth's mother was the daughter of the judge Sir John Pakington (<i>d</i>. 1551).<br>
<br>With the revenue from the coal pits handsomely supplementing the receipts from his estates Willoughby was able to maintain a lordly style of life. His wealth required that he maintained a number of gentlemen retainers, who with no real function were quick to take advantage of the antagonism which began to grow between Willoughby and his wife; she being, according to Cassandra, duchess of Chandos, &#145;a woman of great wit and virtue but of a turbulent spirit&#146;  (Smith, <span class="italic">Sir Francis Willoughby</span>, 14). Despite their quarrels the Willoughbys had several children in an attempt to produce a male heir, and it is not surprising that Elizabeth was frequently ill.<br>
<br>While his domestic affairs worsened, Willoughby's fortunes continued to flourish. Coal revenues rose in the 1560s and 1570s, and about 1570 he made his first industrial venture when he set up a forge for making wrought iron at Middleton, Warwickshire, the alternative family seat. When the queen made her famous visit to Kenilworth Castle in 1575, he was advised by George Willoughby when planning his attendance that his<blockquote>number of servants should be no wise less than fifty, as well because heretofore he had not shown himself to the Queen, as that his estate was very well known both to her majesty and to the whole Council to be nothing inferior to the best. (Smith, <span class="italic">Sir Francis Willoughby</span>, 17)</blockquote>He was knighted at Kenilworth and it seems that the possibility was entertained that the queen might spend two days at Middleton, but in the event this did not happen, probably because the manor house was not considered grand enough after Kenilworth. If so, it may have been an important factor in Willoughby's decision to build a new hall at Wollaton five years later.<br>
<br>Willoughby chose a high position for his new seat, dominating the countryside all around in what William Camden was later to call &#145;a foolish display of his wealth&#146;  (Camden, 20). Wollaton's architect, Robert Smythson, had established his reputation on Longleat in Hampshire, and was later to build Hardwick Hall, but we may be sure that Willoughby played an important part in the design; he had amassed a collection of contemporary style manuals, and the result was an eclectic, eye-catching building which Mark Girouard considered &#145;undoubtedly something of a monster &hellip; He [Willoughby] was not a balanced man, nor did he build a balanced building&#146;  (Girouard, 108). There is no evidence that Willoughby accumulated any capital before embarking on his new building, nor that he attempted to curb his lavish style of living. He may have relied on the profits from his coal pits, but these declined as the workings were increasingly beset by intractable drainage problems. In 1581 he contracted his first loan, for &pound;300, from John Rotherson of London; it was the first of a long line of ever-increasing borrowings, all at 10 per cent compound interest.<br>
<br>Willoughby had separated from his wife, who was living in London, when in 1580 the death was announced of his infant son, leaving six surviving daughters. Lady Willoughby wrote to her husband, stating that though she was over forty she was willing to try again to produce a male heir, and suggesting reconciliation. There seems to have been no answer, and in 1582 the queen formalized the separation by an order allowing Lady Willoughby &pound;200 a year for her maintenance. Willoughby now decided that his eldest daughter, Bridget, should marry Percival Willoughby, of Bore Place, Kent, who was distantly related to the Wollaton Willoughbys. The marriage took place in 1583. As Percival was clearly intended to succeed to his father-in-law's estate, Bridget's dowry was only 2000 marks, but Willoughby also settled the ancestral manors of Wollaton with Sutton Passeys, Cossall, and Trowell, in Nottinghamshire, and Middleton and Kingsbury in Warwickshire, first for use by himself and his own heirs male, and second, in default of a male heir, to Percival and Bridget. It must have been expected that most of the other estates would descend to Percival in due course, but he was soon involved in his first clash with Willoughby over a misunderstanding engineered by the gentlemen retainers.<br>
<br>It was against a background of mounting debts that Willoughby entered into his major speculative ventures, no doubt intended as rescue operations. The first involved a proposal put to him by an agricultural prospector in 1585 to grow and process woad at Wollaton, but difficulties with sales were insuperable, and the scheme failed, as did an attempt to establish a &#145;plantation&#146; in Ireland. His next ventures took place around 1590 when he established two blast furnaces, at Middleton and at Oakamoor, Staffordshire, and acquired a third at Codnor, Derbyshire, all of them probably on borrowed money. All were profitable after delays caused by lack of working capital, but it is not possible to say whether they repaid the borrowed capital. Indeed Willoughby's debts became so pressing that he passed over all his ironworks to Percival Willoughby in 1594 in return for his taking over &pound;3000 of his debts. Relations seem to have improved, but with the extent of the debts this could only be temporary. In order to repay them, in May 1595 Willoughby demanded that Percival should make available the six manors bestowed on him upon his marriage, along with the dowries for his daughters (estimated at &pound;25,000) and a yearly allowance of &pound;1100. Percival could only answer this with silence. In the midst of this crisis Lady Willoughby, who had been reconciled to her husband, died on 4 June 1595. Willoughby was so incensed with Percival that he sent a steward to London to find him a wife. He chose an astute widow, Dorothy Tamworth, whom Willoughby immediately married. He then spent most of his time in London, and set about tackling his debts, but in ways that were deeply damaging to Percival's prospects; at the same time he lavished jewels and plate on his new wife.<br>
<br>It was in London, after being married for a mere fifteen months, that Willoughby died after a short illness on 16 November 1596. He was buried the same night in St Giles Cripplegate. He died intestate and well might his family suspect that he was poisoned, for he died most conveniently for his new bride, leaving her pregnant, so that if she should give birth to a son the boy would inherit virtually the entire estate. This final blow to Percival was avoided when on 3 May 1597 a daughter, Frances, was born, but Percival faced endless litigation before inheriting a greatly reduced estate encumbered with debts.<br>
