<span class="headword">Cooke,  Edward</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1680&#150;1682), <span class="occ">legal writer and lawyer</span>, about whose early life nothing is known, studied law at the Middle Temple, London, and first surfaced in the late 1670s and early 1680s, when he joined the polemical battle to exclude the openly Catholic James, duke of York, from the throne. Cooke's career as a whig writer began in 1680 with the publication of an anti-papal harangue entitled <span class="italic">A true and perfect narrative of the inhumane practices &hellip; of the Jesuits and papists toward protestants at home and abroad</span>. This work was dedicated to the earl of Shaftesbury, whose patronage he sought and on whom, Cooke believed, depended the &#145;advancement of the Protestant religion [and] the welfare of the kingdom&#146;  (Zook, 83). It was followed in 1682 by two tracts that aimed at strengthening the whig case for exclusion. One was a translation of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> (<span class="italic">Magna Carta, made in the ninth year of King Henry the Third &hellip; faithfully translated for the benefit of those that do not understand the Latin</span>) and the other an account of the royal succession down to the seventeenth century (<span class="italic">The History of Successions of the Kings of England</span>).<br>
<br>In 1682 Cooke also published his most significant work, <span class="italic">Argumentum antiNormanicum, or, An argument proving from ancient histories and records that William, duke of Normandy made no absolute conquest of England by the sword</span>. Written in defence of William Petyt's <span class="italic">The Antient Right of the Commons of England Asserted</span> (1680) and against Dr Robert Brady's attack on Petyt in <span class="italic">A Full and Clear Answer</span> (1681), it was printed anonymously and in the late seventeenth century often attributed to Petyt or his fellow whig William Atwood. Although later scholars have sometimes treated the work somewhat dismissively (see, for example, Pocock, and D. Douglas, <span class="italic">English Scholars</span>, 1939), other historians (such as Zook and Greenberg) have suggested that it enjoyed a high reputation among prominent whigs. Thus James Tyrrell, a close associate of the earl of Shaftesbury and John Locke, and in 1704 the first contemporary to identify Cooke publicly as the tract's author, quoted from it frequently. Moreover Brady, who counted among his sponsors Charles II and James II, deemed it worthy of rebuttal in his <span class="italic">Introduction to Old English History</span> (1684). Equally telling, in 1689 <span class="italic">Argumentum antiNormanicum</span> was considered sufficiently persuasive to merit republication as the Convention Parliament deliberated the revolution settlement, this time under the title <span class="italic">A seasonable treatise: wherein it is proved that King William, commonly called the conqueror did not get the imperial crown of England by the sword</span>.<br>
<br>As for the political ideas which Cooke put forward to justify first exclusion and later the revolution the full titles of both versions of <span class="italic">AntiNormanicum</span> tell much of the story. Like Atwood, Petyt, and Tyrrell, he found radical ancient constitutionalism perfectly suited to making the case against the late Stuart kingship. Constructed by parliamentarians such as William Prynne in the civil wars of the 1640s, this ideology rested primarily upon three medieval sources, the so-called laws of St Edward the Confessor, the <span class="italic">Modus tenendi parliamentum</span>, and the <span class="italic">Mirror of Justices</span>. To late Stuart whigs such as Cooke these works, which claimed to predate the arrival of the Normans in 1066, supported the major tenets of their ideology, namely, that since at least as early as the Saxon period England had been governed by an elected king with whom the people had made an enforceable contract; that ancient parliaments, which included both the Lords and the Commons, possessed the power to make law and control over-mighty sovereigns; and that parliament, or the people, retained the right to resist, depose, and replace a ruler who broke the terms of his agreement with the kingdom. Finally whigs such as Cooke insisted that these Saxon institutions had survived Norman conquest intact and lived on in their own day.<br>
<br>Scholars later discovered that St Edward's laws, the <span class="italic">Modus</span>, and the <span class="italic">Mirror</span> dated not from the Saxon period but from the early twelfth and early fourteenth centuries. But throughout the Stuart period all three were widely accepted as authentic statements of how things used to be (though legal antiquaries such as John Selden raised doubts about the authenticity of the <span class="italic">Modus</span> and <span class="italic">Mirror</span>). Indeed, St Edward's laws enjoyed the imprimatur of the foremost lawyers and antiquaries of the seventeenth century, including Selden, Sir Henry Spelman, and Sir Roger Twysden. It was then perfectly understandable that Cooke and his fellow whigs looked to these sources and the version of history, law, and government that they spawned for ammunition in their struggle against the late Stuart kings. Cooke, for example, argued that medieval records, especially St Edward's laws, proved that William I governed not as a conqueror but rather as the heir and successor of his cousin St Edward. One need look no further than William's confirmation of the Confessor's laws&#151;&#145;his <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> and the groundwork of all that followed&#146;&#151;as well as to the various confirmations of his successors  (Cooke, <span class="italic">Argumentum antiNormanicum</span>, liv). First came Henry I's famous charter of liberties, followed by the confirmations of King Stephen, Henry II, and King John in <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>. Then there was the new coronation oath in which all rulers from 1308 down to Cooke's own day swore to abide by St Edward's laws. To Cooke this steady drumbeat of royal confirmations meant that the Norman kings, like their Saxon counterparts, had reigned by right and election and by consultation with a full parliament. And what was true of the Saxons and Normans was true of all monarchs, including Charles II and James II. From this reasoning a conclusion vital to the anti-Stuart cause ineluctably followed: the two houses of parliament, which held the lion's share of legislative sovereignty, possessed rights to change the king, alter the kingship, and settle the kingdom as they thought fit.<br>
<br>The end of Cooke's life is as much a mystery as his early days. If he was the Edward Cooke to whom, along with Atwood, Petyt bequeathed &pound;50 in his last will and testament, he was still alive in July 1705.<br>
