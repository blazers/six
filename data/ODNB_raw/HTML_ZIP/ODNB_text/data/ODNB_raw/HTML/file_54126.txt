<span class="headword">Underwood,  Thomas Richard</span>  (1772&#150;1835), <span class="occ">watercolour painter and geologist</span>, was born on 24 February 1772 at 43 Lamb's Conduit Street, Holborn, London, the only son of Thomas Underwood (<i>d</i>. 1808) and his wife, Susannah (<i>d</i>. 1804/5). Nothing is known of his early education or training in watercolour drawing. At an early age, he married Jane Eleanor Stageldoir, a dancer at Drury Lane, and they had at least two children. There was a separation before 1803.<br>
<br>In company with Turner, Girtin, and many others Underwood worked regularly at the home of Dr Monro, and from 1789 to 1802 he exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy. He was a founder member of the Sketching Society (known as &#145;the Brothers&#146;). In 1792 he was appointed draughtsman-in-ordinary to the Society of Antiquaries who have a number of his original drawings&#151;engravings of some of these appeared in <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> (vols. 11&#150;14). The range of subjects depicted in his works suggests he travelled widely in England and Wales. His circle of acquaintances also included Wordsworth, Coleridge (to whom he was known as Subligno), Southey, and the Wedgwood brothers Josiah, John, and Thomas, possibly through their connection with Dr Beddoes' Pneumatic Institute in Bristol.<br>
<br>In 1800, Underwood became a proprietor of the newly founded Royal Institution, and the following year he pressed Count Rumford to appoint Humphry Davy assistant lecturer there. Shortly after Davy's appointment, he and Underwood holidayed together in Penzance. In 1802, after the peace of Amiens, he made a visit to France. The following year he agreed at the last minute, as a substitute for Coleridge, to return as secretary&#150;companion to Thomas Wedgwood. They reached Geneva before turning back. Some time after the resumption of hostilities on 16 May 1803 the pair were parted; Wedgwood escaped, but Underwood was arrested at Calais and detained in France until 1814. During this period his financial support was provided by the Wedgwood family through their Paris banker.<br>
<br>For a time Underwood lived with some degree of freedom in Paris until the English were ordered to Verdun. He then went into hiding until 1806 when, with the help of <i>tribun</i> Pictet, he was allowed to return to Paris and study at the Louvre. On several occasions he secured a passport to travel to Rigny Uss&eacute; and to Roucy to draw landscapes. In Paris he renewed his acquaintance with Rumford, who had settled at Auteuil, and made friendships with many scientists, including Amp&egrave;re, Humboldt, Thenard, Gay-Lussac, and the Brongniarts. When Napoleon gave Davy special permission to travel through France in 1813, Underwood acted as his escort, introducing him to the scientific community, enabling him to acquire some iodine, taking him to meetings of learned societies and accompanying him to the empress Josephine at Malmaison.<br>
<br>Early in 1814 the allies invaded France, and during the siege of Paris it was only the intervention of the empress that allowed Underwood to remain in the city. During the first four months of 1814 he kept a journal of the siege, which was later published in the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, 1825, under the title &#145;The journal of a d&eacute;tenu&#146;; it gives a unique account of Paris under siege. His detention came to an end with the entry of the allies into Paris and in June he left for England. However, he soon returned to France and made Paris his home for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>With his knowledge of Paris and his friendly manner, Underwood was uniquely placed to welcome visiting English scientists and introduce them to their French counterparts, as may be seen from his correspondence with Adam Sedgwick (1822&#150;9) and Thomas Webster (1820&#150;27) particularly. Underwood's letters were full of the latest scientific intelligence: books about to be published; papers read to learned societies; the current state of scientific debate; opinions on contemporaries. On his frequent visits to England he carried geological specimens and letters which aided the rapid exchange of knowledge, especially the correspondence between Faraday and Amp&egrave;re on electro-magnetism.<br>
<br>Underwood's own scientific interests seem to have centred on the field of geology, especially the extinct volcanoes of Auvergne and the geology of the Paris basin. His letters to Sedgwick contain carefully drawn and densely annotated sections which reveal him as an accomplished geologist. In London he was a member of the Royal Institution and a member (later fellow) of the Geological Society; in Paris he was a member of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Philomathique, the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;ologique, and the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Linn&eacute;enne. He died on 11 July 1835 at Chamarande, near Paris, and was buried there. The principal beneficiary of his estate in England was his daughter, Eleanor Gawan, and in France his sole executor, one Marie Dassau.<br>
