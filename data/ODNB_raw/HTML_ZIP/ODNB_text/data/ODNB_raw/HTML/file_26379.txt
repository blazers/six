<span class="headword">Stephens,  Charles Edward</span>  (1821&#150;1892), <span class="occ">composer and instrumentalist</span>, was born at 12 Portman Place, London, on 18 March 1821, the nephew of the soprano <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26378/', "Catherine (Kitty) Stephens, countess of Essex")</script>. He began to study music at an early age, and, like his brother Samuel John Stephens (1819&#150;1889), was taught the piano by Cipriani Potter, harmony by J. A. Hamilton, and the violin by Henry Blagrove. The Society of British Musicians, of which he was a member, rehearsed an overture of his in January 1842; he also played second violin in the society's quartets. Two of his string quartets (G minor, 1843, and F major, 1844) were published, and he won both the first and the second prize for quartets offered by Trinity College, London, in 1879.<br>
<br>Stephens became a member of the Royal Society of Musicians in 1843, and in the same year was appointed organist of St Mark's, Myddelton Square. In 1846 he was elected organist of Holy Trinity, Paddington, followed by St Mark's, Hamilton Terrace (1862), St Clement Danes, Strand (1864), and St Saviour's, Paddington (1872); he resigned this last post in 1875. He occasionally played in public as a pianist, but spent most of his time teaching. He was founding member of the Musical Association (1874), and treasurer of the Philharmonic Society (1880) and the south-eastern section of the National Society of Professional Musicians. In 1885 he was appointed one of the examiners for degrees in music at Cambridge University.<br>
<br>Stephens was an accomplished teacher and musician. His numerous compositions included five overtures and two symphonies, one of which, in G minor, was performed in Birmingham on 24 April 1890 and at a Philharmonic concert on 19 March 1891. He wrote a large quantity of piano, organ, and chamber music, as well as church services and anthems. He was an editor of <span class="italic">The Choir Chant Book</span> (1882) and author of the article on the Philharmonic Society in the first edition of Grove's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Music and Musicians</span> (1879&#150;89). He died at his residence, 37 Howley Place, Maida Hill, London, on 13 July 1892 and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
