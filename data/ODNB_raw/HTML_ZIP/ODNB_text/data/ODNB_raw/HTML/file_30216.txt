<span class="headword">Yelverton,  William Charles</span>, fourth Viscount Avonmore  (1824&#150;1883), <span class="occ">army officer and litigant</span>, born on 27 September 1824, was the eldest son of Barry John Yelverton, third Viscount Avonmore (1790&#150;1870), and his second wife, Cecilia (<i>d</i>. 1 Feb 1876), eldest daughter of Charles O'Keeffe of Hollybrooke Park, Tipperary. The third viscount's two sons with his first wife died in 1853 and 1860. Yelverton was educated for military service at Woolwich and entered the Royal Artillery. He attained the rank of major, served in the Crimean War, received a medal and clasp for Inkerman and Sevastopol, and was created a knight of the fifth class of the Mejidiye by the Turkish government.<br>
<br>In March 1861 Yelverton was suspended from all military duties, and on 1 April placed on half pay, as a consequence of his involvement in a scandalous legal case. Between 1859 and 1868 he was involved in litigation regarding his alleged marriage with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16998/', "Maria Theresa Longworth")</script>. The couple had met in 1852, and again in 1855 when she was serving as a nurse with the French Sisters of Charity in the Crimea. In April 1857, Yelverton &#145;performed the ceremony&#146; of marriage, by reading the Church of England service aloud, while in Edinburgh, and they were married by the Roman Catholic rite on 15 August 1857 at Rostrevor in Ireland. The following year, on 26 June, Yelverton married Emily Marianne (<i>d</i>. 1909), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/793/', "Major-General Sir Charles Ashworth")</script>, and widow of the naturalist Edward Forbes, at Trinity Chapel, Edinburgh, according to the rites of the Church of England. In 1859, Maria Longworth unsuccessfully sued him for the restoration of conjugal rights; in 1861 a further action was brought in which the validity of the first marriage was the point at issue. The Irish court, in which this action was brought, validated the marriage, but on appeal it was annulled by the Scottish court, which judgment was confirmed by the House of Lords, and upheld through several appeals, the last in 1868.<br>
<br>Yelverton succeeded his father as fourth viscount on 24 October 1870, and died at Biarritz on 1 April 1883. He was succeeded by his sons, Barry Nugent, fifth viscount (1859&#150;1885), and Algernon William, sixth viscount (1866&#150;1910). Yelverton's marriage episode was reproduced in the novel <span class="italic">Gentle Blood, or, The Secret Marriage</span> (1861), by James Roderick O'Flanagan, while Cyrus Redding based the plot of <span class="italic">A Wife and not a Wife</span> (1867) on the story of Yelverton's Irish marriage.<br>
