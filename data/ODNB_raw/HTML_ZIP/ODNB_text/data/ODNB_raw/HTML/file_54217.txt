<span class="headword">Graham,  Malise</span>, third earl of Strathearn and first earl of Menteith  (1406<span class="mult">x</span>13&#150;1490), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54213/', "Patrick Graham, second earl of Strathearn (d. 1413)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54211/', "Graham family")</script>], and Euphemia, daughter and heir of David Stewart, earl of Strathearn, fourth son of Robert II. The marriage of his parents was arranged by 1401 and took place about 1406. Graham was born between that date and his father's murder in 1413. At first Strathearn was administered by his mother, but by 1416 power over Graham and his lands had passed to Walter Stewart, earl of Atholl (<i>d</i>. 1437), his great-uncle. Atholl remained his tutor for the next decade and gradually secured authority in Strathearn. In 1424 Graham was named as a hostage for the release of James I, though he did not go to England until arrangements were finally made in 1427. In September of that year he was deprived of Strathearn, which was given to Atholl, receiving in compensation from the king a truncated earldom of Menteith. But his custody of this was purely nominal, and within two months of the grant he was sent to England as a hostage for the king's ransom.<br>
<br>The treatment of Graham by the king was probably resented by his Graham kinsmen, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11218/', "Sir Robert Graham")</script> (a landowner in Strathearn), and by Archibald Douglas, fifth earl of Douglas (<i>d</i>. 1439), husband of his sister Euphemia. It was hardly the major issue claimed by some historians, however. Douglas had his own problems with James I, and Robert Graham continued to work closely with Atholl in Strathearn. By comparison with the royal attack on the Albany Stewarts, Malise's fate was insignificant. For the next quarter of a century he resided as a forgotten hostage at Pontefract Castle. His re-emergence came at the critical point in relations between James II and the Black Douglases in 1453. The Douglases and James Hamilton, second husband of Graham's sister, negotiated his release&#151;an act which has been alleged as having the intention of making the exile a rival royal claimant. As a descendant of Robert II's second and unquestionably legal marriage, historians have suggested that Graham could have had a right to the throne over the dubious legitimacy of James II. There is no evidence of this as the motive for Graham's release. Rather the Douglases probably sought to embarrass James II by drawing attention to his father's abandonment of the hostages. Graham certainly made no attempt to establish himself as a pretender. He appeared at parliament in 1455 to forfeit his Douglas redeemers, and for the next thirty-five years was the least active of the Scottish earls. He was married twice, first to Jane Rochford and then to Marion, whose surname is unknown. He died before May in 1490.<br>
