<span class="headword">Bourne,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1694, <em>d.</em> 1733), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was baptized at Newcastle upon Tyne on 16 December 1694, the son of Thomas Bourne, a tailor. He was bound apprentice to a glazier in 1709, but showed such aptitude for learning that he was allowed to cancel his indentures and was sent to resume his education at the Newcastle grammar school. He was admitted a sizar of Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1717, holding a scholarship of &pound;5 from Newcastle corporation, under the tuition of the Revd Thomas Atherton, a fellow townsman. He graduated BA in 1720 and MA in 1724, and received the appointment of curate of All Hallows Church, Newcastle, where he remained until his death. He married twice; he and his first wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1727), had three children, two of whom, Henry and Eleanor, survived infancy. On 30 May 1728 he married Alice Inchbald (<i>d</i>. 1773), with whom he had two children who both died young.<br>
<br>In 1725 Bourne published <span class="italic">Antiquitates vulgares, or, The antiquities of the common people, giving an account of their opinions and ceremonies</span>, which he dedicated to the mayor and corporation in recognition of their encouragement of learning and support for the clergy. This was republished, with additions by John Brand, in 1777 in his <span class="italic">Popular Antiquities</span>, and forms the groundwork of the later labours of Sir Henry Ellis and W. C. Hazlitt. Consequently, it is often cited as an early example of folklore studies, although Bourne's purpose had been to identify which customs should be retained and encouraged and which abolished or regulated. In 1727 he issued a liturgical manual, <span class="italic">The harmony and agreement of the collects, epistles, and gospels, as they stand in the Book of Common Prayer for the Sundays throughout the year</span>, in recognition of which he was awarded a lectureship in 1728. He also wrote a history of his native town, which was substantially complete at his death. It was afterwards published by subscription by the printer John White in 1736, in support of Bourne's widow and children, as a folio volume dedicated to Sir Walter Blackett, under the title of <span class="italic">The History of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, or, The Ancient and Present State of that Town</span>. The history was based on William Grey's <span class="italic">Chorographia, or, A Survey of Newcastle upon Tine</span> (1649) and followed the tradition of a topographical survey, giving a lively account of Newcastle in the early eighteenth century as well as of its history. Bourne complained in the preface of the difficulties he had met as a humble curate in gathering materials for his work. Christopher Hunter of Durham had plans to publish an edition with considerable additions in 1750, but these never came to fruition. In 1757 a few large paper copies were printed; these are now very rare.<br>
<br>Bourne, who was described by his vicar as &#145;universally beloved&#146;  (Adamson, &#145;Henry Bourne&#146;, 150), died in Newcastle on 16 February 1733 and was buried in All Souls, Newcastle, on 18 February. His widow outlived him for many years and retired to Mrs Davidson's Hospital in Newcastle, where she died in 1773.<br>
