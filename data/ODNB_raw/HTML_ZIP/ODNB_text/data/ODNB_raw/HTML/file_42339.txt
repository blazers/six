<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hammond,  (John) Lawrence Le Breton</span>  (1872&#150;1949), <span class="occ">historian and journalist</span>, was born on 18 July 1872 at Drighlington, Yorkshire, the second of the eight children of Vavasour Fitz Hammond Hammond (1842&#150;1897), the local rector, and his wife, Caroline (1849&#150;1925). Neither parent was from Yorkshire. Caroline Hammond had grown up in Wimborne, Dorset, where her father, William George Webb, was a maltster. Vavasour Fitz Hammond Hammond was from Jersey, where his father, John Hammond, was bailiff, the highest-ranking civil officer on the island. Drighlington at the time of Hammond's birth was a mere village, but it lay within 5 miles of both Bradford and Leeds, the twin centres of the still-thriving woollen and worsted trades. Politically, Drighlington formed part of the Spen valley division and shared its Liberal commitment. Hammond's father, a keen home-ruler and a member of the Liberal Churchmen's Union, made Gladstone into &#145;a sort of fourth person of the Trinity&#146;  (Weaver, 11), and Hammond himself, from a very early age, felt some confusion over the distinction between God and the Grand Old Man. His earliest memories, he once recalled, were of the early stages of the home-rule struggle. Gladstone's speeches, along with the letters of Joseph Mazzini, the Italian nationalist, and the sermons of F. D. Maurice, the English Christian socialist, made up his earliest serious reading.<br>
<br>From 1886 to 1891 Hammond attended Bradford grammar school where, along with his friend and classmate Sir William Rothenstein, he earned a reputation as a fiery radical. He went up to St John's College, Oxford, in 1891, to read classics with Sidney Ball, the Fabian disciple of T. H. Green and the recognized leader of university socialism. Ball's was a formative influence; &#145;I cannot imagine&#146;, Hammond later wrote, &#145;what my Oxford life would have been like without him&#146;  (Weaver, 265). But collectivism generally was on the wane among undergraduates in the early 1890s. A Liberal revival was under way in which Hammond, together with his friends J. A. Simon, Francis Hirst, and Hilaire Belloc, played a prominent part. An accomplished debater, Hammond was elected secretary of the Oxford Union in November 1894. This and the presidency of the Palmerston Club distracted him from his studies, and Hammond went down with a disappointing second in Greats in 1895.<br>
<br>Shortly thereafter, he succeeded Tom Ellis, the new chief Liberal whip, as private secretary to Sir John Brunner, co-founder of Brunner, Mond &amp; Co. and Liberal MP for the Cheshire division of Northwich. Hammond's first book was a revision of Brunner's <span class="italic">Education in Cheshire</span> (1896). In 1897 he contributed to the <span class="italic">Essays in Liberalism by Six Oxford Men</span> and started writing leaders for the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span> and the <span class="italic">Liverpool Post</span>. His life in journalism began in earnest two years later, when he assumed the editorship of <span class="italic">The Speaker</span>, a weekly alternative to the Liberal Unionist <span class="italic">Spectator</span>. At a time when imperialism was all the rage, the vital stuff of tabloid sensation, Hammond courageously upheld an older, nationalist tradition. Week in and week out he provided a forum for J. A. Hobson, L. T. Hobhouse, John Morley, James Bryce, and other &#145;pro-Boers&#146;, who opposed the war in South Africa and deplored the army's resort to what Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman famously called &#145;methods of barbarism&#146;. With Francis Hirst and Gilbert Murray, the prodigal classicist-cum-liberal internationalist who was to prove a lifelong friend, Hammond at the same time joined in the writing of <span class="italic">Liberalism and the Empire</span> (1900), a lonely protest in the name of reason against the imperialist excesses of the age.<br>
<br>In 1901 Hammond married (Lucy) Barbara Bradby [<a name="cosubject_42339"></a><span class="headword">(Lucy) Barbara Hammond</span>  (1873&#150;1961)<span class="occ"></span>], the seventh and last child of the Revd Edward Henry Bradby (1826&#150;1893) and his wife, Ellen Johnson (1836&#150;1918). Born on 25 July 1873, Barbara (as she was always called) Hammond had grown up at Haileybury College, where her father, a product of Thomas Arnold's Rugby and Benjamin Jowett's Balliol, was headmaster. When aged ten she had moved with her family to Toynbee Hall, Samuel Barnett's mission settlement in Whitechapel, London, and there been steeped in the late Victorian culture of altruism. After rigorous training in the corporate virtues at Jane Frances Dove's pioneer boarding-school for girls, St Leonard's, at St Andrews, Fife, she followed her sister Dorothy to Oxford, entering Lady Margaret Hall in 1892. Besides meeting Lawrence Hammond she studied with L. T. Hobhouse and was the first woman to earn first-class honours in both classical moderations and Greats. As ardent a Liberal as her husband, she too was a committed &#145;pro-Boer&#146;, a suffragist, and a pillar of the Women's Industrial Council until 1905, when ovarian tuberculosis forced a move from Battersea Park to Hampstead and condemned the Hammonds to childlessness.<br>
<br>It was only on coming down from Oxford in what he later regarded as an appalling state of ignorance that Lawrence Hammond began to read history in any systematic way. His first historical work was an admiring, not to say worshipful, study of <span class="italic">Charles James Fox</span> (1903). Journalism remained his main occupation until 1907, when he surrendered the editorship of <span class="italic">The Speaker</span> (henceforth <span class="italic">The Nation</span>) to H. W. Massingham and became secretary to the civil service commission, a post that evidently (and somewhat scandalously) afforded sufficient leisure for his scholarship. In perfect partnership&#151;hers the research, his the writing, in the main&#151;the Hammonds now entered into an intensive study of the social history of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The first fruit of their collaboration was <span class="italic">The Village Labourer</span> (1911), a passionate indictment of the socially dislocating effects of eighteenth-century enclosure, which long remained the most widely read work of English rural history.<br>
<br>In 1912, after seven years in Hampstead, the Hammonds retreated further from London still, to Oatfield, a farmhouse at Piccotts End near Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. Though handsome and vigorous people&#151;Barbara especially was known for her intensely penetrating blue eyes and her beautifully abundant, copper-red hair&#151;they were never robust, and Oatfield became their sanatorium, a refuge from the miseries and miasmas of the world. Lawrence Hammond's work took him frequently to town, but apart from occasional forays to the Public Record Office, Barbara Hammond avoided it as much as possible, always preferring the quiet of Oatfield, where between paragraphs she pottered about an extensive garden, tended all manner of domestic animals, and brilliantly maintained a caustic correspondence with a wide circle of family members and friends.<br>
<br>At war's outbreak in 1914, Lawrence Hammond, after much political soul-searching, accepted a commission in the Royal Field Artillery. He was an indifferent soldier, however, and in July 1916, on being declared unfit for service overseas, he left the army for Asquith's committee on (later ministry of) reconstruction. Here he joined Vaughan Nash, Edwin Montagu, Beatrice Webb, and others in the work (as Beatrice Webb described it) of &#145;surveying and unravelling the whole tangle of governmental activities introduced by the war&#146;  (Weaver, 132). Barbara Hammond, meanwhile, brought to completion the book that remains &#145;the classic study of the social and economic conditions of the working people during the industrial revolution&#146;  (Clarke, 189): <span class="italic">The Town Labourer</span> (1917). Appearing when it did, in the gloomy depths of the First World War, this famous indictment of the excessively commercial spirit of one age contributed decisively to the socialist spirit of another. With the publication of <span class="italic">The Skilled Labourer</span> two years later, the Hammonds completed their famous trilogy&#151;the effect of which was massively to confirm the catastrophic version of the industrial era&#151;and established themselves as the leading social historians of their time.<br>
<br>Lawrence Hammond returned to journalism in 1919 as special correspondent to the Paris peace conference for the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, C. P. Scott's great Liberal daily. Discouraged by the vengeful spirit of the proceedings, he wrote his own J. M. Keynes-like denunciation of the treaty of Versailles, and then turned his mind to Ireland, past and present. In two famous <span class="italic">Nation</span> supplements of 1921, he exposed both the futility and the barbarity of the Anglo-Irish war and contributed to the change of heart that brought Lloyd George to the negotiating table. Hammond covered the negotiations ending the war for the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, met and admired Michael Collins, and for the next two years conspicuously supported Collins's effort to reconcile Ireland to partition and dominion status.<br>
<br>The labourer trilogy, meanwhile, had led the Hammonds naturally to their interestingly ambivalent life of <span class="italic">Lord Shaftesbury</span> (1923) and to <span class="italic">The Rise of Modern Industry</span> (1925), a work of synthesis that R. H. Tawney once described as &#145;the most instructive and most original introduction to the social and economic aspects of history available in English&#146;  (Weaver, 187). But Tawney was a friend and like-minded admirer. In truth, the Hammonds were liberal moralists whose economic arguments were coming under increasingly critical scrutiny in the 1920s by a new generation of more statistically minded historians led by J. H. Clapham. In the first volume of his <span class="italic">Economic History of Modern Britain</span> (1926), Clapham assailed &#145;the legend that everything was getting worse for the working man&#146; in the early nineteenth century and in its place made the statistical case for material improvement. This the Hammonds ultimately begrudgingly conceded, but only after falling back on the more qualitative genealogy of misery that was to inform their last substantial collaborative effort, <span class="italic">The Age of the Chartists</span> (1930).<br>
<br>In belated tribute to their collaboration, the University of Oxford conferred honorary degrees on both Hammonds simultaneously in 1933. Barbara Hammond was by then at work on her never-to-be-published history of commons preservation, Lawrence Hammond on his magisterial study <span class="italic">Gladstone and the Irish Nation</span> (1938, reissued with an introduction by M. R. D. Foot, 1964). Conceived and commissioned as a vindication of Gladstone's Irish policy, this great work remains &#145;the most striking of many works treating aspects of Gladstone's later career&#146;  (Matthew, 395); but, appearing as it did in the shadow of the Munich crisis, it found few readers at the time and it remained the least known of Hammond's major works.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the Hammonds let their house at Hemel Hempstead and moved to Manchester, where Lawrence Hammond, now aged sixty-seven, assumed a permanent place on the staff of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. A lifelong Francophile, he was pained by Vichy, an aberration born of a moment of national bewilderment, he felt, and for four long years he sustained an encouraging series of leaders subsequently published under the suggestive title <span class="italic">Faith in France</span> (1948). Twice in his life, in 1931 and 1946, Hammond declined honours from his own government, but he proudly accepted appointment to the French L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1948. An honorary fellow of St John's College, Oxford, since 1937, he was elected to a fellowship of the British Academy in 1942 and received a second honorary degree of DLitt, from the University of Manchester, in 1944.<br>
<br>The Hammonds returned to Oatfield at the end of the war in 1945. Despite the modest reception accorded <span class="italic">Gladstone and the Irish Nation</span>, Hammond had not despaired of his romantic notion of bringing the wisdom of Gladstone to bear on his own illiberal age, and in 1946 he began a short life of the Grand Old Man that he did not live to complete. (Eventually completed by M. R. D. Foot, it appeared posthumously as <span class="italic">Gladstone and Liberalism</span> in 1952.) A long-time sufferer from angina and related maladies, Lawrence Hammond died of heart failure at Oatfield on 7 April 1949. Barbara Hammond survived him, and everyone else she knew, by many years, dying sadly demented at St Paul's Hospital, Hemel Hempstead, on 16 November 1961.<br>
<br>Comparing the collaboration of the Hammonds to that of Sidney and Beatrice Webb at the time of Lawrence Hammond's death, Gilbert Murray noted that the Hammonds were more &#145;Victorian&#146; in that they based their politics on ethical judgements, not simply on economics or supposed social results. &#145;They asked first not what would pay but what was true, what was right, and what was humane&#146;. For all his political engagement, moreover, there was in J. L. Hammond especially, Murray said, &#145;a sort of radiation of personal goodness, of quick sympathy and kindness, combined in a rare way with unswerving integrity and courage&#146;, and thus it had been well said of him that &#145;amid the hottest political controversies, he never made a personal enemy or lost a personal friend&#146;  (Weaver, 259&#150;61).<br>
