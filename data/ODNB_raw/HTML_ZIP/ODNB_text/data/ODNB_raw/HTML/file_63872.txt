<span class="headword">Jamieson,  Christina</span>  (1864&#150;1942), <span class="occ">writer and suffragist</span>, was born on 30 June 1864 at Cruisdale, Sandness, Shetland, the second of the seven children of Robert Jamieson (1827&#150;1899), schoolmaster, and Barbara Laing (1838&#150;1923), daughter of a schoolmaster and land surveyor. Jamieson received her education at the school in Sandness, where her father was headmaster, and she acted for a while as a pupil teacher there. Several of her brothers went on to become eminent academics on the mainland, but she remained in Shetland for most of her life.<br>
<br>Robert Jamieson was a contributor of articles and stories to <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, and his daughter followed suit. In the late 1890s she began to write short stories and factual pieces for weekly and other papers, sometimes under the <i>nom de plume</i> John Cranston. These writings were usually about her native islands, and often had a strong antiquarian content. She continued to write throughout her life, often in a robust Shetland dialect.<br>
<br>When Robert Jamieson died in 1899, Jamieson and her mother moved to Lerwick. They eventually lived in Twagios House, a large eighteenth-century building at the south side of the town, and for several years Jamieson used it as a base for her suffragist activities. She helped to found the Shetland Women's Suffrage Society in 1909 and guided its affiliation to the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. She designed a local banner, and helped to carry it in processions as far afield as London. Her other main contribution to the movement was literary and oratorical: she wrote numerous pro-suffrage items for the local press, lectured on the movement's history to the Lerwick Literary and Debating Society in March 1909, and published a pamphlet based on the lecture (<span class="italic">Sketch of Votes for Women</span>, 1909). In 1910 she wrote a moving article on the economic and emotional plight of the women of Shetland (<span class="italic">Shetland Times</span>, 22 and 29 January 1910).<br>
<br>Jamieson's party political adherence is unknown, but she was often friendly to unpopular causes. About 1900 she wrote an essay with sympathetic remarks about pro-Boers  (Shetland Archives, MS D.18/32/23), and she befriended and assisted local socialists in the inter-war period. In the 1920s and 1930s she shared Twagios House with her nephew Bertie Jamieson, an active communist. During the First World War she played an important and, as far as her sex was concerned, unique part in public life in the islands: in 1916 she became a member of Lerwick school board, and in 1918 she became interim chairman of it. She was also a member of the county committee on secondary education, and eventually of the education authority. In all these forums she was a forthright speaker.<br>
<br>In her later years Jamieson devoted her attention to antiquarian and folklore matters. In 1930 she founded the Shetland Folklore Society, which specialized in recreating old Shetland dances for audiences in Lerwick and throughout the islands. Jamieson's kitchen at Twagios was the site of many of these performances. In 1931 she encouraged the education authority to prepare a &#145;Shetland Book&#146; for local scholars (a project which came to fruition in 1967). With the antiquarian E. S. Reid Tait, and with the assistance of her nephew Bertie Jamieson, she transcribed for publication extracts from the old kirk session minutes of her native parish of Walls and Sandness. These were published as <span class="italic">The Hjaltland Miscellany</span>, volumes 2 and 3 (1937 and 1939); volume 2 contains superb introductory essays by Jamieson. Jamieson had emigrated to New Zealand in 1935 to live with a brother, in a fruitless search for relief from asthma. She died at Nelson, New Zealand, on 23 March 1942.<br>
