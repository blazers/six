<span class="headword">Lyon,  George Francis</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Said-ben-Abdallah]</span>  (1795&#150;1832), <span class="occ">naval officer and explorer</span>, son of a colonel in the army, was born at Chichester, Sussex. Around 1805 he was educated at Dr Burney's naval academy, Gosport, Hampshire, and entered the navy in 1808, had the commission of lieutenant confirmed in 1814, and saw much action.<br>
<br>Lyon was at Malta in September 1818 when Joseph Ritchie, secretary to the consul in Paris, arrived there on his way to Tripoli to begin his attempt to reach central Africa from the north. Captain Frederick Marryat, who was to accompany Ritchie, proved unable to do so, and Lyon volunteered to take his place, by his own admission purely from a wish to rise in his profession. In November Lyon joined Ritchie at Tripoli. He already had some knowledge of Arabic, and for the next four months studied the language and religious and social customs of the Arabs, adopting the alias Said-ben-Abdallah. After long delays at Tripoli and a short expedition to the Gharian Mountains, they and a servant, transparently disguised as Muslims, left Tripoli for Murzuq, the capital of Fezzan, the bey of which supported the expedition. Lyon suffered from dysentery and the extreme heat, and on 20 November 1819 Ritchie died. Lyon, in poor health and the victim of Ritchie's mismanagement of the whole expedition, pushed on to Tajarhi, and thence managed to reach Tripoli in March 1820, and London in July 1820. The account of his and Ritchie's journey was published as <span class="italic">A Narrative of Travels in North Africa</span> (1821), illustrated from Lyon's own drawings.<br>
<br>Lyon was promoted commander in 1821, and appointed to the <i>Hecla</i> under the orders of Captain William Edward Parry in the <i>Fury</i>. The expedition, Parry's second in the search for the north-west passage, sailed on 8 May 1821, entered the Arctic region through Hudson Strait, examined Repulse Bay and the neighbouring coast of Melville peninsula, and wintered at a small island to the eastward of the Frozen Strait. The next summer they went further north and entered Fury and Hecla Strait, but the season being then far advanced they turned back, wintered at Igloolik (lat. 69&deg;21' N, long. 81&deg;44' W), and came home in autumn 1823, as signs of scurvy among the crew made it inadvisable to stay. On 13 November Lyon was promoted captain, and the following year he published <span class="italic">The private journal of Captain G. F. Lyon &hellip; during the recent voyage of discovery under Captain Parry</span> (1824). In January 1824 he was appointed to the <i>Griper</i>, which had been on Parry's first voyage of 1819. Lyon's instructions were to reach Repulse Bay by whatever route he judged best, and from it to examine the coast of the mainland westward to the point where John Franklin's voyage had ended its survey. He sailed on 6 June, but the season proved unfavourable, and he returned to England in November, to publish <span class="italic">A brief narrative of an unsuccessful attempt to reach Repulse bay through Sir Thomas Rowe's Welcome</span> (1825).<br>
<br>In June 1825 the University of Oxford conferred on Lyon an honorary DCL; and on 5 September he married Lucy Louisa (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.September 1826), elder daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9546/', "Lord Edward Fitzgerald")</script>. Shortly afterwards he went to Mexico as one of the commissioners of the English Comp&aacute;nia de Real del Monte, which mined silver there. On the voyage home his ship was wrecked at Holyhead on 14 January 1827. Most of Lyon's papers and mineral specimens were lost, as he mentions in his <span class="italic">Journal of a Residence and Tour in &hellip; Mexico</span> (2 vols., 1828). When he landed he received news of the death of his wife four months earlier. He afterwards went to South America on mining business, but finding his sight rapidly failing&#151;the result apparently of an attack of ophthalmia in Africa&#151;he set out for England to obtain medical advice. He died on board the <i>Emulous</i>, sailing from Buenos Aires, on 8 October 1832.<br>
