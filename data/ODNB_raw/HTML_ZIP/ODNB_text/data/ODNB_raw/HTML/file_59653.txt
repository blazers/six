<span class="headword">Brett,  Rosa</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Rosarius]</span>  (1829&#150;1882), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 7 December 1829 and baptized at St George's, Camberwell, Surrey, on 26 March 1830, the eldest of the five children of Captain Charles Curtis Brett (1789&#150;1865), veterinary surgeon in the 12th lancers, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pilbean (<i>b</i>. 1808/9), of Tonbridge, Kent. The artist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32054/', "John Brett (1831&#150;1902)")</script> was her brother.<br>
<br>Rosa Brett's childhood was peripatetic. Between 1833 and 1840 her father was stationed at various locations between Manchester and the south coast of England, from 1841 to 1843 in Ireland (Dublin and Dundalk), and it was not until 1846&#151;after further postings in Manchester, Nottingham, and Coventry&#151;that the family finally settled in the Maidstone area of Kent (Mrs Brett's birthplace), where Charles Brett remained permanently based in the cavalry depot. During the 1850s they occupied various addresses on the north-eastern outskirts of Maidstone&#151;at Penenden Heath, then on the Boxley Road, and from 1858 to 1860 at Lynchfield House, Detling.<br>
<br>It is not known whether Brett received art instruction but by December 1850 she was sufficiently proficient to sell a drawing. She was very close to her brother, John Brett, and frequently worked with him, even after his entry into the Royal Academy Schools in 1853. The influence on her brother of the landscape painter J. D. Harding (they met in January 1851), who encouraged working outdoors directly from nature and the scientific study of natural subject matter, and the inspiration of John Ruskin (first read by John Brett in 1852) undoubtedly filtered through to Rosa also. Both sketched in the Vale of Boxley and on the chalk hills of the north downs, trees being a favourite subject: <span class="italic">Birch Tree in our Lawn</span> (1852; exh. Maas Gallery, London, 1991) is typical of her meticulous approach. Rosa Brett suffered from recurrent illness in the 1850s and her visits to Folkestone in 1852 and to Belgium for four months in 1855 (both of which produced outdoor sketches) may well have been undertaken for health reasons. In 1858, the year in which John Brett's <span class="italic">The Stonebreaker</span> appeared at the Royal Academy, Rosa exhibited <span class="italic">The Hayloft</span> (photograph Courtauld Inst., Witt Library), an indoor scene of a cat on hay, at both the Royal Academy&#151;where it received praise from the Pre-Raphaelites&#151;and the Liverpool Academy. The picture was submitted from a Dublin address under the pseudonym Rosarius, a name she retained for exhibiting purposes until 1862.<br>
<br>In 1860 the Brett family moved to Barming Heath, a village on the western side of Maidstone, and from 1861 until <i>c</i>.1870 occupied 45 Tonbridge Road in Maidstone itself. Throughout the 1860s and 1870s&#151;they moved again, to Fant in the early 1870s and further afield, to Rochester, about 1875&#151;Brett continued to produce landscapes, in oil and watercolour: <span class="italic">In the Artist's Garden</span> (<i>c</i>.1859&#150;60; exh. &#145;Pre-Raphaelite Women Artists&#146;, Manchester City Art Gallery, 1997), <span class="italic">Heathland</span> (1879; ex Sothebys, 12 November 1992), <span class="italic">They Toil not neither do they Spin</span> (1879; ex Sothebys, 12 November 1992), and <span class="italic">Study of a Turnip Field</span> (exh. &#145;Landscape in Britain&#146;, Tate Gallery, 1973) were all executed in oil. She also painted buildings, with a Ruskinian attention to detail, examples being <span class="italic">Detling Church</span> (1858; ex Sothebys, Belgravia, 18 April 1978) and <span class="italic">The Old House at Farleigh</span> (1862; exh. &#145;Pre-Raphaelite Women Artists&#146;, Manchester City Art Gallery, 1997), a few portraits (chiefly of her family), and, increasingly, natural still lifes of plants and small animals, such as <span class="italic">A Thrush in a Horse Chestnut Tree</span> (exh. Liverpool Academy, 1860), <span class="italic">Thistles</span> (exh. RA, 1861), <span class="italic">The Field-Mice at Home</span> (exh. RA, 1867), and <span class="italic">Starling and Bluetit</span> (exh. RA, 1876). Occasional figure subjects include a richly coloured oil of two ladies in a garden (1864; ex Sothebys, 19 June 1984), one of them holding a lily, which recalls early work by Millais. Brett's paintings were not often shown: she exhibited nine at the Royal Academy (1858&#150;81), four in Liverpool (1858&#150;72), one in Manchester (1867), and two with the Society of Lady Artists (1880, 1881). Her sketchbooks, however (two of which are in the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich), and works in private collections testify to considerable industry. She remained close to her brother, John, with whom she spent occasional holidays in Wales and in 1867 visited the notorious Georgina Weldon in Beaumaris on the Isle of Anglesey; her last exhibits, in 1880 and 1881, were submitted from his studio at 38 Harley Street in London. In his diary, John described Rosa affectionately as &#145;ardent, impulsive and unbendable&#146; (entry dated 25 Dec 1858; Cordingly, 5). Brett died, unmarried, at Caterham, Surrey, on 31 January 1882.<br>
