<span class="headword">Hobart,  Vere Henry</span>, Lord Hobart  (1818&#150;1875), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born on 8 December 1818 at Welbourne, Lincolnshire, the eldest son of Augustus Edward Hobart, from 1878 Hobart-Hampden, sixth earl of Buckinghamshire (1793&#150;1885), and his first wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1825), daughter of John Williams, serjeant-at-law; his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13398/', "Augustus Charles Hobart-Hampden")</script>, was a naval officer and adviser to the Turkish fleet. Vere studied under Dr Mayo at Cheam School, Surrey, and in 1836 won an open scholarship to Trinity College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1840 with a second in classics.<br>
<br>In March 1842 Hobart took up a clerkship procured for him in the Board of Trade by Lord Ripon and later the same year accompanied Sir Henry Ellis as secretary on a diplomatic mission to Brazil. In 1849, on his father's accession to the earldom, he took the courtesy title of Lord Hobart. In 1853 he married Mary Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1914), daughter of Thomas Carr, a former bishop of Bombay. They were a close couple and throughout their married life Hobart rehearsed his many political theories and proposals with his wife prior to placing them before the public.<br>
<br>Hobart took a keen interest in the anti-cornlaw movement and, although from a protectionist background, by 1845 he had swung round to an unflinching belief in free trade and minimal government. In 1850, frustrated in his parliamentary ambitions by a lack of money, he began to publish political articles, initially on Irish topics. He bemoaned the expenditure on public works during the famine as a criminal waste of capital and argued that Ireland's problems lay in under-development, not overpopulation. Much of his writing was designed to show how a proper application of the laws of political economy could ease pauperism. For example, in 1853 he published a pamphlet urging the introduction of limited liability for companies, arguing that such legislation would aid the productive deployment of capital and nurture co-operative societies. A collection of these writings appeared in 1866 under the title <span class="italic">Political Essays</span>.<br>
<br>In 1854 Hobart became private secretary to Sir George Grey, then colonial secretary, but resigned the post early the next year in order to be able to protest against the Crimean War. In a striking letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> of 22 February 1855 he called upon the government to resist the humbug of public opinion and pull back from its over-proud and un-Christian attempt to humiliate Russia.<br>
<br>In 1861&#150;2 Hobart was dispatched on a Foreign Office mission to investigate the condition of Turkish finances, a labyrinthine undertaking in which he himself had little faith. In 1863 he resigned his Board of Trade clerkship and shortly thereafter returned to Constantinople as director-general of the Ottoman Bank. In 1872 the Gladstone government appointed him governor of Madras.<br>
<br>Inevitably Hobart was too radical for the Madras civil service and his term in office was marked by controversy. A devout Protestant, he had nevertheless long advocated religious tolerance and the abolition of the established church. In Madras his tolerance manifested itself as a desire to treat all religions even-handedly and in particular to counteract the under-representation of Muslims in government employment, a policy which led to accusations in the civil service and press that he was na&iuml;vely pro-Muslim. He was determined to expand elementary education but without increasing taxation and therefore proposed reallocating the government's existing income to give more weight to education. The government of India, however, refused to sanction any tampering with established heads of expenditure. Hobart was similarly defeated in his attempts to raise funds for major sanitary works, but he did win India Office approval for the construction of a harbour at Madras, and on this score even his critics were loud in their praise.<br>
<br>Hobart died suddenly, at Government House, Madras, of typhoid fever on 27 April 1875 and was buried in St Mary's Church, Fort St George. In 1885 Lady Hobart, who was created CI for her charitable work in India, published her late husband's <span class="italic">Essays and Miscellaneous Writings</span>, prefacing them with a biographical sketch. They had had no surviving children and in 1879 she married, secondly, Charles Coates of Bath. She died in 1914.<br>
