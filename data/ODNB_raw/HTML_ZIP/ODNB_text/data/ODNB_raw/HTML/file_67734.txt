<span class="headword">Rosenthal,  Harold David</span>  (1917&#150;1987), <span class="occ">music critic</span>, was born at 67 Knights Hill, West Norwood, London, on 30 September 1917, the son of Israel Victor Rosenthal, schoolmaster, and his wife, Leah Samuel. After attending the City of London School, he went on to University College, London, where he gained his BA in 1940 before continuing his studies at the London Institute of Education. He served as a private in the army during the Second World War, and on 7 August 1944 he married Lillah Phyllis Weiner (<i>b</i>. 1922/3), an elementary school teacher, with whom he had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>After initially pursuing his career as a teacher, Rosenthal became increasingly drawn towards music, appearing frequently as critic and lecturer. From his earliest days he was particularly attracted to opera, from 1947 to 1952 being a correspondent for the American journal <span class="italic">Opera News</span>. The turning point in his life, however, arose as a result of his meetings with the seventh earl of Harewood, with whom he shared an enthusiasm for opera and with whom he worked on the journal <span class="italic">Ballet and Opera</span> during the years 1948&#150;9. When in 1950 the journal <span class="italic">Opera</span> was founded by Harewood, Rosenthal was invited to take up the post of assistant editor. He was editor from 1953 until 1986, and thereafter editor emeritus. From 1950 to 1956 he was archivist of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, which gave him the opportunity to produce his most substantial work, <span class="italic">Two Centuries of Opera at Covent Garden</span> (1958). From 1955 to 1960 he was a correspondent for the journal <span class="italic">Musical America</span>.<br>
<br>Rosenthal played an increasingly important part in the musical and intellectual life of Britain, being a member of the Arts Council Patrons of Music Fund (1960&#150;70) and serving as chairman of the music section of the Critics' Circle of Great Britain (1965&#150;7). From 1962 he was on the council of the Friends of Covent Garden. In recognition of his services to music, in 1977 he was made a <i>cavaliere ufficiale</i> (a member of the Order of Merit of the republic of Italy), and he later became an OBE. He was an excellent speaker, being renowned as a lecturer in both Great Britain and the United States. He played an important administrative role in international festivals, particularly that of Edinburgh, and broadcast regularly for much of his life. Acquainted with many outstanding singers, conductors, and administrators, many of whom were his personal friends, he was always supportive of the younger generation to whom he gave encouragement and support. His constant enthusiasm for the world of opera manifested itself in <span class="italic">Sopranos of Today</span> (1956), <span class="italic">The Opera Bedside Book</span> (1965), <span class="italic">Great Singers of Today</span> (1966), <span class="italic">Covent Garden: a Short History</span> (1967), and his autobiography, <span class="italic">My Mad World of Opera</span> (1982). He also edited the recollections of the nineteenth-century opera manager James Henry Mapleson as <span class="italic">The Mapleson Memoirs</span> (1966), and the third edition of <span class="italic">Loewenberg's Annals of Opera</span> (1979). He collaborated with John Warrack in the writing of <span class="italic">A Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera</span>, first published in 1964.<br>
<br>However, it was as the editor of <span class="italic">Opera</span> that Rosenthal made his greatest and most lasting contribution. He combined good business sense with unflagging energy and enthusiasm, and was keenly aware of the tastes of the average opera-lover; during his period as editor the journal assumed ever-increasing importance, not only covering the British scene but also serving as a mirror of operatic events worldwide. Indeed, its coverage was remarkable, its excellent local reports embracing operatic events not only in Europe and America but in South Africa, the Soviet Union, Australia, and New Zealand. Probably no other journal played so formative a role in stimulating the interests of the public and in helping in the creation of a new operatic audience. Invariably good-natured and urbane, Rosenthal was a lover of travel and <i>haute cuisine</i> and a lifetime collector of programmes, prints, and playbills. He died in the Whittington Hospital, Islington, London, on 19 March 1987; he was survived by his wife.<br>
