<span class="headword">Clapham, Sir  Alfred William</span>  (1883&#150;1950), <span class="occ">architectural historian and archaeologist</span>, was born in Dalston, London, on 27 May 1883, the son of the Revd James Ernest Clapham, a Wesleyan minister, and his wife, Lucy Elizabeth Hutchinson. He was educated at Dulwich College and subsequently articled to the architect James Weir. After working for the <span class="roman">Victoria History of the Counties of England</span> for a number of years, in 1912 he became a member of staff of the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments (England), where he spent the rest of his working life except for the interruption of the First World War, in which he served with the Royal Sussex regiment. He was technical editor at the commission from 1918 to 1933, when he succeeded Sir George Duckworth as secretary to the commissioners. He retired in 1948.<br>
<br>Clapham was a prolific scholar. His entries in the inventories of the royal commission include buildings of all dates in the middle ages, but his greatest interest and expertise lay in the period from the late sixth century to the end of the twelfth, that is, from the introduction of the Roman church into Britain to the transition from the Romanesque style of building to the Gothic. His first article, on the foundation of Lesnes Abbey in Essex and excavations there, appeared in 1910, after which he published a large number of articles, especially on monastic churches and other buildings. His last publications were four essays published posthumously in 1952, including pieces on Tewkesbury Abbey and the cathedrals and Cistercian buildings of Ireland, while some of his guides for the then Ministry of Works continued to be reprinted into the 1970s and beyond.<br>
<br>Clapham was an architect turned historian who combined a thorough knowledge of the documents with a detailed analysis of the buildings. He worked in the tradition established by Robert Willis in the middle of the nineteenth century and developed by John Bilson. Willis brought the analysis of medieval buildings to a new level of accuracy and sophistication, while Bilson added an engineer's understanding of structure and an even more precise approach to the analysis of masonry. Clapham performed an equally valuable service for the discipline of architectural history by writing a single overview of the Anglo-Saxon and Norman periods in his <span class="italic">English Romanesque Architecture before the Conquest</span> and <span class="italic">English Romanesque Architecture after the Conquest</span>, published in 1930 and 1934 respectively, treating the subject as a narrative and not as a series of individual problems. He also had an extensive understanding of the wider European architectural context, which he put to good use in his <span class="italic">Romanesque Architecture in Western Europe</span> of 1936.<br>
<br>In addition to his work for the commission, Clapham devoted much of his time to the affairs of the Society of Antiquaries of London. He was elected a fellow in 1913, with the support of Charles Peers, William Page, and Aymer Vallance, among others; he was a council member at various times from 1922, secretary from 1929 to 1939, and president from 1939 to 1944. In 1948 he received the society's gold medal. He became a trustee of the British Museum in 1944, played a leading part in the founding of the Council for British Archaeology in 1944, and was its first president. He joined the Archaeological Institute in 1921, and served as a council member, vice-president, and president in turn, also contributing numerous entries to the programmes of the summer meetings of the institute from 1928 until the year of his death. He was appointed CBE in 1932 and was knighted in 1944. Clapham died, unmarried, at Clova Nursing Home in Ripon, Yorkshire, on 26 October 1950 and in 1952 was honoured by a memorial supplement to volume 106 of the <span class="italic">Archaeological Journal</span>, which contains a bibliography of his work and a memoir of his life by C. A. R. Radford.<br>
