<span class="headword">Kenrick family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1785&#150;1926), <span class="occ">hardware manufacturers</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_50557"></a><span class="headword">Archibald [i] Kenrick</span>  (1760&#150;1835)<span class="occ"></span>. Born in 1760 at Wynn Hall, Ruabon, Denbighshire, Archibald was the third eldest son among the seven children of John Kenrick (1725&#150;1803), a small landowner, and his wife, Mary Quarrel or Quarrell. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15415/', "Timothy Kenrick (1759&#150;1804)")</script> was his brother.<br>
<br>Archibald's first business venture, which commenced when he moved to Birmingham during the mid-1780s, was in the buckle trade with a distant relation who, like Archibald, was a Unitarian. After acquiring a knowledge of plating, Archibald was able in 1787, with financial support from his father, to enter into partnership with another buckle maker. However, when buttons and laces began to replace buckles Archibald turned to the hardware trade. The finance for this change of direction came from the dowry he received from his father-in-law, Joseph Smith of Staffordshire, on his marriage to Rebecca Smith (1770&#150;1809) in December 1790. In 1791 Archibald set up an iron foundry business in West Bromwich which produced cast ironmongery, beginning with coffee mills, door furniture, cast nails, and mole traps, supplying households and the building trade.<br>
<br>Through patented technical improvements, litigation, and collusion, and by close attention to quality and appearance, which depended on careful control of casting and variation in finishes, Kenrick's tinned hollowware established a reputation for lightweight, attractive, and hygienic cooking utensils of a quality and at a price that enabled them virtually to replace &#145;black&#146;, or untinned, hollowware and to compete with similar vessels made from copper or brass. Growing sales of coffee mills, tinned light cast-iron hollowware, and nails were obtained from an increased asset base and a rise in the number of workers employed, counted in tens before 1815 but in two or three hundreds by the time of Archibald's death on 6 November 1835. Little is known about Archibald's life outside the business. He was a supporter of the Sunday school movement and of the diffusion of knowledge among workers. He established a works library and a savings society for his employees. In 1812 he married his second wife, Mary Eddowes (1763&#150;1854). There were four sons and three daughters from his two marriages.<br>
<br>Archibald's death left two of his sons, <a name="cosubject_59295"></a><span class="headword">Archibald [ii] Kenrick</span>  (1798&#150;1878)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_59296"></a><span class="headword">Timothy Kenrick</span>  (1807&#150;1885)<span class="occ"></span>, in possession of equal shares in the partnership. Both were educated at private academies, after which Archibald [ii] studied mechanics in Birmingham while Timothy was apprenticed, probably in the iron trade. Archibald [ii] married Ann (<i>d</i>. 1864), daughter of William Paget, a Unitarian and banker of Leicestershire, whose loans aided the Kenrick enterprise. The couple had four sons and three daughters. The ill health of Archibald and Timothy's extensive business activities outside the firm meant that their involvement in the day-to-day management of the firm declined during the third quarter of the century. Timothy served as chairman of Lloyds Bank, and was a founder of the Nurses' Training Institution in Birmingham, for which he purchased a home. Timothy was married to Maria Paget (1808&#150;1876), and the couple had three sons and six daughters. Archibald [ii] died at Berrow Court, Edgbaston, Birmingham, on 10 March 1878. His brother Timothy died on 23 February 1885 at Maple Bank, Birmingham. Their successors were <a name="cosubject_59297"></a><span class="headword">John Arthur Kenrick</span>  (1829&#150;1926)<span class="occ"></span>, the eldest son of Archibald [ii], who joined the company in 1848, and from 1850 his brother <a name="cosubject_59298"></a><span class="headword">William Kenrick</span>  (1831&#150;1919)<span class="occ"></span>, who in 1857 became a full partner together with his father, brother, and Timothy. The commercial success of Timothy's 1846 patent for glazing and enamelling the metal surfaces of cast iron led to investment and the growth of home and overseas sales. On incorporation in 1883, still owned and controlled by the family, Archibald Kenrick &amp; Sons Ltd employed roughly 700 workers and was capitalized at &pound;201,700. Capital was increased to &pound;301,700 in 1899, by which time employment had almost doubled since 1883. As one of the two largest British hardware manufacturers, the company had reached its peak.<br>
<br>John Arthur Kenrick was educated at a private school in Handsworth, the Edgbaston proprietary school, and the Hove School. When he was eighteen his father's illness compelled him to withdraw from University College, London, to assist Timothy in the family firm. After similar schooling, William's studies of mathematics and chemistry at University College were completed with distinction. While John Arthur took responsibility for production, William's contribution was in commercial management, though between 1872 and 1911 John Arthur was chairman of the Cast Iron Hollowware Manufacturers' Association which regulated price competition in the home market. From the 1860s both Kenrick brothers became increasingly engaged in other business ventures and in public affairs. John Arthur continued as chairman of the company until 1898, though from the entry into the firm in 1873 of his successor, George Hamilton Kenrick (1850&#150;1939), cousin to the two senior partners, the day-to-day commercial management became his responsibility. After 1868 production management was delegated to Frederick Ryland, a professional engineer who was also the first non-family manager (and from 1883 director) employed in the family firm. John Arthur became a director and chairman of both Nettlefolds Ltd and William Elliott &amp; Sons Ltd, and a director of Lloyds Bank and of the Union Rolling Stock Company. In 1878 he bought the <span class="italic">West Bromwich Free Press</span> with the intention of restoring its fortunes; this purchase led to the formation of Kenrick and Jefferson, which became a commercial printer on a large scale.<br>
<br>In their public activities, John Arthur and William continued the family tradition. Archibald [ii] had been chairman of the board of commissioners and of the local Liberal Party in West Bromwich. Timothy, too, was a Liberal, both were Unitarians, supported the Education League, and together built a school for the children of local workers. Archibald [ii] was chairman of the Provident Medical Dispensary from 1864, while Timothy was involved in the management of Birmingham General Hospital and a founder of the Nurses' Training Institution. In 1858 the brothers purchased Aston Hall and Park as a place for public recreation.<br>
<br>John Arthur's public activities were concentrated in West Bromwich where he became chairman of the board of guardians, of the highway board, and later of the improvement committee which governed the town's development between 1866 and 1882. He was also president of the West Bromwich Liberal Association. In 1866 he married Clara, daughter of the Revd John Taylor; they had four sons and four daughters. He died at Berrow Court, Edgbaston, Birmingham, on 23 April 1926.<br>
<br>William's public life centred upon Birmingham. In 1862 he married Mary Chamberlain, the elder sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32350/', "Joseph Chamberlain")</script>, with whom William became a close political ally. Kenrick and his wife had two sons and two daughters. William's sister Harriet was the first wife of Joseph Chamberlain, and his cousin Florence Kenrick the second wife. A member of the Education League from 1866, in 1869 William represented one of four Unitarian business families, the others being the Nettlefolds, the Martineaus, and the Chamberlains, who together contributed a total of &pound;5000 to launch the National Educational League. Under Joseph Chamberlain's leadership this organization spearheaded the campaign to transform Birmingham nonconformity into a militant, reforming force on a national scale. Between 1866 and 1877 William was also a member of the council of the Midland Institute, though his special interest in technical education was reflected in membership of the managing committee of the Birmingham School of Art, inaugurated in 1874, of which he became chairman in 1883. He was also instrumental in setting up the Jewellers' School and in creating scholarships to promote craft education.<br>
<br>William was chairman of the general committee of the National Liberal Federation from 1882 to 1886 and became MP for North Birmingham in 1885. Before then his public life was dominated by activities related to Birmingham politics. He represented the Edgbaston ward between 1870 and 1911, becoming mayor in 1877. He was a central figure in the progressive, reforming campaigns mounted by the group of predominantly nonconformist businessmen and Liberal town councillors led by Joseph Chamberlain. He was chairman of the watch committee from 1874 to 1876, and of the gas committee from 1880 to 1883, when he assumed responsibility for the continued success of this municipal enterprise, the profitability of which was planned to underpin a civic revolution, transform the urban environment, and enrich the town's cultural and recreational endowments. Progress towards these goals was assisted further by William's position as a member of the free libraries committee and chairman of the museum and school of art committee from 1884, when the school was transferred to the corporation, until 1911. His contribution to museum development began in 1880 when he was a founder member of the Art Gallery purchase committee; from then on donations of pictures and money for further acquisitions enhanced the national reputation of Birmingham Art Gallery. On the national political stage, he was chairman of the general committee of the National Liberal Federation between 1882 and 1886. Between 1885 and 1899 he was the liberal, and subsequently Liberal Unionist, MP for North Birmingham, his contribution at Westminster deriving mainly from his knowledge and experience of local government. In 1911 William received the freedom of the city of Birmingham, an acknowledgement of his role as one of the architects of the social and political character of modern Birmingham. He died on 31 July 1919 at The Grove, Harborne Park Road, Harborne, Birmingham. Later chairmen of the company included Sir George Hamilton Kenrick (1850&#150;1936), Wilfrid Byng Kenrick (1872&#150;1962), and Wilfrid's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48731/', "William Edmund Kenrick")</script>.<br>
<br>The hardware manufacturing business founded by Archibald [i] Kenrick in the mid-1780s had, a century later, become one of the two largest firms of its kind in the country. Successive members of the family, through technical innovation and shrewd marketing, established a reputation for its light and attractive cast-iron hollowware and hardware. Retaining their Unitarian affiliation, the Kenricks were active in local Liberal politics, and were significant civic and philanthropic figures in the Birmingham and West Bromwich areas.<br>
