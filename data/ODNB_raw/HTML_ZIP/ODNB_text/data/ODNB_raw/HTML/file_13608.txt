</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Holroyd,  John Baker</span>, first earl of Sheffield  (1735&#150;1821), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 21 December 1735, the second son of Isaac Holroyd (1707&#150;1778), a lawyer, and his wife, Dorothy Baker (<i>d</i>. 1777). A later birth date of 1741 was given in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1821), and Holroyd was said in one source to be aged twenty-five at the time of his first marriage in May 1767 (quoted in GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 11.665); however, the 1735 date is confirmed by his memorial inscription. Holroyd's father was from a Yorkshire family which had settled in Ireland in the seventeenth century. Holroyd was educated at Dr Ford's school in Dublin and may have contemplated an army career, since he was a cornet in the 21st dragoons in 1760 and captain by the end of 1761. His prospects changed when his elder brother Daniel was killed in 1762, and after the war he began a long continental tour. In 1768 he succeeded to the estates of his mother's brother, the Revd Jones Baker, and took the name Baker before Holroyd. The following year he purchased Sheffield Park in Sussex for &pound;31,000. Much of his fortune he devoted to the improvement of his estate: he employed James Wyatt to rebuild the house in gothick and Capability Brown and Humphry Repton to lay out the park. On 26 May 1767 he married his first wife, Abigail Way (<i>bap</i>. 1746, <i>d</i>. 1793), the daughter of Lewis Way of Richmond, and the sister of Benjamin Way MP.<br>
<br>Holroyd's friendship with Edward Gibbon commenced at Lausanne in September 1763. Gibbon's first impression was that his new acquaintance was &#145;tr&egrave;s suffisant&#146; (&#145;very self-important&#146;), but soon he took to him  (<span class="italic">Le journal</span>, 21). They remained fast friends and were both buried in Fletching church, near Sheffield Park. Gibbon leaned heavily on Holroyd's business acumen, in return offering Holroyd sensible advice (rarely taken) on political questions. Holroyd was a small, restless, ambitious man. His wide circle of friends included William Eden (later Lord Auckland), John Foster (later Lord Oriel), a prominent member of the Irish House of Commons, and Alexander Wedderburn, later lord chancellor. Despite lecturing his friends on their political blunders, Holroyd remained on good terms with most of them, and a stream of visitors made their way to Sheffield Park.<br>
<br>Holroyd's first attempt to enter parliament was in 1774 for Sussex. Gibbon advised against: &#145;I cannot yet think you ripe for a county member &hellip; Five years are very little to remove the obvious objection of a <i>novus homo</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Edward Gibbon</span>, 2.26). Holroyd put forward his name but was obliged to withdraw. He remained anxious to play a public role, and when the American war broke out raised a regiment of light dragoons (the 22nd or Sussex regiment) and became colonel. A posting to Coventry made him familiar with the politics of that turbulent borough, and he resolved to stand at a by-election in February 1780. Once more Gibbon advised caution: a general election was due and holding the seat would be difficult and expensive. Holroyd was returned unopposed and entered parliament determined to make his mark, &#145;indefatigable and eager&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Edward Gibbon</span>, 2.241). Perhaps he overdid it. Having been returned on 15 February, on 17 March he moved that Temple Luttrell's attack on Lord North for corruption at Milborne Port was &#145;ill-founded and injurious&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 21, 1780, 292). Although his motion was carried, so prominent an action from a brand new member was unbecoming, and in his next speech Holroyd admitted ruefully that &#145;the part he had taken in the Milborne Port business&#146;  (ibid., 21, 1780, 335) had been held against him. But before the general election his stock had risen dramatically. When Lord George Gordon's monster petition was presented to parliament in June 1780, with the protestant mob howling outside, Holroyd dogged Gordon, prevented him from inciting his supporters, and threatened to run him through if any attempt was made to storm the building. In the savage rioting in London that followed, Holroyd, &#145;among the flames with the Northumberland militia&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Edward Gibbon</span>, 2.243), defended the bank from assault.<br>
<br>The contest for Coventry which Gibbon had predicted took place at the general election in October 1780, when North's government found &pound;2000 towards Holroyd's expenses. The campaign was riotous, the poll interrupted, but Holroyd was seated on petition. The reward for his exertions, political and military, was an Irish peerage&#151;he became first Baron Sheffield of Dunamore in January 1781&#151;that allowed him to retain his Commons seat. He was acquiring a reputation also in economic questions: his attack upon Pitt's proposal to relax the navigation laws (&#145;the palladium of Britain&#146;) against the new United States of America was widely reported and issued as a pamphlet. Sheffield supported the Fox&#150;North coalition and was granted a new Irish barony in September 1783 with succession to his two daughters, since his only son had died aged five. His attitude was always quasi-independent, but in the tense spring of 1784, when the coalition's majority was melting, he wrote to Eden to deny any intention of ratting: &#145;you seem to be a little suspicious of me, but it is exactly the moment &hellip; when according to my nature, it is impossible to be off&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal and Correspondence of &hellip; Auckland</span>, 1.71&#150;2). Pitt's government sponsored an attack upon his position at Coventry at the general election, and he lost his seat, &#145;swept away in the general unpopularity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Edward Gibbon</span>, 2.405).<br>
<br>Out of parliament from 1784 until 1790, Sheffield gave independent support to the opposition. He attacked Pitt's commercial propositions in a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Observations on the Manufactures, Trade and Present State of Ireland</span> (1785). His precocious daughter Maria wrote in March 1786: &#145;I went last Thursday to my first play &hellip; Papa was too busy importing and exporting to think of such things&#146;  (Holroyd, <span class="italic">Girlhood</span>, 12). His strong opinion that black slavery was essential for the cultivation of Britain's sugar islands suggested a possible political home at Bristol, which had grown rich on the slave trade. In the spring of 1790 he published <span class="italic">Observations on the Project for Abolishing the Slave Trade</span> and at the June general election was returned after only a token contest. &#145;The duties of a Bristol member&#146;, wrote Gibbon, &#145;which would kill me in the first session, would supply your activity with a constant fund of amusement&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Edward Gibbon</span>, 3.192).<br>
<br>Like most of the remaining Northites, Sheffield gravitated towards government as the French Revolution unfolded. Its violence agitated him greatly&#151;France was &#145;the vilest of all nations&#146; he told the Commons in 1792  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 80, 1792, 81)&#151;and he and his wife spent much time helping French refugees. In 1793 the government found employment for him on the new board of agriculture and as chairman of the commission to issue exchequer bills. But he pined for greater recognition. Wedderburn, now Lord Loughborough, reported to Eden that Sheffield was convinced that &#145;until he is more consulted things will always go wrong&#146;. &#145;He is of a very active, bustling temper and turn of mind&#146;, wrote Sylvester Douglas, &#145;but I fear he has mistaken that turn for genius&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>).<br>
<br>In 1796 Sheffield was returned top of the poll at Bristol and resumed his idiosyncratic support of government, for he disliked many of its financial proposals. His opinion of the proposed union with Ireland fluctuated, but on 22 April 1799 he spoke strongly in favour of the principle, publishing his speech as another pamphlet. After the sudden death of his first wife, on 3 April 1793, he married twice more into political families. On 26 December 1794 he married Lucy Pelham (1763&#150;1797), the daughter of Thomas Pelham, first earl of Chichester, and Anne Frankland, and the sister of Thomas Pelham, a Sussex neighbour and chief secretary for Ireland. His third wife, whom he married on 20 January 1798, was Lady Anne North (1764&#150;1832), one of the daughters of Lord North and Anne Speke; they had two children, including the much wanted son. After Gibbon's death in 1794, Sheffield began the task of editing his <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works</span>, among them the autobiography (1796), treating the text with great freedom.<br>
<br>Sheffield's campaign for promotion continued unabated. In 1801 he asked for the presidency of the Board of Trade, observing that &#145;I have some reputation with the public from John o' Groats to the Land's end on several subjects&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>). Importunity triumphed in 1802 when Addington recommended a United Kingdom peerage, and he was created Baron Sheffield of Sheffield, in the county of York. The following year he was made president of the board of agriculture, a post he held until 1806. His ambition merely whetted, he pressed for an Irish earldom, which he obtained in 1816. In 1806 he begged Grenville to appoint him to the Board of Trade. Eden's comment was deadly:<blockquote>Though he is friendly, honourable, well-informed and sedulous &hellip; those qualities alone are not sufficient to facilitate the business of a Board which is in danger of being overwhelmed by the variety of applications crowding into it. That business can only be kept down and efficiently discharged by quiet consideration and enquiry such as to authorize prompt decisions, without being exposed to eternal discussions about the navigation laws, and long reasonings (and &#145;rechauff&eacute;es&#146;) from pamphlets. (<span class="italic">Fortescue MSS</span>, 8.29)</blockquote>In 1809 Sheffield was at last admitted to the privy council and the Board of Trade, and he held office until his death. His stream of pamphlets continued to the end, one on the corn laws in 1815, another on the poor laws in 1819. His last intervention in the Lords was in November 1820, and he died at his home in Portland Place, London, on 30 May 1821, aged eighty-five. He was buried in the family mausoleum at Fletching church, near Sheffield Park, the following month.<br>
