<span class="headword">Burnett, Sir  Charles Stuart</span>  (1882&#150;1945), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born at Brown's Valley, Minnesota, United States of America, on 3 April 1882, the second of the four sons of John Alexander Burnett (1852&#150;1935), a landowner, of Kemnay, Aberdeenshire, and his wife, Charlotte Susan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gordon (<i>d</i>. 1925). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32189/', "Admiral Sir Robert Lindsay Burnett")</script> was his younger brother. After attending Bedford School, at the age of seventeen Burnett enlisted to fight in the South African War, claiming to be a year older than he was. He joined the 8th company of the imperial yeomanry, from which he was discharged in 1901 to enable him to take a commission in the Highland light infantry. He was then employed with the imperial yeomanry once more, before secondment in 1904 to the West African Frontier Force; he fought in Northern Nigeria, and was twice mentioned in dispatches. In October 1907 he was promoted lieutenant, but resigned his commission in 1909 to run a small retail business in Portuguese Guinea. This venture was not particularly successful, and Burnett entered government service in 1911, serving as the assistant resident in Northern Nigeria.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the First World War Burnett rejoined the army, but not with his old regiment, choosing instead to become a member of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). He qualified as a pilot in November 1914, and before his first posting married, on 30 November, Sybil Maud Pack-Beresford (<i>b</i>. 1882/3), whose previous marriage had been dissolved; she was the daughter of John Bell, an ironmaster of Saltburn, Yorkshire. Burnett was sent to 17 squadron in the Middle East, and in February 1915 became a flight commander. Command of a squadron followed in April 1916, this time with 12 squadron in France. Promotion to temporary lieutenant-colonel in October 1917 saw Burnett take command of the RFC's fifth wing in Palestine. Burnett was appointed to the Distinguished Service Order following the capture of Jerusalem in December 1917, and was made a CBE in 1919. He was offered, and accepted, a permanent commission as a wing commander in the Royal Air Force.<br>
<br>In 1920 Burnett commanded the RAF in Iraq, then returned to the United Kingdom the following year for a variety of appointments, beginning as station commander, with the rank of group captain, at RAF Leuchars. A spell at the Air Ministry as deputy director of operations and intelligence was followed by command of the Central Flying School for two years from January 1927. Once this posting was completed, Burnett returned to Iraq for another two years' duty, this time as the senior staff officer in the country, leading a return flight from Basrah to Muscat, in flying boats, in May 1929. In January 1931 he was again in the United Kingdom to take up the position of director of operations and intelligence at the Air Ministry, at the same time becoming deputy chief of the air staff. Promotion to air vice-marshal followed in July 1931, but his time in Britain was relatively brief, since in November 1932 he was sent to become air officer commanding, British forces in Iraq. The period was marked by the need to suppress various tribal incursions near Kuwait, during the course of which Burnett was wounded. He returned to Britain in 1935, taking command of the Inland Area. A major reorganization of the RAF in 1936 saw the Inland Area become Training Command: Burnett was promoted air marshal in January 1936 and became air officer commanding-in-chief in May 1936, when he received a knighthood (KCB). As the threat from Hitler's Germany increased, the demands placed upon Training Command were notable. Burnett was posted out of that key position in July 1939, when he was made inspector-general of the RAF.<br>
<br>By the outbreak of war Burnett's health had declined, and he was due for retirement; this was postponed as a result of events in Australia. The Australian prime minister, Robert Menzies, decided that a British officer should take over as chief of the air staff of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). After some discussions with the British government, it was agreed to appoint Burnett to this post, in the rank of air chief marshal. The decision to appoint a British officer ahead of an Australian one was particularly controversial, and this did not help Burnett's cause. Many members of the RAAF were openly resentful of his appointment, and Burnett's actions while in post were the source of some controversy later.<br>
<br>Burnett saw his prime task as being to increase the ability of the RAAF to provide aircrew to the RAF. He sought to do this through the medium of the empire air training scheme. The scheme was enormously successful in producing trained aircrew, but proved controversial. Many Australians felt that the scheme would undermine their nation's identity. Burnett was not persuaded, however, taking the view that victory in Europe demanded the exploitation of the whole British empire; as a result, he set about creating a structure that would produce 50,000 men by March 1943. The focus on Europe meant that the RAAF was lacking in numbers when facing the threat of invasion by the Japanese.<br>
<br>This situation did little to commend Burnett to the newly appointed Australian minister for air, A. S. Drakeford, and their relationship was particularly stormy. Burnett's proposed major organizational changes to the RAAF, most notably the abolition of the RAAF's air board, proved to be too much for the Australian government, and Burnett was replaced in May 1942 as the threat from the Japanese increased. Despite the criticisms levelled against him, Burnett had overseen an enormous expansion in the strength of the RAAF&#151;the service had just 3489 men before the start of the war, while by the time of Burnett's departure there were nearly 80,000 service personnel. This achievement has been largely overshadowed by the controversial nature of Burnett's tenure. Not only was he imposed upon the RAAF when it appeared that equally capable Australian alternatives existed, but Burnett's focus upon the empire air training scheme has added to the generally ambivalent&#151;and sometimes hostile&#151;attitude towards him in histories of the RAAF.<br>
<br>After his departure, Burnett was placed on the retired list, as had been planned, but in 1943 he was recalled to duty as the commandant of the Air Training Corps. He continued to serve the air force, even though his health was declining. On 9 April 1945 he died of coronary thrombosis while in the Princess Mary Hospital at Halton Camp, Wendover, Buckinghamshire. He was survived by his wife and four daughters.<br>
