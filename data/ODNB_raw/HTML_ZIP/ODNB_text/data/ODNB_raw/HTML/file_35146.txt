<span class="headword">Mullins,  Edwin Roscoe</span>  (1848&#150;1907), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, born at 1 Great James Street, Bedford Row, Holborn, London, on 22 August 1848, was a younger son and sixth child in a family of five sons and three daughters of Edward Mullins (<i>d</i>. in or before 1884) of Box, Wiltshire, solicitor, and his wife, Elizabeth Baker. After being educated at Louth grammar school and Marlborough College (1863&#150;5), Mullins was trained in the art schools of Lambeth and the Royal Academy, and in the workshop of John Birnie Philip. Between 1866 and 1874 he studied under Professor Wagm&uuml;ller at Munich, where he shared a studio with Edward Onslow Ford. He gained a silver medal at Munich and a bronze medal at Vienna for a group entitled <span class="italic">Sympathy</span> exhibited in 1872. He was a regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy, the Grosvenor Gallery, and the New Gallery from 1874 onwards. He was best known for his ideal works. These were criticized by Walter Armstrong for their &#145;coldness&#146;  (Armstrong, 142) but admired by other contemporary critics for their simplicity and restraint. There are two examples in the Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow: <span class="italic">Morn Waked by the Circling of the Hours</span> (marble; dated 1887) and <span class="italic">Isaac and Esau: Bless Me, Even Me Also, O My Father</span> (marble; dated 1904).<br>
<br>Mullins executed many portraits including busts of Dr Martineau (1878); W. G. Grace (1887); the Rt Hon. C. T. Ritchie (1889), and Sir Evelyn Wood (1896), among others, which he exhibited at the Royal Academy. He executed statuettes of W. E. Gladstone (1878); Val Prinsep ARA (exh. RA, 1880); Sir Rowland Hill, and Edmund Yates (1878). His public statues include those of General Barrow (marble; 1882) for the senate house of Lucknow; Henry VII (stone; 1883) for King's College, Cambridge; and William Barnes, the Dorset poet (1887), for Dorchester. His most unusual work was the circus horse in Brighton cemetery, executed in 1893 as a memorial to Mr Ginnett, a well-known circus owner. Mullins married on 4 June 1884 Alice (1856&#150;<i>c</i>.1936), daughter of John Pelton JP, of Croydon. They had one daughter and three sons, the eldest of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54197/', "Claud William Mullins")</script>.<br>
<br>Mullins was particularly interested in architectural sculpture. He told the Royal Institute of British Architects:<blockquote>We may note the tendency of sculpture when separated from architecture, in the popular form it takes at exhibition, to develop into a species of bric-a-brac. &hellip; Too often the work, when done, is only suitable to become part of a rich man's collection of treasures, that only the few can possess, rather than fitted to the nation as a whole as it could do if it were executed for public buildings. (Beattie, 46)</blockquote>The most important surviving examples of his architectural decoration are the pediment of the Harris Museum and Art Gallery, Preston, Lancashire, and five decorative relief panels for Braithwaite Hall, Croydon Municipal Buildings (1896).<br>
<br>He published a practical guide to sculpture techniques entitled <span class="italic">A Primer of Sculpture</span> in 1890 and was appointed teacher of modelling, with special reference to architectural decoration, at the new Central School of Arts and Crafts in 1896. Mullins died at Shirley, Walberswick, Suffolk, on 9 January 1907, aged fifty-eight. His remains after cremation at Golders Green were buried at Hendon Park.<br>
