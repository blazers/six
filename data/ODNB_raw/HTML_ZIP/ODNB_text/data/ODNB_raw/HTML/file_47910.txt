<span class="headword">Maudslay,  Reginald Walter</span>  (1871&#150;1934), <span class="occ">motor vehicle manufacturer</span>, was born on 1 September 1871 at 14 Oxford Square, Paddington, the son of Athol Edward Maudslay, gentleman, and his wife, Kate, daughter of Sir Thomas Lucas, founder of a large firm of building contractors. His great-grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18357/', "Henry Maudslay")</script>, pioneer of marine engine building. Reginald Maudslay was educated at St David's School in Moffat, Scotland, and Marlborough College. He then secured an apprenticeship, and later an assistantship, with Sir John Wolfe Barry's London firm of civil engineers. During this period Maudslay became involved in a number of major engineering projects, from the planning and construction of Barry Dock to a survey of the West Highland Railway.<br>
<br>In 1902 Maudslay abandoned his civil engineering career and, with financial support from Wolfe Barry and others, moved to Coventry where he leased a small workshop for experimental purposes. In the following year he established the Standard Motor Company in larger premises in Much Park Street from where he was able to indulge his long-time passion of motor cars. Reginald's cousin, Cyril Maudslay, was at this time managing director of the nearby Maudslay Motor Company and it may have been this family link which precipitated the move from London. The title of his cousin's firm prevented Maudslay from using the family name to identify his own vehicles. The adoption of the Standard marque appears to have been influenced by the Roman standard which adorned the lounge of Maudslay's house. Standard became a public limited company in 1914, but for most of the period from its establishment to Maudslay's death in 1934 the company was under the control of its founder.<br>
<br>By 1913 Standard was one of Coventry's largest motor manufacturers with an output of some 750 vehicles per annum. During the First World War the company responded to government overtures by diversifying into airframes and aero-engines, producing in particular the Bristol Sopwith Pup fighter. This expansion of activities necessitated the purchase of 30 acres of land at nearby Canley in 1915, with a further 110 acres being acquired in 1918. Standard experienced a number of problems in the 1920s with some serious financial setbacks and a six-year period without dividends. The situation was reversed in the 1930s, partly as a result of the reorganization of production initiated by Maudslay's successor as managing director, John Paul Black, so that by 1939 Standard was responsible for almost 13 per cent of the total output of the &#145;Big Six&#146; motor manufacturers, compared with 5.1 per cent at the start of the decade.<br>
<br>Maudslay married on 30 January 1908 Susan Gwendolen (<i>b</i>. 1881/2), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Herbert; they had two sons and a daughter. Little is known about his private life, but he acquired the reputation of a country gentleman and was fond of inspecting the shop floor wearing a deerstalker hat and matching overcoat. Maudslay's particular contribution to motor vehicle engineering and design is also little known, though he is credited with inventing the side-entry car body in place of the tonneau, as well as the all-weather body and the Starlite sliding roof. Standard's recurring financial problems suggest that Maudslay's business judgement was sometimes at fault. In 1927, for example, he allowed the company to become over-committed in the Australian market which led eventually to the firm sustaining heavy losses. However, he also had the foresight to purchase the Canley properties, begin the move into volume production and, crucially, to recognize the talent of John Black. His other important legacy to the firm was a paternalistic and welfarist style of management which included the creation of a hardship fund for Standard workers and the provision of numerous recreational facilities at the Canley works.<br>
<br>After a short illness, Maudslay died at Beaumont House, Beaumont Street, Marylebone, London, on 14 December 1934, survived by his wife. He was buried at Sherbourne.<br>
