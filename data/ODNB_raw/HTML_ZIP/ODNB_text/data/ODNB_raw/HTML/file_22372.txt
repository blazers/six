<span class="headword">Playfere,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1562&#150;1609), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the second son of William Playfere (<i>d</i>. 1596) and his wife, Alice, of Hawkehurst, Kent, although university records indicate that he had links with London; a portrait of 1597 indicates that he was then thirty-five, or in his thirty-fifth year. He matriculated pensioner of St John's College, Cambridge, in December 1576, was admitted scholar on 5 November 1579, graduated BA in 1580, proceeded MA in 1583, and was elected fellow on 10 April 1584. His college offices included Linacre lecturer in medicine (1588), preacher (1591&#150;2), and Hebrew praelector (1593&#150;4). He proceeded BD in 1590 and DD in 1595, and was elected Lady Margaret professor of divinity in December 1596, having been incorporated at Oxford that year.<br>
<br>Playfere credited his university education to Sir George Carey, knight marshal. He established a reputation as a brilliant orator and preacher. In 1592 Thomas Nashe (also under the patronage of Carey and a former member of St John's) called him &#145;mellifluous PLAYFERE&#146;, adding:<blockquote>I cannot bethinke mee of two in England in all things comparable to him for is time. Seldome have I beheld so pregnant a pleasaunt wit coupled with a memorie of such huge incomprehensible receipt, deepe reading and delight better mixt than in his Sermons. (<span class="italic">Works of Thomas Nashe</span>, 1.314)</blockquote>Playfere's prose makes extravagant use of rhetorical devices, thematic imagery, and allegory. It was sometimes judged excessive; in his <span class="italic">Directions for Speech and Style</span> (1599) John Hoskins warned of the over-use of antithesis by citing how Playfere used it &#145;thirty times in one sermon&#146;. Evidence of his style's popularity can be seen in the pirated publication of Playfere's sermon preached at St Mary's Hospital, London, in Easter week 1595; several authorized editions subsequently appeared as <span class="italic">The Meane in Mourning</span> (1596, 1597). Thomas Fuller testified to his reputation as a fluent Latinist, something corroborated by Francis Bacon's choice of him to translate his <span class="italic">Advancement of Learning</span> (1605) from English to Latin.<br>
<br>Doctrinally Playfere was a Calvinist: in his 1600 commencement oration he sharply refuted John Overall's anti-Calvinism. Playfere seems to have been ambitious to a fault. He was re-elected to his professorship until his death, but by increasingly slim margins. In 1599 he unsuccessfully petitioned courtiers for support of his candidacy for the mastership of Clare College; in 1605 the fellows of Pembroke College, Cambridge, protested against Playfere's designs for election as their master; and in 1608 he sought Viscount Cranborne's assistance in securing his last re-election as Lady Margaret professor. The large number of Playfere's sermons preached before James and his court suggests that he may have been made a chaplain-in-ordinary after 1603; the prince of Wales's feathers added to his portrait suggest service to Prince Henry. He was granted the crown living of Cheam, Surrey, in 1605, allegedly through Lord Chancellor Ellesmere; in 1608 he was presented to the rectory of Shipdham, Norfolk, by Sir Henry Gawdy.<br>
<br>From 1602 Playfare suffered from a recurring mental disorder. John Chamberlain gossiped in November 1602 that &#145;Dr. Plaifer &hellip; is lately crackt in the headpeece&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 1.169), and John Manningham noted in December &#145;that Playfare hath bin halfe frantike again, and strangely doted for one Mrs. Hammond, a gentlewoman in Kent&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of John Manningham</span>, 155). On 13 March 1603 Playfere married Alice Grinling at Dickleburgh, Norfolk. By June 1608 his mind had failed again, and a deputy delivered his commencement address. He died intestate in Cambridge on 1 February 1609, and was buried in St Botolph's, Cambridge, on 3 February. His widow, who was granted administration of his estate, erected a monument there with Playfere's bust and a panegyric Latin epitaph. John Hacket recalled how his &#145;greatest well-wishers did not wish him alive again, because his rarely beautified Wits &hellip; were now more and more distermper'd&#146;. John Williams pronounced a funeral oration in Playfere's style in St John's, after which &#145;it was in every Mouth, that Playferes Eloquence was not dead&#146;  (Hacket, 10). Several sermons appeared separately after his death, and reprints and collected editions continued until the civil war; the most complete is <span class="italic">The Whole Sermons</span> (1623).<br>
