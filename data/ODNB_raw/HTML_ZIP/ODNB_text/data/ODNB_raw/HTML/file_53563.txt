<span class="headword">Gilstrap, Sir  William</span>, baronet  (1816&#150;1896), <span class="occ">maltster</span>, was born on 20 December 1816 at The Hotel, Kirkgate, Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, the eldest surviving son of the eight children of Joseph Gilstrap (1785&#150;1869), wine merchant and maltster, and his first wife, Elizabeth, second daughter of William Welsh, of Leake, Lancashire. William and his brother George (1822&#150;1864) were educated locally before joining the family business. William worked initially in the wine trade, but was soon attracted to his father's newest venture, malting.<br>
<br>Situated on the River Trent, and at the heart of prime barley land, Newark had for long been an important malting centre, but the coming of the railways and the parallel expansion of the brewing industry in Burton upon Trent underpinned a rapid rise in the demand for malt. Few exploited the new opportunities better than Gilstrap. The first malting was purchased in 1834. Eight years later, Gilstrap &amp; Sons acquired the substantial business of William Brodhurst, with maltings at Newark and Mansfield. Large modern maltings were built at Newark, and others leased at Lincoln, Retford, Wakefield, and Grimsby. Then in 1880, after the death of its senior partner, George Harvey, Gilstrap acquired the Newark business of Harvey and Earp. The new partnership of Gilstrap, Earp &amp; Co. (of which Thomas Earp became managing partner), producing around 100,000 quarters of malt a year, was the largest in Britain. In the jubilee honours of 1887, Gilstrap was created a baronet for his services to the malting industry.<br>
<br>Gilstrap was enterprising and ambitious. He remained as senior partner in Gilstrap, Earp &amp; Co. until his death in 1896 but, from the 1860s, adopted the lifestyle of a landowning gentleman. In 1847 he married Elizabeth (1822&#150;1891), fourth daughter of Thomas Haigh of Colnebridge House, Huddersfield, and lived in some style in South Parade, Newark. Eight years later he purchased a country house and 20 acres at nearby Winthorpe; in 1862 he bought from Lord John Manners for &pound;85,000 the 1600 acre Fornham Park estate near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. The following year he added the nearby Herringswell estate&#151;2400 acres of light land, which he developed as a fine shoot&#151;and in 1868 acquired a further 600 acres at Fornham All Saints. Gilstrap threw himself wholeheartedly into Suffolk life; he was appointed a JP, deputy lieutenant, and, in 1867, high sheriff of the county. That same year, Fornham was the venue for the Royal Agricultural Society's annual show. He was a genial host, and his wife, Elizabeth, was renowned for her charm and wit. The estate became famous for its shooting parties, and a favourite with the prince of Wales and his brothers, who for many years were regular visitors.<br>
<br>Although never deeply involved in politics, Gilstrap broke with family tradition and became a lifelong supporter of the Liberal cause. He was a generous benefactor, supporting many charities and institutions, including the Newark and Bury hospitals, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), the Imperial Institute, and Bury Athenaeum Council. On its formation in 1882 he gave &pound;3500 to the Royal School of Music to found the Suffolk scholarship, and in same year donated &pound;16,000 to build and endow the Newark Free Library and create the Castle Gardens.<br>
<br>William and Elizabeth Gilstrap were childless. When in 1889 his niece Isabella (1861&#150;1949), second daughter of his deceased brother George, married John, second son of Duncan MacRae of Karnes Castle, Bute, MacRae became a partner in Gilstrap, Earp &amp; Co. Under the terms of Gilstrap's will, MacRae assumed the additional name of Gilstrap and inherited his business interests. The Fornham estate eventually passed to Isabella's sister, Anna, and her husband, George Espee Manners, nephew of the duke of Rutland. Gilstrap died at his home, Fornham Park, on 15 February 1896, and was buried at Fornham St Martin church on 20 February.<br>
