<span class="headword">Wainwright family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1750&#150;1825), <span class="occ">musicians</span>, were active in north-west England in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. It is difficult to identify individuals precisely as biographical evidence is often anecdotal, and contemporary accounts may only refer to &#145;Mr&#146; or &#145;Miss&#146; Wainwright.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_51254"></a><span class="headword">John Wainwright</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1723, <em>d.</em> 1767/8)<span class="occ"></span> was baptized at St Mary the Virgin, Stockport, Cheshire, on 14 April 1723, the son of John Wainwright (<i>d</i>. 1766), and his wife, Mary Heginbothom (<i>d</i>. 1767). The family probably lived at 58 Churchgate, Stockport, and John senior, a joiner, was occasionally employed at St Mary's. The younger John's education is unrecorded. He is described as organist of St Mary's on a memorial plaque erected in 1903 but no evidence of this appointment exists. On 30 December 1746 he married Anne Clarkson (<i>bap</i>. 1725, <i>d</i>. in or after 1781) at St Peter's, Blackley, north of Manchester, although she too came from Stockport. They had moved to Pool Court, Manchester, by 1748, when their first child, Robert, was baptized at Manchester collegiate church, now the cathedral. John Wainwright's occupation is given as &#145;Musick Master&#146; in the church register. On 19 October 1749, according to the records of the court leet, a John Wainwright (there may have been another in Manchester at this time) was appointed scavenger for &#145;St Anns Square and the Streets Adjacent&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Court Leet Records of Manchester</span>, 7, 1888, 180). Newspaper references to &#145;Mr Wainwright&#146; suggest that he also performed locally as an organist, conductor, and perhaps violinist. John Wainwright is famous as the composer of the Christmas hymn &#145;Christians awake&#146;, to words by John Byrom. Apparently on Christmas eve 1750, Byrom recorded in shorthand in his pocket book, &#145;The singing boys with Mr Wainwright came here and sang &#147;Christians Awake&#148;&#146;  (W. Shaw, 186). The tune was published by Caleb Ashworth (1761) as &#145;Mortram, old 50th Psalm Tune&#146; and by Wainwright in <span class="italic">A Collection of Psalm Tunes, Anthems, Hymns and Chants</span> (1766) under the title &#145;A Hymn for Christmas Day&#146;: today it is usually called &#145;Yorkshire&#146; or &#145;Stockport&#146;. Although Wainwright is described as organist of the collegiate church at Manchester on the title-page of his <span class="italic">Collection</span>, he was not officially appointed organist and instructor of the choristers until 12 May 1767. He died in Manchester and was buried at St Mary the Virgin, Stockport, on 28 January 1768. In 1908 part of his gravestone was discovered supporting a greenhouse in a local garden: it seems that it was destroyed when the church steeple was blown up with gunpowder in 1810.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_69658"></a><span class="headword">Robert Wainwright</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1748, <em>d.</em> 1782)<span class="occ"></span> was baptized at Manchester collegiate church on 17 September 1748, the first child of John Wainwright (<i>d</i>. 1767/1768). He was elected chorister at Manchester collegiate church on 25 June 1759. After his father's death he was appointed organist, instructor of the choristers, and &#145;singing man&#146; at Manchester collegiate church on 18 February 1768. He matriculated from Magdalen College, Oxford, on 18 April 1774, and received the degrees of BMus and DMus from the university on 29 April 1774. He married Mary Woodworth (<i>bap</i>. 1754, <i>d</i>. 1778) at Manchester collegiate church on 12 January 1775, and on 1 March of the same year he was elected organist at St Peter's, Liverpool. According to Edward Miller, he applied for the post of organist at Halifax parish church in 1776, but the builder of the new organ, John Snetzler, thought he played too fast: &#145;Te tevil, te tevil, he run over te keys like von cat; he vill not give my piphes room to shpeak&#146;  (W. Shaw, 187). William Herschel, later the well-known astronomer, was appointed instead. Like his father, John, Robert Wainwright conducted performances of Handel's oratorios throughout north-west England. He is said to have sold the copyright of his own oratorio <span class="italic">The Fall of Egypt</span> (now lost) for &pound;1000, and his setting of Dryden's <span class="italic">Ode on St Cecilia's Day</span> was performed at a Liverpool music festival. Some collections of his chamber music are still extant, but they are rarely performed today. He died in Liverpool on 15 July 1782.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_69660"></a><span class="headword">Richard Wainwright</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1757, <em>d.</em> 1825)<span class="occ"></span> was baptized at St Ann's, Manchester, on 8 July 1757, the third son of John Wainwright (<i>d</i>. 1767/1768). He became a chorister at Manchester collegiate church on 6 January 1768, and probably became organist and instructor of the choristers at some time after 1775 when his brother Robert moved to Liverpool. There is no specific record of his appointment, and the collegiate records state that &#145;Dr Wainwright&#146; was organist in the annual audit of 23 December 1776, but this is perhaps an error; Richard Wainwright was listed in the 1777 audit. In 1780 he composed music for a grand Christmas pantomime, <span class="italic">The Lancashire Witches, or, Harlequin Everywhere</span>, performed at the Theatre Royal, Manchester, and he later wrote a celebrated glee, &#145;Life's a Bumper&#146;, and <span class="italic">A Collection of Hymns &hellip; for the Children of the Liverpool Blue Coat Hospital</span> (1812). He was also apparently a cellist at the Manchester Gentlemen's Concerts, and may have been both the Mr Wainwright who led many local performances of Handel's oratorios as first violinist, and the one who at the Liverpool and Manchester music festivals between 1784 and 1789 variously played in the orchestra, played the organ, and conducted. He reputedly eloped with Jane Marriott (<i>bap</i>. 1765, <i>d</i>. 1794), a young lady from a boarding-school in Prestwich. They subsequently married at Manchester collegiate church on 5 November 1781, and their first child, John, was baptized on 25 March 1782 at St Peter's, Liverpool, where, on 4 September 1782, Richard again succeeded his brother Robert as organist. He resigned this post in October 1804, and moved to Preston where he became organist of the parish church, probably until 1810. He was never organist of St James's, Toxteth Park, Liverpool, contrary to some accounts. He was reinstated at St Peter's in 1812 and died at St Anne Street, Liverpool, on 20 August 1825.<br>
<br>Other musical members of the family include <a name="cosubject_69659"></a><span class="headword">William Wainwright</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1736?, <em>d.</em> 1797)<span class="occ"></span>, who is supposed to have been a son of John (<i>d</i>. 1767/1768), although no baptismal record exists, and he could equally have been his brother, as a William, son of John and Mary Wainwright, was baptized at St Mary the Virgin, Stockport, on 9 May 1736. William Wainwright was an excellent double bass player, sang at Manchester collegiate church, and ran a music shop with William Sudlow at the sign of the Violin and Flutes in Hanging Ditch, Manchester, between about 1780 and 1795. He was buried at St Mary the Virgin, Stockport, on 5 July 1797, and the church records describe him as an organist. Richard Wainwright, baptized at St Mary's, Stockport, on 19 January 1729, was certainly a brother of John Wainwright. He was elected a singing man at Manchester collegiate church on 27 December 1753, and remained there until his death. He was buried at St Mary's, Stockport, on 2 January 1759. Some sources also mention a Samuel Wainwright, who may have been the S. Wainwright for whom a benefit concert was held at Stockport in 1757. Another benefit concert, for &#145;Miss Wainwright, Organist&#146;, was held in 1765  (G. Shaw, 142). She may have been the organist at St Mary's, Stockport, who according to the parish accounts of 1781 received &#145;her salary&#146; of 10 guineas  (churchwarden's accounts, St Mary's, Stockport, Ches. &amp; Chester ALSS, 3435/8/4, vol. 2, p. 4).<br>
