<span class="headword">Hope,  George</span>  (1811&#150;1876), <span class="occ">agriculturist</span>, was born on 2 January 1811 at West Fenton, East Lothian, the second of the seven sons and a daughter of Robert Hope (<i>d</i>. 1852), tenant farmer, and his second wife, Christian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bogue, daughter of a farmer of Stevenson Mains. The Hopes were descended from a Dutch officer who had come over with William of Orange and afterwards settled near Edinburgh. Robert Hope was a great reader and his children had access to more books, newspapers, and periodicals than was normally the case in a household impoverished by the low prices resulting from poor weather and the corn laws. From his earliest days George found himself opposed to the shorter catechism, which he failed to master at Dirleton and Haddington schools, preferring mathematics, and toryism, whose sentiments he encountered in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>Hope left school at fourteen to work for Alexander Donaldson, a lawyer, and attended classes in the evenings. After four years he was obliged to take over Fenton Barns (near Gullane, East Lothian), 653 acres previously farmed by his late half-brother, but he always considered his time with Donaldson to have been of great value. After two or three years he had the offer of a good situation in Australia, but he declined this as his mother was unwell and did not want him to leave the district. Fenton Barns was on heavy clay soil, which yielded a poor crop in good years and nothing worth harvesting in wet years. The remedy lay in under-drainage, but so costly a cure had to wait until money was available; meanwhile George Hope set about improving his land by means of crop rotation, assisted by generous applications of the new manure, Peruvian guano. Soon his yields increased and his livestock flourished.<br>
<br>Hope found many influential men in Scotland and England who shared his strong unitarian and political opinions, and he counted Richard Cobden and John Bright among his friends. He supplemented his income by reviewing for <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, and his prize-winning essay opposing the corn laws was published in 1842; this brought him &pound;30, and was inserted in whole or in part in many other newspapers. On 8 July 1844 Hope married Isabella Peterkin, daughter of an Edinburgh solicitor; they had several children, some of whom died in childhood from diphtheria and scarlet fever.<br>
<br>Continuous manuring, the installation of land drains, and careful husbandry eventually brought Fenton Barns to prosperity and Hope even leased additional nearby land to cultivate. His fame spread, bringing visitors from the United States of America, Sweden, Denmark, and Russia. In 1870 he received a diploma constituting him a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture. He was one of the deputies of the Highland Society, taking livestock to the International Show in Paris, in June 1856. At home Hope opposed the game laws, which denied tenants the right to take game on their land. He was also against the Scottish law of hypothec, which allowed a landlord to distrain the produce of any tenant who failed to pay his rent, even when that produce had passed into other hands.<br>
<br>Hope stood twice for parliament. In 1865 he contested East Lothian, where he lost to Lord Elcho, a candidate with local influence; in 1875 he contested East Aberdeenshire, where he was not well known, and where his outspoken and unorthodox religious opinions, along with his support for disestablishment, roused the clergy to a furious canvass against him. The seat was easily won by Sir Alexander Gordon, second son of the fourth earl of Aberdeen. Hope's stand for parliament cost him dear. Like all tenant farmers, he lacked security of tenure: in 1875 his lease at Fenton Barns was due to expire and his application to renew was refused. The news of the treatment meted out after the Hope family had transformed the sour land of Fenton Barns into one of Britain's model farms, admired across northern Europe, caused a sensation throughout the land, reaching even to the houses of parliament. George Hope took a new farm at Bordlands, near Noblehouse, Peeblesshire, and ran an outlying sheep farm at Glencotho, Lanarkshire. But although in the last summer of his life he managed to visit both Glencotho and his son's border farms, he grew weaker; and by the autumn he had lost all interest in his former concerns. He died at Bordlands on 1 December 1876 and was buried at Dirleton, East Lothian. His wife survived him.<br>
