<span class="headword">Harford,  James</span>  (1734&#150;1817), <span class="occ">iron and tin plate manufacturer and merchant</span>, was the son of Truman Harford (1704&#150;1750), merchant and manufacturer, and Mary Taylor of Baldock, Hertfordshire, and grandson of Charles Harford (1662&#150;1725), a merchant, of Bristol [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47495/', "Harford family")</script>]. He developed a powerful network of tin plate- and iron-making interests and was the foremost among many Bristol merchants who became industrial entrepreneurs in south Wales. He lived at Felindre, Melingriffith, near Cardiff, and at his estate at Chew Magna in Somerset. In 1756 he married Anne Summers, daughter of his business partner, Richard Summers; they had six sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Harford developed industrial interests while maintaining his connections in Bristol, where he was a member of the Society of Merchant Venturers and part of an extensive Quaker merchant family. He succeeded by linking and developing existing enterprises rather than establishing new ventures, and was one of the few ironmasters to prosper in the eras of both charcoal and coke fuel. His numerous interests included the Pen-tyrch, Ebbw Vale, Nant-y-glo, Sirhowy, and Caerphilly smelting works in south-east Wales; Redbrook furnace, Monmouth forge, Newent forge, and New Weir forge in the Wye valley; and the Machen and Basaleg forges near Newport, Monmouthshire.<br>
<br>Harford's central industrial concern was the Melingriffith forge and tin plate works near Cardiff, which was established by Bristol merchants about 1750. He became a partner about 1768, along with the noted ironmaster Richard Reynolds, Richard Summers, and a number of others. By the 1770s he was in partnership with John Partridge sen. (<i>fl</i>. 1730s&#150;1770s) and John Partridge jun. (<i>c</i>.1736&#150;1816), Quaker ironmasters of Ross, Herefordshire, and Monmouth. In 1795 Harford and his younger brother John Harford (1736&#150;<i>c</i>.1816), with James's sons <a href="#cosubject_49075">Richard Summers Harford [<i>see below</i>]</a> and Samuel Harford (1766&#150;1838), were major figures in the enterprise. At this time Melingriffith was the largest tin plate works in the world. The main products were tin plate, and wrought-iron bars, sheets, rods, and hoops, but the company also dealt in cast-iron pots, frying pans, anvils, hammers, and spades, some purchased from other manufacturers. Goods were exported under the auspices of James Harford &amp; Co., merchants, of Bristol. In 1805 the nearby Pen-tyrch furnace was bought, and both enterprises were enlarged. However, in 1808 the partnership was dissolved, as the Harfords concentrated on more recently acquired, larger ironworks. They left Felindre, their local residence, in 1810 and Melingriffith and Pen-tyrch were transferred in 1812 to a group led by Richard Blakemore (<i>b</i>. 1775), the grandson of John Partridge sen.<br>
<br>Of the other ironworks interests, most were intended initially to complement the existing business, such as Redbrook furnace and Lydbrook forge, brought into the group through partnership with the Partridges. Caerphilly furnace was acquired in 1781 with a rolling and slitting mill. Although a blowing engine was installed in 1793, the furnace remained charcoal-fuelled and output in 1796 was only 600 tons. It was out of blast by 1805, made obsolete by the larger coke-fuelled works the Harfords had acquired.<br>
<br>The acquisitions which carried the Harfords into the production of bulk iron began in the 1790s. The only new venture was the ironworks at Nant-y-glo, promoted in 1792 with Thomas Hill, already a successful ironmaster at Blaenafon. Unfortunately, Hill complained that &pound;485 was spent above his &pound;10,000 capital and refused to let production start, even though Harford, Partridge &amp; Co. had spent &pound;16,381. The company was obliged simply to smelt material in stock, and the works lay idle from 1796 until 1802, when Hill returned with different partners.<br>
<br>Immediately before this d&eacute;b&acirc;cle, however, Harford, Partridge &amp; Co. had become partners of Jeremiah Homfray at Ebbw Vale ironworks, introducing capital for expansion. It became the sole owner in 1796. This was the first element in what was to become one of the most powerful ironworks enterprises in south Wales. James Harford as senior partner and his brother John as managing partner expanded Ebbw Vale from one blast furnace to four. Then, around the time of James's death in 1817, the company acquired the adjacent Sirhowy works (much to the anger of another ironmaster, Richard Fothergill, who had confided his own plans to renew the lease). This site too was expanded, from two furnaces to five. The period of greatest growth in the Harford iron fortunes ensued, under the management of Richard Summers Harford. Output at Ebbw Vale in 1805 had been 3664 tons; but from the two combined works it was 10,425 tons in 1823 and 26,020 in 1830. The capital value in 1820&#150;21 was over &pound;62,000 and rising rapidly.<br>
<br>As the possessor of an extensive industrial empire, James Harford was an enthusiastic promoter of improvements to transport. In 1785 he became a trustee of the turnpike from Merthyr Tudful to Tongwynlais, which brought iron to Melingriffith. When the Glamorganshire Canal Company was established in 1790, he was its first honorary treasurer and he and his sons were among the largest shareholders. Richard Crawshay, the Merthyr ironmaster, was constantly at loggerheads on the canal committee with Harford, whom he described as &#145;a rude, selfish Jew Quaker&#146;, insolent, and &#145;a mercenary fellow who must be treated as Circumstances require&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letterbook</span>, xx, 92). Harford, Partridge &amp; Co. and James Harford were also leading shareholders in the Monmouthshire Canal Company.<br>
<br>Harford's interests in education and workers' welfare were demonstrated at Melingriffith. From about 1775 the works had a scheme for medical attendance, as well as a reading-room. In 1786 a friendly society, the Melingriffith Benefit Club, was established, one of the earliest in south Wales. In 1798 there were sixty-three members, including John Harford, the employees at Melingriffith, and other local people. The club provided social activities, benefits, and pensions, and similar ones were started at Caerphilly in 1787 and at Ebbw Vale. A school for workers and their children existed at Melingriffith before 1786, and in 1807 James Harford invited Joseph Lancaster to address a meeting which resulted in the establishment there by subscription of a Lancastrian school for boys and girls.<br>
<br>James Harford's sons and grandsons continued in the iron industry. His eldest son, Truman Harford (1758&#150;1803), took the lease of Caerphilly furnace with his father and Philip Crocker in 1789 and dealt with iron orders at Melingriffith in the 1790s, but he established himself also as a brewer in Limehouse, London. Samuel, his fourth son, participated at Melingriffith. John Harford (1768&#150;1851), his fifth son, and his daughters Elizabeth Harford (<i>d</i>. 1836) and Sophia Harford (<i>b</i>. 1779) lived at Gelliwastad, Machen, about 1816 and may have overseen Caerphilly furnace and Machen forge.<br>
<br>However, it was James's second son, <a name="cosubject_49075"></a><span class="headword">Richard Summers Harford</span>  (1763&#150;1837), <span class="occ">iron manufacturer</span>, who became his effective heir. Richard established Nant-y-glo ironworks and lived nearby at Trosnant until 1799, and continued to operate associated collieries until 1801. He was increasingly involved at Ebbw Vale, which became the focus of the Harford interests, and he built a three-storey mansion, Ebbw Vale House, in 1817. He led the company from the time of his father's death in 1817 until his own in 1837. He followed his father into the Society of Merchant Venturers in 1825 and inherited the Chew Magna estate. In 1792 he married Jane Lloyd Perkins; their sons, Summers Harford and Charles Lloyd Harford, appear subsequently to have taken responsibility for the works. Their iron business was severely damaged by defaults on credits in Maryland, USA, which led to the bankruptcy of Harford, Davies &amp; Co. of Ebbw Vale in 1842. Significantly, the meeting of creditors was held in Bristol. Although Ebbw Vale continued to expand under new owners, this ended almost a century of the Harfords' leadership in the iron trade of south Wales.<br>
