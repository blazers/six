<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hamilton <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Douglas]</span>,  William</span>, third duke of Hamilton  (1634&#150;1694), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was born on 24 December 1634, probably at Douglas Castle, Lanarkshire, the principal residence of his father. He was the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7934/', "William Douglas, first marquess of Douglas (1589&#150;1660)")</script>, and the first by his second marriage, to Lady Mary (<i>d</i>. 1674), daughter of George Gordon, first marquess of Huntly.<h2>
<a name="Childhoodandmarriage"></a>Childhood and marriage</h2>Douglas's parents, both Roman Catholics, were in constant trouble with the Church of Scotland, not only for their non-attendance at services but also because they made no attempt to give young William and his two younger brothers a protestant education. The local presbytery investigated and, after questioning the family chaplain, wanted to take the children away from their parents, but the marquess refused to give them up. For a short time he sent them to Glasgow grammar school, and in 1644 he offered to send them to board with the minister of Douglas. Perhaps as a reward for this apparent compliance, on 4 August 1646, aged eleven, William was created earl of Selkirk, Lord Daer, and Lord Shortcleuch. Not long afterwards, however, his father sent him to Paris so that he could be brought up as a Catholic.<br>
<br>When the presbytery found out the marquess was charged with keeping his son in France and failing to provide a tutor for him. This was certainly true, for Selkirk had been sent abroad without any companion, either governor or servant. However, his grandfather had lived in exile in the French capital and his father had spent some time there, so presumably he was not entirely without friends. Douglas told the presbytery that it was impossible for him to recall the boy to Scotland and it is not known when exactly Selkirk returned. He was definitely back by 1655, when negotiations were in hand for him to marry Scotland's greatest heiress. The Douglas lands in Lanarkshire lay both to the north and to the south of the Hamilton estates, at that time the property of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12046/', "Anne Hamilton (1632&#150;1716), third duchess of Hamilton")</script> in her own right. At twenty-three, she was just two years older than Selkirk, and in many ways it was a most appropriate match. There was, however, one great difficulty in the way, and that was the earl's Catholicism, no mere matter of form. Twenty years later his brother Lord James Douglas was to tell him, &#145;I pray God that he [their brother George] and you and all our family were good Catholics as our ancestors have been&#146;  (NA Scot., GD406/C1/11743).<br>
<br>For her part, not only had Duchess Anne been brought up by her covenanting grandmother to hold strictly presbyterian views, but also the entail made by her uncle, William, second duke of Hamilton, had stipulated that if she did not marry a nobleman of the name of Hamilton, then her husband must be &#145;a nobleman of any other name, of the reformed Protestant religion and of untainted loyalty and fidelity to the king&#146;. Moreover, if the chosen husband began to fall away from his support of either church or king, he would lose all his rights over the estates. According to a note in the 1857 edition of Burnet's <span class="italic">History</span>, Selkirk &#145;was a very handsome man and, having gained the affections of the youthful duchess, to obtain her wide domains he consented to embrace the Protestant religion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 1.71n.).<br>
<br>Whatever his motives, Selkirk was undoubtedly determined to marry Anne and he persevered with the negotiations for three years. Just when everything seemed to have been agreed, his father changed his mind about the lands to be settled on the duchess by way of jointure. Deploring the delay, the earl took the initiative and had his own lawyers draw up a document settling the previously promised annuity on her. He then sent her the deed with a little note, declaring that &#145;if it wer more, I wold thinke it all to little for Your Grace, for I confess I can not expres the sence and hie estime I have of your Grace's deservings&#146;  (NA Scot., GD406/10749). Finally everything was in order and on 28 April 1656 the earl wrote on a small piece of paper, &#145;I do hereby declaire in the presence of God and as I shall answer at the great day of judgment, that I am not a papist nor does never resolve to be one&#146;  (NA Scot., GD406/C1/10750). The following day he and the duchess were married in Corstorphine church, just outside Edinburgh, and it was presumably then that Selkirk changed his name to Hamilton, in accordance with yet another condition of Duke William's entail. The first of his and Duchess Anne's thirteen children, a daughter, Mary, was born a year and a day later. Among the other children was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12069/', "George Hamilton, first earl of Orkney")</script>.<br>
<br>At least there were no complications with the other condition in the second duke's entail, for Selkirk was an active royalist. After William, ninth earl of Glencairn, obtained a commission from Charles II in 1653 as commander-in-chief in Scotland, landed in the highlands, and raised a force of some 5000 men, Selkirk was one of those who joined him. The First Anglo-Dutch War ended in April 1654, any possibility of continental help evaporated, and on 3 May General Monck issued a pass for Selkirk, his servants, horses, and arms to go to Dalkeith &#145;to treat for his lordship's coming in&#146;  (NA Scot., GD406/C1/2591). Selkirk duly capitulated.<h2>
<a name="Publiccareer"></a>Public career</h2>According to Gilbert Burnet, when the duke first married &#145;he then pass'd for a soft man, who minded nothing but the recovery of that family from the great debts under which it was sinking, till it was raised up again by his great management&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 1.71), and he took little part in public life during his first few years as Duchess Anne's husband. Although in theory Anne's inheritance was a very rich one, the reality was rather different. All her estates had been sequestrated by the Cromwellian government because of her family's support of Charles I, heavy fines had to be paid before any of her properties could be reclaimed, her father had lent large sums of money to the king, and she was virtually penniless. Fortunately, Hamilton possessed considerable business acumen and the family archives dating from that period bear evidence of his meticulous attention to detail in the form of the many annotations in his handwriting. He had little time for anything else, although there was one alarming incident in September 1659 when he refused to sign &#145;the Engagement&#146;  (NA Scot., Ailsa Muniments, GD25/9/30), tendered by General Monck to those who had earlier given bonds for their peaceable living, pledging them not to act for the exiled Charles II. As a result he was imprisoned in Douglas Castle, now in the hands of the Cromwellians. The duchess hastily enlisted the support of her powerful friends, however, and by the beginning of November William was home again.<br>
<br>With the Restoration of 1660, the Hamilton family fortunes were dramatically improved and at the duchess's special request Charles II on 20 September 1660 created her husband duke of Hamilton, marquess of Clydesdale, earl of Arran, Lanark, and Selkirk, and Lord Aven, Machanshire, Polmont, and Daer for life. The third duke of Hamilton sat in parliament for the first time in 1661 and was made a member of the Scottish privy council, but even so he was still spending most of the time working hard with the duchess to put their finances on a sound footing. From 1661 to 1669 he attended only 149 of a possible 330 meetings of the council. It was not until the 1670s that he began to play a really prominent part in public affairs. Charles II was governing Scotland through his secretary of state John Maitland, first duke of Lauderdale, an old friend of both the first and second dukes of Hamilton. Lauderdale's rule was, however, becoming ever more unpopular, in part because of corruption, in part because of his repressive measures against the covenanters. Guided by Duchess Anne, Hamilton took a strongly presbyterian line and his relationship with Lauderdale deteriorated sharply. In 1672 several members of the Scottish nobility, including William Douglas, third earl of Queensberry, and John Leslie, seventh earl of Rothes, urged him to take on the role of leader of the opposition to the government.<br>
<br>When parliament opened that year, Hamilton opposed the granting of supplies for the latest Anglo-Dutch war, moving that the state of the nation be considered first and grievances redressed. Lauderdale responded by adjourning parliament, and so the opposition politicians dispatched Hamilton and William Crichton, earl of Dumfries, to court to complain that Lauderdale and his brother Charles Maitland of Hatton, the lord treasurer, had accumulated all the profitable public offices for themselves and their friends. Because Hamilton refused to set down their grievances on paper, for fear of being accused of treason, the king sent the group away, removed all of them except Hamilton from the privy council, and dissolved parliament. The duke lost his place on the council in 1676 as a result of a further disagreement.<br>
<br>By now the government's ecclesiastical policies were reaching a new crisis, and in July 1678 a convention of estates voted the sum of &pound;1.8 million Scots, mainly to suppress the growing number of conventicles. Because of the difficulties of raising the sum and fears that local militia would refuse to act against the conventiclers, Lauderdale quartered a force known as &#145;the highland host&#146; on the western shires, arousing great opposition. After the defeat of the covenanters by the duke of Monmouth at the battle of Bothwell Bridge on 22 June 1679, Duchess Anne allowed the fleeing rebels to shelter on her estates while the duke, who had learned that writs of law burrows were to be issued against him, had already hurried to court with fourteen other noblemen and fifty country gentlemen to complain again about Lauderdale's rule. The king declined to receive them, and because they once more refused to put their grievances in writing, they were sent away.<br>
<br>Lauderdale finally fell from power two years later and after that policy in Scotland was directed at ensuring that the Roman Catholic James, duke of York, would be accepted as king on the death of Charles II. When James was made commissioner to the Scottish parliament in 1681, presbyterian statesmen looked to Hamilton to oppose the appointment on the grounds that it was illegal but, always conscious of the second duke's requirement that Duchess Anne's husband support the monarchy, he refused and voted for the act settling the succession. As a result, he was rewarded with the Order of the Garter, filling the vacancy left by Lauderdale.<br>
<br>When James VII and II succeeded in 1685, Hamilton was restored to his place on the Scottish privy council and made commissioner to the Treasury. In March 1686 he became an extraordinary lord of session and in October 1687 was given a place on the English privy council. He was in London when news came that William of Orange had landed, and those other Scottish privy councillors then at court sought his advice as to what should be done. The duke urged them to remain loyal to James, but as early as 1674 he had been suspected of corresponding with the prince of Orange, and his presbyterian stance meant that he privately viewed William's arrival with relief. As soon as Hamilton heard that James had fled for France he went to Sion House, where William was staying, and received a warm welcome. The new king and queen looked to Hamilton to settle affairs in Scotland and he was made president of the convention of estates which met in Edinburgh on 14 March 1689 to declare the throne vacant and proclaim William and Mary. He became commissioner when the convention was transformed into a parliament, and served in that capacity again in April 1693, living in almost viceregal state in his Holyroodhouse apartments for the duration of the parliament.<h2>
<a name="Estateimprovement"></a>Estate improvement</h2>The duke and duchess had by this time embarked on an ambitious programme of expansion. They began by adding an elegant, five-storey wing to Kinneil, their tower house above the River Forth near Bo'ness in Linlithgowshire, and then turned their attention to Hamilton Palace. This was a great period of building and improvement, and they were determined not to be left behind. The palace was a late sixteenth-century structure, with four ranges surrounding a quadrangle, and a clutter of office houses at the back. The duke had seen the fine palaces of France during his boyhood, he made a point of visiting English country houses on his way to and from court, and he purchased books on architecture. As early as 1678 he had plans for a new palace drawn up in London, telling his wife: &#145;I shall make you a fine house in paper which will be some charges, yet I thinke well bestowed, to have such a thing by us againest wee be able to build itt&#146;  (NA Scot., GD406/C1/8147). In the end, however, he selected the Scottish architect James Smith to undertake the work, paying him &pound;14 on 30 March 1682 for drawing drafts.<br>
<br>These were not the final plans for the new palace, for its design evolved as the work progressed. In essence, the scheme was to demolish three ranges, leaving only the north front standing, for it contained all the principal rooms. Two entirely new wings would then be built on the site of the former east and west ranges, the new main entrance would be from the courtyard sheltered by the two new wings, and the entire building would now face south instead of north. It was not, of course, possible to demolish everything at once, because the household of more than 200 people had to go on living in the palace, and in any case it would have been far too expensive to do it all at the same time. Work began in 1684 and was not in fact completed for almost twenty years, but in the meantime the duke took the opportunity of buying expensive new furniture and furnishings every time he went to London on business, shipping them home by way of Leith.<br>
<br>Like many of his contemporaries, Hamilton was also an enthusiastic planter and a keen gardener. He planted elders, ash, alders, and avenues of limes in the parkland surrounding the palace and edged the gravel walks with thorns. Purchasing seeds in both Edinburgh and London, he gave particular attention to the huge kitchen garden where he grew everything from French cucumbers to Italian celery and Dutch parsnips. He had special hotbeds for asparagus as well as frames for bringing on melons, gourds, and tender herbs. Extending the brick walls, he grew peaches, apricots, and cherries against them, importing grafts from the Netherlands. He also laid out a new bowling green.<br>
<br>All this work came to an abrupt halt in the spring of 1694. Returning home from his annual winter stay at court, Hamilton suffered a stroke on the coach journey north and lost the use of his left leg. He insisted on continuing, and when his wife heard the news she set off in a coach to meet him, with several eminent doctors and the minister of Hamilton. They were reunited just north of the Scottish border, and managed to get as far as Edinburgh, but the duke was sinking rapidly and he died about half past five on the morning of 18 April in his apartments in the palace of Holyroodhouse. His body was embalmed a few hours later, and on 24 May, as the guns of Edinburgh Castle fired a salute, his funeral procession left for Hamilton. He was buried with suitable pomp in the parish church, five of his surviving six sons walking behind his coffin. James Smith designed a huge and impressive monument, and in December 1694 the duchess authorized the purchase of black and white marble from the Netherlands for it. Placed above the vault where the duke was buried, it remained there until Hamilton church was demolished, when it was removed to St Bride's Church, near Bothwell.<br>
<br>According to Gilbert Burnet, the third duke of Hamilton:<blockquote>wanted all sort of polishing. &hellip; His temper was boisterous, neither fit to submit nor to govern. He was mutinous when out of power and imperious in it. He wrote well but spoke ill; for his judgement when calm was better than his imagination &hellip; a narrow and selfish temper brought such an habitual meanness on him that he was not capable of designing or undertaking great things. (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 1.71)</blockquote>The fact that Burnet's patron in later years was none other than the duke of Lauderdale no doubt accounts for this somewhat jaundiced assessment. Irritable the duke might be, and heavy-handed in his dealings with others, particularly his own eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7898/', "James Hamilton, earl of Arran (1658&#150;1712)")</script>, but his transformation of the Hamilton estates was little short of remarkable. Whatever his reason for marrying Duchess Anne, and in spite of infidelity to her, which resulted in his having an illegitimate daughter, they were a devoted couple, brought all the closer by the &#145;turmoilings&#146; they had endured together. Amid her great grief for him, the duchess completed all her husband's unfinished improvements at Hamilton Palace. On 24 April 1696, referring to the second anniversary of his death, she told their daughter Katherine: &#145;That day &hellip; I shall not forget while I live, and now I am writing where he used to do it, and everything I see is marks of his industry. I fear his son will not leave such behind him&#146;  (Atholl MSS, Blair Castle, 29 I 8, 166).<br>
