<span class="headword">Emerson, Sir  William</span>  (1843&#150;1924), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 3 December 1843 at 28 Spital Square, Whitechapel, London, the son of William Emerson, silk manufacturer, and his wife, Jane Robinson. He was educated at King's College School in London and began his architectural training about 1861, with Habershon and Pite of Bloomsbury Square, before moving in 1865 to the practice of William Burges, the most scholarly and visionary of the Gothic revivalists. In his first year with Burges he assisted with the designs for a new school of art in Bombay, and in 1866 was dispatched to Bombay with the plans, but they were never realized, owing to a disagreement over fees. Emerson, who had family connections in India, stayed in Bombay, however. His first major commission there was the Crawford market (1865&#150;71), in which Burges's influence was strongly evident, both in its style and structure, and in the fantastical character of its decorative ironwork and fountain, sculpted by John Lockwood Kipling (1837&#150;1911), the father of Rudyard Kipling.<br>
<br>In 1869 Emerson returned to London and established offices in Westminster. For a few years he exhibited designs annually at the Royal Academy. He was married on 27 July 1872 to Jenny (<i>b</i>. 1852), daughter of the architect Coutts Stone and his wife, Mary, of Bayswater, and built a house for his family, Little Sutton, at Chiswick (1879). His relatively few buildings in England also included the church of St Mary and St James, Brighton (1877&#150;9), and the Clarence Wing of St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London (1896). Some of his best schemes were not built. His competition designs for the parliament in Berlin (1872) and the South Kensington Museum (1892) were not successful, and his entry in the limited competition for Liverpool Cathedral (1885), which was selected, was never started as the site and scheme were abandoned.<br>
<br>Emerson's Indian work continued to flourish, however. For churches&#151;Girgaum church, near Bombay (<i>c</i>.1870&#150;73), and All Saints' Cathedral, Allahabad (<i>c</i>.1869&#150;93)&#151;he preferred Gothic forms, but for secular buildings he championed the eclectic combination of neo-Gothic planning and construction with Eastern, so-called Indo-Saracenic, details. He did not believe that purely European buildings worked satisfactorily in the East. In the case of his Muir College, Allahabad (1872&#150;8), his most startling and thoroughly eclectic work, he drew on Egyptian, as well as Indian and European, models. Other works included a hospital (<i>c</i>.1879&#150;83) and huge new maharaja's palace (1894&#150;5) at Bhaunagar. His final and most prestigious Indian work was the Victoria Memorial, Calcutta (1903&#150;21), a museum of British rule in India commissioned by the viceroy, Lord Curzon, which dominates the centre of Calcutta.<br>
<br>Emerson was active on the council and committees of the Royal Institute of British Architects from 1885, and served as its honorary secretary (1893&#150;9) and president (1899&#150;1902). During his presidency he advised the government on the competition for improvements to Buckingham Palace and St James's Park. He was also president of the Royal Architectural Museum and oversaw its amalgamation with the Architectural Association in 1902. He was knighted that year. As well as achieving public eminence, the sociable Emerson also maintained a wide circle of friends in the profession. On his retirement, Emerson's son William Ernest continued his practice. Emerson died at his home, Eastcliffe, Shanklin, on the Isle of Wight on 26 December 1924, aged eighty-one.<br>
