<span class="headword">King,  William</span>  (1663&#150;1712), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in London, the son of Ezekias King (<i>b</i>. 1637, <i>d</i>. in or after 1672), gentleman. His forebears included merchants and a clergyman grandparent, Ezekias King, who turned presbyterian and was silenced in 1662. William King was a king's scholar at Westminster School, from 1678 to 1681, under Richard Busby's headmastership. He was admitted to Christ Church, Oxford, as a king's student in Michaelmas term 1681, matriculated on 16 December, and graduated BA on 8 December 1685, as a grand compounder&#151;this higher fee indicating an estate worth at least &pound;300 per annum. After proceeding MA (6 July 1688) he embarked on the study of civil law, becoming BCL and DCL (7 July 1692) and a member of Doctors' Commons (12 November)&#151;a more prestigious than lucrative branch of advocacy. At Oxford he read widely but, as Dr Johnson calculated, could hardly have dispatched in eight years the twenty-two thousand books and manuscripts alleged, from his <span class="italic">Adversaria</span>, by Joseph Browne (Johnson, <span class="italic">Poets</span>, 26; Browne, 16).<br>
<br>King had already embarked on a writer's life: <span class="italic">Reflections upon Mons Varillas's History of Heresy</span>, written with Edward Hannes (1688), defended Wycliffe; <span class="italic">An Answer to a Book</span> (1693) attacked William Sherlock, accused of tritheism; <span class="italic">Animadversions on a Pretended Account of Danmark</span> (1694) disputed Robert Molesworth's exposure of Danish absolutism, earning him Prince George of Denmark's gratitude and the post&#151;which seems not to have involved much&#151;of secretary to his wife, Princess Anne. King also wrote poetry in Dryden's <span class="italic">Examen poeticum</span> (1693) and translations for the bookseller Thomas Bennet. A letter from King recalling, from spring 1694, Richard Bentley's &#145;Pride and Insolence&#146; in a conversation, overheard by King, between Bentley and Bennet, was printed in the collaborative attack on Bentley by the so-called Christ Church wits  (C. Boyle, <span class="italic">Dr Bentley's Dissertations &hellip; Examin'd</span>, 1698, 8). King supposedly contributed their mock-proof that Bentley had not written his own dissertation; also a satirical index; if so, he wrote the <span class="italic">Examination</span>'s best parts. Bentley, in his revised <span class="italic">Dissertation</span>, poured scorn on King's letter, quoting Horace's &#145;<i>The filth and venom of</i> Rupilius King&#146;  (R. Bentley, <span class="italic">A Dissertation upon the Epistles of Phalaris</span>, 1699, xxix). King then ridiculed &#145;Bentivoglio&#146; in his anonymous <span class="italic">Dialogues of the Dead</span> (1699); he may also have written the appendix <span class="italic">A Short Account of Dr Bentley's Humanity</span> (1699).<br>
<br>King was making fun of other people too: <span class="italic">A Journey to London</span> (1698) parodied Martin Lister's recent <span class="italic">Journey to Paris</span>, with its triviality and muddle; <span class="italic">The Transactioneer</span> (1700), two dialogues reminiscent of Shadwell's <span class="italic">Virtuoso</span>, caricatured the Royal Society's secretary, Hans Sloane. Perhaps King was lazy and preferred being a litt&eacute;rateur to a lawyer  (Nichols, 1.xiv); but he looks conscientious enough in two business letters to under-secretary John Ellis  (Engel, 39&#150;40). His most famous case was lost: defending the earl of Anglesey in the House of Lords (February&#150;April 1701) against his wife's action for separation. Soon after that King gave up Doctors' Commons to become a judge of the Admiralty court in Dublin. His reasons are unclear, but the move must owe something to the earl of Rochester, who arrived in Ireland as lord lieutenant on 16 September 1701: King had some family connection with the Hydes and had been active in tory politics  (Engel, 36&#150;7). He arrived in Dublin before Rochester, only to find his patent delayed and the Admiralty court defunct. The city regarded King's appointment as an infringement of its rights: although he was appointed agent for prizes at Dublin on 29 August 1702, he was still waiting for his Admiralty court commission when he wrote to Ellis on 16 January 1703 and complained, <i>inter alia</i>, of the Irish people's being &#145;insolent, &amp; proud as they are poor&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 28890, fol. 17).<br>
<br>King found an English friend in Anthony Upton, judge of common pleas, who entertained him on his estate at Mountown outside Dublin. King's poem about the red cow &#145;Mully of Mountown&#146; was pirated, as was a parody of Orpheus and Eurydice, and attributed to &#145;the author of the Tale of a tub&#146;. King published authorized versions of both poems in <span class="italic">Some Remarks on the &#145;Tale of a Tub&#146;</span> (1704), where he denied writing <span class="italic">A Tale</span>. He was replaced as agent for prizes on 13 May 1706 but secured the vicar-generalship of Armagh. On 19 June 1707, helped perhaps by the new lord lieutenant, the earl of Pembroke, he was made keeper of the records in Dublin Castle. The post was poorly paid and required more of an antiquary than King was; he resigned on 28 November 1707 and returned to England.<br>
<br>King was now dependent on his income as a writer: Bernard Lintott paid him 30 guineas each for <span class="italic">The Art of Cookery, in Imitation of Horace's Art of Poetry</span> ([1708]) and <span class="italic">The Art of Love: in Imitation of Ovid De arte amandi</span> ([1708]). The poems' popularity prompted Lintott to print a two-volume collection of King's <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span> ([1708&#150;9]); also his <span class="italic">Historical Account of the Heathen Gods and Heroes</span>, much used in schools, for which he subsequently received &pound;50. King returned to his attack on Sloane with the mock-proceedings <span class="italic">Useful Transactions in Philosophy</span>, which ran for three issues (January&#150;September 1709). In May 1711 Gay noted its demise and added that the &#145;Author deserves a much better Fate, than to Languish out the small remainder of his Life in the <i>Fleet</i> Prison&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poetry and Prose</span>, 2.449). On 19 December 1711 Swift described King, whose Irish footman had just died, as &#145;a poor starving wit&#146;  (Swift, 2.442). But King commended himself to Swift as a high-church tory, publishing five pro-Sacheverell pamphlets (1710&#150;11) and early in 1712 satirizing Marlborough in <span class="italic">Rufinus, or, An Historical Essay</span>.<br>
<br>On 8 January 1712 Swift wrote to Archbishop King in Dublin, &#145;I have got poor Dr. <i>King</i> &hellip; to be Gazetteer, which will be worth 250 <i>l</i>. to him, if he be diligent and sober, for which I am engaged.&#146; In his reply the archbishop fears that &#145;poor Dr. King&#146; will &#145;forfeit your recognisance&#146;  (J. Swift, <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, vol. 1, ed. H. Williams, 1963, 286, 290). His apprehension was justified: on 1 July 1712 the <span class="italic">Gazette's</span> editorship was taken over by Charles Ford; according to Thomas Hearne, King &#145;did not hold it above two Months&#146; (Swift, 2.543; <span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 4.45).<br>
<br>Although King's health was now poor, he wrote <span class="italic">Useful Miscellanies</span> (1712), worked on translations, and celebrated Bolingbroke's return from France (August 1712) with a poem, <span class="italic">Britain's Palladium</span>. Living with a friend at Lambeth, he made another tory gesture: when Archbishop Tenison did not celebrate the surrender of Dunkirk, King &#145;invited the watermen and his poor neighbours &hellip; to partake of some barrels of ale&#146;  (Nichols, xxv). On 24 December 1712 Lord Clarendon learned that King was seriously ill and had him brought to a lodging in the Strand opposite Somerset House. That night he made his will  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/531), leaving everything to his sister Elizabeth, and about noon on Christmas day he died. He had never married. He was buried in the north cloister of Westminster Abbey on 27 December 1712. Hearne commented, &#145;he was so addicted to the Buffooning way, that he neglected his proper Business&#146;; Gay, however, had allowed King &#145;a World of Wit, yet as it lies in one particular way of Raillery, the Town soon grew weary of his Writings&#146; (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 4.45; <span class="italic">Poetry and Prose</span>, 2.449).<br>
