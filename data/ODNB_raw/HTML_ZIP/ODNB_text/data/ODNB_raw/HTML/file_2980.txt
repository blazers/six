<span class="headword">Boult,  Swinton</span>  (1808&#150;1876), <span class="occ">insurance company manager</span>, was born on 3 December 1808 in Liverpool, one of several children of Francis Boult, a Unitarian shipowner, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Swanwick. While his father was fairly prominent in Liverpool, and a founder of the town's American chamber of commerce in 1801, nothing is known of Boult's early years. In 1831, aged twenty-two, he began in insurance with the local agency of George Booth, who represented two London offices, Albion Life and Protector Fire. In 1833 he married Maria Ann Grundy, eldest child of the Revd John Grundy; they had three sons. In 1834 Boult became Liverpool agent for London Assurance. This was a difficult time for fire insurance agents in Liverpool as London offices sought to maintain high premium rates in the face of consistently poor results, especially on warehouse insurances. Boult believed he saw a market opening for a local office. In 1836 he came together with George Holt, banker, cotton broker, and fellow Unitarian, to found Liverpool Fire and Life Insurance Company, with a paid-up capital of &pound;66,000 and a board selected from local whig nonconformist merchants. Boult became company secretary, a title he held for the next thirty years.<br>
<br>Initially the company's existence remained precarious. Boult was attacked in the press for inviting subscriptions to an enterprise which looked likely to fail. Shareholders became unhappy about slow growth, and the larger London offices were eagerly seeking provincial insurers to swallow up. Sun Fire Office, which targeted Boult's company in 1838, reported that Boult was a &#145;very young man &hellip; [who] has no warm friend or advocate and is thought very inefficient for the situation and has no influence whatever&#146;  (J. Toplis to C. Ford, 16 Oct 1838, London, Guildhall Library, MS 15032/7). This opinion, however, soon proved baseless. Boult was determined that Liverpool Fire and Life should survive, and he fought off all attacks, even during the disastrous losses of 1842&#150;3. He launched himself into a campaign to improve Liverpool's water supply and firefighting facilities, and eventually succeeded in rallying the other fire offices to the cause. In 1845 the <span class="roman">Liverpool Fire Prevention Act</span> was passed, with its provisions based upon an inquiry carried out by Boult into the causes of local fires. In 1846 he organized the Liverpool Fire Salvage Association, which aimed to improve warehouse construction and fire prevention methods. During the 1840s he played a central role in negotiating tariff premium rate agreements among the major fire offices for warehouse and cotton mill risks in Liverpool and Manchester. He also devised a uniform policy form for the tariff offices, which had been another point of competition. His role was further recognized when he was elected chairman of the northern committee of the Fire Tariff Association in 1858, and ten years later he helped to found its successor, the national Fire Offices' Committee.<br>
<br>The early vulnerability of Liverpool Fire and Life was, in part, due to its concentration of risks. As a solution Boult began a series of take-overs which subsumed at least ten offices in Britain and abroad during his career. After the take-over of the London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Insurance Company in 1847, the company's name was changed by act of parliament to Liverpool and London. The culmination of this strategy came in 1864 when the company merged with Globe Insurance (established 1803), in one of the biggest corporate fusions Britain had seen. Boult, who negotiated the merger, was appointed managing director of the renamed Liverpool, London, and Globe (LL&amp;G). At the time some of his compeers thought him a little obsessed with amalgamations, but the strategy had its effect. By 1867 the office was the largest fire insurer in the world, with a premium income of &pound;837,000.<br>
<br>Boult also pursued expansion overseas, particularly following the lines of Liverpool's trading links. From 1848 the first agents were appointed in New York, Newfoundland, and Hamburg, and in 1851 a board of directors was established at New York for the United States. In 1853 Boult made a long journey to Australia, travelling across the USA via San Francisco, where, with a new agency, Liverpool and London opened the first European office on the Pacific coast. New boards were also established by Boult in Melbourne and Sydney. Total premiums more than quadrupled to &pound;222,000 between 1851 and 1856 as Liverpool and London extended its agencies across Europe, Latin America, Africa, India, and the Far East. Increasing use was made by the company of reinsurance, despite Boult's dislike of the business and his opinion that no office should underwrite any one risk or combination of risks, unless it meant to retain it (and had the resources to do so). In 1859 a director resigned in protest at the too rapid expansion, but an inquiry found that, over the long term, foreign underwriting had proved more profitable than home business.<br>
<br>By 1871 the United States generated &pound;423,000 out of a global premium income of &pound;931,000. That year, in which Boult was described by a writer as the &#145;very Napoleon of fire insurance&#146;  (Walford, 354), proved to be disastrous, with losses of over &pound;600,000 in the great Chicago fire, followed by &pound;280,000 paid out in the Boston fire of 1872. All claims were met, and in the long term the company's reputation in the USA was enhanced, but the immediate dividends suffered, and Boult was called to account. Early in 1873 LL&amp;G's board decided not to renew his appointment, ending his career after thirty-seven years. He lobbied the shareholders, but was unable to find a way back, and his attempt to establish a new insurance office failed.<br>
<br>Writing before Boult's departure from LL&amp;G, a journalist referred to &#145;the cheery voice, the frank manner, the dignified courtesy, the unfailing tact, the power of assimilation and clarification, which carried his board of directors with him&#146;  (Walford, 355). Boult was respected by the insurance community on both sides of the Atlantic, and the Americans viewed him as &#145;an open-hearted and courteous gentleman&#146;  (<span class="italic">New York Spectator</span>, 431), but it seems he was not particularly sociable. Despite his frequent agency tours, it is said he behaved more like a banker than a merchant, sitting in his office to receive callers. He published on a number of topics, including taxation, joint-stock companies, and political economy. He was a firm believer in <i>laissez-faire</i>, and criticized, as another example of excessive state interference, the act of 1870 which made the registration of life assurance companies compulsory. He was no orator. In 1867 he gave evidence to the select committee on fire protection, it is said, in &#145;a sledge-hammer style of delivery, occasionally toned down by a characteristic sarcasm&#146;  (Walford, 355).<br>
<br>Boult suffered from acute rheumatic gout, and on 8 July 1876, aged sixty-seven, he collapsed and died in Aigburth Road, Garston, near Liverpool, while hailing the Liverpool omnibus. The county coroner's verdict was death from natural causes. His wife survived him.<br>
