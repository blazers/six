<span class="headword">Vaughan,  Benjamin</span>  (1751&#150;1835), <span class="occ">diplomatist and political reformer</span>, was born on 19 April 1751 in Jamaica, the eldest of the eleven children of Samuel Vaughan (1720&#150;1802), a London merchant and West India planter of Welsh extraction, and Sarah (1727&#150;1809), daughter of Benjamin Hallowell, a Boston merchant and founder of Hallowell, Maine. Vaughan's father operated his prosperous business from premises at Dunster's Court, London, and met his wife through an unsuccessful business partnership with her father. Soon after marrying Benjamin's parents moved to Jamaica, but returned to London after his birth to reside at Wanstead. Vaughan was sent to Henry Newcome's school at Hackney and on 27 August 1765 he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn. The following year, along with his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28155/', "William Vaughan (1752&#150;1850)")</script>, he was sent to the Warrington Academy and resided with the eminent dissenter Joseph Priestley. After three years' study at Warrington, Vaughan went to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he was admitted on 8 August 1768. Despite the fact that Unitarians could not graduate, he remained there until 1771, when he apparently began once more to study law, in the Inner Temple. By 1779 Vaughan had determined to marry Sarah Manning (<i>d</i>. 1835), daughter of William Manning, a London merchant, but her father insisted that he acquire a profession to rely on if necessary, since both families' fortunes depended on West Indian trade. Thus, in 1780, Vaughan enrolled at the University of Edinburgh to study medicine, though he never practised the field, preferring instead to join Manning's business. He returned to London to marry Sarah on 30 June 1781 at the church of St Dunstan-in-the-East; the marriage produced three sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Through his father Vaughan was first introduced to politics. Samuel Vaughan was an active reformer as a member of the Society of the Supporters of the Bill of Rights in the 1760s and a friend of John Wilkes and John Horne Tooke. He was also a member of the Club of Honest Whigs, the meetings of which Benjamin sometimes attended, whereby he associated with the likes of Priestley, Richard Price, and James Burgh. In 1767 Vaughan also became acquainted with Benjamin Franklin, with whom he was to develop a close friendship and admiration, resulting in the publication of the comprehensive <span class="italic">Political, Miscellaneous and Philosophical Pieces &hellip; Written by Benjamin Franklin</span> (1780). At other times, Vaughan was variously occupied with his father's business, spending twelve months in the early 1770s managing a plantation in Jamaica and then directing the London company from 1775 to 1777. Around this time, probably through his association with Horne Tooke and as a frequenter of parliamentary debates, Vaughan became known to Lord Shelburne, by whom he was often employed as an adviser and private secretary, and as such was an active and important mediator in Paris during the Anglo-American peace negotiations of 1782&#150;3.<br>
<br>In 1783 Vaughan returned to London to restart work for Manning and lived with his family at Jefferies Square. Engaging himself in his hobbies of music and bird breeding, Vaughan also entertained on a regular basis reform-minded men like Price, Priestley, Thomas Paine, and Samuel Romilly. About 1783 he also thought of establishing a newspaper, and served on a six-man board advising the government on behalf of the Committee of West Indian Merchants and Planters. He was, in addition, a part of the Association for Promoting the Discovery of the Interior Parts of Africa, and wrote a long, unpublished manuscript entitled &#145;The political state of the Austrian Netherlands&#146;. For twelve months from January 1788 Vaughan's attention turned to editing his short-lived periodical, <span class="italic">The Repository</span>, and writing <span class="italic">New and Old Principles of Trade Compared</span> (1788).<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of revolution in France, Vaughan made a number of visits to Paris and was one of the privileged, though not impressed, few who sat near the royal box at the F&ecirc;te de la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration on 14 July 1790. That same year, writing as A Christian Politician, Vaughan composed <span class="italic">A Collection of Testimonies in Favour of Religious Liberty</span> (1790), which he followed, in the year between July 1792 and June 1793, with a series of letters criticizing William Pitt's government in the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, under the pseudonym A Calm Observer, and published collectively as <span class="italic">Letters on the Subject of the Concert of Princes and the Dismemberment of Poland and France</span> (1793) and <span class="italic">Two Papers by the Calm Observer</span> (1795). Vaughan also published his <span class="italic">Comments on the Proposed War with France</span> (1793), wrote an introduction to David Ramsay's <span class="italic">History of the American Revolution</span> (1793), and edited with Richard Price two volumes of <span class="italic">Works of the Late Doctor Franklin</span> (1793). His enthusiasm for writing in these years, however, was not matched by his somewhat reticent term of office following his election to parliament in February 1792 as a member for Calne. Despite the numerous opportunities to voice his opinions, Vaughan apparently spoke only once, in February 1794, on account of William Wilberforce's bills for the abolition of the slave trade.<br>
<br>In 1794, with the arrest of William Stone, brother of John Hurford Stone, an outspoken pro-French businessman living in Paris, the authorities found a letter from Vaughan, and he was subsequently summoned in May to appear before the privy council. Vaughan, however, fled to France without his family, taking refuge at Passy before being detained in a former Carmelite convent. By 27 June 1794 he had been released and travelled to Switzerland, where he spent time in Geneva, Bern, and Basel, and was befriended by the wealthy Fellensberg family and local liberals including Johann-Ludwig Iselin, J. L. Le Grand, and Fran&ccedil;ois Fesch. In 1795 he seemed determined to move to America, thus urging his wife and family to travel to Boston, where they arrived in September. Vaughan, however, stayed in Basel in the hope of promoting peace, and he made several trips to Paris on a false passport bearing the name John Martin and identifying him as an American citizen. In February and March 1796 he completed <span class="italic">De l'&eacute;tat politique et economic de la France sous sa Constitution de l'An III</span> (1796), which was published in Strasbourg, and for the next twelve months he lived outside Paris in the country house of Fulwar Skipwith, an American consul, and established a textile factory in partnership with the Stone brothers.<br>
<br>Eventually, in July 1797, Vaughan joined his family in America, where they settled on inherited lands at Hallowell. Here, he retired from active politics, although he maintained an active mind through his writing efforts, which included <span class="italic">Travels of a philosopher, or, Observations on the manners and arts of various nations in Africa and Asia</span> (1797), <span class="italic">An abridgement of the second edition of a work by Dr. Currie &hellip; on the use of water in diseases of the human frame</span> (1799), <span class="italic">The Rural Socrates</span> (1800), <span class="italic">Remarks on a Dangerous Mistake Made as to the Eastern Boundary of Louisiana</span> (1814), and frequent contributions to local agricultural and medical journals. He devoted much of his time at Hallowell to promoting scientific and literary societies and as such was one of the founders of the Maine Historical Society and the Maine Medical Society, and he often opened his large personal library for use by scholars. Largely on account of this kind of patronage, Vaughan was bestowed an honorary doctor of laws degree from Harvard in 1807 and Bowdoin in 1812. He also dedicated much of his time in the final years to maintaining his extensive investments and properties in Maine, which included a lumber company he owned with his brother Charles Vaughan (1759&#150;1839). Troubled by gout in his later years, Vaughan's duties became increasingly difficult, and he died on 7 December 1835.<br>
