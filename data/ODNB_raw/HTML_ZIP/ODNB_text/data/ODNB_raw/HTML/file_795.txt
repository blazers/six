<span class="headword">Ashworth,  Henry</span>  (1794&#150;1880), <span class="occ">cotton master</span>, was born on 4 September 1794 at Birtwistle, near Bolton, the eldest of the six sons and five daughters of John Ashworth, land agent and cotton spinner, and his wife, Isabel Thomasson. Educated locally and at Ackworth School in Yorkshire, a Quaker boarding-school, he entered his father's firm in 1808. Since his father's main interests lay in agriculture, he had by 1818 taken charge, to be joined in 1824 by his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42009/', "Edmund Ashworth")</script>. By 1834 the firm had grown dramatically in size (with two factories, over 77,000 spindles, and <i>c</i>.700 employees) and was in the forefront of technological change in this most advanced sector of the economy. Growth continued in the next twenty years, although Ashworth's wider interests increasingly diverted him from managerial concerns. Moreover, disputes with his brother, unresolved by Quaker arbitration, led in 1854 to the division of the firm, with Henry taking the New Eagley mill, with its 700 or so employees. The firm still remained prominent and lucrative to the partners, but now dropped from the front rank.<br>
<br>In the 1830s and 1840s the Ashworth enterprise had become an emblem of the new industrial order itself. Its rural location, as at the Gregs' Styal mills, had favoured an exercise in community-building driven by profit rather than philanthropy. Ashworth had built cottages, chapels, schools, a library, and a reading-room. In his activities Ashworth self-consciously epitomized the northern, nonconformist mill owner, seeking through industrial progress to liberate the middle classes from the shackles of aristocratic rule. His tireless and unashamedly entrepreneurial advocacy included strong support for Edwin Chadwick's implementation of the new poor law of 1834, including what became a notorious and ill-advised scheme to resettle rural labourers in the factory districts. Equally dogmatically, Ashworth opposed trade unions, and strikes, as harmful to workers, employers, and society: he published a severe attack on the Preston strikers in 1854. Above all, he was an outspoken opponent of factory legislation, both as an infraction of the worker's (and employer's) freedom of contract, and as an unjustified slur upon the industrial class. Through his evidence to parliamentary committees, letters to the press, and pamphleteering, Ashworth and his mills became a focal point for social observers, and for discussions of the &#145;condition of England&#146; question.<br>
<br>Ashworth's reputation as an <i>enrag&eacute;</i>, rebarbative employer was reinforced by the leading part he played in the campaign for the repeal of the corn laws. By the end of 1838 he acted with Cobden in the Manchester chamber of commerce, in moves preceding the formation of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42282', "Anti-Corn Law League")</script>. He was thereafter in the van of the league as organizer, fund-raiser, vocal member of the deputations to government, and speaker nationally (the A in the league's ABC). He identified strongly with Cobden's view of the wider benefits of free trade as part of the work of peace and progress, and saluted repeal in 1846 as the victory of &#145;business industry&#146; over &#145;titled power&#146;  (<span class="italic">The League</span>, 4 July 1846).<br>
<br>Ashworth's other activities also offered an example of &#145;class pride&#146;, for example, his support in Bolton for radical electoral reform, for municipal incorporation, for the <span class="italic">Bolton Free Press</span>, and for the education of the operatives, where he was an early supporter of national (state) education. He acted as a county JP, one of the first Quakers to do so. In the very different mood of the 1850s some of his more recalcitrant attitudes mellowed, but Ashworth, with Cobden, lamented the decline of the crusading &#145;league&#146; spirit, and it was in order to revive entrepreneurial radicalism that in 1859 he helped found the National Reform Union and stood, unsuccessfully, for Salford. He also supported Cobden's Anglo-French commercial treaty of 1860, and as president of the Manchester chamber of commerce (1862&#150;5) he promoted the cause of maritime law reform during the American Civil War, in which his sympathies lay mostly with the South (he visited America in 1857). More atypically, he campaigned as a member of the Cotton Supply Association for the state to promote cotton-growing in India during the cotton famine. Less prominent publicly after the second <span class="roman">Reform Act</span>, Ashworth in his eighties wrote, with the help of John Watts, <span class="italic">Recollections of Richard Cobden MP and the Anti-Corn Law League</span> (1876), a lengthy memorial which helped inculcate the powerful &#145;myth&#146; of the league, of which W. E. A. Axon's entry in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> is itself a fitting expression.<br>
<br>Ashworth married in 1823 Letitia Binns (1798&#150;1868), daughter of a Liverpool leatherseller and mother of six sons and five daughters. He remained a firm Quaker, a member, like Bright of the Marsden meeting. A handsome, physically powerful man, he enjoyed conversation and good company; he also had &#145;a most unquakerly passion for the gun&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), and regularly hired Scottish shooting lodges. He also travelled widely in Europe, the Near East, and North America. In his final years he wintered in Italy, and it was while returning from Rome that he died, of Roman fever, on 17 May 1880 at Florence. He is buried in the protestant cemetery there.<br>
