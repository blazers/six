<span class="headword">Boot,  John Campbell</span>, second Baron Trent  (1889&#150;1956), <span class="occ">retail and manufacturing chemist</span>, was born on 19 January 1889 in Nottingham, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31965/', "Jesse Boot (1850&#150;1931)")</script>, the founder of Boots retail chain and manufacturing chemists. His mother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70641/', "Florence Annie Boot, n&#233;e Rowe (1863&#150;1952)")</script>, being as absorbed in the business as his father, young John was brought up alongside their day-long attention to the continued development of Boots shops.<br>
<br>Boot was educated at the Leys School, Cambridge, and then spent a year at Jesus College, Cambridge, but was no scholar and greatly disappointed his father. He was employed in trivial work in the business until the First World War, when he was commissioned in the Sherwood Foresters, but served without distinction. In 1914 he married Margaret Joyce Pyman, the daughter of a shipowner. Jesse Boot's opinion of his son was so low that in 1920, following a period of ill health, he sold his controlling interest in Boots to an American group, the L. K. Liggett Company.<br>
<br>One of the few conditions attaching to the sale was that Liggetts should find jobs for Boot and the young finance director, J. E. Greenwood. To the elder Boot's surprise, the two were made directors, and took the lead as the first Boots executives to visit the US, where they studied efficient management practice and devised a new system to replace the autocracy left by the founder. Boot deeply resented his father's sell-out and took a sequence of initiatives to increase the company's independence, beginning with the sale of 25 per cent of the shares and flotation of a public company in 1923. This commitment to British control climaxed in the autumn of 1932, when the American owners became insolvent and were forced to sell. Boot placed himself at the head of a financial consortium which succeeded in driving off a more powerful syndicate in which Liggett allied himself with Philip Hill, the property tycoon and chairman of Beechams Pills, Taylors Cash Chemists (a northern retail chain), Timothy Whites (a southern chain), and a clutch of proprietary medicine companies. Boot's father had died the previous year and the new Lord Trent inherited not only his title but also, after the twelve years of American interregnum, his personal authority in the firm.<br>
<br>Despite their personal differences, Trent's interests within the business proved strikingly similar to those of his father. He made himself an undisputed authority on Boots shops and retail trade generally, and developed an almost instinctive sense of the efficiency of any branch he entered. But he was not so interested in manufacturing, which consequently continued to be the Cinderella of the business. Export sales were no more than a spillover from the firm's domestic retail operations. He calculated the strength of the business by the number of retail branches and regarded the closure of a shop as a defeat. In the 1920s the head of his estates department was opening a shop nearly every week; almost all of them were small pharmacies carrying traditional chemists' lines, as Trent believed that these were still the most profitable form of retailing in his sector of trade. The overall effect of this concentration on small shops was to reduce the importance of Boots departmental stores; by 1936 non-chemists' merchandise was down to a mere 13 per cent of turnover. The concentration on new retail outlets was challenged by Greenwood but Trent's policy prevailed until his retirement in 1954; he proudly opened the thousandth shop in 1933, and by the outbreak of war in 1939 another two hundred had been added. Probably the only divergence between Trent and his father on retail policy was that the former consciously strove to avoid the model of the popular American drug store. His aim was to raise Boots from a chain of cut-price medicine stores to well-appointed shops that offered value for money with variety, quality, and courteous service.<br>
<br>Trent's style of living was in total contrast to that of his father. He pursued to the full the life of a rich and distinguished businessman and public figure. He enjoyed hunting, shooting, fishing, and farming, indulging his passion at the 45,000 acre estate at Glenborrodale that his mother bought for him soon after his father's death. He liked to tour agricultural shows, exhibit pedigree animals, and distribute prizes. He was always immaculately dressed, owned a yacht and a fleet of cars, and entertained lavishly through the autumn at Glenborrodale and at Christmas at Lenton House, Nottingham. He was passionate about Scotland, prided himself on the Scottish line in his ancestry (commemorated in his name, John Campbell Boot), and loved to be a laird, wear a kilt, and retain his own piper. He fed this romantic streak by spending hours reading about Scotland and its history.<br>
<br>Trent inherited something of his parents' benevolent interest in the labour force, and the prosperity of Boots in the 1930s encouraged him to allow a substantial welfare dividend to factory workers. They in turn offered him their personal loyalty, as they had to his father. He toured the factories each Christmas to greet hundreds of staff and provide a direct personal connection. The opening of the first model factory at Beeston, Nottingham, in May 1932 not only introduced more pleasant working conditions for 1140 staff, but also led to an appreciable increase in productivity which allowed the company to reduce the working week from 47.5 to 42.5 hours per week and inaugurate the five-day week in 1934. A second factory was built on the Beeston site in two stages in 1936 and 1938, allowing the transfer of &#145;dry goods&#146; from the jumble of buildings in the city centre. A general pension fund for all male staff over twenty-one and female staff over thirty-five was launched in 1935, and a new building for Boots College, a day continuation college for the youngest employees, was built in 1938. These attractive innovations placed Boots in the forefront of progress in workers' welfare in Britain. Trent was as proud to demonstrate his achievements for his workers as any manorial lord was to show off his model estates.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Trent became civil commissioner for the east midlands region, effectively leaving J. P. Savage in charge of Boots. He was made KBE in 1946. The war years took their toll on Trent's health and in 1951 he suffered the first of a series of illnesses which forced him to retire in 1953. There were no major initiatives in Boots in the early post-war years, except that falling profitability compelled Trent to appoint a bright young accountant, Arthur Cockfield, whose policies laid the foundation of the later resurgence of the firm. Trent died at his home, The Grove, St Lawrence, Jersey, on 8 March 1956, after a long period of ill health. He had four daughters but no heir in the business, so that control passed out of family hands when his son-in-law, W. R. Norman, retired from the chairmanship in 1975.<br>
