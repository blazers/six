<span class="headword">Gilman,  Harold John Wilde</span>  (1876&#150;1919), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 11 February 1876 in Rode, Somerset, the second son of the seven children of John Gilman (1840&#150;1917), curate of Rode, and his wife, Emily Purcell Gulliver (1850&#150;1940). In 1890 the Revd John Gilman secured the livings of Snargate with Snave in Romney Marsh, Kent, and his son was enrolled as a boarder at Tonbridge School, where a year later he injured his hip in a heavy fall. Confined to bed for nearly two years and on crutches for a third, Gilman was educated privately, read a great deal, and began to sketch. In October 1894 he matriculated as a non-collegiate student at the University of Oxford but after one term left to take up a post as tutor to the children of an English family in Odessa. He enrolled in 1896 at the Hastings School of Art in Sussex, moving on to the Slade School of Fine Art in London in 1897, where he studied until 1901. His long training as an artist culminated in a visit to Spain from 1901 until 1903, where he copied paintings by Vel&aacute;zquez and Goya in Madrid's Museo del Prado. In the Prado in 1901 he met Grace Cornelia Canedy (<i>c</i>.1864&#150;<i>c</i>.1957), daughter of a wealthy Chicago industrialist and some twelve years his senior, who was also on a pilgrimage to copy Vel&aacute;zquez. They married on 2 February 1902 in the garden of the United States consulate in Toledo, Spain. Grace was about forty when their first child, Elizabeth, was born (19 January 1904) in England. The couple had three more children over the next five years.<br>
<br>The murals painted by Gilman in a Canadian government building in Ottawa in 1904 before he joined his wife in Chicago, where their daughter Hannah was born (4 February 1905), are lost, and few paintings of this early period have been traced. However, the influence of Vel&aacute;zquez is apparent in the cool silvery harmonies, fluent liquid brushwork, and sensitive grasp of tonal values of his earliest extant paintings (<i>c</i>.1905&#150;1908). His subjects&#151;at this period repeated studies of his wife and their young family in domestic settings&#151;were found closer to hand. From the outset he revealed an impressive mastery of formal compositional structure.<br>
<br>In February 1907 Gilman met Walter Sickert. Together with his Slade contemporary Spencer Gore, he became a founder member of the group which, under the formula &#145;Mr Sickert at home&#146;, rented premises at 19 Fitzroy Street in London to discuss, exhibit, and sell their work to discriminating patrons. In 1908, 1909, 1910, and 1912 he exhibited at the non-jury Salon des Ind&eacute;pendants in Paris, and from 1908 at its newly formed London counterpart, the Allied Artists Association. Meanwhile, the Fitzroy Street group expanded to incorporate Lucien Pissarro, Robert Bevan, and Charles Ginner. For Gilman, who in 1908 had moved from his parents' home in Romney Marsh to the new garden city of Letchworth, Hertfordshire, the opportunity Fitzroy Street afforded to develop his art and his ideas in collaboration with like-minded metropolitan colleagues was crucial. After 1909, when Grace Gilman, debilitated by childbirth and anaemia, took their three surviving children to Chicago and was subsequently unable to return, Gilman spent more time in London.<br>
<br>Between 1910 and 1914 Gilman transformed his execution. Within Fitzroy Street, the example of Gore and Pissarro had first persuaded him to adopt a crusty, broken touch and fuller, richer colour. Then, prompted by the overwhelming selection of key works by Gauguin, C&eacute;zanne, and Van Gogh included in the exhibition &#145;Manet and the post-impressionists&#146; masterminded by Roger Fry at the end of 1910, Gilman undertook a more radical overhaul of his style and technique. His passion for French post-impressionism, and above all for Van Gogh, was consolidated on a visit to Paris in the company of Ginner in 1911. On summer visits to Sweden (1912) and Norway (1913) he experimented with vivid colour, forcefully applied, sometimes in striated slashed strokes, sometimes in thickly encrusted broken touches, and sometimes in a patchwork of flat, simplified areas of paint. However daring his execution, he never lost control of the compositional structure of the land and townscape. A prime example is <span class="italic">The Canal Bridge, Flekkefjord</span> (1913, Tate collection), the first of his paintings to enter a British public collection (in 1922).<br>
<br>Throughout this period Gilman pursued the politics of the art world with single-minded passion. While Sickert was the actor&#150;manager and Gore the mediator, Gilman, with his more truculent personality, was the driving force behind the creation in 1911 of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64739/', "Camden Town Group")</script> and in 1913 of the London Group (of which he was first president). Sickert's portrait of about 1912 (Tate collection) captures his fiercely uncompromising character. His didactic temperament also found expression in his teaching, from 1912 to 1915 at the Westminster Technical Institute (where he took over Sickert's evening classes until the latter abruptly reclaimed his post) and in 1916&#150;17, with Ginner, at a private school they established in Soho.<br>
<br>While Gilman had appropriated the vocabulary of subjects developed in Fitzroy Street under Sickert's leadership&#151;dingy bed-sitters, shabby London streets, and nudes on metal bedsteads&#151;he rejected the dinginess of Sickert's palette. Instead he preached the gospel of pure, clean colour applied with no dilutant. He also brought a warmer humanity to his treatment of Sickertian themes. This is well seen in the series of interiors painted from 1914 to 1917 at 47 Maple Street, his first permanent London address, where from 1916 he found the ideal sitter in his landlady, Mrs Mounter (versions include those in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, Tate collection and Leeds City Art Gallery). Because he painted from drawn studies rather than directly from nature, Mrs Mounter is also the subject of many intricately worked reed-pen-and-ink drawings (a technique he brilliantly adapted from Van Gogh's example). Gilman's paintings of women, whether nude or clothed and of whatever age and class, reveal a rare tenderness. In portraits of his first wife, their nursemaid, his mother in Snargate rectory, his friends such as Mrs Bevan, and his second wife nursing their child, he achieved a perfect harmony between subject and treatment. The respect and affection with which Gilman portrays Mrs Mounter is sustained by the loving laboriousness of his handling, whether in paintings constructed from infinite touches of undiluted paint or drawings defined in myriad dots and dashes of ink.<br>
<br>In 1915 Gilman asked Grace for a divorce. He wished to marry his pupil at Westminster, (Dorothy) Sylvia Hardy, formerly Meyer (1892&#150;1971), daughter of Arthur Reginald Hardy, company director. Their son was born in December 1917. On 20 April 1918, on learning that the interlocutory phase of the divorce had been accomplished in California, they married. Later that year Gilman visited Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he worked with unrelenting dedication, in all weathers, to fulfil a commission from the Canadian war records. His large painting, <span class="italic">Halifax Harbour at Sunset</span> (1918), is now in the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa.<br>
<br>On 12 February 1919, a day after his forty-third birthday, Harold Gilman died in the French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue, London, a victim of the virulent post-war influenza epidemic. A memorial exhibition held that year at the Leicester Galleries was the first devoted to his work. Two earlier substantial shows at the Carfax Gallery in London had been shared, first with Gore (1913) and then with Ginner (1914). Ginner's catalogue introduction in 1914 had announced their credo as &#145;neo-realists&#146;, a term that encompassed the dedicated range of their art but not the resonant brilliance of Gilman's means of expression.<br>
<br>In 1921 Sylvia married Leofric Gilman, Harold's brother. She lived to witness growing appreciation of her first husband's achievement. An Arts Council retrospective exhibition was held in 1954&#150;5 and over the following years Gilman's work was acquired by major public galleries throughout the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth.<br>
