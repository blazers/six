<span class="headword">Booth,  Junius Brutus</span>  (1796&#150;1852), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 1 May 1796 near Tottenham Court Road, London, eldest of the three children of Richard Booth, a lawyer, and Jane Elizabeth Game. He had a brother who died in childhood and a sister. His mother claimed kinship with the radical politician John Wilkes. In his youth, Richard Booth had left England intending to fight for American independence, and America remained his mecca. Junius was classically educated, and, after trying painting, printing, the navy, law, and sculpture, settled on acting. He first appeared with an amateur company, then joined the Penley and Jonas management, and made his professional d&eacute;but as Campillo in <span class="italic">The Honey Moon</span> on 13 December 1813 in Deptford. The next year he toured the Netherlands with the company. Reputedly cited in adolescence in two paternity suits, he eloped with his Belgian landlady's daughter, Marie Christine Adelaide Delannoy (1792&#150;1858), and married her in London in 1815. They had two children.<br>
<br>Booth made his d&eacute;but at Covent Garden as Silvius in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> on 19 February 1816, but, seeing small chance of promotion, went to the Brighton and Worthing theatres, and on 25 September 1816 won notice substituting for Edmund Kean as Sir Giles Overreach. He was 5 feet 3 inches tall, slight, though muscular, with classical features, a pale complexion, brown wavy hair, and blue eyes, and resembled Kean in both physique and style; critics disagreed about whether he imitated Kean or both imitated nature. He returned to Covent Garden as Richard III&#151;Kean's most famous role&#151;but salary negotiations broke down, and he accepted Kean's invitation to join him at Drury Lane. He played Iago to Kean's Othello on 20 February 1817. Although he was outshone by Kean, young Booth's performance was applauded, and Hazlitt in <span class="italic">The Examiner</span> called it the best support of Kean he had seen. Finding that Kean intended to confine him to subordinate roles, Booth returned to Covent Garden, which claimed legal right to his services and now offered him a salary equalling that at Drury Lane. Offended at his defection, audiences at first refused to hear him when he appeared on stage. At the season's end he toured the provinces. Tired of acting, he considered joining the army, and his frustration showed itself in excessive drinking by 1818, when Keats referred to his inebriation. At Covent Garden in 1820 he played King Lear for the first time since George III's madness had caused the play to be banned. According to Hazlitt he played it with life, spirit, and human interest, his acting &#145;animated, vigorous, and pathetic throughout&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Works</span>, 18.328).<br>
<br>In 1821 Booth eloped with Mary Ann Holmes (1802&#150;1885), the daughter of a Lambeth seed merchant, and, having settled &pound;50 a year on his wife, left England. They landed in Norfolk, Virginia, on 30 June, and Booth appeared in Richmond on 6 July as Richard III, winning acclaim for the last two acts, in which, William Winter said, he always displayed &#145;a prodigious force and an impetuous, fiery, terrible passion&#146;, appearing &#145;like a whirlwind&#146; in the battle  (Winter, 99). He settled the question of imitation by performing one night in his own style, the next in Kean's. After playing at the Park Theatre, New York, in October, he toured the south. Always drawn to seek seclusion, Booth applied for the post of Cape Hatteras lighthouse keeper, but settled for a farm outside Bel Air, Maryland, which he alternated&#151;between tours&#151;with residences in Baltimore for the rest of his life. He wrote a verse melodrama, <span class="italic">Ugolino</span>, which was produced in his lifetime and revived by his sons.<br>
<br>For the 1825 season, Booth returned to England, where, to counteract scandal, he had his portrait painted with his wife and son. However, unfavourable economic conditions and newspaper hostility, combined with his refusing curtain calls, worked against his popularity. After touring the provinces and Amsterdam he returned to the United States. During the 1827&#150;8 season, while stage manager at the St Charles Theatre, New Orleans, Booth played Oreste in Racine's <span class="italic">Andromache</span> in French. Although drink and mental instability began to interfere with his work, and though sometimes he failed to appear when announced, he was repeatedly forgiven by both managers and audiences. In 1836&#150;7 he was again in England, but continued to suffer comparisons with Kean, and now also with W. C. Macready and the American tragedian Edwin Forrest, also in England at this time.<br>
<br>When his sister and her large family joined him in America, Booth was under increased financial pressure, and his drinking and mental aberrations increased. During fits he twice attempted suicide, and once broke his nose, damaging his voice; although he restored it through exercises, it remained somewhat nasal. He began taking his children with him as attendants on the road: Junius Brutus Booth Jr, Richard Junius Booth (his son by his Belgian wife), and, finally, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49695/', "Edwin Thomas Booth")</script>. His wife pursued him to America in 1846 and in April 1851 obtained a divorce. The next month Booth married Mary Ann, with whom he had produced ten children and enjoyed for many years what appeared a perfect marriage. He designed for his farm a stately residence, Tudor Hall (still standing), before travelling to California to act under his son Junius's management. On the way home he contracted a fever, and died on 30 November 1852. His body was shipped home and buried in Baltimore cemetery. In 1858 Edwin moved it to a family plot in Green Mount cemetery, Baltimore, where he erected a monument to &#145;matchless Booth&#146;.<br>
<br>Shy and unassuming, Booth was a gentle, devoted husband and father, happiest digging his garden, selling his vegetables, or giving small boys pony rides. He held all life sacred, and would not allow meat to be eaten in his house or animals to be killed on his farm. His public demonstrations for animal rights were notorious: he tried to arrange a funeral for slaughtered pigeons, and invited neighbours to the burial of his horse. He refused to own slaves. He attended both an Episcopal church and the Baltimore dockside sailors' chapel and reverenced all religions, seeing Christianity as &#145;a beautiful type of Man's approach to perfection&#146; but Hinduism as nearer that ideal. He was proficient in classical languages, spoke French fluently, and knew German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Hebrew, and some Arabic. Three sons followed him as starring tragedians, and both Edwin and John Wilkes achieved noteworthy reputations. His daughter Asia Booth Clarke wrote several books, including three memoirs of him. The distortions of the Kean&#150;Booth controversy, John Wilkes Booth's assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and the wide geographical spread of his reviews caused his fame after death to be eclipsed. He seems, however, to have been a theatrical genius, a founder of the Romantic style. He acted by inspiration, thrilled by magnetism. He was an expert fencer, notorious for chasing opponents off the stage. He was renowned for the beauty and variety of his voice, the excellence of his consonantal elocution, his use of silences and pauses. While watching Kean was like reading Shakespeare by flashes of lighting, Booth illuminated his text consistently. He was famed for villains&#151;Iago, Overreach, and Richard III&#151;remembered for such heroes as John Howard Payne's Brutus, and even succeeded in farce. He was remarkable for making his characters distinct individuals, and for electrifying audiences with conflicting emotion, terror, remorse, despair, scorn, hatred, and fury. In the dream scene of <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, the anonymous author of <span class="italic">The Actor</span> recalls, &#145;He rushed to the footlights with face ashen and limbs trembling, eyes rolling and gleaming and face and form convulsed in excitement&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Actor</span>, 105). James Murdoch said that he &#145;displayed the most wonderful combination of intellectual beauty and force with consummate skill which was ever exhibited in modern times&#146;  (Murdoch, 175). And, for Walt Whitman, &#145;The words, fire, energy, <i>abandon</i>, found in him unprecedented meanings&#146;  (Whitman, 2.597).<br>
