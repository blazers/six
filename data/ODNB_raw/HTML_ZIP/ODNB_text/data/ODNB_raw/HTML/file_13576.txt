<span class="headword">Holloway,  Thomas</span>  (1748&#150;1827), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born at 74 Broad Street, London, the eldest child of the two sons and two daughters of Thomas Holloway (<i>c</i>.1727&#150;1759), ironmonger, and his wife, Ann (1724&#150;1776). His brother, John, achieved some fame as a lecturer in animal magnetism. Since his mother's portrait was painted by John Russell (1745&#150;1806), it is possible that Thomas Holloway was encouraged by him. In due course he was articled to a seal engraver named Stent, and then in 1773 enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools. From the family home, between 1773 and 1777, he exhibited a variety of works at the Royal Academy, including seals, engraved gems, and portraits in crayon and oil. From 1781 to 1784 he lived at 88 Fleet Street and then from 1784 to 1792 at 11 Baches Row, City Road, Hoxton. In 1793 and 1795 he engraved Shakespearian paintings by Robert Smirke and Gavin Hamilton for Boydell's <span class="italic">Shakspeare Gallery</span>.<br>
<br>Holloway's largest project, however, was the English edition of J. C. Lavater's <span class="italic">Essays on Physiognomy</span>, translated by Dr Henry Hunter and published in five volumes (1789&#150;98). This work was illustrated with about 800 plates, executed by Holloway himself (about 300), Francesco Bartolozzi, William Blake, Daniel Chodowiecki, and others under the direction of Henry Fuseli. However, Holloway had overall control of the engravings, illustrated by his observation in an inscription to his engraving of J.-P. Bouchardon's bust of Charles XII of Sweden: &#145;The English artist has endeavoured &hellip; to excel the French original &hellip; but felt himself obliged to copy it correctly enough to support the ingenious Author's remarks&#146;  (Lavater, 1.229). His tailpieces reveal a lively imagination: one depicts seven human skulls, representing the ages from young to old, arranged in a circular group in a grassy plot. His skill in surface textures is seen in his engraving of John Brown's drawing of the marble head of Homer found at Baiae in 1780, also in the <span class="italic">Essays</span>.<br>
<br>In 1800&#151;with three young ex-pupils&#151;Holloway commenced a folio edition of engravings after the seven cartoons of Raphael then at Windsor (now in the Victoria and Albert Museum); as a result of his initial work he was appointed historical engraver to the king. In 1820, with four plates completed, the group moved to Coltishall, near Norwich; Holloway lived to see the fifth plate finished in 1824. He died, unmarried, at Coltishall on 19 February 1827. His nephew, John Holloway, wrote of him that he &#145;never [lost] the art of expressing himself gracefully and of reading elegantly &hellip; a person of short stature, and rather muscular form, he was yet graceful and dignified&#146;  (Holloway, 9).<br>
<br>The last plate of the Raphael cartoons, issued in 1839, sold for 10 guineas (the price for each of the first four had been 3 guineas), but even in 1848, when the value of the set was much higher, there was little demand. This was not the only ambitious artistic project to founder in this period of change.<br>
