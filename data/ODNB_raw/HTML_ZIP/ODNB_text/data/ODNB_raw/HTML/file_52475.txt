<span class="headword">Lewis,  Wilfrid Bennett</span>  (1908&#150;1987), <span class="occ">physicist and civil servant</span>, was born on 24 June 1908 in Castle Carrock, Cumberland, the second of four children of Arthur Wilfrid Lewis, a civil engineer, and his wife, Isoline Maud Steavenson. Lewis was a keen boyhood science experimenter and wireless enthusiast. After elementary education at Clare House Preparatory School, Beckenham, Kent, he attended Haileybury College (1922&#150;6), followed by a year in industry. Entering Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge in 1927, he read physics at the Cavendish Laboratory (BA, 1930; MA, 1934; PhD, 1934). During postgraduate studies he worked with Lord Rutherford. Lewis was research fellow at Gonville and Caius College (1934&#150;40), and demonstrator (1935&#150;7) and lecturer (1937&#150;9) in physics at Cambridge. Between 1935 and 1937 he joined J. D. Cockcroft in studying nuclear disintegration, then turned his electronic expertise to the construction of the Cambridge cyclotron. In 1939 he joined what became the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) to work on radar development, quickly establishing a reputation as a scientific administrator. He ended his career with the TRE at Malvern (1945&#150;6) as chief superintendent. His wartime work garnered him a CBE in 1946 and the American medal of freedom with silver palms in 1947.<br>
<br>Cockcroft had supervised the Canadian National Research Council's nuclear programme from April 1944. On his recall to England he nominated Lewis as his replacement. Lewis took up the post of director of its atomic energy division in September 1946. The division was just creating its new research centre at Chalk River, Ontario. He came with little knowledge of current nuclear physics and engineering, but with characteristic single-mindedness learned everything he could. His first task was to ensure completion of the national research experimental reactor, known as the NRX, which went critical in 1947. This was the world's finest high flux research reactor; it was also the first to have a nuclear accident in the same year, but Lewis responded coolly. The incident convinced him of the need for another research reactor, the NRU. Planning began in 1947 but it would not go critical until ten years later.<br>
<br>Lewis maintained regular scientific contact with Harwell, undertaking experimental work for Cockcroft in the 1950s, and exchanging scientific information with the British and American atomic energy agencies. When, in 1952, the government reorganized the division as a crown corporation, Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd (AECL), Lewis became vice-president, research and development. This allowed him to shed general administrative duties to concentrate on reactor design. As early as 1951 Lewis had championed the idea of a power reactor fuelled with natural uranium and moderated by heavy water. He persuaded the AECL board to support it and brought Ontario Hydro into the fold. Serious planning began in 1954. As a first step a nuclear power demonstration reactor (NPD) was built in Rolphton, Ontario. Its design and construction was a convoluted process, as AECL scientists and engineers grappled with conflicting technologies. Lewis acted as a stimulus and arbiter. When NPD began supplying power in 1962 it proved that the Canadian approach was feasible. By 1959 planning began for a power station employing the CANDU system, with horizontal pressure tubes, using natural uranium fuel and heavy water as both coolant and moderator. Lewis pushed the programme to successful completion of a full-scale commercial plant in 1971.<br>
<br>A key figure in international nuclear diplomacy, Lewis advised the World Bank, served on the United Nations scientific advisory committee, and helped to organize conferences on the peaceful uses of atomic energy. He sat on the scientific advisory committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (1958&#150;78). From 1963 until his retirement on 24 June 1973 he was senior vice-president, science, at AECL. Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, then appointed him distinguished professor of science. He continued to lecture and to write in favour of nuclear power. A winner of the Fermi prize (1982) and a fellow of the royal societies of London (1945) and Canada (1952), Lewis garnered many awards and honorary degrees. A devout Anglican and community figure he remained unmarried. Diagnosed as having Alzheimer's disease in 1982 he spent his last five years in hospital, and died in Deep River, Ontario, on 10 January 1987, where he was buried.<br>
