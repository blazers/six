<span class="headword">Adam <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>King]</span>,  Ruth Augusta</span>  (1907&#150;1977), <span class="occ">writer and feminist</span>, was born on 14 December 1907 at the vicarage in Arnold, a mining parish in Nottinghamshire, the second of the four children of the Revd Rupert William King (1874&#150;1955), a Church of England vicar, and Annie Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wearing (1878&#150;1945). She was educated from 1920 to 1925 at St Elphin's, Darley Dale, Derbyshire, a girls' boarding-school, and she then taught for five years in poverty-stricken elementary schools in the mining area of Nottinghamshire. On 24 May 1932 she married Kenneth Adam (1908&#150;1978), a journalist on the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> who later became the first director of BBC television.<br>
<br>Ruth Adam's best novel, <span class="italic">I'm Not Complaining</span>, a tartly anti-Lawrentian view of women's lives in the depression, narrated by an unmarried woman teacher, was published in 1938 and was reissued as a <span class="roman">Virago Modern Classic</span> in 1983. Between 1937 and 1947 Ruth Adam had four children (a daughter, the journalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/104780/', "Corinna Adam")</script>, and three sons) but she also managed to work for the Ministry of Information during the war and to write several novels of social reportage, a child's history of America, many radio scripts, including radio plays and broadcasts for the BBC's <span class="italic">Woman's Hour</span>, as well as the first of her <span class="italic">Church of England Newspaper</span> women's pages. Between 1944 and 1976 Ruth Adam wrote more than 2000 of these weekly &#145;pages&#146; in which she was free to articulate her position as a Christian socialist feminist for a sometimes startled readership composed mainly of church wives. She raised such issues as paid work for married women, the necessity for good childcare, and the social usefulness of older women in the community, and she also discussed the wider issues of the need for peace and justice and for an enlightened penal policy towards juvenile offenders, the plight of refugees, and the historical significance of Sylvia Pankhurst and the suffragettes. Her standpoint was that of a commonsensical &#145;social feminist&#146; who insisted on the value of the work done by mothers in the home as well as on the contribution of women in careers.<br>
<br>In 1955 Ruth Adam, with her friend the London county councillor Peggy Jay, co-founded the Fisher Group, a think-tank on social policy and the family which gave evidence to government committees of inquiry and contributed to such legislative reforms as the 1963 and 1969 <span class="roman">Children and Young Persons Acts</span> and the <span class="roman">Local Authority Social Service Act</span> of 1970. Arising out of this concern Ruth Adam wrote her disturbing novels <span class="italic">Fetch Her Away</span> (1954) and <span class="italic">Look Who's Talking</span> (1960) about girls in care, which are rare in their sympathetic depiction of women social workers. A stark contrast is her novel <span class="italic">A House in the Country</span> (1957), which gives a comic account of her own family's attempt at living in a commune. In 1966 and 1967 she published books on G. B. Shaw and on Beatrice Webb. Perhaps Ruth Adam's most unusual achievement was her writing, at the very end of her life, of <span class="italic">A Woman's Place, 1910&#150;1975</span>, a succinct, witty, and trenchant social history of British women in the twentieth century that pulled the many interests of her own life together. Ruth Adam remained intellectually alert and alive to new ideas and events and this last book testifies to her thoughtful analysis of the gains and losses for British women up to and including the women's liberation movement. That she has been overlooked in the history of British feminist writing is largely due to her choice of a non-feminist readership&#151;teenage girls for her comic strip <span class="italic">Susan: a Girl Nurse</span> in <span class="italic">Girl</span>; harassed vicars' wives in draughty, impoverished parsonages for her women's page in the <span class="italic">Church of England Newspaper</span>; and overworked women in the caring professions for her booklets and fiction on children in need. Moreover she was never an extremist, and hence escaped citation by both friends and foes of the women's movement. Ruth Adam's whole life testified to her kind of optimistic, gradualist feminism. Her marriage was a partnership of genuine equals and she regarded the children as the first job in hand for herself and her husband. But she was rarely seen without a book or a writing-pad, whether by the kitchen stove or in a hospital bed. Ruth Adam died at the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth, Marylebone, London, on 3 February 1977.<br>
