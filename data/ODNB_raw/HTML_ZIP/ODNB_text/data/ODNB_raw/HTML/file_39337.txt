<span class="headword">Delaval,  John Hussey</span>, Baron Delaval  (1728&#150;1808), <span class="occ">industrialist and politician</span>, was born on 17 March 1728, the second of twelve children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76465/', "Captain Francis Blake Delaval RN (bap. 1692, d. 1752)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73888/', "Delaval family")</script>] and his wife, Rhoda Apreece (<i>d</i>. 1759), heiress, of Doddington, Lincolnshire [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73888/', "Delaval family (per. c.1520&#150;1752)")</script>]. His father, born Francis Delaval, changed his name to Francis Blake on inheriting the Ford estate in north Northumberland in 1718, and then to Francis Blake Delaval in 1729, on inheriting the coal-rich coastal estates at Seaton Delaval and at Hartley in south-east Northumberland. His younger brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7454/', "Edward Hussey Delaval")</script>. John Delaval was educated at Westminster School and Eton College. He went to Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1746, but his academic career was curtailed when the &#145;Captain Hargreaves&#146; living with him proved to be female. He married Susanna Potter, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Robinson (<i>d</i>. 1783), widow of John Potter, on 2 April 1750, thereby acquiring property in Soho and Mayfair, Westminster. By 1756 he had effectively superseded his hedonistic and profligate elder brother Francis as head of the family, and the fortunes of the estates, then carrying debts of &pound;45,000, thereafter depended upon him.<br>
<br>Ford, a rural and largely barren estate of about 7000 acres, was enclosed and divided by Delaval. By 1794 plantations had been established, and farmsteads extended or rebuilt, at a cost of &pound;9000; another &pound;10,500 was devoted to remodelling the castle. Delaval favoured improving farm leases and having &#145;practical&#146; farmers as tenants&#151;having a known dislike of gentlemen farmers&#151;and was able to increase the estate rental from about &pound;1000 to nearly &pound;5000 by 1794. Existing collieries and limeworks were extended, and a brick and tile works and an iron forge were established. As an industrial centre Hartley was always more significant than Ford. Because of its natural harbour, there had been fishing, coalmining, and salt making since the thirteenth century, but Delaval added considerably to these activities. Under skilled agents, pumping engines and wagon-ways were introduced at the pits. The increased coal outputs, together with the establishment of a glass-bottle works in 1762, then required an improved harbour, and this was achieved in 1764 at a reputed cost of &pound;10,000.<br>
<br>The improved harbour at Seaton Sluice allowed faster turnaround times for the collier brigs, thereby increasing the vend and market price of Hartley coals. It also facilitated the import of raw materials for the glassworks, and the export of its products. By 1788, Delaval's Royal Northumberland Bottle Works had become the largest such enterprise in the country, a position it held until the 1800s, its output having reached 200,000 dozen bottles per year. Copperas production was also begun, using iron pyrites found in some coals, to provide a colouring agent for the glassworks, and also for export. The glass and copperas works, like the salt works before them, utilized the almost unsaleable small coals from the Hartley pits.<br>
<br>Delaval encouraged his agents to be innovative in these developments, but he maintained close overall control, except for a period after 1764 when family disagreements saw his younger brother Thomas assume responsibility for the Hartley enterprises. Thomas was no businessman, however, and his financial difficulties enabled John to resume control in 1771. This was a prelude to further family upsets. John had succeeded to the Doddington estate in 1759 (adding Hussey to his name), only to lose it to his brother Edward in 1774. Having spent &pound;17,000 on improvements there, John sought revenge by ordering every tree on the estate to be felled. He was created a baronet on 1 July 1761.<br>
<br>By 1770 the Hartley pits alone employed 300 hands, and in 1777 some 48,000 tons of coal were shipped coastwise, about 180 ships cleared the harbour, and around &pound;24,000 was paid in port revenues. Such success did not enamour Delaval to the Tyneside coal traders, especially when he refused to be bound by their cartel arrangements. Another development was the industrial village alongside the harbour. By 1790 Seaton Sluice, with forty-three cottage houses in the predictably named John, Hussey, and Delaval streets, also had a market square, a school, a brewery, and public houses, so that &#145;no man should have an opportunity of gaining money here, and spending it elsewhere&#146;  (Askham, 128).<br>
<br>As a politician Delaval defeated the young John Wilkes at Berwick in the general election of 1754, and when Wilkes subsequently disputed the result, Delaval made a flippant speech &#145;full of wit, humour, and buffoonery, which kept the House in a roar&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>), but which brought harsh words from William Pitt (1759&#150;1806). Delaval lost the seat in 1761, regained it at a by-election in 1765, and held it in 1768. Failing to win the Berwick freemen's support for Wilkes's plans for electoral reform, Delaval lost a county seat in the election of 1774 but was returned for Berwick as a whig in 1780. Initially he supported Charles James Fox's plan to regulate the East India Company; but he later changed his party. On 24 May 1784 Delaval:<blockquote>astonished a great many by a very warm, explicit declaration that he had, in the last Parliament, opposed Mr Pitt as a supposed minister of secret influence, but having now heard so unequivocally from the people themselves that he was <i>their</i> minister, he should most heartily obey their voice, and give him all the support he deserved. (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>)</blockquote>Delaval had received an Irish peerage in 1783, and Pitt rewarded him with an English peerage in 1786 to strengthen tory support in the Lords. Delaval's elevation led to his being mentioned in &#145;The Rolliad&#146;, and he was the butt of an opposition satire, &#145;The Delavaliad&#146;.<br>
<br>Susanna died in 1783, and Delaval took the sixteen-year-old Elizabeth Hicks as his mistress in 1786, spending lavishly on her. Miss Hicks died in 1796, having from 1795 shared Delaval's affections with Susanna Elizabeth Knight (<i>c</i>.1762&#150;1822), whom he finally married on 5 January 1803.<br>
<br>Delaval banked with Surtees and Burdon in Newcastle, but also with Hoares &amp; Co. in London, and when the former crashed in 1803 he faced a degree of financial embarrassment. His losses are uncertain, but he asked Newcastle tradesmen to accept payment in coal rather than money, and sold the contents of his wine cellar. However, presumably cushioned by his deposits with Hoares &amp; Co., he was able to maintain a family even keel, the housekeeping expenses at Seaton Delaval for 1807 amounting to &pound;2,390.<br>
<br>Delaval died without a male heir on 17 May 1808 at Seaton Delaval Hall and was buried in June 1808 in St Paul's Chapel at Westminster Abbey. The Ford estate, the Hartley glassworks, and his personal possessions passed to his widow for life. His entailed estates at Seaton Delaval and Hartley devolved upon his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7454/', "Edward Hussey Delaval")</script>, on whose death in 1814 the Delaval family became extinct in the male line.<br>
