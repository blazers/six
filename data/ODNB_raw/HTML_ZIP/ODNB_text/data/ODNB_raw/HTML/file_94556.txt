<span class="headword">Ainsworth,  John</span>  (1864&#150;1946), <span class="occ">colonial administrator</span>, was born at 29 Lyme Street, Chorlton upon Medlock, Lancashire, on 16 June 1864, the son of John Dawson Ainsworth, commercial traveller, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bond. His eight years of formal education were meant to prepare him for commercial employment. At the age of twenty he visited the west African coast; this led to employment with an English trading company in the lower Congo basin. After returning to Britain in 1889 he took employment with the Imperial British East Africa Company. He spent just over two years in charge of the company's transport and supply operations in what later became known as Kenya. In February 1892 he was placed in charge of the company's Machakos station. When in 1895 the British government assumed the administration of what was then known as the British East Africa Protectorate, Ainsworth remained in charge of Machakos as sub-commissioner of Ukamba province. In this role he completed the process of establishing control over the Machakos Kamba. Just as important, he helped lay the foundations of the British alliance with the Maasai, so crucial for the early history of Kenya. Also at Machakos, he met Ina Cameron Scott, a Scots-American who had come to the region as a missionary. She was the daughter of John Scott, of Brooklyn. They married in November 1897.<br>
<br>With the arrival of the Uganda railway at Nairobi in 1899 Ainsworth switched his provincial offices to the future capital of Kenya. As chief government official in Nairobi during the first years of its existence he played a central role in the development of the new township, where he remained until 1906. While in Nairobi he founded the East African Agricultural and Horticultural Society and edited its journal, the <span class="italic">East Africa Quarterly</span>. He was also deeply involved with the start of European settlement in the protectorate after 1902. Nevertheless he soon became concerned at the way in which land was being provided to European farmers at the expense of Kikuyu households. He was at least able to gain acceptance of the policy of setting aside land reserved for the Kikuyu, and later the Maasai, that could not be alienated. He was influential in gaining acceptance of the creation of two reserves for the Maasai that were recognized by treaty in 1904. His success in the initial years of British rule was recognized by his being made CMG in 1900. He enjoyed further success when in 1907 he took charge of Nyanza province. For the next ten years his efforts led to the establishment of the most efficient administrative unit in the protectorate. By the start of the First World War Nyanza had become the leading producer of exports from the protectorate, generating profits for the railway and revenue for the protectorate. The war brought huge challenges for Ainsworth. His success in mobilizing increased production and supplies of manpower led to his being appointed military commissioner for labour with the rank of colonel in March 1917. His main responsibility was to arrange for the forcible recruitment of African men as porters for the military campaign in southern German East Africa (Tanganyika). He was awarded the DSO in 1918 for his achievement.<br>
<br>In June 1918 Ainsworth was appointed adviser on native affairs, and later in the year the protectorate's first chief native commissioner. Down to his departure from Kenya in August 1920 (the year after he was made CBE) Ainsworth was under continual attack from European settlers for what they perceived as his pro-African attitude while they experienced a post-war shortage of labour for their farms. The governor, Sir Edward Northey, took the side of the settlers, and in October 1919 he issued a labour circular over Ainsworth's name that required government officials to recruit labour for settler enterprises. Ainsworth disagreed with the circular and Northey's policy of giving state support exclusively to European agriculture, but he was unable to undertake any effective opposition until after his retirement. Faced with the huge controversy that had developed in Britain over the labour circular, the Colonial Office consulted Ainsworth in 1921. His advice led the Colonial Office to alter Northey's policy.<br>
<br>Ainsworth and his wife retired initially to Manchester and then to Guernsey, but in late 1923 they decided to move to South Africa. They made the move in 1925 after he had completed a study of administrative arrangements in the mandated territory of New Guinea, on behalf of the Australian government, in 1924&#150;5. He settled at Somerset West in Cape Province and enjoyed an active retirement there, serving as mayor of the town during 1928&#150;30. He died at Somerset West on 31 March 1946.<br>
<br>Ainsworth played a most influential role in the first quarter century of British rule in Kenya. His career illustrated one of the fundamental contradictions in the colony's history: should it be developed economically by African peasant production or by European farmers? Ainsworth believed that African production was vital to the territory's future economic viability.<br>
