<span class="headword">Davies,  Robert</span>  (1658&#150;1710), <span class="occ">naturalist and antiquary</span>, was born on 15 March 1658, probably at Gwysane, Flintshire, one of eight children of Mutton Davies (1634&#150;1684) and his wife, Elizabeth Wilbraham (1641&#150;1678). His father was a great traveller and significantly improved his house and gardens at Llannerch, Denbighshire. Davies matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 2 April 1677 and became a member of the Inner Temple. He subsequently served as an alderman of Denbighshire (1685) and high sheriff both of Denbighshire (1687) and of Flintshire (1704). He married Letitia, daughter of Edward Vaughan and a granddaughter of Sir John Vaughan of Trawsgoed, Cardiganshire, on 2 December 1681. They had at least three children. He continued a family tradition of scholarly enquiry. His great-grandfather Robert Davies (1581&#150;1633), or perhaps his grandfather Robert Davies (1616&#150;1666), prepared &#145;A catalogue of ye British names of plants&#146;, a list of some 250 Welsh names of plants which was printed in the second edition of John Gerard's <span class="italic">The Herball, or, Generall Historie of Plants</span> (1636). His great-grandfather also seems to have been actively interested in his library, judging from a few references to books and manuscripts in his correspondence. His grandfather Robert Davies was called upon to assist the genealogist Randle Holmes in his work.<br>
<br>Robert Davies (1658&#150;1710) built upon the foundation collections which he had inherited to create at Llannerch one of the major libraries of seventeenth-century Wales and one which, to their great credit, he and his heirs opened to Welsh scholars. A catalogue compiled in 1740 listed 42 Latin manuscripts (including <span class="italic">Liber Landavensis</span>), 30 English manuscripts, and 16 Welsh manuscripts (including the translations made by their kinsman Bishop Richard Davies for the 1567 <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in Welsh). Robert Davies was but one of a circle of antiquaries and naturalists in north Wales: these included Thomas Price, William Maurice, and later Humphrey Humphreys and Josiah Babington, with whom Edward Lhuyd formed close links and who gave the Oxford scholar information and practical support.<br>
<br>Most of Davies's correspondence with his wife deals with personal and family matters, but a few of her letters refer to their gardens at Llannerch. Other letters refer to the purchasing of books and manuscripts and to the repair of his telescope. His correspondence with Edward Lhuyd, and indirectly with Josiah Babington, reveals more of his serious interest in contemporary Welsh scholarship. He gave Lhuyd informed views on manuscript collections, Welsh history, local antiquities, seals, heraldry, inscriptions, and natural history, and also consulted manuscripts at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. Though little of their correspondence has survived, it is clear that the two were on friendly terms. Davies contributed generously to the costs of Lhuyd's research tour of the British Isles and Lhuyd listed some of the contents of his library in <span class="italic">Archaeologia Britannica</span> (1707). Davies died on 8 July 1710 at Llannerch, Denbighshire, and was buried at Mold church, Flintshire.<br>
<br>His son, <a name="cosubject_7258"></a><span class="headword">Robert Davies</span>  (1685/6&#150;1728), pursued similar interests and was acknowledged as a serious <span class="occ">antiquary</span>. He studied at Brasenose College, Oxford, matriculating on 27 June 1702. He died on 22 May 1728. A notable effigy of him by Henry Cheere was erected in Mold church, showing him attired in Roman costume, and a portrait of him is at Gwysane. Robert senior's grandson Robert Davies (1710&#150;1763) continued the tradition of scholarly patronage. He was a friend of the Welsh scholar and poet Evan Evans (Ieuan Fardd), who referred to him warmly and composed an elegy to him. His son, Peter Davies, died unmarried and intestate in 1785, and the estate and the library were divided and passed to his two sisters.<br>
