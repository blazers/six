<span class="headword">Booth,  Barton</span>  (1681&#150;1733), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was the youngest of the three sons of John Booth, a Lancashire squire and a member of the extended family of the earls of Warrington. His family moved to London in 1684 after their estate became impaired. He was sent to Westminster School, then under the headmastership of Dr Richard Busby, where he developed a taste for both poetry and performance. He made his first acting appearance there as Pamphilus in a school production of Terence's <span class="italic">Andria</span>. Although arrangements had been made for him to attend Trinity College, Cambridge, in order later to pursue a clerical career, Booth instead sought to join the acting profession. Following an unsuccessful application to Thomas Betterton at the playhouse in Lincoln's Inn Fields, in June 1698 he set off to Dublin to act for Joseph Ashbury at the Smock Alley Theatre. He gave his first professional performance there, in &#145;blackface&#146; as Oroonoko, earning himself 5 guineas. This initial success ensured his engagement for the 1698&#150;9 season in Dublin, and he was entrusted with key roles in three of George Etherege's comedies: <span class="italic">The Comical Revenge</span>, <span class="italic">The Man of Mode</span>, and <span class="italic">She Would if she Could</span>.<br>
<br>Booth was back in London in 1700 and, with a letter of introduction from Lord Fitzhardinge and the recommendation of the actor John Boman (or Bowman), was accepted by Betterton at Lincoln's Inn Fields. He gave his first performance there late in 1700 as Maximus in John Fletcher's <span class="italic">Valentinian</span>, and was sufficiently impressive to be offered that December the role of Artaban in the first play by his former schoolfriend Nicholas Rowe, <span class="italic">The Ambitious Stepmother</span>. In January 1701 he appeared as Gratiano in Lord Lansdowne's <span class="italic">The Jew of Venice</span>, typical of the secondary roles he was to continue playing for the next decade. In 1704 he married Frances (<i>d</i>. 1710), the second daughter of Sir William Barkham, third baronet, of Norfolk.<br>
<br>Betterton moved to the newly erected Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket on 17 April 1705, taking Booth with him. Booth continued to play supporting characters, but slowly developed a firm reputation for serious roles. His annual salary of &pound;100 was not as substantial as those paid to his seniors, Betterton, Robert Wilks, John Mills, and George Powell; his talents were clearly being ignored by Wilks, who had considerable say in the casting of productions and who would invariably favour his friend, the less capable John Mills. However, Booth was an ambitious and hard-working actor; his persistence paid off, winning him better roles over the years, including Hotspur in <span class="italic">1 Henry IV</span> and Laertes in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, both in 1707. The company moved during the 1707&#150;8 season to Christopher Rich's Drury Lane Theatre, where Booth appeared for the first time as the Ghost in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, a role in which he was considered to be unrivalled. This was to be a key step in building his reputation as a formidable player of weighty and tragic roles.<br>
<br>The lord chamberlain closed Drury Lane in June 1709 following actors' complaints that Rich maintained a tyrannical regime there. It opened again for the 1709&#150;10 season with Aaron Hill as manager, and with Booth as its leading player, giving performances as Othello, Brutus in <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span>, Valentine in William Congreve's <span class="italic">Love for Love</span>, and Horatio in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>. The change in management, however, had not brought an end to the turbulence of the theatre's internal politics, and the actors complained that Hill did not involve them enough in casting decisions. When Hill withdrew a joint management agreement involving eight actors, including Booth, the season was brought to a close with an effective mutiny. With Hill out of London, a group of actors led by Booth, Powell, Theophilus Keene, and John Bickerstaff refused to take to the stage and threatened to make off with a collection of costumes. The situation turned nasty, and ended with a sword being held to Hill's throat. Booth and his fellow rebels were suspended until the end of the season. Repercussions from the incident perhaps manifested themselves during 1710&#150;11, when Booth had to revert to playing some of his secondary roles and to sharing leads with Powell. At the end of this season Booth regained status under the new management of Colley Cibber, Wilks, and Thomas Doggett.<br>
<br>Booth's performance on 17 March 1712 as Pyrrhus in Ambrose Philips's <span class="italic">The Distressed Mother</span> was much lauded. His achievement was consolidated a year later by his original portrayal of the title role in Joseph Addison's <span class="italic">Cato</span> (14 April 1713); the critical and financial success of this production brought him to the forefront of his profession, establishing him firmly as an actor of significance, and also served to further his ambition to be admitted to the management of the theatre. A letter to the lord chamberlain (dated 16 December 1712), and the patronage of Lord Bolingbroke, resulted in Cibber, Wilks, and Doggett's receiving the command of Queen Anne to share the management with Booth, causing no small resentment. Booth's key position at the theatre, coupled with his recent accolades, gave him the chance to tackle roles he had long coveted. In the following seasons he gave performances as Timon of Athens, King Lear, Banquo in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, Jaffier in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>, Bajazet in Rowe's <span class="italic">Tamerlane</span>, and Melantius in Beaumont and Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Maid's Tragedy</span>. He was also an able poet, and published his masque <span class="italic">The Death of Dido</span> following its performance with music by John Christopher Pepusch at Drury Lane on 17 April 1716.<br>
<br>Booth married his second wife, the actress and dancer Hester Santlow [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24662/', "Booth, Hester (c.1690&#150;1773)")</script>], on 3 August 1719, at Chipping Ongar, Essex. They enjoyed a successful, loving marriage; his poems on her were affectionate, and in his will he named her as the sole inheritor of his estate. She, in turn, erected a memorial to him in Westminster Abbey forty-five years after his death. There were no children of either marriage.<br>
<br>Though past his prime, Booth continued treading the boards, adding only occasionally to his repertory, for example, with Anthony in John Dryden's <span class="italic">All for Love</span> and Fainfall in Congreve's <span class="italic">The Way of the World</span> in 1718. He continued to work hard and regularly, but was often said to perform without any true conviction unless his enthusiasm could be sufficiently mustered. He worked at a steady and reliable pace throughout the 1720s, burdened somewhat by his administrative duties, until September 1726, when he suffered a fever that lasted forty-six days. This effectively kept him from the stage until January 1727. The following season he was to play the part of Julio in Lewis Theobald's <span class="italic">The Double Falsehood</span>, but was taken ill on the opening night (13 December 1727) and had to be replaced by his understudy. He managed to resume his role on the fifth night, but after his performance on 9 January 1728 Booth walked off the stage for the last time, conceding to an illness which was eventually diagnosed as jaundice.<br>
<br>Booth spent the rest of his life in pursuit of good health. In 1728 he stayed for three months in Bath and a further three weeks in Belgium in search of medical cure and advice. He died back in London, at his home, 4 Charles Square, Covent Garden, on 10 May 1733, following six months of recurring colic and a foolish attempt at a cure which prescribed the daily ingestion of mercury. He was buried, according to his wishes, at the parish church of St Laurence, Cowley, near Uxbridge, on 17 May 1733.<br>
<br>As an actor Booth earned the admiration of his contemporaries. Thomas Davies said he was &#145;an actor of genius&#146;  (Davies, 279), and Theophilus Cibber considered him to have a natural talent, praised his voice and articulation, and commented warmly on his ability in roles of dignity and majesty, particularly Hotspur and Lothario. Aaron Hill spoke of his &#145;gestures&#146;, of his &#145;particular grace&#146;, his &#145;elegant negligence&#146;, and his &#145;talent of discovering the passions where they lay hid in some celebrated parts by the injudicious practice of other actors&#146;  (Russell, 56).<br>
