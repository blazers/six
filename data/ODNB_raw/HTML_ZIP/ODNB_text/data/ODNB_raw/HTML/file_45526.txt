<span class="headword">Hart,  Henry George</span>  (1843&#150;1921), <span class="occ">headmaster</span>, was born on 16 April 1843 at Poona, India, of northern Irish descent, the second child and eldest son of William Hart (<i>c</i>.1816&#150;1904), East India Company servant&#151;fifth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12477/', "General George Vaughan Hart (1752&#150;1832)")</script> of Kilderry, co. Donegal&#151;and his wife, Frances Anne (<i>d</i>. 1898), daughter of Edward Frere of Llanelli, Brecknockshire, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10171/', "Sir (Edward) Bartle Frere (1815&#150;1884)")</script>. Hart was educated at a day school in Bath and a boarding-school near Taunton, neither of which he liked, and from February 1858 to summer 1862 at Rugby School under Frederick Temple (headmaster 1857&#150;69), to whom he became devoted. Lastingly influenced by the school's Arnoldian values, he enjoyed and was successful at Rugby. He played football&#151;even when an adult he displayed his &#145;Big Side&#146; cap in his study&#151;and became head of School House. In later years he &#145;used to speak with less enthusiasm of his university than of his school&#146;  (Coulton, <span class="italic">Victorian Schoolmaster</span>, 55). In October 1862 he went to St John's College, Cambridge (admitted pensioner May 1862, scholar 1864), with a Rugby exhibition. He had &pound;110 a year in scholarships and an allowance from his father. A &#145;reading man&#146;, he worked hard, rowed, played football, edited the college magazine, <span class="italic">The Eagle</span>, and was &#145;a man of high moral influence and of bright and attractive personality&#146;  (ibid., 53). In 1866 he was seventh classic (BA 1866, MA 1869), and was a fellow from 1867 until his marriage in 1873.<br>
<br>At Rugby he had wanted to become a cavalry officer, but in 1866, invited by the headmaster of Haileybury College, Arthur Gray Butler, old Rugbeian and Hart's master at Rugby, Hart became a classics master at Haileybury, the public school recently established in the buildings of the former East India College where Hart's father had been educated. His salary was &pound;150 plus accommodation and extras, and he again played football. A keen fisherman, from 1867 to 1914 he holidayed and fished in Norway, and he learned Norwegian. On 9 August 1873 he married Honoria Letitia (1850&#150;1923), orphaned only surviving daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16179/', "Sir Henry Lawrence (1806&#150;1857)")</script>. From 1873 to 1879 Hart was a classics master at Harrow School, with an income of over &pound;500 a year. Fair-haired, hazel-eyed, short, and of apparently frail build, he greatly impressed contemporaries by his character: his goodness, sincerity, dedication, and earnestness. A devout Anglican&#151;though as a young man he had serious doubts and was &#145;a very broad Churchman&#146;  (Coulton, <span class="italic">Fourscore Years</span>, 215)&#151;he believed Christianity crucial to education. According to his biographer, &#145;his every action was consciously and deliberately guided by religion&#146;  (Coulton, <span class="italic">Victorian Schoolmaster</span>, 138). Daily with his wife he read a portion of <span class="italic">The Imitation of Christ</span>.<br>
<br>The free grammar school of King Edward VI at Sedbergh, remote in the West Riding of Yorkshire, was founded about 1525 and munificently endowed with land in Yorkshire. After various vicissitudes it reached a nadir in the 1860s under the disastrous headmastership of the Revd Henry George Day (1830&#150;1900, headmaster 1861&#150;74), who by incapacity and neglect reduced the school to thirteen pupils: in 1865 no new pupil joined. Following scathing reports by the Taunton commission and others, there was a proposal to end the school and use its endowments elsewhere, but in 1874 it was reconstituted by the endowed schools commission. Day was pensioned off, and lived as a parasite on the resources of the school he had so nearly destroyed. The new governors appointed as headmaster the Revd Frederick Heppenstall (<i>c</i>.1835&#150;1879). He revived Sedbergh, increasing its numbers, but died suddenly of an incurable disease in July 1879: Hart said he &#145;had restored the School from nothing into a School&#146;  (Clarke and Weech, 150).<br>
<br>From 1880 to 1900 Hart was headmaster of Sedbergh. He was successful, and contemporaries thought him &#145;a remarkable man&#146;  (Coulton, <span class="italic">Fourscore Years</span>, 213) and &#145;a great headmaster&#146;  (Coulton, <span class="italic">Victorian Schoolmaster</span>, 183), but essentially he was neither original nor innovative. Rather he transferred Arnoldian traditions and the normal externals of a public school to Sedbergh, ran the school well, inspired confidence in it, increased the numbers of its pupils&#151;to about 200, he did not want more&#151;and masters, improved its buildings and facilities, and gained examination successes. He worked hard, teaching and without clerical assistance except from his wife. Self-sacrificing and generous, he subsidized the school. He himself paid for masters and house scholars from 1891 to 1900 &pound;3878. He won the respect and affection of masters and boys. The latter nicknamed him Daddy, soon abbreviated to Da. His achievement was made possible by the support and generosity of the governors, and especially Sir Francis Sharp Powell, first baronet (1827&#150;1911), old Sedberghian, Conservative MP, chairman of the governors from 1884, and a munificent benefactor whose donations included the sanatorium and the gymnasium. Hart introduced rugby football, the wearing of caps and gowns by masters, and in the Arnoldian tradition initiated the building of a chapel where he preached. In 1883 he was licensed as a lay reader. His assistant masters included H. W. Fowler and G. G. Coulton. In 1891 his health broke down and he spent the Lent term of 1892 away recuperating. He resigned in 1900. Under him Sedbergh had become a successful, if lesser, public school. Typically he gave his large testimonial sum to the school, and it was spent on the drawing school. In 1901 he published <span class="italic">Sedbergh School Sermons</span>.<br>
<br>Hart had broken from his family's traditional Conservatism and become a Liberal, supporting Irish home rule and women's suffrage, but he gave up overt political activity lest it harm Sedbergh. He was reportedly a member of both the Peace Society and the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95555', "National Service League")</script>.<br>
<br>Hart moved in 1901 to Wimbledon, where he named his house Sedbergh. He visited India and Ceylon, was a temporary Board of Education secondary school inspector and an inspector for the Oxford and Cambridge Board, worked on the Wimbledon Guild of Help, was a governor of Wimbledon high school, and from 1904 to 1919 was an &#145;invaluable member&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wimbledon Boro' News</span>, 2) of the Wimbledon education committee. In the First World War he was a volunteer Norwegian translator at the War Office. Paralysed from late 1918, he died on 12 January 1921 at his home, Sedbergh, Hillside, Wimbledon, Surrey. On 17 January a funeral service at St John's, Wimbledon, was followed by cremation at Woking crematorium; the remains were interred at Sedbergh School chapel.<br>
