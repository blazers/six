<span class="headword">Ferne, Sir  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1560&#150;1609), <span class="occ">administrator and writer on heraldry</span>, was the son of William Ferne (<i>d</i>. 1592) of Temple Belwood in the Isle of Axholme, Lincolnshire, and Anne, daughter of John Sheffield of Beltoft, Lincolnshire. Admitted to the Inner Temple in 1576/7, when he was probably in his late teens, Ferne devoted much of his time to the study of heraldry, and was commissioned to compose a history of the medieval de Lacy family based on that written by a foreign adventurer called Albertus &agrave; Lasco. His patron, who claimed to be a Polish nobleman and aimed to use this work to establish a distinguished pedigree for himself, vanished within a few months, but Ferne sought to gain some benefit from his labours by publishing his researches as <span class="italic">The Blazon of Gentrie</span> in 1586. This work refuted &agrave; Lasco's pretensions to any relationship with the Lacys, but made much of the ancestry of the earls of Lincoln, who were among the leading landowners in Ferne's own county. However, the more significant part of the treatise comprised a debate on the nature of gentility, couched as a dialogue between a herald, a knight, a clergyman, a lawyer, an antiquary, and a ploughman. Ferne proclaimed his volume to be &#145;for the sole instruction of the armigerous gentry&#146;, and insisted that Christ himself was eligible to have borne arms because of his mother's descent from Shem. However, he qualified this remarkable claim with the humanist observation that true gentility was acquired through education, service, and, most of all, by virtue, without which lineage was a mere shadow of nobility. These claims are most interesting in light of the fact that his own lineage was anything but ancient: his father had only acquired the family's Lincolnshire estates in the 1570s, and the pedigree Ferne registered with the heralds artfully concealed the fact that his grandfather had been a yeoman from Uttoxeter, Staffordshire.<br>
<br>Ferne was called to the bar of the Inner Temple in 1587, and in the following year his father, then mayor of Doncaster, secured John's appointment as recorder of the town. However, in 1592 Gilbert Talbot, seventh earl of Shrewsbury, coerced the town into displacing Ferne in favour of his own nominee, Edward Stanhope, and Ferne did not recover the post until after Stanhope's death in 1603. This was only a temporary reverse for Ferne, as in 1595, despite stiff competition, he succeeded his brother-in-law Ralph Rokeby as deputy secretary to the council in the north at York. One of a zealous coterie of officials who considered the north to be more at risk from recusancy than from puritanism, he devoted his energies to the persecution of the adherents of the exiled rebel Charles Neville, sixth earl of Westmorland, who constituted a focus for the Catholic networks in north-eastern England.<br>
<br>The accession of King James in 1603 brought an end to official approval for Ferne's pressure on Catholics, but the new reign also brought a new president of the council in the north in the shape of Edmund, third Lord Sheffield, who promoted Ferne and another northern lawyer, William Gee, to hold the secretaryship in tandem, a post that yielded them perhaps &pound;700 a year in fees. Sheffield's influence also found Ferne a parliamentary seat at Boroughbridge in 1604, and towards the end of the session of that year he was one of four council officials knighted by the king at Whitehall. He left little trace on the Commons' proceedings, and at the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot in November 1605 he was sent to York post-haste to co-ordinate the arrest of suspects; characteristically, he blamed the conspiracy on the abuse of the king's mercy and the negligence of the ecclesiastical establishment. Ferne's efforts in pursuit of the plotters were ignored by the government in the following year, when the courtier John Lepton obtained a grant of the fees that formed the mainstay of the secretaries' livelihood. Vigorous protests eventually forced Lepton to a compromise with the incumbents, but Ferne was allowed little time to savour his success, as he died on 20 June 1609, probably at York.<br>
<br>Ferne was survived by his wife, Elizabeth, whom he had married by 1583. She was the daughter of John Needham of Wymondley Priory, Hertfordshire; with her Ferne had ten sons and two daughters. The youngest of his sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9349/', "Henry Ferne")</script>, was briefly bishop of Chester after the Restoration. He should not be confused with a cousin, also Sir John Ferne, who was knighted in 1603 and was a partner of Sir Arthur Ingram in the controversial export of English ordnance to the continent.<br>
