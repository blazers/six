<span class="headword">Pickenham <span class="st"> [Beaufo]</span>,  Osbert</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1350), <span class="occ">prior of the Carmelite convent, London, and theologian</span>, presumably took his name from either North or South Pickenham, south-east of Swaffham, in Norfolk. Little is known about his life. John Bale, in his earliest notebooks, records that Pickenham entered the Carmelite order at either Burnham Norton or Bishop's Lynn, Norfolk, but later opted for the latter, and later historians have followed him. Pickenham's surname varies in early manuscripts, often occurring as Anglicus, but also as Beaufo or Berford. Hence he may be the Olerico Beaufo who, with another Carmelite, Geoffrey Alienand, was given permission on 11 February 1355 to hear confessions in the diocese of Lincoln. Pickenham and Alienand certainly appear to have been contemporaries at Oxford, since their <span class="italic">Introitus ad Bibliam</span> (theology lectures) appear together in some manuscripts. Opinions differ as to when Pickenham was at Oxford; earlier authors, following Bale, suggest 1320 or 1330, but more recently a date about 1358 has been proposed. However, the noted Carmelite theologian John Baconthorpe (<i>d</i>. 1346) was at Oxford in the early 1340s, and Pickenham seems to have attended his lectures, since he refers to Baconthorpe in his writings&#151;the only Carmelite cited. Similarly most of the doctors with whom Pickenham disputed&#151;men like Thomas Bradwardine (<i>d</i>. 1349), Thomas Buckingham (<i>d</i>. 1349), William Heytesbury (<i>d</i>. 1373), and John Trevaur&#151;incepted in the late 1340s. The single exception is Nicholas Aston, who incepted in 1358. Consequently if the identification with Olerico Beaufo is correct, then it can be assumed that Pickenham gained his doctorate about 1346&#150;50.<br>
<br>Bale and Leland claim that Pickenham incepted at Paris, but the mid-fourteenth-century writer Jean Trisse does not list him among the Carmelites in his list of early doctors there, and the theologians with whom he disputed were all from Oxford. However, references to Paris and Rome in his writings may indicate that he visited the continent in furtherance of his studies. The fact that, out of eight surviving fourteenth-century manuscripts containing his writings, four originated in Italy and two in France, lends support to this possibility. However, Pickenham's later years were spent in London, where he was prior and taught in the Carmelite <i>studium generale</i>. Leland saw his tomb there, with a French inscription, but neither he nor Bale knew when Pickenham died.<br>
<br>The surviving manuscripts contain twenty theological questions attributed to Pickenham, and Bartolomeo Xiberta concluded that the first eight consist of Pickenham's lectures on the <span class="italic">Sentences</span>, while the ninth is his <span class="italic">Introitus ad Bibliam</span>. Of the rest, one question is by Richard Kilvington (<i>d</i>. 1361), while a second <span class="italic">Introitus ad Bibliam</span> is by Pickenham's companion, Geoffrey Alienand. Xiberta judged that the rest were mostly by Pickenham's fellow theologians at Oxford, but Leonard Kennedy, who edited the eighteenth, argues from its style and citations that this, too, is by Pickenham. Bale attributes further titles to Pickenham, namely <span class="italic">Determinationes theologie</span> (in reality the eleven questions following his lectures on the <span class="italic">Sentences</span>) and <span class="italic">Super 4 libros sentenciarum</span> (which Bale saw in Rheims), both with incipit, and four others without incipit&#151;<span class="italic">De clara Dei visione</span>, <span class="italic">Postillas Bibliorum</span>, <span class="italic">Sermones varios</span>, and <span class="italic">Super Marie conceptione</span>; the last should be attributed to Osbert de Clare (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1160).<br>
<br>In his theology Pickenham focuses, like many writers of his period, on cognition, the beatific vision, and free will. He argues that acts of the intellect are distinct from the intellect itself but, as against Thomas Aquinas, he denies that there are intelligible species (in the sense of images or ideas) because physical objects cannot affect an incorporeal object. For Pickenham, God himself is the efficient cause of human understanding. His treatment of pain illustrates Pickenham's extreme Platonism&#151;he claims that a wound in the body is the occasion for pain, but does not cause it, for the physical cannot affect the intellectual soul. For Pickenham, it is God who acts on the soul. A provocative thinker, although not one always easily understood, Pickenham was entitled the &#145;venerable master&#146; by the late fourteenth-century Carmelite Michele Aiguani, and his questions were frequently cited by the succeeding generation of Carmelite theologians.<br>
