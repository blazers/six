<span class="headword">Minton,  Herbert</span>  (1793&#150;1858), <span class="occ">pottery manufacturer</span>, was born on 4 February 1793 in Stoke-on-Trent, the second son of ten children of <a name="cosubject_58823"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Minton</span>  (1765&#150;1836), <span class="occ">engraver and pottery manufacturer</span>, and Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Webb (1772&#150;1856). Thomas Minton was born at Wyle Cop, Shrewsbury, and on leaving school became an apprentice engraver at the Caughley Works, Broseley, Shropshire, where he worked on the engraving of the famous &#145;willow&#146; pattern, among others, under the supervision of Thomas Turner. He soon established himself as an engraver in London, and during that time married Sarah Webb; their first child was baptized in 1791. Afterwards they moved to Stoke, where in 1793 Thomas Minton founded the Minton pottery and porcelain factory in London Road. Early productions at Minton concentrated on underglaze blue-printed earthenware tableware, and about 1799 bone china was introduced.<br>
<br>Herbert Minton was educated at Audlem grammar school, Cheshire, and at eighteen became involved with the Minton business as its representative. In 1817 he and Thomas Webb Minton, his elder brother, were taken into partnership. Thomas Webb was designated the clerical work, while Herbert, who arrived at work at five in the morning, approved design trials, undertook daily stocktaking in the warehouse, ordered bodies and glazes, and checked the factory accounts.<br>
<br>During the 1830s Minton and the Gothic architect and designer Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin found that they shared an interest in inlaid clay medieval floor tiles, and had a strong desire to reproduce them. One of the problems that Minton had to overcome was the irregular contraction of clays that caused the inlaid pattern to become easily dislodged from the main body of the tile. Repeated failures seemed only to strengthen his resolve. Matthew Digby Wyatt, architect and designer, commented:<blockquote>He set to work with a thorough English determination to succeed, and with untiring energy and perseverance, notwithstanding repeated failures and many difficulties and obstacles which presented themselves in his successive experiments, at length succeeded in producing tiles very far superior to those of the ancients.(Minton archives, MS 31; <span class="italic">Journal of the Society of Arts</span>, 28 May 1858)</blockquote>The combination of Pugin's designs and Minton's technical skill led to important commissions that included the houses of parliament; St Georges Hall, Liverpool; and Cheadle church, Staffordshire. Other important and ambitious tile schemes executed by the Minton factory were for the Capitol, Washington, DC; the Foreign Office, London; the royal dairy, Windsor; and the South Kensington Museum, London (now the Victoria and Albert Museum).<br>
<br>Thomas Webb Minton had entered the church twelve years before his father's death in 1836, and though Herbert Minton had made a major contribution towards the success of the factory, Thomas Webb was named chief beneficiary of his father's estate; Herbert was awarded only the interest on &pound;3000 and a quarter of the profits. Thomas Kirkby, a Minton artist, recalled a devastated Herbert Minton saying &#145;If it had not have been for my mother and my sisters, I would have given up the potting business&#146;  (Minton archives, MS 115). Thomas Webb Minton, after family consultation, donated &pound;23,000 to enable the executors of Thomas Minton's will to fund a new partnership between Herbert Minton and John Boyle, a local potter, who both contributed capital themselves; however, on 21 November 1841 the partnership ended.<br>
<br>Herbert Minton married Anne, the third daughter of John Hollins of Shelton, near Stoke-on-Trent, on 1 September 1819, and after her death, in 1841, he married Mary Brown. Isabella Stewart Fraser, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Leckie, became his third wife, following the death of Mary. Minton had no children, and in 1845 he was joined by two partners in the factory: Michael Daintry Hollins, his first wife's nephew, and Colin Minton Campbell, his own nephew.<br>
<br>By the 1840s the Minton factory was producing a range of figures, ornamental ware, and encaustic floor tiles. During the mid- to late 1840s Herbert Minton developed Parian body (named after the Greek island of Paros) for statuary, and low-temperature lead glazes that Minton named majolica. Both majolica and Parian were launched at the Great Exhibition of 1851 and contributed greatly to Minton's being awarded the bronze council medal&#151;a most prestigious accolade&#151;for &#145;beauty and originality of design&#146;, the only one of its kind bestowed on an English manufacturer.<br>
<br>The development of Parian led to Minton securing the services of the finest sculptors in England, France, and Italy, whose works created a new awareness among the workforce and the general public of classical and contemporary sculpture. The popularity of majolica, the most characteristic Victorian art form, with its vigorous modelling and vibrant glazes, remained constant until the 1880s, when there was a change in public taste and less demand for flamboyant ceramic pieces; however, its reputation is retained to this day as the most decorative pottery ever produced.<br>
<br>Herbert Minton was chosen as Queen Victoria's personal escort at the Great Exhibition, and she wrote in her journal on 30 April 1851: &#145;we walked the whole round of the galleries. We saw beautiful china from Minton's factory and beautiful designs&#146;  (Gibbs-Smith, 16). On 22 May she made a return visit to the Minton stand and recorded: &#145;this is upon the whole the finest, everything for the table, bedroom sets, flower vases, all in the best taste&#146;  (ibid., 20). A reviewer in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Society of Arts</span> (9 August 1858) commented:<blockquote>The verdicts of two international juries had assigned to Mr. Minton an European fame and the chief place among manufacturers of pottery since the first Wedgwood, no one has done so much to advance his art as Mr. Minton. Both at the London and Paris Exhibitions his works proved that individual enterprise was more than a match for state subsidies. (Minton archives, MS 26)</blockquote>In 1856 Herbert Minton, Michael Daintry Hollins, and Colin Minton Campbell were granted the royal warrant &#145;to be manufacturers of china, earthenware, encaustic and plain tiles and tesserae at Stoke-upon-Trent in ordinary to Her Majesty&#146;.<br>
<br>Herbert Minton was well known for his philanthropic qualities. He lived for many years at Longfield Cottage, Hartshill, near Stoke, where in 1842 he built and endowed a church (one of Sir Gilbert Scott's early works) and schools for 1500 children, with houses for teachers, providing for their maintenance and for the education of the children. He built almshouses for the aged and infirm, and infirmaries for the sick. He donated &pound;500 towards the erection of public baths; a future project was to build by public subscription a school of art and literature next to the public baths.<br>
<br>On 1 April 1858 Herbert Minton died at his retirement residence, Belmont, Middle Woodfield Road, Torquay. He had been a magistrate, a lieutenant of Stafford, a member of the Society of Antiquaries, and a knight of the imperial order of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. He was buried at Trinity Church, Hartshill. As a tribute to his memory the school of art in London Road, Stoke-on-Trent, was erected by public subscription, and at Torquay it was proposed to add a spire to St Mark's Church.<br>
<br>Probate records that Herbert Minton left under &pound;70,000. On 22 March 1857 he wrote to his brother-in-law John Campbell stating that he had made his will and would show it to him soon. In that letter he encouraged Campbell to purchase 6&frac12; acres of land that was on the market from Mr Spode (who owned a ceramic manufactory in close proximity). Minton wanted to buy the land himself, but in addition to the substantial bequests set out in his will he had gifted the church and the school, and made alterations to his house that cost &pound;3000, and consequently could not afford to buy the land. He also mentioned that he had taken out life insurance for &pound;7000. Colin Minton Campbell, Minton's nephew, inherited the factory after his uncle's death, and it was Minton's wish that the land purchased from Spode would be available for Colin's use.<br>
<br>At a discussion of the Society of Arts the interior decorator J. G. Crace (formerly A. W. N. Pugin's assistant) said of Minton:<blockquote>in fact, taking his productions altogether we had reason as Englishmen to be proud of our dearly departed friend. He had not only earned a reputation which would probably live as long as this country remained; but he had greatly aided in gaining for England the respectable position she had now attained in the arts.(Minton archives, MS 31; <span class="italic">Journal of the Society of Arts</span>, 28 May 1858)</blockquote>
