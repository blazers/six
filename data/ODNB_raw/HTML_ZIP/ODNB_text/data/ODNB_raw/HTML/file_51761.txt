<span class="headword">Franklin,  Mary</span>  (1800&#150;1867), <span class="occ">schoolmistress</span>, was born, probably in Coventry, on 5 August 1800, the eldest child and first daughter of Francis Franklin (1772&#150;1852), Baptist minister, and his wife, Rebecca, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dyer. Her father had been pastor of the Cow Lane Chapel, Coventry, since 1799, with a stipend of &pound;40 p.a. on which he and his wife worked hard to bring up ten children, three of whom died in infancy. Like so many of her female contemporaries in similar situations, Mary looked to school-keeping for her own support. After attendance then work as an assistant at a school in Bocking in Essex, she began to take pupils in her parents' parlour, at first little boys, including the young Charles Bray, the future ribbon manufacturer, as well as little girls. Soon she combined forces with her sister <a href="#cosubject_51762">Rebecca [<i>see below</i>]</a> and they rented a house in Hertford Street, Coventry, allowing them to take older girls as boarders, as well as day girls.<br>
<br>The enterprise flourished and they moved several times more within Coventry, to a house called Nant Glyn in Warwick Row, then to Hertford House, and finally to Little Park Street. Mary supplied the motherly warmth and the organizing ability, Rebecca the cultivated style and dramatic presence. Pupils came from as far away as India and the USA, but also from London and the surrounding countryside. These included Mary Anne Evans, the future novelist George Eliot, who boarded with them from 1832 to 1835.<br>
<br>The curriculum was the conventional female one: English, arithmetic, history, and drawing, with French, German, and music as extras. The last three were taught by visiting masters of a high standard, and all the teaching was marked by an exemplary rigour. Mary's niece, Rebecca Franklin Hine, recalled that her aunts'<blockquote>system of training was undoubtedly that of the strictly rigid, somewhat despotic regime&#151;repression of evil rather than eliciting the good. &hellip; Their teaching on all subjects was the very reverse of the present style of veneer&#151;thorough to the lowest foundations, from Holy Scripture to the correct Parisian accent (Supplement, <span class="italic">Coventry Herald</span>, 5)</blockquote>although she confirmed that Aunt Mary's mathematics stopped short of algebra and geometry.<br>
<br>Both Mary and Rebecca were committed supporters of their father's chapel, to which their pupils were taken on Sundays. The physical description of the character Rufus Lyon and his surroundings in George Eliot's novel <span class="italic">Felix Holt</span> is acknowledged to be a vivid picture of the Revd Francis Franklin and the courtyard of the Cow Lane Chapel. The Franklins were General rather than Particular Baptists. The essential Calvinism of their creed was buttressed by extensive good works and the support of the Baptist Missionary Society, of which Mrs Franklin's brother, John Dyer, was secretary, and for which another sister, and a brother who died in training, set out to work. Such charitable work provided a pattern and some occupation for George Eliot in the first years after she left school. The sisters retired to live at 13 White Street, Coventry, where Mary Franklin died on 4 December 1867 of dropsy following bronchitis.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_51762"></a><span class="headword">Rebecca Franklin</span>  (1803&#150;1873), <span class="occ">schoolmistress</span>, was born in Coventry on 30 November 1803, the third daughter of Francis and Rebecca Franklin. With her cousin Eliza Dyer she attended a school in Paris for a year and on her return began to take pupils in one of the Sunday school rooms at Cow Lane. Soon she combined forces with Mary and they moved to Hertford Street. Rebecca considered all things literary and the deportment and cultivation appropriate to ladies her especial provinces. The girls were encouraged to read widely among the English poets and were not forbidden novels. She laid stress on speaking in harmonious tones and in finished, even studied, sentences. Indeed, her niece recalled that a &#145;sort of intangible, diffusive, and yet exquisite elaboration of diction clothed all her ideas, clothed them in fact in such multiform circumlocution, and yet precision of detail, as made it a perfect puzzle to catch her real meaning&#146;  (Supplement, <span class="italic">Coventry Herald</span>, 5). Rebecca encouraged George Eliot to eliminate her midland accent, to pitch her voice low and evenly, and to strive always to speak in well-formed sentences.<br>
<br>The affection between teacher and pupil was real and enduring: contact was maintained after George Eliot left school and she condoled with Rebecca on her periodic bouts of ill health. Rebecca in turn was deeply distressed by George Eliot's loss of faith. She endeavoured to find a minister of appropriate stature and learning to debate with her; in 1842 she joined those pleading with Robert Evans to behave more humanely in face of his daughter's intellectual and emotional turmoil. Sadly Rebecca Franklin's mind gave way in her last years and she died on 29 May 1873 at 13 White Street, Coventry.<br>
