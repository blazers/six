<span class="headword">North,  Thomas</span>  (1810/11&#150;1868), <span class="occ">coal owner</span>, was born probably at the Toll House, London Road, Nottingham. He was the son and heir of Thomas North (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1833), a toll-gate keeper and mining contractor, but little else is known about his early life. He married twice; following the death of his first wife, Hannah Laycock (1811/12&#150;1865), North married Catherine Sarah Stanley (<i>d</i>. 1920); they had a son, also called Thomas, born in 1867. In the 1820s the population of Nottingham was growing under the impetus of a fast-expanding demand for the machine-wrought lace in which the town specialized. North's father embarked on brick making at Mapperley, near Nottingham, and the production of coal from small mines at Babbington village, near Ilkeston. He is known to have borrowed &pound;800 from Thomas Nunn, a chemist, in 1826; but apart from this the source of his capital can only be guessed at.<br>
<br>Between 1832 and 1841 (when he moved to The Park, Nottingham) North lived at Babbington Cottage, and was in overall control of the mining enterprise in that village. These mines were run by sub-contractors called &#145;butties&#146;, who hired the labour and provided the working capital. Mining methods and equipment were primitive and working conditions harsh. In 1835 North was joined by Thomas Wakefield (1791&#150;1871), a member of a prosperous family engaged in textiles, who injected substantial capital funds into the partnership. In 1839 James Morley of Sneinton (third son of Richard Morley, a partner in the textile firm of I. and R. Morley) also joined the partnership; he contributed capital and worked full time without salary. About this time North and Wakefield were taking out mining leases over a wide area to the north of Nottingham, and were busily engaged in widening and deepening old shafts and sinking new ones. Between 1835 and 1844 they also constructed 18 miles of private railway, linking all their mines with canals, landsale wharves, and, subsequently, main-line railways, which gave them access to a substantial market at minimal cost. In July 1845 a fourth partner, Samuel Parsons, was admitted by agreeing to pay &pound;18,000, in instalments, for a one-fifth share of the firm.<br>
<br>North and his partners then embarked on a new and risky venture. Up to this point all coalmines in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire had been sunk into the exposed coalfield, where the seams outcropped onto the surface. The new Cinderhill colliery (about 3 miles north of Nottingham) was to work coal in the east of the coalfield, where the seams were concealed below magnesian limestone. The general belief was that either there was no coal beneath the limestone or, if there was, it was of no value. However, relying on the advice of his mining engineer, J. T. Woodhouse of Moira, North sank two shafts into the top hard seam in 1841&#150;3; production commenced using the most up-to-date methods and equipment&#151;the true longwall system, a powerful winding engine, iron wire ropes, shaft cages held rigid in the shafts by guide rails, mechanical haulage underground, efficient furnace ventilation, and pumping equipment. Also the shafts were lined with wrought iron &#145;tubbing&#146; to keep them dry. All these were new to the district. Unfortunately a major fault to the east of the shafts brought production almost to a halt in March 1845, and pessimists were certain that this marked the limit of the coalfield. But North decided to drive a stone heading through the fault, and though by the middle of September 1847 he was in dire financial straits and had almost given up, coal was once more reached and production recommenced. Unfortunately the chief capital provider, Wakefield, had been bankrupted, losing his own money, that of his late father's estate, and funds entrusted to him by various charitable institutions. To add to North's difficulties, Morley felt cheated also, and consequently the partnership came to an end; North carried on as sole proprietor with the backing of Wright's Bank. For his share in the enterprise, Wakefield received from North only &pound;2000, a mere fraction of the amount he had invested.<br>
<br>Thomas Wakefield had been leader of the whig Liberal group that dominated the Nottingham borough council. It was owing to his influence that North became a councillor in 1837 and mayor in 1844&#150;5. In 1859 North was elected alderman, a position he held until his death in 1868. However, unlike Wakefield, he played no active part in politics and rarely spoke in council. Although coming from a Baptist background, North became an Anglican and was for some years a churchwarden at Basford parish church, Nottinghamshire. At a cost of &pound;2000 in 1856 he provided a daughter church at Cinderhill, close to Basford Hall, the substantial mansion he leased in 1851 and in which he resided until his death. He also provided a Baptist mission hall at Cinderhill and a General Baptist chapel in Babbington village, along with houses for his workers.<br>
<br>North sank several new collieries similar to Cinderhill in the 1850s and 1860s. He also owned Nottinghamshire's largest brickworks, adjacent to his Cinderhill mine. He built a gasworks which supplied gas lighting to his mines as well as to chapels and workmen's houses. Without doubt he over-extended himself financially, and he and his agent spent much time and energy fending off creditors. When he died he owed Wright's Bank over &pound;190,000. Ironically, the period 1871&#150;4 was one of high prosperity in the coal trade, and had North lived his debts would have been cleared and his massive investment would have shown a handsome return.<br>
<br>North's pioneering venture at Cinderhill induced others to invest in large, well-equipped collieries to exploit the concealed coalfield in Nottinghamshire, which became the most profitable coalmining district in Britain. Despite his flawed character, North's enterprise and vision brought prosperity to what had been a poverty-stricken agricultural and framework-knitting district. He died at Basford Hall, Nottinghamshire, on 28 January 1868, from haematuria and congestion of the lungs, and was buried at Old Basford cemetery. He was survived by his second wife, and left an estate valued at under &pound;120,000.<br>
