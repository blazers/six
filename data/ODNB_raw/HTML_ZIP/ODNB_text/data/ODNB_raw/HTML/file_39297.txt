<span class="headword">Cunedda</span>  (<em>supp. </em><em>fl. </em>late 4th&#150;mid-5th cent.), <span class="occ">ruler in north Wales</span>, is said to have led the migration of a section of his north British people from Manau in Gododdin, the area around the headwaters of the Forth still commemorated in Clackmannan, to north Wales, where he expelled the Irish settlers and founded the dynasty that ruled Gwynedd until the early ninth century. The purported date of these events was either the end of the fourth century or the middle of the fifth. Such is the story told by the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span> (sometimes ascribed to Nennius), which was written, probably in north Wales, in 829 or 830. The corpus of British genealogies (the Harleian) assembled in the mid-tenth century, makes Cunedda son of &#338;tern (possibly Eternus), grandson of Padarn Pesrut (Peternus of the Red Cloak), and great-grandson of Tegid (Tacitus). He is himself father of eight (or nine) sons, each the eponym of a subdivision of the early medieval kingdom of Gwynedd (for example, Meirion for Meirionydd, Rhufon for Rhufoniog, and so on), and is therefore progenitor not only of the main dynasty of Gwynedd, but also of the lines of sub-kings ruling its constituent elements.<br>
<br>This sparse information is almost certainly an aetiological myth, which had three principal functions. First, it provided a model for the intervention of a new and alien dynasty at a time when the house of Cunedda had made way for that of Merfyn. It also linked Gwynedd with the north British area where a &#145;heroic age&#146; had played itself out in the sixth century, to the accompaniment of formative poetry ascribed to the bards Aneirin and Taliesin: their renown is recorded in the immediately preceding sentence of the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span>.<br>
<br>Finally, it firmly cemented into the history of the main kingdom those parts which might otherwise have been aspiring to separate destinies. Thus it can be suggested that Ceredig became Cunedda's ninth &#145;son&#146; when Ceredigion was incorporated into Gwynedd in 872. Cunedda's Roman-sounding ancestors are of the type often used to lend grandeur to the remoter reaches of Welsh genealogies: the most popular choices are Constantine himself and Magnus Maximus, both of whom began their bids for power at the head of the army in Britain. The dating of Cunedda's life given by the <span class="italic">Historia</span> or implied by the genealogies is correspondingly artificial. The <span class="italic">Historia's</span> &#145;146 years before Maelgwn, <i>magnus rex apud Brittones</i>&#146; (&#145;great king of the Britons&#146;) (534?&#150;547?) means 388, in other words the death of Magnus Maximus, one of early medieval British tradition's few &#145;historical horizons&#146;; adjustment in the genealogies to make Cunedda not Maelgwn's <i>atavus</i> (great-great-great-grandfather), as in the <span class="italic">Historia</span>, but merely <i>proavus</i> (great-grandfather) serves to transfer his activity to the period when, on the evidence of Gildas and Bede, the Britons' struggle with the &#145;Picts and Scots&#146; was at its height.<br>
<br>These observations show that Cunedda is essentially a figure of the ninth and tenth centuries. His historical role was to legitimize a particular perception of the past and present in the Gwynedd of that period. Whether he had a historical existence in his own right is impossible to say, but is perhaps rather more likely than not. If so, he should surely be envisaged as the leader of a warband from the very fringes of the British world, who contrived to make an effective intervention far from his home base, in much the same way as warriors from Gwynedd are celebrated by Aneirin among the participants in the battle fought by the Gododdin themselves against the Northumbrians at Catterick. That his presence in Gwynedd was part of a master-plan by the authorities in sub-Roman Britain to regain control of the situation is no more (or less) than agreeable fantasy.<br>
