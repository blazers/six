<span class="headword">Tritton,  Joseph Herbert</span>  (1844&#150;1923), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 5 September 1844 at Olney Lodge, Battersea, Surrey, the eldest son of Joseph Tritton (1819&#150;1887), a Quaker banker, and his wife, Amelia, daughter of Joseph Hanson of Brixton. He was educated at Rugby School (<i>c</i>.1855&#150;1862). On 17 June 1867, he married Lucy Jane, the daughter of Henry Abel Smith (1826&#150;1890) of Wilford, Nottingham, a member of a banking family with interests in Lincoln and Nottingham. They had five sons and four daughters. The family house was at Lyons Hall, Great Leighs, Chelmsford, the Essex property inherited by his father and passed on to him.<br>
<br>After leaving Rugby, Tritton joined the bank of Barclay, Bevan, Tritton, Twells &amp; Co. in 1867, and became a junior partner. He was following family tradition, as members of the Tritton family had held partnerships in the firm since 1783, when John Hinton Tritton (his great-grandfather) entered the bank. Through various changes of partnership and the takeover of Ransome, Bouverie &amp; Co. of Pall Mall in 1888 and the Brighton Union Bank in 1894 the name Tritton remained in the title. The bank's name was distinctive and, in the years between 1888 and 1896, Barclay, Bevan, and Tritton, Ransome, Bouverie &amp; Co. was popularly known as &#145;the long firm&#146;  (<span class="italic">DBB</span>, 558).<br>
<br>The business still operated as a private bank, as a member of the London Clearing House and as clearing bank for a number of country partnerships, many of which had family and Quaker connections with the partners in Barclay, Bevan, Tritton &amp; Co. During the period when Tritton became a full partner it was becoming clear that the days of the private banks were numbered, and that to protect their relationship with the country banks and prevent their absorption into the rapidly growing joint-stock companies it was necessary to form a limited company. The partners in Barclay, Bevan, Tritton &amp; Co. were the key figures in the foundation of Barclay &amp; Co. in 1896. They nevertheless hoped to continue the private character of their existing institutions by restricting shareholdings to the partners of the twenty amalgamating firms (mostly Quaker). The character of the private banker is well illustrated by Tritton's pithy comment that there were &#145;three cardinal virtues in the banker's character&#151;Incredulity, Affability and the Power to say No&#146;  (&#145;President's address to the Institute of Bankers&#146;, 1885).<br>
<br>Tritton became a member of the first board of directors, as well as a local director in the Lombard Street local head office. He remained on the board until his retirement in 1918, and one of his sons followed him into the bank in 1914. Tritton was a progressive banker, and enthusiastic about the establishment of a professional forum for the training of young bankers and the discussion of professional issues. He was a founder member of the Institute of Bankers, serving on the council from the beginning, and served as the institute's third president (1885&#150;1887), after Sir John Lubbock and Richard Biddulph Martin. He also served a second term of office in 1902&#150;4. As president he started the practice of reviewing the previous year in his presidential address. One of the main reasons for establishing the institute was to improve the education of clerks and, in discussions over the type of syllabus to be offered, Tritton supported the Billinghurst scheme, which advocated a practical syllabus for training bankers. In 1902, when he sat on a committee to review the syllabus, he recommended the introduction of commercial history and geography. As chairman in 1886 he announced that his bank would follow the lead of the London and County Bank in offering a gratuity to successful candidates in the institute's exams.<br>
<br>Tritton was active in most of the pressure groups representing bankers in the City. In the institute and other forums he contributed papers and took part in discussions on a variety of practical topics like bills of exchange and the London money market. He was a founder member and treasurer of the Central Association of Bankers formed in 1895 by representatives of the committee of the London Clearing House, the West End banks and the Association of English Country Bankers to &#145;speak in the name of all the Banks in the Country&#146;  (Green, 72). In addition he was a member of the Council of Foreign Bondholders, honorary secretary of the Committee of London Clearing Bankers (1891&#150;1905), and a founder member of the London chamber of commerce, of which he became president.<br>
<br>Tritton was a &#145;sound money&#146; man and took a prominent position in the defence of the gold standard in the controversy over the remonetization of silver and the establishment of a connected rate for the two metals. Like most City men, Tritton feared it would lead to inflation and undermine Britain's position as a financial centre in the world. He was a chairman of the Gold Standard Defence Association established in 1895, and in the same year gave an address to the London Institution entitled &#145;The assault on the gold standard&#146;. The assault came from the Bimetallic League, which saw the remonetization of silver as a way of easing trade with the rest of the world and thereby increasing employment at home.<br>
<br>Consistent with his stand on the gold standard and free trade, Tritton argued for free trade saying that &#145;as a business man, in the centre of the business of the world, and with his hand on the pulse of the trade of the world he looked with dread upon even a suggestion to close our ports whether he considered the home trade or the international trade which brought an enormous profit to this country&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 Jan 1904).<br>
<br>Tritton was a lieutenant for the City of London, chairman of the Indo-European Telegraph Company, and a member of the Company of Shipwrights and of the fellowship of the Russia Company. In his private life he was keenly interested in genealogy and produced a history of his family called <span class="italic">Tritton: the Place and the Family</span> in 1907. Like his father, he wrote religious poetry and was involved in charity work, particularly for the Young Men's Christian Association. He received the Persian order of the Lion and the Sun.<br>
<br>In 1918 Tritton retired from the board of Barclays. A fall from his horse restricted his activities in his later years, and he died at his home, Lyons Hall, Great Leighs, Essex on 11 September 1923. He was described in an obituary as &#145;a link with a generation of business men which has now all but disappeared, and of a time when manners were more stately and life more leisurely&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Institute of Bankers</span>, 1923).<br>
