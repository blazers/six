<span class="headword">Balnaves,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1570), <span class="occ">diplomat and religious reformer</span>, is said by Calderwood to have come from Kirkcaldy and studied in Cologne. He returned to St Andrews, appearing on the rolls of St Salvator's College in 1527 as <i>magister</i>, the title by which he is usually designated, though where he received his MA degree is uncertain. He worked as a procurator in St Andrews for several years subsequently, his clients including David Beaton, then abbot of Arbroath. By 1537 he was an advocate in the court of session in Edinburgh, and on 29 July 1538 he was promoted as a lord of session. In the following year he bought Halhill, in Fife, with his wife, Christine Scheves. By 1539 Balnaves's friendship with John Melville of Raith had helped him to secure the position of clerk to the treasurer, Sir James Kirkcaldy of Grange. In January 1540 he first acted as a diplomat, going to Coldstream where he and Thomas Bellenden met with Sir William Evers to arrange mutual extraditions. At this meeting Bellenden raised the possibility that James V might follow Henry VIII's lead in ecclesiastical affairs; given Balnaves's reformist associations, he probably approved.<br>
<br>As treasurer's clerk, Balnaves was a regular attender at parliament in the late 1530s and early 1540s. After James's death in 1542, Balnaves and Kirkcaldy supported the second earl of Arran in his bid to become governor, &#145;as he apperit to be a trew gospeller&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of His Own Life</span>, 71); Arran in turn appointed Balnaves as secretary on 28 February 1543. In the following month Balnaves was among those who argued in parliament in favour of the act which allowed <span class="roman">Bible</span> reading in the vernacular, and shortly afterwards he went to England to negotiate a marriage treaty between the infant Mary, queen of Scots, and the future Edward VI. By November, however, Arran's English policy having changed, Balnaves had been removed from office and imprisoned in Blackness Castle, where he remained until the following spring. Cardinal Beaton, who instigated this purge, targeted his former advocate along with the fourth earl of Rothes and Patrick, Lord Gray, as &#145;he loved him worst of all&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 18/2, no. 425). However, Balnaves was back in parliament by November 1544, and sitting in court by June 1545.<br>
<br>Whether or not Balnaves was aware of Henry VIII's plots against Beaton, he was not implicated when the cardinal was assassinated on 29 May 1546; in fact he continues to appear on privy council sederunts until 3 August, and was present when the murder was declared treasonous and a summons issued for the conspirators. By the middle of August, however, he was no longer appearing at council; during the autumn he entered St Andrews Castle, where the assassins were holding out, and in November he and Norman Lesley boarded an English ship under heavy fire. After arriving in London, Balnaves and Lesley were awarded &pound;100 and they briefed the English privy council. Balnaves offered to gain &#145;assurances&#146; of support for English intervention from many Scottish nobles, and obtained promises of financial support for the castilians and a pension for himself. By 9 March 1547 he had returned to Scotland and he began compiling a list of assurances for Edward VI which was thought to contain 200 signatures. Having made another secret trip to England in April, Balnaves and others encouraged John Knox to preach, probably in May. At the end of July the castle fell to the French, and Balnaves, who had assisted in burning churches in St Andrews, was taken prisoner with the rest of the castilians.<br>
<br>Balnaves was imprisoned in the castle of Rouen, where, &#145;becaus he was judged learned &hellip; learned men war appointed to trawall with him&#146;, evidently concerning religious issues  (<span class="italic">Works of John Knox</span>, 1.226). Perhaps in conjunction with these debates, Balnaves wrote a treatise in prison on justification by faith, <span class="italic">The Confession of Faith, Conteining how the Troubled Man should Seeke Refuge at his God</span>. This treatise displays Balnaves's theological understanding and biblical knowledge; it is a thorough exposition of the doctrine of justification by faith alone, and is based on a sweeping array of scriptural material. Balnaves was strongly influenced by Luther, and was clearly familiar with Luther's commentary on <span class="roman">Galatians</span>. He discusses vocation, in the sense of the call made to each Christian to lead a godly life, in Lutheran terms, and consequently follows the German reformer in conceding authority to the prince to restore true religion where it has become corrupted. Balnaves sent his treatise to Knox, who annotated it, added a pr&eacute;cis, and sent it to Scotland; it was lost there, temporarily, and not published until 1584.<br>
<br>While in prison Balnaves was forfeited, but he was released by the early 1550s and remained in France until 1556, when Mary of Guise reversed his forfeiture. Back in Scotland, by 1559 Balnaves was again involved in secret diplomacy, between the Scottish reformist lords of the congregation and the English agents Ralph Sadler and James Croft at Berwick. Balnaves's primary goal was English funding for the lords, and in this he generally succeeded; he was also a signatory to the Anglo-Scottish treaty of Berwick on 27 February 1560. Following the establishment of the reformed kirk by parliament, Balnaves eventually returned to his old occupation, being readmitted to the bench in 1563. Later that year he was chosen by the general assembly to help revise the first <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span>, a project which came to nothing.<br>
<br>Balnaves's final diplomatic commission came in autumn 1568, when he acted as an assistant to Regent Moray in the latter's bringing charges against Mary, queen of Scots, at conferences at York and Westminster. Balnaves was a regular attender at council in 1568 and 1569, and during this time he helped James Melville, his eventual heir, to meet the regent. Balnaves died in Leith in February 1570, leaving chattels valued at &pound;333 11<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i> Scots. He bequeathed most of his estate to Melville, but a few items to another long-term associate, Alexander Clerk. Respected for his learning and diplomatic skills, Balnaves occupied an important role in the promotion of the reformed kirk, both in securing English support and in advising the protestant nobles. Moreover, in his treatise he shows a grasp of basic protestant theology remarkable in a layman.<br>
