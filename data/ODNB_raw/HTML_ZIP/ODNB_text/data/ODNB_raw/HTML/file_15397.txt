<span class="headword">Kennedy,  William Denholm</span>  (1813&#150;1865), <span class="occ">historical genre and landscape painter</span>, was born at Dumfries on 16 June 1813; he received his early education at Edinburgh. At seventeen he moved to London where he entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1833. His lifelong friendship with the artist William Etty began at this time, the older artist influencing both Kennedy's style and his subject matter. The two artists even collaborated on paintings, for example, <span class="italic">A Nymph Reposing</span> and <span class="italic">A Bather</span> (ex Christies, 1865).<br>
<br>In 1833 Kennedy sent his first pictures to the Royal Academy, <span class="italic">A Musical Party</span> and <span class="italic">The Toilet</span>, and he continued to exhibit there almost every year until his death. In 1835 he won the academy's gold medal for a historical painting with his <span class="italic">Apollo and Idas</span>. In 1840 he was awarded a travel allowance from the academy and journeyed to Italy, where he spent two years studying in Rome. He returned with many sketches and studies of Italian scenery. Six landscape watercolours in the British Museum relate to his Italian travels: these vibrant, lightly washed paintings are full of light and were deftly painted <i>en plein air</i>, for example, <span class="italic">Castel Gandolfo</span> and <span class="italic">Rainy Day at Baiae, Bay of Naples</span>. However, it does not seem that Kennedy worked up these watercolours into full studies at a later date.<br>
<br>Kennedy continued to paint Italian genre scenes and literary subjects, including scenes from Byron, Spenser, and Tasso, after he returned from Italy. Pictures such as <span class="italic">The Bandit Mother</span> (1845), <span class="italic">The Italian Goatherd</span> (1847), and <span class="italic">The Land of Poetry and Song</span> (1865) demonstrate the continued impact of his time there. He also made stained glass designs for Thomas Willemont, including those for the windows in St Stephen Walbrook, London, and was a good judge of etchings and engravings. He collected etchings by his contemporaries Sir Edwin Landseer, Sir David Wilkie, and Richard Parkes Bonington, as well as those after the old masters such as Paolo Veronese, Titian, Rubens, and Van Dyck.<br>
<br>Kennedy died of heart disease and dropsy at his home, 26 Soho Square, London, on 2 June 1865. He was a competent but not popular artist of the nineteenth century and consequently, despite exhibiting throughout his life at the British Institution and the Royal Academy, many of his works remained in his studio and were sold after his death by Christies. The sale also included forty-nine etchings by Rembrandt&#151;very fine impressions of <span class="italic">Christ Preaching</span> (called <span class="italic">The Little La Tombe</span>) and the <span class="italic">Agony in the Garden</span>.<br>
