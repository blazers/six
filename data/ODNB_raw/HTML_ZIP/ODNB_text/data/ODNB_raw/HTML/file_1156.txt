<span class="headword">Baldock, Sir  Robert</span>  (1624/5&#150;1691), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Stanway, Essex, the son and heir of Samuel Baldock (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1599), rector of Stanway. He was admitted a sizar of Pembroke College, Cambridge, on 29 October 1640, aged fifteen. Baldock entered Gray's Inn in July 1644, was called to the bar on 11 February 1651, and earned the degree of ancient on 18 May 1667. A decade later he gave the last of more than 400 recorded readings at Gray's Inn. Initiated over 250 years earlier, these readings had been held regularly until 1642 and quickly died out afterwards. Readers were selected from among the company to interpret cycles of statute law for the instruction of the students. The readings encompassed ten to twelve days spaced over three to four weeks  (Baker, 31&#150;7). In the same year (1677) he took the degree of serjeant.<br>
<br>Baldock married Mary, daughter of Bacqueville Bacon, coheir of her brother Henry, and the couple settled at Great Hocham in Norfolk. Mary died in 1662 and Baldock later remarried; however, the name of his second spouse is not recorded. He and Mary had two children: Robert, who died in a naval battle in 1673, and Mary, his surviving heir, who married George, son of Thomas Townshend of West Wretham, Norfolk, in 1675.<br>
<br>Early references to Baldock's legal career beyond Gray's Inn are scattered. He served as a justice of the peace for Norfolk after the Restoration. Robert Doughty reported in July 1664, &#145;I was at Norwich general quarter sessions, where Mr Bacon had the cushion, as Mr Long had before him &amp; Mr Corey &amp; Mr Baldock were to have after him&#146;  (Rosenheim, 38). In the only case in which he is specifically mentioned, Baldock ordered a verdict of not guilty returned in a dispute over the theft of 50<i>s</i>. In 1671, while recorder at Great Yarmouth, Baldock was knighted by Charles II during the latter's visit there. Two other references concerning his legal duties are extant for the period before Baldock became a serjeant in 1685. In the first, Edward L'Estrange was ordered to meet with him &#145;or in his absence, with Mr Norris about the validity of unexecuted warrants issued during the last Lieutenancy&#146;  (Cozens-Hardy, 40). Baldock was not available and Norris held that the warrants were still valid. Roger North, describing the fraudulent conveyance in a case involving Sir William Doyly, observed that Baldock possessed the &#145;wit and will&#146; to prepare one  (North, 2.124). Contemporary views of his legal abilities seem somewhat mixed; nevertheless, he became a serjeant under James II.<br>
<br>In this capacity Baldock gained notoriety in June 1688, when he served as one of the prosecutors in the trial of the seven bishops. The case centred on the refusal of William Sancroft, archbishop of Canterbury, and six others to read the king's declaration of indulgence. When the bishops met with James and presented their petition of protest, they were arrested and charged with seditious libel. During the ensuing trial, in June 1688, Baldock followed the opening arguments of Sir Thomas Powis for the crown and Lord Somers for the bishops with a &#145;feeble speech: admitting the right of the subject to petition the King, but objecting to the manner in which the Bishops had petitioned&#146;  (Phillipps, 2.316). His statement adds to the conclusion that none of the prosecutors &#145;made any significant contribution&#146; to the case  (Landon, 210). After a lengthy debate regarding the right of the bishops to petition, Baldock concluded, &#145;I cannot deny, nor shall not, but that the subject has a right to petition; but I shall affirm it also, he has a duty to obey&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 12.417). Throughout the proceedings, though he did not speak frequently and played a distinctly subordinate role to the principal prosecutors, William Williams and Powis, Baldock consistently defended the royal prerogative to suspend and dispense with laws enacted by parliament. After the bishops were acquitted, an angry King James dismissed two of the justices who heard the case, replacing one with Sir Robert Baldock.<br>
<br>The appointment to the king's bench on 6 July 1688 marks the high point of Baldock's legal career; yet it also illustrates the lack of outstanding legal talent willing to serve the monarch: the consequence of long-term efforts to politicize the bench. Under Charles and James generally undistinguished justices served the state and their tenure grew less secure. Sir Robert Baldock had little opportunity to justify the king's confidence or prove his own ability, as James fled to exile by the year's end and William never seriously considered him for a judicial appointment in the new administration. Baldock retired to Great Hocham and died there on 4 October 1691. He was buried in Great Hocham, where there is a monument to him in the local church.<br>
