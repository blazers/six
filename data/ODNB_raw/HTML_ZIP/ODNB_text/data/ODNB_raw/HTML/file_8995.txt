<span class="headword">Evelyn,  John</span>  (1655&#150;1699), <span class="occ">translator and government official</span>, was born on 14 January 1655, at Sayes Court, Deptford, Kent, the third but eldest surviving son of the diarist, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8996/', "John Evelyn (1620&#150;1706)")</script> and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53216/', "Mary Evelyn (c.1635&#150;1709)")</script>, daughter of Sir Richard Browne, of Sayes Court. In his early years Evelyn was brought up at Arundel House among the children of Henry Howard, later sixth duke of Norfolk. However in 1662 Evelyn's father put an end to the association with the Howard children, &#145;for fear of their perverting him in the popish religion&#146;  (Evelyn, 3.326). From 1663 to 1665 Evelyn was tutored by Edward Phillips, a nephew of the poet John Milton, and from 1665 to 1667 by Ralph Bohun. He entered Trinity College, Oxford, in 1667 under the care of the president of the college, Dr Ralph Bathurst. He matriculated on 2 May 1668, and left Oxford the following year. In 1672 Evelyn was admitted to the Middle Temple by the solicitor-general, Sir Francis North, and was called to the bar in 1683. During the time of his education he had been presented on separate occasions to the queen mother, Henrietta Maria, and to Charles II, and had been with the court party in Dover and Calais during the negotiations of the secret treaty of Dover. At the age of eighteen Evelyn received instruction and advice from the Anglican bishop of Chichester &#145;before he received the Holy Sacrament&#146;. In 1675 Evelyn travelled to France in the entourage of the English ambassador, Lord Berkeley. On 24 February 1680 Evelyn married Martha (<i>c</i>.1660&#150;1726), daughter of Lady Martha Stonhouse by her first husband, Richard Spencer, a London merchant. Although the marriage produced two sons and three daughters, only a son and a daughter survived infancy. The marriage settlement included a dowry of &pound;5000 plus a jointure of &pound;500 a year after the death of Evelyn's parents.<br>
<br>Evelyn's work as a translator included <span class="italic">Of Gardens: Four Books, First Written in Latine Verse by Renatus Rapinus, and now Made English</span> (1673), a version of Fran&ccedil;ois de Chassepol's French work, translated as <span class="italic">The History of the Grand Visiers</span> (1677), and Plutarch's &#145;Life of Alexander the Great&#146; for <span class="italic">Plutarch's Lives by Several Hands</span> (1683&#150;6). He contributed some prefatory Greek hexameters, which he had written at the age of fifteen, to his father's work, <span class="italic">Sylva</span> (8th edn, 1678), as well as a reprint of the second book of his translation of Rapin's <span class="italic">Hortorum liber</span>. He also had several poems published in the third edition of Dryden's <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span> (1702) and in John Nichols's <span class="italic">Collection of Poems</span>.<br>
<br>Evelyn's career in government commenced in 1687, when he was employed in Devon on a commission from the Treasury lords about concealed lands. In December of the following year he joined William of Orange at Abingdon, and, as a volunteer in Lord Lovelace's troop, helped to secure Oxford. In 1690 he purchased the chief clerkship of the Treasury, a post from which he was removed within a year. In early 1692 he was appointed as one of the seven commissioners of the revenue in Ireland. Although Evelyn was pleased with the appointment, his father considered it to be &#145;far from my wishes&#146; and could only hope that &#145;I may yet see him in prosperity again&#146;  (Evelyn, 5.92, 113). His father's wishes were not to be fulfilled, and after four years in Ireland, Evelyn returned to England in ill health. Thereafter he spent his remaining years in England. Evelyn died on 24 March 1699, at Berkeley Street, London, from the illness which he had contracted in Ireland. He was buried in the family vault in Wotton, Surrey.<br>
