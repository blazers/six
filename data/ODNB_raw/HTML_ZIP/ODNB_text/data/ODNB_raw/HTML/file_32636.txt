<span class="headword">Croke,  Thomas William</span>  (1823&#150;1902), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic archbishop of Cashel</span>, was born on 19 May 1823 at Dromin, Castlecor, co. Cork, the third child of William Croke (1792&#150;1834), estate agent, and his wife, Isabelle Plummer (1796&#150;1854). His father was a Roman Catholic, but his mother, who was descended from Thomas Fitzgerald, sixteenth knight of Glin, Glin Castle, co. Limerick, was a protestant until a few years before her death, when she became a Roman Catholic. There were eight children, two daughters and six sons: the girls and three of the boys entered the service of the church. After the death of Thomas's father in 1834 the family moved to Charleville, co. Cork, where Thomas spent five years in the endowed school (1834&#150;9). He was a fine sportsman and excelled in handball, a game he continued to play in adult life. In 1839 he successfully gained a scholarship to the Irish College, Paris, and spent the next six years there studying philosophy and theology. In 1845, being too young for ordination, he was sent for a few months to teach English and mathematics in the diocesan seminary at Menin, Belgium. He then went on to Rome, where he spent the next two years studying theology at the Gregorian University (1845&#150;7). He was ordained priest on 29 May 1847, for the diocese of Cloyne, and awarded a doctorate in theology on 15 July of that year.<br>
<br>Croke returned to Ireland in November 1847, and spent one year on the staff of Carlow College before being recalled to teach theology in his former alma mater, the Irish College, Paris. In August 1849 he returned once more to Ireland, this time as curate of Charleville, succeeding his older brother William, who had died from famine fever. For the next nine years Croke served as curate in various parishes in the diocese of Cloyne: Charleville (September 1849 to June 1853), Midleton (June 1853 to July 1857), and Mallow (August 1857 to September 1858). During these years he became well-known throughout Ireland as a preacher of charitable sermons and a champion of the poor. He also became involved in Irish politics, writing articles for <span class="italic">The Nation</span> newspaper. In 1857 he inherited a large fortune from an uncle, James Croke, who had been crown solicitor in Port Melbourne, Australia. In 1858 the bishop of Cloyne, William Keane, appointed Croke first president of the newly established diocesan seminary of St Colman's, Fermoy, co. Cork, a position he held until February 1866, when he became parish priest of Doneraile and vicar-general of the diocese of Cloyne. Croke was in Rome from December 1869 until June 1870, acting as theological adviser to Bishop Keane during the First Vatican Council.<br>
<br>While Croke was in Rome the diocese of Auckland, New Zealand, became vacant. Croke's name had been proposed to the Roman authorities by Cardinal Paul Cullen, the archbishop of Dublin. His official appointment to Auckland is dated 15 June 1870. He apparently made an agreement with the Roman authorities that he would stay in Auckland only for as long as was needed to put the diocese on a sound financial footing. He was consecrated bishop of Auckland in Rome on 10 July 1870, and arrived in Auckland on 17 December 1870. Almost immediately he set about putting the affairs of the diocese in order, as can be seen from the detailed diary which he kept of his administration. Within two and a half years he had bought back the property which had been mortgaged, and is said to have restored discipline and religious fervour among his priests and flock. He departed from Auckland on 28 January 1874 and arrived back in Ireland at the end of May. The Roman authorities were somewhat surprised at Croke's sudden departure from Auckland, but were forced to accept the <i>fait accompli</i>.<br>
<br>When Patrick Leahy, the archbishop of Cashel, died on 26 January 1875, Croke's name was among those mentioned as a possible successor. He was appointed archbishop of Cashel on 25 June 1875, and administered the diocese until his death in 1902. He was a very able administrator, and soon became the leading spokesperson for the Irish Catholic church. He became deeply involved in the Irish Land War (1879&#150;92), the struggle for home rule, and the founding of the Gaelic Athletic Association in 1884. He counted among his friends many eminent public figures, including William Gladstone, Cardinal Manning, Charles S. Parnell, and Michael Davitt. In 1895 Croke celebrated his silver jubilee as a bishop amid great festivities throughout Ireland. He died in Thurles, co. Tipperary, on 22 July 1902. His funeral took place on 26 July 1902, and he was buried in a vault in his cathedral at Thurles.<br>
<br>Croke was a well-built man, well over 6 feet tall, with a cheerful and impressive appearance, as can be seen from his portrait, in Archbishop's House, Thurles. He maintained a special interest in sport throughout his life, and the national stadium for Gaelic games in Dublin, Croke Park, was named after him. But it was in the political and social life of his day, and in the creating of an Irish national identity, that he made his real mark. He had a very independent mind, and on many issues was reputed to be &#145;unchanged and unchangeable&#146;. His only publications were a few pastorals, and the letters and poems written for <span class="italic">The Nation</span> newspaper. He was greatly admired and loved throughout his life and familiarly referred to as Croke of Cashel.<br>
