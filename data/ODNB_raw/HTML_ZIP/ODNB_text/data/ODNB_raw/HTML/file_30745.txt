<span class="headword">Adair,  Gilbert Smithson</span>  (1896&#150;1979), <span class="occ">physiologist</span>, was born on 21 September 1896 in Whitehaven, the elder child and only son of Harold Adair, manager of an iron ore mine in Cumberland, and his wife, Anna Mary Jackson, from Garstang. The family later moved to nearby Egremont. Adair was educated privately at home for several years and, encouraged by both parents, became absorbed in the area and its natural history, particularly at the sea-shore. A room in the house was set up as a laboratory, equipped with a microscope. In his early teens Adair was sent to Bootham, the Quaker school in York. There he found life spartan, even for his simple tastes. The school recognized his talents in biology and chemistry, and he successfully took the entrance scholarship examination at King's College, Cambridge, in 1914. He entered that college in 1915, obtaining a first class in part one of the natural sciences tripos in 1917.<br>
<br>With his defective eyesight, Adair failed in his attempt to join the Friends' Ambulance Unit. He entered the Food Investigation Board to inquire into the then important problem of preventing wastage of imported food on cargo ships. He returned to King's College, Cambridge, as a research student in 1920 and joined the physiological laboratory, though he retained links with the Food Investigation Board which proved to be useful when a Refrigeration Research Station (later the Low Temperature Research Station) was established in Cambridge in 1922. Adair was granted cold-room facilities which he continued to use until his death. In 1923 he was elected to a research fellowship at King's College and published several major papers during his tenure, so that in 1928 the college made him an official fellow for five years, allowing him to concentrate on research. From 1931 to 1945 he was assistant director of research in the physiological laboratory, from 1945 to 1963 reader in biophysics, and from 1963 honorary fellow of King's College. In 1939 he was elected fellow of the Royal Society.<br>
<br>After early work on the diffusion of electrolytes in gels, Adair entered on what was to be his major field, the physical chemistry of haemoglobin and its interactions with simple gases. His work between 1924 and 1930 was the first to show that haemoglobin was a well-defined material with highly specific structure, unique molecular weight, and the capability of reacting stoichiometrically and reproducibly. In particular he is remembered for perfecting and simplifying the osmotic pressure method of measuring molecular weight, which was subsequently widely used by himself and by others throughout the world. By 1940 he had published some forty-five papers on the application of osmotic and membrane potential measurements to a variety of protein systems. From 1940 to 1977, although the volume of his output fell somewhat, he was in great demand from visiting scientists and PhD students, to whom he was always willing to demonstrate patiently and fully his latest developments. He was an excellent teacher. Many of his later papers were written in collaboration with visitors from all parts of the world. His last paper (with K. Imai from Japan) returned to his favourite subject, haemoglobin.<br>
<br>In July 1931 Adair married Muriel Elaine (<i>c</i>.1900&#150;1975), one of the three daughters of George Hardinge Robinson, a stockbroker from Southport. Muriel entered Girton College in 1918, and went on to obtain a research fellowship at Newnham, and a staff fellowship at Girton. At one stage she worked with Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins but eventually she turned to proteins and collaborated with Adair in many papers from 1930 onwards. She also accompanied him on climbing expeditions. They had no children.<br>
<br>Although quiet and retiring, Adair made many friends. Climbing in the Lake District, in the Dolomites, and in Colorado, as well as around the university and college buildings in Cambridge in the earlier part of his life, was later replaced by an interest in his garden. Here he and his wife spent much time, encouraging nearly all forms of wild life (ducks and rooks excluded). Muriel died on 2 January 1975; Adair on 22 June 1979, in Cambridge.<br>
