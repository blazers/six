<span class="headword">Birch,  Thomas Ledlie</span>  (1754&#150;1828), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian General Synod of Ulster</span>, was born at Birch Grove, Gilford, co. Down, the youngest child of John Birch, linen merchant and farmer, and Jane Ledlie (1716&#150;1791). He graduated MA from Glasgow University in 1772. He was licensed by Dromore presbytery in 1775 and ordained in Saintfield by Belfast presbytery on 21 May 1776. He married a relative, Isabella Ledlie (1760&#150;1836), in December 1783. He was one of the most active ministers in the General Synod of Ulster with a congregation of over 900 families. Many Ulster Presbyterians had ties of kinship with the Americans. During the American War of Independence Birch considered that Great Britain had levied an unnatural war upon colonists, many of whom were his brethren. In 1784 he assisted in the preparation of an address to George Washington by the Yankee Club of Stewartstown, co. Tyrone, expressing satisfaction that the colonists had overthrown the yoke of slavery. Washington sent a favourable reply.<br>
<br>A supporter of the Irish Volunteers, Birch served as chaplain to the local corps, the Saintfield light infantry. When the volunteers were disbanded, and the more radical Society of United Irishmen was founded in Belfast in 1791, he approved its aims of full parliamentary reform and Catholic emancipation, and formed the first United Irish society in co. Down in January 1792. Soon afterwards he reported to Wolfe Tone that he &#145;had no doubt but that the cause was spreading most rapidly&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography of Theobald Wolfe Tone</span>, 1.116). On Christmas day 1792 his congregation approved resolutions similar to those earlier passed by the Saintfield United Irishmen. A regular attender at synod, in 1793 Birch gave the synodical address <span class="italic">The Obligation upon Christians and Especially Ministers to be Exemplary in their Lives</span>, which was published in 1794. This was &#145;a commonplace address, remarkable for nothing, except for fixing on 1848 as the time for the fall of the Papacy&#146;  (Witherow, 285). The Society of United Irishmen had been a perfectly legal movement at its inception, but by 1796 it had come under suspicion from the Irish authorities as a subversive military force planning to rebel against the state. The government resorted to draconian military tactics, including flogging of suspects and burning of dwellings. Many United Irish supporters left the movement but Birch remained true to the cause.<br>
<br>In 1796 some dissident members of his congregation, assisted by the Seceders, a rival Presbyterian denomination, established a second Presbyterian congregation in Saintfield. Incensed at their actions Birch penned a scathing pamphlet, <span class="italic">Physicians Languishing under Disease</span>, in which he denounced all Seceders as cheats, hypocrites, defamers, revilers, and disturbers of the peace of the church. In 1797 eleven members of his congregation were charged with attacking the dwelling of a local yeoman. While attending their trial Birch himself was arrested and charged with high treason. Released on bail to appear before the next assizes, he was acquitted after a lengthy trial. In April 1798 he was again before the courts, this time charged with having offered a bribe to a witness not to prosecute a United Irishman. At trial the person concerned withdrew his evidence and Birch was again discharged.<br>
<br>The first eruption of the United Irish rising in co. Down was at Saintfield on 9 June. Birch was present in the insurgent camp at Creevy Rocks, a hill on the outskirts of the village, on 10 June, which has become known as Pike Sunday. He has been credited with preaching to the rebels, using as his text <span class="roman">Ezekiel</span> 9: 1, &#145;draw near, even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand&#146;. He was arrested three days after the defeat of the rebels at Ballynahinch, and charged with rebellion and treason. At the court martial in Lisburn his enemies confidently expected him to be condemned and executed. However his brother Dr George Birch was captain of the Newtownards yeomen and had fought on the king's side at Saintfield. Dr Birch exerted his influence with the military authorities and it was arranged that if his suspect brother agreed to exile his life would be spared. Birch assented. However he was not released immediately. He was taken to Belfast and put on board a prison ship on Belfast Lough, in company with a number of other arrested United Irishmen. He was released on 16 August 1798 and he sailed from Belfast to New York, arriving in September. Soon afterwards he published a firsthand account of the conditions prevailing in Ireland, and in the Saintfield district in particular, before and during the days of the rebellion, entitled <span class="italic">Letter from an Irish Emigrant</span>.<br>
<br>In 1799 Birch moved with his family to Philadelphia, having received a call from former members of Saintfield congregation. He failed to persuade the Ohio presbytery to admit him as a member. After further attempts in 1800 and 1801 he appealed to the general assembly, but in vain. Combative as ever, in 1804 he successfully sued the clerk of the Ohio presbytery for slander, a verdict overturned on appeal. He was eventually received by the Baltimore presbytery. He purchased a farm in the vicinity of Washington in 1804, and died at Freeport, Armstrong county, on 12 April 1828. His widow died in Cadiz, Ohio, on 25 November 1836.<br>
