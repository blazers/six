<span class="headword">Fletcher,  Alan Gerard</span>  (1931&#150;2006), <span class="occ">graphic designer</span>, was born on 27 September 1931 in Nairobi, Kenya, the only child of Bernard Wolfe Fletcher, an executive in the Kenyan government, and his wife, Dorothy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Murphy. His father died in 1936, and he and his mother then returned to his maternal grandparents' house in Shepherd's Bush, west London. At the outset of the Second World War in 1939 he was evacuated to Christ's Hospital, Horsham, Sussex. Leaving school in 1949 he took a place at Hammersmith College of Art, assuring his anxious mother that it would equip him for a teaching career. He transferred to the Central School of Arts and Crafts a year later, where his classmates included his future colleagues Colin Forbes and Theo Crosby, and his ambitions expanded. He spent an interim year in Barcelona teaching English, before returning to London in 1953 to embark on postgraduate study at the Royal College of Art. During this time he worked on the student publication <span class="italic">Ark</span> and met artists and designers including Peter Blake, Joe Tilson, and the future spy novelist Len Deighton.<br>
<br>Finding early 1950s London gloomy, Fletcher longed for the bright lights of the United States of America, a nation he understood largely through Hollywood films. In 1956 he arranged an exchange for himself between the Royal College of Art and Yale University. After marrying his long-term Italian girlfriend Paola (<i>b</i>. 1927), daughter of Raffaele Biagi, bank manager, at Kensington register office on 5 July 1956, he applied for visas for them both to enter the USA on the white Kenyan quota. Once at Yale he was exposed to the teaching of seminal modern art and design talents including Josef Albers and Paul Rand. He visited New York where he also met prominent designers including Robert Brownjohn, Ivan Chermayeff, and Tom Geismar. These young practitioners were an important inspiration for Fletcher, particularly in encouraging him to establish an independent studio on his return to London.<br>
<br>Fletcher often made the modest claim that his career sprang from being at the right place at the right time. In 1957 he presented his portfolio to Lio Lionni, then the art director of the Time and Life publication <span class="italic">Fortune</span>. He was immediately offered the opportunity to design the magazine's cover, on the strength of which he won a job in the marketing department of Time and Life. Setting up home in the West Village, Fletcher would have settled in New York, but for his wife's homesickness. After a tour across the USA, during which he worked briefly for the film titles designer Saul Bass, he and Paola returned to Europe via Venezuela. Their brief South American adventure was the product of a fantasy, Fletcher envisaging himself designing rugs to be woven by local artisans. The idea was cut short by the outbreak of a revolution on their arrival, which prompted the couple to take the last boat out of Caracas, heading to Genoa. Fletcher worked for a few months in Milan for the tyre manufacturer Pirelli before returning to London.<br>
<br>In 1959 Fletcher set up home in Notting Hill and rented a desk in Colin Forbes's studio. His daughter, Rafaella, was born in 1961. Continuing to work for Pirelli, Fletcher was also a regular designer of Penguin paperback covers, commissioned by the innovative art director Germano Facetti. His bold, ideas-driven graphic style and his ability to communicate directly with top management indicated a formidable new direction in design. In 1962 Fletcher and Forbes teamed up with the American &eacute;migr&eacute; Bob Gill to form the firm Fletcher/Forbes/Gill. Later the same year they teamed up with others, including David Bailey and Terence Donovan, to found the Designers and Art Directors Association, of which Fletcher acted as president in 1973.<br>
<br>Between 1962 and 1972 Fletcher/Forbes/Gill evolved into the multidisciplinary design studio Pentagram. During that period Gill resigned and Fletcher and Forbes were joined by the architect Theo Crosby, the product designer Kenneth Grange, and the art director Mervyn Kurlansky. Occupying a large former warehouse in Paddington basin, Pentagram acquired many large-scale corporate clients, including the news agency Reuters and the cruise line Cunard. Fletcher remained at Pentagram for two decades, successfully reconciling his taste for graphic play with his facility for consummate professionalism. In 1993 he left to establish a studio in his mews home in Pembridge Crescent.<br>
<br>Working independently, Fletcher combined an emphasis on long-standing personal projects with the position of art director, both at Phaidon Press and at the Novartis Campus, a pharmaceutical research facility in Basel. He retained these appointments until the end of his life. He received many honours during his career, including appointment as a royal designer for industry in 1972, presidency of the Alliance Graphique Internationale in 1982, and fellowship of the Royal College of Art in 1989. He was inducted into the New York-based Art Directors Club hall of fame in 1994. His numerous books included the monograph <span class="italic">Beware Wet Paint</span> (1996) and the 1066 page masterwork <span class="italic">The Art of Looking Sideways</span> (2001). After a short illness he died of lung cancer on 21 September 2006 at his daughter's house, Merrilies, Woodcote Road, Forest Row, Sussex. Both she and Paola survived him. He was described in his obituaries as &#145;a man uniquely responsible for defining British graphic design &hellip; from the late 1950s onwards&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 25 Sept 2006), &#145;the father figure of British graphic design&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 26 Sept 2006), and &#145;the most highly regarded graphic designer of his generation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 29 Sept 2006). A later tribute described him as &#145;Britain's best ever graphic designer&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Observer</span>, 12 Nov 2006).<br>
