<span class="headword">Cavendish,  William</span>, second duke of Devonshire  (1670/71&#150;1729), <span class="occ">politician and art collector</span>, was the second but first surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4948/', "William Cavendish, first duke of Devonshire (1641&#150;1707)")</script>, and Mary (1646&#150;1710), second daughter of James Butler, first duke of Ormond. Following his father's accession to the earldom of Devonshire in 1684 he was known by courtesy as Lord Cavendish, and after his father's elevation to the dukedom in 1694 he was called marquess of Hartington.<h2>
<a name="Earlylife"></a>Early life</h2>Lord Cavendish was educated privately, but was noted as being present at a court entertainment in November 1686. After protracted negotiations, including for a reputed portion of &pound;25,000, on 21 June 1688, at Southampton House, St Giles-in-the-fields, London, he was married by John Sharp, the future archbishop of York, to Lady Rachel Russell (1674&#150;1725), the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24344/', "William Russell, Lord Russell")</script>, a political associate of his father, who had been executed for complicity in the Rye House plot, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24335/', "Lady Rachel Russell")</script>. At least six sons and six daughters were born of the marriage, three children of each sex surviving their parents.<br>
<br>His father's intrigues with William of Orange may have dictated that, rather than settle down with his young wife, Lord Cavendish should spend some time out of the country. By October 1688 he was writing from Brussels to his mother-in-law, and his movements during the revolution of that year are unclear. At the beginning of 1689 he was commissioned as the colonel of the regiment (10th horse) raised by his father, and he retained the colonelcy until April 1690. However, by that date he was travelling on the continent, visiting Vienna, Brussels, L&uuml;beck and (in June 1691) Padua.<br>
<br>Lord Cavendish returned to England later in 1691, ready to be launched on a public career. Plans were made to secure him the vacant parliamentary seat at Westminster, but fierce competition for the constituency made his father unwilling to risk a defeat and he did not contest the election. He served as a volunteer in Flanders in the campaign of 1692. He may have begun to collect art during this period, possibly being the purchaser of drawings sold from the collections of Sir Peter Lely and P. H. Lankrink between 1688 and 1694, later recorded as part of the Devonshire collection at the family seat of Chatsworth House in Derbyshire.<h2>
<a name="HouseofCommons"></a>House of Commons</h2>Hartington entered parliament as MP for Derbyshire at the election of 1695. In his first session in the Commons he supported the court in several important divisions and signed the association. In the following session he missed the vote on the Sir John Fenwick attainder bill in November 1696. His absence may have indicated a growing willingness to oppose the court, which was confirmed by his votes in the session of 1697&#150;8 against the standing army. He also played a leading role in the pursuit of the perpetrators of a fraud concerning exchequer bills, which led him to defend the rights of the Commons against the pretensions of the House of Lords.<br>
<br>Hartington was returned unopposed for Derbyshire at the 1698 election, proposing the court-backed whig, Sir Thomas Littleton, for speaker. However, he remained a prominent spokesman against the standing army. On 4 January 1699 he spoke against a court-inspired attempt to increase the number of men above the 7000 previously agreed. So effective was Hartington that William III reproached his father about his conduct, only to be told that Hartington and his brother &#145;had advanced nothing but what was reasonable, nothing but what he would have said himself if he had been in their place&#146;  (Grimblot, 2.321).<br>
<br>Hartington's stature had now risen sufficiently for his wife's uncle, the earl of Orford, to propose him, unsuccessfully, for the post of treasurer of the navy. The following session saw Hartington heavily involved in the controversy surrounding the resumption of Irish forfeited estates. In particular he was keen to add a place clause, excluding excise commissioners from the Commons, to the <span class="roman">Irish Forfeitures Bill</span>, which itself was tacked to the land tax and again prompted a clash with the Lords over their rights and privileges. He was similarly active in the defence of the remaining whig ministers in the government, being prominent in the debate on 10 April 1700 when a motion to remove Lord Chancellor Somers from office was defeated. Following the end of the session Hartington allegedly refused a court post because he was &#145;so much a friend of my Lord Somers, that he would not be obliged&#146;  (James, 3.94). Following his re-election for Derbyshire in January 1701 he was again prominent in debates, particularly on the succession and the need for an accord with the Dutch, and in defence of Somers, Orford, and other former ministers from charges of impeachment.<br>
<br>Hartington was defeated in the Derbyshire election of November 1701, and lodged a petition against the result. Meanwhile he was made captain of the yeomen of the guard, at a salary of &pound;1000 p.a., and rumours circulated that he would be made a secretary of state. Hartington withdrew his petition upon his election at Castle Rising on 2 February 1702, where his partner was his long-term friend Robert Walpole. Hartington was soon back in the fray, moving in the Commons on 24 February that the committee instructed to consider the rights and liberties of the House of Commons should also consider the rights and liberties of the commons of England, and on 26 February proposing that it was the undoubted right of the commons of England to petition for the calling, sitting, and dissolving of parliaments and for the redressing of grievances.<br>
<br>At the election of 1702 Hartington was returned for Yorkshire. His pre-eminence among the whigs in the Commons was again demonstrated on 26 October 1702, when he moved an amendment to the address emphasizing that the duke of Marlborough had been instrumental in &#145;maintaining&#146; rather than &#145;retrieving&#146; England's honour. In the session of 1703&#150;4 he played a full part in defeating the bill against occasional conformity, and on the whig side in the controversial <i>Ashby v. White</i> case. In the following session he spoke against leave for the introduction of a third <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity Bill</span>, and duly voted against the controversial motion to tack it to a supply bill.<br>
<br>When Queen Anne visited Cambridge University in April 1705 both Hartington and his father were awarded honorary doctorates of law. He was re-elected for Yorkshire in 1705. In December, he moved the committal of the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span>. In May 1706 he was named a commissioner to negotiate the union with Scotland.<br>
<br>By the time of his father's death, on 18 August 1707, Hartington had acquired a considerable reputation. In James Brydges' view, &#145;we lose by his removal to the House of Peers a very considerable Member in the House of Commons, and whose loss will not easily be repaired&#146;  (Hunt. L., Stowe MS 57(1), 255). A few years earlier John Macky had portrayed him as a man who<blockquote>hath for many years made a considerable figure in the House of Commons. A gentleman of very good sense, a bold orator, and zealous abettor of the liberty of the people &hellip; He is one of the best beloved gentlemen, by the Country Party, in England. (<span class="italic">Memoirs of the Secret Services</span>, 47)</blockquote>John Vanbrugh reported in September 1707 that &#145;his father left but a small estate after all, not above &pound;10,000, as Sir James Forbes tells me&#146;, but that given his other assets, &#145;he is left in a very good condition&#146;  (duke of Manchester, 2.251). This relatively healthy state of affairs may well have come about due to the reorganization of the family finances made in an estate act passed in 1705.<h2>
<a name="HouseofLords"></a>House of Lords</h2>Devonshire succeeded his father in most of his offices, including the lord stewardship and the lord lieutenancy of Derbyshire, and, after a short delay, membership of the cabinet. He took his seat in the Lords on 23 October 1707. There, he became an important point of pressure on both Marlborough and Godolphin, and Queen Anne. Between March and June 1708 he was one of those pressing for the admission of Somers to the cabinet, and, likewise, in 1709, he supported the appointment of Orford to head the Admiralty. His activities outside politics that year included involvement in a consortium, whose other members included Somers, Charles Montagu, Lord Halifax, and Thomas Herbert, eighth earl of Pembroke, which employed the antiquary John Talman to live in Italy and buy works of art on behalf of individual participants.<br>
<br>In January 1710 Devonshire was employed in trying to ensure that Marlborough did not resign over the queen's decision to award a regiment to Jack Hill, the brother of Abigail Masham. On 20 March he voted for the impeachment of Henry Sacheverell. Robert Harley entertained hopes that Devonshire could be detached from the whigs and used the duke of Newcastle as a means of enticing him into the new ministry. However, Devonshire remained part of the whig leadership, being consulted on its response to the earl of Sunderland's dismissal. He signed a letter on 14 June 1710 exhorting Marlborough to continue in his post and was also involved in discussion with whig financiers on how to put pressure on the queen to retain her whig ministers.<br>
<br>After the decision to dissolve parliament in September 1710 Devonshire was dismissed (or resigned) from the lord stewardship. However, having been nominated KG in March 1710, he was installed on 22 December. He lost the lord lieutenancy of Derbyshire in September 1711. Devonshire, who was by this time a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/73609', "Kit-Cat Club")</script>, was often prominent in the opposition in the Lords. He signed five protests in January and February 1711 against resolutions criticizing the previous ministry's conduct of the war in Spain. He also spoke in the debate on the address on 7 December 1711, in favour of the &#145;no peace without Spain&#146; resolution, and later that month he moved for a bill to give the electoral prince of Hanover, duke of Cambridge (the future George II) precedence over all other peers. He supported the motion on 28 May 1712 for an address opposing the &#145;restraining orders&#146; given to the duke of Ormond, and signed another protest on 7 June against an address allowing the ministry a free hand in completing the peace negotiations.<br>
<br>Following the House of Lords committal of the <span class="roman">Schism Bill</span> on 4 June 1714 Devonshire presented a petition on behalf of some dissenting protestants and on 15 June he signed a protest against the bill. On 8 July he signed another protest concerning the implementation of the <i>asiento</i> contract for the supply of slaves to South America.<h2>
<a name="ThereignofGeorgeI"></a>The reign of George I</h2>The Hanoverian succession saw Devonshire named as a lord justice to rule the country until the arrival of George I. He was then restored to the lord stewardship (September 1714) and the lord lieutenancy of Derbyshire (October 1714). As a person of influence on 18 August 1715 he presented a petition on behalf of the duchess of Ormond, whose husband (his mother's nephew) was facing a bill of attainder. On 10 April 1716 Devonshire brought in the bill to repeal the <span class="roman">Triennial Act</span>. In July 1716 he exchanged his office of lord steward for that of lord president of the council. The king remarked at this time that he was a &#145;very honest disinterested man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Mary, Countess Cowper</span>, 110).<br>
<br>In the emerging whig split at the beginning of 1717 Devonshire was part of the Walpole&#150;Townshend group. He supported those bishops who wished to defend the Church of England, George Smalridge, bishop of Bristol, noting on 25 March 1717 that Devonshire had &#145;declared that he would as soon consent to a bill for divesting him of Chatsworth, as for depriving the universities of their privileges&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Diaries of William Nicolson</span>, 640). Devonshire left the government in the wake of Walpole and Townshend on 16 April.<br>
<br>On 19 December 1717 Devonshire and his heir successfully petitioned the House of Lords for leave to bring in a bill to settle his estates, an essential measure preparatory to the marriage of the marquess of Hartington with Catherine Hoskins, the heir of a London businessman. During the session of 1717&#150;18 Devonshire took a major role in support of the prince of Wales in the quarrel with his father, and in persuading him to submit to his father in January 1718. On 20 February 1718 he signed two protests in the Lords against the <span class="roman">Mutiny Bill</span>.<br>
<br>In January 1719 Devonshire supported Archbishop Wake &#145;and others of the staunch old Whigs [who] have appeared so gloriously on behalf of the Church&#146;  (Wake MS 21/84) in defence of the <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity Act</span>. He was involved in the negotiations in April 1720 that brought about the reconciliation between the king and the prince of Wales and also ended the whig schism. With the readmittance of Walpole and Townshend to office in June 1720 Devonshire was again in favour and named as a lord justice in 1720, as he was again in 1723 and 1725.<br>
<br>Beyond politics, Devonshire maintained his interest in art. Having bought part of Lord Somers's collection at its dispersal in 1717, in 1723 he bought 225 drawings that had belonged to Nicolaes Anthoni Flinck, whose father Govaert Flinck had been a pupil of Rembrandt. In addition to Rembrandt, artists represented in the purchase included Rubens, Raphael, Mantegna, Barocci, and Annibale Carracci, contributing to the Devonshire collection's reputation as &#145;unequalled at the time in England&#146;  (Blunt, 39)<br>
<br>Devonshire succeeded Baron Carleton as lord president in March 1725. He was placed in a difficult position during the attack on Lord Chancellor Macclesfield, a long-term whig ally, surprising some observers by voting him guilty on 25 May, although on the following day he was one of those who exerted himself to mitigate his punishment. However, he had no scruple in opposing the bill allowing Viscount Bolingbroke to reclaim his estates.<br>
<br>Devonshire played a key role in securing Walpole in power after the death of George I, many of the relevant meetings taking place at his London residence, Devonshire House. In November 1727 George II chose Devonshire as his own replacement as a governor of Charterhouse. By this date Devonshire was increasingly afflicted with gout, a condition that had plagued him since 1704. In November 1728 the earl of Godolphin reported that Devonshire &#145;is free from pain, but he has such a weakness in his knees as leaves him no sort of use of his legs&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 61437, fol. 123).<br>
<br>In March and May 1729 Devonshire was still active in national affairs, but he was reported to be dangerously ill at the end of May 1729, and Newcastle blamed the gout for his absence from cabinet. He died on 4 June 1729 at Devonshire House, Piccadilly, London, and was buried in All Saints' Church, Derby.<h2>
<a name="Deathandlegacy"></a>Death and legacy</h2>Sir Robert Walpole was reported to be inconsolable upon hearing the news of his death, possibly because Devonshire was &#145;always steady to his party and constant to his friends&#146;  (Sedgwick, 1.24). Lord Hervey claimed that:<blockquote>Devonshire was a man who had no uncommon portion of understanding; and as his chief skill lay in painting, medals, and horses, he was more able as a virtuoso than a statesman, and a much better jockey than he was a politician. (ibid.)</blockquote>Devonshire was without question one of the principal art collectors of the period, but the record of his collection is incomplete, as much of it was kept not at Chatsworth but at Devonshire House, where the earliest account of the collection was not made until 1761. He is known to have assembled &#145;a magnificent collection of engravings&#146;  (Blunt, 21) which was continued by his son the third duke. He also owned collections of gems and coins, each housed in a specially built Boulle cabinet, one of which appeared with him in the portrait by Charles Jervas. As Hervey indicated, Devonshire also owned racehorses, including the pre-eminent stallion on the turf in the 1720s, Flying Childers, sired by Richard Darley's Arabian, and kept a stud. Hervey underestimated Devonshire's value as a politician: perhaps, as a duke, Devonshire found his abilities were taken for granted. As his taste as a virtuoso contributed to the eminence of the Cavendish family within the whig aristocracy, his powers as a speaker and a negotiator played an influential if largely unsung role in establishing whig political dominance in eighteenth-century Britain.<br>
