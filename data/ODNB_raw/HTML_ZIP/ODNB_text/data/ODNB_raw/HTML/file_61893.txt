<span class="headword">Tate <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Frank]</span>,  Phyllis Margaret Duncan</span>  (1911&#150;1987), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 6 April 1911 at Lexden Ovalway, Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, the only child of the architect John Duncan Tate (<i>d</i>. before 1932) and his wife, Annie Stewart Holt. The family moved to London after the First World War, and Tate attended a small private school until she was expelled at ten for singing a bawdy music-hall song (taught to her by her father). She had no further formal schooling, but took up the ukelele, started composing foxtrots and blues, and joined a group of musicians who gave concerts for charity as well as playing in hospitals and old people's homes. The composer Harry Farjeon heard her performing and encouraged her to undertake a more formal musical education.<br>
<br>Tate studied from 1928 to 1932 at the Royal Academy of Music, London, where her principal study was composition (with Farjeon) but where she also took lessons in conducting and the timpani. Several of her works were played at the academy while she was a student, including a symphony and an operetta, <span class="italic">The Policeman's Serenade</span> (with a libretto by A. J. Herbert). After leaving the academy she achieved more performances of her work: her cello concerto was given a prestigious premi&egrave;re by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra under Dan Godfrey in 1934, and four songs for tenor and piano and a string quartet in A (1936) were played at the Macnaghten&#150;Lemare concerts in London.<br>
<br>Oxford University Press started publishing Tate's music in 1935. In that year she married Alan Clifford Frank (1910&#150;1994), a clarinettist. Her husband was a music editor, and served as head of music at OUP (1954&#150;75). The couple had two children: a son, Colin, in 1940 and a daughter, Celia, in 1952. During the 1930s Tate published commercial light music under various pseudonyms such as Max Morelle and Janos. An accomplished arranger, she later published numerous arrangements of a wide variety of traditional songs. Always extremely self-critical, Tate felt dissatisfied with her early concert works and after the Second World War destroyed almost all of them. The first work she was prepared to acknowledge was her concerto for alto saxophone and strings (1944), commissioned by the BBC. This was followed by two works which firmly established her reputation as an inventive and imaginative composer: the chamber cantata <span class="italic">Nocturne for Four Voices</span> (1945) to a text by Sidney Keyes, for four singers accompanied by string quartet, double bass, bass clarinet, and celesta, and a sonata for clarinet and cello (1947). In 1947 she was featured in a BBC Third Programme series entitled <span class="italic">Contemporary British Composers</span>.<br>
<br>Tate delighted in creating unusual sounds and textures, always presented within a clearly defined structure. She believed that music should entertain and give pleasure, an approach that can be clearly seen in her interest in composing for children and amateurs. But in all her works she was concerned to be directly communicative, while never compromising her very individual musical language and sound-world.<br>
<br>Tate was apparently not interested in writing large-scale instrumental works, and from the 1950s onwards she turned increasingly to vocal and choral music while continuing to explore the world of chamber music. Her striking cantata to Tennyson's famous poem <span class="italic">The Lady of Shallott</span> (1956), for tenor, viola, two pianos, and percussion, was commissioned by the BBC Third Programme as part of its tenth anniversary celebrations. Her opera <span class="italic">The Lodger</span>, based on the story of Jack the Ripper, was premi&egrave;red at the Royal Academy of Music in 1960 and broadcast on the Third Programme four years later. Other stage works included the television opera <span class="italic">Dark Pilgrimage</span> (1963), <span class="italic">The What d'ye Call it</span> (1966), after the play by John Gay, and several works for children. She later expressed interest, unfortunately never realized, in writing a musical based on the life of Mrs Beeton, in which she would set the recipes from her <span class="italic">Household Management</span> as songs.<br>
<br>From 1954 Tate lived in Hampstead, north London, and became involved with local musical groups such as the Hampstead Music Club and the Barnet and District Choral Society. She was president of the latter, for which she wrote the cantata <span class="italic">St Martha and the Dragon</span> (1977) for narrator, soloists, chorus, children's chorus, and chamber orchestra. She was also involved in national musical organizations, serving on the executive committee of the Composers' Guild and the management committee of the Performing Right Society's members' fund. She died at the Royal Free Hospital, Camden, London, on 29 May 1987.<br>
