<span class="headword">Adams,  Carol</span>  (1948&#150;2007), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born on 28 July 1948 at Hackney Hospital, London, the daughter of (James) Gordon Adams, wine merchant, and his wife, Daisy Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Matthews. At the time of her birth registration her parents lived at 103 Glyn Road, Hackney. She grew up in working-class east London at the height of the <i>Windrush</i> era, and saw first-hand the influence and impact that a multi-ethnic London, rich with immigrants, would have during the next decades. She won a scholarship and was educated at Christ's Hospital Girls' School, Hertford, a school founded in 1552 to provide a first-class education for disadvantaged children, and it was there that the roots of her enduring commitment to an education system open to and fit for all began to grow.<br>
<br>Adams read history at Warwick University in the 1960s and during this decade of counterculture and revolution she began to explore issues of equality, particularly within the feminist movement. She spent time at the University of California at Berkeley during the peak of the civil rights movement and then returned to London to obtain a postgraduate certificate of education at the Institute of Education. She started teaching history in 1970 at a number of inner London state secondary schools before a stint as the Tower of London's education officer. She then managed the inner London education authority's history and social sciences centre, which ignited her lifelong passion for the promotion of professional development opportunities for all teachers. During this early period of her career she began to write and publish books, including <span class="italic">The Gender Trap</span> (with Rae Lauriekietis, three volumes, 1976) and <span class="italic">Ordinary Lives: a Hundred Years Ago</span> (1982), along with numerous teaching and in-service training materials focusing on equal opportunities within the school setting and gender issues. Meanwhile, on 26 March 1978, at Hendon Reform Synagogue, she married Richard Louis Noss (<i>b</i>. 1950), schoolteacher, and son of Michael John Noss, company director. They had two children, Joseph (Joe) and Amy. The marriage ended in divorce and he remarried, but she and Richard Noss remained lifelong friends.<br>
<br>The next stepping stone for Adams was to become a chief inspector for equal opportunities for the inner London education authority in 1983 and concurrently to study for an MA in human rights at the Institute of Education, awarded in 1984. From 1965 until its abolition in 1990 the education authority for the twelve inner London boroughs promoted and celebrated not just history, but feminist history, to all teachers in Greater London, in over 1000 schools. (Adams had already contributed to the burgeoning literature on women's history as co-editor of Cambridge University Press's <span class="roman">Women in History</span> series, and as a member of the editorial advisory board of Virago, the feminist publishing company.) When the authority was abolished in 1990 she was sought out to become the London borough of Haringey's assistant chief education officer and later the director of education in Wolverhampton. These roles next led her to Shropshire in 1994, where she became the first female chief education officer in England.<br>
<br>In 1997, after Labour's election victory, Adams joined a task force to explore the establishment of an independent professional body for teachers in England. When the General Teaching Council for England was established by the <span class="roman">Teaching and Higher Education Act</span> of 1998 she took the helm as chief executive to set up what would become a globally recognized model of self-regulation and registration for over half a million qualified teachers in England. She worked alongside Lord Puttnam (first chair of the council) as well as a broad coalition from across the education landscape in the UK to create an organization that would benefit the teaching profession. After its launch in September 2000 she and the organization faced criticism from teachers who felt they had not been properly consulted or briefed (despite an extensive consultation period with the public as well as the teaching unions and other bodies). Undaunted, she shouldered much of the criticism and worked indefatigably to reassure teachers around the country that the council was in their best professional interest, and would work both with and for them.<br>
<br>Never afraid to speak her mind, or to swim upstream against public opinion, Adams brought her determination to make evidence count in educational policy-making to Whitehall, and fought tirelessly to ensure that all children experienced a high quality of learning. She believed that education was the key to life chances and always worked to promote a high standard of achievement by all pupils. Her ability to bring the reality and expertise of the classroom to the corridors of Whitehall and Westminster contributed greatly to the influence and impact of the council's advice relating to professional development opportunities and entitlements for teachers.<br>
<br>Adams made sure that she did not get &#145;lost&#146; in the bureaucracy of her role by visiting schools and education settings around the country on a regular basis, even when it meant catching the milk train to start her day. When one letter-writer to the <span class="italic">Times Educational Supplement</span> proclaimed the General Teaching Council for England a &#145;government poodle&#146;  (23 April 2004), she responded by marching into a meeting with education ministers wearing a pink T-shirt emblazoned with a poodle. Critical of many of the previous government's policies, she was not afraid to tell the Labour government to resist further changes to school grant-maintained status because it distracted governing bodies from more important preoccupations, such as literacy and numeracy. The fearless advocacy of equality and diversity and opposition to bigotry and prejudice of her early days as an adviser was continued in her role of commissioner for the Commission for Racial Equality, a non-departmental public body that aimed to combat racial discrimination and promote racial equality.<br>
<br>A keen follower of jazz, Adams played the clarinet and saxophone and retained a love of nineteenth-century industrial history along with swimming and travelling. Fearless and forthright, she fought against cancer privately for several years and finally lost her battle on 11 January 2007, a month after retiring as chief executive of the General Teaching Council. Her dedication to the teaching profession was recognized in small part through the council's sponsorship of the Carol Adams memorial award for excellence in professional development, equalities and diversity. She was survived by her children.<br>
