<span class="headword">Bakewell,  Thomas</span>  (1761&#150;1835), <span class="occ">mad-doctor and poet</span>, was born on 1 June 1761 at Kingstone, near Uttoxeter, in Staffordshire. He was raised by his maternal grandfather, John Chadwick, who kept a private mad-house at Grindon in the Peak District. Chadwick moved to Ashbourne in Derbyshire, where Bakewell received a limited education at the school of a Mr Richards. He was profoundly influenced by his experiences in his grandfather's mad-house. He received no formal medical training. After Chadwick's death, the management of the mad-house passed to his son John Chadwick, Thomas Bakewell's uncle. After assisting Chadwick for three years, Bakewell was apprenticed in 1774 as a tape weaver. He progressed eventually to become foreman over 300 men.<br>
<br>Bakewell resumed work with the insane about 1793, taking over the house from his dying uncle. Business difficulties led him to emigrate to North America two or three years later. He returned about 1802 and set up practice as a mad-doctor in the Staffordshire town of Cheadle. In 1805, Bakewell published <span class="italic">The Domestic Guide in Cases of Insanity</span>. This provided practical advice to people managing insane relatives at home. He considered mental illness to emanate from a diseased state of the brain. Social factors, like alcohol abuse, religious excess, or relationship difficulties might be precipitants which acted on the physical predisposition. Bakewell's approach to the management of patients emphasized humanity along with the imposition of firm authority. Treatment comprised methods in general usage, including warm and cold bathing and emetic and purgative medicines. The book achieved some critical approval and enhanced Bakewell's local reputation.<br>
<br>Bakewell opened his own private mad-house in 1808 at Spring Vale, near Stone, in Staffordshire. His intention was to put into practice the system of management and treatment learned from his relatives. In its early years Spring Vale was not commercially successful. Bakewell attributed this to his ability to cure patients; admissions were not frequent enough to replace discharges. His financial difficulties were partly alleviated by his third marriage, to Sarah Glover, who both invested money and took on the role of matron. By 1820 Spring Vale was flourishing, and within a few years was catering for up to forty patients. The treatment methods there embodied what Bakewell liked to call his &#145;system of cure&#146;. This comprised a regime of fresh air, vigorous exercise, and a nourishing diet, supplemented by active medical intervention which centred around achieving efficient digestive and bowel action. &#145;Moral treatment&#146; was also employed, concentrating on the promotion of rational and sensible behaviour. Bakewell sought to foster a supportive milieu that resembled a large family, with recreational activities, occupation, and religious observance, intended to divert thoughts away from the irrational. He claimed a cure rate of nine out of ten patients referred at an early stage of their disorder.<br>
<br>Bakewell became an active campaigner for his principles of treatment. He was galvanized by the passage of the <span class="roman">County Asylums Act</span> 1808, which encouraged county justices to provide asylums for pauper lunatics. His conviction was that large public asylums would become &#145;mighty prisons&#146;, in which confinement would take precedence over curative treatment. He lobbied leading politicians and was called as a witness before the select committee on mad-houses in 1815. After his appearance in 1815, Bakewell published <span class="italic">A Letter to the Select Committee on Madhouses</span>, in which he developed his argument against public asylums and detailed his alternative treatment methods. There were two other publications: in 1807 he had published <span class="italic">The Moorland Bard</span>, a book of poetry; in 1820 he issued <span class="italic">Remarks on a Publication by James Loch</span>, a strident polemic against the highland clearances, and in particular the part played in them by the marquess of Stafford, against whom Bakewell had a personal grievance resulting from a land dispute. Between 1815 and 1830, while building up his business at Spring Vale, Bakewell continued to campaign for a better public understanding of the needs of the insane. He delivered lectures in towns around the midlands and north. He became a frequent contributor to literary journals, first the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span> and then the <span class="italic">Imperial Magazine</span>. In his articles he outlined the origins and causes of mental disorder and expanded his ideas on treatment. Many columns were devoted to his critique of public asylums, and his perception of their inevitable therapeutic failure. He called for a nationally regulated system in which the lunatic would be regarded as the &#145;child of the state&#146; and a series of small curative asylums would be built around the country. Through his writings Bakewell attained some celebrity as a prototype popular psychiatrist.<br>
<br>Bakewell led a fairly colourful life. He married three times and produced twenty-four children, nine with his first wife, four with his second, and eleven with his third, Sarah. He became a well-known local character in Staffordshire, contributing on a range of issues, political, social, agricultural, and industrial, to the county press. He died on 6 September 1835 at Spring Vale, and was buried in St Michael's Church, Stone. After his death, the asylum at Spring Vale was taken over by his wife together with his son, Samuel Bakewell; it was subsequently relocated a few miles away at Oulton, and later moved to Church Stretton, Shropshire.<br>
