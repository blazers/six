<span class="headword">Hickson,  William Edward</span>  (1803&#150;1870), <span class="occ">author and educationist</span>, was born in Westminster, London, on 7 January 1803, the son of William Hickson and his wife, Matilda, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Underhill. His father became a wealthy boot and shoe manufacturer with a wholesale business at 20 West Smithfield, London. Between 1806 and 1812 the business moved to Northampton, where the family were active in the Baptist Sunday school movement. Hickson's account of his own youthful years recorded that he was &#145;a pupil of Joseph Lancaster; a Sunday School teacher; a <span class="roman">Bible</span> Christian &hellip; an enthusiastic promoter of Co-operative Associations. Editor in 1826 of the first Co-operative Magazine published in this country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Tracts for Inquirers</span>, No. 1). However, no details of his formal schooling have yet been found, though he was much influenced by his grandfather (another William) who died in 1822. The reference to Lancaster probably only concerns a lecture given in the Hickson home in 1810. As eldest son Hickson entered the family business, but he also attended meetings of the Aldersgate Street Literary and Scientific Society, and formed friendships with other young London radicals, including John Stuart Mill. On 15 September 1830 he married Jane Brown (<i>d</i>. January 1871); they had no children.<br>
<br>A pioneer of musical education, Hickson opposed John Hullah and his &#145;fixed doh&#146; method of teaching sight singing, and advocated instead beginning with melodies themselves. <span class="italic">The Singing Master</span> (1836) contained instructions for teaching singing both for schools and for families; a lecture delivered on 29 May 1838 before members of the Sunday School Union on the use of singing as part of the moral discipline of schools was published later that year. <span class="italic">Part Singing, or, Vocal Harmony for Choral Societies and Home Circles</span> appeared in 1842, <span class="italic">A Musical Gift from an Old Friend</span> in 1859.<br>
<br>Hickson served on the royal commission appointed in 1837 to inquire into the condition of the unemployed handloom weavers, and in 1840 wrote a separate report which advocated the repeal of the corn laws and the promotion of national education. In 1849 he produced a substantial pamphlet which sought to refute the population theories of Thomas Malthus. He argued not only that the valley of the Mississippi could provide sufficient corn and cotton to feed and clothe the whole population of Europe, but also that moral and physical problems could be overcome by developing human intelligence.<br>
<br>Hickson was a leading member of the Central Society of Education, and of its committee of management. In 1837 the society published, anonymously, his <span class="italic">Schools for the Industrious Classes</span>, which advocated a central board for education, model and normal schools for training teachers, and the separation of religious and secular instruction. In 1839 he undertook a tour in Belgium, Holland, and north Germany to study their national school systems, and in the following year his report on the tour was published in pamphlet form under the title <span class="italic">Dutch and German Schools</span>.<br>
<br>In 1840 Hickson gave up his business career and purchased the radical quarterly, <span class="italic">The Westminster Review</span>, which he also edited, writing many of the articles himself. Educational reform took pride of place, but other prominent concerns included child labour, the repeal of the corn laws, the condition of women, and municipal, legal, and medical malpractice. After 1846, when the title was changed to <span class="italic">The Westminster and Foreign Quarterly Review</span>, Hickson's crusading tone was moderated, and in 1851 he sold the <span class="italic">Review</span> to John Chapman for &pound;300.<br>
<br>Although in his later years Hickson (who had in 1836 been a founder member of the Reform Club) remained interested in reform questions, as evidenced by his <span class="italic">Tracts for Inquirers</span>, published in 1867, he also became concerned with metaphysical issues. He suffered from asthma for many years and died at his home, Manor House, Fairseat, Stansted, Kent, on 22 March 1870.<br>
