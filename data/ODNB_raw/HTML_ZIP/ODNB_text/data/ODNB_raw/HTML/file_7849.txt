</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Douce,  Francis</span>  (1757&#150;1834), <span class="occ">antiquary and collector</span>, was born on 13 July 1757 in London, the fourth and last child of Francis Douce (<i>d</i>. 1799), attorney, of the six clerks' office, and his wife, Ellen Tapley (<i>d</i>. 1799). His relationship with his father was not affectionate: &#145;my grandfather was a domestic despot, and tyrannized over my father, who thought proper to retaliate upon me&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 212); that with his mother was very sympathetic. From his earliest years she fostered his curiosity about books and antiquities and his love of music, interests which were to predominate in his adult life.<br>
<br>Douce was first sent to a school at Richmond but he was suddenly removed (apparently lest he should outshine his elder brother Thomas) to<blockquote>a French academy, kept by a pompous and ignorant Life-guardsman, with a view to his learning merchants' accounts, which were his aversion, and he made no other acquirement there than a little French; the second master, a Scotchman, knowing less Latin than himself, and no Greek. (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 213)</blockquote>He wanted to go to university but was prevented, he believed, by the machinations of the same brother. He worked for a while under his father and on 13 January 1779 entered Gray's Inn and was admitted an attorney of the king's bench. In that same year he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and in 1781 became a reader at the British Museum.<br>
<br>On 2 November 1791 Douce married Isabella Maria Price, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Corry (1754/5&#150;1830), widow of the Revd Henry Price of Bellevue, Ireland; they moved to 13 Upper Gower Street. His marriage, which was childless,<blockquote>did not increase his happiness, though on his part it was a match of affection; some peculiarities of disposition in the partner of his choice occasionally embittered his life, and there were circumstances connected with his union which had a baneful influence upon his peace even to the close of his life. (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 213)</blockquote>Isabella died at the end of July 1830, aged seventy-five; at her burial in St Pancras churchyard no one supplied the clerk with her Christian name.<br>
<br>In 1799 Douce's parents died. The disparity between his brother Thomas's legacy from their father's estate and his own he ascribed to &#145;the misrepresentations of my brother, who used to say that it was of no use to leave me money, for I should waste it in books&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 213). In fact, Douce's inheritance was sufficient to enable him to amass extraordinary collections of books and manuscripts, coins, medals, prints and drawings, and miscellaneous antiquities. His second attempt at a professional life began in 1807, when he joined the department of manuscripts at the British Museum; he succeeded Robert Nares as keeper later that same year, and moved into a museum residence. He worked on the catalogues of the Lansdowne and Harleian collections, using his extensive knowledge to good effect, and learning much in turn. However, he was too old and independent to cope with the institutional regime, and submitted his resignation in April 1811 on the grounds of ill health. His own notes on the business record fourteen reasons for his decision, ranging from his damp apartments to the &#145;fiddle faddle requisition of incessant reports&#146; by the officers of the museum  (Munby, 39). Great efforts were made to change his mind, but he was adamant, and returned to the life of a private collector and scholar, pursuing his antiquarian researches amid a wide circle of friends and correspondents, both at home and on the continent.<br>
<br>The motive behind Douce's various collections was to illustrate the manners, customs, and beliefs (especially those of the common people) of all ages. It is this illustrative imperative, the desire to assemble material which pictured the activities of humanity down the centuries, preferably as contemporaneously as possible, which informs his collections and provides the matter for his two major publications. <span class="italic">Illustrations of Shakespeare, and of Ancient Manners</span> was published in two volumes in 1807; in it Douce endeavours to see the dramatist in his social, cultural, and historical setting, and by so doing to throw new light on the plays in particular and on Elizabethan and Jacobean customs and literature in general. Its critical reception was mostly favourable, but a vituperative review by Jeffrey in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> (prompted by a feud against the book's publisher, Longman) hurt Douce deeply and put him off publishing for many years. It was not until 1833 that his other major work, <span class="italic">The dance of death exhibited in elegant engravings on wood, with a dissertation on the several representations of that subject</span>, appeared. He had first published on the dance of death in 1794, anonymously; during the four intervening decades he had amassed materials on, and devoted much research to, the subject, all of which was distilled in this illustrated study. In addition to several contributions to <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> and an anonymous pamphlet attacking government economic policy, Douce collaborated with George Spencer on <span class="italic">Nymphaea lotus</span> (1804), helped Walter Scott with his edition of <span class="italic">Sir Tristrem</span> (1804), anonymously edited and augmented Joseph Ritson's <span class="italic">Gammer Gurton's Garland</span> (1810), wrote the introduction to John Thomas Smith's <span class="italic">Vagabondiana</span> (1817), and provided much material for Richard Price's edition of Thomas Warton's <span class="italic">The History of English Poetry</span> (1824).<br>
<br>Douce was a difficult man but, once won over, extremely generous with his knowledge, books, and affection. He was &#145;a perfect gentleman of the old school; a little reserved on first acquaintance; but when this was passed, easy, affable, and kind&#146;, observed the obituarist in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 215), adding &#145;his temperament was constitutionally irritable&#146;  (ibid., 216). One of Barry's portraits of 1803 shows a striking, rather severe-looking man. The obituarist in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> describes him in old age &#145;wearing a little flaxen wig, an old-fashioned, square-cut coat &hellip; he was short and stout, somewhat near-sighted&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 257), much as in the pencil portrait of him aged seventy-three, by S. C. Smith.<br>
<br>After leaving the British Museum Douce moved to 36 Charlotte Street; in 1820 he moved to 20 Berners Street, and the following year to 34 Kensington Square. A dramatic change in his fortunes took place in 1823, when his friend Joseph Nollekens, the sculptor, died. His will became the subject of much legal wrangling and it was not until 1827 that Douce, a residuary legatee, received about &pound;50,000, enabling him thenceforth to augment his collections on a lavish scale. His last move had been in 1825, when he returned to Upper Gower Street, to no. 15.<br>
<br>In July 1830 Douce and his old friend Isaac D'Israeli visited Oxford. Frederic Madden of the British Museum had given them a letter of introduction to Bodley's librarian, Bulkeley Bandinel, who enthusiastically took them round and had them to dine with him. Douce was much taken by the library's tradition of preserving the identity of its named collections. &#145;At this moment&#146;, records D'Israeli, &#145;Douce must have decided on the locality where his precious collection was to find a perpetual abode&#146;  (D'Israeli, 3.264). Douce died &#145;after an illness of but two or three weeks&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 257) on 30 March 1834 at his home, 15 Upper Gower Street, and was buried in St Pancras churchyard on 7 April. The Bodleian received his books (18,000), manuscripts (420), prints (27,000 fine, 17,000 other), drawings (1500), coins, and medals. The drawings and most of the prints were transferred to the Ashmolean in 1863, the non-fine prints being returned in 1915; the coins and medals were transferred to the same museum in 1920. Douce bequeathed his antiquities to Sir Samuel Meyrick, whose collection was dispersed in the 1870s, and his private papers to the British Museum, not to be looked at until 1900 (they were given to the Bodleian in 1930). His residuary legatees, S. W. Singer and the Revd Edward Goddard, shared an estimated &pound;50,000.<br>
