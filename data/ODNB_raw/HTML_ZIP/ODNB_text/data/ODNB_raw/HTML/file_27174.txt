<span class="headword">Thesiger,  Alfred Henry</span>  (1838&#150;1880), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 15 July 1838, the fourth and youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27176/', "Frederick Thesiger, first Baron Chelmsford (1794&#150;1878)")</script>, the lord chancellor, and his wife, Anna Maria (<i>d</i>. 1875), youngest daughter of William Tinling of Southampton. His brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36464/', "Frederic Augustus Thesiger, second Baron Chelmsford (1827&#150;1905)")</script>. He was educated at Eton College before matriculating on 15 May 1856 at Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1860 and MA in 1861. Both at school and at college he excelled at cricket and rowing, while battling against ill health. He became a student of the Inner Temple and was called to the bar in 1862. On 31 December 1862 he married Henrietta, the second daughter of the Hon. George Handcock, fourth son of the second earl of Castlemaine; they had no children.<br>
<br>Thesiger joined the home circuit, and quickly built up a large London practice. For a time he was postman of the court of exchequer, and on 3 July 1873 he became a queen's counsel. His later practice lay chiefly in commercial and compensation cases. In January 1874 he was elected a bencher of his inn, and on 10 September 1877 attorney-general to the prince of Wales. In 1876 he was a member of the commission on the fugitive slave circular, and in 1877, on the recommendation of Lord Cairns and to public surprise, he was appointed to succeed Sir Richard Paul Amphlett as a lord justice of the Court of Appeal, at the age of thirty-nine. He was duly sworn of the privy council. During his brief time on the bench he showed industry and judicial ability, and was remembered for his slight and youthful appearance. He died at 5 South Eaton Place, Eaton Square, London of blood poisoning on 20 October 1880 and was buried in Brompton cemetery. He was survived by his wife.<br>
