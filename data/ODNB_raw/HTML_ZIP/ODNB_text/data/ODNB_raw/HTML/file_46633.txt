<span class="headword">Bird, Sir  Alfred Frederick</span>, first baronet  (1849&#150;1922), <span class="occ">food manufacturer</span>, was born in Birmingham, on 27 July 1849, the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38977/', "Alfred Bird, FCS (bap. 1811, d. 1878)")</script>, and his wife, Elizabeth Lavinia Ragg, a martyr to dyspepsia. To overcome his wife's allergies to yeast products and to eggs, Alfred senior, an experimental chemist and analyst, had invented a baking powder and a cornflour-based custard powder, and had begun making these.<br>
<br>While at King Edward's School, Birmingham, Bird planned to read for the bar, but on leaving school in 1867 he entered his father's business, and helped to launch Bird's blancmange powder, in fourteen flavours. In 1875 he married Eleanor Frances, eldest daughter of Robert Lloyd Evans, a tobacconist, of Handsworth. They had four sons and two daughters. Three years later Alfred senior died, and Bird ran the firm jointly with his father's younger brother, who not long afterwards retired and died.<br>
<br>As sole owner, Bird at once planned a modern factory, with up-to-date machinery, to replace the outdated premises. After demand began to soar he opened an even larger factory on a new site in 1886; this burnt down a year later, and he had a specially designed works erected. He then diversified into other convenience foods, such as an egg substitute in 1890, jelly crystals in 1895, and tablet jellies a few years later. Although he continued to make some toiletries and chemist's products, they were not compatible with foodstuffs, and were discontinued after 1905.<br>
<br>To market his rapidly increasing output, as early as 1880 Bird was using pictorial advertisements, the speciality of his London agent, T. B. Browne, who gave Bird's products an equally colourful image to those of his other clients, Cadburys and Pears. Instead of the previous costly system of direct contact with retailers, Bird appointed a network of wholesale agents throughout Britain, who worked with the salesmen he hired. The sales force developed into one of the most effective in the field of groceries.<br>
<br>In 1900 Bird and two of his four sons, Robert and Geoffrey, registered Alfred Bird &amp; Sons Ltd, with authorized capital of &pound;300,000, their prospectus being dismissed by <span class="italic">The Statist</span> (23 June 1900) as &#145;slipshod&#146;. They set up a London office and warehouse for the metropolitan trade. Bird remained chairman and managing director until his retirement in 1905. He then stood as a Conservative for Wednesbury in the 1906 general election, but lost rather badly. Two years later he became JP for the county of Warwickshire. Elected to Wolverhampton West in January 1910, he held the seat until he died. He was not regarded as a great debater, and never rose higher than parliamentary private secretary to the under-secretary of state for the colonies in the First World War.<br>
<br>While appearing genial to outsiders, Bird was a strict father and employer, requiring a high level of dedication in exchange for better wages and working conditions than elsewhere in Birmingham. He was exceptionally keen on physical fitness. As a youth he had been a good athlete, and was given a penny-farthing bicycle on his nineteenth birthday; later, he broke the record for tricycling from Land's End to John o' Groats. A pioneer motorist, he became a founder member of the Royal Automobile Club in 1897. Bird was also an ardent mountaineer and member of the Alpine Club. He was a connoisseur of fine art, and his home, Tudor Grange, Solihull, contained a number of important paintings, some of which he gave to the houses of parliament.<br>
<br>Bird was made a deputy lieutenant of Warwickshire in 1916, at a time when he was generously helping discharged former servicemen. Knighted in 1920, he was raised to a baronetcy in the new year honours list of 1922. A month later, he was knocked down by a car, while crossing Piccadilly, and died shortly afterwards, on 7 February 1922, in St George's Hospital, Knightsbridge, London. He was buried on 12 February.<br>
