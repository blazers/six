<span class="headword">Benson,  Henry Alexander</span>, Baron Benson  (1909&#150;1995), <span class="occ">accountant</span>, was born in Johannesburg on 2 August 1909, the son of Alexander Stanley Benson, solicitor, and his wife, Florence Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cooper. He was educated at St John's College preparatory school in Johannesburg before being moved (Benson believes because of a shortage of cash for school fees) to Parktown high school. The strongest influences on his early life seem to have been his preparatory school teacher, Miss Thomas, a firm disciplinarian who drummed into the young Henry the need always to attain the highest possible standard, and his mother, who seems to have shared similar priorities. The lasting contribution of his father, a warm but at times irascible character, arose from a passionate belief in the proper use and elocution of the English language.<br>
<br>Benson's mother was the daughter of Francis Cooper who joined his two elder brothers as a partner in Cooper Brothers &amp; Co. about 1871 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47718/', "Cooper family")</script>]. She brought her son to England when he was fourteen years old for a family visit. With time on their hands, they visited the office of Cooper Brothers for what turned out to be a rather sticky meeting, with nobody having much to say. In desperation, the senior partner, his mother's cousin (son of the youngest of the four initial Cooper brothers) Stuart Cooper, said &#145;Well, Florence, if you want this lad to come here when he has finished school, we will take him.&#146; Florence thought this a capital idea and Henry commenced articles in London a couple of months after his seventeenth birthday in October 1926. The usual premium of 500 guineas was waived because of the family connection and his uncle, Sir Francis D'Arcy Cooper, made Henry an allowance of &pound;250 a year during his training. Benson passed eleventh in the intermediate examination and fourth (out of 1088 candidates) in the final examination of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), and qualified as a chartered accountant in 1932. Continuing nepotism, coupled with fierce ambition and ability, produced an annual salary of &pound;250 (&pound;25 more than was paid to other newly qualified staff) and accelerated promotion to salaried partner two years later at the age of twenty-five, on &pound;1000 a year.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of war, Benson obtained a commission as second lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards through the good offices of his uncle and Viscount Trenchard. The guards' rigid, unswerving discipline, attention to detail, and determination that anything undertaken should be as good as human endeavour could make it, made an impression on Benson which remained with him throughout his life. One of his early duties was to patrol the terrace on the side of Windsor Castle where the two princesses slept. In 1942 he was promoted to major and moved to the Special Operations Executive, a branch of the services engaged in all kinds of undercover work. He was promoted to colonel in 1944 and, a year earlier, plucked temporarily from his battalion and seconded to the Ministry of Supply to advise on the reorganization of the accounts of the Royal Ordnance factories. These were found to be in a chaotic state and Benson accepted the appointment of director of factories (accounts) giving him executive authority over a staff of about 10,000. In a successful endeavour to inculcate the need for order and discipline, Benson toured the factories in battledress tapping the floor with his swagger stick for emphasis or using it to point out anything he did not like. He admits to being tough with staff; anyone who did not pull his weight was replaced by some means or another, and everyone who seemed capable of doing the job and complying strictly with the manuals was promoted.<br>
<br>Leaving the army as an acting brigadier, Benson returned to Coopers on 1 January 1946 full of enthusiasm to expand the firm rapidly, partly through the application of military-type disciplines. This determination was shared by another relatively young partner, Sydney John Pears, but not the still senior partner, Stuart Cooper. Following the resignation of Francis D'Arcy Cooper as senior partner in 1923 to become vice-chairman (later chairman) of Lever Brothers, Coopers had gone through a fairly quiet period. Stuart Cooper's health was patchy and, in Benson's and Pears's estimation, he failed to put into the firm the required work and energy. After some difficult meetings in 1946, Stuart Cooper agreed to retire. Pears and Benson immediately undertook a radical overhaul of the organizational framework, with separate departments established to deal with audit, tax, executorship work, liquidation and receivership, registration and share-transfer work, costing and organization, secretarial work, and investigations. Another key initiative was for Benson, drawing on his experience in the ordnance factories, to write an audit manual setting out precisely the procedures for all audit work carried out for clients, for use within the firm.<br>
<br>There then began a period of rapid growth which gave rise to tinges of jealousy among some of Coopers' more staid competitors. Benson later admitted that the firm was partly to blame, being insufficiently sensitive to the attitude of colleagues within the profession. Hostility was to some extent ameliorated by the decision of Coopers to share with the rest of the profession their experience in the development of improved auditing standards through the publication, in 1966, of <span class="italic">Cooper's Manual of Auditing</span>, drawn from the original audit manual Benson had written for internal use. This became the standard work used by students and practitioners in the UK and overseas. Another major step in the early 1960s, again under the direction of Benson and Pears, which significantly enhanced the growth of the firm, was the establishment of a management consultancy arm, Coopers being the first of the major accounting firms to branch out into this field. The UK firm grew from 173 staff in 1945 to 2207 staff when Benson retired thirty years later. The numbers in the international firm rose from 239 to 18,386 over the same period, and offices worldwide increased more than forty-fold from 8 to 332. A key trigger for international growth was a chance telephone call from the senior partner of Lybrand, Ross Brothers and Montgomery, in 1956. It seems that this American firm was keen to divest itself of its London and Paris offices, thereby gifting Coopers $40,000 worth of work. While more than pleased to take on these activities, Benson and Pears pressed Lybrand for, and achieved agreement to, the establishment of an international network of firms practising under a common agreement and to common standards. The international firm of Coopers and Lybrand was launched on 1 January 1957 and, from 1973, all firms within its network practised worldwide under this new label until the merger with Price Waterhouse in 1998.<br>
<br>Benson also became heavily involved in running the accountancy profession following election to the ICAEW council in 1956. He was the third member of his family to hold the office of president in 1966, following in the shoes of great-uncles <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46842/', "Arthur Cooper")</script> (1883&#150;4) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46843/', "Ernest Cooper")</script> (1899&#150;1901) [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47718/', "Cooper family")</script>]. A presidential speech implored members of the Chartered Accountants' Students Society &#145;to remember that we have the privilege of belonging to a private organisation which serves the public interest&#146;. Probably his most significant contribution as president was in the creation of the Accountants' International Study Group&#151;a collaboration between the ICAEW, the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants&#151;with the remit to study major accounting problems and issue an agreed statement upon each of them. This initiative was a further manifestation of his developing belief of the value of uniformity in accounting matters, growing out of his wartime experiences in the ordnance factories and in recognition of the increasingly international nature of large accounting firms. Leading from this, as the need for more rigorous, worldwide accounting standards and procedures became accepted, Benson was the driving force in the formation of the International Accounting Standards Committee in 1973. As chairman from 1973 to 1976, he oversaw the issuing of standards designed to improve the quality and comparability of corporate disclosures through harmonizing financial reporting requirements throughout the world.<br>
<br>Following the Second World War, Coopers made the policy decision that its senior partners should set aside a part of their time for government work. It is unlikely that the firm was behaving in a purely altruistic manner, and there is no doubt that Cooper Brothers &amp; Co. and its partners obtained significant financial benefits both directly in the form of government engagements and indirectly in the high public profile that they enjoyed. Benson's appointments to a bewildering variety of committees and public bodies are summarized in six pages of an appendix to his autobiography, <span class="italic">Accounting for Life</span>. His achievements caused the obituary correspondent to <span class="italic">The Times</span> to conclude that &#145;Few men outside Whitehall can have had more influence on public affairs in postwar Britain&#146;. Immediately after the war he was invited to advise the new Labour government on housing production while, in 1953, he was made deputy chairman of the Fleck committee on the organization of the National Coal Board, later becoming deputy chairman of the NCB. Many other appointments quickly followed, including studies of Northern Ireland's railways, the New Zealand fruit trade, and the transformation of coal into oil, chemicals, and gas (the Wilson committee). In 1963 he was invited by the chancellor of the exchequer to examine the impact of tax on companies' turnover, in effect the precursor to the introduction of VAT. Immediately following his retirement from Coopers, he was invited by his friend Gordon Richardson, the governor of the Bank of England, to serve as his industrial adviser (1975&#150;83). Between 1976 and 1979, Benson chaired the royal commission on legal services, whose mammoth report included the recommendations that individual solicitors or firms should be permitted a restricted right to advertise, and that the Law Society should be responsible for taking action in cases of sub-standard professional work. From 1974 to 1979 he also served as a director of the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation.<br>
<br>Benson was appointed CBE in 1946 in recognition of his work at the Ministry of Supply, with his further government service producing a knighthood in 1964, appointment as GBE in 1971, and a life peerage in the 1981 new year's honours list. He subsequently sat in the House of Lords as a cross-bencher, speaking frequently on industrial issues and on the incidence of fraud in the European Union. In 1983 he was elected an honorary master of the bench at Inner Temple. In the following year he was made an honorary freeman of the Worshipful Company of the Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. In 1985 he was elected to the Accounting Hall of Fame by Ohio State University, USA, and in 1986 he was made a freeman of the City of London.<br>
<br>Benson appears to have had a miserable time when, &#145;raw and unsophisticated, [he] first came to wet and foggy London from warm and sunny South Africa&#146;. That apart, his entire life was happy, exciting, and enjoyed to the full. His explanation for his enjoyment as well as his success was a willingness to work hard. Indeed, he became restive and uncomfortable when not fully occupied. His history of the firm (1954) noted that the original Cooper brothers were not easy taskmasters; he was no different. The level of commitment which he expected at the Ministry of Supply was carried over into his professional life. He once observed that, to find out what a man could do, you put him under strain. His address to the Chartered Accountants' Students Society in 1966 stressed, in addition to hard work, the virtues of single-mindedness, independence, humility, loyalty, and trustworthiness. His stern demeanour cloaked both a keen sense of humour and a deeply seated concern for humanity. The latter was well illustrated at the end of the Second World War when he was sent to Cairo by the Special Operations Executive in order to close down force 133, which controlled the under-cover and resistance operations in Greece and the Balkans. Concerned about the families of Greek patriots who had died helping force 133, Benson successfully negotiated a fund of &pound;200,000 from the Treasury, in those days a substantial amount of money, to ease their burden.<br>
<br>The limited amount of time Benson devoted to recreation was also exploited to the full. His hobbies were gardening, tennis, sailing, golf, and shooting, inheriting from Sir Francis D'Arcy Cooper the shooting rights of the Drovers estate near Chichester, Sussex. He was also sufficiently interested in racing to work closely with the sixteenth duke of Norfolk, a personal friend, to put up a new stand at Ascot in the 1960s, thereafter becoming a member of the Jockey Club.<br>
<br>Benson married Anne Virginia, daughter of Charles Macleod, a tea planter, on 2 September 1939. They had three children: Peter (<i>b</i>. 1940) and twins Michael and Phyllida (<i>b</i>. 1943). In the family tradition, Peter Benson became a partner in Coopers and Lybrand in 1971. Benson's wife, Ginny, accompanied her husband on many of his trips and described herself, in a paper written at the time of Henry's retirement, as his &#145;bag and baggage&#146;; also &#145;as a Cooper's wife and latterly a C &amp; L wife&#146;. This lifestyle did not come as a surprise; her future husband's proposal for marriage, offered in a taxi cab bound for King's Cross Station, was accompanied by a stated list of priorities among which the firm came first. She seemed entirely comfortable with this arrangement, which did not preclude the existence of strong family ties, as reflected in the continuance of family holidays with their children, after they had grown up, and their grandchildren. Lord Benson died on 5 March 1995 at Chichester in Sussex; he was survived by his wife and three children.<br>
