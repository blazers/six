<span class="headword">Holme <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Punchard]</span>,  (Edith) Constance</span>  (1880&#150;1955), <span class="occ">novelist and short-story writer</span>, was born on 7 October 1880 at Owlet Ash, Milnthorpe, Westmorland, the youngest of the fourteen children of John Holme (1829&#150;1905), land agent and, after his retirement in 1880, local magistrate and deputy lord lieutenant of Westmorland, and his wife, Elizabeth Cartmel (1836&#150;1931), whose parents owned land in nearby Farleton. Constance Holme's parents were both of long-established northern stock. John Holme represented the third generation of a family branch which had settled in Milnthorpe in the late eighteenth century and had acted since then as land agents for the nearby Dallam Tower estate. Both her parents were impressively handsome and had a local reputation for stand-offishness, John Holme being an intimidating figure to the village children. Constance Holme inherited some of their looks and some of their remoteness: a photograph taken when she was eighteen shows a clear-eyed, long-nosed, sensitive-lipped face narrowing to a dimpled, rather weak chin. She loved and admired both her parents and in middle life made periodic visits to Somerset House to trace her ancestry.<br>
<br>Constance Holme's formal education, of the conventional &#145;young lady&#146; variety, began about 1888. She was first a weekly boarder at a small Methodist school, Oakfield Place, in nearby Arnside. From about 1893 she attended Buckingham House, a school in Birkenhead, finishing her education at Cedar Lodge, Blackheath, London, a school run on strict lines and Church of England principles. Her few years of education in the south constituted the longest period Constance Holme was absent from the estuary and hill landscape she loved, which provided the inspiration and setting for all her work. She achieved national publication first with a poem in the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span> (5 October 1907), but for some years her larger-scale successes were entirely local: two full-length novels, <span class="italic">Staggie Three</span> (1905) and <span class="italic">Hugh of Hughsdale</span> (1906), serialized in the <span class="italic">Kendal Mercury</span> between 1909 and 1911; and a dialect play, <span class="italic">Duck Egg Dick</span>, performed in Kendal before a capacity audience in 1912. Her deepest wish was to attain success as a playwright, but this largely eluded her: only two of the many plays she wrote achieved performance in London, <span class="italic">The Home of Vision</span> in 1919 and <span class="italic">I Want</span> in 1931. The poetry she wrote throughout her life, and occasionally published in <span class="italic">Country Life</span>, is skilful but minor.<br>
<br>Constance Holme aroused metropolitan critical interest when she was almost thirty-three with her novel <span class="italic">Crump Folk Going Home</span> (1913). This and her next two novels, <span class="italic">The Lonely Plough</span> (1914) and <span class="italic">The Old Road from Spain</span> (1916), were set in the immediate Milnthorpe area and drew their material from the upper- and middle-class worlds of landowning and land agency which she knew intimately and described with both realistic accuracy and poetic feeling. <span class="italic">The Lonely Plough</span>, its dramatic climax drawn from the great River Kent flood of 1907, established her national reputation as a regional novelist of uncommon force and distinction, and became the book most identified with her name.<br>
<br>Constance Holme's ties with the world into which she had been born were strengthened by her marriage to Frederick Burt Punchard (1867&#150;1946) of Kearstwick, Westmorland. The wedding, a grandly feudal local occasion, largely attended, took place at St Peter's, Heversham, on 8 February 1916. Like John Holme, Frederick Punchard was a land agent: educated at Sedbergh School, he had succeeded his father in 1906 as agent at Underley Hall, the estate outside Kirkby Lonsdale of Lord Henry Bentinck. Marriage brought Constance Holme an indulgent if far from handsome husband thirteen years older than herself, and a visit in 1917 to Garsington Manor: Lady Ottoline Morrell, the literary hostess who lived there, was Lord Henry Bentinck's sister, and Constance Holme was by now a minor literary lion. Soon after her marriage, she settled at The Gables, Kirkby Lonsdale, where she spent the next twenty years. Though only 10 miles from Milnthorpe, she was frequently homesick.<br>
<br>Retaining her maiden name as author, Constance Holme published five more novels while living at Kirkby Lonsdale: <span class="italic">Beautiful End</span> (1918); <span class="italic">The Splendid Fairing</span> (1919), for which she was awarded the Femina Vie Heureuse prize (later won by Mary Webb and Virginia Woolf) in May 1921; <span class="italic">The Trumpet in the Dust</span> (1921), arguably her finest work; <span class="italic">The Things which Belong</span> (1925); and <span class="italic">He-who-Came</span> (1930). All five novels differ from their predecessors in having a tighter, often single-day time scheme, and in concentrating on characters from a humbler social level. This shift of focus is accompanied by an increase in psychological intensity: the restricted, often disappointed lives with which Constance Holme chooses to deal are presented with a penetration, and an austere beauty, sometimes reminiscent of Hardy and Conrad, the latter of whom she admired passionately.<br>
<br>Constance Holme's novels were reviewed regularly, and with consistent respect, by <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, and the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>. This respect was shared by the publisher to Oxford University, Humphrey Milford, who not only reprinted all of them in the Oxford <span class="roman">World's Classics</span> series during the 1930s, but also took the unusual step of putting straight into the series, in 1937, Constance Holme's collection of short stories entitled <span class="italic">The Wisdom of the Simple</span>. This proved to be her last published book, although over the final decades of her life she almost succeeded in completing one more novel, <span class="italic">The Jasper Sea</span>, which had as its protagonist a village handyman and gravedigger.<br>
<br>When her husband retired from land agency in 1937, Constance Holme returned with him to Milnthorpe, to live again at Owlet Ash. Recurring ailments (nervous disorders of the stomach, sciatica, neuritis, tetany) made her later years difficult, as did her sense that the world was changing out of recognition, and for the worse. During the Second World War she became more reclusive; on 25 April 1946 her husband died of bronchopneumonia; and by the autumn of 1953 she was living, alone and much shrunk physically, in a single room of the Georgian house she could no longer afford to maintain. In February 1954 she moved to a small terraced house, 13 Orchard Road, Arnside. By a sad irony reminiscent of some of her novels, her eldest sister, Annie, whom she had hoped to be living next to, died at the age of ninety-two, just as she moved in. She herself died in the following year, on 17 June 1955, of cancer. The funeral, attended by fewer than twenty people, took place on 20 June 1955 at St Thomas's, Milnthorpe; she joined her husband in a grave just across the road from the family home she had had to sell. Structural alterations were already in progress.<br>
