<span class="headword">Lynch <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Fox]</span>,  Patricia Nora</span>  (<em>c.</em>1894&#150;1972), <span class="occ">children's writer and journalist</span>, was born in Cork on 4 June about 1894. (There is some uncertainty as to the year of her birth.) Her mother, Nora, had been reared by a story-teller from Bantry and Patricia grew up in an atmosphere of folklore and story-telling. The family lived in Sunday's Well and the Fair Hill areas of Cork city. Her father died when she was young and her mother moved with Patricia and her brother to London. She was educated in Ireland, England, and Bruges in Belgium.<br>
<br>Lynch noted in later life that &#145;I was brought up to think that the best thing I could ever do would be to die for &#147;the cause&#148;&#146;  (cutting from <span class="italic">Irish Press</span>, 1957, NL Ire., Fox&#150;Lynch MSS) and she remained an Irish nationalist throughout her life. In London she became a friend of Sylvia Pankhurst and was a supporter of the suffrage movement, and it was Pankhurst who sent Lynch to Dublin in the aftermath of the 1916 Easter rising to report on the event for the <span class="italic">Worker's Dreadnought</span>. She travelled alone to Dublin and wrote the first eyewitness account of the rising from an Irish viewpoint. Her piece in the <span class="italic">Worker's Dreadnought</span> was later reprinted as part of a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Rebel Ireland</span> published by the Workers' Socialist Federation.<br>
<br>On the 4 October 1922 Lynch married the journalist and writer Richard Michael Fox (1891&#150;1969). Fox had been born in Leeds and had been a conscientious objector during the First World War, spending three years in prison for his stance. The couple, who had no children, lived for a short time in Tottenham but soon moved to Dublin, where they resided in Glasnevin. In Ireland they became involved in the Irish labour and nationalist movements and were ardent theatregoers. They held regular get-togethers on Wednesdays at their home, attended by literary and other figures, and became friends with such people as Sean O'Casey, Peadar O'Donnell, Liam O'Flaherty and Maud Gonne MacBride. Fox, who became an Irish citizen, worked as a sub-editor for the <span class="italic">Irish Press</span> for a number of years and Lynch also worked for the same paper.<br>
<br>Lynch's first children's book, <span class="italic">The Cobbler's Apprentice</span> (1933), won the prestigious Tailteann medal. She was a prolific author and published over fifty books and two hundred stories, many of which were translated into other languages. Her work appeared under her maiden name, and almost all of it was for children, although also appreciated by adults&#151;one example of her ability to cross audiences in this way can be seen in her account of her early years, <span class="italic">A Storyteller's Childhood</span> (1947), which reads very much like a fairy tale. Her stories generally are simple, mingling fact and fantasy, and containing elements of Irish folklore, such as fairies, leprechauns, and talking animals. They were illustrated by artists such as Sean Keating, Jack B. Yeats and George Altendorf. Among the most famous were <span class="italic">The Turf Cutter's Donkey</span> (1934), which was chosen as a Junior Book Club Selection, and <span class="italic">The Grey Goose of Kilnevin</span> (1939), which was selected by the Cardinal Hayes literature committee in America as one of the best one hundred books published there in 1941. Other honours included the Irish Women Writers' Club award for <span class="italic">Fiddler's Quest</span> (1941), and the Eugene Field Society of America certificate of service to literature. In 1967 Lynch was elected to the Irish Academy of Letters, and a number of her books were adapted for Radio Telefis &Eacute;ireann, the Irish national radio station.<br>
<br>Lynch and her husband were extremely close, and after his death in 1969, unable to manage alone, she lived with the family of Eugene Lambert, the puppeteer. Lynch died on 1 September 1972 in a nursing home in Monkstown, Dublin, and she was buried with her husband in Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin.<br>
