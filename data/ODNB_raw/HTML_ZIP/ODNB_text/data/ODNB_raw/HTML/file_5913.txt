<span class="headword">Collier,  Arthur</span>  (1680&#150;1732), <span class="occ">metaphysician</span>, was born on 12 October 1680 at the rectory, Langford Magna, Wiltshire, the third and eldest surviving son of Arthur Collier (<i>d</i>. 1697), the rector of Langford Magna, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Thomas and Joan Currey of Misleton, Somerset. The rectory of Langford Magna had been presented to Joseph Collier, Collier's great-grandfather, in 1608; he owned the advowson, and the benefice continued to be enjoyed by his descendants: it was held in trust by Francis Eyre between the death of Arthur Collier sen. in 1697 and the succession of Arthur Collier jun. in 1704. Collier's grandfather, Henry Collier, had been ejected from the living during the Commonwealth; two of his sons, Henry and Joseph, had taken part in Penruddocke's rising at Salisbury, and were transported into slavery in Jamaica for their pains. Henry Collier was restored to his living in 1660, dying in 1672, when it was inherited by his son, Arthur Collier sen. Collier attended school in Salisbury, and was entered at Pembroke College, Oxford, in June 1697, migrating thence to Balliol College in October 1698, along with his younger brother, William.<br>
<br>Their father having died on 10 December 1697, Arthur Collier inherited the living, and, having taken priest's orders, was instituted to it in 1704. He held it until his death in 1732, having previously sold the advowson for 1600 guineas to Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Arthur and William were deeply interested in metaphysics, and both read Descartes and Malebranche. By the age of twenty-three Arthur had come to believe that there was no such thing as an external world, a proposition he defended in a series of writings. He lived close to John Norris of Bemerton, whose <span class="italic">Theory of the Ideal World</span> (1701&#150;4) was praised by Collier; Norris was another English follower of Malebranche, and a defender of Platonist immaterialism. Collier reached his position independently of Bishop Berkeley; a manuscript version of his tract <span class="italic">Clavis universalis, or, A new inquiry after truth, being a demonstration of the non-existence or impossibility of an external world</span> (1713) dates from January 1708, a year before the appearance of Berkeley's <span class="italic">Theory of Vision</span>, and he claims to have waited &#145;ten years&#146; before publishing the work  (A. Collier, <span class="italic">Clavis universalis</span>, 1713, 1). Whatever the true relationship between their work, their similarities can largely be attributed to their common indebtedness to Malebranche. Collier's work was dry and scholastic, and it remained unpurchased and unread when Berkeley's more stylish work was beginning to be taken up. The <span class="italic">Clavis universalis</span> was later highly commended by both Sir James Mackintosh and Dugald Stewart, who thought him unduly neglected; a German translation was made by J. C. Eschenbach in 1756. The <span class="italic">Clavis</span> was reprinted in Samuel Parr's <span class="italic">Metaphysical Tracts by some English Philosophers of the Eighteenth Century</span> (1837). Collier corresponded about the work with Samuel Clarke, to whom he had sent a copy, in 1714. He remained unknown, however, though he took a keen interest in the controversies of the time and wrote letters to Daniel Waterland, Francis Hare, Benjamin Hoadly, and William Whiston. He was intimate with Bishop Burnet; he occasionally preached at Salisbury Cathedral. His sermons, most of which were prepared for his own parishioners, were unaffected by his metaphysical opinions.<br>
<br>Collier was an unorthodox high-churchman, and an opponent of occasional conformity; he opposed Henry Sacheverell, and acted as a mediator in the Bangorian controversy, about which he wrote in the Jacobite <span class="italic">Mist's Journal</span> in 1719. He was a mystic, believing that all things were comprehended through God, and his greatest interest lay in understanding the opening verse of <span class="roman">Genesis</span>; he was also inclined to Arianism, and was an Apollinarian on the subject of the incarnation. These questions are addressed in <span class="italic">A Specimen of True Philosophy &hellip; not Improper to be Bound up with the &#145;Clavis universalis&#146;</span> (1730), and in his very rare tract, <span class="italic">Logology: a treatise on the logos or word of God in seven sermons on St. John's gospel, chap. i. verses 1, 2, 3, and 14</span> (1732). Such speculations led him to correspond with William Whiston, whom he invited to Salisbury, but they left him some way from his neighbour, the Salisbury deist Thomas Chubb, whom he made it his business to oppose.<br>
<br>Collier married in 1707 Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1749), the daughter of Nicholas Johnson, paymaster of the army, and his wife, a sister of Sir Stephen Fox. Fox was an executor of Johnson's will and guardian of his children, in which capacity Collier brought an action against him in 1710: the case was heard in a chancery suit, the issue of which does not appear. Mrs Collier is said to have been extravagant, and he also lived beyond his means: hence the sale of the advowson of Langford Magna. He died at Langford Magna in 1732, and was buried on 9 September 1732 in Langford church. His brother William, who became rector of Baverstock in 1713, took a keen interest in metaphysics and horseracing, and also died in 1732. Arthur Collier's wife and four children survived him. One son, Arthur, a civilian, died in 1777; Charles became a colonel; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37302/', "Jane Collier")</script> was the author of <span class="italic">An Essay on the Art of Ingeniously Tormenting</span> (1753); <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74079/', "Margaret Collier")</script> accompanied Henry Fielding on his voyage to Lisbon. Collier's papers were rediscovered in a house in the close at Salisbury; many had been burnt earlier by servants. Many of these papers were published, along with a memoir, by Robert Benson, in 1837, at the behest of Dr Fowler of Salisbury, a pupil of Dugald Stewart.<br>
