<span class="headword">Bloet,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1123), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Lincoln</span>, was Norman by birth, a member of the baronial family of Ivry. Hugues, bishop of Bayeux, and Jean, archbishop of Rouen, were his kinsmen. A chaplain of William I, in September 1087 Bloet was dispatched to England with William Rufus, carrying a letter to Archbishop Lanfranc, instructing the latter to crown Rufus as king. He flourished in the new reign: he was appointed chancellor by 27 January 1091, and held that office until about February 1094, when he became bishop of Lincoln. He had been nominated as bishop in the previous year, but his consecration was delayed when Archbishop Thomas of York (<i>d</i>. 1100) claimed that Lindsey, the northern half of Lincoln diocese, belonged to his own province and diocese. The difficulty was resolved by Rufus, who granted to Thomas the abbeys of Selby and St Oswald, Gloucester, and persuaded Robert to pay a sum variously reported as &pound;3000 and &pound;5000 to the king himself, so as to secure Lincoln's liberties. Bloet remained close to the king for the rest of Rufus's reign; one of the &#145;justiciars of England&#146; recorded in 1096, he was probably a member of the council of regency left to govern England when the king went overseas in that year, and was present at the Whitsun court of 1099 when the new Westminster Hall housed its first royal feast.<br>
<br>Bloet remained at the centre of government for almost the whole of the rest of his life, serving Henry I as he had done William Rufus. In March 1101 he was one of the witnesses for the king in his treaty with Count Robert of Flanders, and in 1102 led the troops that besieged Tickhill, Yorkshire, held by the men of Henry's enemy, Robert de Bell&ecirc;me. In 1110 he was the first witness on the king's behalf to another treaty with Robert of Flanders, and in all witnessed 155 royal <i>acta</i> between 1100 and his death. In 1111 he was a member of the court sitting in the exchequer, and in 1119 was a justice in the <i>curia regis</i>. When the king went abroad, Bloet (who is only once, in 1114, reliably recorded as accompanying Henry I to Normandy) was one of the small group of administrators who stayed in England, wielding viceregal powers under the nominal direction of Queen Matilda or Prince William. He was probably also a shire justiciar in Lincolnshire, as well as exercising nationwide judicial authority as he had done in the previous reign; no doubt it was in the latter capacity that he acted as a judge at Brampton in 1116. William of Malmesbury understandably regarded him as second to none in his knowledge of secular business, though the chronicler was less impressed by Bloet's attention to ecclesiastical affairs.<br>
<br>In this William may have been somewhat unfair. Bloet found a new cathedral church which needed to be completed, furnished, and to some extent endowed, and he so far busied himself with this work as to double the number of prebends, from twenty-one to forty-two. His predecessor, Bishop Remigius, had refounded a pre-conquest house at Stow, north-west of Lincoln, probably intending that its monks should replace the cathedral canons; but Bloet transferred the monks to Eynsham, Oxfordshire, and took over their estates for the cathedral. He also retained the patronage of Eynsham for the bishopric, and it is noteworthy that after his death his viscera were buried there. He used his credit with the king to obtain numerous grants and confirmations of lands, churches, and privileges for himself and his see. The manors of Nettleham, Lincolnshire, and Tixover, Rutland, the king's vineyard at Lincoln, the right to take tolls at the fairs of Stow, leave to make a way through the city walls of Lincoln to reach his own house&#151;these were just a few of the benefits of royal favour.<br>
<br>Bloet added the considerable Huntingdonshire manor of Spaldwick to the endowments of his see, though only at the cost of agreeing to the creation in 1109 of the see of Ely from the larger part of the Isle of Ely and county of Cambridgeshire, formerly belonging to the archdeaconry of Huntingdonshire. He was, indeed, thought by some to be a rather indecisive bishop, and his failure to persuade the abbot of St Albans to allow him to ordain clerks from the archdeaconries of Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire, and Bedfordshire in the abbey church attracted much unfavourable comment, although the episode does also show him attempting to perform an important diocesan function. His few surviving episcopal <i>acta</i> show him to have been active in consecrating churches and in confirming gifts to religious houses. His problems with ordinations notwithstanding, he dedicated the abbey church at St Albans in 1115, and granted an indulgence of one day's remission of penance in every week for a year to penitents visiting St Albans. He himself founded the hospital of the Holy Sepulchre at Lincoln, and reportedly sent young clerks from his household to study under Bishop Ivo of Chartres, the most distinguished canonist of his time. At a national level Bloet attended Anselm's reforming council at Westminster in 1102, was present when the archbishop consecrated five bishops at Canterbury in 1107, and was among the bishops who came to the council at Westminster in 1115, which, though summoned by the king, was primarily devoted to ecclesiastical business.<br>
<br>The low regard in which Bloet was held by William of Malmesbury must have been largely due to the bishop's perceived coolness towards monks. Not only did he remove the monks from Stow to Eynsham, but he was twice, in 1114 and 1123, reported as opposing the choice of a monk to succeed to the archbishopric of Canterbury. In other respects, too, Bloet would have appeared an unduly worldly figure, and not only in monastic eyes. He had a son, Simon, conceived while he was still chancellor, who later became dean of Lincoln. His household, as remembered by the chronicler Henry &#145;of Huntingdon&#146; (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1157), who was brought up in it, was large and splendid&#151;there was a train of noble youths, who included the king's illegitimate son Richard, as well as Gilbert of Sempringham, a future saint, whom Robert ordained to the priesthood. Bloet's appearance in the story of Christina of Markyate is less than creditable&#151;he is alleged to have been bribed to give judgment against Christina's efforts to enter religion.<br>
<br>The end of Bloet's life was such as to give moralists much to savour. Although he continued to attend the court, he fell into Henry I's disfavour. Henry of Huntingdon tells of the bishop's dissolving in tears as he contemplated the lawsuits in which he became embroiled, the heavy fines that resulted, and his household now clad in woollens because he could no longer afford for them the splendid apparel of his great days. On 10 January 1123 Bloet went out hunting at Woodstock, in the company of Roger of Salisbury and Henry I himself, and as they were talking suddenly exclaimed &#145;Lord king, I am dying&#146;, and fell speechless to the ground. He died shortly afterwards, silent and unshriven. He was buried in Lincoln Cathedral, in front of St Mary's altar, at the southern entrance of the lesser cross aisle.<br>
