</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">K&eacute;roualle,  Louise Ren&eacute;e  de Penanco&euml;t de</span>, <i>suo jure</i> duchess of Portsmouth and <i>suo jure</i> duchess of Aubigny in the French nobility  (1649&#150;1734), <span class="occ">royal mistress</span>, was born in September 1649 at the Manoir de K&eacute;roualle, the family home near Brest, Brittany, France, the second of three children of Guillaume de Penanco&euml;t, count de K&eacute;roualle (<i>d</i>. 1690), and his wife, Marie-Anne (<i>d</i>. 1709), daughter of Sebastien de Ploeuc, marquess of Timeur and of Kergolay, and his wife, Marie de Rieux. K&eacute;roualle boasted an ancient lineage but was of relatively minor and apparently somewhat impoverished Breton nobility, while his wife was a connection of the powerful Rieux family. Louise was probably educated at the nearby convent of the Ursulines of Lesneven. Towards the end of 1668 she was appointed a maid of honour to Henriette-Anne, duchess of Orl&eacute;ans and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5144/', "Charles II")</script> (&#145;Madame&#146;), and in June 1670 she was one of her entourage on her visit to England for the signing of the secret treaty of Dover. The death of Madame shortly afterwards proved a turning-point in Louise's life as she was one of Madame's household who were then taken into the service of Charles II's queen, Catherine of Braganza.<h2>
<a name="Thekingsmistress"></a>The king's mistress</h2>The familiar account by Bishop Burnet of de K&eacute;roualle having caught the king's eye at Dover and the duke of Buckingham and Louis XIV then deliberately sending her back in order to ensnare Charles is not supported by other evidence, although the exact circumstances of her new appointment remain unclear. She arrived in September or October 1670 to take up her position as maid of honour and was soon noticed at court, the diarist John Evelyn writing that in November he saw Louise, &#145;that famed beauty, (but in my opinion of a childish simple and baby face)&#146;  (Evelyn, 3.564). Contemporary portraits suggest her features and figure were rounded and that she had dark hair and brown eyes. After about a year Louise became the mistress of Charles II (1630&#150;1685), probably during the October 1671 visit of the court to Newmarket when she was invited to stay at Euston, the home of Lord Arlington, expressly with the intent of attracting the king there. The French ambassador colluded in this arrangement and was soon able to report that it had proved successful. Some ten months later, on 29 July 1672, Louise gave birth to her only son by the king, whom she named Charles. She soon became established as the king's main mistress: on 19 August 1673 she was created Baroness Petersfield, countess of Fareham, and duchess of Portsmouth, and was at the same time appointed a lady of the queen's bedchamber. The new duchess's success enabled her to arrange a marriage for her sister, Henriette-Mauricette, who came to England in 1674, was given a pension of &pound;600 a year, and married Philip Herbert, sixth earl of Pembroke. Portsmouth's son was given the last name of Lennox and the young <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16449/', "Charles Lennox")</script> was created baron of Settrington, earl of March, and duke of Richmond on 9 August 1675, and on 9 September lord of Torboulton, earl of Darnley, and duke of Lennox in the Scottish peerage.<br>
<br>In October 1676 Portsmouth's main pension from Charles II was established at &pound;8600 a year for life. Her annuities had increased to &pound;11,000 by December 1680 and, with the addition of many payments over and above her pensions, in the last four years of the reign she seems to have collected an average of some &pound;20,000 a year. She was probably the most expensive of Charles's mistresses, but the figure of &pound;136,668 often quoted as having been given to her in 1681 from secret-service money is a mistaken calculation  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, appx <span class="smallcap">M</span>, 130&#150;31). At some point before her son was born Portsmouth was given apartments of her own in Whitehall at the end of the Matted Gallery, which she gradually extended until they consisted of some twenty-four rooms and included about 60 to 70 foot of the gallery. Portsmouth occupied these apartments until the end of the reign, and they became a focal point for her ascendancy at court, where she put on magnificent entertainments and provided the main alternative to meeting the king in his own or the queen's rooms. John Evelyn described them in 1675 as &#145;luxuriously furnished and with ten times the richness and glory beyond the Queene's&#146;  (Evelyn, 4.74). Portsmouth's success was not, however, always assured. In 1674 Charles II contracted a sexually transmitted disease which he passed on to Portsmouth, who reportedly suffered far worse effects from it than he did; this may have been the cause of her recurrent ill health thereafter. Moreover, Nell Gwyn, the king's other mistress at this time, was a constant source of irritation to Portsmouth, and the arrival of Hortense, duchess of Mazarin, in England in December 1675 was potentially an even greater threat. It was soon apparent that the king was attracted to Hortense and this, coupled with Portsmouth's illness in April 1676, gave rise to many rumours that their relationship had become purely platonic and that she would soon be displaced altogether. In August that year Portsmouth, in obvious distress, poured out her troubles to the French ambassador; in December, in the ambassador's presence, she complained to the king of his infidelities, recalling the previous disastrous consequences. However, the king's affair with Mazarin was short-lived, and Portsmouth had regained her position by 1677.<h2>
<a name="Courtpolitician"></a>Court politician</h2>Portsmouth was careful in her alliances with the king's ministers: in 1673 she fell out with Lord Arlington, whose fortunes were declining, and transferred her allegiance to his rival Thomas Osborne, earl of Danby, the new lord treasurer, in 1674. She assisted Danby's son in gaining a post in the king's bedchamber in 1674, and in April 1676, on reports that Danby and the duke of York had fallen out at Newmarket, she made a hurried journey there in order to support Danby. Portsmouth's progress to the centre of court politics was closely watched and encouraged by Louis XIV, who hoped that she would be useful in promoting French interests. In 1673, however, Portsmouth greatly annoyed the French king by advancing one of the mademoiselles d'Elbeuf as a bride for the duke of York and refusing to desist despite requests conveyed by the French ambassador. The ambassador was not impressed by her apparent ill will towards France, and in his opinion she merited no kindness from Louis XIV. However, at the request of Charles II, in 1674 the estate of Aubigny in France was given to her for life and afterwards to her son. This seems to have encouraged Portsmouth to ask Louis XIV for several positions for her relations in France; although these were refused, an expensive pair of earrings was presented to her in 1675. These gifts saw a significant change in attitude: Portsmouth now frequently expressed gratitude to Louis XIV and began to facilitate access to Charles II for the French ambassador in her apartments, to report useful information to the ambassador, and even, from 1676 onwards, to take part in discussions between the king and the ambassador concerning foreign affairs. In 1677, when it appeared that England was being drawn into war against France, an illness of Portsmouth's in December that year allowed Ambassador Barrillon to enjoy even greater privacy in his meetings with the king, as the rest of the court was shut out of her apartments. Portsmouth was then involved in proposals made in January 1678 to the French concerning a possible exchange of towns in the Spanish Netherlands, discussions in December concerning a secret subsidy for England in return for not calling parliament, and similar discussions in 1679 and 1680. Early in 1680 the ambassador offered inducements of &pound;10,000 each to Portsmouth and her ally the earl of Sunderland to encourage them to facilitate an Anglo-French treaty.<br>
<br>While always assuring the French of her zeal for their interests, Portsmouth kept very much to Charles II's negotiating position, and in fact these discussions did not result in an agreement. However, she certainly appeared to represent French interests and this, her Catholicism, and her association with Danby attracted unfavourable attention. In June 1678 she was indirectly criticized in the House of Commons by Henry Booth, and on 27 April 1679 was named by Thomas Mostyn in a speech that, fortunately for Portsmouth, was not followed up by other MPs. Clearly concerned to maintain her position, she had in fact broken with Danby by March 1679 and was at this point closely associated with Robert, earl of Sunderland, the new secretary of state. She was involved in his secret plans to invite William of Orange over to England in the summer of 1679, William being advised to &#145;make some application to her&#146; as she had &#145;more power over him [the king] than can be imagined&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of &hellip; Sidney</span>, 1.15), and in the autumn of that year they both supported the duke of York against the duke of Monmouth. The opposition kept up the pressure on Portsmouth. In addition to increasingly vitriolic satire, the campaign included the anonymous <span class="italic">Articles of high treason, and other high crimes and misdemeanours against the duchess of Portsmouth</span>, twenty-two charges accusing her of subverting church and state, which were circulating by 5 January 1680. These were to form the basis of a projected attack on her in the forthcoming parliament, which, however, was soon afterwards prorogued. Then in June 1680, at the Middlesex sessions, the earl of Shaftesbury and his followers entered an information against the duke of York as a recusant and at the same time against the duchess of Portsmouth as a &#145;common nuisance&#146;. The attack on York and a difference with the duchess of York (who appeared to favour Portsmouth's rival Hortense, duchess of Mazarin) may have persuaded Portsmouth that abandoning her alliance with York was in her own interests. By August she had turned against him and some time afterwards she was reconciled with the duke of Monmouth. Early in October she arranged meetings between the exclusionist peer Lord Howard of Escrick and the king, and during the following parliamentary session she openly advocated the bill to exclude the duke of York from the throne. When things went badly for the exclusionists, it was reported on 24 October that she was &#145;crying all day for fear the Parliament should be dissolved&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of &hellip; Sidney</span>, 2.181). The duke of York wrote in November that Portsmouth &#145;has play'd me a dog trick&#146;  (Emilia, La Marquise Campana de Cavelli, 1.340). Portsmouth also met with exclusionists such as Shaftesbury, and later the &#145;Southampton Whigs&#146;, a group led by such men as Ralph Montagu and William, Lord Russell. When their plans failed, her position at court appeared precarious. However, although Portsmouth had apparently become convinced of the need for exclusion, intriguingly she had acted at least in part with the king's knowledge, as both she and Charles II informed William of Orange when he at last visited England in August 1681. By this time Portsmouth appeared to be recovering her position, and in November 1681 a reconciliation was arranged with the duke of York, Portsmouth later using her influence with the king to allow York to return from Scotland. The king himself arranged a public reconciliation in November between Portsmouth and her inveterate enemy the marquess of Halifax in her apartments. In January 1682 she gave a banquet for the Moroccan ambassador, which was also attended by Nell Gwyn and the daughters of the duchess of Cleveland; &#145;concubines and catell of that sort &hellip; as splendid as jewells, and excess of bravery could make them&#146;, wrote John Evelyn disapprovingly  (Evelyn, 4.267&#150;8). The instalment of Portsmouth's son as a knight of the Garter in April 1681 and then as master of the horse in January 1682 confirmed her favour with Charles II. She was very much involved in her son's appointment and at least two borough corporations were sufficiently impressed by it to attempt to gain her favour. In 1683 the town of Portsmouth elected the duke of Richmond to the freedom of the borough, which may explain Portsmouth's gift to the town of a pair of silver flagons in that year, and the town of York replaced the duke of Buckingham with Richmond as their high steward, prompting Portsmouth to send a letter of thanks and assure them of her services.<br>
<br>Portsmouth also resumed her role as an intermediary with the French ambassador, and increasingly appears to have pressed Charles to accept French policy. In January 1682 she encouraged him to accept a French conquest of Luxembourg and to resist calls for war with France. She then made a visit to France from March to June 1682. Travelling in great style, she met Louis XIV with messages from Charles II, and was given all the recognition and assurances of kindness that she could wish for. While there she was reported to be &#145;living at a vast rate &hellip; and [is] greatly complimented there; the people flock about her coaches&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, 6.357). She went from Paris to Brittany, where she bought back the family estates of K&eacute;roualle and Mesnouales which her father had been obliged to sell. This visit visibly raised her status on her return, and she undertook her role in politics with renewed vigour: exchanging letters with Louis XIV, managing the reinstatement of her ally Sunderland as secretary of state in January 1683, supporting the duke of York's and Sidney Godolphin's return to the cabinet council in June and September the same year, and aligning herself with York and his allies against the marquess of Halifax. Persistent rumours of an affair between Portsmouth and the French nobleman Philip de Vend&ocirc;me in June&#150;November 1683 alarmed the French ambassador, who thought Portsmouth was endangering her position, and he enlisted Louis XIV's support in removing Vend&ocirc;me from England. Despite these rumours, Charles II's esteem for his mistress showed no sign of decreasing: at his request Louis XIV agreed to create the estate of Aubigny as a duchy for Portsmouth in January 1684, and in November her son was naturalized as a French subject in order that he might inherit her property. She also bought further lands in France, near Brest, at about this time. In September 1684 she accompanied the king on a visit to the town of her title, Portsmouth, and as the king had not taken lodgings in the town (preferring to sleep in his yacht), her lodgings &#145;was the court in the daytime&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hastings MSS</span>, 2.177). Her illness in October&#150;November 1684 apparently caused a suspension of almost all business. A letter to her from Charles II probably belongs to this period, in which he writes,<blockquote>I should do my selfe wrong if I tould you that I love you better then all the world besides, for that were making a comparison where 'tis impossible to express the true passion and kindness I have for my dearest, dearest fubs. (Duchess of Portsmouth's MSS, Goodwood MS 3, unfol.)</blockquote>On 22 November it was reported that &#145;since her grace's recovery she is greater and more absolute than ever&#146;  (Thomas Wyndham to Viscount Weymouth). Only a few months later, however, on 6 February 1685, Charles II died. According to the French ambassador, it was Portsmouth who on 5 February brought him the news that Charles was at heart a Catholic and pressed him to urge the duke of York to make the necessary arrangements.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>After the king's death Portsmouth's influence instantly ceased. Her son was removed as master of the horse and she returned to France in August 1685. In 1686 some incautious remarks concerning Madame de Maintenon almost occasioned an exile from the French court. She visited England in 1686&#150;7 and was present at the marriage of her niece Charlotte to the son of Sir George Jeffreys in July 1688. After the revolution she lost her English pensions but was granted a substantial annuity by Louis XIV. Her apartments in Whitehall were destroyed in the fire of 1691. In the 1690s she lived in Paris, at 3&#150;5 quai Voltaire. Her son Richmond, who had converted to Catholicism at her request in October 1685, secretly went to England in 1692, joined William of Orange, and reconverted. Eventually reconciled with him, she desired to go to England to try to reclaim her pension. She was granted permission in 1698 and visited England from July 1698 to February 1699, but her pension was not reinstated. On her return to France she lived in Paris and at her estate in Aubigny. The remainder of her life was spent in attempting to regain financial stability, in which she had some success (in 1716 she sold most of her lands in Brittany, and her French pension was greatly increased in 1718 and then converted to a life annuity in 1721), and in good works in the town of Aubigny, where she founded a convent. Her grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16450/', "Charles Lennox, second duke of Richmond")</script>, and his wife often visited her at Aubigny, and her last visit to England was in 1732&#150;4. She died in Paris on 14 November 1734 and was buried there on 16 November in the church of the Barefooted Carmelites in the chapel of the Rieux family. Portsmouth's son having predeceased her, her grandson the second duke of Richmond inherited her property.<br>
<br>Unlike Charles II's other mistresses, Portsmouth was not generally accounted a great beauty, nor was she renowned for her wit. On the other hand, her desire and talent for pleasing were noticed. Elizabeth, duchess of Orl&eacute;ans later commented, &#145;The Duchess of Portsmouth is the finest lady of her kind that I have ever met; she is extremely polite and interesting in her conversation&#146;  (Delpech, 193), and indeed in England the hospitality she provided in her magnificent apartments, her unfailing civility to other important courtiers, and her willingness to become an intermediary for Charles II made her a significant and enduring political force at the Restoration court.<br>
