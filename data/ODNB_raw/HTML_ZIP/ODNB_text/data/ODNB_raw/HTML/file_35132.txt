<span class="headword">Moulton,  John Fletcher</span>, Baron Moulton  (1844&#150;1921), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was born on 18 November 1844 at Madeley, Shropshire, the third son of the Revd James Egan Moulton (<i>d</i>. 1866), a Wesleyan minister, formerly headmaster of New Kingswood School, Bath, and his wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1855), daughter of William Fiddian, brass-founder, of Birmingham. Moulton was named after a former vicar of Madeley, John William Fletcher, who had been a friend of John Wesley. He was a younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19432/', "William Fiddian Moulton")</script> and uncle of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35131/', "James Hope Moulton")</script>.<br>
<br>Moulton received his early education from his father. At the age of eleven he was sent to Kingswood School and was at once placed in the headmaster's class. By thirteen and a half he was head of the school. At sixteen he scored the highest marks in England at the first of the Oxford and Cambridge local examinations. On leaving Kingswood School he was for a short time an assistant master at schools in Biggleswade and Northampton before in 1861 matriculating at London University, winning a studentship of &pound;30. He took his BA degree in mathematics and was alone in the first class both at the intermediate and the final examination (1865). Meanwhile he had been elected to a scholarship at St John's College, Cambridge. His mathematical ability became famous in Cambridge, and he was the only applicant for a mathematics scholarship at London University. Coached by the famous Dr Edward John Routh, he was first Smith's prizeman and senior wrangler in 1868, with the highest marks then known. The same year he won the gold medal for mathematics at London University, and was elected a fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge, few of the St John's fellowships then being open to laymen. Moulton worked both as college tutor and private tutor, and regularly attended the debates of the Union Society, of which he was president in 1868, and then treasurer until he left Cambridge in 1873. The union records show that he was an advocate of votes for women, reform of the university system of education, and Irish conciliation.<br>
<br>In 1873 Moulton read for the bar in London and the following year he was called by the Middle Temple. He read in chambers with William George Harrison, then a busy common-law junior, and soon had general work of his own. In 1875 he married Clara (<i>d</i>. 1888), widow of Robert William Thompson, of Edinburgh and Stonehaven. They had at least one child, Hugh Lawrence Fletcher Moulton.<br>
<br>The passing of the <span class="roman">Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks Act</span> (1883), which increased the number of patent actions, gave Moulton the opportunity to take on many new cases, and in 1885 he became queen's counsel. His private experiments in electricity meanwhile won him a fellowship of the Royal Society. After Clara's death in 1888 Moulton took the lead in all patent cases of any importance. Scientific facts and problems presented no difficulties to him and he had the gift of easy and lucid speech. He often appeared in parliamentary committee rooms when bills relating to electrical undertakings were being promoted. He was also a favourite advocate in compensation cases and in those concerning trade marks and trade names. In the lengthy litigation over the right of the Kodak Company to register the word &#145;Solio&#146; as a trade mark, the House of Lords accepted his arguments in spite of the adverse judgments of the two courts below. Moulton appeared in the cases which centred round the Dunlop and Welsbach patents, and he was counsel in the arbitration which settled the price of the London water companies when the Metropolitan Water Board was created. There were not many barristers of his time who earned more than he did.<br>
<br>In November 1885 Moulton was elected to the House of Commons as Liberal member for the Clapham division of Battersea, and began a parliamentary career which received many setbacks. He lost his seat at the general election of 1886, failed to win a seat at the general election of 1892, and had to wait to get back to parliament until 1894 when he was elected member for South Hackney in succession to Lord Russell of Killowen, who, as Sir Charles Russell, had held the seat for eight years. This seat he lost at the general election of 1895. He returned to the House of Commons as member for the Launceston division of Cornwall in August 1898, and continued to sit for that constituency until the general election of 1906.<br>
<br>In 1901 Moulton married his second wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1909), daughter of Major Henry Davis, of Naples; they had one daughter. At about the same time he also began to take an active part in the House of Commons. He spoke effectively against the Chinese labour ordinances after the South African War; made a speech in 1904 which convinced many waverers that the supporters of a &#145;pure beer&#146; bill were neglecting valuable scientific discoveries, and that beer drinkers had nothing to fear from what was represented as adulteration; and in 1905 he carried through the house a measure which became the <span class="roman">Trade Marks Act</span>. Between 1885 and 1905 the Liberals were only in office for about three years, and Moulton had few chances of promotion; but on their return to power in 1906 he was made a lord justice of appeal in succession to Sir James Charles Mathew, knighted, and sworn of the privy council.<br>
<br>During his six years in the Court of Appeal, Moulton cut an impressive figure. His powers of assimilation were his real strength, and he dealt with commercial cases, appeals under the <span class="roman">Workmen's Compensation Act</span>, and libel actions as if he had been dealing with them all his career. Notable cases in which his dissenting judgment was upheld by the House of Lords were <i>Scott v. Scott</i> (1913, the right to order a trial in camera), and <i>Attorney-General v. West Riding of Yorkshire County Council</i> (1907, the obligation of local education authorities to pay for religious instruction in non-provided schools). In <i>Cuenod v. Leslie</i> (1909) he showed characteristic independence on the question of a husband's liability for the torts of his wife. From time to time he formed a court with two colleagues&#151;lords justices James Stirling and Robert Romer&#151;each of whom had also been a senior wrangler. In 1912 he succeeded Lord Robson as a lord of appeal in ordinary, and became a life peer with the title of Baron Moulton of Bank in the county of Southampton.<br>
<br>Shortly after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Lord Moulton was invited by the government to head a committee to organize the manufacture of high explosives and propellants for British forces. In this capacity, he organized a service which, as the explosives supply department (ESD), became a branch of the War Office. At the armistice in November 1918, ESD was turning out 1000 tons of high explosives a day. Moulton had to overcome great difficulties; there were few factories available and sources of raw materials were limited. Lyddite had been replaced by trinitrotoluene, every 3 tons of which required 2 tons of toluene. It took 600 tons of coal to produce 1 ton of toluene. Moulton suggested mixing ammonium nitrate with trinitrotoluene to produce a new compound explosive, amatol. At a time when shipping facilities were disorganized he had to secure large quantities of nitric acid, sulphuric acid, and glycerine. He had control of the gasworks, coke ovens, and fat and oil supplies of the whole country. After it was decided to use poison gas if the enemy used it first, Moulton undertook its manufacture. During the war his department delivered a total of 612,697 tons of high explosive and 450,487 tons of propellants. For these services in wartime Moulton was created KCB (1915) and GBE (1917). At Christmas 1920 he underwent a slight nasal operation; 8 March 1921 he sat in the House of Lords and seemed to have recovered his usual good health, but in the early hours of 9 March died in his sleep at his London home, 57 Onslow Square, South Kensington. His death, caused by a clot in an artery, was instantaneous. Addressing the lords of appeal two days later, Lord Birkenhead spoke of the intellectual force and dynamic impulse of personality which had enabled a judge to play a supreme part in the war.<br>
