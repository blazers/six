<span class="headword">Lambert,  Joyce Mildred</span>  (1916&#150;2005), <span class="occ">botanist and ecologist</span>, was born on 23 June 1916 at 50 Oakbank Grove, Herne Hill, London, the daughter of Loftus Sidney Lambert, clerk for an electrical supply company, and later estate agent, and his wife, Mildred Emma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barker. She was brought up in Brundall, Norfolk, her family's ancestral county, to which she was devoted. She was educated at Norwich High School for Girls and then, in 1939, graduated in botany from the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. After a short period as a schoolteacher in Norwich she was appointed lecturer in botany at Westfield College, London. In this formative period she fell under the influence of some of the outstanding botanists and naturalists of her time, each of whom helped shape her career and destiny in different ways. It was the Norfolk naturalist A. E. (Ted) Ellis and the botanist A. R. Clapham (then at Oxford) who encouraged her in the 1940s to study the ecology of the fens bordering the River Yare in the Surlingham&#150;Rockland area of Norfolk.<br>
<br>In 1948 Lambert moved to Cambridge University and began working with the geomorphologist J. N. Jennings on the Bure valley. They published their collaborative work in three classic papers. In 1952 Jennings published the results of his own extensive research in the area, which concluded that most if not all of the great pattern of lakes known as the Broads were of natural origin. In her study Lambert used a similar basic stratigraphical technique: removing core samples of peat with a borer. Significantly however, she used a borer with a narrower diameter and took vast numbers of very closely spaced samples. These revealed, to her own and the scientific community's astonishment, that the sides of the lakes were almost vertical. The conclusion was inevitable&#151;the Broads were artificial. But how could such vast excavations have been undertaken in an area so subject to inundation&#151;and for what purpose? Further historical and archaeological studies backed by Cambridge University revealed that there had once been digging of peat for fuel on a monumental scale&#151;the residents of each fenland parish had had turbary rights entitling them to dig within a certain area, but the practice had been abandoned by the end of the fourteenth century as the area became increasingly prone to flooding. These multidisciplinary studies were published in 1960 in a further book, <span class="italic">The Making of the Broads</span>, with Lambert and Jennings as the senior authors.<br>
<br>In 1950 Lambert had been appointed lecturer in botany at Southampton University. Her contributions there, in research and teaching, though overshadowed by her East Anglian studies, were significant. Known to everyone at Southampton as Bloss (an abbreviation of Blossom), she became one of the most inspiring teachers of plant ecology Britain has produced. She coined what is probably the most elegantly simple definition of this often over-complicated subject: &#145;What grows where, and why?&#146;  (personal knowledge). She inspired her students by example and experience. She described working under Sir Harry Godwin at Cambridge and once being given a huge ecological tome one Friday and told to read and distil it into a 3000 word presentation by the following Tuesday. &#145;But Professor Godwin&#146;, she had complained, &#145;it's by Braun-Blanquet and I don't speak German.&#146; &#145;Then I suggest you learn it&#146; was Godwin's reply. She did  (personal knowledge). At Southampton, too, Lambert made a pioneering contribution to the use of computers in botanical science in her collaboration with her head of department, Bill Williams, on the multivariate analysis of plant communities. Their elegant publications on association analysis, a statistical procedure that determines the frequency of association of different species in the same habitat, became among the most widely cited papers in the history of plant ecology.<br>
<br>Joyce Lambert was of striking appearance, short and almost spherical, with close-cropped silver-grey hair embroidered with a yellowish fringe at the front where the smoke from her ever-present Kensitas cigarettes curled upwards. She was a most companionable woman with inimitable enthusiasm and spirit, and rich good humour, quick talking, and with a deep mischievous laugh enhanced by a smoker's throatiness. She was also delightfully opinionated; she never, for instance, saw the point of installing an internal telephone system in the small Southampton botany building, saying that standing at the top of the stairs and shouting had always been perfectly satisfactory. She was an ardent supporter of Norwich City football club and after her retirement in 1980 returned to the house in Brundall that her grandfather had built in the 1920s. She spent some years looking after her ageing mother and enjoying her garden and then, because of increasing infirmity, for the last three years of her life was confined to a nursing home, Oakwood House, Old Watton Road, Colney, Norfolk. She died there on 4 May 2005 of bronchopneumonia. She received no significant award and was mystifyingly denied the formal recognition her remarkable work merited. She never married.<br>
