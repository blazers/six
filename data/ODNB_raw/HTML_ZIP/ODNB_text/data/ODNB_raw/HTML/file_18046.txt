<span class="headword">Margaret</span> <span class="st"> [Margaret of France]</span>  (1279?&#150;1318), <span class="occ">queen of England</span>, second consort of Edward I, was the last child of Philippe III of France (<i>d</i>. 1285) and his second wife, Marie de Brabant. The story that Edward initially hoped to marry Margaret's elder sister, Blanche, is unfounded; Philippe IV first suggested his half-sister Margaret as a wife for Edward [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8517/', "Edward I")</script>] in 1294, but the project hung fire until negotiations began in 1298 to end Edward's Gascon war against Philippe.<br>
<br>Margaret and Edward married amid rich ceremony at Canterbury on 10 September 1299; according to the <span class="italic">Liber de antiquis legibus</span>, Margaret was then aged twenty. She wore a crown at her wedding and on great occasions thereafter, but was never anointed queen. Her first son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27196/', "Thomas of Brotherton, later earl of Norfolk and earl marshal (d. 1338)")</script>, was born at Brotherton in Yorkshire on 1 June 1300, apparently prematurely as Cawood had been prepared for her confinement; an early birth would support the story that she named her son for Thomas Becket, whom she invoked during a dangerous labour. The child reputedly languished on a French nurse's milk, but throve when an Englishwoman replaced her. A second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8506/', "Edmund of Woodstock, later earl of Kent (d. 1330)")</script>, was born at Woodstock on 1 August 1301; Margaret's daughter, Eleanor, born at Winchester on 6 May 1306, died in 1310.<br>
<br>Margaret was less constantly with Edward than Eleanor of Castile (<i>d</i>. 1290), but contemporary chroniclers remark his great love for her, and his letters reveal him to have been most attentive to her welfare and to that of her children. She was friendly with his daughters by Eleanor and in 1305 helped to reconcile him with his son the prince of Wales; she appeared with her husband on such ceremonial occasions as the Feast of the Swans in 1306 and a commemorative mass for Eleanor in 1307. Her official duties are rarely noted, but in 1301 Edward did designate her to determine whether two of his agents had suitable credentials to conclude a truce with the Scots. Margaret was notably active as an intercessor between Edward and his subjects; perhaps she hoped thereby to allay any lingering distrust of her French connections or of the unpopular treaty that led to her marriage, but a story in the later <span class="italic">Scalacronica</span>, that she once passed strategic information to Philippe IV, suggests she never entirely escaped suspicion. It is unclear, however, if either Margaret or Edward II knew of Philippe IV's project in 1310 to marry her daughter, Eleanor, to a Sicilian prince.<br>
<br>After Edward I's death Margaret commissioned her chaplain, John London, to write a Latin eulogy of her husband. In 1308 she attended Edward II's wedding to her niece Isabella of France, and in November 1312 witnessed Edward III's birth. Little is heard of her thereafter until her death on 14 February 1318; she was interred in the Franciscans' London church, to the construction of which she had contributed 2000 marks in 1306, and a further 100 marks in her will. Margaret was as richly dowered as Eleanor of Castile, held most of the latter's lands, and enjoyed all the financial perquisites of her office. Her revenues must have been ample, but she was apparently extravagant. By 1302 her debts stood at &pound;4000; to pay them Edward assigned her all receipts from wardships and in 1305 granted her new estates worth &pound;500, while the pope, Clement V, in 1306 allowed her, for her expenses and charities, &pound;4000 from a tenth collected in England for the relief of the Holy Land. She none the less left sizeable debts.<br>
<br>Contemporary English writers hailed Margaret as &#145;the flower of the French&#146;  (Wright, 178), her physical beauty surpassed only by the purity of her morals; Robert Mannyng of Brunne in 1338 called her &#145;good without lack&#146;  (<span class="italic">Peter Langtoft's Chronicle</span>, 2.306). Her tomb was sold by Sir Martin Bowes about 1550, when the Franciscan priory became a parish church. Two extant pieces of sculpture are often associated with Margaret, though neither is an authentic portrait: a battered queen's head on the tomb of Edward's admiral Gervase Alard in Winchelsea church, and a mid-fourteenth-century statue on the south buttress of Lincoln Cathedral, the features of which may have been recut.<br>
