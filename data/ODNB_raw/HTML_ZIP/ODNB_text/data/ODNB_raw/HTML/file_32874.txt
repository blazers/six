</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Douglas,  (George) Norman</span>  (1868&#150;1952), <span class="occ">travel writer</span>, was born on 8 December 1868, at Th&uuml;ringen, Vorarlberg, Austria, the third son of John Sholto Douglass (1838&#150;1874), mountaineer and archaeologist, and his wife, Vanda (1840&#150;1902), daughter of Baron Ernst von Poellnitz and granddaughter of James Ochoncar, seventeenth Lord Forbes. When Douglas was five, his father was killed in a mountaineering accident, and in 1876 he was sent to be educated at Yarlet Hall, Lancashire, following his mother's second marriage. In 1881 he began two unhappy years at Edward Thring's Uppingham School, and later in life he recalled an ultimatum to his mother: either she remove him, or he would arrange to be expelled for &#145;sexual malpractice&#146;  (Holloway, 43). The threat worked, and he continued his education at the Karlsruhe <i>Gymnasium</i>, where he specialized in natural history, contributing scholarly articles to <span class="italic">The Zoologist</span>.<br>
<br>At twenty-one Douglas entered the Foreign Office, and was posted to St Petersburg, where after two years he was promoted to third secretary. While in Russia Douglas continued to contribute to <span class="italic">The Zoologist</span> and other natural history periodicals, and published two monographs, <span class="italic">The Herpetology of the Grand Duchy of Baden</span> and <span class="italic">On the Darwinian Hypothesis of Sexual Selection</span>. In 1896 he resigned his post with the Foreign Office; he wished to leave the country, having impregnated Helen Demidoft, the daughter of an &eacute;lite Russian family. He bought a villa at Posilipo in the Bay of Naples, intending to dedicate himself to botanical studies and travel.<br>
<br>On 25 June 1898 Douglas married his cousin Elizabeth Louisa Theobaldina 
    (Elsa; 1876&#150;1916)
  , daughter of Augustus FitzGibbon, at Fulham register office, London. The couple married secretly and in haste: Douglas thought himself syphilitic, while Elsa was two months pregnant. They lived at Posilipo, where their first child, Archie, was born, and a second son, Robin, the following year. While travelling in India and Tunisia in 1900, the couple collaborated on <span class="italic">Unprofessional Tales</span>, published under the joint pseudonym Normyx and dedicated to the popular novelist Ouida. Although the collection was not successful, Douglas later revised and republished one short story from it, &#145;Nerinda&#146;. Towards the end of 1902 Douglas's mother died, and by 1903 his prolonged visits to Capri contributed to the breakdown of his marriage. He obtained a divorce in 1904 on the grounds of Elsa's adultery, gaining custody of their two sons.<br>
<br>Douglas moved to Capri, sending his sons to boarding-school in England, and over the next few years privately published eight monographs about the island. In January 1905 Joseph Conrad visited the island for several months, and the two became friends. When by 1907 Douglas found himself short of money, he sold his Capri property, and in January 1908 moved to London, successfully contesting his wife's attempt to regain custody of her children on the grounds of her husband's &#145;rather faunesque pursuit of young boys&#146;  (Holloway, 161). His wife's lawsuit gave an early indication of the paedophilia which dominated Douglas's later years.<br>
<br>By mid-1909 Douglas was establishing himself in London literary circles, writing for the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span> and the <span class="italic">English Review</span>. His eyewitness account of devastating earthquakes in Capri was serialized in the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, and later articles were incorporated into three books, <span class="italic">Siren Land</span> (1911) about the Sorrento peninsula, <span class="italic">Fountains in the Sand</span> (1912) on Tunisia, and <span class="italic">Old Calabria</span> (1915). These were not financially successful, but <span class="italic">Old Calabria</span> especially made him known. He was appointed assistant editor of the <span class="italic">English Review</span> in 1912. Regular work at the <span class="italic">English Review</span> brought him not only a necessary income, but also weekly contact with contributors&#151;including Edward Thomas, Rupert Brooke, James Elroy Flecker, Compton Mackenzie, and D. H. Lawrence.<br>
<br>While working at the <span class="italic">English Review</span> Douglas was drafting his best-known book, <span class="italic">South Wind</span>. Meanwhile, he published <span class="italic">London Street Games</span> (1916), in his terms a social document, intended to &#145;demonstrate the inventiveness of children&#146;  (Holloway, 225). Much of the material came from his friendship with Eric, an East End street urchin whom Douglas had adopted in 1911 and had taken touring with him around Europe. The book became a major source for James Joyce's <span class="italic">Finnegans Wake</span>, and was still acclaimed by child psychologists in the 1960s. Later in 1916 a darker aspect of Douglas's interest in young boys became evident when he was arrested and charged with sexually assaulting a sixteen-year-old boy. In January 1917 he was charged with further offences against two brothers aged ten and twelve. On the advice of Compton Mackenzie, Joseph Conrad, and other friends, he broke his bail conditions and returned to Capri.<br>
<br>At Capri Douglas completed the proofs of <span class="italic">South Wind</span>, which enjoyed an immediate success. Its ironic questioning of conventional morality appealed to a war-weary public, and its humane values were praised by Virginia Woolf in the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>. It sold particularly well in America, but as Douglas was not protected by copyright there, his financial situation was not ameliorated. In 1917 he moved to Paris and later to St Malo, where poverty extending to near-starvation made it impossible to complete his next book. He finished it at Menton, and after protracted negotiations with various publishers, it appeared as <span class="italic">They Went</span> in 1920. It was received with respectful acclaim, but without the enthusiasm which greeted <span class="italic">South Wind</span>.<br>
<br>From 1920 until 1937 Douglas was settled in Florence, where his financial troubles steadily abated. As his fame grew, he became much visited by inter-war writers, and forged close friendships with D. H. Lawrence and Bryher. During these years he lived with the publisher Giuseppe (Pino) Orioli, who helped him publish several limited editions, most of which were later commercially published in London. <span class="italic">Alone</span> (1921) was the mellowest, most relaxed of his travel writings, the author's favourite and the last about Italy. It was followed by <span class="italic">Together</span> (1923), a recollection of his Vorarlberg childhood which brought glowing tributes in the press, and admiring letters from Lytton Strachey and E. M. Forster.<br>
<br>In 1925 Douglas published <span class="italic">D. H. Lawrence and Maurice Magnus: a Plea for Better Manners</span>, a biting polemic against Lawrence's &#145;ungentlemanly&#146; biographical preface to the memoirs of their mutual friend Magnus, who had committed suicide two years earlier. The pamphlet was surprisingly successful: 500 copies were sold in the first fortnight, and the literary controversy was debated in the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>. The quarrel was continued in <span class="italic">Experiments</span> (1925), causing Lawrence to retaliate in the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> where, he explained, he was &#145;weary of being slandered&#146;. The two were reconciled in 1927, but a continuing rivalry with Lawrence was behind the private publication of <span class="italic">Some Limericks</span> (1928), in Douglas's words &#145;one of the filthiest books in the English language, written for the Dirty Minded Elect&#146;, and in obvious dialogue with <span class="italic">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span>  (Holloway, 367).<br>
<br>Douglas published <span class="italic">Looking Back</span> in 1933, a discursive, leisurely autobiography drawing upon material accumulated over several decades, and brought out as a two-volume limited edition of 535 copies under the guidance of Charles Prentice, his friend and patron at Chatto and Windus. The entire edition was sold prior to publication, and Douglas left off writing for several years, turning down even light reviewing work. He spent the next few years travelling through India, revisiting Calabria, and assisting Orioli with his novel <span class="italic">Moving Along</span>.<br>
<br>In 1937 Douglas was forced to flee Florence after the police made enquiries concerning his friendship with a ten-year-old local girl. By his own account Douglas escaped the wrath of the girl's family &#145;with only an hour to spare&#146;, eventually settling in Lisbon with Orioli, though he spent much of 1940 in France. After Orioli's death in January 1942, he moved to London, where he eked out a living as a language teacher and publisher's reader. Later that year the second British edition of <span class="italic">South Wind</span> was published, and <span class="italic">The Bookseller</span> used the novel, which it characterized as &#145;one of the most famous books of the present century&#146;, to illustrate its campaign for the copyright protection of British books in the USA  (<span class="italic">The Bookseller</span>, Feb 1943).<br>
<br>Douglas returned to Capri in 1946, publishing <span class="italic">Late Harvest</span>, in part an annotated anthology of extracts from earlier books, which contributed further chapters to his interrupted autobiography. During 1949 the Italian Lux Films company began to produce a film of <span class="italic">South Wind</span>, but by November that year the project had collapsed. Douglas died on Capri on 7 February 1952 after several months of illness, and was buried there. <span class="italic">Footnote on Capri</span>, a 10,000-word essay outlining the history of the island and accompanying Islay Lyons's photographs, was published posthumously.<br>
