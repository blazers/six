<span class="headword">Llwyd,  Richard</span>  (1752&#150;1835), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at the King's Head, Beaumaris, Anglesey, the son of John Llwyd, a small coast trader, and his wife, Alice. The early death of his father from smallpox left the family in financial difficulties, and so, after an education of nine months at the free school at Beaumaris, at twelve years of age Llwyd entered the domestic service of a gentleman in the neighbourhood. He used every spare moment, however, for his self-improvement. By 1780 he was entrusted with the duties of steward and secretary to a Mr Griffith of Caerhun, near Conwy, then the only acting magistrate in that district.<br>
<br>Llwyd finally acquired a competency, retired to Beaumaris, and published there his best-known poem, <span class="italic">Beaumaris Bay</span> (1800), with many historical and genealogical notes. &#145;He came to be considered an authority on Welsh heraldry and genealogy&#146;  (<span class="italic">DWB</span>), and as a result was received into many aristocratic households. Through these connections, he managed to secure Royal Literary Fund grants for Richard Robert Jones (Dic Aberdaron) and David Thomas (Daffyd Ddu Eryri), among others. His other productions were <span class="italic">Gayton Wake, or, Mary Dod; and her List of Merits</span> (1804) and <span class="italic">Poems, Tales, Odes, Sonnets, Translations from the British</span> (2 vols., 1804). He became known as the Bard of Snowdon as a result of his literary pursuits.<br>
<br>Early in 1807 Llwyd moved to Chester, and in 1808 he visited London, where he made the acquaintance of Owen Jones, William Owen Pughe, and others. He returned to Chester, and in May 1814 married Ann (<i>d</i>. 1834), daughter of Alderman Bingley of that town. Llwyd was a strong Welsh patriot, and in 1824 was made a member of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion. Llwyd died at his home, Bank Place, in Chester, on 29 December 1835, and was buried at St John's Church. On the south side of the church wall a tablet was placed to his memory. A collected edition of his works, with a memoir and portrait, was published in 1837.<br>
