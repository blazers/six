<span class="headword">Johnstone,  James  Hope-</span>, third earl of Hopetoun and <i>de jure</i> fifth earl of Annandale and Hartfell  (1741&#150;1816), <span class="occ">landowner and army officer</span>, was born James Hope on 23 August 1741 at Hopetoun House, Linlithgowshire, the second son and fourth child of John Hope, second earl of Hopetoun (1704&#150;1781), and his first wife, Anne Ogilvy (1717&#150;1759), second daughter of James, fifth earl of Findlater and second earl of Seafield. He was educated at home by his tutors John Ritchie and John Tainsh. Commissioned as ensign in the 3rd regiment of foot guards in 1758, he fought at the battle of Minden in 1759. From 1762 to 1766 he travelled with his ailing brother Charles, Lord Hope, around Europe, including Italy, and then to Carolina and Jamaica. Charles died in 1766, after which Hope took the courtesy title Lord Hope. On 25 August 1766 he married Lady Elizabeth Carnegie (1750&#150;1793), daughter of George, sixth earl of Northesk. Together they had six daughters.<br>
<br>During the 1760s and 1770s Hope spent his time managing his father's estates, attending to his family's education, and preparing for a political career. His family was often ill, and this placed Hope in frequent contact with the famed botanist Dr John Hope (1725&#150;1786), who was both a relative and the family physician. Hope succeeded to the earldom on his father's death in 1781 and was soon nicknamed &#145;the Improving Earl&#146; for his efforts to increase the economic potential of his land. He was duly elected vice-president of the Highland Society of Scotland in 1791. His lead mines in Leadhills, Lanarkshire, were arguably the largest in Scotland and attracted the mineralogical interest of naturalists like Thomas Pennant, R. E. Raspe, and John Walker (1731&#150;1803). Likewise, Hopetoun made donations to Edinburgh University's natural history museum and was involved in the politics surrounding the foundation of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783.<br>
<br>From 1784 to 1790 Hopetoun served as a Scottish representative peer. He was an independent voter, opposing the 1788 <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span> and arguing against the taxation of Scottish distilleries. On 18 May 1787 Hopetoun successfully introduced a motion to reaffirm the <span class="roman">Scottish Peerage Bill</span> of 1709&#151;effectively limiting the power of the government by preventing Scottish peers with British titles from being representative Scottish peers. He was not re-elected in 1790 and, along with several other Scottish peers including Dunbar Douglas, fourth earl of Selkirk, unsuccessfully contested the election. In 1792, upon the death of his maternal great-uncle George Johnstone, third marquess of Annandale, who had been declared a lunatic by chancery in 1748, he inherited a &pound;12,000 p.a. estate. Hopetoun took the additional surname of Johnstone and in 1795 proceeded to claim the earldom of Annandale and Hartfell, a subsidiary title of his great-uncle, as senior heir female of the first earl. His claim was unsuccessful but began a series of attempts to secure the peerage by his descendants over the next 190 years; this ended in 1985 when his great-great-great-great-grandson, Patrick Hope Johnstone, was recognized as eleventh earl. Hopetoun's wife died on 19 August 1793. In that year he raised and commanded the Hopetoun fencibles, one of seven Scottish home regiments commissioned by George III in response to the French Revolutionary Wars. The fencibles served in both Scotland and England and, at one point, refused to be transported in ships for fear of being sent to the continent. In 1794 Hopetoun was made lord lieutenant of Linlithgowshire, raised both a yeomanry corps and a volunteer infantry regiment, and was re-elected to the House of Lords, where he served until 1796. The fencibles were disembodied in 1798, but Hopetoun's collective military efforts won him the British title of Baron Hopetoun in 1803.<br>
<br>After leaving parliament, Hopetoun concentrated on Scottish politics, where he used his influence in Linlithgowshire to ensure that Henry Erskine failed to be elected there in 1806 and 1807, Erskine finally withdrawing in 1812. He spent the last years of his life as an invalid and died at Hopetoun House on 29 May 1816; he was buried on 5 June 1816 at Abercorn kirk. During his life, Hopetoun was known as a religious man, and it was appropriate that Hugh Meiklejohn, Edinburgh's professor of church history, gave his funeral address. His half-brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13731/', "John Hope, Baron Niddry")</script>, inherited the British barony and Scottish earldom of Hopetoun. Hopetoun's only surviving child, Anne (1768&#150;1818), who had married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13739/', "Admiral Sir William Johnstone Hope")</script> in 1792, inherited Hopetoun's Annandale estates and his claim to the earldom of Annandale and Hartfell.<br>
