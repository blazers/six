<span class="headword">Scrope,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1350&#150;1405), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24958/', "Henry Scrope, first Baron Scrope of Masham (1312?&#150;1392)")</script>, soldier, and his wife, Joan.<h2>
<a name="Familybackgroundandearlyadvancement"></a>Family background and early advancement</h2>Henry Scrope's distinguished military career had been followed by diligent service to the crown in parliament and council, and family influence probably played a greater part than any spiritual qualities in launching Richard's successful career in the church. His first preferment, as rector of Ainderby Steeple, near Northallerton, in 1368, was at the presentation of his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24963/', "Richard Scrope, Baron Scrope of Bolton")</script>. This was followed in 1371 by a Lancastrian connection in the form of a grant of the wardenship of the free chapel of the castle of Tickhill, which belonged to John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster. Scrope was still not even an acolyte when he was appointed official to Thomas Arundel, bishop of Ely (<i>d</i>. 1414), his future archiepiscopal colleague, in 1375. He was ordained deacon on 20 September 1376 by his brother-in-law, Archbishop Alexander Neville of York (<i>d</i>. 1392), and priest on 14 March 1377 by Arundel. In the meantime he had studied arts at Oxford before embarking on the study of law, probably at Cambridge, which was where he presumably became licentiate in civil law by 1375 and a doctor of canon and civil law by 1383. He was chancellor of the university in 1378. From 1382 to 1386 he appears to have been based primarily at Rome, where he served as a papal chaplain and an auditor of the curia. In 1382 he was instituted as dean of Chichester, and in September 1385 he was elected bishop of that see, only for the combined wishes of pope and canons to be thwarted by Richard II's insistence on the advancement of his own confessor, Thomas Rushook, bishop of Llandaff. Compensation followed swiftly with Scrope's provision as bishop of Coventry and Lichfield on 18 August 1386, and consecration by the pope at Genoa on the following day. He had returned to England by 15 November and took up his diocesan duties from 22 May 1387.<br>
<br>In common with many of his fellow prelates, Scrope combined a significant involvement in secular affairs with his spiritual obligations. As befitted a member of a northern baronial family, he acted as an envoy to Scotland in 1378 and 1392, and served as a conservator of the truce in 1394. In 1397 he was dispatched on a mission to Rome, probably because of his familiarity with the curia, to promote Richard II's scheme for the canonization of Edward II. It may have been in recognition of recent efforts on the king's behalf, as well as of his good standing with the pope, that he was translated to the archbishopric of York on 15 March 1398, while still at Rome.<h2>
<a name="ArchbishopofYork"></a>Archbishop of York</h2>Until 1399 there is no evidence that Scrope participated directly in the factional strife that punctuated Richard II's reign. In that year, however, he was compelled to respond to the coup that led to Richard's deposition and the accession of Henry IV. In view of certain procedural similarities between the deposition of Richard and that of the emperor Frederick II by the pope in 1245, it was more probably as a distinguished canon lawyer than as a political partisan that Scrope, with his fellow lawyer John Trefnant, bishop of Hereford (<i>d</i>. 1404), was chosen to head the commission appointed to receive the captive king's &#145;voluntary&#146; abdication on 29 September; and it was he who announced it in a quasi-parliamentary assembly that met on the following day. His prominent role continued when he joined his fellow archbishop, the newly restored Thomas Arundel, in escorting Henry of Lancaster to the vacant throne, although the actual crowning was to be performed a fortnight later by his senior colleague.<br>
<br>Attempts to assess the nature and development of Scrope's personal affiliations in the turbulent early years of Henry IV's reign tend to be tainted with hindsight. He remained in his diocese except in times of parliaments and great councils. The dominance of Henry Percy, earl of Northumberland (<i>d</i>. 1408), and his family and affinity, in northern England, and the Percys' crucial role in helping to put Henry IV on the throne, meant that any archbishop of York was almost certain to become involved with them at the local and national level. Thus in 1400 Scrope headed a commission to collect a loan to help to pay for the expedition to Scotland that Henry had undertaken, it may be assumed, under pressure from his powerful northern allies. Scrope's younger brother John was married to Elizabeth, widow of Northumberland's second son, Thomas, and one of the archbishop's sisters, Isabel, had married Sir Robert Plumpton, who had strong connections with the Percys. However, against any suggestion that these and other relationships had already made Scrope an adherent of the Percys must be set the fact that, at least up to the end of 1402, any personal or professional association with that family was quite compatible with unequivocal loyalty and good service to the crown.<h2>
<a name="Involvementinrebellion"></a>Involvement in rebellion</h2>Nevertheless, when the Percys revolted in the summer of 1403, choices had to be made. The chronicler John Hardyng, himself a Percy retainer, claimed that Scrope was among those who encouraged the Percys in their rebellion, but there is no hint in official sources that he came under suspicion, even though Archbishop Arundel, a firm supporter of Henry IV throughout his reign, found it necessary to declare his own innocence. Thus while rebellion in the Percy cause in the summer of 1405 represented a plausible course of action for almost any member of the clerical or lay establishment in the north, there seems to have been no suspicion that Scrope was about to take that momentous step.<br>
<br>The problem of accounting for Scrope's decision to rebel is compounded by an absence of convincing motives. Sympathetic clerical writers alleged that Scrope's rebellion was inspired primarily by his growing disapproval of Henry IV's oppression of the church. Although the charges against the king appear to lack any real substance, they were perhaps foreseeable in any attempt to justify the taking up of arms by an archbishop. Scrope's only recorded gesture against a political threat to the church was his predictable support in October 1404 for Arundel's spirited resistance to proposals in parliament at Coventry for the confiscation of ecclesiastical property. Attempts to explain Scrope's rebellion have focused on the manifesto by which he incited the people of York to rise with him. The most plausible version of this document, as reproduced by the chronicler Thomas Walsingham, includes complaints of abuse of church and clergy; excessive taxation of the laity; misappropriation of much of this revenue by unspecified individuals; and unfair treatment of members of the nobility. The latter charge was probably tailored to the grievances of the young Thomas Mowbray, earl marshal, who held lands in Yorkshire, and whose involvement in the rebellion perhaps represented a filial reaction to the disastrous quarrel between his father, Thomas (I) Mowbray, first duke of Norfolk (<i>d</i>. 1399), and Henry of Lancaster in 1398, which had resulted in his father's death in exile. The general tone of the manifesto had much in common with the calls for better government, in the shape of greater financial and even political accountability, made by the Commons in Henry's parliaments. This line of &#145;responsible&#146; sedition contrasted markedly with the Percys' uncompromising attempts to overthrow a king who had ceased to serve their purposes.<br>
<br>However, it is highly unlikely that Scrope's action at the same time as Northumberland's renewed rebellion was coincidental, and this assumption seems reinforced by the military shortcomings of Scrope's following at York. While it seems agreed that the archbishop marched out of York dressed for combat, the eight or nine thousand townsmen and country-folk who rallied behind his banner had little claim to be regarded as a fighting force. Nevertheless, their militancy virtually destroyed any possibility that they might convince the king of the justness of their cause by peaceful persuasion, yet Scrope and his supporters had no realistic hope of imposing their will by force. The likeliest supposition is that their rising was part of a broader movement in which Northumberland's more militant Yorkshire levies were to have the dominant role. The plan of campaign seems to have been that the earl should make his way down from Northumberland, concentrating recruitment in the Percy strongholds of Cleveland and Topcliffe to the north of York, and those of Tadcaster and Spofforth not far from the city. York was probably designated as the rallying-point for all the Percy forces, which would then march south, inspired by the archbishop's claims on their behalf to the moral high ground against the king.<br>
<br>The relationship between Northumberland and Scrope remains a matter for speculation: was Scrope a straightforward ally of the earl, cynically using his position to mislead people as to the true purpose of the rising; an unworldly cleric deceived as to Northumberland's intentions; or a na&iuml;ve idealist hoping that he could divert the rebellion into more moderate constitutional channels? But one thing is clear. By lending his respected name to the insurrection, Scrope almost single-handedly transformed its image from that of a conflict between the king and an &#145;overmighty subject&#146; to that of a &#145;crusade&#146; for good government.<h2>
<a name="Failureandexecution"></a>Failure and execution</h2>All the same, defeat was guaranteed almost from the start by the failure of Northumberland's attempt to capture Ralph Neville, first earl of Westmorland (<i>d</i>. 1425), the mainstay of royal authority in the north, as an essential prelude to the rising, and by his subsequent northward flight abandoning the gathering rebels to their fate. The three days that Scrope, Mowbray, and Sir Robert Plumpton's son, William, spent with their followers on Shipton Moor, a few miles outside York, represented a desperate period of waiting for reinforcements that never came. On 29 May they were instead confronted by Westmorland and the king's son John, who had already dispersed the leaderless Topcliffe rebels. Scrope's &#145;army&#146; was almost certainly incapable of effective resistance, and he had little alternative but to put himself at Westmorland's mercy. While he may simply have surrendered unconditionally in the hope that he might salvage something from the collapse of the rising, several chroniclers claimed that Westmorland deceived him into disbanding his men in exchange for a promise of favourable consideration of his programme of reform. Even when Westmorland arrested Scrope and his chief lieutenants, the archbishop may have hoped that his ecclesiastical eminence would at least save his life. However, Henry IV soon showed that he was determined to make an example of the rebel archbishop. When the king arrived at Pontefract, where Westmorland had imprisoned Scrope, on 3 June, he refused the archbishop's request for an interview, and the king's half-brother Sir Thomas Beaufort (<i>d</i>. 1427) was sent to seize Scrope's crozier&#151;his symbol of office&#151;a mission only accomplished after a protracted struggle.<br>
<br>With his resolve possibly strengthened by the anti-clericalism of certain of his household knights, the king seems to have decided at an early stage that Scrope must die. It was probably reports of Henry's intentions that prompted Archbishop Arundel to ride day and night from London, in a desperate attempt to forestall the king&#151;an attempt in which insistence on the physical inviolability of an archbishop and counsels of political expediency were perhaps subtly interwoven. His arrival, however, seems to have impelled Henry to strike before reasoned opposition to his resolve had time to develop. On the morning of 8 June, while Henry was reassuring the exhausted Arundel at Scrope's official residence of Bishopthorpe that he would not act rashly, a hastily convened commission headed by Thomas Fitzalan, earl of Arundel (<i>d</i>. 1415) (nephew of the archbishop), and Sir Thomas Beaufort, deputizing for the king's son John and for Westmorland as constable and marshal of England respectively, was sitting in judgment on Scrope and his fellow insurgents in another room of the same building. Since the chief justice, Sir William Gascoigne (<i>d</i>. 1419), had refused to participate in irregular proceedings against Scrope, the minor lawyer Sir William Fulthorpe was assigned the task of condemning him to death for treason. Accepting his fate, according to the chroniclers, with edifying piety and dignity, the archbishop was led through the streets of York to Clementhorpe, just outside the city. Here he was beheaded, it was said, by five blows of the axe representing the five wounds of Christ. He was the first English prelate to suffer judicial execution.<h2>
<a name="Cultandreputation"></a>Cult and reputation</h2>Scrope's body was taken to York Minster to be buried, with the king's consent. Henry's conciliatory gesture in allowing the archbishop to be buried amid his recent supporters soon led to claims that miracles had occurred at his tomb, and a cult of martyr-worship arose that prompted a series of official reactions culminating in September 1406 in the cordoning-off of the tomb with high barriers. Although this popular veneration, with its attendant myth that Henry's execution of Scrope had caused him to be stricken with leprosy, did not develop into a serious threat to the king, it survived to secure official toleration as a more devotional and less seditious cult as part of Henry V's attempts at political conciliation. In the 1450s the promotion of the claim to the throne of Richard, duke of York (<i>d</i>. 1460), led to the representation of Scrope as an early martyr in the cause of Yorkist legitimacy, and an attempt to secure his canonization in 1462, in the wake of Edward IV's accession, was to mark the climax of a political cult, which thereafter seems to have been rendered superfluous by its supporters' success.<br>
<br>A potentially much greater problem for Henry IV was the sentence of excommunication imposed by Pope Innocent VII (<i>r</i>. 1404&#150;6) upon everyone involved in Scrope's execution. However, this solemn edict was reduced to a minor embarrassment when Archbishop Arundel put political stability before clerical outrage and neglected to publish it in England. In 1407 persistent diplomatic efforts combined, according to hostile sources, with generous bribery at the curia, secured Henry a pardon from Innocent's successor Gregory XII (<i>r</i>. 1406&#150;15). Benefiting from the fact that Scrope was at least technically guilty of armed insurrection, Henry had suffered few repercussions from a hasty decision regarded by many contemporaries as sacrilegious and scandalous.<br>
<br>After a long and conventionally successful career in the church, Scrope failed completely both as political reformer and military leader. However, while treating sceptically the chroniclers' simplistic image of the archbishop as a great churchman sacrificed to a noble cause that was essentially his own, historians have tended to give him the benefit of the doubt in suggesting that his motives in 1405 may have been more honourable than those of the self-seeking lords with whom he misguidedly decided to make common cause.<br>
