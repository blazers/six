<span class="headword">Stucley, Sir  Lewis</span>  (1574/5&#150;1620), <span class="occ">local politician</span>, was the son and heir of John Stucley (<i>c</i>.1551&#150;1611) of Affeton, Devon, and Frances (<i>d</i>. in or before 1597), second daughter of Sir John St Leger of Annery. He had two sisters and one brother and four stepsisters and one stepbrother. He matriculated at Broadgates Hall, Oxford, in 1589 aged fourteen and became a student at the Middle Temple in 1592. In 1596 he married Frances (<i>b</i>. 1571), eldest daughter of Anthony Monk of Potheridge; they had five sons and one daughter. Stucley was knighted on 23 July 1603. He did not succeed his father on the bench, possibly because of straitened financial circumstances as he sold his manor of East Worlington in 1614 and that of Thelbridge in 1616. In 1617 he was appointed guardian of Thomas Rolfe, son of Pocahontas and John Rolfe. He purchased the potentially profitable office of vice-admiral of Devon for &pound;600 shortly before Sir Walter Ralegh returned to Plymouth in the <i>Destiny</i> in 1618. This gave him considerable powers over ships entering Devon ports and his deputy had already arrested the <i>Destiny</i> when Stucley received orders, dated 12 June, from the lord admiral, to arrest Ralegh. This was followed by an order from the secretary of the council to bring Ralegh before them, &#145;in fair Manner, and, as his Health would give Leave, by easy Journies to London&#146;  (<span class="italic">Harleian Miscellany</span>, 3.25). It is on his actions in fulfilling this order that his claim to fame, or perhaps more truly infamy, rests.<br>
<br>The report on Ralegh's demeanour states that he attempted to escape to France before he was under guard and that &#145;it was not any Train laid for him by Sir Lewis Stukeley, &hellip; as was voiced, to move or tempt him to an Escape&#146;  (<span class="italic">Harleian Miscellany</span>, 3.25). While Ralegh remained free in Plymouth, Stucley was active selling tobacco from the <i>Destiny</i> and paying off the mariners. This meant that he, Ralegh, and attendants, including Manourie, a French physician, had only got as far as John Drake's house in east Devon by 25 July when Stucley received a council letter rebuking him for his delays and ordering him to bring Sir Walter speedily before them. The party left immediately and reached Salisbury on 27 July. Ralegh admitted, on the scaffold, that he feigned illness at Salisbury. Stucley was taken in by this and sought further medical advice which led to their remaining at Salisbury until 1 August and provided the grounds for Ralegh's being allowed to go to his London house, rather than to the Tower. These delays gave Ralegh the opportunity to prepare his escape. Stucley discovered this intention at Andover and increased the guards on Ralegh, who therefore drew him into his plans for escape. Stucley may have been tempted by financial offers to co-operate but he claimed that he had only done so to unmask Ralegh's intentions, which he betrayed and so caused Ralegh's arrest in the act of escaping and his immediate transfer to the Tower. His duplicity, condemned in Ralegh's speech on the scaffold, turned Sir Lewis into Sir Judas. He received additional obloquy because of his supposed relationship to Ralegh, which depended on his being a nephew of Sir Richard Grenville, who termed Ralegh &#145;cousin&#146;, although there was no blood relationship.<br>
<br>Stucley remained in London, giving information against Ralegh, writing his &#145;Apology&#146; and preparing his &#145;Petition&#146; which was actually written by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25214/', "Leonell Sharpe")</script>. He received &pound;965 6<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. for his services and expenses. His greatest use to the king was as an acceptable target for national discontent at Ralegh's execution. Stucley's reputation suffered further damage when he and his son, Hugh, were imprisoned for clipping coin in January 1619. He was pardoned for this, presumably for his services to the king, but continued to be so vilified that he retired to the island of Lundy where he is reputed to have died, raving mad, in 1620. He was buried at South Molton.<br>
