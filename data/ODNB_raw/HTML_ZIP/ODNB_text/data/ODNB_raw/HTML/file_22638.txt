<span class="headword">Pounds,  John</span>  (1766&#150;1839), <span class="occ">cobbler and ragged-school teacher</span>, was born in St Mary Street, Portsmouth, on 17 June 1766, the son of a naval dockyard sawyer. With little education, Pounds was apprenticed at the age of twelve to a shipwright. The turning point in his life came in 1781 when he was permanently injured by a fall into a dry dock. Left permanently disabled, Pounds resorted to the more sedentary occupation of shoe-mending. From 1803 he lived and worked in a small weatherboarded shop in St Mary Street, one of the poorest parts of Portsmouth, which became famous as one of the first ragged schools. It was estimated that between 1818 and 1839 Pounds provided free schooling for approximately 500 street children.<br>
<br>Pounds's philanthropy was recounted in a long obituary and afterwards inspired anecdotal memoirs and eulogies in Britain and America. In particular, the Scottish philanthropist Thomas Guthrie acknowledged the inspiration of Pounds in his <span class="italic">Pleas for Ragged Schools</span> in 1847, 1849, and 1860. Charles Dickens's portrayal of the schoolmaster in <span class="italic">The Old Curiosity Shop</span> may have been based upon Pounds.<br>
<br>Pounds began his charitable work for outcast children of Portsmouth in 1818, teaching his disabled nephew and a friend to read. While continuing to trade as a cobbler, he possibly taught as many as forty pupils at a time, accepting only the poorest and most ragged. Pounds used an interrogative approach to teach simple <span class="roman">Bible</span> study, morality, reading, writing, arithmetic, and nature study. He taught cookery to the girls and shoe-mending to the boys, and fed and cared for them when they were ill. Pounds's own poverty was illustrated by his use of discarded books, scraps of newspapers, and handbills as teaching aids, although he later accepted books from the local Unitarian High Street Chapel. A Unitarian himself, Pounds encouraged children to attend services and Sunday school at the chapel.<br>
<br>An idealistic oil painting by the journeyman shoemaker H. S. Sheaf, widely distributed in a lithograph engraved by W. S. Charpentier, depicted Pounds with black hair and strong unlined features, surrounded by industrious children. However, Hawkes's memoir probably gives a more accurate picture of Pounds as self-neglected, lame, thin, dirty, and grey haired, with a heavily lined face and a harsh, strident voice. He never married.<br>
<br>Pounds died suddenly on 1 January 1839 at the Portsmouth home of his friend Edward Carter. He was buried in the High Street Chapel graveyard, on 5 January. His fame drew hundreds to his funeral. An inscribed plaque in the chapel and monument on his grave were paid for by subscriptions from Britain and abroad. Portsmouth subsequently established a number of ragged schools in his name.<br>
<br>Pounds was not the founder of ragged schools but was one of a number of working-class pioneers in the early history of the movement. He cared for the bodies, minds, and souls of his pupils, and some aspects of his work can be seen in the later development of the Ragged School Union.<br>
