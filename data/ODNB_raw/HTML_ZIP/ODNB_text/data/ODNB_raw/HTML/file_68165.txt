<span class="headword">Du Cros <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Rees]</span>,  Rosemary Theresa</span>, Lady Du Cros  (1901&#150;1994), <span class="occ">aviator</span>, was born at 2 Walton Street, Brompton, London, on 23 September 1901, the daughter of Sir John David Rees, first baronet (1854&#150;1922), and his wife, Mary Catherine Dormer. She had an older brother, Richard. Having already retired from the Indian Civil Service her father became Conservative MP for East Nottingham, and remained in the House of Commons until his death. Rosemary always maintained that she had no formal education other than that gained from listening to her parents' conversation and from avid reading. However, while living for a short time at Harrow on the Hill she joined the daughters of housemasters at Harrow School for tuition in French, German, and English by visiting governesses. She also attended ballet classes in Chelsea, and later pursued a career as a dancer in revue. For most of the 1920s she travelled the country with concert parties and musical comedies.<br>
<br>In 1932 Rees travelled round the world with her brother, Richard. On their return they renewed acquaintance with Gordon Selfridge junior, a former fellow undergraduate of Richard's at Cambridge. A keen aviator, Selfridge owned an aeroplane and persuaded Rees to have a trial flight. So began her second obsession. Though still dancing she had to decide between the two careers: she chose aviation, and obtained a pilot's licence in 1933. The 1930s were the palmy days of aviation, when the air over Europe was free; aircraft owners could fly to parties given by European aero clubs where they were wined and dined by the local mayors. Having bought a Miles Hawk Major aircraft (to be replaced later by a Miles Whitney Straight) Rees could spend the summers touring and the winters skiing in Europe. In this way she accrued over 600 hours' flying time.<br>
<br>With war on the horizon this hedonistic existence ended in 1938. The Civil Air Guard was formed to train more pilots through subsidies to aero clubs. The need for more instructors gave experienced women pilots, who had previously had little chance of a career in aviation, the opportunity of obtaining an instructor's licence. Having done this Rees was employed by army co-operation; this entailed flying her aircraft to and fro while anti-aircraft gunners practised aiming their guns. For this she was paid &pound;10 per hour.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in 1939 Gerard d'Erlanger, a director of British Overseas Airways Corporation, persuaded the government to make use of experienced civilian pilots not eligible for the armed forces. Forty male pilots were recruited initially to ferry aircraft from the factories to the squadrons in what became the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA). Meanwhile an equally persuasive woman pilot, Pauline Gower, had lobbied on behalf of women. When she was allowed to choose eight pilots to form a small women's section Rees became one of these first eight so-called ATA girls, caught up in an unwelcome storm of publicity and even antagonism from some quarters.<br>
<br>At first cleared only to fly open-cockpit Tiger Moths (the RAF's elementary trainer) in the freezing winter of 1939&#150;40 Rees was far from happy. Yet her situation improved when she was sent to the RAF Central Flying School at Upavon for training on more advanced twin-engine trainers. In July 1941 women were cleared to fly operational aircraft in consequence of the pressing need for more experienced ferry pilots. Rees was one of four women chosen to convert to flying Hurricanes.<br>
<br>In September 1941 no. 15 Ferry Pool, Hamble, became an all-woman pool under the command of Captain Margot Gore, with Flight Captain Rees as her deputy. Rees remained there for the duration of the war, qualifying to fly all five classes of operational aircraft from light singles through to heavy, four-engine bombers. Towards the end of the war she was lucky enough to ferry a Vampire and a Meteor jet aircraft. She was appointed MBE in 1945 for her wartime services and later joined the volunteer reserve of the RAF, gaining her commission.<br>
<br>On leaving the ATA after six and a half years Rees bought a war-surplus Percival Proctor and obtained a commercial flying licence in order to fly for hire and reward. She operated her air-taxi charter firm, Ski Taxi, for five years until increasing post-war bureaucracy and deteriorating eyesight eventually terminated her flying career.<br>
<br>Rees married, as his second wife, Sir Philip Harvey Du Cros, second baronet (1898&#150;1975), at Westminster register office on 3 November 1950 and went to live with him in Parkham, north Devon, where he was an active member of the Torrington parliamentary constituency. She involved herself in politics and became chairman of the Bideford area Conservative Association. Her husband died in 1975, but she remained mentally and physically active well into old age. She died at Little Bocombe, Parkham, on 8 March 1994, aged ninety-two.<br>
