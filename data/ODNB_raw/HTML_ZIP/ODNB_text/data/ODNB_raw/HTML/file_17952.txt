<span class="headword">Manners,  Edward</span>, third earl of Rutland  (1549&#150;1587), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was born on 12 July 1549, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17955/', "Henry Manners, second earl of Rutland (1526&#150;1563)")</script>, and Margaret Neville (<i>d</i>. 1559). His education befitted a nobleman. His father's death from the plague in 1563 made him the queen's ward, and his education was continued by William Cecil, to whom he said he was greatly beholden. In his teenage years he accompanied Queen Elizabeth on her visit to Cambridge in 1564 where he was lodged in St John's College. At Oxford in October 1566 a committee was established to award him an honorary MA on account of his &#145;singular benevolence&#146;, although it is unclear whether the degree was conferred.<br>
<br>As a nobleman with extensive northern estates, Rutland was sent with his tenants to assist Sussex against the 1569 northern insurgents, and served as lieutenant-general of footmen. He was called &#145;into council whenever they treat of any matter&#146; and praised for his courage and forwardness. On his return Sadler said to Cecil: &#145;God has given him good parts and you have instructed him in honesty, it were a pity they should sleep in him for lack of employment&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>addenda</i>, <i>1566&#150;79</i>, 163). He travelled in France between January and October 1571, sending Burghley his impressions. On his return he decided to marry Isabel Holcroft (1552&#150;1605). Her mother wrote in January 1572 &#145;she says that you will marry her whether I give anything or no&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 1.96). A later rumour spoke of &pound;4000 and 200 marks a year passing with a &#145;maid of the court&#146;. The marriage took place in mid-1573.<br>
<br>Rutland held no major office in a life shortened by illnesses which included gout. He was a member of the council of the north by 1574 but &#145;not bound to continued attendance unless required by the president&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>addenda</i>, <i>1566&#150;79</i>, 463). On 17 June 1577 he was appointed to the ecclesiastical commission for the north. The queen apparently thought highly of him, but he rarely went to court unless summoned, despite her expressed hopes of his service&#151;and the possibility that she had designated him as Sir Thomas Bromley's successor as lord chancellor in 1587. Made a knight of the Garter on 23 April 1584, he soon returned home despite letters telling him Elizabeth expected him at court. In 1585 his excuses were rejected and he had to attend the parliament.<br>
<br>Rutland preferred life as a great magnate in his own country, occupied with the local defence of the realm, dividing his time between Belvoir and Newark, and serving as lord lieutenant (of Nottinghamshire by 1574 and of Lincolnshire by 1581) and commissioner for subsidies and musters. In 1571 he was feodary of the duchy of Lancaster for Nottingham and Derby, and he held the traditional family offices of constable of Nottingham Castle and warden of Sherwood Forest. Holles described him as &#145;That magnificent earl who kept an house like a Prince's Court&#146;  (Holles, 215). He kept great state and open hospitality at Belvoir, although his father's remarriage had severely diminished his resources; his stepmother, who lived until 1601, held much of the Rutland inheritance. He had to sell some manors, and was only starting to buy lands again just before his death. Much of his time was absorbed by estate management which included his interest in lead mining and cloth working. Despite his standing, he became embroiled in local feuds with Thomas Markham, John Foster, and the Talbots. He used his patronage for his many clients and &#145;his&#146; towns and maintained local harmony as far as possible, occasionally arbitrating suits involving other nobles. His uncle, Roger Manners, served as his main link to the court and his brother John managed the northern estates, rebuilding Helmsley Castle and breeding great horses.<br>
<br>Rutland was acutely sensitive to his honour. Contemporaries spoke of him as wise, learned, godly, and honourable. He was also a scholar, interested in legal matters rather than physical sports and pastimes, although in 1580 he acquitted himself well at the Westminster tilts. He was selected in 1586 as the &#145;man of honor&#146; for the treaty with the Scots at Berwick. He was reluctant to go, and even more reluctant to stay when the Scots started raising difficulties, thinking his honour adversely affected. He stayed until 6 July when the treaty of Berwick was signed and then unwillingly went to court. The Babington plot had just broken, and on 21 September 1586 he was instructed to be at Westminster on the 27th and then to go to Fotheringhay to hear the queen of Scots's case.<br>
<br>By early April 1587 Rutland was ill at Greenwich, and he died on the 14th of that month. James VI was said to be sorely grieved at his death. His funeral, at Bottesford, Leicestershire, on 15 May, was costly, and his death aggravated the family's financial problems. His only daughter, Elizabeth, inherited the barony of Ros, married Sir William Cecil, and died in 1591. Her son William, born in May or June 1590, was confirmed in the barony of Ros in 1616 and died in 1618. Rutland's brother John became fourth earl. The property division was complicated by the legacies which Edward had made to his wife. His executors were John himself, Roger, and Thomas Manners and Sir George Chaworth; but on John's own death on 24 February 1588 the others withdrew as executors, leaving Elizabeth, John's widow, the problems of both wills. In 1590 Garret Johnson was paid &pound;200 for two tombs including four great pictures erected at Bottesford, Leicestershire, for Edward and John.<br>
