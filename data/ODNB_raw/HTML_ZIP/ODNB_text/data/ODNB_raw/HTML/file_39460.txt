<span class="headword">Fl&uuml;rscheim <span class="st"> [Flurscheim]</span>,  Bernhard Jacques</span>  (1874&#150;1955), <span class="occ">organic and theoretical chemist</span>, was born at Baden-Baden on 27 November 1874, the son of Michael Fl&uuml;rscheim (<i>d</i>. 1904), an engineer and socialist who published several books on economics in English, and Marie-Am&eacute;lie Heilbronne (<i>d</i>. 1891). His mother was French; his parents had met during the Franco-Prussian War. His maternal grandmother had been attached to the court of Louis-Philippe and it was the inheritance of her French estates that made him and his sister, Helen, financially independent. He received a classical education at schools in Baden-Baden and at Arnold College, Bournemouth, in England, before, at the age of seventeen, studying metallurgy and engineering at Winterthur, Switzerland, and Brunswick in Germany. At the age of twenty he switched to chemistry, studying successively at the universities of Z&uuml;rich, where he took his first degree with Alfred Werner (1866&#150;1919), Geneva, Heidelberg (with F. Kehrmann and E. Knoevenagel), where he obtained the PhD in 1901, and finally at Strasbourg with Johannes Thiele (1865&#150;1918).<br>
<br>In 1902, while in Strasbourg, Fl&uuml;rscheim married Nora Kathleen Marie (<i>d</i>. 1973), a talented painter and the only daughter of Henry Northover, farmer, of Fonthill, Wiltshire. They had a son, Cedric Harold, an electrical engineer, and a daughter. In 1905 the couple settled at Crookham, Fleet, Hampshire, where he built a house and separate laboratory in woodland that reminded him of his boyhood in the Black Forest. He joined the Chemical Society in 1906, publishing his work both in English and German journals. He spent the remainder of his life in Fleet apart from a period in America during the First World War, and two periods as a visiting unpaid research worker in the Davy&#150;Faraday laboratories at the Royal Institution, London, 1905&#150;7 and 1925&#150;8.<br>
<br>Fl&uuml;rscheim was described by C. K. Ingold as &#145;the last of the great pre-electronic builders of the theory of organic chemistry&#146;  (Ingold, <span class="italic">Journal of the Chemical Society</span>, 1087). In a German paper of 1902, which was inspired by Werner's and Thiele's ideas on the divisibility of affinity among atoms in a compound, Fl&uuml;rscheim speculated that a substituent in a carbon compound caused the distribution of affinities to alternate through a chain of carbon atoms such that different positions became vulnerable to attack by other substituents. He developed a symbolism of thick and thin lines (bonds) to indicate strengthened and weakened affinities, and over the following decades showed how the theory explained the mechanisms of many familiar reactions. In 1904, while engaged in work directed at proving the theory, or resolving its difficulties, he discovered the explosive tetranitroaniline, which he patented as TNA in 1910 (patent nos. 3224, 3907). In 1915, at Lord Moulton's request, Fl&uuml;rscheim went to America to supervise the manufacture of his explosive by Aetna, but came to regret that the discovery, which further increased his wealth, had forced him into commerce. During the 1920s he was active in debates over the emerging electronic theory of chemical reactions. While glad of Ingold's support for his theoretical insights, which Ingold thought superior to those of Robert Robinson, Fl&uuml;rscheim stubbornly refused to accept the shared electron theory of the chemical bond. Realizing that the electronic theory of valency had replaced his theoretical insights, he abandoned research in 1932.<br>
<br>As a private research worker in an era dominated by academic and industrial science, Fl&uuml;rscheim remains an enigmatic figure; nevertheless he was an individual who had an important influence on twentieth-century theoretical chemistry. He took English nationality, but was not very sociable outside his family circle, though he loved travelling and alpine climbing. He was well read and retained a love of classical languages. Although politically Conservative, in the 1930s he spoke out concerning the Nazi threat, and advocated a military alliance with the Russians. He died at the Trimmers Hospital, Farnham, on 15 June 1955.<br>
