<span class="headword">Woodhull,  Victoria  Claflin</span> <span class="st"> [<em>other married name </em>Victoria  Woodhull Martin]</span>  (1838&#150;1927), <span class="occ">women's rights campaigner and first female presidential candidate in the United States of America</span>, was born Victoria California Allen Claflin on 23 September 1838 in the town of Homer, Licking county, Ohio. She was the fifth of seven children of Reuben Buckman (Buck) Claflin (1795/6&#150;1885), a local gristmill owner, and his wife Roxanna (Anna), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hummel (1803/4&#150;1889). Victoria's mother was interested in clairvoyance and took her children with her to religious revivals and camp meetings. Two of Victoria's brothers, Hebern and Maldon, became printers; one of her sisters, Tennessee Celeste Claflin (1845&#150;1923), known as Tennie C, was inseparable from Victoria and shared her life in both America and Britain.<h2>
<a name="EarlyLife"></a>Early Life</h2>Details of Victoria's early life are not plentiful; later on her biography is cluttered with stories, accusations and myths that are difficult to disentangle from the truth. As a child she received a very limited and infrequent education at the local Methodist church school in Homer. When her father's mill burnt down in suspicious circumstances&#151;it was said that he wanted the insurance payment&#151;the family was forced to leave town and commenced many years of wandering together as an itinerant medical show. As a member of the troupe Victoria was variously described as a &#145;medical clairvoyant&#146; and &#145;magnetic healer&#146; who told fortunes, held s&eacute;ances, and sold patent medicines. Later she would develop a genuine and lasting interest in spiritualism.<br>
<br>Aged fifteen, in November 1853 she married Canning (or Channing) Woodhull, originally of Rochester, New York, and then a physician licensed in Ohio. They had two children together, Byron (1854&#150;1932), who was born disabled, and Zulu Maud, later known as Zula (1861&#150;1940). Canning Woodhull was an alcoholic and womanizer and the marriage was dissolved in 1865. Victoria then married in 1866 Colonel James Harvey Blood (<i>d</i>. 1885), a Union army officer who had fought in the American Civil War, which had just ended. There were no children and this marriage also ended in divorce ten years later, but in the intervening decade Blood helped his bride become the most notorious woman in America.<h2>
<a name="NewYork"></a>New York</h2>Woodhull and Blood moved to New York City with other members of the extended Claflin family in 1868. Woodhull threw herself into metropolitan social life and also into the related causes of suffragism and social reform. Women had played significant roles on the home front during the American Civil War and the conflict had further stimulated the development of an American women's movement. In the aftermath of the war the problematic legal and political status of the emancipated slaves in the south led to an extended national debate on the nature and attributes of citizenship and to the amendment of the federal constitution to protect black civil rights. Feminists and women's suffragists were part of the debate, arguing that they also deserved political and social equality. The late 1860s thus saw the development of the alliances, organizations, and arguments that would be used in the pursuit of women's suffrage for the rest of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Woodhull was drawn to this exciting political milieu, but first she needed money and connections. Assisted by Blood's astute management she used her charm and talents to make herself known to some of the most influential figures in the city. Her chief benefactor and admirer was the great railroad promoter, Cornelius (&#145;Commodore&#146;) Vanderbilt, who was recently widowed and interested in spiritualism. He helped Woodhull in successful speculations in the gold market in 1869 and with the profits from this she and Tennessee opened the first firm of female Wall Street stock brokers under the name Woodhull, Claflin &amp; Co.<br>
<br>Known as the &#145;queens of finance&#146; and the &#145;bewitching brokers&#146; the sisters were already objects of public curiosity when, on 14 May 1870, the first number of the <span class="italic">Woodhull and Claflin Weekly</span> was published, its masthead declaring it to be &#145;The Organ of the Most Advanced Thought and Purpose in the World!&#146;. Published for the next six years in New York, the <span class="italic">Weekly</span> was a scandal sheet that openly discussed and advocated sexual equality, free love, sex education, dress reform, women's suffrage and employment, and the eight-hour day, and even supported legalized prostitution. It was edited by Woodhull's husband and by Stephen Pearl Andrews, a social reformer who wrote many of her lectures and articles. On 30 December 1871 the first complete English translation of the <span class="italic">Communist Manifesto</span> was published in its pages. Woodhull linked labour and sexual reform together and with her sister was a leader of the women's section of the International Workingmen's Association, the Marxist First International, which had been established in London in 1864 and moved its headquarters to New York in 1872. Part feminist, part socialist, and adept at uncovering financial scandals on Wall Street, <span class="italic">Woodhull and Claflin's Weekly</span> was also a vehicle for Woodhull's self-promotion. In it she set out her ideas on what she termed &#145;social freedom&#146; or the right of all women as well as men to determine their own manner of life, free from social, religious or legal barriers.<br>
<br>On 2 November 1872 <span class="italic">Woodhull and Claflin's Weekly</span> published intimate details of the affair between the most famous clergyman in America, Henry Ward Beecher, and Elizabeth, the wife of Theodore Tilton, a member of Beecher's New York congregation and his personal friend, with whom Woodhull herself was having an affair. Beecher had condemned Woodhull's advocacy of free love from his pulpit and was suspected of inciting more general criticism of her; she responded by unmasking a hypocrite. In what became the most sensational episode of the 1870s in America, Beecher was subsequently sued by Tilton for the &#145;alienation of affection&#146; of his wife.<h2>
<a name="Candidateforpresident1872"></a>Candidate for president, 1872</h2>Woodhull announced her candidacy for the presidency of the United States in a letter to the <span class="italic">New York Herald</span> on 2 April 1870. There followed a series of articles setting out her views which were written by Andrews and published in the following year under Woodhull's name in the most important of her publications, <span class="italic">The Origins, Tendencies, and Principles of Government</span>. In 1870 and 1871 she played leading roles in the second and third annual conventions of the National Women's Suffrage Association, established in 1869 by Elizabeth Cady Stanton. She followed Stanton as the second woman to petition Congress in person when, on 11 January 1871, she argued before the judiciary committee of the house of representatives that women, as citizens of the United States, already had the right to vote under the terms of the fourteenth amendment, which had been ratified in 1868. This argument, commonly deployed by the American women's movement at this time, was rejected by the United States Supreme Court in <i>Minor v. Happersett</i> in 1875: according to the justices women were indeed citizens, but voting was a privilege granted by each state and not a universal women's right. Woodhull dramatized the denial of women's rights when, having got herself on the electoral register, she was prevented from voting in a municipal election in New York in 1871: <span class="italic">Harper's Weekly</span> printed a half-page illustration of &#145;Mrs Woodhull Asserting her Right to Vote&#146;.<br>
<br>In the following year, on 10 May at a convention she had organized herself in the Apollo Hall, New York, attended by 1500 people, many of them well-to-do, Woodhull was nominated for president of the United States by the Equal Rights Party, the first woman ever to run for president. Although he never accepted the nomination, the former escaped slave, anti-slavery lecturer, and black leader Frederick Douglass was to be her running mate for vice-president in a move designed to heal the divisions that had opened up after the Civil War between the women's movement and abolitionists over the relative importance of black and women's suffrage. Her platform included women's right to vote, to employment, and to free love, as well as land nationalization, the regulation of prices and profits, and the more equal distribution of the fruits of labour. In an age when political parties were responsible for printing and distributing ballots, Victoria Woodhull's candidacy appeared only on ballots handed out by the Equal Rights Party.<br>
<br>Woodhull and her supporters held that as a citizen she could run for and hold public office even if no state in the union then granted female suffrage. At just under thirty-five years of age in November 1872 she actually breached the constitutional requirement of the minimum age for president. There is no evidence that she received any popular votes at all. When the suffragist Susan B. Anthony tried to vote in the elections in conformity with the National Women's Suffrage Association's policy of attempting to storm the polls, she was arrested. (At her subsequent trial the judge directed a guilty verdict without letting Anthony speak.) Nor did Woodhull secure any vote in the electoral college. She went on to seek nomination for the presidency on another four occasions in the late nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Ironically, on the day of the election Victoria and Tennessee were locked in Ludlow Street jail, New York, on a charge of sending obscene mail through the federal posts. This related to the unmasking of Beecher. The sisters were subsequently rearrested several times and tried on various counts. Though they were acquitted of all charges the prohibitive costs of the legal proceedings were financially ruinous. By now Woodhull's fortunes were in decline in all senses. Ever since her adoption as a candidate for the presidency she had been an object of scorn, easily wounded because of her scandalous opinions, notorious liaisons, and the unconventional behaviour of the Claflin family around her. Many leading suffragists considered her an unpredictable liability, all the more so because of her outspoken sympathy for the labour movement and association with socialists. Harriet Beecher Stowe satirized her as Miss Audacia Dangereyes in her novel <span class="italic">My wife and I, or, Harry Henderson's History</span> (1872). She had long been known as &#145;the Woodhull&#146;; soon it became Wicked Woodhull, and the cartoonist Thomas Nast turned on her and presented her in <span class="italic">Harpers' Weekly</span> (17 Feb 1872) as Mrs Satan, who tempted good women out of marriage.<h2>
<a name="England"></a>England</h2>
<span class="italic">Woodhull and Claflin's Weekly</span> ceased publication in June 1876 and in October Victoria divorced Colonel Blood. In the following year Vanderbilt died and the two sisters, their mother, and Victoria's children left for England in August 1877; they settled at Warwick Road, South Kensington, London. They were joined by Victoria's father who, like the rest of her immediate family, spent his final years in England. It was said that the sisters had come to a financial agreement with Vanderbilt's heirs, who paid for their relocation to prevent a challenge to the Commodore's will. Victoria resumed lecturing in England, going on a provincial tour in September 1877, but though she discussed some of her favourite topics&#151;religion and the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, spiritualism, marriage and sexual responsibility&#151;she adopted a more restrained manner and advanced more decorous opinions in the attempt to establish a fresh reputation in her new country.<br>
<br>
<a href="#cosubject_98232">John Biddulph Martin [<i>see below</i>]</a>, the banker, was in the audience at one of Woodhull's first London lectures (&#145;The human body, the temple of God&#146;), in December 1877. Despite his family's objections they were married at South Kensington Presbyterian Church on 31 October 1883, and set up home at 17 Hyde Park Gate, London. Thereafter she was known as Victoria Woodhull Martin. Tennessee was equally successful in the marriage market, marrying the widower <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32541/', "Sir Francis Cook, baronet")</script>, a wealthy merchant and art collector, of Doughty House, Richmond Hill, Surrey, on 1 October 1885. (And in 1903 Utica Celestina Welles, the daughter of the sisters' niece, married the composer and heir to the Beecham pharmaceutical company, Thomas Beecham.)<br>
<br>The sisters faced criticism and opprobrium in England as in America. Henry James's novella <span class="italic">The Siege of London</span> (1882) was read by many as a fictionalized account of Victoria Woodhull's campaign to woo and win her third husband. Angered by constant public references to her past, in February 1894 Victoria Woodhull Martin and her husband brought an action for libel against the trustees and the librarian of the British Museum for making available to readers two pamphlets in the library on the Beecher&#150;Tilton affair that were admitted to be libels against her. The action was an opportunity for Victoria publicly to clear her name, but the court's judgment was for the British Museum. She and Tennessee were largely accepted into the higher social circles in England, and this time they suffered no precipitous fall in reputation or fortune. Retaining her American citizenship, she sought nomination to the presidency in 1892, and between 1892 and 1901 she and her daughter Zula published the <span class="italic">Humanitarian</span> magazine, in which they promoted their nostrums, now including selective breeding among a range of eugenic ideas.<br>
<br>Widowed in 1897, Victoria Woodhull Martin inherited a substantial estate, her husband having survived his own father by only three days. In 1901 she and Zula moved to a country estate, Norton Park, Bredon's Norton, Worcestershire, which her father-in-law had gifted to her late husband in 1892. Featured in <span class="italic">Country Life</span> (14 June 1902), she engaged in local educational and rural philanthropy, but ceased any involvement in women's suffrage or purity campaigns. A particular enthusiasm was for a scheme to develop a women's agricultural community at Bredon's Norton, renting out small plots of land to allow women to learn the rudiments of farming. She was one of the earliest motor car owners in Britain, driving a Mercedes Simplex and undertaking motoring tours in Britain and France, and was a founder member of the Ladies Automobile Club (1904). Having long urged that the fourth of July should be celebrated as Interdependence Day, she became a leading promoter of Anglo-American links, active in plans to mark the centenary (December 1914) of the treaty of Ghent. One outcome was the purchase of Sulgrave Manor, the ancestral home of George Washington in Northamptonshire, to which she donated &pound;1000. She supported the Anglo-American Society in its commission and erection of a copy of Augustus Saint-Gaudens's statue of Abraham Lincoln (<span class="italic">The Standing Lincoln</span>, 1887), situated in Lincoln Park, Chicago, in Parliament Square, Westminster, in July 1920. She also offered $5000 to the first person to fly the Atlantic.<br>
<br>Having outlived her younger sister, Tennessee Claflin, who died in London (as the dowager Lady Cook) in January 1923, Victoria Woodhull Martin died at Norton Park on 9 June 1927. After cremation at Birmingham crematorium her ashes were scattered over the mid-Atlantic. She bequeathed her estate to her daughter Zula Maud Woodhull who, in memory of her mother and shortly before her own death at Norton Park on 12 September 1940, purchased property near Tewkesbury Abbey, enabling the demolition of a wall that had previously obscured the public's view of the abbey. Also at Zula's instigation, a memorial plaque to her mother was unveiled in Tewkesbury Abbey in July 1943, paying tribute to her as &#145;An American citizen long resident in this neighbourhood who devoted herself unsparingly to all that could promote the great cause of Anglo-American friendship&#146;.<br>
<br>Victoria Woodhull died an honoured member of her adopted country and community in a life of two quite distinct halves. That she was able to recreate herself so successfully in England after such notoriety and ignominy in America was tribute to her remarkable adaptability and force of personality. Though it may be tempting to dismiss her as a self-serving curiosity, her life in New York in the late 1860s and 1870s helps illuminate a seminal stage in the history of American feminism and radicalism when many of the arguments for women's emancipation and the modes of achieving it, including running for president, were first tried and tested by determined and bold women. Among them Victoria Woodhull was probably the most courageous and also the most brazen.<br>
<br>Her third husband, <a name="cosubject_98232"></a><span class="headword">John Biddulph Martin</span>  (1841&#150;1897), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born at 21 Eaton Square, London, on 10 June 1841, the younger son in the family of two sons and two daughters of Robert Martin (1808&#150;1897) of Overbury Court near Tewkesbury, a partner in the famous Grasshopper bank at 68 Lombard Street, London, and his wife, Mary Ann (<i>d</i>. 1892), daughter of John Biddulph of the banking firm of Cocks, Biddulph &amp; Co. Educated at Harrow School (1854&#150;9) and Exeter College, Oxford (BA, 1862; MA, 1867), he became a partner in the family bank, which was known as Martin's Bank from 1891. His interest in the career of Victoria Woodhull was said to have arisen from the views of women's rights held by his sister Penelope, who died after childbirth in 1873, and to whom he was especially close. President of the London Athletic Club, he was also a prominent figure in literary and scientific London, belonging to the Society of Arts, Political Economy Club, the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies. In 1896 he was president of the Royal Statistical Society, to which he contributed papers on electoral statistics, the banking crisis of 1879, and gold currency. He wrote several pamphlets on the theory of banking and the nature of money and one, published in 1884, on <span class="italic">The Future of the United States</span>. He published a history of the bank, <span class="italic">The Grasshopper in Lombard Street</span>, in 1892. Among his philanthropic activities he was treasurer of the Charing Cross and Royal Orthopaedic hospitals. He died of pneumonia at Hotel Santa Catalina, Las Palmas, Grand Canary, on 20 March 1897 and was cremated on 6 April at Woking crematorium. His elder brother, Sir Richard Biddulph Martin, baronet (1838&#150;1916), of Overbury Court, chairman of Martin's Bank and a founder of the Institute of Bankers, sat as Liberal MP for Tewkesbury (1880&#150;5) and as a Liberal Unionist for Droitwich (1892&#150;1906), being created a baronet in December 1905. Both brothers died childless, and the baronetcy became extinct.<br>
