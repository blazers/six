<span class="headword">Baker,  Philip</span>  (1522/3&#150;1590?), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born in Barnstaple, Devon, of a gentry family, and educated at Eton College. Admitted to King's College, Cambridge, in 1540, aged seventeen, he was a fellow in 1543&#150;56, graduated BA in 1544&#150;5, MA in 1548, BTh in 1554, and DTh in 1562. He was a proctor of the university in 1549&#150;50, was appointed provost of King's College by Elizabeth I in 1558, and was vice-chancellor in 1561&#150;2. He was ordained deacon in 1553 and was appointed as rector of Ringwood, Hampshire (1554), rector of St Andrew by the Wardrobe, London (1559&#150;62), prebendary of Stretton, Salisbury (1559), prebendary of Putston Minor, Hereford (1560), rector of Elsworth, Cambridgeshire (1559&#150;70), and possibly rector of Winwick, Lancashire. In 1564 Queen Elizabeth visited Cambridge and stayed in the provost's lodge for five days: Baker was one of those who made a formal speech in her presence.<br>
<br>The following year, 1565, eleven fellows of King's complained that Baker favoured &#145;papists&#146; and administered the affairs of the college badly. His opinions must have been widely known, as he had been deprived of the living of St Andrew by the Wardrobe in 1562 for his refusal to subscribe to a confession of faith. The bishop of Lincoln made a visitation in response to the complaints of the fellows and Baker was required to suppress &#145;popish&#146; ceremonies and ornaments in the college. In 1567 the college granted him leave of absence for two years. In 1569 a Mr Colpots made a further protest to the chancellor, William Cecil, on behalf of the college; Baker &#145;still kept a great heap of Popish pelf &hellip; he never preached, neither at home, nor abroad, weltring in idleness, and wholly serving Mammon &hellip; <i>Pistori quam Pastori similior</i>: i.e. more like a baker than a shepherd&#146;  (Strype, 144). Baker does indeed seem to have been absent from the college a great deal during his period in office. Detailed charges were also made that he had appropriated college funds.<br>
<br>As a result of these accusations a new visitation was commissioned, led by the bishop of Ely; Baker did not wait to face it but fled abroad. In 1570 he was formally deprived of the provostship and his other preferments. Although one of the charges levelled against him had been that he dishonestly used college resources, Fuller went out of his way to praise the way in which Baker on his departure meticulously returned all college property. He may have returned to England: although Willis states that &#145;he retired to Louvain, and died there beyond the seas&#146;  (Willis, 2.600), two somewhat contradictory pieces of evidence indicate otherwise. Sterry states that it was Philip Baker, the former provost, who made a will in 1585, died in London in 1590, and was buried in St Margaret Moyses on 12 August; the will was certainly made by a former Catholic priest who left a few small bequests, but it makes no reference to Cambridge. However, in Cambridge University Library there is a four-volume collection of commentaries on St Thomas Aquinas by Gregory of Valentia (1549&#150;1603), a Jesuit theologian, in an edition printed in Venice between 1598 and 1601; an inscription records that it was a gift to the university from Philip Baker, formerly provost of King's College. Baker's arms were argent on a saltire engrailed sable, five escallops of the field on a chief of the second a lion passant of the first.<br>
