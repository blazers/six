<span class="headword">Deacon,  Thomas</span>  (1697&#150;1753), <span class="occ">bishop of the nonjuring Church of England and physician</span>, was born on 2 September 1697 at Stepney, Middlesex, the son of William Deacon (<i>d</i>. 1706), a mariner, and his wife, Cecelia (<i>fl</i>. 1697&#150;1733). Lacking a university education, by early adulthood he had become an accomplished writer and had mastered Greek, Latin, French, and possibly Hebrew. The nonjuror George Hickes, who took a paternal interest in Thomas, may have directed his education.<br>
<br>Deacon's mother, who may have married the nonjuring bishop <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5917/', "Jeremy Collier")</script> (1716), introduced her son, while still a child, to Jacobitism and such leading nonjurors as Hickes and Collier. Ordained by Collier to the priesthood on 19 March 1716, the eighteen-year-old cleric's first public appearance as a nonjuror came at the execution of William Paul and John Hall in 1716. He denied offering absolution to the two Jacobites, but he did admit to writing the strongly worded Jacobite speeches given by the two men on the gallows. It is most likely that he also ministered to the prisoners in private. After a trip to the Netherlands in 1717 he returned to study medicine with Richard Mead (1673&#150;1754), one of England's most distinguished physicians. In London he served as the minister of the nonjuring congregation at Aldersgate and as assistant at Robert Orme's Trinity Chapel.<br>
<br>Deacon moved to Manchester about 1722, where he became a leading physician. At this time also he married Sarah (<i>b</i>. 1700?, <i>d</i>. 1745), about whom further details are unknown. They resided on Fennel Street, a short distance from the collegiate church and Chetham's Library, and had twelve children, two of whom died in infancy.<br>
<br>While Manchester had a significant Jacobite community and Deacon was the leading nonjuring figure in the city, the extent of his Jacobite activities remains unclear. The Presbyterian Josiah Owen, in a series of letters published in 1746 in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, charged Deacon with having both popish and Jacobite sympathies, offering absolution to William Paul and John Hall on the gallows in 1716, fleeing for the Netherlands with warrants issued against him, and then living &#145;unmolested&#146; in Manchester. He suggested that three of Deacon's sons had served at their father's behest in the Manchester regiment in 1745, that Deacon himself had received a dispensation from serving from Charles Edward, and that he had been escorted to the &#145;Pretender's lodgings&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 16.69, 579). Of the three sons in question, Thomas Theodorus (<i>c</i>.1723&#150;1746), a captain in the Manchester regiment, was executed at Tyburn; Robert Renatus (<i>c</i>.1725&#150;1746), a lieutenant, died in prison awaiting trial; while Charles Clement (<i>c</i>.1727&#150;1749), ensign, died in Jamaica after being transported. Deacon denied most of Owen's charges in 1748, at which time he replied that he had indeed lived unmolested if by that Owen meant being attacked by mobs, detained by soldiers, and living in fear that his house would be brought down  (ibid., 18.206).<br>
<br>Though Jacobite in sympathy, Deacon's primary attention was given to the creation of a separate nonjuring Church of England. He took an extreme view of the church's independence from the state and did not consider reunion with the established Church of England to be possible or desirable. His &#145;ideal was always the creation of an Orthodox Catholic Church separate from both England and Rome&#146;, while his Jacobitism was a &#145;secondary matter&#146;  (Broxap, <span class="italic">Biography</span>, 140&#150;41, 147). With Thomas Brett, Collier, and Roger Laurence, he was a member of the usagers party, which called for the restoration of four ceremonies: the invocation of the Holy Spirit, the oblation, the mixed chalice, and the prayers for the dead. Believing that these items had been wrongly omitted from the prayer book of 1552, in 1718 Deacon and Thomas Brett drafted a new liturgy. This attempted to be true to the liturgical principles of the early church and to restore the four usages. Though many nonjurors believed that the usages were desirable, they did not wish to obstruct the possibility of a future return to the Church of England. The usagers party, however, insisted that tradition required their inclusion for an efficacious eucharist. Deacon remained adamant about these principles and refused to join in the reunion of the two parties engineered in 1732 by Brett and George Smith of Durham. The usagers party maintained their existence after 1732 when the Scottish bishop Archibald Campbell, acting alone, consecrated Deacon and Laurence as bishops of what had now become the Orthodox British church in 1733. In 1734 Deacon issued his <span class="italic">Compleat Collection of Devotions</span>, which included a new liturgy, &#145;The order of the divine offices of the Orthodox British church&#146;. Following Campbell's death in 1744, this replaced the liturgy of 1718. Modelled on the liturgies found in the <span class="italic">Apostolic Constitutions</span>, it sought to restore even more primitive usages, including infant communion. Thus, Deacon's new liturgy fulfilled the &#145;warning prophecy&#146; given by the critics of the 1718 session that if one returned to &#145;<i>some</i> primitive customs, others would follow&#146;  (Grisbrooke, 117&#150;18). Others note that, by attempting to create a liturgy true to the earliest Christian liturgies and by reclaiming for the Anglican tradition the primitive doctrine of eucharistic sacrifice, Deacon's work brought to maturity the work of earlier scholars from Jeremy Taylor to William Whiston  (Cuming, 186). The <span class="italic">Compleat Collection</span> is notable also for its inclusion of excerpts from John Wesley's &#145;Essay upon the stationary fasts&#146;. John Clayton, a member of Wesley's Oxford group and a native of Manchester, introduced Wesley to Deacon. Deacon requested Wesley's help in the preparation of his collection of devotions and Wesley &#145;returned from this visit thoroughly fired with zeal both for the ancient church and for the stations&#146;  (Baker, 31).<br>
<br>In 1747 Deacon published his most significant work, <span class="italic">A Full, True, and Comprehensive View of Christianity</span>, which provided two catechisms for teaching the primitive faith and a detailed theological commentary on his <span class="italic">Compleat Collection of Devotions</span>. Deacon also set out the theological suppositions for his liturgical work and explained the doctrines of the &#145;Orthodox British Catholic Church&#146;. He also made clear his understanding of the sacraments, which went beyond the Anglican two sacraments, to include twelve offices, such as confirmation, marriage, ordination, and infant communion. His other writings included <span class="italic">The Doctrine of the Church of Rome Concerning Purgatory</span> (1718), which sought to distinguish between prayers for the dead and the doctrine of purgatory, thereby defending the nonjurors against charges of popery. He also translated two works by the French Jansenist Sebastian le Nain de Tillemont (with whom Deacon had much in common theologically), the translations appearing as <span class="italic">History of the Arians</span> (1721) and <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical Memoirs of the First Six Centuries</span> (1733, 1735).<br>
<br>In his later years Deacon encountered financial and physical difficulties. His friend the poet John Byrom wrote to William Law in 1752 noting that Deacon could no longer care for himself or his children. He died on 16 February 1753 and was buried on 19 February in Manchester at St Anne's churchyard alongside his wife, who had predeceased him on 4 July 1745. Deacon was survived by three sons, including Edward Erastus (<i>c</i>.1741&#150;1813), surgeon, and a daughter, Sarah Sophia (1731&#150;1801), who married William Cartwright, nonjuring bishop and Shrewsbury apothecary.<br>
