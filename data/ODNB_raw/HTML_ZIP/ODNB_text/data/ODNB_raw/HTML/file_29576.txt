<span class="headword">Willibrord</span> <span class="st"> [St Willibrord]</span>  (657/8&#150;739), <span class="occ">missionary, archbishop of the Frisians, and abbot of Echternach</span>, was born in the southern Northumbrian kingdom of Deira, the son of Wilgils and an unnamed mother.<h2>
<a name="Originsandupbringing"></a>Origins and upbringing</h2>Any account of Willibrord's origins and early life depends entirely on his earliest biographer, Alcuin (735&#150;804), whose life of Willibrord was written <i>c</i>.796 at the behest of Beornred (<i>d</i>. 797), archbishop of Sens, abbot of Echternach, and a relative of Willibrord. It is far from objective. Alcuin probably drew on an earlier life of Willibrord written by an Irishman and now lost, but he was also the heir of Willibrord both actually, for he too was a relative (of unknown degree) and the inheritor of Wilgils's monastery in Northumbria, and conceptually, as a Northumbrian who gained an authoritative spiritual stature in the Frankish kingdom and enjoyed the patronage of the Carolingian dynasty. Under the influence of these associations, combined with his aspiration to write classicizing hagiography, Alcuin produced a presentation of Willibrord as an ideal type, the &#145;aristocratic saint&#146;, and one, moreover, who exhibited the spiritual benefits of support from a powerful Carolingian ruler. In his narrative of Willibrord's career on the continent, Alcuin is at variance on several points with earlier sources, principally the brief account by Bede in his <span class="italic">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</span>. This was written during Willibrord's lifetime, <i>c</i>.730, but gives no information on the missionary's early life, concentrating on the first years of his continental mission, for which Bede's informant was Acca, who visited Willibrord in company with Wilfrid in 703 or 704 and later became bishop of Hexham. Alcuin's outline of the early life may be trusted in its essentials, since it does not directly bear on the biographer's continental political agenda, and concerns his own family.<br>
<br>Willibrord was born in late 657 or early in 658. Alcuin's account of the birth includes a typical hagiographical motif in which the child's sanctity is foretold, and a less typical one comparing Willibrord with John the Baptist, preparing the way for one to come (perhaps, in this case, Boniface, or even Charlemagne). In an explicit comparison with the Baptist's father, Zacharias, Wilgils is said to have &#145;entered upon the state of matrimony for the sole purpose of bringing into the world a child who should benefit many peoples&#146;  (Alcuin, &#145;Life of Willibrord&#146;, 4). A more certain indication of Wilgils's ascetic inclination is his later retirement to live an eremitic life in a church he had built between the North Sea and the Humber, dedicated to St Andrew, where he gathered a small band of devout men. Alcuin later came into possession of that church, he says, &#145;by lawful succession&#146;  (ibid., 3). Willibrord's father was therefore a noted religious as well as a landowner, a member of the Deiran aristocracy.<br>
<br>Apart from his father, two known personalities had a lasting influence on the young Willibrord: the outspoken Northumbrian bishop Wilfrid (<i>c</i>.634&#150;709/10), a man highly active in secular life, and his ascetic fellow countryman Ecgberht (639&#150;729). At first sight the characters of these two figures appear to have been contradictory, but they shared a common devotion to the Roman discipline of calculating the date of Easter, while each man occupied a prominent position in a political and religious culture that spanned northern Britain and the Irish Sea. Thus Ecgberht had influential contacts with the kings of Northumbria and of the Picts, as well as with Iona, which he persuaded to adopt the Roman Easter dating about 716.<br>
<br>It was into this integrated insular religious world that Willibrord was introduced when, according to Alcuin, his father entrusted him, still an infant, to the monastery of Ripon. Although the precise date of Willibrord's oblation is not known, the comment of Wilfrid's biographer Stephen of Ripon, who refers to Willibrord as the (spiritual) son of Wilfrid, indicates that it occurred after the latter had become abbot <i>c</i>.658. Willibrord's entry into Ripon firmly identified him with Wilfrid, and with the brand of Christianity that was then crystallizing around him, one which followed the continental example. The mid-seventh century was a time of friction between Wilfrid's model and a different tradition, centred at Iona and Lindisfarne and practising a different method of Easter dating. Ripon itself had been founded for monks from Lindisfarne who were expelled when Wilfrid took control of the monastery. Ripon thus embodied divisions which the Whitby synod of 664 was subsequently convoked to settle, not entirely successfully.<br>
<br>Although a mere child in 664, it is possible that Willibrord eventually suffered through his association with his abbot. According to Alcuin, it was at the age of twenty&#151;that is, in 678&#151;that he left Ripon for Ireland. Alcuin ascribes the move to a desire to pursue a more rigorous asceticism, but it may be that Wilfrid's fall from favour with the Northumbrian king Ecgfrith, also in 678, forced him to leave. His choice of destination demonstrates, however, that adherence to the &#145;Roman&#146; Easter and separation from the Lindisfarne tradition did not preclude a strong association with Irish Christianity. Willibrord's destination, the monastery of Rath Melsigi, plausibly located at Clonmelsh, co. Carlow, reaffirms the broad integration of the spiritual network in which he lived: it was the monastery chosen by Ecgberht when he went into voluntary exile in 664. Willibrord remained there for the next twelve years.<h2>
<a name="Journeytothecontinent"></a>Journey to the continent</h2>By an unusual stroke of fortune, it is certain that among the attributes that Willibrord learnt during his monastic education was the ability to write. A sample of his handwriting survives, which serves to introduce the next phase of his life. To the calendar generally named after him (the so-called calendar of St Willibrord), in 728 he added a note in the left-hand margin of the page for the second half of November:<blockquote>In the name of the Lord, Clemens Willibrord came across the sea to Francia in the six hundred and ninetieth year from the incarnation of Christ, and in God's name in the six hundred and ninety-fifth year from the incarnation of the Lord, although unworthy, he was ordained bishop in Rome by the apostolic man, the lord pope Sergius. (Wilson, 13)</blockquote>Writing when he was at least seventy, Willibrord thus commemorated his consecration by the pope in 695, at which he was given the name Clemens. He introduced this note, moreover, by mentioning what he clearly saw as the other most significant event of his life: his arrival in Francia in 690. As Alcuin pointed out, he was then thirty-three, &#145;the full age of Christ&#146;  (Alcuin, &#145;Life of Willibrord&#146;, 6).<br>
<br>Bede reveals the impulse which drove Willibrord to undertake his journey when he relates how one of the Rath Melsigi community warned Ecgberht against himself embarking on a mission to preach among the pagan Germans. Reluctantly remaining in Ireland, Ecgberht instead dispatched Wihtberht, another Englishman living at Rath Melsigi. Wihtberht missionized in Frisia, but with little success, and returned after two years. Ecgberht then turned to the companion who, according to Bede, was outstandingly eminent both in rank and in merit: Willibrord. In a party totalling twelve, Willibrord set sail for the continent. It is likely that he sailed directly there, as Bede says Ecgberht had planned to do, rather than pausing in Britain on the way. Neither Bede nor Alcuin gives the names of his companions, though the latter reports that some were later martyred, while others became bishops. Swithberht was almost certainly one of them. All attempts to identify the rest have failed for lack of evidence. It is not even certain that Willibrord's company numbered twelve: it may be too symbolically significant a figure to be taken literally.<h2>
<a name="ThemissiontotheFrisians"></a>The mission to the Frisians</h2>Willibrord himself noted that he disembarked &#145;in Francia&#146;; Alcuin's belief that he had followed Wilfrid and Wihtberht precisely by going first to Frisia was mistaken. Bede is probably more accurate here, relating that the party first sought out Pippin II, the head of the Pippinid (later Carolingian) family, mayor of the Frankish royal palace and effective ruler of the kingdom. Willibrord did not yet have a precise idea of the direction their mission should take. The mission field that Ecgberht had set was very broad, comprising many peoples who, as Bede observes, were &#145;still practising heathen rites&#146;  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 5.9). Bede ascribes the choice of the Frisians as the target of Willibrord's mission to the contemporary political situation: since Pippin II had recently driven the Frisian leader Radbod from <i>citerior Fresia</i>, it was natural that he should send Willibrord and his companions there. The extent of Pippin's conquest is unknown: Bede's &#145;nearer Frisia&#146; implies simply that part of the Low Countries closest to the Frankish lands, probably extending no further north than the lower Maas. For the previous two centuries Frankish control of the region had been marginal at best. The area around Utrecht and Dorestad had fallen under Frisian control by about 670, and paganism was also prevalent in the lands south of the Rhine which nominally fell within the dioceses of Noyon&#150;Tournai and Maastricht, in spite of missionary campaigns by the Frankish bishops Amandus and Eligius, and also by Wilfrid, who arrived in Frisia in 678 after fleeing England. When Willibrord arrived north of the Rhine the population he found there was, to all appearances, uniformly pagan.<br>
<br>Initially, Willibrord carried his mission forward in those areas, south of the Rhine and under Frankish control, where Christianity already had a foothold. It was a region in which Pippin II himself could aid the work of evangelization, both by offering material favours to potential converts (probably in the form of land: Bede's word is <i>beneficia</i>) and by giving the missionaries the protection of his secular authority. Willibrord may not have gone north to this region until some two years after his arrival in Francia, however, for Bede reports that as soon as he moved into his mission field he left it to visit Rome for the first time, and this journey can be dated with some accuracy, to between July 692 and April 693. Having arrived in Francia proper in 690, therefore, his party spent several years there before heading north&#151;a timespan which Bede compresses, perhaps because, with the English experience in mind, he wanted to emphasize the importance to the mission of papal sanction. Willibrord probably saw the securing of Frankish support as the more essential initial task. His first journey to Rome may very well have been intended to secure the approval of the pope, Sergius I, for his work: Sergius is commemorated in his calendar. Its most practical result, however, were the relics that Willibrord brought back to his mission field to act as foci for the devotion of converts, replacing the pagan idols he expected to destroy. Relics purporting to be those brought back by Willibrord are still preserved at Utrecht and at Echternach.<h2>
<a name="ArchbishopoftheFrisians"></a>Archbishop of the Frisians</h2>Willibrord spent only about two years in the north before he set out for Rome again, this time at the behest of Pippin, to seek consecration from the pope. He was duly ordained on 21 November 695, the eve of the feast of St Cecilia, in whose titular church in Trastevere the ceremony took place (not in St Peter's, as Alcuin thought). Although Willibrord gives himself the title &#145;bishop&#146; in his calendar, Bede calls him &#145;archbishop of the Frisians&#146;, and he also appears as archbishop in a charter issued in his favour by Charles Martel in 723. The precise nature of the office Willibrord received is unclear. An archbishop invested by the pope, through the bestowal of the pallium, to consecrate other bishops was unknown on the continent at this time. The idea had emerged in the specific context of the English mission. Although no source records Willibrord bearing a pallium, Bede reports that he appointed bishops in his own province, and other sources have him consecrating churches within the purview of existing Frankish bishops, including at Echternach, in the diocese of Trier. These activities hint at a higher status for Willibrord even than the pallium implied. His connections both with Rome and with the Pippinid house cast him as the precursor to Boniface, and the range of his evangelizing activity suggests that his office included an element of the roving &#145;missionary bishop&#146; that Boniface was to use with such effect after 722.<br>
<br>Although he roamed widely across the north of the Frankish kingdom and beyond, Willibrord's principal role, at least in the pope's eyes, was that of provincial metropolitan to a single people. In that capacity he could hope for Pippin's support: a papally-appointed archbishop of the Frisians who also benefited from Pippinid patronage within Francia, as Willibrord did, could promote the interests of the Franks, and especially of their mayor, beyond the formal borders of the realm.<br>
<br>Such an archbishop nevertheless needed a see, and this was established only after a further military victory by Pippin over the Frisians. Bede reports that Pippin gave Willibrord a place in the <i>castellum</i> of Utrecht for his see, a gift which cannot have been made before 695, when he defeated the Frisians at or near Dorestad. However, all that can be said for certain is that Willibrord was established at Utrecht by 703 or 704, when Wilfrid and Acca visited him there on their way to Rome. Next to the <i>castellum</i> Willibrord consecrated an episcopal church in the name of the Saviour; fittingly, since it was also the original dedication both of Christ Church, Canterbury, and of the Lateran basilica (now San Giovanni in Laterano). From the ruined church of St Martin he created a monastery, closely connected to his cathedral. He thus followed Canterbury in linking church and monastery and also because Augustine had found at Canterbury a church of St Martin of Roman origin. Although the interconnectedness of secular and regular clergy also recalls Irish practices, Willibrord's conception of the bishop differed from the Irish in his emphasis on the bishop's pastoral responsibilities. In this he followed Wilfrid. Nevertheless, he set a precedent for Boniface in making monasticism an essential tool of missionizing. This may have been because, around the time that he was setting up his missionary bishopric, he acquired an interest in monasticism in the heart of Francia.<h2>
<a name="AbbotofEchternach"></a>Abbot of Echternach</h2>More than at Utrecht, the continental sources locate Willibrord at the Rhineland monastery of Echternach. This was the focus of Alcuin's remark that &#145;many began in their zeal for the faith to make over to the man of God their hereditary properties&#146;  (Alcuin, &#145;Vita Willibrordi&#146;, 126), though Alcuin himself does not mention Echternach specifically in this context, and has little to say on the abbey at all: a curious omission, given that he wrote his life of Willibrord at the behest of Echternach's abbot. The properties to which Alcuin refers were bestowed through the charters which survive in Echternach's twelfth-century cartulary. Such documents testify to a culture of monastic patronage among the Frankish aristocracy which had been in existence for over a century, but which Willibrord may have reinvigorated to some extent. Echternach was built on land given in 697 or 698 by Irmina, an important aristocratic dowager, the mother of Pippin's wife, Plectrudis. By 706, when Pippin and Plectrudis themselves made an extensive grant to Willibrord, the latter had built a monastery and a church there, dedicated to St Peter and St Paul. In 1944 an allied bomb exposed the church, a rectangular building some 70 feet long, with a nave about 25 feet wide and a square choir. Signs that it may have had a baptistery indicate its pivotal role in the religious life of the surrounding area. It is difficult to separate this from the links which connected the abbey, and Willibrord himself, with the Pippinid or Carolingian family. Echternach was built on the River Sauer, amid the huge complex of estates owned by Plectrudis's family, an important component of the Pippinid power base. Willibrord's appointment as abbot was supported by the bishops of the local diocese of Trier, Basinus and Leotwin, both staunch supporters of Pippin.<br>
<br>Pippin's sponsorship of Willibrord's activity in his own heartland as well as on the fringes of the kingdom must be seen in the context of widespread monastic patronage by the Pippinid family, particularly in the region of the Maas and the Moselle. When in 706 Pippin and Plectrudis granted a large part of the surrounding area to Echternach, Willibrord entrusted the abbey to the Pippinids' legal and physical protection. In a region dominated by their own family, such protection implied a certain amount of political control. In the same way, at S&uuml;steren, near Li&egrave;ge, there was a small monastic house that Plectrudis had bought and which she made over to Willibrord in 714, so that he might turn it into a fully-fledged monastery. S&uuml;steren was to remain under the protection of Pippin and Plectrudis, the community allowed the freedom to elect its abbots only on condition that it remain loyal to themselves and their heirs. Nevertheless, charters among those collected at Echternach indicate that Willibrord retained a measure of independence. While the Pippinids referred to Echternach as &#145;our monastery&#146; and endowed it directly, other benefactors at this time called it Willibrord's monastery, and preferred to give their lands not to the institution, but to the missionary himself. Chief among these were a series of grants by landholders in Toxandria, part of that area to the south of the lower Maas debated between the Frisians and the Franks in the 690s. Although Willibrord passed their lands on to Echternach in his will, the Toxandrian aristocracy gave to the missionary not because he was abbot of Echternach, but because he was the leading representative in their region of the dominant Frankish Christian culture.<h2>
<a name="AngloSaxonmissionandFrankishaggrandizement"></a>Anglo-Saxon mission and Frankish aggrandizement</h2>Such patronage clearly followed in the wake of Pippin's conquests, although the Toxandrian donors' support for Willibrord does not necessarily identify them as Pippinid partisans. Two donations that he received from Heden, duke of the Thuringians, later driven from his duchy by Pippin, point to the skill with which Willibrord balanced his role as abbot of a powerful Frankish (not to say Pippinid) monastery with his vocation to appeal to those beyond the frontiers of Christian Francia. Nevertheless, his tenure of the abbacy gave him the status of a Frankish magnate and strengthened an association with Pippinid power that may have been crucial to his success in Frisia. There is no evidence that his establishment at Utrecht in 703 or 704 helped to spread Christianity in the region, despite a reconciliation between Pippin and Radbod, which lasted from 711 until Pippin's death in 714, whereupon Radbod won back control of Utrecht. There is no sign that Willibrord was in Frisia during this period. It was the victory of Pippin's son Charles Martel over his Frankish enemies, followed closely by Radbod's death in 719, that led to the re-establishment of Frankish rule around Utrecht and generated the first surviving grants to Willibrord there.<br>
<br>Willibrord had already, in 718, received from Charles an estate near Echternach, having around the same time benefited from the patronage of Arnulf, the most important member of the branch of the Pippinid family opposed to Charles; the Anglo-Saxon's political adroitness, or, perhaps, his perceived neutrality, is once again evident. In 716 he had baptized Charles's son Pippin (later Pippin III). The bond thus established, Charles sought to strengthen it as soon as he could. Frankish chronicles report a campaign on his northern frontier in 722; his first grant to Willibrord in the region&#151;lands around Utrecht&#151;came on 1 January 723. In the will he drew up in 726, Willibrord calls Charles his <i>dominus</i> and <i>senior</i>, a language of vassalage that testifies to the missionary's debt to Charles's political and, no doubt, military support. This enabled him to construct the framework of an ecclesiastical organization in the parts of Frisia that Charles controlled. His first helper in the area was Boniface, who arrived in Frisia for the second time in 719 but left in 721, declining Willibrord's offer to consecrate him a bishop, and went to preach in Hesse. Boniface's letters reveal that Willibrord nevertheless appointed an unnamed assistant, a &#145;chorbishop&#146;, to help him in the Frisian diocese, instituting a clerical grade that was to proliferate over the next hundred years.<br>
<br>If Willibrord's success as a missionary in Frisia is hard to separate from the victories of Frankish arms, his impact further afield is even more difficult to assess. While Alcuin plays down his role as abbot and magnate, his presentation of Willibrord's missionary work may have been intended to provide a model of gentler methods of conversion than those being practised at his time of writing in the last decades of the eighth century, when the Franks brought Christianity to the Saxons at the point of a sword. Having reported Willibrord's initial dispatch to Frisia by Pippin, Alcuin describes his failure to move Radbod from his paganism, and his decision to turn instead to the Danes. The Danish ruler received Willibrord well, but the missionary again despaired of converting the people, and chose thirty Danish boys, baptized them, and returned with them to Francia. On the way back, a storm drove his party onto an island named after the local god Fosite (either Heligoland or one of the islands close to the north coast of Frisia). There Willibrord baptized people in the sacred spring, and slaughtered the sacred cattle. An incensed Radbod cast lots to select a victim from among the missionaries. The lot did not fall on Willibrord, and another of his party was killed. Preaching before the Frisian leader, Willibrord so amazed Radbod with his fortitude that he was sent back to Pippin with honour. Whether true or not, this tale points to what Alcuin saw as legitimate means of evangelizing: the destruction of shrines and shibboleths, baptism, and preaching to the hostile. For Alcuin, Willibrord's mission began to succeed only after this rite of passage, and then apparently in lands under Pippin's sway. Although he dates the first establishment of the bishopric at Utrecht too late, Alcuin generally confirms the impression of the charter evidence that any successes north of the Rhine came after Charles Martel's conquests there.<h2>
<a name="Echternachsscriptorium"></a>Echternach's scriptorium</h2>The distractions of evangelization did not prevent Willibrord from establishing at Echternach a centre of manuscript production. The most important early product of this scriptorium was the calendar which usually bears his name (now Paris, Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, MS Lat. 10837, fols. 34&#150;41). The copy of the Hieronymian martyrology that precedes it (fols. 2&#150;33), and the Easter tables which follow it (fols. 42&#150;3), were produced at the same time. Certainly begun before 709, it has even been suggested that it was started in Ireland and brought to Echternach, perhaps with Willibrord himself. More likely, however, it originated at Echternach as a response to the liturgical needs of the new foundation. Nevertheless, the earliest hands in it wrote insular scripts. Apart from Willibrord's autograph entry, the choice of saints commemorated itself reflects the unique personal profile of the missionary. There are saints of Northumbria and Kent, of Ireland and Rome, of Francia, and especially of the local see of Trier. The appearance of the names of otherwise unknown clerics establishes it as the earliest calendar-type necrologia: that is, a commemorative list of deceased spiritual associates of the monastic community&#151;the <i>familia</i>.<br>
<br>To judge from the scripts of the manuscripts associated with the Echternach scriptorium, Willibrord's <i>familia</i> soon included Frankish recruits. As well as the martyrology and calendar, during Willibrord's lifetime or soon after the scriptorium certainly produced the Augsburg gospels (Augsburg, Universit&auml;tsbibliothek, MS Cod. I.2.4o.2), the Trier gospels (Trier, Domschatz, MS codex 61), the Maeseyck gospels (Maeseyck, church of St Catherine Tresor, MS s.n. ff. 6&#150;132), and the Freiburg gospel fragment (Freiburg im Breisgau, Universit&auml;tsbibliothek, MS Cod. 702). The list of Echternach's probable products at the time includes a text of canon law, a psalter, and some apparently carefully selected biblical commentaries: all essential texts for a pastoral bishop concerned with ecclesiastical discipline and correct doctrine. Some of the scribes were trained in the insular tradition, if not in England or Ireland, revealing Echternach's scriptorium as an important gateway for the Anglo-Saxon and Irish influence that was crucial to the intellectual revival of the second half of the eighth and the ninth century. The Echternach gospels, which share a master scribe with the Durham gospels and were written in Northumbria, eastern Scotland, Iona, or Ireland, are a surviving testament to this link. It is clear, in any case, that Willibrord maintained contact with his native Northumbria throughout his life. Wilfrid and Acca were on their way from Northumbria to Rome when they visited him in 703 or 704; the Northumbrian king and saint Oswald is commemorated in the calendar, and a member of Willibrord's community visited Lindisfarne and regained his health at the tomb of St Cuthbert. From Northumbria too came Beornred, the third abbot of Echternach, who was certainly related to Willibrord, as, indeed, the second abbot, Adalbert, may also have been.<h2>
<a name="Deathcultandlegacy"></a>Death, cult, and legacy</h2>Although the entry Willibrord made in his calendar in 728 is his last recorded act, he lived on for a further eleven years. He seems already to have made his will in 726, though the extant charter in favour of Echternach may cover only half of his property, the other half going to his bishopric of Utrecht. His whereabouts in these years of retirement are unknown, but it seems likely that, if it had not been before, Echternach then became for him the place of repose that he may have wished it to be. He died there on 7 November 739, aged eighty-one, and was buried in the church that he had built. As well as miracles that occurred within his lifetime, chiefly of the provision of water or wine, Alcuin reports that cures were soon effected at his grave.<br>
<br>The popularity of Willibrord's cult is evident from the rapid dissemination of Alcuin's biography. Alcuin also wrote a verse life, which adds no historical information to the prose version. Much the same can be said of the prose and verse lives composed between 1102 and 1106 by Thiofrid, abbot of Echternach, and of a third, equally derivative, life, written at Echternach later in the twelfth century. Willibrord's remains had been translated to a new church in 1031; the feast of his translation, on 10 November, probably commemorates the date of his original burial. In the modern era, the celebration of his feast day at Echternach includes a sacred dance, in which the bishops and clergy participate, which dates back at least as far as the sixteenth century.<br>
<br>Willibrord is the patron saint of the Netherlands and of Luxembourg. He owes his status in the latter to his position as founder and principal saint of Echternach, which continued to benefit from the patronage of the Carolingian house after his death, and became one of the first Carolingian royal monasteries in 751. His influence as a pathfinder for other Anglo-Saxon clerics who settled in continental monasteries in the following hundred years or so, making a crucial contribution to the culture and organization of the church, is unquestionable. His impact on Frisia, the modern Netherlands, is more nebulous. The ecclesiastical structure that he put in place proved ephemeral, but the emergence of Frisian clerics such as Liudger, later bishop of M&uuml;nster, suggests that he had some success in spreading Christian belief, even though paganism long remained a vital force, especially in the east of Frisia. His mission's apparent reliance on the victories of Pippin II and, especially, of Charles Martel, reveals Willibrord's insinuation of himself and his monastic and evangelizing ideals into the Frankish &eacute;lite. He won favour, it appears, from every powerful man he encountered. Partly, perhaps, this was because he was an aristocrat himself; his personal ownership of land, attested by some of the Echternach charters, suggests that Alcuin's attempt to paint him as an &#145;aristocratic saint&#146; was not simply a hagiographical distortion. Willibrord worked with the grain of continental aristocratic society; Boniface, in many ways his successor, often attempted to cut across it. Yet the younger man's success, as both missionary and ecclesiastical reformer, could not have occurred without the elder's subtle but dogged labour.<br>
