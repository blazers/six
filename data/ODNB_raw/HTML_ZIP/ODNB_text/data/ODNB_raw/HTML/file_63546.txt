<span class="headword">Muhammad Reza Khan</span>  (<em>c.</em>1717&#150;1791), <span class="occ">administrator of Bengal</span>, was probably born at Shiraz in Persia. He was the third of the four sons of Hadi Ali Khan, a physician. When the Khan was about ten years old, his father took his family from Persia to India, where he practised medicine, first at the court of the Mughal emperor in Delhi and then at Murshidabad, the capital of the nawabs of Bengal. Muhammad Reza Khan established himself at the court of the nawabs, marrying the daughter of Rabia Begam, a niece of the nawab, and seeking employment in his government. His service began in the troubled times after the battle of Plassey, when contenders for power in the administration of the province had to seek support from factions among the servants of the British East India Company as well as from the nawabs. Muhammad Reza Khan won his first major success when he became the nawab's <i>naib</i> or deputy in the important eastern districts of Dacca. From Dacca he was able in 1765 to win the highest office in the government of Bengal.<br>
<br>The Khan's chance came with the death in February 1765 of Mir Jafar Ali Khan, made nawab of Bengal by the British after Plassey. The new nawab, Najm ud-Daula, was a young boy and so the company's servants were looking for a minister to take control of the government who would be amenable to their influence. They chose the Khan over what they regarded as more dangerous rivals. He reinforced his claims by promising presents to individuals worth more than &pound;50,000. Robert Clive later confirmed the Khan in office under the 1765 settlement with the Mughal emperor which gave the company direct responsibility for the <i>diwani</i>, or revenue administration, of Bengal. Muhammad Reza Khan was to be the company's deputy in managing the assessment and collection of revenue under the <i>diwani</i> and he was to be the young nawab's deputy in administering what was left to him, mainly the supervision of the criminal courts. The Khan was referred to in British records as &#145;the minister&#146; or sometimes &#145;the prime minister&#146;  (A. M. Khan, 103).<br>
<br>Muhammad Reza Khan kept his great powers from 1765 until 1772. Clive held him in high esteem, especially in view of the satisfactory revenue yield that he was able to ensure for the company. Clive awarded him a generous salary amounting to some &pound;90,000 a year. In administering for the British the Khan seems to have been inspired by the ideals of Mughal government and by his view of what conditions had been like in pre-Plassey Bengal. &#145;The Prince is to receive the revenues of the state, to make such laws and regulations only as are consistent with justice; to study the general good of the country and to cherish all his subjects&#146;  (A. M. Khan, 15). He was, however, subject to increasing pressures from his British masters, who were beginning to aspire to take a more active role in the administration of Bengal, and who also hoped for a higher return from the province than the Khan was able to produce. In 1770 British company servants were posted into districts to supervise administration. Two years later a new governor, Warren Hastings, took the central administration of the province out of the Khan's hands and transferred it from Murshidabad to the company's own city of Calcutta. In the contemporary phrase, the company was &#145;standing forth as <i>diwan</i>&#146;; there were to be no more Indian &#145;ministers&#146;.<br>
<br>The removal of Muhammad Reza Khan from office was sudden and brutal. On 27 April 1772 a body of British troops arrested him and carried him off to Calcutta, where he was kept in confinement to answer charges. He had been struck down by a combination of his Indian enemies and the British opponents of his erstwhile friend, Robert Clive. Material against him had been passed to the directors of the East India Company, who ordered his dismissal and trial. The main allegations were that the Khan had been responsible for misappropriating very large sums collected out of the revenues of Bengal, and that he had profiteered from trading in grain during the terrible famine that had devastated parts of Bengal in 1769&#150;70. The investigation dragged on for two years and ended in acquittal. This was the outcome that Warren Hastings, who conducted the prosecution, had intended. He wanted the Khan's power broken but feared that too much probing would reveal that many Europeans had also made illegal profits. The Khan himself had clearly not made a great personal fortune out of his seven years of power. In spite of his high salary, he left office in debt, and he was to remain financially embarrassed for the rest of his life. Others, both British and Indian, no doubt had profited from the collection of revenue under him, but the company's fond hopes that the system could be made to yield much more once supposedly corrupt Indian management had been broken was to be shown to be a delusion.<br>
<br>Political change among the British enabled the Khan to recover some ground. During 1775 and 1776 Hastings lost control of the Bengal council and his opponents patronized Muhammad Reza Khan, restoring him in October 1775 to the office of the nawab of Bengal's deputy for those judicial functions that remained to him. In return the Khan conveyed his ideals of Mughal governance to Hastings's enemy Philip Francis, who was strongly influenced by them in his plans for the future of British government in India. Hastings saw such contacts as hostility and in 1778 took the opportunity of removing Muhammad Reza Khan from office yet again. In 1780 he was restored on orders from Britain; he was to hold his post as deputy to the nawab, with a salary of some &pound;25,000, until shortly before his death.<br>
<br>In the last years of his career Muhammad Reza Khan continued to play an active and respected role. He was recognized to have an unsurpassed knowledge of the Islamic criminal law and supervised its administration conscientiously in appointing judges and presiding over the appeal court. He made a striking impression with his chest &#145;so broad, his body so erect, his tone of voice so very loud, and his eyes so very full of fire&#146;  (Majumdar, 228). He lived in a grand style that, as his critics pointed out, he could not afford, dispensing wisdom &#145;which he has picked up in ancient times and books, without once minding the ignorance or unadequateness [<i>sic</i>] of his audience&#146;  (Ghulam Husain Khan, 3.148&#150;9). To the end of his life he complained that the importunities of his creditors &#145;made sleep and food tasteless to me&#146;  (Majumdar, 282). His second wife, Banni Begam, the widow of his brother, died some time in 1786 or 1787 (Bengal year 1193).<br>
<br>On 1 January 1791 the last governmental responsibilities of the nawab of Bengal, hitherto discharged for him by Muhammad Reza Khan, came to an end. The courts of criminal justice were placed under the direct management of the East India Company. Muhammad Reza Khan duly handed over his records. On 1 October 1791 he died. The company paid tribute to his &#145;honourable character, his regard to the English for a long period of time, and the services he had rendered in Bengal&#146;  (A. M. Khan, 1).<br>
