<span class="headword">Watson,  Richard</span>  (1611/12&#150;1685), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in the parish of St Katharine Cree, London, and was probably the son of William Watson, citizen and mercer (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1634), and his wife, Ursula Pearce. Although there were other London merchants of the same name this parentage is suggested by Richard Watson's attendance for five years at Mercers' School, under Mr Auger, prior to his admission, aged sixteen, to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, on 22 December 1628. Watson graduated BA in 1633, and MA in 1636, and from 1636 to 1644 was fellow of the college, acting as Greek lecturer (1642) and Hebrew lecturer (1643), as well as being master of the Perse School, Cambridge (1636&#150;41). He was almost certainly aligned with the Arminians in the university, and joined Richard Crashaw, Bishop William Juxon, and Bishop Matthew Wren in penning verses which prefaced Robert Shelford's <span class="italic">Five Pious and Learned Discourses</span> (1635).<br>
<br>Upon the outbreak of civil war Watson demonstrated his allegiance to the royalist cause with a provocative lecture at the university church of Great St Mary's, published as <span class="italic">A Sermon Touching Schisme</span>. He was inevitably ejected from the college by the parliamentarian visitation in April 1644, but by then he had already joined the royalist army as chaplain to Lord Hopton, with whom he probably remained in the field during the remainder of the first civil war. After the defeat of the royalist army at Truro in March 1646 Watson went with Hopton into exile, attending Prince Charles in Jersey in 1646 before joining the exiled court at St Germain by December 1647. By 1649 he was in The Hague, where he preached a sermon after the execution of Charles I which was published as <span class="italic">Regicidium judaicum</span>, with a dedication to Hopton. During the months that followed, Watson, like Hopton, formed part of the constitutional royalist faction at court which opposed negotiations with the Scots. In April 1649 Watson described the Scots as &#145;brazen-fac'd rebels and barbarous brutes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Clarendon State Papers</span>, 2.53). This stance led to both men being alienated from the prevailing mood at court, and they subsequently moved to Wesel, where Watson continued to rail against the Scottish presbyterians, whom he described as the &#145;veriest villains the king hath for his enemies&#146;  (Scrope and Monkhouse, 2.491). During 1650 and 1651 he corresponded with other exiles such as Robert Creighton and William Edgeman about a response to Robert Baillie's reply to John Bramhall's attack upon presbyterianism; Watson's intervention appeared as <span class="italic"><i>Akolouthos</i>, or, A Second Faire Warning</span>, dedicated to Hopton against &#145;these bloody Presbyters&#146;. Watson spent most of 1652 with Hopton at Bruges, insistent that he would not return to England under the <span class="roman">Act of Oblivion</span>, but alienated from those royalists, such as the duke of Buckingham, who sought to work with John Lilburne, whom Watson refused to consider as anything other than an <i>agent provocateur</i>.<br>
<br>After Hopton's death in September 1652 Watson remained in exile, in Wesel and Brussels, adamant that the royalists could expect little assistance from the Dutch, and trenchant in his opposition to the presbyterians, against whom he continued to favour a model of the Church of England closer to Laudians such as Richard Montague and John Cosin than strict Calvinists such as Thomas Morton or Ralph Brownrigge. In 1656 Watson published Isaac Basire's <span class="italic">De antiqua ecclesiae Britannicae libertate</span>, which he had found in Hopton's papers, and which he later translated into English. He later moved to Caen, from where he dedicated his <span class="italic">Historicall Collections of Ecclesiastick Affairs in Scotland</span> to John Warner, bishop of Rochester, by whom he had been ordained. Watson's aim was to &#145;confirm all pious and humble hearts in the preferring the ancient and universal successive government of the Christian church before the new Genevatising bloody discipline of some heady Scots&#146;  (Watson, sig. A5). He also entered into print against the poet Edmund Waller, whom he described as a &#145;vassall&#146; for writing a panegyric on the protector's death, and wrote a preface for Eleazor Duncon's <span class="italic">De adoratione Dei</span> (1660). His greatest friend and ally during these years appears to have been Richard Browne, the royalist diplomat in Paris.<br>
<br>Watson remained in Caen until after the Restoration, and returned to England only in 1661 to reclaim his college fellowship, although he felt compelled to issue a petition for confirmation of a grant made by Charles I for an annuity of &pound;30 from his college, and for his restoration as a senior rather than a junior fellow. Watson displayed his allegiance in 1661 with a flurry of publications including <span class="italic">Epistolaris diatribe</span>, <span class="italic">Effata regalia</span>, <span class="italic">The Prudential Advice and Observations</span>, and <span class="italic">Icon animae basilicae</span>, the last three containing ideas and observations culled from the writings of Charles I. Watson was rewarded in 1662 with a doctorate in divinity at Oxford, a chaplaincy to the duke of York, and the rectory of Pewsey in Wiltshire. He subsequently became prebendary at Salisbury Cathedral of Warminster (1666), which he exchanged for that of Bitton in 1671, and master of Heytesbury Hospital (1671). He remained active as a scholar and author, publishing <span class="italic">Aquilae cruso</span> (1665), and writing <span class="italic">An Answer to Elymas the Sorcerer</span> (1682), and <span class="italic">A Fuller Answer to Elimas the Sorcerer</span> (1683), in which he replied to allegations regarding the Popish Plot. He also published some of his own correspondence with John Cosin from 1646, as <span class="italic">The Right Reverend Doctor John Cosin &hellip; his Opinion</span> (1684). Nevertheless, Watson's last years appear to have been far from happy. He was repeatedly troubled by serious allegations over tithe payments at Pewsey, and on at least one occasion, in 1665, was taken into custody. He also felt that he had received insufficient reward for his loyalty, and that he had been passed over for preferment in favour of younger less capable men. It was such attitudes which led Anthony Wood to conclude that Watson was &#145;a good scholar but vain and conceited&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>: <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 2.264). Watson died on 13 January 1685 and was buried at Pewsey.<br>
