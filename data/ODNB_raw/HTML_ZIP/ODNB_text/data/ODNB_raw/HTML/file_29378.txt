<span class="headword">Wigram, Sir  James</span>  (1793&#150;1866), <span class="occ">judge and legal writer</span>, was born at Walthamstow House, Essex, on 5 November 1793, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58560/', "Sir Robert Wigram (1744&#150;1830)")</script> and his second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55217/', "Eleanor Wigram (1767&#150;1841)")</script>, daughter of John Watts of Southampton. Wigram's father, a merchant and shipowner, and MP for Wexford and Fowey, was created baronet in 1805. His elder brother, the second baronet, changed his name to Fitzwygram in 1832. Another of his brothers was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29379/', "Joseph Cotton Wigram")</script>. Wigram was educated privately before matriculating in 1811 at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA as fifth wrangler in 1815, and proceeded MA in 1818. He gained a fellowship at Trinity in 1817 but vacated this on his marriage on 24 December 1818 to Anne (<i>d</i>. 1844), daughter of Richard Arkwright of Willersley Castle, Derbyshire, and granddaughter of Sir Richard Arkwright. The couple had four sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>Wigram was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 18 June 1813, and called to the bar on 18 November 1819. He practised in the court of chancery with such success that he was appointed king's counsel on 27 December 1834 and was elected a bencher of his inn in January 1835. In 1831 he published his <span class="italic">Examination of the rules of law respecting the admission of extrinsic evidence in aid of the interpretation of wills</span> which went through four editions in his lifetime, and appeared in a fifth edition in 1914. This was followed in 1836 by his <span class="italic">Points in the Law of Discovery</span> (2nd edn., 1840). These books led to an interesting correspondence with some of the American judges, including the eminent commentator Joseph Story who regarded them as &#145;works of extraordinary merit, ability, and learning, and eminently useful to the profession&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Letters of Joseph Story</span>, ed. W. W. Story, 2 vols., 1851).<br>
<br>Wigram's wife's family owned considerable property in the neighbourhood of Leominster, Herefordshire, and supported by this Wigram stood as parliamentary candidate for Leominster as a tory in 1837. He was unsuccessful, but was returned for the borough without opposition at the next general election on 28 June 1841, but sat only until his appointment to the bench as a vice-chancellor on 30 October 1841, following the statute 5 Vict. c. 5 which provided for the appointment of two further vice-chancellors. He was knighted on 15 January 1842 and sworn of the privy council, becoming a member of its judicial committee. His decrees, well reported by Thomas Hare, were remarkable for their lucid exposition of legal principle and were generally admired. He resigned on 26 October 1850 as a result of an illness which led to complete blindness, and was granted a pension of &pound;3500 a year. He died at his home, 68 Portland Place, London, on 29 July 1866.<br>
