<span class="headword">Bigge,  John Thomas</span>  (1780&#150;1843), <span class="occ">judicial commissioner</span>, was born on 8 March 1780 at Benton House, Northumberland, the fourth of ten children of Thomas Charles Bigge (1739&#150;1794), landowner, banker, and sheriff of Northumberland, and his wife, Jemima (1748&#150;1806), daughter of William Ord and his wife, Anne. The Bigges supposed their ancestry, in Kent and Essex, to predate the Norman conquest. John Thomas was educated at Newcastle Free School and Westminster School (1795). In 1797 he entered Christ Church, Oxford (BA 1801, MA 1804). Although financially independent through a legacy, he chose a bar career, being called at the Inner Temple (1806), and practised on the northern circuit and in London.<br>
<br>In 1810, while accompanying his unwell sister, Eliza, to Madeira, Bigge met and befriended Sir Ralph Woodward, also escorting an ailing sister. Woodford, by 1812, became governor of Trinidad and recommended Bigge to the vacant chief justiceship there. Commissioned on 5 July 1813, Bigge made a concentrated study of Spanish laws and language as used in Trinidad courts, and reformed court business which he found in confused arrears. He recommended the displacement of Spanish by English institutions, particularly jury trial.<br>
<br>Bigge undertook many extra-judicial duties, auditing the colony's accounts, and inquiring into financial mismanagement and corruption. His recommendations concerning slave emancipation were commended by the Colonial Office, which, on his seeking leave in 1818, invited him to become commissioner of inquiry into the New South Wales convict settlement. He accepted and resigned from the bench. New South Wales, appointed a place to which convicts might be transported, had changed much since 1788. The rebellion that dislodged Governor William Bligh in 1808 might have stimulated a wider revolution, but order was restored under Governor Lachlan Macquarie. Autocratic, like his predecessors, Macquarie had new policies. He saw New South Wales as a future free colony, not as a perpetual gaol, and he believed in readmitting to society convicts who had served their sentences (emancipists). Because members of the armed forces and emancipists alike stayed on to take land grants, and capitalists invested in the pastoral promise of the country, the settlement's future had to change.<br>
<br>Bigge's inquiries, politically motivated to delay change, looked to making transportation more cost-efficient while restoring its terror to discourage crime in England. An inquiry into New South Wales in 1812, along with copious recommendations from officials and individuals, made a further inquiry superfluous. But it was expedient. Macquarie, who had sought leave to retire, but had not received a reply dissuading him, was shocked at Bigge's arrival in Sydney in September 1819, bearing a dormant commission as governor should Macquarie resign. At first reassured by Bigge's credentials and demeanour, Macquarie believed that the inquiry would vindicate him. But there was soon friction, particularly over Bigge's insistence on economies, especially the deployment of convict labour from town developments to rural work.<br>
<br>Bigge, while recording minute evidence of continuing historical interest&#151;a &#145;book of petty details&#146;, remarked the Sydney <span class="italic">Monitor</span> (3 February 1827)&#151;used inquisitorial methods owing more to Trinidad than to Westminster. Natural justice and procedural fairness were denied, to Macquarie's prejudice. Three reports followed: &#145;State of the colony&#146; (1822); &#145;Judicial establishments&#146; (1823); and &#145;State of agriculture and trade&#146; (1823). Conceived in controversy, they retain that character, still stimulating disagreement as to their worth. They collectively strengthened the future of New South Wales as a free colony, while denying such concessions to democracy as a franchise and jury trial. The ensuing <span class="roman">New South Wales Act</span> (4 Geo. IV c.96) conceded only a nominated legislature and embryonic court structure.<br>
<br>Rejecting a judicial post at Gibraltar, Bigge agreed in 1823 to be a joint commissioner inquiring into the Cape and other colonies. The inquiries were prolix. Reports, not completed until 1830, stimulated some government and court reforms. Declining, because of illness, to inquire into clerical establishments in 1832, Bigge, still unmarried, led a secluded life until his accidental death at the Grosvenor Hotel in London on 20 December 1843. He was interred in All Saints' cemetery, Fulham, his considerable estate being distributed among nephews and nieces.<br>
