<span class="headword">Vereker,  Charles</span>, second Viscount Gort  (1768&#150;1842), <span class="occ">soldier and politician</span>, was the second son of Thomas Vereker of Roxborough, co. Limerick, and his wife, Juliana, sister of John Prendergast Smyth, first Viscount Gort. He was descended from a family of Flemish extraction, long settled in co. Limerick. At the age of fourteen he entered the Royal Navy, and, serving as a midshipman, participated in the relief of Gibraltar in 1782. Vereker's gallantry on this occasion received the warm acknowledgement of his commander; but after a few years' service he retired from the navy and purchased a commission in the army. In 1790 Vereker was returned for the borough of Limerick to the Irish parliament in the interest of his uncle, whose heir he had become. He retained this position until the union in 1800, and in 1802 was elected unopposed for the same constituency to Westminster; he held this seat down to his succession to the peerage in 1817.<br>
<br>He was twice married: first, on 7 November 1789, to Jane, widow of William Stamer of Carnelly, and daughter of Ralph Westropp of Attyflyn, who died on 19 February 1798; and, second, on 5 March 1810, to Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1858), daughter of John Palliser of Derryluskan, co. Tipperary. He had children by both marriages, two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1793 Vereker was appointed to the command of the Limerick militia, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and in that capacity he was in charge of the garrison at Sligo at the time of the French invasion during 1798. After his victory at Castlebar the French general, Humbert, desiring to join with the Ulster United Irishmen, marched on Sligo at the head of his whole force of 1600 men, accompanied by numerous Irish irregulars, and on the morning of 5 September he arrived at Colooney, a village within 5 miles of that town. Vereker, who had only 300 men at his disposal, had received orders not to risk an engagement, but believing that the French force at Colooney represented only a detachment of the main army, he marched out to meet it. After holding the enemy at bay for nearly two hours, Vereker retreated to Sligo with considerable casualties. He was himself severely wounded in the engagement. Humbert, conjecturing from Vereker's audacity that he was supported by the main body of the British army, diverted his march from Sligo. The significance of this clash was later exaggerated, but it did demonstrate that the Irish militia would not always run when under fire. For his services Vereker was voted the thanks of an Irish parliament anxious to assert its limited dependence on English forces; he also received a sword of honour from the city of Limerick. After considerable lobbying he was in 1803 awarded the privilege of adopting the motto &#145;Colooney&#146;, with a grant of supporters bearing the flag of the Limerick militia.<br>
<br>Vereker was a vigorous opponent of the union, against which he voted: he declared in the Commons in 1799 that &#145;having defended his country with his blood, there was nothing in the gift of the crown that could tempt him to betray it by his vote&#146;. Yet, while he occasionally opposed the government's Irish defence measures, at Westminster he proved susceptible to offers of patronage. In 1803 the chief secretary declared him &#145;a very troublesome man, who is full of vanity, but warm in his attachments&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>, 447). In 1807 he was appointed a commissioner of the Treasury for Ireland. He also held the honorary offices of constable of Limerick Castle and governor of Galway. He succeeded his uncle in the viscountcy of Gort on 23 May 1817, having failed in 1816 to extract an earldom by means of conduct the viceroy found &#145;shabby&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>, 448). He was elected an Irish representative peer in 1823. He acted in general with the tory party, yet despite being virulently anti-Catholic and the controlling patron of Limerick corporation, Gort voted for Catholic emancipation in 1829, and for the <span class="roman">Irish Corporation Act</span>. He died at Dublin on 11 November 1842, and was succeeded by his eldest son, John Prendergast Vereker, third viscount.<br>
