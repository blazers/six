<span class="headword">Bain,  Francis William</span>  (1863&#150;1940), <span class="occ">scholar and writer</span>, the third son of Joseph Bain (1826&#150;1911), archivist and antiquary, of Sweethope, Bothwell, Lanarkshire, and his wife, Charlotte, daughter of Edward Piper, of Alston, Cumberland, was born at Bothwell on 29 April 1863. He was elected an exhibitioner (1877) and a scholar (1878) on the foundation of Westminster School, becoming captain of the school in 1881. He went as a Westminster scholar to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1882. He obtained a second class in classical moderations (1884) and a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1886), and was also a blue for association football for four years from 1883 to 1886, captaining the Oxford University team in his fourth year. In 1889 he was elected to a fellowship (which he held until 1897) at All Souls College; in 1890 he married Helen Margarita (<i>d</i>. 1931), daughter of Henry Blandford, of Blandford, Dorset. <br>
<br>In 1892, to the surprise of many of his friends, Bain took a post in the Indian educational service as professor of history and political economy at the Deccan College at Poona, where he remained until his retirement in 1919, after serving, in addition, as junior principal in 1908 and as senior principal in 1911. He was appointed CIE in 1918, and when he left Poona he received an address in a silver casket expressing the enthusiastic appreciation of many hundreds of former students not only for his teaching but for his deep sympathy with, and insight into, the higher elements in Indian life and thought; he was regarded &#145;not only as a professor but also as a prophet and a philosopher&#146;. <br>
<br>After 1919 Bain lived quietly in London, paying frequent visits to All Souls, where, as in the years before 1914, he was always an eagerly awaited guest; but deeply affected by the death of his wife (1931) and of his only child, a daughter (1934), he retired into a self-imposed isolation, broken with difficulty even by his most intimate friends, which continued for the rest of his life. He died at 59 Bridge Avenue, Hammersmith, on 24 February 1940. <br>
<br>Bain, as an undergraduate, developed the views on life, philosophy, politics, and literature which he maintained with increasing tenacity to the end. Aristotle was for him &#145;the master of the wise&#146;. In politics he was a tory with a creed based on his interpretation of Bolingbroke and Disraeli; for whigs, Liberals, and modern Conservatives he had a profound contempt. He freely discussed Indian political reform, and his biographer described him as a &#145;Tory who condemned dictatorial rule, an imperialist who wanted Indians to fight for self-rule&#146;  (Mutalik, 48). In modern physical and natural science he saw only a perversion of judgement and of the facts; the classical economists and most historians he regarded as ability corrupted by original sin; but into imaginative literature of all types he had a wonderful insight. He was remembered by students as an inspiring teacher and a lasting intellectual influence. He could expound with fascinating lucidity views which he was convinced were fundamentally wrong, and instruct his Indian students that &#145;this is what they must say&#146; and then demonstrate its perversity and errors. Deep in Bain's mind was an inspiring mystical element which at Poona was richly nourished by his study of Indian life, religion, and the Sanskrit classics, which he learned to read after arriving in India. He also developed some proficiency in Marathi.<br>
<br>In his early years Bain published two or three volumes of fiction, philosophical pamphlets, and a remarkable essay, <span class="italic">The English Monarchy and its Revolutions</span> (1894), full of penetrating observations, all of which attracted no attention; but in 1899 he found the right scope for his genius when he published <span class="italic">A Digit of the Moon</span>, a Hindu love story, professing to be a translation from a Sanskrit manuscript. Even experts were at first taken in, but its quality both in imagination and style captured a large and critical public, which rightly hailed it as unique in English literature. It was followed by twelve other similar Hindu love stories, the last of which, <span class="italic">The Substance of a Dream</span> (1919), was as successful as its predecessors. The stories were reprinted between 1913 and 1920, and a few of them again in the 1950s. Translations appeared in several European and Indian languages. After 1919 Bain ceased to write.<br>
<br>Bain's personality was even more impressive than his best writing. Strikingly handsome, when stirred by his company he exercised almost a witchery over his friends; and in the common room at All Souls his conversation in that congenial atmosphere, discussing any and every topic, and soaring at times into flights of imaginative eloquence, was an experience impossible to describe, but thrilling to have shared. His loyalty to the college and to a limited circle of friends earned from all an affection as strong as was the admiration of his genius. Copies of most of Bain's writings are in the Codrington Library at All Souls. Besides those mentioned above, there may be noted his biographical study, <span class="italic">Queen Christina of Sweden</span> (1890), <span class="italic">On the Realisation of the Possible and the Spirit of Aristotle</span> (1899), and the essay <span class="italic">De vi physica et imbecillitate Darwiniana</span> (1903) which summarizes his homage to Aristotle and his views on &#145;modern science&#146;. A list of the published writings is to be found in the biography of Bain by K. Mutalik.<br>
