<span class="headword">Gossage,  William</span>  (1799&#150;1877), <span class="occ">chemical manufacturer</span>, was born on 12 May 1799 in Burgh-le-Marsh, Lincolnshire, the youngest of thirteen children of Thomas Gossage and his wife, Eleanor. He had little schooling, and went to work at the age of twelve, apprenticed to an uncle in a chemist and druggist business in Chesterfield. At once he showed a determined character, setting himself, for example, to master the French language. He took out his first patent at the age of twenty-four, after inventing a portable alarm to attach to watches and clocks. For a time he was assistant to the manager at a works at Ardwick Bridge owned by the Tennant Company of St Rollox. He set up on his own in Leamington, trading in medicinal salts, but in 1831 changed his activity to that of manufacturing salt and alkali in Stoke Prior in Worcestershire, a site valuable for its nearness to the Droitwich salt deposits, and to the new lines of transport communication provided by the Birmingham and Worcester Canal.<br>
<br>In 1836 Gossage demonstrated a solution to an outstanding environmental problem. The main method of alkali manufacture at the time was that of Nicolas Leblanc, which had the defect of pouring into the air large quantities of hydrogen chloride gas, an extremely noxious pollutant. In 1836 Gossage devised a method of absorbing the acid gas; a steady stream of water descending a tower (the &#145;Gossage tower&#146;) containing twigs, bracken, and bricks, came in contact with a steady stream of ascending gas, dissolving it and thus bringing the dangerous nuisance under a high degree of control. This power of control made it possible to enact the <span class="roman">Alkali Works Act</span> of 1863, the first statute to provide a quantitative measure of pollution control. Gossage's invention also provided the starting point for the process devised by Walter Weldon for making chlorine and bleaching powder, an invaluable aid to the textile industry.<br>
<br>For a time Gossage manufactured white lead in Birmingham (1841&#150;4), and then adventured in copper smelting in Neath in south Wales (1844&#150;8). Gossage moved to Widnes in 1850, and experimented with a method of extracting sulphur from copper ores, eventually concentrating on the manufacture of alkali. Sodium carbonate had been the main product of the alkali industry, but Gossage saw a need to develop sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) and pursued this. The suppression of the tax on soap in 1852 encouraged him to embark on soap manufacture. He set up his own works in 1855 and produced his first bar of mottled soap in 1857. This became famous under the brand name of Gossage. Outside business he made a significant contribution to the development of Widnes.<br>
<br>On 22 May 1824 Gossage married Mary Herbert of Leamington; they had a family of seven children. Two of the sons, Alfred and Frederick, continued to expand the family business after their father's death. Gossage died at Earlsleigh, Dunham Massey, Altrincham, Cheshire, on 9 April 1877.<br>
