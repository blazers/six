<span class="headword">Roy, Manabendra Nath</span>  (1887&#150;1954), <span class="occ">international communist leader and ideologist</span>, was born Narendra Nath Bhattacharya on 21 March 1887, according to family tradition, in Arbalia village, near Calcutta, the fourth child of Dinabandhu Bhattacharya, a village teacher. He was educated locally but, like many Bengali young men of the period, he held as his major concern the anti-colonial struggle, and from 1905 he became deeply involved with the revolutionary groups that had sprung up at that time. In 1915 he left India to try to arrange for the smuggling of arms from Germany. This failed, but he was able to reach California in June 1916, at which point he adopted the name Manabendra Nath Roy. He met and married there his first wife, Evelyn Trent, and at the same time came into contact with American radicals and progressives. Forced to leave the United States, he went in 1917 to Mexico, where he became involved in local politics and emerged as the effective leader of the small Mexican Socialist Party. The key event in Roy's political development was his meeting with Michael Borodin, who had arrived in Mexico in 1919 as the Comintern's emissary. Under Borodin's guidance he converted to Marxism and in August 1919 set up the Communist Party of Mexico.<br>
<br>Roy played a major role at the second Comintern congress in 1920 and engaged Lenin in a famous debate about the role of the &#145;national bourgeoisie&#146; in the colonies in the transition to communism. Both saw the importance of anti-colonial nationalism in destabilizing the metropolitan countries such as Britain, but they diverged significantly over whether the existing colonial bourgeoisie had any long-term revolutionary potential. An immediate question was whether bourgeois parties, such as the Indian National Congress under Gandhi, should be supported. While Lenin believed they should, Roy thought that the Comintern should be more selective and seek to identify and support revolutionary movements based on the colonial working class. This reflected his more general view, set out for example in <span class="italic">India in Transition</span> (1922), that the tools of Marxist analysis could be applied universally.<br>
<br>From 1920 until 1929 Roy was a full-time leader of the Comintern and played a prominent part in its affairs. He was a key figure in the early history of the Communist Party of India, founded originally at Tashkent in 1920 and in India itself in 1925. His involvement in the disasters that struck the fledgeling Chinese Communist Party in 1927, however, led to his exclusion from the inner circle of leadership, while his analysis of the situation in India led him to take positions which diverged from the increasingly rigid Comintern orthodoxy. He maintained his highly critical analysis of Gandhi, but began to see the need for a tactical alliance with left-wing elements within Congress. His positions&#151;especially his so-called &#145;decolonization&#146; thesis, which saw the British establishing a working relationship with the Indian bourgeoisie at the expense of the working class and therefore implied the need for solidarity of all progressive forces&#151;were attacked at the sixth Comintern congress in 1928 and he was expelled the following year. His personal association with figures such as Bukharin meant that there was no place for him in the Stalin-dominated Comintern thereafter. He found a spiritual home at this point with the dissident communist group in Germany led by August Thalheimer and Heinrich Brandler.<br>
<br>In December 1930 Roy secretly returned to India in order to establish a political base, but he was arrested by the authorities after a few months and sentenced to twelve years in prison on charges of conspiracy to overthrow the state. Although his sentence was reduced on appeal to six years, he had to endure harsh conditions in gaol, relieved only by the opportunity to read extensively. During this period he began to move beyond the orthodox Marxism of his earlier period. After his release from gaol in 1936 Roy attempted a strategy of working with the left in Congress, and established friendly relations with Jawaharlal Nehru and other progressives. However, he found little space for manoeuvre between a new generation of socialists on the one side and Gandhian activists on the other. Roy left Congress in 1940, believing that it should have agreed to support Britain in its war with Nazi Germany, and established his own Radical Democratic Party. This failed to make any electoral impact and Roy dissolved it in 1948.<br>
<br>Roy had separated from his first wife in 1926, and, after a relationship with Louise Geissler, in 1936 married Ellen Gottschalk. From 1946, when he settled in Dehra Dun, until his death there on 25 January 1954 he continued to develop his theories of radical humanism, which sought to apply his rationalist and materialist analysis of historical processes to the Indian context. His <i>magnum opus</i> was <span class="italic">Reason, Romanticism and Revolution</span>, published in two volumes in 1952 and 1955. After his death his ideas were kept alive by a circle of devoted followers.<br>
