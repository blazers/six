<span class="headword">Seymour <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Percy]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>, duchess of Somerset  (1667&#150;1722), <span class="occ">courtier and politician</span>, was born on 26 January 1667 at Petworth, Sussex, and baptized there on 29 January. She was the only surviving daughter and heir of Joceline Percy, eleventh earl of Northumberland (1644&#150;1670), and Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1646&#150;1690), youngest daughter and coheir of Thomas Wriothesley, fourth earl of Southampton, lord treasurer of England from 1660 to 1667. She was known as Lady Elizabeth Percy from her father's accession to the earldom in 1668 until her marriage in 1679. At her father's death on 21 May 1670, having survived a brother, Henry, who died in 1669, and a sister, Henrietta, who died soon afterwards, she inherited the vast Percy estates and became one of the most sought-after heiresses in England. Upon the marriage of her mother to her second husband, Ralph Montagu (later first duke of Montagu), in 1673 she was placed under the guardianship of her grandmother, Elizabeth, dowager countess of Northumberland (1622/3&#150;1705), at Petworth. In 1679 the dowager countess arranged a marriage for her twelve-year-old granddaughter with the fifteen-year-old Henry Cavendish, styled earl of Ogle (1663&#150;1680), son and heir of Henry, second duke of Newcastle. Ogle, who appears to have been sickly, died on 1 November the following year.<br>
<br>In 1681 the dowager countess arranged a contract of marriage for her granddaughter with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27423/', "Thomas Thynne (1647/8&#150;1682)")</script> of Longleat, Wiltshire, the wealthy and famous &#145;Tom of Ten Thousand&#146;, worth &pound;10,000 per annum. Lady Elizabeth shrank from living with her much older husband, pleading that &#145;there may be more sin and shame in people's living together than in parting&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1682</i>, 49). It is unclear whether she fled or was allowed by Thynne to go abroad to the Netherlands in November 1681. There she was sheltered by Sir William Temple, the English ambassador to The Hague, and sought the assistance of her mother and Ralph Montagu to free her from Thynne. There is evidence of legal proceedings to dissolve the marriage on the grounds of a previous commitment to marry on Thynne's part. The marriage was in fact ended by Thynne's murder on 12 February 1682. While riding in his coach down Pall Mall he was set upon and killed by a group of assailants hired by Count Karl Johann K&ouml;nigsmark. K&ouml;nigsmark was an adventurer who had become attracted to Lady Elizabeth on a visit to the English court the previous year. While the assailants were soon captured, tried, and executed K&ouml;nigsmark was acquitted and left England. Lady Elizabeth denied any knowledge of the plot but the scandal would forever cast a shadow on her name.<br>
<br>Lady Elizabeth returned to England in March 1682. On 30 May, after an initial refusal, she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25158/', "Charles Seymour, sixth duke of Somerset (1662&#150;1748)")</script>. The original contract stipulated that he was to take the name Percy but she released him from this obligation upon the attainment of her majority. The marriage was well known to be unhappy, largely because of Somerset's imperious temper and overweening pride; according to William Legge, first earl of Dartmouth, Somerset &#145;treated her with little gratitude or affection, though he owed all he had, except an empty title, to her&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 6.34n.). Nevertheless, under Queen Anne the Somersets made an effective political team. He was master of the horse and a member of the cabinet; she was named a lady of the bedchamber on 12 May 1702. The duchess seems to have been widely esteemed at court for her gracious disposition and impeccable manners. Dartmouth thought her &#145;the best bred, as well as the best born lady in England &hellip; She maintained her dignity at court, with great respect to the queen and civility to all others&#146;  (ibid.). It is remarkable that this testimony comes from a tory but it is not in fact unique. Towards the end of the queen's reign the tory Anne Wentworth, countess of Strafford, remarked &#145;If the Duchess must be out, she will leave the Court with a very good grace, for everybody is pleased with her good breeding and civility&#146;  (De Fonblanque, 507).<br>
<br>From about mid-reign a genuine friendship developed between the queen and the duchess of Somerset. This was not least because, unlike Sarah Churchill, duchess of Marlborough, and Abigail (later Lady) Masham, the duchess of Somerset &#145;never press'd the Queen Hard, nothing makes the Queen more Uneasie than that&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Sir David Hamilton</span>, 49). Nevertheless Jonathan Swift thought her &#145;a most insinuating woman&#146;  (Swift, 206). Both the Churchill circle and the tories were convinced that the duchess connived with her husband to bring down the Godolphin ministry in 1710 and to thwart the Harley ministry at every opportunity thereafter. Certainly the Somersets' attendance on the queen stepped up from the summer of 1709. The Churchills suspected that the duchess used this contact to point out the frequent absences from court of the duchess of Marlborough. While the duchess of Somerset was not averse to engaging in political intrigue she tended to do so without the clumsiness of her whig rival, whom she supplanted as groom of the stole on 24 January 1711. Rather her very courtliness could be an effective weapon; thus while attending the queen in the House of Lords during the Sacheverell trial both she and Jane, Lady Hyde, stood with ostentatious correctness while the duchess of Marlborough chose to sit down. At the end of 1711 it was the duchess of Somerset who showed Anne a copy of the <span class="italic">Daily Courant</span> that contained Johann Kaspar von Bothmer's memorial protesting the preliminary articles of the treaty of Utrecht. As a result Swift thought that the queen's apparent wavering of support for the ministry over &#145;No Peace without Spain&#146; was &#145;all your d&#151;d duchess of Somerset's doings&#146;  (Swift, 435). And yet in each case the duchess could claim that she was doing nothing that was improper or overtly political.<br>
<br>The Oxford ministry was particularly anxious to neutralize the duchess's influence after this d&eacute;b&acirc;cle. In the winter of 1711&#150;12 there was a concerted ministerial campaign to have her removed from her bedchamber post. Swift seconded this with <span class="italic">The Windsor Prophecy</span>, which referred none too subtly to the duchess's chequered past:<blockquote>
<div>Beware of Carrots from Northumberlond.<br>
</div>
<div>Carrots sown Thyn a deep root may get<br>
</div>
<div>If so be they are in Sommer set<br>
</div>
<div>Their Conyngs mark thou, for I have been told,<br>
</div>
<div>They Assassine when young, and Poison when old.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>The charge was unfair and it redounded to the author's discredit in the queen's eyes. Nevertheless, when the duke of Somerset was dismissed as master of the horse early in 1712 it looked as if tory hopes might be fulfilled, since he sought to force his wife to resign her court appointments as well. It was only after a concentrated effort by Anne, assisted by William, Lord Cowper, and the queen's physician, Sir David Hamilton, that Somerset was persuaded to allow his wife to remain in office, thus maintaining a whig presence around the queen. In late January, upon the completion of these negotiations, Hamilton wrote &#145;going into the Queen after the Duchess of Somerset came out from Her, I never saw the Queen Look with a more pleasant and Healthful Countenance, saying that Now, it was done&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Sir David Hamilton</span>, 40). Despite this outcome, and Hamilton's constant urging that the duchess spend less time at Petworth and more time at court, recent historiography finds that the whigs received little tangible advantage from her proximity to the sovereign. This is hardly surprising, given the duchess's characteristic discretion and Anne's growing aversion to being badgered by her bedchamber attendants. Somewhat ironically this failure to press the queen goes far to explain why Somerset was, according to Dartmouth, &#145;by much the greatest favourite, when the queen died&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 6.34n.). During the desperate final days of his ministry the earl of Oxford paid tribute to that favour and her reputation for intrigue when he wrote &#145;Send for the D<sup>chs</sup> of Somerset&#151;no body else can save us&#146;  (Holmes, 216). In fact there is no evidence that she would&#151;or could&#151;have done so.<br>
<br>In tribute to her birth and rank the duchess of Somerset was chief mourner at the funerals of Mary II in 1695 and Queen Anne in 1714. She died at home at Northumberland House, London, of breast cancer, on 23 November 1722 and was buried on 13 December in Salisbury Cathedral. She gave birth to at least four sons and three daughters. The eldest son, Charles Seymour, styled earl of Hertford, was baptized on 22 March 1683 but died and was buried by the following 26 August. Her second, but first surviving, son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25156/', "Algernon Seymour")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25158/', "Seymour, Charles, sixth duke of Somerset")</script>], also styled earl of Hertford in his father's lifetime, Baron Percy from 1722 (the Lords mistakenly assuming that the duchess had held that title), and seventh duke of Somerset from 1748. Her son Percy, MP for Cockermouth from 1718, died in 1721 and her son Charles died in 1711; both had remained unmarried. Her three daughters included Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1734), who married Henry O'Brien, eighth earl of Thomond (<i>d</i>. 1741); Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1731), who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30149/', "Sir William Wyndham, baronet")</script>; and Anne (<i>d</i>. 1722), who married Peregrine Osborne, third duke of Leeds.<br>
