<span class="headword">Cairns,  David</span>  (1904&#150;1992), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and theologian</span>, was born on 11 June 1904 at the manse of Ayton, Berwickshire, the first of the two children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32242/', "David Smith Cairns (1862&#150;1946)")</script>, minister of the United Presbyterian church, and his wife, Helen Wilson Craw (<i>d</i>. 1910), daughter of a neighbouring farmer. In 1907 his father was appointed to the chair of systematic theology in the United Free Church college in Aberdeen, becoming moderator of the United Free church general assembly in 1923, and in 1929 principal of the college, where he taught until his retirement in 1937.<br>
<br>The younger David Cairns was schooled extensively, at Aberdeen grammar school (1912&#150;16), at Merchiston Castle School, Edinburgh (1916&#150;22), at Aberdeen University (1922&#150;4), at Balliol College, Oxford (BA 1928), at Christ's College, Aberdeen (1928&#150;31), and in postgraduate study at the University of Z&uuml;rich (1931&#150;2). A year as assistant minister of Govan Old Parish under the charismatic Revd George MacLeod was followed by ordination and induction to the charge of Bridge of Allan, Trinity, where he ministered until 1941, demitting upon commissioning into the royal army chaplain's department, in which he served until the end of the Second World War. In 1946&#150;7 David Cairns was secretary to the Student Christian Movement at Oxford, whence he was appointed to the chair of practical theology at Christ's College, Aberdeen&#151;a post which he held until his retirement in 1972. He received an honorary doctorate of divinity from Edinburgh University in 1953. On 16 December 1948 Cairns married Emily Rosemary Russell (<i>b</i>. 1920), daughter of Dr A. S. Russell of Christ Church, Oxford. They adopted a daughter in 1953 and a son in 1954.<br>
<br>David Cairns was the son of a highly distinguished churchman, theologian, and academic scholar, a father whom he revered. From an early stage in life he demonstrated the same intellectual aptitude and giftedness as his father had before him, gaining a first-class honours degree at Oxford and the clear commendation of his mentor there, Dr John MacMurray, who wrote to Cairns senior that &#145;David owes his First to himself more than to anyone for sheer hard work and sound self-reliant thinking&#146;  (private information). His early years as a minister prepared him well for what was to be his major life work in the academic world, continuing scholarly research in the fields of systematic and practical theology, for example in the translating of Emil Brunner's work, and in the production of numerous articles for a variety of journals. In his care for and preparation of candidates for the ordained ministry, principally though not exclusively for the Church of Scotland, David Cairns was a kindly mentor, meticulous in his work, possessed of a lively, sometimes sharp, sense of humour and motivated always by a deep pastoral sensitivity for his students.<br>
<br>In his later years Cairns was severely afflicted by arthritis and, despite suffering great physical discomfort, periodic surgery, and hospitalization, he was quite indomitable in his determination to continue with his work. He was an avid reader on all manner of subjects and, since his close association from Govan days with George MacLeod, founder of the Iona community, he maintained a lifelong concern for social, political, and theological subjects and, in particular, issues of justice, peace, and disarmament. A very gifted artist especially in watercolour, whose work was widely commended, he revelled in capturing the magnificent landscapes of Europe and Britain, travelling frequently while his health permitted, but continuing to find and give pleasure through painting, even in the latter years of confinement at home or in hospital. As was his family's custom, David Cairns corresponded voluminously. A deeply committed minister and churchman all his life, his faith was a continual pilgrimage of exploration even to the end, where a copy of his Greek <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, often accompanied by a volume of the Greek classics, was always to be found by his bed; and he would engage with visitors in deep theological discussion and debate, his mind and intellect still keen, and quite undimmed by age.<br>
<br>His own path of life was modelled on that of Cairns senior, with whom he maintained a close, affectionate, and highly intellectual correspondence until his father's death. He immersed himself totally in his work and he is remembered fondly, with respect and high regard by the successive generations of students at Christ's College. After a long period of increasing frailty, patiently borne, David Cairns died at Woodend Hospital, Aberdeen, on 17 October 1992. He was buried from Beechgrove parish church, Aberdeen, where he had given long and faithful service as a member of the kirk session.<br>
