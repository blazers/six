<span class="headword">Burton,  Mary</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1819, <em>d.</em> 1909), <span class="occ">educational and social reformer</span>, was baptized on 7 February 1819 in Aberdeen, the youngest of four children of William Kinninmont Burton (<i>d</i>. 1819), lieutenant in the Rutlandshire fencible cavalry, and Elizabeth Paton (<i>d</i>. 1848), daughter of John Paton, laird of Grandholme, Aberdeen. The details of her early life are unknown. In 1832 she moved to Edinburgh with her widowed mother and brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4135/', "John Hill Burton")</script>, historian and advocate. Mary Burton never married. After her mother's death she considered becoming a nurse on the staff of Florence Nightingale, but found her true vocation at home: here she combined a lifetime's work on behalf of women with her responsibilities to raise orphaned nephews and nieces &#145;and to see that they were trained alike on the intellectual and practical side of life&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 22 March 1909). This commitment to practical as well as academic attainment was the hallmark of her contribution to education in Edinburgh.<br>
<br>In 1869 she persuaded the directors of the Watt Institution and School of Arts of Edinburgh, a pioneering technical college and forerunner of Heriot-Watt University, to open its classes to female students for the first time. Her niece, Ella, daughter of John Hill Burton, was one of the pioneering intake. Mary Burton followed up this achievement by becoming the first woman director of the Watt Institution in 1874. When the Watt Institution merged with George Heriot's trust to form Heriot-Watt College in 1885, she became a life governor of the college. She was an active supporter and honorary president of the Watt Literary Society. As befitted the governor of an institution that described itself as a &#145;people's college&#146;, she maintained that universities should open in the evening to admit working people.<br>
<br>Mary Burton was among the first women to be elected to public bodies responsible for money raised from local rates. From 1884 she served for many years on the St Cuthbert's parochial board, later Edinburgh parish council. The board managed poorhouses, asylums, and the allocation of clothing grants, school fees, apprenticeships, widows' pensions, and other provisions to poor and destitute people. In 1889 she unsuccessfully urged the board to petition parliament to enable county and town councils to provide schooling free of charge. This was typical of the then radical proposals she championed as a member, from 1885 to 1897, of the Edinburgh school board, which provided compulsory education for the city's children. On the election hustings she made a robust case for providing practical training for domestic responsibilities. Girls, she argued, should learn to use a sewing machine and boys the use of a saw and plane, adding that &#145;she herself could work with these tools and she had mended a floor before now&#146;  (<span class="italic">Edinburgh Evening News</span>, 24 March 1885). Once elected, she promoted classes in cookery and laundry, and the teaching of knitting and sewing to boys. She helped increase provision of school evening classes and argued that they should be open to all. Despite persistent opposition from some of her colleagues, she ensured that the board met in the evenings, so that &#145;working men&#146; members could attend.<br>
<br>An energetic landlord of tenement properties in Edinburgh's old town, Burton encouraged her tenants to embrace thrift and cleanliness and abstain from alcohol. In summer she held parties for them at her home, Liberton Bank, south of the city. A kindly, spare figure with &#145;fresh bright face and Quaker like garb&#146;, often seen driving her pony cart to meetings, Mary Burton was well known and fondly regarded by her contemporaries  (<span class="italic">Edinburgh Evening News</span>, 22 March 1909). She died at Elmhill House Royal Asylum, Aberdeen, on 19 March 1909, and was buried in Dean cemetery, Edinburgh, three days later. Her lifelong commitments were reflected in her will. This included legacies of &pound;100 to provide prizes for students attending evening classes at Heriot-Watt College, and to the Edinburgh Women's Suffrage Society to campaign &#145;for the admission of women to sit as members of parliament, either at Westminster or in a Scottish Parliament&#146;  (ibid., 23 March 1909).<br>
