<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Williamson,  Malcolm Benjamin Graham Christopher</span>  (1931&#150;2003), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, on 21 November 1931, the son of George Williamson, an Anglican clergyman, and his wife Bessie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wrigley. Simultaneously with his education at Barker College, Hornsby, New South Wales, from 1943 he studied the piano with Alexander Sverjensky at the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music in Sydney. Although he composed from a very young age, serious composition studies began with Eugene Goossens, also at the conservatorium, in 1949.<br>
<br>Williamson, however, was determined to travel and in 1950 sailed for London. Stimulated by the &#145;new&#146; European music of Schoenberg, Stravinsky, and Boulez, he settled in London permanently, and in 1953 undertook further composition studies with Erwin Stein, a former student of Schoenberg, and Elisabeth Lutyens, an exponent of serialism. He published his first pieces, two motets for unaccompanied three- and four-part choir, in 1954. Absorbing twelve-tone music, he combined it with a kind of modality and became fascinated with the French composer Olivier Messiaen, whose explicitly Catholic music resonated with Williamson's own recent conversion to Catholicism in 1952. Williamson remained profoundly influenced by Messiaen and developed his organ playing technique specifically in order to play this composer's works. During these early years in London he worked as a proofreader for a publishing firm and as a shop assistant in Harrods.<br>
<br>In 1955 Williamson's performance abilities paid off, and he was appointed assistant organist at the Church of the Immaculate Conception, Farm Street, London, a position he held until 1958. His expert keyboard playing was also useful in terms of promoting his compositions, and he was able to give the first performances of his own piano sonata no. 1 at the Aldeburgh festival and <span class="italic">Fons Amoris</span> for organ at the Royal Festival Hall in 1956. In 1958 he had what was to become a typical year of musical contrasts: he was appointed organist for St Peter's, Limehouse, supplemented his income by working as a Soho nightclub pianist, and performed as soloist for his piano concerto no. 1 at the Cheltenham festival. On 9 January 1960, at Stepney register office, he married Dolores Irene Daniel (<i>b</i>. 1930), daughter of Jacob Daniel, a retired department store director. They had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>By the beginning of the 1960s Williamson was determined to become a full-time composer and embarked on perhaps his most productive decade. In 1960 he completed his symphony for organ, his piano concerto no. 2, and his first Hammer Horror film score, for <span class="italic">The Brides of Dracula</span>. Writing prolifically and attracting wider notice, in 1963 he first really made an impact with the critical and popular success of his first opera, <span class="italic">Our Man in Havana</span>, premiered at Sadler's Wells Theatre on 2 July. Based on Graham Greene's novel set in pre-revolutionary Havana, his lively, rhythmic, and tuneful opera displayed more than a passing influence from contemporary musicals. Now a successful composer, for the next few years he received high-profile commissions, including a violin concerto for Yehudi Menuhin and the 1965 Bath festival and a sinfonietta for Sir Adrian Boult and the inauguration of BBC Radio 3. In the midst of this popularity he asserted his &#145;Australian-ness&#146; at the Conference on Music and Education in the Commonwealth at the University of Liverpool in 1965:<blockquote>when I think about it, I am certain that my music is characteristically Australian, though I have never tried to make it so. We Australians have to offer the world a persona compounded of forcefulness, brashness, a direct warmth of approach, sincerity which is not ashamed, and more of what the Americans call &#145;get-up-and-go&#146; than the Americans themselves possess. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 March 2003)</blockquote>By the late 1960s, however, Williamson began to lose what previously had been the almost unanimous support of the critics, who began to describe his music as &#145;too glib&#146;, &#145;too populist&#146;, &#145;too uncritical&#146;, and &#145;too diffuse&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>), despite continued audience success with a new form which he called &#145;cassations&#146;&#151;miniature concert-operas for children, with audience participation. Originally conceived as a way of introducing his own children to opera, the cassations were used at a summer school for children with disabilities and led him to further work with hospitals in Tanzania and Zambia. From 1970 his broadening interests led him to undertake a number of international residencies, including as composer-in-residence and honorary fellow at Westminster Choir College, Princeton, New Jersey (1970&#150;71), where he was made an honorary doctor of music, as creative arts fellow in Scandinavian literature at the Australian National University (1974&#150;81), and as composer-in-residence at Florida State University (1975).<br>
<br>In October 1975 Williamson, a non-Briton, was controversially appointed the nineteenth master of the queen's music, succeeding Sir Arthur Bliss, and the following year he was made CBE. (Hostile critics put his appointment down to his friendship with the prime minister, Harold Wilson.) A wave of official appointments followed, including president of the Birmingham Chamber Music Society (1975), and to the University of London Choir (1976), the Purbeck Festival of Music (1976), the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (1977), Sing for Pleasure (1977), and the British Society for Music Therapy (1977). If it was expected that an Australian master of the queen's music with more &#145;get-up-and-go&#146; was to reinvigorate the position, a very public disappointment unfolded during the queen's 1977 silver jubilee, when problems between Williamson and the conductor Bernard Haitink resulted in Williamson's commissioned work, his symphony no. 4, remaining unfinished and unperformed. This event marked a turning point with the British concert-going public, and Williamson never regained the level of support he previously enjoyed in the United Kingdom. Even his church music, which combined his own deeply felt but idiosyncratic religious themes with popular idioms, was now described as &#145;vacuous&#146;, &#145;shallow&#146;, and &#145;insincere&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>).<br>
<br>Continuing support, however, was forthcoming from Australia, eager to acknowledge its famous international composer. In 1982 Williamson travelled to Sydney to be the Ramaciotti medical research fellow at the University of New South Wales, where he was guest speaker at an international seminar on mental handicaps. The monumental symphony no. 6, commissioned to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, was performed and broadcast, utilizing all seven of the corporation's orchestras. Both Sydney and Melbourne universities awarded him honorary doctorates. In 1984, taking Australian landscape and history as its inspiration, he wrote his symphony no. 7 for string orchestra to mark the 150th anniversary of the state of Victoria, and in 1985 his <span class="italic">Lento for Strings</span> for the Philharmonia of Melbourne. In 1987 he was appointed a member of the Order of Australia for services to music and the mentally handicapped. For Australia's 1988 bicentenary celebrations he composed <span class="italic">The True Endeavour</span> for speaker, chorus, and orchestra, based on texts by the Australian historian Manning Clark. This was followed by <span class="italic">The Dawn is at Hand</span> (1989), a five-movement choral symphony derived from the Aboriginal poems of Oodgeroo Noonuccal (whose son made Williamson his blood brother). In 1989 he was given the Sir Bernard Heinze award for his outstanding contribution to music in Australia.<br>
<br>Back in the United Kingdom, Williamson did nothing to re-endear himself to the British public with his outspoken and provocative comments. When Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber was commissioned to write the music for the royal pageant celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the queen's coronation (1993), overlooking Williamson himself as master of the queen's music, Williamson's description of his rival as a &#145;cabaret composer&#146;, who does not write &#145;real music&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 March 2003), was seen to be in poor form, especially in the light of Williamson's own excursions into popular styles of music.<br>
<br>After 1995, and an expressive and well-reviewed song cycle, <span class="italic">A Year of Birds</span>, for soprano and orchestra (to poems by Iris Murdoch), a series of strokes left Williamson progressively unable to compose and, finally and tragically, unable to speak. Two staunch supporters remained: his publisher and partner Simon Gerald Edmund Campion (Williamson and his wife had divorced in 1978) and the conductor Christopher Austin, who from 1994 was responsible for regular performances of Williamson's music. He died on 2 March 2003 at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, from cardiac failure. He was survived by his partner, Simon Campion, and by the three children of his marriage. He left behind more than 120 published works, including seven symphonies, four concertos for piano, concertos for organ, violin, and harp, chamber music, operas, and a repertory of church and vocal music, all imbued with a range of absorbing preoccupations which included literature, history, Jewish music, jazz, religion, music therapy, and animal welfare.<br>
