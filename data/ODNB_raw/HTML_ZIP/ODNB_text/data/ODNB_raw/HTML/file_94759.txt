<span class="headword">Crawford, Sir  William Godfrey <span class="st"> [Bill]</span></span>  (1907&#150;2003), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 14 September 1907 at Wyld Court, Hawkchurch, near Axminster, Devon, the son of Henry Edward Venner Crawford, farmer, and his wife, Marion Ellinor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pharazyn. His father, the son of a sea captain who had been one of the first British settlers in New Zealand, had returned to inherit and farm the Devon property. Bill Crawford entered the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, in 1921, one of the first cadets to go straight to the newly enlarged college rather than begin their naval training at Osborne. Crawford did well, becoming chief cadet captain and being awarded the king's dirk; he also obtained colours for rugby and sailing, a lifelong passion. Promoted lieutenant in 1929, he qualified as a gunnery officer in 1932. While serving in the Mediterranean Fleet flagship <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> in 1934 he was put in charge of a guard of Royal Marines and seamen for the funeral of the assassinated King Alexander of Yugoslavia. 1937 saw both promotion to lieutenant-commander and a visit to King Boris of Bulgaria when HMS <i>Delhi</i>, the light cruiser in which Crawford was now serving, visited Varna. On 29 April 1939 he married Mary Felicity Rosa Williams (1911&#150;1995), second daughter of Sir Philip Francis Cunningham Williams, second baronet, of Little Bredy, Dorset. They had three sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1940 Crawford was appointed gunnery officer of the battleship <i>Rodney</i>, commanded by his uncle, Captain Frederick Dalrymple-Hamilton. The climax of this appointment was the engagement with the German battleship <i>Bismarck</i> (which had just sunk HMS <i>Hood</i>) in May 1941. Crawford hit the enemy at long range with <i>Rodney</i>'s third 16 inch salvo and his guns, together with the 14 inch of <i>King George V</i>, then remorselessly pounded <i>Bismarck</i> to a wreck. Crawford received the Distinguished Service Cross for his part in the battle and was promoted commander at the end of the year. 1942 saw more difficult circumstances as staff officer to the second in command of the Eastern Fleet. The Japanese onslaught forced the fleet back to east Africa but by the time Crawford left in 1944 it was beginning to return to the offensive. Crawford had been selected as executive officer of the light fleet carrier <i>Venerable</i>, fitting out at Cammell Lairds. He helped commission her in January 1945 and work her up into a fighting unit before she was deployed with three sisters to join the British Pacific Fleet. The light fleet carriers missed the major action but covered the reoccupation of British territory. Crawford, using mounted sailors, was put in charge of maintaining law and order in Hong Kong. He left <i>Venerable</i> in 1946 and was promoted captain the following year. In 1948 he was appointed to command HMS <i>Pelican</i> as captain (F) of the second frigate flotilla, based at Malta.<br>
<br>Crawford's career now began to emphasize training at its various levels, a calling that suited his gunnery officer's rigour and high standards. He was deputy director of the Royal Naval Staff College, Greenwich, in 1950&#150;52 and was then appointed in 1952&#150;3 to command the cruiser <i>Devonshire</i>, used for the sea training of officer cadets. This was followed by appointment in 1954 as captain of what had just been renamed the Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. His main task was to introduce the new scheme for entry at age eighteen designed by the committee on officer structure and training at the beginning of that year. Crawford had the daunting task of managing the institution's fundamental transformation from a school to a naval academy, the single most important change in Dartmouth's history.<br>
<br>Promotion to rear-admiral in 1956 was a just reward for these endeavours and, after two years at the Imperial Defence College, Crawford was selected in 1958 for another important task as the first flag officer sea training at Portland. Under Crawford's leadership his organization, in charge of the regular, exacting monitoring of the expertise and efficiency of ships' officers and men as a fighting team, became the single most important factor in maintaining the fleet's operational capability. Over two years Crawford personally inspected more than fifty ships at sea. He left this gruelling post in 1960 having been promoted vice admiral the previous year. He had by now developed a reputation for diplomacy as well as force of character, and he was sent to Washington as commander of the British naval staff and naval attach&eacute;. He was in post during the Cuba crisis and he had an excellent relationship with the US chief of naval operations, Admiral George Anderson. Anderson was with Crawford when President Kennedy called to order the naval &#145;quarantine&#146; of Cuba. Crawford had been appointed CB in 1958 and in 1961 he was knighted KBE.<br>
<br>Crawford retired in 1963, becoming the following year director of the overseas offices of the British Travel Association, a post he held until 1972. He also remained a prominent member of the Royal Cruising Club. His continued enthusiasm for yachting was reflected in a series of transatlantic crossings begun with old friends in 1980. When over ninety he was still crossing the channel to Guernsey. His other interest, like that of many of his fellow officers, was fishing. He and his wife lived in retirement at Whitchurch Canonicorum, near Bridport, Dorset. Following her death in 1995 and a deterioration in his health, he moved to Broadwindsor House nursing home, Beaminster. He died there on 16 June 2003, after a stroke, and was survived by his four children.<br>
