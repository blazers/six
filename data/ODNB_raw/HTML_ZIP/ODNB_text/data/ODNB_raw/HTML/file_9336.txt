<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fergusson,  James</span>  (1808&#150;1886), <span class="occ">architectural historian</span>, was born in Ayr, Scotland, in late 1808, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9339/', "Dr William Fergusson (1773&#150;1846)")</script>, an army surgeon with an interest in engineering as applied to military hospitals. Fergusson's family eventually settled in Windsor, and James was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and at a private school at Hounslow.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>After leaving school Fergusson went to India, where he was briefly employed in the mercantile firm of Fairlie, Fergusson &amp; Co. of Calcutta before going into business as an indigo planter in Bengal. According to his obituary in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, Fergusson made his fortune in this business in ten years and was able to retire, and as &#145;an expert draughtsman with a camera-lucida&#146; he explored India &#145;chiefly on a camel's back, from end to end and from side to side&#146; exploring the rock-cut temples of Ajanta, Ellora, and elsewhere  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>). In the preface to his <span class="italic">An historical inquiry into the true principles of beauty in art, more especially with reference to architecture</span> (1849)&#151;on the title-page of which he styles himself &#145;Architect&#146;&#151;Fergusson is less clear about either his financial independence or his ability to undertake a career as an architectural historian. He wrote there that<blockquote>few men have, either from education or the professional pursuits of their life, been less prepared for such a work as this. From boyhood I was destined to the desk. From school I passed to the counting-house; from that to an indigo factory &hellip; from this to becoming an acting and active partner in a large mercantile establishment, from the trammels of which, in spite of every endeavour, I have never been able to free myself. (Fergusson, <span class="italic">Historical Inquiry</span>, xi)</blockquote>However, he subsequently explains that although not well educated for the task, he had travelled extensively in the East, where he had<blockquote>had leisure to see a great deal of art; and, what is of far more importance, I have had time to think over and reflect on what I saw. For months together I lived among buildings and the works of art they contain, and I have looked on them long and steadfastly, and until I could read in the chisel marks on the stone the idea that guided the artist in his design, till I could put myself by his side, I never felt satisfied. (ibid., xiv)</blockquote>But at the same time he lamented,<blockquote>Another disadvantage of my mercantile pursuits has been the practical exclusion it entails from the best class of intellectual or artistic society &hellip; At one time I hoped that my previous publications might have remedied this last defect, and given me that introduction to literary society which might have entitled me to ask advice and assistance. They, however, have failed in this as in other respects. (ibid., xii)</blockquote>In 1840 he became a member of the Royal Asiatic Society, with whom he maintained a lifelong contact; at his death he was one of the society's vice-presidents.<h2>
<a name="Publishedworks"></a>Published works</h2>Fergusson's earliest published works were on the architecture of India: <span class="italic">Illustrations of the Rock-Cut Temples of India</span> (1845), <span class="italic">Picturesque Illustrations of Ancient Architecture in Hindostan</span> (1848), and the above-noted <span class="italic">An Historical Inquiry</span>, of which he wrote, &#145;The theory of art which runs through every page of it was elaborated from a study of Indian, Mahomedan, and Gothic architecture&#146;  (Fergusson, <span class="italic">Historical Inquiry</span>, xiii). Through these books Fergusson had by the early 1850s made a name for himself as one of the leading architectural historians, at least of the East. Indeed, John Ruskin wrote to his father on 18 February 1852, &#145;If Fergusson and [Charles] Cockerell were both at work in Venice, I should not be; but the one works in India, the other in Greece&#146;  (J. L. Bradley, ed., <span class="italic">Ruskin's Letters from Venice, 1851&#150;1852</span>, 1955, 185). Fergusson had made his last visit to India in 1845, and did not subsequently confine himself to Eastern historic architecture. Throughout his career he pursued a new, modern architectural style that would fully reflect what he considered to be the great achievements of the Victorian age. On the whole he considered his peers to have failed in this task, and was dismissive of modern Western architecture. He declared in his <span class="italic">An Historical Inquiry</span> that at that time Western architects &#145;have ceased to think, and can only copy&#146;  (Fergusson, <span class="italic">Historical Inquiry</span>, xv). He saw contemporary Britain as standing at a moral crossroads as her empire brought wealth and luxury: in one direction lay the sensuality and corruption of ancient Rome, in the other lay Athens, which was &#145;throughout all antiquity, and is now, an object of such unbounded admiration; and this though neither her polity nor her morals were perfect, but merely because she had cultivated the sciences and arts&#146;  (ibid., 7). He declared: &#145;We are fast verging to a state of wealth and luxury almost equal to that of Rome before she fell under the dominion of her emperors. &hellip; The path of Athens is as open to us as that of Rome&#146;  (ibid., 8).<br>
<br>Despite his interest in architectural history, and though he praised the achievements of British architecture in the middle ages, Fergusson sought a modern native architecture that would build upon these achievements and result in something &#145;that will be worthy of our nation, and worthy of engaging and employing the highest class of intellects that exists among us&#146;  (Fergusson, <span class="italic">Historical Inquiry</span>, 14). This greatness did not lie in the sorry emulation which Fergusson saw in either Greek or Gothic revivalism. At the conclusion of his long introduction to <span class="italic">An Historical Inquiry</span> he observed that many public buildings and mansions were being built in Britain of greater dimensions and ornaments than those of ancient Greece or the middle ages, and that &#145;the elements of architectural excellence are in our hands&#146;  (ibid., 169). Britons could either attempt to surpass these achievements and<blockquote>clothe the land with beauty; or &hellip; go on erecting edifices which are merely monuments of our servility and ignorance, till we have filled the land with dried specimens of past civilisations, as if only to tell posterity that we had no art of our own, and dared not think for ourselves. (ibid.)</blockquote>Fundamentally, he believed that &#145;we have no Style of architecture&#146; and considered the Gothic revival to be &#145;a standing insult to the age we live in&#146;  (J. Fergusson, <span class="italic">History of the Modern Styles of Architecture</span>, 1863, 129). In his opinion it was industrial architecture and engineering that really incorporated the achievements of the modern age, because they were strictly contemporary; thus &#145;the great steam-engine factories&#146; were &#145;among the most remarkable triumphs of mind over matter that the world has yet witnessed&#146;, and lighthouses were &#145;the most perfect specimens of modern architecture&#146;  (<span class="italic">QR</span>, 114, 1823, 289&#150;331). With certain qualifications, the Crystal Palace built to house the Great Exhibition of 1851 (and for which he was for a time a secretary) was the type of modern architecture he praised. An anonymous letter possibly written by Fergusson in <span class="italic">The Ecclesiologist</span> praised this building: &#145;the construction is almost invariably real, and all its beauty depends on the development of that construction&#146;  (Hitchcock, 1.546). It has been suggested that it was Fergusson who introduced this catchword &#145;real&#146;, which was popular with critics in the 1850s as a descriptive for contemporary architecture. But, all told, Fergusson did not particularly propose a new style himself: it was enough for him to suggest that the Royal Institute of British Architects &#145;must write over its doors, &#147;Archaeology is not Architecture&#148;&#146;  (Crook, 105).<br>
<br>This general viewpoint was reiterated throughout Fergusson's published works, as well as in the critical essays he wrote for contemporary journals such as <span class="italic">The Builder</span>. The architectural style and buildings designed and built by Pugin, William Burges, Gilbert Scott, and Benjamin Woodward were all targets for attack. He entered into the great debate of 1850&#150;51 surrounding &#145;copyism&#146;, sparked off by Pugin's restatement of his position which demanded the most humble emulation of the past. Fergusson condemned the &#145;servile doctrines of copying&#146; and stated his position that &#145;truth in [architectural] art consists of representing faithfully the wants and feelings of the people who use [buildings] and of the age which gave birth to [them]&#146;  (Hitchcock, 1.605&#150;6). In the early 1870s, as a member of the executive committee for the completion of St Paul's, Fergusson strongly (and sensibly) opposed the appointment of Burges, a notorious Gothicist, to complete the work of Christopher Wren's baroque cathedral. In 1874 he was one of four architects who headed an attack on Burges's designs for the cathedral as being against Wren's style, leading to Burges's suspension from the project. In a strong piece in the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> Fergusson wrote that Burges's scheme was &#145;one of the most fantastic proposals &hellip; ever submitted in seriousness to any body of men&#146;  (<span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>, 24, 1874, 750&#150;51). Burges in turn described Fergusson's comments as &#145;personal and scurrilous&#146;  (Crook, 164). Such sparks flew in the argument between them that <span class="italic">The Architect</span> described the two men as being &#145;like flint and steel&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Architect</span>, 12, 1874, 297). But in Fergusson's no less ambitious proposal, the cathedral would have a completely reconstructed choir with a second, octagonal dome decorated with Ravenna mosaics. <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> later noted of Fergusson's contribution to this committee that &#145;opinion differs widely as to the soundness of his views&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>).<h2>
<a name="AHistoryofArchitectureinAllCountries"></a>A History of Architecture in All Countries</h2>Fergusson's greatest published achievement was what became his four-volume <span class="italic">A History of Architecture in All Countries</span>. Volumes 1 and 2 were first published in London in 1865 and 1867; volume 3 was eventually represented by his <span class="italic">History of Indian and Eastern Architecture</span> (1876) and volume 4 by <span class="italic">History of the Modern Styles of Architecture</span> (1862). These volumes went through a number of revised editions, and according to <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> became &#145;an established manual on the subject for students&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>). This was the first book actually to make him money: the previous ones had been published at his own expense. Despite sometimes calling himself an architect, Fergusson never actually practised in this capacity, though he did make designs for his factory in Bengal, his own house at 20 Langham Place, west London, and the country mansion at Wimbledon built for his friend John Murray. He also designed the gallery at Kew for Miss North's collection of pictures of plants.<h2>
<a name="Publicappointments"></a>Public appointments</h2>Fergusson's critical writings and researches brought him various official appointments. He was interested in military construction and in 1849 proposed a &#145;new system of fortification by earthworks&#146;; in 1852 he noted the defenceless state of Portsmouth. Though his suggestions were not generally adopted, he was appointed in 1857 as a member of the royal commission to inquire into the defences of the United Kingdom. In the early 1860s Fergusson was appointed as one of the judges to the committee for the Crimea Memorial Church in Constantinople, a building intended to be a national memorial for the Crimean War. The competition was won in 1857 by Burges, but there followed a long process of change and compromise. In 1867 Fergusson arranged the collection of photographs and casts in the Indian court of the Universal Exhibition at Paris, and in 1869 he was appointed by Sir Henry Layard, the chief commissioner of works, to be his assistant, but he only held the position for the eight months until Layard's retirement. Fergusson was also active on the council of the Royal Geographical Society, while in 1871 the Royal Institute of British Architects awarded him its gold medal &#145;for his great merits&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Laterworks"></a>Later works</h2>Despite his aphorism &#145;archaeology is not architecture&#146;, Fergusson remained keenly interested in archaeology after his return from India. He published proposals for the possible reconstruction of the palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis (1851), the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus (1862), and the temple of Diana at Ephesus (1883). He made suggestions to Heinrich Schliemann in his excavations of the cities of Troy, Mycenae, and Tiryns, and Schliemann credited Fergusson in the dedication to <span class="italic">Tiryns</span>, where he described him as &#145;eminent alike for his knowledge of art and for the original genius which he has applied to the solution of some of its most difficult problems&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>). A particular interest was the topography and temples of ancient Jerusalem, which stimulated a number of short books, lectures, and articles between 1847 and 1878. His confident assertion of the site of the holy sepulchre in 1860 helped prompt an accurate survey of the city carried out by Captain C. W. Wilson of the Royal Engineers, and his strong pursuit of his views was said to have helped prompt the establishment of the Palestine Exploration Fund  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Prehistoric remains were also the subject of a number of papers and a book (<span class="italic">Rude Stone Monuments in All Countries</span>, 1872), though against general scholarly opinion he argued that Stonehenge was a post-Roman monument and his work on ancient tree and serpent worship was fanciful. A particular interest in his final years was attempting to explain how Greek and Roman temples were lit by natural light: a book on this subject was published in 1883.<br>
<br>Fergusson continued writing and publishing on architecture and antiquities almost right up to December 1885, when he suffered a paralytic attack. He died at his home at Langham Place on 9 January 1886 and was buried at Highgate cemetery. He had never married. His insecurity at his lack of a university education perhaps explains some of the vehemence of opinion that characterized Fergusson's long career as a critic of Victorian architecture. The president of the Royal Asiatic Society, Henry Yule, reflected that &#145;he held original views, and strong ones &hellip; on most subjects. &hellip; His convictions on all subjects were intense. &hellip; Even those who gave and took hard knocks in strife with him ache, we trust, no longer&#146;  (Yule, iv). <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> summed up his career with the observation that, although he was &#145;not so great an authority, nor so profoundly versed in design, as many of his admirers assumed, he was undoubtedly a man of note&#146; who deserved to be remembered for his great histories of architecture  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 109).<blockquote>His acute analysis and criticism, always intended to illustrate the perfection of common sense, did not invariably carry conviction, and such subjects as &#145;Rude Stone Monuments&#146; were scarcely suited to his powers, yet his clear, laborious, and searching methods commanded attention, and never failed to gain respect.
