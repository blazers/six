<span class="headword">Bell,  William  Blair-</span>  (1871&#150;1936), <span class="occ">gynaecologist</span>, was born on 28 September 1871 at Rutland House, New Brighton, Cheshire, the second of eight children of William Bell JP, general practitioner, and his wife, Helen Barbara, daughter of General Butcher. In 1931 he added his second forename to his surname by means of a hyphen; at the height of his career he thought that Blair-Bell would be a more distinguished name by which to be known and remembered. He was educated at Rossall School, Lancashire (1885&#150;90), and at King's College Hospital and medical school, London (1890&#150;96). He won distinction in a number of sports, including hurdling, and showed a precocious bent for research, carrying out interesting anatomical dissections and publishing a paper in the <span class="italic">King's College Hospital Reports</span> while still a student. After qualifying in 1896 he returned to Cheshire, set up in general practice in Wallasey, and on 7 June 1898 married his cousin Florence Bell (<i>d</i>. 1929), daughter of his uncle John Bell, a solicitor in Surbiton, Surrey.<br>
<br>In 1905 Bell was appointed honorary assistant consulting gynaecologist to the Liverpool Royal Infirmary. While still a general practitioner he published more than a dozen papers on a wide variety of subjects, the beginning of a series of no fewer than 130 major contributions to medical literature made over the next thirty years. His <span class="italic">Principles of Gynaecology</span> was published in 1910. In 1921 he succeeded Henry Briggs as professor of midwifery and gynaecology at Liverpool University, a post he retained until 1931. In 1916 he published <span class="italic">The Sex Complex</span>, and in 1919 <span class="italic">The Pituitary</span>, both of which were recognized as classics and which contained much new material; they described a series of laboratory and animal experiments which he had undertaken himself. At that time knowledge of endocrinology was very elementary and it was the acknowledged belief that the sex of an individual depended solely upon the gonads (ovary and testis). Blair-Bell's original research, both laboratory and clinical, broadened the concept of the interaction of the numerous ductless glands between one and the other, the subject of his Arris and Gale lecture at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1913, which was published in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> in the same year.<br>
<br>During the next ten years Bell carried out major research, in collaboration with colleagues at London University, on the causes and nature of cancer; <span class="italic">Cancer and Cancer Research</span> was published in 1928, and <span class="italic">Some Aspects of the Causes of the Cancer Problem</span> in 1930. 566 patients were treated with a compound of lead as an adjunct to surgery; this was one of the first uses of a chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of cancer. Although this particular agent failed the foundation was laid for the development of other, more successful, ones in future years. In 1929 the British (later Royal) College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists was founded, after several years of planning by Bell and his colleagues. This was a milestone in medical history because it established the principle of giving recognition to a specialism previously included in the wider field of medicine and surgery. Bell became the college's first president; his benefactions to the college after his death included a house in Queen Anne Street, London, which became the first home of the college, as well as funds for lectures and research.<br>
<br>Blair-Bell was an outstanding teacher, clinician, and surgeon. He was universally regarded as the most distinguished gynaecologist of his era, noted not only for his original clinical and scientific researches but also for the administrative abilities and the legalistic knowledge which he displayed in drawing up the final constitution of the new college which he had founded. His achievements were remarkable and were recognized by the many honours and distinctions conferred upon him. He was awarded honorary fellowships of the Royal College of Surgeons and of the American College of Surgeons, as well as of many obstetric and gynaecological societies in Great Britain and overseas. He was awarded the LLD of both Glasgow and Liverpool universities. He became a commander of the royal order of the Star of Romania. Yet in spite of his great distinctions he was a complex character in many ways. He was an outspoken autocrat, who resented criticism and who enjoyed a fight with anyone who opposed his views; this brought him enemies as well as admirers and friends. Although childless himself he was fond of children, and his spaniel, Rogue, was his constant companion when he was at home. Lord Dawson best summarized his character: &#145;He was a torch bearer who never forgot&#151;or allowed anyone else to forget&#151;that he was carrying a torch&#146;. His portrait, which hangs in the president's room at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, portrays a man with a dynamic personality, upright stance, and determined features.<br>
<br>Blair-Bell died of a coronary thrombosis, on 25 January 1936, while on a train carrying him from London to Shrewsbury. He was buried at St Chad's parish church, West Felton, Shropshire.<br>
