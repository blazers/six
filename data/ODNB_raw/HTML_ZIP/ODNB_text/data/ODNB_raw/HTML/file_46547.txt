<div class="para">
<span class="headword">MacLeod,  Malcolm Neynoe</span>  (1882&#150;1969), <span class="occ">surveyor</span>, was born on 23 May 1882, probably in Rajpur Chumparan, Bihar, India, the eldest son of Malcolm Neynoe MacLeod, who was in charge of an indigo factory in Bihar, and his wife, Eliza Agnes. He attended Aird House School, Edinburgh (1887&#150;95), and then Rugby School (1896&#150;8). At the age of sixteen he passed into the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. Although he was the youngest cadet in his term, he passed out first in 1900, gaining the Pollock and Queen Victoria gold medals and prizes for military topography and geometrical drawing. He was commissioned in the Royal Engineers on 2 May 1900.<br>
<br>MacLeod was posted to India in May 1902 and spent three years at the military works services at Jubbulpore and in the office of the director-general military works at Simla before in 1905 he joined the survey of India. While there he suffered an onslaught of enteric fever from which he never fully recovered. After the first of three periods of six months' sick leave he returned to India to work on the surveys of the Khyber and Malakand passes, and in the Central Provinces and the Punjab. He was promoted captain in May 1910 and then transferred to the headquarters of the survey of India in Calcutta. Following another bout of fever he was sent to the healthier climate of the trans-frontier mapping office at Simla.<br>
<br>In 1914 MacLeod returned to England on a year's leave to improve his health. At the beginning of 1915 he was ordered to Buxton to raise and train the 145 army troops company of the Royal Engineers. He took this company, now part of the 11th corps, to France in September 1915. In 1916 he raised the 4th field survey company for the newly formed Fourth Army, which was to deliver the great Somme offensive. MacLeod's survey company was to develop new survey methods, of which the most important was &#145;predicted artillery fire&#146;, the technique of firing at pre-selected, accurately surveyed targets without making preliminary range-finding shots, which at once destroyed all element of surprise and revealed the allied gun positions. MacLeod considered this technique to have been decisive in the victories of Cambrai in 1916 and after. Predicted artillery bombardment came to constitute the real attack, while the infantry advance became the supporting operation, a reversal of the traditional roles of the two arms. MacLeod was promoted major in 1916, and acting lieutenant-colonel in 1918, was twice mentioned in dispatches, and was awarded the DSO and MC. In 1919 he formed and commanded the 1st survey company of the Royal Artillery. He then went as chief instructor (survey) to the School of Artillery, Larkhill, where he initiated the technical side of artillery survey.<br>
<br>In early 1923 MacLeod joined the Ordnance Survey at Southampton. On 9 January 1924 he married Elsie May (<i>b</i>. 1892/3, <i>d</i>. after 1978), the daughter of William Edward Gould of Wootton, New Milton. They had no children. He remained at the Ordnance Survey for six years. In 1929 he became general staff officer in 1 MI4, the geographical section of the general staff (GSGS), whose main duties were the provision of maps for war, the collection of geographical and topographical information of the empire and foreign countries, and the co-ordination of all survey organizations in the empire. MacLeod considered that survey allied to artillery fire would be critical in any future conflict. He therefore proposed a programme to provide maps at scales of 1:250,000 for strategic moves, 1:50,000 for mobile phases, and 1:25,000 for set-piece battles. MacLeod's view that artillery was the key to future warfare was publicly contested by proponents of tank theories such as J. F. C. Fuller and Basil Liddell Hart. MacLeod promoted his ideas by writing papers in the <span class="italic">Royal Engineers Journal</span> and the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal United Services Institution</span>, and authority was eventually given for the formation of the 19th field survey company of the Royal Engineers to produce MacLeod's maps in war.<br>
<br>In February 1935 MacLeod was appointed director-general of the Ordnance Survey, with the rank of brigadier. The war, post-war urban expansion and road building, and financial retrenchment had brought the Ordnance Survey to its knees, and, just as the government was passing legislation such as the <span class="roman">Town and Country Planning Act</span> (1932) which could not be put into effect without up-to-date plans, the survey lacked the manpower to meet numerous demands made upon it. A departmental committee was appointed in 1935 to address the national mapping crisis. MacLeod had already initiated the retriangulation of Great Britain, and now he seized the opportunity to transform the large-scale Ordnance Survey plans from their nineteenth-century format of county maps, many based on different meridians, into a homogeneous national series. It was with difficulty that his strong views on the necessity of a metric grid, the kilometre-square 1:2500 format, the survey of urban areas at the scale of 1:1250, continuous revision, and the introduction of the 1:25,000 map prevailed. However, he can be considered the architect of the structure of post-war Ordnance Survey cartography, and it was with justification that he claimed that the final report of the committee, published in 1938, amounted to a new charter for the Ordnance Survey.<br>
<br>More staff were recruited to implement MacLeod's proposals, and the increased responsibilities borne by the director-general led to the position's being upgraded from brigadier to major-general, to which rank MacLeod was promoted in March 1939 (he was later created CB). Civilian mapping, however, took second place to military mapping during the Second World War. As director-general MacLeod was responsible for the training and mobilization of the field survey units of the field army. On mobilization he was created inspector of survey units.<br>
<br>When MacLeod retired on 1 June 1943 the Ordnance Survey had printed 100 million maps for military use. He had also recast the mapping of Great Britain on new sheet lines and introduced enamelled metal plates in place of paper as the original drawing support for the large-scale plans and the systematic use of air photography for the revision of the 1:2500 plans. In retirement MacLeod became second in command of the 12th battalion Hampshire Home Guard. After the war he undertook several unpaid and semi-public duties, including the chairmanship of the Ministry of Labour's Disablement Advisory Committee. In 1946 he advised the Iraqi government on their surveys. He had been aide-de-camp to Edward VIII and George VI from 1936 to 1939, and was colonel commandant from 1941 to 1950.<br>
<br>MacLeod was a tall man of strong character, with great kindness and charm. The junior civilian staff at the Ordnance Survey remembered him affectionately for his approachability and willingness to stop and talk. When young he was an accomplished athlete. He served on the council of the Royal Geographical Society three times in the 1930s, and was vice-president from 1939 to 1941. In retirement he continued to interest himself in professional and scientific matters. He was an honorary member of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and chairman of the Field Survey Association.<br>
<br>MacLeod died on 1 August 1969 of heart failure at his home, Littlehaven, Beaulieu Road, Dibden Purlieu, Hampshire, survived by his widow.<br>
