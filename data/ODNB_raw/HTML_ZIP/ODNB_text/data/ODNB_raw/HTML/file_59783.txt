<span class="headword">Brinson,  Peter Neilson</span>  (1920&#150;1995), <span class="occ">writer and lecturer on dance</span>, was born on 6 March 1920 at Sea View Villa, North Parade, Llandudno, the son of Harold Neilson Brinson, a major in the King's Liverpool regiment and cotton broker, and his wife, Vera Mabel Mathison. He was educated at Denstone College, Staffordshire, before going up to Keble College, Oxford, in 1938. During the Second World War, which interrupted his studies, he joined the Royal Artillery and achieved the rank of captain. He served as tank commander with General Montgomery at El Alamein. After the war Brinson went back to Oxford and took a first in philosophy, politics, and economics in 1948. In that year he joined the London Film Centre as scriptwriter and research director. During this time he became actively involved with classical ballet. In 1952 he wrote and produced <span class="italic">The Black Swan</span>, featuring the Covent Garden stars Beryl Gray and John Field, the first ballet film to use the new techniques of stereoscope. In the same year he began as a freelance writer on dance for <span class="italic">The Times</span> and for specialist dance magazines. In 1954 he was appointed as the first editor of the magazine <span class="italic">Films and Filming</span>. He wrote widely on the arts and was also invited to give a series of extramural lectures on dance for the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and London.<br>
<br>In 1963 Brinson published <span class="italic">The Choreographic Art</span> with Peggy van Praag, who later became director of the Australian Ballet. In 1964 he established Ballet for All, a touring programme of the Royal Ballet. Working with a small group of dancers and then actors, he criss-crossed the British Isles presenting penetrating introductions to some of the most popular works. As deviser, writer, and presenter he gave thousands of adults and children their first experience of the power and appeal of ballet. Though rooted in ballet, he quickly recognized and embraced the importance of contemporary dance, particularly in the work of Martha Graham. Brinson developed a strong association with the work of the London School of Contemporary Dance and its founder, Robin Howard. His driving vision was always of a unified, national dance culture in which all forms of dance were valued and provided for.<br>
<br>In 1968 Brinson was appointed director of the Royal Academy of Dancing in London and in 1972 director of the UK and Commonwealth branch of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation. During the next ten years he took a leading role in promoting national and international initiatives in the arts, education, and community development. Through strategic funding of people and projects, initiating national commissions, and related research and publications he was at the epicentre of innovation in each of these areas.<br>
<br>Brinson had great powers of synthesis and overview and was in constant demand to chair commissions, to give keynote addresses, to lead inquiries, and to moderate conferences and symposia. Through the Gulbenkian Foundation he wrote or contributed to seminal works on the arts and public policy. These included <span class="italic">Dance Education and Training</span> (1980) and <span class="italic">The Arts Britain Ignores</span> (1980), as well as <span class="italic">The Economic Situation of the Visual Artist</span> and <span class="italic">The Arts in Schools: Principles, Practice and Provision</span>. He chaired the dance board of the Council for National Academic Awards, prepared reports for Commonwealth governments, and accepted academic appointments at York University, Toronto, as adjunct professor of dance, and at Goldsmiths' College, London.<br>
<br>Through his work Brinson helped gain respectability for dance in education, both as a practical discipline and as a subject of serious study. He was instrumental in establishing a chair of dance studies at the University of Surrey, the first of its type in the United Kingdom. He was uniquely qualified to fill this position but his role in creating it effectively disqualified him. In 1982 he left the Gulbenkian Foundation to become head of postgraduate studies at the Laban Centre at Goldsmiths' College, University of London, to advise and influence new generations of dance scholars.<br>
<br>Brinson travelled ceaselessly throughout the world, promoting and supporting the development of dance and dance education. He developed particularly close ties with Australia, Canada, Ireland, and Hong Kong. In 1992 he was awarded the Digital Dance award for services to dance education and training. With typical grace he donated the prize money to a pilot scheme for a national dancers' injury and health scheme.<br>
<br>Brinson was a tall, slim man with an elegant bearing who was often taken to be fifteen or twenty years younger than he was. He shared much of his adult life with his devoted partner Werdon Douglas Anglin. They lived and worked together for twenty years, residing for much of that time in their welcoming, book-lined home in Stockwell, south London. Always charming and engaging, Brinson listened intently and spoke with a calm authority, his conversation often interrupted by a gentle, self-conscious laugh. He was a man of fine sensibilities and taste, not least in wine. His favoured aperitif was a cocktail of dry sherry and dry white wine, known to many in his circle as a Brinson.<br>
<br>In 1988 Peter Brinson was diagnosed as suffering from myelofibrosis. He faced the disease with strength and persistence, outliving considerably the early forecasts of his doctors. The illness required regular and lengthy blood transfusions. Typically, he came to value these as positive times when he could work and write without the interruption of meetings or telephone calls. He died at Trinity Hospice, Clapham, London, on 7 April 1995, and was cremated. During his lifetime he was in turn a film-maker, journalist, academic, and social entrepreneur. Brinson excelled in all these roles and brought to them a consistent passion for the arts, for social justice, and for equality. In particular, he played a leading role in transforming the nature and status of dance education in Britain and in many other parts of the world.<br>
