<span class="headword">Jay,  Edith Katherine  Spicer</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>E.  Livingston Prescott]</span>  (1847&#150;1901), <span class="occ">writer and philanthropist</span>, was born on 6 March 1847 at 11 Norfolk Street, Park Lane, London, the daughter of Samuel Jay (1800/01&#150;1881), barrister, and his wife, Elizabeth Maria Jane Spicer. Both sides of Jay's family had army connections. On her father's side she was the great-niece of Major Alexander Livingston of the 12th dragoons, a decorated hero in the Peninsular War; on her mother's side she was the granddaughter of Colonel Spicer of the 2nd Life Guards and lieutenant-colonel in the Queen's Bays. Jay was also related to Lord Farnborough and to Sir George Prescott, bt, of Theobald's Park, Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>When Jay started publishing her books&#151;mostly fiction with military settings&#151;her pen-name, E. Livingston Prescott, paid allegiance to two of her forebears. The name also concealed her sex&#151;she was, after all, entering the indubitably masculine world of Kipling's poetry and fiction&#151;and reviewers tended to assume she was a man. Jay published at least eighteen books, several of them posthumously, between 1896 and 1904. Most were novels or collections of tales. Representative titles suggest some of Jay's fictional interests: <span class="italic">The Rip's Redemption: a Trooper's Story</span> (1897); <span class="italic">Scarlet and Steel: some Modern Military Episodes</span> (1897); <span class="italic">Red-Coat Romances</span> (1898). Her plots often turn on the reformation of characters whose flaws include drunkenness and abuse of authority. She was especially exercised by the practice of flogging military prisoners. Reviewers' assessments of her fiction range from &#145;very cleverly written&#146;  (<span class="italic">New York Times</span>, 17 May 1896) to &#145;these books do violence to every principle of good novel-writing&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Dial</span>, 93).<br>
<br>Jay's involvement with the army went beyond her family and her fiction. She served as honourable lady superintendent of the London Soldiers' Home and Guards' Home until her health failed. When in hopes of alleviating her health problems she moved to Sandgate on the Kent coast, Jay made her home available to the troopers stationed at nearby Shorncliffe camp at what she called &#145;Cavalry Circle&#146;. She also appointed army men as two of the three executors of her will.<br>
<br>Jay's commitment to worthy causes testifies to the generosity of her spirit. In addition to her work for the London Soldiers' Home and Guards' Home, she willed pictures and the royalties from her books after her death to the Home for Incurables, Streatham Common. She left bequests to the Bridge of Hope Mission, London, to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, and to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Not forgetting her army friends, she willed legacies to the Papillon Soldiers' Institute, Sandgate, and to the Soldiers' Christian Association. She was also associated with the Religious Tract Society, which published two of her books after her death, and with the Willow Dene Mission in Clapham.<br>
<br>For over ten years Jay suffered from rheumatoid arthritis; she finally died from renal and cardiac arrest at her home, Channel Bower, Riviera, Sandgate, on 3 December 1901. So moved by her death were the soldiers of Shorncliffe camp that extraordinary arrangements were made for her to be buried on 9 December in the military cemetery there. Her coffin, draped in the union jack, was carried from her home to the burial-grounds accompanied by Sandgate coastguards and soldiers of the 3rd provisional regiment of dragoons. Shopkeepers along the route of the procession drew their blinds. According to her wish, a <span class="roman">Bible</span> was placed in her grave.<br>
