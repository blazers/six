<span class="headword">Yorke,  Philip</span>, second earl of Hardwicke  (1720&#150;1790), <span class="occ">politician and writer</span>, eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30245/', "Philip Yorke, first earl of Hardwicke (1690&#150;1764)")</script>, and his wife, Margaret Lygon (<i>c</i>.1695&#150;1761), daughter of Charles Cocks, MP for Worcester, was born on 9 December 1720. His siblings included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30243/', "Joseph Yorke")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30237/', "Charles Yorke")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68350/', "Elizabeth Anson")</script>. He was educated at Newcome's school, Hackney, and afterwards by private tutors, including Samuel Salter. In 1737 he matriculated at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, from which he received the degree of LLD in 1749. In 1738 his father provided him with the sinecure post of teller of the exchequer, which by 1782 was worth &pound;7000 a year. On 22 May 1740 he married Lady Jemima Campbell (1722&#150;1797) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68351/', "Yorke, Jemima, suo jure Marchioness Grey")</script>], only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4515/', "John Campbell, third earl of Breadalbane (bap. 1696, d. 1782)")</script>, who became Marchioness Grey upon the death of her maternal grandfather that same year. They had two daughters: Amabel [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68352/', "Campbell, Amabel Hume-, suo jure Countess De Grey")</script>], who married Alexander, Viscount Polwarth, eldest son of the last earl of Marchmont, in 1772, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68353/', "Mary Jemima Robinson")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68351/', "Yorke, Jemima, suo jure Marchioness Grey")</script>], who married the second Baron Grantham in 1780.<br>
<br>In 1741 Yorke was elected to the House of Commons for Reigate, Surrey, which he continued to represent until 1747. His political career began promisingly, as &#145;he was chosen to second the address in 1743, to move it in 1744, and to be a manager of Lord Lovat's trial in 1747. He also spoke for the Government on the continuing of British troops to Flanders in January 1744 and on the Hanoverians in April 1746&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1715&#150;54</span>). Beyond that, however, he was an infrequent speaker, and his main contribution to the House of Commons was a diary of debates which he kept between December 1743 and April 1745, which has been described as &#145;the most trustworthy and impartial authority on the parliamentary history of the period&#146;  (ibid.). In 1747 Yorke was chosen by the general meeting of the county to stand for Cambridgeshire, where his father's estate of Wimpole and near which his wife's estate of Wrest were situated. During the election, his father advised him on maintaining his health: &#145;If you find yourself hot and dry, drink negus, I mean wine and warm water. And be sure to take care that your bed and sheets are <i>in all places</i> well aired&#146;  (ibid.). In order to ensure his election, his father spent over &pound;2000 treating the constituents, a &#145;monstrous sum&#146;, he later complained, &#145;for an election without any opposition&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>In 1754 Yorke became Lord Royston when his father was created earl of Hardwicke. He was sworn of the privy council on the accession of George III, and he took his seat in the House of Lords as the earl of Hardwicke upon his father's death in 1764. He was a member (without office) of the first Rockingham administration, and was offered the northern seals upon Grafton's resignation in 1766, but he declined for reasons of ill health. Although his health prevented him from taking an active role in opposition during the Grafton and North administrations, he remained an important figure in whig circles. Party meetings were frequently held at his town house, and he was consulted on key matters, including the arrangements which resulted in the formation of the second Rockingham administration. He also served as lord lieutenant of Cambridgeshire from 1757 and as high steward of the University of Cambridge from 1764 until his death.<br>
<br>Although Hardwicke continued the family tradition in politics, he was never truly a politician. An ample income, poor health, and intellectual leanings disinclined him from an active public life. Instead, he preferred literary pursuits and collecting historical documents. In 1741 he was elected fellow of the Royal Society and in 1744 fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. While at Cambridge he contributed some English verses to the <span class="italic">Pietas academiae Cantabrigiensis in funere serenissimae Principis Willelminae Carolinae</span> (1738), and with his brother Charles wrote the greater portion of the <span class="italic">Athenian letters, or, The epistolary correspondence of an agent of the king of Persia, residing at Athens during the Peloponnesian War</span> (1741). The latter work was an academic exercise edited by Thomas Birch, and other contributors included Henry Coventry, John Green, Samuel Salter, Catherine Talbot, Daniel Wray, George Henry Rooke, John Heaston, and John Lawry. The <span class="italic">Athenian Letters</span> was printed for private circulation only, with a first edition of only ten copies and a second, which did not appear until 1781, of 100 copies. In 1792 the vogue for historic fiction created by Barth&eacute;lemy's <span class="italic">Voyage de jeune Anacharsis en Gr&egrave;ce</span> (1788) led to a pirated edition of the <span class="italic">Letters</span> being printed in Dublin, but this was subsequently suppressed and was superseded in 1798 by a new edition that had the imprimatur of the third earl of Hardwicke and was furnished with a geographical index, maps, and engravings. A new edition by Archdeacon Coxe appeared in 1810, and another edition was printed at Basel in 1800. There were also French translations by Villeterque and Christophe, published in Paris in 1803. Hardwicke also edited <span class="italic">Letters from and to Sir Dudley Carleton, Knt, During his Embassy in Holland</span> (1757; 2nd edn, 1775; 3rd edn, 1780) and <span class="italic">Miscellaneous State Papers from 1501 to 1726</span> (1778). In 1783 he produced <span class="italic">Walpoliana</span>, a collection of anecdotes about Sir Robert Walpole, and his marginalia were used for the annotations marked &#145;H&#146; in the Oxford edition of Burnet's <span class="italic">Own Time</span> (1823). Hardwicke was a prominent man in intellectual and antiquarian circles, as is evidenced by Horace Walpole's advice to Horace Mann in 1757:<blockquote>That family is very powerful; the eldest brother, Lord Royston, is historically curious and political; if, without its appearing too forced, you could at any time send him uncommon letters, papers, manifestoes, and things of that sort, it might do you good service. (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1715&#150;54</span>)</blockquote>Hardwicke died on 16 May 1790, at his house in St James's Square, London. His seat at Wrest and the appendant estates of the dukes of Kent passed to his daughters. In the absence of a male heir, the title went to his nephew Philip Yorke (1757&#150;1834), eldest son of his brother Charles. Hardwicke's wife died on 11 January 1797.<br>
