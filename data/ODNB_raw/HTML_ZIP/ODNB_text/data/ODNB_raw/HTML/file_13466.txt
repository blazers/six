<span class="headword">Hogenberg,  Frans <span class="st"> [Franz]</span></span>  (<em>c.</em>1540&#150;<em>c.</em>1590), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, and his brother <a name="cosubject_13467"></a><span class="headword">Remigius Hogenberg</span>  (<em>c.</em>1536&#150;<em>c.</em>1588), also an <span class="occ">engraver</span>, were born in Mechelen, just south of Antwerp, the sons of Nicolas Hogenberg (also Nikolaus, and sometimes called Hans, Johann, or Johannes in apparent confusion with his nephew of that name; <i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1500, <i>d</i>. in or before 1539), an engraver, etcher, and woodcutter who was probably born in Germany but worked for most of his life in the Netherlands. The two brothers, their father, and Frans's sons Abraham and Johannes formed a notable Netherlandish family of artists who moved between Germany, France, England, and the Netherlands and, though not among the first artists and engravers of their day, were industrious, capable, and adaptable.<br>
<br>Frans Hogenberg may have trained as an engraver in Mechelen but was from the 1550s in Antwerp, where he worked with Abraham Ortelius. It has been suggested that he moved to England from Antwerp. Such suggestions rest on his engraved portraits of William Cecil, Robert Dudley, and Elizabeth (all published in Matthew Parker's <span class="italic">Bishops' Bible</span> of 1568) and on his engraving of two views of London. By 1570, however, he is known to have been in Cologne.<br>
<br>Hogenberg is best-known for his close involvement in two of the most important cartographic enterprises of his day. The first was <span class="italic">Theatrum orbis terrarum</span>, compiled by Abraham Ortelius and first printed in Antwerp in 1570. This is considered the first atlas&#151;that is the first collection of maps which aimed uniformly and systematically to depict the world. Its fifty-three maps were engraved by Hogenberg with the assistance of Johannes van Doetecum and later of Ambrosius and Ferdinand Arsenius. Hogenberg may also have engraved the title-page. Ortelius was a friend and travelling companion as well as a collaborator, and he took a keen interest in Hogenberg's later work on the <span class="italic">Civitates orbis terrarum</span>. This latter work was edited by Georg Braun and largely engraved by Hogenberg, being published in six volumes between 1572 and 1617 in Cologne. Hogenberg may indeed have initiated the project, which Braun referred to as &#145;Master Frans's Book of Cities&#146;  (Elliot, 26), and he was certainly responsible for engraving the majority of its 546 prospects, bird's-eye views, and map views of cities throughout the world and for shaping its content&#151;for example by including place names in native tongues rather than Latin alone, to increase the work's popular appeal.<br>
<br>Hogenberg died in Cologne about 1590, and was survived by his two sons.<br>
<br>Remigius Hogenberg is less well known than his brother but had stronger ties to Britain. His first known work is his large view of the city of M&uuml;nster in Westphalia (1570, now in the British Library), after a drawing by Hermann tom Ring, M&uuml;nster's most distinguished sixteenth-century artist. He moved to England and by 1573 was in the service of the archbishop of Canterbury, Matthew Parker, and was living in Lambeth Palace. For Parker, Hogenberg and another artist and engraver, Richard Lyne, constructed genealogies. Hogenberg also engraved portraits. Between 1575 and 1578 he engraved several county maps and the famous title-page showing Elizabeth as patron of geography and astronomy for Christopher Saxton's <span class="italic">Atlas of England and Wales</span> (1579). The last view on which his name appears is the bird's-eye view of Exeter of 1587 (BL, maps C5.a.3), surveyed by John Hooker, chamberlain of the city of Exeter, which was copied by John Speed for his <span class="italic">Theatre of the Empire of Great Britain</span> (1611&#150;12). Hogenberg painted and engraved portraits of several French sitters, and this has led to suggestions that he may have visited that country, but he was probably in England about 1588 when he died, probably unmarried.<br>
