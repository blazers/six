<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stammers,  Katharine Esther <span class="st"> [Kay]</span></span>  (1914&#150;2005), <span class="occ">tennis player</span>, was born on 3 April 1914 at 31 Glenferrie Road, St Albans, Hertfordshire, the only child of Hubert Charles Stammers, insurance clerk, and his wife, Alice Louise, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Curchod. She was educated at St Albans High School for Girls. Stammers learned to play tennis on a grass court at home after her parents moved to Wood Walk, in Sandpit Lane, St Albans. She developed into a talented and attacking left hander, and reached the final of the British junior championships in 1931. She made her Wimbledon d&eacute;but that year, from the qualifying competition, and took four games from Dorothy Round in their first round match. The following year she reached the fourth round at Wimbledon, and won the Surrey hard court championship at Roehampton. By 1934 she had risen to third in the Lawn Tennis Association rankings, and in 1935 she scored a notable victory over Helen Wills Moody in the Kent championships at Beckenham. That year she won the women's doubles at Roland Garros in Paris with Margaret Scriven, and at Wimbledon with Freda James: they enjoyed &#145;a scintillating victory in the final against the formidable combination of [Simone] Mathieu and [Hilde] Sperling&#146;, 6&#150;1 6&#150;4  (Macaulay and Smyth, 107). The following year, 1936, Stammers and James successfully defended their Wimbledon title against Sarah Fabyan and Helen Jacobs, 6&#150;2 6&#150;1.<br>
<br>The Wimbledon doubles victories, coupled with appearances in the American championships and the Wightman cup, made Stammers known on both sides of the Atlantic. She was an exciting and popular player, with an indefinable physical grace, and attracted attention as much for her looks as for her tennis. The Wightman cup was a society event, and the British and American press enjoyed the spectacle offered by the annual exchange of athletic young women between the two countries. One British journalist wrote in 1939: &#145;Our six Wightman Cup girls, who start for America next Wednesday, are good lookers. For shorts, morning costume or evening dress, they will win admiration anywhere&#146;  (<span class="italic">St Louis Post-Dispatch</span>). A New York reporter greeted &#145;Kutey Kay Stammers and Co.&#146; with less restraint: &#145;Gentlemen &hellip; We're not a glamour agent for these British beauties, but we think we ought to let you in on the fact that they're all knockouts&#146; (ibid.). On one visit to America Stammers caught the eye of the young John F. Kennedy and she was his guest at Hyannis Port: she thought him &#145;divine&#146; and a &#145;terrific catch&#146;, but recognized that he could, and would, play the field  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 27 Dec 2005).<br>
<br>Although the Americans won the Wightman cup every year from 1931 to 1939 the British women offered real competition, and none more so than Stammers. In 1935 she won a hard-fought victory over Helen Jacobs, 5&#150;7 6&#150;1 9&#150;7, and in 1938 she defeated the top-ranked American Alice Marble. The pair met again the following year in what is regarded as an era-defining Wimbledon final. Stammers, the British number one, was in top form, but Marble played brilliantly to win 6&#150;2 6&#150;0 in thirty minutes. Stammers &#145;actually hit more winning shots than she conceded errors&#146;, but she could not counter Marble's serve and volley game  (Davidson and Jones, 53). The American did not drop a set in the singles that year and, fittingly, won the triple crown. Her victory foreshadowed the complete American dominance of the post-war era, with its greater emphasis on power and athleticism.<br>
<br>After the outbreak of the Second World War Stammers's tennis was largely confined to charity exhibition matches, in which she had appeared regularly before the war. On 24 January 1940 she married Michael Menzies, an officer in the Welsh Guards, at the parish church of St Peter, Pimlico; the bride &#145;wore a gown of oyster-pink satin, made on close fitting lines&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 Jan 1940). The couple had a daughter and two sons. The first child was born in 1943, but Stammers returned to tennis within a year, and in the first post-war Wimbledon, in 1946, she reached the quarter-final of the singles and the semi-final of the women's doubles, a feat that she repeated in 1947. She also played in the Wightman cup. The British were relatively confident of their 1946 selection, but were whitewashed that year and the next, and Stammers later reflected on dispiriting times:<blockquote>There we were, rather emaciated married women and mothers. The reason why we had to struggle away was because there was nobody in England coming on &hellip; It was hard work. I'm afraid by that time the American girls were very much better than we were. They played a stronger game. (Wade and Rafferty, 79)</blockquote>Peter Ustinov, a tennis aficionado, once named Kay Stammers as his favourite woman player: &#145;So beautiful, so elegant, so delicate, such a fragile English rose. She never won anything, of course, but she always lost so gracefully&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, 3 June 1998). In fact Stammers was tougher and more successful than her looks allowed. She won two Wimbledon titles and one French; defeated both Helens&#151;Wills Moody and Jacobs&#151;and Dorothy Round; and reached the quarter- or the semi-final of the American championships every year between 1934 and 1939. It is a testimony to her fortitude that in August 1939, weeks after losing so heavily to Alice Marble at Wimbledon, she won a &#145;tremendous battle&#146; against the American Dorothy Bundy in a quarter-final encounter in the eastern grass court championships, resurrecting her game at the end of the second set to win 10&#150;8 0&#150;6 8&#150;6  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 Aug 1939). Stammers was fun-loving and enjoyed society, but if she never quite fulfilled her undoubted potential she had to contend with the lack of resources and often inclement weather that afflicted the English game: &#145;we all had Dan Maskell at Wimbledon as our coach, for an hour or two twice a week. Half the time you'd go plodding down there and there'd be frost on the court or it'd be raining. It was quite hard work just getting the practice&#146;  (Wade and Rafferty, 72).<br>
<br>Stammers captained the British team in 1948 and 1949, but by then she was edging towards retirement. In 1951 her husband took up a post with Hill Samuel in Johannesburg, and the family lived there until, in March 1968, Menzies was transferred to New York. The couple divorced in 1974 and the following year Stammers married the American lawyer Thomas Walker Bullitt, whom she had met on the American tennis circuit. They lived at the Bullitt family home at Oxmoor Farm, near Louisville, Kentucky, where Stammers created an English garden, and involved herself in charity work. She continued to live at Oxmoor after her husband's death in 1991, and attended Wimbledon annually until she could no longer travel. She died on 23 December 2005. She was survived by her three children.<br>
