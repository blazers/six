<span class="headword">Gaitskell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Creditor; <em>other married name </em>Frost]</span>,  (Anna) Dora</span>, Baroness Gaitskell  (1901&#150;1989), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 25 April 1901 near Riga in Latvia, then part of imperial Russia, the eldest in the family of four daughters and one son of Leon Creditor, a Hebrew scholar and writer, and his wife, Tessa Jaff&eacute;. Her father emigrated to Britain in 1903 and, when his wife and daughter followed shortly afterwards, they settled in Stepney Green, in the East End of London. Dora Creditor won a scholarship to Coborn High School for Girls, Bow Road. She would have preferred to become a teacher, but was persuaded to study medicine, although she abandoned it when she married on 15 March 1921 Isaac (David) Frost, a lecturer in physiology, the son of Louis Frost, a mechanical engineer. A son, Raymond, was born in 1925, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1937, having continued only because of what she was later to call &#145;the utterly shameful and disgraceful&#146; state of the divorce laws.<br>
<br>Dora Creditor joined the Labour Party at sixteen and became politically active. She met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33309/', "Hugh Todd Naylor Gaitskell (1906&#150;1963)")</script> at the Fitzroy tavern in Soho, then a popular haunt of artists, writers, journalists, dons, and aspiring politicians. Hugh Gaitskell had recently arrived in London to take up a teaching post at University College and was living a Bohemian social life in and around Fitzrovia, a milieu with which Dora Frost was already familiar. Gaitskell, who was five years younger than Dora, soon made her his confidante and, when he went to Vienna in 1933 on the eve of the climax of the counter-revolution against the Viennese socialists, led by Engelbert Dolfuss, she followed him. They lived together until marrying at Hampstead town hall on 9 April 1937.<br>
<br>Dora Gaitskell settled easily into domestic life. Her first child by this marriage, a daughter, Julia, was born in 1939, and a second, Cressida, in 1942. She proved an affectionate and caring mother, creating a family life of a fairly traditional kind. She was confident in her husband's love and ultimate loyalty and, in turn, became a devoted wife, a tigress in defending him from his political enemies, and committed and affectionate towards his friends.<br>
<br>Having been elected as MP for Leeds South East in 1945, Hugh Gaitskell was chosen as leader of the Labour Party ten years later. This was a stormy period in Labour's history, and Gaitskell was frequently the object of bitter personal attacks. His wife was fierce in her defence of her husband and was thought, even by some of his friends, to exacerbate rather than soften his more extreme sentiments. During his lifetime, her political views were not easily distinguishable from his, but after his death she supported the &#145;yes&#146; campaign in the European referendum of 1975, despite her husband's earlier opposition to Britain's membership of the EEC. But she did not break with the Labour Party when, in 1981, most of the remaining Gaitskellites left to form the Social Democratic Party.<br>
<br>By that time Dora Gaitskell had enjoyed a substantial career of her own. Shortly after her husband's death, she was made a life peer in 1963, on the recommendation of the prime minister, Harold Macmillan. When Harold Wilson became prime minister in 1964, he arranged for her to become a member of the UK delegation to the general assembly of the United Nations. She became an outspoken champion of human rights, critical of the double standards of some Afro-Asian nations, but strong in her advocacy of the needs of the third world. She caused some anxiety in Foreign Office circles through her firm commitment to the state of Israel&#151;but she was not an unthinking Zionist and was critical of the policies of right-wing Likud governments.<br>
<br>Dora Gaitskell was active in the House of Lords, and never afraid of controversy or of crossing swords. Plump of figure, a redhead in her earlier years, and only a little over 5 feet tall, she was spirited in her advocacy of libertarian causes and as direct as ever in personal relationships. At the time of her husband's death, on 18 January 1963, Dora Gaitskell had every reason to believe that she would shortly accompany him to No. 10 Downing Street. It would be easy to see the remaining quarter century of her life as a pianissimo coda to the excitement and expectations of those earlier years. Yet, while continuing to grieve for her lost husband, she established herself as a public figure in her own right and contributed bravely to causes which were both his and her own. She died on 1 July 1989 at her home, 18 Frognal Gardens, Hampstead, London.<br>
