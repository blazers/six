<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Makins,  Roger Mellor</span>, first Baron Sherfield  (1904&#150;1996), <span class="occ">diplomatist and public servant</span>, was born on 3 February 1904 at 15 Orsett Terrace, London, the oldest of three sons of Brigadier-General Sir Ernest Makins (1869&#150;1959), army officer and Conservative MP for Knutsford from 1922 to 1945, and his wife, Maria Florence (<i>d</i>. 1972), third of four daughters of Sir James Robert Mellor (1839&#150;1926) of Eastgate, Tenterden, Kent, master of the crown office and registrar of the court of criminal appeal. His mother was an accomplished violinist from a dynasty of Liverpudlian lawyers. The elder of his two brothers, Guy Henry (<i>b</i>. 1906), died following an accident in 1923; the younger, Geoffrey Ernest (<i>b</i>. 1915), was killed in action in Normandy in 1944.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlylife"></a>Education and early life</h2>After being farmed out to a series of governesses and sergeant-majors by his itinerant parents&#151;his father was at this time a regular officer in the Royal Dragoons&#151;Makins enjoyed a short reign at West Downs, Winchester (1914&#150;17), and then a slightly less glorious one at Winchester College itself (1917&#150;22). From there, as expected, he went up to Oxford&#151;not the way of the true Wykehamist, to New College, but to clubbable Christ Church, to read modern history, which he did, fiercely, during the vacations, there being too many distractions of the hunting, shooting, and socializing variety during the terms. The system worked: he was awarded a congratulatory first (1925). His entire career, one might say, was a congratulatory first. That same year he was elected a prize fellow of All Souls, together with his tutorial partner, A. L. Rowse, historian and amateur of cats and cattiness. At twenty-one, Makins said that he had never known such perfect satisfaction. A lifetime later it was reprised. At eighty-two, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society (1986), a signal honour for a non-scientist.<br>
<br>Between elections Makins had a reputation to make. His fellowship prescribed two years in college. He devoted the time to reading for the bar. No sooner was he called than he decided it was not the career for him, and reverted to his original idea of trying for the Foreign Office, his contact with the law and the legal profession &#145;as brief as it was briefless&#146;  (unpublished memoirs). He sat the examinations in 1928. Inevitably, perhaps, he passed first, notwithstanding a certain lack of fluency in French. (Behind him was John Cairncross, later &#145;the fifth man&#146; among the Cambridge spies.) As top of the list, he had the choice of joining the office without further language study, or taking up a really difficult one like Russian or Chinese. Without hesitation he chose the first option. He was assigned to the American department as a probationary third secretary, in October 1928, and in time-honoured fashion was told to look after Latin America.<h2>
<a name="AngloAmericanrelations"></a>Anglo-American relations</h2>So began a career of leaps and bounds in the service of his country. Soon Makins was posted across the Atlantic. There he found his second home. He served in Washington as third secretary from April 1931 to May 1934 (being promoted second secretary in October 1933), as minister from January 1945 to February 1947, and finally as ambassador from December 1952 to October 1956. He was also in Oslo, from May to September 1934; at the Foreign Office, being promoted first secretary in September 1939 and counsellor in August 1940; on the staff of the minister resident in west Africa, from July to December 1942; as assistant to the minister resident at allied forces headquarters, Mediterranean command, from January 1943 to September 1944; and again at the Foreign Office, as assistant and then from April 1948 deputy under-secretary of state. His recurrence in Washington sealed his influence and oriented his ambition; for it was there that he met and, on 30 April 1934, married his partner in life, Alice Brooks Davis (1908&#150;1985), eldest of the three daughters of the Hon. Dwight Filey Davis, governor-general of the Federal Reserve Bank and of the Philippines, secretary for war in President Coolidge's administration, and donor of the Davis cup. It was a fortunate partnership. They were well matched, in temperament as in tennis (in golf she had the better of him). Thirty years later, in 1964, Makins (having been made CMG in 1944, KCMG in 1949, KCB in 1953, GCMG in 1955, and GCB in 1960) was made a hereditary peer. The question of a title arose. His account is characteristic, and quietly eloquent of this particular special relationship:<blockquote>For some reason which I could not well explain&#151;perhaps euphony&#151;I did not like the sound of Lord Makins, and rationalized it by pointing out that there were too many Lady Makins &hellip; It would avoid confusion if I were to take a territorial title. Sherfield was a good old English place name to which I had a better claim than anyone else. For some reason equally difficult to explain, Alice was against a change of name. She said she had changed her name twice and did not want to do it again. But I think it was an expression of her American origins and she had an unconscious prejudice against titles and indeed the idea of an hereditary aristocracy. She was always critical of pretensions of any kind, and one of the things I am most grateful for is that as I climbed the ladder she never let me get above myself. Anyway, we had quite a sharp argument about it &hellip; Alice often returned to this grievance. She claimed that I would be confused with Lord Sheffield, which was true up to a point &hellip; She also claimed that nobody would know who Lord Sherfield was&#151;I replied that all the people who mattered to us would know, and that I intended to establish the identity of Lord Sherfield as clearly as that of Sir Roger Makins. (We both had a point there.) (unpublished note)</blockquote>They made up by choosing the supporters for his coat of arms: a British lion differenced with an atomic symbol on one side, and&#151;to Alice's delight&#151;an American bald eagle differenced with a tennis racket on the other.<br>
<br>There was a history to the atomic symbol, and a sobriquet Makins did not care for: Mr Atom. As minister in the Washington embassy, given free rein by the enervative Ambassador Inverchapel, it fell to Makins to represent British interests in the precarious Anglo-American atomic diplomacy of the post-Hiroshima period. His task was to secure Britain's position, if not by fully-fledged collaboration on the wartime model, then by mutual consultation and appropriate allocation of the vital ingredient, uranium: a tall order. By 1947 the situation was difficult verging on desperate. In 1943 Churchill and Roosevelt had signed an agreement not to use the bomb against third parties without each other's consent (ostensibly an absolute veto), and in 1944 an <i>aide-m&eacute;moire</i> on full collaboration for both military and commercial purposes after the war. But the fairytale promise of these arrangements never materialized. The perfunctory way in which British consent was requested for the dropping of the bomb in 1945 spoke of the letter rather than the spirit of the original agreement. The passage through the US congress of the notorious <span class="roman">McMahon Act</span> in 1946 formally severed the main arteries of atomic information exchange, the vital source of any genuine consultation. After Hiroshima, the constitutional authority of the president and commander-in-chief would not be compromised by written commitments to allies, however special the relationship. Furthermore, the British were clearly (and rightly) worried about the &#145;coupling&#146; of this issue to the delicate matter of economic assistance from the Americans, and indeed to Anglo-American relations as a whole.<br>
<br>On the other hand Britain was not entirely without cards to play. Apart from her own geostrategic position&#151;Orwell's Airstrip One&#151;there was the submerged issue of access to resources of various kinds, animal and mineral. A much-increased supply of uranium was indispensable to the expansionary US atomic weapons project. Both London and Washington fancied that the key to this supply was held by the British. Certain British scientists were held to be almost irreplaceable in the United States. At the first US post-war bomb test at Bikini in the Pacific, Ernest Titterton, instrumentation group leader at Los Alamos as late as 1947, gave the countdown and detonation order; and William Penney, whose presence had been specially requested for the purpose, played a leading part in the blast measurement and subsequent analysis. Penney remained <i>persona gratissima</i> in Washington throughout the period, as did the unassuming Nobel laureate James Chadwick. It was not all jam and kippers, as Chadwick once remarked, but it was not negligible.<br>
<br>None the less, in 1948, after much transatlantic tergiversation, the so-called <i>modus vivendi</i> summarily removed the requirement for consent, made no offer to consult, and restored only limited technical atomic information exchange in return. These were the American terms. The free flow of information would take another ten years: a long sentence, and long-deferred gratification for Mr Atom. The <i>modus vivendi</i>, however, was a difficult child. Makins's handling of the negotiations has been variously assessed. No one doubts their exacting nature; but a number of authorities, including the magisterial Margaret Gowing, have suggested that Britain could have done better. Makins himself thought otherwise, resolutely maintaining to his dying day that it was &#145;the best agreement that could have been secured at the time&#146;  (unpublished memoirs)&#151;a defensive construction, and in the final analysis perhaps an insufficiently searching one.<h2>
<a name="Mandarin"></a>Mandarin</h2>At the time, there was no thought of reproof or reproach. Makins had returned to London in an almost impregnable position at the heart of the machine, as assistant and soon deputy under-secretary at the Foreign Office, roaming freely through the jungle of economic and atomic policy making&#151;the critical and the sub-critical, as one might say. This was a daunting brief. It did not daunt Makins. &#145;He radiated humour, energy and good sense. Bounding from one meeting to the other, he seemed to us in the Office to be plural rather than singular&#146;  (A. M. Browne, quoted in Carrington, memorial service address). Cast as the poor relation with ideas above her station&#151;&#145;chief mendicant&#146;, in R. W. B. Clarke's biting phrase  (Kelly, 114)&#151;Britain had frustratingly little room for manoeuvre. Steering the policy of the poor relation was the redoubtable Ernest Bevin. Whispering loudly in his ear was Roger Makins. In every sense, the whisper carried. Makins was one of the select few: a well-honed and for the most part well-heeled band of brothers who caballed behind the throne in the national interest. Another was the Treasury official Robert Hall. An extract from his diary of 1949 reveals, as Makins himself justly noted, &#145;the extent and confidence with which we officials were able in this period to influence and indeed manage appointments and policy&#146;:<blockquote>OSF [Franks], RM [Makins], EP [Edwin Plowden] and I had some chat about bodies and whether to move Hall-Patch from Paris. I should be sorry if this had to be done, but it is very bad that he does not get on with Harriman. We have decided that the next steps at home are to cut expenditure and wake up people on the Board of Trade doing the dollar export work. Everyone on the UK talks in Washington agreed that Holmes was a disaster and ought to be shifted, and also everyone except the Ministers that Harold Wilson is no good, ought if possible to be shifted from the Board of Trade, and certainly ought not to succeed Stafford Cripps [as chancellor of the exchequer]. If any young one is to do it it should be Gaitskell!! (unpublished memoirs)</blockquote>Roger Makins was at the centre of that web of influence. There can be little doubt that he did much to keep the ship of state afloat during those years of economic reconstruction and diplomatic prestidigitation. Bevin was a heroic figure&#151;not least to his own officials&#151;but as illness and exhaustion took hold he, like Macmillan, became increasingly reliant on the rigorous Roger Makins, whose prudent counsel seemed so difficult to ignore. &#145;Dominant, but not domineering&#146;, in Jeremy Morse's felicitous apposition (memorial service address), Makins was a hard man to gainsay.<br>
<br>This prudence manifested itself in Makins's assessment of personalities and eventualities alike. On the making of Macmillan during the war: &#145;On his record to date, nobody suspected that [he] had the remarkable diplomatic talents, the political vision and judgement, the powers of persuasion, and the courage to disregard instructions, which he displayed in north Africa, in Italy and in Greece&#146;  (unpublished memoirs). On John Foster Dulles as secretary of state:<blockquote>My main problem was that he travelled a great deal and I never quite knew what had passed in his dealings with Anthony Eden, Selwyn Lloyd and others &hellip; Reports were sent, of course, but it is only if one is actually on the spot that it is possible to know what nods or winks have been exchanged. (ibid.)</blockquote>Less happily, on diplomatic golf:<blockquote>I played from time to time with the Vice-President, Richard Nixon &hellip; I had always been a very bad golfer (indeed, I had given up the game, as I thought, for good). Dick Nixon was equally bad. We formed a bond of misery, and a friendship developed which endured until he was driven from the White House. (ibid.)</blockquote>&#145;Driven&#146; may give pause to those brought up on dirty tricks and deleted expletives. Makins lived very much in the here and now, but he was in certain respects an official of the old school. Good order matched good work. Security outbid futurity. The purposive crowded the imaginative. &#145;He was above all a solver of problems&#146;  (Carrington, memorial service address). Expatiating on the difference between a &#145;realistic&#146; and a &#145;romantic&#146; view of the world&#151;the prospects for a European Community, for example&#151;there was no mistaking his own affiliation. The realism of the realists was another matter. In 1950 Makins adamantly opposed British participation in the Schuman plan for the first European Community, a coal and steel pool, arguing that &#145;it let the Americans off the hook&#146;&#151;the hook of continuing engagement in Europe. &#145;We are not ready&#146;, he informed Etienne Hirsch, &#145;and you will not succeed&#146;  (Charlton, 93, 122, 151): the historic misjudgement of a generation of British policy makers.<h2>
<a name="Suezandafter"></a>Suez and after</h2>Deceived by his own masters over Suez in 1956&#151;ambassadors were neither consulted nor informed&#151;on his return to London Makins was astonished to learn at the eleventh hour of the Anglo-French collusion. &#145;It had never occurred to me the British government would consider taking such action without full American support. I realised immediately that there would be a disaster and I began mentally to prepare myself for it&#146;  (unpublished memoirs). It was a characteristic response. The operation was impracticable. The collusion was deplorable, no doubt, but that was a secondary issue. What mattered was to anticipate the consequences. Remediation, not resignation, was uppermost in his mind. When Anthony Nutting and Edward Boyle resigned, at a moment of high anxiety for the government, Makins said to Boyle, &#145;privately, I do not blame you; you realise what has happened&#146;, and returned to the planning of emergency measures by the Treasury. Privately, also, he gave himself partial credit for the belated &#145;unblinkering&#146; of the hawkish Harold Macmillan  (unpublished memoirs). As Jeremy Morse acutely observed, &#145;his mind and style were marked by consistency and immediacy&#146;  (memorial address). And potency.<br>
<br>After a rather frustrating interlude as joint permanent secretary of the Treasury from 1956 to 1959, alongside Sir Norman Brook&#151;appointed by Macmillan but abandoned to the vagaries of Selwyn Lloyd and the hostilities of the mandarinate&#151;Makins concluded his official service as chairman of the UK Atomic Energy Authority (1960&#150;64), in which post his diplomatic skills were frequently (and successfully) called upon to resolve clashes of personality and of interest within the nuclear industry. He was unready for retirement. In afterlife, as he said, he revelled in a variety of activities in the City, chairing everything from Hill, Samuel (1966&#150;70) to Wells Fargo (1972&#150;84), and in the service of what might be called the public awareness of science and technology, culminating in a notable stint as chairman of the House of Lords select committee on science and technology (1984&#150;7)&#151;a body, and an idea, whose very existence owed much to his inspiration. Makins was the very model of the inquisitive octogenarian.<h2>
<a name="Characterandassessment"></a>Character and assessment</h2>Like his contemporary Oliver Franks, with whom he was, as he remarked, &#145;very much on the same wavelength&#146;  (unpublished memoirs), Makins cast a long and impressive shadow in the committees of influence off the corridors of power. If the public pinnacle of his career was as ambassador in Washington, in truth he was a prime mover in the inner circles of the Anglo-Saxons throughout the momentous middle decades of the twentieth century. But it was not only the length and breadth of his career: the pace of his life was breathtaking. Makins was congenitally formidable. The <span class="italic">New York Times</span> described him as looking like an affable hawk. Colleagues in the Foreign Office plumped for an amiable vulture. More prejudicial accounts move from the avian to the simian. Six feet four inches tall, with a frame and a voice and a zest to match, Makins was an imposing presence. His attack left the lesser primates awestruck and overwhelmed. In wartime Algiers, Harold Macmillan wondered whether he could live up to the standards set by his architectonic assistant:<blockquote>It is naturally a great loss&#151;even a great grief&#151;to lose Roger. He has been a most loyal supporter in all my difficulties and a most agreeable companion and friend. I think it is tribute to both of us that we have lived together for nearly two years like subalterns in a company mess without quarelling (and Roger's temperament is more highly strung than mine). The inspiring thing about him is his standard of work. He is <i>never</i> satisfied with the second best. And this goes through the office and inspires the others.<br>
<br>[His successor] will, I think, be agreeable and efficient. But he has not that rapier-like brain combined with that almost monastic devotion to duty which makes Roger such a unique figure in the public service. (diary, 29 Sept 1944, in H. Macmillan, <span class="italic">The Blast of War</span>, 1967, 552&#150;3)</blockquote>Devotion to duty did not preclude a voracious sociability. (&#145;The Makins of a good party&#146; was an old joke on the diplomatic cocktail circuit. And, in a crowded room, &#145;Meet you at the British Ambassador.&#146;) Makins relished the pleasure of encounter. His charm too was formidable. Unlike Franks, he enjoyed talking, but above all he enjoyed dancing. As a ballroom dancer he was a sensation. In the 1950s he waltzed staid Washington off its feet. Forty years later he was still at it, foxtrotting and quickstepping with the best of them, into the early hours, delighted, at his ninetieth birthday ball. The secret of successful diplomacy, he maintained, was stamina. Stamina was Makins's middle name. Sir Edward Bridges, a paragon public servant, once headed both the Treasury and the civil service. He was asked how he managed it. &#145;I don't,&#146; Bridges replied. &#145;I just catch one ball in four&#146;  (Hennessy, 144). Makins did better than that. In the arena he was a prodigious all-rounder. In reflection, he might have conceded something to a Monnet or a Spaak or even a Franks. In action, turbocharged action, he had the measure of them all.<br>
<br>Makins died at the age of ninety-two, at the Hampshire Clinic, Basing Road, Basingstoke, Hampshire, on 9 November 1996, of cancer and heart failure. His wife having predeceased him in 1985, he was survived by the six children of their marriage: twins Mary (Mollie) and Cynthia (<i>b</i>. 1935), Virginia (<i>b</i>. 1939), Christopher (<i>b</i>. 1942), Patricia (<i>b</i>. 1946), and Dwight (<i>b</i>. 1951). Christopher&#151;like his father a prize fellow of All Souls college&#151;succeeded him as second Baron Sherfield. A memorial service was held at All Souls on 1 March 1997, and another at St Margaret by Westminster Abbey, on 6 March.<br>
