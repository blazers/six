</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Schlesinger,  John Richard</span>  (1926&#150;2003), <span class="occ">film and stage director</span>, was born on 16 February 1926 at 53 Hollycroft Avenue, Hampstead, London, the son of Bernard Edward Schlesinger (1896&#150;1984), paediatrician, and his wife, Winifred Henrietta, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Regensburg (1897&#150;1986), who had studied music at Trinity College of Music and languages at Oxford. His parents had German-Jewish family backgrounds, and though their Jewishness was never repudiated it was overshadowed in his father's case at least by &#145;an embrace of his Englishness&#146;  (Mann, 52). The Jewish heritage nevertheless remained an influence in John Schlesinger's artistic development. He recalled a normal, middle-class childhood in Hampstead (he grew up at 15 Templewood Avenue), though he was not happy at the boarding-schools to which he was sent: St Edmund's, a preparatory school in Hindhead, Surrey, and Uppingham School. During school holidays he would rope in family members to perform plays of his own devising. Having no gift for games (unlike his father) he felt himself an outsider at Uppingham, and many of his best films featured protagonists at odds with their society. His homosexuality, which he did not acknowledge publicly until the 1990s, was another key influence on the sort of artist he became.<br>
<br>On leaving Uppingham, Schlesinger made a ten-minute film called, starkly, <span class="italic">Horror</span> (1946), shot on 16 mm; but before he could pursue his film-making intentions (a goal displacing the earlier one of architecture) he was conscripted into the army to do his national service with the Royal Engineers. He predictably detested the army, but life improved when he transferred to the combined services entertainment unit, and &#145;he started entertaining troops with a magic act&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). This, and drag shows performed with a fellow conscript, Kenneth Williams, gave him his first serious whiff of show business. Having completed his national service, he read English at Balliol College, Oxford (1947&#150;50), where he seems to have spent most of his time as an actor, scoring a success as Trinculo in Nevill Coghill's production of <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>. At Oxford he also made two films with Alan Cooke, <span class="italic">Black Legend</span> (1948) and <span class="italic">The Starfish</span> (1950), the former &#145;financed by his doting grandparents&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span>). <span class="italic">Black Legend</span> was praised by the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> reviewer Dilys Powell, but Michael Balcon, head of Ealing Studios, allegedly dismissed it as &#145;amateur&#146;&#151;which of course it was, as was <span class="italic">The Starfish</span>, for which, nevertheless, Schlesinger and Cooke managed to engage the well-known Welsh actor Kenneth Griffith.<br>
<br>These early films, in their liking for horror and fantasy, pointed to Schlesinger's later sorties into genre film-making; the realist elements in his work, particularly in the films that made his name, more likely derived from his years as a television film-maker, on the highly regarded current affairs programmes <span class="italic">Tonight</span> and <span class="italic">Monitor</span>, first screened in 1957 and 1958 respectively. In addition, during the 1950s he acted in films, including two for the Boulting brothers (<span class="italic">Single-Handed</span>, 1952; and <span class="italic">Brothers in Law</span>, 1956), and episodes of the television series <span class="italic">Robin Hood</span> (1956), directed by his Oxford contemporary Lindsay Anderson, and <span class="italic">Ivanhoe</span> (1958). He also acted in sixteen plays between 1950 and 1955, first for the Oxford Players, later for Colchester and Nottingham repertory companies, for the British Commonwealth Theatre Company, and on tour with the Wilson Barrett Company. Years later he disparaged his acting ability, claiming he would never have hired himself as an actor. Nevertheless he became a very notable director of actors, many of whom attested to his sympathetic understanding. Moreover, his wide-ranging activities in the 1950s prefigured a film-maker who, unlike many of his peers, went on to be very prolific. He loved to work and was not prepared simply to wait for the perfect project to drop into his lap.<br>
<br>Television was undoubtedly Schlesinger's great training ground, as it was for many British directors. He made twenty-six films for the BBC, &#145;all reflecting his curiosity about people&#146;  (Hacker and Price, 384). <span class="italic">Tonight</span> was a light-hearted, weeknightly programme based on, and exploring further, items currently in the news. Schlesinger directed six of these, the first of which required him to create the flavour of London's Petticoat Lane market. This, and a later one, &#145;Song of the Valley&#146;, a narrative based on a song (made popular by Dorothy Squires) about a prisoner returning to his Yorkshire home, hinted at the kinds of films he would make in his features career. <span class="italic">Monitor</span>, produced by Huw Wheldon, offered him greater creative freedom. Schlesinger's film &#145;Circus&#146; (1958) introduced the series, and he did some very distinguished work there, including &#145;Benjamin Britten at Aldeburgh&#146; (1959) and &#145;The Italian Opera&#146; (1960), the latter featuring a barn-storming Italian opera company that came to Drury Lane.<br>
<br>In his television films Schlesinger had shown himself an acute observer of human behaviour, aware of human frailty and the needs for compromise, and he had learnt too a capacity to render narrative in cinematic terms. What clinched his reputation was <span class="italic">Terminus</span> (1960), a half-hour film he made for British Transport Films, under the producer-in-charge, Edgar Anstey. In this he combined narrative (a little boy lost and weeping) with documentary-style observation of a &#145;day in the life of&#146; Waterloo Station. A near-perfect melding of the real and the invented, it was particularly notable for its sympathetically observant portrayal of ordinary people, some of them caught in bewildering circumstances. On the basis of <span class="italic">Terminus</span> the producer Joseph Janni told Schlesinger, &#145;I'd like to discover you&#146;  (McFarlane, <span class="italic">British Cinema</span>, 510), thus beginning a very fruitful working relationship that accounted for six of Schlesinger's best films.<br>
<br>Between 1958 and 1963 Britain produced a batch of films which came to be bracketed by the term &#145;new wave&#146;, a British riposte to the French <i>nouvelle vague</i>. In Britain its roots were in the poetic documentaries of the Free Cinema programmes at the National Film Theatre, in the Royal Court Theatre in the period ushered in by <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span> (1956), and in the provincially set novels of John Braine, Kingsley Amis, and others. These manifestations of a new spirit at work in British culture drew praise for their explorations of kinds of life not usually depicted in the arts and especially not in the British cinema of the earlier 1950s, which was an essentially middle-class affair. Lindsay Anderson, Tony Richardson, and Karel Reisz, all Free Cinema alumni, made their feature d&eacute;buts at this time, as did Jack Clayton with the seminal <span class="italic">Room at the Top</span> (1959). Schlesinger contributed <span class="italic">A Kind of Loving</span> (1962). He always felt an outsider with the Free Cinema group and bridled at Anderson's telling him, &#145;You've got to set your sights higher than television&#146;. Schlesinger recalled, &#145;I felt resented, frankly&#146;  (McFarlane, <span class="italic">British Cinema</span>, 511). Nevertheless, <span class="italic">A Kind of Loving</span> still seems very much a part of that short-lived realist, working-class, northern-set renaissance&#151;and, if it seems less politically slanted in class matters than some of the others, it remains an affectingly humane document. Alan Bates, with whom Schlesinger enjoyed a long working relationship and friendship, plays a young man who gets himself trapped into marriage with a vacuous young woman. Both he and the girl are treated with sympathy for their plight and for the way they knuckle down to find &#145;a kind of loving&#146;. The film was characterized by superb acting, astute observation of its everyday setting, and a tonal command which steered clear of sentimentality, settling for astringent, heartfelt truth instead.<br>
<br>Schlesinger's other &#145;new wave&#146; film, <span class="italic">Billy Liar</span> (1963), was less commercially popular but was in some ways more adventurous, combining realist observation of the grim northern town in which the mendacious eponym is entrapped with flights of fancy in which he imagines a more glamorous existence. It is a wry, witty film, now vividly remembered for how it &#145;made a star of Julie Christie, whose entrance down a drab northern street is one of the most potent film moments of the decade&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). Like Bates, Christie became a Schlesinger regular and in his next film she became an international star. This was <span class="italic">Darling</span> (1965), which won three Oscars&#151;awarded to Christie as best actress, Frederic Raphael for his original screenplay, and Julie Harris for costume design. In spite of Schlesinger's own later distaste for it, <span class="italic">Darling</span> remains a film immensely evocative of its period and of a throwaway hedonistic culture. To eschew the contemporary, Schlesinger and Janni next turned to Thomas Hardy's <span class="italic">Far from the Madding Crowd</span> (1967), which co-starred Bates and Christie and brought Peter Finch into Schlesinger's orbit. The film failed to find much favour, but was stunningly location-shot by Nicolas Roeg, had sumptuous production design from Richard MacDonald, featured a highly effective starring quartet (Terence Stamp was the fourth), and provided Schlesinger with a calling card for Hollywood.<br>
<br>Schlesinger scored a major critical and commercial success with his first American film, <span class="italic">Midnight Cowboy</span> (1969), winning Academy awards for best film, best director, and best adapted screenplay. The film deals with the experiences of a midwestern boy who comes to New York expecting a lucrative career as a hustler, but finds friendship with a dying down-and-out instead. Schlesinger was aware &#145;that there are very delicate areas in the film&#146; but ran into &#145;no censorship problems, although there were individuals who disliked some sections of it&#146;  (&#145;A buck for Joe&#146;, <span class="italic">Films &amp; Filming</span>, Nov 1969). He was no doubt referring to a scene of homosexual activity followed by some alarming violence, but the film's real strength was in the growth of the feeling between the characters played with such empathy by Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight, and the vicious, vivid city they struggled to survive in. While in America, Schlesinger entered a stable relationship with the photographer Michael Donald Childers, which endured until Schlesinger's death.<br>
<br>Schlesinger's capacity to render complex feelings between ill-assorted people was also the central strength of his next film, <span class="italic">Sunday Bloody Sunday</span> (1971), for which he returned to England and which reunited him with Janni and Peter Finch. Finch, with remarkably shrewd sympathy, played a homosexual Jewish doctor, in love with an attractive young man (Murray Head) who is having a concurrent affair with an employment counsellor (Glenda Jackson). All three know about each other and the film with painful honesty settles for the notion of compromise in human relations. It was probably Schlesinger's finest film, of which he said &#145;It's a film I wanted to make and the opportunity was there to do it&#146;  (Gow, 13), and &#145;It's the most personal of all my films&#146;  (McFarlane, <span class="italic">British Cinema</span>, 513). <span class="italic">Sunday Bloody Sunday</span> was his last wholly successful cinema film, winning BAFTA awards for Schlesinger, Finch, and Jackson, and also an award as best film.<br>
<br>Most of Schlesinger's subsequent cinema work was American and of little lasting significance, though <span class="italic">Marathon Man</span> (1976), with Hoffman and Laurence Olivier, was an accomplished thriller, as was <span class="italic">Pacific Heights</span> (1990), with an alarming Michael Keaton; while <span class="italic">The Falcon and the Snowman</span> (1985) has some interest as a study of contrasting motivations among spies. In Britain <span class="italic">Yanks</span> (1978) perceptively dramatized the effects on a northern English town of American servicemen billeted there during the Second World War, though its forte was verisimilitude rather than perspective; and <span class="italic">Madame Sousatzka</span> (1988) overdid the eccentricity in its tale of a piano teacher and her star pupil. The American films included failures such as <span class="italic">The Day of the Locust</span> (1974), an overblown version of Nathanael West's scathing satire on Hollywood, and <span class="italic">Honky Tonk Freeway</span> (1981), a disastrously unfunny farce. The latter was savaged by critics and ignored by audiences, and Schlesinger did not film again for four years, except&#151;and it is a major exception&#151;on television. In 1983 he directed Alan Bates (as Guy Burgess) and Coral Browne (as herself twenty-five years earlier) in <span class="italic">An Englishman Abroad</span>. From a witty and touching screenplay by Alan Bennett, Schlesinger explored the Moscow meeting of the exiled spy and the actress on tour there with <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>. It became a classic of the small screen.<br>
<br>All Schlesinger's best subsequent work was for television, including <span class="italic">A Question of Attribution</span> (1992), in which another (former) spy, Anthony Blunt, discusses the provenance of a Titian with the queen (Prunella Scales), and a charming and funny version of Stella Gibbons's <span class="italic">Cold Comfort Farm</span> (1995). He also kept himself busy with theatre&#151;directing John Gielgud in <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span> (1977) and Placido Domingo in <span class="italic">Un Ballo in Maschera</span> (1990), among others&#151;and numerous television commercials. In 1991 he was hired to make a brief campaign film for the prime minister, John Major; though not strongly political, he admired Major, and perhaps impishly was tilting at his left-wing friends.<br>
<br>Schlesinger's was an erratic career, sprawling over theatre, opera, and television as well as, pre-eminently, screen, and including low points when he was out of favour with both public and critics. However, his best work, of which there was a good deal, was distinguished by its humanity and the honesty of its perceptions&#151;as was the man himself. He was made CBE in 1970 and a fellow of BAFTA in 1995; among his other awards was one for outstanding achievement in directing from the Hollywood film festival in 1999. He suffered a stroke in late 2001, from which he never fully recovered, and died on 25 July 2003 in Palm Springs, California. He was cremated and his ashes were interred at the Liberal Jewish Synagogue cemetery in London.<br>
