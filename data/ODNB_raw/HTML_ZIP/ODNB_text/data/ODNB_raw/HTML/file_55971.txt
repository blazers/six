<span class="headword">Wallace,  Nellie</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Eleanor Jane Wallace; <em>married name </em>Eleanor Jane Liddy]</span>  (1870&#150;1948), <span class="occ">music-hall entertainer</span>, was born in Glasgow on 18 March 1870 to parents who both worked in the music-hall: her father gave &#145;lectures&#146;, and her mother played the piano. By the age of twelve she had made her own d&eacute;but as a clog dancer at the Steam Clock Music-Hall, Birmingham, and she subsequently worked solo as La Petite Nellie, and as one of the Three Sisters Wallace in pantomime and in music-hall. About 1892 she married actor and manager William J. Liddy and attempted to establish a career in the legitimate theatre for herself; she found, however, that as the doomed Little Willie in Alfred Kempe's version of <span class="italic">East Lynne</span> she tended to elicit laughter rather than tears, and she liked to claim that she abandoned her acting career after being sneezed off her horse while playing Joan of Arc. In 1894 Nellie Wallace returned to pantomime as second girl and understudy to the star, Ada Reeve, in <span class="italic">Jack and Jill</span> at the Comedy Theatre, Manchester, where the cast included the young George Robey. On 9 March 1895 Reeve left the show to have a child, and Wallace took over as principal girl. Her music-hall career blossomed, and her appearance at the London Palladium in 1910 confirmed the success of the image she had established, as the &#145;essence of eccentricity&#146;. While there were other performers who adopted the old-maid persona expressed in songs such as &#145;Blasted Oak&#146; and &#145;I've been jilted by the baker, Mister White&#146;, Wallace gave it a new dimension. Along with &#145;the wife's mother&#146;, the old maid was a staple topic for jokes that represented woman as a threat while continuing to endorse a conservative ideology of the family. Wallace, however, completely eschewed the predatory aspect of the persona: when she narrated her search for a man (&#145;Crossed in love?&#146;, asked her stooge. &#145;No&#146;, she replied, &#145;I've been run over&#146;), the effect was of a vitality so powerful that she would wear out an ordinary man in a couple of hours. At the same time she exempted members of the audience from her search. Rather than potential mates they became members of her own family, listening to the confidences of a much-loved spinster aunt, at a time when aunts were a vital part of the family unit, contributing both earnings and caring skills in households struggling to cope with recession and often deprived by war of their main breadwinners.<br>
<br>Wallace's stage spinsterhood liberated her into anarchy, what <span class="italic">The Times</span> called her &#145;saving touch of the devil&#146;  (25 Nov 1948). The true focus of her act was her enjoyment of her power as a performer. One of her songs had a chorus that ran &#145;It's excitement, all excitement&#151;if you're after anything tasty, what price me?&#146; As Wilson Disher commented, &#145;Just to be let loose on the stage gives her so much joy that she performs an <i>entrechat</i> in each corner&#146;  (Green, 287). She had a weird beauty, a face of aquiline elegance, marred only by buck teeth, which she transformed into a clownish mask with elaborately arched black brows. Her clothes were a parody of middle-class respectability, with elastic-sided boots, a sensible tartan skirt (that occasionally revealed enormous red flannel bloomers), and a moth-eaten fur tippet (&#145;my little bit of vermin&#146;). She sometimes varied it with an evening dress of impossible extravagance, its skirt so tight that her efforts to pick up a dropped fan involved outrageous contortions. Her songs were charged with energy, erupting into high-spirited yodelling and arguments with the orchestra; her sketches tipped the balance from the merely eccentric to the surreal: in one, which captivated the young Alec Guinness, she deconstructed one of the archetypal images of spinsterhood, the nurse assisting the noble (male) doctor:<blockquote>Nellie stood by looking very prim, but every now and then she would dive under the sheet and extract with glee and a shout of triumph quite impossible articles&#151;a hot water bottle, a live chicken &hellip; Finally she inserted, with many wicked looks, a long rubber tube which she blew down. The body inflated rapidly to huge proportions and then, covered in its sheet, took slowly to the air. (Guinness, 10)</blockquote>With the decline of variety Wallace took to revue, notably in Albert de Courulles' <span class="italic">Whirl of the World</span>, which ran for 627 performances at the London Palladium in 1924, and in George Black's &#145;crazy&#146; shows between 1931 and 1934. She was also associated with the comedian with whom she shared her pantomime d&eacute;but, George Robey: one of the few female pantomime dames, she replaced him as Dame Trot at the London Hippodrome in 1922, and in March 1925 she opened with him in the London Palladium revue <span class="italic">Sky High</span>, which ran for 309 performances.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Wallace toured with the Entertainments National Service Association, her surreal humour in tune with the popular radio comedies of the day. In February 1948 she began touring with Don Ross's company in <span class="italic">Thanks for the Memory</span>. The cast were invited to appear at that year's royal variety performance at the London Palladium on 1 November. Wallace sang &#145;A Boy's Best Friend is his Mother&#146;, and then collapsed. She rallied to finish the show, but was admitted to hospital and died three weeks later at the Bethanie Nursing Home, 12 Hornsey Lane, Upper Holloway, London, on 24 November 1948. She had been a widow for many years, and her only daughter had died in March 1948.<br>
