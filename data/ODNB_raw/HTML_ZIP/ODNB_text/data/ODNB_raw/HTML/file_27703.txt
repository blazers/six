<span class="headword">Trench,  Richard Le Poer</span>, second earl of Clancarty  (1767&#150;1837), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, born on 18 May 1767, was the eldest surviving son of William Power Keating Trench, first earl of Clancarty (1741&#150;1805), and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1829), daughter of the Rt Hon. Charles Gardiner MP, of Dublin. His father, who was connected through his mother, Frances Power of Corheen, with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17378/', "Donough Maccarthy, fourth earl of Clancarty of the first creation")</script>, was born in 1741. He sat in the Irish parliament from 1769 to 1797 for the county of Galway, in which his seat, Garbally, was situated. On 29 November 1783 he supported Flood's motion for leave to bring in a reform bill, and on 12 August 1785 he opposed Pitt's commercial propositions when brought forward by Orde; but in 1791 he was attacked by George Ponsonby for supporting the government, in order to preserve its majority  (<span class="italic">Irish Parliamentary Debates</span>, 2nd edn, 11.321&#150;3). He was created an Irish peer on 25 November 1797, with the title of Baron Kilconnel of Garbally; on the occasion of the union and on his son's prompting to Castlereagh, he was further advanced as Viscount Dunlo on 3 January 1801, and earl of Clancarty on 12 February 1803. He died on 27 April 1805.<br>
<br>Richard Trench was called to the Irish bar, and in 1796 entered the Irish parliament as the member for Newtownlimavady. On 9 February that year he married Henrietta Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1847), daughter of the Rt Hon. John Staples and his first wife, Harriet, daughter of the Rt Hon. William Connolly of Castletown. His wife was &#145;an excellent, head-aching woman, with none of the representation or insolance of an Ambassadress&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>). They had three sons and four daughters. In 1798 Trench was returned to the Irish parliament for Galway county, which he continued to represent until the union. On 27 June 1798 he seconded the address to the crown; but both he and his brother Charles voted against the proposed union when first brought forward the following year. They were, however, induced to support it in 1800, when Richard was persuaded by Castlereagh, and Charles was appointed by Cornwallis to the new office of commissioner of inland revenue; their father's advance in the peerage was doubtless their reward. Richard Trench was elected to the first parliament of the United Kindom for Galway county as a supporter of Pitt, and on 23 November 1802 moved the address, dwelling in the course of his speech on the beneficial effects of the union. On 21 May 1804 (by which time he had become known as Viscount Dunlo) he was appointed a commissioner for the affairs of India. In the next parliament he sat (after his father's death) as earl of Clancarty for the borough of Rye, but on 16 December 1808 he was chosen a representative peer for Ireland. On 13 May 1807 he was sworn of the British, and on 26 December 1808 of the Irish, privy council; and in May 1807 he was appointed postmaster-general in Ireland. He further received the offices of master of the Royal Mint (1812&#150;14) and president of the Board of Trade (September 1812 to January 1818), and joint postmaster-general (1814&#150;16). Between 1810 and 1812 he was a frequent speaker in the House of Lords. On 6 June 1810 he expressed modified approval of the Catholic claims, but criticized severely the attitude adopted by the Irish Catholic hierarchy since 1808. When the question was raised by Lord Wellesley two years later, he declared against unqualified concession, but was in favour of a thorough examination. On 4 January 1811 Clancarty, in a closely reasoned speech, defended the resolutions restricting the powers of the regent.<br>
<br>In November 1813 Clancarty accompanied the prince of Orange to The Hague, and was accredited to him as British ambassador when he was proclaimed William I of the Netherlands. On 13 December he wrote to Castlereagh: &#145;What with correspondence with two admirals, four generals, British and allied, and your lordship, I am kept so well employed that I have scarcely time to eat or sleep&#146;. On the 14th he wrote urgently demanding the immediate dispatch of Thomas Graham (Lord Lynedoch) with reinforcements to the Netherlands. Early in 1814 he was in communication with Lord Liverpool, the prime minister, on the subject of the Dutch finances. Clancarty was energetic in urging on the prince of Orange the necessary military measures, and succeeded in persuading him to resign the command of the allied forces in the Netherlands to the prince royal of Sweden, Bernadotte. In the succeeding months he was chiefly engaged in formulating a plan for the incorporation of the Belgian and Dutch provinces into the proposed new state of the Netherlands  (cf. Yonge, 1.514). Other difficulties were the adjustment of financial relations and the claims of the Belgian clergy and nobility. During the summer months of 1814 his attention was also directed towards the opening up of a reciprocal colonial trade between Britain and the Netherlands, and to the resumption of negotiations for a marriage between Princess Charlotte of England and the hereditary prince of Orange.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Clancarty had kept himself fully informed of the general situation of European affairs. On 11 August he was named one of the four British plenipotentiaries to the congress of Vienna. Talleyrand, in a letter of 28 December to Louis XVIII, spoke of his zeal, firmness, and uprightness. When Wellington left Vienna for Belgium in March 1815, Clancarty became the senior British plenipotentiary. He was the British representative on the various commissions respectively appointed to delimit the Polish frontier and to adjust the affairs of Saxony (October 1814); to mediate between Sardinia and Genoa; to regulate the affairs of Tuscany and Parma, and to draw up a preliminary convention (8 February 1815). On 11 March 1815, in an interesting dispatch to Castlereagh, he described the consternation of the royalty of Europe at the news of Napoleon's escape from Elba, but thought it desirable to encourage their fears with the view of bringing to an end the business of the congress. After the peace, on 4 August 1815, he was created Baron Trench of Garbally in the peerage of the United Kingdom.<br>
<br>At the end of the year Clancarty went to Frankfurt am Main, and was engaged in resolving the disputes between Bavaria and Baden. On 22 May 1816 he was appointed ambassador to the new kingdom of the Netherlands, but was detained at Frankfurt through the summer. During his second embassy to the Netherlands Clancarty was at first mainly occupied in urging the king to take sufficiently strong measures against the French refugees in the Netherlands, who were plotting against the recent settlement of the country. Subsequently Clancarty devoted his attention to negotiations between Great Britain and the Netherlands for the suppression of the slave trade. During the remainder of the year he was chiefly occupied in negotiations with Prussia relating to frontier disputes and to the evacuation of the Netherlands by Prussian troops. During 1821 he was involved in contradicting Dutch claims that the slave-trade convention of 1818 had been confined to Africa.<br>
<br>In December 1823 Clancarty reluctantly resigned his post in the Netherlands. In 1818 he had received a pension of &pound;2000, and had also been created markies van Heusden by the king of the Netherlands. On retiring from The Hague he was made on 8 December 1823 Viscount Clancarty of co. Cork. He spent most of his retirement on his estates in Ireland, where he was lord lieutenant of co. Galway and vice-admiral of Connaught. On 8 March 1827, speaking in the House of Lords, he censured the negligence of the law officers in Ireland, and declared his opinion that no exceptional measures were necessary for repressing the Catholic Association; but in 1829 he opposed Catholic emancipation on account of the conduct of the Catholics. He said that, like Pitt, he would have granted relief on condition of their good behaviour. In the course of a correspondence with Wellington at this period, Clancarty complained of the lack of support given by the government to the cause of order in Ireland (7 July). Wellington, in reply, charged Clancarty with obstructing the emancipation bill.<br>
<br>Clancarty died at Kinnegad, co. Westmeath, on 24 November 1837, and his wife died on 30 December 1847 at Garbally. Their eldest son, William Thomas Le Poer Trench (1803&#150;1872), succeeded to his father's titles. Clancarty was an important member of Castlereagh's diplomatic team, &#145;hard-working, if opinionated and reactionary&#146;  (Webster, 2.40).<br>
