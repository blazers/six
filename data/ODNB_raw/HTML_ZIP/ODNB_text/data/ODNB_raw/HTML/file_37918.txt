<span class="headword">Rotz,  Jean</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1505, <em>d.</em> in or after 1560), <span class="occ">hydrographer</span>, was born in Dieppe. His father, David Ross, was one of a number of Scotsmen who went to Dieppe to seek a living. His mother was French, probably Dieppoise, and he was known in France as Jehan Roz. In his early years he sailed in the ships of the Dieppe <i>armateur</i> Jean Ango. He may have been on the expedition from Dieppe to Sumatra under the command of Jean Parmentier in 1529&#150;30. He was in Guinea and Brazil in 1539. From 1540 to 1542 he appears to have resided in Paris, where he studied the maritime sciences. He moved to London with his wife, Coleta, and his children in 1542 to seek service under Henry VIII. In September he was appointed royal hydrographer, and he and his wife and children were made denizens of England under royal warrant.<br>
<br>Rotz's first gifts to Henry were a navigating instrument of his own invention, the &#145;differential quadrant&#146; (a combined magnetic compass and universal dial), and a navigational treatise for its use, &#145;Traicte des differences du compas aymante&#146; (BL, Royal MS 20.B.vii). Rotz then presented to the king the &#145;Boke of idrography&#146;, 1542 (BL, Royal MS 20.E.ix), comprising a magnificent illuminated atlas of the world. Vignettes drawn <i>ad vivum</i> depict the lives of the inhabitants of the distant regions, such as a raja's procession in Sumatra and a Tupinamb&aacute; village in Brazil. A remarkable geographical feature is the &#145;Londe of Java&#146;, a land mass which may represent the Portuguese discovery of Australia in 1528. A further example of Rotz's work has been identified in an anonymous chart of the English Channel, <i>c</i>.1543 (BL, Cotton MS I.ii.65.66).<br>
<br>In January 1547, when Henry was dying, Rotz sought the help of the French ambassador Odet de Selve to secure his return to France. In order to win the favour of the French king he became a secret agent, and provided political and military intelligence and maps of England and Scotland. He effected his escape to France in June 1547 and became the leading merchant captain of Dieppe. In 1551 he was rewarded with a grant of ennoblement. In 1559 he was in charge of the naval operations for the abortive invasion of Scotland under the command of R&eacute;n&eacute; of Lorraine, marquis d'Elboeuf. He makes a final appearance with two ships at Middleburg, the port of Zeeland, on 8 June 1560.<br>
<br>Rotz was acclaimed in 1568 by Nicolas de Nicolay, &#145;premier Cosmographe du Roy&#146;, as one of the greatest French navigators, and, although his role as a hydrographer is not recorded in the early chronicles of Dieppe, his &#145;Boke&#146; ranks as one of the greatest maritime atlases of the Renaissance.<br>
