<span class="headword">Taylor,  Harold McCarter</span>  (1907&#150;1995), <span class="occ">physicist and architectural historian</span>, was born on 13 May 1907 in Dunedin, New Zealand, the younger son of James Taylor (1873&#150;1958), merchant, and his wife, Louisa Urquhart, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McCarter (1875&#150;1932), daughter of George Alfred McCarter and his wife, Matilda Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Urquhart. His father's family had migrated to the Scots settled city of Dunedin from Aberdeen, and his mother's from Coleraine, co. Londonderry.<br>
<br>Taylor was educated at Otago Boys' High School, and the University of Otago, graduating MSc with double first-class honours in 1928. From there he won a scholarship to Clare College, Cambridge, where he took the second part of the mathematical tripos in 1930, achieving senior wrangler with distinction in section B. Subsequently he joined the Cambridge Cavendish Laboratory when Sir Ernest Rutherford and his team of physicists were making spectacular advances in atomic research. He worked with mathematicians and theorists, headed by Ralph W. Fowler and including H. R. Hulme, who formed a productive partnership with the experimental physicists. Initially he conducted his research under Fowler and Nevill Mott, and between 1931 and 1936 he wrote or collaborated in writing important papers treating the anomalous scattering of alpha particles and the internal conversion of gamma rays. In 1933 he gained his PhD, was appointed university lecturer in mathematics, and elected fellow of Clare College. On 8 April the same year he married Joan Sills (1903&#150;1965), biologist and teacher, and daughter of George Reginald Sills, of Lincoln. They had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Taylor distinguished himself as scientist, teacher, and administrator not only in university service, but also in military service. His training in artillery began with a New Zealand territorials commission in 1925. He transferred to the British territorials, and was adjutant of the Cambridge area Officers' Training Corps from 1936. In 1941 he joined the School of Artillery, Larkhill, rising to senior instructor and lieutenant-colonel. In 1943 John Cockcroft and Nevill Mott invited him to join in atomic research, but he believed that he would contribute more to the war effort by remaining in gunnery. He went to Europe to solve problems of communication and rangefinding between British and American gunners, and in 1946 was awarded the J. H. Lefroy medal of the Royal Artillery for his distinguished work in artillery science.<br>
<br>In 1945 Taylor decided not to return to mathematics and took the post of Cambridge University treasurer. He moved from financial to academic administration eight years later when he became secretary-general of the faculties. He was appointed principal of the University College of North Staffordshire in 1961 and in the following year, when the college became the University of Keele, Taylor became its founding vice-chancellor. Keele embodied the boldest experiment in university education then being made in Britain. Its approach had been spearheaded by Alexander Lindsay, first Baron Lindsay of Birker, the first principal of the University College of North Staffordshire. Lindsay had advocated broad based education, developed at Keele in a four-year degree programme initiated by a foundation year of studies in both arts and sciences. Taylor, who at Cambridge had advocated joint courses in arts and sciences, espoused Lindsay's philosophy, and also showed his progressive outlook in establishing the first comprehensive university counselling service, covering educational, vocational, and personal needs. Taylor came to Keele when it was poised for expansion, but lack of funding hindered progress. He was highly regarded as vice-chancellor and took a leading role in issues of university funding after the Robbins report.<br>
<br>Taylor's interest in Anglo-Saxon architecture had evolved soon after his arrival in England, and by 1936 he and his wife, Joan&#151;who shared his interest&#151;had shaped plans for a comprehensive survey of surviving pre-conquest fabric in English churches. In thirty years they visited more than 400 churches to record Anglo-Saxon work, either intact, or preserved fragmentarily in later rebuildings. In addition to site work they searched out published discussions, antiquarian accounts, and other records of supposed Anglo-Saxon structures. Volumes 1 and 2 of <span class="italic">Anglo-Saxon Architecture</span> (1965) gave new impetus to research, providing a comprehensive, detailed, and accurate catalogue of surviving structures. Joan died suddenly only weeks before their publication.<br>
<br>This change in personal circumstance prompted Taylor to retire from Keele in order to have time to complete the final volume of <span class="italic">Anglo-Saxon Architecture</span> and in 1967 he returned to Cambridge, having, on 21 March 1966, married his former personal assistant Dorothy Judith Samuel (<i>b</i>. 1931), daughter of Charles Samuel of Liverpool. She provided further assistance in research. Volume 3 of <span class="italic">Anglo-Saxon Architecture</span> (1978) concentrated upon a well-defined group of churches, analysing their features in some detail. Harold and Joan Taylor had originally hoped that typological analysis of architectural features in England and on the continent might make it possible to date them more precisely, but Taylor concluded that to establish a chronology would be premature.<br>
<br>After 1965 Taylor published more than sixty papers, including some arising from new collaborations with archaeologists. Between 1971 and 1984 he worked with Philip Rahtz and L. A. S. Butler in a detailed investigation of St Mary's Church, Deerhurst, Gloucestershire. Excavations and the stripping of modern plaster from walls uncovered hitherto concealed evidence for the phases of Anglo-Saxon construction. Between 1974 and 1988 he worked with Martin Biddle and Birthe Kj&oslash;lbye-Biddle at St Wystan's, Repton, revealing new details about the evolution of the church and its crypt mausoleum.<br>
<br>Taylor was a modest, mannered man of acuteness and precision, with a deep Christian faith. His energy was remarkable. Much of his research was conducted in his spare time, while holding onerous administrative positions. At Keele he and his wife Joan were known to rise before dawn to conduct research before his punctual arrival at the vice-chancellor's office each morning. Other leisure activities included walking and alpine skiing. Ill health ended his research in his last years. He died of pneumonia in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, on 23 October 1995, and was survived by his wife and the four children of his first marriage. He was cremated on 30 October and his ashes were interred at All Souls' cemetery, Cambridge, on 3 December.<br>
