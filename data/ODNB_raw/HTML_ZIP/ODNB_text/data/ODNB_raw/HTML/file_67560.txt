<span class="headword">Maddox,  Anthony</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1758), <span class="occ">slack-wire acrobat</span>, was probably the son of James Maddox, a Bristol dancing-master, and his wife, a Miss Hoyle, who both died in 1744. There is no confident knowledge of his activities before the sudden notoriety of his d&eacute;but season at Sadler's Wells in 1751. Maddox was a supreme exponent of slack-wire acrobatics. He would set the wire swinging, then balance his hat on his chin while playing the violin (as a later refinement, he would simultaneously play the trumpet and the violin while swinging), he would lie on the wire or stand on his head as it swung, he would balance several pipes or full wineglasses, and conclude his act with a hornpipe. Contemporary engravings, though, suggest that it was his passing of a straw from foot to face and back again that most caught the popular imagination. It is possible that the Maddox vogue owed something to the iconographic force of a &#145;balance-master&#146; a decade after the fall of Walpole and with the events of 1745 still vivid in the public memory. Whatever the explanation, Maddox was able speedily to amass sufficient wealth to announce his early retirement in December 1754. Still popular at Thomas Rosoman's &#145;low&#146; theatre at Sadler's Wells, he had also appeared at John Rich's Covent Garden in a showy revival of Rich's afterpiece <span class="italic">The Fair</span>, which began a run of twenty-eight nights on 2 November 1752. The last night was commanded by the young prince of Wales, the future George III. Garrick protested when his partner, James Lacy, proposed to &#145;bring such defilement and abomination into the <i>house of</i> <i>Shakespeare</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.172), and Lacy had to settle for the Haymarket instead of Drury Lane.<br>
<br>Maddox was as sought after in Dublin as he was in London. He was performing at the Smock Alley playhouse in 1752&#150;3, and he and his wife, Elizabeth, shared a benefit there on 6 June 1753. He was recalled to Dublin in the autumn of 1758, in the company of Theophilus Cibber, who had been one of many to encourage him out of retirement in 1756. Cibber and Maddox set sail in the <i>Dublin Trader</i> on 27 October 1758, and were among those drowned when the packet sank in a storm. In his will, dated 3 October 1758, Maddox bequeathed to his wife Elizabeth all his real estate in Bristol, Devon, and elsewhere, and &pound;10 to each of three siblings.<br>
<br>There is no mention of <a name="cosubject_67560"></a><span class="headword">Michael Maddox</span>  (<em>b. </em>1747), who may have been a nephew rather than a son, and whose extraordinary career as a <span class="occ">dancer, equilibrist, and entrepreneur</span> culminated in the award, in 1805, of a pension of 3000 roubles for services to the Russian theatre. While he was known to have performed his slack-wire act in Russia in 1767, Maddox made his first English appearance at the Haymarket on 10 December 1770. He repeated most of Anthony Maddox's tricks, with the additional refinement of simultaneously playing the violin, french horn, and drum while swinging on the wire. From a clipping in the A. M. Broadley Collection at Westminster Public Library, dated 4 January 1772, he is known to have had financially advantageous &#145;affairs in Sweden&#146;, but the nature of those affairs is mysterious. He was probably back in Russia by 1772. There he made and exhibited automata and presented experiments in the physical sciences. He also seems to have invented and installed machinery for the Znamenka Theatre in Moscow, of which he was joint manager with Prince Urasov.<br>
