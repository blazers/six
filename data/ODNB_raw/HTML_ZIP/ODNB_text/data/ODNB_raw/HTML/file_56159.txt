<span class="headword">Druce,  (John) Gerald Frederick</span>  (1894&#150;1950), <span class="occ">chemist and schoolmaster</span>, was born on 8 December 1894 at 14 St John's Road, Leamington Spa, the son of Frederick Druce, an assistant manager of a coffee house (and later a gardener), and his wife, Hannah Freeman. Following the family's move to Reading, he was educated at Kendrick School and at University College, Reading (1911&#150;12), before studying chemistry and botany at University College, London, where he graduated BSc in 1915. Following war service he pursued independent research, obtaining an MSc from the University of London in 1920. At University College he had met the Czech chemist, Jardslav Heyrovsk&yacute; (1890&#150;1967), who inspired him to visit Czechoslovakia in 1920 and to learn Czech and other Slavonic languages. He studied chemistry with Heyrovsk&yacute; at the Charles University in Prague and was awarded a doctorate in 1923. In the same year Druce began to teach chemistry and botany at Battersea grammar school, where he set up a temporary research laboratory in the playground at St John's Hill, Clapham. Later, he built a laboratory in his garden. In 1921 he married Elsie Olive (<i>b</i>. 1895/6), the daughter of Edward James Caudell, a blouse manufacturer; they had one son.<br>
<br>Mendeleyev had predicted the existence of two missing elements, eka- and dimanganese, in group VII of the periodic table, and the likely existence of elements of masses 43 and 75 had been confirmed from X-ray spectra by H. G. J. Moseley in 1915. Using his school facilities to concentrate solutions of pyrolusite, and in collaboration with the physicist F. H. Loring (<i>d</i>. 1944), in 1925 Druce announced the discovery of missing element, atomic number 75, in the form of potassium per-rhenate. While Druce's preparation of a rhenium salt was undoubtedly genuine, the international community allowed the honour of discovery of the pure element to go to the Germans W. Noddack, I. Tacke, and O. Berg, who in the same year gave the name rhenium to the element they had isolated from columbite and molybdenite. Druce's findings were corroborated by Heyrovsk&yacute;, who had also identified rhenium by means of polarography. Druce compiled the first textbook on the preparation and properties of this rare element in 1948.<br>
<br>Druce was elected a fellow of the Chemical Society in 1915 and became a licentiate (1919) and fellow (1925) of the Royal Institute of Chemistry. He travelled extensively in eastern Europe, visiting Czechoslovakia at least once a year and wrote two books (1930 and 1936) on the country, as well as a monograph on the Czech scientists B. Brauner and F. Wald. He was a personal friend of the first Czech president, Thom&aacute;s Masaryk (1850&#150;1937) and shared his conviction that &#145;truth prevails&#146; (&#145;pravda v&iacute;t&#283;z&iacute;&#146;). Druce was awarded the order of the White Lion by the Czech government for his cultural and scientific work as well as membership of several Czech learned societies. His strong interests in the history of science were reflected in a book in 1925, and a London MA thesis in 1943. He published many articles on preparative inorganic chemistry, was a regular contributor to <span class="italic">Chemical News</span>, and served in an editorial capacity during its declining years, 1924&#150;31.<br>
<br>A quiet, unassuming man, Druce was an inspiring teacher who impressed his pupils with his experimental skills. He was probably the last chemist to find ways and means of doing original research in a secondary school environment. He died at the Royal Cancer Hospital, Fulham Road, London, on 22 June 1950.<br>
