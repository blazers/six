<span class="headword">Onwhyn,  Thomas</span>  (1814&#150;1886), <span class="occ">illustrator</span>, was born in Clerkenwell, London, the eldest son of Joseph Onwhyn, a bookseller and newsagent at 3 Catherine Street, the Strand, London, and his wife, Fanny. In the 1830s and 1840s Joseph Onwhyn published a number of guides for tourists&#151;to the highlands, Killarney, Wales, and the Lakes&#151;chiefly compiled from his own notes and observations. Founded in 1864, <span class="italic">The Owl</span> (a society newspaper) was published by Joseph Onwhyn, though its success afterwards affected his mind.<br>
<br>Thomas Onwhyn came to public notice by his contribution of a series of &#145;illegitimate&#146; illustrations to works by Charles Dickens. He executed twenty-one of the whole series of thirty-two plates to <span class="italic">The Pickwick Papers</span>, which were issued in eight (though intended to be in ten) monthly parts by E. Grattan, 51 Paternoster Row, London, in 1837; they are for the most part signed with the pseudonym Samuel Weller, but some bear Onwhyn's initials. From June 1838 to October 1839 Grattan issued a series of forty etchings by Onwhyn, illustrating <span class="italic">Nicholas Nickleby</span>. In a letter of 13 July 1838 Dickens referred to &#145;the singular Vileness of the Illustrations&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 1.414). He objected to piracy but not to imitation and was friendly with Charles Selby, the author of <span class="italic">Maximums and Specimens of William Muggins</span> (1841), which was also illustrated by Onwhyn  (ibid., 2.332). After his death an additional set of illustrations to <span class="italic">The Pickwick Papers</span> made by Onwhyn in 1847 was discovered and they were published in 1893 by Albert Jackson of Great Portland Street, London.<br>
<br>Onwhyn's most lasting contribution was to the ephemeral end of the book trade in the 1840s and 1850s, illustrating the comic side of everyday life. Undertaken for shadowy publishers such as Rock Bros and Payne, and Kershaw &amp; Son, he produced a score of pull-out or panorama books, coloured and plain, lithographed or etched for the popular market. Satirizing tourism, teetotalism, and fashion, they included <span class="italic">Etiquette Illustrated</span> (1849), <span class="italic">A New Matrimonial Ladder</span> (<i>c</i>.1850), <span class="italic">What I Saw at the World's Fair</span> (1851), <span class="italic">Mr and Mrs Brown's Visit to the Exhibition</span> (1851), <span class="italic">A Glass of Grog Drawn from the Bottle &hellip;</span> (1853), <span class="italic">Cupid's Crinoline</span> (1858), <span class="italic">Nothing to Wear</span> (1858), and <span class="italic">Scenes on the Sands</span> (<i>c</i>.1860). He signed his work T. O., O., or with the pseudonym Peter Palette, as in <span class="italic">Peter Palette's Tales and Pictures in Short Words for Young Folks</span> (1856). He sometimes etched the designs of others&#151;for example, <span class="italic">Oakleigh, or, The Minor of Great Expectations</span> by W. H. Holmes (1843). He was an indifferent draughtsman but showed real humour in his designs. His talent was somewhat overshadowed by those of his most eminent contemporaries such as George Cruikshank and Hablot K. Browne (Phiz). Onwhyn, who also drew views of scenery for guidebooks and illustrated six novels by Henry Cockton, abandoned artistic work, becoming a newsagent for the last twenty or thirty years of his life. He died on 21 January 1886, at his home, 9 Great Mays Buildings, St Martin's Lane, London. He was survived by his wife, Maria.<br>
