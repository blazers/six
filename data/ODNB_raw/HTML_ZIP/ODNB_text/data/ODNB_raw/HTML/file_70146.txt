<span class="headword">Gloag,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1795, <em>d.</em> 1870), <span class="occ">teacher of mathematics and educationist</span>, was baptized on 5 October 1795 at Gretna, Dumfriesshire, the second of six children of Andrew Gloag (<i>b</i>. 1761), a cotton hand-loom weaver at Rigg in that parish, and his wife, Agnes Gordon. Though details of Gloag's early schooling are unknown it was adequate to prepare him for the arts and philosophy course at United College, St Andrews, which he studied in 1814&#150;18. His attendance at the first session of the divinity course at St Mary's College, St Andrews (1818&#150;19), together with the tutoring he undertook to finance his studies, reveals Gloag's original intention to become a Church of Scotland minister. After an unsuccessful attempt in 1820 to become rector of Dundee Academy he became mathematics master at George Heriot's Hospital in Edinburgh, and taught there from 1820 to 1824.<br>
<br>With the creation of the new and progressive Edinburgh Academy in 1824 Gloag submitted his printed <span class="italic">Testimonials in Favour of James Gloag</span>, which contained references from no fewer than five professors and from the ministers of eight of the most important Edinburgh churches. Henry (later Lord) Cockburn, in an annotation to his own copy, wrote of Gloag that he was &#145;A sensible looking man with a pale face and hoarse voice. Gentle and amiable&#146;; the latter point was debatable as Gloag was repeatedly censured for his use of excessive corporal punishment. He was nevertheless appointed as the academy's first master of the mathematical and geometrical school, a post which he held with distinction for exactly forty years until his retirement in July 1864, when his former pupils established the Gloag medal for mathematics in his honour. A born, though irascible, teacher&#151;the rector's annual report for 1833 described him as &#145;most honest, zealous and energetic&#146;&#151;the quantifiable successes of his mathematical pupils at Cambridge University alone included ten wranglers, most importantly James Clerk Maxwell (second wrangler, 1854) and Peter Guthrie Tait (senior wrangler, 1852), both of whom were also first Smith's prizeman. At a dinner celebrating Tait's success Gloag &#145;could hardly divest himself of the idea that <i>he</i> was the hero of the occasion, such credit did he take to himself&#146;  (Fergusson, 85). While most writers on Maxwell and Tait have noted Gloag's early influence, George Davie cites Gloag directly (though he misnames him John) as one of the last of a type of Scottish schoolmaster, himself taught at a Scottish university, who brought a distinctively Scottish, metaphysical approach to the teaching of mathematics and science  (Davie, 197). Indeed it has been suggested that &#145;The Directors dreamed of a great classical school and accidentally [in Gloag] founded a great mathematical one&#146;  (Harris).<br>
<br>Gloag was a founder member, in 1847, of the Educational Institute of Scotland, of which he was also a fellow. He was secretary to its board of examiners for many years, and its president in 1855&#150;6, having already received an honorary degree of LLD in 1848 for his legendary educational prowess. In an uncharacteristically apologetic presidential address, on 20 September 1856, Gloag bewailed the failure of the institute to make a sufficient impact on the Scottish teaching profession while at the same time applauding the efforts of the lord advocate, James Moncrieff, in acknowledging, for the first time, the institute's essential and professional role.<br>
<br>In appearance Gloag was:<blockquote>a heavy, broad, square-shaped man of average height; with a long oval face; keen, deep-set, black eyes under bushy black eye-brows, and &hellip; at first, short, black hair and close-cut whiskers&#151;not an ill-looking man. His voice had a peculiarly deep sound, very impressive. (Fergusson, 36&#150;7)</blockquote>With an impenetrable Dumfriesshire accent, which he never lost, Gloag was an iron disciplinarian and a legendary flogger, presenting his tawse to one of the school clubs after his retirement. In the many anecdotal recollections of him by his eminent pupils he comes across as fair, though strict&#151;&#145;outwardly playful, but fraught with concealed severity&#146;&#151;but well respected by his pupils  (Fergusson, 46).<br>
<br>On 28 September 1832, at St Cuthbert's Church, Edinburgh, James Gloag married Elizabeth (1793&#150;1869), daughter of James Muir, a burgess of the Merchant Company of Edinburgh, and his wife, Janet Black. They had one daughter, Janet (Jessie) Black Gloag, later Shepherd (1835&#150;1873), whose two daughters both died in infancy. Gloag himself died, of influenza and bronchitis, at 32 Tower Street, Portobello, Edinburgh, on 21 January 1870. He was buried two days later in Warriston cemetery, Edinburgh, where his headstone survives.<br>
