<span class="headword">Kane,  John</span>  (1819&#150;1876), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 18 July 1819 at Alnwick, Northumberland. His father was the son of a Methodist minister and had served as an attorney but Kane's prospects of a comfortable upbringing were destroyed when he was orphaned while still very young. He started work in a tobacco factory at the age of seven and between the ages of nine and twelve he attended school in Alnwick. He was then apprenticed to a gardener but ran away after being beaten for refusing to take part in a contrived demonstration of welcome for the estate owner. Kane subsequently found work in the mills of Hawks, Crawshay &amp; Sons, iron manufacturers, of Gateshead and soon became well known as a forceful speaker and astute negotiator in disputes with the management. In 1842 he formed a union in Gateshead and though it soon collapsed he remained convinced that it was possible to establish effective organization among the ironworkers and the rest of his life was dedicated to this end.<br>
<br>The strongly cyclical nature of the industry and the ruthless opposition of the ironmasters kept Kane's ambition in abeyance for the next twenty years and during this time his restless energy was diverted into a variety of working-class causes. He was involved in the later stages of the Chartist movement on Tyneside and subsequently became a leading figure in the Northern Reform Union. He was also a founder member of the Cramlington Co-operative Society, helped set up a working men's reading room in Newcastle, and lectured on temperance (he was a lifelong teetotaller).<br>
<br>Kane finally achieved his ambition to establish a lasting union in 1862, when he formed the National Association of Ironworkers with headquarters in Gateshead. He was elected the paid president at a salary of &pound;140 per year and set out to extend the National Association into other ironmaking districts but in doing so he encountered fierce opposition from two unions based in south Staffordshire. There were some bitter battles until, in 1868, depression brought about the collapse of both Staffordshire unions, leaving the National Association as the sole focus of organization but with its membership and finances at a desperately low ebb.<br>
<br>Kane set about rebuilding the union by taking the position of general secretary so that he could exercise tighter control over day-to-day administration, moving the headquarters to Darlington and launching a fortnightly newspaper, the <span class="italic">Ironworkers' Journal</span>, which he edited. These moves were followed by a massive increase in membership, which rose from under 500 in 1868 to 35,000 by the later months of 1873. This dramatic growth certainly owed something to Kane's drive and organizing ability but the main factor was the great industrial boom of the early 1870s which <i>inter alia</i> carried trade union membership generally to unprecedented heights. Kane's wife, Jane, shared his union interests and &#145;laboured heart and hand with her husband in every sphere in which he was engaged&#146;  (<span class="italic">Northern Echo</span>, 22 March 1876). From 1862 she was responsible for much of the administration of the ironworkers' unions.<br>
<br>While overseeing his union's recovery Kane was also engaged in establishing a completely new relationship between the ironworkers and their employers. He said in evidence to the royal commission on trades unions in 1867 that strikes and lock-outs were very prejudicial to all classes and, like war, left a trail of misery behind them, and went on to advocate that conciliation boards should be set up in the iron industry. He found a powerful ally in David Dale, the Quaker managing director of the Consett Iron Company, and in 1869 the two came together to establish the board of arbitration and conciliation for the manufactured iron trade of the north of England. The rules did not allow union representation but Kane was appointed the paid secretary to the workmen's panel. The formation of the board was widely welcomed on both sides of the industry and in 1870 the ironworkers acknowledged Kane's contribution to leading them out of chaos by presenting him with a gold watch, gold guard and seal, an illuminated address in a gold frame, and a purse of gold sovereigns. His wife was also presented with a gold watch and gold guard, and a locket.<br>
<br>During these years Kane was also active in the wider trade union movement. He was present at the Manchester conference in 1868 which inaugurated the TUC and subsequently became a leading member of its parliamentary committee, serving as joint chairman in 1875. The main concern of the TUC in its early years was the ambiguous legal status of the unions and Kane was among those who felt that direct labour representation in parliament was needed to remedy the situation. He accordingly contested Middlesbrough at the 1874 general election with the support of his union and the Labour Representation League, finishing a creditable second ahead of the Conservative in a three-cornered fight.<br>
<br>By this time the great industrial boom was over and as it collapsed so did trade union membership. The ironworkers' union was no exception and Kane's ceaseless efforts to shore up its crumbling organization undermined his health and brought about his premature death. Kane died in Birmingham, where he was on union business, on 21 March 1876, following a stroke two days earlier. He was buried in the west cemetery, Darlington, on 24 March 1876. His wife and at least one son survived him. His obituary in the <span class="italic">Darlington and Richmond Herald</span> on 25 March 1876 described him fittingly as &#145;an indomitable man&#146;.<br>
