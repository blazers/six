<span class="headword">Murnaghan,  Sheelagh Mary</span>  (1924&#150;1993), <span class="occ">politician and barrister</span>, was born in Dublin city on 26 May 1924, the eldest of six children. Her family background was Catholic and strongly nationalist; her grandfather George Murnaghan had been a nationalist MP until 1910. Murnaghan was educated by the Catholic Loreto sisters in Omagh, co. Tyrone, where her family resided. Murnaghan began an arts degree at the Queen's University of Belfast in 1942 but the following year changed to a law degree. She became president of the University Literary and Scientific Debating Society in 1947. She was awarded an LLB in 1947, and afterwards read for the bar. She was one of the first women barristers in the north of Ireland. She was also a keen sportswoman and played for the Irish international women's hockey team, touring with the team (which she captained in 1955&#150;6 and 1957&#150;8) in South Africa in 1950 and the United States in 1954. Her international hockey career ended in 1959.<br>
<br>Murnaghan became a member of the Ulster Liberal Association in 1959. Shortly after joining the party she was selected as a Liberal candidate in her home constituency of South Belfast. However, she did not win a seat. In 1961 she was selected as a candidate for a Queen's University by-election. Her election campaign focused on the deficiencies of the Unionist government, and she won the seat, owing primarily to a large Unionist abstention and an increase in the non-Unionist vote. On taking her seat at Stormont in December 1961 she gained a reputation as a radical and active member of parliament. She retained the seat in the 1962 Northern Ireland general election, and was returned unopposed in 1965. Murnaghan was the only Liberal MP to sit in the Northern Ireland parliament in its lifetime, 1921&#150;72. During her eight-year parliamentary career Murnaghan spoke on a diverse range of subjects and pushed for the introduction of Liberal policies through Stormont. There were three issues that were of particular concern and interest to her: the plight of travelling people, criminal law reform, and human rights. She raised issues about the provision of properly equipped campsites for travelling families, their harassment by local authorities, and their national insurance entitlements. Such concerns found few supporters. Her first private member's bill, the <span class="roman">Homicide and Criminal Responsibility Bill</span>, was introduced in 1963 and focused on making provision for homicides not then covered by the law, and also sought to abolish capital punishment. The bill was narrowly defeated (by twenty-three votes to nineteen) and the government introduced its own <span class="roman">Criminal Justice Bill</span> in 1963, the major difference from Murnaghan's bill being the retention of the death penalty.<br>
<br>Murnaghan made four attempts to have a human rights bill enacted, intended to counter racial, religious, and sexual discrimination. The first bill was introduced in June 1964. She believed that &#145;one cannot legislate unjust discrimination out of existence. One can, however, give a lead by making it perfectly clear to every citizen what he may or may not do&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 56.1989). The bill was defeated on a second reading in the commons by twenty-three votes to seventeen on 16 June 1964. Her second human rights bill was also defeated on a second reading in February 1966. Arguing for support for this second bill Murnaghan stated &#145;It is utterly incredible that in a predominantly Christian community a man's religion should be weighed against him in the balance in his daily life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 62.685). A third attempt to have a human rights bill enacted was made in February 1967; this again failed, as did another attempt in December 1967. Opposition to the bills was based on the belief that adequate legislative provision against discrimination existed under the <span class="roman">Government of Ireland Act</span> (1920).<br>
<br>Attempts to introduce the bill for the fifth time failed with the abolition of the Queen's University seat. Murnaghan failed to win a seat for North Down in the 1969 general election. Events in Northern Ireland overtook her parliamentary attempts to legislate for reform. The civil rights marches and demands, and the outbreak of violence, were to alter the face of parliamentary politics in Northern Ireland. The introduction of direct rule in 1972 ended her political opportunities. Murnaghan was a member of the Community Relations Commission and supported many of the demands of the civil rights movement. She was chosen by the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, William Whitelaw, to be a member of his special advisory committee in 1972. Jeremy Thorpe was later to recall that one of the first remarks made to him by Murnaghan was &#145;In Northern Irish politics I don't know which is the greatest obstacle, to be a woman, a Catholic or a Liberal. I am all three&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 22 Sept 1993). Sheelagh Murnaghan died, unmarried, on 14 September 1993 from lung cancer at Beaconsfield Marie Curie Centre, Kensington Road, Belfast. She was cremated at Roselawn crematorium in Belfast two days later.<br>
