<span class="headword">Orr,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1760&#150;1835), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, became a cadet in the Madras army, and arrived in India in 1777. On 18 August 1777 he was appointed ensign in the 21st Madras native infantry, and served with them in 1778 at the siege of Pondicherry, during which, the adjutant of the 2nd battalion of the 2nd Madras European regiment having been killed, Orr was transferred to that corps. After the siege he served for some time as brigade major to a detachment under Colonel Hopkins. Towards the end of 1780 he was appointed to command a mixed flying column, to escort supplies to Sir Eyre Coote's army and to various forts, many of which were blockaded. This was very onerous: it was impossible to carry tents and there was much exposure as well as fatigue, and Orr's health suffered. He was constantly in battle, and on one occasion was repeatedly charged by up to 2000 enemy cavalry. He was promoted lieutenant on 12 August 1781, and captain on 20 May 1785. At the end of the war in 1784 Orr, highly commended, was rewarded by being transferred to the cavalry, and appointed to the prestigious command of the governor's bodyguard. He held this appointment until 1787, when he had to go on sick-leave to England.<br>
<br>Orr returned to India in 1789 and, joining the 1st native cavalry as second in command, took part in the Anglo-Mysore War of 1790&#150;92. His regiment in March 1791 formed part of the force which, under Colonel Floyd, when close to Bangalore, was lured into an ambush. A sudden attack by a superior force followed, and nearly resulted in their destruction. Eventually Floyd was relieved by a supporting brigade of Indian infantry which came up to his support and made possible his retreat. His command consisted of the 19th light dragoons and five corps of Indian cavalry; 271 horses were lost, and 71 men killed, wounded, or missing, Floyd himself being among the wounded. In April 1791 Orr became major, and at the head of the 1st native cavalry took part in Floyd's charge on the Mysore army when it was retreating, shortly before the battle outside Seringapatam, in May 1791. In this charge Orr captured two standards with his own hand. In July of the same year he was transferred to the 5th native cavalry. In November 1798 he became lieutenant-colonel, and in January 1799, after transferring to the 3rd native cavalry, proceeded to England on leave. In April 1802 he became full colonel, and in December 1802, being still in England, was transferred to the command of the 7th native cavalry. In 1805 he obtained his regiment (that is, received colonel's allowances or off-reckonings). He became major-general in October 1809, and lieutenant-general in June 1814. He died in London on 26 November 1835.<br>
