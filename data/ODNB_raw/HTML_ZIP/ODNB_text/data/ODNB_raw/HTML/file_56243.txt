<span class="headword">Marsh,  Charlotte Augusta Leopoldine</span>  (1887&#150;1961), <span class="occ">suffragette and social worker</span>, was born on 3 March 1887 at Alnmouth, Northumberland, the third daughter of Arthur Hardwick Marsh (1842&#150;1909), watercolourist and genre painter, and his wife, Ellen Hall. She was educated at St Margaret's School, Newcastle upon Tyne, and Roseneath, Wrexham, and then spent a year studying in Bordeaux. She was one of the first women to train as a sanitary inspector but, appalled by the insight her work gave her into the lives of many women, gave up a promising career to join the women's suffrage movement in 1908, to give women a voice in public affairs. She became a member of the most militant organization, the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU).<br>
<br>Charlotte Marsh was a regional organizer for the WSPU, working in many cities and towns, including Nottingham and Portsmouth, and was imprisoned three times for &#145;the cause&#146;, hunger-striking on two occasions and being forcibly fed. On 30 June 1908 she was one of twenty-five women arrested following a demonstration in Parliament Square. Charged with obstructing the police in the execution of their duty she was sentenced to one month in the second division at Holloway. On 17 September 1909, along with fellow suffragette Mary Leigh, Charlotte was arrested in Birmingham after staging a roof-top protest at the Bingley Hall where the prime minister, H. H. Asquith, was addressing a meeting. The police attempted to move the two women by, among other methods, turning a hosepipe on them and throwing stones. However, Charlotte Marsh and Mary Leigh proved to be formidable opponents and were only brought down from the roof when three policeman dragged them down. For her part in this, Charlotte Marsh was sentenced to three months' hard labour at Winson Green gaol. In protest at the refusal of the authorities to treat her as a political prisoner Charlotte adopted the hunger strike and, one of the first suffragettes to be forcibly fed, was tube-fed 139 times. She was imprisoned for the last time in 1912 for her part in the window-smashing raid in London's West End on 1 March. As she had previous convictions she was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, which she served in Aylesbury prison (Holloway was being redecorated). Once again she staged a hunger strike and was forcibly fed and released four and a half months into her sentence.<br>
<br>A beautiful and striking figure with long golden hair and an elegant poise, Charlotte Marsh was often chosen as standard-bearer for WSPU processions. In December 1908 she was the colour-bearer at the procession organized to celebrate the release from Holloway of Christabel and Mrs Pankhurst. On 14 June 1913, a more solemn occasion, carrying a large wooden cross, she led the funeral procession of her comrade Emily Wilding Davison, who had died as a result of the injuries she sustained when she fell under the hooves of the king's horse at the Epsom Derby on 4 June.<br>
<br>Charlotte Marsh continued to work with the Pankhursts until the outbreak of the First World War, when the WSPU declared a cessation of militancy. Ironically, during this political truce, having first worked as a motor mechanic, she became Lloyd George's chauffeur, accepting his suggestion that the relationship would promote the victory of the cause of women's enfranchisement. She later worked as a land girl in Surrey before returning to feminist politics in 1919 when she worked for a brief time on the staff of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. Following the granting of the full franchise in 1928, Charlotte devoted her time to social welfare work. She worked first for the Community Chest Organization in San Francisco and then with the Overseas Settlement League, and when this organization closed down in the 1930s she became an officer of the National Assistance Board until her retirement. In later years Charlotte Marsh worked as a technical adviser on a BBC documentary, written and produced by Norman Swallow, to celebrate Mrs Pankhurst's birthday, the story of which was woven around Charlotte's life. She continued to be involved with suffrage commemorations and gave many years' service to the Suffragette Fellowship of which she was the vice-president until her death, unmarried, at 31 Copse Hill, Wimbledon, on 21 April 1961.<br>
