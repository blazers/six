<span class="headword">Cornwell <span class="st"> [<em>other married names </em>Whiteman, Robinson]</span>,  Alice Ann</span>  (1852&#150;1932), <span class="occ">goldmining industrialist and newspaper proprietor</span>, was born on 1 January 1852 at 18 Bakers Row, West Ham, Essex, one of at least three daughters of George Cornwell, railway guard, and his wife, Jemima Ridpath. At the age of nine she emigrated with her parents to Dunedin, New Zealand. She remained there until the age of seventeen when she left with her parents for Victoria, Australia. Her father became a builder and railway contractor and, later, a gold prospector. While in Victoria, on 4 December 1875 Alice married John Whiteman (<i>d</i>. 1892), a politician and poet, and on 17 February 1877 she gave birth to a son, George Frederick Francis Carl. There was, however, a great disparity in age between Alice and her husband, and a formal separation took place subsequently.<br>
<br>Alice Cornwell, as she was known, returned to England, and after studying at the Royal Academy of Music, where she won several gold medals and composed a number of popular songs and pianoforte pieces, taught music at Queen's College. Following the death of her mother, however, she went back to Australia where her father was then occupied in mining speculations and losing money. Alice Cornwell made herself acquainted with the geology of the goldfield, and convinced herself, and persuaded others, that payable &#145;reefs&#146; underlay her father's property. Sufficient capital was raised and a shaft sunk: and a vein of gold was struck apparently within a foot of the point at which she had indicated its existence. This discovery was made in the teeth of strong local scepticism and proved to be one of the richest strikes in Victoria: the establishment of the Midas mine in Sulky Gully, Ballarat, led to her becoming known as &#145;Princess Midas&#146;. The Midas Mine Company was later floated on the London stock market.<br>
<br>With the riches from her goldmine, Alice Cornwell became a well-known and flamboyant figure in Melbourne and London. In late October 1887 <span class="italic">The Times</span> reported a private view of the Midas gold nugget that Alice Cornwell had arranged at 32 Queen Victoria Street, London. Called the &#145;Lady Loch&#146;, after the wife of the governor of Victoria, it weighed 617 oz, measured 1 foot by 8 inches, and was valued at &pound;2537. <span class="italic">The Times</span> reported that it was the seventh largest nugget found at Ballarat since &#145;the Midas gold field has been opened up through the perseverance of Miss Cornwall [as her name was popularly misspelt]&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 Oct 1887).<br>
<br>In 1887 Alice Cornwell bought the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> from the FitzGeorge family. Her aim was partly to publicize her next mining venture, the British and Australasian Mining Investment Company, but the editorship was also intended as a present for Frederick Stannard (&#145;Phil&#146;) Robinson, a war correspondent whom she was to marry in 1894.<br>
<br>Returning to Australia in the following year, Alice Cornwell's next speculative venture was the purchase of the Wyong estate at a cost of &pound;280,000. This covered 17,000 acres between Sydney and Newcastle and offered excellent prospects for coalmining. Alice Cornwell was also involved in the development of a harbour at Port Adelaide.<br>
<br>In an interview published in Victoria in 1888, Alice Cornwell commented on the prospects for the newspaper she had bought. &#145;I bought <span class="italic">The Sunday Times</span>, a Conservative paper. It would be called Liberal out here, for mostly what is Conservative at home is Liberal in Victoria, and so <i>vice versa</i>.&#146; She added that when she had bought the paper it was only a scissors and paste affair, with hardly any original news, but after being placed under the management of Phil Robinson it began to be a splendid paper, &#145;and when I left its circulation was rapidly increasing&#146;  (Hobson, Knightley, and Russell, 50). However in reality although the price of the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> was reduced to 1<i>d</i>. in a bid to undercut <span class="italic">The Observer</span> and to fight it out with a new rival, <span class="italic">The People</span>, also priced at 1<i>d</i>., the circulation remained unresponsive. Although a charming writer, Phil Robinson was a reluctant editor, and left to join Alice Cornwell in Victoria, where he also gave a series of lectures. While he was in Australia, the temporary editorship of the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> was in the hands of Joseph Hatton.<br>
<br>The late 1880s saw the height of Alice Cornwell's fame. She was the subject of a novel entitled <span class="italic">Madame Midas</span> (1888) by Fergus Hume. This was later turned into a play, which led to a lawsuit in Australia by John Whiteman, then still her husband. Then in July 1889 Alice Cornwell was featured in <span class="italic">Men and Women of the Day</span>, where she was described as &#145;singularly earnest and sincere &hellip; a woman who has adopted a role unprecedented among her sex&#146;. The article deemed her to be &#145;one of the most remarkable women of her time&#146;  (p. 80).<br>
<br>After over five years as a newspaper proprietor, and having lost money through her mining failures, Alice Cornwell sold the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> in 1893 to Frederick and Rachel Beer. She settled in England and, known formally as Mrs Stannard Robinson, became a successful breeder and exhibitor of pugs, and in 1894 founded the Ladies' Kennel Association. To give publicity to the organization she launched the <span class="italic">Ladies' Kennel Journal</span>. A keen supporter of the organization was the princess of Wales, later Queen Alexandra.<br>
<br>Alice Cornwell's son became a professional actor at the age of nineteen, changing his name to Sydney Carroll, and for many years was a well-known writer on the theatre, and film critic of the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>. Alice Cornwell died of cancer of the kidney on 7 January 1932 at 19 Palmeria Square, Hove. Her second husband predeceased her.<br>
