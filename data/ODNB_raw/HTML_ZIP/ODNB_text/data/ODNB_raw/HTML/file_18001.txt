<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mant,  Richard</span>  (1776&#150;1848), <span class="occ">bishop of Down, Connor, and Dromore</span>, eldest son and fifth child of Richard Mant DD (<i>d</i>. 1817), was born at Southampton on 12 February 1776. His father was the master of King Edward's Grammar School, and afterwards rector of All Saints', Southampton; Mant was educated by his father and at Winchester College. He entered as a commoner at Trinity College, Oxford, in 1793, and in 1794 obtained a scholarship. In 1797 he graduated BA, and in 1798 was elected to a fellowship at Oriel, which he held until his marriage on 22 December 1804 to Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1846), daughter of William Wood or Woods of Chidham, Sussex. Mant's essay &#145;On commerce&#146; obtained the chancellor's prize in 1799. In 1800 he began his long series of poetical publications with verses in memory of his old master at Winchester, Joseph Warton. He graduated MA in 1801, was ordained deacon in 1802, and, after acting as curate to his father, took a travelling tutorship, and was detained in France in 1802&#150;3 during the war.<br>
<br>Having been ordained priest in 1803, Mant became curate in charge (1804) of Buriton, Hampshire. After acting as curate at Crawley, Hampshire (1808), and to his father at Southampton (December 1809), he became vicar of Coggeshall, Essex (1810), where he took pupils. In 1811 he was elected Bampton lecturer, and chose as his topic a vindication of the evangelical character of Anglican preaching against the allegations of Methodists. The lectures attracted notice. Charles Manners-Sutton, archbishop of Canterbury, made him his domestic chaplain in 1813, and on going to reside at Lambeth he resigned Coggeshall. In 1815 he was made rector of St Botolph without Bishopsgate and took a DD at Oxford. He was presented in 1818 to the rectory of East Horsley, Surrey, which he held with St Botolph's.<br>
<br>In February 1820 Mant, though lacking any previous Irish interest or connection, was nominated by Lord Liverpool for an Irish bishopric. He is said to have been first intended for Waterford and Lismore (though this was not vacant), but was ultimately appointed to Killaloe and Kilfenora, and was consecrated at Cashel on 30 April 1820. The Catholic south was not an easy post for a Church of Ireland cleric, and W. B. Mant's memoir of his father reports considerable turmoil during Mant's four years there. He voted against Roman Catholic emancipation in 1821, and again in 1825. On 22 March 1823 he was translated to the more congenial Ulster diocese of Down and Connor, succeeding Nathaniel Alexander who had been translated to Meath. There was no official residence connected with his diocese, and Mant made his home at Knocknagoney (Rabbit's Hill), in the parish of Holywood, co. Down, a few miles from Belfast. He had come from a diocese which was largely Roman Catholic to a stronghold of protestantism, mainly Presbyterian, and he succeeded in doing much for the prosperity of the then established church. Mant was on the royal commission of inquiry into ecclesiastical unions (1830); the publication of its report in July 1831 was followed by considerable efforts of church extension in his diocese. He found Belfast with two episcopal churches, and left it with five. He took an active part in connection with the Down and Connor Church Accommodation Society, formed (19 December 1838) at the suggestion of Thomas Drew, which between 1839 and 1843 laid out &pound;32,000 in aid of sixteen new churches. In 1842, on the death of James Saurin, bishop of Dromore, that diocese was united to Down and Connor, in accordance with the provisions of the <span class="roman">Church Temporalities Act</span> of 1833. The united diocese was a large one, being &#145;a sixteenth of all Ireland&#146;. The last bishop who had held the three sees conjointly was the seventeenth-century prelate Jeremy Taylor, to whose memory a marble monument, projected by Mant, and with an inscription from his pen, had been placed in 1827 in the cathedral church at Lisburn, co. Antrim.<br>
<br>Mant was an indefatigable writer; the bibliography of his publications occupied over five pages in the British Library catalogue. His poetry is chiefly notable for its copiousness. Many of his hymns were adapted from the Roman breviary, and four survive in <span class="italic">Hymns Ancient and Modern</span> at the end of the twentieth century. The annotated <span class="roman">Bible</span> (1814) prepared by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8012/', "George D'Oyly")</script> and Mant, at the instance of Archbishop Manners-Sutton, and at the expense of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, was largely a compilation but was influential in its time, upon the young W. E. Gladstone, among others. It was followed by an edition of the prayer book (1820), on a somewhat similar plan, by Mant alone.<br>
<br>Mant's most enduring work is his <span class="italic">History of the Church of Ireland from the Reformation to the Revolution</span> (2 vols., 1840). It was undertaken to provide as detailed a narrative of the Church of Ireland as James Seaton Reid provided in the first two volumes of his <span class="italic">History of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland</span> (1833&#150;7). No one was so well equipped for the task as Charles Richard Elrington, but on his withdrawing owing to ill health, Mant came forward. His style is readable, and his facts are usually well arranged, though his comments and general point of view are those of a committed partisan. The earlier church history of Ireland is ignored, and the period immediately preceding the Reformation is treated somewhat in the manner of a protestant pamphlet; but the real topic of the book, the post-Reformation annals of the Irish establishment to the Union, still stands, more than a hundred and fifty years later, as a useful, if biased, account.<br>
<br>Mant was taken ill on 27 October 1848 while staying at the rectory, Ballymoney, co. Antrim, and died there on 2 November 1848. He was buried on 7 November in the churchyard of St James's, Hillsborough, co. Down. He was survived by a daughter and two sons; the elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18002/', "Walter Bishop Mant")</script>, was his father's biographer.<br>
