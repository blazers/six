<span class="headword">Oliver,  Andrew</span>  (1706&#150;1774), <span class="occ">public servant and merchant in America</span>, was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on 28 March 1706, the son of Daniel Oliver (1663&#150;1732), merchant, and Elizabeth Belcher (1677&#150;1735). Oliver was born into one of the &eacute;lite colonial Boston families. After graduating from Harvard (AB 1724, MA 1727), Oliver entered his father's successful merchant firm, and was soon joined by his younger brother Peter. Andrew Oliver married Mary Fitch (1706&#150;1732) on 20 June 1728, receiving a substantial tract of land outside Boston as part of her dowry. She died four years later, leaving Oliver with their one surviving son, also named Andrew. On 19 December 1734 he remarried; his second wife was Mary Sanford (1712&#150;1773), also from an &eacute;lite Boston family, with whom he had fourteen children. He believed strongly that one of the principal duties of his station was to serve his country and community in a public capacity. He assumed his first post in 1737, as Boston's town auditor. This proved to be the beginning of a long and active career. Other positions for Boston included overseer of the poor, tax collector, justice of the peace, and town meeting moderator. He was equally active in the Congregationalist church. A lifetime member of the Old South Church in Boston, he was treasurer and later secretary of the Congregationalist missionary arm, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in New England and Adjacent Parts. After 1743 he was increasingly active in Massachusetts politics, serving first as a representative in the colony's house of representatives (1743&#150;6) and then as the province's executive secretary (1756&#150;71). The Oliver family was firmly interconnected with the Hutchinsons, another Boston &eacute;lite family. Thomas Hutchinson, governor of Massachusetts in 1771&#150;4, was the brother-in-law of Oliver's wife. His nephew was married to Hutchinson's daughter, and his own son was married to another of Hutchinson's daughters.<br>
<br>Together, the Hutchinson&#150;Oliver faction dominated late colonial Massachusetts politics. Thomas Hutchinson, appointed lieutenant-governor in 1758, helped to secure Andrew Oliver's position as secretary, and when Hutchinson became governor in 1771, he saw to it that Oliver was appointed lieutenant-governor and that Peter Oliver was made chief justice of the colony. The Hutchinson&#150;Oliver faction suffered substantially during Boston's road to revolution, with Andrew enduring the most. In 1765 he was appointed, without his knowledge, to the position of stamp distributor for the ill-fated <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> of 1765, which was a direct taxation by the British crown on its American subjects and is traditionally marked by historians as the opening of the Anglo-American rift. When riots broke out in Boston in response to the act, Oliver was the prime target. He was hanged in effigy on 14 August from Deacon Eliot's tree. That evening the protesters dismantled what was rumoured to be the new stamp office and burned Oliver's effigy in a bonfire, using his fence for kindling. Afterwards the more brazen members of the protesters descended on Oliver's house, vandalizing it and the garden. Oliver escaped unharmed, but publicly resigned his position as stamp distributor the following day. In 1773 Oliver and Hutchinson suffered a public humiliation when several of their letters, which expressed support for a number of parliament's unpopular colonial acts, were sent to the speaker of the Massachusetts house of representatives by Benjamin Franklin. The letters were first distributed privately and then given to the press. The popular outrage undermined any remaining authority of the Hutchinson&#150;Oliver faction. Andrew died from a stroke on 3 March 1774, which his family and friends blamed on the stress of the recent events. His funeral on 8 March was hounded by an abusive crowd, which shouted insults at the procession. His brother Peter did not attend for fear of his own safety. Thomas Hutchinson departed for London three months later, having been replaced by a military governor.<br>
