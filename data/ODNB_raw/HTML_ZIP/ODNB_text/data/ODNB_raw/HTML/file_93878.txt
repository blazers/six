</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clough,  Brian Howard</span>  (1935&#150;2004), <span class="occ">footballer and football manager</span>, was born on 21 March 1935 at 11 Valley Road, Middlesbrough, the sixth of the nine children of Joseph Clough and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hunter. His father worked as a sugar boiler in a local sweet factory and it was his mother who was the focus of family life. Brian was the only one of the eight surviving children to fail the eleven-plus. He went to Morton Grove secondary modern school, leaving without qualifications in 1950, and eventually took a job as a messenger boy, working for one of the local factories of the chemical manufacturer ICI. He had already shown some talent as a footballer and was soon playing for Great Broughton in the Cleveland league against men older and bigger than himself. It probably helped that four of his brothers were also team members. His goal scoring began to be noticed and he played a few games for Billingham Synthonia in the northern league towards the end of the 1952&#150;3 season, by which time he had already signed amateur forms for Middlesbrough. His first professional contract brought him a retainer of &pound;1 per week and &pound;7 if he played for any of the club's three teams. It is unlikely that he had many &pound;7 wage packets because between 1953 and 1955 he did national service in the RAF and was posted to Somerset. He was a regular member of his station side but was never chosen for an RAF team, whose selectors had many older and more experienced professionals from which to choose.<h2>
<a name="PlayingcareerMiddlesbroughandSunderland"></a>Playing career: Middlesbrough and Sunderland</h2>Back in Middlesbrough Clough made his d&eacute;but for the first team in the second division of the Football League but injuries and a lack of form restricted him to nine appearances, though these included his first three league goals. It was in the 1956&#150;7 season that he made his name, scoring thirty-eight goals in forty-one league games. The club's next highest scorer only managed ten. The following season Clough played forty league games and averaged a goal in each of them and in 1958&#150;9 he played in every league game, and scored forty-three goals. These were impressive figures by any standards and yet the team was often unconvincing and rarely looked like regaining its first division place. This led to some frustration among players and staff. Middlesbrough had made a profit of &pound;10,000 in 1957&#150;8 and &pound;30,000 was spent on new players for the following season but again there was no real challenge for promotion, and 1959&#150;60 saw an almost identical performance. Clough, who by now had been made captain, scored thirty-nine goals in his forty-one games but the team only finished fifth. In fact Middlesbrough scored enough goals but were conceding too many. Clough's criticism of his team mates, and especially the defence, led to nine of them submitting a complaint to the management that was leaked to press and public. Clough said he was not seeking a transfer to another club but then allowed a national newspaper to say that he was. In the event, he stayed and retained the captaincy but several players left the club. The unrest simmered through the summer when three players, including Clough, refused to re-sign for the 1960&#150;61 season. He went without summer wages for five weeks before eventually re-signing in August, but missed the first two games and lost the captaincy. None the less he still managed to score thirty-four goals in forty league games in that season.<br>
<br>In July 1961 Clough was finally transferred, to local rivals Sunderland, who had missed promotion to the first division by a point. On Boxing day 1962 he suffered a serious knee injury which caused him to miss the whole of the 1963&#150;4 season, in which Sunderland won promotion. Clough returned to play his only three games in the first division and to score one goal. At the age of twenty-nine he had to accept that he was never again going to be fit enough to play professional football.<br>
<br>An assessment of Clough the player is not easy. His record as a goal scorer cannot be ignored: in 274 league games he scored 251 goals and reached 250 goals in a shorter time than anybody else. But he did not do it against the best teams in the top division. Nor did he become a successful international player. He made three appearances for the England under-23 side, scoring one goal, and one appearance for England B (one goal). He played twice in ten days for the full England side in October 1959, in a draw with Wales in Cardiff and a defeat at home by Sweden. He was not selected for the 1958 world cup. It is said that he alienated Walter Winterbottom, the England manager, by singing his own praises while criticizing the play of rivals. It seems clear that he had a reputation for being abrasive and arrogant. This might have been managed if he had scored the goals for which he had been selected. When he failed, the conclusion that he was not quite good enough was easy to draw, though he was probably unlucky not to be in England's world cup party in 1958.<br>
<br>His playing career cut short by injury, it was not surprising that Clough became angry and depressed. On 4 April 1959 he had married Barbara Beatrice Glasgow (<i>b</i>. 1937/8), a 21-year-old shorthand typist and daughter of Henry Glasgow, clerical worker. He now had a young family to support and the compensation money would not keep them for long. He was young, frustrated, and found solace in drink. But he was not without drive and ability and when the former Middlesbrough player George Hardwick became Sunderland's new manager he suggested to Clough that he qualify as a Football Association coach and run the Sunderland youth team. It reached the semi-finals of the FA youth cup but when Hardwick left the club Clough was sacked. He had only been out of work for three months when in October 1965 he was appointed manager of the perennially struggling fourth division club, Hartlepools United. At the age of thirty he was the youngest manager in the English league.<h2>
<a name="Managementandfame19651974"></a>Management and fame, 1965&#150;1974</h2>This was new and difficult terrain for Clough, although he was not without ideas picked up from Alan Brown, his former manager at Sunderland. But what he really needed was a colleague who could share the burden and he realized that Peter Taylor was the man. Taylor had been the goalkeeper at Middlesbrough during Clough's goalscoring years. He had previously played at Coventry, where he had been influenced by their experienced manager Harry Storer, and Taylor and Clough had formed a close relationship at Middlesbrough. Taylor, six years older, admired Clough for his brashness and ability, and both liked to talk football. Taylor was certainly interested in management and was in charge of Burton Albion in the southern league when he was persuaded to join Clough at Hartlepools, taking a pay cut to move north. It seems that they seamlessly identified a division of labour between them, with Taylor responsible for the training and the search for new players while Clough concentrated on man management and public relations. He visited local working men's clubs to encourage support, persuaded a local brewer to sponsor the team, and even, it is said, painted the stands and drove the team bus. He also persuaded the club's board to replace an obstructive chairman. It was the first example of Clough as manager getting more attention than his players. At the end of the first Clough&#150;Taylor season Hartlepools finished eighteenth. The next season they were eighth and in 1967&#150;8 the club (renamed Hartlepool) was promoted to division three. But by then Clough and Taylor had moved to division two and taken over another team of under-achievers, Derby County.<br>
<br>At the end of the first season, as at Hartlepools, Derby finished eighteenth. The next year, 1968&#150;9, they won the championship and promotion to the first division, where they finished fourth, ninth, first, and seventh in the next four seasons. How was it done and why did it come to a sudden end during the 1973&#150;4 season? Clough had already persuaded the Derby board that Taylor must come with him and that money would be needed to improve the team. He apparently told the existing Derby players that they had three weeks to make an impression and changed the personnel both on and off the field, retaining only four of the first-team players. He brought in John O'Hare who had been in his Sunderland youth team and John McGovern who had been at Hartlepools, and signed such seasoned but still ambitious professionals as Alan Hinton and Willie Carlin. Clough also signed the young Roy McFarland, a centre-half, who would later play twenty-eight times for England, but his biggest coup was to persuade the Scottish international midfielder Dave Mackay to come from Tottenham Hotspur. Mackay was seemingly at the end of his career and about to return to the Edinburgh club Hearts. Clough wanted his skills and powers of leadership and persuaded him that he could change from midfield to a sweeper role in defence. The team that Clough and Taylor built won the second division championship in 1969 by seven points, losing only five games (and Mackay was voted joint footballer of the year). From the 1969&#150;70 to the 1972&#150;3 season Derby were serious competitors in the first division, yet in 1973, with a second new team under construction, Clough and Taylor resigned. Sporting journalists called it the biggest own goal of Clough's career.<br>
<br>Brian Clough could be charming but also rude and outspoken. Moreover, he was unpredictable, which was a further difficulty for anyone who had to cope with him. He had a low opinion of the directors of football clubs and expected them to underwrite what he wanted to do. In fact, he distrusted all authority except his own. These attitudes made him enemies in the boardroom. At first he seemed to have a good relationship with the Derby chairman, Sam Longson, whom he perhaps took for granted. He signed Colin Todd from Sunderland, for a British transfer record, while Longson was away on holiday. A joint FA and Football League commission found evidence of financial irregularities and fined the club as well as banning it from European competition for a year. Clough tried to buy from Nottingham Forest a player who had already signed for Manchester United, even parading him in front of the crowd at a Derby home match. But more seriously he became a media personality, not only putting his name to a weekly column in the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span> but by 1973 becoming a regular contributor on London Weekend Television's <span class="italic">On the Ball</span> and <span class="italic">The Big Match</span>. It was easy to see why journalists and broadcasters liked him. He could be informative and witty, was lively, always stimulating, and generous with his hospitality. The result was a string of regularly quoted comments and observations, ranging from relations with players (&#145;We talk about it for twenty minutes and then we decide I was right&#146;) and the importance of ball control (&#145;If God had wanted us to play football in the clouds, he'd have put grass up there&#146;) to his own performance (&#145;I wouldn't say I was the best manager in the business, but I was in the top one&#146;). Again, he amused many but alienated others. When Jimmy Hill left London Weekend to front BBC Television's <span class="italic">Match of the Day</span>, Clough was offered his job. He must have been tempted. He was spending so much time in London at weekends that the Derby board felt he was not giving enough to the job of management. He was asked to limit his television commitments and told that he must seek the prior approval of the board before he could appear. They also wanted to read his newspaper articles before publication. Both Clough and Taylor threatened to resign and then did so. Much to their surprise, on 15 October 1973 their resignations were accepted.<h2>
<a name="LeedsUnitedandNottinghamForest"></a>Leeds United and Nottingham Forest</h2>The decision to accept Clough and Taylor's departure was not unanimous and Clough used some of his supporters on the board to oppose it. He also rallied the Derby fans and before long a protest movement had begun with banners, marches, meetings, and petitions calling for reinstatement of the management team. The players, and even their wives, got involved, the players having tried but failed to persuade Dave Mackay not to take the vacant position. Eventually it was accepted that their charismatic manager was not going to return, though it is unclear when Clough also came to this conclusion. Initially he took a job at Brighton and Hove Albion while the furore over the resignation continued. Then in July 1974 he was offered, and accepted, the vacant managership of the most successful team in England, Leeds United. This was surprising because it was well known that Clough was antipathetic both to the architect of their success, Don Revie, who had left to become England manager, and the way that success had been achieved on the field. Barely a year before, the Leeds players had been given a suspended fine for their unruly behaviour on the pitch and Clough had attacked them in his <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span> column. Almost his first act at Leeds was to meet the players and tell them to throw away their medals because they had been won by cheating. He lasted only six league games and forty-four days at the club before he was sacked. He did, however, negotiate a very favourable financial settlement that provided long-term security.<br>
<br>In January 1975 Clough was appointed manager of Nottingham Forest, then an unfashionable second division club whose best days appeared to be behind them. But in only two full seasons Clough&#151;now reunited with Taylor&#151;produced a promotion winning side that then won the first division championship in their first season back in the top league (1977&#150;8). Clough thus emulated Herbert Chapman, the only other manager to win the first division title with two clubs. This feat was followed by an even more surprising one, two successive European cup victories in 1979 and 1980. It was done by a mixture of improving the players who were there when Clough arrived and some judicious operations in the transfer market, notably the signing of the England goalkeeper Peter Shilton and the central defenders Larry Lloyd and Kenny Burns, who was voted player of the year in the championship season by the Football Writers' Association. It was during this period that Clough was interviewed by the Football Association for the post of England manager. He was probably the people's choice, and certainly the press would have voted for him, but the combination of his powerful personality and erratic behaviour and a cautious FA meant that he was not offered the position.<br>
<br>Clough remained at Nottingham Forest for eighteen years and although they were never champions again they were runners up once, third three times, fifth twice, and only once outside the top ten; under his management there were also four league cup victories between 1978 and 1990. No one predicted Forest's relegation from what was now the premier league in 1993. The partnership with Peter Taylor, so vital to both careers, ended in 1982 when Taylor returned to Derby County and the rift that was caused was not repaired before Taylor's death in 1990. In this period Clough also saw his son Nigel become a successful member of the Forest side and an England international. Clough's teams played attractive, simple football. At his peak he was a shrewd manager of men who could be brutal&#151;there is a well-known story of him punching a player in the stomach&#151;but he did not rule by fear alone. Clough offered understandable solutions to players' on-the-field problems and he was especially adept at relaxing them before important matches. Perhaps he should have retired earlier. British football had long been known for its drinking culture and Clough became one of its victims. He could be brash, conceited, intolerant, and rude. On the other hand, he was the provider of many acts of kindness, both inside football and out, and once talked out of suicide a man he encountered on a bridge over the River Trent. He had a powerful personality full of contradiction, leaving many unsure as to what he would say or do next. This goes some way to explain his interest to writers such as Steven Lowe, author of the biographical play <span class="italic">The Spirit of the Man</span> (2006), and David Peace, whose novel <span class="italic">The Damned United</span> (2006) focuses on Clough's forty-four days at Leeds. Peace's novel was adapted for the cinema in 2009 with Michael Sheen in the title role.<br>
<br>In 1991 Clough was appointed OBE, and maintained that the letters stood for Old Big 'Ead, a self-appointed nickname that he enjoyed. Two years later he was given the freedom of the city of Nottingham, followed by that of Derby in 2003. Suffering from liver disease and given only several months to live, he underwent a liver transplant in January 2003. He died from stomach cancer on 20 September 2004 in Derby City General Hospital and was survived by his wife, two sons and one daughter. On 16 May 2007 a statue by Vivien Mallock was unveiled in Albert Park, Middlesbrough; in November of the following year Les Johnson's statue of Clough was unveiled in central Nottingham.<br>
