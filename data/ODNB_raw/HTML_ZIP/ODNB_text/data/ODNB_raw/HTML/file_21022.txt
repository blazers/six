<span class="headword">Owen,  Morgan</span>  (1584/5&#150;1645), <span class="occ">bishop of Llandaff</span>, was the third son of Owen Rees, clergyman, of Y Lasallt, in the parish of Myddfai, Carmarthenshire. His family claimed descent from the celebrated dynasty of physicians of Myddfai with legendary powers of healing acquired from a ghostly lady of Llyn Y Fan, a lake in the Black Mountains, and possessed extensive holdings of land inherited from various branches of the physicians' clan. Educated first at the grammar school in Carmarthen, Owen went subsequently to Jesus College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 16 December 1608, aged twenty-three. He became chaplain of New College, Oxford, from where he graduated BA on 6 July 1613, and proceeded MA in June 1616 from Hart Hall.<br>
<br>It is possible that Owen &#145;taught school&#146; in Carmarthen  (Yardley, 250). He was rector of Port Eynon, Gower, in 1619, and later of Shirenewton, Monmouthshire. From the status of a well-to-do parochial cleric he soon broke through to the ranks of the higher clergy. On 7 April 1620 he was collated to the second cursal prebend at St David's Cathedral, and on 26 July 1622 to the prebend of Cleddau; he became canon residentiary at St David's on the same day. He owed these rapid preferments to the interest taken in him by William Laud, his bishop, who was impressed by his &#145;zeal and piety&#146;. In 1624 he became deputy chancellor of Carmarthen, and two years later prebendary of Llanarthne in the same county.<br>
<br>Owen's career and that of Laud himself became closely linked. When Laud became chancellor of Oxford in 1630, in an election in which Jesus College fellows supported him against hostile Welsh interests elsewhere in the university, Owen could look forward to an enhanced status outside Wales, where he had resigned his position as prebendary of Llanarthne on taking the precentorship of Brecon and the prebend of Llanfynydd in July 1635. In 1636 he was awarded the degree of doctor of divinity when Charles I visited Oxford. Using his extensive landed wealth Owen enclosed the south yard of St Mary's Church at Oxford with a freestone wall, and in 1637 commissioned the building of a &#145;curious and beautiful porch&#146;  (Yardley, 250) leading from High Street to the church, at a cost of &pound;230 and adorned with a statue of the Virgin and child. It was said that he built the porch instead of giving a Latin sermon. When Laud later came to trial, his prosecutors cited Owen's conspicuous Oxford building as an example of one of the archbishop's projects. It was only a matter of time before such an active supporter of Laud was rewarded, and on 28 February 1640 the king recommended Owen for the bishopric of Llandaff. On 12 March he was elected bishop, and the appointment received the royal approval a week later. He was installed on 30 June, retaining the livings of Bedwas and Rudry, on the borders of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire <i>in commendam</i> with his bishopric. On 20 January 1641 the borough of Carmarthen recognized the achievement of its son by electing him to the common council; he was present to take the oath.<br>
<br>It was Owen's misfortune to reach this pinnacle just before the enemies of his great patron, Laud, began to close in on the archbishop and his allies. A little over six months after his installation, on 23 February 1641, Owen was named with bishops Richard Mountague and Roger Manwaring as objects of the attention of a committee of the House of Commons. Bills were to be drawn up against these three to deprive them of their sees and to prevent them holding any ecclesiastical office, but Owen seems to have been very much an afterthought of those framing the scope of the committee. The anti-episcopalian Sir Simonds D'Ewes does not even mention Owen in his diary entry for that day's work in the house. However, any hope he might have had that he might be regarded as small fry compared with these other Laudians would have evaporated by the spring of that year, as the promoters of the root and branch petition against episcopacy made advances in parliament. None the less, it was proposed in April to fine Owen &pound;1000&#151;less than the &pound;20,000 suggested for Laud, or even the &pound;5000 for Mountague.<br>
<br>The bishops were eventually impeached on 4 August, for promulgating the canons of 1640. By October 1641 Owen was imprisoned in the Tower of London, but was at large again by 31 December, when he, Archbishop John Williams of York, and nine other bishops used their seats in the Lords to protest against their treatment. According to Clarendon the other signatories were overborne by Williams. They asserted their ancient right to sit in the Lords, declared their abomination of popery, protested against threats to their safety by crowds, and demanded protection. The final part of their protest was a repudiation of all orders in the House of Lords since 27 December 1641 and all orders and votes to come, in their enforced absence. There could be no going back from this position, and the same day they were all sent to the Tower following their impeachment for high treason. Owen declined repeatedly to change his plea from not guilty when brought to the bar of the House of Lords to plead. On 6 April 1642 he was voted &pound;200 per annum subsistence by the House of Commons, and subsequently released on bail, then rearrested.<br>
<br>Owen was released in May 1642, and retired to Y Lasallt, as his episcopal estate and palace at Matharn, Monmouthshire, had been seized by partisans of parliament. There he renewed friendship with Rees Prichard, vicar of Llandovery and a former colleague among the cathedral clergy of St David's. Owen accompanied Prichard, no Arminian, but a strongly moralistic devotee of the Church of England in Wales, on his last visit to St David's, on 2 August 1643, and oversaw his will a year later.<br>
<br>In December 1644 Owen drew up his own will, leaving lands in nine Carmarthenshire parishes, and the tithes of two, with two Pembrokeshire rectories, to his nephews. He had no children from his marriage to Maud, widow of Edward Atkins of Carmarthen. He made further provision for the poor of Myddfai and the school at Carmarthen. Owen died on 5 March 1645 at Y Lasallt&#151;it was said that on hearing the news of Laud's execution he &#145;sunk down in his chair and dy'd soon after&#146;  (Willis, 70). He was buried in the chancel of Myddfai church, on the north side of the altar.<br>
