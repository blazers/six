<span class="headword">Whitelocke,  Edmund</span>  (1565&#150;1608), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was born on 10 February 1565, in the parish of St Gabriel Fenchurch Street, London, the son of a merchant, Richard Whitelocke (<i>c</i>.1533&#150;1570), and his wife, possibly named Joan (<i>c</i>.1528&#150;1607), daughter of John Colte and widow of another merchant, named Brockhurst, who had left her a &#145;competent estate&#146;. The eldest of four boys, the youngest being the future judge <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29299/', "Sir James Whitelocke (1570&#150;1632)")</script>, Edmund was aged five when his father died of pleurisy in Bordeaux. His mother preserved and invested the legacy left by his father for their sons' education, despite her third marriage, to another merchant, Thomas Price, &#145;a notable unthrift&#146;. Her sons learned Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, music, dancing, &#145;and to write fair&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liber famelicus</span>, 6). Edmund Whitelocke was sent to Merchant Taylors' School, then in 1581 to Christ's College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA. He was admitted about 1585 to Lincoln's Inn, where he &#145;spent his time among to[o] good cumpanions&#146;, and in 1587 &#145;betoke himself to travail into foreyne kingdoms &hellip; to redeem his mispent time&#146;, visiting numerous universities and learning languages  (<span class="italic">Liber famelicus</span>, 8). The governor of Provence made him captain of a troop of infantrymen stationed in Marseilles, then in Grenoble. Whitelocke failed to keep in touch with his family for nearly twelve years.<br>
<br>After his return to England, Whitelocke's wit and sophistication ensured that &#145;he grew into great goodliking of many Englishe noblemen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liber famelicus</span>, 8) and he spent the rest of his life at their expense, notably with Roger Manners, earl of Rutland, who frequently housed him. In 1601 he was arrested and charged with high treason for involvement in the earl of Essex's plot. His account of events was set out in a long letter dated 11 February sent to Robert Cecil, secretary of state. He claimed that on 8 February he had gone in search of Rutland, finding him with a party of gentlemen at Essex House, where &#145;he willed me to attend him &hellip; presuming, as the &hellip; rumour of the whole company was, that they went for the ending of some private quarrel, I went with him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 11.40&#150;1). Learning that this was not the case, Whitelocke abruptly left the conspirators and hid in the house of a &#145;citizen of good repute&#146;  (ibid.). In spite of this he was arrested, imprisoned, and charged, but as no evidence was found against him he was committed to the custody of his brother James and soon afterwards was discharged.<br>
<br>Whitelocke's next misadventure occurred as a result of his friendship with Henry Percy, ninth earl of Northumberland, whom he supported in a quarrel with Sir Francis Vere in 1602. On 4 November 1605, the eve of the Gunpowder Plot, Whitelocke chanced to dine at Syon House with Northumberland and the earl's distant cousin, Thomas Percy, &#145;the principal agent in that treason&#146;. Imprisoned once more, he was again released with no evidence against him. For the rest of his life he lived &#145;with most dependancye upon the erl&#146;, who awarded him &pound;40 per annum, later increased to &pound;60. He had permission to visit Northumberland, imprisoned in the Tower until 1621, &#145;and so passed his time in mirthe and good companye&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liber famelicus</span>, 9). At some point he also became the confidant of Robert Radcliffe, fifth earl of Sussex, and stayed in his house, New Hall, in Essex. In 1602 it was reported that the earl, who was living with one of the countess's former gentlewomen, &#145;hyres Capt Whitlocke, with monie and &hellip; suites&#146; to tell the Countess &#145;howe he buyes his wench a wastcote of 10&pound;, and puts hir in hir velvet gowne &hellip; It is conjectured that Capt Whitlocke &hellip; hath incited the E[arl] to followe this sensuall humour &hellip; as he did the E[arl] of Rutland&#146; and that as &#145;a shuttlecock&#146; he &#145;flyes up and downe from one nobleman to an other; good for nothing but to &hellip; help them to loose tyme&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of John Manningham</span>). Whitelocke died at New Hall from a stomach disorder about 24 August 1608 and was honoured by burial in the Sussex family vault at St Andrew's Church, Boreham, Essex, on 5 September. In a letter of 20 September Dudley Carleton wrote that &#145;capt. Whitlock, &hellip; is so lamented by all bo[o]n companions as yf the world had not bin worthy of him&#146;.<br>
