<span class="headword">Oldisworth,  Michael</span>  (<em>b. </em>1590/91, <em>d.</em> in or after 1659), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was baptized on 17 January 1591 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, the second son of Arnold Oldisworth (<i>b</i>. 1561) of Bradley in Gloucestershire and Lucy, daughter of Francis Barty of Antwerp. He matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford, on 21 November 1606, aged fifteen, and graduated BA from Magdalen College on 10 June 1611. Elected a fellow of Magdalen in the following year, he proceeded MA on 5 July 1614. A man of some literary ability, he was nominated in 1617 as one of eighty-four key people in Edmund Bolton's proposals for a national academy and was later praised as a most accomplished gentleman by Robert Herrick in <span class="italic">Hesperides</span>. Also in 1617 Oldisworth married Susan (<i>b</i>. 1599), daughter of Thomas Poyntz and his wife, Jane.<br>
<br>Oldisworth inherited a lasting interest in politics from his father, who had been MP for Tregony in 1593 and Cirencester in 1640, keeper of the hanaper in chancery, and receiver of fines in king's bench. After leaving university he was appointed secretary to William Herbert, third earl of Pembroke, who was both chancellor of Oxford University and lord chamberlain. Pembroke used his influence to secure Oldisworth's election as MP for Old Sarum in Wiltshire in 1624, 1625, 1626, and 1628. Representing a pocket or nomination borough such as Old Sarum meant that Oldisworth owed no allegiance other than that demanded by his patron. He was one of a number of &#145;gentleman-servants&#146; in the Commons  (<span class="italic">VCH Wiltshire</span>, 5.119), whose status would not normally have secured for them a seat but who now became members of personal factions.<br>
<br>After the third earl's death in 1630 Oldisworth was eventually appointed, in 1637, as secretary to the fourth earl of Pembroke (brother of the third earl and his successor as lord chamberlain). In 1640 Pembroke succeeded, with the support of the puritan majority on the corporation, in securing the election of Oldisworth for the borough of Salisbury in both the Short and the Long parliaments. Apart from his patron's interests, Oldisworth had no personal connection with Wiltshire, but he generously repaid them for their promotion of his political career. He largely organized the Pembrokes' electoral influence in the county, which the third earl had systematically built up between 1612 and 1630, particularly in Wilton, Downton, and Old Sarum. He managed their patronage and operated as their agent in the Commons, where they had a personal following of about twelve members. In 1639 he supported the fourth earl, who was captain-general of the king's bodyguard, as an officer of the army in the north. Oldisworth also benefited personally from the Herbert influence at court. In 1629 he was granted leases on royal land, including a manor in Kent for which he paid &pound;1200, and in 1639 he was granted income from the western stannaries.<br>
<br>In politics Oldisworth identified with the parliamentarian party, became a friend of Sir John Eliot, and when civil war broke out in 1642 contributed one horse and &pound;30 for the defence of the country. On 5 July 1644 he was a witness at the trial of William Laud, accusing the archbishop of attempting to deprive the current Lord Pembroke of his right, as lord chamberlain, to appoint royal chaplains. At the time, Oldisworth was attributed with credit for securing Pembroke's allegiance to the parliamentarian cause. According to Anthony Wood, &#145;Tho' in the grand rebellion he was no colonel, yet he was governor of old Pembroke and Montgomery, led him by the nose (as he pleased) to serve both their turns&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span> 2.356). Contemporary satirists published pamphlets, often with the pretence that they were written by Oldisworth himself, ridiculing Pembroke's vulgar tastes and his total dependence on Oldisworth. In one of these the latter was described as &#145;Pembrochian Oldisworth that made the Earl, his master's, wise speeches&#146;  (<span class="italic">England's Confusion</span>, 1659, 10).<br>
<br>After the end of the second civil war, Oldisworth became frustrated by parliament's continued negotiations with the king and therefore made few appearances in the Commons during 1648. When, however, matters were brought to a head by the army's intervention and the decision to bring the king to trial, he became an active revolutionary. On 20 December 1648 he registered his dissent to the vote of 5 December that called for further negotiations with the king. His zeal is confirmed by the fact that he was listed, shortly after Pride's Purge, as being one of the radical ultras in the Commons. One of only eight out of twenty-six active Wiltshire MPs who were allowed to remain as members, he served the Rump loyally and, as a pious puritan, became a keen member of its various committees on religious reform, favouring a presbyterian settlement. Although Pembroke died in 1650, his role as Oldisworth's patron had already been taken over by the new government in recognition of his service to the state. In July 1649 Oldisworth was given a lucrative appointment as one of two masters of the prerogative office (renewed by the council of state in 1653); in 1650 he succeeded Pembroke as keeper of Windsor Great Park; and in 1651 he was appointed commissioner to investigate a rising in south Wales. He was still a member of the Rump when it was expelled by Cromwell in April 1653. Although he did not serve in the protectorate parliaments, he resumed his seat for Salisbury when the Rump was restored in May 1659.<br>
<br>Oldisworth's successful political career had almost entirely been dependent on the patronage of the Herberts and his own opportunism. Although it is estimated that he would still have been classed as a member of the lesser gentry in 1649, with an income of under &pound;500 a year, his later appointments would have secured for him a comfortable standard of living. His exact date of death is unknown.<br>
