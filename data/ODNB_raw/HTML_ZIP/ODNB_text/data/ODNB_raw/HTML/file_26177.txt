<span class="headword">Sprigg <span class="st"> [Sprigge]</span>,  Joshua</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1618, <em>d.</em> 1684), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was baptized at Banbury, Oxfordshire, on 19 April 1618, the eldest surviving son of William Sprigg or Sprigge (<i>fl</i>. 1618&#150;1652) and his wife, Rebecca. His father had been servant to William Fiennes, Lord Saye and Sele, and was later steward of New College, Oxford. Sprigg matriculated at New Inn Hall, Oxford, in 1634 but did not proceed to any degree and went to Edinburgh University, where he graduated MA in 1639. He then returned to England to become a preacher at St Mary Aldermary, London, and after taking the solemn league and covenant was made rector of St Pancras, Soper Lane.<br>
<br>During the early 1640s Sprigg was an active preacher and religious controversialist. Besides his close connection, through his father, with Saye he seems to have enjoyed the patronage of Lady Willoughby of Parham, to whom he dedicated his sermon on the <span class="roman">Song of Songs</span>. In most of his preaching he stuck to purely religious themes, disclosing himself as an advanced Calvinist of millenarian tendencies, stressing human sinfulness and the centrality of Christ, whose second coming he interpreted alternatively as an inward experience of each individual and as a literal event in &#145;these last dayes&#146; when Christ and man would be &#145;returned into a unity of Concord and agreement&#146;  (Sprigge, <span class="italic">Christus redivivus</span>, 59, 27). A strong advocate of religious toleration, he was almost certainly the author of <span class="italic">The ancient bounds, or, Liberty of conscience, tenderly stated, modestly asserted, and mildly vindicated</span> (1645). In his early sermons Sprigg revealed his animosity to the bishops, rejoicing that they had been &#145;made Cyphers, instead of making the Parliament so&#146;  (Sprigge, <span class="italic">Solace for Saints</span>, 28). He also deplored the quarrels over church government that had rocked the Westminster assembly of divines: &#145;And now is all that truth we expected come to a new forme of government, whether Presbyteriall or Congregational? &hellip; Is this the shaking of heaven and earth, to shake men out of an Episcopal prelacy into a Presbyteriall?&#146;  (Sprigge, <span class="italic">A Testimony to an Approaching Glory</span>, sig. B5<i>r</i>). In 1648 and 1649, because &#145;The world hath been witnesse of many hard speeches against me&#146;, including the accusation that he denied the divinity of Christ, he decided to publish collections of his sermons so that the world could judge for itself.<br>
<br>One cause of Sprigg's unpopularity in London was undoubtedly his outspoken advocacy of Sir Thomas Fairfax's New Model Army at a time when the City fathers, inspired by Thomas Edwards and other presbyterian clergy, were denouncing it as a breeding-ground of sectarian heresy. He had been hired by Fairfax to be a chaplain and member of the secretariat of the new army. In this capacity he accompanied it on its travels, and wrote a number of dispatches. At the beginning of 1647 he published <span class="italic">Anglia rediviva</span>, a day-by-day account of the army's successes during the first fifteen months of its existence. In it he provided an unabashedly providential interpretation of the New Model's unbroken string of victories. Whether it was the miraculous draught of fishes near Dartmouth, or the cannon ball that snapped the chain of the drawbridge at Tiverton, or the escape of General Fairfax from a shower of timber, stones, and sheets of lead after the terrible explosion at Torrington, &#145;you will easily discern a thread of divinity running through the whole proceeding of this army&#146;, he wrote in the epistle dedicatory; &#145;their actions have been nothing else but a copy of the wisdom, power, providence and love of God put forth in men&#146;  (Sprigge, <span class="italic">Anglia rediviva</span>, sig. A3<i>v</i>). Mindful of his obligations to his patron Saye, Sprigg also was careful to weave into his account a lengthy justification of Saye's son, Nathaniel Fiennes, who had been court-martialled for his surrender of Bristol in 1643. The apology for Fiennes was so comprehensive that it prompted Clement Walker to refer sardonically to the author as &#145;Sprigg alias Nathaniel Fines in his legend or romance of this army&#146;  (Walker, 1.32). Although the book relies heavily on the pamphlets and newsbooks of the period it is occasionally enlivened by Sprigg's eyewitness accounts, and the whole is shot through with his overarching vision of the New Model Army's providential role in the war against the king. The book was not a commercial success. Four months after its publication the army secretariat paid the publisher John Partridge &pound;150 &#145;for the losses hee sustayn'd by <span class="roman">Anglia Rediviva</span>&#146;  (Thoresby Society, MS SD ix, unfoliated). In 1648 Sprigg was constituted a fellow of All Souls, Oxford, and the following year he was incorporated MA. At All Souls he exercised his zeal by having a stone carving of Christ's ascension over the college gate defaced. He remained a fellow of the college until 1669.<br>
<br>In December 1648 Sprigg intervened in the debate in the council of officers at Whitehall over the adoption of the Leveller-inspired <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span>. While he approved the effort to &#145;promote the spirituall liberties of the saints&#146; by restraining the power of the magistrate over religion, he thought that devising a constitution for England at that moment was a waste of time; they ought rather to wait upon God who was about to &#145;bringe forth a New Heaven and a New Earth&#146;  (Firth, 2.85, 87).<br>
<br>A few weeks later Sprigg incurred the displeasure of the army high command by his forthright opposition to the execution of the king. On Sunday 21 January 1649 he preached to the members of the court of high commission on the text &#145;He that sheds blood, by man shall his blood be shed&#146;. Speaking after him in support of the king's execution, Hugh Peters &#145;made amends&#146; for the disturbing questions raised by Sprigg  (<span class="italic">The Moderate</span>, 16&#150;23 Jan 1649, 271). Sprigg did not give up. Barely three days before Charles went to the scaffold he wrote that &#145;the end of the Lord's judging is purifying not destroying&#146;; &#145;To execute the King for what he did in prosecution of the War &hellip; is to shed the blood of War in Peace&#146;  (<span class="italic">Certaine Weighty Considerations</span>, 1649, sigs. B1<i>r</i>, B2<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>After his failure to avert the regicide Sprigg was next heard of in 1654, when he was one of the signatories to a laudatory epistle written to accompany <span class="italic">The Judgement Set, and the Bookes Opened</span>, a collection of sermons by John Webster, alongside John Cardell, chaplain of All Hallows, Lombard Street. This and the printing of the book by the radical printer Rapha Harford might suggest that Sprigg was at this point involved in a radical Independent congergation following a mystical religious interpretation of contemporary events. His only other known intervention in public life came on 23 December 1656 when he spoke on behalf of thirty petitioners, asking parliament to reduce the punishment of the Quaker James Nayler, who had been convicted for blasphemously imitating Christ's entry into Jerusalem. He exhorted the MPs to &#145;leave him to Gospel remedies, as the proper way to reclaim&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Burton</span>, 1.217).<br>
<br>After the Restoration, Sprigg retired to an estate that he had bought at Crayford in Kent. With the death of James Fiennes, Lord Saye and Sele, in 1673 he married in 1675 that nobleman's widow, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1684), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4975/', "Edward Cecil, Viscount Wimbledon")</script>. They had no children, and kept conventicles in their house. Perhaps owing to local hostility they moved to Highgate near London, where Sprigg died in June 1684, with his wife following him that same month. He was buried in Crayford church. His will showed him to be a man of substance, owning a coach and horses and land in both Crayford and Middle Norton, the latter bought with his wife's dowry of &pound;2000. He distributed &pound;100 to &#145;poore Christians&#146; and &pound;500 to endow a workhouse in his native Banbury  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/376, fol. 262<i>v</i>). He directed that upon his wife's death his remaining estate should descend to his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26178/', "William Sprigg")</script>, a political writer.<br>
