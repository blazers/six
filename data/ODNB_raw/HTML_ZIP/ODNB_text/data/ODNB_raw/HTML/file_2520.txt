<span class="headword">Blacker,  Valentine</span>  (1778&#150;1826), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company and cartographer</span>, was born on 19 October 1778, the fourth son of St John Blacker (<i>b</i>. 1743), rector of Moira, co. Down, and his first wife, Grace, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Close (<i>d</i>. 1798). He obtained his commission in the Madras cavalry in 1798, and served as a cornet in the Mysore campaign of 1799, with a troop of cavalry of the nizam's contingent. A year later he was employed in Wainad as aide-de-camp to Colonel Stevenson, and subsequently served with his regiment in the southern provinces of the Madras presidency under Colonel Agnew, by whom he was thanked in dispatches for having surprised a party of the enemy and for a successful charge with the troop of cavalry under his command. In 1803 he was appointed to the quartermaster-general's department and served as captain of guides in the Maratha campaign of 1803&#150;5. He compiled maps of part of the Chittoor district, the country between Seringapatam and Coimbatore, and the coast from Anjendo.<br>
<br>In April 1810 Blacker was appointed quartermaster-general of the Madras army, a position which he held until 1819, and was particularly concerned with mapping and surveying. He married in Madras, on 22 December 1813, Emma, daughter of Robert Johnson of Liverpool, with whom he had three sons. In 1815 he served with the army of reserve under Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Hislop, and in 1817 under him with the army of the Deccan at the battle of Mehidpur and the other operations in the Deccan. His services at Mehidpur and the reconnaissances made by him before the battle were specially brought to the notice of the governor-general. He was made CB in 1818. He obtained the permission of the government to publish an account of the Maratha war, <span class="italic">Memoir of the operations of the British army in India during the Mahratta War of 1817, 1818, 1819</span> (1821), for which he prepared maps of central India.<br>
<br>Blacker returned to Europe in 1821 on medical grounds, and recuperated in the Mediterranean. In 1821 he was thanked in general orders by the commander-in-chief of the Madras army for his eminent and scientific services as quartermaster-general of the army of Fort St George during a period of ten years. Late in 1822 the directors of the East India Company appointed him surveyor-general of India in succession to John Hodgson. Leaving England in June 1823 he arrived in Calcutta to take up his post, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, in October 1823. He was strongly in favour of the great trigonometrical survey as the foundation for the mapping of India, as against quicker and less expensive expedients. He was elected a member of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, to which he read papers on barometers and hygrometers, the boundaries of India, and the military geography of central Asia. He suffered long periods of ill health while in Calcutta, and died there of fever on 4 March 1826. He was buried in the South Park Street cemetery, Calcutta.<br>
