<span class="headword">Love,  John</span>  (1757&#150;1825), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born at Paisley on 15 June 1757, the son of James Love of Paisley and his wife, Margaret Lang. He was educated at Paisley grammar school and, aged ten, entered the University of Glasgow, where he received a bursary for his excellent performance in Latin, Greek, and mathematics. On 24 December 1778 he was licensed by the presbytery of Paisley and was assistant in the parishes of Rutherglen and Greenock before being ordained to the Hoxton Presbyterian congregation at Artillery Street, Bishopsgate, London, on 22 August 1788.<br>
<br>During his residence in London, Love was active in moves to promote the foreign missions movement and, in January 1795, published on this subject in the <span class="italic">Evangelical Magazine</span>. Along with Alexander Waugh and David Bogue he was a co-founder of the London Missionary Society (LMS) at Aldersgate Street in September of that year [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42118', "Founders of the London Missionary Society")</script>]. Thereafter he served as the society's secretary for five years and, on his return to Glasgow in 1800, he performed the same role for the Glasgow Missionary Society. Love was especially interested in missions to the south Pacific and in 1796 published his <span class="italic">Addresses to the People of Otaheite</span> which provided the Tahitians with a highly personal &#145;system of Christian theology&#146;  (Morison, 261). The Church of Scotland's first important missionary station in Africa, at Kaffaria (established in 1830), was named Lovedale in his honour.<br>
<br>Despite the success of the LMS and his reputation as a dignified and well-respected preacher, Love felt increasingly dissatisfied with his London ministry. He returned to Scotland after twelve years to become minister of the Anderston chapel of ease in Barony parish, Glasgow, where he was inducted on 11 July 1800. In 1815 he was a candidate for the chair of divinity at Aberdeen University and, though unsuccessful, he was awarded the degree of DD at Marischal College in the following year. Love remained at Anderston until his death at his manse in Clyde Street, Glasgow, on 17 December 1825. He was survived for several years by his wife, further details of whom are unknown.<br>
<br>In addition to his <span class="italic">Addresses</span>, during his lifetime Love published a collection of <span class="italic">Nine Occasional Sermons</span> (1788) and several additional sermons, including <span class="italic">Benevolence Inspired and Exalted in the Presence of Jesus Christ</span> (1794). After his death there appeared his <span class="italic">Discourses on Select Passages of Scripture</span> (1838), <span class="italic">Letters of the Late John Love, DD</span> (1838 and 1840), and, best-known, his <span class="italic">Memorials</span> (1857&#150;8) which were praised as models of forthright evangelical devotion. According to the ecclesiastical historian John Macleod it was once said in criticism that his written works were only skeletons, to which came the reply that, if so, they were the bones of a mammoth.<br>
