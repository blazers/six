<span class="headword">Martin,  Claude</span>  (1735&#150;1800), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company and philanthropist</span>, was born in the rue de la Palme, Lyons, France, on 4 January 1735, son of Fleury Martin (1708&#150;1755), vinegar maker, and his wife, Anne Vaginay (1702&#150;1735), butcher's daughter. At his parish school he excelled in mathematics and physics. Although apprenticed in 1749 to a local silk weaver, Martin chose to seek his fortune abroad and signed up for the army of the French Compagnie des Indes in 1751. He arrived in Pondicherry as a &#145;common soldier&#146; and rose to become bodyguard to Comte de Lally, commander-in-chief in 1758. But French influence in India was waning, and on 9 May 1760 Martin, in a pragmatic move, deserted to the British East India Company's army. In August 1761, while escorting other French deserters to augment British troops at Calcutta, his ship, the <i>Fateh-i-Islam</i> sank off the Coromandel coast. Martin was among the few survivors who eventually reached Calcutta on foot.<br>
<br>Commissioned ensign in 1763, Martin was promoted lieutenant in the following year, after refusing to join a body of soldiers intent on deserting. But his rapid rise received a check when he sided against the commander-in-chief, Lord Clive, during the &#145;white mutiny&#146; of 1766. Officers, including Martin, who had protested about the reduction in field allowances, faced deportation from India. It was Martin's skills as a surveyor and map maker that saved him, and for the next seven years he worked in north-east India with the company's geographer James Rennell, contributing to the resulting <span class="roman">Bengal Atlas</span>. As a soldier, he took part in punitive raids into Bhutan, looting temples of books, pictures, relics, and wooden statues, which formed the basis of his own extraordinary collection of antiquities and curiosities.<br>
<br>Martin had already visited Oudh, the north Indian state which, under its rulers, the nawabs, had loosened itself from the Mughal empire. In 1775 he got himself appointed as superintendent of the nawab's arsenal in the new capital, Lucknow. He was adept at finding influential people who could promote his career, aided by flattery and gifts. In this case he solicited the help of John Bristow, the corrupt resident to the Lucknow court, who in turn went to his patron, Philip Francis, the most powerful man in British India after the governor-general, Warren Hastings. It was probably now that Martin became a freemason, allowing him to move with confidence among fellow masons occupying the highest East India Company positions. Lucknow became his permanent home, and in 1781 he completed his first house, strongly fortified and moated, on the Gumti River. During the summer he lived underground, in basements built into the river bank, moving up as the river rose during the annual monsoon. When it fell, the basements were cleared of silt for the next summer's occupation. In the rooms above, Martin established &#145;a perfect Musaeum&#146; that reflected the enquiring mind of an eighteenth-century Enlightenment man. He collected natural curiosities, and commissioned paintings of birds and flowers from Indian artists. He possessed works by the Daniells, William Hodges, Johann Zoffany, and Francesco Renaldi, and appears in paintings by the last two. He bought telescopes from the astronomer royal, William Herschel, and steam engines from the Birmingham factory of Matthew Boulton and James Watt, which he used for raising water. His library contained nearly 1000 volumes, showing his scientific, architectural, botanical, and antiquarian interests, with some erotica. He never married but kept several young Indian women, including his favourite mistress, Boulone (<i>c</i>.1766&#150;1844), whom he had bought when she was nine years old.<br>
<br>Never afraid of experimentation, in 1782 Martin successfully operated on himself for bladderstones, using an unorthodox form of lithotriptor, details of which he sent to the Company of Surgeons in London. In 1785 he built and flew the first hot air balloons in India, to the astonishment of the nawab, Asaf ud-Daula. In the arsenal he cast bells and cannon, and made fine pistols. Martin's huge fortune, which made him the richest European in eighteenth-century India, was accumulated in various ways. He owned and rented property, some of which he designed and had built himself. He traded successfully in indigo and cloth, exporting it to Europe in exchange for Spanish dollars. He lent money at 12 per cent (the company rate of interest), the largest loan being &pound;250,000 to the nawab in 1794, which he retrieved with difficulty. He also sold European artefacts to the nawab at highly inflated prices, though his influence at the Lucknow court has been overrated.<br>
<br>Although retired from military duty, he volunteered to accompany Lord Cornwallis as aide-de-camp at Seringapatam, during the Third Anglo-Mysore War of 1792. His last active service was leading the nawab's army, under General Sir Robert Abercromby, against the Rohillas in 1794; he was rewarded with the rank of major-general. In the following year he began building his extraordinary palace-tomb of Constantia, south-east of Lucknow, the largest European funerary monument in India. A baroque folly, it incorporates fantastic statuary, ingenious water-cooled air-conditioning, and locally produced &#145;Wedgwood&#146; decorations. News of the French Revolution influenced Martin's decision to remain in India, and he lavished money on the building. His permanent memorials are the schools he endowed, at Lucknow, Calcutta, and Lyons, each called La Martini&egrave;re, and each of which celebrates as founder's day, the anniversary of his death, which occurred on 13 September 1800 at the Town House, Lucknow. His small charitable bequests are still distributed regularly to the poor at Constantia on the outskirts of Lucknow.<br>
