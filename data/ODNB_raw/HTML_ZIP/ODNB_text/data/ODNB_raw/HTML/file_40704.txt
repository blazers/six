<span class="headword">Rickword,  (John) Edgell</span>  (1898&#150;1982), <span class="occ">poet and book reviewer</span>, was born on 22 October 1898 at 28 Head Street, Colchester, the fifth and last child of George Rickword, borough librarian, and his wife, Mabel Thomas (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Prosser). From dame-school Rickword went to Colchester Royal Grammar School in 1908 and joined the Artists' Rifles in 1916, the earliest time at which he could have enlisted. Rickword was on active service in France for most of the last two years of the First World War and was awarded the Military Cross &#145;for conspicuous gallantry and initiative&#146;. In the months after the armistice, he developed septicaemia which led to the removal of his left eye. Invalided out of the army, Rickword went up to Pembroke College, Oxford, in October 1919 to read modern languages, but left the next year without taking his degree. He became a contributor to the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span> and the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> and on 25 October 1920 married Margaret (Peggy) McGrath, daughter of John McGrath, farmer; their daughter had been born the previous month. Rickword's early married life, living in a succession of London flats and then in Chipstead, Surrey, was happy and productive. A second daughter was born in March 1922.<br>
<br>Rickword had been writing poetry since his mid-teens and published his first collection, <span class="italic">Behind the Eyes</span>, in 1921. His work as a literary journalist earned him recognition as an astute early interpreter of modernist poetry (see his anonymous review in the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> of T. S. Eliot's <span class="italic">The Waste Land</span>). In 1923 he was contracted to write a biography of Arthur Rimbaud, whose poetry (of which Rickword made notable translations) had been highly influential on his own. By the time the Rimbaud book was published in 1924, Rickword had suffered a personal calamity when his wife had a nervous breakdown and the family broke up, Peggy going into a mental hospital and their daughters into foster homes.<br>
<br>Rickword moved into a flat in London with Bertram Higgins, together with whom and Douglas Garman he became founder of the short-lived but influential <span class="italic">Calendar of Modern Letters</span> (1925&#150;7), &#145;a sort of discontented club&#146; as Rickword himself described it many years later, &#145;discontented with all the established novelists and the literary cliques&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poetry Nation</span>, 78). Among the writers they published were D. H. Lawrence, Luigi Pirandello, Isaac Babel, Liam O'Flaherty, and the poets Robert Graves, John Crowe Ransom, Allen Tate, and Hart Crane. He also edited two volumes of <span class="italic">Scrutinies</span> in this period (1928, 1931) and published two more volumes of poetry, <span class="italic">Invocations to Angels</span> (1928) and <span class="italic">Twittingpan</span> (1931), before he all but gave up the writing of verse. The abrupt end to his career as a poet has been attributed to his communist beliefs (Rickword joined the Communist Party in 1934), though Rickword himself explained it differently: &#145;I simply wasn't in a mind to write poems&#146;  (J. Lucas, <span class="italic">The 1930s: a Challenge to Orthodoxy</span>, 1978, 9&#150;10).<br>
<br>In the 1930s and 1940s Rickword's energies were focused on political activism, as a founder and editor of <span class="italic">Left Review</span> (1934&#150;8) and one of its successors, <span class="italic">Our Time</span> (1941&#150;9). He was instrumental in the formation of the Left Book Club and the British section of the Writers' International, whom he represented as part of a delegation to the 1937 conference in Madrid during the Spanish Civil War. Described as &#145;one of the few really outstanding critical intelligences on the far Left&#146;  (R. Giddings, <span class="italic">Tribune</span>, 5 Jan 1979, 6), he was an inheritor of the English radical tradition of Marvell, Milton, Swift, and Hazlitt, all of whom he wrote about in publications ranging from the <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span> to the <span class="italic">Penguin Guide to English Literature</span>. As a poet he reacted strongly against the insipidity he perceived in the work of his contemporaries and strove to develop an aesthetic of &#145;negative emotions&#146; deriving his use of form and symbol from the poets he specially admired, the French symbolists and English metaphysical poets&#151;he was called by Herbert Palmer &#145;the only complete and satisfactory English symbolist&#146;  (H. Palmer, <span class="italic">Post-Victorian Poetry</span>, 1938, 256&#150;8). In these tastes, and in his outstanding ability as an essayist and editor, he had more in common with Eliot than any other of his contemporaries. Rickword's poetry is trenchant, skilful, and encompasses a wide range of styles, from powerful satire to unusual and lyrical love poems. In metre and diction, as well as politically, he prefigured the Auden generation of poets, but unlike them wrote in an atmosphere of self-determined isolation. His absence from print hindered general recognition of his poetry, and the pared down <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> that appeared in 1947 was not very well received. Rickword retired into a career as a bookseller, in Kent and later in London, with his second wife, Doris Russell (Jonny) Back (1899&#150;1964) (they married on 24 July 1944 following Peggy's death in June that year), with whom he had been living since 1934; an artist and dressmaker, she was formerly the wife of Gilbert Back and was the daughter of Frederick Russell Quilter, civil engineer.<br>
<br>Rickword stuck to his Marxist principles, but left the Communist Party quietly after the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. He was manager of Collet's bookshop in Hampstead from 1954. Jonny's health deteriorated after 1960 and she died in 1964 from a brain haemorrhage; a year later Rickword went to live with Beatrix Hammarling at 2 Hopping Lane, Islington, his home for the remaining seventeen years of his life. His sight, which had been weak for years, was lost completely by 1976. A revival of interest in his work began in the late 1960s with the republication of his <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> and of <span class="italic">Left Review</span>; these were followed by his <span class="italic">Essays and Opinions</span> (1974), <span class="italic">Selected Poems and Translations</span> (1976) and collected prose, <span class="italic">Literature in Society</span> (1978).<br>
<br>Edgell Rickword died from carcinoma with obstructive jaundice on 15 March 1982 at the Whittington Hospital, Islington, London.<br>
