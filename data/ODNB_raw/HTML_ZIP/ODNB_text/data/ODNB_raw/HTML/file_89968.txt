<span class="headword">D'Abo <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Maude]</span>,  Jennifer Mary Victoria</span>  (1945&#150;2003), <span class="occ">businesswoman</span>, was born on 14 August 1945 at the London Clinic, 20 Devonshire Place, London, the elder of the two daughters of Michael William Vernon Maude, later Hammond-Maude (<i>d</i>. 1995), diplomat and land agent, of 11 North Terrace, Kensington, London, and his wife, (Jacqueline) Rosamond Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Patrick (<i>d</i>. 1963). The family moved around as her father pursued his career in Brussels and Egypt, and after her mother became an invalid she was largely brought up by her grandmother and her nanny. She attended nine schools, before leaving Hatherop Castle, Gloucestershire, in 1961, with five GCE passes at O-level. After a finishing school in Paris, on 14 December 1965 she married an officer in the Life Guards, Captain David Gwynn Morgan-Jones (<i>b</i>. 1937), son of Gwynn Morgan-Jones, a lieutenant-colonel in the Life Guards. They had one daughter, Sophy. With few educational qualifications, a typical situation for an upper-class young woman at the time, she took a job working as a secretary for <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/97721/', "Peter Egbert Cadbury (1918&#150;2006)")</script>, son of Sir Egbert Cadbury, chocolate manufacturer. Peter Cadbury was chairman and managing director of the Keith Prowse theatrical ticket agency, and executive chairman of Westward Television Ltd. She divorced her husband in 1970 in order to marry Cadbury, which she did on 15 April the same year; they had one son, Joel, who became a London restaurateur and club owner. Deciding that she had more financial expertise than her husband, a skill learned from her grandmother, she took over the running of his investment portfolio, greatly increased its value, and sold all the shares shortly before the crash of 1974, but to her annoyance she was barred from membership of the London stock exchange because she was a woman. This marriage also ended in divorce, and on 30 January 1976 she married Robin Gerard d'Abo (<i>b</i>. 1939/40), a stockbroker, and son of Robert Erlaud Nicholi d'Abo, also a stockbroker. There were no children of this marriage, which ended in divorce in 1987.<br>
<br>D'Abo made her first venture into the business world in 1976 when she took over the franchise of a Wavy Line grocer's shop in Alton, Hampshire. After this proved a success, in 1977 she bought a rundown department store in Basingstoke with the help of a bank loan of &pound;&frac12; million: naming it Burlington's Furniture Company, she modelled it on the Peter Jones store in Chelsea and sold it for a &pound;1 million profit to the Perrings furniture group in 1980. Her next business venture was the Jean Sorelle perfume and toiletry manufacturer in Peterborough, which she bought in 1980 when the toymaker Dunbee-Combex-Marx, which controlled it, went into receivership: she sold the business in 1983.<br>
<br>D'Abo's most successful venture, and the one that brought her to the attention of the public, was the acquisition of the Rymans chain of office stationery shops, which she bought in 1981 from Ralph Halpern, chairman of the Burton Group. Rymans, founded in 1893 and part of the Burton Group since 1960, had become unprofitable by the end of the 1970s, and was losing nearly &pound;2 million a year. Jennifer d'Abo raised &pound;2 million in the City with which to buy the chain and after two more years of losses turned it into a flourishing concern, with profits of over &pound;&frac12; million in 1985. Her ranges of bright red, green, and yellow files, waste paper baskets, and filing cabinets transformed drab office buildings, and she was responsible for the introduction of brightly coloured self-adhesive post-it notes, which she had discovered (available at that time only in white) at the Frankfurt trade fair. She remained chairman of Ryman Ltd until it was sold to the Pentos bookshop chain for over &pound;20 million in 1987.<br>
<br>In 1986 d'Abo became the first woman to launch a takeover bid for a public company when through Stormgard, an investment company she had joined in 1985, she successfully bid for Selincourt, the fashion and textiles group, which included the Jacqmar and Frank Usher labels. Although some of her backers withdrew their support, leaving her to find &pound;23 million in a very short time, her bid succeeded. Nevertheless, after disagreements with her fellow directors over future strategy she abandoned her plans to turn Selincourt into a major supplier of clothing to the high street chain stores and resigned in 1987 to become a consultant to the clothing supplier John Crowther. With the help of the management team she had built up at Rymans, in 1988 she bought Roffey Brothers Ltd, a turf dressing manufacturer in Bournemouth, followed by T. Parker, a distributor of supplies to golf courses; and in 1990 the fashionable Mayfair florist Moyses Stevens. She remained chairman of the Moyses Stevens Group and Moyses Stevens Investments until 1999.<br>
<br>D'Abo claimed never to have taken on a profitable business: she preferred to turn around a failing company, and, impressed by her successes, City bankers and financial institutions were prepared to back her ventures. As her reputation as a successful businesswoman spread, she was asked to join the boards of other companies and bodies, including the London Docklands Development Corporation from 1985 to 1988, the Channel 4 television company from 1986 to 1987, and the industrial development board for Northern Ireland from 1992 to 1994. She was appointed a trustee of the Natural History Museum in 1988, and served on the council of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (later Cancer Research UK) from 1994.<br>
<br>Tall, stylish, and striking in appearance, famous for her heart-shaped glasses, and with her upper-class background and manner, Jennifer d'Abo led a hectic and cosmopolitan business life. A well-known London hostess, she enjoyed entertaining, and in 1999 published <span class="italic">Jennifer d'Abo at Home: Recipes for Stylish People in a Hurry</span>, which won an award at the World Cookbook Fair in Versailles. A few months before her death she moved to Aguts, in the Tarn region of southern France, where she died of cancer on 30 April 2003, and where she was buried. She was survived by her daughter, Sophy Morgan-Jones, and her son, Joel Cadbury. In her memory her family and friends founded the d'Abo memorial scholarship to enable a woman to study for the degree of master of business administration at a business school in the United Kingdom.<br>
