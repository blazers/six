<span class="headword">Boone,  James Shergold</span>  (1798&#150;1859), <span class="occ">writer</span>, born on 30 June 1798 at Sunbury, Middlesex, and baptized on 8 August 1798 there, was the second son of Thomas Boone (<i>b</i>. 22 July 1760), a surgeon, and his wife, Rose Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Shergold, who died on 11 July 1798, shortly after her son's birth. He was educated from June 1812 to April 1816 at Charterhouse School, where he won composition prizes in 1814 and 1816, and then at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated as a commoner on 30 May 1816 and was promoted to a studentship in 1818. In 1817 he won a Craven scholarship, as well as both the chancellor's Latin verse prize and the Newdigate English verse prize. While an undergraduate he published <span class="italic">The Oxford Spy</span>, an anonymous verse satire on university life critical of Oxford's curriculum and examinations, which caused a sensation. The first four dialogues and an appendix appeared in 1818, the fifth and last dialogue in 1819. In 1820 he won the chancellor's Latin essay prize. In keeping with his criticisms, however, Boone disdained an honours degree and took an ordinary BA on 24 May 1820. He took his MA on 4 March 1823.<br>
<br>In 1820 Boone published, again anonymously, <span class="italic">The Welcome of Isis</span>, a verse tribute to the duke of Wellington on the occasion of his expected, but postponed, visit to Oxford. He then returned to the subject of university reform with the publication of <span class="italic">An Essay on the Study of Modern History</span> (1821), urging the addition of the subject to the Oxford curriculum. One account states that after leaving Oxford Boone was offered a parliamentary seat by a patron impressed by his early promise  (Mozley, 2.203). He declined, turning to literary pursuits in London and lecturing on such subjects as the mutual relations of art and science. <span class="italic">The Council of Ten</span>, a monthly periodical of which he was editor and virtually sole contributor, appeared in June 1822 but lasted only twelve numbers. He then published <span class="italic">Men and Things in 1823: a Poem in Three Epistles, with Notes</span> (1823), a survey of European politics in which he expressed high admiration for Canning.<br>
<br>On 24 April 1824 Boone married Ellen Cotterill, of Totteridge, Hertfordshire, relinquishing his Christ Church studentship in the same year. Ordained deacon in 1826 and priest in 1827, he returned to Charterhouse as a master in the latter year. Having stood unsuccessfully for the schoolmastership of Charterhouse in 1832, he accepted in June the incumbency of the newly consecrated St John's, Paddington.<br>
<br>Boone's continued interest in educational matters found expression in <span class="italic">National Education: a Sermon</span> (1833) and <span class="italic">The Educational Economy of England</span> (1838), in which he railed against ideas of state control. Also of interest is <span class="italic">One, Manifold, or, System</span> (1848), a philosophical work prompted by European revolution. His most important literary undertaking, however, was the editorship from January 1834 of the <span class="italic">British Critic</span>, a high-church literary and theological quarterly controlled by the Hackney Phalanx; this is the clearest indication of his own churchmanship. After January 1836, however, when John Henry Newman struck an agreement to provide the <span class="italic">British Critic</span> with a fixed number of reviews written by his Tractarian coterie, Boone came under increasing pressure to suppress views uncongenial to the Oxford Movement. Newman's manoeuvres to wrest editorial control eventually undermined Boone's position and he resigned late in 1837, ultimately to be succeeded by Newman himself.<br>
<br>Boone's wife, Ellen, died on 11 April 1840, and he married Julia Maria, daughter of William Cox, of London, on 11 January 1842. There were no children by either marriage. Boone remained at St John's, Paddington, until his death aged sixty, after two years of illness, at 2 Stanhope Street (now Terrace), Hyde Park Gardens, on 24 March 1859. A brass erected to his memory remains in the chancel at St John's. Boone enjoyed some reputation as a preacher. He was appointed select preacher at Oxford in 1859, but illness prevented him from fulfilling the office. Various of his individual sermons as well as a collection, <span class="italic">Sermons on Various Subjects and Occasions</span> (1853), were published, while his <span class="italic">Sermons Chiefly on the Theory of Belief</span> (1860) was posthumously edited.<br>
