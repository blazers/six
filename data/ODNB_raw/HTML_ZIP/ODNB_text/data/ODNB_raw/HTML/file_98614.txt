<span class="headword">Stoyle,  Roger John  Blin-</span>  (1924&#150;2007), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born on 24 December 1924 at the City Maternity Home, Westcotes Drive, Leicester, the only son and elder child of Cuthbert Basil St John Blin-Stoyle (1894&#150;1978), an engineer's fitter, later a driver then foreman for the Birmingham and Midland Omnibus Company, and his wife, Ada Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nash (1893&#150;1983). His education began in South Wigston, and in September 1935 he won a scholarship to Alderman Newton's Boys' School in Leicester. Not until the sixth form did physics, thanks to some inspirational teaching, become exciting for him. He was brought up an Anglican, and was a member of the Church Lads' Brigade and the Anglican Young People's Association. In 1943 he was awarded a senior scholarship in natural science at Wadham College, Oxford. However, he was conscripted for military service in September 1943 and in April 1945 was commissioned into the Royal Corps of Signals. After a brief posting in Cologne he served as an officer instructor at Mhow, a cantonment near Indore, India. After demobilization in September 1946 he started at Wadham. At Oxford he met Audrey Elizabeth Balmford (<i>b</i>. 1927), a mathematics student at St Hugh's College, and daughter of Joseph Clifford Balmford, schoolmaster, of Liverpool; they were married on 30 August 1949, just after his graduation with first-class honours in physics. They had a son, Tony, and daughter, Helena.<br>
<br>Blin-Stoyle continued at Oxford as a graduate student in the department of theoretical physics under the supervision of John Spiers, working initially on polarized nuclear reactions, and then on the general formulation of &#946;-decay theory, the decay of radioactive atomic nuclei through the emission of an electron (or positron). This work led to his first paper, published in 1951, and, in the same year, his DPhil degree. A Pressed Steel research fellowship enabled him to stay at Oxford and immediately he became the &#145;house theorist&#146; for the local experimental research group working on deuteron&#150;deuteron collisions. This was the first of several close and fruitful interactions with experimental groups, which were a feature of his later work. In 1953 he spent one year in Birmingham as a lecturer in mathematical physics and was encouraged by Rudi Peierls to work on the calculation of nuclear magnetic moments; this led to his first book, <span class="italic">Theories of Nuclear Moments</span> (1957). After returning to Oxford as a senior research officer in theoretical physics he began a collaboration with Michael Grace, leader of a group doing experiments on polarized nuclei. About this time he also collaborated on mesonic exchange effects in &#946;-decay with John Bell, a theorist at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Harwell, and with Henry Primakoff, a visitor from Washington University, St Louis, USA. The protons and neutrons (nucleons) that make the nucleus are subject to quantum fluctuations caused by the exchange of fleeting &#145;virtual&#146; particles, such as mesons. These fluctuations affect the nuclear properties and permit their use as a &#145;laboratory&#146; in which to discover properties of the possibly exotic virtual particles. Blin-Stoyle used this to great effect later. Following the arrival in 1957 of Denys Wilkinson in Oxford he became interested in the parity-violating internucleon potential generated by meson exchange, and this led to the publication in 1960 of a much cited paper, &#145;Parity non-conserving internucleon potentials&#146;, in the <span class="italic">Physics Review</span>. It was written while he was a visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a year that changed his view of how physics and science generally should be taught at universities.<br>
<br>Fortuitously Blin-Stoyle had an opportunity to implement his ideas about the teaching of science when, in 1962, he was appointed professor of theoretical physics at the then very new University of Sussex, and dean of its first science school, the school of physical sciences, which contained three subject groups: mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Some courses, in mathematics and in the structure and properties of matter, taught by Blin-Stoyle himself, were compulsory for all first-year students. His research continued to use the nucleus as a laboratory, and in 1970 he and Joan Freeman, an experimentalist at Harwell, inferred the existence of heavy intermediate vector mesons, later called W- and Z-bosons, from precision data on (superallowed) &#946;-decays; the direct detection of these particles at CERN was not made until 1983. In 1976 they received the Institute of Physics Rutherford medal and prize for this work, and in the same year Blin-Stoyle was elected a fellow of the Royal Society for his overall contributions to nuclear physics. His account of this field appeared in his book <span class="italic">Fundamental Interactions of the Nucleus</span> (1973).<br>
<br>Blin-Stoyle's many administrative posts at Sussex included a period as deputy vice-chancellor (to Asa Briggs) in 1970&#150;72, and as pro-vice-chancellor (science) in 1977&#150;9. Service in 1978&#150;83 on the joint committee of the Royal Society and the Institute of Physics afforded him opportunities to influence science education from the age of five upwards, and in 1983&#150;8 he chaired the School Curriculum Development Committee. He retired from Sussex in 1987, but continued to serve on various professional bodies. In 1990&#150;92 he was president of the Institute of Physics; he and the chief executive, Alun Jones, launched a Campaign for Physics resulting in a 30 per cent increase in the institute's membership. His continuing interest in school science education led to his appointment in 1993 as president of the Association for Science Education, a task that was informed by his concurrent experience of teaching ten-year-olds in a Lewes primary school near his home. An accomplished pianist and organist&#151;who had considered trying for an organ scholarship at Oxford if he failed to win a natural science scholarship, and who became an associate of the Royal College of Music in 1949&#151;he played in most churches in Lewes and many further afield. He died at Claydon House nursing home, 8 Wallands Crescent, Lewes, on 31 January 2007, of acute on chronic heart disease, and was survived by his wife, Audrey, and their two children. His humanist funeral was in Brighton on 12 February, with a commemoration at the University of Sussex on 15 June.<br>
