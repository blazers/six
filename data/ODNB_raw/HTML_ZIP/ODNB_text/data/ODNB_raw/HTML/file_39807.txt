<span class="headword">Finley, Sir  Moses I.</span>  (1912&#150;1986), <span class="occ">historian and sociologist</span>, was born in New York on 20 May 1912, the eldest in the family of three sons and one daughter of Nathan Finkelstein, mechanical engineer, of New York, and his wife, Anna Katzenellenbogen. In October 1946 he followed his brothers and changed his name to Finley. He had no second forename, but used the initial &#145;I&#146;. He was educated at Central High School, Syracuse, New York, and at Syracuse University, where in 1927, aged fifteen, he graduated BA <i>magna cum laude</i>, majoring in psychology, and was elected to the American college fraternity Phi Beta Kappa. After taking an MA in public law at Columbia University, New York, in 1929, he worked as a legal clerk before holding several research posts (1930&#150;39). Now, under W. L. Westermann, he began to study ancient history. Between 1930 and 1933 he was research assistant to A. A. Schiller at Columbia and also on the editorial staff of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences</span>. In 1934&#150;5 he was a research fellow at Columbia, while also teaching (1934&#150;42) at the City College of New York. From 1937 to 1939 he was an editor and translator at the Institute for Social Research, which Max Horkheimer had brought from Frankfurt in 1934.<br>
<br>After working for various war relief agencies (1942&#150;7) Finley returned to Columbia in 1948 and was elected a fellow of the American Council of Learned Societies. From 1948 to 1952 he was lecturer, then assistant professor, at Rutgers University, Newark, New Jersey. Simultaneously he was working in the history faculty at Columbia for his PhD, which he took in 1950 with a thesis entitled &#145;Studies in land and credit in ancient Athens: 500&#150;200BC&#146; (published in 1952). From 1952 onwards he was active in a group around the Hungarian scholar, Karl Polanyi, who was then developing views on the pre-market economy, which had some influence on Finley.<br>
<br>In 1954, having come under attack for his left-wing opinions and after refusing to answer questions before the notorious McCarran subcommittee (of the Senate judiciary committee) on internal security, created by Senator Pat McCarran, Finley emigrated to Britain. Here he was appointed university lecturer in classics at Cambridge (1955&#150;64) and, in 1957, elected to a fellowship at Jesus College. Finley spent the rest of his life domiciled in Cambridge, becoming a British subject in 1962. He was reader in ancient social and economic history (1964&#150;70) and professor of ancient history (1970&#150;79), and from 1976 to 1982 master of Darwin College, Cambridge. He was knighted in 1979.<br>
<br>Finley's many writings on the society, economy, and political forms of ancient Greece were influential among fellow scholars, and the general public alike. His vast published output included over a score of books and countless articles and reviews; and he was highly regarded abroad, especially in France and Italy, where he frequently lectured and organized conferences. His training in history and law had familiarized him with the ideas of such scholars as Marc Bloch, Henri Pirenne, Thorstein Veblen, and the Freudians; and his association with the Frankfurt school reinforced his interest in Karl Marx. Later, however, he became dissatisfied with Marxism, preferring Max Weber's emphasis on status rather than class as a tool of social analysis. By employing Weber's concept of &#145;ideal types&#146; and the controlled use of comparative material from other societies, he tried to overcome the disadvantages of working on ancient Greece, where he found the evidence traditionally employed defective in range, variety, and quality. He insisted on regarding society as a whole; institutions must be assessed within their own social context, and all anachronistic comparisons between primitive and more advanced societies avoided. Though strongly influenced by theoretical constructs, Finley never set out to discuss theory and method <i>per se</i>, preferring always to let his attitude emerge from examples of actual historical analysis.<br>
<br>A high point in Finley's career, and one that gave him great satisfaction, was the invitation to return to the USA in 1972 to deliver the Sather lectures at Berkeley in California (published as <span class="italic">The Ancient Economy</span>, 1973, 2nd edn, 1985) and the Mason Welch Gross lectures at Rutgers University (published as <span class="italic">Democracy Ancient and Modern</span>, 1973). These two sets of lectures, which earned him the Wolfson literary award in history (1974), along with <span class="italic">The Use and Abuse of History</span> (1975), best exemplify his most mature work; though perhaps his most original book is <span class="italic">The World of Odysseus</span> (1956, 2nd edn, 1977).<br>
<br>Finley's distinction was widely recognized. He delivered endowed lectures in England, France, the USA, and Denmark. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Historical Society (1970), of the British Academy (1971), and of the Royal Society of Arts (1971). He was a foreign member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters (1975), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1979), and the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei (1982), and received honorary degrees from the universities of Leicester (1972), Sheffield (1979), and Saskatchewan (1979), and from the City College of New York (1982). He was president of the Classical Association (1973&#150;4), the Cambridge Philological Society (1974&#150;6), and the Joint Association of Classical Teachers (1981&#150;3); and he was a trustee of the British Museum from 1977 to 1984.<br>
<br>An insatiable controversialist in discussion and in print, Finley relished polemic. His interjections, usually introduced by a drawled, &#145;I'm sorry, but &hellip;&#146;, were characterized by hard hitting. But to friends, colleagues, and students he was warm-hearted and generous, and he built up a productive school to which he was both patron and Socratic gadfly. Finley was of medium height, with a dark complexion, slightly rugged features, and a lively countenance, expressive of his sharp mind. For most of his life he was a chain-smoker and, even after he stopped smoking for reasons of health, from ingrained habit he would hold the fingers of his right hand bent, as if still clutching a cigarette.<br>
<br>From 1932 Finley enjoyed a happy and mutually reinforcing marriage with his wife Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Moscowitz, who later changed to her mother's surname, Thiers), schoolteacher. They had no children. On the day of her death he suffered a cerebral haemorrhage, and he died the following day on 23 June 1986 at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge. He was cremated at Cambridge crematorium.<br>
