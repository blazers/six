<span class="headword">Stonehewer,  Richard</span>  (1727/8&#150;1809), <span class="occ">friend of Thomas Gray</span>, was baptized on 12 June 1728 at Houghton-le-Spring, co. Durham, where his father, Richard Stonehewer (1692/3&#150;1769), was rector from 1727 to 1769. After a rudimentary education at the Kepier grammar school in Houghton parish, he was admitted pensioner at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 4 November 1745, aged seventeen, and obtained a scholarship on 2 May 1747. He soon became known to Gray, probably through the introduction of Thomas Wharton MD, of Old Park, near Durham, the poet's lifelong friend. Stonehewer graduated BA in 1750, being eighth wrangler in the mathematical tripos, was elected a fellow of Peterhouse on 29 October 1751, and proceeded MA in 1753. While residing on his fellowship in Cambridge he was the tutor of Augustus Henry Fitzroy, third duke of Grafton (1735&#150;1811). When the duke entered politics Stonehewer became his private secretary, and remained a close friend throughout his life. In April 1761 and until June 1763 he was &#145;interpreter of oriental languages&#146;. On 19 July 1765 Stonehewer was the duke's under-secretary of state for the northern department, and on 28 June 1766 he became under-secretary for the southern department to the duke of Richmond. Through the duke of Grafton he obtained for Gray the professorship of modern history and languages at Cambridge, and was himself made permanent auditor of the excise.<br>
<br>In 1768 Stonehewer was living at Queen Street, Mayfair, Westminster, where William Mason (1724&#150;1797) paid him a visit, and he afterwards lived at 14 Curzon Street, a house nearly opposite the chapel. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 17 May 1787. Gray called him in 1769 his &#145;best friend&#146;, and left him &pound;500 in his will. William Burke deemed him &#145;a gentleman of great worth, extreme good understanding, and of the politest manners&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calendar of the Home Office</span>, 22 April 1766). He was friendly with Horace Walpole, and in 1773 made a trip to the English lakes with Mason. In May 1782 Stonehewer was &#145;very ill of the influenza&#146;, but he lived to a good old age; he died on 30 January 1809, aged eighty-one.<br>
<br>The manuscripts which Gray left, together with his library, to Mason, were left by Mason to Stonehewer, who bequeathed to Pembroke College, Cambridge, Gray's commonplace books and holograph copies of most of his poems. The correspondence of Gray and Mason, published by John Mitford in 1853, was left by Mason to Stonehewer, and passed from him to his relative Mr Bright of Skeffington Hall, Leicestershire. So did a part of Gray's library, the subsequent fate of which is described by Austin Dobson in <span class="italic">Eighteenth-Century Vignettes</span> (1892, 138). Stonehewer presented a manuscript by Gray on Aristophanes to T. J. Mathias. Letters to him are in Edmund Gosse's edition of Gray's <span class="italic">Works</span>  (2.277&#150;9, 373&#150;5; 3.46&#150;8, 342, 351).<br>
