<span class="headword">Bloxam,  Charles Loudon</span>  (1831&#150;1887), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 23 March 1831 at Meriden, Warwickshire, the third son of William Bloxam, surgeon. The family subsequently moved to 28 Duke Street, London. He attended King's College School in 1842&#150;3, and from 1845 trained in chemistry under A. W. Hofmann at the Royal College of Chemistry, London, becoming full assistant in 1849. In 1852 he became a full-time private tutor and chemical analyst at 28 Duke Street, London. With Frederick Abel he published <span class="italic">A Handbook of Chemistry</span> in 1854. In the same year he became demonstrator in chemistry in King's College, London. In 1856 he succeeded J. E. Bowman as professor of practical chemistry there, becoming full professor on the death of W. A. Miller in 1870. Simultaneously, he was lecturer in chemistry at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich (1855&#150;82), and the Royal Artillery College, Woolwich (1864&#150;87). In 1882, he resigned from the Royal Military Academy following gross indiscipline of the cadets and poor teaching conditions, an incident which highlighted the unsatisfactory arrangements for science teaching in military establishments at this time.<br>
<br>Bloxam's earliest researches were on the determination and qualitative separation of tin, antimony, and arsenic, and such analytical investigations, including his electrolytic test for arsenic, constituted most of his research during 1852&#150;87, published mainly in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Chemical Society</span> and <span class="italic">Chemical News</span>. His outstanding contribution was to the teaching of chemistry, to which end he published <span class="italic">Chemistry, Inorganic and Organic</span> (11 edns, 1867&#150;1923) and <span class="italic">Laboratory Teaching</span> (6 edns, 1869&#150;93). He also revised J. E. Bowman's <span class="italic">Practical Chemistry</span> to 1885 and his <span class="italic">Medical Chemistry</span> to 1862. These were outstanding and durable student texts.<br>
<br>In early life, Bloxam kept detailed diaries. These are still extant, and form an interesting historical source. He was an indefatigable lecturer to medical, applied science, analytical, evening, and occasional students of chemistry at King's College, and to military academy cadets. He also trained his brother, Thomas Bloxam (1836&#150;1872), who assisted him in his post at King's College before becoming assistant to Dr George Wilson at the Industrial Museum of Scotland in 1855.<br>
<br>On 17 July 1856 Bloxam married Frederica Louisa (<i>d</i>. 1901), daughter of John Leopold Abel, a musician, and sister of Frederick Abel. They had four daughters and four sons, one of whom, Arthur George Bloxam (1866&#150;1940), was sometime head of the chemical department at Goldsmiths' Institute, London. Bloxam, who was suffering from emphysema, died on 28 November 1887, at 16 Endsleigh Gardens, Euston Square, following bronchitis, and was buried in Charlton cemetery, London, on 1 December 1887.<br>
<br>Bloxam's nephew, <a name="cosubject_56416"></a><span class="headword">William Popplewell Bloxam</span>  (1860&#150;1913), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 9 January 1860 at 21 Mount Street, Grosvenor Square, London, the son of William Bloxam, surgeon, and his wife, Emma Caroline Kite. He was trained by his uncle at King's College. He became demonstrator in chemistry under Heinrich Debus (1824&#150;1915) at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, researching especially sulphur compounds. He was briefly professor of chemistry in Madras, and he subsequently conducted research into improving the efficiency of indigo extraction from natural sources. He continued these and other colour chemistry researches at the Clothworkers' Research Laboratory, Leeds University, under A. G. Perkin, from 1904.<br>
<br>On 6 August 1885 William Popplewell Bloxam married Jessie Christian, daughter of Edwin Low, a solicitor. He died, following a cerebral haemorrhage, in Guy's Hospital, London, on 26 December 1913.<br>
