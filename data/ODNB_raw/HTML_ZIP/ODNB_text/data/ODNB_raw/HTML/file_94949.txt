<span class="headword">Rai, Lala Lajpat</span>  (1865&#150;1928), <span class="occ">reformer and politician in India</span>, was born on 28 January 1865 in the village of Dhudike, in the Ferozepore district of the Punjab, British India, the eldest son of Radha Krishan (<i>d</i>. 1923), a teacher of Persian and Urdu, and his wife, Gulab Devi. He was educated at home by his father, from whom he acquired a strong interest in religion and history, before he attended the government middle school at Rupar. He was married at the age of thirteen to Radha Devi, who came from a similar Agarwal caste background. He completed his education at the Ludhiana mission school before joining Government College, Lahore. His studies were increasingly subordinated to activities associated with the Hindu religious reformist organization the Arya Samaj, which he joined at the end of 1882.<br>
<br>Lajpat Rai left college without a degree. He thus had to take up the relatively lowly post of a <i>mukhtar</i> in legal practice at Jagraon. He moved from there to Rohtak, where he combined legal work with involvement in the Arya Samaj. He qualified as a <i>vakil</i> (or attorney) at the third attempt in 1885. From 1886 to 1892 he worked in the courts at Hissar and established an active Arya Samaj organization. He was increasingly drawn to the wider social and political horizons of Lahore, the capital of the Punjab. It was there that he helped establish DAV College in memory of the founder of the movement, Swami Dayananda. In 1893 the Arya Samaj split into its &#145;college&#146; and &#145;vegetarian&#146; factions. Lajpat Rai became a prominent member of the more moderate &#145;college&#146; faction. He established an Arya Samaj orphanage in Ferozepore and became involved in famine relief in both 1897 and 1899&#150;90. From 1898 he curtailed his legal practice to devote his energies to the Arya Samaj.<br>
<br>Lajpat Rai first attended the annual session of the Indian National Congress in 1893. It was over a decade, however, before he rose to political prominence. In June 1905 he travelled to London with Gopal Krishna Gokhale as part of an official Congress deputation. This was the first of a growing number of overseas visits. Lajpat Rai was increasingly identified with what became known as the &#145;extremist&#146; wing of the Congress. The British authorities brought a case against his weekly newspaper, <span class="italic">The Punjabee</span>, and his involvement in the 1907 agrarian unrest in the Punjab led to his deportation without trial to Mandalay, Burma, in May of that year. His detention lasted for six months. It added greatly to his political reputation. He returned at the time of the split between the &#145;moderate&#146; and &#145;extremist&#146; wings of the Congress. In 1909 and 1910 he made two further visits to England. He also played an important role in the formation in 1909 of the Punjab Hindu Sabha. This was the forerunner of the all-India Hindu Mahasabha organization, which was formed in 1915.<br>
<br>Lajpat Rai began a long overseas sojourn in December 1913. He initially visited England as part of a Congress delegation before travelling to the United States and Japan. He gave lectures in both countries and met a number of Indian revolutionaries. He popularized the Indian nationalist struggle in America through the publication <span class="italic">Young India</span> and the Indian Home Rule League of America, which he founded in October 1915. As a result of these activities he was not permitted to return to India during the war years, while his publications were proscribed. It was only in February 1920 that he arrived back in Bombay. His native Punjab province had been the scene in 1919 of the Jallianwalla Bagh massacre, and the subsequent introduction of martial law. He was arrested in November 1921 during the non-co-operation movement (launched by Mahatma Gandhi the previous year, to protest against British rule), under the terms of the <span class="roman">Seditious Meetings Act</span>. During his subsequent imprisonment his father died, and his own health deteriorated. He was transferred to Dharmsala prison from Lahore, then released on 16 August 1923.<br>
<br>The period 1923&#150;7 saw two further visits to Britain, where Lajpat Rai renewed his acquaintance with Beatrice and Sidney Webb, and to Geneva, where he attended the 1926 International Labour Organization conference. Within Indian politics he had a somewhat uncomfortable period as a member of the Swaraj Party, which, under the leadership of Motilal Nehru, contested elections to the legislative councils under the scheme of &#145;dyarchy&#146; introduced by the <span class="roman">Government of India Act</span> of 1919. The British refusal to grant India a new constitution and dominion status had by 1926 ended this tentative experiment in reforming the raj from within. When the controversial Simon commission visited Lahore on 30 October 1928 Lajpat Rai led a procession against it. He received a number of blows when the police baton-charged the peaceful protesters. When he died, after contracting a fever, on 17 November his doctors maintained there was a direct link between the severe beating he had suffered and his demise. He was cremated by the bank of the Ravi River in Lahore that evening. He was regarded as a hero of the nationalist struggle and his death encouraged Bhagat Singh and his fellow Punjabi revolutionaries to take revenge on the British authorities.<br>
