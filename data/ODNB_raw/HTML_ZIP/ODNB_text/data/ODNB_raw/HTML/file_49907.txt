<span class="headword">Mortensen,  Stanley Harding</span>  (1921&#150;1991), <span class="occ">footballer</span>, was born at 23 Lord Nelson Street, South Shields, on 26 May 1921, the second son of Christopher Hardwick Mortensen, butcher, and his wife, Sarah Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Baker. His Scandinavian surname, the cause of many journalistic misprints, was inherited from his Norwegian grandfather, a sailor based in South Shields. Educated at St Mary's School, Tyne Dock, he was selected for the school football team when only nine years old and for South Shields schoolboys at the age of thirteen. After leaving school at fourteen he worked in a timber yard for three years before joining Blackpool United Football Club as an inside-right in 1938, after impressing club scouts in a junior match. The club considered releasing him because of his lack of pace, but diligent training eventually made him one of the fastest forwards in the English game. In 1941 he joined the RAF as a wireless operator&#150;gunner; he subsequently survived an aircrash near Lossiemouth which killed two members of the crew and saw a third lose a leg. Although he received serious head injuries, he soon resumed his football career, and played for at least eleven clubs in various wartime competitions. He regarded this period as an important part of his football education and made sufficient progress to be selected first for the RAF and then for the England squad against Wales in 1943. In the somewhat relaxed atmosphere of wartime football he played for the Welsh side when cover could not be found for an injured player. He made his first appearance for the &#145;correct&#146; team against Wales the following year. On 2 November 1943 he married Jean Galloway (<i>b</i>. 1920/21), clerk, and daughter of William Galloway, plasterer. They had met on Mortensen's first day as a Blackpool footballer.<br>
<br>When the Football League programme resumed in 1946, Mortensen was an automatic choice in the Blackpool side, either at inside-right or centre-forward. His acceleration, ability to shoot fiercely from awkward angles, and general quick-wittedness, soon made him one of the most effective goal-scorers in the English game. Between 1946 and 1955 he scored 197 goals for his club in 325 league games and a further 25 in 29 FA cup games: he scored in every round (including the final) in 1947&#150;8. He finished on the losing side in 1948 and again in 1951, but in 1953, against Bolton Wanderers, he became the first player to score a hat-trick in a Wembley FA cup final. The game was error-strewn and turned on injuries to Bolton players, but it provided a dramatic climax as Blackpool came from 3&#150;1 down with only ten minutes remaining to win 4&#150;3. The game is invariably termed the &#145;Matthews final&#146; in honour of Stanley Matthews, who played a major role in wearing down a tired Bolton side but, as Matthews always acknowledged, Mortensen's goals were the crucial ingredient. Although the football world was delighted with his achievement, until his final goal was scored the television commentator continued to describe his first as an &#145;own goal&#146;, since his shot had taken a decisive deflection off a Bolton player. Mortensen also enjoyed a prolific goal-scoring record at international level, particularly in his early games: he scored four times on his full international d&eacute;but in a 10&#150;0 defeat of Portugal in 1947, and completed a hat-trick against Sweden later in the year. Overall, he scored twenty-three times in twenty-five England appearances between 1947 and 1953.<br>
<br>Mortensen left Blackpool in October 1955 for Hull City, then joined Southport for the 1956&#150;7 season. Between 1957 and 1962 he played non-league football with Bath and then Lancaster City, before finally retiring in 1962 to run a betting shop and a sports outfitter's in Blackpool, where he also served as a Conservative councillor. He returned to football in February 1967 as manager of Blackpool, but despite only narrowly failing to secure the team promotion to the first division in the following year, and proving himself popular with supporters, he was sacked in April 1969. He returned to his business interests but, by the early 1980s, increasingly poor health forced him into a less than financially secure retirement. Morty remained a respected local figure, however, not least because of his considerable work for local charities, and he was rewarded with the freedom of Blackpool in March 1990.<br>
<br>Mortensen died at the Victoria Hospital, Blackpool, following a heart attack, on 22 May 1991. His well-attended funeral was held at St John's parish church, Blackpool, and he was cremated at Carleton crematorium, on 29 May. He was survived by his wife. Although not a significant figure in the sense of having made a distinctive contribution to the game's evolution or to the nature of the football profession, Mortensen was undoubtedly one of the best players of his generation, much liked and respected by his fellow players, and a major attraction at grounds throughout the country in the ten years after the Second World War.<br>
