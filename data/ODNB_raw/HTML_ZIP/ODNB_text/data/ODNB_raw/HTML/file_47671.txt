<span class="headword">Ramakrishna Paramahansa</span>  (1836&#150;1886), <span class="occ">Hindu religious leader</span>, was born Gadadhar Chatterji on 18 February 1836, in the village of Kamarpukur, located in the Hooghly district of Bengal. His father, Kshudiram, and mother, Chandramani, were orthodox Brahmans, probably Vaishnavite sectarians. His father died in 1843, when Gadadhar was still a young child. At the age of nine Gadadhar received the sacred thread that denoted his place as a member of the Brahman caste and in 1852 he attended his elder brother Ramkumar's school in Calcutta. Here it is presumed he learned the necessary information and skills needed to conduct the rituals demanded by his inherited occupation as a Hindu priest. Upon completion of his education, he found employment at the newly established Dakshineshwar Temple 5 miles north of Calcutta. There he served as a pujari (priest), and conducted daily worship of Kali, the mother goddess of life and death. During his youth he demonstrated both a restlessness for and a fascination with mystical religion. The young Gadadhar neglected his ritual duties, and instead devoted increasing amounts of time to the search for spiritual enlightenment. He would sink into states of apparent unconsciousness and occasionally burst forth into extreme religious ecstasy. Such activity resulted in his dismissal from his position as a temple priest. In 1859 his family attempted to divert him from his preoccupation with personal religion by arranging his marriage to Sarada Devi. At the time of her marriage Sarada Devi was six years old and Gadadhar twenty-five. Following Hindu custom she returned home to live with her parents. In the intervening years Gadadhar was not to be dissuaded from continuing his search for a direct, mystical union with God.<br>
<br>During the 1860s Gadadhar studied with a series of ascetics, seeking their guidance in his search for ultimate truth, which, if found, would give him eternal freedom from the cycle of rebirth. His first guide was a Bhairavi Brahmani, a wandering female ascetic from East Bengal, who instructed him in the tantric texts and rituals that provided a path to spiritual power through magical and erotic rituals. Next he was instructed by Jatadhari, a Vaishnavite mystic from north India, and finally by Tota Puri, a devotee of Shankaracharya, the ninth-century religious thinker who created the philosophic foundation of orthodox Hinduism. Tota Puri initiated him into sanyas, the formal stage of a renunciant, and gave him the name Ramakrishna Paramahansa.<br>
<br>After his initiation as a sanyasi, Ramakrishna immersed himself in an exploration of Hinduism and other religions. He studied Sufism (Islamic mysticism), and even adopted Muslim dress, prayers, and religious behaviour. Using similar techniques, he explored Christianity, with the result that he received visions of both Christ and the Madonna. He also acted out other roles such as that of Radha, the wife of the Hindu deity Lord Krishna, for which he dressed and behaved as a Hindu woman. By 1871 he appears to have achieved a degree of inner peace. In 1872, when Sarada Devi reached the age of eighteen, she joined Ramakrishna, who still resided at the Dakshineshwar Temple but not as a practising priest. He proclaimed his wife to be the embodiment of the divine mother, thus transforming their marriage into a spiritual partnership. The attempt to draw the young Ramakrishna away from his preoccupation with a personal search for the divine had failed completely.<br>
<br>By the early 1870s Ramakrishna had attracted a small group of disciples who found in him an accessible, non-judgemental, and nurturing teacher. His new disciples came mostly from the growing number of young men who were educated in schools that taught a British curriculum through the English language. In addition, their urban experiences in Calcutta generated in them a sense of distance from their traditional culture. They questioned Hindu beliefs and customs, with which they were no longer comfortable. These disciples gathered, Ramakrishna talked, and occasionally they raised questions or spoke of their own doubts and needs. For them Ramakrishna was a guru, a spiritual guide to whom they gave increasing loyalty. Three interlinked themes ran through their discussions: the first was the universality of religions&#151;all were true, for each followed its own road to the ultimate source of all being; a corresponding conclusion was that the doctrines and rituals of Hinduism should be preserved unchanged; and finally, since all religions were true there could be no justification for criticism of one religion by another or for conversion from one to another.<br>
<br>In 1882 one disciple, Mahendranath Gupta, began to record Swami Ramakrishna's conversations, thus producing the only written account of his doctrines. In October 1885, when Ramakrishna fell ill, his disciples embarked on the task of nursing their guru. In October they moved him to 55 Shyampur Street in Calcutta and in December transferred him to 90 Cossimpore Road. When he lay near death, he charged the young Narendra Nath to &#145;teach my boys&#146; and &#145;keep them together&#146;. On 16 August 1886 Ramakrishna Paramahansa died, leaving behind him a small group of disciples and no writings except for those recorded by Mahendranath Gupta.<br>
<br>Well before his death Ramakrishna's ideas were spread beyond the world of his disciples. After 1875 his message was popularized by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47672/', "Keshab Chandra Sen")</script>, who met Ramakrishna in 1872 and accepted the concept of the universality of all religions. Sen was a Brahmo Samaj leader who broke with that reform society and established his own branch of this religious movement. Following Ramakrishna's death Sarada Devi became widely respected as a spiritual leader among those who followed her husband's doctrines and the wider public. The most famous of Ramakrishna's disciples, however, was Narendranath Datta, later known as Swami Vivekananda, who transmitted and transformed Ramakrishna's ideas and created the Ramakrishna Math and Mission, an international movement of religious action and social service. At a time when the impact of both Christian missions and imperial rule was causing questioning and turbulence in all of India's main religious traditions, Ramakrishna Paramahansa was among the most important leaders of the Hindu tradition.<br>
