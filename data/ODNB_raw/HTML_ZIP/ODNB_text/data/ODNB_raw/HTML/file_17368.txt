<span class="headword">Mac C&aacute;ba,  Cathaoir</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1728&#150;1739), <span class="occ">poet and harper</span>, was born at Cloghballybeg in the parish of Mullagh, co. Cavan. Throughout his life he was the intimate friend of the celebrated harper Turlogh O'Carolan 
    (Toirdhealbhach &Oacute; Cearbhall&aacute;in; 1670&#150;1738)
  , who addressed two poems to him, one of them on hearing a report of his death&#151;the report, which was false, originated as a practical joke played on O'Carolan by his friend. Mac C&aacute;ba addressed several poems and some miscellaneous verses to O'Carolan. Many of these were humorous (such as his contribution to a &#145;scolding match&#146; between the two) but one of them was a lament on the great harper's death which has been adjudged to evince &#145;a competence in versification and a depth of feeling to which [O'Carolan] could hardly attain&#146;  (O'Sullivan, 1.68). Mac C&aacute;ba had dealings in 1727&#150;8 with the noted scholar Charles O'Conor (1710&#150;1791) and spent some periods at the latter's home at Belanagare, co. Roscommon, where they exchanged harp tunes. Mac C&aacute;ba was friendly with the O'Donnell family of Larkfield, near Manorhamilton, co. Leitrim, and he composed a lament in 1736 for a relation of that family's, Colonel Manus O'Donnell of Newport, co. Mayo. In addition to a small number of other extant poems, there is record of at least two other works by Mac C&aacute;ba that seem not to have survived. While it has been suggested that Mac C&aacute;ba may have died as early as 1739, one authority declares that he outlived O'Carolan by many years and that, &#145;having obtained a licence to teach, as a &#147;Popish school-master&#148;, he earned a scanty subsistence in his old age and finally died in want&#146;  (Hardiman, 1.lxii). He was said to have been buried in the churchyard of Mullagh, near the well of St Ultan.<br>
