<span class="headword">Herbert,  Thomas</span>  (<em>b. </em>1597, <em>d.</em> before 1643), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Montgomery on 15 May 1597, the seventh and posthumous son of Richard Herbert (<i>c</i>.1557&#150;1596) of Montgomery Castle and his wife, Magdalen (<i>d</i>. 1627), daughter of Sir Richard and Dame Margaret Newport of High Ercall, Shropshire. In 1608 Magdalen Herbert made a second and happy marriage to Sir John Danvers, the regicide, who was half her age. Thomas's brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13020/', "Edward Herbert, first Baron Herbert of Cherbury (1582?&#150;1648)")</script>, the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13025/', "George Herbert (1593&#150;1633)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13029/', "Sir Henry Herbert (bap. 1594, d. 1673)")</script>, master of the revels.<br>
<br>Thomas must have accompanied his mother when she went to live in Oxford in 1599&#150;1600 while her son Edward was studying there after his marriage. When he left school Thomas became page to Sir Edward Cecil in Germany, distinguished himself at the siege of Juliers in 1610, and took service with Benjamin Joseph, commander of an East India Company voyage in 1616. Sir Thomas Smyth, governor of the company, told Edward Herbert that after Joseph was killed in battle with a Portuguese ship Thomas rallied the men and renewed the fight. Edward Terry, chaplain, tells a different story. According to him, Thomas was sent to the east because of his unruliness at home and although engaged as a companion to Joseph, was soon sent before the mast with the common men. Terry asserts that the master took charge after Joseph was killed, and makes no mention of Herbert's role in the fight. He also says that once in India, Herbert beat and shot at a native servant and was &#145;the most hasty and cholerick young man that ever I knew&#146;  (Terry, 177). Terry was prejudiced but other, admittedly brief, accounts of the battle do not mention Herbert, although he may well have distinguished himself. Once attached to Sir Thomas Roe, the English ambassador to the Mughal emperor, Herbert behaved creditably, although Roe had had reservations beforehand.<br>
<br>Herbert soon returned to England and did well as captain of the <i>Marmaduke</i> in the Algiers expedition of 1620&#150;21 and of the <i>Seven Stars</i> in the fleet which brought home Prince Charles and the duke of Buckingham from their escapade to Spain in pursuit of a bride for Charles. Edward Herbert asserts that Thomas Herbert tried to save the ship in which he was conducting Count Mansfelt to the Low Countries, when she was cast away. The shipwreck, however, occurred in November 1624 when Mansfelt was on his way to England, and the captain of the ship, the <i>Speedwell</i>, makes no mention of Herbert. On 25 September 1625 Buckingham appointed Herbert as captain of the <i>Dreadnought</i>, with orders to serve against the Dunkirkers. The <i>Dreadnought</i> was, however, assigned to the Cadiz expedition under another captain, though Herbert commanded the <i>Assurance</i> from December 1625 until June 1626. There is no further mention of him, apart from his being listed as a possible captain in 1627 and 1629.<br>
<br>Some trifles which were published in the early 1640s have been attributed to Herbert, implausibly, since the pamphleteer states that he was Kentish born, whereas Herbert's birthplace was Montgomery. Herbert probably was, however, the author of a poem, &#145;The Storm&#146;. Edward Herbert, writing about 1643, states that disappointment of promotion had led Thomas Herbert to withdraw into a private and melancholy life until his death and burial in St Martin-in-the-Fields, London. There is no entry in the parish register.<br>
