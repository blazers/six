<span class="headword">Holland,  Thomas Agar</span>  (1803&#150;1888), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and poet</span>, was born on 16 January 1803 at Poynings rectory, near Steyning, Sussex, the eldest son of Samuel Holland (1772&#150;1857), precentor of Chichester and rector of Poynings, and Frances Erskine, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8873/', "Thomas Erskine (1750&#150;1823)")</script>, lord chancellor. He was educated at Westminster School, London, from June 1816 to Christmas 1818, and then spent some time at Edinburgh University and later attended Worcester College, Oxford, matriculating in 1821. He took his BA in 1825, proceeding MA in 1828. He entered the church as deacon in 1826, becoming a priest the following year in Chichester. He was then instituted as vicar of Oving, Sussex (1827&#150;38). In 1831 he married Magdaline Stewart, daughter of Major Philip Stewart. Their eldest son, the jurist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33944/', "Sir Thomas Erskine Holland")</script>, was born in 1835. Holland became rector of Greatham, Hampshire, in 1838 and in 1846 he succeeded his father as rector of Poynings. In the same year he was a founder member of the Sussex Archaeological Society, to which he belonged until his death. It was for the society's publication that he wrote his <span class="italic">History of Poynings</span> in 1863.<br>
<br>Holland's first publication as a poet was anonymous: <span class="italic">The Colossal Statue of William Wallace: a Poem by an Undergraduate</span> (Oxford, 1824). His major claim to the title of poet was established by his collection <span class="italic">Dryburgh Abbey and other Poems</span> (1826). In his preface he talks of the title-poem:<blockquote>commenced in the winter, 1820&#150;21 which the author (being yet in his &#145;teens&#146;) spent in Edinburgh, attending a session of the University (whence also the Latin prize) and occasionally visiting his grand-uncle, the late Earl of Buchan, at his mansion contiguous to the ruins of Dryburgh Abbey.</blockquote>These visits inspired the lengthy piece, in octosyllabics, which reflects his actively anti-Catholic stance in its attitudes to idolatry. His anti-Catholic views were often in evidence in his preaching and writing, as he campaigned against the religion's revival in England. <span class="italic">Dryburgh Abbey</span> was a popular volume: it was issued in successive editions in 1829, 1845, and 1884. The volume was said by his son to have received the warm commendation of Sir Walter Scott, and there is evidence of Scott's influence on Holland's writing, especially in the Romantic appeal of Scottish history. The accompanying poems were rooted in the natural world and family, varying in tone from earnest to witty. Attended by his wife, Holland died at his beloved Poynings rectory on 18 October 1888 of senile decay and heart failure, leaving four surviving sons and three daughters.<br>
