<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Debbieg,  Hugh</span>  (1731/2&#150;1810), <span class="occ">military engineer and army officer</span>, was educated at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich (1742&#150;6). Nothing is known of his parentage and birthplace. His ability was manifest at an early age, and he advanced rapidly in the Royal Artillery, becoming matross on 1 April 1742, cadet in May 1744, and cadet gunner in April 1745. During September and October 1746 he served as an engineer in the futile expedition against Point L'Orient, then returned briefly to Woolwich for further study. Appointed engineer-extraordinary in Flanders on 30 January 1747, Debbieg won the praise of William Augustus, duke of Cumberland, for the courage he exhibited at Val, on 2 July 1747. On Cumberland's nomination, he then served at Bergen-op-Zoom during the siege that culminated in a French seizure (17 September). On 2 April 1748 he became a practitioner engineer, and after the cessation of hostilities served on a team of engineers that surveyed the former theatre of war. Early in 1749 he returned to Britain, where he played a major role in surveying the military road which, on completion in 1752, linked Newcastle upon Tyne with Carlisle. He was also engaged in preparing a survey of Scotland, a duty which, he later claimed, awakened superiors to his &#145;Talent for sketching the Face of a Country&#146;  (Debbieg, 13). Newly promoted sub-engineer (2 August 1751), he was assigned to surveying defences at Chatham. He acquired a lieutenancy in the 37th foot on 1 September 1756, but did little if any service with the regiment, and after advancing to the rank of captain-lieutenant on 4 January 1758 he sold his commission (11 March 1761). On 14 May 1757 he was promoted lieutenant in the Royal Engineers, then, in quick succession, captain-lieutenant (4 January 1758) and captain (17 March 1759).<h2>
<a name="TheSevenYearsWarandaftermath"></a>The Seven Years' War and aftermath</h2>Ordered to America, Debbieg sailed for Halifax, arriving on 9 May 1758. During the siege of Louisbourg (11 June to 26 July) he served as assistant quartermaster-general under Major-General James Wolfe, continuing in that position throughout the campaign of 1759, except for a brief period when he relinquished it in order to take up duties as an engineer. He participated in the battles of Montmorency (31 July 1759) and the Plains of Abraham (13 September). Debbieg appears to have been with Wolfe when he died, and was so depicted in Benjamin West's <span class="italic">The Death of Wolfe</span>. During the winter of 1759&#150;60 he remained at Quebec, and he was present at the battle of Sillery (28 April 1760). After the subsequent siege of Quebec (raised on 17 May) and brief service in Boston and Louisbourg, he spent most of the next two years in Halifax, directing the construction of new defensive works. When the French seized Newfoundland during the summer of 1762, he participated in the successful counter-attack, winning praise for his contributions and valour.<br>
<br>Debbieg remained at St John's in 1762&#150;3, supervising work on the defences. On returning to Britain he married Jane (or Janet) Seton (<i>d</i>. 1801) in Edinburgh (27 March 1763). His wife may have been a Scottish Presbyterian&#151;as Debbieg may also have been&#151;and their second and third sons, Henry and Hugh, were baptized at Swallow Street Scotch Church, Westminster, on 13 October 1767 and 13 February 1769 respectively. When and where their eldest son, Clement, was baptized is unknown.<br>
<br>Debbieg returned to Newfoundland in 1766, this time as chief engineer, arriving at St John's on 20 August. The following February he submitted an account of the harbours in Newfoundland, and in May he reported to Granby on the condition of the barracks at St John's. His reputation was now sufficient to win him offers of high positions from both the East India Company and Venice. Instead of accepting either offer, he undertook in June 1767, at the request of Richard, fourth Viscount Howe, a secret mission to study harbour defences in France and Spain. Although as he toured he was the object of suspicion, at times confined and ill-treated, he completed the mission, returning to England in March 1768. He subsequently provided the government with plans of Marseilles, Cartagena, Corunna, and Cadiz, as well as with extensive evaluations of the defences of these and other ports. During his travels Debbieg had noted that defences at Gibraltar were weak, and in 1769 he served on a committee of engineers which advised on improving them.<br>
<br>In March 1769, at the instance of his patron, Granby, Debbieg was rewarded for his secret mission with a lifetime pension of &pound;1 per diem. On 23 July 1772 he was breveted major. He expected more, however, and initially directed his anger at Howe, who he claimed had not only failed to provide adequate recompense for his mission but also reneged on a promise, made in November 1770, to win him a brevet as lieutenant-colonel. Furthermore, while on his mission Debbieg was supplanted as senior engineer in North America by an officer who was his junior in service. This switch, which he considered &#145;almost Petrifying&#146;  (Debbieg, 15), he likewise blamed on Howe, claiming the latter had promised that the position would be held for him during the mission.<h2>
<a name="PoliticalcrisesinNorthAmericaandGreatBritain"></a>Political crises in North America and Great Britain</h2>Late in 1775 Debbieg was offered a position in America, but he refused to serve under his junior and was incensed by word that his pay while on the service would be cut sharply. At the instance of Sir Guy Carleton, Debbieg was in December 1775 appointed chief engineer in Canada, but he again declined, explaining in a cryptic letter that he had been prevented from going by &#145;one higher than himself&#146;  (Debbieg file, Society of Genealogists). On 29 August 1777 he was breveted lieutenant-colonel, and in May 1778 appointed chief engineer on the staff of Lord Amherst, who had come to know him well when both served in America. By a second appointment (17 March 1778), Debbieg became chief engineer at Chatham, and during the next few years he oversaw improvements to the defences there and elsewhere. He also designed several military bridges and invented an improved pontoon and machinery to defend a breach.<br>
<br>During the Gordon riots of June 1780 Debbieg, on Amherst's orders, organized and participated in the defence of public buildings of London. Twice rioters attacked the Bank of England, and although they were repulsed he later advised the bank on security measures. He also became alarmed at how easily the London water supply could be sabotaged, and recommended safeguards. Both schemes, however, were costly, so neither was pursued. Nevertheless, Debbieg's promotions continued: major and sub-director of the Royal Engineers on 24 January 1781, and colonel on 20 November 1782.<br>
<br>Although Debbieg continued to advance, it was not because he ingratiated himself with those in power. Toward his subordinates he tended to be solicitous. While at Chatham he employed a young recruit, William Cobbett, as his clerk, and instilled in him the importance of reading and grammar. He also strove to protect bargemen on his crew from being pressed for naval duty. His relationship with superiors, however, was often contentious. Bitter towards Howe for the alleged wrongs already noted, he also attacked Lord George Germain in several letters (1775&#150;6), claiming that the latter was duplicitous and was not adequately supporting him in his quest for promotion and preferment. At Chatham he feuded with the commanding officer. A few men in high positions, notably Amherst, may have regarded him with affection, but in general he appealed through his ability, not his personality. A contemporary reported that during the American War of Independence Debbieg &#145;differed with the ministers &hellip; as to their system of conducting their military operations, yet he was consulted by them on many occasions&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 595). Debbieg was aware of his reputation within the high command. In a letter to William Pitt, he acknowledged that he was widely seen as &#145;a Discordant Spirit&#146;, while insisting that in fact he was one:<blockquote>
<div>Whom not the D&#151;l himself can Drive<br>
</div>
<div>But Led, the Gentlest thing alive.<br>
</div> (TNA: PRO, PRO 30/8/129/1, fol. 8)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="FeudwithRichmondandquarrelwithPitt"></a>Feud with Richmond and quarrel with Pitt</h2>Debbieg's fortunes turned when Charles Lennox, third duke of Richmond, became master-general of the ordnance in March 1782. The two men had been at odds since the mid-1770s, and their relationship worsened in 1784 when Richmond obtained a royal warrant to reduce and reorganize the engineers and cut emoluments of colonels in the regiment. Debbieg responded with an angry letter to the duke, and for his temerity he was court-martialled and reprimanded. He was further angered when Richmond blocked his appointment to a board of officers to advise on home defence, then ignored &#145;the first Principles of a System of Fortification&#146;, a plan for fortifying Britain that had occupied Debbieg during much of the 1780s. In March 1789 Debbieg wrote to the duke in contemptuous terms, comparing him to an &#145;Architect who built an Elegant Town Hall, and left no room for a Stair-case to ascent to it&#146; and challenging him to initiate another court martial  (TNA: PRO, PRO 30/8/129/1, fols. 5&#150;6). When Richmond did not respond, Debbieg published the letter. The result was the court martial that he had desired, but the court denied him an opportunity to submit his plan of fortification for its review. For having challenged &#145;good Order and military Discipline&#146; by attacking Richmond, Debbieg was sentenced to be deprived of rank and pay for six months. This penalty was light, which the king attributed &#145;to the Opinion entertained by the Court Martial of Colonel Debbieg's former Services and professional Merit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Proceedings of a General Court Martial</span>, 103). Both courts martial were widely publicized; after the second a critic of Richmond commented:<blockquote>
<div>Learn thoughtless <i>Debbeige</i>, now no more a youth,<br>
</div>
<div>The woes unnumber'd that encompass truth.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Criticisms on the Rolliad, Part the Second</span>, 1790, 24)</blockquote>Debbieg's feud with Richmond coincided with increasing animosity towards Pitt. In this case the issue was mainly financial. He still believed that he had received less than he deserved for his secret mission of 1767&#150;8, and he had spoken or written to various government officials about obtaining further benefits. His bitterness was compounded when in early 1785 he was threatened with imprisonment for debt. On 22 April of that year Pitt, responding to his petition, communicated to him a promise of an additional stipend, plus, as Debbieg interpreted the letter, future preferment. This briefly mollified Debbieg, but he lost patience, and on 16 January 1788 he complained to Pitt, &#145;Can any Man believe, Sir, that with the Character which I hope I deservedly hold in the Publick Estimation, I should have accepted &pound;290 pr. Annum in lieu of all further Promotion or advantage?&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PRO 30/8/129/1, fols. 3&#150;4). He appended a list of &#145;Final Demands&#146;, including: companies for two sons in the army and civil employment for a third, &#145;full compensation for his Disappointments and Losses during the time he was abroad&#146;, a doubling of his annual allowance, and assurance that he would be appointed chief engineer in Britain when the position fell vacant. Pitt responded that he had already been amply rewarded for his services  (TNA: PRO, PRO 30/8/102, fols. 100&#150;01). For the next few years Debbieg submitted further petitions, lacing them with increasingly personal attacks on the prime minister and threatening to make the matter public, through either publication or parliament. When Pitt was unmoved, Debbieg published some correspondence relevant to the aftermath of his mission of 1767&#150;8 and his difficulties with Germain in 1775&#150;7. He appended notes on his career, highlighting alleged mistreatment, and here he referred to Pitt, but not harshly. This work, <span class="italic">Letters to and from Colonel Debbieg, to Several Great Men</span> (1790), appears to have been published in a very small printing, and to have attracted little notice.<br>
<br>Debbieg's last years were marked by advancement: he was promoted major-general on 12 October 1793, lieutenant-general on 1 January 1798, and general on 25 September 1803. Each promotion, however, came in association with a cohort, and did not reflect special favour. Debbieg was disappointed at being assigned to the invalid engineers (31 August 1799). On 15 March 1800 his pension was augmented, but this did not satisfy him, and he continued to press Pitt for fuller remuneration. Debbieg died at his residence, 52 Margaret Street, Cavendish Square, London, on 27 May 1810, aged seventy-eight. His wife had died on 23 March 1801; their three sons survived him. He died intestate, and his estate was valued at less than &pound;450, suggesting that his complaints of financial distress had not been exaggerated.<br>
