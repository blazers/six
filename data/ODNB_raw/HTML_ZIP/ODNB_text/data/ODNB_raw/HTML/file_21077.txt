<span class="headword">Packer,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1644&#150;1662), <span class="occ">army officer and deputy major-general</span>, entered the parliamentary army early in the civil war, and was a lieutenant in Cromwell's &#145;Ironsides&#146; in 1644. In the spring of that year he was put under arrest by Major-General Crawford for disobedience to orders, although the incident may have arisen from the presbyterian Crawford's known distaste for Packer's Particular Baptist views. Cromwell, however, strongly defended Packer as a &#145;Godly man&#146; and secured his release. Following Marston Moor, he held the rank of captain from 29 July 1644 to 29 April 1645. Originally named to the 9th regiment of horse in the New Model he was objected to by the Lords. He later exchanged places with Robert Swallow and became senior captain of the 1st regiment of horse, Fairfax's own regiment. He sided with the army in its quarrel with the parliament, but helped to quash Leveller agitation within the army in April 1648. During the second civil war he was present at the siege of Colchester. In November 1648 he was one of the officers selected for a committee charged with drafting a compromise version of the <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span> but took a prominent part in suppressing the Leveller-inspired mutinies of May 1649. At the battle of Dunbar he seems to have commanded Cromwell's own regiment of horse in the absence of its major, and took part in that flank attack on the Scottish army which decided the issue of the battle. In 1652 he became major of the regiment, and, as such, was colonel in all but name, receiving the salary and exercising all the functions of the office on behalf of Cromwell. Noted for his godliness, on 7 July 1653 he received a licence from the council of state authorizing him to preach in any pulpit in England, if it was not required at the time by its legal possessor. By 1652 he was allied with the London Fifth Monarchy preachers, but he broke with them when he failed to oppose the protectorate. He was on the commission to promote the gospel in Wales, became a trier, and served on a number of 1650s committees, including the Hale commission on law reform. In 1656 he acted as deputy major-general for Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, and Hertfordshire, and proceeded against Edmund Waller until the protector interfered on behalf of the poet.<br>
<br>By this time Packer had become a man of property, and bought, in conjunction with some other officers, the royal manor of Theobalds, Hertfordshire. George Fox mentions him as a great enemy to the Quakers, and describes an interview between himself and Packer. In Cromwell's second parliament he represented Woodstock; but he had become discontented with the policy of the protector, and joined the opposition in the parliament and the army. Cromwell, after failing to convince him of the error of his ways by argument, deprived him of his command. According to Packer's own account, his opposition to the revival of the House of Lords was the cause of his dismissal.<blockquote>I thought it was not &#145;a lord's house&#146;, but another house. But for my undertaking to judge this, I was sent for, accused of perjury, and outed of a place of 600<i>l</i>. per annum. &hellip; without any trial or appeal, with the breath of his nostrils I was outed, and lost not only my place, but a dear friend to boot. (<span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Burton</span>, 3.165)</blockquote>Packer was returned to Richard Cromwell's parliament for Hertford, but on a petition he was unseated. On the restoration of the purged &#145;rump&#146; of the Long Parliament in 1659, that assembly made Packer colonel of his old regiment, regarding him as a sufferer for republican principles; but having taken part in the promotion of a petition which the house considered dangerous, he was cashiered by vote of 12 October 1659. He consequently assisted Lambert to expel the parliament, and was one of the leaders of the army during the two months of military rule which followed. But the restoration of the Rump Parliament at the end of December put an end to his power; the command of his regiment was given to Sir Arthur Hesilrige, and Packer was ordered to leave London on pain of imprisonment. When Lambert escaped from the Tower, Packer was immediately seized and committed to prison (15 April 1660). The Restoration entailed upon him the loss of the lands he had purchased, and, though he escaped punishment, the government of Charles II considered him dangerous, and more than once arrested him on suspicion of plots. His wife, Elizabeth, petitioned for her husband's release in August 1661, stating that he had been for three months closely confined without being brought to trial. In May 1662 Packer was transferred from the Fleet prison to the Gatehouse. In September 1662 he was taken from king's bench prison and put on board the <i>Colchester</i> for Dublin Castle, where he arrived in October. His subsequent history and the date of his death are unknown.<br>
