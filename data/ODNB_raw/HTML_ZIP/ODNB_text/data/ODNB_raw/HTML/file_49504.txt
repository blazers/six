<span class="headword">Roughead,  William</span>  (1870&#150;1952), <span class="occ">writer on Scottish criminal trials</span>, was born at 61 South Clerk Street, Edinburgh, on 13 February 1870, the only child of John Carfrae Roughead (1837&#150;1887), a hosier, outfitter, and draper, and his wife, Amelia Shaw Nicol (1842&#150;1907). The family business had been founded in or about 1825 at premises in Princes Street, Edinburgh, by William Roughead's paternal grandfather, William Roughead (1795&#150;1868), whose firm held a number of royal warrants. John Carfrae Roughead succeeded to the family business in 1868, but (with one of his brothers) he was drowned when the steamship <i>Demerara</i> was lost, south of the Scilly Isles, in December 1887. His estate was valued at &pound;7736 and William Roughead &amp; Son was sold to assistants who had been working for the firm.<br>
<br>William Roughead was educated at Miss M. O. Cunningham's dame-school, 5 Duncan Street, Edinburgh, and Craigmount House School, Dick Place, Grange. In 1889 he enrolled at the arts faculty of Edinburgh University to study rhetoric and English language, but within a year he had changed to law. He successfully completed the first three years of his legal studies, but left in 1892 without completing the fourth and final year of his degree. Having already obtained articles with T. S. Maclaren and William Traquair, jun., at 11 Hill Street, Edinburgh, in 1893 Roughead used his inheritance to set himself up as a lawyer at 122 George Street, Edinburgh. However, because of his private means he never sought, or needed to seek, clients; and he had time to pursue his real interest.<br>
<br>While still at university Roughead had attended murder trials at the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh. The first of these was that of a baby farmer, Jessie King, in February 1889. He recollected this trial in his essay &#145;My First Murder&#146;, published in his book <span class="italic">In Queer Street</span> in 1932. In November 1889 he attended the trial of John Watson Laurie for the &#145;Arran murder&#146;. In July 1893 Roughead qualified as a Scottish lawyer by being admitted as a writer to the signet. Between 1889 and 1949 he attended almost all the significant murder trials in the Edinburgh High Court. He himself felt that he had missed only one: that of William Laurie King, for matricide, in 1924 when Roughead had been on holiday on the Isle of Arran. (He seldom travelled any farther and never went abroad.) Roughead was provided with his own reserved place and desk in the High Court, only once needing to don his gown to obtain admission&#151;to the trial of Alfred John Monson in 1893. He became &#145;the murderer's albatross&#146;  (Whittington-Egan, 10) and &#145;the greatest living exponent of the Calvinist attitude to evil&#146;  (Bridie, ix).<br>
<br>On 18 July 1900 Roughead married Janey Thomson More (1871/2&#150;1940), eldest daughter of Francis More, chartered accountant of Edinburgh. They had one daughter, Winifred (a Down's syndrome child, to whom Roughead was devoted). She died in 1929 aged twenty-eight. There were also three sons, one of whom, Frank, died from injuries received in a train crash, returning from visiting his father in 1947, thus embittering Roughead's final years.<br>
<br>Roughead's first book was a collection of light-hearted verses written for his friends: <span class="italic">Rhyme without Reason</span> (1901). It was not until 1906 that he took the first step in his career as the &#145;recording angel of Scottish matters criminous&#146;  (Goodman, 147). The initiative came from Harry Hodge, who had inherited the firm of William Hodge &amp; Co., a firm of legal publishers which he wanted to render more profitable. After his plan to publish an account of the trial of John Watson Laurie had encountered objections from Laurie's relatives he launched his series <span class="roman">Notable Scottish Trials</span> with the <span class="italic">Trial of Dr Pritchard</span>, a man for whom no relative&#151;even if still surviving&#151;could have felt any pity. Edward Pritchard (1825&#150;1865) had been found guilty of murdering his wife and his mother-in-law by poison, and he was the last person to be publicly executed in Glasgow. As with the proposed volume of the trial of Laurie, Roughead was chosen to be the editor. The volume separated fact from opinion by keeping the transcript of the trial separate from the editor's introduction. This format, which made the series much sought after among criminal lawyers and students of crime throughout the English-speaking world, allowed the reader to lose himself in the unfolding process of the trial.<br>
<br>Roughead went on to edit nine further volumes in the <span class="roman">Notable Scottish Trials</span> series, and the <span class="roman">Notable English Trials</span> series (both known as the <span class="roman">Notable British Trials</span> series after 1915). These were the cases of Deacon Brodie (1788, published in 1906); Captain Porteous (1736, published in 1909); Oscar Slater (1909, first published in 1910); Mrs McLachlan (1862, published in 1911; Roughead's favourite work); Mary Blandy (1752, published in 1914); Burke and Hare (1828, published in 1921); Katherine Nairn (1765, published in 1926); John Donald Merrett (1927, published in 1929); and John Watson Laurie (1889, published, at last, in 1932).<br>
<br>Roughead published <span class="italic">Twelve Scots Trials</span> in 1913. This was a collection of essays, including his first published account of the Arran murder. In the same year he began a long association with the <span class="italic">Juridical Review</span>. He published a total of seventy-five essays in the same journal over a period of twenty-eight years. Collections of these essays were published as books, the first appearing in 1919.<br>
<br>Three of the volumes edited by Roughead in the <span class="roman">Notable British Trials</span> series recorded trials which he had attended. Two of them, Oscar Slater in 1909 and John Donald Merrett in 1927, involved investigations which had been incompetently handled by the police. Roughead was the first to expose this misconduct and to subject it to the wintry irony which was his own characteristic form of wit. Roughead was one of those who gave evidence in 1928 when the newly established Scottish court of criminal appeal upheld Slater's appeal. In the case of John Donald Merrett (1908&#150;1954), the cavalier investigation by the Edinburgh police into Mrs Merrett's death (unconvincingly explained by her son as a suicide) led to relevant evidence's being lost or overlooked. The jury at Merrett's trial for the murder of his mother returned a verdict of &#145;not proven&#146; (although they unanimously convicted him of forging his mother's cheques). Roughead believed that Merrett owed his &#145;not proven&#146; verdict to the incompetence of the police and to the brilliance of his defence team (lead by Roughead's personal friend Craigie Aitchison). Writing in 1935 (in <span class="italic">Knave's Looking Glass</span>) he predicted that, although the public had not heard from Merrett for several years, &#145;We may do so yet&#146;. In 1954 Merrett (using the alias Chesney) murdered his wife and her mother and then committed suicide.<br>
<br>Roughead's wife died in 1940. His own death occurred on 11 May 1952 at Queen Mary Nursing Home, 27&#150;33 Chalmers Street, Edinburgh, of cerebral haemorrhage and pneumonia; he never regained consciousness after a fall down stairs five days earlier, at 12 Belgrave Crescent, Edinburgh, his home since 1922. His body was cremated free of charge at Warriston crematorium (where he had been a director) on 15 May. His ashes were buried at Grange cemetery, where Dr Pritchard's victims lay.<br>
<br>Roughead was a man of Pickwickian appearance, sensitive to any references to his baldness, and easily hurt by any unattributed reliance on his work. He excelled as a writer in that peculiarly Scottish province of the kingdom of letters, the recounting of criminal trials, not as a criminologist, still less as a psychologist, but, like Robert Louis Stevenson, as a &#145;Tusitala&#146;, a teller of tales. Writing in 1950 James Bridie observed that Roughead was &#145;a student of the bad&#146;, whose subjects &#145;would be &#147;nane the waur o a hangin&#148;. &hellip; [But] he has no indignation against his specimens. They are damned and cannot help it&#146;  (Bridie, xi&#150;xii).<br>
