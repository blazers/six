<span class="headword">Grabu,  Louis</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1665&#150;1694), <span class="occ">composer and musician</span>, was described as &#145;of Shalon [possibly Cape Salou] in Catalunnia&#146;, though he always seems to have been regarded as a Frenchman. He was appointed composer to Charles II on 31 March 1665, soon after his arrival in England. Three days later he was married in St James's Palace to Catherine de Loes &#145;of Paris&#146;. Almost a year later (25 March 1666) he was made master of the king's musick at the usual salary of &pound;200 a year, and successively displaced John Banister, first as leader of the king's band of twenty-four violins (24 December 1666), then as leader of the select band of twelve violins (14 March 1667). The reason for this rapid advancement is not clear, but it may have had something to do with complaints (which were upheld) that Banister had held back money due to the band and, according to Anthony Wood, &#145;for some saucy words spoken to his maj[esty], viz. when he [the king] called for the Italian violins, he made answer that he had better have the English&#146;  (Ashbee and Lasocki, 502). Not surprisingly Banister was peeved, and Pelham Humfrey gave his opinion to Samuel Pepys on 15 November 1667 that Grabu &#145;understands nothing nor can play on any instrument and so cannot compose&#146;  (Pepys, 8.530). Pepys was in two minds about him. The previous month, having heard an English song by Grabu he &#145;was never so little pleased with a consort of music in my life&#151;the manner of setting of words and repeating them out of order &hellip; makes me sick&#146;. On the other hand he had to admit that &#145;the instrumental music he had brought by practice to play very just&#146;  (ibid., 8.458).<br>
<br>For the marriage of the duke of York and Mary of Modena on 30 March 1674, Grabu seems to have rewritten and expanded the music for <span class="italic">Ariadne, or, The Marriage of Bacchus</span>, originally composed by Pierre Perrin; this was acted by the Royal Academy of Music at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden. The opera, however, was not a success, though whether this had anything to do with the quality of the music cannot be said since the music does not survive. For whatever reason (possibly as a result of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>), Grabu was replaced as master of the king's musick by Nicholas Staggins on 29 September 1675. He successfully petitioned the king for &pound;627 9<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. arrears of salary (5 May 1677), and, together with his wife and three small children, was granted a pass to go to France on 31 March 1679.<br>
<br>With the support of the duke of York, Grabu was back in England in the autumn of 1683, and wrote music for <span class="italic">A Pastoral in French</span>, engraved and published in 1684. He was also engaged to provide the music for John Dryden's opera <span class="italic">Albion and Albanius</span>, written to celebrate twenty-five years of the Restoration but thwarted by Charles II's death in February 1685, three months short of the anniversary. The fact that its performance in early June coincided with the duke of Monmouth's rebellion took some of the shine off the occasion; nor could the quality of the music&#151;or Dryden's treatment of the subject for that matter&#151;prolong the run beyond six nights. The music (published in 1687) is thoroughly French and outside the musical traditions of the English stage. At different times, however, Grabu did contribute songs and instrumental pieces to various plays, including Shadwell's <span class="italic">Timon of Athens</span> (1678), Lee's <span class="italic">Mithridates</span> (1678), <span class="italic">Oedipus</span> (1678) by Dryden and Lee, and Rochester's <span class="italic">Valentinian</span> (1684). Grabu remained in London until 3 December 1685, when he returned to Paris, but he was back in England again in 1687. His name appears in advertisements for a concert at &#145;Mr Smith's in Charles-Street, Covent Garden&#146; in 1694, but on 4 December that year he and his family were given passes to travel to either Holland or Flanders. Thereafter nothing is known about him.<br>
<br>Most writers, echoing Edward J. Dent, have been dismissive of Grabu as a composer, and although he came in for some public ridicule in his own time he was probably, all things considered, not so incompetent as has been suggested. Indeed, given that Locke was dead and Purcell had yet to prove himself as an opera composer, Dryden was perhaps no more than fair when he said: &#145;When any of our countrymen excel him, I shall be glad, for the sake of old England, to be shown my error; in the meantime, let virtue be commended, though in the person of a stranger&#146;  (<span class="italic">Albion and Albanius</span>, 1685, preface).<br>
