<span class="headword">Dowley,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1622, <em>d.</em> 1702), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, was baptized on 5 February 1622 at Burghfield, Berkshire, the son of John Dowley (<i>d</i>. in or after 1662), vicar of Alveston in Warwickshire. He matriculated from All Souls College, Oxford, on 10 October 1639, but in 1640 was admitted demy at Magdalen College, which he remained until 1648, graduating BA on 13 May 1643. At an unknown date he married; he is known to have had a family, but the names of his wife and children are unknown.<br>
<br>With the advent of civil war Dowley's father sent him to Coventry, where he continued his preparation for the pastoral ministry under the tutelage of John Bryan. While in Coventry he probably became acquainted with Richard Baxter, who had moved to the city in September 1642 after hostilities forced him to flee Kidderminster. Baxter was the designated preacher for the town's parliamentary garrison until he decided to join Edmund Whalley's regiment as a chaplain following the battle of Naseby in June 1645. After spending several years in Coventry Dowley accepted a position as chaplain to Sir Thomas Rous's family at Rous Lench in Worcestershire. On 26 April 1650 he became vicar of Bishampton in the same county. By 1655 he was the minister at Stoke Prior near Bromsgrove in Worcestershire. Baxter writes that &#145;Mr Dowley of Stoke&#146; was a member of the Worcestershire association and one of those &#145;meeting weekly at our Lecture, and monthly at our Disputation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, pt 1, p. 90).<br>
<br>Although both his father and his uncle Robert Dowley conformed at the Restoration, Dowley refused and was subsequently ejected from Stoke Prior on 24 August 1662. With the reinstatement of the sequestered minister John Toy, under the terms of the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>, he moved to Elford in Staffordshire where he is said to have assisted his uncle, who was minister there. He &#145;liv'd for some Time privately, went to Church, and apply'd himself to Country Business for a Subsistance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>, 169). His uncle's will of 3 May 1664 mentions that his &#145;cosen&#146; Richard was in possession of the &#145;messuage&#146; at Comberford, Staffordshire  (ibid.).<br>
<br>By the late 1660s Dowley maintained an active preaching ministry in Warwickshire villages such as Newton Regis, Austrey, and Shuttington despite government legislation against nonconformists. After the declaration of indulgence in 1672 he took out a licence as a presbyterian to preach at his house in Orton on the Hill in Leicestershire. About 1680 he moved to London, &#145;where he taught a school, and preached occasionally, attending on John Howe's ministry when not engaged himself&#146;. On one occasion in 1683 when Howe was holding a service the meeting was raided and Dowley was one of seven members of the congregation who were arrested and imprisoned in Newgate. They were examined by the lord mayor, after which they were indicted for inciting a riot and bound over until the next sessions. Dowley was subsequently fined &pound;10 for attending a conventicle and was forced to give up teaching. He was later arrested a second time. When he was once again brought before the lord mayor he took the Oxford oath rather than suffer imprisonment.<br>
<br>Following the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> of 24 May 1689, Dowley lived in London at Bird-in-Hand Alley, Cheapside. He took a position as minister at Godalming, Surrey, for which he received a grant from the Common Fund on 6 June 1692. He returned to London and lived with his children until his death in 1702.<br>
