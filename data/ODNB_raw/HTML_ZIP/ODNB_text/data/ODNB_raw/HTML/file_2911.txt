<span class="headword">Borough,  Christopher</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1579&#150;1587), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2914/', "Stephen Borough (1525&#150;1584)")</script>, a mariner, of Northam, Devon. Stephen and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2915/', "William Borough (bap. 1536, d. 1598)")</script> were both experienced navigators in European Arctic waters. Christopher acted as Russian interpreter for the sixth Muscovy Company trading venture, led by Arthur Edwards, which left Gravesend on 19 June 1579. The fleet arrived at St Nicholas (near the present port of Archangel) in the White Sea on 22 July and transferred to small craft for the journey up the northern Dvina and Sukhona rivers to Vologda. A short overland trek brought them to the Volga at Yaroslavl, where they again took ship. A month later, on 16 October, they reached Astrakhan, at the head of the delta, where they wintered. Leaving Edwards in charge at Astrakhan, Borough and his party embarked on 1 May 1580 on an English-built vessel headed into the Caspian Sea for the voyage south, making for Derbent, the chief emporium of that region. They were carried too far by adverse winds and stopped briefly near Baku before returning to Derbent, where they traded from 22 June to 3 October.<br>
<br>As his descriptions of Derbent and Baku show, Borough was fully aware of the growth of Turkish power at the expense of the former Persian domination on the shores of the Caspian Sea, a region then hardly known to Englishmen. His nautical training under his father and uncle led him to take a series of observations for latitude during his travels&#151;probably the earliest made with reasonable accuracy by Europeans in these parts.<br>
<br>At the end of the season the party picked up stragglers between Derbent and Baku, including two Spaniards who had escaped from captivity near Tunis, and returned to Astrakhan on 4 December. They wintered there, left the following April, and reached St Nicholas on 16 July 1581. The merchandise which they had acquired was embarked on the <i>William and John</i>, which arrived in the Thames on 25 September 1581. Borough's account of the venture, compiled from various letters and reports sent to the Muscovy Company and to his uncle, was published by Hakluyt in the first volume of his <i>Voyages</i> in 1582.<br>
<br>Borough remained in Russia when Edwards's party left, and he continued to visit the company's houses between St Nicholas and Astrakhan. He was certainly there in 1584, when he carried letters from Moscow to Yaroslavl, but probably went home soon afterwards, for a letter written in March 1586 by Queen Elizabeth to Tsar Feodor states that he was then in England.<br>
<br>It is likely that Borough returned again to Russia, as in 1587 he submitted a lengthy report to the Muscovy Company regarding their affairs, and particularly exposing the devious policy of Sir Jerome Horsey in Moscow, who was busy making his private fortune at the company's expense. Borough also spoke of Horsey's harsh treatment of J. Peacock and other agents sent by the company in 1585 to investigate these matters. He ended his report by recommending that the company should close its houses in Moscow and elsewhere and transfer all business and traffic to the house at St Nicholas, in order to prevent private trading and political intrigue.<br>
<br>Borough's linguistic expertise is shown by two manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, which he brought back and had elegantly bound in England, perhaps for presentation to Queen Elizabeth. MS Seld. superius III is an orthodox catechism, which includes elements of Church Slavonic Russian. MS Laud misc. 45 is a sixteenth-century copy of the pseudo-Aristotelian <span class="italic">Secret of Secrets</span>, written in Great Russian and signed twice by Borough, who may also have been the copyist. It is paginated with Europeanized arabic numerals and uses oriental arabic numerals in the text. Both manuscripts employ hyphens where words break at the ends of lines, and catch-words. These features were unknown in contemporary Russian scribal practice.<br>
<br>Borough had travelled with Persian merchants and lodged with them at Astrakhan. He had also recognized, and commented on, an Armenian inscription seen on the way to Astrakhan, and his writing reveals his general interest in languages and customs. The Bodleian manuscripts show that Borough was able to distinguish Church Slavonic and Great Russian from West Russian and Ukrainian. Nothing is known of Borough's later years, nor of the circumstances of his death.<br>
