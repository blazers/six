<span class="headword">Corder,  William</span>  (1804&#150;1828), <span class="occ">murderer</span>, was born in Polstead, Suffolk, on 22 June 1804, the son of John Corder, farmer, and his wife, Mary. He attended the local village school and then an academy at Hadleigh. At that time he was described as slender with a stoop. He took off for London and met up with some undesirable companions, among whom was Hannah Fandango, a young prostitute whose pimp was Samuel &#145;Beauty&#146; Smith. In 1824 his father summoned him home to work on the farm and there he met <a name="cosubject_18169"></a><span class="headword">Maria Marten</span>  (1801&#150;1827)<span class="occ"></span>, the daughter of a local mole-catcher. Maria had already borne an illegitimate, short-lived child fathered by William's brother, Thomas. William and Maria soon produced another child, which lived only two weeks. On his frequent visits to the house where Maria still lived with her parents, Corder was pressed to marriage by Maria's father and stepmother, Anne, and to this he agreed. His disreputable friends from London then embarrassingly turned up in Polstead. Corder convinced Maria that the police were searching for her in connection with the illegitimate children and that they must run away secretly to escape them. She dressed in male attire and took with her female garments. Both were seen leaving the Martens' house on 18 May 1827 separately in the direction of the barn where they had conducted their courting and which was to become notorious as the &#145;Red Barn&#146;. There Corder murdered Maria, by shooting her with a pistol, stabbing her many times with a knife, and finally suffocating her with her own handkerchief. He continued to visit the Martens and put forward various and conflicting excuses for Maria's absence, saying she was the companion to a lady in Yarmouth or Ipswich and too busy to write, then that they were going to London to be married, and later that they were married and living in the Isle of Wight. Mrs Marten then began to have dreams that Maria's body was buried in the barn and a search in April 1828 revealed that this was indeed so.<br>
<br>Corder had by now married at St Andrew's, Holborn, in November 1827, a respectable schoolmistress, Mary Moore; he had placed an advertisement in the <span class="italic">Morning Herald</span> of 13 November 1827, which generated an enormous response. Mrs Corder had set up a school for ladies in Brentford, and there Corder was arrested and brought for trial at Bury St Edmunds. The trial was a public sensation, and extensively reported in <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Corder pleaded not guilty, and said that Maria had shot herself and died while he was seeking help; he claimed to have hidden her body through fear of a murder accusation. However, a great deal of evidence was brought forward to prove his guilt. Chief Baron Alexander summed up against Corder and the jury brought in a guilty verdict. In court Corder, who was said to be aged about forty (but who was in fact twenty-four), and who was 5 feet 5 inches tall, with fair hair, a large mouth and eyes, and a turned-up nose, appeared in a frock coat with a velvet collar, black waistcoat, and blue trousers. He was hanged on 11 August 1828, having admitted his guilt and asking his wife's forgiveness. She had been regularly in court and visited him assiduously in gaol.<br>
<br>The execution was witnessed by a huge crowd, estimated at ten thousand; even more came to listen to sermons preached near the Red Barn. On 12 August Corder's body was dissected and anatomized for the benefit of students at the University of Cambridge. It was then flayed, the skin tanned, and the skeleton preserved in the local hospital where the surgeon, George Creed, carried out the autopsy. The skeleton, from which it is possible that the skull was removed and replaced by that of an unknown person, ended up in the Hunterian Museum in London. The real skull is reputed to have changed hands many times, bringing with it bad luck to any owner. The tanned skin was used to cover a book by James Curtis about the crime; the Moyse's Hall Museum, Bury St Edmunds, had the object, along with other relics such as Corder's scalp and a replica of the death mask (the original of which was in Norwich Castle), at the end of the twentieth century. In August 2004 the skeleton was removed from the Hunterian Museum and cremated. The ashes were buried in the churchyard of St Mary's, Polstead, where Maria Marten's body was also buried.<br>
<br>The murder was the subject of various contemporary peepshow productions, including one by Lord George Sanger, and many broadsheets (for example those published by J. Catnach) and &#145;penny dreadfuls&#146;. Ceramics of the Red Barn were also made shortly after the trial. A &#145;serial&#146; book by W. Maginn entitled <span class="italic">The Red Barn</span> appeared in 1828. Theatrical performances on the subject were widely given, such as <span class="italic">The Red Farm, or, The Well of St Marie</span>, adapted from the French of D'Ennery and Lemoine by W. T. Moncrieff and first produced at Sadler's Wells on 29 August 1842. Another play on the subject of the murder was put on at the Elephant and Castle in the 1920s. A film was made by MGM in 1935, <span class="italic">Maria Marten, or, The Murder at the Red Barn</span>. A melodrama by Brian J. Burton, <span class="italic">The Murder of Maria Marten, or, The Red Barn</span>, was published in 1964. These works, along with a stream of novels and non-fiction, testify to the lasting impact of this sordid crime.<br>
