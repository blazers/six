<span class="headword">Wigginton,  Giles</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1564&#150;1597), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious activist</span>, was a native of Oundle in Northamptonshire. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1564 under the patronage of Sir Walter Mildmay. He was elected a scholar in 1566 and graduated BA in 1569, being elected to a fellowship of the college despite the vigorous opposition of the master John Whitgift, who was already suspicious of Wigginton's puritan sympathies. He took the degree of MA in 1572 and established a reputation for his scholarship in Greek and Hebrew. His puritan views were accompanied by a controversial wit which further alienated Whitgift, who, he alleged, kept him from all college offices and preferments. Wigginton never overcame his sense of injustice at his treatment by Whitgift, so much so that in the mid-1580s, on being offered a handshake by Godfrey Goldsborough, one of Whitgift's prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, he shrank from it &#145;as if he had been a serpent, because I knew him to be a corrupt, prophane, proud, nonresident, pluralist pseudo-hierarchist&#146;  (Peel, 2.246), an account which is revealing of Wigginton's combative nature. His religious views appear to have attracted the attention of the puritans at Dedham, who tried unsuccessfully to have him appointed to the living there in 1576 or 1577, but in 1579 his college appointed him to the vicarage at Sedbergh in the Yorkshire dales, where his energies could be expended against the common enemy of popery.<br>
<br>Wigginton's character, as much as his views, soon attracted the attention of ecclesiastical authority in the north, and in 1581 Archbishop Edwin Sandys wrote of him that &#145;he laboureth not to build, but to put down, and by what means he can to overthrow the state ecclesiastical&#146;  (Peck, 115). Wigginton had powerful support among a section of the puritan gentry, and on a visit to London in 1584 he was invited to preach before the judges in the church of St Dunstan-in-the-West. News of this came to the notice of his old Cambridge adversary John Whitgift, by now archbishop of Canterbury, who sent an order in the dead of night forbidding him to preach and requiring him under bond to appear before him at Lambeth the next day. There Wigginton was tendered the <i>ex officio</i> oath to answer articles as yet undeclared, and on his refusal to take the oath, he was committed to gaol in the Gatehouse, where he remained for nine weeks. On his release he was forbidden to preach in the southern province and returned north to his living. Whitgift continued to pursue him, and on the word of an informant ordered Sandys to initiate proceedings against Wigginton. This Sandys did and Giles was deprived of his living by William Chaderton, bishop of Chester, in 1585. Despite this reputation Wigginton's pastoral involvement bore fruit, and a report on his parish at about that time suggests that he had brought the people of the place to an understanding of reformed principles and practice. This may have owed something to the short catechism he had compiled for his parishioners, which he may have published in 1589 and which was definitely published by his grandson in 1646 as <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Christian Faith</span>.<br>
<br>Following deprivation Wigginton found himself in York during the trial of the Catholic martyr Margaret Clitherow, with whom he entered into discussion in her prison cell. In the course of the trial he is said to have intervened on her behalf in open court, contesting the legitimacy of the proceedings, and after her sentence he again attempted to persuade her to renounce her views. Wigginton then moved on to London where he once again fell foul of his implacable opponent Whitgift. Brought before the archbishop and again refusing the <i>ex officio</i> oath, Wigginton once more found himself in prison, this time the White Lion, and also in chains. Removed to another prison he was degraded from orders, despite the intervention on his behalf of the earls of Warwick and Huntingdon. Wigginton left London on his release and returned to his home town of Oundle where he joined and took a leading role within a group of radical dissenters in the town who withdrew from the parish church to nearby Stoke Doyle, where the squire, Anthony Palmer, was sympathetic. This group, which included the schoolmaster Robert Pamphlin and William Hacket, a local maltster, disrupted the religious life of the town considerably in the years up to 1590.<br>
<br>Wigginton had not severed his connections with the north and returned intermittently to his former parish at Sedbergh where he preached unlicensed. While in Yorkshire, Wigginton was arrested and imprisoned in Lancaster gaol from where, on 27 February 1587, he sought the help of his old patron Mildmay. His treatment by Whitgift figured largely in the first of the Marprelate tracts, <span class="italic">The Epistle</span>, and this fact, along with his former reputation, made him one of the first suspects for the authorship. He was arraigned before the high commission on 6 December 1588, when he again refused the oath and found himself imprisoned in the Gatehouse once more. Though not the author of the Marprelate tracts Wigginton did pen lively accounts of his earlier confrontations with Whitgift which survive in manuscript and may have provided the Marprelate source, and he appears also to have transcribed some separatist writings at this time. While in prison he composed a &#145;Treatise on predestination&#146; and, more in keeping with his style, he also compiled a mock set of visitation articles, purporting to emanate from Whitgift, in which he set out the agenda of the godly while pillorying the archbishop. Wigginton remained in prison for some time and was visited there by his former associate from Oundle William Hacket, whose frenzied response to the crisis within puritanism following the arrest of the leaders of the classes was to prove disastrous. Through Wigginton, Hacket made the acquaintance of Edmund Copinger and they, with Henry Arthington, embarked on the series of events that led to the announcement of the second coming, followed by the suicide of Copinger and the execution of Hacket in July 1591. The extent of Wigginton's knowledge and involvement in what was to prove a calamity to the puritan cause remains obscure, but he is credited with authorship of a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Fool's Bolt</span>, distributed by the conspirators, and the authorities were quick to implicate him in the events.<br>
<br>Wigginton was released from prison and sought the support of Burghley in trying unsuccessfully to regain his old living at Sedbergh. His movements thereafter remain obscure: he wrote to Burghley on 4 April 1597 outlining plans for a college to train clergy to engage in controversy with the Roman Catholic missioners and presenting him with a manuscript treatise written against the papists, and in the same year he was presented for preaching unlicensed in his brother's Northamptonshire parish of Collingtree and for disturbing the incumbent of the nearby parish of Blisworth by, characteristically, rushing into the pulpit to preach a sermon of his own. With that he disappears from the record, possibly to the anonymity of his old stamping ground in London where a daughter of his was baptized, at Stratford Bow, later that year.<br>
