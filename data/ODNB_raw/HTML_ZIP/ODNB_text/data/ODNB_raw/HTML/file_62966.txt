<span class="headword">O'Donnell,  Frank Hugh</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Francis Hugh MacDonald]</span>  (1846&#150;1916), <span class="occ">writer and controversialist</span>, was born in an army barracks in Devonport, Devon, on 9 October 1846, the elder son of Sergeant Bernard MacDonald and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kain, daughter of William Kain or O'Cahan of Ballybane, co. Galway. His younger brother was Charles James MacDonald, later O'Donnell (1849&#150;1934). He was educated at the Erasmus School, Galway, St Ignatius College, Galway, and Queen's College, Galway, graduating MA in 1868 with gold medals in English literature, history, and political economy. MacDonald probably assumed the name by which he was known as an expression of his belief that he was a direct descendant of Roderick O'Donnell, last earl of Tyrconnell. Frank Hugh O'Donnell had a brief career as a journalist on the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> (he shared a bed with T. P. O'Connor in his early days in London), and was elected MP (nationalist) for Galway in 1874, but unseated on petition, becoming MP for Dungarvan, co. Waterford, in 1877, holding the seat until 1885, when his constituency disappeared during redistribution. A controversial figure in parliament, he was &#145;silenced&#146; in June 1880 by Gladstone and was known as Crank Hugh O'Donnell. O'Donnell, who had hoped to lead the Irish party and who claimed to have invented the policy of obstruction, opposed the Land League and abandoned orthodox politics in 1885. <i>O'Donnell v. Walter</i>&#151;his unsuccessful action against <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1888, when he had sought &pound;50,000 in damages for libel&#151;resulted in the parliamentary special commission into Parnellism and crime in 1888&#150;9 and the exposure of the Pigott forgeries. O'Donnell was hostile to Parnell and remained aggressively anti-Parnellite. O'Donnell's <span class="italic">A History of the Irish Parliamentary Party</span> (2 vols., 1910) is biased and untrustworthy, grossly inflating his own role; however it contains vivid characterization of&#151;<i>inter alia</i>&#151;Michael Davitt and John O'Leary.<br>
<br>O'Donnell was initiated into the Irish Republican Brotherhood by Dr Mark Ryan, the London Fenian leader, and subsequently moved to the Irish National Alliance. O'Donnell's Fenian career was as chequered as his parliamentary career had been. In 1897 he embarrassed his colleagues by pseudonymously running a series of articles in <span class="italic">United Ireland</span> purporting to be from a revolutionary organization called &#145;Fuath na Gall&#146; (hatred of the stranger). In 1898 he issued, under an Irish National Alliance signature, a pamphlet attacking Michael Davitt as a renegade and British agent. Maud Gonne and W. B. Yeats had this pamphlet repudiated. O'Donnell's retaliation came with the first performance of Yeats's <span class="italic">The Countess Cathleen</span> in May 1899. O'Donnell issued another pamphlet, <span class="italic">Souls for Gold!</span>, viciously attacking the play as anti-Catholic and anti-Irish, guaranteeing a controversial reception. In <span class="italic">The Stage-Irishman of the neo-Celtic Drama</span> (1904) O'Donnell returned to the attack, describing Yeats's plays as the &#145;wedding of Madame Blavatsky and Finn MacCumhail&#146;  (p. 9).<br>
<br>O'Donnell's source of income remains unclear, although he was a prolific freelance journalist. He probably worked as an agent for a number of powers&#151;Maud Gonne thought him a spy for Britain and W. B. Yeats thought him an Austrian agent&#151;and he lived for various periods in France, Austria, and Germany. During 1900 when O'Donnell, like other Irish nationalists, was pro-Boer, he promised to mobilize British working-class opposition to the war, via the National Democratic League, if a large enough sum of money were paid to him by the Transvaal government. He also claimed to have prevented 50,000 Irishmen from enlisting in the English army. O'Donnell succeeded in obtaining the considerable sum of &pound;4500 from the Transvaal government for pro-Boer activities&#151;there is no evidence that the whole sum was passed on to Irish organizations. Despite his eccentricity and dishonesty, O'Donnell was not expelled from the Irish National Alliance, even when, in April 1900, he circulated letters naming Irishmen whom Maud Gonne had enlisted for the Boer cause. He finally alienated himself from nationalists by publishing <span class="italic">At the Sign of the Harp and the Guillotine</span>, a pamphlet which attacked Wolfe Tone and the other 1798 leaders for destroying the Irish parliament. The <span class="italic">United Irishman</span> disowned him in June 1900 and later referred to him as &#145;Chevalier of the Order of Ananias and Sappira &hellip; High Shepherd of the Golden Fleecers and Grand Master of the Knights of the Black Mail&#146;  (21 Sept 1901, 3). Mark Ryan's judgement was that O'Donnell had &#145;no fixed political convictions&#146;  (Ryan, 62&#150;3).<br>
<br>O'Donnell became vehemently anti-clerical, while still professing himself a good Catholic. He wrote books and pamphlets attacking the political power of the Irish Catholic clergy, including <span class="italic">The Ruin of Education in Ireland</span> (1902) and <span class="italic">Paraguay on Shannon: the Price of a Political Priesthood</span> (1908). He became an advocate for secular mixed education&#151;reversing the stance of his <span class="italic">Mixed Education in Ireland: Confessions of a Queen's Collegian</span> (1870)&#151;but his coarse rhetoric was probably counter-productive.<br>
<br>To T. P. O'Connor, the young O'Donnell had seemed like &#145;a figure from Balzac: one of the self-confident adventurers, like Lucien de Rubempr&eacute;&#146; and he regretted &#145;the miserable downfall in which his career ended&#146;  (O'Connor, 1.68, 70). W. B. Yeats was to characterize O'Donnell as a &#145;mad rogue&#146; and as &#145;half genius, half sewer-rat&#146;, recalling this distinguished-looking man transforming himself into a &#145;half-drunken Country Councillor shaking his fist in an opponent's face&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Letters</span>, 2, 80, 712, 710).<br>
<br>Most of O'Donnell's life was spent out of Ireland and he settled in London, dying there unmarried on 2 November 1916. He was buried in Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin. Despite his facility as a writer and speaker and a life dedicated to political activity, O'Donnell remains a marginal figure in Irish history.<br>
