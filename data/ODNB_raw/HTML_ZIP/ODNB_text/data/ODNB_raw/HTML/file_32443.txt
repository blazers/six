<span class="headword">Clerk, Sir  George Russell</span>  (1874&#150;1951), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 29 November 1874 in India, the only son of General Sir Godfrey Clerk (1835&#150;1908), army officer, later commandant of the rifle brigade and groom-in-waiting to Queen Victoria and Edward VII, and his wife, Alice Mary, daughter of William Edward Frere, of the Bombay civil service; his grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5614/', "Sir George Russell Clerk (1800&#150;1889)")</script>, East India Company servant. He was educated at Eton College and at New College, Oxford, where he received a third class in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1897). After studying foreign languages abroad, he passed the Foreign Office entrance examination in December 1898.<br>
<br>Clerk served in March&#150;April 1901 as acting third secretary to the duke of Abercorn's special mission to the courts of northern Europe, announcing the accession of Edward VII. In April 1903 he was posted, at his own request, to Abyssinia, where the British agency was no more than a group of round tuguls with thatched roofs and mud and wattle walls. He was twice left in charge and learnt Amharic before being recalled owing to ill health. He was promoted to second secretary in February 1907 and to assistant clerk in May 1907, and again served at the Foreign Office from May 1907 to October 1910. In the latter month he was promoted to first secretary and posted to the embassy at Constantinople, and in his spare time learned Turkish. In February 1912 he returned to the Foreign Office, where he was promoted in October 1913 to senior clerk and head of the Eastern department. On 16 June 1908 he had married (Janet) Muriel Whitwell, an accomplished artist, and daughter of Edward Robson Whitwell, of Yarm-on-Tees, Yorkshire. They had no children.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of war in 1914 Clerk was appointed head of the Foreign Office's new war department, which combined the pre-war regional departments covering Europe. He was promoted counsellor in December 1916. He worked closely with the secretary to the war cabinet, Maurice Hankey, forming one of his most important official relationships. In January 1917 he attended the conference in Rome at which the allies' overall campaign strategy for the year was planned. Later that month he accompanied Lord Milner on his mission to Russia. From January to September 1919 he was private secretary to Lord Curzon, the acting foreign secretary, and, with many of the senior officials in attendance at the Paris peace conference, he was in effect under-secretary. In August 1919 he was himself sent to Paris to serve as secretary to the foreign secretary, Sir Arthur Balfour.<br>
<br>In September 1919 Clerk was appointed the first British minister to the new Czechoslovak state. First, however, he was sent on a special mission by the peace conference to Bucharest and Budapest, to secure the evacuation of the Romanian army from Hungary. During a stay in Budapest from October to December 1919, he witnessed the removal of the Romanian army, which in turn opened the way for the entry of the White forces under Admiral Horthy. Clerk's anti-Bolshevism made him tolerant of Horthy and the &#145;White terror&#146; he unleashed upon Hungary, and his association with the admiral became controversial. In his defence, it was argued that his attitude was dictated by necessity since there was little choice but to use these forces if order was to be restored in the country.<br>
<br>Throughout the war Clerk had advocated the dismemberment of the Habsburg empire and had been sympathetic to the views of the <span class="italic">New Europe</span> group led by R. W. Seton-Watson. This connection led him to become acquainted with many of eastern Europe's future leaders. The decision to send him to Prague was inspired in part by his good relations with President Masaryk. Clerk did much to establish a good diplomatic atmosphere in Prague, and he was one of the few British ministers to sympathize with the Czechoslovaks over their efforts to handle the minorities question. He was less successful in his aspiration to make Czechoslovakia a centre for British influence in central Europe, when Curzon decided to swing away from Prague to Budapest. Arguments with the British ministers to Budapest and Vienna over policy also marked Clerk's tenure.<br>
<br>In November 1926 Clerk was appointed ambassador to Turkey and once again he was called upon to improve a strained diplomatic relationship. He succeeded in bringing about a rapprochement in Anglo-Turkish relations, damaged not only by the First World War but also by Britain's subsequent support for Greece's invasion in 1919 and compounded by a longer-lasting distrust of the Turkish leader, Kemal Atat&uuml;rk. Clerk could have expected a major embassy, such as Berlin, as his next posting, but he received instead the minor embassy at Brussels, in October 1933. A few months later, however, in April 1934, he was the surprise choice to become ambassador to Paris in succession to Lord Tyrrell. Clerk's tenure of the Paris embassy witnessed the prelude to the Second World War. Acting upon instructions Clerk played an important role during the Spanish Civil War when, in a meeting with the foreign minister, Yvon Delbos, on 7 August 1936, he helped to convince the French government to adopt the British policy of non-intervention. None the less, Clerk was one of the group of ambassadors, including Horace Rumbold and Eric Phipps, who were alive to, and warned of, the threat from Germany. As ambassador he was a notable host and particularly enjoyed entertaining members of the French aristocracy at the Jockey Club in Paris. Lady Clerk, with whom his relationship was often strained, preferred informality as much as her husband preferred formality.<br>
<br>Clerk retired from the diplomatic service in April 1937 and became an active member of the Royal Geographical Society, serving as president during the difficult war years of 1941&#150;5. He played an important role in overseeing the transition from the age of exploration to that of the scholarly study of detail. A cigar smoker, he was a passionate fisherman, stag hunter, polo player, card player, and lover of books. Harold Nicolson, who served under him, observed that the habitually tidy Clerk &#145;was impervious to disturbance; he would have mounted the scaffold with the same imperturbability as he mounted the steps of the Turf Club, his spats and monocle shining in the summer air&#146;  (Nicolson, 859). An apparent dilettantism masked a forceful personality which enabled Clerk either to smooth previously ruffled feelings, as he did in Prague and Turkey, or to implement difficult policies, as he did in Budapest, or to see to the efficient administration of a wartime department, as he did during the First World War. He was appointed CMG (1908), CB (1914), KCMG (1917), PC (1926), and GCMG (1929). He held the grand cordon of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur from France and decorations from Italy, Russia, and Czechoslovakia. He died at 29 Cleveland Gardens, Paddington, London, on 18 June 1951. A funeral service was held at Golders Green, and a memorial service at St Margaret's, Westminster, London.<br>
