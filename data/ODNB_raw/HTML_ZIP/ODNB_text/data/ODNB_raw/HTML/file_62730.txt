<span class="headword">Moore,  (Lilian) Decima</span>  (1871&#150;1964), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 11 December 1871 at 21 Regency Square, Brighton, one of the family of nine daughters (three of whom died in childhood) and one son of Edward Henry Moore, chemist, and his wife, Emily Strachan. Her sisters Eva (1870&#150;1955) and Jessie (<i>d</i>. 1910) were also successful actresses. She was educated at Miss Pringle's school in Brighton, and sang in the church choir; she won a scholarship to Blackheath Conservatory. At seventeen she approached Richard D'Oyly Carte at the Savoy Theatre for a voice trial, and was offered the part of Casilda in the original production of <span class="italic">The Gondoliers</span>, the last great success of the partnership of W. S. Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan, which opened on 7 December 1889 and ran for eighteen months with 554 performances. She took part in the command performance before Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle on 6 March 1891, the first theatrical entertainment to take place at court since the death of Prince Albert thirty years earlier. After her success as Casilda she appeared in another operetta, <span class="italic">Captain Billy</span>, at the Savoy Theatre. This opened in June 1891 and when it closed in January 1892 she moved on to take over the title role in the comic opera <span class="italic">Miss Decima</span> by F. C. Durand at the Criterion Theatre, and acted in <span class="italic">A Pantomime Rehearsal</span> by Cecil Clay at the Royal Court before heading the cast of <span class="italic">The Wedding Eve</span>, and starring in the title role in a revival of <span class="italic">Dorothy</span> by B. C. Stephenson. Returning to the Savoy Theatre in May 1893, she played the schoolgirl Bab in <span class="italic">Jane Annie</span>, a new comic opera, with a libretto by J. M. Barrie and Arthur Conan Doyle and music by Ernest Ford, which was poorly received and closed after six weeks.<br>
<br>Moore came under the influence of the theatre manager George Edwardes when she created the ing&eacute;nue role of Rose Brierly in <span class="italic">A Gaiety Girl</span> by Owen Hall, with music by Sidney Jones, one of the first of the new musical comedies; it opened at the Prince of Wales Theatre on 14 October 1893 and ran for eleven months. She remained in the cast of <span class="italic">A Gaiety Girl</span> when Edwardes sent the company to New York in September 1894 for a two-month season on Broadway, with Granville Bantock as musical director, before touring the United States, covering eight more American cities in four months. While in New York she married, on 18 September 1894, Ceil Ainslie Walker-Leigh. When the company moved on to Australia she starred as Bessie Brent in <span class="italic">The Shop Girl</span> by H. W. Dam (music by Ivan Caryll and Lionel Monckton) and the Prima Donna of the Ambiguity Theatre in <span class="italic">In Town</span> by Adrian Ross and J. T. Tanner, when these were added to the repertory.<br>
<br>After returning to England, Moore left Edwardes and pursued a singing career in the theatre for the next ten years, starring in <span class="italic">The White Silk Dress</span> by A. McLean (1896) at the Prince of Wales Theatre; <span class="italic">Lost, Strayed or Stolen</span> (1897); Sir Arthur Sullivan's operetta <span class="italic">The Rose of Persia</span> (1899) at the Savoy Theatre; and the musical comedy <span class="italic">Florodora</span> (1900&#150;01) by Owen Hall at the Lyric Theatre. She played the Swineherd in the Christmas musical <span class="italic">The Swineherd and the Princess</span> (1901) at the Royalty Theatre, toured in the 1902 production of <span class="italic">The Gay Cadets</span>, and took the role of Alice Coverdale in <span class="italic">My Lady Molly</span> by G. H. Jessop (music by Sidney Jones) (1903), which ran for 341 performances. She and her husband separated in 1902 and divorced two years later; they had a son.<br>
<br>On 15 August 1905 Moore married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33599/', "Sir (Frederick) Gordon Guggisberg (1869&#150;1930)")</script>, son of Frederick Guggisberg, merchant, of Galt, Ontario, Canada. She was his second wife. Guggisberg, an officer in the Royal Engineers, was appointed director of surveys in the Gold Coast in 1905, returning to England in 1908. She accompanied him to the Gold Coast, and together they published an account of their survey journeys, <span class="italic">We Two in West Africa</span> (1909). When in England she made occasional appearances in the theatre, but no longer in musicals; she appeared in Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">The Vision of Delight</span> in 1908, his masque <span class="italic">The Hue and Cry after Cupid</span> in 1911, and for the last time on the London stage in a matin&eacute;e performance of <span class="italic">Vantage out</span> in 1914.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the First World War Guggisberg rejoined the army, and Decima Moore set up the Women's Emergency Corps, a clearing-house for women's voluntary war work, with its headquarters at the Little Theatre. Thousands of women enrolled, ready to be called on to meet any emergency. She attached herself to the French army in January 1915, and ran the Leave Club in Paris for British soldiers. After the armistice, she was one of the first women to enter Cologne, where she organized a club for the army of occupation, before travelling across the battlefields, from Ypres to Verdun. She was appointed CBE and awarded the overseas medal and the <span class="italic">M&eacute;daillon de reconnaissance</span>.<br>
<br>In 1919 Guggisberg was appointed governor of the Gold Coast and Moore intermittently spent time there with him until 1925. She did not accompany him to British Guiana, where he was governor from 1928 until his resignation in 1929. Guggisberg died in 1930, and his widow lived on until her death, aged ninety-three, on 18 February 1964 at 92 Redcliffe Gardens, London.<br>
