<span class="headword">Emmison,  Frederick George <span class="st"> [Derick]</span></span>  (1907&#150;1995), <span class="occ">archivist</span>, was born at 35 Sandhurst Road, Bedford, on 28 May 1907, son of George Emmison, a telegraph clerk with the London, Midland, and Scottish Railway, and his wife, Kate Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Field (<i>d</i>. 1967). A bright boy, inspired by his father with a love of history, he gained a scholarly reputation at Bedford modern school with every expectation of a place at Cambridge University to follow. Unhappily, family circumstances prevented this progression and in 1925 he started work, entering the employ of Bedfordshire county council. Here what must have been disappointment was promptly replaced by opportunity. Appointed the county's first clerk of the records, the young Emmison acquired as his mentor and profited from the experienced guidance of Dr G. H. Fowler, chairman of the county records committee and justifiably acknowledged as the &#145;father of local archives&#146;.<br>
<br>Under this tutelage Emmison gained a thorough grounding in archive administration and absorbed the crucial concept of the broad-based county record office. &#145;It was my singular fortune&#146;, he reminisced later in life, &#145;to be trained in the late 1920s as the first local archivist&#146;  (personal knowledge). He soon gained a reputation for his imaginative and energetic approach to his pioneering endeavours. The Bedford years saw many initiatives, not least his wholehearted policies of record survey. That he was from the first a doer as well as a thinker is evidenced in his report of conducting the pursuit of a survey of Bedfordshire parish records by visiting, mainly by bicycle, &#145;over one hundred churches on forty-five Saturdays as a voluntary scheme&#146;  (ibid.). In 1935 he married Margaret, daughter of Dr Hamilton Langwill, with whom he had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>The defining event in Derick Emmison's career came in August 1938 with his appointment as the first county archivist of Essex. His opportunities to lead, to influence, to proselytize, became more fully realizable and he set himself to make Essex Record Office pre-eminent in its field and an inspiration to and model for county record offices to come. He remained in post until he retired in 1969, creating in due time the largest English county record office in terms of staffing, size and range of collections, accommodation, and of always steady and at times spectacular increases in user numbers. Meantime his seemingly boundless energy generated a ceaseless flow of often influential initiatives, especially in the related fields of education and publication. He achieved the appointment of the first full-time education officer to an archives service and the lease of part of Ingatestone Hall for major annual exhibitions and facilities for school classes and group visits. Characteristically Derick and Margaret endowed an annual prize for a study based on historical research in original sources by Essex schoolchildren. The Essex Record Office publications programme, begun in 1946, has often been emulated but never yet surpassed, constituting another key legacy in the provision of archive services and the furtherance of local studies.<br>
<br>Far from content with leading by example, Emmison involved himself in the work of numerous organizations, national and local, pertinent to archives and local studies. He was a founder member in 1932 of the British Records Association and in 1947 of the Society of Local Archivists, and was for many years prominent in the British Records Society, the Historical Association, and the Society of Genealogists, being honoured by office in these and many local bodies. It is, indeed, arguable that his most important contribution to the cause of local archives lay in his talent as a publicist and his instinctive ability to enthuse a wider than specialist audience. No one did more to establish in the public mind an awareness of what the local record office could and should be. The quiet post-war revolution in the availability of and access to the &#145;nation's memory&#146; would assuredly have been quieter and less profound without him.<br>
<br>For Emmison, busy as he was with professional concerns, the professional and the scholarly always marched hand in hand. His work as researcher and writer began as early as 1927 and ceased only with his death. His most substantial publications are his <span class="italic">Guide to the Essex Record Office</span>, parts 1 and 2 (1946&#150;8); <span class="italic">Catalogue of Maps in the Essex Record Office</span> and supplements thereto (1947, 1952, 1964, 1968); <span class="italic">Elizabethan Life</span> (5 vols., 1970&#150;80)&#151;all in the <span class="roman">Essex Record Office Publications</span> series; <span class="italic">Wills at Chelmsford, 1620&#150;1720</span> and <span class="italic">1721&#150;1858</span> (British Records Society, 79 and 84; 1959, 1969); <span class="italic">Tudor Secretary: Sir William Petre at Court and at Home</span> (1961); <span class="italic">Archives and Local History</span> (1966); and <span class="italic">Essex Wills</span> (from 1558), of which ten of the projected twelve volumes were published by the New England Historical Genealogical Society, Boston, USA, between 1982 and 1995.<br>
<br>Emmison's achievements were duly honoured. He was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and of the Royal Historical Society. In 1966 he was made an MBE and in 1970 an honorary doctorate was conferred on him by the University of Essex. He was awarded in 1974 the Julian Bickersteth medal of the Institute of Heraldic and Genealogical Studies, and the Historical Association gave him in 1987 its Medlicott medal &#145;for outstanding service to history, both in the record office field and as a local historian&#146;. Derick Emmison died from pancreatic cancer in Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford, on 9 November 1995 and was buried at Chelmsford following cremation.<br>
