<span class="headword">Layard,  Nina Frances</span>  (1853&#150;1935), <span class="occ">poet and archaeologist</span>, was born on 20 August 1853 at Stratford Green, Essex, fourth child of Charles Clement Layard (1817&#150;1895), Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Somes (1817&#150;1886). In childhood an avid egg and shell collector, she lived at Wembley and Harrow rectories 1858&#150;73, and attended a dame-school in Willesden, Middlesex. Of distinguished Huguenot ancestry, her father's cousins Sir A. H. Layard, E. L. Layard, and Lady Charlotte Guest were inspirational examples, and Matthew Arnold encouraged her earliest poetry. The family moving to Combe-Hay rectory, Bath, in 1873, she spent many solitary hours collecting, and despite having a weak constitution travelled round the world via New Zealand in 1878&#150;9. She became aware of the fossil kingdom in 1882, and began serious collecting and reading under the guidance of Leonard Jenyns and John Ellor Taylor.<br>
<br>Having published minor critiques of the theory of rudiments in evolution, Layard moved permanently, with private means, to Ipswich in 1889, presented the first paper by a woman to the Victoria Institute, and from 1890 to 1895 broke similar ground with the British Association. In this period, with Andrew Lang's help, her poetry was published to brief acclaim, and she met Mary Frances Outram (1862&#150;1935), eldest daughter of Sir Francis Outram, of Pitlochry, from 1894 her constant companion. She commenced systematic archaeological work on Ipswich monastic sites (1898), winning honourable recognition. In 1902&#150;5 she discovered and excavated a palaeolithic site in Ipswich analogous to Hoxne and Hitchin, advised by Sir John Evans and Boyd Dawkins, and was elected fellow of the Anthropological Institute (1902) and Linnean Society (1906). Her methodical rescue excavation of an Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Ipswich in 1906&#150;7 received publication by the Society of Antiquaries (London), though at this time she was excluded (being a woman) despite Evans's attempted intervention.<br>
<br>In 1907 Sir Ray Lankester established Layard as honorary curator of a room in Christchurch Mansion, Ipswich, where until 1920 she developed substantial prehistoric collections (which she popularized through press notices) by excavations in East Anglia and elsewhere, receiving encouragement from distinguished archaeologists, and inspiring several future prehistorians, including James Reid Moir and her anthropologist nephew John Willoughby Layard (1891&#150;1974). A founder member of the Prehistoric Society of East Anglia (1908) and president (1921), Layard deliberated on the putative Tertiary implements in 1910&#150;11, and was also an active officer of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology in 1912&#150;20. She was one of the first group of women to be made fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, <i>honoris causa</i> (1921), and throughout the 1920s continued excavation and publication, studying continental sites, and developing international academic contacts. In her work she rebuffed anti-feminine prejudice by courtesy, thoroughness, excellence, and perseverance. Her excavations, publications, collections, and academic connections helped shape a rising generation of prehistoric discourse, bridging nineteenth- and twentieth-century outlook and method. Her early religious views, which prompted several initiatives in temperance and social reform, broadened through her studies towards a synthetic Christian spirituality. She worked until her last year, and died shortly after Miss Outram, in Ipswich Nursing Home, 57 Fonnereau Road, Ipswich, on 12 August 1935. They were buried in a shared grave in Kelvedon churchyard, Essex, on 15 August.<br>
