<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Vives,  Juan Luis</span>  (1492/3&#150;1540), <span class="occ">scholar</span>, was born in Valencia, Spain, on 6 March 1492, according to the traditional dating as inscribed on his tombstone, although recently published records of the Inquisition would indicate early 1493. He was born into a family of <i>converso</i> Jews of Valencia who were forced to convert to Christianity after the uprisings of 1391 in that city. His father, Llu&iacute;s Vives Valeriola (1463&#150;1524), was a well-to-do cloth merchant. His mother, Blanquina March Almenara (1473&#150;1508), was of a family of jurists and notaries from Gand&iacute;a.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Vives must have been raised as a Christian but it seems quite probable that his parents and many of his relatives secretly observed certain religious practices of Judaism, of which the young Vives could not have been unaware. The persecution and execution of many members of his family and his <i>converso</i> origins remained a determining psychological factor throughout his life. As far as can be ascertained, his training in Latin both in primary school and at university was of the traditional kind, not yet influenced by the reforms instituted by Elio Antonio de Nebrija at Salamanca. At the estudi general of Valencia, formally elevated to the rank of university in 1500 by the Borgia pope Alexander VI, a native of neighbouring J&aacute;tiva, he would have taken two years of grammar and three years of arts.<br>
<br>In 1509, the year following his mother's death, Vives set out for Paris to complete his studies. There he joined many other students from Spain, especially Aragon, enrolled in the faculties of arts and theology. As was the practice at Paris at this time, the young Vives took courses at different colleges, probably beginning his studies under the Aragonese logician Juan Dolz de Castellar at the college of Lisieux. He must also have attended at the lessons of Nicolas B&eacute;rault, who had come to Paris from Orl&eacute;ans and taught the classical authors at the College of La Marche. During these years the French humanist was giving lectures on authors not usually included in the arts curriculum, such as Quintilian, Juvenal, and Suetonius. These consisted of close readings of the classical texts with ample historical, mythological, and geographical commentary. It seems very likely that Vives was inspired by these examples to give his own lectures on authors and works that were the subjects of B&eacute;rault's lectures, such as Cicero's <span class="italic">De legibus</span> and Francesco Filelfo's encyclopaedic work, the <span class="italic">Convivia</span>. At the Coll&egrave;ge de Montaigu, Vives studied under the Aragonese Gaspar Lax de Sari&ntilde;ena, master of the intricacies of terminist logic, and Jan Dullaert of Ghent, commentator on the <span class="italic">Physics</span> of Aristotle and interested also in astronomy. Among Vives's early writings published in Paris is a <i>praelectio</i> on the <i>Poeticon astronomicon</i> of pseudo-Hyginus and a brief life of Dullaert, who died at a very young age. During these Parisian years Vives published an impressive number of <i>praelectiones</i> and dialogues on Christian themes in Roman dress, chief of which was a depiction of Christ's victory over death in the form of a Roman triumph.<h2>
<a name="BrugesandLouvain"></a>Bruges and Louvain</h2>From 1512 Vives divided his time between Paris and Bruges, where there was a flourishing Jewish community. He was the guest of a relative of his from Valencia, Bernardo Valdaura, whose daughter Margarita (1505&#150;1552) he married on 26 May 1524. In 1514 he left Paris definitively for the Low Countries, where he gave private lessons in Bruges and Louvain. One of his pupils there was the young Guillaume de Croy, nephew of the powerful lord of Chi&egrave;vres, who at the age of eighteen became bishop of Cambrai and at nineteen cardinal-archbishop of Toledo and primate of Spain. Through the patronage of his young ward Vives was licensed by special privilege to give public lectures at the University of Louvain without being on the official roster. Vives dedicated to him a book of meditations on the seven penitential psalms, which provide early evidence of the exceptional learning of the Spanish humanist. Besides the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span> and <span class="roman">Vulgate</span> version of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> he makes reference to a &#145;Chaldean&#146; (that is Aramaic) version made by a certain Jonathan, son of Abenuziel. Even in these religious pieces Vives made use of a florid declamatory style that was to characterize his later writings. At Louvain he made contacts with members of Erasmus's circle, Marcus Laurinus and Jan van Fevijn, and with Frans van Cranevelt, member of the grand council of Mechelen, who became his most trusted friend. That Vives had attained a position of some authority at the court of Charles I is made evident in a letter of 13 November 1516 from the magistrates of the city of Valencia to Vives&#151;whom they address as &#145;most learned gentleman and philosopher, Master Luis Vives, resident at the royal court&#146;  (Vives, 116&#150;18)&#151;in which they seek his intercession with the king concerning the affairs of the university.<br>
<br>Vives must have made the personal acquaintance of Erasmus as early as October 1516, when Erasmus was resident in Brussels and referred to Vives as one with whom he was on quite familiar terms. By 1519 Erasmus was so impressed with his younger contemporary's learning that he wrote an effusive letter of praise to Juan de la Parra, personal physician of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, brother of Charles V, recommending Vives as a tutor for the archduke. Vives chose not to desert his pupil, Guillaume de Croy, but in compensation dedicated a work to Ferdinand, the <span class="italic">Sullan Declamations</span>, an exercise in deliberative oratory and political philosophy, which once again drew extraordinary praise both from Erasmus and Thomas More. In this Louvain period Vives wrote several other works, including a short piece on the origins of philosophy, a piquant fable on man, which is a subtle parody of Pico della Mirandola's <span class="italic">Oration on the Dignity of Man</span>, and a commentary on Cicero's <span class="italic">Dream of Scipio</span>, preceded by a delightful dream of his own that ushers in the more serious discussion.<br>
<br>The most important work to issue from Vives's pen at this time was the <span class="italic">In pseudodialecticos</span>, a spirited attack against the Parisian doctors at whose feet he had once sat. It is a brilliant diatribe, all the more effective, as Erasmus wrote to Thomas More soon after its publication, since &#145;No one is better fitted to break the serried ranks of the sophists, in whose army he has served so long&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 7.295). As Erasmus had done before him in <span class="italic">The Praise of Folly</span>, Vives singles out for ridicule the absurd Latin used by the dialecticians, incomprehensible to all but themselves. He promises that one day he will demonstrate, not by argument but by deed, that all the arts can be communicated in normal speech without the use of jargon, as indeed he was to do in his monumental work on education, the <span class="italic">De disciplinis</span>. Vives insists that too much time is dedicated to the study of logic, a subject that should be learned not for its own sake but as a tool and support of the other arts.<br>
<br>Vives returned to Paris a few months later in the company of Guillaume de Croy and on his return was able to report to Erasmus that he was given a friendly reception by the very people who had been the object of his satire. It was during this visit that he met for the first time the foremost French humanist, Guillaume Bud&eacute;, with whom he had already been in frequent correspondence, and with whom he retained friendly relations until the end of his life. Amid this newly won fame and success Vives suffered a serious set-back when his young patron fell from his horse and was killed on 11 January 1521. This turn of events left him in a state of great depression. He became ill and retired to Bruges, where he gradually recuperated. For several months he had to cease work on the formidable scholarly task Erasmus had set him: a commentary on St Augustine's <span class="italic">City of God</span>, which would form part of the complete edition of Augustine that Erasmus was preparing for Froben. The newly discovered letters of Vives to Cranevelt reveal that in his present quandary Vives was anxious to meet with Thomas More during his impending visit to the prinsenhof in Bruges in the company of Cardinal Wolsey. The meeting, arranged by Vives's good friend Cranevelt, would prove to be of great significance for Vives's future career. In the summer of 1522 he finally completed the commentary on Augustine at the cost of great physical and mental fatigue, but Erasmus was displeased with its excessive length and poor sales at the Frankfurt fair. The relations between the two humanists became noticeably strained after this. He dedicated the work to Henry VIII in a very florid preface, in which he exalts him above all the kings of the earth and congratulates him on the <span class="italic">Defence of the Seven Sacraments</span>, which had just appeared. The acknowledgement from the palace of Greenwich was polite and appreciative.<br>
<br>Vives continued to give lessons at the University of Louvain at this time and to tutor private students, among whom were some notable English scholars: Nicholas Wotton, Giles Wallop, William Thale, and the physician John Clement. In May 1522 he was offered the prestigious chair of Latin philology at the University of Alcal&aacute;, to succeed the famous Antonio de Nebrija. There is no indication of his response until a year later in letters written both to Erasmus and Cranevelt: he announces his intention to set out for Spain by way of England, since the land journey through France was rendered impossible by the hostilities raging there. Before his departure for England he wrote the first of his pacifist essays, an open letter to the newly elected pope, Adrian VI, who was from Utrecht. Vives was emboldened to write such a letter since he had been a good friend of Adrian Florensz when he was vice-chancellor of the University of Louvain. It is a plea for peace among Christian nations and for the peaceful solution of religious controversies, in which regard he urges the pope to call a general council of the church. Vives has no sympathy with the subtle distinctions made by theologians concerning the just and the unjust war but accounts all wars among brothers, united by the bond of baptism, as iniquitous and criminal. During these decisive months Vives was plagued by news concerning the fortunes of his family in Spain. In a letter of 4 January 1523 to Cranevelt he laments the death of his only brother, Jaime, and the pitiful conditions of his father, charged by the Inquisition of clandestine Judaizing. Vives often refers to the hated tribunal by the veiled term <i>Fortuna</i>. In the face of these disastrous events he took for himself as a motto a phrase from Seneca: <i>Sine querela</i> (&#145;Without complaint&#146;). Vives's worst fears were realized: his father was delivered to the secular arm and burnt at the stake on 6 September 1524. Vives never did return to Spain but must have felt great anguish over his powerlessness to help his family.<h2>
<a name="England"></a>England</h2>Vives departed for England on 18 March 1523, and immediately won favour with Cardinal Wolsey, who appointed him his reader in humanity at Oxford in succession to Thomas Lupset; he delivered his lectures in Corpus Christi College. There is extant a fragment of a letter of his to Wolsey, in which he says that he has assigned to the students philosophical questions that elicit more pleasant as well as more fruitful debate, and has rid them of many corrupt opinions regarding dialectics. In the first year of his tenure the king and queen, breaking a long tradition of the English crown, entered the city of Oxford to pay him a visit. This event is recorded with some exaggeration in Brian Twyne's <span class="italic">Antiquitatis academiae Oxoniensis apologia</span> of 1608. Vives also received a royal invitation to spend the Christmas and Epiphany holidays at Windsor Castle.<br>
<br>Vives quickly made the acquaintance of all the famous English humanists of the day: Cuthbert Tunstall, William Linacre, William Latimer, and John Fisher, and was a frequent visitor at the home of Thomas More in Chelsea. At court Vives also exercised great influence in the role of friend and spiritual counsellor of Queen Katherine and tutor to Princess Mary. At the behest of the queen, Vives had begun a long treatise on the <span class="italic">Education of a Christian Woman</span> while still in Bruges. It was ready for publication in April 1523 but did not appear until the following year. It was translated into English by Richard Hyrde, a tutor in More's household, under More's personal supervision. The work enjoyed enormous popularity in England and became the prototype of various conduct books for women during the Tudor period. For Princess Mary, Vives also wrote a practical plan of study and a collection of spiritual mottoes and devices entitled <span class="italic">Satellitium animi</span>, or <span class="italic">Escort of the Soul</span>, a predecessor to the popular emblem books of the later sixteenth century. This pamphlet was followed by yet another instructional book, the <span class="italic">Introduction to Wisdom</span>, directed toward a wider audience.<br>
<br>Vives now turned from educational to political writing in an impressive series of works on affairs of state. In homage to the cardinal he produced translations of two famous speeches of the Greek orator Isocrates: his address to the Areopagus and his speech to Nicocles, both on the subject of government. The next work was a brief letter he wrote from Bruges to John Longland, bishop of Lincoln and confessor to the king. As in the letter to Adrian VI, he continually refers to Europe as a political entity and begs the bishop's intercession in the interests of peace. He has heard, he says, that even the ignorant savages in the New World honour a man of peace. He returned to England in September 1524 to resume his duties there but sailed back to Bruges in the following spring after an outbreak of plague. Just before his departure Vives addressed an earnest appeal to Henry VIII asking him to seek the release of Fran&ccedil;ois I, who had been captured by the imperial forces at the battle of Pavia and was held prisoner in Madrid. He exhorts the king and the emperor to make moderate and magnanimous use of their victory and refrain from devastating the most flourishing realm of Christendom.<br>
<br>A few months after the battle of Moh&aacute;cs in 1526, in which the Turkish forces of Sulayman the Magnificent defeated the Hungarians, Vives wrote a dialogue of the dead in the style of the Greek satirist Lucian. Mythological figures in Hades discuss the present European conflicts and their precedents both in more recent history and in antiquity. It is an ironic commentary on the disunification of Christian leaders in the face of the Turkish menace. In the same year Vives wrote a treatise, <span class="italic">On the Relief of the Poor</span>, solicited by the magistrates of the city of Bruges through their ambassador to England, Lodewijk van Praet. It addressed the thorny problem of poverty and beggars with concrete proposals to the civil authorities on how to remedy it. It is regarded as a very important document in the history of social welfare. His enlightened attitude, imbued with the principles of Christian charity, was far in advance of his time.<br>
<br>In February 1526 Vives was again in England (his frequent crossings prompted Erasmus to call him an &#145;amphibious animal&#146;), apparently still intent on persuading Henry to intervene on the side of peace. As the king's Great Matter became more and more complicated, Vives had no choice but to side with the queen, incurring Henry's and Wolsey's great displeasure. Through the machinations of the latter he was placed under house arrest from 25 February to 1 April 1528&#151;together with the Spanish ambassador in London, I&ntilde;igo de Mendoza, who was suspected of transmitting messages to Pope Clement VII and to the emperor. Upon his release Vives returned to Bruges but it seems that he was called back to England by the queen, together with two jurists from Flanders to counsel her. When Vives refused to defend her in the trial at Blackfriars before the papal legates, knowing that it would be a farce, she dismissed him and cut off his pension. So ended Vives's career in England. Actually, at the request of Wolsey, Vives had previously sent a rather long legal and theological opinion to the king some time in 1528, which for one reason or another did not reach him and which is no longer extant. Vives refers to this document in a letter he wrote to the king three years later and sent him another exemplar. He expresses his continued devotion and good wishes to the royal pair for the brief span of life that remains to them. He also gives some very sound advice to the king about the uncertainty that will surround the possible succession of a male heir from another marriage.<h2>
<a name="BrugesandBredaVivessfinalyears"></a>Bruges and Breda: Vives's final years</h2>With both royal pensions discontinued Vives was left in penurious conditions. He remained for the most part in Bruges with occasional trips to Louvain, Brussels, Antwerp, and Mechelen. During this last part of his life (1528&#150;40), an extraordinary number of lengthy and important works poured from the pen of Juan Luis Vives. In 1532 he began to receive a pension from the emperor Charles V, which, he records, sufficed for half of his living expenses. In 1537 he became preceptor to Menc&iacute;a de Mendoza, the wife of the duke of Nassau, and resided for a time at the ducal castle in Breda in North Brabant. Having failed in his mission of peace with Henry, Vives turned to Charles V in a long treatise entitled <span class="italic">On Concord and Discord in the Human Race</span> (1529). In the dedicatory epistle Vives congratulates the emperor on his imminent trip to Italy, where he would be signatory to the treaty of Cambrai. He reiterates his appeal to leaders of the Christian world to rise above national interests and unite in the face of the common enemy. Discord is the monster that devours the human species. This was followed by a complementary piece, <span class="italic">De pacificatione</span>, addressed to the Spanish grand inquisitor, Alonso Manrique, a fellow <i>converso</i> and a defender of Erasmists in Spain.<br>
<br>Vives's <i>magnum opus</i>, the <span class="italic">De disciplinis</span>, an encyclopaedic survey of education in all its aspects, was published by the printer Michael Hillen in Antwerp in 1531. It was dedicated to Jo&atilde;o III, king of Portugal, a patron of the new learning. The first book gives the reasons for the corruption of learning, mostly to be attributed to the excessive importance given to dialectics by the scholastic philosophers. The second book is a complete reorganization of teaching and curricula at every level, embracing the entire domain of knowledge. Vives would have the child begin to learn through the observation of nature&#151;astronomy, geography, zoology, botany, even husbandry and gardening. Trades and crafts could be learned by visiting the workshops of the tradesmen. University education would begin with many years of intensive training in language and literature, chiefly Latin, then Greek, but not to the exclusion of the vernacular languages. Next would come rhetoric, dialectical reasoning, and lastly mathematics, to be followed by formal professional training in medicine and jurisprudence, the latter requiring a profound knowledge of history and moral philosophy. In the third book Vives concentrates on philosophy and gives a terse critique of individual classical, medieval, and humanist authors. The final goal of education is both practical and spiritual, the application of learning to the contemporary world and the acquisition of virtue.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">De disciplinis</span> is a landmark in the history of education, which had great influence on such writers as Rabelais, Montaigne, Melanchthon, Comenius, and Descartes. Many other works followed, the most important of which is his <span class="italic">De anima et vita</span> (1538), loosely derived from Aristotle's treatise on this subject. Rather than define the soul, Vives investigates its operations and functions. His shrewd observations on the passions or emotions earned him the title of father of modern psychology from nineteenth-century historians of philosophy. Vives's final work, <span class="italic">On the Truth of the Christian Faith</span>, a Christian apologetic in the form of a dialogue between Christians, Jews, and Muslims, was published posthumously by his friend Cranevelt. Worn out by his scholarly labours and suffering from kidney afflictions and the gout, he died on 6 May 1540 at Bruges, and was buried there in the church of St Donatian, now destroyed.<br>
<br>Vives's works enjoyed great popularity throughout the sixteenth century and innumerable editions, both in Latin and in translation, were printed by the great publishing houses of Antwerp, Basel, Lyons, Paris, and Venice. His pedagogical innovations had great influence on English writers on education such as Roger Ascham, Thomas Elyot, and Richard Mulcaster. Numerous editions of his popular Latin dialogues for schoolboys, the <span class="italic">Exercitatio linguae Latinae</span>, were published in England. Tudor prayer manuals and devotional works borrowed heavily from Vives's <span class="italic">Preces et meditationes diurnae</span> (1535) and books like John Bradford's <span class="italic">Private Prayers and Meditations</span> (1559) and Richard Day's <span class="italic">Book of Christian Prayers</span> (1578), based on Vives's devotional writings, achieved great popularity in protestant circles. Interest in Vives waned in the next two centuries but was revived again at the end of the nineteenth century and continues with great vigour at the present day, especially in Belgium and Spain. Juan Luis Vives is a towering figure of the Renaissance, a man of immense learning, integrity, and originality, whose worth has yet to be fully estimated.<br>
