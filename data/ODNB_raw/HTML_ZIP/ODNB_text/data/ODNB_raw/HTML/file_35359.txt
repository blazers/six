<span class="headword">Paget,  Sidney Edward</span>  (1860&#150;1908), <span class="occ">painter and illustrator</span>, was born on 4 October 1860 at 60 Pentonville Road, London, the fourth son of Robert Paget, a vestry clerk from 1856 to 1892 of Clerkenwell and his wife, Martha Clarke. He received his early education at the Cowper Street School in London and afterwards attended the Heatherley School of Fine Art. In 1881 he entered the Royal Academy Schools, where he was preceded by his brothers Henry Marriott and Walter Stanley, both well-known artists and illustrators. At the Academy Schools he won, among other prizes, second place in 1885 in the Armitage competition and first place and medal in 1886 for his <span class="italic">Balaam Blessing the Children of Israel</span>. Between 1879 and 1905 Paget contributed to the Royal Academy exhibitions eighteen miscellaneous paintings, of which nine were portraits. The best known of his pictures, <span class="italic">Lancelot and Elaine</span>, exhibited in 1891, was presented to the Bristol Art Gallery by Lord Winterstoke. Among the portraits painted by Paget were <span class="italic">Dr Weymouth</span> (exh. RA, 1887), headmaster of Mill Hill School, depicted in a three-quarter-length painting dressed in scarlet robes as DLitt; his father, and his brother Robert Ernest (his father's successor as vestry clerk), both displayed in the town hall, Finsbury; Sir John Aird, as mayor, which hung in Paddington town hall; and the journalist Sir William Henry Wills (exh. RA, 1901).<br>
<br>It was as an illustrator that Paget won a wide reputation. His vigorous work as a black and white artist became well known not only in the United Kingdom but also in America and the colonies through his drawings for the <span class="italic">Pictorial World</span> (1882), for <span class="italic">The Sphere</span>, and for many of Cassell's publications. He also drew occasionally for <span class="italic">The Graphic</span>, the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, and the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Magazine</span>. Paget's spirited illustrations for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's <span class="italic">Sherlock Holmes</span> and <span class="italic">Rodney Stone</span> in the <span class="italic">Strand Magazine</span> greatly assisted in popularizing those stories. The assertion that the artist's brother Walter, or any other person, served as model for the portrait of Sherlock Holmes is incorrect.<br>
<br>On 1 June 1893 Paget married Edith (<i>b</i>. 1865/6), daughter of William Hounsfield, a farmer; they had six children. During the last few years of his life he suffered from a painful chest complaint, to which he succumbed at 16 Surrey Road, Margate, on 28 January 1908. He was buried at Marylebone cemetery, Finchley.<br>
