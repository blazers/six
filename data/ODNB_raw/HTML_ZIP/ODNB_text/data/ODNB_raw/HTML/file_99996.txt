<span class="headword">Lawther,  Patrick Joseph</span>  (1921&#150;2008), <span class="occ">physician and medical researcher</span>, was born at 15 Victory Avenue, Gretna, Dumfriesshire, on 9 March 1921, the son of Joseph Lawther, marine engineer, and his wife, Winifred, otherwise Winefride, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mulholland. He went to school in Carlisle and then in Morecambe. His undergraduate career began at King's College, London, in 1939 where he read chemistry but did not take a degree. He returned to Morecambe and taught at Apperley Bridge, Yorkshire, for a year. In 1941 he was appointed as a chemist with Hickson and Welch Ltd, where he stayed for the remainder of the Second World War. In 1944 he decided to study medicine, read for the first MB examination while at work, and, after pre-clinical studies at Cambridge, proceeded to St Bartholomew's Hospital medical school and graduated MB BS in 1950. He became a member of the Royal College of Physicians in 1954. Meanwhile he married Kathleen May Wilkowski (1917&#150;1998), daughter of Vincent George Wilkowski, accountant, on 4 November 1944. She also became a doctor. They had two sons, Anthony and Christopher, and one daughter, Judith (<i>d</i>. 2003).<br>
<br>The London smog of December 1952, which killed at least 4000 people, had a great effect on Lawther's career. He had been a house physician at St Bartholomew's Hospital between 1950 and 1951 and was a Cooper and Coventson research scholar at the time of the smog. In 1955 the Medical Research Council established the MRC Group for Research on Atmospheric Pollution (later the Air Pollution Unit, and later still the Environmental Hazards Unit) at St Bartholomew's Hospital, and Lawther was appointed director. This was a remarkable step for a young physician and a brilliant appointment by the Medical Research Council. Lawther recruited a number of scientists to his unit, including Brian Commins, in charge of analytical work, and Robert Waller, who had read physics at Imperial College, moved to statistical work, and worked on cancer producing compounds with Sir Ernest Kennaway. Thus began a remarkably productive association and a series of seminal research programmes on the effects of air pollutants on health. The focus of the work was on the effects of particulate matter and of sulphur dioxide, the main pollutants of the coal-smoke era. Lawther adopted a characteristically broad approach: he measured concentrations of pollutants in the air, studied panels of patients suffering from chronic bronchitis and related their symptoms to ambient levels of pollution, and undertook experimental studies on himself and his staff. With Waller he was one of the first to apply the electron microscope to the examination of particles collected from the air. The work led to a series of publications and established the reputation of the unit as perhaps the world's leading centre for air pollution research. The <span class="roman">Clean Air Act</span> of 1956 led to the progressive reduction of levels of air pollutants in London and other British cities, and Lawther's group followed the declining effects on health. By the 1970s London air pollution was much reduced and in 1977 the unit was closed with Lawther's agreement, its work being seen as essentially complete. In retrospect this was an error: research on the effects of air pollutants on health dried up in the UK and did not recover until the early 1990s. This soured relations between Lawther and his North American colleagues, and only later did UK research workers regain a leading position in the field. It was later discovered that levels of air pollution that Lawther would have regarded as trivial have a significant effect on health. After the closure of the unit Lawther moved to the Medical Research Council's toxicology unit at Carshalton and led the clinical section there. He retired in 1981. In addition to his work for the Medical Research Council he had been honorary consultant and physician in charge of the department of environmental and preventive medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital from 1962 to 1981, and had held the chair in environmental and preventive medicine there from 1968 until 1981. In the latter year he was appointed an emeritus professor of London University.<br>
<br>Lawther's distinction as a medical research worker led him into a good deal of committee work. He served as chairman of the Department of Health and Social Security's committee on the medical aspects of contamination of air and soil (1973&#150;85), the same department's working party on lead and health (1978&#150;80), and the Royal Navy's underwater medicine committee, and as a member of the medical committee of the Ministry of Defence's Chemical Defence Establishment at Porton. This work took up a good deal of his time: he was an excellent chairman and committee member. His wide range of knowledge and infectious wit enlivened all discussions. He was advanced to fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians in 1963, made DSc by London University in 1971, and appointed CBE in 1978. His distinction was also recognized by the award of the silver medal of the Royal Society of Arts (1964), the bronze medal of the Acad&eacute;mie Nationale de M&eacute;dicine (1972), the Bissett Hawkins medal of the Royal College of Physicians (1974), and the Edwin Stevens gold medal of the Royal Society of Medicine in 1975.<br>
<br>Lawther's interests extended far beyond medicine. He was a keen fisherman, and excellent shot, an enthusiastic cricketer (in his younger days), and a bibliophile of note. He founded the Lawther Library at his old school in Morecambe and donated a splendid Golden Cockerel edition of the King James gospels (designed and edited by Eric Gill) and the Gegynog Press edition of the Arabic romance <span class="italic">The Stealing of the Mare</span> to the library of the Royal College of Physicians. He was interested in music, played the recorder, and presented a rare piccolo to the Victoria and Albert Museum. He was widely read, especially in poetry, and knew many of the poems of W. B. Yeats by heart. He died at Dawson Lodge nursing home, Botley Road, West End, Southampton, on 6 June 2008, of sepsis, and was survived by his two sons.<br>
