<span class="headword">Sellar,  Walter Carruthers</span>  (1898&#150;1951), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and humorous writer</span>, was born at Golspie, Sutherland, on 27 December 1898, the second son of Patrick Sellar, a farmer, and his wife, Janet Anne Carruthers (<i>d</i>. 1914). He was a descendant of the Patrick Sellar notorious for his role in the highland clearances. In 1912 he won an entrance scholarship to Fettes College, Edinburgh. In 1914 he suffered a personal tragedy when his elder brother, Patrick, died at school, followed a few days later by their mother. The experience may well have induced the melancholy streak later noticed in Sellar but did not prevent his enjoying a successful career at Fettes, and he left as head boy in 1917. He then went into the army, commissioned as a second lieutenant in the King's Own Scottish Borderers, and served in France and Germany, suffering wounds that, though not severe, helped to undermine health that was never robust. On 29 April 1919 he matriculated from Oriel College, Oxford, reading modern history, but due to illness took only an aegrotat degree in 1922.<br>
<br>While at Oxford Sellar met the friend with whose name his own has become inseparably linked. <a name="cosubject_63714"></a><span class="headword">Robert Julian Yeatman</span>  (1897&#150;1968) was born in London, at 82 Ashley Gardens, Westminster, on 15 July 1897, the second son of Harry Oswald Yeatman (1856&#150;1919), a London port-shipper, and his wife, Benedicta Katherine Page. From 1911 he was educated at Marlborough College, where he succeeded alike as scholar, athlete, and musician, before leaving in 1914 to join the Royal Field Artillery. Commissioned lieutenant in 1915, he was awarded the MC a year later. He also suffered very severe wounds, described as having left him &#145;perforated like a colander&#146;  (Sherrin, xvi). In 1919 Yeatman (who pronounced his name Yetman) matriculated from Oriel College on the same day as Sellar, and took a second in modern history in 1922. At this point his and Sellar's paths diverged, for Sellar returned to Fettes as a schoolmaster, remaining there until 1928, while Yeatman after a spell in journalism became advertising manager for Kodak Ltd. Both men had literary ambitions. Sellar contributed short humorous articles to a number of journals and above all to <span class="italic">Punch</span>, which published three of them in 1925; in 1926 Yeatman too began to contribute to that journal.<br>
<br>In 1928 Sellar left Fettes and seems to have tried to make a career as a full-time writer, living in a cottage at Marlow. About the same time he married (Mary Dorothy) Hope Carruthers, an athlete who played hockey for England. They had two daughters, and it was probably the need for a secure income following his marriage that brought Sellar's literary experiment to an end, for in September 1929 he became a schoolmaster at Canford School, Dorset. He stayed there until he moved in July 1932 to Charterhouse School, Godalming, Surrey, where he remained for the rest of his life. There is no evidence on when his literary collaboration with Yeatman began but it was very likely during his year away from teaching, for on 10 September 1930 <span class="italic">Punch</span> began to publish extracts from their most famous book, <span class="italic">1066 and All That</span>, the last of them appearing on the day before it was published. It was an instant success, although so little was known about its authors that rumour credited it to the much better-known A. P. Herbert. Three further joint ventures followed: <span class="italic">And Now All This</span> (1932), <span class="italic">Horse Nonsense</span> (1933), and <span class="italic">Garden Rubbish</span> (1936), the first and last also receiving advance publication in <span class="italic">Punch</span>. All sold well but without receiving the popular success of <span class="italic">1066</span>, which in 1934 provided the basis for a musical comedy with book and lyrics by Reginald Arkell and music by Alfred Reynolds.<br>
<br>At Charterhouse Sellar taught history at first but later became senior English master. In January 1939 he became housemaster of Daviesites and fulfilled his responsibilities with great conscientiousness, increasing the capacity of his house despite the outbreak of war. He was very popular with the boys, and not only because he mitigated the effects of rationing by buying extra food for them at his own expense. His health remained poor, however, and he died at St Thomas's Hospital, Hambledon, Surrey, on 11 June 1951. A road at Charterhouse was afterwards named after him.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Yeatman had by 1937 married Eleanor May Simmonds, a gifted actress, with whom he had a son. He rejoined the army in 1940, serving as a captain in the Royal Artillery until in 1943 he was released to the Ministry of Information, where he worked until 1949. Afterwards he was employed as a copywriter, first by Haddons and then by S. L. Benson Ltd, from which he retired in 1962. He died in London, at 39/41 Royal Avenue, Chelsea, on 13 July 1968.<br>
<br>Sellar and Yeatman were temperamentally very different. Sellar was somewhat reclusive and inward-looking, with a religious cast of mind that found expression in some of his (unpublished) poetry, although like many shy people he enjoyed acting. Yeatman by contrast was very sociable, with a wide range of friends that included Clark Gable, W. H. Auden, and Christopher Isherwood. Each had a strong sense of humour but its quality differed, as can be seen in the two books that were ostensibly written by both men but were each in fact essentially the work of only one of them. <span class="italic">Horse Nonsense</span>, almost entirely by Yeatman, contains much wittily satirical comment on the mores and clich&eacute;s associated with horses and riders: &#145;The Best People are still horse-conscious&#151;neigh, animal-minded. In their eyes, persons who betray Blank Ignorance of The Horse, or, worse still, downright brutish Indifference to The Noble Animal, are definitely <i>beyond the pail</i>.&#146; <span class="italic">Garden Rubbish</span>, largely written by Sellar and gentler in tone, is notable for a series of exuberant puns (&#145;Greta Garbo&#151;&#147;I want to be a lawn&#148;&#146;) and for the addition of the &#145;Unpleasaunce&#146; to the traditional stock of garden amenities: &#145;Every fair-sized garden has one &hellip; they differ only in the number and variety of Depressing Things they harbour.&#146; <span class="italic">And Now All This</span>, a genuine collaboration, is presented as a guide to &#145;Absolutely General Knowledge&#146;, and perhaps for that reason lacks cohesion. It scores a number of bull's-eyes, for instance an account of an Indian official's day (recycled by Yeatman from a contribution to <span class="italic">Punch</span> in 1926)&#151;&#145;after a hurried bath (<i>wallah</i>) dresses himself (<i>collah</i>) is down at a quarter to eight for breakfast (<i>swallah</i>)&#146;&#151;but is ultimately too diffuse to be wholly successful.<br>
<br>No such charge could be laid against Sellar's and Yeatman's first and most famous effort. The unity of <span class="italic">1066 and All That</span> comes primarily from the idea that does most to give the book its unique quality: that history consists less of what actually happened than of what can be remembered, or more often misremembered, as having happened. But hardly less inspired than the idea itself is the way it is exploited. Simultaneously both a parody of a school textbook and a resum&eacute; of an incompetent pupil's response to one, many of <span class="italic">1066</span>'s garblings of names and facts serve simply to amuse, but many, too, constitute comments both shrewd and witty on the events described. Thus the definition of Poynings' law, of 1494, as an act &#145;by which the Irish could have a Parliament of their own, but the English were to pass all the Acts in it&#146;, is simultaneously an amusing conceit, the sort of misreading a careless schoolboy might plausibly perpetrate, and a pointed summary of the historical event.<br>
<br>It may be surmised that the theme of history as memory came from Sellar, whose unpublished essay on nonsense suggests that he had a penchant for general ideas and whose experience as a schoolmaster would certainly have familiarized him with the sort of textbook whose particular qualities <span class="italic">1066</span> lampoons. In its terms of reference <span class="italic">1066</span> pays a paradoxical tribute to the education it makes fun of. The reader who hopes to spot every joke will have to know the whole history of England from Roman times to 1918 and to have read widely in English literature as well; it refers directly to nearly all Shakespeare's history plays and also to writings by Milton (through a typographical joke), Pope, Gray, Keats, Tennyson, and Newbolt. More generally it is a book of its time in sharing the inter-war trend, found for instance in the humorous writings of J. B. Morton (&#145;Beachcomber&#146;), towards a less reverential attitude to the national past and especially to the Victorian tendency to perceive that past in terms of a glorious and imperial destiny.<br>
<br>The tone of <span class="italic">1066 and All That</span> is set by its preface, which acknowledges the authors' debt to &#145;the Great British People without whose self-sacrificing determination to become top Nation there would have been no (memorable) history&#146;, after which the reader is taken into a world of rigid moral judgements in which kings and ministers, all emphatically either good or bad, are regularly confounded by an unanswerable &#145;Irish Question&#146;, in which England is bound to become &#145;C of E&#146;, where patterns are established by waves&#151;whether of invaders, pretenders, or even beards&#151;and where all barons are wicked barons. In spite of the preface's tribute to the &#145;British&#146; people the focus of the book is totally Anglocentric, ludicrously so: the Scots &#145;come right into History&#146; in the thirteenth century, while Indian history begins only in the eighteenth, just before American history ends.<br>
<br>The satirical quality of <span class="italic">1066</span> was most likely Yeatman's essential contribution; probably his were the sharp comments on events like Queen Victoria's wars, which are reliably reported to have made Donald Soper a pacifist: &#145;<i>War against Zulus</i>. Cause: the Zulus. Zulus exterminated. Peace with Zulus&#146;. But equally important to <span class="italic">1066</span>'s success is an element of sheer fantasy, where history breaks almost entirely loose from its moorings, as in the account of Charles I and ship money: &#145;This so upset Charles that he went back to Westminster, and after cinquing several ports burst into the House of Commons and asked in a very royal way for some birds which he said were in there&#146;. This and a continuously inspired misrepresentation of names, sometimes satirical (Viscount Slaughterhouse, Sir Robert Repeel), sometimes purely comic (Harold Harebrush, the Elector Pantomime), which culminates in an uproarious confusion of Lambert Simnel and Perkin Warbeck (Warmnel, Perbeck, Wimneck &hellip;), was probably largely Sellar's contribution.<br>
<br>Their differences of personality notwithstanding, in <span class="italic">1066 and All That</span> Sellar and Yeatman achieved a perfect unity of theme and style. They were also fortunate in their illustrator. The drawings of John Patrick Reynolds (1909&#150;1935) are as sharp and economical as the accompanying text, and no one who has seen his pictures of King John losing his clothes in the wash or Morton applying his fork is ever likely to forget them. Moreover by representing the jokes rather than the incidents from which they derive the illustrations have helped <span class="italic">1066</span> to transcend its time. The title defers to Robert Graves's autobiography, <span class="italic">Goodbye to All That</span> (1929), but with none of the latter's resentment. Indeed despite its sharp-eyed mockery and its wholesale slaughter of sacred cows the spirit that it conveys is overwhelmingly one of comic exuberance, which in turn has done much to justify its authors' claim to memorability. Sellar and Yeatman have contributed many phrases to the common stock, their comparison of the Cavaliers (&#145;Wrong but Wromantic&#146;) with the Roundheads (&#145;Right but Repulsive&#146;) being only the most famous. At the opening of the twenty-first century opinion remains consistent that the authors and their book constitute a thoroughly Good Thing.<br>
