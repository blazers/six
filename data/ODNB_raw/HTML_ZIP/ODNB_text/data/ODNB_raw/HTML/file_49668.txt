<span class="headword">Marow,  Thomas</span>  (1460<span class="mult">x</span>65&#150;1505), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was the third son of William Marow of Bishopsgate, alderman of London and grocer, and his wife, Katherine, daughter of Richard Rich, sometime sheriff of London. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in the 1480s. There he seems to have been a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Thomas Frowyk, to whom (according to his brother's will) he was related; he later took over Frowyk's chambers in the Inner Temple, and in the British Library there is a manuscript year-book which belonged successively to Frowyk and Marow.<br>
<br>In 1491 Marow succeeded Frowyk as common serjeant of London, and in 1495 was promoted to under-sheriff, holding that office until he became a serjeant-at-law in 1503. Meanwhile he became a bencher of his inn, delivering a reading in 1497 on part of the <span class="roman">Statute of Gloucester</span>, and another in 1503 as junior serjeant-elect. It was for his serjeant's reading that he was long remembered in the legal profession, and is still known to legal historians. It was an elaborate exposition of the jurisdiction of justices of the peace, founded on the first chapter of the <span class="roman">Statute of Westminster I</span> (1275), &#145;that the peace of Holy Church and of the land be well kept&#146;, and included the fullest exposition at that time of English criminal law. Though not printed until 1924, it was widely circulated in manuscript and exerted an influence upon later commentators on criminal law.<br>
<br>The year of Marow's first permanent appointment, 1491, was also the year of his marriage. His wife, who predeceased him, was Isabel, daughter and coheir of Nicholas Brome of Baddesley Clinton, Warwickshire, who brought him property in Warwickshire. He doubtless maintained a house in that county, where he became a justice of the peace himself in 1497; there was formerly a window in Knole church with his arms and an exhortation to pray for the soul of Serjeant Marow and his wife. His brother William (<i>d</i>. 1499), who was a member of Thavies Inn but not a lawyer, left him a life interest in Marow's Quay in Billingsgate, which brought him a London income from the fishmonger licensees.<br>
<br>Marow did not long enjoy the benefits of his serjeant's coif. He served as an assize judge on the western circuit in 1504 and 1505, while in December 1504 he entered into an agreement with Sir Thomas Grene to marry the latter's daughter Anne, but died before the marriage could be solemnized, aged little more than forty. The record of the suit by his executors against Grene for the recovery of the marriage-money gives the date of his death as 10 April 1505. He left &pound;5 to Lady Frowyk, and made Chief Justice Frowyk his chief executor. By his will he desired to be buried in St Botolph's Church, Billingsgate (where his father lay), with a memorial plate. His only child, Dorothy, married first Francis Cokayne of Ashbourne, Derbyshire, and second Sir Humphrey Ferrers of Tamworth, Staffordshire. Marow's nephew and ward, Thomas Marow (<i>d</i>. 1538), son of his brother William, succeeded to the London property but settled in Warwickshire; this Thomas's son, another Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1561), represented the county in the 1553 parliament and became lord of the manor of Birmingham.<br>
