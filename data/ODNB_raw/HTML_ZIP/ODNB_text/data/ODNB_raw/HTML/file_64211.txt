<span class="headword">Byfield family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1814&#150;1886), <span class="occ">wood-engravers</span>, came to prominence with the siblings John, Ebenezer, and Mary, three of the six children of James Byfield (<i>d</i>. 1813), carver and gilder in Soho, and his wife, Susanna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Elliott (<i>c</i>.1759&#150;1818), whom he had married on 10 September 1775 at St Marylebone, Middlesex. While <a name="cosubject_4256"></a><span class="headword">John Byfield</span>  (1788&#150;1841)<span class="occ"></span> was baptized in St Marylebone Church on 13 April 1788, <a name="cosubject_64210"></a><span class="headword">Ebenezer Byfield</span>  (1790&#150;1817)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_64209"></a><span class="headword">Mary Byfield</span>  (1795&#150;1871)<span class="occ"></span> were baptized on 23 August 1790 and 11 November 1795 respectively in the Providence Chapel, Great Titchfield Street, where the eccentric and charismatic dissenter William Huntington preached. Having been taught, probably by his father, to engrave on wood, John Byfield collaborated with his sister Mary to provide illustrations for several books, including some for the celebrated bibliophile Thomas Frognall Dibdin: <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Spenciana</span>, 4 vols. (1814); <span class="italic">Bibliographical Decameron</span> (1817; also with Ebenezer); and <span class="italic">Reminiscences of a Literary Life</span> (1836). This pair also produced many woodcuts for celebrated publications of William Pickering, printed by Charles Whittingham the younger at the Chiswick Press, including <span class="italic">Icones veteris testamenti</span> (1830) and Francis Douce's edition of <span class="italic">The Dance of Death</span> (1833). John alone contributed cuts to John Martin's <span class="italic">Bibliographical Catalogue</span> (1834) and an edition of Gray's <span class="italic">Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard</span> (1835). Additionally, he created several bookplates between 1830 and 1840, including a monogram and armorial design for John Gage Rookwood, after designs by Thomas Willement. John lived all his working life in London and several of his addresses are known: Paradise Row (1817) and Cornwall Place, Holloway (1822&#150;7); 4 Brooksby Street (1832&#150;4); and 30 Upper Park Street, Liverpool Road, Islington (1836). He signed his engravings &#145;J. Byfield&#146;. He married Elizabeth Maylam Tucker of Lydd, Kent, and they had six children<a href="#cosubject_64211"> [<i>see below</i>]</a>. John Byfield died in 1841.<br>
<br>Mary Byfield also conducted work independently of her brother John. She produced engravings for Dibdin's <span class="italic">Typographical Antiquities</span> (1819) and <span class="italic">Bibliomania Spenciana</span> (1842), for Joseph Hunter's <span class="italic">South Yorkshire</span> (1828&#150;31), Orlando Jewitt's <span class="italic">Memorials of Cambridge</span> (1841), and for Edward Jesse's <span class="italic">A Summer's Day at Windsor, or A Visit to Eton</span> (1841). In 1841 she also designed a version of the university arms which formed part of the imprint of Oxford University Press. She was given most of her work by the printers Charles Whittingham, nephew and uncle, who employed her almost full time until her death in 1871, aged seventy-six. Consequently, the vast majority of Chiswick Press ornaments were engraved by her. Often she engraved alphabets, witness her work for Oliver Byrne's <span class="italic">First Books of &#145;Elements&#146; of Euclid</span> (1847), where each proposition is headed by an initial engraved by her and continues in Caslon italic font, printed in red, yellow, or blue ink. Alternatively, she engraved head and tail-pieces, borders, and vignettes, and this sort of work is best seen in the <span class="italic">Queen Elizabeth's Prayer Book of 1569</span> (1853), for which she cut over one hundred blocks, some based on designs by Holbein and D&uuml;rer, all of which harmonize perfectly with Whittingham's printing. A number of these engravings were reused in later books printed at the Chiswick Press. Mary taught not only several of her nephews and nieces to engrave on wood, but also Charlotte and Elizabeth Whittingham, the daughters of Charles Whittingham the younger, who often provided the designs for woodcuts. Various of her places of abode are recorded, either in Holloway: Cornwall Place (1822&#150;7), or Islington: 4 Brooksby Street (1832&#150;4), Canonbury Place (by 1842), and 30 Upper Park Street, Liverpool Road (1844). She signed her engravings &#145;Mary Byfield Sc&#146; or &#145;BYFIELD SC&#146;; the latter signature is confusing for much of her early work done with John was signed &#145;BYFIELD, Sc&#146;.<br>
<br>The middle sibling, Ebenezer Byfield, apparently produced less work than his brother or sister. His main contribution was to Dibdin's <span class="italic">Bibliographical Decameron</span> (1817), although he died in 1817 before its publication that year. One address is known for an &#145;E. Byfield&#146;: Eden Grove, Holloway.<br>
<br>Several of the offspring of this generation followed in their forebears' footsteps. John Byfield had six children of whom Ann, Edward, and Mary were taught to engrave on wood by their aunt Mary. <a name="cosubject_64211"></a><span class="headword">Edward Byfield</span>  (1838&#150;1860)<span class="occ"></span> also engraved borders for Chiswick Press books, the extant proofs of which are marked &#145;engraved by Mary and her nephew Edward Byfield&#146;. He died, tragically young, on 24 November 1860, at 30 Upper Park Street, Islington. <a name="cosubject_64212"></a><span class="headword">Ann Byfield</span>  (<em>b. </em>1830)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_64213"></a><span class="headword">Mary Byfield</span>  (<em>b. </em>1840)<span class="occ"></span> were active too, producing, for instance, new illustrations for the eighth edition of John William Bradley and J. G. Goodwin's <span class="italic">Manual of Illumination</span>, published for Winsor and Newton (1861). The sisters advertised themselves as &#145;artist engravers on wood&#146; at 47 Florence Street, Islington.<br>
<br>Ebenezer Byfield died early, leaving only one son. The boy, <a name="cosubject_72785"></a><span class="headword">Louis Byfield</span>  (1816&#150;1886)<span class="occ"></span>, was not only taught to engrave on wood by his aunt Mary, but also brought up by her, and his uncle John. For many years he helped his aunt in her work, producing, for instance, plates of Canonbury House and St Mary's Church for the <span class="italic">Islington Magazine</span> (July and August 1838) and for Samuel Lewis's <span class="italic">History and Topography of the Parish of St. Mary's, Islington</span> (1842). His work was signed &#145;LOUIS BYFIELD SC&#146;. He lived in Islington for some time, at 30 Upper Park Street and 435 Liverpool Road, but died at 230B Queen's Road, Dalston, London, on 18 January 1886. In 1838 he changed profession, thereafter advertising himself as an undertaker and engraver. He was married twice, first to a Mary Ann (<i>d</i>. 6 Jan 1879) and then to a Louisa, but left no children.<br>
