<span class="headword">Wingate,  William</span>  (1808&#150;1899), <span class="occ">missionary to the Jews</span>, was born in Glasgow on 7 October 1808, the eldest of the three sons of Andrew Wingate (1778&#150;1860), merchant, and his second wife, Margaret Miller. During his schooling at Glasgow grammar school, and his further education, which included attendance at university classes, he showed academic promise, and at the age of twenty-one he became a partner in his father's business. In 1835 he married his cousin, Jessie Buchanan (<i>d</i>. 1838); they had a daughter and a son. The deaths of his wife and infant son brought about an increased earnestness in his personality and, under the influence of Robert Wodrow, an elder of his church who had an interest in the conversion of Jews, he resolved to become a Christian missionary to the Jews.<br>
<br>In 1841 Wingate travelled to Berlin in order to study German and Hebrew, and it was during his absence that his daughter died. In the following summer he and Robert Smith arrived in Pest to join one of the two Church of Scotland missions recently established in central Europe. At the disruption of the Church of Scotland in 1843, all the missionaries there joined the Free Church of Scotland. Wingate should have returned to Scotland to pursue his studies, but instead he was ordained, in August 1843, by a specially convened presbytery consisting of his colleagues Robert Smith and John Duncan and the Indian missionary John Wilson. With Duncan's return to Scotland imminent, Wingate married his stepdaughter, Margaret Wallace Torrance (1824&#150;1909), on 12 September. They had five daughters and five sons.<br>
<br>The mission in Pest held services in German and English and ran a school. Wider influence was exercised throughout Hungary by <i>colporteurs</i>, converted Jews, who sold bibles and tracts; co-operation was also developed with local reformed churches. The mission received impressive converts, who included Alfred Edersheim and Adolph Saphir, though opposition from most Jews was considerable and the mission was barely tolerated by the authorities. A degree of protection was afforded in the early stages by the assistance of Archduchess Marie Dorothea, at whose instigation the mission had been established.<br>
<br>The situation in Pest was more encouraging than that facing the embattled mission station at Jassy, in Moldavia, to which Wingate was attached in the winter of 1847&#150;8 and where local hostility and general conditions were very discouraging. Catherine Edward, the missionary's wife, described Wingate as:<blockquote>worthy Mr Wingate marching through the mud, his trousers tucked up above his Wellington boots, and clogs over his boots, a huge Hungarian fur cloak on, a Boonda and comforter round his neck, and thus rolled up, coming home with whiskers and even eye-lashes frozen. (<span class="italic">Missionary Life</span>, 129)</blockquote>A return to Pest in the spring was followed by a withdrawal to London in September as Hungary was engulfed by war. It was possible to return to Pest in 1849, but official tolerance of the missionaries ended in January 1852, when all the Scottish missionaries were summarily expelled.<br>
<br>Wingate remained fixed in his concern for the conversion of the Jews and after his return to England he wished to continue such a mission in London. However, concern that such an initiative by the Free Church might offend English presbyterians prevented it. Wingate resigned about 1854 and for the rest of his long life exercised his influence without status or salary. A pious man of great persuasive powers, his fascination with the Jews established a family tradition which was passed on to his grandson, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36978/', "Major-General Orde Wingate")</script>. After a period in the Isle of Wight, where he withdrew with his wife in an attempt to restore her health, he finally made his home at Bayswater in London. Remaining involved with people and institutions committed to Jewish missions, he published <span class="italic">The Close of the Times of the Gentiles</span> in 1872. He died at 100 Talbot Road, Westbourne Park, London, on 24 December 1899, survived by his wife, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
