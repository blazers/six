<span class="headword">Pidgeon,  Henry Clark</span>  (1807&#150;1880), <span class="occ">watercolour painter and antiquary</span>, was born in March 1807. He was educated at Reading under Dr Valpy. He abandoned an early plan to enter the church and after a short trial in business at Isleworth adopted art as his profession. He had shown an interest in painting from an early age but was &#145;perhaps by inclination more of an antiquary than an artist&#146;  (Marillier, 196), and for some time edited the <span class="italic">Berkshire Chronicle</span>. He studied art in Paris and became a painter of landscapes, architectural subjects, and portraits, as well as an engraver and lithographer.<br>
<br>Pidgeon taught drawing and practised art in London before moving, about 1843, to Liverpool, where he gave private lessons and drew numerous local scenes and antiquities. His sketches were exhibited at the Liverpool Academy in 1843&#150;8: he became a member of the academy in 1847, and honorary secretary in 1850. In 1847 he was appointed professor of the school of drawing at the Liverpool Institute. In the following year he joined Joseph Mayer and Abraham Hume in founding the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire. He contributed many etchings and lithographs to the society's publications. After his return to London in January 1851 he became a non-resident member of the Liverpool Academy, where he continued to exhibit until 1865: some fifty of his works were hung at its annual exhibitions. In London, Pidgeon worked &#145;with great success&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>) in preparing on wood images of the Great Exhibition for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, which gave extensive pictorial coverage of the event. He also continued his practice as an art teacher, painted landscapes of the upper Thames valley, and spent at least one season abroad, visiting Switzerland.<br>
<br>Pidgeon, who worked mostly in watercolour, sent 258 works to the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours. They included <span class="italic">Sunset on the Bernese Alps, as Seen from Lucerne</span> (1859), a painting praised for its accurate and truthful treatment of a subject that tempted artists to romantic excess. He was an excellent draughtsman and his work, which is both broad in treatment and good in colour, has much of the depth and tone of John Varley. He was elected an associate of the institute in 1846 and a full member in 1861. He was also president of the Sketching Club. Pidgeon exhibited four pictures at the Royal Academy, two at the British Institution, fifteen at the Suffolk Street Gallery, and some twenty works at the Royal Manchester Institution. He also contributed papers and drawings to the journals of the Archaeological Institute, the British Archaeological Association, and the Liverpool Literary and Philosophical Society. He died at University College Hospital, Gower Street, London, on 6 August 1880.<br>
