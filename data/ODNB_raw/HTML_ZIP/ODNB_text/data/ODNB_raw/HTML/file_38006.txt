<span class="headword">Steers,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1672&#150;1750), <span class="occ">civil engineer and merchant</span>, possibly a native of Rotherhithe, Kent, was of unknown parentage. He was commissioned in the 4th regiment of foot and fought at the battle of the Boyne in 1690. He then served in the Netherlands, where he may have gained experience of hydraulic engineering. Following the treaty of Ryswick in 1697, Steers returned to England, and shortly after, in 1698 or 1699, he married Henrietta Maria (<i>d</i>. 1717), daughter of Abraham Barber, property owner of Rotherhithe, where Steers was then living. Of their five sons, two died in infancy, and one of their two daughters died in childhood.<br>
<br>At this time Steers was able to observe the construction of the country's first large wet dock, the Great Howland Wet Dock at Rotherhithe, which was in use by 1703. He produced a survey of the Wet Dock Field for Elizabeth Howland, the landowner, in 1707. In 1708 the engineer George Sorocold was consulted about a dock scheme in Liverpool. Following the passage of the relevant act of parliament, in May 1710 Steers went to Liverpool and produced his own plans for the town's first dock. Its construction was a considerable engineering feat&#151;an enclosed wet dock of 3&frac12; acres built within the pool, a tidal creek of the Mersey. The dock was in use by 1715 and the surrounding area reclaimed. In 1717 Steers was appointed dockmaster, and the following year he designed a wooden pier which he later replaced with a stone structure. From 1738 until his death Steers worked on Liverpool's second wet dock, the South (later Salthouse) Dock.<br>
<br>Steers was granted the freedom of the borough of Liverpool in 1713 and established a flourishing anchor smithy near the dock. He had interests in the West Indies trade and the Liverpool Waterworks Company. His public appointments and offices included water bailiff from 1724, town councillor from 1719, and mayor in 1739&#150;40. His reputation as an architect was based notably on St George's Church, completed in 1734, and on the first architectural stone-fronted dwelling house in Liverpool, in Hanover Street, built about 1740. As a speculative venture he built the Old Ropery Theatre in the 1740s. He strengthened Liverpool's fortifications in the Jacobite rebellion of 1745.<br>
<br>Steers was also a pioneer of river navigation and canal construction. In 1712 he surveyed the Douglas and the Mersey and Irwell navigation. He became one of their undertakers and carried out work on the Douglas near Rufford. Commissioned as consultant for the Newry Canal, he completed his survey in 1736 and between 1737 and 1741 spent twenty-five months on the project. This was the first summit-level canal in Britain, built to transport coal from co. Tyrone to Dublin. In 1740&#150;41 he produced a survey of the Calder and Hebble navigation.<br>
<br>Following the death of his first wife, in the second half of January 1721 Steers married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1765), widow of Thomas Tibington, mariner, of Rotherhithe and Wapping. They had two sons, one of whom died in childhood, and two daughters, the elder of whom died in infancy. Apparently a modest man, Thomas Steers was buried &#145;in a decent and private manner&#146; in St Peter's churchyard, Liverpool, on 2 November 1750. His son Spencer, the first child of Steers's second marriage, continued his interests in Liverpool. Steers was a distinguished early English civil engineer, and his dock laid the foundation of Liverpool's prosperity as a seaport.<br>
