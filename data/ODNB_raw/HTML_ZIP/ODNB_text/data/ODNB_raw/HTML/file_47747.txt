<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Shastri, Lal Bahadur</span>  (1904&#150;1966), <span class="occ">prime minister of India</span>, was born on 2 October 1904 at Mughal Sarai, Benares district, United Provinces, the second of three children of Sharda Prasad, teacher, and his wife, Ramdulari Devi, daughter of Hazarilal of Mirzapur. He had two sisters. His father died during his infancy in 1906, leaving the family with few resources. Lal Bahadur, a member of the Kayastha caste, lived ever after&#151;in later life by choice rather than necessity&#151;in simplicity, eschewing modern comforts and amenities, and at times even limiting consumption of basic necessities for himself and his family. He married Lalita Devi, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lalmani, daughter of Ganesh Prasad, on 16 May 1928; they had six children. He was educated at Harish Chandra high school and Kashi Vidyapith, Benares, the nationalist university, where he was among the first students admitted and from where he received his degree of Shastri, which he used ever after as his surname. He joined the Servants of the People Society upon his graduation and remained a member of it&#151;ultimately becoming its president&#151;for the rest of his life, which was otherwise devoted exclusively to political activity.<br>
<br>Lal Bahadur Shastri was a Gandhian, who lived simply and sought to work for the benefit of the poor and common people. He participated in all the major movements for independence, from the non-co-operation movement of 1921 to the movement of individual <i>satyagraha</i> in 1941, as a consequence of which he spent more than nine years in gaol in numerous terms of imprisonment. His political patrons included Purushottam Das Tandon, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant. He worked in Allahabad, after moving there in 1929, under Tandon in the Servants of the People Society and as secretary of the District Congress Committee, Allahabad, in both of which organizations Tandon was the president. At Allahabad Shastri became close to Nehru as well. From the 1930s on he progressed upward politically both in the party organization of the Indian National Congress and in legislative and governmental positions. Just before independence he became a trusted member of the government of Pandit Pant in United Provinces, where he served first as his parliamentary secretary, then as home minister from 1947 until 1951.<br>
<br>Shastri's move to Delhi occurred in 1951 as a consequence of the rift between two of his former patrons, Tandon and Nehru, which led to the displacement of Tandon by Nehru as president of the Indian National Congress. Nehru, who was also prime minister at the time, called Shastri to Delhi to become general secretary and to organize the party's first general election campaign in 1952. After the overwhelming victory of the Congress in the 1952 elections Shastri successfully contested election to the Rajya Sabha, the Indian upper house, after which he was taken into the government as minister for railways and transport. In a demonstration, rare in post-independence Indian politics, of strict responsibility and accountability for his performance, he resigned from his post in 1956 after a major railway accident in Madras, involving considerable loss of life. However, Nehru did not allow him to remain idle and assigned him the task of co-ordinating the election campaign of 1957. He was again taken into the council of ministers in 1957. In April 1961 he replaced Pandit Pant as home minister of the government of India. In 1963 he resigned from government once again under the Kamaraj plan, a major strategic political move which was ostensibly designed to improve the functioning of the Congress organizations and governments throughout the country, but which also laid the basis for the succession to Pandit Nehru, who became gravely ill in January 1964.<br>
<br>Shortly after Nehru's stroke Shastri, Nehru's chosen heir, was called to rejoin the cabinet as minister without portfolio. Upon Nehru's death he was selected unanimously, though not without some discontent among rival contenders, as the second prime minister of India. He was installed on 9 June 1964.<br>
<br>In his brief tenure as prime minister Shastri introduced economic policies in favour of agriculture and private investment which deviated from those of Nehru. However, his major contribution to Indian politics was as a &#145;troubleshooter&#146; for others and a peacemaker while in office, who worked to settle disputes in the party, the country, and international relations in several crises concerning Assam, Punjab, Kashmir, the official language issue, and relations between India and Ceylon, Nepal, and Pakistan. Ironically, though peace and conciliation were his hallmarks, his greatest accomplishment is often considered to be India's victory during his prime ministership in the Second Indo-Pakistan War. He died in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, on 11 January 1966, of heart failure, on the evening after signing the peace agreement there restoring the <i>status quo ante bellum</i>. Shastri, a Hindu, was cremated, the final irony being the naming of his cremation site, a national memorial in Delhi, as Vijaya Ghat, commemorating India's victory in the war against Pakistan. He was survived by his wife.<br>
