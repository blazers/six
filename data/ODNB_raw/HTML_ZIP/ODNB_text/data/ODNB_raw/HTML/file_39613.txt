<span class="headword">Cocks,  (Harry Francis) Lovell</span>  (1894&#150;1983), <span class="occ">United Reformed minister and theologian</span>, was born on 28 February 1894 at 4 Wesley Villas, New Windsor Street, Uxbridge, the son of Henry Edwin Cocks (1866?&#150;1950), manager of a rope factory, and his wife, Ada Emma Bryant (1866?&#150;1935), music teacher. He was educated at Uxbridge county school (1899&#150;1912). Under the guidance of F. L. Riches Lowe, minister of Providence Chapel, Uxbridge, from 1903 to 1933, he proceeded to Hackney (Congregational) college, London (1912&#150;17), where his teachers included P. T. Forsyth and A. E. Garvie. Impressed by both, it was to the former, he said, that &#145;I owe my theological soul and my footing in the Gospel&#146;  (&#145;New College&#146;, Lovell Cocks MSS, 12). Following his college course he gained first-class honours in both the London BD (1920) and BA (1923) and took his MA in metaphysics in 1926. He was awarded the DD of London University in 1943 for a dissertation published in abbreviated form under the title <span class="italic">By Faith Alone</span> (1943).<br>
<br>Meanwhile Cocks had been ordained at Winchester Congregational Church in 1917, where he quickly impressed the discerning as being &#145;a man with a message&#146;, and earned the loyalty and affection of many. On 9 November the following year he married Lottie Violet Mary (Dot) Bollen (1890&#150;1966). They had three children: Doris Evelyn, Peter Stuart, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75686/', "Michael Francis Lovell Cocks, Lord Cocks of Hartcliffe (1929&#150;2001)")</script>. On leaving Winchester, Cocks was minister at Hove, Sussex (1922&#150;7), and Headingley Hill, Leeds (1927&#150;32). He held the chair of systematic theology and Christian social philosophy at Yorkshire United Independent College, Bradford (1932&#150;7), and in the latter year became principal of the Scottish Congregational college, Edinburgh, where he also lectured in the postgraduate school of theology of the university. In 1941 he moved to Bristol where, in succession to R. S. Franks, he served as principal of Western (Congregational) College until his retirement in 1960.<br>
<br>Cocks was chairman of the Congregational Union of England and Wales (1950&#150;51); he addressed the united service of tribute to George VI in the Central Hall, Bristol, on 15 February 1952, and the seventh International Congregational Council at St Andrews in 1953. His Drew lecture on immortality was published as <span class="italic">The Hope of Glory</span> (1955), and in 1961 he preached the founder's day sermon at Bristol University. For two years (1958&#150;60) he was a member of the commission which produced the Congregational church's <span class="italic">Declaration of Faith</span> (1967), and in 1962, the tercentenary year of the Great Ejection, he was moderator of the Free Church Federal Council. In this significant year for English and Welsh nonconformity Cocks's moderatorial address was entitled <span class="italic">1662&#150;1962: Free Church Witness&#151;Then&#151;and Now?</span> On 5 April 1966 he broadcast an Easter talk in which, following a reference to the death of his wife a few weeks before, he went on to proclaim the Christian hope. In 1968 he returned to Bristol to deliver the sermon at the closing of Western College, which united with its sister institution in Manchester; and on 5 September of the same year he married Edith Ethel Mutlow, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Turner (1897&#150;1981). Prior to the formation of the United Reformed church in 1972 he delivered the sermon at the last meeting of the council of the Congregational church in England and Wales.<br>
<br>In his major work, <span class="italic">By Faith Alone</span>, Cocks argued that since the psychological and epistemological starting points of Schleiermacher and Kant respectively have been shown to lead to a theological humanism roundly denounced by Karl Barth, we must construe saving faith as presupposing natural faith, but as discontinuous with it. It is God's gift to human beings through his word, Jesus Christ. In <span class="italic">The Faith of a Protestant Christian</span> (1931) he sketched what became for him familiar themes: salvation by grace through faith, the necessity of the church, and the importance of its social witness. In the midst of war he published his incisive tract <span class="italic">The Nonconformist Conscience</span> (1943), in which he declared that &#145;The Nonconformist Conscience is the mark of a spiritual aristocracy, a counterblast to coronets and mitres&#146;  (p. 17); and in <span class="italic">The Religious Life of Oliver Cromwell</span> (1960) he argued that the lord protector owed much to Independency's principle of the gathered church. While finding much to admire in Cromwell, he lamented his blindness to the fact that &#145;not the sword but the Cross is the guarantee of final victory&#146;  (p. 79). That the atonement is the work of the triune God is the theme of <span class="italic">The Wondrous Cross</span> (1957), and, as he urged in <span class="italic">The Church in the Atomic Age</span> (1948), from the victory of the cross believers derive their confidence that &#145;Whatever happens now&#151;whether it be the worst we fear or the best we hope for&#151;God will wrest it to His saving purpose and overrule it for our eternal good&#146;  (p. 11).<br>
<br>Cocks died on 15 January 1983 at his home, 32 Highland Road, Amersham, Buckinghamshire. Over 200 people attended the funeral service at Amersham, where he was buried on 24 January, and John Huxtable, at whose own service of induction as secretary of the Congregational Union of England and Wales Cocks had preached, delivered a memorial sermon in Redland Park church, Bristol. Lovell Cocks valued Congregationalism's gathered church polity, which he construed as catholic, and his sympathies were ecumenical. He was a scholarly, modest man, who endeared himself to his students, and who was as adept at communicating with children and with the &#145;plain man&#146;&#151;not least through broadcast talks of which eight series were published&#151;as with his academic peers. He could be counted upon to find the right words on formal occasions, whether solemn or festive, and his integrity and pastoral care were greatly valued by all who knew him.<br>
