<span class="headword">Kirby,  Joshua</span>  (1716&#150;1774), <span class="occ">artist and architect</span>, was born at Parham, Suffolk, the second of eleven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15645/', "John Kirby (c.1690&#150;1753)")</script>, former schoolmaster and surveyor, and Alice Brown (1685/6&#150;1766). Educated at home, Glevering Mill, Joshua helped to collect material for his father's road-book, <span class="italic">The Suffolk Traveller</span> (1735) and a map of Suffolk (1736). Two of his drawings of Scole Inn, Norfolk, were engraved by John Fessey in 1739. In that year he married Sarah Bull (<i>c</i>.1718&#150;1775) of Framlingham and lived at Ipswich, where he had already joined a house- and coach-painting business: he also became active in St Mary-le-Tower church affairs.<br>
<br>Commissioned to design an altarpiece for St Mary's, Hadleigh, Suffolk, in 1744, in 1748 Kirby published <span class="italic">An historical account of the twelve prints of monasteries, castles, antient churches and monuments, in &hellip; Suffolk &hellip; drawn by J. Kirby</span>, which had been preceded by the twelve prints to which the publication referred. The views, engraved in London by Joseph Wood, were commended by George Vertue  (<span class="italic">Note Books</span>, 6.203), and Kirby's experience enabled him to assist his new friend Thomas Gainsborough with the painting of <span class="italic">St Mary's, Hadleigh</span> (<i>c</i>.1748; priv. coll.).<br>
<br>In London in 1751 Kirby, with William Hogarth, enjoyed the discomfiture of Thomas Hudson (whom he disliked), who was deceived by a pastiche Rembrandt etching which had been faked by their dinner host, Benjamin Wilson. That spring he also advertised Hogarth's prints for sale in the <span class="italic">Ipswich Journal</span> and invited subscriptions for his own <span class="italic">Dr. Brook Taylor's Method of Perspective Made Easy, both in Theory and Practice</span> that was published in February 1754 and dedicated to Hogarth, who contributed a comic frontispiece. In the previous month the Academy of Painting and Sculpture had approved Kirby's three lectures on perspective and his book, and elected him a member. Reprinted immediately (1755) with additions and again in 1765 and 1768, Kirby's book became the standard exposition of perspective for British artists until superseded by Thomas Malton's treatise in 1775. Maintaining an empiric approach, Hogarth stood firm with Kirby on disputed points, an association which led to Kirby's being featured in two of Paul Sandby's satirical prints on Hogarth's <span class="italic">Analysis of Beauty</span> in 1754. In June 1757 he responded to Isaac Ware's redundant translation in 1756 of L. Sirigatti's <span class="italic">Practice of Perspective</span> (1596) with a furious pamphlet, <span class="italic">Sirigatti Analys'd</span>. As this merely exposed his own limitations and conceit it was hastily withdrawn  (J. Highmore, <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, January 1758, 66).<br>
<br>Meanwhile, through the intercession of the earl of Bute, Kirby had become teacher of perspective and fortifications to the prince of Wales in 1756, having moved with his family to Great Queen Street, London, the previous September when he left the Ipswich business in the hands of Andrew Baldrey (<i>d</i>. 1802). Baldrey then acquired it in 1759 when the Kirbys moved to Kew Green, Richmond, Surrey. In 1761 Kirby published the handsome <span class="italic">Perspective of Architecture Deduced from the Principles of Dr. Brook Taylor</span> which included as plate 44 <span class="italic">House with a Colonnade</span> (drawing; Royal Collection) by the prince, who was closely involved with the publication and paid for the many illustrations. On his accession as George III in 1761, the king rewarded his jovial and devoted preceptor by appointing Kirby and his son William Kirby (1743&#150;1771) joint clerks of the works at Kew and Richmond  (TNA: PRO, WORK 5/69). The post was no sinecure and William, a promising artist, went with his wife to study architecture in Italy at the king's expense in 1768&#150;9. On their return William Kirby was given a house at Kew, where he died in 1771. Of Kirby's brothers who became lawyers, the elder brother John (<i>b</i>. 1715) died in 1750 while under-treasurer at the Middle Temple, and Stephen (<i>b</i>. 1717) was training under him but died in 1741. Kirby designed an extension to Kew chapel (never implemented, BL, Kings Maps, xl 46 h), having in 1762 built St George's Chapel in Brentford, Middlesex, where his daughter, Sarah [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27740/', "Trimmer, Sarah (1741&#150;1810)")</script>], the religious writer, married James Trimmer. With his younger brother, William, Kirby published revised editions of <span class="italic">The Suffolk Traveller</span> (1764) and his father's map (1766), embellished with more of his Suffolk views. In 1767 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.<br>
<br>Kirby contributed three drawings (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) to <span class="italic">Gardens and Buildings at Kew</span> (1763) by Sir William Chambers, who gave Kirby his many orders for works on the royal estates. Overwork was exacerbated by his presidency (1768&#150;71) of the Incorporated Society of Artists, assumed after dissensions had caused the resignation of most eminent directors. After assuming this position Kirby was soon humiliated by his chance discovery that the king with Benjamin West and Chambers was planning a royal academy, formed in December 1768. Although proposed as the academy's professor of perspective, Kirby stayed loyal to his society, struggling to retain the king's interest until ill health forced his resignation. From 1761 he had exhibited mainly drawings including <span class="italic">St Albans Abbey</span> (1767; department of prints and drawings, British Museum) but the oils <span class="italic">Kew Ferry</span> (1767) and <span class="italic">Ockham Mill</span> (1769) were attributed by Horace Walpole to the king. The only known landscape in oil signed by Kirby, dated 1761, is at Gainsborough's House, Sudbury, Suffolk.<br>
<br>Kirby died peacefully at Kew Green on 20 June 1774, and was buried in Kew chapel (now St Anne's, Kew). He had owned many works by Gainsborough (which appeared in the Trimmer sale, Christies, 17 March 1860), who had painted Kirby with his wife (<i>c</i>.1750; National Portrait Gallery, London) and separately in two further portraits (V&amp;A; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge). Such was Gainsborough's confidence in his &#145;old friend pudging Josh&#146;  (Grant, 1.63), whose faith in Heaven was proverbial, that he was buried alongside him at St Anne's, Kew.<br>
