<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilson,  John</span>  (1837&#150;1915), <span class="occ">trade unionist and politician</span>, was born on 26 June 1837 at Greatham near Hartlepool in co. Durham, the son of Christopher Wilson, labourer, poacher, and tramping quarryman, and his wife, Hannah (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Sponton). His mother died when he was only four and he spent much of the next seven or eight years accompanying his father as he moved around the country looking for work. His education was restricted to intermittent attendance at a series of dame-schools, but he had become a fluent reader by the age of six. His father died suddenly during the cholera epidemic of 1849 leaving the twelve-year-old Wilson a penniless orphan. Taken in by a local mining family, he began work underground at Ludworth colliery pushing tubs of coal weighing up to 10 cwt. By the age of sixteen he had become a hewer and worked in several different pits. It was a hard life; so too was the life of a merchant seaman which he took up for four years in 1856.<br>
<br>In 1860 Wilson returned to co. Durham and pit work and on 5 October 1862, at Shotton church, married a girl whom he had known since he was sixteen, Margaret, daughter of George Firth, a miner from Sherburn. They made their home at Haswell, co. Durham, where Wilson was a hewer at the local mine. In 1864 the couple emigrated to America where their first two daughters, Elizabeth and Jenny, were born. Wilson worked in mines in Pennsylvania and Illinois but the family returned to co. Durham and Haswell colliery in 1867. They rented a house in Long Row, close to where they had lived when first married. In the following years three more children were born: a son, Christopher, and two more daughters, Margaret and Dorothy.<br>
<br>From his early days as a collier, Wilson took a leading role in disputes between management and miners. He was prominent in the negotiations which led to the formation of the Durham Miners' Association (DMA) in 1869. As assistant to three local checkweighmen and part-time secretary of the Haswell co-operative store, he was easy to label as an agitator and was not re-engaged by the Haswell colliery management in 1870. His response was to become full-time at the local co-op but the colliery manager threatened miners on the committee with the sack if Wilson remained secretary. He moved to Wheatley Hill where he organized a branch of the DMA, but by 1877 he was again refused work at the colliery. With his wife he ran a stationery shop for a time but in 1878 he was selected by the Miners' National Association as an organizer for the midlands. The rest of his working life was to be spent in the worlds of trade union organization and politics.<br>
<br>This decisive moment had not long been preceded by another, his conversion to Primitive Methodism. Like many northern miners' leaders, Wilson was an enthusiastic gambler and a heavy drinker. In the middle of a game of cards one pay Saturday he suddenly decided to give up gambling after, as he described it in his autobiography, &#145;a curious wave of sensation came over me&#146;  (Wilson, 202). He found life without drink more difficult, but by the early 1870s he had become a teetotaller and a Sunday school teacher.<br>
<br>Wilson returned to Durham in May 1882 when he was appointed agent and general treasurer of the Durham Miners' Association. In 1890 he became the union's financial secretary and in 1896, not long before his sixtieth birthday, the general secretary, the highest-ranking official in the union. He was to hold this position until his death. Wilson was not one of those trade unionists who favoured aggressive action against both colliery owners and capitalism. He believed that industrial relations should be based on conciliation and he was in favour of the &#145;sliding-scale&#146; system which pegged wages to the selling price of coal. He was also committed to the idea of local action and local independence. He took a leading part in opposing the agitation among trade unionists for an eight-hour day, the Durham hewers having negotiated a shift of seven hours in 1890, and he was instrumental in keeping the DMA out of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB), set up in 1889. After joining for a few months in 1892, the DMA left in 1893 and did not return until 1908. Wilson opposed Rule 20 of the federation which facilitated nationwide united action in the event of dispute with the employers. He similarly opposed the idea of a single conciliation board for all British coalfields. It was 1943 before one was formed.<br>
<br>When the household suffrage was extended to the counties in 1884 Wilson soon became one of the first working men to be returned to parliament. In the general election of 1885 he beat a local coal owner by almost 2000 votes in Houghton-le-Spring, a constituency dominated by Durham miners. Soon after, Gladstone declared his intention to give home rule to Ireland and in the election which followed in 1886, Wilson was defeated. Four years later, however, he became MP for Mid Durham, a seat he held until his death, being returned unopposed in 1906 and in both elections in 1910.<br>
<br>Wilson was a Liberal and an admirer of Gladstone. He was in favour of free education, free trade, freedom of conscience, self-help, and self-improvement. In 1906 he could not prevent advocates of independent labour representation in Durham carrying a resolution committing the DMA to running all its further parliamentary candidates &#145;independent of all political parties&#146;  (Gregory, 73). When the MFGB decided to affiliate to the Labour Party in 1908 Wilson was one of three Lib&#150;Lab MPs, all from the north-east, who refused to join. He once said that he would never vote for a working man who represented working-class interests only. He did not believe that &#145;a man should go to parliament for that and put himself on a level with the landowner and aristocrat&#146;  (ibid., 66).<br>
<br>Wilson was a good speaker and impressed both Erskine May and President Cleveland of the United States who, after meeting him in 1897, asked, &#145;are such men as Wilson common among the democracy of Great Britain?&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 March 1915). His autobiography was serialized in the <span class="italic">Durham Chronicle</span>, published by it in cheap book form and in a new edition entitled <span class="italic">Memoirs of a Labour Leader</span> in 1907. Wilson's wife died on 8 May 1908. Wilson himself died on 24 March 1915 at 14 North Road, Crossgate, Durham; he was buried in St Margaret's cemetery, Durham, on 27 March.<br>
