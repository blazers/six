<span class="headword">Thackrah,  Charles Turner</span>  (1795&#150;1833), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born on 22 May 1795 in Leeds and baptized at St John's Church, Briggate, Leeds, on 13 July 1795, the son of George Thackrah (1770&#150;1820), a chemist and druggist, and his wife, Alice Leader (1771&#150;1828). In addition to residences in Leeds, his family had connections in the nearby village of Shadwell. Thackrah originally intended to fulfil his mother's wish that he should have a career in the clergy, and he studied under several local clergymen. However, in 1814 he enrolled as a pupil at the Leeds Infirmary, and in 1815 he moved to London, where for two years he attended lectures at Guy's Hospital, studying under Sir Astley Cooper. In October that year he joined the physical society at Guy's. In March 1816 Thackrah applied to practise as an apothecary, but was refused permission as he was not yet twenty-one; after a wait of three months he was admitted to the Society of Apothecaries. Thackrah's premature attempt to take the apothecaries' examination was illustrative of the tremendous drive and self-belief which characterized his approach to his medical studies and his later career. Thackrah contracted tuberculosis while in London, and, though his poor health did not diminish his ambition, it caused him much suffering and depression throughout the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>On returning to Leeds in 1817 Thackrah established a private practice and supplemented his income by becoming town surgeon, with responsibility for the care of the town's paupers. In 1818 he wrote a prize-winning essay on the properties of the blood, particularly the process of coagulation, which brought him into dispute with William Hey, the dominant figure at Leeds Infirmary. The argument was resolved in Thackrah's favour after experiments at a local slaughter-house. The essay was published in 1819 and posthumously with a biographical memoir in 1834. In 1821 Thackrah's prestige in Leeds grew after he was invited to give the inaugural address at the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society, for which he acted as joint secretary from 1819 to 1822. In 1823 and 1824 he gave public lectures on physiology at the Philosophical Hall. He became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1821. In 1823 Thackrah's growing reputation was tarnished when it was revealed that he was the father of an illegitimate child, Charles Turner Thackrah Wailes, who was born following an affair with a patient. He acknowledged his son in his will with a legacy of &pound;200. In the spring of 1824 Thackrah married Mary Henrietta, daughter of J. Scott of Wakefield, with whom he had one daughter, Mary Henrietta, born in 1825; mother and child both died in 1828. In 1830 he married Grace, daughter of A. Greenwood of Dewsbury Moor.<br>
<br>Thackrah also had ambitions as a teacher, in the tradition of his own mentor, Astley Cooper. He began by taking on a few apprentices, before establishing his own school of anatomy at 9 South Parade. Things did not go entirely smoothly. His attempts to have the school recognized by the Royal College of Surgeons were constantly refused, and his efforts to promote the school met with hostility from some of his colleagues at the Leeds Infirmary, particularly when he championed junior members' accusations of misconduct among senior staff. The dispute came to a head in 1827 when one of Thackrah's pupils was successfully prosecuted for an assault on the sub-apothecary at the infirmary, following an argument at a clinical session conducted by the senior surgeon, Samuel Smith. Thackrah sought to defend his student's actions in the local press, claiming that his student was provoked by Smith, whom he accused of conducting a personal attack on himself. Thackrah did little to help his cause with the verbose and arrogant style of his letter, which included a list of all his achievements and publications. Smith replied with an equally vitriolic letter challenging Thackrah to a public contest in dissection, to which Thackrah responded disdainfully by saying that one of his students could attend in his place. After this confrontation Thackrah continued with his teaching and his research, which included a study of cholera. By the time the Leeds medical school was founded in 1831, his rift with the local medical establishment had healed; though not a founder of the school, Thackrah was invited to teach and to merge his school with the new institution.<br>
<br>However, it is not as a pioneer of medical education that Thackrah is best remembered, but for his writings on occupational disease. Some commentators have suggested that Thackrah's interest in preventive medicine and occupational diseases was stimulated by a meeting with Robert Owen in Leeds in 1815, yet there is no evidence that the two actually met. Thackrah's knowledge of occupational disease came from several years of careful observation, commencing with his appointment as town surgeon and aided by local investigations undertaken by his students. In 1831 Thackrah summarized his observations in a treatise, <span class="italic">The Effects of the Principal Arts, Trades on Health and Longevity</span>, in which he detailed diseases associated with more than 150 occupations. He also advised on how such diseases could be prevented with reference to diet, alcohol abuse, posture, exercise, pollution, and ventilation. In particular Thackrah studied the impact of the new textile factories on workers' health. Among workers in the flax-spinning industry he observed that the dusty atmosphere of workshops was associated with a high incidence of respiratory disease. However, his greatest criticism of the new factory system was directed towards the exploitation of children. His treatise was well received by factory reformers and was quoted by Michael Sadler when introducing the <span class="roman">Ten Hours Bill</span> in March 1832; in the same year Thackrah shared a platform with Robert Oastler in support of the Ten Hours Movement. The treatise was to remain the standard work on occupational diseases for the next sixty years.<br>
<br>In 1833 Thackrah bought an estate in Shadwell, in response to his wife's concerns over his failing health. Commenting on his last days, his pupil H. Y. Whytehead wrote:<blockquote>Bodily suffering, and the entreaties of his dearest friends, were insufficient to induce him to relax his ardour in the pursuit of fame. His health was manifestly declining, and the short intervals of repose, in which he indulged when nature could endure no more, only served to protract his sufferings. A pulmonary affection was superadded to his original visceral disease. (Whytehead, 18&#150;19)</blockquote>Thackrah died of tuberculosis on 23 May 1833.<br>
