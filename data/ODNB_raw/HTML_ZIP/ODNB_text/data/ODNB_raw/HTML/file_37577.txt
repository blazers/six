<span class="headword">Howson,  George</span>  (1886&#150;1936), <span class="occ">founder of the British Legion Poppy Factory</span>, was born on 7 September 1886 at the rectory in Overton, Flintshire, the youngest in the family of four sons (the eldest of whom died in infancy) and one daughter of George John Howson (1854&#150;1943), rector of Overton, and his wife, Ethel, daughter of Thomas Dealtry, vicar of Maidstone. At his christening his mother gave him a second forename, Arthur, which he did not like and never used. Descended from generations of churchmen on both sides&#151;his paternal grandfather, John Saul Howson, was dean of Chester; his maternal great-grandfather, Thomas Dealtry, was bishop of Madras&#151;Howson derived from this upbringing a strong sense of service. His eldest brother, Roger, followed his father, first to Haileybury, then to Cambridge, and later became librarian at Columbia University, New York; the next brother, Geoffrey, also went to Haileybury, and thence into the Indian army, serving in both world wars. George was educated at Loretto School, Musselburgh, and at Heriot-Watt Engineering College, Edinburgh, which formed his practical outlook.<br>
<br>George Howson became assistant manager at the Melalap rubber estate in British North Borneo from 1909. As vicar of Christ Church, Salford, Howson's father had known several directors of the Manchester Rubber Co., who leased the estate and aimed to exploit the rising demand for tyres. Howson's Borneo experiences were testing. The isolation necessitated self-reliance and improvisation. Machinery had to be maintained and adapted to the task by the man on the spot. Chinese and Javanese contract labourers made a rough workforce. Howson, who confronted more than one disturbance, had little respect for the arbitrariness of his superior, a Dutchman, who was murdered in 1914.<br>
<br>At that time Howson was in England on sick leave, his health weakened by malaria, dysentery, and jaundice; he was preparing to return to Borneo when European war broke out. In September he joined, as a second lieutenant, the 11th service battalion of the Hampshire regiment. He served throughout the war: at the Somme, Messines, Passchendaele, Cambrai, and in the retreat and final offensive in 1918. At Pilckem Ridge on 31 July 1917 Howson's unit was undertaking road repairs during persistent shelling. Howson, by then a captain, won the MC for &#145;splendid work encouraging his men and refusing to go back&#146;, despite a shrapnel wound in one arm. Howson was promoted major and remained on the army list until May 1920. On 10 September 1918 at St Paul's, Onslow Square, London, he married Jessie (<i>b</i>. 1883/4), daughter of William Gibson of Melbourne, a Scottish-Australian department-store magnate. Jessie had been studying art at Munich before the war and there met Howson's sister, Joan, also a student, who later established a stained-glass factory at Putney which provided windows for the chapter house of Westminster Abbey. Howson's marriage brought personal happiness and financial independence: Jessie inherited great wealth upon her father's death on 5 November 1918.<br>
<br>After the war Howson became the founding chairman of the Disabled Society: among his co-founders was Major J. B. B. Cohen MP, who lost both legs at Ypres in 1917. They lobbied the government to improve the quality of artificial limbs, publishing their own guide. Howson's engineering expertise was invaluable; so was his recognition that the disabled faced demoralization as well as hardship unless they secured employment. Armistice day 1921 saw the first poppy day appeal, sponsored by the British Legion. Symbolizing the slaughter of the Flanders battlefields, the fabricated poppies were initially imported from France, where they were made by war victims' families. British demand outstripped French supply, and the legion was obliged to turn to domestic artificial-flower manufacturers, a trade notorious for sweated labour. Howson persuaded the legion to contract the Disabled Society to supply the 1922 armistice day appeal. Given six months to deliver, Howson wrote to his parents on 14 May 1922:<blockquote>it is a large responsibility and will be very difficult. If the experiment is successful it will be the start of an industry to employ 150 disabled men. I do not think it can be a great success but it is worth trying. I consider the attempt ought to be made if only to give the disabled their chance. I have to find a factory tomorrow and interview men. (Royal British Legion Poppy Factory archive)</blockquote>Howson started production in a former collar factory off the Old Kent Road on 8 June 1922 with a workforce of five disabled men. He had not only to acquire knowledge of the artificial-flower trade but to compete, while paying full male wages, against other manufacturers who employed low-waged girls. His practical genius for ergonomics enabled him to adapt tasks to suit his workforce's restricted capacities. Over forty disabled former servicemen were employed within a month, and they produced their first million poppies within two months. By 1924, 185 people were employed, whose average disability was between 60 and 70 per cent. Preference was given to the most disabled and to those with dependants; yet the more Howson employed, the longer grew the waiting-list of applicants. In November 1924, when 27 million poppies had been produced, the prince of Wales made the first royal visit to the factory. Howson understood the value of such publicity and exploited a court connection with Lady Cynthia Colville, daughter of the marquess of Crewe, made when Howson's father was vicar of Crewe. Howson also cultivated the president of the British Legion, Earl Haig: their sons attended Stowe School, and when Haig died he left Howson his dispatch case.<br>
<br>In 1925 the Disabled Society merged with the British Legion. The poppy factory became a limited company, with Howson as its chairman, moving in 1926 to new premises, an old brewery on Petersham Road, Richmond, where it remains still. The purchase was made possible only by Howson's donation of family money. The modern factory and accommodation for disabled workers and their families, built under Howson's direction, stand as monuments to his philanthropy and enterprise. This was recognized by the British Legion in 1930, when it stated that its ability to assist all former servicemen, fit as well as disabled, depended on the annual poppy day collection. Howson also struck the public imagination in 1928 by devising the field of remembrance service at Westminster Abbey, thereafter the central ceremony in the annual homage the nation pays to its war dead. Remembrance crosses and wreaths became major items in the factory's production, in addition to the poppies.<br>
<br>Howson had never been in good health since Borneo. Addiction to strong Turkish cigarettes did not improve it. These he bought 10,000 at a time, and those that survived his last purchase malingered, according to his children, into the 1950s. What politics he had were of the Baldwin Conservative hue, and more by temperament than reflection. He was a straightforward patriot, who sighed when Britain went off the gold standard, believing this to mark the end of empire. Above all, he was a man of action. His deepest hatred was for indulgent idleness. The custodial use of the wealth he enjoyed through his marriage was exemplary. The man of action was also a man of natural sensitivity towards suffering. He never patronized the disabled but restored in them a zest for life and work. In public and in private Howson showed the same inventiveness and fun. At Hyde Cottage, Hambleden, his home near Henley-on-Thames, he rigged up a flying fox between trees across the lawn to amuse his children. During his final illness, on being moved from the family town house in Kensington to a nursing home, he asked the ambulance to make a detour via the poppy factory. Some 365 disabled veterans were then producing 29 million poppies annually. They evacuated the workshops to salute Howson who gathered strength to sit up and lead the singing of &#145;Old Soldiers Never Die&#146; and his own version of a popular ditty, &#145;It Ain't Goin' to Pain No More&#146;. He told the foreman, &#145;Remember, if I peg out, I go in the factory van&#146;, and as the ambulance set off, he struck up the singing of &#145;Are We Downhearted?&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 November 1936). He died on 28 November 1936 at 5 The Boltons, South Kensington, of cancer of the pancreas; the interment at Hambleden was conducted by his father, then archdeacon and canon emeritus of Liverpool. George Howson was survived by his wife and four children, the eldest of whom, his only son, Peter (<i>b</i>. 1919), became a government minister in Australia.<br>
