<span class="headword">Vaughan,  Arthur</span>  (1868&#150;1915), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born on 7 March 1868 at 34A Pembroke Square, London, the son of William Vaughan, a civil service clerk and later actuary to the Board of Trade, and his wife, Julia Ward. From University College School, he entered University College, London, in 1885, gaining a first-class degree in mathematics. He then entered Trinity College, Cambridge, with a mathematical scholarship and in 1891 was awarded first-class honours in the part two mathematical physics tripos. In the same year, on 28 July, he married Frances Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1962), daughter of Walter Hawkes, butcher. On leaving Cambridge he accepted a post as senior science master at the army coaching establishment in Clifton, Bristol. There he remained until 1910 when he was offered a lectureship in geology at Oxford University.<br>
<br>While at University College, Vaughan had come under the influence of Professor Bonney, then also president of the Geological Society of London. Thus Vaughan's earliest scientific papers were on the physics of the earth. However, soon after his move to Bristol, Vaughan came under the twin influences of Edward Wilson (curator of the Bristol Museum) and Sidney Reynolds (professor of geology at the University College in Bristol)&#151;influences which led him into the fields of stratigraphy and palaeontology.<br>
<br>In all, Vaughan published twenty-six geological papers, mainly on palaeontology and stratigraphy of the Lower Carboniferous Limestone in the Bristol district. It was his mastery of this field which was to win him the Oxford lectureship and world renown. Vaughan demonstrated persuasively, on the basis of examining strata exposed in the Avon Gorge in Bristol, that there was a sequence of coral and brachiopod species in the limestones and that this could be used for detailed correlation with strata in other areas. In the Avon Gorge limestones, Vaughan established twelve biozones, each characterized by a distinctive species and fossil assemblage, through 800 metres of sediment from the base of the Carboniferous to the beginning of the Millstone Grits (a span later recognized as 30 million years). At the time, this was an immense leap in precision correlation. Vaughan soon extended his correlation to south Wales and to Ireland, and later to Belgium, demonstrating the wide validity of his principles. Some of Vaughan's contemporaries had doubts, and thought that the species ranges represented not time zones but environmental habitats, which might disappear, only to reappear again at a later time, in perhaps another place; so the correlation could be ecological and not evolutionary. Notwithstanding these doubts, the Vaughan scheme was adopted throughout Britain and used for over sixty years until a lithologically based stratigraphy was introduced in the late 1960s. Vaughan's pioneering researches were based on painstaking and prolonged fieldwork, often done in his spare time, with little if any financial support, and often while suffering from poor health. They earned him many distinctions and his contributions have played a major role in the evolution of understanding of Lower Carboniferous stratigraphy.<br>
<br>Vaughan courageously fought increasing limitations to physical activity during the last decade of his life. His outstanding mental powers for clear-sighted logical analysis remained with him to the end. To his many friends he was always genial and loyal. He died at his home, 315 Woodstock Road, Oxford, on 3 December 1915, survived by his wife and two children.<br>
