<span class="headword">Simon <span class="st"> [Simeon]</span> Stock</span> <span class="st"> [St Simon Stock]</span>  (<em>supp. </em>1165&#150;1265), <span class="occ">hermit and monk</span>, is said to have been born in Kent in 1165. Although he is celebrated as the sixth prior-general of the Carmelite order, there are no contemporary references to him, unless the mention by the mid-thirteenth-century Dominican Gerard de Frachet of a Simon who is described as prior of the Carmelite order refers to Simon Stock. The earliest surviving list of priors-general of the order to list Simon dates from 1396. From the early fifteenth century a fuller tradition of his career emerged. A legendary preserved in three fifteenth-century manuscripts celebrates Simon as the eleventh out of sixteen notable saints of the order. According to his legend, Simon lived as a solitary hermit in the trunk of a tree, the practice to which he owed his cognomen. In 1201, aged thirty-six, he joined the Carmelite order, and later entered the convent at Hulme in Northumberland. Elected prior-general of the order in 1245, Simon oversaw the modification to the order's rule by Innocent IV (<i>r</i>. 1243&#150;54) in 1247 that brought it closer into line with other mendicant orders. In some versions of his legend he performed a miracle of turning water into wine in a consecrated chalice. He is also, in one version, credited with being the first Carmelite to receive a bachelor's degree at Oxford University. The most celebrated incident of his career was the vision granted to him in 1251, in which the Blessed Virgin instructed Simon to introduce into the order the wearing of the scapular, a garment consisting of two bands worn over each shoulder. Any friar wearing the scapular would be guaranteed his salvation. Later Carmelite historians, such as Bradley, Paleonydorus, Bostius, and Bale, embellished the outlines of this tradition. Most versions of the legend supply a note of those Englishmen of noble birth, including Edward II (<i>d</i>. 1327) and Henry, duke of Lancaster (<i>d</i>. 1361), said to have adopted the scapular on their deathbeds.<br>
<br>The &#145;scapular promise&#146; appears independently of Simon Stock in the literature of the order&#151;initially in the 1360s in an acrostic by Johann von Hildesheim (<i>d</i>. 1375). The tradition of the scapular promise, with its special grant of protection from the Blessed Virgin, developed from the papal protection granted to the Carmelites in the mid-thirteenth century to aid them in their expansion in western Europe. The legend of the scapular has obvious parallels with similar traditions developed by the Dominicans in the thirteenth century of divine approbation granted to the garments worn by the order, and is part of a wider concern among all mendicants to endow their habits with a distinctive spiritual identity.<br>
<br>By the fifteenth century the chronology of the Carmelites' migration to the West from the crusader states had been distorted. The Simon Stock legend thus has him joining the order in 1201, although the hermits of Mount Carmel were only recognized as an order by the papacy in 1226, and did not reach England until 1242. A hermit accustomed to the solitary life would have been an appropriate recruit for the order in its early days, but if an Englishman called Simon was among those hermits of Mount Carmel who formed a distinct community around 1200 and adopted a rule <i>c</i>.1205&#150;14, and was in 1245 elected prior-general of the order, he must have been born rather later than 1165. Simon is not mentioned in the <span class="italic">De adventu Carmelitarum in Angliam</span> of William of Coventry (<i>c</i>.1365) although an English Carmelite senior enough to be elected prior-general ought to have been at the forefront of the settlement in England. The legend of Simon Stock was ascribed by Launoy (1653) to Paleonydorus, who was writing in the 1480s, but it is evidently earlier than this, and possibly dates from the later fourteenth century. John Bale listed as Stock's works collections of homilies, pastoral letters, and hymns, but there is no other testimony for these. Simon supposedly died in 1265 in Bordeaux and was buried there.<br>
