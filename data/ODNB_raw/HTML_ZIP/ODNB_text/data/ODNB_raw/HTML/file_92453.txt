<span class="headword">Ryvere, Sir  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>1313, <em>d.</em> after 1364), <span class="occ">landowner and soldier</span>, was born on 24 January 1313, the eldest son of Sir John Ryvere (<i>d</i>. 1314) and his wife, Denise (<i>d</i>. 1347). The younger John, who was less than two when his father was killed at Bannockburn, inherited estates in Somerset, Buckinghamshire, and, above all, Gloucestershire, where he was lord of the manors of Tormarton and Acton Turville. After attaining his majority in 1333 Ryvere was several times a commissioner to enforce royal statutes in the localities, and was named a keeper of the peace in 1343. He also served the crown as a soldier, his early career taking a course familiar to the coterie of young knights who made up Edward III's circle in the years immediately before the outbreak of the Hundred Years' War. In particular he followed his father in campaigning in Scotland. In 1333 he took part in the long campaign that culminated in the battle of Halidon Hill on 19 July. Two years later he was stationed in the vanguard of the royal host mustered at Carlisle. And in the early months of 1338, by now a knight, he served in Scotland again, probably taking part in the earl of Salisbury's siege of Dunbar Castle.<br>
<br>Later accounts of his conduct during these wars chronicle Ryvere's reluctance to kill the enemy, or even to inflict the slightest injury. Perhaps it was the brutal nature of war on the Anglo-Scottish borders that subsequently made Sir John resolve to direct his arms to the crusades in the East and the war against the Turks instead of against his fellow Christians. In the meantime he demonstrated his religious devotion closer to home, by founding a chantry at St Mary's Church, Tormarton. An initial foundation, in a chapel built next to the church, was confirmed by Bishop Simon Montagu of Worcester on 11 March 1337, who noted that Sir John intended to endow it more abundantly. This he did, first with lands in Tormarton and then with the advowson of Acton Turville church. Tormarton church, too, became part of the endowment, which in 1346 was valued at 100 marks (&pound;66 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.). Ryvere also drew up detailed regulations for his chantry, which was to be manned by a warden, four chaplains, two clerks, and three choristers, and gave particular attention to their vestments. For their further maintenance he gave them oxen, horses, and sheep worth &pound;20. Probably it was to meet these expenses that Sir John resorted to borrowing&#151;he is recorded as owing &pound;420 in 1337 (duly repaid) and &pound;152 in 1343&#151;while in 1344 he sold 1500 wethers to Sir Thomas Berkeley.<br>
<br>In 1346 Ryvere took up arms again, but not on behalf of the English crown. On 20 June, barely a week before Edward III and his army embarked for France, he was licensed to go to the Holy Land, while on 16 August he received a papal safe conduct &#145;in fulfilment of a vow for the saving of his soul&#146;, to go &#145;in aid of the faithful against the Turks&#146;  (<span class="italic">CEPR letters</span>, 3.128). Probably his intention was to join the Christian naval league then operating out of Smyrna (present-day Izmir, on the west coast of Turkey). Accompanying him were John Noble, priest, and John Wayfor, &#145;donsel&#146; (a page or squire), two long-serving members of his household. It is not clear whether the party reached Smyrna, but over the next year or so Sir John, at considerable personal risk, began to criss-cross the lands round the eastern Mediterranean in a series of intelligence-gathering missions, travelling deep into the hinterland of Egypt and along the shores of Palestine. Newsletter reports tell how Ryvere spent many months completing a reconnaissance of mameluke palaces, &#145;inside and out&#146;, investigating the material strength of the Egyptian army, and recording the disposition of enemy seaports, towns, villages, and other fortifications.<br>
<br>Ryvere was one of a clutch of men, usually missionaries or traders, upon whom the papacy relied for up-to-date intelligence concerning the Muslim enemy. He reported his findings in person to the papal court in March 1348. Encouraged by news of economic and political crisis within the Egyptian sultanate, Pope Clement VI recommended that Ryvere's account be published throughout Christendom for use in the next expedition to the Holy Land. The papal letters also report that Ryvere had fought valiantly on the front lines, on land and sea, against both mameluke and Turk, repeatedly raising his war banner in enemy territory. He had also reached Jerusalem, for as a patron of the increasingly popular, though thinly documented, chivalric order of the knights of the Holy Sepulchre, Ryvere had knighted several noble pilgrims at a ceremony in the church for which the order was named.<br>
<br>Ryvere returned to England in the spring of 1348. Perhaps the cost of his expedition to the East led to financial embarrassment, since he seems to have lost possession of the manor of Tormarton, which is at various times reported in the hands of the Wilingtons and of the bishop of Winchester. The details are obscure, but as the manor eventually reverted to the Ryveres, it may have been used as a surety for Sir John's debts. He was appointed to commissions in 1348 and 1351, but thereafter played little part in public life, and eventually he left it for good. In 1341 he was recorded as married to a woman named Margaret (her surname is unknown). On 15 October 1364, perhaps following Margaret's death, he was licensed to become a Dominican friar in the order's London convent. However, he is not recorded among the house's inmates who took orders, and though it is not known when or where he died, it is possible that Ryvere never left Tormarton, for what is purportedly his tomb lies in the chancel of the church there, with the matrix of a monumental brass upon it. It depicts a man supporting a church or chapel, a device taken to indicate a founder. Probably Sir John had secured the future of his estates before he retired from the world, for although his marriage appears to have been without male issue, it is almost certain that the Sir Henry Ryvere who served as sheriff of Gloucestershire in 1391&#150;2 and 1399&#150;1400, and was a knight of the shire for the county in 1394, was his nephew from a cadet line.<br>
