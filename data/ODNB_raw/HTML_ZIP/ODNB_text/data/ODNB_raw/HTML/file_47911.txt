<span class="headword">Maxwell,  John</span>  (1877&#150;1940), <span class="occ">film financier and cinema owner</span>, was born in Scotland. He trained as a solicitor and practised in Glasgow. In 1912 he acquired an interest in a Glasgow cinema and over the next ten years built up a circuit of twenty cinemas and set up Waverley Films as the regional distributor for a London-based company, Wardour Films. In 1923 Maxwell took over Wardour and in 1925 he moved to London. Wishing to take advantage of the <span class="roman">Cinematograph Films Act</span> of 1927, he expanded into the production side of the industry, buying out the troubled consortium responsible for building Elstree Studios, and establishing British International Pictures (BIP) in April 1927. True to its name, BIP recruited prestigious figures such as the German director E. A. Dupont, the American director Harry Lachman, and a promising young English director, Alfred Hitchcock, and attempted to make films for the international market. Maxwell was married, and he and his wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1951), had one son and six daughters.<br>
<br>Unfortunately Maxwell's bold attempt to make ambitious British silent films coincided with the arrival of the &#145;talkies&#146;. Maxwell responded rapidly to the change, installing American RCA sound equipment at Elstree and announcing plans for multilingual production. But when Hitchcock's modestly budgeted <span class="italic">Blackmail</span> (1929), Britain's first talkie, proved more popular with audiences than ambitious epics such as Dupont's <span class="italic">Atlantic</span> (1929)&#151;a slow-moving account of the <i>Titanic</i> disaster made separately in English, French, and German&#151;Maxwell reversed his policy and began making low-budget films for the domestic market. To ensure that his films had an outlet, he began to buy up cinemas. In November 1928 he registered Associated British Cinemas (ABC) as a public company with capital of &pound;1 million. In July 1929 it had a circuit of 80 cinemas, and by the end of 1931 this had grown to 160. In September 1933 ABC, BIP, and Wardour Films were consolidated into a single company, the Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC).<br>
<br>A year later in 1934 Maxwell made a bid for his only serious rival in the British film industry, the Ostrer brothers' Gaumont-British Picture Corporation. The bid was unsuccessful, but in October 1936 Maxwell announced that he was to acquire a majority interest in Metropolis and Bradford, the holding company which controlled Gaumont-British. However, his option on the voting shares was blocked by Twentieth Century Fox, which also had shares in and aspired to control Gaumont-British. Deadlock resulted in a court case and a Board of Trade inquiry, but Maxwell had to admit defeat and abandon his dream of dominating the British film industry. Although the Gaumont-British deal failed (it was J. Arthur Rank who finally, in 1941, gained control over the Gaumont-British empire), ABPC continued to expand. In October 1937 Maxwell acquired the 168 cinemas of the Union circuit, merging them into his ABC circuit, which with a total of 493 cinemas was now the biggest in the country.<br>
<br>Some significant films emerged from Elstree but the studio never acquired the prestige of Alexander Korda's Denham, nor the popular identity of Michael Balcon's Ealing. John Maxwell was always more of a businessman than an impresario. But in the British film industry of the 1930s, plagued by alarming booms and slumps, Maxwell's achievement in building up a major cinema circuit, supplying it with a steady output of British films, and providing his shareholders with regular, if unspectacular, dividends, was a rare and considerable one.<br>
<br>Maxwell was a diabetic and had been in poor health since 1937. He died on 2 October 1940 at his home, Rockwood, Brook, Witley, Surrey, aged sixty-three. The Second World War had led to the requisitioning of Elstree Studios and at the time of Maxwell's death the blitz was threatening the prospect of cinema-going in Britain. Two years later, however, cinema attendance had risen above its pre-war peak and the ABC cinema chain was making record-breaking profits.<br>
<br>An appreciative, if somewhat over-laudatory, obituarist in <span class="italic">The Times</span> noted Maxwell's &#145;deservedly high reputation for sound financial insight&#146;, adding that he had given the public the best pictures available, together with comfort and luxury  (4 Oct 1940).<br>
