<span class="headword">Lawrence,  Arnold Walter</span>  (1900&#150;1991), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, was born at 2 Polstead Road, Oxford, on 2 May 1900, the fifth of five illegitimate sons of Thomas Robert Lawrence and Sarah Lawrence, the names adopted for purposes of parentage by Sir Thomas Robert Tighe Chapman (1846&#150;1919), bt, and Sarah Junner (1861&#150;1959). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34440/', "Thomas Edward Lawrence (1888&#150;1935)")</script> was one of his brothers. He was educated at the City of Oxford School and New College, Oxford, and graduated with a third in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1921, having acquired the diploma in classical archaeology the year before. Blessed with private means, he was a student at the British Schools at Rome and Athens from 1921 to 1926, the last two years as Craven fellow of Oxford University, and travelled widely to examine Greek and especially Hellenistic sculpture. A season at Ur in 1923 under Leonard Woolley convinced him that excavation was not his line. In 1925 he married Barbara Innes (1902&#150;1986), daughter of the Revd Edgar Wesley Thompson, and a fellow student. They settled at Hermitage in Berkshire. Their daughter, registered as Helen Thera, but soon renamed Jane, was born in 1926. At Hermitage, Lawrence put together the results of his studies and <span class="italic">Later Greek Sculpture</span>, the principal subject of his research, appeared in 1927. It was followed two years later by <span class="italic">Classical Sculpture</span>, a wider survey. In 1930 he was elected to the Laurence readership in classical archaeology at Cambridge, where he built a then very modern house on Madingley Road, the architect being his friend Marshall Sisson. Lawrence's interest had now turned away from sculpture and his next book, published in 1935, was <span class="italic">Herodotus</span>, a revision of George Rawlinson's translation with copious new notes.<br>
<br>Lawrence had always been close to his brother T. E. Lawrence&#151;the eldest brother had become a missionary and the two others were killed in the First World War&#151;and T. E. Lawrence's death in 1935 saddled him with a literary executorship which he performed long and faithfully, and with an embarrassing exposure to the devotees and denigrators of his famous brother. During the Second World War he was employed in generally futile jobs. In 1944 he succeeded A. J. B. Wace as Laurence professor of classical archaeology at Cambridge and as such was elected to a fellowship at Jesus College. In 1951 he obtained a Leverhulme research fellowship for the study of ancient fortifications, a subject inherited from T. E. Lawrence. The same year he resigned his Cambridge post to go to the Gold Coast (later Ghana) to be what was in effect archaeological supremo&#151;professor of archaeology at the University College, director of the National Museum, and secretary and conservator of the monuments and relics committee. He resigned these posts in 1957 and soon after settled at Pateley Bridge in Yorkshire, later moving up the dale to Bouthwaite. His <span class="italic">Greek Architecture</span> had appeared in 1957 and in retirement he wrote <span class="italic">Trade Castles and Forts of West Africa</span> (1960), <span class="italic">Greek and Roman Sculpture</span> (1972), a much revised version of his earlier book, and <span class="italic">Greek Aims in Fortification</span> (1979), which was followed by a long paper on Byzantine fortifications in the <span class="italic">Annual of the British School at Athens</span>, 1983. Eventually, when neither he nor his wife could any longer drive, they moved to Langford, near Biggleswade, where soon&#151;in 1986&#151;his wife died unexpectedly (his daughter having already died in 1978). Without her Lawrence lost interest and was quietly pining away, until Peggy Guido, an old friend, took him off to her house at 44 Long Street, Devizes, Wiltshire. There he revived and started working again on Herodotus. He died suddenly at Peggy's home on 11 March 1991.<br>
<br>Lawrence&#151;he did not like to be called by either of his forenames&#151;was a good-looking and active man, in character conscientious, hard-working, modest, and basically shy. In company, though, he liked to shock, and indulged an impish humour so that casual acquaintances tended to consider him shallow or frivolous. In contrast or reaction to his mother's doctrinal fervour Lawrence was conscientiously anti-religious. He did not seem troubled by his illegitimacy, which indeed few knew of before Richard Aldington's <span class="italic">Lawrence of Arabia</span> appeared in 1955. His marriage was a happy one. Barbara was an intelligent and attractive woman, with&#151;fortunately&#151;a less insistent conscience: she regularly accompanied him on his many travels. As a teacher, Lawrence was for long handicapped by his shyness and it was not until he went to Ghana that he became a confident lecturer. He was, though, a good judge of students and a helpful adviser. He was also, when he had the opportunity, a capable and energetic organizer, as he showed at Cambridge in the Museum of Classical Archaeology (of which as professor he was curator) and on a grander scale in Ghana. Lawrence's writings were on subjects unfashionable in Britain and he did not advertise himself by lecturing in other institutions or attending conferences, and his often unorthodox views made him suspect to some elder scholars, so that he was for long undervalued and his fellowship of the British Academy was disgracefully belated. But he was one of the more original classical archaeologists of his time, with an exceptional knowledge of other cultures, which he used with disconcerting effect. Deservedly, his later books became standard works.<br>
