<span class="headword">Placzek,  Joyce  Anstruther</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Jan Struther]</span>  (1901&#150;1953), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 6 June 1901 at 6 Chester Street, Belgravia, London, the daughter of Henry Torrens Anstruther (1860&#150;1926), a Scottish Liberal MP, and the Hon. Eva Isabella Henrietta Hanbury-Tracy (1869&#150;1935), whose father was Lord Sudeley. Joyce and her elder brother, Douglas (1893&#150;1956), were brought up by their mother after their parents were legally separated, dividing their time between Old Court House, Whitchurch, Buckinghamshire, and in London, 9 Little College Street, Westminster, and later 9 Swan Walk, Chelsea. Joyce's mother wrote articles for magazines (reprinted in <span class="italic">The Influence of Mars</span> in 1900); during the First World War she organized camp libraries for the troops and for this was created DBE. Joyce, educated by governesses and, briefly, at both Miss Ironside's and Miss Woolf's (where a fellow pupil was the future Queen Elizabeth, later the queen mother), had a somewhat stormy relationship with her mother. On a long visit to Egypt, where her father was director of the Suez Canal Company, she was able to acquire her excellent French.<br>
<br>In 1917 as Jan Struther she began to contribute articles and short stories to periodicals such as <span class="italic">Punch</span>, <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, and the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>. She also worked for a time as a secretary at Scotland Yard. &#145;At an early age she was engaged to a young Grenadier guards officer who killed himself because of gambling debts. This was the first of her many crises which threatened her fragile mental equilibrium&#146;  (Dolf Placzek). Jan was slim, tiny (5 feet 1 inch), and very pretty, with dark brown hair, large blue eyes, and a bright, lively manner that was always to make her the object of many men's attentions. On 4 July 1923 at All Hallows Church, London Wall, she married Anthony James Oliphant Maxtone Graham (1900&#150;1971), an old Etonian and Sandhurst-educated insurance broker at Lloyds and heir to an estate in Perthshire &#145;who had proved a stalwart friend in her first crisis&#146;  (ibid.). Three children were born in 1924, 1928, and 1931, and the family, who lived comfortably and could not have managed without Jan's earnings, made their home in Chelsea, at 27 Sydney Street and then at 16 Wellington Square. At weekends they rented the Chief Officer's House, Coastguard Cottages, Camber, near Rye, where Jan, a golf widow, wore a boiler-suit, built her own boat, was a keen botanist, and shied away from hated domesticity.<br>
<br>Having been asked (even though she was an agnostic) to contribute to an enlarged edition of <span class="italic">Songs of Praise</span> (1931), Jan wrote twelve new hymns, including three that were to become extremely well known: &#145;Daisies are our silver, buttercups our gold&#146;, &#145;When a knight won his spurs, in the stories of old&#146;, and &#145;Lord of all hopefulness, Lord of all joy&#146;. She published her first volume of poetry in 1931, some light-hearted but some, as she said, &#145;grim and stark and not at all charming&#146;  (<span class="italic">New York Herald Tribune</span>); this was followed by three more small volumes in 1932, 1936, and 1940.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Peter Fleming had written to Jan:<blockquote>If you ever read the articles on the Court page of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, you will have noticed that they are mostly about stoats. This seems to me a bad thing, and we should welcome a light and feminine touch occasionally. (Maxtone Graham MSS)</blockquote>Her brief was to write about &#145;an ordinary sort of woman, who leads an ordinary sort of life. Rather like yourself&#146;  (Struther, 372). On 6 October 1937 the first of thirty-five 1200-word pieces about Mrs Miniver appeared; they were enormously successful, causing much correspondence and the inevitable assumption (denied by Jan) that the Miniver family was based on the Maxtone Grahams. The lightly comic tone was deceptive, for the pieces were beautifully judged, timelessly observant, and full of quiet realism. (The self-mocking yet indomitable voice was one that, in the months leading up to the war, any German reader must have found utterly bewildering.) The articles were published as <span class="italic">Mrs Miniver</span> at the end of 1939. The book was successful, but even more so in America where it reached number one in the bestseller list and was a book-of-the-month selection. The book, and later on the 1942 film adaptation (loosely based on the book), was greatly to influence the American people's attitude to a Britain threatened by Nazi invasion. The film was immensely popular, and swept the Academy awards for that year, winning best picture, best script, best director (William Wyler), best actress (Greer Garson), and best supporting actress (Teresa Wright). &#145;Franklin D. Roosevelt himself is reported to have said to Jan&#146; that <span class="italic">Mrs Miniver</span> helped to bring America into the war  (private information, Dolf Placzek), and while this may be an exaggeration, its impact on American public opinion was significant.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Try Anything Twice</span>, a collection of essays, had appeared in 1938. Jan also wrote many (anonymous) fourth leaders for <span class="italic">The Times</span> and was the first woman to be on its editorial board. In June 1940 Jan took the two younger children to New York to stay with her sister-in-law Rachel Townsend at 1 Beekman Place; while they were at boarding-school she lived at 214 Central Park South, writing articles, going to Hollywood while MGM made <span class="italic">Mrs Miniver</span>, and becoming a well-known broadcaster on the radio programme <span class="italic">Information Please</span> (the perfect vehicle for her wit, general knowledge, and enormous vocabulary). She also edited <span class="italic">Women of Britain&#151;Letters from England</span> (1941). Above all, she carried out lengthy lecture tours in aid of the British war relief fund but &#145;a hundred hotel bedrooms in a hundred cities&#146;  (Struther, 21) exhausted her and she had a breakdown, thereafter remaining prone to depression and mental instability. This was despite her newfound happiness with Adolf (Dolf) Placzek (<i>b</i>. 1913), a Viennese whom she had first met in England when she worked for refugees.<br>
<br>Jan and the children sailed from Halifax, Nova Scotia, on VE-day 1945. But in London she and her husband, a prisoner of war from 1942 to 1945, found they had grown too far apart; she went back to New York and, when her first marriage had been dissolved, in 1948 married Placzek, by now a librarian at the Avery Architectural Library at Columbia University and later to be an eminent architectural historian. They lived at 68 West 68th Street but she also maintained a London home at 17 Alexander Place, South Kensington. <span class="italic">A Pocketful of Pebbles</span> (1946) reprinted her recent work. &#145;Her alleged leftist sympathies led to her being spied on during the McCarthy era by which she felt threatened&#146;  (private information, Dolf Placzek). She had begun her autobiography when, at first diagnosed as having breast cancer, she died of a brain tumour in New York on 20 July 1953. Her corneas were donated for transplant. Jan Struther's ashes were brought back to her father's grave at Whitchurch.<br>
