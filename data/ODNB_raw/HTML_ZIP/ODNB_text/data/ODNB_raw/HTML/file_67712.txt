<span class="headword">Aylmer,  Brabazon</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1645, <em>d.</em> in or after 1719), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was baptized on 7 December 1645 at St Mary's, Stoke Newington, Middlesex, the son of Anthony Aylmer (<i>d</i>. in or after 1661). His father was described as a gentleman of London in the apprentice records of the Stationers' Company when Brabazon was bound to Luke Fawne on 21 January 1661. He gained his freedom after the customary seven years' service in 1668, but only in 1671 did the first book with his imprint appear&#151;Isaac Barrow's <span class="italic">The Duty and Reward of Bounty</span>&#151;suggesting that he initially worked as a journeyman before setting himself up in his trade. Throughout his career Aylmer worked from a London address at the Three Pigeons against the Royal Exchange in Cornhill. According to his colleague and fellow bookseller John Dunton, he was:<blockquote>a very just and religious man &hellip; He is nicely exact in all his accompts, and is well acquainted with the mysteries of his Trade. [He] has been as often engaged in very honest and very useful designs as any other that can be named through the whole Trade. (Dunton, 1.206)</blockquote>Aylmer's distinctive publishing programme saw his involvement with a number of prestigious authors and titles in the latitudinarian and episcopal traditions. He became the regular publisher of Isaac Barrow and John Tillotson (archbishop of Canterbury, 1691&#150;4), and works by Edward Fowler, including <span class="italic">A Defence of the Resolution of this Case</span> (1684), appeared with his imprint. At the same time he handled numerous titles in the moderate nonconformist tradition, including William Bates's <span class="italic">The Danger of Prosperity</span> (1685), Thomas Manton's <span class="italic">Sermons</span> (1698), and works by John Howe. The usual publisher of George Keith's attacks upon the Quakers, Aylmer obtained the copyright for Milton's <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> in the early 1680s, though he soon sold on the right without publishing an edition. However, he published both Milton's <span class="italic">Epistolarum familiarum liber</span> (1674) and <span class="italic">Brief History of Muscovia</span> (1682), though he was refused a licence for Milton's letters of state. The fact that he confined himself to such works suggests a religious commitment of a recognizable type, encompassing the middle ground between moderate Anglicanism and moderate nonconformity. Moreover, his role as the publisher of major, large-scale titles, including three editions of Barrow's <span class="italic">Works</span>, and his work in partnership with William Rogers, Jonathan Robinson, and Thomas Parkhurst indicate a successful business operation and a secure place in the late seventeenth-century world of publishing.<br>
<br>Aylmer married his wife, Temperance (<i>fl</i>. 1682&#150;1695), probably in 1682, but nothing more is known of her. The couple had at least six children. Aylmer's date of death is unknown. He was last heard of in July 1719 when he signed a deposition, referring to himself as the former apprentice of Luke Fawne and instructing Fawne's heirs in America that most of his former master's assets had been lost in the great fire.<br>
<br>Aylmer's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_67712"></a><span class="headword">Brabazon Aylmer</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1683), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was baptized on 24 May 1683 at St Faith's under St Paul's, London. He was bound as an apprentice to his father on 7 February 1698 and received his freedom from the Stationers' Company seven years later. From that date it becomes impossible to say whether titles were published by father or son. The term catalogues for 1707 contain some entries for Brabazon Aylmer senior and junior together, but later entries and imprints fail to distinguish between the two. No imprints with the name occur after 1714, suggesting the termination of the publishing business in that year. The date of his death is unknown.<br>
