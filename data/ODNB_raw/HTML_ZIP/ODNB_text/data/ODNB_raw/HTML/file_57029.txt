</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Davidson,  William</span>  (1786&#150;1820), <span class="occ">conspirator</span>, was born in Jamaica, the second son of the attorney-general of Jamaica and an unnamed black woman. Educated there until age fourteen, William was sent to England, despite his mother's protests, to complete his education. Arriving in a country seething with revolutionary fervour, William gave up his studies of mathematics to go to sea. He was impressed into the Royal Navy from his merchant vessel. Once returned to England he was apprenticed, through the agency of his father, to a Liverpool lawyer and probably attended the University of Edinburgh for a while. However, he abandoned this to become apprenticed to a cabinet-maker. After an unhappy love affair in Lichfield, he moved to Birmingham where, with his mother's financial help, he set up his own business. This failed, however, probably due to the dire economic circumstances.<br>
<br>In London, where he must have taken up residence some time before 1816 (when his first son was born), Davidson married a widow, Sarah Leigh (possibly Lane), who had four children. The couple probably lived in Walworth, where Davidson taught at a Wesleyan Sunday school. He worked as a journeyman with a cabinet-maker named Cox, who found him an excellent workman. It was probably after he had been accused of molesting a young woman at the Sunday school&#151;an accusation against which his wife defended him&#151;that the couple moved to Marylebone and Davidson attempted again to set up his own business.<br>
<br>Times were hard and Davidson was soon penniless&#151;and in the thick of the London radical movements. He read the works of Thomas Paine and joined the Marylebone Union Reading Society. Meetings were held at his home and he formed a shoemaker's society. (Such societies were formed in the hopes of mobilizing the metropolis to overthrow the government; a provisional government would then introduce parliamentary and other reforms.)<br>
<br>One of the main speakers at a radical meeting in Finsbury Square, Davidson a few weeks later helped to guard the banner at the Smithfield meeting in November 1819. The flag, of a death's head, was emblazoned with the words &#145;Let us die like Men and not be sold like Slaves&#146;. Informers reported that Davidson and his colleagues guarding the flag were well armed.<br>
<br>It is possible that Davidson met George Edwards, a government spy and agent provocateur, at the procession of some 200,000 people and dinner given to honour &#145;Orator&#146; Hunt (of Peterloo fame) when he arrived in London in September 1819. Edwards apparently introduced him to Arthur Thistlewood, a prison-hardened radical who had witnessed the revolution in France. Davidson joined the group around Thistlewood, which, most likely at Edwards's instigation, decided that the quickest route to reform was to blow up the cabinet in what became known as the Cato Street conspiracy [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58584/', "Cato street conspirators (act. 1820)")</script>]. When a (false) date for a cabinet dinner was publicized, the men collected arms and ammunition. Raided by the police and the military in their Cato Street loft, the street entrance to which was guarded by Davidson, all but three of the conspirators were arrested. One policeman was killed upstairs in the loft. Thistlewood escaped, but Edwards &#145;found&#146; him the next day, and claimed the &pound;1000 reward for his capture.<br>
<br>Eleven men were tried in April 1820. Despite quoting <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> (and Alexander Pope) in his defence, Davidson was among the five who were hanged, decapitated, and then buried in quicklime under a prison passage. After the hanging, which took place outside Newgate Prison on 1 May 1820 and was witnessed by one of the largest crowds ever assembled in London, there was a public subscription for the dead men's wives and children, and to bring Edwards to court for high treason. Despite the intervention of Alderman Wood, this was unsuccessful: Edwards (one of many spies and provocateurs employed by the government) had been spirited out of the country by his masters.<br>
