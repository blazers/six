<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Parnell,  (Catherine Maria) Anna Mercer</span>  (1852&#150;1910), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist and artist</span>, was born on 13 May 1852 at home at Avondale, co. Wicklow, the tenth of eleven children and fifth daughter of John Henry Parnell (1811&#150;1859) and Delia Tudor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stewart (1816&#150;1896). Her older brothers were John Henry Parnell MP and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21384/', "Charles Stewart Parnell MP")</script>, leader of the Irish nationalists. Her older sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21385/', "Fanny Parnell (1848&#150;1882)")</script> also was involved in Irish politics. The Parnells were part of the protestant ascendancy, a number having established &#145;patriot&#146; reputations, while Delia Stewart came from a line of distinguished Americans.<br>
<br>Following her father's death in 1859, Anna Parnell and her mother had to abandon the family home, Avondale, and resided first in a number of locations in the southern suburbs of Dublin, then in Dublin and, from the mid-1860s, in Paris. Her formal education was erratic, being mainly in the hands of English governesses who equipped her with an ascendancy accent, but her upbringing allowed her more independence than was customary for young women at the time. At the age of eighteen she returned to Dublin, where she studied art at the Royal Dublin Academy of Art; in the spring of 1875 she moved to London to attend the Heatherley School of Art. Two of her paintings were accepted in exhibitions by the Royal Society of British Arts in 1874 and a third was displayed the following year.<br>
<br>During the mid- and late 1870s Anna Parnell followed the career of her older brother Charles closely, and was in the Ladies' Gallery of the House of Commons during his efforts to &#145;obstruct&#146; parliamentary business in 1877. Subsequently, in 1880, she published a three-part article describing the scenes. Her mother settled in 1874 in Bordentown, New Jersey, where, after the conclusion of the 1877 parliamentary session, Anna Parnell joined her. Her own political interest was sharpened by the agrarian crisis and Land League agitation in Ireland at the close of the 1870s. Her brother became president of the Irish National Land League in October 1879 and toured North America between January and early March 1880 to solicit funds. She helped to organize the Irish Land League Famine Relief Fund which was set up in New York. After March, when he began the United States Land League, she was soon immersed in its work as well. During this period she became acquainted with Michael Davitt, the founder of the Irish Land League. In late summer 1880 Anna Parnell returned to Ireland and she was the leading force in the Ladies' Land League when it was founded on 31 January 1881, serving as an honorary secretary. She addressed numerous Irish audiences on behalf of the movement, and sometimes faced considerable hostility. Both she and the Ladies' League became increasingly prominent during autumn 1881, especially following the suppression of the Land League in October. During the next few months, while her brother was in Kilmainham gaol, Anna Parnell emerged as a major figure in nationalist circles. Disliking aspects of Land League policy, she opposed Gladstone's <span class="roman">Land Act</span> of 1881 and viewed with disdain the &#145;Kilmainham treaty&#146; between the Liberal ministry and her brother. Soon after his release, in August 1882, Charles extinguished the Ladies' Land League. From this time Anna Parnell was utterly estranged from her brother and never spoke to him again.<br>
<br>By the mid-1880s Anna Parnell was living and painting in Cornwall. In 1885 she re-emerged in politics briefly when she attended a rally in London for the political activist Helen Taylor. During the O'Shea divorce crisis of 1890&#150;91 she was sympathetic to her brother's plight as co-respondent, but took no part in his last campaign. By the turn of the century she was living in straitened circumstances in north Devon. Though largely detached from politics, she sent the Irish nationalist Maud Gonne a contribution for the Patriotic Children's Treat organized as a protest against Queen Victoria's visit to Dublin in 1900. Publication of Michael Davitt's <span class="italic">The Fall of Feudalism in Ireland</span> in 1904 kindled her interest in Irish affairs once more. She was enraged by Davitt's treatment of the Ladies' Land League and sought to correct the record. During 1907 she set down her own counter-version of events entitled <span class="italic">The Tale of a Great Sham</span>, which, however, remained unpublished until 1986. At the beginning of 1908 she campaigned in Ireland on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in's first and unsuccessful parliamentary candidate in the North Leitrim by-election. This was her last public involvement. Anna Parnell, who was living under an assumed name, accidentally drowned at Ilfracombe, north Devon, on 20 September 1910 and was buried in Holy Trinity cemetery, Ilfracombe, on 23 September.<br>
