<span class="headword">Essex,  Margaret</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1775, <em>d.</em> in or after 1808), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was baptized on 30 July 1775 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, the youngest of three children of Timothy and Margaret Essex. A brother William was born in 1773. Her elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8888/', "Timothy Essex")</script> was also a composer. Very little evidence of Margaret's life survives, most of it from her printed music. Her publications date from between 1795 (when she was twenty) and 1807. On 2 January 1808 she married John Cambell at St George's, Hanover Square, London. Thereafter her publications ceased and her life remains untraced.<br>
<br>Margaret Essex's connection with Timothy is confirmed by information given on her musical editions, which were all published in London at her own expense by Robert Birchall. Her earliest song, &#145;Absence&#146;, has words by T. Essex and copyright assigned to him. Her address is given here and elsewhere as 2 Newman Street, Oxford Street, London, which matches Timothy's in Doane's <span class="italic">Musical Directory</span> for 1794. It is unclear whether this Timothy is her father or her brother. The date of 1765? given for Timothy's birth in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> is too late for the former but too early for the latter, whose Oxford degree dates from 1806. The fact that Margaret had a very thorough musical education indicates that her father was probably a musician. The publications of T. Essex, however, are undoubtedly those of her brother.<br>
<br>During her years as an active composer around the turn of the century, Margaret Essex was probably employed as a governess or music teacher. All her published compositions are suitable for domestic music-making (songs and chamber music), and at least one is pedagogical. She addressed all but one of her dedications to single women, no doubt the daughters of wealthy families who were her pupils. Her thirteen published compositions comprise ten songs with accompaniment for piano or harp, a set of three accompanied piano sonatas, and two works for solo piano. Her songs demonstrate a genuine melodic gift, subtle and graceful. In particular, her <span class="italic">Select Songs</span> (six songs published individually between 1802 and 1805) are carefully crafted for the skills of particular performers, presumably the dedicatees. &#145;Humid seal of soft affection&#146; (no. 3) is a fine example of her lyrical style.<br>
<br>Margaret Essex's output was small by professional standards but significant in that she was a woman who broke into the public sphere by publishing and copyrighting her works. In other respects she followed the strictures of contemporary society, writing music only for domestic performance, and retiring after her marriage.<br>
