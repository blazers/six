<span class="headword">Kentigern</span> <span class="st"> [St Kentigern, Mungo]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 612<span class="mult">x</span>14), <span class="occ">patron of the diocese (later archdiocese) of Glasgow</span>, was allegedly the son of St Thaney, a British princess from Lothian, and a British prince called Owain. The possibility that this parentage is largely, if not completely, fictional must be taken seriously, however. All that can be said with any confidence about Kentigern is that he was a contemporary of King Rhydderch of Strathclyde, who appears as a contemporary of St Columba (<i>d</i>. 597) in the life of Columba written by Adomn&aacute;n, <i>c</i>.697. Rhydderch may have established the see of his kingdom at Glasgow with Kentigern as its first bishop. It is possible, however, that Glasgow may have acquired this status only in the early twelfth century.<br>
<br>There is very little information for Kentigern's life that can be regarded as contemporary or impartial. The main surviving medieval account is a biography written by the accomplished hagiographer, Jocelin of Furness (probably <i>c</i>.1180). This work was intended to replace a life of the saint commissioned by Herbert, bishop of Glasgow from 1147 to 1164, of which only a fragment survives. Neither Jocelin of Furness nor the author of the earlier life, however, were primarily concerned to write a factual account of the saint's life as this would be understood today. Other hagiographical material is found in later works (notably the thirteenth-century Sprouston breviary and the Aberdeen breviary, published in 1510). The sources which these medieval accounts drew upon are a matter of scholarly discussion and conjecture, and it is doubtful whether any genuine information about the saint can now be convincingly identified. For instance, medieval accounts agree in making Kentigern receive his education at Culross under St Serf. St Serf, however, is likely to have flourished <i>c</i>.700, a century later than his supposed pupil.<br>
<br>It has been argued &#145;with some diffidence&#146; that the life of the saint written by Jocelin of Furness contains an account of Kentigern's death which includes enough circumstantial detail to enable a plausible reconstruction of what occurred  (McRoberts, 50). Not only are there elements in Jocelin's narrative of Kentigern's death which cramped his literary style, and which he presumably felt obliged to repeat because they were too well known, but there are liturgical aspects which would have become obsolete not long after Kentigern's day. According to this reconstruction, Kentigern's fatal illness struck him when he was performing the annual ceremony of baptism at the cathedral at the feast of the Epiphany. The saint was so decrepit that he had to wear a bandage round his head to support his lower jaw and prevent his mouth from hanging open. After delivering a homily from his ornate stone episcopal throne, he was assisted to the font. The water had been warmed to make the ceremony more tolerable in the midst of winter, and the aged bishop began to baptize the catechumens one by one. The effort was too much for him, however, and he collapsed, dying a week later, on 13 January. He was buried beside the altar of his cathedral.<br>
<br>There is uncertainty about the precise year in which Kentigern died. In <span class="italic">Annales Cambriae</span> it is recorded as nine years after the &#145;160th year&#146; after 444 but also two years before the &#145;170th year&#146;, which would suggest 612 or 613. To add to the confusion, however, <span class="italic">Annales Cambriae</span> placed the death of Aed&aacute;n mac Gabr&aacute;n, one of the most famous kings of D&aacute;l Riata, six years earlier than Kentigern's death. Aed&aacute;n probably died in 608, which would point to 614 as the actual date of Kentigern's death. It may be significant that Irish chronicles which share material with <span class="italic">Annales Cambriae</span> placed the obits of Aed&aacute;n and others two years too early, which could reinforce the suggestion that the notice of Kentigern's death in <span class="italic">Annales Cambriae</span> is as much as two years wide of the mark.<br>
<br>St Kentigern became the focus of a cult centred on Glasgow and was closely associated with the kingdom of Strathclyde. A cluster of dedications to the saint in Cumberland may reflect the recovery of this area by Strathclyde in the tenth century. His cult also spread as far as north Wales, and it has even been suggested that St Machar, patron of the diocese of Aberdeen, is merely St Kentigern in another guise. The existence of a Gaelic pet-form of his name, Mo Choe (or Mo Cha(tha)), besides the well-known Cumbric pet-form Munghu (Mungo), suggests that his cult became current among Gaelic speakers as well as the Britons of Strathclyde in the century after his death. He has remained as a powerful symbol of Glasgow's identity throughout the city's development as a medieval burgh and as a modern commercial centre and Mungo became a popular boy's name in Scotland.<br>
