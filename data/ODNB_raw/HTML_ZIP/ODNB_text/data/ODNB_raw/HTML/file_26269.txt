<span class="headword">Stanley,  Ferdinando</span>, fifth earl of Derby  (1559?&#150;1594), <span class="occ">literary patron</span>, was the eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26272/', "Henry Stanley, fourth earl of Derby (1531&#150;1593)")</script>, and his wife, Margaret (<i>c</i>.1540&#150;1596), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5648/', "Henry Clifford, second earl of Cumberland")</script>. In 1572, at the age of twelve, he matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, and in the same year he assumed the courtesy title Lord Strange upon his father's ascension to the earldom of Derby. After being summoned to court by Queen Elizabeth &#145;to be fashioned in good manners&#146;, he spent several of his teenage years as a squire in the royal household  (Bagley, 53).<br>
<br>In 1579 or 1580 Stanley married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47391/', "Alice Spencer (1559&#150;1637)")</script>, youngest daughter of Sir John Spencer of Althorp, Northamptonshire. The couple had three daughters: Anne [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65144/', "Brydges, Anne, Lady Chandos (1580&#150;1647)")</script>], who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3804/', "Grey Brydges, Baron Chandos")</script> (1608), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66794/', "Mervin Touchet, earl of Castlehaven")</script> (1624); Frances (1583&#150;1636), who married John Egerton, earl of Bridgewater; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40549/', "Elizabeth Hastings, n&#233;e Stanley (bap. 1587, d. 1633)")</script>, who married Henry Hastings, earl of Huntingdon. As his family grew, Stanley was being groomed to succeed his father as earl. In 1585 he served as mayor of Liverpool, and three years later he served temporarily as lord lieutenant of Lancashire and Cheshire at the time of the Spanish Armada. In 1589 he was called to the House of Lords, and on 17 September of that year he received an honorary MA from Oxford.<br>
<br>In addition to pursuing these serious duties Stanley was a noted lover of poetry and drama. From the late 1570s onwards he patronized a company of players, Strange's Men, and his tumblers performed at court several times in the 1580s. After the earl of Leicester's death in 1588, several of Leicester's players joined Strange's Men, who grew increasingly prominent. Late in 1589 they defied the lord mayor to play at Cross Keys, and by 1592 they were the leading company in England, often playing at court. William Shakespeare was probably a member about this time, and several of Shakespeare's future colleagues in the Lord Chamberlain's Men formed the core of the company.<br>
<br>In the early 1590s Stanley was also well known as a patron of poets. Books dedicated to him include Robert Greene's <span class="italic">Ciceronis amor</span> (1589); the second edition of <span class="italic">Of Prayer and Meditation</span> (1592), Richard Hopkins's translation of a work by Luis de Granada; Anthony Munday's translation, <span class="italic">The Defence of Contraries</span> (1593); and Matthew Gwinne's Latin elegy for the fourth earl of Derby (1593). He was praised in George Peele's <span class="italic">Polyhymnia</span> (1590), George Chapman's <span class="italic">Shadow of the Night</span> (1594), and (under the name &#145;Amyntas&#146;) Thomas Nashe's <span class="italic">Pierce Pennilesse</span> (1592). Edmund Spenser eulogized him as &#145;Amyntas&#146; in <span class="italic">Colin Clout's Come Home Again</span> (1595), writing that:<blockquote>
<div>He, whilst he lived, was the noblest swain<br>
</div>
<div>That ever piped on an oaten quill:<br>
</div>
<div>Both did he other, which could pipe, maintain,<br>
</div>
<div>And eke could pipe himself with passing skill.<br>
</div> (Heywood, 35)</blockquote>This suggestion that Stanley himself wrote poetry is confirmed by John Bodenham's <span class="italic">Belvedere</span> (1600), which lists him among its contributors. S. W. May has attributed four poems to him, three of them short but one containing 141 lines, which appear in printed and unprinted collections.<br>
<br>Upon his father's death on 25 September 1593 Ferdinando Stanley became the fifth earl of Derby. Almost immediately, Catholic plotters sent Richard Hesketh to try and persuade the new earl to claim the crown as the great-grandson of Mary Brandon, Henry VIII's younger sister, but Derby turned the plotters in, leading to Hesketh's execution. Less than seven months after becoming earl, Derby suddenly fell ill on the evening of 5 April 1594, and died eleven days later at Lathom House, Lancashire; he was buried on 6 May at Ormskirk. Stow describes his final illness in excruciating detail, reporting that the day before his death the earl melodramatically instructed his doctors to stop treatment, because &#145;I am resolved presentlie to die, and to take awaie with me onely one part of my armes, I meane the Eagles winges, so will I flie swiftly into the bosome of Christ my onely saviour&#146;  (Stow, 1277).<br>
<br>The earl's sudden, early, and violent death naturally aroused suspicion. He was praised posthumously in William Covell's <span class="italic">Polimanteia</span> (1595) and John Weever's <span class="italic">Epigrammes</span> (1599), the latter suggesting that he had been &#145;bewitcht&#146;  (Weever, 8). Stow gives a list of reasons why &#145;many learned men&#146; believed he had died of witchcraft, and it was also popularly supposed that he had been poisoned. No wrongdoing was ever proved, though, and in the absence of male children the earldom passed to Ferdinando's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72296/', "William Stanley")</script>. However, Ferdinando's widow, Alice, claimed the right to her husband's estates, leading to legal wrangling which was not resolved until fifteen years later. In 1600 she married Thomas Egerton, later Baron Ellesmere, the lord chancellor, and was a well-known patron of poets until her death in 1637.<br>
