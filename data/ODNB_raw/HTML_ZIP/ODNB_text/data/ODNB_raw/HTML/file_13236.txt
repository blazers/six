<span class="headword">Higginson,  Edward</span>  (1807&#150;1880), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister</span>, was born on 9 January 1807 in Heaton Norris, Lancashire, the third of six children and the eldest son of Edward Higginson (1781&#150;1832), Unitarian minister at Stockport, and his wife, Sarah (1782?&#150;1827), daughter of Joel Marshall, a Loughborough draper. In 1810 the elder Higginson became minister at Friar Gate Chapel, Derby, where he also kept a school, in which his children were educated; he encouraged his sons to learn woodworking, at which they became highly proficient.<br>
<br>Lacking the nerve to be a surgeon, as his father wanted, Higginson entered Manchester College, York, in September 1823. In 1828 he became minister to the small congregation at Bowl Alley Lane Chapel, Hull. The next year, because the stipend did not reach the promised level, he began a successful school. In 1837, when two new proprietary schools swept away his pupils, he turned to teaching girls, with the assistance of an unmarried sister, but returned to teaching boys when his competitors failed.<br>
<br>On 25 December 1839 Higginson married Lydia (1813/14&#150;1856), the youngest daughter of Flower Humble, from a Newcastle mercantile family, and the adopted daughter of the banker Samuel Shore of Meersbrook (1737/8&#150;1828), to whose wife she was collaterally related; they had a son and a daughter. In 1845, suffering from overwork and, possibly, depression, he resigned the Hull pulpit and the next year accepted an invitation from Westgate Chapel, Wakefield, where, despite a modest increase in income from his wife, he also kept a school, in time extended to girls. He delighted in the congregation and in the company of other West Riding ministers, a change from the isolation of Hull.<br>
<br>Lydia Higginson died on 8 February 1856, aged forty-two, and on 5 July 1857 Edward married Emily Thomas (1826&#150;1895); the daughter of George Thomas, a Carmarthen solicitor, she had been teaching at a girls' school in Wakefield. This marriage too produced a son and a daughter. The next year he accepted an invitation to High Street Chapel, Swansea. Besides conducting a school, he was visitor and examiner at the Presbyterian college, Carmarthen, where he also lectured on English grammar and literature and on political economy. In 1875 he reluctantly accepted the presidency of the college, but, suffering from ill health, resigned both presidency and pulpit in 1876.<br>
<br>As a teacher Higginson was clearly ahead of his time, to judge from his call, in an essay published in <span class="italic">The Educator: Prize Essays</span> in 1839, for openness and friendliness rather than reliance on authority in the classroom, from his reservations about corporal punishment, and from the transparent pleasure he took in opening a wider world to his Welsh-speaking students at Carmarthen. He regarded teaching as a distraction from his ministerial role, though, like most of his generation, he lacked the &#145;popular&#146; style increasingly taken as the guarantee of ministerial success. While noting that he &#145;discoursed more than he sermonized, reasoned more than he exhorted&#146;, a Wakefield correspondent in <span class="italic">Christian Life</span> (21 February 1880) also recalled his common sense, restrained eloquence, and deep religious feeling.<br>
<br>Higginson's strongest instinct was scholarly, though he claimed no originality: one obituarist wrote that &#145;he could form no conception of the perfect Christian scholar that did not define itself into the image of Mr. Wellbeloved and Mr. Kenrick&#146;, the most distinguished of his teachers at York  (<span class="italic">Christian Life</span>, 21 Feb 1880). He was well-read, and his publications ranged from the usual Unitarian defences against Anglican and orthodox attacks to a distinctly Unitarian contribution  (<span class="italic">Astro-Theology</span>, 1854) to the debate on the plurality of worlds launched by the confrontation of William Whewell (1794&#150;1866) and Sir David Brewster (1781&#150;1868). He wrote frequently for the <span class="italic">Christian Reformer</span> until its cessation in 1863, and from 1876 to his death contributed regularly to <span class="italic">Christian Life</span>. His principal concern was to reassert historically and biblically based Unitarianism against the religious intuitionism of James Martineau (1805&#150;1900) and John James Tayler (1797&#150;1869); ironically, one of his sisters married Martineau, while another married Martineau's redoubtable opponent Samuel Bache (1804&#150;1876). Of his many books, only the two volumes of <span class="italic">The Spirit of the Bible</span> (1853&#150;5) brought a modest return. <span class="italic">Ecce Messias</span> (1874) was an extended effort to trace biblical testimony to the messianic hope, which John Locke had seen as the central feature of Christianity. Its failure with the public, after which Higginson gave up writing books, suggests the end of an era in the history of Unitarian intellect. Higginson died at 2 Glanmor Terrace, Swansea, on 12 February 1880 of heart disease, and was buried in the town's Dan-y-graig cemetery on 17 February.<br>
