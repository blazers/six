<span class="headword">McVail,  John Christie</span>  (1849&#150;1926), <span class="occ">physician and public health administrator</span>, was born in Kilmarnock on 22 October 1849, the second son of James McVail and his wife, Jean Christie. After an early education in Kilmarnock he studied medicine at Glasgow and St Andrews, where he graduated MB, CM, with high honours in 1873. Two years later he graduated MD and entered private practice in Kilmarnock, encouraged by John Borland, the town's leading medical figure.<br>
<br>McVail developed an early interest in vital statistics and public health. In 1885 he took the Cambridge diploma in public health and succeeded Borland as medical officer of health for Kilmarnock and as physician to the Kilmarnock Infirmary. McVail combined these offices with private practice until 1891, when he left Kilmarnock to become the first full-time medical officer of health for the joint counties of Stirling and Dumbarton, formed under the <span class="roman">Local Government Act (Scotland)</span> 1889. This post gave him a basis for his pioneering work in Scottish public health.<br>
<br>A large man with large ideas which he vigorously expressed in speech and writings, McVail had already published work on smallpox and vaccination. He appeared before the royal commission on vaccination (1892&#150;3) as an expert on the disease and in 1907 the BMA awarded him the Jenner medal. From 1887 to 1889, and again in 1905, he was president of the Sanitary Association of Scotland. In 1909 he produced a special report on the housing of miners for the Scottish Local Government Board. He also became the expert witness in the sometimes fraught boundary disputes dealt with by the Scottish burgh and county health administration. In 1907 he was appointed medical examiner for the royal commission on poor laws, and, unusually, he reported on the poor-law system covering England and Wales. McVail had a firm commitment to the voluntary principle in general and to workers' insurance schemes in particular: he acted as medical adviser to the Kilmarnock Foresters friendly society.<br>
<br>When the National Health Insurance scheme came into operation in 1912, McVail was appointed deputy chairman of the National Health Insurance Commission for Scotland. In 1919 the board of health for Scotland replaced the insurance commission and the Local Government Board, and McVail and his long-term colleague Leslie Mackenzie became the new board's medical members. Both men were members of the Dewar committee of 1912, whose recommendations formed the basis of the Highlands and Islands Medical Service, instituted in 1913, and both served on its board. During the First World War, McVail gave great service on the emergency committee.<br>
<br>Early in his career McVail was a frequent contributor to the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span>. He was an active member of the British Medical Association, becoming president of the Glasgow and west of Scotland branch in 1905. He was a member of the constitution committee which drafted the association's new constitution in 1901, and later he wrote a historical sketch in the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> of the steps leading to the changed constitution. McVail presided over the state medicine and medical sociology sections of various BMA congresses. In 1922 he received the Alexander Patrick Stewart prize for research into the origin, spread, and prevention of epidemic disease, at the association's Glasgow meeting. Although involved in the practical application of public health administration, McVail also kept in touch with the academic teaching of his subject. For many years he was external examiner in public health and forensic medicine for all four Scottish universities. In 1908 the University of Glasgow conferred on him the honorary degree of LLD. In 1912 he was appointed crown nominee for Scotland on the General Medical Council, succeeding his elder brother, Sir David McVail, in the post.<br>
<br>McVail married Jessie Schoolbred, daughter of John Rowat, on 17 June 1877. They had two sons and two daughters, of whom a son and a daughter followed their father into the medical profession. McVail was a friend of John Glaister, professor of public health and forensic medicine at Glasgow, and their families were united when McVail's eldest son, Dr John Borland McVail, married one of Glaister's daughters. McVail was a staunch Liberal and a member of the Evangelical Union Congregational church.<br>
<br>Ill health forced McVail to retire from public service in 1922. He lived in Golders Green, Middlesex, for some time afterwards, but later moved to Netherway, Falkland Road, Torquay, where he died on 29 July 1926. He was an acknowledged giant in Scottish public health, and many expressed surprise at the lack of recognition of his services.<br>
