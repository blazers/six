<span class="headword">Whateley <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Darwall]</span>,  Mary</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1738, <em>d.</em> 1825), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on her father's farm in Beoley, Worcestershire, the last of nine children of William Whateley (<i>bap</i>. 1694, <i>d</i>. 1763), gentleman farmer, from Beoley, and his wife, Mary Beach (<i>b</i>. 1695), who was from Tanworth. She was baptized at Beoley on 9 February 1738. The Whateleys were well known and influential in Beoley, where John Whateley, Mary's grandfather, had been churchwarden at the parish church of St Leonard's.<br>
<br>Mary Whateley first came to minor prominence by publishing a few poems under the pseudonym of Harriott Airy in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> in 1759. One of these she addressed to Mr Copywell, pseudonym of the writer William Woty, who replied in that same magazine. In 1761 William Shenstone, the pastoral poet and landscape gardener, told Thomas Percy, collector of ballads, and his friend Richard Graves, that he had received Mary Whateley's collection of manuscripts of her own poetry, which he edited as well as praised  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 588&#150;9). Shenstone described Mary Whateley as:<blockquote>neither handsome, nor, I believe, in affluent circumstances; has seen mighty little of the world. On the other hand, she is young, unaffected, and unassuming; and that she has generous and delicate sentiments, as well as ingenuity, may, I think, be fairly concluded from the whole tenor of her Poetry. (ibid., 158)</blockquote>His doctor, John Wall, wrote a brief account of her in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1761), presumably in order to attract a readership for her poetry by demonstrating that she had the little education of &#145;the meanest of menial servants&#146;. But in 1762, in an attempt to correct the impression he had created of Mary Whateley's servitude, he amended this biography and described her education as &#145;such as is usually given to the daughter [of] a substantial farmer [who] occupied his own estate&#146;. Mary Whateley was taught<blockquote>reading, writing, and needlework, comprehending most of what is thought necessary. But her genius is not to be confined to such slender limits. She had a great love for literature, and applied herself with great assiduity to the reading of the best authors. (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1762)</blockquote>In 1760 Mary Whateley left Beoley in order to keep house for her brother, an attorney in Walsall, Staffordshire (although, at the death of her father, she returned to Beoley for about three years, in 1763). She published her first volume of poetry, <span class="italic">Original Poems on Several Occasions</span>, by subscription in 1764. John Langhorne, who wrote the preface to this volume, also praised it in the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> (1764, 445&#150;50). On 4 November 1766 she married a widower, the Revd John Darwall (1732&#150;1789) of Walsall, who had six children from his first marriage. John Darwall wrote music for hymns, as well as poetry and sermons, some of which he published on his own printing press: <span class="italic">A Visitation Sermon</span> (1775) and <span class="italic">Political Lamentations</span> (1777). Mary Darwall subsequently had six children of her own: Leicester Yonge (<i>b</i>. 1767), Whateley (<i>b</i>. 1768), Charles Henry (<i>b</i>. 1769), Harriet (<i>b</i>. 1771), Frederick (<i>b</i>. 1773), and Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1776). She wrote hymns for her husband's congregation in Walsall as well as epilogues and a play for local theatre. John Darwall died in December 1789 and Mary Darwall then lived for a time in Deritend, near Birmingham, with her stepson John. In 1793 she moved to Newtown, Montgomeryshire, and published by subscription her second work, <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> (2 vols., 1794), which included pastoral and elegiac poems mainly in quatrains with an occasional sonnet. In one of these poems, &#145;Lines, Occasioned by Seeing a Beautiful Print of the River Clyde&#146;  (Whateley, <span class="italic">Poems</span>, 1.14&#150;18), Mary Darwall allied herself with the work of Robert Burns and Helen Maria Williams:<blockquote>
<div>Can'st thou the glen, or pine-topp'd hill<br>
</div>
<div>Like Burns, with strains ecstatic fill?<br>
</div>
<div>Or dare to touch thy humble wire,<br>
</div>
<div>Where beauteous Helen's sweet-ton'd lyre<br>
</div>
<div>Breathes harmony in every gale &hellip;<br>
</div>
</blockquote>The second volume printed fourteen sonnets by her two daughters. One of these daughters, Harriet Darwall, also published her own work, <span class="italic">The Storm and other Poems</span> (1810).<br>
<br>Mary Darwall died in Walsall on 5 December 1825. In 1924 and again in 1979 the Gregynog Press, Newtown, reprinted from her <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> her landscape poem, &#145;Written on Walking in the Woods of Gregynog in Montgomeryshire, the Seat of Arthur Blayney, esq.&#146;, dated 1 July 1794, as a limited edition broadsheet. Mary Whateley's poetry has since received attention because of an increase of critical interest in the history of women's poetry generally. In 1989 a few of her poems were reprinted by Roger Lonsdale in <span class="italic">Eighteenth-Century Women Poets: an Oxford Anthology</span>.<br>
