<span class="headword">Channon, Sir  Henry <span class="st"> [Chips]</span></span>  (1897&#150;1958), <span class="occ">politician and diarist</span>, was born in Chicago on 7 March 1897 (although he claimed 1899 as the year of his birth, until a distressing exposure in the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span>). He was the only child of Henry Channon (1868&#150;1930&times;39), who inherited a fleet of vessels plying the Great Lakes, and his wife, Vesta Westover (<i>c</i>.1870&#150;1943). After accompanying the American Red Cross to Paris (1917), he was subsequently an honorary attach&eacute; at the US embassy there (1918). His lifelong Proustian infatuation with the aristocratic civilization of Europe was enhanced during eighteen happy months as an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford (January 1920&#150;June 1921). He acquired the nickname of Chips, which afterwards was his London telegraphic address. On leaving university he shared a house in Westminster with Viscount Gage and Prince Paul of Serbia. When the prince became regent of Yugoslavia (1934), Channon described him as &#145;the person I have loved most &hellip; the only human being with whom I am completely, wholly natural&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chips</span>, ed. James, 20). Adoring London society, privilege, rank, and wealth, he became an energetic, implacable, but endearing social climber who pursued the Curzons of Kedleston as part of his self-reinvention as an upper-class European. But away from the smart drawing-rooms of Mayfair and Belgravia he was often less comfortable. He seemed spurious to many of those on whose acceptance his happiness depended. To Lady Gladwyn he was &#145;that American pipsqueak (alas naturalized British)&#146; and a &#145;twerp&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries of Cynthia Gladwyn</span>, 26, 40). James Lees-Milne thought him &#145;a flibbertigibbet&#146;  (Lees-Milne, <span class="italic">Ancestral Voices</span>, 204) and Duff Cooper &#145;a toady&#146;  (Charmley, 79).<br>
<br>The prosaic populism of American culture was the object of Channon's revulsion in two books. The heroine of his novel <span class="italic">Joan Kennedy</span> (1929) is an Englishwoman whose marriage to a rich, boisterous American is spoiled when he takes her to his harsh, crude homeland. In <span class="italic">Paradise City</span> (1930) Channon traced the ruin by industrial capitalism of a calm, contented town based on early Chicago, and the effects on characters including an aesthete who dies in Venice and a beauty who marries into the English peerage. His final book, <span class="italic">The Ludwigs of Bavaria</span> (1933), was a romantic biography of the royal dynasty of Wittelsbach: &#145;their charm, their dark nervous beauty, their cruel fates, their passion for the arts, their follies and madness make them one of the most fascinating families in history&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Ludwigs of Bavaria</span>, 11&#150;12).<br>
<br>Channon is chiefly remembered, however, for his diaries which survive for the years 1918, 1923&#150;8, and 1934&#150;53. Discreetly edited extracts compiled by Robert Rhodes James and published in 1967 open with Lady Diana Cooper's announcing the death of King Albert I of the Belgians (12 February 1934) and close with Channon's cocktail party for King Umberto II of Italy (18 November 1953). The intervening entries are by turns scintillating, epicene, snobbish, fatuous, self-mocking, and clich&eacute;-ridden. There are captivating descriptions of great parliamentary occasions as well as intriguing confidences about backstairs intrigues; but each page demonstrates Channon's preference for manners over principles. &#145;Everybody is on about Chips's diary&#151;you can't think how vile &amp; spiteful &amp; <i>silly</i> it is,&#146; Nancy Mitford wrote after its publication. &#145;One always thought Chips was rather a dear, but he was <i>black</i> inside how sinister!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Love from Nancy</span>, 465).<br>
<br>Channon's American patrimony was insufficient for the life he craved. He married on 14 July 1933 a glamorous heiress, Lady Honor Dorothy Mary Guinness (1909&#150;1976), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33604/', "Rupert Edward Cecil Lee Guinness, second earl of Iveagh")</script>, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33602/', "Gwendolen Florence Mary Guinness")</script>. He proudly doted on their only child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/97546/', "(Henry) Paul Guinness Channon (1935&#150;2007)")</script>, who was created Baron Kelvedon in 1997. The Channons acquired a sumptuous house at 5 Belgrave Square (1935) and an estate at Kelvedon Hatch, near Brentwood in Essex (1937). Hospitality at these homes was as effervescent and lavish as their interiors were ornate. The newly married Chips was a thoughtful, shrewd, witty, and worldly gossip who loved to help people. His social radiance could be entrancing; he was resolute in promoting the interests of his friends. The earl of Drogheda found him &#145;an immensely kind man, with many acts of generosity to his credit&#146;  (Drogheda, 59&#150;60): when Viscountess Castlerosse sat on a wasp, Chips sucked the sting out of her buttock. Channon wrote of himself in 1935:<blockquote>I have flair, intuition, great good taste but only second rate ambition: I am far too susceptible to flattery; I hate and am uninterested in all the things most men like such as sport, business, statistics, debates, speeches, war and the weather; but I am rivetted by lust, furniture, glamour and society and jewels. (<span class="italic">Chips</span>, ed. James, 38)</blockquote>Channon replaced his mother-in-law as Conservative MP for Southend-on-Sea in 1935 and remained in parliament until his death (after a division of the constituency, he represented Southend-on-Sea West from 1950). He in turn was succeeded by his son, Paul, who won the constituency in the by-election after his father's death, and held it until 1997 (when he was elevated to the House of Lords as Baron Kelvedon). At constituency work Channon was diligent. In political ideas he had no interest; only personal loyalties and emotions moved him. The masculinity of the House of Commons gratified him, but he was too dapper and ingratiating for many men. &#145;Channon, who has the Servants' Hall mentality&#146;, Hugh Dalton sneered in 1941, &#145;would make a good butler to minor royalty&#146;  (<span class="italic">War Diary</span>, 179). He detested with a convert's ferocity individuals who betrayed or organizations which threatened the aristocratic ambience which he adulated. Always ferociously anti-communist, he was an early dupe of the Nazis because his attractive German princelings hoped that Hitler might be preparing for a Hohenzollern restoration; later he became a devoted, nervous supporter of appeasement. The political hero of his life was therefore the arch-appeaser Neville Chamberlain, with whom he &#145;fell in love&#146; on the day that Hitler took Vienna  (<span class="italic">Chips</span>, ed. James, 150). Robert Byron said at the time of Chamberlain's Munich accord, &#145;the trouble with you, Chips, is that you put your adopted class before your adopted country&#146;  (Lees-Milne, <span class="italic">Ancestral Voices</span>, 161). R. A. Butler, in explanation of his appointment of Channon as his parliamentary private secretary when under-secretary at the Foreign Office (March 1938&#150;July 1941), declared that he needed to attach a first-class restaurant car to his train.<br>
<br>At a dinner given by Lady Cunard in July 1939 Channon met Peter Daniel Coats (1910&#150;1990), nicknamed Petticoats, &#145;a classic English queen&#146;  (Vidal, 195). Although this intimacy led to Channon's separation from his wife in 1940 and the dissolution of their marriage in 1945, he continued to live magnificently on money the Guinnesses had bestowed. He dazzled the playwright Terence Rattigan with splendid gifts in 1944 during a light-hearted affair, but it was a symptom of the self-doubt that increasingly afflicted him after the war that he betrayed possessive distress as the affair petered out in 1948&#150;9. Rattigan thought him &#145;an iron butterfly&#146;. He became a cruder debauchee: &#145;Chips fell upon me, round rosy face flushed with drink, like an antique depraved schoolboy&#146;, Gore Vidal recalls of their first meeting in 1948  (Vidal, 195). The artificiality of his life became over-strained&#151;No&euml;l Coward found his dinner for King George II of the Hellenes in 1946 &#145;very grand and rather agony&#146;  (<span class="italic">Coward Diaries</span>, 50&#150;51)&#151;and party-giving may have staled even for the self-styled lord of hosts himself: entertaining the queens of Romania and Spain in 1947, he &#145;laced the cocktails with Benzedrine, which I find always makes a party go&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chips</span>, ed. James, 419). His friendship with the duchess of Windsor had discredited him at the royal court after 1936; he lost hope of political importance after 1941; declining sexual powers, portliness, and heart attacks further dismayed him after 1950. He became an increasingly poignant, fantastic figure: bibelots, scandal-mongering, voluptuous living, and queens for dinner were not enough to revive his spirits. After the glorious coronation summer of 1953 he abandoned his diary.<br>
<br>Channon's persistent intrigues for a coronet resulted in a knighthood in 1957. He died after several strokes, on 7 October 1958, in the London Hospital, Whitechapel, and was buried on 14 October in his grounds at Kelvedon Hall. Elliot Templeton in Somerset Maugham's novel <span class="italic">The Razor's Edge</span> (1944) and the disappointed schoolmaster Croker-Harris in Rattigan's play <span class="italic">The Browning Version</span> (1948) were partly inspired by Channon.<br>
