<span class="headword">Mason,  William Charles Monck</span>  (1775&#150;1859), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born in Dublin on 7 September 1775, the eldest son of Henry Monck Mason, colonel of engineers. His mother, Jane, Henry Mason's second wife, was a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19405/', "Dr Bartholomew Mosse (1712&#150;1759)")</script>, founder of the Dublin Lying-in Hospital. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18275/', "Henry Joseph Monck Mason")</script>, writer, was William's brother. He was an uncle of George Henry Monck Mason (1825&#150;1857). Mason's father held an office in the household of the lord lieutenant as well as the post of &#145;land waiter for exports&#146; in the revenue department at Dublin. When Mason was twenty-one, in 1796, he succeeded to the land-waitership. Throughout his life Mason worked on the history and topography of Ireland; he collected rare books and manuscripts, and transcribed many documents. His ambition was to produce a topographical account of Ireland similar to Samuel and Daniel Lysons's <span class="italic">Magna Britannia</span> (1806&#150;22) and George Chalmers's <span class="italic">Caledonia</span> (1807&#150;24). The intended title was &#145;Hibernia antiqua et hodierna: being a topographical account of Ireland, and a history of all the establishments in that kingdom, ecclesiastical, civil, and monastick, drawn chiefly from sources of original record&#146;. The first part, published in 1819, was devoted to the history of St Patrick's Cathedral. More than one third of the book was taken up by a biography of Jonathan Swift. It remains an important source for the history of Dublin. Mason hoped to publish a companion volume on Christ Church, Dublin, but although engravings were prepared under his direction, the work was not printed.<br>
<br>In 1823 Mason issued a prospectus for a history of the city and county of Dublin, hoping to revise the work of historians such as Walter Harris, but subscriptions were not forthcoming. The plan was abandoned, and Mason's manuscript collections for it remained unrevised and unsorted. His excerpts from Dublin municipal archives were superseded by J. T. Gilbert's publication of the calendars of the ancient records of Dublin.<br>
<br>About 1826 Mason left Ireland for the continent, having been granted a government pension on the abolition of his office in the revenue department at Dublin. During his travels and residence abroad he collected many valuable works on continental literature and the fine arts; these were auctioned in London in 1834&#150;7. Mason moved to England in 1848, and devoted himself mainly to the study of philology. Once again he formed a very large library, which he sold at auction at Sothebys in 1852. Also at Sothebys in 1858 he sold by auction his literary collections and compositions relating to Irish history and philology. <br>
<br>Mason was married, but the name of his wife is not known. He died at Surbiton Hall in Kingston upon Thames, where he had been living, on 6 March 1859.<br>
