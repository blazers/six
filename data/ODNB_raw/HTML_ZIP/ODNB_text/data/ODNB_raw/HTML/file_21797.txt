<span class="headword">Pelham,  Thomas</span>, first Baron Pelham  (<em>c.</em>1653&#150;1712), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Halland Place, Laughton, Sussex, the eldest son of Sir John Pelham, third baronet (<i>c</i>.1623&#150;1703), politician, and his wife, Lady Lucy (<i>d</i>. 1685), second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25525/', "Robert Sidney, second earl of Leicester")</script>. He was educated at Tonbridge grammar school (1663&#150;5) and by 1670 had entered Christ Church, Oxford, where he was one of the pupils of George Hooper, later bishop of Bath and Wells.<br>
<br>Pelham was returned to parliament for East Grinstead, Sussex, on 25 October 1678, and retained the seat until August 1679. In the election of October 1679 he was returned for Lewes&#151;6 miles from Laughton&#151;and continued to represent Lewes until July 1702, when, having been returned for Lewes and Sussex, he chose to sit for Sussex. In politics Pelham followed the family line and was a moderate whig. In 1679 the earl of Shaftesbury twice described him as &#145;worthy&#146;, although he made little mark on the parliaments of 1679&#150;81 and abstained from voting on the first bill to exclude the duke of York from the throne. On 21 March 1680 Pelham married Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1664&#150;1681), daughter of the whig politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15103/', "Sir William Jones")</script> of Ramsbury, Wiltshire. Jones was said to have encouraged Pelham to remain a firm whig. The marriage licence of 26 November 1679 described Pelham as about twenty-six and Elizabeth as about fifteen. They had two daughters, one of whom was Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1711), who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27617/', "Charles Townshend, second Viscount Townshend")</script>. Elizabeth was buried at Laughton on 13 October 1681 and Pelham married, by a licence of 21 May 1686, Lady Grace (1668/9&#150;1700), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13553/', "Gilbert Holles, third earl of Clare")</script>. They had two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21801/', "Thomas Pelham Holles, duke of Newcastle upon Tyne and Newcastle under Lyme")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21789/', "Henry Pelham")</script>, and six daughters. Pelham's whiggish inclinations were presumably the reason he, along with his father and uncle, was dismissed as a JP for Sussex in 1687, following James II's remodelling of the commission of the peace.<br>
<br>After the revolution Pelham was appointed a commissioner of customs, from 20 April 1689 to 24 March 1691. He was also reappointed as a JP and was three times a lord commissioner of the Treasury (March 1690&#150;March 1692; May 1697&#150;June 1699; and March 1701&#150;May 1702). Despite his periods in office, throughout the 1690s Pelham was a &#145;country&#146; whig. He signed the Association promising to defend William III's life promptly in 1696 but he often took an independent line from the government, including opposing the impeachment of the Jacobite conspirator Sir John Fenwick in 1696 and the standing army in 1698.<br>
<br>After the accession of Anne in 1702, Pelham was once again out of office and remained true to his country whig principles. In 1704 he co-operated with secretary of state <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12344/', "Robert Harley")</script> in opposing the &#145;tack&#146;, an attempt by high tories to tack a bill against occasional conformity to a supply bill. He was appointed vice-admiral of the coast of Sussex on 21 May 1705. Having succeeded his father as fourth baronet in January 1703, in 1705 Pelham made his desire for a peerage known to the queen through his brother-in-law the duke of Newcastle and Robert Harley. He had to wait over a year but on 16 December 1706 he was created Baron Pelham of Laughton, and took his place in the House of Lords on 30 December. He died of apoplexy at Halland Place, Sussex, on 23 February 1712 and was buried in the chancel of Laughton parish church on 8 March. His friend the third earl of Shaftesbury remembered him as one of the &#145;honestest of men and most true to the interests of the public&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, ed. Rand, 487).<br>
