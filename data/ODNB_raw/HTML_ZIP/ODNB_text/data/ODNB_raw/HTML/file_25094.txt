<span class="headword">Seres,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1578<span class="mult">x</span>80), <span class="occ">printer and bookseller</span>, was possibly of alien origin, as he was listed as a &#145;stranger&#146; in the parish of St Gregory in lay subsidies of 1564 and 1577 for the Castle Baynard ward in London. There is some confusion over the pronunciation of his name on account of the several forms in which it appears across extant records. It is often pronounced as one syllable, but as his patron William Cecil always spelt it Seress it is likely that it was pronounced with two syllables, like the name of the harvest goddess&#151;as indicated by the common variant spelling of his name Ceres. This is suggested also by the unusual spelling Searese, found in lay subsidies for 1577. The earliest books known to be published by Seres date to 1548, when he was in partnership with Anthony Scoloker (with whom he produced a number of reformist texts, including John Bale's <span class="italic">A Brefe Chronycle</span>) and also with John Day. His first imprint places him as a resident in Ely Rents in Holborn. Seres collaborated with Day on many works, among them Tyndale's <span class="roman">New Testament</span> (1548), Edmund Becke's <span class="roman">Bible</span> (1549), and Sir John Cheke's <span class="italic">Hurt of Sedicion</span> (1549). In 1548 Day's and Seres's joint production of Luke Shepherd's poem <span class="italic">John Bon and Mast Person</span> was said to have offended the Catholic aldermen of the city of London, and Day, if not Seres himself, appears to have been threatened with imprisonment. Seres also published some works with William Hill. He seems rarely to have worked alone and had many assigns, such as John Case, Nicholas Hill, William Powell, William Harford, William Copland, and Henry Denham.<br>
<br>Seres was made free of the city of London as a member of the Stationers' Company by redemption on 18 September 1548. As he is known to have been Cecil's servant by late 1548, Seres's freedom may have been due to Cecil's influence. In February, Cecil and one of his Lincolnshire neighbours, Lawrence Eresby, had sought to acquire the premises of a former chantry in London, but in order for the sale to go through someone had to take possession of the property. This was done by Seres and Cecil's clerk, Roger Alford, in November. The building in question was known as Peter College, part of which was to become Stationers' Hall in 1554. Seres himself also took possession of part of the property, and for the next two years imprints describe him as dwelling at Peter College. The lay subsidies for 1549 list him as a resident in the parish, and a lease for the property was granted formally to him on Lady day 1549. Seres had evidently been married for some time, as this lease stated that he could not sell any part of the college to his wife or children, but that he could at any time purchase the fee simple during the next decade. By 1551 his premises were described in imprints as The Hedgehog. A 25-year lease was granted to him in 1556.<br>
<br>On 11 March 1553 Cecil procured for Seres the patent to print all primers and psalters. However, on the accession of Mary a few months later the patent was revoked and, at some point during the reign, Seres was imprisoned. When in 1553, the duke of Northumberland's plots threatened to put Cecil himself in danger, the latter transferred some of his goods to Seres's household for safe keeping. Seres performed many further duties for Cecil during the rest of Mary's reign, principally that of rent collecting. During these years Roger Alford (Seres's earlier co-tenant) collected rents in Lincolnshire, where John Day (Seres's former printing partner) was housed on Cecil's land. Seres may have been aware of his former partner's surreptitious press there, and both men returned to London at approximately the same time in 1556 (Cecil paid Seres his discharge of &pound;40 there on 29 September 1556, shortly after Day's return from Lincolnshire in July). Both Seres and Day worked as assigns for John Wayland (the printer of Marian primers), although it is not known how early this began: Seres is named as an assign for Wayland in 1559, but the erstwhile partners, having both been assisted by Cecil, probably returned to publishing at the same time upon their return to London.<br>
<br>Following the accession of Elizabeth, Seres was granted on 3 July 1559 an enhanced privilege for life to print psalters and primers in both Latin and English, and on 2 October he brought a suit against Day for issuing &#145;a quartron of psalmes with notes &hellip; without lycense and contrary to the orders&#146;  (Arber, <span class="italic">Regs. Stationers</span>, 1.124). Day was fined 12<i>s</i>. but received his own lucrative patent to print metrical psalms forty days later. In May 1560 the high commission ordered the Stationers' Company to punish anyone who infringed Seres's privilege, a sign of both the value of the privileges and Seres's own importance. In 1571 he received a further privilege for &#145;all manner of booke and bookes of private prayers primers psalters and psalmes bothe in greate volumes and small in Englishe or latine&#146; for the lifetimes of both himself and his son William  (Blayney, 25). However, the wide terms of this patent proved controversial. On 20 October 1578, in an attempt &#145;to avoid all contentions &hellip; and to thintente that a perfecte amitie and frindship &hellip; maie be had and contynued&#146;  (London, Stationers' Hall, Liber A, fol. 36), the company drew up an agreement between the two Sereses and a number of other members of the company (including John and Richard Day), clarifying precisely which rights belonged to which individuals. By this point, however, Seres the elder had already assigned his privilege to Henry Denham for an annual fee. Among Seres's publications after 1558 were translations by Arthur Golding&#151;<span class="italic">The Eyght Bookes of Caius Julius Caesar Conteyning his Martiall Exploytes in Gallia</span> (1565) and <span class="italic">The .xv. Bookes of P. Ovidus Naso, Entytuled Metamorphosis</span> (1567)&#151;as well as Thomas Blundeville's <span class="italic">The Fower Chiefyst Offices Belongyng to Horsemanshippe</span> (1565&#150;6) and Sir Geoffrey Fenton's <span class="italic">Monophylo</span> (1572).<br>
<br>Seres took an active role in the life of the Stationers' Company. Listed twenty-first in the company's charter of incorporation in 1557, and already a relatively senior member, he served as master no fewer than five times between 1570 and 1578. He died at some point between 9 December 1578, when he signed a company petition, and 18 January 1580, when he was noted as deceased by the company's governing body. The administration of his estate was granted to his widow, named as Agniti Seres, on 9 July 1580. After Seres's death, Denham and William Seres the younger signed a document whereby they handed John and Richard Day the sole rights for the printing of psalms; however, it was followed by a protracted dispute between Seres's widow and Denham. In 1582 Seres the younger petitioned Cecil for his assistance in protecting the 1571 patent against the infringements of John Wolfe and others: &#145;W<sup>ch</sup> priviledge &hellip; by the further helpe &amp; goodnes of your honor was &hellip; graunted to hym [Seres the elder] &amp; to me&#146;  (Blayney, 26). Seres the younger (who was elected to the livery of the Stationers' Company in 1578) carried on his father's business until 1603 but assigned much of the work to others. The Seres patent was incorporated into the Stationers' Company's joint-stock venture, the English stock, in 1603.<br>
