<span class="headword">Broad,  Charlie Dunbar</span>  (1887&#150;1971), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was born at Harlesden, Middlesex, on 30 December 1887, the only child of Charles Stephen Broad, wine merchant, of an old family of Bristol builders, and his wife, Emily Gomme. Broad was brought up in quietly comfortable circumstances and in an environment of elderly relatives of varying degrees of eccentricity; he was relieved from the need to work by a modest family trust. He was at Dulwich College from 1900 to 1906 when A. H. Gilkes was headmaster. Having moved from the &#145;engineering side&#146; to the &#145;science side&#146; of the school, he won a science scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, and went up there in 1906. At that time, he says of himself, he adhered to a &#145;smug and thin rationalism&#146; under the influence of the writings of H. G. Wells and other advanced thinkers of the age. An interest in philosophy had been awoken at school by reading Schopenhauer. In 1908 he got a first in part one of the natural sciences tripos, but, doubting his chances of doing first-class work in science, turned to philosophy.<br>
<br>That decision was justified in 1910 by Broad's achievement of first-class honours, with special distinction in &#145;moral science&#146;. His main teachers were J. M. E. McTaggart and the logician W. E. Johnson. He also had some contact with Bertrand Russell, the philosopher to whom technically he was closest, sharing Russell's conviction that science is very substantially inconsistent with common sense and more worthy of belief than common sense, and with G. E. Moore. It was the early and largely shared doctrines of these two major philosophers that he was to elaborate and to defend, despite Laodicean protestations, throughout his career.<br>
<br>In 1911 Broad was elected a fellow of Trinity on the basis of a dissertation that was published in an improved form in 1914 as <span class="italic">Perception, Physics, and Reality</span>. From 1911 to 1920 he was at the University of St Andrews, first as assistant to G. F. Stout, then as lecturer at the Dundee part of the university. During the war he gave some time to work at a neighbouring munitions factory. In 1920 he succeeded C. Lloyd Morgan as professor at Bristol, and he returned to Trinity in 1923 to succeed McTaggart in his teaching post there. For the rest of his life he continued to live in Trinity, for most of the time in rooms once inhabited by Newton. From 1933 until his retirement in 1953 he was Knightbridge professor of moral philosophy, in succession to W. R. Sorley.<br>
<br>As a philosopher Broad, as he was the first to admit, had little in the way of new ideas to contribute to philosophy. If anything, indeed, he was inclined to exaggerate both his uncreativeness and the rapidity with which he lost any real interest in the subject. In fact, he was a creditable specimen of what Locke claimed to be, namely an &#145;under-labourer&#146; for whom it is &#145;ambition enough to be employed &hellip; in clearing the ground a little and removing some of the rubbish&#146;. In a long series of books on a wide range of philosophical topics he explored the interests and doctrines of Russell with much greater care and thoroughness than Russell, and those of Moore without Moore's repetition and exasperating slowness.<br>
<br>The Lockean account of perceptual knowledge, as a rather precarious inference from private &#145;sensa&#146; to public objects endowed with only a few of the qualities commonly ascribed to them, was developed at length in Broad's dissertation. It reappears as part of a general account of the philosophy of science, taking account of recent developments in science, in <span class="italic">Scientific Thought</span> (1923) and as part of a comprehensive philosophy of mind in his Tarner lectures, <span class="italic">The Mind and its Place in Nature</span> (1925). Here for the first time appears a discussion of the psychical research to which he was to devote much of his energy. In 1927 he brought out the second and less abstract volume of his teacher McTaggart's <span class="italic">The Nature of Existence</span>, still in draft at its author's death. In 1934 <span class="italic">Five Types of Ethical Theory</span> gave careful, sometimes idiosyncratic accounts of some major moral philosophers. Broad's main work in the 1930s was his <span class="italic">Examination of McTaggart's Philosophy</span> (vol. 1, 1933; vol. 2, 1938), the largest and most impressive of his works, in which he gave enormously fair, even if ultimately negative, consideration to what was for him an ideal example of the kind of speculative philosophy that he believed to be possible in principle over and above the analytic or critical philosophy orthodox in his time.<br>
<br>Broad's later works were essay collections&#151;<span class="italic">Ethics and the History of Philosophy</span> (1952) and <span class="italic">Religion, Philosophy and Psychical Research</span> (1953)&#151;<span class="italic">Lectures on Psychical Research</span> (1962), and posthumously published lecture series on Leibniz and Kant. He had several honorary degrees, including both a LittD and ScD from Cambridge, and was elected FBA in 1926.<br>
<br>Broad was a conspicuous example of the traditional bachelor don of his epoch. Boyhood interests in railways and the Nordic world, particularly the latter, persisted into later life. In 1946 he made his first trip out of Britain to Scandinavia, and found the young men of Sweden a source of profound delight from that time forward. In the Second World War he served as junior bursar of his college and acquitted himself well. He did not visit America until the academic year following his retirement, 1953&#150;4, when he lectured at Michigan and the University of California at Los Angeles. He was a conscientious supervisor of his pupils but a dull lecturer, dictating matter already written out. He claimed to have lost all interest in philosophy by the time he became professor in 1933, but that is belied by the amplitude and seriousness of the work he continued to produce at least until the end of the 1930s. The sour retrospection more probably reflects his resentment at the fashionable obsession with Ludwig Wittgenstein, who returned to Cambridge in 1929 and soon stole any fire Broad may have had.<br>
<br>In appearance Broad was short, a little stocky, and bald from an early age. In later life he resembled nothing so much as a very senior warrant officer in the Royal Army Service Corps, with his rigidly set face and darting, suspicious eyes. He died in his rooms in Trinity College, Cambridge, on 11 March 1971.<br>
