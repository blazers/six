<span class="headword">Yorke, Sir  Joseph Sydney</span>  (1768&#150;1831), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30237/', "Charles Yorke (1722&#150;1770)")</script> and his second wife, Agneta, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Johnson (1740&#150;1820), and younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30239/', "Charles Philip Yorke (1764&#150;1834)")</script>, was born in London on 6 June 1768. He was educated at Harrow School (1779&#150;80) and entered the navy in 1780. In March 1781 he joined the <i>Duke</i>, commanded by Sir Charles Douglas, whom, in December, he followed to the <i>Formidable</i>, in which he was present at the action of 12 April 1782 and continued until she was paid off in 1783. The following year he was again with Douglas, in the <i>Assistance</i>, and returned home with him in the spring of 1785. He was then in the <i>Salisbury</i>, the flagship of Commodore John Elliot, on the Newfoundland station, and in the <i>Adamant</i>, with Sir Richard Hughes, at Halifax. On 27 June 1789 he was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Thisbe</i> with Captain Samuel Hood (1762&#150;1814), and returned to England at the end of the year. On 19 November 1790 he was promoted commander, and in February 1791 was appointed to the <i>Rattlesnake</i>, which he commanded in the channel until his promotion on 4 February 1793 to be captain of the <i>Circe</i>, in which, and afterwards in the <i>Stag</i>, the <i>Jason</i>, and the <i>Canada</i>, he served on the home station continuously until the peace of Amiens. On 22 August 1795, while in command of the <i>Stag</i>, he captured the Dutch frigate <i>Alliandie</i> off the coast of Norway. This, and other captures, earned him a significant amount of prize money, which he used to build his home, Sydney Lodge, at Southampton. On 29 March 1798 he married Elizabeth Weake (<i>d</i>. 1812), the daughter of James Rattray of Atherston, New Brunswick; they had six sons and a daughter. Their eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30240/', "Charles Philip Yorke")</script>, became fourth earl of Hardwicke.<br>
<br>In August 1803 Yorke was appointed to the <i>Prince George</i> in the channel. He then commanded the <i>Barfleur</i> and the <i>Christian VII</i>, also in the channel. In June 1810 he was knighted when acting as proxy for his half-brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30248/', "Philip Yorke, the third earl of Hardwicke")</script>, on his installation as KG. On 31 July 1810 he was promoted rear-admiral, and in the following January, with his flag in the <i>Vengeur</i>, he was sent out to Lisbon with reinforcements for the army. These were landed on 4 March, leading Mass&eacute;na to retreat from the lines of Torres Vedras. This was Yorke's last service afloat.<br>
<br>In July 1810 Yorke joined the Board of Admiralty, where he served under his elder brother Charles Philip Yorke. Although the latter resigned from the government in 1812, Yorke remained at the board, and rose to become first naval lord under Lord Melville in October 1813. He left this post, and the Admiralty borough, in 1818, at the same time that his brother retired from public life. Yorke remained an active tory member of parliament until the end of his life; he opposed Catholic emancipation, although he was prepared to support Canning's ministry. His seat at Reigate (1790&#150;1806, 1818&#150;31) was the family borough; St Germans (1806&#150;10) and West Looe (1812) were nomination boroughs, while Sandwich (1812&#150;18) was an Admiralty borough.<br>
<br>His first wife having died on 29 January 1812, on 22 May 1813 Yorke married Urania Annie Kington, formerly de Burgh, dowager marchioness of Clanricarde (<i>d</i>. 1843), widow of Colonel Peter Kington and of Henry de Burgh, marquess of Clanricarde, and daughter of George Paulet, the twelfth marquess of Winchester; they had no children. On 4 June 1814 he was made vice-admiral, on 2 January 1815 KCB, and on 22 July 1830 admiral. During his later years he lived principally at Sydney Lodge, but he devoted much time to the administration of various charities connected with the naval service. He was also chairman of the Waterloo Bridge Company, in which he took an active role. On 5 May 1831 he was drowned when the small yacht in which he was travelling from Southampton to Portsmouth was struck by lightning in Stokes' Bay. He was survived by his wife. He was interred in the family vault at Wimpole, Cambridgeshire. Yorke's career was dominated by the role of his elder brothers, the third earl of Hardwicke and Charles Philip Yorke, in the factional politics of the period, and his service at the Admiralty was always more political than administrative.<br>
