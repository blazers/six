<span class="headword">Miles,  Eustace Hamilton</span>  (1868&#150;1948), <span class="occ">sportsman, writer, and food reformer</span>, was born on 22 September 1868 at West End House, West End, Hampstead, the younger son of William Henry Miles, bookseller and later publisher, of Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co., and his wife, Mary M'Connell. He had at least one sister.<br>
<br>Miles was educated at Heath Mount preparatory school, Eastbourne College, and Marlborough College (1882&#150;1887), where he co-edited the <span class="italic">Marlburian</span> with the future novelist E. F. Benson (1867&#150;1940), who became a close friend. Unlike Benson's more sentimental Marlborough involvements, which he portrayed in an intense, crypto-erotic light in <span class="italic">David Blaize</span> (1916), his relationship with Miles appears to have been one of straightforwardly unromantic comradeship. The two played tennis and squash rackets together, and both went up to King's College, Cambridge, in October 1887, Miles with a minor scholarship which he exchanged for a full college scholarship two years later. In part one of the classical tripos, Miles's was among the more distinguished firsts of his year, but he gained only a second class in part two; he graduated in 1891. During the next fifteen years, until his marriage in 1906, he was known chiefly as an amateur athlete, and as author of various &#145;how to&#146; or &#145;teach yourself&#146; books on subjects as diverse as philology, sport, and the nutrition and general education of boys.<br>
<br>Miles stated in his <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry that he taught as an assistant master at Rugby School, but this is not confirmed by the school's own records. Better documented are his sporting successes: he was English amateur real tennis champion (1898&#150;1903, 1905&#150;6, 1909&#150;10) and amateur champion of America at squash rackets and real tennis (1900). He was amateur world champion at rackets (1902), and also for real tennis (1898&#150;1903, and 1905). In addition, he was four times world doubles champion at rackets (1902, 1904, 1905&#150;6). With Benson, whose interests were in golf and figure-skating, he edited a number of sporting books (1902&#150;5) in Hurst and Blackett's <span class="roman">Imperial Athletic Library</span>, and collaborated with him on <span class="italic">The Mad Annual</span> (1903), a humorously satirical compilation of a distinctly juvenile kind. In 1903 he was assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Magazine of Sport and Health</span>.<br>
<br>Early in 1906 Miles married Dorothy Beatrice (Hallie) Killick, daughter of the rector of St Clement Danes Church in London. Over the next thirty years she collaborated closely with her husband in the health-food shop and vegetarian restaurant, with associated enterprises for physical, mental, and spiritual self-training, which began operation the same year from premises at 40&#150;42 Chandos Street, Charing Cross. Within a few years Eustace Miles's Restaurant, which he promoted as a &#145;restaurant with ideals&#146;, had established a distinctive reputation, and it was wryly celebrated in E. M. Forster's <span class="italic">Howards End</span> (1910). The heroine of the novel, Margaret Schlegel, wonderfully captures the milieu:<blockquote>&#145;Next time,&#146; she said to Mr Wilcox, &#145;you shall come to lunch with me at Mr Eustace Miles's.&#146;<br>
<br>&#145;With pleasure.&#146;<br>
<br>&#145;No, you'd hate it,&#146; she said, pushing her glass towards him for some more cider. &#145;It's all proteids and body-buildings, and people coming up to you and beg pardon, but you have such a beautiful aura.&#146; (chap. 17)</blockquote>Theosophists, simple-lifers, aspiring writers, healers, and others of an idealistic bent were all encouraged to visit Miles's premises. He opened lecture-rooms, an advice bureau, a &#145;Normal Physical School&#146; and &#145;School of Cookery&#146;, and a publishing business which produced a steady stream of his works, in the form of pamphlets (<span class="roman">Milestones</span>) dispensing advice on health, including nervous, problems, books on food reform, fitness, the sporting spirit, and mental concentration, and a monthly (later quarterly) magazine. Mrs Miles's literary contributions emphasized the spiritual side of the movement. Bland, tasteless, and excessively simple by late twentieth-century standards, the recipes which Miles shared with his public were intended to provide a balanced, meat-free diet, and relied largely on the use of proprietary protein supplements such as Emprote combined with such humble dishes as lentil salad or scrambled eggs on toast. Husband and wife reiterated the beliefs of the food reform movement of the period, which crusaded against the wastefulness, indigestibility, and general harmfulness to health of the traditionally heavy, rich meat diet of the Edwardian upper and middle classes and of their counterparts elsewhere in the western world.<br>
<br>Although essentially a figure of the pre-1914 era with its enthusiasms and strong theoretical beliefs, Miles continued to expand business operations after the First World War. By 1929, in addition to the Chandos Street restaurant and a long-established vegetarian guest house at Carshalton, Surrey, he owned the Milestone Restaurant in the King's Road, Chelsea, and health-food shops in Bloomsbury and in the north and south London suburbs. None of these activities made him rich, however, and his estate at death was less than &pound;200. Miles died at 38 Palace Road, Streatham, London, on 20 December 1948.<br>
