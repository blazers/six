<span class="headword">William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>William Turbe]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1095&#150;1174), <span class="occ">bishop of Norwich</span>, was by Norwich tradition a Norman by birth. The name Turbe or Turba, under which he is sometimes found, probably derives from the nickname <i>turbo</i> (whirlwind) rather than any place name. He probably entered Norwich Cathedral priory as an oblate and was educated at the cathedral school, and certainly Bishop Herbert de Losinga (<i>d</i>. 1119) took a keen interest in his development. He occurs in Bishop Everard's episcopate probably as sub-prior, and certainly between 1136 and 1145 as prior. As such, he was an enthusiastic advocate of the embryonic cult of the boy martyr William, allegedly ritually murdered by Norwich Jews in 1144, and successfully silenced all doubts and bore down all opposition to it.<br>
<br>After the resignation of Everard in 1145, when despite the opposition of the sheriff the monks were for once able to conduct a genuinely free election, William was the natural choice of the convent as their bishop. He was consecrated either in 1146 or early 1147. He was brought to King Stephen's attention by two impassioned speeches in defence of one of his tenants accused of murdering a Norwich Jew, and in 1148 the king appointed him one of three bishops delegated to represent the whole English episcopate at the papal Council of Rheims. He was seldom, however, at Stephen's court, but was present at the council in 1153 that culminated in the treaty of Winchester, which foreshadowed the succession of Henry II. Although he was thereafter present at most great councils and at great ecclesiastical occasions, he appears remarkably infrequently as a witness of Henry's royal charters, and there are indications of tension. He opposed the scutage of 1156, and he refused to recognize the increased assessment for the knight-service of his lordship in 1166.<br>
<br>In 1163, with the other English bishops, William attended Pope Alexander III's Council of Tours. In the conflict between the king and Archbishop Thomas Becket that broke that year he was not one of the major participants, but he was inevitably and frequently involved. Some accounts state that at the councils of Clarendon and Northampton he urged the archbishop to submit because of fear of the king's hostility to him personally. In the following years he appears initially to have stood with Bishop Gilbert Foliot of London (<i>d</i>. 1187) against Becket, and John of Salisbury urged him, probably in 1168, towards a change of heart. In 1169, however, he was the first to announce publicly Becket's excommunication of Foliot for his failure to act decisively as papal judge-delegate against the earl of Norfolk for his aggression against the canons of Pentney, and subsequently he announced dramatically at Norwich the excommunication of the earl himself, thus courting royal fury; prudently, he retired to the cloister to live among his monks. However, the earl had been brought to submission before Becket's return from exile, and in the last month of the archbishop's life there was friendly correspondence between him and Bishop William over the aftermath of the Pentney affair.<br>
<br>Although he is not known to have had legal training, William played a part in the expansion of the papal judicial system that is characteristic of the second half of the twelfth century. In 1156 John of Salisbury wrote to Pope Adrian IV (<i>r</i>. 1154&#150;9) of the hostility that the bishop had incurred by fulfilling papal mandates, and ten years later William himself in a letter expressed the fullest confidence in the sovereign authority of the papacy. He was among papal judges-delegate commissioned in 1157 to adjudicate between Archbishop Theobald (<i>d</i>. 1161) and the abbot of St Augustine's, Canterbury, in 1162 was delegated to hear the claim of St Albans Abbey to exemption from the bishop of Lincoln, and in the mid-1160s to investigate the state of the Gilbertine houses of the southern province, in the aftermath of the revolt of the lay brothers against Gilbert of Sempringham. These were all <i>causes c&eacute;l&egrave;bres</i>, in which the crown as well as the papacy became involved. William also, however, communicated with Pope Alexander III (<i>r</i>. 1159&#150;81) on problems of more general import that he encountered either as diocesan or judge-delegate, such as the commutation of crusaders' vows, hereditary succession to benefices, frustratory appeals to delay judgment in church courts, and the forging of papal letters. His contribution to the development of the canon law in England is not to be compared with that of some of his younger contemporaries, but it is nevertheless not insignificant.<br>
<br>At his own cathedral church William continued to foster the cult of &#145;little&#146; St William. In 1150 he ordered the translation of the body to the chapter house, in 1151 to the interior of the church, and finally in 1154, at a great ceremony, to the chapel of the Holy Martyrs. He commissioned the composition by Thomas of Monmouth of an account of the life and miracles of St William, and finally in 1168 dedicated a chapel in Thorpe Wood, where the body had originally been discovered. There can be no doubt that the bishop believed in the veracity and validity of this highly dubious cult, and certainly the shrine continued to attract some pilgrims and donations in the late middle ages.<br>
<br>Bishop William issued general confirmations for the monks of Norwich and made some modest additions to their endowment. When the cathedral was badly damaged by fire in 1171, he is reported to have sat at the door collecting alms, and he certainly set himself urgently to its repair. There is evidence of tension towards the end of his episcopate, as he attempted to impose reform through the agency of a new prior who was assaulted by a faction of the monks, two of whom fled and were excommunicated by the bishop. He was, however, remembered there with affection, perhaps magnified because of the continual conflict between the convent and his successor, John of Oxford (<i>d</i>. 1200).<br>
<br>The evidence for Bishop William's governance of his diocese is provided mainly by some one hundred surviving written <i>acta</i>. It appears that he was not always, and certainly initially, well served by his subordinates. With two of his archdeacons, Walkelin (who appears as an engaging but totally unreformed rogue) and Baldwin of Boulogne, he came into open conflict, while a third, Roger, was very suspect in progressive ecclesiastical circles. By the end of his episcopate, however, he had promoted trained clerks from his own <i>familia</i>, in which for the first time <i>magistri</i> trained in the cathedral schools were prominent. Although a monastic bishop, William participated fully in the professionalization of ecclesiastical administration that is characteristic of his age.<br>
<br>In the early years of Henry II's reign William, like other bishops, was active in the restoration of ecclesiastical rights and properties, the loss of which the complainants invariably attributed to the lack of governance under Stephen. Battle Abbey and St Benet of Hulme were major beneficiaries of his intervention. Although a Benedictine himself, he fostered the newer orders, encouraging William d'Aubigny (<i>d</i>. 1176) to found an Augustinian house at Old Buckenham, and witnessing Ranulf Glanville's foundation charter for Butley. He appears to have been particularly solicitous of the welfare of nuns. Work was begun in the second year of his episcopate on a new nunnery at Norwich, female religious were admitted to share the common life of the monks of Blackborough, and he persuaded Abbot Hugh of Bury St Edmunds to grant a new site at Thetford to the nuns of Ling.<br>
<br>Under Bishop William there began in Norwich diocese the process, common to the whole of England, whereby the revenues of parish churches were appropriated to the use of monastic houses, which often already held rights of patronage. The bishop granted, for example, six churches in this way to St Benet's, and seven to Castle Acre Priory. By the end of his episcopate he was making provision in such churches for the appointment of vicars receiving a specified portion of the revenue and exercising responsibility for the cure of souls. Although increasing episcopal control over the appointment of incumbents is indicated by the survival, earlier than in most other dioceses, of letters of institution to benefices, Bishop William does not appear to have been as determined as some contemporary diocesans to eliminate all trace of hereditary succession to churches; there are several instances where he quite openly condoned the admission of a son to his father's living, as long as he was suitable. He appears, in other words, to have been conservative, although eager to improve the pastoral ministry, and confident that this could best be done by transferring parish churches to monastic control. He had been prepared to utilize both royal and papal authority to achieve these ends, but cannot be firmly labelled either a &#145;royalist&#146; or a &#145;papalist&#146; bishop.<br>
<br>William died in January 1174, and was buried in Norwich Cathedral. He was commemorated by his monks on 16 January. An interesting reflection on his career and record is that he had received words of praise from both Thomas Becket and Gilbert Foliot.<br>
