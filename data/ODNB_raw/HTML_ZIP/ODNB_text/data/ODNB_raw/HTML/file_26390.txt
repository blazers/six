<span class="headword">Stephens,  Nathaniel</span>  (1606/7&#150;1678), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, son of Richard Stephens, vicar from 1604 of Stanton St Bernard, Wiltshire, was born in Wiltshire. On 14 March 1623, at the age of sixteen, he entered Magdalen Hall, Oxford, graduating BA on 14 February 1626 and proceeding MA on 25 June 1628. Stephens was described as &#145;a good scholar and &hellip; a very hard student&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of George Fox</span>, 1.394), reportedly devoting sixteen hours a day to study. On leaving the university Stephens was appointed curate at Stanton and was ordained on 23 May 1630. On 26 July 1638 he was instituted to the rectory of Fenny Drayton, Leicestershire, at the instance of the powerful local Purefoy family. Driven from Fenny Drayton by the outbreak of the civil war in 1642, he took refuge in parliamentarian Coventry, where he subscribed the presbyterian solemn league and covenant, became morning preacher at St Michael's Church, and formed a lasting friendship with Richard Baxter, with whom he discussed Calvinist theology. He returned to Fenny Drayton in 1645 and ministered to the puritan father and family of George Fox, founder of the Quakers, who later recalled &#145;I knew this preist from a childe&#146;  (ibid., 1.253).<br>
<br>Stephens initially thought highly of George Fox, discussed with him religious topics including Christ's death, and preached on subjects from their talks, a practice which Fox came to resent. In 1649, while Stephens was giving a sermon in Market Bosworth, Fox interrupted him. Stephens shouted out that he was mad, and Fox, driven out of the town by a mob, recorded the clergyman as his foremost persecutor in his native county: according to Fox, Stephens co-ordinated hostile receptions for him in Leicestershire in 1651 and 1654 and alarmed Fox's family with reports that the Quaker founder &#145;was taken uppe above the Clouds &amp; after found again full of gold &amp; sylver&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of George Fox</span>, 1.14). Public debates between Fox and Stephens in 1654 captured the opposition between Fox's radical, anticlerical form of Christianity and Stephens's orthodox, academic, and clerical Calvinism. Stephens had similar confrontations with Gerrard Winstanley and with Baptists.<br>
<br>The 1650s were Stephens's most active decade of authorship in the defence of mainstream Calvinist churchmanship. In 1651 he published a defence of infant baptism, <span class="italic">A Precept for the Baptisme of Infants out of the New Testament</span>, which elicited a riposte from John Tombes in <span class="italic">Antipaedobaptism, or, No Plain &hellip; Scripture Proof of Infants' Baptism</span> (1652); in 1653 Stephens was planning with Baxter a full reply to Tombes. Stephens also demonstrated his essential orthodoxy, moderation, and fairness in <span class="italic">Defence of the Doctrine of Original Sin</span> (1658) and in a major work (1656) in the English protestant eschatological tradition.<br>
<br>Following the Restoration, Stephens was ejected from the rectory of Fenny Drayton under the 1662 <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>, and he made way for his successor on 29 January 1663. He continued to preach to small groups but his services were often interrupted. Having been driven out of Fenny Drayton on several occasions, he was ministering to a small presbyterian congregation in Hinckley in Leicestershire in 1669 and subsequently moved to Stoke Golding, 3 miles from Hinckley, where his house was licensed for presbyterian worship under the declaration of indulgence in 1672, preaching there until lameness confined him to his chair. Stephens was reported &#145;in his old age pleasant [humorous] and chearful&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of George Fox</span>, 1.394) and it may have been a fondness for whimsicality that helped alienate him from the humourless Fox. Stephens was buried on 24 February 1678 in the churchyard of Stoke Golding. His wife, Joan, vehemently supported his religious views; they had two daughters and four sons, one of whom, Nathaniel (<i>d</i>. 1687), was recorded as an active nonconformist in 1672.<br>
