<span class="headword">Johnson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Croke]</span>,  Frances</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Begum Johnson]</span>  (1728&#150;1812), <span class="occ">hostess</span>, was celebrated not only for her remarkable longevity in India, where few Britons outlived two monsoon seasons, but also for her four marriages and her influential circle of friends. She was born on 10 April 1728 at Fort St David, on the Coromandel coast. Her father was an East India Company official, Edward Croke (1690&#150;1769), and her mother, Isabella Beizor (<i>d</i>. 1780), of Portuguese descent. Frances was sent to Calcutta in 1743 to marry Perry Purpell Templer, merchant, with whom she had two children, both of whom died in infancy. Templer died on 25 January 1748 and that November she married another merchant, James Altham, who died ten days later of smallpox. Her third marriage, in 1749, to William Watts, company agent at Cossimbazar, was the most long-lasting and successful.<br>
<br>Eighteenth-century India saw a power struggle between France and Britain for mastery, especially in the Carnatic and Bengal, led by heroic figures like General J.-F. Dupleix and Robert Clive. In 1756 Cossimbazar was besieged by Siraj ud-daula, nawab of Bengal, who was misinformed about the reputed wealth of its British inhabitants. The Watts now had three children and Frances was pregnant with the fourth. William Watts surrendered the fort without resistance, but Frances was allowed to remain there unharmed, until ordered to neighbouring Murshidabad. A former acquaintanceship with the nawab's mother, Amina Begam, meant Frances and her children were protected there until they could be safely (and fortunately) moved to Chandernagore, thereby escaping the sack of Calcutta in June of that year. (In later life it was Frances Johnson's constant affectionate references to Amina Begam that led to her being styled Begam Johnson herself, by her friends, though she is more commonly known to later generations as Begum Johnson.) After Calcutta's recapture by Clive, Frances rejoined her husband there, and William was sent to negotiate with the nawab, who was defeated at the battle of Plassey in 1757. Two years later William, now a rich man, took his wife and children to England, but Frances could not settle in this cold, foreign country. William died in 1764, the children grew up, and she returned to Calcutta in 1769, buying a house at 10 Clive Street, where she lived for the rest of her life, mixing in the highest circles of company officials.<br>
<br>In 1774, aged forty-six, Frances made a fourth, unfortunate, marriage, this time to the Revd William Johnson (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1744), chaplain of St John's Church, Calcutta, nicknamed the Revd Tally-Ho, and sixteen years her junior. He treated her unkindly, and she eventually paid him to leave India in 1788, to the relief of her many friends. She blossomed into a society hostess, and Warren and Marian Hastings, Lord Cornwallis, Arthur Wellesley (later the duke of Wellington), and his brother Richard, Lord Mornington, all visited her at Clive Street. The remarkable absence of elderly Britons in India (for many died young and others returned home after service) meant she became a unique institution, especially as she kept up the old habits of dining at four in the afternoon and entertaining until the early hours. She kept nine slave girls, not unusual at the time, when Africans were imported and Bengali children captured or sold by their parents. Four of her five grandsons came to serve in India, including Mordaunt Ricketts, later the resident at Lucknow. Another grandson, Lord Liverpool, later British prime minister, sent her boxes of millinery every year. Her portrait, by Thomas Hickey, shows an elderly, though still handsome, woman, draped in lace ruffles, ribbons, and bows.<br>
<br>Begum Johnson died at her home on 3 February 1812 after a series of &#145;spasms&#146; (probably strokes) and abscesses, aged eighty-three. She was buried two days later in St John's churchyard, at a spot she had chosen, next to the tomb of Job Charnock, the founder of Calcutta; her funeral was attended by the governor-general, the chief justice, and other notables. Her elaborate tomb bears a long, somewhat inaccurate inscription, taken verbatim when her memory had begun to fail.<br>
