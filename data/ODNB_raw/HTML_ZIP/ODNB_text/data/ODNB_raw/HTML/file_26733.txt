<span class="headword">Stubbs,  George Townly</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1748, <em>d.</em> 1815?), <span class="occ">engraver and printseller</span>, was probably the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26732/', "George Stubbs (1724&#150;1806)")</script>, painter. His baptism on 26 February 1748 <span class="smallcap">NS</span> is recorded in the registers of St Helen's Church, York (information traced by David Alexander). His mother may have been Mary Spencer (<i>d</i>. 1817), who is now identified as George's common-law wife, although the birth of Richard Spencer Stubbs to George Stubbs and Mary Spencer in 1791 suggests that this is doubtful. More likely, the name Townly (as it appears on his prints) or Townley might have been the surname of his mother. His first mezzotints, <span class="italic">The Lion and Stag</span> and <span class="italic">The Horse &amp; Lion</span>, were published by John Wesson in 1770 and he was probably the &#145;gentleman&#146; who exhibited <span class="italic">A Lion Devouring a Stag; Mezzotinto</span> with the Society of Artists in that year. In 1771 he exhibited a drawing as &#145;Mr George Stubbs junior&#146;. He scraped a number of mezzotints after George Stubbs's paintings in the 1770s and began to publish on his own account in 1776.<br>
<br>In the early 1780s George Townly Stubbs collaborated with the drawing-master and engraver Charles White and the gem-engraver and caricaturist James Wickstead on a series of stipple engravings, some of which had humorous subjects. He was bankrupted in 1785. Stylistic evidence suggests that he might have been the engraver of some caricatures about the prince of Wales's romance with Mrs Fitzherbert that were published in 1786. In 1788 he produced two large mezzotints of high quality, <span class="italic">Horses Fighting</span> and <span class="italic">Bulls Fighting</span>, after paintings by George Stubbs and during the next decade he returned to interpreting George Stubbs's work, employing either stipple or sophisticated combinations of tools. During the 1790s he was the manager of the Turf Gallery in Conduit Street, off New Bond Street, and he may have written the text of a <span class="italic">Review of the Turf</span>. As originally proposed this ambitious project was to have encompassed &#145;the history of every horse of note, with various anecdotes on the most remarkable races&#146;, and it was to have been &#145;embellished with upwards of one hundred and twenty prints, engraved in the best manner from original portraits of the most famous racers, painted by Mr. Stubbs at an immense expence and solely for the above work&#146;  (Lennox-Boyd and others, 43). The enterprise collapsed in 1796 after only fourteen horses had been engraved by George Townly Stubbs. From the inception of this project he styled himself &#145;engraver to the prince of Wales&#146; and there was a strong implication that this most unreliable of patrons may have promised to underwrite the enterprise. The prints were published by &#145;Messrs Stubbs&#146; and it is conceivable that George Townly Stubbs was himself the mysterious Mr Turf upon whose backing they relied. During the 1790s Stubbs also engraved sets of prints after designs by Edward Penny and Anthony van Assen and published some landscapes by Thomas Morris. He maintained a print shop on Marylebone High Street from at least 1793 to 1800. His latest publications were a series of heads expressing passions after Henry Singleton and William Frederick Wells issued in summer 1800. After this date George Townly Stubbs may have lived by painting or dealing in paintings. He is said to have died in 1815 and this notion is supported by the republication by other publishers of some of his prints in that year.<br>
