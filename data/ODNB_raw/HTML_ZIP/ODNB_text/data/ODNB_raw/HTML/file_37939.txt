<span class="headword">Schorne,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1315), <span class="occ">reputed saint</span>, should not be assumed to have come from the village in Kent of that name. Unlike other English &#145;saints&#146; of his time, Schorne was neither political in his appeal nor of reported charisma in his life, of which next to nothing is known. There was a minor, uninfluential theme in his posthumous reputation that he had come by abnormally horny knees from long hours in prayer. Schorne's real fame in picture and text lay invariably in his exploit of trapping the devil in his boot, but what, if any, incident or allegory underlay this celebration remains completely obscure. He was evidently a magister by 1273 (of Oxford University, according to the fifteenth-century antiquarian William Worcester), when he was presented to the rectory of Steppingley, Bedfordshire, by Dunstable Priory. This he vacated by May 1282. Perhaps it was then, rather than in 1290 as often supposed, that the priory presented him to the rectory of North Marston, Buckinghamshire, where his cult was to develop, and which he held until his death. One of his name and style was acting as deputy for the absentee archdeacon of Buckingham (the brother of the future Pope Adrian V) in Chesham on 11 May 1280.<br>
<br>Since Schorne was described in an episcopal record in 1273 as a subdeacon and became an incumbent with cure of souls at that time, it is probably wrong to identify him with the namesake collated by Archbishop John Pecham to the rectory of Monks Risborough, Buckinghamshire, on 24 September 1289, a man who had been ordained subdeacon on the title of that benefice just twelve days earlier in Kent. (This man became a deacon on 17 December 1289 and a priest on 27 May 1290 and still held that rectory in 1294.) In what purports to be his will (BL, Lansdowne MS 762, fol. 2; dated 9 May 1313), which is singular in style, Schorne speaks of old age and renders to God what was God's (his soul), to the earth what was the earth's (his body, in a tomb he had designated before the high altar of North Marston), and his goods to be divided between intercessors and the poor, for the welfare of his soul. While some very local cult developed quickly, it spread only in the mid-fifteenth century, from which time come all the extant depictions of him (complete with diabolical captive), in groups from Norfolk (Cawston, Suffield, Gateley), Suffolk (St Gregory's, Sudbury, and possibly Bury St Edmunds Abbey), and Devon (Hennock, Alphington, and Wolborough); two texts of a lengthy invocation to him; and the prosecution (in 1448) of the then vicar of North Marston for counterfeiting his head from an exhumed skull. (Three bloody wounds were a regrettable excess of artistic licence.)<br>
<br>The perpetual spring Schorne had divined for his parish in time of drought came replete with gypsum, Epsom salts, and carbonic acid, and thereby lent considerable support to his posthumous reputation, principally as a healer of rheumatic and eye afflictions, but with an occasional talent in respect of dead oxen and the drowned. So substantial was his fame and profitability that on 7 April 1478 Richard Beauchamp, bishop of Salisbury and dean of Windsor, secured a licence from Pope Sixtus IV to relocate his bones. In fact, in 1480 the chapter of Windsor secured the appropriated rectory of North Marston itself, presumably to control and maximize the market. Schorne's lavish new shrine was the first part of St George's Chapel, Windsor, to be built, in the prime south-east corner. Even without his well, he proved the reliable crowd-puller and money-spinner he had been thought to be, although neither records nor general report substantiate the enormous revenues and popularity sometimes claimed for him. He continued also to thrive at North Marston, where the chapter took pains to market their investment with a modish development of the church. Although deplored by Lollards and reformers such as Erasmus (and later John Bale and John Foxe), pilgrimages to both shrines were used by the church as a reputable penance and remained popular, in southern England, down to the Reformation.<br>
<br>Despite the fame of the boot, Schorne's cult seems to have been a sensitive one, neither coarse nor exhibitionist. It may be compared with the gentle popularity in Exeter of Bishop Edmund Lacy. Significantly, both escaped the long pre-Reformation decline of saints generally. Schorne's image at North Marston was sent to London for destruction by the commissioner to Thomas Cromwell, Dr John Stokesley, in September 1537. In 1585 his chapel at Windsor was redeployed as a tomb for Edward Clinton, earl of Lincoln. Schorne had died by February 1315.<br>
