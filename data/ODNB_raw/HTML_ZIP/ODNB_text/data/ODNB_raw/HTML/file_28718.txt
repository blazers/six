<span class="headword">Warde,  Luke</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1576&#150;1590), <span class="occ">sea captain</span>, sailed with Martin Frobisher in his three north-west voyages (1576&#150;8). In 1578 he was admitted, gratis, as a &pound;25 shareholder in the enterprise. In the early part of that year he was employed briefly in home waters against privateers; in May he sailed in Frobisher's third voyage as the vice-admiral of a 100-man colony, commanded by Edward Fenton, that was intended to winter upon Baffin Island. The scheme was abandoned due to loss of vital supplies. On 20 June 1578 he was one of a small party of Englishmen, led by Frobisher, which landed upon the southern coast of Greenland (mistakenly believed to be the mythical island of Friesland). Their landing place, possibly first descried by Warde, was named Luke's Sound. Three weeks later he was the first known Englishman to set foot on the northern shore of Hudson Strait; there he briefly parleyed and exchanged gifts with some Inuit.<br>
<br>In 1581 Warde was involved in preparations for the &#145;first enterprise&#146;, promoted by the earl of Leicester, Francis Drake, and others, to set out a fleet to fortify the Azores Island of Terceira in support of the Portuguese pretender, Don Antonio, and thereafter to seize the Spanish plate fleets and sack the towns of New Spain. When the scheme was abandoned as too provocative, Warde was partly responsible for selling off its supplies. By 1582 he was the owner of a small barque, the <i>Elizabeth</i>, which he sold to Sir Humphrey Gilbert for &pound;40. In that year he was appointed to serve as vice-admiral commanding the ship <i>Edward Bonaventure</i> in the intended Moluccas expedition under Edward Fenton (who superseded Martin Frobisher as its commander); he also invested &pound;200 in the project. During the voyage he quarrelled with Fenton regarding their objectives, and the <i>Edward Bonaventure</i> abandoned the expedition following a sea fight against three Spanish ships at S&atilde;o Vicente. Warde later provided his account of the voyage to Richard Hakluyt for inclusion in the 1589 edition of <span class="italic">Principall Navigations</span>. He was named in a list of 5 January 1586 as one of seventy-six men &#145;fit to command ships&#146;. In 1588 he served in the Armada battle as captain of the queen's ship <i>Tramontana</i> and, immediately after the campaign, of the <i>Foresight</i>. In 1589 he captained the <i>Tramontana</i> once more as part of Frobisher's Atlantic squadron, which tried and failed to intercept the Spanish plate fleets. On 2 January 1590 Warde was appointed to lead the small channel fleet that was to disembark Willoughby's diseased expeditionary force from Rouen; however, his old commander Frobisher assumed this command a few days later. Warde commanded the ship <i>Swallow</i> in the narrow seas during 1590; the declared accounts of the navy which record this are the final extant reference to his career.<br>
<br>Richard Madox, chaplain in the <i>Galleon Leicester</i> during Fenton's 1582 expedition, regarded Warde as &#145;a most villainous man&#146;  (Donno, 239). Conversely, his long relationship with Frobisher indicates that he remained a trusted colleague of that notoriously difficult personality. He was undoubtedly a competent sea captain, though possibly not entirely comfortable with the responsibilities his talents conferred. He appears not to have married; the only extant reference to his family is in Madox's diary, which reported that his mother came to the <i>Edward Bonaventure</i> to bid him farewell upon the 1582 voyage.<br>
