<span class="headword">Weyland, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1230&#150;1298), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was the third son of Herbert Weyland and his wife, Beatrice, one of six daughters and coheirs of Stephen of Witnesham, a minor landholder at Witnesham near Ipswich in Suffolk. His eldest brother, John, was a clerk of the common bench from <i>c</i>.1244 until his death in 1259. A second older brother, William, pursued an administrative and judicial career in both Ireland and England from 1248 onwards which included service as the seneschal of the earl of Norfolk's Irish liberty of Ross, as an itinerant royal justice in Ireland in 1257&#150;8, as escheator of England south of the Trent between 1261 and 1264, as seneschal of the liberty of Kildare (in 1269), and as an itinerant justice and justice of the common bench in England between 1271 and his death in 1274. His younger brother Richard followed an administrative career in East Anglia in the service of various magnates including the earl of Norfolk and John de Burgh and at least two religious houses (Ely Cathedral priory and the abbey of Bury St Edmunds) from <i>c</i>.1265 until his death in 1296 or 1297.<br>
<br>Thomas Weyland first appears in the records in 1251, as the attorney of his eldest brother for the making of final concord. In 1258 he was in a position to pay 100 marks to purchase the Suffolk manor of Chillesford, and in 1259 paid a further 300 marks to purchase a second Suffolk manor at Blaxhall, but it is unclear how he accumulated this money or what career he was then pursuing. There is no evidence that he was a professional lawyer, and it seems unlikely that he had followed his elder brother into clerical service in the courts. Later evidence suggests that he received a clerical tonsure at an early stage in his adult life, but had abandoned it by the time of his first marriage to Anne, the daughter of Richard de Coleville, in or before 1266. By 1270 he had also received knighthood. It is possible that his early career resembled that later followed by his younger brother Richard, but it is only during a brief period immediately preceding his first appointment as an itinerant royal justice at the very end of the reign of Henry III that evidence survives to place him in the service of Roger (IV) Bigod, earl of Norfolk (<i>d</i>. 1306), and in that of the earl's brother-in-law, John Fitzjohn (<i>d</i>. 1275).<br>
<br>Thomas Weyland became a justice of the common bench in Michaelmas term 1274, two terms after the death of his elder brother William. He served as a junior justice until Master Roger of Seaton (<i>d</i>. 1279) retired as chief justice in the summer of 1278. He then held office as chief justice of the court for eleven years, until the end of Trinity term 1289. His period as chief justice is the first for which a substantial quantity of law reports survives. These indicate that Weyland played a major role in determining the litigation of the court, either on his own or with a single colleague, William of Brompton, and that he possessed a clear and sharp legal mind. A rather different light is shed on his period of office by the complaints of misconduct lodged against him and his colleagues after his removal from office. Not all were justified, but some evidently were. In the most egregious instance he can be shown to have corruptly altered his own plea roll in land litigation involving one of his relatives, and to have then been rewarded for his assistance by being granted an interest in the property in dispute. Weyland made substantial property acquisitions while chief justice: seven manors or substantial holdings in his home county of Suffolk, three manors or substantial holdings in Essex, and various other holdings elsewhere. He spent an average of about &pound;150 a year on property acquisitions between 1278 and 1289. These may in part have been financed from the legitimate profits of judicial office. They may also in part have been paid for out of the income from the extensive land holdings in both England and Ireland, worth at least &pound;150 a year, that he possessed when he became chief justice, of which around two-thirds had been inherited from his brother William. His second wife's dower lands also brought in a substantial income. But his evident lack of scruple may have meant that these acquisitions were partly financed out of the proceeds of judicial corruption as well.<br>
<br>It was not, however, judicial misconduct that led to Weyland's removal from office. On 20 July 1289 two of his servants committed a murder at a fair. The victim was an Irish servant of the earl of Norfolk living in Suffolk, variously known as William Carwel, Carewel the Forester, and Carewel the Parker of Framlingham. The killing may have been the unpremeditated outcome of a drunken brawl. It is more likely, however, that it was connected with a bitter factional struggle between the followers of the earl of Norfolk which was taking place at this time. Weyland and his servants may have become involved in these because of Weyland's own close ties with the earl as one of his leading counsellors. There is no suggestion that Weyland had sent his servants to commit the murder, but he became an accessory after the fact when he failed to have them arrested when they returned to his Suffolk manor of Monewden, even though he knew of the murder. The earl's desire to have the killers punished led to the issuing of a special commission of inquiry on 4 September. The special justices had the killers arrested, and they were convicted and hanged at a gaol delivery session at Melton in Suffolk on 14 September. The jurors also indicted the chief justice for harbouring the killers, and orders were given for his capture. A clerk of the sheriff was sent to Witnesham to arrest Weyland, but after his arrest he escaped under cover of darkness and made his way to the Franciscan priory of Babwell, just outside Bury St Edmunds. Here he took the order's habit and resumed clerical tonsure. When his place of refuge became known, Edward I sent Robert Malet to supervise local arrangements for starving him out of the priory. By the middle of January 1290 Weyland had surrendered, probably in return for a safe conduct to the Tower of London. When he reached the Tower he was offered a choice between standing trial, perpetual imprisonment, and exile. He chose exile. At a special gaol delivery session held at the Tower on 20 February he took an oath of abjuration, promising to leave England and not return to it or any other of the king's territories (including Ireland, where until recently he had held lands) without the king's special permission. He was assigned Dover as his port of embarkation, and given nine days to reach it on foot.<br>
<br>Thomas Weyland's family was fortunate. An abjuration normally meant not only the forfeiture of the abjuror's chattels but also the escheat of all of his lands. Edward I was merciful to Weyland's second wife, Margaret, whom he had married by 1276 and whose maiden name was probably Filliol; she was allowed to keep not only her clothes, jewels, and personal possessions but also the goods and chattels in the manors she held in dower from her first husband, John of Moze, even though in strict law these all belonged to her husband. Weyland had retained sole title to at least three of his manors and these did escheat. However, he had taken considerable care to make provision for each of his children and for his widow when he died. His lands were to be divided between the three children of his first marriage (John, William, and Alina) and three of the children of his second (Richard, Elena, and Margaret); the fourth (Thomas) entered the church, and his widow was to retain a life interest in part of the lands. One by-product of the way he had made these arrangements was that he was only the joint tenant for life of almost all his other lands, and thus they were not legally liable to escheat. Although his children and his widow were engaged in long litigation with the lords concerned, they ultimately made good their claim to almost all his lands with the exception of the Gloucestershire manor of Chipping Sodbury, which the earl of Gloucester managed to retain.<br>
<br>By 1292 Thomas Weyland had taken up residence in Paris. When a representative of Edward I canvassed various Parisian experts on the Scottish succession question in that year, he brought back with him an opinion from the exiled chief justice. Eventually (probably in 1297) Edward I pardoned Thomas Weyland and allowed him to return home. It was at his wife's dower manor of Brundon in Essex (now in Suffolk) that he died in January 1298. He may have been buried in the priory church of Woodbridge in Suffolk, of which he had been a benefactor.<br>
