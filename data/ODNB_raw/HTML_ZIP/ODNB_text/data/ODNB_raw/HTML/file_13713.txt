<span class="headword">Hope,  Alexander James Beresford  Beresford</span>  (1820&#150;1887), <span class="occ">politician and author</span>, was born on 25 January 1820, the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13737/', "Thomas Hope (1769&#150;1831)")</script>, art collector, of Deepdene, Surrey, and his wife, Louisa (<i>d</i>. 21 July 1851), youngest child of William Beresford, first Baron Decies, archbishop of Tuam. Louisa Hope later married, on 29 November 1832, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2199/', "William Carr Beresford, Viscount Beresford (1768&#150;1854)")</script>. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42186/', "Henry Thomas Hope")</script> was his elder brother. On inheriting the English estates of his stepfather, Alexander Hope took the additional name of Beresford before that of Hope (30 May 1854). After a prize-winning career at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge (matriculated 1837, BA 1841, MA 1844), he became MP for Maidstone (1841&#150;52; 1857&#150;65), for Stoke-on-Trent (1865&#150;8), and eventually for Cambridge University (1868&#150;87). He married, on 7 July 1842, Lady Mildred Arabella Charlotte Henrietta Cecil (1822&#150;1881), eldest daughter of James, second marquess of Salisbury, and sister of Robert, third marquess of Salisbury, later prime minister. She was for many years a leader of London society; they had three sons and seven daughters.<br>
<br>Describing himself as a &#145;Conservative, yet liberal and unshackled by party&#146;, Beresford Hope consistently supported the established church, &#145;both as a divine institution, and as an estate of the realm&#146;  (<span class="italic">WWBMP</span>, 31). He voted for agricultural protection in 1846, &#145;on the ground <i>solely</i> of a previous appeal not having been made to the constituencies&#146;; and he opposed a graduated income tax in the 1840s, secret ballots in the 1850s, and electoral reform in the 1860s  (<span class="italic">Dod's Parliamentary Companion</span>, 1858, 1870, 1881). Throughout his career he strongly supported church rates and denominational education, and was conspicuously hostile to the disestablishment of the Irish church. He spoke out for the rights of the south as well as the north in the American Civil War, and he vehemently attacked successive bills to legitimize marriage with a deceased wife's sister. In all this he seldom adopted an orthodox party line, and he often opposed Disraeli, as in April 1867 when he famously described the tory leader as an &#145;Asian mystery&#146;. Such attitudes hardly made for a successful parliamentary career, and towards the end of his life he readily acknowledged his failure. &#145;I could have imagined myself&#146;, he admitted, &#145;measuring swords with Gladstone, or Disraeli, or Carlyle, or Tennyson, or Montalembert. Now I shall die a second rate notoriety &hellip; &#147;the rich Mr. Beresford Hope&#148;&#146;  (Law and Law, 126, 232).<br>
<br>Beresford Hope was a prolific journalist and an architectural pundit of considerable influence. Having inherited a fortune in 1841, a great London mansion (Arklow House, Connaught Place) in 1843, and sizeable estates in Kent and Staffordshire (Bedgebury Park and Beresford Hall), he placed his resources at the service of the Gothic revival. He was an outspoken president of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1865&#150;7, co-proprietor of&#151;and regular contributor to&#151;the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> from 1855, and for many years a committed chairman (1846 onwards) and president (1859 onwards) of the Ecclesiological (previously Camden) Society. In all these roles he aimed to expand the language of architectural form, linking English and European styles, and hoped even to integrate the practice of architecture and engineering. He was William Butterfield's patron at St Augustine's, Canterbury&#151;in 1844 he had purchased the ancient buildings as a college for missionary clergy&#151;and (not without quarrels) at All Saints, Margaret Street, London; he was Gilbert Scott's advocate in the battle for the Foreign Office design in 1858; and he was William Burges's champion in the law courts competition of 1867. And even when the Gothic revival began to wane, he remained in church-building matters an adherent of &#145;creative restoration&#146;; in fact he denounced William Morris's &#145;anti-scrape&#146; doctrine as &#145;a Gospel of Death&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 571). Beresford Hope's support for Burges's plan to complete St Paul's Cathedral with a full-blown scheme of mural decoration was too &#145;creative&#146; for most classicists. And his support for Butterfield's abstracted polychromy proved too &#145;progressive&#146; for many Goths. Yet although he was a Gothicist to his heart's core, he eventually discovered Gothic principles&#151;of skyline, composition, and planning&#151;in Venice and Amsterdam alike, and in seventeenth-century Paris and fifteenth-century Bruges. Almost everywhere, in fact, except in Palladianism and neo-classicism. The result was a new, assimilative approach to style which he formulated in a series of articles and pamphlets, and which he christened &#145;progressive eclecticism&#146;  (A. B. Hope, <span class="italic">The Common Sense of Art</span>, 1858). Ironically, it was this approach&#151;fusing medieval and Renaissance traditions in pursuit of a new synthesis&#151;which first recreated the Gothic revival in the 1860s, then destroyed it in the 1870s. Modern Gothic gave way to Queen Anne.<br>
<br>In the politics of ecclesiology Beresford Hope played an ambivalent role. Although he will be forever linked with Benjamin Webb and John Mason Neale&#151;the high-church trinity of Trinity College, Cambridge&#151;his churchmanship was rather different to theirs. He was less of a sacramentalist than Neale, less of a ritualist than Webb. He was, after all, a layman. His Anglicanism was establishmentarian, moderate, paternal, tory. He was a high-churchman of the Hook and Hooker type&#151;rather different from being a ritualist.<br>
<br>In private Beresford Hope could be humorous, even quixotic; but as a public figure he was not helped by an awkward manner and an over-elaborate style of speech. Disraeli sarcastically alluded to his &#145;Batavian graces&#146;, a reference to Hope's Dutch ancestry and stilted delivery  (Kebbel, 1.600). Even so, as a churchman, as a critic, most of all as a patron, he has his place in architectural history.<br>
<br>Besides numerous essays, reviews, and pamphlets&#151;notably <span class="italic">Public Offices and Metropolitan Improvements</span> (1857), <span class="italic">The Common Sense of Art</span> (1858), <span class="italic">The Condition and Prospects of Architectural Art</span> (1863), <span class="italic">The World's Debt to Art</span> (1863), and <span class="italic">The Art Workman's Position</span> (1864)&#151;Beresford Hope was the author of <span class="italic">The English Cathedral of the Nineteenth Century</span> (1861), <span class="italic">Worship in the Church of England</span> (1874), and two novels, <span class="italic">Strictly Tied Up</span> (1880) and <span class="italic">The Brandreths</span> (1882). He was a privy councillor (1880), a trustee of the British Museum and the National Portrait Gallery, and a fellow of various learned societies; he was awarded honorary doctorates by Oxford (1848), Cambridge (1864), Washington (1879), Tennessee (1879), and Dublin (1881). Beresford Hope died at Bedgebury Park, Cranbrook, Kent, on 20 October 1887, and was buried six days later at Kilndown, Kent. His fortune had been great, but after a lifetime of patronage he left only &pound;78,270.<br>
