<span class="headword">Dunne,  John William</span>  (1875&#150;1949), <span class="occ">writer on philosophy</span>, was born in south Africa, the elder son among the three children of General Sir John Hart Dunne KCB of Cartron, co. Roscommon, and his wife, Julia Elizabeth, daughter of William R. Chapman of Whitby, Yorkshire. He was brought up in south Africa, and at the age of six had a serious accident which confined him to bed for three years. He read a great deal as a child and later said that he read Euclid as easily as an adult reads a novel. At seventeen he became a pupil on a farm. After serving with the imperial yeomanry in the South African War he became an aeronautical engineer, using his observation of seabirds in flight to design a revolutionary type of monoplane with swept-back wings. The War Office was sufficiently impressed to employ him, with a view to the production of a prototype, in 1906, but the model was not accepted.<br>
<br>Dunne would have been forgotten&#151;except, perhaps, by fly-fishermen, for his first book was a beginners' guide to the art of the dry fly&#151;if <span class="italic">An Experiment with Time</span> (1927) had not enjoyed an immediate and lasting success. In it he described a succession of his dreams over a period of thirty years which seemed to show glimpses of the future, and provided a theory of time to account for them. Among those who were impressed was H. G. Wells, who found the book &#145;fantastically interesting&#146;. It was widely praised, even in <span class="italic">Nature</span>, which might have been sceptical. A suggestion that Dunne threw out caught many a reader's fancy: anybody, he argued, could obtain the same results as he had simply by having a pad and a pencil beside the bed and writing down remembered dreams immediately on waking up.<br>
<br>&#145;Dunne dreams&#146; became common colloquial usage for dreams foreshadowing future experiences. His &#145;serialism&#146;, however, the theory he provided to account for them, failed to convince scientists that it fused with the new physics. Dunne himself went out of his way to insist that his theory was free from any occult taint, but <span class="italic">An Experiment with Time</span>, revised and expanded in 1934, was to remain in print for over half a century and, ironically, it won the reputation of doing more to convince the general public of the reality of clairvoyance, in the form of precognition, than all the labours of the psychical researchers whom Dunne so mistrusted.<br>
<br>Dunne belonged to &#145;the military section of Britain's old upper class&#146;, as J. B. Priestley, who based <span class="italic">Time and the Conways</span> (1937) on his interpretation of Dunne's theory, was to recall; &#145;he looked and behaved like the old regular officer type crossed with a mathematician and an engineer&#146;. He was also &#145;as far removed from any suggestion of the seer as it was possible to imagine&#146;  (Priestley, 99, 244&#150;61).<br>
<br>In 1928 Dunne married Cicely Marion Violet Joan, daughter of Geoffrey Cecil Twistleton-Wykeham-Fiennes, eighteenth Baron Saye and Sele, of Broughton Castle, Banbury, Oxfordshire. They had one son and one daughter. Dunne died on 24 August 1949 in Tracey House Nursing Home, Banbury.<br>
