<span class="headword">Beaton,  John</span>  (1831&#150;1930), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born at Hampstead, Middlesex, the second son of John Beaton, a Bank of England clerk, and his wife, Margaret. On 23 July 1863 Beaton married Jane Ann, daughter of Samuel Chard of the stock exchange; they had two daughters.<br>
<br>Beaton entered the City and trained as a banker. In 1862 he became secretary of the Anglo-Portuguese Bank at its foundation. In the following year this bank was absorbed by the London and Brazilian Bank, also set up in 1862. Beaton was appointed manager of the Porto branch but did not take up the post. Instead, he stayed in London as acting secretary, becoming secretary in 1870 and secretary and manager in 1872.<br>
<br>During these years the bank was critically tested, both by the Overend, Gurney collapse and by the mismanagement of its own staff in Brazil. For some five years, from August 1866, Beaton plied between London and Rio de Janeiro to assess the damage and reorganize activities on a more professional basis. The eventual solution was to reconstruct the company totally, writing off considerable capital, to the noisy dismay of certain shareholders.<br>
<br>The New London and Brazilian Bank, created in 1872, was firmly under Beaton's control. He beavered away to rescue something from the illiquid securities of the old company, and in the branches he instilled good banking practice, backed up by firm guidance and control from London. Above all, he strove to improve staff morale. Bonus payments, votes of thanks, a pensions and benevolent fund, and a career path for the ablest men leading from South America to London, instituted loyalty. In 1893, when the Rio branch was made so dangerous from shelling that staff attendance was declared voluntary, not a man stayed away.<br>
<br>Beaton steered the bank into Montevideo, and then into Buenos Aires by 1890. It was not, however, until 1902 that an agency was established at Man&aacute;os on the Amazon. By then a net profit of &pound;12,000 in 1872 had risen nearly eightfold. Beaton had become managing director in 1885, the year before the bank reverted to its old title by the omission of &#145;New&#146;. When the chairman, the Hon. Pascoe Charles Glyn, was ill in 1904, Beaton presided at the annual general meeting; the following year, after Glyn's death, Beaton took the chair in his own right at the age of seventy-four. He was now publicly accountable for the bank he had been effectively running for forty years.<br>
<br>Beaton increased the capital base in 1907 and 1912 and the bank became strong. Return on equity was relatively high (although a little weaker after 1913), while paid-up capital was matched or outpaced by published reserves. In 1912, the bank's jubilee year, Beaton was voted &pound;10,000 from shareholders and praised for his &#145;highest and best traditions of commercial morality&#146;  (AGM report, 1912). For the next nine years, until his ninetieth year, Beaton ran the bank by the same principles of paternalism and sound practice which had won such general respect. He became, as one shareholder put it, their &#145;grand old man&#146;  (AGM report, 1921), a patriarch whose knowledge and experience of South America were matchless and authoritative. He was of sufficient stature to be able to disagree publicly with Sir Edward Holden, eminent head of the Midland Bank, as to the diminishing world role of specialist overseas banks. He criticized over-banking in cities like Rio and Buenos Aires, where branches could &#145;be played off on each other by astute gentlemen of very small means&#146;  (AGM report, 1914). He maintained his conservative values. He saw strikes, particularly in Brazil, as organized by &#145;anarchic visitors&#146;  (AGM report, 1920) and thought the labour movement in Argentina had &#145;dictatorial pretensions&#146;  (AGM report, 1921). When Beaton resigned as chairman in 1921, in a crescendo of adulation, he was voted another &pound;10,000. He was impossible to replace and his bank merged with the London and River Plate Bank in 1923, to form the Bank of London and South America.<br>
<br>Beaton retired to Tunbridge Wells, and later to Folkestone, where he died at his home, The Lawn, 7 Godwyn Road, on 23 October 1930, in his one hundredth year. He was buried in Brompton cemetery, London.<br>
