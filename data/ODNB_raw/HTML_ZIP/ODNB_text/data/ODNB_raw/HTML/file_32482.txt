<span class="headword">Coillard,  Fran&ccedil;ois</span>  (1834&#150;1904), <span class="occ">missionary in Africa</span>, was born at Asni&egrave;res-les-Bourges, Cher, France, on 17 July 1834, the youngest of the seven children of Fran&ccedil;ois Coillard (<i>d</i>. 1836), at one time a prosperous yeoman, who also had a considerable dowry from his wife, Madeleine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dautry (<i>d</i>. 1875); both parents were of Huguenot descent. He was baptized in the temple at Asni&egrave;res on 5 October 1834. Two years later his mother was left a widow, and nearly destitute.<br>
<br>Coillard worked briefly as a ch&acirc;teau gardener before enrolling in the protestant school at Asni&egrave;res at the age of fifteen and later attending Strasbourg University. Inspired by revivalist preaching he offered himself in 1854 to the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Missions Evang&eacute;liques de Paris and became one of the first students at the recently opened Maison des Missions in Paris. After training under the veteran southern African missionary Eug&egrave;ne Casalis, he was ordained at the Oratoire in Paris in 1857 and assigned to the independent kingdom of Lesotho (Basutoland), where the society had been established since 1833. Coillard reached Cape Town on 6 November 1857 on the eve of a war between the kingdom and the Orange Free State which left the French stations in ruins. After the war he was assigned the task of opening a new station at Lerib&eacute; in territory governed by the king's son, Malapo. From the time of his arrival on 12 February 1859 Coillard struggled fruitlessly to reclaim the chief for the Christian religion he had abandoned as a boy. The task was not made any easier by Coillard's intolerant attitude towards deeply rooted local customs and mores.<br>
<br>Coillard's activities are graphically described in his journal and in letters which he wrote in large characters to his elderly mother, until her death in 1875. In Union Church, Cape Town, on 26 February 1861, he married Christina Mackintosh, whom he had first encountered in 1858 in Paris where she worked as governess to the children of a French protestant family. Five years his senior, she was the daughter of Lachlan Mackintosh, a Scottish Baptist minister, who was a friend and colleague of James Alexander Haldane and of Robert Haldane. At the age of fourteen Christina had become an enthusiast for missions after hearing the southern African missionary Robert Moffat preach in company with a young African girl. She became her husband's co-worker and shared the hardships of his travels throughout their marriage, which was childless.<br>
<br>By 1865 Basutoland was again embroiled in disputes with Boer farmers, not just in the Orange Free State, but also in Natal. In July Coillard assisted in successful negotiations between local chiefs and Natal's secretary for native affairs, Theophilus Shepstone. When invading forces from the Orange Free State forced the evacuation of the mission in April of the following year, Coillard moved to Natal, where he assisted the American missionaries by occupying one of their vacant stations until the proclamation of the British protectorate over Basutoland in 1868 permitted his return to Lerib&eacute;. In the same year he was commissioned to assess prospects for reoccupying a station near the headwaters of the Marico River which the French had abandoned twenty years before. He was warmly welcomed by Robert Moffat at Kuruman, who strongly encouraged a move to the north. An impulse in the same direction came from the Basutoland churches: by the mid-1870s they proposed to support a mission by their own evangelists to peoples across the Limpopo River who spoke closely related languages. After two of their expeditions were turned back by the government of the Transvaal Republic, Coillard was chosen to lead the third attempt.<br>
<br>The new party, which included Christina Coillard, four Sotho evangelists, and a niece, Elise Coillard, arrived in Pretoria in May 1877 to find the Transvaal annexed to the British crown under the governorship of Coillard's old acquaintance Theophilus Shepstone. After a hostile reception by the Shona chiefs in the south central region the party was forcibly conducted to Bulawayo, headquarters of Lobengula, king of the Ndebele (Matabele), who claimed suzerainty over the entire region. Prohibited absolutely from preaching in his domains, Coillard turned south-west to the territory of the Christian Tswana ruler, Khama, who suggested they might try their luck across the Zambezi with the Lozi kingdom, where the seSotho language of Basutoland was understood and spoken. Although they failed in their attempts to arrange a meeting with the recently elected Lozi king, prospects were encouraging enough for Coillard to convince the Paris Missionary Society to support him in an attempt to plant stations in that country.<br>
<br>Delayed by a trip to Europe (1880&#150;82) and complications in Basutoland, Coillard finally mounted his pioneering expedition to the Lozi kingdom (Barotseland) in 1884. He found the country in turmoil, the former king exiled, and a usurper on the throne. No sooner had he established friendly relations with the ruling party than another revolution brought the former king, Lewanika, back to power. Compromised by his initial diplomacy, it was not until March 1886 that Coillard was received by Lewanika at Lealui; from that time until 1891 he was engaged in establishing strong mission stations at Sesheke, Lealui, and Sefula. Lewanika enlisted the missionary's reluctant assistance in a plan to strengthen his shaky hold on the kingship by negotiating a British protectorate similar to the one which had recently been extended over neighbouring Bechuanaland. Misunderstanding the connections between the British crown and Cecil Rhodes's British South Africa Company, the king and Coillard were gradually entangled in a web of intrigue which resulted in assignment of all the Lozi kingdom to the company's domains on 27 June 1890. For a man of Coillard's limited political abilities the burden of serving as a diplomatic intermediary was severely trying, especially during the first seven years, during which the company failed to make any of its promised annual payments of &pound;2000 or to provide any of the educational assistance which it had pledged to Lewanika. Added to these worries were Christina Coillard's death on 28 October 1891, and a persistent high mortality rate among his staff, due primarily to tropical fevers. However, the lively and moving letters he directed to his society's offices in Paris made him a heroic figure to mission supporters in many countries. A great many of these were published in 1889 as <span class="italic">Sur le Haut-Zamb&egrave;ze: voyages et travaux de mission</span>. Updated to 1895 in a second edition of 1898, his letters also appeared in an English translation by his niece, Catherine Winkworth Mackintosh (<span class="italic">On the Threshold of Central Africa</span>, 1897).<br>
<br>After a serious illness in 1895, Coillard spent 1896&#150;8 in Europe; but by 21 February 1899 he was again at Lerib&eacute; on his way back to the Zambezi. However, a large number of fatalities ensued among the missionary recruits of 1897 and onwards, eight out of twenty-four dying and eleven returning home. Coillard was further shaken in 1903 by a breakaway movement of his converts, led by Willie Mokalapa. Coillard was still preaching at the upper Zambezi stations when he suffered a fatal attack of haematuric fever, at Lealui, in Rhodesia, on 27 May 1904; he was buried near his wife under &#145;the great tree&#146; at Sefula.<br>
<br>Coillard's right to recognition rests not so much on the number of his converts as on his pioneering work and diplomatic activity at crucial junctures in the history of Basutoland and modern Zambia. A short, keen-eyed, white-bearded man, his religious position was not strongly denominational. He acknowledged affinities with many strands of British evangelical nonconformity. As a result he found firm friends among the Congregational, Baptist, Calvinistic, and Methodist missionaries of southern Africa. He attempted in his own work to promote the aims enunciated by his idol, David Livingstone, as &#145;commerce and civilization&#146;. He pinned his hopes for the future on economic development and education, which he believed would provide the most secure foundation for African Christianity.<br>
