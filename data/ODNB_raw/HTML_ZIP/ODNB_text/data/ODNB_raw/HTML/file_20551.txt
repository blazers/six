<span class="headword">O'Donnell <span class="st"> [O'Domhnaill]</span>,  Daniel</span>  (1666&#150;1735), <span class="occ">army officer in the French service</span>, was born in Ireland, the son of Terence O'Donnell and Johanna O'Donnell, who both were from co. Donegal and belonged to the family of O'Donnell or O'Domhnaill chiefs in Tyrconnell. He was appointed a captain of foot in James II's army on 7 December 1688 and in 1689 was acting colonel. After the treaty of Limerick in 1691 he entered the French service but could obtain only the rank of captain in the marine regiment of the Irish brigade, commanded by Lord Henry FitzJames, grand prior of England, a natural son of James II, and brother of the duke of Berwick. O'Donnell, whose commission was dated 4 February 1692, served with this regiment, known as the &#145;r&eacute;giment de la marina&#146;, on the coast of Normandy during the projected invasion of England, which was averted by the French defeat in 1692 at La Hogue, and afterwards in Germany in the campaigns of 1693&#150;5. His regiment was reformed in 1698, and his commission as captain redated 27 April 1698. He served in Germany in 1701, and afterwards in five campaigns in Italy, where he was present at Luzzara, Borgoforte, Nago, Arco, Vercelli, Ivrea, Verrua, Chivasso, and Cassano; he was lieutenant-colonel of the regiment at the siege and battle of Turin.<br>
<br>Transferred to the Low Countries in 1707, O'Donnell fought against Marlborough at Oudenarde in 1708, succeeded Nicholas FitzGerald as colonel of a regiment on 7 August 1708, and commanded the regiment of O'Donnell of the Irish brigade in the campaigns of 1709&#150;12, including the battle of Malplaquet and the defence of the lines of Arleux, Denain, Douai, Bouchain, and Quesnoy. He then served under Marshal Villars in Germany, at the sieges of Landau and Freiberg, and at the forcing of General Vaubonne's entrenchments, which led to the treaty of Rastadt between Germany and France in March 1714. In accordance with an order of 6 February 1715, the regiment of O'Donnell was reformed, one half being transferred to Colonel Francis Lee's regiment, the other half to that of Major-General Murrough O'Brien, to which O'Donnell was attached as a &#145;reformed&#146; or supplementary colonel. He became a brigadier-general on 1 February 1719, and retired to St Germain-en-Laye, where he died, without any surviving children, on 7 July 1735.<br>
<br>A jewelled casket containing a Latin psalter said to have been written by the hand of St Columba belonged to O'Donnell, and was regarded by him, in accordance with its traditional history, as a talisman of victory if carried into battle. It was presented to the Royal Irish Academy in the nineteenth century.<br>
