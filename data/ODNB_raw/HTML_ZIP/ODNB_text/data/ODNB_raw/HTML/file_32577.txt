<span class="headword">Cory,  John</span>  (1828&#150;1910), <span class="occ">coal broker and philanthropist</span>, was born on 28 March 1828 at Bideford, the eldest of five sons of Richard Cory (1799&#150;1882), merchant, and Sarah, both of Bideford. The father was the owner and master of a small vessel in the coastal trade, and his decision in the 1830s to open a store as ship's chandler and provision merchant in Cardiff proved to be decisive in the family fortunes. In the early 1840s the business was moved to the new Bute Dock, and shipbroking and coal agency were added to its activities. The two elder sons, John and Richard, joined their father as shipowners, brokers, coal exporters, and colliery agents, trading first as Richard Cory &amp; Sons from 1856 and, when their father retired in 1859, as Cory Brothers &amp; Co. It was as coal exporters and shipowners that John and his brother were most directly involved in the business of the region, which was then growing fast enough to absorb their attention: they especially used their knowledge of freight rates and insurance to take over some of the financial risks from the colliery sales agencies. The firm's shipping and coal business steadily increased, and the universal demand for south Wales steam coal for navigation led John Cory to conceive the idea of establishing coal depots, offices, and agencies in all major overseas ports. One of the earliest was established at Port Said on the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. At the time of Cory's death the firm had acquired about a hundred of these depots, located on the maritime routes to India, China, South Africa, and South America, and was the leading supplier of steam coal for shipping. The firm also moved into coalmining. It acquired the Resolfen colliery and in 1869 the Pentre colliery in the Rhondda, and floated them in 1873 as the Cardiff and Swansea Smokeless Steam Coal Co. This led Cory into some financial difficulties: with the collapse of the coal boom in the early 1870s, there was a slump in share values and in 1875 there were even half-hearted accusations of fraud from disappointed shareholders. However, the company's fortunes revived and it was able to acquire the Gelli and Tynybedw collieries in the Rhondda (1884); Aber colliery (1893); Dunraven (1896); and Wyndham and Penllwyngwent (1906); and it took back direct control of Pentre and Resolfen (1894). In separate enterprises the two brothers also partnered their brother-in-law, Thomas Beynon, in promoting a profitable sale of shares in the Newport Abercarn Black Vein Steam Coal Co. in 1873 and, with other partners, sank the Penrikyber colliery in the Cynon valley between 1872 and 1878. John Cory was thus, from the 1870s on, a substantial coal owner; but although a member, he played no active part in the Coalowners' Association. He also played no direct role in the management of the collieries; instead he installed salaried managers and left himself free to exercise overall control over the company's activities from its Cardiff office at Oscar House, where a staff of more than 100 was employed by the time of his death, and where the day began with the partners and heads of departments meeting for prayer. In 1883 Cory became associated with other Rhondda coal owners to promote the Barry dock and railway. He afterwards held a large interest in that concern and became vice-chairman of its company. Although Cory Brothers was a limited company from 1893 entire control remained in the hands of the family; and John Cory served as chairman. The range of the productive and commercial interests of Cory Brothers in the coal trade gives credence to the claim that they were, before 1914, the largest private railway-wagon owners in Britain.<br>
<br>On 19 September 1854 Cory married Anna Maria (<i>d</i>. 1909), daughter of the Monmouthshire coal owner John Beynon, of Newport; they had one daughter and three sons. An alderman on Glamorgan county council and a long-serving member of the Cardiff school board, he was also an active philanthropist. Cory was one of the first to sign the pledge, and was one of Cardiff's leading advocates of teetotalism. However, although temperance and evangelical causes benefited particularly, his largess was not confined to these. In part the nature of the causes Cory supported reflected the family's religious shift (the father moved from the established church to the United Methodists, John became a Wesleyan, and his brother became a Baptist). During his lifetime, he funded a project for a garden village (Glyn-Cory) on his estate, provided Maendy Hall at Tonpentre for the Salvation Army, and financed the Cory Hall in Cardiff, which was opened on 9 September 1886 and was designated a temperance hall during the 1890s. This building, which was demolished in the 1980s, was characteristic of Cory's search to give his wealth useful public expression. At his death, Cory left more than &pound;798,777, and just as he had given consistently and lavishly during his life so he listed thirty-five separate legacies, totalling &pound;89,000, in his will. The largest was a &pound;20,000 bequest to the Salvation Army, in three separate donations for its foreign, general, and rescue work. Equally significant were gifts of &pound;1000&#150;&pound;5000 to home and foreign missionary societies, <span class="roman">Bible</span> societies, the YMCA, Cardiff Infirmary, orphanages, and sailors' rest houses in various ports. In his will Cory also requested that his children, as a matter of honour and affection to their father, give to charities at least 10 per cent of their income from his legacies&#151;an indication of the scale of his own practice.<br>
<br>Cory died at his estate at Dyffryn, St Nicholas, near Cowbridge, on 27 January 1910 only five months after his wife, Anna, had died; he was buried at the parish church at St Nicholas.<br>
