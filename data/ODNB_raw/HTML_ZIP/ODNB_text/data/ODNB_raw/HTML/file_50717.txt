<span class="headword">Townsend <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Jesse]</span>,  Lucy</span>  (1781&#150;1847), <span class="occ">slavery abolitionist</span>, was born on 25 July 1781, the daughter of William Jesse, a Church of England clergyman in West Bromwich, Staffordshire. On 6 July 1807 she married the Revd Charles Townsend (1780&#150;1865), rector of Calstone, Wiltshire, and perpetual curate of West Bromwich, Staffordshire; they had at least three daughters and three sons.<br>
<br>Charles Townsend was an anti-slavery campaigner, and his wife too became active in the movement. The Ladies' Society for the Relief of Negro Slaves (later the Female Society for Birmingham [etc.] for the Relief of British Negro Slaves, then the Ladies' Negro's Friend Society) was founded at a meeting held at her home in West Bromwich on 8 April 1825. Lucy Townsend and Mary Lloyd, whom she had met at meetings of the Bible Society, became joint secretaries of the society which was, from its foundation, independent of both the national Anti-Slavery Society and of the local men's anti-slavery society. It acted as the hub of a developing national network of female anti-slavery societies, rather than as a local auxiliary. It also had important international connections, and publicity on its activities in Benjamin Lundy's abolitionist periodical <span class="italic">The Genius of Universal Emancipation</span> influenced the formation of the first female anti-slavery societies in America.<br>
<br>Under Lucy Townsend's and Mary Lloyd's leadership the society developed the distinctive forms of female anti-slavery activity, involving an emphasis on the sufferings of women under slavery, systematic promotion of abstention from slave-grown sugar through door-to-door canvassing, and the production of innovative forms of propaganda, such as albums containing tracts, poems, and illustrations, embroidered anti-slavery workbags, and seals bearing the motto &#145;Am I not a woman and a sister?&#146;. The society was at the height of its influence during the 1823&#150;33 campaign against British colonial slavery, which culminated in the passage of the <span class="roman">Emancipation Act</span> in 1833. From 1839 it aligned itself with the newly formed British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, and combined support for the universal abolition movement with support for educational work among freed slaves; the society continued to be active until 1919. Lucy Townsend acted as joint secretary of the society until 1836, resigning this post when she moved with her husband to Thorpe, Nottinghamshire, but continuing as a committee member until at least 1845. She was the author of an anti-slavery pamphlet <span class="italic">To the Law and to the Testimony</span> (1832).<br>
<br>While anti-slavery was her main concern Lucy Townsend was also involved in a variety of other voluntary activities. With Mary Lloyd she established the Juvenile Association for West Bromwich and Wednesbury in Aid of Uninstructed Deaf Mutes in 1834, and she was also involved in Dorcas meetings, in the Ladies' Bible Association, and, with her husband, in campaigns to abolish bull baiting and other cruel sports.<br>
<br>Lucy Townsend was founder and co-secretary of the first women's anti-slavery society in Britain. Women's contributions to the anti-slavery movement in Britain received little attention from historians until the late 1980s, but their national significance and distinctive contributions to both the ideology and campaigning methods of the movement are now apparent. There are no known portraits of Lucy Townsend, despite the attempt by her friend and fellow campaigner Anne Knight to persuade her that, as &#145;the person who established woman agency&#146; in the movement and &#145;the chief lady&#146; of the anti-slavery campaign, she should &#145;in justice to history and posterity&#146; put herself forward for inclusion in B. R. Haydon's commemorative group portrait of the 1840 World Anti-Slavery Convention  (A. Knight to L. Townsend, 20 Sept 1840; Townsend, &#145;Autographs&#146;, MSS Brit. Emp.s., vol. 5, 102). She was described by her fellow anti-slavery campaigners as skilful in devising plans and prompt in their execution, as energetic and persistent, and as successful in stimulating others to action. Lucy Townsend died on 20 April 1847 at the rectory at Thorpe, near Southwell, in Nottinghamshire.<br>
