<span class="headword">Barbon,  Nicholas</span>  (1637/1640&#150;1698/9), <span class="occ">builder and economist</span>, was the son of the London leather merchant and sectarian politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1335/', "Praisegod Barbon (c.1598&#150;1679/80)")</script>, after whom the short-lived parliament of 1653 was nicknamed Barebone's Parliament. He was educated at the universities of Leiden and Utrecht, where he studied medicine, graduating MD at Utrecht in 1661. After returning to London he was admitted an honorary fellow of the College of Physicians in 1664 but soon gave up the practice of physic for more lucrative pursuits in the turbulent business world of his day.<br>
<br>A number of plans were put forward for building insurance in the aftermath of the great fire of 1666, with Barbon's &#145;Insurance office for houses&#146; the first to become operative after the issue in 1680 of a prospectus offering to insure up to 5000 homes in the city. Barbon became a key player in the rebuilding of modern London. The expansion and merging of the cities of London and Westminster, the need for rebuilding in the wake of the great fire, along with the growing concentration of wealth and population in the capital, led to a property and building boom facilitated by some innovations in the terms of mortgages and ground rents pioneered by Barbon. He played a leading role in the redevelopment of the Strand, linking the two ancient cities, and in the district of Bloomsbury. In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries London finally lost its medieval character and became an impressive modern city and world trading capital. Green fields were rapidly covered with modern housing and commercial architecture. Some interests opposed this recasting of the cityscape. Royal decrees and acts of parliament had been enacted between 1580 and 1602 prohibiting new building, and this policy was adopted under successive protectorate and Restoration parliaments, but Barbon bypassed or simply ignored the surviving legislation that had acted as a brake upon new construction. He was impervious to the conservatism of the crown and the majority of city dwellers, and this led to some bitterness and conflict, occasionally even violence. At times he was known to demolish homes and rebuild on the site without having first secured permission of the legal owner, and to face down any subsequent legal action.<br>
<br>In 1684 Barbon's workmen were involved in a stand-up fight against the lawyers of Gray's Inn, who were protesting over his plans to develop Red Lion Fields without official sanction. His skill as a builder lay, according to North, &#145;more in economising ground for advantage and the little contrivances of a family than the more noble aims of architecture, and all his aim was at profit&#146;  (North, 53). Poorly constructed vaults in his early buildings in Mincing Lane led to a disastrous collapse of foundations, but his reputation survived this setback. By these means he became a presiding influence upon the new architecture and land use of the city. His redevelopment of Red Lion Fields, the Temple, and the streets around what had been Essex House stand as his most noteworthy contributions to the rebuilding of London. He built his own grand home at Crane Court, Fleet Street, where he set up the centre for his dealings. He later acquired as a residence Osterley House on the Thames to the west of London.<br>
<br>His role as projector and speculator in the burgeoning economy of Restoration England aroused a good deal of hostile commentary in Barbon's own day and continues to contribute to a scurrilous reputation as a practised schemer and manipulator of men. North, who knew him personally and well, described him as a &#145;mob master&#146;, who knew amply &#145;the arts of leading, winding, or driving mankind in herds&#146;  (North, 53&#150;4). There can be no doubt that at times his practices were deliberately dishonest. An intimidating, argumentative, and combative figure, he was all but impervious to personal slights&#151;&#145;he would be called rogue, knave, damned Barbon, or anything, without being moved&#146;  (ibid., 54)&#151;and showed no signs of his father's religious enthusiasm. A fine and showy dresser, he lived in sumptuous style, partly in order to maintain social appearances and also to inspire confidence in his business schemes. A reckless speculator, known at times to overvalue his assets and the extent of his credit, some of his enterprises failed, leaving a trail of creditors and dissatisfied co-projectors making suit against him. At times he preferred to accrue debts in this manner and face drawn-out legal actions for recovery, sometimes setting one group of creditors against another, and deliberately delaying by complicating court actions, calculating this to be a cheaper means of obtaining credit than arranging conventional loans and paying interest. He was said to keep in his employ a team of clerks and lawyers specifically for these purposes. He was elected as member of parliament for Bramber in 1690 and 1695 after having bought a placeman's seat. He was thus able to claim parliamentary protection from prosecution and thereby frustrate some outstanding cases against him in the courts.<br>
<br>Barbon was also an innovator in economic theory. His early training as a physician was a factor in common with Sir William Petty and others of the seventeenth-century economists and political arithmeticians. He is considered by modern commentators to have propounded advanced views on free trade, the function of money, interest rates, and consumption. His <span class="italic">Discourse of Trade</span> (1690) argued that money had no intrinsic value. Rather it functioned symbolically as a means of facilitating exchange. He conducted debates with John Locke over the debasement of the coinage, and in favour of a legal reduction in the rate of interest in his <span class="italic">Discourse Concerning Coining the New Money Lighter</span> (1696). Barbon well understood that modern economic conduct was driven by desire and appearances as well as necessity:<blockquote>the use of most things being to supply the wants of the mind, and not the necessitys of the body; and those wants, most of them proceeding from imagination, the mind changeth; the things grow out of use, and so lose their value. (N. Barbon, <span class="italic">A Discourse of Trade</span>, 1690, 6)</blockquote>The fashion for frivolous luxury goods might then have beneficial consequences. Excess itself would spur trade, prodigality was a vice that was prejudicial to individuals, but not to trade, whereas covetousness was prejudicial to both men and trade.<blockquote>Fashion, or the alteration of dress is a great promoter of trade because it occasions the expense of cloths before the old ones are worn out. It is the spirit and life of trade; it makes a circulation, and gives a value, by turns, to all sorts of commodities; keeps the great body of trade in motion. (ibid., 65)</blockquote>He scorned the current classical nostalgia for the ancients in politics as neither Livy nor Machiavelli had taken due account of trade.<br>
<br>Barbon's economic theory was in many ways linked to and informed by his commercial activities. The roles of MP, builder, projector, and writer were all intertwined in practice. Among later schemes there was a plan for an orphans' bank and a plan to raise drinking water from the Thames. One of his last projects, the National Land Bank, aimed to raise funds secured on landed property and sought to compete with the newly established Bank of England. The bank received royal assent in 1696, but when Barbon was called upon in July of that year to provide financial support for overseas military operations, funds were found wanting and the bank folded soon after. Barbon wrote his will on 18 May 1698, giving instructions that his debts should be paid, especially that owing for his late wife's funeral. He probably died at Osterley House, Middlesex, later that year; his will was proved on 6 February 1699.<br>
