<span class="headword">Rawdon,  Marmaduke</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1610, <em>d.</em> 1669), <span class="occ">traveller and antiquary</span>, was baptized at St Crux Church, York, on 17 March 1610, the youngest son of Laurence Rawdon (1568?&#150;1626), a merchant and alderman of the city who was descended from a younger branch of the family of Rawdon, Yorkshire, and his wife, Margery Barton (1570?&#150;1644) of Cawton in the same county. He almost certainly attended St Peter's Grammar School in York. On the death of his father in 1626 he was adopted by his uncle Marmaduke (later Sir Marmaduke) Rawdon, a prominent London wine merchant.<br>
<br>From 1627 Rawdon was stationed at Bordeaux, where he dealt with his uncle's business and those of other wine merchants. In 1631 he was entrusted with the management of his uncle's affairs on the island of Tenerife, and he lived in the Canary Islands, principally at La Laguna, Gran Canaria, with brief intervals, for over twenty years. During this period he supervised the English factory established on the island and engaged in trade on his own account; he also ascended the peak of Tenerife.<br>
<br>In 1656, in consequence of England's rupture with Spain, Rawdon returned to England, and during most of the remainder of his life lived with his cousin and namesake Marmaduke Rawdon of Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire. His biographer describes how in the early 1660s he passed some of his time &#145;att home, for the most part in his closet reading or writinge, beinge naturally inclind to studdie&#146;  (Davies, 92). He compiled a number of commonplace books, journals, and accounts, among them a genealogical memoir of the Rawdon family and a history of cathedrals. In 1712 Ralph Thoresby was permitted to inspect the collection, and extracts from some of the manuscripts are made use of in his <span class="italic">Ducatus Leodiensis</span> (1715).<br>
<br>According to his biographer, Rawdon was as inclined to action as he was to study, &#145;followinge booth with some earnestnesse&#146;  (Davies, 196). He undertook many journeys. These were largely within England, but in 1662, for instance, with his cousin, he visited the Low Countries, recording his observations of Flemish and Dutch churches, gardens, hospitals, and trade. Rawdon did not completely neglect his mercantile activities in later life, and in the mid-1660s he was admitted a member of the short-lived Canary Company, in which he invested &pound;1500.<br>
<br>Rawdon died, unmarried, at Hoddesdon on 6 February 1669 and was buried, probably on 20 February, in the chancel of the church at Broxbourne. By his will he left to the corporation of York funds to enable the chief market place, the Pavement, to be enlarged, the gold &#145;poculum caritatis&#146;, or loving cup, and money to purchase the gold chain still worn at the close of the twentieth century by every lady mayoress of York.<br>
