<span class="headword">D'Oyly,  Christopher</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1717, <em>d.</em> 1795), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was baptized on 23 December 1717 in Banbury, Oxfordshire, the eldest son of Christopher D'Oyly (1682?&#150;1752) of Banbury, an attorney in the court of common pleas, and his wife, Susanna (<i>d</i>. 1758). There is no record of his early education, but he was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1741 and called to the bar on 5 June 1744. He sold his chambers in 1764, but it is said that he ceased to practise in 1754 on succeeding to an estate at Walton-on-Thames, Surrey  (Bayly, 64). On 2 December 1765 he married Sarah Stanley (1725&#150;1821), the younger daughter of George Stanley (<i>d</i>. 1734) of Paultons, Hampshire, and his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1764), and the granddaughter of Sir Hans Sloane. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Having been appointed first clerk in the war office in December 1761, D'Oyly was promoted to deputy secretary on 1 January 1763. His replacement as first clerk was Philip Francis, with whom he forged political links and a candid friendship. Both continued in post when Lord Barrington succeeded Welbore Ellis, D'Oyly's future brother-in-law, as secretary at war in 1765. On 21 December 1771 D'Oyly informed Francis that he had resigned, but offered no reason why. His departure was followed three months later by that of Francis, who quit the war office in circumstances that remain unclear. On appointment to the Bengal supreme council in 1773, Francis negotiated for D'Oyly to stand in for him at the next general election at Wareham, for which seat D'Oyly was returned in October 1774. D'Oyly maintained a regular correspondence with Francis in India about politics and family affairs. If the replies that he received were sometimes intemperate and occasionally graceless, he retained goodwill and equanimity towards his correspondent.<br>
<br>In May 1776 D'Oyly was appointed under-secretary in the colonial department and commissary-general of the musters, which drew him into planning the conduct of the war in America. A friend of the naval and military commanders Admiral Lord Howe and General Sir William Howe, he was dissatisfied by what he took to be the tepid support accorded them by his superior, Lord George Germain. He resigned abruptly on 6 February 1778, only days after the dispatch of a notice recalling Sir William Howe. In a letter to Francis he wrote: &#145;My reasons for giving up are many, but must not be trusted in a letter&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Sir Philip Francis</span>, 2.133).<br>
<br>D'Oyly declared his intention to retire from parliament in 1780. Following the dissolution in September, Lord North offered him a deal by which he would become comptroller of army accounts in exchange for the commissary-general, which North required for a sitting member of parliament. D'Oyly declined the offer but then changed his mind about leaving parliament, and was returned for Seaford on 4 December 1780. He finally retired from parliament and public life in 1784.<br>
<br>For much of his official life D'Oyly's London home was in Mayfair, first in Charles Street and from around 1779 in Curzon Street. He enjoyed Twickenham as a retreat, and there he became a friend of Horace Walpole. D'Oyly was frequently in demand as a family lawyer. Besides acting as an attorney for Francis during his absence in India he fulfilled the same function for Henry Strachey. He was an executor to Clive's will, adviser to his widow, Margaret Clive, and cleared up Charles Townshend's financial affairs after his death in 1767. More administrator than politician, D'Oyly made no impact in the house; indeed, he is not recorded as having spoken.<br>
<br>D'Oyly died at Twickenham on 19 January 1795 and was buried on 27 January at St Mary's Church, Walton-on-Thames. Sarah D'Oyly long outlived him, and died on 28 November 1821, aged ninety-five. A marble monument in St Mary's Church by Sir Francis Chantrey commemorates both D'Oyly and his wife, who, as a widow, was among the sculptor's first patrons. D'Oyly is well characterized in the inscription, which eulogizes &#145;his professional abilities &hellip; ever exercised in acts of humanity, in allaying animosities, in composing differences&#146;.<br>
