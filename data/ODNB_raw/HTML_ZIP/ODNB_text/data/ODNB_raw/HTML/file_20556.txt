<span class="headword">O'Donnell,  Manus</span> <span class="st"> [Maghnus &Oacute; Domhnaill]</span>, lord of Tyrconnell  (<em>d.</em> 1563), <span class="occ">chieftain</span>, the eldest of fourteen sons of Sir Hugh O'Donnell, lord of Tyrconnell (<i>d</i>. 1537), and his first wife, a daughter of O'Boyle of Boylagh. Manus is known to have had four wives: Siobh&aacute;n, daughter of O'Reilly, chief of East Breifne (married later to Maguire, lord of Fermanagh), and mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20550/', "Calvagh O'Donnell, lord of Tyrconnell")</script>; Joan (<i>d</i>. 1535), sister of Conn Bacach O'Neill and mother of Sir Hugh, lord of Tyrconnell; Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1544), daughter of Angus Macdonald of the Isles, from whom he had separated by 1538; and Eleanor, sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9555/', "Gerald Fitzgerald, ninth earl of Kildare")</script>, and widow of Donal MacCarthy Reagh of Carbery, whom he married about June 1538. That he was also married to a daughter of Maguire is most improbable. Besides Calvagh and Hugh, Manus had at least six other sons: Niall Garbh, Donough, Rory, Caffar, Manus &Oacute;g, and another Manus, and seven daughters: Rose, Sheila, Evelyn, Mary, Fionnghuala (wife of Sir C&uacute; Chonnacht Maguire and mother of Sir Hugh, killed in 1600), Grace, and Joan.<br>
<br>Manus's grandfather (who was chieftain between 1461 and 1503) and father had broken O'Neill supremacy in the north of Ireland, and had established effective control over lower or northern Connaught. The lordship of Tyrconnell (or T&iacute;r Conaill; later co. Donegal), controlling the coast from Broadhaven to Lough Foyle, exchanged fish for wine, salt, iron, and munitions. Breton and Spanish traders knew Manus in his day as &#145;king of fish&#146;. In his father's absence abroad (1510&#150;12) Manus defended Tyrconnell against O'Neill. Father and son then campaigned vigorously in both Connaught and T&iacute;r Eoghain (Tyrone), and in 1514 O'Neill formally acknowledged O'Donnell's rights to the tributes of Cin&eacute;al Moain (the modern barony of Raphoe), Inishowen, and Fermanagh. Conn Bacach, the new O'Neill, renewed the fighting, and Manus built a frontier castle at Lifford in 1527. The castle had its refinements, as the poet Tadhg Dall &Oacute; Huiginn tells us; and Manus gathered here a number of scholars, who in 1532 completed <span class="italic">Betha Colaim chille</span>, a life of the great Cen&eacute;l Conaill saint, Columba. It was a document for the times, a rich fusion of classical hagiography and folklore. Manus himself was a poet, composing syllabic verses, now tender, now satirical, but the claim that he composed the life &#145;out of his own mouth&#146; may suggest no more than that he had the work read to him as it proceeded, and with his poet's ear gave approval or criticism.<br>
<br>His brother Hugh Boy was now challenging Manus for the succession, and the divisions within Tyrconnell allowed O'Connor Sligo in 1533 to win back Sligo Castle, held by O'Donnell since 1516. This weakened O'Donnell domination of the west. Sir Hugh, unable to call on the help of these two sons for a foray on Connaught, found it best in 1535 to surrender to the king half the tributes of lower Connaught and half the cocket of Sligo. But his threat to attack O'Neill was sufficient to deter the brothers-in-law Manus and Conn Bacach (whose wife was sister to the ninth earl of Kildare) from going to the aid of Silken Thomas.<br>
<br>Death took Sir Hugh in 1537, and Manus was inaugurated O'Donnell. He now made attacks on Connaught and in 1538 won back Sligo Castle. The same year he assumed the leadership of the Geraldine league, about June marrying Eleanor Fitzgerald, the guardian of her nephew Gerald. The alliance of Irish and Anglo-Irish lords feared for their autonomy and were urged on by &#145;the friers and preestes of all the Yrishtree, not oneley of Odownelles country&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 3.141, n. 1), preaching a religious war. The resentment provoked by Henry VIII's reforms that had been one of the factors motivating the earlier Kildare rebellion was now grown greater. Manus sent out pleas to the papacy, the empire, France, and James V, and in 1539 O'Neill and he ravaged the pale and made a symbolic appearance at Tara. Though mauled by Grey in Monaghan on their way home, the allies were back again in the pale in 1540. But Eleanor, now distrustful of Manus, carried Gerald off to France; and in 1541 Manus, splendidly dressed for the occasion, submitted at Cavan to the politic St Leger, accepting Henry's sovereignty and supremacy, at least on paper. His reward for accepting the status of tenant-in-chief under the crown was to receive in absolute ownership the territory of Tyrconnell (certain rights <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> MacWilliam Burke also being accorded to him). This was the conciliatory policy of &#145;surrender and regrant&#146;. Grateful for his bringing in O'Neill, the administration in 1543 accepted his overlordship of Inishowen, to the disappointment of O'Neill, now earl of Tyrone.<br>
<br>Manus had nominally lost his absolute independence. But now, in place of usufruct of certain lands, Tyrconnell was his in absolute ownership, to be transmitted to his son by law of primogeniture. He might also claim the protection of the crown. There now began a period of diplomatic chess between Manus and the government. O'Donnell listened to overtures from France, England's enemy, and in 1545 secured ratification of his rights over Inishowen. But he yielded up the episcopal revenues he had seized on the death in 1543 of the papal bishop of Raphoe, facilitating continuation of the Roman succession with the appointment of Art O'Gallagher as bishop in 1547. The government, on the other hand, favoured Manus's rebellious son Calvagh, to whom Bellingham in 1549 awarded Lifford Castle, with extensive adjoining lands. Manus was allowed Castle Finn, but his brother Conn, as tanist, was also given a large estate. Manus again turned to France, but after the peace between Henri II and Warwick (March 1550) could only write to disclaim practice of treason. He was now elderly and ailing, and Calvagh made him captive in 1555. Hugh had gone over to Shane O'Neill, and would not help. But when Shane attacked Tyrconnell in 1557, Calvagh turned to his father, by whose advice he was able to drive Shane off. Then in 1561 Shane, O'Neill since 1559, kidnapped Calvagh.<br>
<br>With Tyrconnell leaderless and at a low ebb, Manus died &#145;in his own fortress of Lifford&#146;, say the four masters, on 9 February 1563, and was interred at the Franciscan friary founded by his grandparents in Donegal. The erosion of the independence of the Gaelic lords had begun before his day, and England, with its increase in armed might, was able to take advantage of the weaknesses of the Gaelic system, its competition for power, and its feuding between states. He had, however, done something to adumbrate a national programme for future Irish leaders, which would have religion for a cement and which would seek to exploit an English weakness, susceptibility to attack from the continent through its back door, Ireland. If unable to restrain the rebels within his own family, he had established the rule of Tyrconnell in his own line, and all its remaining lords would be his descendants. And his support of Bishop Art O'Gallagher was of consequence in ensuring that the Reformation would make no progress in his territory during the sixteenth century. He was <i>ilcherdach</i> (&#145;many-skilled&#146;), say the four masters: man of action and diplomat, with a taste for finer things, including literature. An older contemporary of Manus might have said that he possessed <i>virt&ugrave;</i>.<br>
