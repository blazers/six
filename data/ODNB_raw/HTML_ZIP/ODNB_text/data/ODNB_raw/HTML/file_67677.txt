<span class="headword">Women's section of the Air Transport Auxiliary</span>  (<em>act. </em>1940&#150;1945)<span class="occ"></span> was a civilian organization that came into existence, after several false starts, on 1 January 1940. Its members' male counterparts&#151;experienced pilots who were ineligible for service with the RAF&#151;had been employed very soon after the outbreak of war, initially using requisitioned Tiger Moths to transport mail, medical supplies, and civilian dignitaries, but before long ferrying the larger and more sophisticated aircraft being developed for the RAF from factory to airbase. But, while many women had participated in the flying craze of the 1930s or had in 1938 taken advantage of the government's Civil Air Guard scheme to learn to fly at subsidized rates, the question of whether they too should use this experience and knowledge in a wartime context was highly contentious. The editor of <span class="italic">The Aeroplane</span> was not alone in believing that &#145;the menace is the woman who thinks that she ought to be flying a high-speed bomber when she really has not the intelligence to scrub the floor of a hospital properly&#146;  (Curtis, 12).<br>
<br>That the women's section of the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA) overcame this opposition so completely, growing to a strength of 166 pilots who between them flew every possible kind of aircraft except flying boats, under exactly the same conditions as their male counterparts, was due to the determination, skill, and persistence of some of the early members of the organization and in particular of their senior commander, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62318/', "Pauline Gower (1910&#150;1947)")</script>. A highly experienced professional pilot, her position as the only female member of the committee on the control of flying (established in 1938 to examine the regulations governing flight) had afforded her a potentially useful introduction to some of the men who would shortly oversee the use of aircraft in war. When war was declared, therefore, on 3 September 1939, she lost little time in proposing that women should be able to join the newly formed ATA, and held out against opposition from senior figures in the Air Ministry until in November she secured authorization to recruit the first all-woman ferry pool, to be based at Hatfield. If the scope and terms of this fledgeling women's section were a disappointment&#151;just eight women, who were restricted to flying Tiger Moths and were paid 20 per cent less than their male counterparts&#151;then Gower was prepared to bide her time. Acutely aware, as were all the first recruits, that the slightest mistake risked stalling the expansion of the organization, her tact and judgement were impeccable, and through a series of patiently anticipated and perfectly timed interventions she succeeded in securing for her ever-growing pool of pilots a degree of formal equality of terms and conditions unmatched by any other wartime organization. In May 1940 she negotiated a small increase in numbers and the opportunity for the most experienced to take conversion courses to fly all types of non-operational aircraft. It was to be another year, however, before the most significant breakthrough&#151;the agreement, in July 1941, that women should be allowed to fly operational planes&#151;and by the end of the war they had flown everything from fighter planes such as the Spitfire to the huge Halifax and Lancaster four-engined bombers. Not only that, but from May 1943 they also received equal pay for their trouble.<br>
<br>All ATA pilots were required to fly without radio or other navigational aid bar visual contact with the ground, and ferry trips could routinely involve circumnavigating the balloon barrage around a heavily defended factory to deliver a plane hundreds of miles away to a new and often camouflaged airfield consisting of little more than a strip of grass. Furthermore, successful completion of a conversion course for a generic type of aircraft meant that they were required to fly, sight unseen, any model that came within that specification with no more introduction than that afforded by the ATA handling notes that every pilot carried and that listed the idiosyncrasies of the 140 different types of aircraft that they might be called upon to fly. In order to maximize time and available flying personnel each ferry pool's schedule of flights was drawn up and co-ordinated centrally by the operations officer and her team of ground crew, who sought to ensure not only that the maximum number of planes were successfully delivered to their destinations but that pilots were retrieved at the end of a day's ferrying by an ATA &#145;taxi&#146; flight and delivered back to base.<br>
<br>The celebrated &#145;first eight&#146;, who joined the ATA on 1 January 1940, were all extremely experienced pre-war pilots and qualified flying instructors, and most were to become the backbone of the women's section. Youngest of the group was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67664/', "Joan Hughes (1918&#150;1993)")</script>, who had become Britain's youngest qualified pilot at the age of seventeen and claimed that she would go without food and water rather than not fly. Having worked as an instructor for the Civil Air Guard she concentrated on instructing as the ATA expanded, but as well as being the only woman to instruct on all types of aircraft she clocked up an impressive ferrying tally and was one of only eleven women to convert to four-engined bombers. Winifred (Winnie) Crossley, dashing and convivial, had worked for five years towing advertising banners and performing stunts with an air circus. Once in the ATA she broke important new ground when she was given the onerous and hugely significant task of being the first woman to fly an operational aircraft, and she too went on to convert successfully to four-engined bombers. Another four-engined bomber pilot was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60744/', "Marion Wilberforce (1902&#150;1995)")</script>, who combined the flying necessary to complete that conversion with successful leadership as second in command and then commanding officer of the ferry pools at Hatfield and, later, Cosford. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68165/', "Rosemary Theresa Du Cros, n&#233;e Rees (1901&#150;1994)")</script>, a former ballet dancer, most closely resembled the stereotypical wealthy private pilot of the 1930s. She, too, successfully combined administrative authority, as second in command of Hamble ferry pool, with conversion to four-engined bombers. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67665/', "Margaret (Margie) Fairweather (1901&#150;1944)")</script> had over 1000 hours' flying experience, mostly gained touring Europe in her own plane, and was also instructing for the Civil Air Guard before the war. Quiet and self-effacing but an exceptionally able pilot, she too was one of the first to fly operational planes and later to convert to four-engined bombers. Tragically she was also the only one of the first eight not to survive the war when, on 4 August 1944, her plane suffered engine failure and she crash-landed.<br>
<br>Another early recruit was also one of the sixteen members of the ATA women's section who lost their lives during the war. This was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34200/', "Amy Johnson (1903&#150;1941)")</script>, arguably Britain's most famous and most experienced female pilot, killed on 5 January 1941 when her plane crashed into the Thames. Notable among the third wave of recruits, who joined in June and July 1940, was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67670/', "Margaret Wyndham Gore (1913&#150;1993)")</script>, who in 1938 had taken a part-time job in Smithfield market to finance flying lessons. Less experienced than most of the early arrivals, she was nevertheless a brilliant natural pilot who successfully converted to four-engined bombers, and as commanding officer of the women's pool at Hamble was a wise, calm, admirably efficient, and extremely popular leader.<br>
<br>The ATA flag was lowered for the last time on 30 November 1945. The pilots of the women's section had proved themselves faithful to the ATA motto, <i>Aetheris avidi</i> (&#145;eager for the air&#146;), but, as many were to find, neither their eagerness nor their experience was a passport to a career in aviation in the post-war climate. Pauline Gower, to whom the women's section of the ATA owed so much, tragically died giving birth to twin sons in 1947. That the members of the ATA women's section largely remain the forgotten pilots of the Second World War is no true reflection of her achievement or that of the remarkable organization that she led with such inspiration and force.<br>
