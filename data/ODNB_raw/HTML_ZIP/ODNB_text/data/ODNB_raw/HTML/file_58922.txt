<span class="headword">Nicholls,  Horace Walter</span>  (1867&#150;1941), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born on 17 February 1867 at Post Office Terrace, Cambridge, the eldest son of Arthur Nicholls, photographer, and his wife, Charlotte Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Johnson, both from Norfolk. Arthur's father was John Nicholls, of Newnham Grove, Grantchester, architect and restorer of historic buildings. In 1879 Arthur moved to the Isle of Wight, where he had a studio at 17 High Street, Sandown.<br>
<br>By the age of fourteen Horace Nicholls was his father's apprentice, and about 1884 he was apprenticed to a Huddersfield chemist. About 1887 he worked in Chile, but returned to England about 1889 and joined the Cartland Studio in Windsor as a photographic assistant. In 1892 he went to Johannesburg and joined James F. Goch's studio in Pritchard Street. He returned in 1893 and married, at Windsor on 11 October, his former employer's cousin Florence (<i>b</i>. 1866/7), eldest daughter of George Holderness, baker, of Peascod Street; they had two sons and three daughters. They went to Johannesburg where Nicholls became manager of the Goch studio. With his usual hyperbole and self-promotion, Nicholls called himself &#145;the Johannesburg Photographer&#146;. He prospered and was joined by his brother Stanley (<i>d</i>. 1970), who became a leading South African photographer. Nicholls did portraits and local scenes, including the races, and also &#145;tricks&#146; learned from his father: composite printing, multiple exposures on one negative, and photomontage. He published two small albums, <span class="italic">Johannesburg</span> (1896) and <span class="italic">Stirring Events in Johannesburg, 1896</span>.<br>
<br>In 1899, during the opening phase of the South African War, Nicholls was photographer for the London-based weekly <span class="italic">South Africa</span>, accredited as a war correspondent. He went to Ladysmith and photographed battle and scenes in the town. He escaped by the last mail train before the siege, then was in Natal and Cape Colony. Despite the competition he sold to British publications including the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, <span class="italic">The Graphic</span>, <span class="italic">Navy and Army Illustrated</span>, and <span class="italic">With the Flag to Pretoria</span>. He brought his family back to England, where he arrived on 30 December 1899. In the following spring he gave lectures in London and the provinces, gaining press publicity, and privately exhibited his photographs to Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein. In May he photographed the men of the <i>Powerful</i> at Windsor Castle. Leaving his family behind, he returned in June to South Africa, where he photographed in the Orange River Colony and Transvaal. At Pretoria he interviewed and photographed Lord Roberts who, according to Nicholls's publicity, &#145;complimented Mr. Nicholls on his work&#146;  (Buckland, 122). In September 1900 he returned to England, where he published some of his photographs in <span class="italic">Uitlanders and Colonists who Fought for the Flag, 1899&#150;1900</span> and others as <span class="italic">Memorable Incidents and Striking Features of the South African Campaign: a Series of Historic Pictures</span>, carbon prints priced at between one half and two guineas and advertised as intended to &#145;appeal to the artistic sense of the most fastidious&#146;  (undated prospectus, H. W. Nicholls file, IWM), which continued profitable for years after the war. In June 1901 he and his family returned to South Africa. The war established him as a known photographer, with useful London contacts. He was briefly manager of Davies Bros. Studios in Johannesburg, but he and his family finally returned to England in August 1902.<br>
<br>Working from his suburban home, 9 Amherst Avenue, Ealing, with his studio at the top, Nicholls was a freelance photojournalist, a self-styled &#145;press photo artist&#146;, doing his own developing and printing, and selling to the London press. He photographed events of the social season and other scenes of Edwardians, rich and poor, at play&#151;the Derby, Ascot, Henley, Lord's, the Eton wall game, Goodwood, Cowes, the Riviera, Chamonix&#151;with strong, sometimes dramatic images of individuals and crowds, including young women sea-bathing. He sometimes used a camera so designed that his subjects did not know they were being photographed. He made photomontages, transposing persons and backgrounds: he added numerous umbrellas to his photograph of a wet Derby day. He charged 10<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. or 21<i>s</i>. per photograph, depending on size and subject, and gained a comfortable middle-class income. Publications to which he contributed included <span class="italic">The Times</span>, <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, <span class="italic">The Graphic</span>, <span class="italic">Black and White</span>, <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span>, <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, <span class="italic">Penny Pictorial</span>, <span class="italic">The Bystander</span>, <span class="italic">The Tatler</span>, <span class="italic">The Referee</span>, <span class="italic">Sphere</span>, <span class="italic">Sunday Companion</span>, and <span class="italic">South Africa</span>.<br>
<br>By the First World War Nicholls was middle-aged. He wanted to be a war photographer at the front but was not accepted. Offering his services to Wellington House, the British overseas propaganda headquarters, in 1916 he wrote that &#145;the chief aim of my work in Photography is pictorial effect in preference to photographing anything and everything&#146;  (letter to Ivor Nicholson, 7 September 1916, H. W. Nicholls file, IWM). He worked briefly as a National Service Department substitution officer in Hounslow. From 1917 he was an official photographer of the Department (later Ministry) of Information, taking photographs of the &#145;home front&#146; for &#145;propagandist purposes&#146; in the United States and elsewhere; some were supplied to the British press. His subjects included army recruits, working women, munitions factories, shipbuilding, and J. L. Garvin and other leading newspaper editors. His wartime photographs were among his finest, though presenting &#145;the official view of the Home Front&#146;  (Carmichael, 63). His own elder son, George Arthur Nicholls (1894&#150;1917), was killed on the western front in April 1917.<br>
<br>In March 1917 the war cabinet announced the formation of a national war museum. One of the latter's subcommittees assembling material was the women's work subcommittee, chaired by Lady Norman, which decided to compile a &#145;series of photographs for record purposes&#146;  (Griffiths, 4) of women's &#145;substitution&#146; of men workers. In August 1918 Nicholls and another Ministry of Information photographer, G. P. Lewis, were seconded to the subcommittee, and for it photographed working women. Nicholls covered mostly the London area. In 1919 the subcommittee ended. Nicholls stayed on at the Imperial War Museum, heading its darkroom and responsible for its collection of negatives, including his 2300 of the home front. He photographed scenes at the museum and, for its collection, London war memorials. While employed there he also did freelance photography for newspapers and journals, though inferior to his earlier work. In 1936 he moved to 7 Trent Road, Worthing, Sussex, and died there, of diabetes, on 28 July 1941. His photographs have since been much reproduced in various books, though his &#145;tricks&#146; necessitate their use with caution as historical sources. Cecil Beaton used his photographs when designing for <span class="italic">My Fair Lady</span>. His younger son, Sidney (1907&#150;1977), became an actor, known as Anthony Nicholls.<br>
