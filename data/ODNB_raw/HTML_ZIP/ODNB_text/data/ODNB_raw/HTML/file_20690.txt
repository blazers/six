<span class="headword">Oldham,  John</span>  (1779&#150;1840), <span class="occ">artist and mechanical inventor</span>, was born in Dublin. He served an apprenticeship to an engraver at a calico printing works in Dublin but subsequently pursued a career as an artist. While based at Newry he also developed his interest in mechanics. He invented a machine for individually numbering banknotes to prevent forgery and, in 1812, laid his plans before the Bank of Ireland. In 1814 he was appointed as full-time artist to the bank, and signed over his rights to the invention. His son <a href="#cosubject_20690">Thomas Oldham [<i>see below</i>]</a> became his apprentice and assistant in 1816, succeeding to his father's position in 1836. Between 1836 and 1840, in the service of the Bank of England, John Oldham made further improvements to the machinery for printing and numbering banknotes, which effected considerable savings in manpower. The machinery continued in use until 1852&#150;3, when a system of surface printing was adopted.<br>
<br>Oldham took a keen interest in marine propulsion, obtaining in 1817 a patent for propelling ships by means of paddles worked by steam engine, an attempt to imitate the normal motion of a paddle. In 1820 he patented an improvement, the paddles being revolved about a shaft placed across the ship and feathered by an adaptation of the gearing used in the original patent. Though very imperfect, the contrivance was used in the <i>Aaron Manby</i>, the first seagoing iron ship to be constructed. A further development of the idea resulted in the construction of a feathering paddle-wheel, patented in 1827. His combined system of warming and ventilating buildings, by circulating preheated, filtered, and purified air through the space to be heated, was introduced into both the Bank of Ireland and the Bank of England.<br>
<br>Enjoying a large salary, with the right of a reversion of a portion to his son, Oldham was celebrated for his convivial powers. He died, of an internal haemorrhage, at his house in Montague Street, Russell Square, London, on 14 February 1840.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_20690"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Oldham</span>  (1801&#150;1851)<span class="occ"></span>, the eldest of John Oldham's seventeen children, succeeded to his father's position as artist to the Bank of Ireland, where he became involved with the engineering aspects of the machinery employed to print banknotes. He was elected associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in March 1841. In 1842 he read a paper to the institution &#145;On the introduction of letterpress printing for numbering and dating the notes of the Bank of England&#146;, and the following year one entitled &#145;A description of the automatic balance at the Bank of England invented by W. Cotton&#146;, for which he received a Telford medal. He died at Brussels on 7 November 1851.<br>
