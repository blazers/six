<span class="headword">Ross <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>McKittrick; <em>other married name </em>Rodgers]</span>,  Anna Margaret <span class="st"> [Amanda]</span></span>  (1860&#150;1939), <span class="occ">novelist and poet</span>, was born on 8 December 1860 at Drumaness, co. Down, Ireland, the fourth child of Edward Amlave McKittrick, principal of Drumaness high school, and his wife, Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Black. Both parents came from farming stock, and were married in the parish church at Magheradroll, co. Down, on 1 February 1856. Their daughter was baptized Anna Margaret, although she later claimed that her mother named her Amanda Malvina Fitzalan, after the heroine of <span class="italic">The Children of the Abbey</span> (1798), by Regina Maria Roche. Her biographer Jack Loudan suggests, in <span class="italic">O Rare Amanda</span> (1954), that she adopted her pen-name, Amanda Ros, because she knew of an ancient co. Down family called de Ros. She had a tendency to aggrandizement.<br>
<br>Amanda McKittrick was apparently educated at home until the 1880s, when, during her teacher training at Marlborough College, Dublin, she was appointed monitor at Millbrook national school, Larne, where she returned to teach after qualifying. On 30 August 1887, in Carrickfergus, she married Andrew Ross (1849/1850&#150;1917), the Larne stationmaster, &#145;whose genial manner and exemplary courteousness are widely known&#146; (according to her second novel, <span class="italic">Delina Delaney</span>, 1898).<br>
<br>Andrew Ross became stationmaster at Larne Harbour, receiving those visiting celebrities who crossed from Stranraer. His wife extolled his dignity in this elevated role, but his working hours were long. She had ample time for reading Marie Corelli's <span class="italic">The Sorrows of Satan</span> (1895), re-reading <span class="italic">The Children of the Abbey</span>, and writing <span class="italic">Irene Iddesleigh</span> (1897). <span class="italic">Irene Iddesleigh</span> and <span class="italic">Delina Delaney</span> established her ambiguous reputation. She worked sporadically on a third novel, <span class="italic">Helen Huddleson</span> (published posthumously in 1969 with a final chapter by Loudan), but between 1898 and 1926, when the Nonesuch Press edition of <span class="italic">Irene</span> appeared, she issued only the splenetic <span class="italic">Poems of Puncture</span> (1912) and some broadsheet verses.<br>
<br>Ross became a cult figure after Barry Pain reviewed <span class="italic">Irene</span> as &#145;the Book of the Century&#146;: &#145;it sits alone as the nightingale sings&#146;  (<span class="italic">Black and White</span>, Feb 1898). An Amanda Ros club was formed by those who delighted in her &#145;magnificent incongruities&#146;, her apparently uncontrollable use of alliteration, and the ridiculous effects she unwittingly produced. Her unlikely correspondents included Aldous Huxley, R. H. Tawney, E. V. Lucas, Siegfried Sassoon, William Beveridge, and several noble lords and ladies. Her plots were conventional&#151;orphan heroines and all-conquering love&#151;but her equivocal fame sprang from the richness of her rhetorical flights and headlong plunges into bathos.<br>
<br>Amanda Ross thought that words meant what she chose them to mean, however eccentrically juxtaposed: as she said in a letter, &#145;My works are all my own, pleasingly peculiar&#146;. Aldous Huxley, in &#145;Euphues redivivus&#146; (1923), described her style as &#145;the result of the discovery of art by an unsophisticated mind&#146;  (Huxley, 137). Although his essay is a model of ironic assessment, other contemporary critics were less diplomatic, and Amanda&#151;a doughty fighter and extremely litigious&#151;expended much time after 1926 in reviling them in prose and verse. &#145;&#147;At home&#148; always to the honourable&#146;, as her visiting card proclaimed, she was irresistibly impelled to respond vigorously&#151;often coarsely&#151;to her antagonists. The butt of masculine ridicule, like Margaret Dumont and Florence Foster Jenkins, she stoutly maintained a sense of her own undoubted powers; and while a reader may delight in her verbal incongruities, the enthusiasm behind them is undeniable. <span class="italic">Irene</span> is a tragic tale, betrayed by the innocent ambition of its teller, as both Sassoon and Tawney recognized.<br>
<br>Unable to resist any challenge, when Andy Ross retired Amanda converted part of their home into two shops to boost their reduced income; for a time she also managed a limekiln, whose bequest to her by the owner resulted in a five-year legal battle with his family. She worked indomitably on the vituperative &#145;Six months in hell&#146;, her uncompleted diatribe against clergymen, lawyers, critics, and other infringers of her own idiosyncratic Presbyterian code.<br>
<br>Andy Ross died in August 1917, and on 12 June 1922 Amanda Ross married Thomas Rodgers (1857/1858&#150;1933), a prosperous farmer in co. Down who died shortly after her last poems were published (<span class="italic">Fumes of Formation</span>, 1933: &#145;the ingenious innings of inspiration and Thorny Tincture of Thought&#146;). She died at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast on 2 February 1939.<br>
