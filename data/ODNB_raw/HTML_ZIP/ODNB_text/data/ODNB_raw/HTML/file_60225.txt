<span class="headword">Taylor,  George  Crosland</span>  (1858&#150;1923), <span class="occ">bus company operator</span>, was born on 31 January 1858 at Greenhead Lane, Huddersfield, Yorkshire, son of Henry Dyson Taylor, woollen manufacturer of Huddersfield, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Crosland. George Taylor and his sons all took Crosland as part of their surname. At the age of sixteen George went to work at his father's mill, and in his early twenties travelled to Australia on his father's business. With his brother James he formed the British Insulated and Helsby Cable Company in 1882. On 8 October 1884 he married Mary, daughter of William Radford, at Kirk Langley in Derbyshire.<br>
<br>By the turn of the century Crosland Taylor, who was essentially an electrical engineer, was taking an interest in motor cars. At the Paris motor show of 1905 he met Georges Ville, and on his return he started to assemble and sell cars of Ville's design, hence his adoption of the trading name Crosville for his company. Only five Crosville cars were ever made, but the company, registered in 1906 at Crane Wharf, Chester, went in for car hire, sales, driving tuition, and a range of automotive activities. In 1910 it acquired an Albion charabanc, with which it started a bus service between Chester and Ellesmere Port.<br>
<br>Crosland Taylor's eldest son, Edward, played only a small part in company affairs before emigrating to America in 1911. Edward's brother <a name="cosubject_60224"></a><span class="headword">Claude  Crosland Taylor</span>  (1889&#150;1935)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born on 28 September 1889 at Ravenscar, Helsby, Cheshire, did not complete his engineering course at Liverpool University, perhaps due to Edward's departure; he took over the running of the company, and by 1914 had brought it into profit. Some expansion took place during the war years, centred on the munitions factory at Queensferry, while by 1915 a service to Crewe justified opening a depot at Nantwich. The company also undertook haulage and tractor-drawn ploughing at that time.<br>
<br>George Crosland Taylor's youngest son, <a name="cosubject_60225"></a><span class="headword">Winthrop James  Crosland Taylor</span>  (1894&#150;1967) (always known in the industry as W. J. Crosland-Taylor), was born at Ravenscar in 1894. He embarked on an engineering course at Liverpool University but did not return from military service to complete his degree. He served in the Royal Navy and the Royal Marines and was awarded the Military Cross, a very rare achievement for a sailor. He joined Crosville in 1919 to help his brother and father run the company in a period of rapid expansion that continued throughout the 1920s, including numerous acquisitions&#151;an unusual policy at that time.<br>
<br>George Crosland Taylor suffered a heart attack and died at his home, 20 Castle Street, Chester, on 12 January 1923. His wife survived him. Claude succeeded him as chairman of the company, devoting his long working hours to its development. It was to his efforts that Crosville Motor Services owed its success, as the memoirs of his younger brother make plain. It remained a family business, with George's widow and his brother on the board, until the four main line railway companies in 1928 obtained powers to run buses, and early the next year the London, Midland, and Scottish Railway (LMSR) made an offer for the company's share capital. Despite other offers, the two brothers advised the board to accept the sum of 27<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per share, and from 1 May 1929 the company became L.M.S. (Crosville).<br>
<br>The shareholders made a good profit on the deal, and Claude and his brother, with all the staff, were kept on by the new owners. Railway money was used for the purchase of other businesses, &#145;out of all proportion to their value&#146;, according to W. J. Crosland Taylor. Then, as a result of the settlement reached between the Tillings and British Electric Traction interests and the railway companies, from 1 May 1930 the company reverted to its original name, but was jointly owned by the LMSR and Tillings and British Automobile Traction. Claude remained as managing director, the board being chaired by W. S. Wreathall.<br>
<br>The Crosland Taylor family did not limit its activities to buses: George had been a magistrate from 1899 until his death, and was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society; Claude was mayor of Chester in 1925. Both were men who pushed themselves to the limit. Claude died on 31 March 1935 at the Westminster Nursing Home, Liverpool Road, Chester, having succumbed to peritonitis, after an appendix operation. He was survived by his wife, Hilda Nancy. His memorial service was held in Chester Cathedral.<br>
<br>With route licensing now in place, Crosville was established as the dominant bus company in much of Cheshire, throughout north Wales, and down the coast as far as Cardigan, as well as on the Wirral and in south Lancashire. Express coach services complemented the bus operations. W. J. Crosland Taylor inherited this as general manager, remaining in office until 31 December 1959. He died of heart failure at Twyford Abbey, Ealing, London, on 4 October 1967. His period of office saw control of the business pass to Thomas Tillings in 1942, and then to the British Transport Commission in 1948. Yet it is true to say that Crosville Motor Services, based at Chester, was one of the great territorial bus companies. It remained in some sense a family business, so long as members of the Crosland Taylor family were in charge&#151;even when the chairmanship was in the hands of men such as John Spencer Wills (1904&#150;1991) and Sir Frederick Heaton (1880&#150;1949).<br>
