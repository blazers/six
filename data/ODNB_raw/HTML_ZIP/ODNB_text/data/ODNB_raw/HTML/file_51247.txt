</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Maclay,  John Scott</span>, Viscount Muirshiel  (1905&#150;1992), <span class="occ">businessman and politician</span>, was born on 26 October 1905 at 13 Park Terrace, Glasgow, the youngest child in the family of five sons and two daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34779/', "Joseph Paton Maclay, first Baron Maclay (1857&#150;1951)")</script>, shipowner and public servant, and his wife, Martha (<i>d</i>. 1929), daughter of William Strang, muslin manufacturer, of Glasgow. His father was chairman of Maclay and McIntyre, shipowners, a friend of Andrew Bonar Law, and a very successful controller of shipping under Lloyd George during the First World War. Of his four brothers, the two eldest, Ebenezer (1891&#150;1918) and William (1895&#150;1915), were killed in action during the First World War; the third, Joseph (1899&#150;1969), was Liberal MP for Paisley from 1931 to 1945, and succeeded his father as second Baron Maclay and chairman of Maclay and McIntyre; the fourth, Walter (1901&#150;1964), was an eminent psychiatrist and sometime honorary physician to the queen.<br>
<br>John Maclay was educated at Winchester College and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was in the crew that beat Oxford in the 1927 boat race, before joining the family shipping firm. On 16 October 1930 he married Betty L'Estrange Astley (1902&#150;1974), younger daughter of Major Delaval Graham L'Estrange Astley, of Wroxham, Norfolk. There were no children of the marriage. On the outbreak of the Second World War he served briefly as a captain in the 57th Searchlight regiment of the Royal Artillery, before being seconded to the Ministry of War Transport and sent to Washington as deputy to Sir (James) Arthur Salter, head of the British merchant shipping mission there. He succeeded Salter as its head in 1944, and was gazetted CMG in the same year.<br>
<br>Maclay had been elected unopposed as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96340', "Liberal National")</script> MP for Montrose Burghs in July 1940, and on his return from Washington he was briefly parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Production in Churchill's &#145;caretaker&#146; ministry of May&#150;July 1945. Following the Labour victory in the general election of that year he kept largely to commercial life, serving as chairman of the British committee of the international chamber of commerce from 1947 to 1951, but he also took part very effectively in Commons debates on shipping and trade. After the abolition of the Montrose Burghs constituency he stood successfully as National Liberal and Conservative candidate for West Renfrewshire, which he represented for the next fourteen years. Between 1957 and 1967 he was president of the National Liberal council (the National Liberals had six Scottish MPs), a not utterly fictive role in view of his preference for consensual policies. In October 1951 Churchill made him minister of transport and civil aviation, without a seat in cabinet, but his health was poor and a crisis over increased fares for London transport in May 1952 brought about his resignation. He served briefly as president of the assembly of the Western European Union in 1955&#150;6 (and later expressed regret that Britain had not played a more constructive role in the early stages of European integration) before returning to office under Sir Anthony Eden as minister of state for the colonies in October 1956. While there, he was (albeit briefly) closely involved in formulating the British response to developments in Cyprus and Ghana.<br>
<br>In January 1957, on replacing Eden as premier, Harold Macmillan appointed Maclay secretary of state for Scotland in place of James Stuart. A shy personality and somewhat quavering delivery made him an unobtrusive presence as secretary of state, yet he presided tactfully over a considerable expansion in the capabilities of the post. He later recollected of his time in office that &#145;Secretaries of State were now being judged by the performance of the Scottish economy&#146;, with traditional British departments such as the Board of Trade being regarded as marginal. Stuart, a friend and confidant of Churchill, had not regarded industry as a priority, though he developed the social and infrastructural responsibilities of the Scottish Office in response to the nationalist pressure of John MacCormick's covenant movement and the Balfour commission of 1953&#150;5. But, as an inquiry by Alexander Cairncross had disclosed in 1953, the country's economy was still archaically dependent on the traditional capital goods and textile industries. Already suffering from under-investment, these industries were thrown into crisis both by the post-Suez depression and by the technical changes enforced by the canal's closure: giant tankers and containerization. Macmillan himself took a direct interest in the country which had produced his publishing forebears, and made common cause with leaders of Scottish business, notably Lord Polwarth of the Scottish Council (Development and Industry) and George Middleton, general secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress. National policy on developmental assistance was still, however, determined by unemployment levels, not by entrepreneurial potential, and in real terms less was being spent on industrial policy than twenty years earlier. Urgency was underlined by the general election of October 1959, in which&#151;against the British trend&#151;the right-wing vote in Scotland fell from 51.1 per cent to 47.2 per cent and seats from 36 out of 71 to 31.<br>
<br>This disaffection was tackled by Macmillan, now with Cairncross as his chief economic adviser and his former assistant and ghost writer Allan Young as Board of Trade controller in Scotland, by sweeping moves of industrial direction in the steel and automotive industries. In 1959 came the decision&#151;against the advice of the industry's leaders&#151;to site a new integrated steelworks and strip mill at Ravenscraig, near Motherwell, and in 1960 Macmillan followed this with his <span class="roman">Local Employment Act</span>. As a result, Maclay joined with the Scottish council to create a committee on future strategies for Scottish industry, under J. N. Toothill, managing director of Ferranti's Scottish operation. As well as the co-ordination of regional development bodies and a shift towards the encouragement of diversified industries based on &#145;growth points&#146; in the new towns, the Toothill report (substantially drafted by the committee's secretary, Dr Tom Burns, later professor of sociology at Edinburgh) recommended &#145;a new department which should bring together the present industrial and planning functions of the Scottish departments&#146;. Accordingly in 1962 the Scottish Office changed from having, besides agriculture and fisheries, a home department, and a health department, to a new structure of an &#145;economic&#146; development department plus a &#145;social&#146; home and health department. This was to cope with the opening of the Ravenscraig strip mill and two motor plants&#151;Rootes Cars at Linwood, near Paisley, and British Motor Corporation Vans at Bathgate&#151;which were seen as inaugurating a new era of Scottish consumer-goods manufacturing. Counsels were fatally divided, however, between the advocates of diversification and the remaining heavy industrial magnates, who favoured a huge littoral steel-and-ships development on the Clyde estuary. Nobody then realized how useful the latter course would have been in coping with the challenge of North Sea oil.<br>
<br>Despite considerable achievements, including the initiation of construction of the Forth and Tay road bridges, the inauguration of Scotland's first nuclear power station, and of the Glasgow redevelopment plan, important measures of rating reform, improvements to hospitals, the licensing laws, and the fishing fleet&#151;and the fateful decision in the <span class="roman">Housing (Scotland) Act</span> of 1957 to encourage high-rise building with a special subsidy of &pound;40 per flat, which revolutionized, if it did not exactly improve, the Scottish urban landscape&#151;Maclay came under increasing criticism. In 1961 the inquiry of Dr Beeching into the railway network was under way, with its recommendations likely to involve extensive line closures in rural Scotland. The railway modernization programme of 1955 had singularly failed to save Scotland's greatest railway manufacturer, the North British Locomotive Company, chaired by Viscount Reith; it went under in 1961. In 1962 Maclay was in confrontation with the miners and the Labour Party over the National Coal Board's plans to close twenty pits over a four-year period (he secured a favourable price-hike for otherwise uneconomic Scottish coal, but this did him little good) and with the teaching profession (once a pillar of the Scots bourgeoisie but now going swiftly left) over pay. Wishing to spend more time with his wife, who was now confined to a wheelchair, he offered his resignation early in 1962, but was persuaded to stay on. Then on 13 July 1962, along with a third of the cabinet, he was axed. Macmillan replaced him with Michael Noble, MP for Argyll, to little avail. Despite the remarkable popularity of Macmillan's successor, Sir Alec Douglas-Home, the number of Scottish tory MPs fell to twenty-four in 1964 and twenty in 1966.<br>
<br>In 1962 Maclay was made a Companion of Honour, like Walter Elliot and Tom Johnston before him. He went to the Lords in 1964 as Viscount Muirshiel of Kilmacolm, and became a knight of the Thistle in 1973. Between 1967 and 1980 he was lord lieutenant of Renfrewshire. He occupied his retirement from politics as a director of the National Provincial Bank, the Peninsular and Oriental Steamship Company, and the Clydesdale Bank, and also as a trustee of the National Galleries of Scotland (1966&#150;76) and founder chairman of the Scottish Civic Trust (1967&#150;89). He received honorary degrees from the universities of Edinburgh (1963), Strathclyde (1966), and Glasgow (1970). He died of heart failure at his house, Knapps Wood, Kilmacolm, Renfrewshire, on 17 August 1992. His wife predeceased him. A memorial service was held at Kilmacolm Old Kirk on 16 September 1992. Of his well-meant projects, the Linwood and Bathgate motor works were closed in 1981, and Ravenscraig steelworks were closed in 1992.<br>
<br>Maclay's career was enigmatic. From occupying only minor office&#151;and without enjoying any great success in it&#151;he became, during his five-year tenure of the Scottish secretaryship, the essential creator of the institution as it was to preside over Scottish affairs between then and the creation of a Scottish parliament forty years later. A modest and unpretentious man, he was motivated by a strong sense of public duty, and was described by a former parliamentary private secretary as &#145;the most saintly character I knew in politics&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 Aug 1992).<br>
