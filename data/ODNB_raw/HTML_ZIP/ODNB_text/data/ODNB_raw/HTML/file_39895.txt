<span class="headword">Gibbs, Sir  Humphrey Vicary</span>  (1902&#150;1990), <span class="occ">farmer and colonial administrator</span>, was born on 22 November 1902 at 9 Portman Square, London, the third son and sixth and youngest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47518/', "Herbert Cokayne Gibbs, first Baron Hunsdon of Hunsdon (1854&#150;1935)")</script>, merchant banker, and his wife, Anna Maria (1862&#150;1938), fourth daughter of Richard Durant, of High Canons, Hertfordshire. The Gibbs family was wealthy and well connected in the City of London, which at various times his grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33386/', "Henry Hucks Gibbs, first Baron Aldenham")</script>, and his uncle Alban George Henry Gibbs, second Baron Aldenham, represented in parliament. His brothers Walter Durant Gibbs, fourth Baron Aldenham, and Sir Geoffrey Cokayne Gibbs were notable bankers in the City.<br>
<br>Gibbs was educated at Ludgrove preparatory school, Eton College (where he was head of Pop), and Trinity College, Cambridge, which he left after a year to pursue training courses in various branches of agriculture. In 1928 he emigrated to Southern Rhodesia, where he purchased a 6000 acre farm near Bulawayo. He gained a reputation for progressive farming and formed the Rhodesia National Farmers' Union. Regarding soil and wildlife conservation as a matter of great urgency, he successfully campaigned for a national resources board. On 17 January 1934 he married Molly Peel Nelson (1912&#150;1997), second daughter of John Peel Nelson, businessman, of Bulawayo. They had five sons.<br>
<br>In 1947 Gibbs was invited to stand for parliament as a member of Sir Godfrey Huggins's ruling United Party and was elected as member for Wankie. He was not a natural parliamentarian: Huggins remarked that he was &#145;far too honest&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Although he later quipped that his only parliamentary contributions had been to say &#145;Hear, hear&#146;, he spoke significantly on the creation of national parks and a maize levy on European farmers to assist in developing African agriculture. He retired from parliament in 1953, but retained the chairmanship of the United Party until 1959. He refused to become involved in a plot to make him leader of the Liberal Party, choosing farming and several directorships in leading Rhodesian firms over party politics. Strongly involved in supporting the development of the Anglican church in Central Africa, and of European and African education, he helped in 1939 to found the Cyrene mission near Bulawayo, which became famous as a centre for African arts and crafts. He played a leading role in founding Peterhouse and Mizeki College, and developed an enthusiastic interest in multiracial schooling. For many years he chaired the Beit Trust, which provided funds to causes throughout the federation.<br>
<br>In 1959 Gibbs accepted the post of governor of Southern Rhodesia, the first &#145;Rhodesian&#146; so appointed. Tall, charming, strikingly handsome, and regarded as &#145;above party&#146;, he was thought of as ideal for the post. The governorship of Southern Rhodesia, a self-governing colony, was largely ceremonial, resembling the role of a dominion governor-general, rather than the governorship of a dependency, even if its prerogatives were theoretically extensive. Invariably the governor acted on the advice of his prime minister. Gibbs felt constitutionally bound, for example, to authorize Sir Edgar Whitehead's controversial <span class="roman">Law and Order Maintenance Act</span> (1960). Following the Rhodesian Front's electoral victory in 1962, his speeches from the throne reflected the growing cabinet hostility towards what it regarded as British duplicity in withholding independence. In May 1963 he also became acting governor-general of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, overseeing the final details of its dissolution. He exercised his constitutional right to warn when he attempted unsuccessfully to persuade his prime minister, Winston Field, to face down his extremist critics within the Rhodesian Front. Ian Smith, who succeeded as prime minister, however, pledged to gain independence under white minority rule, if necessary through an illegal unilateral declaration of independence (UDI).<br>
<br>From the outset Gibbs seemed somewhat unassertive in his dealings with Smith. In April 1965, on the qualified advice of the chief justice, he granted Smith a dissolution even though parliament had two years to run. This was one area where he had more authority than a dominion governor-general. The British government, moreover, reaffirmed its policy of non-intervention in the colony, so that he had no alternative advice on which to rely. Unconventionally, when he met the opposition leader, David Butler, to ascertain whether he could form a government in the event of Smith resigning, both the chief justice and Smith were present at the interview. The Rhodesian Front went on to a crushing election victory. UDI now seemed certain, a crisis for which Gibbs was politically ill equipped. While legality lasted, he felt constitutionally obliged to follow Smith's advice by authorizing a state of emergency on 5 November 1965, even though it presaged UDI, which followed on 11 November. The British government immediately reaffirmed Gibbs's position as the only lawful authority in the rebel colony, although he himself would have preferred to retire to his farm. He dismissed the cabinet, which cut off his salary, household utilities, telephone, official car, and police escort. He refused a salary from Britain, used a public telephone box to contact Whitehall, and continued to hold court at Government House in defiance of Smith. The regime denounced him as a fellow traveller of the British Labour Party, because his loyalty to the sovereign was now effectively routed through the Commonwealth relations secretary and Wilson. Gibbs's influence was minimal, since civil servants and the security forces were encouraged to remain at their posts. The regime installed a rival officer administering the government, claiming to continue to govern in the name of the queen of Rhodesia, whom it distinguished from Wilson's constitutional instrument. Gibbs's peculiar position was encapsulated in his advice to Sam Putterill, the army commander, in 1966: &#145;Sam, you had better open Parliament, for not to do so would be a confrontation. But don't appear as if you are enjoying it!&#146;  (Flower, 82).<br>
<br>Gibbs accompanied Smith to the abortive negotiations on board <i>Tiger</i> in 1966 and <i>Fearless</i> in 1968, and in 1969, following Smith's decision to declare a republic, he was allowed to retire to his farm. Having been appointed OBE in 1959, KCMG in 1960, and KCVO in 1965, he was promoted GCVO and sworn a privy councillor on retirement. Parliament later awarded him &pound;66,000 compensation for some of the costs incurred following UDI. He received honorary degrees from the universities of Birmingham and East Anglia, both in 1969. As a founder of the multiracial organization People against Racial Discrimination he campaigned unsuccessfully for accepting the Anglo-Rhodesian settlement proposals of 1971. Although vindicated by the lawful independence of Zimbabwe in 1980, as a traditional monarchist he had no natural enthusiasm for a republic which now denied the queen the allegiance he had championed. In 1983, following a gun attack on his wife's car by a deranged employee, and with widening government repression in Matabeleland, he decided to retire to Borrowdale, Harare, where he died on 5 November 1990, after a short illness. He was survived by his wife, Molly, who had been made DBE in 1969 in recognition of her charitable work, and by their five sons. A memorial service was held in the chapel of the Order of the British Empire, St Paul's Cathedral, on 15 January 1991.<br>
