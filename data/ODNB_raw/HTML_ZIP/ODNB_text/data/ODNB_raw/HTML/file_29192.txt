<span class="headword">Wheler, Sir  Francis</span>  (<em>c.</em>1656&#150;1694), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the youngest son of Sir Charles Wheler, second baronet (<i>c</i>.1620&#150;1683), of Birdingbury, Warwickshire, and his wife, Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1684), daughter of Sir Francis Bindloss, of Borwick Hall, Lancashire. The Whelers had sold their original Worcestershire estates in the early seventeenth century, and Francis's grandfather became a goldsmith. His father had been a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, before service in the royalist army during the civil war led him to court, parliament, and the governorship of the Leeward Islands under Charles II. Francis was himself clearly well educated, to judge from his elegant handwriting. He joined the navy as a &#145;king's letter&#146; (volunteer) officer thanks to his family's cavalier loyalties: as was usual he was primarily a soldier, but he quickly developed an aptitude for the sea service to which he was repeatedly seconded. On 22 October 1674 he was commissioned ensign in Prince Rupert's company in the garrison at Windsor Castle. His naval promotion was owed chiefly to Admiral Herbert (later Lord Torrington), who on 30 April 1678 appointed him second lieutenant of the <i>Rupert</i>. On 5 May 1679 he was promoted first lieutenant in the same ship, and on 6 April 1680 he transferred to the <i>Bristol</i> as first lieutenant.<br>
<br>On 11 September 1680 Wheler was given his first command, the <i>Nonsuch</i>. While his ship was careening at Gibraltar in February 1681 he wrote to his father asking for assistance in his regimental and naval careers; he looked shortly to &#145;try [his] fortune with the Argerins&#146; (BL, Add. MS 28054, fol. 208; Davies, 239). Success duly came with the seizure of a corsair on 8 April. On 10 August at Tangier he took possession of the <i>Kingfisher</i> by Herbert's commission, and brought her back to Portsmouth in October 1682. On 26 January 1683 he was promoted captain in the army. On 25 August he was appointed to the <i>Tiger</i> to assist with the evacuation of Tangier, where he arrived on 29 September. Pepys, who was also present during the last months of the English occupation, met Wheler several times and heard others tell of his notable obsequiousness to Herbert, allegedly performing menial tasks for him, and owing his place to his being so much &#145;privy to things&#146; that the admiral &#145;durst not but oblige&#146; him  (<span class="italic">Tangier Papers</span>, 118). Since Pepys also reported what he must have known to be a wholly false complaint that Wheler had been made captain without having served as lieutenant, his other comments invite little respect. Wheler clearly made himself useful to his admiral, but Herbert would not have been impressed by mere servility.<br>
<br>Wheler returned to England, not without mishap, by the end of March 1684, after spending the best part of six years in the Mediterranean. In June 1685, as captain of the <i>Tiger</i>, he was active in intercepting Dutch ships running munitions to Monmouth's rebels. On 12 November he married Arabella, daughter of Sir Clifford Clinton. By 3 June 1687 he had been knighted, and on 12 June he was promoted lieutenant-colonel of foot. On 18 September 1688 he was made captain of the <i>Centurion</i>. This ship was badly damaged in an accident at sea and needed to return to Chatham, an embarrassment compounded by a large-scale desertion of the crew. The king was reported to be angered by the mishandling of the ship, but Wheler escaped censure and was transferred to the command of the <i>Kent</i> on 16 November. In the course of the revolution immediately following, Wheler's associations with Herbert and the duke of Grafton (now his military commander) aligned him with the Orangists, and his career was secured under the new regime. In April 1689 he was given command of the <i>Rupert</i>, and during the summer he successfully intercepted a number of French ships taking arms and dispatches to the Jacobites in Ireland. On 5 January 1690 he was appointed to the <i>Albemarle</i> (90 guns), which fought at Beachy Head (30 June). In August he was shortlisted for a flag: this was not yet to be his, but on 20 December he was given the captaincy of Deal Castle.<br>
<br>Meanwhile the English colonies in the West Indies waited anxiously for the strong naval force they required for protection and, if possible, for assault on the French islands. In July 1691 James Kendall, governor of Barbados, had urged that the command be given to &#145;a gentleman of good sense, well affected, and a seaman&#146;, suggesting that Wheler fitted this profile  (<span class="italic">CSP col.</span>, 13.498). The recommendation was accepted, and in October Wheler's instructions were drafted: he was due to go to the Caribbean in April 1692, but only a small squadron under Robert Wrenn could be sent that year. Wheler remained in home waters, and commanded the <i>Albemarle</i> at La Hogue in May. In July, still afloat, he submitted a vast twenty-seven-point proposal for revising the instructions for his West Indies command, particularly asking to be independent of the colonial governments, and for a defined share of plunder ashore. The latter was conceded by assigning a detachment of 400 soldiers to his personal command. He also stressed the need for adequate medical facilities, in line with what would be the most positive outcome of the current war. The privy council approved his instructions on 18 October. Attacks were envisaged on Martinique and Hispaniola; to this the king added the extraordinary order that on his way home Wheler should call in and annex Canada. At the same time Wheler was designated rear-admiral of the blue, effective from 6 February 1693. Having made his will on 30 October, with the provision that if his fortune were increased by &pound;500 or more this should go to his younger son, he joined his fleet at Cowes on 21 December.<br>
<br>Wheler sailed on 9 January 1693 aboard the <i>Resolution</i>, accompanied by ten other warships, together with supports, and carrying about 1500 soldiers. They reached Barbados on 28 February/1 March, and on 3 March Wheler was sworn of the island council. A message was sent to Christopher Codrington, governor of the Leewards, to rendezvous off Martinique. Wheler left Barbados on 30 March and arrived at Cul de Sac Marine, Martinique, two days later. While reinforcements were awaited some successful raids were made ashore. Codrington arrived on 9 April, and an assault on the fort of St Pierre was begun on 17 April. On the 20th, however, a council of war decided to abandon the attempt, only Wheler and another officer arguing for continued naval bombardment. On 22 April they withdrew to Dominica, where a further council rejected an assault on Guadeloupe. By this time Wheler's forces were severely depleted by an infection caught at Barbados, and he sailed to the healthier climate of St Kitts to recover as best he could. Since leaving England he had already lost almost 700 men. The campaigning season was now virtually over; his orders were to quit the Caribbean before the rains at the end of May, and as soon as he had regrouped he sailed north.<br>
<br>By 12 June Wheler reached Boston, to find that the governor of Massachusetts, Sir William Phips, was wholly unprepared for his arrival; the projected attack on Quebec was therefore abandoned. Wheler was understandably keen to hurt the French somewhere, and Phips suggested that Newfoundland might be the place to do so. But when Wheler actually proposed an attack, Phips discovered a string of constitutional and practical reasons for withholding his own forces. His concern in fact was to prevent what remained of Wheler's men from becoming a burden on his own colony. Wheler therefore sailed homewards on 22 September, and arrived at Portsmouth on 18 October. There was much anger that so carefully prepared an expedition had achieved nothing, but Wheler's leadership was not held accountable. He was immediately re-engaged, being appointed commander in the Mediterranean on 1 November, ranking as rear-admiral of the red. He sailed on 27 December and arrived at Cadiz on 19 January 1694. On 17 February he left to pass through the straits, but on the night of the 18th met a hurricane off Malaga. In the confusion several of his ships ran aground in Gibraltar Bay. Wheler's flagship, the <i>Sussex</i>, struck at 5 a.m. on 19 February, with the loss of all but two Turks from the complement of 550. It was consequently never possible to establish the precise circumstances of the accident or of Wheler's death. The disaster seemed to confirm suspicions already voiced about the inherent instability of 80-gun ships with only two decks, such as the <i>Sussex</i>, and a third deck would be added for new ships of this armament.<br>
<br>Wheler was survived by his wife, his eldest son, Charles (who died soon afterwards), his younger sons William and Francis, and his daughter Anna Sophia. Among his executors were Sir Cloudesley Shovell and his kinsman William Binckes, dean of Lichfield. Wheler was a gallant and competent officer, and it cannot be reckoned his fault that his career achieved little, and ended in calamity.<br>
