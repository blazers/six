<span class="headword">Smith,  (Ellen) Marion  Delf-</span>  (1883&#150;1980), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born on 31 January 1883 at 6 Capel Road, East Ham, Essex, the daughter of Thomas William Herbert Delf, an insurance secretary, and Catherine Mary <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bridges. She was educated at James Allen's Girls' School, Dulwich, and attended Girton College, Cambridge, on several scholarships. At Girton she earned a first class in both parts of the natural sciences tripos, and was joint winner of the Montefiore prize in 1906, her final year. Originally planning to stay at Cambridge to study plant physiology with F. F. Blackman, she instead accepted an offer to teach botany at Westfield College, University of London.<br>
<br>At this time Westfield College offered only elementary and intermediate level courses in science, so students wishing to obtain the BSc degree had to complete their courses elsewhere. Delf's appointment was part of a deliberate attempt by the college to upgrade its offerings in at least one scientific subject, botany. When she arrived she found no money for equipment or assistance in the college's attic laboratory, and a botanical collection consisting of &#145;eight or ten bottles with bits of plants, mostly in very poor condition&#146;  (Sondheimer, 62). She also encountered a strong evangelical religious tradition, exemplified by the college's principal, Constance Maynard. Delf challenged Maynard on the religious question, refusing to attend the principal's divinity lectures, and insisting on teaching her students about the theory of evolution. In spite of these obstacles, Delf was able to raise money to purchase equipment and obtain specimens. In 1910 the University of London approved the Westfield laboratory to prepare students for the final BSc pass examination in botany and granted Delf the status of a recognized teacher of the university. The college was recognized to prepare students for honours degrees in botany in 1915.<br>
<br>During this period Marion Delf also managed to continue her own research, begun so promisingly at Cambridge. Between 1911 and 1916 she studied the transpiration of plants, the process by which plants excrete water, particularly the morphology of <i>Ulvaceae</i> or seaweeds, publishing her results in four papers in the <span class="italic">Annals of Botany</span>. In 1912 she was awarded the London DSc degree for a thesis based on original research, as well as the Gamble prize from Girton for an essay entitled &#145;The biology of transpiration&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1914 Delf was granted a Yarrow fellowship from Girton to work on transpiration in evergreens. Her fellowship was interrupted, however, by war work. From December 1916 to January 1920 she was a research assistant at the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine in London. As a member of a team led by Dr Harriet Chick she investigated the vitamin content of foods as pertaining to the rations of the military. In 1920 she went to South Africa as a temporary research fellow attached to the Institute of Medical Research, Johannesburg, where she continued this line of research, investigating the vitamin C content in the diets of local mine workers, &#145;as a result of which their health was substantially improved&#146;  (<span class="italic">Girton College Newsletter</span>, 32). She was offered a chance to remain permanently in South Africa, but rather reluctantly chose to return to Westfield, when she learned that a new laboratory had just been built for her.<br>
<br>Marion Delf was to remain at Westfield for the rest of her career. She was appointed a university reader in 1921, and became head of the Westfield botany department in 1939. In 1928 she married Percy John Smith, an etcher and book illustrator, from which time she was generally known as Delf-Smith. She moved with him to Haverstock Hill in Hampstead, remaining at Westfield as a non-resident lecturer. Percy Smith died in 1948, the year of his wife's retirement.<br>
<br>Delf-Smith was a life member of the British Association, a fellow of the Linnean Society, a member of the South East London Botany Society, the South East Union of Scientific Societies, and the Association of Women Science Teachers, and served on the advisory algae committee of the Scottish Seaweed Organization. Her interests were, however, by no means narrow. She shared with her husband a love of drawing and gardening, serving as the Westfield garden steward after her retirement. She became devoted to the college, serving on its council and as head of the alumnae association. In 1955 she was elected an honorary fellow, a distinction rarely given. Believing that the job of a teacher was to &#145;at least awaken the desire amongst students to follow some line of investigation for themselves&#146;  (Sondheimer, 62), Delf-Smith taught many students who went on to have scientific careers, including her Westfield colleagues Violet Grubb and Alison Westbrook. She died in the Royal Free Hospital, Camden, on 23 February 1980.<br>
