<span class="headword">Fricker,  Peter Racine</span>  (1920&#150;1990), <span class="occ">composer and music teacher</span>, was born on 5 September 1920 in Ealing, London, the elder child and only son of Edward Racine Fricker (<i>d</i>. 1935/6), civil servant, and his wife, Deborah Alice Parr, nurse. His middle name came from his great-grandmother, who was a direct descendant of the French dramatist. He was educated at St Paul's School, London. His father died when Peter was fifteen and about to enter the merchant navy, but this plan was prevented by his poor eyesight. He began studying organ as a schoolboy with Henry Wilson, then entered the Royal College of Music in 1937, where he continued his organ studies with Ernest Bullock, and piano with Henry Wilson. He was assistant organist to Wilson while continuing his studies. Before the Second World War, he also attended classes at Morley College. An early distinction was his election as a fellow of the Royal College of Organists at the age of nineteen. He studied theory and composition with R. O. Morris.<br>
<br>In 1940 Fricker's studies were interrupted by the war, during which he served as a radio operator in the Royal Air Force, in signals and intelligence. It was at the Royal College of Music that he had met (Audrey) Helen, a pianist, the daughter of Raymonde William Lee Clench, chartered accountant. They married in 1943, the same year he was posted to India to serve as an intelligence officer. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>After the war years Fricker resumed his composition studies with M&aacute;ty&aacute;s Seiber, who became a strong influence and a close friend and colleague at Morley College, in London. During his years there he conducted, acted as rehearsal pianist for the choir, and, together with his wife, made a living copying and arranging music. From 1952 to 1964 he held a dual post as director of music at Morley College, where he succeeded Michael Tippett, and also as professor of composition at the Royal College of Music. His career as a composer was launched when he won the A. J. Clements prize for his wind quintet in 1947, which was quickly followed by the Koussevitzky prize for his first symphony in 1949, and by winning the Arts Council Festival of Britain competition for young composers prize for his violin concerto in 1951. These distinctions made him one of the most prominent British composers of his generation.<br>
<br>Fricker's music represented a departure from the nationalistic pastoralism coined by Ralph Vaughan Williams, for he was one of the first in England to assimilate the contributions of B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k, Arnold Schoenberg, and Igor Stravinsky, and to synthesize these influences with an expressively dissonant style of his own. During the 1950s he composed seven film scores and six works for radio. Other important works during this highly prolific period include two more symphonies (nos. 2 and 3), <span class="italic">Dance Scene</span> (1954), <span class="italic">Litany</span> (1955), and the large oratorio <span class="italic">The Vision of Judgement</span> (1956&#150;8).<br>
<br>In 1964 Fricker was invited to the University of California at Santa Barbara, as visiting professor. He became enamoured of the school and its surroundings, and excited about the possibility of establishing a centre for compositional study at the university. In 1965 he was appointed professor. His wife joined him in Santa Barbara, and they lived in nearby Goleta for the rest of his life. He held the Dorothy and Sherill C. Corwin chair in music, and had a joint appointment in the university's innovative College of Creative Studies. He was a dedicated, patient teacher, and provided guidance to many composition students over the years. He was a tall, imposing figure of a man, but gentle and rather shy and reserved. His interests included bird-watching, word puzzles, mystery novels, travel, and cats.<br>
<br>His compositional output was extensive, and Fricker was steadily prolific throughout his entire career. His oeuvre included five symphonies, three string quartets, a ballet, an oratorio, concerti, various choral works, numerous chamber works, and others in all genres except staged opera, comprising a total of more than 160 works in all. His reputation was international, and he composed works for important performers and ensembles such as Julian Bream, Dennis Brain, Henryk Szering, the Amadeus Quartet, and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1976 his symphony no. 5 was given its premi&egrave;re by the BBC Symphony Orchestra to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Royal Festival Hall.<br>
<br>Fricker's honours and awards included an honorary fellowship of the Royal Academy of Music (1966), an honorary doctorate in music from the University of Leeds (1958), the freedom of the City of London, and the order of merit of West Germany (1965). He was an honorary professorial fellow and research professor in the Institute of Creative Arts of University College, Cardiff, as well as an active member of the International Society for Contemporary Music, the Society of Composers International, and the Composers' Guild of Great Britain (of which he was elected vice-president in 1986). During the summers from 1984 to 1986 he served as president of the Cheltenham international festival.<br>
<br>In 1989 Fricker was appointed composer-in-residence of the Santa Barbara Symphony Orchestra, for which he had composed an orchestral work, <span class="italic">Walk by Quiet Waters</span> (1988). It was while he was working on a second work for them, and looking forward to retirement, that he died on 1 February 1990 in Santa Barbara, of cancer of the throat and larynx.<br>
