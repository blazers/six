<span class="headword">Ainley,  Henry Hinchliffe</span>  (1879&#150;1945), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born at Morley, near Leeds, on 21 August 1879, the only son and eldest child of Richard Ainley, cloth finisher, and his wife, Ada Hinchliffe. After education at the church school of St Peter's, Morley, he became clerk in a bank at Sheffield, where he took part in amateur dramatics. When George Alexander and his company were on tour in 1899 young Ainley was permitted to &#145;walk on&#146;. He then joined Frank Benson's company, making his first London appearance at the Lyceum Theatre in 1900 when he played Gloucester in <span class="italic">Henry V</span>. He was still a Bensonian when Alexander saw him as Lorenzo in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> and chose him for Paolo in <span class="italic">Paolo and Francesca</span> by Stephen Phillips. So perfectly fitted was Ainley, both in looks and voice&#151;from which the north country accent had gone during his training under Benson&#151;that he became famous on the first night, 6 March 1902. His manner at that time was gently, though eagerly, romantic&#151;in complete contrast to the masterfulness that he afterwards acquired.<br>
<br>In 1903 Ainley went to the United States and made his first appearance in New York as leading man to Maude Adams, playing, among other parts, the Revd Gavin Dishart in <span class="italic">The Little Minister</span>. That year he married Suzanne (1875&#150;1924), actress, daughter of Richard Sheldon of New York. The marriage ended in divorce. In 1904 he returned to London to appear as Lancelot in Israel Zangwill's <span class="italic">Merely Mary Ann</span> and in 1905 he paid a short visit to Paris, where he was seen as Romeo in the balcony scene at the Op&eacute;ra Comique. In 1906 he returned to the St James's Theatre to play Orlando in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> to the Rosalind of Lilian Braithwaite, and he later joined the Vedrenne-Barker Company at the Royal Court Theatre, appearing as Orestes in Euripides' <span class="italic">Electra</span> and as Hippolytus. He gave a fine performance as Cassio in the production of <span class="italic">Othello</span> by Lewis Waller in May 1906. He was for several periods in the company of Sir Herbert Tree at His Majesty's Theatre, where in 1910 he took part in six plays during the Shakespeare festival.<br>
<br>It was in a production by Harley Granville Barker at the Savoy Theatre in 1912 that Ainley made one of his biggest and most original Shakespearian successes as Malvolio in <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span>, giving the character an altogether new power and appeal. He also appeared memorably as Leontes in <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span>. Another remarkable development in the direction of strong character was his creation (1913) of Ilam Carve in Arnold Bennett's <span class="italic">The Great Adventure</span>, which ran for nearly two years at the Kingsway Theatre. Another notable character part which he made his own was Joseph Quinney in H. A. Vachell's <span class="italic">Quinneys'</span> at the Haymarket Theatre in 1915. In 1916 he joined the army with a commission in the Royal Garrison Artillery and served in England, France, and Italy. In 1917 he married Elaine Fearon, daughter of J. Willis Titus; this marriage was also dissolved. He was demobilized in 1919 and went into management at the St James's Theatre, opening as Fedya in <span class="italic">Reparation</span>, an adaptation of Tolstoy's <span class="italic">The Living Corpse</span>, and playing Mark Antony in a revival of <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span> (1920). At His Majesty's Theatre in 1923 he gave a superb performance in the title part of J. E. Flecker's <span class="italic">Hassan</span>. At the Prince's Theatre in 1926 he played Macbeth to Sybil Thorndike's Lady Macbeth. After two years' illness he returned in July 1929 to play one of the most successful of all of his characters, as James Fraser in St John Ervine's <span class="italic">The First Mrs Fraser</span> at the Haymarket Theatre. In 1930 he appeared as Hamlet in a revival that was chosen for a royal command performance in the same year. At the Westminster Theatre in 1931 he did excellent work as Dr Knox in James Bridie's <span class="italic">The Anatomist</span> and in 1932 as the archangel in Bridie's <span class="italic">Tobias and the Angel</span>.<br>
<br>After an absence from the stage of six years, caused by illness, Ainley gave a single performance in 1938 at the Vaudeville Theatre of a scene from <span class="italic">Hassan</span>. After 1915 he appeared in a number of films, mostly theatrically conceived adaptations of Victorian novels and plays, but he made no deep impression in that medium. His broadcasts, on the other hand, were specially preserved by the British Broadcasting Corporation as examples of fine diction. No other actor of his time was better equipped for greatness than Ainley. In the romantic charm of his early performances and in the forceful but appealing character-creations of his later years he remained unexcelled. His Hamlet and Macbeth were not wholly satisfactory in construction and relation to the other characters, but they had magnificent moments. Whatever the type of play, Ainley's personality gave distinction to every part he took.<br>
<br>Henry Ainley had four children, two daughters and two sons, the elder of whom, Richard (1910&#150;1956), also proved himself an actor of high ability. Henry Ainley died in London on 31 October 1945.<br>
