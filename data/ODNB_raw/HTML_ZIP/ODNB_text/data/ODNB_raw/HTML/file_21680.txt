<span class="headword">Peacock,  Thomas Bevill</span>  (1812&#150;1882), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at York on 21 December 1812, son of Thomas Peacock and his wife, Sarah Bevill, who were members of the Society of Friends. When he was nine he was sent to the boarding-school of Samuel Marshall at Kendal, where he remained until apprenticed in 1828 to John Fothergill, a medical practitioner in Darlington. In 1833 he went to London to read medicine at University College; he also attended St George's Hospital. In 1835 he became a member of the College of Surgeons and a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries. He then travelled to benefit his health, twice visiting Ceylon, and studying for a time in Paris. He spent 1838 as house-surgeon at the hospital at Chester, and in 1841 he went to Edinburgh, where he obtained an MD the following year. In 1844 he was admitted as a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of London, and in 1849 he was elected assistant physician to St Thomas's Hospital. In 1850 he married Cornelia Walduck (<i>d</i>. 1869); there were no children. In the same year he was elected a fellow of the College of Physicians, and in 1865 he delivered the Croonian lectures there, entitled &#145;Some of the causes and effects of valvular disease of the heart&#146;. A dispensary which he began in Liverpool Street, London, eventually became the Victoria Park Hospital for diseases of the chest.<br>
<br>Peacock lectured at St Thomas's Hospital, first on materia medica and then on medicine. He was one of the founders of the Pathological Society of London in 1846, and a frequent contributor to its <span class="italic">Transactions</span>. He was its secretary in 1850, vice-president in 1852&#150;6, and president in 1865 and 1866. In 1848 he published <span class="italic">On the Influenza or Epidemic Catarrh of 1847&#150;8</span>, and in 1866 the treatise, <span class="italic">On Malformations of the Human Heart</span>. These, with his Croonian lectures of 1865 and his <span class="italic">Prognosis in Cases of Valvular Disease of the Heart</span> (1877), are his most important publications. Peacock was a candidate for the fellowship of the Royal Society in 1877 and 1878 but would not allow himself to be nominated again. However, the College of Surgeons gave him a gold medal in recognition of his valuable additions to their museum.<br>
<br>Peacock was fond of travelling, and visited North and South America as well as the Mediterranean. He lived at 20 Finsbury Circus, London, an area popular with many physicians in the second quarter of the nineteenth century. Peacock had an attack of left hemiplegia in 1877, but recovered from the paralysis, and saw patients and attended at the Pathological Society. In 1881 he had a mild attack of right hemiplegia, from which he also recovered. On 30 May 1882, while walking in St Thomas's Hospital, he collapsed and was carried into a ward where he died without having recovered consciousness. He was buried in the Quaker burial-ground at Tottenham, Middlesex.<br>
