<span class="headword">Hickes, Sir  Michael</span>  (1543&#150;1612), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was born on 21 October 1543, the first of six children of a mercer, Robert Hickes or Hicks (<i>d</i>. 1557), of the White Bear, Cheapside, London, and Julian (<i>d</i>. 1592), daughter of William Arthur of Somerset. The Hickes family had a long history as yeomen in neighbouring Gloucestershire, and it seems likely that Robert married before digging up his west country roots and setting off for London, where he established a retail mercery. Michael had five younger brothers, though only two, Clement and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13213/', "Baptist Hicks (1551?&#150;1629)")</script>, survived until manhood. Their father died in 1557 and his will reveals a moderate prosperity which enabled Michael to go up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1559.<br>
<br>It is not clear how long Hickes stayed at Trinity&#151;he did not graduate&#151;but he was certainly in residence in 1562. It was no doubt largely through his years at Trinity that Hickes acquired the extensive knowledge of the classics that enabled him to sprinkle his later correspondence with Latin epigrams. During the 1560s Trinity College was an important centre of puritanism at Cambridge. Thomas Cartwright, one of the leaders of the early Elizabethan puritan movement, was a fellow there while Hickes was in residence, and the two men got to know each other. Hickes's closest friends at university, men like Vincent Skinner and John Stubbe, were also puritans, and it is clear that he shared their religious views. In March 1565 he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn, where Stubbe and Skinner had preceded him. He maintained his interest in the law long after he had ceased to be a student. In 1577, four years after his entry into Lord Burghley's service, he received a call to the bar, though there is no evidence that he ever practised as a lawyer.<br>
<br>In 1573 Hickes entered the household of William Cecil, Lord Burghley, and embarked on a career which led to political influence and personal affluence. Four years later, serving alongside Henry Maynard, he became one of Burghley's two principal secretaries. He was patronage secretary, helping his master to deal with the flood of requests for favours and assistance which assailed Burghley from all corners of the land. Hickes dealt with suits of a very varied nature: requests for wardships, petitions from towns, university patronage, assistance with official government business, matters connected with the country's customs administration, legal requests, ecclesiastical causes, and petitions connected with building operations in London. The range of these suits to Hickes reflected his master's role as chief minister of the crown, a position which gave Burghley the greatest role in the distribution of the queen's patronage.<br>
<br>Hickes's position as middleman gave him great opportunities to extract gratuities from grateful clients. They knew that favours had to be paid for, and sometimes promised large sums, as much as &pound;100, for Hickes's help. It is probable in fact that during the 1590s he &#145;received more gratuities than any other servant in England&#146;  (Neale, 76). Hickes sat in four parliaments during his years as Burghley's secretary&#151;those of 1584, 1589, 1593, and 1597&#151;but we have certain knowledge of only one speech which he made in the Commons, and there is no indication that he ever played a prominent role in the house. He was almost certainly the author of the so-called <span class="italic">Anonymous Life</span> of Burghley, published within a few years of the latter's death and the most important literary source for his career.<br>
<br>During his years in Burghley's service Hickes forged a firm friendship with his master's younger son and political heir, Robert Cecil. In the 1590s the two men, working sometimes behind Burghley's back, resorted to a number of dubious practices in their dealings with suitors, and the personal and political friendship between the two continued into James I's reign. After 1608 their friendship cooled, though at the very end of Cecil's life the old intimacy was renewed. Early in 1612 a multiplicity of distressing symptoms suggested that Cecil was terminally ill. Towards the end of April it was decided that he should take the waters at Bath, and Hickes accompanied him in the role of close friend, staying with him until his death on 24 May.<br>
<br>In December 1594 Hickes married Elizabeth Parvish (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Colston), the prosperous widow of a London merchant, who bore him two sons, William and Michael, and a daughter, Elizabeth. She had a life interest in her late husband's country house at Ruckholt in Essex and Hickes spent much of his later life there, devoting a good deal of his time to local administration. He was feodary of Essex (the local representative of the court of wards) between 1598 and 1601; receiver-general of crown lands in Essex, Hertfordshire, London, and Middlesex between 1603 and 1604; and chief steward of nine royal manors in Essex after 1608. From 1609 until 1612 he once more played a role in central administration as a deputy in the alienations office, which dealt with the fines levied on those who wished to sell freehold land or land held in chief of the crown.<br>
<br>Both Queen Elizabeth and James I visited Ruckholt, the former in 1597 and the latter in 1604. Shortly after James's visit Hickes was knighted, on 6 August 1604. He died at Ruckholt on 15 August 1612 of a &#145;burning ague&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 1.379), and was buried at Leyton church, Essex. At the time of his death he owned property in London, Nottinghamshire, and Gloucestershire, and he had, during his lifetime, made considerable sums from the profits of office holding and from the moneylending activities which he undertook for many years.<br>
