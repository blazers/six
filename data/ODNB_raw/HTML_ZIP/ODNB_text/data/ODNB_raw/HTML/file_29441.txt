<span class="headword">Willes,  George Wickens</span>  (1785&#150;1846), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the son of Lieutenant John Willes RN (1753&#150;1797), who lost a leg at Gibraltar in 1782. In 1794 he was entered on the books of the <i>Royal William</i>, flagship of Sir Peter Parker at Spithead. In 1796 he was on the books of the sloop <i>Fairy</i>, commanded by his maternal uncle, John Irwin, whom, early in 1797, he followed to the <i>Prince George</i>; in this ship he was present at the battle of Cape St Vincent [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21347/', "Parker, Sir William (1742&#150;1802)")</script>]. He was afterwards with Irwin in the <i>Lively</i>, the <i>Boston</i>, the <i>Formidable</i>, and the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>. He was in the <i>Success</i> with Captain Shuldham Peard at the blockade of Malta, and at the capture of the <i>G&eacute;n&eacute;reux</i> on 18 February 1800, when he was severely wounded; he was still on the <i>Success</i> when she was captured by Ganteaume on 13 February 1801.<br>
<br>On 6 November 1801 Willes was promoted lieutenant; he served in the sloop <i>Sophie</i>, in the <i>Active</i> (one of the ships which passed the Dardanelles in February 1807), and in the <i>Spartan</i> with Captain Jahleel Brenton. During 1809, in command of the frigate's boats, he was repeatedly engaged in storming batteries or destroying coasting vessels in the Adriatic and among the Ionian Islands. He was still in the <i>Spartan</i> when, in the Bay of Naples on 3 May 1810, she defeated and put to flight a Franco-Neapolitan squadron, with 95 guns and 1400 men. Brenton was wounded, and his place ably and bravely taken by his first lieutenant, Willes. Brenton praised him as &#145;one of the best and most gallant officers I ever met with&#146;  (O'Byrne, 1294). Willes, who was himself severely wounded, was promoted commander on 2 June 1810; he was also permitted to accept from the king of Naples the order of St Ferdinand and Merit, third class.<br>
<br>In 1811&#150;12 Willes commanded the brig <i>Leveret</i> in the North Sea, where he captured several privateers; he was later in the sloop <i>Bacchus</i> on the Irish station, and on 7 June 1814 he was made captain. Willes married, on 8 January 1814, Anne Ellen, second daughter of Sir Edmund Lacon, first baronet, MP for North Yarmouth. Among their children was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36911/', "Admiral Sir George Ommanney Willes")</script>. In 1817&#150;18 he commanded the <i>Cherub</i> (26 guns) on the coast of Africa; in 1819&#150;20, the <i>Wye</i> (26 guns) in the North Sea; in 1823&#150;7, the <i>Brazen</i> (26 guns) on the South American and African stations, on the latter capturing eight armed slavers and liberating 998 slaves; and in 1836 the <i>Dublin</i> (50 guns) as flag captain to Sir Graham Eden Hamond on the coast of South America. In February 1845 he commissioned the <i>Vanguard</i> (80 guns), in which, after a few months in the channel, he went out to the Mediterranean. He died at Malta on 26 October 1846.<br>
