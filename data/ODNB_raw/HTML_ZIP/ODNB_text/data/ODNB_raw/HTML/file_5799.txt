<span class="headword">Codrington <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Mainwaring]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1640&#150;1694), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was the son of Edward Codrington of Sutton Mandeville, Wiltshire, and his wife, Frances, daughter of Francis Perkins of Ufton Court, Berkshire. He had several siblings, among whom his brother Bonaventure was also a priest. He was educated at the English College at Douai, where he used the alias Mainwaring. He was ordained priest in 1676, after only two years' study of theology, because he had been invited to Rome by Cardinal Howard; there he acted for some time as his chaplain and secretary. In July 1684 he returned to England, and was in 1686 appointed one of the chaplains and preachers-in-ordinary to James II. While at Rome he had joined the Institute of Secular Priests living in community (founded in Bavaria by Bartolom&auml;us Holzhauser), and on his return to England he and his companion, John Morgan, were appointed procurators with a view to the introduction of the institute there. This design was cordially approved by Cardinal Howard. The rule of the institute was for two or more priests to live in common in the same house, without female attendance, and in subjection to the ordinary of the diocese. In 1697 the rules of the institute were published in England, under the title of <span class="italic">Constitutiones clericorum saecularium in communi viventium</span>. But the scheme encountered much opposition, especially from the secular clergy chapter, on whose behalf John Sergeant wrote &#145;A letter to our worthy brethren of the new institute&#146;. This letter gave the death blow to the institute, which was subsequently, in 1703, suppressed by Bishop Giffard, vicar apostolic of the London district. Its funds were incorporated into the Secular Clergy Common Fund.<br>
<br>Codrington made his will in 1688, which he left with his sister on following James II into exile at St Germain-en-Laye. There he continued to officiate as his chaplain. He made another will in 1693, which was contested by his sister on the grounds that he was blind and <i>non compos mentis</i> as a result of smallpox, from which he died, at St Germain, on 4 or 14 February 1694. His only publications were two sermons preached at court in 1686 and 1687.<br>
