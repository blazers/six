<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Murrell,  Christine Mary</span>  (1874&#150;1933), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 18 October 1874 at 1 Jeffrey's Road, Clapham Road, London, the only child of Charles Murrell, a coal merchant, and his wife, Alice Elizabeth Rains. Being both the only child and the only grandchild of a well-to-do family, she grew up enjoying plenty of affection and attention from family members, who later seem to have been willing to help her to pursue a professional career. In 1894 she entered the London School of Medicine for Women; she received the degrees of MB BS at the University of London in 1899. During the early part of her career she held various posts, including locum tenens at Morpeth, resident clinical assistant at the Northumberland County Asylum, medical officer at the Victoria settlement in Liverpool, and house physician and medical registrar at the Royal Free Hospital, London. In 1903, with financial support from her grandfather John Rains, she set up a private practice in Bayswater, London, with her lifelong partner and friend Dr (Elizabeth) Honor Bone. After experiencing some initial difficulty, they became established in practice by 1908. Meanwhile Murrell had completed an MD in psychology and mental diseases at the University of London (1905). Like many doctors at that time she was also interested in the problem of infant welfare. In 1907 she took charge of the St Marylebone Health Society's &#145;Infant Consultation&#146; on Lisson Grove, one of the earliest infant welfare clinics. There she provided medical examinations for infants and advice to mothers for the following eighteen years.<br>
<br>Murrell's most significant achievement was her fight for equal opportunities for women. She believed that it was women's lack of knowledge about their own physiology and health that led them to the erroneous idea that their &#145;disabilities&#146; were natural. Thus, for about twenty years she gave a series of evening lectures at the London county council, directed mainly at working-class women and covering various health-related subjects, including first aid, home nursing, infant care, and the physiology of adolescence. The lecture series on physiology was published in 1923 as <span class="italic">Womanhood and Health</span>. Another important contribution in this area was her study of menstruation. In 1925, under the auspices of the London Association of the Medical Women's Federation, Murrell and Letitia Fairfield initiated a survey on menstrual experience among girls in an attempt to eliminate negative associations with it. A larger-scale survey was launched in 1926 and the results appeared in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> in 1930. Murrell's opposition to the proposed restrictive legislation for women in industry can be understood as an extension of this research, because such legislation was based on the assumption that women were physically inferior and therefore unsuitable for certain types of work. She argued that instead of this kind of legislation there should be &#145;an improvement in the general conditions of labour, good pay, reasonable hours, and healthy conditions under which to work&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 1932, 106).<br>
<br>Before the First World War, Murrell's fight for equality also extended to the women's suffrage movement. As her biographer recounted, Murrell<blockquote>helped to manage one of the suffrage propaganda shops, addressed meetings, went on the deputations &hellip;, marched in the processions &hellip; and put her medical skill at the service of the hunger-strikers, when, near death, they were released from prison under the <span class="roman">&#145;Cat and Mouse Act&#146;</span>. (St John, 57)</blockquote>During the war, she worked as one of the medical officers, and was later chair, of the Women's Emergency Corps. She also served as a medical officer to the Metropolitan Special Constabulary. After the passage of the <span class="roman">Sex Disqualification Removal Bill</span> in 1918, she joined the women's election committee which sought the adoption of women candidates for election to the House of Commons.<br>
<br>Murrell did a great deal of public work and achieved many distinctions. She was an active member of the Medical Women's Federation, serving as its fifth president (1926&#150;8), and was a member of the International Medical Women's Association. Although she was a prominent medical woman, her professional activities were not limited to women's issues. She served on various committees and high offices of the British Medical Association, which culminated in her being elected the first female member of the council in 1924. In September 1933 she was elected as the first female representative to the General Medical Council, the governing body of the medical profession, but before she could take the seat she died of cancer at her home, 21 North Gate, London, on 18 October 1933. She never married.<br>
