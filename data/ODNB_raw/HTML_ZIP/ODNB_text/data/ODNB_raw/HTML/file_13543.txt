<span class="headword">Holland,  Thomas</span>, earl of Kent  (<em>c.</em>1315&#150;1360), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37562/', "Robert Holland, Lord Holland (d. 1328)")</script> of Upholland, Lancashire, and Maud (<i>d</i>. 1349), daughter and coheir of Alan Zouche, Lord Zouche, of Ashby, Leicestershire. He had three brothers: Robert (<i>d</i>. 1373), who succeeded to the Holland estates in 1335 and resided at Thorpe Waterville in Northamptonshire, Alan, and Otto (<i>d</i>. 1359), who both followed Thomas into military service; and three sisters: Isabella, mistress of John de Warenne, earl of Surrey (<i>d</i>. 1347); Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1349), married to John de la Warr; and Matilda, possible sometime wife of John (II) Mowbray, Lord Mowbray.<br>
<br>Thomas Holland's soldiering probably began in Scotland in the early 1330s. He was in Bordeaux in 1337 with Robert d'Artois, was a knight of the royal household by 1338, served in Flanders in 1338&#150;9 and 1340, at Sluys, and on the abortive Tournai campaign. Probably by this time he had made the considerable coup of marrying the king's cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14823/', "Joan (c.1328&#150;1385)")</script>, known as the Fair Maid of Kent. He was a landless young knight, son of a disgraced Lancastrian lord. She had also lost her father in disgrace and was not then the heiress she would become through the deaths without heirs of her uncle Thomas, Lord Wake, in 1349 and her brother John, earl of Kent, in 1352, but it seems a surprising match and may have been a reward by Edward III to a loyal, energetic, young knight. Joan's mother, Margaret, countess of Kent, was not so favourable towards the match, and she may well have engineered Joan's marriage to the better connected William Montagu, heir to the earl of Salisbury, by February 1341, at a time when Holland was probably away on crusade in Prussia.<br>
<br>Holland fought in Brittany with the king in 1342&#150;3, then went to Bayonne with Sir John Hardeshull, and probably on to Granada with the earl of Derby in 1343. He may have returned to Brittany in 1345. At the siege of Caen, in 1346, he captured the count of Eu, constable of France. Holland's reputation was apparently a factor in the count's choice of captor. This could have made Holland very wealthy as he sold the count to Edward III for 80,000 florins, but how much of this Holland ever received is unknown. The capture enhanced his eminence as a soldier on the Cr&eacute;cy campaign, when he also featured at Amiens and Rouen, was wounded at a castle on the Seine, commanded the rearguard on the march from Caen, and counted casualties after the battle at Cr&eacute;cy. His eminence led to his institution, in 1348, along with his brother Otto, often his associate and lieutenant in his military exploits, as one of the founder knights of the Order of the Garter [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92770', "Founding knights of the Order of the Garter")</script>].<br>
<br>Holland was now also able to institute proceedings at the papal court for the restoration of his wife, Joan. Their marriage was confirmed and publicized in November 1349; their first son, Thomas, was born in 1350. Their original union was declared to have been consummated; the &#145;marriage&#146; with William Montagu had been null and void from the start. Holland's fortunes soon took a further rise as Joan's brother John, earl of Kent, died childless in 1352. Joan inherited his estates, spread over some sixteen counties. Holland was now, in the right of his wife, a landed lord of significant territorial resources. He was summoned to parliament as Lord Holland from 1354, and his military career burgeoned with a series of independent commands. Captain of Calais Castle in August 1352, he travelled again to Brittany in 1353 and in 1354 was made the king's captain and lieutenant there, with custody of the young heir to the duchy and funding from local revenues. He became keeper of the Channel Islands in June 1356, at a time when Castle Cornet there was in French hands; his able lieutenant, his brother Otto, soon recaptured it. Holland was appointed custodian of Crocy Castle in Normandy in November 1357 and then governor of the Harcourt lands in the Cotentin, based on St Sauveur-le-Vicomte, in October 1358. Custody of Barfleur in the Cotentin followed in October 1359, when he was also made joint lieutenant of Normandy with Philippe of Navarre. In September 1360 he received his most important post yet, when he was made Edward III's captain and lieutenant in Normandy and France. He was now accorded the title of earl of Kent to bolster his authority and prestige. He had the delicate, diplomatic task of carrying out the provisions of the treaty of Br&eacute;tigny of October 1360, but while performing this duty he contracted some illness and died at Rouen on 28 December 1360. His body was initially interred in the church of the Friars Minor in Rouen, and was later moved to the church of the Greyfriars, Stamford, Lincolnshire.<br>
<br>Holland left four children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13544/', "Thomas Holland, later earl of Kent")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13529/', "John Holland, later earl of Huntingdon and duke of Exeter")</script>; Maud (<i>d</i>. 1392), who married first Hugh Courtenay and then Waleran, count of St Pol; and Joan (<i>d</i>. 1384), who married John de Montfort, duke of Brittany. Holland's widow, Joan, married Edward, the Black Prince, in 1361.<br>
