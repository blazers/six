<span class="headword">Squibb,  Arthur</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1679/80), <span class="occ">Fifth Monarchist politician</span>, came of minor Dorset gentry stock with strong exchequer connections. He was the fourth son of John Squibb; his mother, Anne, was a sister of Sir Robert Seymour of Hanford. Arthur Squibb the elder, his father's first cousin, was a teller of the exchequer, and his elder brother Lawrence also became one in 1640, in which year he himself acquired a reversion to a tellership. Unlike Lawrence, but like his elder namesake, the younger Arthur was a parliamentarian, and he adventured &pound;300 in the prospective purchase of Irish lands. He was described as clerk to Sir Edward Powell, a master of requests, in the earlier 1640s, and later in the decade he served on various commissions for Surrey or Westminster or both, including those for the assessment, the militia, and sequestrations. He rose further under the Commonwealth, becoming a commissioner for compounding and a JP in February 1650 and a commissioner for indemnity in 1652. A lay preacher, his house was the meeting place of a gathered church by 1649.<br>
<br>At some stage Squibb became an ardent Fifth Monarchist&#151;certainly before he was nominated to Barebone's Parliament in 1653 as a member for Middlesex. He was one of those who led that assembly in prayer on its first full day's sitting, which it devoted entirely to religious exercises. He took an extreme position on law reform as well as in matters religious, and his fellow millenarians took to meeting regularly at his house to concert their parliamentary tactics. That, however, owed more to the convenience of his nearby residence than to any personal pre-eminence. He was a zealous MP and served on numerous committees, although as Aylmer notes &#145;[h]e was constantly late &hellip; perhaps he was waiting for the Second Coming, or at least for the rule of the Saints upon Earth&#146;  (Aylmer, 217). The house never elected him to the council of state. When the moderate majority finally resigned their power back into Oliver Cromwell's hands, Squibb was one of the radical remnant who sat on until they were evicted in January 1654.<br>
<br>Like all Fifth Monarchists, Squibb regarded Cromwell's protectorate as a usurpation of the promised kingdom of Christ. He remained a JP but his other public employments terminated, and he sold his reversion to a tellership to his half-brother Edmund. In 1655&#150;6 he engaged in discussions with some disaffected Commonwealthsmen about a possible basis for an alternative government, but he steered clear of active conspiracy or rebellion. He was re-employed by the restored Rump in 1659, but after the army's second seizure of power he was briefly imprisoned in the Isle of Man. After the Restoration, pursuing his erstwhile reversion on Edmund's behalf, he was pronounced unfit for a tellership (in 1662 he was compared to the recently executed regicide Thomas Harrison), but he kept out of trouble until 1671, when at a date before 1 July he was sent to the Tower as one of a group of thirty-five Fifth Monarchists and Seventh Day Baptists, and as having refused to swear the oath of allegiance  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Charles II</span>, 1671, 11.357). He was free a year later, however, when, on 28 October, he was licensed under the declaration of indulgence, as a Baptist, to preach at his house in Chertsey  (ibid., 14.93). Here he died some time between 30 November 1679 and 1 April 1680; his will, which was proved on the latter date, shows him in possession of lands in Essex and Ireland. It made modest but adequate provision for his wife, Martha, daughter of John Ireland of Hale in Lancashire, and for a son and three daughters.<br>
