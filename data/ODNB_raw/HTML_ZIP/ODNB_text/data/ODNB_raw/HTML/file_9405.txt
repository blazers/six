<span class="headword">Fielding,  Sarah</span>  (1710&#150;1768), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 8 November 1710 at East Stour, Dorset, third daughter and fourth child of the mercurial and improvident Edmund Fielding (1680&#150;1741), army officer, third son of William, fifth earl of Denbigh, and his first wife, Sarah Gould (1682&#150;1718), daughter of Sir Henry Gould, judge of the queen's bench, of Sharpham Park, near Glastonbury, Somerset. Sarah spent her youth in East Stour, with her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9400/', "Henry Fielding")</script>, sisters Catharine (1708&#150;1750), Ursula (1709&#150;1750), Anne (1713&#150;1716), and Beatrice (1714&#150;1751), another brother, Edmund (<i>b</i>. 1716, <i>d</i>. after 1755), and, after her father's second marriage, to Anne Rapha, an Italian and Roman Catholic widow (<i>d</i>. 1727), six stepbrothers. Her father, pursuing a military career in London, placed his children in the care of Lady Sarah Davidge Gould, Fielding's maternal grandmother, and the daughters were sent to Mary Rookes's boarding-school in the close, Salisbury, where girls were &#145;to be educated and to learn to work and read and write and to talk French and Dance and be brought up as Gentlewomen&#146;  (Fielding, <span class="italic">Governess</span>, 7). Lady Gould won legal custody of the children. During her Salisbury years Sarah made friendships important for both her education and her subsequent writing career: Dr Arthur Collier taught her Latin and Greek; the talented Jane Collier, Arthur's sister, became her closest companion and literary collaborator until her death some time before the autumn of 1755; and James Harris, Greek and Latin scholar, linguist, musician, politician, and close friend of Henry Fielding, gave detailed advice on her most ambitious and taxing publication, a translation of Xenophon. Most of Sarah's extant letters are addressed to Harris.<br>
<br>Lady Gould died in June 1733, and Sarah probably left Salisbury for extended periods in East Stour, London, and Bath. From 1739 to 1744 she may have lived with her sister Catharine in Prince's Court, Westminster, and then for three years with Henry and his wife, Charlotte, in Old Boswell Court, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, where Joseph Warton met her in October 1746  (Wooll, 215). She may have lived for a time in Church Lane, Widcombe, near Bath, in a cottage provided by Ralph Allen, dedicatee of her brother's last novel, <span class="italic">Amelia</span> (1751), and the owner of nearby Prior Park, where Sarah was a visitor. Allen left her a legacy of &pound;100, paid annually for the last three years of her life. She was in London until May or June 1754 and then moved to Bath. In October 1760 she moved to Walcot, her last known address.<br>
<br>Sarah's first known venture into print was a &#145;letter&#146; from &#145;Leonora to Horatio&#146; included in her brother's first major novel, <span class="italic">Joseph Andrews</span> (February 1742, bk 2, chap. 4). The letter's courtship theme of personal integrity and solid values corrupted by materialism and fashion anticipates her later fiction. Sarah's short fictional autobiography of Anne Boleyn appeared as the final chapter of Henry's <span class="italic">A Journey from this World to the Next</span>  (H. Fielding, <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span>, 2, April 1743), and in May 1744 her first novel appeared, <span class="italic">The Adventures of David Simple</span>, set in the cities of London and Westminster. For its second edition (July), Henry supplied revisions &#145;not entirely for the good&#146;  (Kelsall, introduction to Fielding, <span class="italic">Simple</span>, xxi), corrections, and a preface. Sarah was also on friendly terms with the master of the epistolary novel, Samuel Richardson&#151;to whom she addressed her only separately published piece of literary criticism (anonymously), and one of the earliest published critical defences of Richardson, <span class="italic">Remarks on &#145;Clarissa&#146;</span> (1749)&#151;and on 10 April 1747 she published by subscription a two-volume plotless collection of different sorts of prose and poetic narrative, neither novel nor sequel, set in Bath and reminiscent of Richardson's first book (usually known by its short title, <span class="italic">Familiar Letters</span>, 1741), <span class="italic">Familiar Letters between the Principal Characters of David Simple and Others</span>. This included biographical remarks in a preface and letters 40&#150;44, all written by her brother, as well as two dialogues (2.276&#150;93) supplied by James Harris. Its 500 subscribers included Sarah's cousin Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, William Warburton, and Samuel Richardson.<br>
<br>Sarah's next novel, the first children's school story exclusively about and for young girls, was printed by her artistic mentor, Richardson, by now her brother's rival. <span class="italic">The governess, or, The little female academy: being the history of Mrs Teachum and her nine girls, with their nine days amusement</span> appeared in 1749, by which time Sarah was living with her &#145;sisterhood&#146;&#151;Catharine, Ursula, and Beatrice&#151;in Duke Street, Westminster, near to Jane Collier at Doctors' Commons. The lead article in the <span class="italic">Jacobite's Journal</span>, number 30 (25 June), is a &#145;letter&#146; from Honoria Hunter, and is possibly Sarah's work  (Battestin and Battestin, <span class="italic">Fielding</span>, 440). A second, revised edition of <span class="italic">The Governess</span> appeared in August 1749 in a cheaper edition &#145;For the use of schools&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Evening-Post</span>, 29&#150;31 August, and <span class="italic">General Advertiser</span>, 2 September), but nothing seems to have come of a project to write an instructive &#145;Book upon Education&#146;  (Barbauld, 2.63). Her publisher, Andrew Millar, paid Sarah &pound;58 on 3 June 1752, presumably for the copy of <span class="italic">David Simple, Volume the Last</span>, and a total of &pound;256 between 5 October 1750 and 6 October 1753, presumably for <span class="italic">The Governess</span>  (Battestin and Probyn, xxxviii). Through the Richardson circle Sarah met Elizabeth Carter and enjoyed some generous financial patronage from Mrs Elizabeth Montagu (1720&#150;1800), whose sister, the Bath novelist Sarah Scott (1723&#150;1795), probably knew Sarah better than anyone else between 1754 and 1768.<br>
<br>In 1753 the true sequel to Sarah Fielding's first novel appeared, <span class="italic">The Adventures of David Simple, Volume the Last</span>, with a preface almost certainly written by Jane Collier. John Upton remarked that &#145;the world think it a meer 3d volume and not a new story, and thus the book stops with the booksellers. She should, I told her, have changed the title; for Novelty is the charm of the present age&#146;  (12 Feb 1753: Battestin and Probyn, 74). The moral vision of this book is Sarah's most powerful, and its sombre depiction of the decline and fall of a good man depicts a society driven by self-seeking and cruel social indifference. It is now thought unlikely that Sarah contributed numbers 63 and 64 of the <span class="italic">Covent-Garden Journal</span>, 23 and 30 September 1752  (Goldgar, 336&#150;43). In March 1754 appeared <span class="italic">The Cry: a New Dramatic Fable</span> (3 vols.), a product of collaboration between Sarah and Jane Collier. Its ironic wit and formal originality were not appreciated, and few readers saw its merits (Richardson and Hester Lynch Piozzi were two notable exceptions): its odd combination of allegory, philosophy, moral theorizing, and social satire remains a readerly challenge. Avoiding the model of the exemplary or cautionary tale, it turns to psychology, &#145;the inward mind&#146; and &#145;the labyrinths of the human mind&#146;  (1.11, 14). In another respect, the contribution made by Sarah Fielding, both in <span class="italic">The Cry</span> and in her works in general to a feminist agenda had to await the twentieth century for general recognition and sympathetic evaluation. Although hardly revolutionary, she clearly focuses on the powerlessness of the unhappily married woman who, because of economic dependence, becomes the easy victim of patriarchy.<br>
<br>By the end of 1754 Sarah had lost every member of her immediate family. Poor health and resulting impecuniousness necessitated a move to Bath, facilitated by some financial help from Richardson. A series of novels followed rapidly, each concerned with female friendship and the perils of the marriage market, and profits enabled her to survive the loss of her family. A total of 441 subscribers signed up for her double fictional autobiography told from beyond the grave, <span class="italic">The Lives of Cleopatra and Octavia</span> (published 19 May 1757, although William Strahan had printed subscription receipts for it back in June 1748), for which she undertook a prodigious amount of reading, from Plutarch to Shakespeare, Sedley, and Dryden. <span class="italic">The History of the Countess of Dellwyn</span> followed in 1759&#151;remarkable for her most extensive essay in literary theory, a discussion of mimetic theories of character in fiction&#151;and an epistolary novel, <span class="italic">The History of Ophelia</span> (31 March 1760; German translation, 1764). The last was her most popular novel, although the title page describes her not as the author but as the publisher, the manuscript having been found &#145;in an old Buroe&#146;  (advertisement).<br>
<br>In Bath, Sarah lived in straitened circumstances, and perforce quietly, but she was neither impoverished nor isolated. Apart from her own income from writing, Sir John Fielding gave her &pound;20 in 1761, and possibly in earlier years too, and she may have purchased (through Harris's influence and at half price) the lifehold of her Walcot cottage. Her visitors included Elizabeth Carter, Mrs Frances Sheridan, the mother of the dramatist, and Elizabeth Montagu, the so-called Queen of the Blues. Mrs Montagu's scheme for a <i>Millennium Hall</i>-like community of self-financing, unmarried gentlewomen and widows (including Sarah Fielding) devoted to charitable works, to be based at Hitcham, came to nothing. A less institutionalized Bath sisterhood was established, however, including Elizabeth and her novelist sister Sarah Scott, Lady Barbara Montagu (the sister of the second earl of Halifax), Sarah Fielding, and perhaps the poet Esther Lewis (<i>c</i>.1747&#150;1789), who addressed a poem &#145;To Miss Fielding, in London&#146; about 1758, among others. Nothing came of a planned collaboration with James Harris on a memoir of her brother, although Harris's memoir has since been published, but Sarah's own final triumph came on 27 January 1762, the publication day of her <span class="italic">Xenophon's Memoirs of Socrates, with the Defence of Socrates before his Judges</span> translated from the Greek original (Bath and London, 1762; corrected edn, 1767). The project had begun in early September 1758 and she had worked closely on it with Harris, who had advised her on Greek etymologies and the translating of particularly abstruse passages and phrases. Nevertheless, the translation was her own, and the fastidious Harris was evidently willing to have his name printed alongside all but two of his contributions. It is the only book she signed with her own name, and it was well received. One section was often reprinted, and it remained in print until well into the twentieth century (<span class="italic">Socratic Discourses: Plato &amp; Xenophon</span>, 1937). It attracted 611 subscribers, including her friends Ralph Allen, Elizabeth Carter, Arthur Collier, seven members of the Harris family, Dr John Hoadly, Hester Lynch, four women from the Montagu family, Hester Mulso, Henry Wortley Montagu, Joseph and Thomas Warton, and one of her deceased brother's (and Samuel Johnson's) closest friends, Saunders Welch. Mrs Montagu thought the translation &#145;excellent&#146; and, ever sensitive to the social obstacles placed in the way of clever women, wrote to Sarah Scott with a comment that applies equally to the powerfully bookish substructure of the novels, with their abiding moral and ethical focus: &#145;Her genius points to the Portico &amp; Academick groves, never let it saunter in the tuilleries &hellip; Her style and manner is more suited to the concise wit of Diogenes in his tub&#146;  (Battestin and Probyn, xxxix). Montagu was also willing to pay Sarah's medical expenses and all the money she thought Sarah was entitled to but did not receive from Sir John Fielding.<br>
<br>Sarah Fielding's work indicates wide reading in English literature, in the Latin classics, and in French, and her translation shows that she was better in Greek than her highly educated brother. She wrote to make a living, but her novels also take up important social and economic issues for women (and in <span class="italic">Volume the Last</span> for men, too), and her translation was done out of intellectual ambition and pride in her own accomplishment. She died on 9 April 1768, probably at Bath, and was buried on 14 April in St Mary's, Charlcombe, Bath, where her brother had married Charlotte Cradock in 1734. Her friend Dr John Hoadly's inscribed monument to her in Bath Abbey contains several factual errors, but celebrates her moral teaching (her books were &#145;Incentives to Virtue and an Honour to her Sex&#146;) and her classical scholarship, which taught &#145;Athens' Wisdom to her Sex&#146;. There is no known portrait.<br>
