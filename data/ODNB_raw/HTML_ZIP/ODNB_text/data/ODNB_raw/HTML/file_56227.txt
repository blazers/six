<span class="headword">Duval <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Dugdale]</span>,  Una Harriet Ella Stratford</span>  (1879&#150;1975), <span class="occ">suffragette and marriage reformer</span>, was born on 28 January 1879 at Slanmore, Beulah Hill, Upper Norwood, Surrey, the elder daughter and one of five children of Commander Edward Stratford Dugdale, a naval officer, and his wife, Alice Florence Richards. Brought up in a distinguished Warwickshire family, Una was educated in Aberdeen near the family's holiday home in Aboyne and at Cheltenham Ladies' College, finishing her education in Paris and Hanover where she studied singing. Although both her parents supported the women's suffrage struggle, it was during the summer of 1907, when in London for the social season, that Una became involved herself and joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) after hearing Christabel Pankhurst speak in Hyde Park.<br>
<br>For the next five years Una Dugdale, like many other women of her age and social class, committed herself to the militant suffrage struggle, campaigning for the women's vote in Scotland on speaking tours with Emmeline Pankhurst, helping to arrange social events for the WSPU in London, and engaging in direct action. In 1909 during a WSPU &#145;raid&#146; on the House of Commons she was arrested in Parliament Square and imprisoned for a month.<br>
<br>In 1911 Una Dugdale met her future husband Victor Diedrichs Duval (1885&#150;1945). Also from a wealthy upper-class family with liberal credentials, Duval had founded the Men's Political Union for Women's Enfranchisement and had been arrested and imprisoned for activism. It was as a result of her refusal to say the words &#145;I obey&#146; at her marriage ceremony on 13 January 1912 that Una Duval acquired a brief notoriety within the women's movement. Although on the day of the wedding two priests were sent by the archbishop of Canterbury to the Chapel Royal at the Savoy where the service was taking place, the only concession made to their insistence that Una Duval pronounce the words &#145;I obey&#146; was that the officiating minister read the words out even though they were not repeated. Marriage reform had long been a feminist concern and Duval's standpoint signified a feminist commitment to marriage as an equal partnership based on love and respect rather than subservience and subordination. Later in the year she explained her reasons for departing from convention in her pamphlet <span class="italic">Love and Honour but NOT Obey</span>.<br>
<br>After the First World War Una Duval appears to have devoted herself to family life, in particular bringing up her two daughters; but she did not encourage them to take up careers. Although she remained committed to preserving the memory of the militant suffrage struggle through membership of the Suffragette Fellowship, of which she was co-founder and was treasurer for many years, there is no evidence of any further active engagement in women's politics. Una Duval died in St Stephen's Hospital, Chelsea, London, on 24 February 1975.<br>
