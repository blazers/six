<span class="headword">Everitt,  Allen Edward</span>  (1824&#150;1882), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born on 10 April 1824 at 59 Newhall Street, Birmingham, the son of Edward Everitt (1793&#150;1880) and his wife, Harriet Parkes (1797&#150;1877), and grandson of Allen Everitt (1759&#150;1851), successive proprietors of the principal artists' repository in the city. His maternal grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21351/', "David Parkes")</script>, the Shropshire antiquary.<br>
<br>Taking drawing lessons in early life from David Cox, Everitt soon showed a special talent for the illustration of old buildings and interiors. With J. G. Jackson he contributed the illustrations to <span class="italic">The Churches of Warwickshire</span>, a survey initiated in 1844 by William Staunton and Matthew Bloxham, and made a series of watercolours of Aston Hall for a book by his friend Alfred Davidson, <span class="italic">A History of the Holtes of Aston</span> (1854). Between 1848 and 1860 he undertook several continental tours to the old towns of Belgium, France, and Germany, and showed watercolours at the Royal Academy in 1857 and 1858, and at other London exhibitions.<br>
<br>In 1857 Everitt joined the Royal Society of Artists in Birmingham, of which he became honorary secretary in 1858, a post that he held until his death. A respected drawing master in the midlands, for many years he taught drawing at the Birmingham Deaf and Dumb Institution, of which he was also virtually the secretary. In 1870 an archaeological section of the Midland Institute was formed, and Everitt was appointed one of the honorary secretaries of what was to become the Birmingham and Warwickshire Archaeological Society, contributing many papers to its <span class="italic">Transactions</span>. He also illustrated J. T. Bunce's <span class="italic">History of Old St. Martin's</span> (1875), the parish church of Birmingham. Everitt was also for some time a member of the general council of the Midland Institute. In June 1880 he accepted the post of honorary curator of the Free Art Gallery, a municipal institution which was the forerunner of the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery.<br>
<br>On 1 May 1880 Everitt married Frances Hudson (<i>b</i>. 1835/6) of Moseley, and they received as a gift from the Society of Artists a magnificent carved and painted cabinet designed by J. H. Chamberlain (known as the Everitt cabinet; Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery). Everitt lived in Edgbaston, first in George Road and from 1855 at The Grove, 28 Frederick Road, where he died, of congestion of the lungs, on 11 June 1882; he was buried in the churchyard of St Bartholomew (Edgbaston Old Church). His very large collection of topographical drawings, invaluable as a record of the appearance of the west midlands in the mid-nineteenth century, is now at the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery.<br>
