<span class="headword">Allen,  Roland</span>  (1868&#150;1947), <span class="occ">missionary and theologian</span>, was born at 104 Friargate, Derby, on 29 December 1868, third son in the family of five sons and two daughters of Charles Fletcher Allen (1835&#150;1873), curate and schoolmaster, and his wife, Priscilla, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Malpas (1839&#150;1935). Of his brothers, Reginald (1863&#150;1948) and Willoughby (1867&#150;1953) attended the Clergy Orphan School (St Edmund's), Canterbury, and became Church of England clergymen. Willoughby, a Hebrew scholar, was twice archdeacon.<br>
<br>After attending King's School, Canterbury (1879&#150;82), and Bristol grammar school (1884&#150;7), Roland won a scholarship to St John's College, Oxford (BA, 1889). He proceeded, with a second in classics and modern history, and the Lothian prize, to Leeds Clergy Training School. But he barely sampled a conventional career, discovering instead the sting of Christ's reference to the prophet without honour in his own country and his own house. His radical understanding of evangelization met with incomprehension in his time. It is acknowledged in diverse denominations today as a seminal response to the post-colonial dissolution of political and religious structures.<br>
<br>In 1895 Allen joined the north China mission of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and in 1900, as chaplain to the British legation, was trapped in Peking (Beijing) by the Boxer uprising. His diary furnished an evocative narrative, <span class="italic">The Siege of the Peking Legations</span> (1901), but three articles in the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span> (November and December 1900 and February 1901) on the causes of the siege and of the &#145;providential&#146; preservation of the legations clarify his reflections on the experience. He accepts the necessity for social change in China, and is blunt about the folly of the court and the superstitious popular ignorance it exploited in its encounter with the foreign pressure for &#145;concessions&#146;. But he is appalled by the imperial brutality of that pressure, and laments the corrupting entanglement of competing missions; for instance the French legation's insistence on political status for the Catholic hierarchy, the abuse of landlord power by missions, and their provocative misuse of political influence with local officials to protect converts involved in private litigation.<br>
<br>On furlough in 1901 Allen married Mary Beatrice Tarleton (1863&#150;1960), daughter of Admiral Sir (John) Walter Tarleton, and returned briefly to China, but left on health grounds. He took his only living, Chalfont St Peter in Buckinghamshire, in 1904, but resigned in 1907 rather than continue extending the sacraments of the church to parishioners who gave no evidence of faith. Briefly a naval chaplain, he survived shipwreck off Whitby in October 1914 and was invalided, and subsequently worked for the Young Men's Christian Association, taught at King's College, Worcester, and thereafter collaborated in the Survey Application Trust, funded by an evangelical businessman whose insights into the contradictions of missionary organization he clarified  (Allen, <span class="italic">James Sidney Wells Clark</span>).<br>
<br>Allen's first significant &#145;prophetic&#146; text, <span class="italic">Missionary Methods: St Paul's or ours?</span> (1912), established the position he reiterated in a long succession of publications, mostly from the World Dominion Press and in church periodicals: Christ commanded, St Luke focuses, and St Paul pursued an <i>apostolic</i> mission, communicating the redeeming energy of the Holy Spirit and helping believers submit themselves to it; Christ said nothing about a trained, professional priesthood, about institutional structures, or about providing health and education; hospitals and schools, though good in themselves, are irrelevant to the Pentecostal message; missions, exhausted by competition for funds, doctors, and teachers, idolize a &#145;progress&#146; to which the Holy Spirit is indifferent; above all, patronizing insistence on a salaried priesthood, however &#145;native&#146;, replicates a deadening past. Christian communities open to the Holy Spirit, however, will identify their own &#145;priests&#146; and thrive in independence. Allen's books <span class="italic">Spontaneous Expansion of the Church</span> (1927) and <span class="italic">The Case for Voluntary Clergy</span> (1930) have been republished several times, especially in the USA.<br>
<br>Allen visited India in the late 1920s. An exasperated George Hubback, bishop of Assam, writing in 1928, finally acknowledged the gulf dividing them. He had been more patient than most, but spoke for other churchmen tormented by Allen's monotonic attentions: &#145;<i>You</i> may hear the voice of our Lord speaking direct to you; others like myself are less highly honoured and have to depend for guidance on those in authority over us&#146;  (D. M. Paton, 1968, 155). A decade after his death, however, Bishop Lesslie Newbigin was drawing attention to the slow but steady increase in the number of those who felt compelled to listen to his message for modern missiology  (Yates, 63).<br>
<br>Travels in east and southern Africa confirmed Allen's alienation from the church as an institution  (<span class="italic">Le Zoute: a Critical Review of Christian Mission in Africa</span>, 1927). In 1932, following his son and daughter, he settled in Kenya. There he performed locum duties, taught himself Swahili, and (with help from his son) translated three of its epic poems into English. He died at his home in Hurlingham Road, Nairobi, on 9 June 1947, and was survived by his wife and two children, Priscilla Mary Allen (1903&#150;1987) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40276/', "John Willoughby Tarleton Allen (1904&#150;1979)")</script>, a colonial educationist and Swahili scholar.<br>
