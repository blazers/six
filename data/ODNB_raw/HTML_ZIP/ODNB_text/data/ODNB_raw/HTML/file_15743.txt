<span class="headword">Knightley, Sir  Edmund</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1542), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was the third son of Sir Richard Knightley (<i>d</i>. 1534) of Lincoln's Inn and Fawsley, Northamptonshire, and Jane, daughter and heir of Henry Skynnerton (or Skennard) of Alderton. He was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1505, and as a barrister served as reader of Strand Inn in 1519. As early as 1515 he was elected to parliament for Reading, and in 1529 was returned for Wilton, though he had no apparent connection with either Berkshire or Wiltshire. In 1520 he made an impressive match with Ursula de Vere (1488&#150;1558), sister and coheir of the fourteenth earl of Oxford, the widow of George Windsor, and from 1522 until 1526 he held the lucrative post of attorney-general to the duchy of Lancaster. On becoming a bencher of the Middle Temple in 1523 he gave a reading on the 1484 <span class="roman">Statute of Uses</span> (1 Ric. III c. 1). He was added to the Northamptonshire commission of the peace in 1524, served on various <i>ad hoc</i> commissions in that county, and was recorder of Coventry in the same period.<br>
<br>Knightley was created serjeant-at-law in November 1531, and became a member of Serjeants' Inn, Fleet Street. The following year he became involved in a dispute with the crown over some property, and after making &#145;proclamations&#146; slandering the king's title was in September 1532 committed to the Fleet by the &#145;lord chancellor&#146; (presumably Lord Keeper Audley). His impetuous behaviour probably prevented his rise to office. In October 1537 Audley proposed him for a judgeship, praising his &#145;great wit and learning&#146; but adding the somewhat qualified recommendation that:<blockquote>though he be wilful and full of fond inventions, yet it is to be thought if ever he will be an honest man that now he hath these great possessions and may have the estimation of a judge, he will leave all his own fancies and become a new man. (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 12/2, no. 805)</blockquote>Cromwell was not minded to attempt the experiment, and Knightley received no further professional advancement. In 1538 he inherited substantial entailed family properties on the death of his elder brother Sir Richard, and rebuilt the great hall at Fawsley. A window panel from Fawsley, with the arms of Knightley impaling Vere, is now in the Burrell collection at Glasgow. Knightley probably gave up practice at the bar about this time. Indeed, in 1539 he asked Cromwell to obtain for him a discharge from the degree of serjeant. Late in life he was knighted, an unusual distinction for a serjeant who was not a king's serjeant. He died on 12 September 1542 and was buried at Fawsley, where his monumental brass represents him in armour rather than in a serjeant's robes. He was survived by his wife, who died in 1558 and was buried at Letheringham, Suffolk; the couple had six daughters, who, it appears, all died in infancy.<br>
