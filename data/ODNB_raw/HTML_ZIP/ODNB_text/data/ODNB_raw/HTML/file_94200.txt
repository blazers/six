<span class="headword">Holland,  Mary Philomena</span>  (1935&#150;2004), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 19 June 1935 at 41 Maison Dieu Road, Dover, Kent, the daughter of Patrick Henry Holland, civil engineer and later civil servant, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Callanan. Her family had originated in Clonakilty, west Cork, but her father was then working in Malaya, where he designed bridges and where her two elder brothers had been born. When her parents returned to the Far East she was dispatched as a very young child to live in co. Cork with an aunt who was a nun. She was subsequently sent to Loreto Convent, Rathfarnham, co. Dublin, and then to a convent at Farnborough, Hampshire. In later years she spoke of having been at convent boarding school &#145;since the age of three&#146;  (personal knowledge). Although the nuns were not unkind to her, she came to feel that the early separation from her parents and siblings brought emotional problems: she spoke of her emotions having been &#145;cauterized&#146; by the experience  (personal knowledge). Throughout her life she was a person of stoical temperament, who never warmed to the &#145;touchy-feely&#146; element in late twentieth-century culture.<br>
<br>Mary Holland's brothers, John and Bill, both became doctors, and she studied briefly for a law degree at King's College, London, but dropped out to become a journalist after winning a competition for young writers with <span class="italic">Vogue</span> magazine at the age of eighteen. She developed in <span class="italic">Vogue</span> her interest in the theatre and the arts, and interviewed such celebrities as Sir Laurence Olivier and Vanessa Redgrave. She also wrote for <span class="italic">Queen</span> magazine and <span class="italic">Plays and Players</span>. Impressed by a profile that she had written of the poet Philip Larkin, David Astor of <span class="italic">The Observer</span> hired her, and he became a mentor in her journalistic development. Initially she wrote about the arts; she stood in as theatre critic for Kenneth Tynan (whom she remembered as being infallibly kind to her) and struck up a warm friendship with Penelope Gilliatt, the film critic and wife of John Osborne. She became for a time fashion editor of <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, in which role she combined aspirational high couture with an eye for a bargain.<br>
<br>On 2 April 1966 Holland married Ronald Trevor Higgins, a 36-year-old diplomat, and son of Robert Higgins, security officer. The wedding reception was held in the crypt of the House of Commons, and Ted Heath was a guest of honour. The couple were posted to Indonesia in 1966, just as the Vietnam War was reaching its height. She was instructed by the Foreign Office never to speak about politics, but to concentrate in her social conversation on &#145;flowers and holidays&#146;  (personal knowledge). She found the role of a diplomat's wife highly frustrating, and finally fled back to London. Ronald Higgins, who was devoted to her, quit his Foreign Office post in an effort to win her back, but by then the marriage had failed.<br>
<br>In 1968, prompted by David Astor, Holland went to Northern Ireland, and found the cause that was to dominate the rest of her life. Her Irish roots were awakened&#151;her parents had been home rule nationalists&#151;and her sense of justice aroused by the situation she found. She became a superb reporter, and each week her by-line on <span class="italic">The Observer</span> grew in authority. Harold Wilson later told her that she had concentrated his mind considerably on the issue. In 1970 she won the international journalist of the year award from the International Press Corporation for her Ulster reporting. She also fell in love with Eamonn McCann (<i>b</i>. 1943), a prominent civil rights activist from Derry, and this too was a true commitment of the heart. They lived together for some years and had a daughter and a son. However, she was ever more drawn to living in Ireland. She parted from McCann in the later 1970s and went to live in Dublin.<br>
<br>Mary Holland covered Northern Ireland for <span class="italic">The Observer</span> from 1968 to 1979, but was fired in the latter year by Conor Cruise O'Brien, the newly appointed editor-in-chief, who felt that her reportage was too coloured by Irish nationalism (a view shared by many Unionists and some English Conservatives) and thus indulgent of the Provisional IRA and their followers. After O'Brien's departure from <span class="italic">The Observer</span> she returned as a columnist. Besides her work for that paper she became an influential columnist for the <span class="italic">Irish Times</span>. She also fronted, with Peter Jay, the politics programme <span class="italic">Weekend World</span> for London Weekend Television, from 1972 to 1988. In 1977 she co-founded, with Vincent Browne, <span class="italic">Magill</span> magazine, published in Dublin. In 1980 her television documentary <span class="italic">Creggan</span>, an account of life on a working-class estate in Derry, won the Prix Italia and British Broadcasting Guild award. Among other awards she was voted, in 1990, &#145;Cork woman of the year&#146;, being called &#145;an illustrious daughter of west Cork&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Times</span>, 12 June 2004): this hugely pleased her.<br>
<br>Mary Holland was a liberal socialist rather than a nationalist&#151;though she was always committed to a united Ireland. She was involved with feminist issues and campaigned for abortion rights before the controversial abortion referendum in Ireland in 1983, and was also an active trade unionist. But the cause of Northern Ireland was always the priority for her, and she predicted, long before it occurred, that one day Ian Paisley would come to the conference table with Sinn F&eacute;in.<br>
<br>The last years of Holland's life were blighted by a degenerative illness, scleroderma, which started with an apparent case of poor circulation. It was a painful illness that she accepted with a mixture of stoicism and acerbic wit. She had a cutting side to her temperament: she could freeze with an ice-cold remark. But she was warm of heart, kind, decent, and honourable. She was not a believing Catholic, though she had been married in church, and she retained a certain affection for the faith symbols of her childhood: she was strangely comforted by the presence of an image of the sacred heart in the hospice where she spent some time during her last months. She died in St Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, on 7 June 2004 and was survived by her daughter, Kitty, and son, Luke. After her death the <span class="italic">Irish Times</span> published a collection of her articles, <span class="italic">How Far We Have Travelled: the Voice of Mary Holland</span> (2004). Her humanist funeral service in Dublin was attended by two Nobel prizewinners, Seamus Heaney and John Hume, among many other dignitaries. Heaney said that, &#145;unusually for a journalist&#146;, she had had an influence on the events of her lifetime. &#145;In the Yeatsian sense, she was one of the &#147;hearers and heartners of the work&#148;, in both the cultural and the political worlds&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Times</span>, 10 June 2004).<br>
<br>Mary Holland was widely acknowledged as an influential political journalist, who was instrumental in bringing to worldwide attention the troubling events in Northern Ireland in the late 1960s. Her critics might have claimed that her initial sympathy for the nationalist underdog was partisan, but at the end of her writing life in the 1990s she was at pains to highlight the loyalist and unionist side of the story. As Seamus Heaney said, her efforts to be fair to all sides were exemplary. &#145;She had a probity that rubbed off on people&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Times</span>, 10 June 2004).<br>
