<span class="headword">Phillips,  Edward</span>  (<em>b. </em>1630, <em>d.</em> in or after 1696), <span class="occ">writer and biographer</span>, was the eldest surviving son of Anne Phillips (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1640), sister of Milton, and her husband, Edward Phillips (1597&#150;1631), secondary of the crown office in the court of chancery. The elder Edward Phillips, whose family had come from Shrewsbury, married Anne Milton on 22 November 1623; the priest who conducted the ceremony at St Stephen Walbrook, London, was Thomas Myriell, who was probably the same person as the musician friend of the elder John Milton, father of the poet. Edward and Anne Phillips had at least five children: John (1625&#150;1629), Anne (1626&#150;1628), the subject of Milton's poem &#145;On the Death of a Fair Infant&#146;), and Elizabeth (1628&#150;1631) were all buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields. The two surviving children were Edward and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22161/', "John Phillips")</script>, both of whom became the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18800/', "John Milton's")</script> pupils.<h2>
<a name="EarlyyearsandeducationunderJohnMilton"></a>Early years and education under John Milton</h2>The first home of Edward Phillips was in the Strand, near Charing Cross, in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields. He may have been born in this house, as Anthony Wood states, but the lack of an entry in the registers of St Martin-in-the-Fields makes it possible that the family had fled the plague in the summer of 1630 and that Edward was born in Shrewsbury (where his paternal grandmother was living in 1630) or Exeter (where his maternal grandfather, John Milton the elder, worked for a time in 1630) or Hammersmith (to which his maternal grandparents had moved early in 1630). The precise date of Edward's birth is not known but the entry in Milton's family <span class="roman">Bible</span> (now in the British Library), to the effect that Edward Phillips was fifteen years old in August 1645, is consistent with Wood's assertion that he was born in August 1630. In August 1631, when Edward was about a year old, his father fell ill, probably of plague. On 12 August 1631 he drew up a will, &#145;being weak in body&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/160/99), and the will was witnessed by John Milton the elder; Phillips died shortly thereafter and was buried in St Martin-in-the-Fields on 25 August. On 5 January 1632 Edward's mother, Anne, married Thomas Agar, her late husband's colleague and &#145;intimate friend&#146;  (Darbishire, 53), at St Dunstan-in-the-East; Agar thus became young Edward's stepfather (and Milton's brother-in-law) and he also succeeded Edward's father as secondary of chancery. Agar was a widower and brought to the new marriage a daughter called Anne, who may be the Anna Eager who was buried in St Martin-in-the-Fields in November 1633. Thomas and Anne had two daughters, stepsisters to Edward and John Phillips: Mary, who was baptized on 10 October 1632 and seems to have died young, and Anne, who was born in 1635 or 1636, since the licence for her marriage to Thomas Moore, issued in December 1662, gives her age as twenty-six. Mary was baptized in Kensington, close to the family home in Brompton, which was the childhood home of Edward and John Phillips.<br>
<br>The poet Milton, Edward's uncle, returned from his journey to Italy in 1639, and early in 1640 he took lodgings in London at the house of a tailor named Russell, in St Bride's Churchyard, near Fleet Street. Anne Agar seems to have died at about this time, and Milton assumed responsibility for the education of his nephews. John boarded with his uncle and Edward became a day pupil in his lodgings. Shortly thereafter Milton moved to a large house in Aldersgate Street and Edward joined his younger brother as a boarder. Half a century later Edward described, in his <span class="italic">Life of Milton</span> (1694), the formidable education that he received from his schoolmaster uncle; the course of study closely resembles the syllabus that Milton set out in his tract <span class="italic">Of Education</span> (1644). Milton taught the boys to sing and instructed them in various languages, beginning with Latin and then proceeding to Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic (&#145;Chaldee&#146;), and Syriac before moving on to Italian and French. Edward's account of his reading in these languages is daunting even by the high standards of that learned age: between the ages of ten and sixteen, he recalled, his Latin reading had included &#145;Cato, Verro, Columella and Palladius; Cornelius Celsus &hellip; a great part of Pliny's <span class="italic">Natural History</span>; Vitruvius his <span class="italic">Architecture</span>; Frontinus his <span class="italic">Stratagems</span> &hellip; Lucretius and Manilius&#146;  (Darbishire, 60). In addition to these classical authors Milton prescribed modern Latin texts for the study of arithmetic, geometry, trigonometry, and astronomy. Greek poets read during this period included Hesiod, Aratus, Dionysius &#145;Periegetes&#146;, Oppian, Quintus Smyrnaeus, and Apollonius Rhodius; Greek prose included Plutarch, Geminus, Xenophon, Pseudo-Aelian, and Polyaenus. Edward read the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span> in Hebrew, the <span class="roman">Targum</span> in Aramaic, and several chapters of <span class="roman">Matthew's gospel</span> in Syriac. He read Giovanni Villani's chronicle of medieval Florence in Italian and Pierre d'Avity's geographical treatise in French. Edward emerged from this education as a competent linguist but nothing in his published writings suggests that he ever developed the scholarly passions or distinction of mind of his uncle.<br>
<br>Late in 1645 the Milton family moved to a house in Barbican, and in 1647 to a house in High Holborn, near Lincoln's Inn Fields; it is likely that Edward remained in his uncle's household throughout this period and that he was still living with the family when Milton was appointed by the council of state to the post of secretary for foreign tongues in March 1649. The appointment entitled Milton to accommodation in Whitehall but he initially lodged next door to the Bullhead tavern at Charing Cross, near Spring Garden; forty-five years later Edward was able to remember that the landlord's name was Thomson, so it seems likely that he remained with the household in this temporary residence, which was only a few yards from his first home. When the apartment at the Scotland Yard end of Whitehall was ready at the end of November, Milton moved in with his household, of which Edward was probably still a member.<h2>
<a name="AmanuensistoMiltonandhackwriter"></a>Amanuensis to Milton and hack writer</h2>Wood records that Edward went up to Oxford &#145;in the beginning of March 1648&#146; (that is, 1649) but the matriculation record shows that he was admitted (or possibly readmitted) to Magdalen Hall on 19 November 1650. In any case he soon left Oxford without a degree, probably on reaching the age of majority in the summer of 1651, when he inherited property in Shrewsbury; his paternal grandmother, Katharine Phillips, had died in Shrewsbury in the summer of 1650, and by July 1651 Edward had moved there to manage his inheritance. He lived in Shrewsbury until 1655, during which time he became acquainted with Gilbert Sheldon, who witnessed three documents for Phillips. He visited London on occasion, serving as an amanuensis to his uncle, who had gone blind; a letter from Milton, dated 13 February 1652 (now in the Staatsarchiv in Oldenburg), is written in Edward's hand, as are several undated entries in Milton's commonplace book (now in the British Library). Phillips also attended concerts given by Henry Lawes, to whom he wrote a poem &#145;Upon his Book of Ayres&#146;, which was published in 1653; Phillips's other surviving poem from this period was prefaced to the <span class="italic">Divine Poems</span> of his friend Thomas Washbourne, which was printed in 1654.<br>
<br>In 1653 Edward began to dispose of his Shrewsbury property, and in the summer of 1655, when most or all of it was sold, he moved to London, where he became a hack writer for the publisher and bookseller Nathaniel Brook. In the second half of 1655 he translated two novels from the Spanish of Juan P&eacute;rez de Montalb&aacute;n as <span class="italic">The Illustrious Shepherdess</span> and <span class="italic">The Imperious Brother</span>, both of which were published in February 1656. His next project was an edition of the poems of William Drummond of Hawthornden, which appeared later in 1656. This is the only work of this period not to have been prepared for Brook; Phillips had been given the manuscript of some sixty of Drummond's poems by Sir John Scott, Drummond's brother-in-law, and he edited the poems and contributed an introduction. In 1658 Phillips published a dictionary called <span class="italic">The New World of English Words</span>, much of which was plundered from the <span class="italic">Glossographia</span> of Thomas Blount, which had been printed in 1656; in 1673 Blount exacted his revenge in <span class="italic">A World of Errors Discovered in the &#145;New World of Words&#146;</span>. Stephen Skinner ridiculed Phillips's philological efforts in his posthumous <span class="italic">Etymologicon Linguae Anglicae</span> (1671), which Phillips subsequently pillaged for later editions of his <span class="italic">World of Words</span>.<br>
<br>In August 1658 Phillips published a light-hearted miscellany entitled <span class="italic">The mysteries of love and eloquence, or, The arts of wooing and complimenting as they are managed in the Spring Garden, Hyde Park and other eminent places</span>, which contains poetry, songs, parlour games, exemplary conversations and letters for courtship, a rhyming dictionary, and an &#145;art of logic&#146;; in the 1699 edition the title was changed to <span class="italic">The Beau's Academy</span>. In 1660 Phillips published an edition of <span class="italic">The Chronicle of the Kings of England</span> by Sir Richard Baker, adding a strongly royalist continuation from 1650 to 1658; for the 1662 edition Phillips extended his chronology to the coronation of Charles II in May 1661, basing his account of the Restoration on George Monck's private papers, which had been entrusted to him by Sir Thomas Clarges, General Monck's brother-in-law.<h2>
<a name="Employmentsandwritings"></a>Employments and writings</h2>From 1662 to 1664 Phillips worked as an assistant to Elias Ashmole, for whom he translated and transcribed documents for Ashmole's treatise on the Order of the Garter; Phillips's distinctive handwriting&#151;a bold cursive script&#151;can be seen throughout the Ashmole papers. During this period he continued to act as an amanuensis for his uncle; several of the corrections to the manuscript of book 1 of <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> (now in the Pierpont Morgan Library) are in his hand. On 24 October 1663 he found employment as a tutor to John Evelyn, son of the diarist, at Sayes Court, near Deptford. The elder Evelyn recorded in his diary that Phillips &#145;was not at all infected by his uncle's principles, tho' brought up by him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of John Evelyn</span>, 162) and describes his son's tutor as &#145;a sober, silent and most harmless person, a little versatile in his studies, understanding many languages, especially the modern&#146;; Phillips seems to have transmitted his understanding of languages to his young charge, who eventually became a translator. In February 1665 Phillips moved to Wilton House in Wiltshire to act as tutor to Philip Herbert (later the seventh earl of Pembroke), son of the fifth earl; according to Evelyn the fifth earl took advantage of Phillips's residence in his household by asking him &#145;to interpret some of the Teutonic philosophy to whose mystical theology the earl was much addicted&#146;. Having left Wilton at some time between 1669 and 1672 Phillips returned to London to work as a writer. In September 1677, on the recommendation of Evelyn, he entered the household of the earl of Arlington, probably at Euston in Suffolk. The earl required &#145;a scholar to reade &amp; entertaine him sometimes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of John Evelyn</span>, 331) as well as a tutor for his daughter Isabella Bennett (the ten-year-old duchess of Grafton, to whom Phillips dedicated the 1678 edition of his <span class="italic">World of Words</span>) and his nephew Henry Bennett, both of whom Phillips instructed in various languages.<br>
<br>In 1670 Phillips published an edition of Johann Buchler's <span class="italic">Sacrarum profanarumque phrasium poeticarum thesaurus</span> (dated 1669), to which he added two original essays in Latin; one is a short treatise on the verse of dramatic poets and the other is a chronological account of poetry from Dante to the present which praises <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> for its sublime subject, pleasant and majestic style, beautiful images, and accomplished natural descriptions, and notes that the poem is believed by its admirers to be a perfect epic poem. In 1675 Phillips published his <span class="italic">Theatrum poetarum</span>, an annotated alphabetical list of poets, allegedly drawn from all ages and cultures, but mostly English; the quality of the volume is very uneven but it includes considered accounts of Shakespeare and Marlowe, a well-written introductory &#145;discourse on poets and poetry&#146;, a panegyric on his brother John, and a reticent allusion to his famous uncle. The following year Phillips published an edition of John Speed's <span class="italic">The Theatre of the Empire of Great Britain</span>, to which he added a geographical and topographical supplement. In 1682 he published <span class="italic">Tractatulus de modo et ratione formandi voces derivativas linguae Latinae</span>, which he translated in 1685 as <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Way and Manner of Forming the Derivatives of the Latin Tongue</span>. Two years later, in 1684, he apparently published two volumes entitled <span class="italic">Enchiridion linguae Latinae, or, A Compendious Latin Dictionary</span> and <span class="italic">Speculum linguae Latinae, or, A Succinct and New Method</span>. Wood describes these books as octavos published in London and says that they &#145;were all or mostly taken from the <span class="italic">Latin Thesaurus</span> writ by Joh. Milton&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>); no copy of either book has ever been found, nor has Milton's thesaurus. In 1685 Phillips published a &#145;Poem on the Coronation of his most Sacred Majesty King James II and his Royal Consort&#146; and a historical romance called <span class="italic">The Minority of St Lewis</span>.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>The personal life of Edward Phillips after 1679 is not well documented. Wood says that after being discharged from the service of the earl of Arlington, Phillips:<blockquote>married a woman with several children, taught school in the Strand near the May-Pole, lived in poor condition (tho' a good master), wrote and translated several things meerly to get a bare livelyhood; was out of employment in 1684 and 85. (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>)</blockquote>These assertions may all be true but, except for the publications, they are not corroborated or supplemented by any other evidence. On 27 October 1673 Thomas Agar, Phillips's stepfather, drew up a will in which he left &pound;200 to Edward Phillips; the two conditions attached to the bequest were that the money only be used in accordance with the advice of the executor and that the bequest would be cancelled if Phillips were to be appointed to the post of the deputy clerk of chancery; in the event the post was given to another of Milton's nephews, Thomas Milton (the son of Christopher Milton), so Edward presumably received the bequest. The first of these conditions may imply that Agar thought that his irregularly employed stepson was incapable of spending the money responsibly; an unconditional bequest was left to Anne and her son Thomas, but John Phillips is not mentioned, nor are the Miltons.<br>
<br>Some time before 1681 Milton's widow passed to Edward Phillips many of his uncle's papers, including an important collection of Milton's state papers, which were written in Latin. Phillips translated these papers and published them as <span class="italic">Letters of State</span> in 1694; he prefaced this collection with his <span class="italic">Life of Mr John Milton</span>, which, despite its inaccuracies and ambiguities, contains many details of Milton's life that would not otherwise be known. He also provided information to John Aubrey and John Toland about his uncle's life, and they used this material in their accounts of Milton. In 1696 Phillips published the fifth edition of his <span class="italic">World of Words</span> and thereafter he disappears from the historical record; his date and place of death are not known. Toland's comment in 1698 (when John Phillips was still alive) that he had &#145;perused the papers of one of [Milton's] nephews, learnt what I could in discourse with the other&#146;  (Darbishire, 85) may imply that by then Edward Phillips had died.<br>
