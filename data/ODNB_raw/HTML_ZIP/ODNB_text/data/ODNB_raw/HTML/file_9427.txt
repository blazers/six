<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Finch,  Daniel</span>, second earl of Nottingham and seventh earl of Winchilsea  (1647&#150;1730), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in London on 2 July 1647, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9433/', "Sir Heneage Finch (1621&#150;1682)")</script> (descendant of the cadet branch of the earls of Winchilsea), solicitor-general (1660), attorney-general (1670), first Baron Finch (1674), lord keeper and lord chancellor (1674&#150;82), and first earl of Nottingham (1681), and Elizabeth Harvey (1627&#150;1676), daughter of Daniel Harvey, a Levant merchant of London.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandcareer"></a>Early life and career</h2>Under his father's watchful rearing, Daniel Finch imbibed Sir Heneage's devout Anglicanism and constitutional royalism, as did his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9435/', "Heneage Finch")</script> (whose own legal and political career was to be capped by elevation to the peerage as earl of Aylesford). Both brothers attended Westminster School, and Daniel was enrolled at the Inner Temple before he matriculated at Christ Church in mid-1662. Three years at Oxford were followed by a version of the grand tour which included Germany, Italy, and France. Most of his three years abroad was spent in Italy, where his uncle Sir John Finch served as English resident at the court of the grand duke of Tuscany. Recalled to London by his father in mid-1668 and promptly elected a fellow of the Royal Society (perhaps through the influence of Sir John and his companion Sir Thomas Baines), Daniel seems to have spent the next four years studying the law and assisting Sir Heneage.<br>
<br>Daniel Finch's first appearance on the public stage came with his return to the Cavalier Parliament at a by-election for Great Bedwyn in early 1673. A year later, on 16 June 1674, he married Lady Essex Rich (1651/2&#150;1684), coheir of Robert Rich, third earl of Warwick, and ward of the pious Mary, countess of Warwick. The marriage negotiations also brought Daniel into contact with George Savile, first marquess of Halifax.<br>
<br>Daniel's marriage to Lady Essex was terminated in March 1684 by her death, eleven days after the birth of her eighth child (though only two survived her). Her successor on 29 December 1685 was Anne Hatton (1668&#150;1743), the seventeen-year-old daughter of Christopher, Viscount Hatton; in early 1687 Anne gave birth to a son, the first of her twenty-two children (at least thirteen of whom were to survive to adulthood, including the diplomatist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9446/', "Edward Finch-Hatton")</script>).<h2>
<a name="Fromtheexclusioncrisistotherevolutionsettlement"></a>From the exclusion crisis to the revolution settlement</h2>After the dissolution of the Cavalier Parliament early in 1679, Daniel served in the three Exclusion Parliaments before succeeding his father as second earl in December 1682. As an MP he distinguished himself by vocal, if sometimes qualified, support for his father's colleague in office between 1674 and early 1679, Thomas Osborne, earl of Danby. After Danby's fall, Daniel (and Halifax) opposed the first earl of Shaftesbury's campaign to exclude James, duke of York, from the line of succession; instead, he advocated that limitations be imposed on any Catholic successor.<br>
<br>As part of Charles II's attempt in the spring of 1679 to blunt the exclusionist thrust by bringing moderates into office, Daniel was named to the commission of the Admiralty (while Halifax was appointed lord president of the council). Daniel lacked experience in naval matters, but from 1680 onwards he took the leading role at the board. However, his efforts were hampered by quarrels with Admiral Arthur Herbert. Subsequently, the board's work was to be much criticized, not altogether fairly, by Samuel Pepys&#151;himself a victim in 1679 of the purge of the duke of York's men from the Admiralty. None the less, Daniel appears to have made a sufficiently positive impression on Charles II to be offered a secretaryship of state after the earl of Sunderland was dismissed in late 1680 for backing exclusion. But he declined this promotion and remained at the Admiralty until May 1684, when the commission was wound up, and Pepys and other old hands were reinstated.<br>
<br>Although James succeeded to the throne peacefully in March 1685 (with Heneage Finch, named solicitor-general, publishing the royal pledge to uphold the established church), Nottingham soon saw his worst fears being realized. Thus, he joined with Halifax and also one-time exclusionists in the second session of the first (and only) parliament of the reign to oppose the appointment of Catholic officers in an army much enlarged in the wake of the duke of Monmouth's abortive rebellion. After the prorogation and later dissolution of this parliament, and with James now determinedly pursuing pro-Catholic measures, Nottingham&#151;as did many other Anglican loyalists&#151;pinned his hopes on the anticipated succession of James's elder daughter, Mary, reared an Anglican and the wife of James's nephew, William, prince of Orange. While James laboured to secure a compliant parliament, Nottingham was made privy to the design to &#145;invite&#146; William to intervene in England, though at the last moment he drew back from that venture. Instead, after the prince's landing in November 1688, Nottingham and Halifax agreed to act on a commission appointed by the king in the vain hope of diverting William's armed progress towards London.<br>
<br>After James's flight to France and the assembly in January 1689 of the convention, Nottingham led a determined, though abortive, campaign in the Lords to preserve a fig leaf of legitimacy by the device of a regency in which William and Mary would rule in James's name. As he explained, his principal concern was to minimize constitutional innovation as well as to salve the consciences of Anglicans unwilling to contemplate James's return yet hostile both to the appearance of election to the throne and to the legitimation of subjects' resistance. When regency was rejected, Nottingham took the lead in formulating a revision of the oath of allegiance so that the scrupulous might acknowledge William and Mary without recognizing them as &#145;lawful and rightful&#146; rulers.<h2>
<a name="Secretaryofstatecomprehensionandtoleration"></a>Secretary of state: comprehension and toleration</h2>In addition, Nottingham&#151;named (with Halifax's backing) as one of the secretaries of state in the new royal administration&#151;revived plans for comprehension of moderate dissenters and for toleration of those nonconformists who could not or would not be comprehended on any conceivable terms. The companion bills that he introduced in the Lords in March 1689 were revisions of those he had drafted as a member of a broad-based Commons' committee in 1680. As earlier, so in 1689 his promotion of comprehension with toleration was primarily to strengthen English protestant unity&#151;thereby frustrating any revival of James's strategy of bidding for dissenting support by espousing a policy of general toleration and by dispensing with the 1673 sacramental test to hold governmental or municipal office. But comprehension foundered on the rock of Anglican distaste at the prospect that newly comprehended moderate dissenters would thereby be qualified to hold office, and in the event only a limited &#145;indulgence&#146; (leaving the sacramental test in place) reached the statute book in May 1689. In this fashion Nottingham was in some measure an unintending contributor to a situation he would later come to deplore of &#145;the Church in danger&#146;&#151;having lost its legal monopoly (and hence no longer able to enforce church attendance in the parishes) and beset by dissenting efforts to repeal the sacramental test or else to evade it by the practice of &#145;occasional conformity&#146; in order to qualify for local office.<br>
<br>For the time being, however, Nottingham&#151;with the backing of the pious Queen Mary&#151;was in a position to influence the choice of new members of the episcopate, thinned by death and also by the defection of incumbents unwilling to swear even the revised oath of allegiance. The resultant vacancies were filled mainly by men from among the circle of moderate Anglicans (the so-called latitudinarians) that the first earl of Nottingham had patronized and with whom his heir had remained in close touch, above all John Tillotson and John Sharp as archbishops of Canterbury and of York respectively.<br>
<br>Although Nottingham had Mary's confidence and William's respect, his tenure as secretary of state was not a success, even though whig excesses in 1689 inclined the king between 1690 and 1693 to rely increasingly on Danby, Nottingham, and their tory associates. On the one hand, the tory ministers had to reckon with persistent whig obstructionism in parliament, with Nottingham repeatedly the target of denunciations as a crypto-Jacobite and with his perorations in the Lords mocked as &#145;the grievance of the times&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems on Affairs of State: Augustian Satirical Verse</span>, ed. G. deForest Lord and others, 7 vols., 1963&#150;75, 5.171 n. 33) both for their pedantry and their extreme length. On the other, Nottingham became, in part by his own readiness to meddle in the conduct of naval affairs (on the strength of his earlier service on the Admiralty board), the scapegoat for English set-backs in the war at sea against Louis XIV. First, the earl fell out with William's most effective naval commander, the whig Admiral Edward Russell, and then he was blamed for the disastrous loss of the Smyrna-bound merchantmen in mid-1693. Thus, William&#151;forced to turn back to the whigs to sustain parliamentary financing of the war&#151;sought and received Nottingham's resignation in November 1693.<br>
<br>For the rest of the reign Nottingham was out of office, and during the mid-1690s he figured as an occasional critic of the whig junto whose hold on office tightened up to the war's end in late 1697. Meanwhile, the death of the marquess of Halifax in early 1695 (only days after Nottingham's daughter Mary married Halifax's son and heir) brought to a close perhaps his oldest friendship. Then, too, the demise of Queen Mary in late 1694 snapped his strongest remaining link with the royal court. Thus, he mounted a determined, if unsuccessful, resistance to the junto-backed association of loyalty to William (as &#145;rightful and lawful&#146; ruler) in the wake of the discovery in early 1696 of a Jacobite assassination plot&#151;prompting the king to strike Nottingham's name (and those of several other opponents of association) from the list of privy councillors. But the principal focus of Nottingham's energies in the years after his loss of the secretaryship was the planning and erection of his great house of Burley on the Hill, Rutland&#151;paid for, in part, by the profits of office.<br>
<br>However, with the treaty of Ryswick and the gradual unravelling of the junto's hold on office, Nottingham's attendance in the Lords revived. Although omitted from the revamped ministry of mid-1700, he took a prominent part in the parliament elected in early 1701 in the tories' bid to impeach the fallen junto ministers. And while supporting strong measures against France in the wake of Louis XIV's repudiation of the second partition treaty and his subsequent recognition of James II's son and heir as king of England, Nottingham vehemently opposed whig efforts in the last parliament of the reign to promote a voluntary oath of abjuration acknowledging William as &#145;lawful and rightful&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Officeandopposition17021714"></a>Office and opposition, 1702&#150;1714</h2>Given Nottingham's prominence among tory peers, his reappointment as secretary of state by Queen Anne, as well as the selection of other leading tories, including the queen's uncle the earl of Rochester and Sir Edward Seymour, came as no surprise: Anne had long been reputed a wholehearted supporter of the church and a foe of the junto's ambitions. However, because Anne's principal confidants were her long-time courtiers the earls of Godolphin and Marlborough (the &#145;duumvirs&#146;), the tory ministers found that they were not able to dictate war strategy or domestic policy. On the one hand, Nottingham&#151;harking back to schemes of the early 1690s&#151;favoured an amphibious strategy (including landings on the French mainland) as against Marlborough's emphasis on the war in the Low Countries. On the other hand, tory expectations of court backing for legislation against the practice of occasional conformity foundered on the rock of the duumvirs' lack of enthusiasm for any measure that might endanger whig parliamentary backing for war supply. Increasingly frustrated, Rochester resigned in 1703 and Nottingham (despite the queen's efforts to dissuade him) followed him out of office in the spring of 1704. At this period he initiated what many believed to be a romantic relationship with the opera singer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8828/', "Francesca Margherita de L'Epine")</script>.<br>
<br>Rochester and Nottingham then lent their backing in the autumn of 1704 to an effort by the tory militants in the Commons to &#145;tack&#146; (attach) a clause against occasional conformity to the <span class="roman">Land Tax Bill</span>. As a &#145;tack&#146; was likely to lead to a stalemate between the two houses that would jeopardize the grant of supply, the court&#151;with Robert Harley functioning as the duumvirs' manager&#151;mobilized a coalition of moderates and whigs to secure its rejection. The consequences were the queen's increasing alienation from the &#145;tackers&#146; and their noble supporters, and Harley's entry into office, to be followed by a number of moderate whigs.<br>
<br>Despite the loss of the &#145;tack&#146;, neither Nottingham nor Rochester was prepared to forswear resistance to the duumvirs and their new colleagues in the revamped ministry. Perhaps the most striking instance of their successive parliamentary campaigns was their scheme, advanced in the autumn of 1705, to invite the electress of Hanover to reside in England. This they justified as necessary to safeguard the &#145;protestant succession&#146; against Jacobite plotting. But the prospect of her putative successor's presence in the realm infuriated Anne, and the duumvirs and Harley, with whig backing, turned the tables on their foes by sponsoring the <span class="roman">Regency Act</span> as a more acceptable and effectual alternative. Other tory tactics proved no more effective in succeeding years, while Harley's falling-out with Godolphin in 1707&#150;8 only made the duumvirs less able to resist junto pressure for added influence in the ministry.<br>
<br>Thus, even when Anne finally dismissed Godolphin in mid-1710 (and in 1711 Marlborough, too), she was not prepared to contemplate having Nottingham back in office. Rather, the &#145;ministerial revolution&#146; of 1710, facilitated by growing war-weariness and the revival of high-church sentiment among the electorate (fuelled by the abortive ministerial impeachment of Dr Henry Sacheverell), was made chiefly by Harley with the queen's backing. His aim was to build a ministry of moderates of both parties, and to avoid those who, like Nottingham, had won the reputation of being &#145;party sense in person without respect to the reason of things&#146;&#151;a reputation which was only reinforced by the earl's association with the October Club and his backing of partisan tory causes in the parliamentary session of 1710&#150;11  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 4.684).<br>
<br>So Nottingham was left out in the cold (though some of his kin were given places), and his frustration&#151;coupled with mounting doubts about the wisdom of Harley's negotiations with France via Jacobite channels&#151;propelled him into the arms of the junto when the ministry laid its peace preliminaries before parliament early in the 1711&#150;12 session. This unlikely alliance of partisan extremes, brokered by Nottingham's son-in-law the duke of Roxburghe, added little to either's repute. And Harley countered effectually by having the queen create a dozen new peers and by conceding the passage of the long-sought legislation against occasional conformity&#151;the measure that had been Nottingham's price for acting with the junto against the preliminaries. None the less, Nottingham had made his bed and he was prepared to lie in it. For the rest of the reign, he sided with the junto while denouncing Jacobite influence in the ministry.<h2>
<a name="TheHanoveriansuccession"></a>The Hanoverian succession</h2>Nottingham received his reward at George I's accession. He was made lord president of the council; his brother Heneage was promoted to the earldom of Aylesford and named chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster; his eldest son, Daniel, was appointed a gentleman of the prince of Wales's bedchamber; and one of his sons-in-law was made a teller of the exchequer. However, other prominent tory adherents of the Hanoverian succession, though offered subordinate places in the new ministry, declined them rather than distance themselves from their fellow tories. So the ministry had a predominantly whig cast, despite Nottingham's efforts to persuade the king and his foreign advisers, as he had formerly preached to William and Mary, that the tories were the better friends to the royal prerogative.<br>
<br>Nor did the alliance between Nottingham and the whig ministers long endure. Their views on many topics diverged, and the whigs were alarmed by the pains he and his son took to &#145;insinuate the Tories&#146; into the favour of the princess of Wales  (<span class="italic">Diary of Mary, Countess Cowper, Lady of the Bedchamber to the Princess of Wales, 1714&#150;20</span>, ed. S. Cowper, 1865, 65). Hence, when the earl came out in February 1716 against the execution of those Scottish peers convicted for their parts in the Jacobite rising of 1715, the whigs were able to secure his dismissal.<br>
<br>So, after nearly four decades of intermittent tenure of office Nottingham was once more in the wilderness. He continued to attend the Lords through the lengthy 1720&#150;21 session (while also unsuccessfully pleading his Savile granddaughters' civil suit for specific performance for the sale of Halifax House before Lord Chancellor Macclesfield, <span class="italic">English Reports</span>, 24.596&#150;7), but in fact he had little room to manoeuvre. Dismayed as he was by the whigs' use of their power, he was still wary to act too closely with those with whom he had broken in 1711 lest he seem to be conceding he had been in error in his breach with the Harley ministry. Yet, he could still claim that if he could not stem the tide that at least &#145;I am not concurring in any measures &hellip; destructive of our constitution in church and state&#146;  (Nottingham to Lord Coningsby, 24 July 1721, BL, Add. MS 57861, fol. 184). Thus, not only did he speak out against the proposed repeal in 1718 of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> but he also turned his hand to draft (with the advice of Dr Daniel Waterland) and to publish in 1721 a lengthy vindication of orthodox trinitarianism when provoked to respond on this much controverted subject by William Whiston.<h2>
<a name="Deathandassessment"></a>Death and assessment</h2>Nottingham succeeded to the senior Finch title of Winchilsea shortly before his own death at Burley on the Hill on new year's day 1730; he was buried at Ravenstone. But it was the accomplishments of his own branch of the family in which he chiefly took pride&#151;not the greater antiquity of the title of the ne'er-do-well senior line. His father had been a distinguished holder of the great seal, and he himself was, after all, the author of the <span class="roman">Act of Toleration</span>, a consistent supporter of the protestant succession, and a steady opponent of French pretensions who recognized, as many tories did not, that Louis XIV must be challenged on the continent as well as at sea. Moreover, if his own long political career was marked as much by frustration as by accomplishment, he did display a constructive capacity at critical junctures&#151;not least during the exclusion crisis and in 1688&#150;9.<br>
<br>None the less, the second earl's official career was marked by repeated disappointment, and his difficulties clearly owed something to his tendency to lapse into stubborn self-righteousness in the face of resistance and his penchant for lecturing the monarchs he served. Indeed, even in his dealings with his fellow tories he was&#151;as Sir Keith Feiling shrewdly observed&#151;&#145;a man not exactly of tangents, but of corners; he consorted with his fellows, but his volubility was self-centred and did not react to common opinion&#146;  (K. G. Feiling, <span class="italic">A History of the Tory Party, 1640&#150;1714</span>, 1924, 259). But the second earl of Nottingham's temperament and his long-winded, legalistic speechifying (hence, the hostile Harley's epithet of Spintext) were hardly the only reasons why the tories never matched the discipline and relative unity of the whig junto and its following nor were able to capitalize fully upon their initial favour first with William and Mary and then with Anne.<br>
<br>Thus, in the post-1714 world, and even perhaps before then, the second earl figures as a smouldering volcano. The future lay with those who could accommodate themselves to the new order&#151;among them, some of the prestigious spouses he found for his daughters, and also his four younger sons (all MPs), who, like many other offspring of long-time tory families, would figure as supporters and beneficiaries of the Walpolean oligarchy. However, his eldest son, Daniel, who succeeded him as eighth earl of Winchilsea (and third earl of Nottingham), though holding household office for the last five years of his father's life, thereafter aligned himself with his friend John Carteret and the &#145;patriot&#146; opposition.<br>
