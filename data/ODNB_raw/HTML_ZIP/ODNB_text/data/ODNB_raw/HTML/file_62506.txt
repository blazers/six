<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thornely, Sir  Arnold</span>  (1870&#150;1953), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 7 October 1870 at Green Hill, Godley, Cheshire, the second of the seven children of James Thornely (<i>b</i>. 1844/5), a cotton mill manager, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harris (<i>b</i>. 1846/7). He was educated at Dunesville School in Birkdale, Tideswell grammar school in Derbyshire, and the Liverpool School of Art. Between 1887 and 1891 he was articled to the Liverpool architects Francis Usher Holmes and George Holme. Thornely then worked as an assistant to William Edward Willink (1856&#150;1924) and Philip Coldwell Thicknesse (1860&#150;1920), and two years later he was elected an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects. In 1898 he began his own practice in Liverpool and in 1906 joined Frank Gatley Briggs (1862&#150;1921) and Henry Vernon Wolstenholme (1863&#150;1936) in partnership as Gatley, Wolstenholme and Thornely and later with F. B. Hobbs (1862&#150;1944) as Hobbs, Thornely, Briggs and Wolstenholme. After the deaths of Briggs and Wolstenholme, Thornely continued in partnership (from 1925 to 1943) with his elder brother Herbert Lionel Thornely (1868&#150;1944), with offices in the Royal Liver Building, Liverpool. On 28 August 1902 at St Paul's Church, Helsby, Cheshire, he married Caroline Thornely (1870&#150;1962), daughter of Frederick Thornely, with whom he had two children, Ronald and Ethel Mary.<br>
<br>Though Thornely is now best known for Parliament Buildings at Stormont in Belfast, the largest part of his architectural career was spent in and around Liverpool, where in his several partnerships he was responsible for a number of prominent public buildings. With F. B. Hobbs he designed the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board Building (1903&#150;7), a large rectangular baroque block with four polygonal corner turrets and a central copper-covered dome. Now known as the Port of Liverpool Building, it was the first of three structures on the city's pier head, the others being the Royal Liver Building (1908&#150;11, Walter Aubrey Thomas) and the Cunard Building (1914&#150;16, Herbert J. Rowse), that subsequently formed a prominent city landmark widely known as the &#145;three graces&#146;. This was followed by the Bank of British West Africa, or West Africa House (completed 1920, with Briggs and Wolstenholme), a Portland stone block displaying the American classicism then fashionable in Liverpool with Charles Reilly, the university's professor of architecture, and his students. American influences were again evident in the India Buildings (completed 1930, with Rowse), a nine-storey structure with Italian Renaissance detailing that occupied a complete block of the city. With Briggs and Wolstenholme, Thornely's other Liverpool designs included the Jane Herdman laboratories for the geology department of Liverpool University (1927&#150;9) and a sizeable extension to the Walker Art Gallery (1931&#150;3). Elected a fellow of the RIBA in 1907, he served on its council between 1910 and 1911, in which years he was also president of the Liverpool Architectural Society.<br>
<br>Beyond the centre of Liverpool Thornely (together with Briggs and Wolstenholme) designed new premises for the Blue Coat School at Wavertree (1906) and King Edward VII Grammar School, Lytham (1908), as well as a series of private houses&#151;including his own, The Homestead, Mount Wood, Prenton, Cheshire&#151;and the town halls at Wallasey (1914&#150;19), Preston, and Barnsley (both 1933). The latter project subsequently prompted criticism from George Orwell, who questioned why &#145;so many of the northern towns see fit to build themselves immense and luxurious public buildings at the same time as they are in crying need of dwelling houses&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Road to Wigan Pier</span>, 1937, 61).<br>
<br>Though many of Thornely's Liverpool commissions arose from his success in competition, his best-known work, Parliament Buildings, Stormont, was the result of a direct invitation in 1921 from the British first commissioner of works. This came a year after the <span class="roman">Government of Ireland Act</span> had partitioned the island of Ireland and made it necessary for the newly created Northern Ireland to have its own parliament house, buildings for government departments, and a high court of justice&#151;the latter being designed by James Grey West (1881&#150;1951) and built in central Belfast. Consideration was initially given to three other sites for the new parliament, Belfast Castle, Orangefield, and Belvoir Park. When Stormont Castle was put up for sale the Northern Ireland government purchased the 300 acre estate and house for &pound;20,334 in December 1921. The original plan was for a classical style domed parliament house flanked by two government buildings (hence the plurality of its name), with Thornely responsible for the parliament and Ralph Knott&#151;architect of London's City Hall&#151;for the government offices. However, rising costs led the British Treasury to insist in November 1925 on a more modest design, in which Thornely combined the parliament and government offices in a single non-domed building while Knott oversaw the speaker's house on the Stormont site. The estate and grounds were designed by William Jackson Bean, a former curator of Kew Gardens, with the horticulturist Hugh Armytage Moore. The governor of Northern Ireland, James Hamilton, third duke of Abercorn, laid the foundation stone in 1928 and Parliament Buildings&#151;constructed by Stewart and Partners&#151;was occupied in April 1931 and opened by the prince of Wales on 16 November 1932. On the same day Thornely was gazetted a knighthood for his services to architecture and in 1933 he received the RIBA bronze medal for Ulster.<br>
<br>Situated at the end of a three-quarter mile straight avenue, Thornely's Parliament Buildings was purposefully imposing and impressive. Articulating a &#145;sombre and dignified strength&#146;, the design derived from a Palladian house &#145;with the portico raised on a rusticated ground floor and the principal decoration concentrated about the first floor windows&#146;  (Dixon, 82). It is a building resplendent with Italian marble work, and dominated by a sculptured pediment above a portico with six Ionic columns rising through three storeys. The figure of Britannia flanked by lions surmounts a lavishly decorated attic storey and, like several of Thornely's other large-scale public buildings, it is strikingly faced in Portland stone. This aspect of the building was significantly altered during the Second World War, when, acting as an operations base for the RAF, Parliament Buildings was camouflaged with cow dung and bitumen, damaging the stonework and dulling its appearance. To <span class="italic">The Times</span>'s architectural correspondent Thornely's design was &#145;uncompromising, though not in the least aggressive&#146;, able to &#145;command respect rather than inspire architectural enthusiasm&#146;  (14 Nov 1932).<br>
<br>Until prorogation in 1972 members of the Northern Ireland (Unionist) government regarded Parliament Buildings not just as the location of their parliamentary sessions but as a monumental architectural symbol underlining the connection of the state to Great Britain. This is most visibly expressed in the sculptured tympanum (designed, along with the rest of the statuary, by Thornely), which may be interpreted either as Northern Ireland handing the flame of loyalty to Britain, or Britain handing the flame of liberty to Northern Ireland. At the opening ceremony Lord Craigavon, Northern Ireland's first prime minister, described Thornely's design as &#145;a noble building &hellip; a symbol of the link between Great Britain and Northern Ireland&#146;, and &#145;a memorial not only to the distinguished Architect but also to the enterprise and skill of the Ulster working man&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 17 Nov 1932). However, others were less welcoming. Parliament Buildings was widely criticized by contemporaries in Northern Ireland, both nationalists and independent unionists, with the Catholic <span class="italic">Irish News</span> publishing a stinging political attack in a special supplement, &#145;The truth about Stormont&#146; (January 1933), which condemned its expense at a time of severe depression. Opened only a month after the cross-community outdoor relief riots in Belfast, Parliament Buildings eventually cost &pound;1,150,000.<br>
<br>How Thornely's design has been viewed has been indelibly linked to Leonard Stansford Merrifield's statue of the former leader of Ulster Unionism, Edward Carson, which was unveiled in front of Parliament Buildings in July 1933. Merrifield also created the statue of Lord Craigavon installed at the top of the staircase in the main foyer in October 1945. Craigavon's sarcophagus was placed to the east of the building in 1940, an act that led his biographer St John Ervine to comment that one symbol of the Northern Ireland state's security had joined the other. Between 1973 and 1998 Parliament Buildings housed the Northern Ireland civil service and in 1995 the original Commons chamber was destroyed by fire. Subsequently remodelled, it has served as the chamber of the Northern Ireland Assembly since 1998.<br>
<br>Sir Arnold Thornely spent his later life at Greystones, Eaton Park Road, Fairmile, Cobham, Surrey, where he died on 1 October 1953, survived by his wife and children. In its obituary <span class="italic">The Times</span> noted that Thornely's architecture &#145;was distinguished by robust masculinity in the handling of the English Renaissance&#146;, but admitted that his style of classical architecture &#145;came at the end rather than at the beginning of a period&#146;  (3 Oct 1953). While his death merited only passing mention in the Belfast press Thornely's Parliament Buildings has been of lasting significance to Northern Ireland.<br>
