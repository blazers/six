<span class="headword">Arnold,  Elizabeth</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1616), <span class="occ">translator</span>, may have been the daughter of William Arnold of Cromer, Norfolk, whose genealogical line was recorded by the visitation of the Society of Heralds to Norfolk in 1613, although no details of her birth, death, and family are known. Arnold translated and annotated a short essay from Spanish, which prefaces Thomas Tuke's <span class="italic">A Treatise Against Painting and Tincturing of Men and Women</span> (1616). There is no clue as to her biography in the prefatory material, nor did she translate texts for any of Tuke's other works. Tuke was &#145;minister of God's word&#146; at St Giles-in-the-Fields in 1616, and dedicated several of his works at this time to Lady Alicia Dudley, who lived in Clerkenwell, and so it is possible that Arnold had some local Clerkenwell connection, although there is no documentary evidence yet to support this hypothesis. She was evidently well educated and literate.<br>
<br>Arnold's text is one of a number of contributions with which Tuke prefaces his treatise. The other contributions are all poems by a medley of contemporary poets, R. Jackson, Thomas Farnaby, Robert Felton, Thomas Drayton, Edward Tyleman, and Josuah Sylvester. Tuke's literary connections were thus extensive, and suggest that Arnold had at least access to the fringes of a puritan literary circle.<br>
<br>The text Arnold translates is what she describes as an &#145;invective against the painting of women&#146; from book 5, chapter 62, of Andres de Laguna's <span class="italic">Pedacio Dioscorides Anazarbeo acerca de la materia medicinal y de los venenos moriteros, traduzido de lengua griega en la vulgar castiliana y illustrado con claras substantiales</span> (1570), referred to in English by Arnold as his &#145;annotations upon Dioscorides&#146;. The main body of her translation from the Spanish is a lucid and exact transcription from the original. However, she does add a brief commentary when she links two parts of Dioscorides' commentary together: &#145;Now that you may know that he flouteth his countrywomen, hear what he saith of this&#146;, proceeding to include an additional translation from a different part of the annotations, an account of the dangerous chemicals Spanish women use, which age and eat at their faces. It is clear from this linking commentary that Arnold both organized and structured her translation to make her polemical points against the dangers and pitfalls of cosmetics more powerful.<br>
<br>Tuke's use of a woman's translation of an invective against cosmetics enabled his <span class="italic">Treatise Against Painting</span> to avoid potential charges of misogyny, and both his main text and Arnold's translation focus on the physical, chemical damage of cosmetics and the theological tradition of linking cosmetics with devilish practices. Arnold's willingness to undertake such a translation for Tuke, a well-known Calvinist preacher, suggests that both her personal views and family circumstances were sympathetic to the puritan wing of the Jacobean church.<br>
