<span class="headword">Chisnall,  (James) Arthur White</span>  (1925&#150;2006), <span class="occ">social worker and club and concert promoter</span>, was born on 3 June 1925 at 33 Birkenhead Avenue, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, the son of Elizabeth Goater Chisnall, of no fixed occupation, then residing at 7 Cambridge Road, Kingston upon Thames. The identity of his father was never confirmed, although as an adult he speculated that his father was a local shopkeeper to whom he was sent as a young boy with an empty basket and a note from his mother. The man would look him over and then fill the basket and send him on his way. The young Chisnall spent his earliest years living with his mother in his maternal grandparents' home. George and Rosella Chisnall ran a shop in Kingston. By the end of 1930 both had died. Chisnall took the death of his grandfather particularly badly, describing it as a &#145;major trauma&#146;  (personal knowledge). His mother continued to run the family shop for several years and sent him to a local church school. He struggled through his education; although left-handed, he was forced to write with right-handed pens and was scolded &#145;for spoiling charitably given church property&#146;  (ibid.). He left at fourteen. His first job was working for the carpet department of a Kingston-based store, Hide &amp; Co. In 1942 he volunteered for military service and joined the Royal Engineers. He served in a specialist communications unit in north Africa and took part in Field Marshal Montgomery's operation Bertram, which saw him involved in the deployment of dummy tanks in the largest deception plan of the desert war.<br>
<br>After demobilization Chisnall was employed on the groundnut scheme in Tanganyika; there he formed a jazz club in Nachingwea. He returned to England in 1951 and took a course in social science at Coleg Harlech in Merioneth. His interest in social trends and what was happening to the post-war generation took on more impetus after he returned in 1952 to Kingston, where he initially worked in a junk shop. At the same time he joined a group of academics, among them Leslie T. Wilkins of the Home Office research unit, and Brian Lewis, later deputy director of the Institute of Educational Technology at the Open University, who were interested in the views and problems of young people; several believed that the impact of two world wars had created a gap in the nation's cultural heritage and structure, which left a generation of young people lost and alienated from society.<br>
<br>Through his work in the junk shop in Kingston Chisnall had witnessed the popularity of jazz and blues records among students from the various arts schools, and decided to utilize this in his social research. In 1956 he convinced Michael Snapper, the owner of the dilapidated hotel on Eel Pie Island, just down the River Thames from Kingston, to give him free rein to organize music sessions on Wednesday and Sunday nights. (Snapper had started letting out the hotel's ballroom to jazz musicians a few months earlier.) He started by booking traditional jazz musicians like Ken Colyer, Cy Laurie, George Melly, Acker Bilk, and the Temperance Seven. The hotel's secluded location (initially it could be reached only by a small ferry, though this was soon replaced by a footbridge) and Chisnall's supportive attitude towards the emerging rhythm 'n' blues scene helped nurture many artists who went on to revolutionize pop culture. At the hotel musicians could experiment with their song styles and band line-ups, and play for an audience who, like them, wanted to change the world. Chisnall booked the Rolling Stones in 1963 (all members of the band having previously played on the island as part of other outfits). He also gave stage time to such up-and-coming British rhythm 'n' blues bands as the Cyril Davies All Stars, the Yardbirds, John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, the Artwoods, the Downliners Sect, Jeff Beck and the Tridents, and Long John Baldry and his Hoochie Coochie Men (featuring the young Rod Stewart).<br>
<br>Chisnall never saw the club as a commercial operation: he booked bands primarily to attract young people into the club so that he and other members of his social research group could help them to write CVs and apply for grants and entry to colleges and universities. He would later be described as an outreach social worker, although he attracted young people to him by using what he referred to as the &#145;carrier wave&#146;, popular music, rather than going out to find them himself  (personal knowledge). There was a network of people whom he invited to Eel Pie Island to talk to the clubbers and to encourage them to develop their potential; politicians, scientists, and policy makers thus mixed with art students and young music fans at the island's gigs. Chisnall himself steered many young people towards higher education, several going to Coleg Harlech, which became well known as a &#145;second chance&#146; college, often for people who for economic or social reasons had never had a first chance of a university education. An altruistic man, he used his own time and the little money he had to run a social club that almost incidentally became fertile ground for talented bands to showcase their music.<br>
<br>By 1967 the shabby hotel was in urgent need of repair, and since neither Chisnall nor Snapper could afford the estimated &pound;200,000 cost, the police forced its closure. (It briefly reopened as Colonel Barefoot's Rock Garden in 1969 before being occupied as an anarchist commune and then being destroyed by fire in 1971). In the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s Chisnall continued to work in social research and for the BIT Information Service in London (formed by supporters of the <span class="italic">International Times</span>), which provided a range of information to young people, published a number of alternative travel guides, and nurtured the British Communes Network. In addition, it helped and supported the <span class="italic">Arts Lab Newsletter</span>, the Community Levy for Alternative Projects (CLAP), and Cope, an anti-psychiatry information and help service. In 1974, with Brian Lewis and Auriol Hall, he published <span class="italic">Unattached Youth</span>, based on a study commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust. His last years were spent in Strawberry Hill, Twickenham. He died on 28 December 2006 at the Princess Alice Hospice, Esher, Surrey, of cancer. He was survived by his wife, Susanne Fischer, a decorator.<br>
