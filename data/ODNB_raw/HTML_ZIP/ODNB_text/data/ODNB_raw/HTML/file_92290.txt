<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clayton,  John</span>  (1792&#150;1890), <span class="occ">civic leader and antiquary</span>, was born on 10 June 1792 at Newcastle upon Tyne, the fourth child and third son of Nathaniel Clayton (1760&#150;1832), town clerk and solicitor, and his wife, Dorothy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Atkinson (1764&#150;1827), daughter of George and Bridget Atkinson, of Temple Sowerby, Westmorland. Clayton was baptized at St John's Church, Newcastle, on 24 November 1792, close to the family's home, Westgate House, Fenkle Street. He was educated at Kirkoswald School, Northumberland, and at Uppingham School where he developed a lifelong affinity for the classical world, becoming proficient in Greek and Latin. Clayton's classical interests, which led him to become a noted collector and conserver of Roman artefacts, may have derived in part from his maternal grandmother, Bridget Atkinson. She was made an honorary member of the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne on its foundation in 1813. John likewise became a member in 1832 and was an active participant, publishing many papers in the society's journal, <span class="italic">Archaeologia Aeliana</span>.<br>
<br>In 1809 Clayton was articled as a clerk in his father's firm and qualified as a solicitor five years later. He worked for a time with his father before taking over&#151;with his brothers Matthew and Michael&#151;what at his death was among the &#145;largest and most extensive legal practices in the North of England&#146;  (&#145;In memoriam&#146;, <span class="italic">Daily Journal</span>, 1890, 8). Clayton became under-sheriff in 1816 and succeeded his father as Newcastle's town clerk in 1822&#151;a post for which Nathaniel had paid &pound;2100 in 1785 and in which capacity his son served until June 1867. This was one of many offices held by Clayton, often as clerk, in Newcastle and the surrounding region.<br>
<br>From the mid-1820s Clayton&#151;in association with the speculative builder Richard Grainger and the architect John Dobson&#151;played an important role in the development of central Newcastle. Grainger's early schemes&#151;at Blackett Street (1824), Eldon Square (1825&#150;31, to Dobson's design), and Leazes Terrace (1829&#150;34)&#151;were followed with his construction, between 1834 and 1840, of a new market, commercial area, and street plan on the central site of Anderson Place. From September 1826 Clayton was one of Grainger's principal investors, with loans of &pound;4000 for the construction of Eldon Square and &pound;7500 in 1832&#150;3, and he acted as the builder's legal adviser from as early as March 1827. Clayton subsequently championed Grainger's substantial and innovative plan to rebuild the city centre and, in his capacity as town clerk, pressed for its acceptance by Newcastle's common council in July 1834. Between July 1835 and November 1838 he contributed a further &pound;7500 to the project while encouraging prominent city figures, and family members, to provide additional loans. Grainger's scheme made Newcastle &#145;the best designed Victorian town in England&#146;  (Pevsner, 56) with Clayton one of the &#145;three men who transformed the town's landscape &hellip; and gave to Newcastle a planned late Georgian elegance&#146;  (Wilkes and Dodds, 22). However, following this success Grainger overreached himself and in 1841 he was saved from bankruptcy only by Clayton's covert negotiations; the latter's involvement with Grainger's financial affairs would continue until after the builder's death in 1861.<br>
<br>In addition to civic development, Clayton was heavily involved in plans for the creation of the Newcastle to Carlisle Railway which began to carry passengers from 1836. Having taken its proceedings before a Commons committee in the late 1820s, he served as the company's legal adviser in which capacity&#151;and though not on the board&#151;he &#145;wielded more power than most directors&#146;  (Fawcett, 23). With members of the city council, Clayton also opposed, unsuccessfully, the <span class="roman">Tyne Improvement Bill</span> of 1850. This resulted in Newcastle losing its sole claim to dues from river trade which were subsequently divided with Gateshead, South Shields, and Tynemouth in return for a shared commitment to river maintenance. Clayton served as clerk to the conservancy commission until 1873.<br>
<br>A long-serving, prosperous, and powerful civic leader, Clayton attracted diverse opinions. An anonymous biographical sketch from 1838 described how his &#145;great talents, indefatigable industry, immense wealth, and wonderful tact and facility in conducting business&#146; had given him &#145;an influence in society rarely possessed by one individual&#146;, though he displayed &#145;the craft and subtlety of the devil&#146;  (<span class="italic">Corporation Annual</span>, 57). Seventeen years later, and still in power, Clayton was described in a revised set of sketches as a &#145;Sphinx in the desert&#146;, resistant to political reform and modernization  (<span class="italic">Second Series</span>, iii&#150;iv). Others resented Clayton's dominance of the corporation and his effect as a &#145;dead weight upon the town&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sketches of Public Men</span>, 78). Clayton Street, part of Richard Grainger's rebuilding of central Newcastle, is named for him.<br>
<br>On his father's death in 1832 Clayton inherited the family's country estate of Chesters, near Hexham, which incorporated the site of Cilurnum, Chesters Roman fort. He now combined his civic and legal duties with studying and conserving Chesters and neighbouring Roman sites which he purchased in &#145;one of the first acts of deliberate archaeological conservation in the world&#146;  (Woodside and Crow, 84). From 1834 he began to purchase land along Hadrian's Wall, beginning with Steel Rigg, to which he added Cawfields (1844), Shield on the Wall (1848), and East Cawfields in 1874. In 1838 Clayton acquired Housesteads Farm, which included the Roman fort of Vercovicium, following this with the forts at Carrawburgh (Procolitia), Chesterholm (Vindolanda), and Carvoran (Magna).<br>
<br>Clayton's extension of his estate ran hand in hand with an annual programme of excavation. This began at Chesters in 1843, where he uncovered much of the site of Cilurnum, and was followed six years later by surveys at Housesteads and along what came to be known as the Clayton Wall; this led, as at Cawfields Milecastle (excavated between 1848 and 1851), to Clayton's important discovery that the wall comprised regular gateways in its structure. The finds were brought to Chesters and stored in the mansion, verandah, and the summer (or &#145;antiquities&#146;) house. By Clayton's death the collection numbered 11,000 items, including 95 altars and 53 centurial stones, as well as ceramics, tools, and coins. In recording and publicizing the excavations&#151;principally to members of Newcastle's Society of Antiquaries&#151;Clayton worked closely with John Collingwood Bruce who had first visited the wall's central section in 1848 and whose study, <span class="italic">The Roman Wall</span> (1851), was dedicated to Clayton. Both men identified the wall to be the work of Hadrian and not the emperor Severus, as some maintained at this time. Clayton also collaborated with the numismatist Charles Roach Smith on the coin collection at Chesters and corresponded with the German classical scholars Emil H&uuml;bner and Theodor Mommsen; he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in February 1866.<br>
<br>Alongside excavation and collection, Clayton had sections of Hadrian's Wall cleared of rubble to expose the original Roman core and surviving masonry courses, and then rebuilt using the Roman stone; he also instructed that his stretch of the wall be sealed with a turf cap&#151;a practice applied to other sections during conservation work in the twentieth century. Clayton's decision to end quarrying and the reuse of Roman stone in new buildings also saved large sections from destruction and is considered by modern conservationists to be &#145;one of the most important factors in the survival of the Wall&#146;  (Grenville and others, 15). In a bid to improve the site, Clayton also had a number of farm buildings relocated further away from the wall&#151;as at Housesteads, Peel Cottage, and Shield on the Wall where the house had previously occupied the site of Milecastle 41 on Melkridge Common. In addition, large areas of land close to the wall were drained and given over to the grazing of livestock.<br>
<br>John Clayton died, unmarried, on 14 July 1890, at Chesters, having outlived all but one of his eleven siblings. The estate passed to his nephew Nathaniel George Clayton (1833&#150;1895) and building work on a museum at Chesters began shortly afterwards. In 1929 the estate was put on the market with the farms along Hadrian's Wall offered for sale as separate properties. Housesteads was not sold, however, and in January 1930 the fort was given to the National Trust; four years later the farm's land was also presented to the trust by the historian G. M. Trevelyan. In the early twenty-first century the Clayton collection at Chesters Roman Fort and Museum&#151;under the care of English Heritage&#151;remains an internationally recognized site of Roman history and Victorian collecting practices.<br>
