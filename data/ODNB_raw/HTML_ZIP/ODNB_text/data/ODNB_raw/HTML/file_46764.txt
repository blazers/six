<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sykes, Sir  Alan John</span>  (1868&#150;1950), <span class="occ">industrialist and politician</span>, was born on 11 April 1868 at Cringle House, Cheadle, Cheshire, the second son of Thomas Hardcastle Sykes (1833&#150;1901), a bleacher, and his wife, Mary, the eldest daughter of John Platt, a machine manufacturer of Oldham and his wife, Alice. He was educated at Rugby School and Oriel College, Oxford, where he imbibed a strong sense of duty and a lasting attachment to freemasonry. Sykes served his apprenticeship in the long-established family bleachworks, Sykes &amp; Co., at Stockport, but also occasionally visited Canada to oversee the family's farm there, the largest in Saskatchewan. He took over management of the bleachworks in 1900, when the firm joined the Bleachers' Association, one of the three large mergers which transformed the structure of the textile finishing industry. He acted as secretary of the formation committee of the Bleachers' Association and was a founder director, but in 1908 retired from the management of Sykes &amp; Co.<br>
<br>Increasingly Sykes's energies were absorbed in local political and social affairs, while he still undertook much foreign travel, including motoring to Russia. He was adopted as Conservative candidate for Knutsford in 1907 and became a leading Conservative organizer in the north-west, helping to rebuild the party in the face of the strong local challenges of Labour and the new Liberalism. A keen tariff-reformer, in January 1910 Sykes won Knutsford (ironically defeating a fellow director of the Bleachers' Association), which he retained in December 1910. In 1912 he had gained control of the Stockport-based Swain group of newspapers in order to create a reliable organ of toryism, a result secured for the next generation by the setting up of the Sir Alan Sykes Trust in 1943.<br>
<br>Within parliament, Sykes's main interest lay in his vigorous support of Britain's voluntary defence forces, both before and during the First World War. He was a member of the Officers' Training Corps at Oxford and commanded the 6th battalion, the Cheshire regiment from 1911 to 1914. Although he was unfit for active service in 1914, as an influential social leader he devoted himself enthusiastically to the volunteer movement during the war. He also acted as a government commissioner reviewing alien permits. He received a baronetcy in July 1917. In the House of Commons, however, Sykes had made little mark, and although he was re-elected in 1918 he resigned his seat in 1922 on grounds of ill health. Already holding &#145;more offices than he can remember&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian Commercial</span>, 17 May 1923), he continued to play an important part in the networks of regional Conservatism, as <i>inter alia</i> chairman of the Cheshire division of the national union, treasurer of the North-West Provincial Conservative Association (1933&#150;47), and chairman of the Knutsford Conservative Association (1922&#150;46).<br>
<br>However, in 1916 Sykes's public stature as well as his industrial experience recommended him as chairman of the Bleachers' Association, which by 1914 had succeeded in gaining control of some two-thirds of the British market in cotton bleaching and employed some 13,000 operatives in what was now a reasonably profitable modern corporate enterprise. Having been heavily engaged in munitions production, the Bleachers' Association was well placed after the war to consolidate its market share and buy up competitors (between 1918 and 1927 twenty-one firms were acquired at a cost of some &pound;1.99 million). This enabled it to maintain high prices, to an extent which, some believed, jeopardized British exports, now facing strong overseas competition. Sykes's own industrial philosophy was perhaps best seen in the enlightened welfare policy the firm adopted, with generous pensions provision, recreational facilities, and two model villages on garden city lines. The relative success of the Bleachers' Association was also well advertised by its showpiece headquarters, Blackfriars House, Manchester, opened in 1926.<br>
<br>From 1926 the firm's fortunes were steadily eroded, especially after 1929 as the market for British exports of bleached white goods plummeted. This required a new strategy for survival, which owed most to the firm's managing director Sir William Clare Lees. As chairman, however, Sykes supported within the firm the need for cost-cutting rationalization of production, technological modernization, overseas investment (in partnership with the Calico Printers and Bradford Dyers), and diversification beyond bleaching. Outside the firm he urged the importance of imperial trade and industrial protection, and was gradually won over to the need for governmental intervention in the cotton trade; he supported the <span class="roman">Cotton Industry (Reorganization) Act</span> of 1939. After 1945, while a critic of some aspects of planning, he welcomed the Labour government's export drive as the means to restore profits and dividends. Sykes remained chairman of the firm until his death, three weeks short of its fiftieth anniversary. He was also a director of Williams and Glyn's Bank (1918&#150;48), an early supporter of the Federation of British Industries, and president for many years of the Lancashire and Cheshire Economic League.<br>
<br>Following family tradition, Sykes was a pre-eminent leader in the local community. He was a county magistrate from 1897 until 1950, the first chairman of the Cheshire police authority, and mayor of Stockport in 1910. He contributed largely to the success of Stockport grammar school as chairman of its governors (1921&#150;50) and perhaps above all to Stockport Infirmary, the board of which he joined in 1897 and which he chaired between 1918 and 1948. Among other offices, he was chairman of the Manchester Northern Hospital (1928&#150;48), of the Ephraim Hallam Trust in Stockport, and of the Oldham Blue Coat School. He thus well exemplified the voluntary ethic whose undermining he regretted with the growing welfare provision by the state after 1945.<br>
<br>Even so this public face concealed a shy, retiring man, whose main satisfaction, one suspects, may well have been derived from the hidden world of the freemasons. Here Sykes held a panoply of offices, ranging from grand deacon in the grand lodge of England in 1907 to that (in which he succeeded in 1948 the seventeenth earl of Derby) of grand superintendent of the Lancashire (east division) provincial grand chapter of the Royal Arch masons. Most at home in the mess, the boardroom, and the lodge, Sykes was a confirmed bachelor with a taste for yellow Rolls-Royces and annual gastronomic tours of France. At his home, South View, Cheadle, in suburban south Manchester, he lived with an excellent cook, a well-stocked cellar, and a number of loyal retainers. He died there on 21 May 1950.<br>
