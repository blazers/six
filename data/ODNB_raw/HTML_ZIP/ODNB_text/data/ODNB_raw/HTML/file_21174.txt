<span class="headword">Palmer,  Arthur</span>  (1841&#150;1897), <span class="occ">classical scholar and critic</span>, was born at Guelph, Ontario, Canada, on 14 September 1841, the sixth child of the Ven. Arthur Palmer, archdeacon of Toronto, and his first wife, Hester Madeline Crawford. He was educated first by his father, then at the grammar school, Guelph, under the Revd Edward Stewart, leaving there after about four years in 1856. In 1858 he went to Cheltenham College, where he remained less than a year and had, as he used to say, &#145;just a sweet taste of English public school life&#146;. He entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1859, obtained a university scholarship in 1861, and in 1863 he graduated with senior moderatorship and gold medal in classics, as well as a junior moderatorship and silver medal in experimental and natural science. In 1867 he was elected a fellow, and in 1880 succeeded Professor Tyrrell in the chair of Latin. In 1888 he succeeded Judge Webb as public orator. He was MA (1867) and LittD of his own university, and honorary LLD of Glasgow (1890) and DCL of Oxford (1894). From 1867 to 1880 he was a college tutor, and as such exercised a marked influence on a large number of pupils. On 4 October 1879 he married Miss Frances Greene of Clevedon. They had two sons: Arthur (<i>b</i>. 1881) and Uther (<i>b</i>. 1892).<br>
<br>Palmer's contributions to classical scholarship were mainly emendations of Latin and Greek texts. He was most successful in his corrections of the works of Plautus, Catullus, Propertius, Horace, and Ovid, while he aided largely in constituting the text of the <i>editio princeps</i> of Bacchylides (1897), and made many excellent suggestions in the first edition of Herondas (1891). Specimens of some of his cleverest and most convincing emendations will be found in an obituary notice in <span class="italic">Hermathena</span>, 10 (1899). Palmer's posthumously published edition of Ovid's <span class="italic">Heroides</span> received the careful attention of A. E. Housman in the <span class="italic">Classical Review</span> in 1899.<br>
<br>Palmer had special qualifications for the emendation of poetry. He had a wide knowledge of ancient and modern literature and a sensitive appreciation of style. His versions in <span class="italic">Kottabos</span> and <span class="italic">Dublin Translations</span> exhibit his skill in reproducing the idiom and spirit of Latin poetry. His most important editions were of Ovid's <span class="italic">Heroides</span> (1874; revised and enlarged 1898), Propertius (1880), Horace's <span class="italic">Satires</span> (1883), and Catullus (1896). He also contributed articles, chiefly critical, to <span class="italic">Hermathena</span>, the <span class="italic">Journal of Philology</span>, the <span class="italic">Classical Review</span>, and other periodicals.<br>
<br>Palmer was very attractive as a youth. He was a fair cricketer, and for some seasons he successfully captained a team of old university cricketers who assumed the name of Stoics. He was a good racket-player and golfer. As a conversationalist he was delightful, and he greatly enjoyed society until failing health forced him largely to forgo it. His health until middle age was excellent, but during the last ten years of his life he suffered much from disease of the bladder, and died of a cancerous growth in that region on 14 December 1897 at his home, Noel Lodge, Kingstown, co. Dublin.<br>
