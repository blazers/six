<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blair,  James</span>  (1655/6&#150;1743), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and founder of the College of William and Mary</span>, was the son of Peter Blair (<i>d</i>. 1673), Church of Scotland minister of St Cuthbert's parish, Edinburgh, and his wife, Mary Hamilton (<i>d</i>. in or after 1696). He is sometimes described instead as the eldest of four sons and one daughter of Robert Blair, Church of Scotland minister of Alvah, Banffshire, but this is probably an error. Admitted to Marischal College, Aberdeen, in 1668 as a Crombie scholar, aged twelve, Blair the next year matriculated at the University of Edinburgh, and graduated MA on 21 July 1673. He completed his theological studies in 1679, when he was ordained a priest of the Church of Scotland by John Paterson, bishop of Edinburgh. Blair served the parish of Cranston in the presbytery of Dalkeith, 10 miles south-west of Edinburgh, from 11 July 1679 until deprived in 1681. <br>
<br>The privy council of Scotland on 22 December 1681 noted that Blair, like many Scottish episcopalian clergymen, had refused to swear and subscribe to the test oath that acknowledged the Catholic James, duke of York and Albany (later James VII and II), as the head of the Scottish church should James succeed as king of Scotland. Caught in a dilemma, Blair sought the assistance of his former Edinburgh University professor of divinity, Laurence Charteris, who had resigned his academic appointment rather than sign the oath. Charteris wrote to a fellow Scotsman in London, Gilbert Burnet, preacher at the Rolls Chapel, a former professor of divinity at Marischal College, requesting his help on Blair's behalf. <br>
<br>Blair travelled to London where through Burnet's efforts he became an under-clerk (1682&#150;5) of the master of the rolls. Burnet introduced Blair to such prominent church leaders as John Tillotson, later archbishop of Canterbury, and Henry Compton, bishop of London. In 1685 Compton, seeking men to serve the overseas church, appointed Blair to serve Henrico parish in Virginia and four years later appointed him his commissary in the colony. In 1694 Blair became minister of the James City parish, serving until 1710 when he became the parson of Bruton parish in Williamsburg, a post he held until his death. <br>
<br>On 28 April 1687 Blair married Sarah (1670&#150;1713), the seventeen-year-old daughter of the prominent Benjamin Harrison the younger of Wakefield in Surry county, Virginia, a planter and influential member of the colonial council. Blair was linked by marriage to several leading Virginia families. Later his brother Archibald and his nephew John became conspicuous leaders of the house of burgesses and colonial council, establishing for Blair a vital and potent network of political connections. Blair extended his personal fortune and status through his acquisition of land and his financial participation in his brother Archibald Blair's trading store in Williamsburg, and became a prominent defender of the economic and political interests of the provincial gentry. <br>
<br>Doubtless Blair's most significant legacy was the founding and development of the College of William and Mary. The idea for establishing a college in the colony had been current for nearly eighty years. As early as 1619 the Virginia Company of London had moved to grant 10,000 acres to support the founding of the University of Henrico with special attention for an Indian college. At the time English prelates raised &pound;1500 to aid in the project. However, the Good Friday massacre of 1622 at the Henrico settlement had terminated the project. In 1660 the general assembly of the sparsely settled province renewed efforts to found a college with the purpose of providing ministers for the Church of England in Virginia, enabling the education of the colony's young men on religious and classical principles, and propagating Christianity among the native Americans. <br>
<br>Provincial political turmoil and Bacon's rebellion in the 1670s and unsteady constitutional affairs in England during the 1680s suspended plans for a college. Recognizing that from the establishment of the colony in 1607 there had been a chronic shortage of ministers at a convention of the clergy in 1690 Blair proposed the need for establishing a college to educate candidates for the ministry. The parsons in attendance approved of the plan and Blair enlisted the financial support of key provincial leaders, including the governor, Francis Nicholson, and members of the general assembly. Recognizing Blair's influential London contacts the legislature requested that he travel to London to obtain a royal charter and an endowment for the institution. He sailed in 1691 and obtained the support of William III and Mary II for the institution. A royal charter for the College of William and Mary was granted on 8 February 1693, with Henry Compton, bishop of London, designated as chancellor, and Blair as president. He was rewarded with appointment to the colonial council in 1694, a position he held for nearly fifty years. <br>
<br>On Blair's return to Virginia the college, based at Middle Plantation, Virginia, began instruction about 1695 with a handful of students but was exposed to weak financial circumstances and difficulty attracting tutors. In 1699 a joint initiative by Blair and the governor of Virginia, Francis Nicholson, led to Middle Plantation being renamed Williamsburg, replacing Jamestown as Virginia's capital. In 1705 a fire practically reduced the college buildings to ruins and it was not until 1716 that they were rebuilt and classes resumed. Fortunes for the college improved by the late 1720s and Blair spent much of 1726&#150;7 in England raising funds with the assistance of Edmund Gibson, bishop of London. In 1729, nearly three and a half decades after the college opened, Blair entered formally on the duties of his office as president. <br>
<br>During Blair's first three decades in Virginia and as a member of the colonial council he was regularly engaged in controversies with royal governors. Each dispute was shaped by the strong willed temperaments of the combatants, men archly seeking to protect and advance the prerogatives of their offices. Blair's conflicts with the royal officials led to their recall by the Board of Trade. He stridently complained in a 1697 memorial to Bishop Compton, a member of the Board of Trade, that the governor, Sir Edmund Andros, neglected to serve the needs of the church and the college. He argued that twenty-seven of the fifty congregations in the province were without ministers; that parson's salaries were deficient; and that the recently founded college was in need of urgent provincial financial assistance. The commissary also claimed that Andros had withheld granting the use of glebes to several ministers because the vestries had not presented the men to the livings, a situation that led Andros not to intercede and induct the clergymen. A menu of charges suggested that Andros was not fulfilling his royal instruction on ecclesiastical affairs. Both men were summoned by the archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Tension, to Lambeth Palace in 1697 to discuss the matter. It remains unclear how the objections of both disputants were resolved. None the less Andros resigned his governorship in 1697. <br>
<br>Blair attacked Francis Nicholson, Andros's successor, in 1703, when he complained to Bishop Compton that Nicholson was marked with a personal streak of &#145;hypocrisy and profaneness&#146;. The controversy between the two men was expanded and included a division of opinion between several members of the colonial council and the rank and file members of the provincial clergy. Joined by five members of the Virginia council Blair presented to Queen Anne in 1703 a memorial disparaging the arbitrariness and maladministration of Nicholson's regime. The governor counter-attacked by summoning the Virginia clergy to a convention at Williamsburg on 25 August 1703 for a discussion of the dispute. After hearing a presentation of the two antagonists, twenty ministers in attendance supported Nicholson's position and noted their satisfaction with his administration. The men concluded that Blair's action had stirred up public contempt for the clergy. They recommended to Bishop Compton that Blair should be required to confine his duties to furthering his ecclesiastical duties with the aid of the colony's well-to-do planters rather than to indulge in such divisive political affairs. Blair's unrelenting criticism forced the Board of Trade to recall Nicholson in 1705. <br>
<br>Blair's political and educational interests overshadowed his career as a deputy of the bishops of London in Williamsburg. Despite his tough-mindedness, persistence, and political acumen, he was not venerated by his fellow clerics, and was warily surveyed by politicians and laymen. In churchmanship he was a latitudinarian, and in 1703 he welcomed the first missionary of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel to the colonies, the recently converted former Quaker George Keith, to the pulpit of the Jamestown church. Keith was on an assignment to assess the state of the church in the colonies on behalf of the society. Throughout his career Blair had limited contact with the society, as the Church of England was established by statute in Virginia. There was no need for him or the local vestries to rely on the society for a regular supply of ministers to fill vacant pulpits or to pay their salaries. Successive bishops of London aided in the recruitment of clergymen. Blair's view of doctrine was expounded in <span class="italic">Our Saviour's divine sermon on the mount, contained in the fifth, sixth and seventh chapters of St Matthew's gospel, explained, and the practice of it recommended in divers sermons and discourses</span>, published in four volumes in London in 1722. A second edition appeared in 1732, with a preface by Daniel Waterland. <br>
<br>Blair's third major political opponent was Alexander Spotswood, lieutenant-governor of Virginia from 1710. Their dispute festered for several years and came to a head in 1719 and 1720. Blair outspokenly objected to Spotswood's efforts to impose additional imperial authority over such local institutions as the judiciary, the colonial council, and the right of vestrymen to induct into parishes ministers of their choosing. Following Nicholson's example Spotswood called the clergy to a convention in 1719 with the specific purpose of bluntly challenging Blair's charges. Again the clergy were divided in their support of the commissary and the governor. Yet Spotswood emerged from the controversy a blighted official and in 1722 was recalled by the Board of Trade. The Spotswood dispute was Blair's last feud with a royal governor and for the remainder of his life he called the clergy to convention only once, in 1727. He retained his latitudinarian position to the extent that in December 1739 Blair welcomed George Whitefield to his home and church, when his Anglican counterparts in Philadelphia, New York, and Boston had rejected Whitefield, whose preaching excoriated most of the Church of England clergy. Whitefield preached from the pulpit of Bruton parish church to a congregation that included lieutenant-governor William Gooch and members of the provincial council. <br>
<br>At bottom Blair was a complex personality, at once bold, narrowly tough-minded, self-confident, hot tempered, and politically accomplished. By his offices and longevity Blair was a prominent Virginia public figure. During the absence of the lieutenant-governor, Gooch, from the colony he served for more than a year in the early 1740s as acting governor. <br>
<br>Childless, Blair died in Williamsburg, Virginia, on 1 August 1743, aged eighty-seven, a wealthy man, and was buried at Jamestown church cemetery alongside his wife, who had died on 5 May 1713. His will, dated 5 April 1743, bequeathed to the college his library and &pound;500 for a scholarship for &#145;breeding a young divine&#146;. The remainder of his &pound;10,000 estate he left to his nephew, John Blair (1687&#150;1771), including 1250 acres of farmland in New Kent and 100 acres of the Richneck Tract; a half interest in the Blair-Prentis store with a value of &pound;6000; as well as unfree servants and other property. He also bequeathed &pound;100 for the education of poor children.<br>
