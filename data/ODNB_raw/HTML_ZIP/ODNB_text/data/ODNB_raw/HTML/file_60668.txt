<span class="headword">Maugham,  Robert Cecil Romer <span class="st"> [Robin]</span></span>, second Viscount Maugham  (1916&#150;1981), <span class="occ">novelist and playwright</span>, who wrote under the name Robin Maugham, was born at 4 Collingham Gardens, Kensington, London on 17 May 1916. He was the fourth and youngest child, and the only son, of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34946/', "Frederic Herbert Maugham, first Viscount Maugham (1866&#150;1958)")</script>, lord chancellor in 1938&#150;9, and Helen Mary (1872&#150;1950), daughter of a lord justice of appeal, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35819/', "Sir Robert Romer (1840&#150;1918)")</script>. Maugham was educated, not very happily, at Eton College, but enjoyed his time at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he wrote a thriller for the Amateur Dramatic Company and was converted to a kind of sentimental socialism. He graduated with a second in law in 1938, with the intention, at his father's insistence, of becoming a barrister.<br>
<br>The outbreak of war provided a temporary excuse to dodge an unwelcome future, and Maugham enlisted in the Inns of Court regiment, being commissioned in 1940 in the 4th County of London yeomanry. While fighting in the western desert, Maugham was mentioned in dispatches and suffered a head wound which may have been the cause of his erratic conduct in later life. He reached the rank of captain, and in 1944 was invalided out of the army. He put his army experiences to literary use in his first novel, <span class="italic">Come to Dust</span> (1945), warmly praised by Graham Greene, and in his play <span class="italic">Enemy!</span> (1969).<br>
<br>In 1945 Maugham was called to the bar but never practised. It had always been apparent that he had more in common with his cosmopolitan uncle, the novelist and playwright <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34947/', "W. Somerset Maugham")</script>, than with his legal relatives. Although he produced some thirty works altogether, he had unfortunately inherited an emotional sterility similar to his uncle's without the equivalent compensating literary talent. It was early in his career, in 1948, that Maugham conceived the idea for his slim novella <span class="italic">The Servant</span>, so successfully adapted for the cinema in 1965 by Harold Pinter that it is the work, inconsequential in its origins, by which he is best remembered. It was, however, almost a collaboration between uncle and nephew, Somerset Maugham going over every line in minutest detail.<br>
<br>Although much of Robin Maugham's autobiographical writing was embroidered, his non-fiction was superior to his fiction. In 1961 <span class="italic">The Slaves of Timbuktu</span> was given a dramatic edge with the purchase by Maugham of an African slave to prove the truth of his researches. <span class="italic">Somerset and All the Maughams</span> (1966), enthusiastically welcomed by such distinguished critics as Cyril Connolly and Norman Shrapnel, provided an essentially affectionate portrait of his sardonic uncle, whose stutter he loved to mimic. But there was a strange ambiguity about his fiction. Many of Maugham's books, <span class="italic">The Second Window</span> (1968), for example, <span class="italic">The Sign</span> (1974), or <span class="italic">Lovers in Exile</span> (1977), were compulsively readable and yet instantly forgettable. Maugham was a financially successful but basically facile writer, whose neurotic personality prevented him from working alone and whose insecurity when he failed to inherit anything from his uncle drove him to pursue quick financial returns rather than literary integrity. Some of his novels were actually ghosted.<br>
<br>Maugham was a brave man who survived being buried in a terrifying earthquake in Morocco, at Agadir. He could be violent, snobbish, and cruel, but he endeared himself to close friends as a kind and extravagant host and a brilliant raconteur. Unashamedly homosexual, he had a taste for the louche life, much of it enjoyed at his villa on Ibiza, and some of it reflected in the sexual adventures in exotic locations experienced by the inhabitants of his novels.<br>
<br>Maugham made his final home in Clifton Road, Brighton, and at sixty-four he was still a comparatively young man, although prematurely aged through increasingly heavy drinking bouts allied to diabetes, when he died at the Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton, on 13 March 1981. He was buried with his parents at Hartfield in Sussex. He was unmarried, and the title became extinct. After his death it was thought that his private journals might be published, but, unable to find a suitable publisher, his executors stored the diaries. Towards the end of 1991 all but six volumes were mysteriously stolen, with suggested motives ranging from curiosity about the activities of those described to a suggestion that the thieves had believed them to contain coded references to Maugham's supposed work for British intelligence. The case remains unsolved.<br>
