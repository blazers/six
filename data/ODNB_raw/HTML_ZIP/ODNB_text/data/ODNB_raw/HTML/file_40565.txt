<span class="headword">Bononcini,  Giovanni</span>  (1670&#150;1747), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 8 July (18 July NS) 1670 at Modena, the fifth of the eight children of Giovanni Maria Bononcini (<i>bap</i>. 1642, <i>d</i>. 1678), composer and chapel master at the cathedral, and his first wife, Anna Maria Prezii (1641/2&#150;1677), whom he married in 1662. Anna Maria died after giving birth to Antonio Maria (1677&#150;1726), and Giovanni Maria died a year later. Giovanni and Antonio Maria studied in Bologna with Giovanni Paolo Colonna, chapel master at San Petronio. In 1685&#150;91 Giovanni published six instrumental and two vocal collections, was elected to the Accademia Filarmonica, played violoncello at San Petronio, was appointed chapel master at San Giovanni in Monte, and composed three oratorios. In 1692&#150;8 he lived in Rome, where he served Filippo and Lorenza Colonna, joined the Accademia di Santa Cecilia and the &#145;chorus&#146; in the Arcadian Academy, and composed six serenatas, five operas, and one oratorio, all to texts by the Roman librettist Silvio Stampiglia. <span class="italic">Il trionfo di Camilla</span> (Naples, 1696) had the greatest success; in 1698&#150;1710 it was adapted for productions in nineteen other Italian cities, and in 1706&#150;28 it was performed 111 times in London, where an attempt was made in 1707 to attract Bononcini himself. <span class="italic">Camilla</span> is a touchstone of Italian taste between 1696 and 1710 because its captivating melodies serve as a postscript to the seventeenth-century <i>bel canto</i> and a prelude to the eighteenth-century <i>galant</i> styles. Greater complexities are found in Bononcini's 300 cantatas, which exemplify &#145;no little <i>bizzaria</i>, beauty, harmony, artful study, and fanciful invention&#146; (F. Gasparini, <span class="italic">L'armonico pratico al cimbalo</span>, 1708, 110; trans. F. S. Stillings, 1963, 94). Complexities abound in his <span class="italic">Duetti da camera</span>, op. 8 (1691), which are dedicated to Emperor Leopold I. From 1698 to 1712 he served Leopold I (<i>d</i>. 1705) and Joseph I (<i>d</i>. 1711) in Vienna, and he was clearly Joseph's favourite composer. After Joseph's death he served Johann Wenzel, Count Gallas, Charles VI's ambassador to Rome (<i>d</i>. 1719).<br>
<br>In the summer of 1719 Bononcini was invited to compose for the new Royal Academy of Music in London. The fifty-year-old arrived in mid-October 1720, and his first two seasons were outstandingly successful. Five of his operas (including one for which he set only act II) accounted for 82 of the 120 performances given by the academy, and he profited from engraved editions of his <span class="italic">Cantate e duetti</span> (which had 238 subscribers) and <span class="italic">Divertimenti da camera</span>. In 1721&#150;2 his operas led the academy to its only profitable season. He then received commissions from Francis Atterbury, dean of Westminster, to write the anthem for the duke of Marlborough's funeral and from Katharine Sheffield, duchess of Buckingham, to set the choruses in <span class="italic">Marcus Brutus</span>, written by her late husband.<br>
<br>The duchess was a notorious Jacobite, and Atterbury was imprisoned for treasonous Jacobite activities in August 1722. By October the academy had terminated its employment of both Bononcini and the librettist Rolli, who were Italian Catholics, were associated with Jacobites, and would not accept significantly reduced salaries. During the 1722&#150;3 season their <span class="italic">Erminia</span> was nevertheless produced, presumably as a rehearsal for its scheduled performance at Paris in July 1723. Bononcini had long been regarded in Paris as the sole &#145;mod&egrave;le pour le gracieux&#146;  (F. Raguenet, <span class="italic">D&eacute;fense du parall&egrave;le des Italiens et des Fran&ccedil;ais</span>, 1705, 44). One negotiator for the July production was Luigi Riccoboni, the director of the Italian comedians in Paris and the husband of Elena Balletti, whose sister Margherita (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1685, <i>d</i>. after 1738) had married Bononcini, perhaps by 1706. Although the July production was cancelled, Bononcini performed at Paris with various singers during the summers of 1723&#150;4 and was offered employment there by the marquise de Prie, mistress of the duke of Bourbon, first minister of France. But he instead accepted a lifelong stipend of &pound;500 per annum, offered by Henrietta Godolphin, duchess of Marlborough, on 14 May 1724. In return for this sum he organized her private concerts. In 1727 he did compose one more opera for the Royal Academy, but its performances were increasingly marred by catcalls blown by partisans of the rival prima donnas.<br>
<br>Bononcini and Handel likewise had their partisans, and in May 1725 John Byrom wittily ridiculed them at the end of a six-line epigram:<blockquote>
<div>Strange all this Difference should be<br>
</div>
<div>'Twixt Tweedle-dum and Tweedle-dee!<br>
</div> (Deutsch, 180)</blockquote>Bononcini's best friend in London was Giuseppe Riva, the secretary for Modena (1718&#150;29), with whom he often resided in Suffolk Street. Riva's pamphlet, <span class="italic">Advice to the Composers and Performers of Vocal Musick</span> (1727), offers &#145;advice&#146; to Handel. Bononcini's recitative, clearly superior to Handel's, was &#145;marked with great exactness and propriety&#146;  (J. Hawkins, <span class="italic">A General History of the Science and Practice of Music</span>, 5 vols., 1776, 5.281), and, &#145;both in writing and utterance, was universally allowed to be the best of the time, and in the true genius of the Italian language&#146;  (C. Burney, &#145;Bononcini&#146;, in Rees, <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia</span>, 1819, vol. 4). Hawkins aptly noted that &#145;Bononcini's genius was adapted to the expression of tender and pathetic sentiments. His melodies, the richest and sweetest that we know of, are in a style peculiarly his own; his harmonies are original, and at the same time natural&#146;. But Bononcini's arias rarely convey the power that typifies those by Handel. As Burney noted, &#145;his melody was, perhaps, more polished and vocal, though not so new as that of his powerful Saxon rival; &hellip; as a correct, powerful, and inventive composer, he was an infant compared with Handel&#146;. Bononcini's are instead &#145;agreeable and easie&#146;  (J. E. Galliard, <span class="italic">Six English Cantatas after the Italian Manner</span>, 1716, preface). They served from 1690 onwards as a &#145;mod&egrave;le pour le gracieux&#146;, but by 1730 their &#145;too great Simplicity&#146; troubled many listeners  (<span class="italic">The Craftsman</span>, 10 June 1727).<br>
<br>Beginning in 1726 Bononcini was an active member of the newly formed Academy of (Ancient) Vocal Music. About 1728 his friend Maurice Greene introduced an unsigned manuscript of a madrigal, which Bononcini reportedly claimed to have composed. In 1731 Bernard Gates presented the same work, drawn from a 1705 publication by Antonio Lotti. A flagrant example of someone's unacknowledged borrowing had been uncovered, and several academicians vengefully discredited Bononcini and Greene by obtaining and publishing attestations from Lotti and his Venetian associates. Bononcini then ended his dozen years in London unwisely, in that he cast his lot with the infamous Count Ughi (a disguised Discalced Carmelite), left his generous patroness, and dedicated a work of 1732 to her chief antagonist, her own mother, Sarah, dowager duchess of Marlborough.<br>
<br>By November 1732 Bononcini had departed for Paris, where he composed and published works in 1733. He was in Madrid in December 1733 and in Lisbon by August 1735. In mid-1736 he returned to Vienna, where he composed two operas and an oratorio for productions of 1737. He was presumably unaware that Handel's <span class="italic">Serse</span> (London, 1738) revivifies much from his Roman <span class="italic">Xerse</span> of 1694 and thus contains flagrant examples of unacknowledged borrowing. He presented Empress Maria Theresa with a <span class="roman">Te Deum</span> in 1741, and in 1742 she increased his small pension to an amount that allowed him to spend his final five years in comfortable frugality. It is not known if his wife was with him after 1733, but their 22-year-old daughter, Theresia, died at Vienna on 10 May 1743; Bononcini died there, at a house called Al Luccio Azzurro in the rione Wieden, on 9 July 1747.<br>
