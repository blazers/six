<span class="headword">Long,  John</span>  (1547/8&#150;1589), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland archbishop of Armagh</span>, was born in London in 1547 or 1548. He was educated at Eton and contributed four Latin epigrams to the verses presented by Eton scholars to Queen Elizabeth at Windsor Castle in 1563. He was admitted as a scholar to King's College, Cambridge, on 13 August 1564. While there is no record of his having taken a degree when he left Cambridge three years later, Ware identified him as a doctor of divinity. He became the vicar of Stanwell, Middlesex.<br>
<br>Elizabeth appointed Long archbishop of Armagh and primate of the Church of Ireland on the recommendation of her viceroy, Sir John Perrot, and the council of Ireland; he was consecrated on 13 July 1584. He became a member of the Irish privy council in the following year, also on Perrot's recommendation. Long was a rigorous protestant who reckoned that there were not forty Irish born Christians in all of Ireland. At first he advocated a sturdy policy of enforcing the Reformation in Ireland, prosecuting recusants and preventing Catholic priests from exercising their ministries, but was obliged to accept that that did not accord with the wishes of the crown. Thereafter he concentrated his energies on advancing the Reformation by teaching and persuasion, not with very significant success. In 1589 Barnaby Rich remarked that in Drogheda, the chief town in Armagh diocese and in close proximity to Long's residence, &#145;the Word of God has been for many years most plentifully preached but to such a froward and obstinate people that willfully resist the truth &hellip; [and] do as their [Catholic] fathers have done before them&#146;  (&#145;Rich&#146;, fol. 10).<br>
<br>Long died at Drogheda in January 1589 and was buried in the vault of Primate Octavian del Palatio in St Peter's Church, Drogheda. A month after his death, Lord Deputy Fitzwilliam commented in a letter to William Lyon, bishop of Cork, that the late archbishop &#145;loved good cheer but too well&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). His widow, Anne, petitioned Perrot's successor for relief on account of the small estate left to her and her children, and the fact that many of her goods had been confiscated to pay some of the arrears of the tax of a twentieth owed by her late husband as archbishop of Armagh. Her petition was granted on 15 May 1589.<br>
