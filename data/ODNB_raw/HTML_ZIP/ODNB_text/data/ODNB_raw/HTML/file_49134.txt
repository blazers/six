<span class="headword">Middleton,  George</span>  (1692&#150;1747), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born in the summer of 1692, in Edinburgh, the fifth of the eighteen children of Dr George Middleton, principal of King's College, Aberdeen, and his wife, Janet Gordon of Seton, who died in 1753 at the age of 101. Young George was well educated, with access to his father's well-stocked college library. He served his apprenticeship as a goldsmith in Edinburgh and in 1703 joined John Campbell, a Scottish goldsmith banker in the Strand, London; in 1708 he became his partner. After Campbell's death on 15 November 1712 George married Campbell's daughter Mary (<i>d</i>. 1764)&#151;a sweet, sprightly lady, appropriately nicknamed Honey. They had two daughters, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1746), who married in 1731 Patrick Craufurd MP, of Auchenames, and Margaret, who married in 1768 John Dalrymple, fifth earl of Stair. Elizabeth had two sons, James and John.<br>
<br>Middleton was regarded with respect and affection by his family and a wide circle of friends. Campbell's was a whig bank under the patronage of the second duke of Argyll and his brother, Lord Ilay, later third duke. Most of George's friends were whigs and supporters of the Hanoverians. His eldest brother, Colonel John (1678&#150;1739), became a general in Argyll's army, and friend of the most powerful men in Scotland. Yet some of his relatives were active Jacobites. His father's first cousin John, the second earl of Middleton (1650&#150;1719), was an adviser to James II. He had been imprisoned as a Jacobite in 1693, escaped, and joined James II at his court in St Germain. He was involved in the failed Jacobite invasion in 1708. His sons were captured and imprisoned in the Tower, but the earl remained a loyal minister at the court at St Germain until his death. These relatives and other Jacobite friends caused the whig banker some embarrassment, but with tact and good humour he maintained friendly relations with all.<br>
<br>Like many bankers at this period, Middleton undertook many different responsibilities: he was paymaster to the duke of Argyll's regiment of horse, to his brother John's regiment of foot, to the earl of Stair's dragoons, to the Royal regiment and 4th troop of Horse Guards. He also sometimes acted as an estate agent for his customers. His chief pride, however, was in his craft as a goldsmith, and he signed himself &#145;goldsmith banker&#146;. John Campbell had left Middleton very much in charge at the end of his life, so it was he who was responsible for the making of ten gold collars of the Order of the Thistle for Queen Anne, between the years 1707 and 1709. In 1716 he sold a magnificent service of gilt to the prince of Wales, later George II.<br>
<br>As a banker Middleton had the advantage of the patronage of the duke of Argyll and leading whigs; he was respected and trusted at home and abroad. But between 1719 and 1723, when the South Sea Bubble burst in England and the Mississippi adventure sponsored by John Law collapsed in France, he had to endure, as he wrote, &#145;a fiery trial&#146;  (Healey, 49). By nature cautious, nevertheless he was mesmerized by the financial success in France of his brilliant compatriot John Law, whose brother William, a banker in Paris, was an old friend. John Law had made a spectacular leap from international gambler to banker to the duke of Orl&eacute;ans, regent of France, in 1718. In December 1719 he was made controller of French finance: he was now &#145;King Law&#146;. He had created, in 1717, the Compagnie d'Occident, which he hoped would rival the British East India Company. This Mississippi project aimed to create a French kingdom named Louisiana after the French king, which would stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. By skilful manipulation Law encouraged a manic rush for shares. George Middleton, on William Law's advice, speculated. The shares and John Law's reputation collapsed as quickly as they had risen. By December 1720 Law's company was closed, and he escaped, but his brother William was imprisoned. Middleton was caught in their ruin. He had not only lost money on his own account, but he had also covered John Law on a speculative gamble on the future of the East India Company. When this failed and Law could not pay his debts, Middleton was obliged to stop payment. His &#145;shop&#146; did not re-open until 5 September 1723.<br>
<br>Middleton's troubles were compounded by the collapse of the South Sea Bubble in England. In 1711 the South Sea Company had been promoted by the earl of Oxford and the tory government to fund the national debt of &pound;10 million, which had built up during the war with France. The ever-increasing value of its shares caused a rush to invest, when, as Middleton wrote, &#145;people were running madder every day&#146;  (Healey, 45). However, when the bubble burst, many were ruined; as Middleton put it to the duke of Argyll: &#145;Five goldsmiths broke in one day&#146;  (ibid., 49). Middleton was not himself deeply involved, but many of his customers were. Patiently he pursued his debtors until he was able, as he wrote, &#145;to begin the world anew&#146;  (ibid., 55).<br>
<br>With the help of his influential Scottish friends, the duke of Argyll, Lord Ilay, and Lord Milton, Middleton rebuilt his business. They kept him informed of the negotiations for the foundation of the Royal Bank of Scotland in 1727. Middleton in that year took in John Campbell's son George as a partner, and his own nephew David Bruce entered the partnership in 1740. In 1739 he moved into grander premises at 59 Strand. But years of stress had undermined his health. After a long illness he died at Bath on 17 January 1747.<br>
<br>In 1755 George Campbell took in as partner James Coutts, son of the lord provost of Edinburgh, John Coutts, a director of the Royal Bank of Scotland. Coutts married Polly Peagrum, George Campbell's niece, in May 1755, and on Campbell's death inherited the bank. Thomas Coutts joined his brother on 1 January 1761. The bank founded by John Campbell in 1692 and revived by George Middleton was to become the prestigious Coutts &amp; Co., which remained at 59 Strand.<br>
