<span class="headword">Bold,  Samuel</span>  (1648<span class="mult">x</span>52&#150;1737), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, is of obscure origins. He was brought up and educated in Chester by William Cook (1611/12&#150;1684), curate of St Michael's parish there. Cook was ejected in 1662 and served as nonconformist minister in the city thereafter. Bold later paid tribute to Cook's widow, Mary, for her &#145;great love&#146; and &#145;motherly affection&#146; from his infancy through childhood and youth  (Bold, <span class="italic">Man's Great Duty</span>, sig. A2<i>r</i>). A Samuel Bold, according to the university register, matriculated from Jesus College, Oxford, on 3 November 1671, aged nineteen; if this is our subject, he was the son of Edward Bold (1603/4&#150;1654/5), rector of Hawarden, Flintshire, and was born in 1651 or 1652 rather than 1648 or 1649, the dates derived from his reported age at death. However, Bold's name does not appear in the college's admission records, and there is no evidence of his graduation in either the college or university archives. Bold is notable principally on three counts: as an advocate of religious toleration, for his defence of John Locke, and for his later views on human nature and immortality.<br>
<br>In 1674 Bold was instituted vicar of Shapwick in Dorset, from which pulpit in March 1682, following the required reading of a brief on behalf of persecuted protestants in France, he preached against intolerance and persecution, in support of the French protestants in particular and condemning persecution in general. He decried both the repulsive nature of persecution and its perpetrators with equal clarity and zeal. The sermon was shortly published as <span class="italic">A Sermon Against Persecution</span>, specifically for &#145;the consideration of violent and headstrong men&#146;  (Bold, <span class="italic">Sermon</span>, title-page). It aroused much local indignation, particularly in view of Bold's defence of dissenters personally known to him as men &#145;of great learning, exemplary piety, strict devotion, and extraordinary loyalty&#146; and his denunciation of those responsible for persecution as the &#145;devil's agents&#146;  (ibid., sig. A2<i>v</i>, 4) inflicting on the church &#145;unspeakable injury&#146;  (ibid., 23, 28) and who, having &#145;a great affection for Popery, are hastening towards Rome as fast as they can&#146;  (ibid., 6). Given the political climate&#151;of the failure to exclude the Catholic James, duke of York, from the succession and the intensified persecution of dissenters during the tory reaction&#151;it was, to say the least, injudicious.<br>
<br>Bold sought to justify his position and avert retribution with <span class="italic">A Plea for Moderation towards Dissenters</span> (1682) but the damage had already been done. He only succeeded in further alienating popular and ecclesiastical opinion. <span class="italic">A Plea for Moderation</span>, although couched initially in more conciliatory language, deploring &#145;mutual animosities and contentions&#146; and pleading for &#145;mutual forbearance&#146;, did so in view of the perceived papal threat and the fear &#145;that Hannibal [Rome] is at our gates&#146;  (Bold, <span class="italic">Plea</span>, 5, 6). Bold concluded by protesting again at the &#145;immoderate heat and peevishness of those fatuous and headstrong bigots&#146; who attacked dissenters  (ibid., 36). At a time when English gaols, particularly in the west country, were filled with dissenters on account of the efforts of local informers and magistrates it was more than the authorities, civil and ecclesiastical, could take. Bold was presented to the assizes in Sherborne in August 1682 and shortly afterwards to the court of William Gulston, bishop of Bristol, accused of &#145;scandalous libel&#146; and sedition. The civil court imposed fines, and Bold was imprisoned for seven weeks until the fines were fully paid. The ecclesiastical prosecution was terminated following Gulston's sudden death.<br>
<br>Bold resigned from Shapwick later that year, possibly on account of the furore raised by his defence of dissenters, but probably also because he had already accepted the more comfortable living at Steeple in the Isle of Purbeck. To the chagrin of his successor at Shapwick, Obadiah Beane, Bold remained popular with former parishioners and was frequently requested to officiate at marriages and baptisms. Beane recorded such events in the parish registers as married or baptized &#145;by an unlawful priest&#146;  (Sparkes, 19). Bold's views on sovereignty and allegiance and his advocacy of toleration may all have derived from his early association with William Cook, a &#145;zealous royalist&#146; who before coming to Chester about 1651 had been deprived of the living of Ashby-de-la-Zouch for refusing to take the engagement, thereby withholding his allegiance from the Commonwealth, and had been charged with treason in 1659 for his support of Sir George Booth's royalist rising, only at the Restoration to become a victim of persecution under the so-called Clarendon code  (<span class="italic">Nonconformist's Memorial</span>, 1.327). &#145;Besides[,] many of those you prosecute&#146;, Bold reminded his audience:<blockquote>have given greater demonstrations of their loyalty, having suffered more in the late times of usurpation, for the king, than many, if not all of you have, and contributed much more to the bringing of him back to his crown and his just right. (Bold, <span class="italic">Sermon</span>, 27)</blockquote>In 1688 Bold published anonymously <span class="italic">A brief account of the first rise of the name protestant &hellip; by a professed enemy to persecution</span>, a tract urging protestant unity in the face of the popish threat perceived in the policies of James II. In 1690 Bold took issue with Thomas Comber in <span class="italic">An Examination of Dr. Comber's Scholasticall History</span> which he perceived, probably mistakenly, had been written to justify persecution of dissenters.<br>
<br>Bold was installed as rector at Steeple, also in Dorset (from 1721, Steeple-cum-Tyneham), in April 1682, through the influence of William Churchill. It was from there, in 1697, that he commenced the work for which he is chiefly remembered, his defence of John Locke. Locke's <span class="italic">The Reasonableness of Christianity</span> had appeared in 1695 and was immediately attacked as Socinian by the Calvinist John Edwards in <span class="italic">Socinianism Unmasked</span> (1696). Locke's own <span class="italic">Vindication</span> (1695) and <span class="italic">Second Vindication</span> (1697) of the <span class="italic">Reasonableness of Christianity</span> against Edwards were supported by Bold who, in 1697, entered the field with <span class="italic">A Short Discourse of the True Knowledge of Christ Jesus</span> in which he contended with Locke that Christ and the apostles considered it sufficient for a Christian to believe that Jesus was the Christ. Bold published two further works in that year, contra Edwards, in defence of Locke and his own <span class="italic">Short Discourse</span>, and in 1698 added <span class="italic">Observations on the animadversions &hellip; on a late book entituled, the Reasonableness of Christianity</span>, again in defence of Locke.<br>
<br>In 1699 Bold turned his attention to the vindication of Locke's other great work, the <span class="italic">Essay Concerning Humane Understanding</span> (1690) which by then was already in a second edition but which had attracted unfavourable comment. Bold's <span class="italic">Some considerations on the principal objections and arguments &hellip; against Mr. Locke's essay of humane understanding</span> (1699), together with his earlier work in support of <span class="italic">The Reasonableness of Christianity</span> drew the comment that Bold was &#145;one of the ablest advocates of Mr. Locke&#146;  (Hutchins, 1.612), as well as Locke's own unstinted gratitude. Bold was frequently mentioned in Locke's correspondence with great regard and Locke wrote to him in 1699 &#145;everything must be welcome to me that comes from your pen&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 137), although in 1703 when Bold visited Locke at Otes (or Oates) he was dissuaded by Locke from further publication.<br>
<br>In 1706, however, after Locke's death, Bold's earlier publications in defence of Locke were republished, together with some of his more recent works, in <span class="italic">A collection of tracts publish'd in vindication of Mr. Locke's Reasonableness of Christianity</span>. One of these later works, <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning the Resurrection of the Same Body</span> (1705), seems to have been generated by Bold's assimilation of Locke's views on human existence, resulting in a major shift in Bold's own thinking regarding the nature and destiny of man. In 1696 Bold had published <span class="italic">Meditations Concerning Death</span> in which he had upheld the traditional view of the soul's immortality and immediate felicity in heaven after death. &#145;We have immortal souls&#146;, he had declared. Death is &#145;the departure or separation of the immortal soul from the body&#146; to receive either eternal &#145;happiness or misery&#146;  (Bold, <span class="italic">Meditations Concerning Death</span>, 4, 6).<br>
<br>But there are already hints of a move away from this traditional eschatology in the <span class="italic">Observations</span> of 1698 and <span class="italic">Some Considerations</span> of 1699, where in defending Locke's mortalist views Bold asserts that &#145;the truth of the case&#146; is that immortality, lost by all through Adam's transgression, is restored by Christ &#145;in that he will raise them all from death&#146;  (Bold, <span class="italic">Observations on the Animadversions</span>, 86), and that &#145;after the Resurrection man will be immortal&#146;  (Bold, <span class="italic">Some Considerations</span>, 25). In the 1705 <span class="italic">Discourse Concerning the Resurrection</span>, contra Daniel Whitby and Samuel Parker, who had opposed Locke's view of human nature, contending that death means only the death of the body, Bold predicated a more defined mortalist view, arguing that death &#145;happeneth to the [whole] man&#146; rather than to the body alone, and confessing that the belief that after death &#145;man is not dead&#146; was beyond his comprehension. Bold otherwise appears to have been doctrinally orthodox, despite later inclusion in Wallace's <span class="italic">Antitrinitarian Biography</span> where the author concedes that there was &#145;no ground for suspecting his orthodoxy&#146; concerning the Trinity  (Wallace, 315).<br>
<br>Most of Bold's more than twenty published works appeared during his years at Steeple and in addition to his appeals for tolerance, his defence of Locke, and his own modified theology of the soul and immortality, included a number of sermons and devotional pieces, notably <span class="italic">Man's Great Duty</span> (1693), <span class="italic">The Duty of Christians</span> (1717), and <span class="italic">Help to Devotion</span> (1736), the latter containing a short prayer on every chapter in the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. Bold died at Steeple in August 1737 after a ministry there of more than fifty-five years, aged eighty-eight, and greatly respected.<br>
