<span class="headword">Shaw,  Alexander</span>  (1804&#150;1890), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born in Scotland on 6 February 1804, the sixth son of Charles Shaw, clerk of the county of Ayr, and Barbara Wright, his wife, daughter of a customs official at Greenock. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25257/', "John Shaw (1792&#150;1827)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25245/', "Sir Charles Shaw (1795&#150;1871)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25263/', "Patrick Shaw")</script> were his elder brothers. One sister, Marion, married Sir Charles Bell, and another sister married Bell's brother, Professor George Joseph Bell. Alexander Shaw was educated at Edinburgh high school, and afterwards went to the University of Glasgow, where he matriculated in 1819 and graduated MA on 11 April 1822. Shaw was connected with the Middlesex Hospital, London, for more than half a century. He entered there as a pupil in 1822; was made assistant surgeon in 1836; and became surgeon in 1842. Sir Charles Bell lectured at the hospital between 1812 and 1836. On his retirement in 1872 Shaw was appointed consulting surgeon. He joined the medical school of the hospital on its formation, and at the time of his death he was the sole survivor of the original members of staff. With the idea of obtaining an MD degree, Shaw was admitted as a pensioner at Downing College, Cambridge, on 28 June 1826, but on the death of his brother John in 1827 he left Cambridge to take up his work at the Great Windmill Street School. From this time he devoted all his energies to his professional work, and he abandoned the idea of taking his Cambridge degree. He obtained the licence of the Society of Apothecaries in 1827, and in the following year gained membership of the Royal College of Surgeons. On the institution of the fellowship of the college, Shaw was elected one of the first fellows on 11 December 1843. He served on the college council from 1858 to 1865.<br>
<br>Shaw took an active part in the work of the London medical societies. At the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society he served the offices of honorary secretary, vice-president, and treasurer, and in the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of that society he published some valuable papers on rickets. In 1839 he published <span class="italic">A Narrative of the Discoveries of Sir Charles Bell in the Nervous System</span>. After Bell's death in 1842 Lady Bell lived with her brother, and their house became a centre for the literary and scientific society of the period. In 1856 Shaw married Susan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Turner (<i>d</i>. 1891), the widow of Mr J. Randall; they had a son who died in infancy. In 1869 Shaw republished Bell's <span class="italic">New Idea of the Anatomy of the Brain</span> (originally published in a limited edition in 1811) with additions, consisting chiefly of selected passages bearing on the same subject and written by Bell before the publication of the <span class="italic">New Idea</span>  (see <span class="italic">Journal of Anatomy and Physiology</span>, 3, 1869, 147). Shaw also edited Bell's <span class="italic">Anatomy and Philosophy of Expression</span> (3rd edn, 1844), to which he added a contribution on the nervous system, and <span class="italic">The Hand</span> (6th edn, 1860). In his own right he published work on diseases of the spine.<br>
<br>Shaw was a surgeon of repute, and, though incapacitated for work for some years before his death, he never lost interest in his profession. He died in London at his home, 136 Abbey Road, Kilburn, on 18 January 1890; his wife died the following year.<br>
