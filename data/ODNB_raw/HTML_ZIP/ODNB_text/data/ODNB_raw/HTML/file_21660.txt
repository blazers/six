<span class="headword">Smith,  Robert  Payne</span>  (1818&#150;1895), <span class="occ">orientalist and theologian</span>, was born in Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, on 7 November 1818, the only son and second of four children of Robert Smith (<i>d</i>. 1827), a land agent, and his wife, Esther Argles Payne, of Leggsheath, Surrey. The Smiths and the Paynes were both old but impoverished families of gentry. He attended Chipping Campden grammar school, and was also taught Hebrew by his gifted eldest sister, Esther. In 1837 he obtained an exhibition at Pembroke College, Oxford, where he studied classics, in which he graduated with second-class honours in 1841, and oriental languages. He gained the Boden Sanskrit scholarship in 1840 and the Pusey and Ellerton Hebrew scholarship in 1843; the same year he became a fellow of his college and was ordained deacon, then priest a year later. He was a popular classics tutor but later left Oxford and undertook successively the curacies of Crendon and Long Winchendon, Buckinghamshire, and of Thame. In 1847 he accepted a classical mastership at the Edinburgh Academy. From 1848 he was also the incumbent of Trinity Chapel, Dean Bridge, Edinburgh. In 1850 he married Catherine (<i>d</i>. 25 Jan 1894), second daughter of the Revd William Freeman of Langley; they had two sons and four daughters, one of whom, Jessie Payne Smith, married the orientalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34874/', "David Samuel Margoliouth")</script> and became a noted orientalist herself [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58372/', "Margoliouth, Jessie Payne")</script>]. In 1853 he left Edinburgh to become headmaster of the Kensington proprietary grammar school. In London he resumed his oriental studies, learning Arabic and working on the Syriac manuscripts in the British Museum, with the encouragement of William Cureton.<br>
<br>In order to spend more time on Syriac, and because Kensington did not suit his wife's health, Payne Smith accepted in 1857 an assistant sub-librarianship created for him at the Bodleian Library, Oxford, even though this involved a drop in salary from &pound;1000 to &pound;300. He gained the respect of Syriac scholars throughout Europe after he published Cyril of Alexandria's commentary on <span class="roman">St Luke's gospel</span>, in Syriac (1858) and English (1859), and a translation, <span class="italic">The Third Part of the &#145;Ecclesiastical History&#146; of John, bishop of Ephesus</span> (1860), which Cureton had edited in Syriac. But his main task as sub-librarian was to catalogue the 205 Syriac manuscripts then in the Bodleian; he completed the catalogue in 1864. His work on these publications made him aware of the need for a better Syriac dictionary, and in 1860 he began work on his <i>magnum opus</i>, the <span class="italic">Thesaurus Syriacus</span>, which occupied him for the rest of his life; the first fascicle appeared in 1868. He incorporated into it the unfinished work of several earlier Syriac lexicographers, including S. M. Quatrem&egrave;re, G. H. Bernstein, and Frederick Field, who had handed on their papers to him for this purpose; he also utilized the numerous Syriac texts published in Europe at this period and every other available source. The eventual result was a major monument of lexicography, running to 2258 folio-size pages, and started a new era in Syriac studies.<br>
<br>Payne Smith also began to write on controversial theology, favouring the conservative evangelical side. This led to an unexpected improvement in his fortunes, when his friend Francis Jeune, bishop of Peterborough, who had been master of Pembroke, persuaded him to send a copy of his sermons vindicating <span class="italic">The Authenticity and Messianic Interpretation of the Prophecies of Isaiah</span> (1862) to Lord Shaftesbury, who was so impressed that he influenced the prime minister, Palmerston, to appoint Payne Smith regius professor of divinity at Oxford and rector of Ewelme in 1865. He was made DD in the same year, and in 1869 he delivered the Bampton lectures, published as <span class="italic">Prophecy: a Preparation for Christ</span> (1870). As regius professor he played a leading part in establishing the new honour school of theology, and was one of the first examiners in 1870. In January 1871 he resigned the chair to accept Gladstone's offer of the deanery of Canterbury. As dean he was noted for his successes both in improving the cathedral services and in the repair and modernization of its fabric, which had been damaged by fire.<br>
<br>Payne Smith had been a delicate child, but cured this at Oxford by taking up rowing and riding, and remained active well into old age. His other outdoor pursuits were walking and gardening. Originally influenced by the Oxford Movement, after 1845 he became a moderate evangelical, and was made one of the Simeon trustees, a group which sought to promote by securing appointments for its members. In 1873 he went to the USA to take part in conferences organized by the Evangelical Alliance in New York. He was respected on all sides for his broad sympathies and genial temper, and was held never to have made an enemy, despite his involvement in some of the most heated ecclesiastical debates of the time, serving as he did on the 1867&#150;8 ritual commission and on the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> revision committee from 1870 to 1885. At Canterbury he endeared himself to nonconformists and even Roman Catholics by making the cathedral more accessible to their use. In politics he began as a strong liberal and ended a conservative, but was always concerned to improve social conditions, especially education. He helped to found both Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, of which he remained chairman of council until his death, and the South-Eastern College, Ramsgate, and was active in setting up the church schools in the Canterbury area that were named the Payne Smith schools in his memory. He was also a founder member of the Palaeographical Society (1873).<br>
<br>Payne Smith died at his deanery on 31 March 1895 and was buried on 3 April in St Martin's churchyard, Canterbury. He had lived to publish nine fascicles of his great Syriac dictionary; the final one was seen through the press (1901) by his second daughter, Jessie, and her husband. Jessie also brought out an abridged version, entitled <span class="italic">A Compendious Syriac Dictionary</span> (1903), and a <span class="italic">Supplement to the &#145;Thesaurus Syriacus&#146;</span> (1927). Another daughter, Mary, wrote a memoir of her father's life, which she prefixed to his final work, <span class="italic">Sermons on the Pentateuch</span> (1896).<br>
