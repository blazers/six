<span class="headword">Tennant, Sir  James</span>  (1789&#150;1854), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, second son of William Tennant, merchant, of Ayr, and his wife, Wilhelmina Ramsay, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7059/', "Dr William Dalrymple")</script>, was born at Ayr on 21 April 1789. He was educated at the Royal Military College, Marlow, and at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich (1804&#150;5), and sailed as cadet of the East India Company on 31 August 1805 in the East India fleet which accompanied the expedition of Sir David Baird and Sir Home Popham to the Cape of Good Hope. The company cadets and recruits, under Lieutenant-Colonel Wellesley, Bengal establishment, took part in the capture of Cape Town. Tennant arrived in India on 21 August 1806, and was commissioned lieutenant, Bengal artillery, antedated to 29 March for his Cape service.<br>
<br>In 1810 Tennant commanded a detachment of artillery on service on the &#145;vizier's dominions&#146;. On 1 January 1812 he was appointed acting adjutant and quartermaster to Major G. Fuller's detachment of artillery, and on 15 January marched from Bauda with the force under Colonel Gabriel Martindell to attack Kalinjar, a formidable fort on a large isolated hill 900 feet above the surrounding level. Kalinjar was reached on 19 January; by 28 January the batteries opened, and on 2 February, the breaches being practicable, an unsuccessful attempt was made to storm. On 3 February the fort surrendered. Tennant was employed throughout this and the following year in various minor operations in the districts bordering on Bundelkhand.<br>
<br>On 27 December 1814, with two 18-pounders and four mountain guns of the 3rd division, Tennant joined Sir David Ochterlony at Nahr, on the north-north-east side of the Ramgarh Ridge, to take part in the operations against Nepal. In March 1815 Tennant ascended the Ramgarh Ridge, with the force under Lieutenant-Colonel Cooper, and, bringing up his 18-pounders with great labour, opened fire on Ramgarh, which soon surrendered, Jorjori capitulating at the same time. Taragarh (11 March) and Chamha (16 March) were reached and taken. All the posts on this ridge having been successively reduced, the detachment took up the position assigned to it before Malaun on 1 April. Malaun was captured by assault on 15 April before the 18-pounders, which were dragged by hand over the hills at the rate of 1 or 2 miles a day, had arrived; these guns were eventually left in the fort.<br>
<br>Tennant was promoted second captain in the regiment and captain in the army on 1 October 1816, and first captain in the Bengal artillery on 1 September 1818. His next active service was in the Pindari and Anglo-Maratha wars of 1817&#150;19. He joined the centre division under Major-General T. Brown of the marquess of Hastings's grand army at Sikandra in the Cawnpore district, but as it was moving forward to Mahewas on the River Sind in November 1817, it was attacked by cholera. He took part in some of the operations, as captain and brigade major of the 2nd division of artillery, and received a share of the Deccan prize-money for general captures. He was brigade major of artillery in the field in 1819 and 1820. He was selected to command the artillery at Agra on 23 December 1823, and on 31 December was nominated first assistant secretary to the military board.<br>
<br>On 28 May 1824 Tennant was appointed assistant adjutant-general of artillery. In November 1825 he accompanied the commandant of artillery, Brigadier-General Alexander Macleod, to Agra; there, and at Mathura, the commander-in-chief, Lord Combermere, assembled his army for the siege of Bharatpur. The siege began in the middle of December; on 24 December the batteries opened fire, breaches were found practicable on 18 January 1826, and this formidable place was carried by assault. Tennant, who, as assistant adjutant-general of artillery, had managed the artillery, was thanked by the commandant in regimental orders (21 January 1826). Tennant's &#145;methodical habits and mathematical talent rendered labour easy to him which would have been difficult to others&#146;. In February he accompanied Combermere to Cawnpore and to the presidency. Tennant married on 7 April 1828 Elizabeth Louisa (1803&#150;1882), eldest daughter of Charles Pattenson, Bengal civil service. Lieutenant-General James Francis Tennant CIE FRS (1829&#150;1915), Royal Engineers, was their son.<br>
<br>Tennant was promoted major on 3 March 1831. He was appointed agent for the manufacture of gunpowder at Ishapur on 28 April 1835 (confirmed on 28 July) and he ceased to be assistant adjutant-general of artillery. On 11 April 1836 he became a member of the special committee of artillery officers. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 18 January 1837, and in consequence vacated the agency for gunpowder.<br>
<br>For his services on the committee of artillery officers Tennant received the thanks of the government of India. On 21 March 1837 he was posted to command the 4th battalion of artillery. On 28 November 1842 he was given the command of the Cawnpore division of artillery. On 17 November 1843 he was appointed to command, with the rank of brigadier-general, the foot artillery attached to the army of exercise assembled at Agra under Sir Hugh (afterwards Lord) Gough. This force left Agra for the Gwalior campaign on 16 December, crossing the River Chambal on 21 December. In spite of great exertions, Tennant and the heavy ordnance got considerably behind. Gough did not wait for his heavy guns, and the battle of Maharajpur (29 December) was rather riskily fought without them  (see Gough's dispatch, <span class="italic">LondG</span>, 8 March 1844).<br>
<br>On 10 February 1844 Tennant was again appointed commandant of the artillery at Cawnpore. On 3 July 1845 he was promoted colonel in the army, and was sent report on field magazines of the upper provinces. He, however, resigned this appointment, to the regret of the government, and resumed his command at Cawnpore. In 1846&#150;7 Tennant was associated with Colonel George Brooke, Bengal artillery, on a committee at Simla, on the equipment of mountain batteries. Their experience of the Nepal war, 1814&#150;16, led to valuable minutes. On 2 September 1848 Tennant was appointed brigadier-general to command the Marwar field force. He was then attached to the army of the Punjab to command the artillery with the rank of brigadier-general. He commanded it at the battle of Chilianwala (13 January 1849) and was mentioned in dispatches. He also commanded it at the battle of Gujrat (21 February 1849), mentioned in dispatches. He received the thanks of parliament, of the government of India, and of the court of directors of the East India Company. He was made a CB on 5 June 1849.<br>
<br>On 13 March 1849 Tennant resumed his appointment at Cawnpore, and on 19 December was transferred to Lahore as brigadier-general commanding. On 30 January 1852 he was given command of the cis-Jhelum division of the army. He was made a KCB on 8 October 1852. He died at Mian Mir, Lahore, on 6 March 1854. His wife survived him. Tennant's attainments were of a very high order, and in Stubbs's view &#145;he was better acquainted with the details of his profession than perhaps any officer in the regiment&#146;.<br>
