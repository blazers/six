<span class="headword">Tate,  George</span>  (1805&#150;1871), <span class="occ">topographer and naturalist</span>, born on 21 May 1805 in Alnwick, was the son of Ralph Tate (1781&#150;1827), builder and draper, and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26987/', "Thomas Tate")</script> the educationist. He was a freeman of Alnwick by patrimony, and attended the borough and grammar schools there. Subsequently he worked as a linen draper, and in 1848 he was appointed postmaster, an office he held until a fortnight before his death. Tate was active in all public movements in the town, and helped to organize the work of the Alnwick Mechanics' Scientific Institution, of which he acted as secretary for thirty years. This inspired him to study geology. He was clerk of Alnwick council from 1850 to 1858, and used the opportunity to study the borough records. The result was his authoritative <span class="italic">History of Alnwick</span>, which appeared between 1865 and 1869, and was his chief publication. It included the history of Alnwick Castle and the Percy family, with accounts of old customs, sports, public movements, local nomenclature, the botany, zoology, and geology of the district, and biographies of the notabilities of the town. He was also secretary of the Berwickshire Naturalists' Club from 1858 until his death.<br>
<br>Tate chiefly interested himself in the archaeology and natural history of his town and district and especially distinguished himself by his geological explorations, being the first to record marks of glaciation on rocks in Northumberland. He published in 1865 <span class="italic">Sculptured Rocks of Northumberland and the Eastern Borders</span>. He examined and wrote papers on other ancient British remains for the proceedings of the Berwickshire Naturalists' Club. Of these, the most important were &#145;The old Celtic town of Greaves Ash&#146; and &#145;The hut-circles and forts on Yevering Bell&#146;. His account of his journey along the Roman wall, with his examination of its geology, was published as a part of John Collingwood Bruce's <span class="italic">The Roman Wall</span> (2nd edn, 1853). His account of the fossil flora of the eastern border was incorporated in George Johnston's <span class="italic">The Natural History of the Eastern Borders</span> (1854), and that of the geology of Northumberland in J. G. Baker and Tate's <span class="italic">New Flora of Northumberland and Durham</span>. Tate formed a museum which was especially rich in fossils collected in the course of his investigations in the carboniferous and mountain limestone formations, and his name was given by T. Rupert Jones to three species: <i>Estheria striata tateana</i>, <i>Candona tateana</i>, and <i>Beyrichia tatei</i>.<br>
<br>Tate married in 1832 Ann Horsley, also of Alnwick, who died on 21 December 1847. Two sons and three daughters survived him. His eldest son, George Ralph Tate MD FLS, was a notable plant collector, whose Chinese specimens are now at Kew. Tate died in Alnwick on 7 June 1871, and was buried on 9 June in Alnwick churchyard, on the south side of the church.<br>
