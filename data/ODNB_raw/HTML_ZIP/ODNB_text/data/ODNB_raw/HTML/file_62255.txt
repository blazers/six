<span class="headword">Bowen,  Emrys George</span>  (1900&#150;1983), <span class="occ">geographer</span>, was born on 28 December 1900 at 1 Towy View, Carmarthen, the elder child of Thomas Bowen, insurance agent, and Elizabeth Ann Lynch. He was educated at the council school, Pentre-poeth, and from 1912 to 1919 at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Carmarthen, before proceeding in 1919 to the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, where he obtained a first-class honours degree in geography in 1923. The following year he took a teacher's diploma and, after a year's research at Aberystwyth, became the first Cecil Prosser research fellow at the Welsh National School of Medicine at Cardiff, investigating the relationship between &#145;racial type&#146; and chest disease. From 1928 to 1929 he was an assistant editor with the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> before being appointed in 1929 assistant lecturer in the department of geography and anthropology at Aberystwyth. There he remained for the rest of his academic career, including the war years when he continued to lecture and also taught meteorology to the Royal Air Force initial training wing which was located there. He became Gregynog professor in 1946.<br>
<br>There were three strands to Bowen's academic work. The first was physical characteristics of populations; his master's thesis (1926) was entitled &#145;South west Wales: a study of physical anthropological characters in correlation with varied distributions&#146;. It was this attempt to relate physical anthropological character to disease, especially to tuberculosis among the population of upland Cardiganshire, which led to his subsequent work at the National School of Medicine. An early paper, &#145;The incidence of phthisis in relation to race type and social environment in south and west Wales&#146; appeared in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute</span> in 1928 (new ser. 31, 363&#150;98). The second was the nature of the social organization, or the way of life, of a people, especially as it was derived from the past, from the process of cultural inheritance. The third was the nature of the physical environment in which the people lived. Essentially Bowen's aim was to integrate all these three strands in the explanation of the variable character of the earth's surface. This is best illustrated in the first book he published, <span class="italic">Wales: a Study in Geography and History</span> (1941). These themes he had inherited from his mentor, H. J. Fleure, but it was the determination to stress the second, social organization, which had led to the department's being entitled &#145;geography and anthropology&#146; when it was founded in 1917. Bowen carried forward that emphasis and many of his research students contributed significantly in the field of social anthropology. Against that background, and under Bowen's leadership, the department played a distinctive role in the development of geography in Britain ensuring that both contemporary social structures and the role of historical development were given a significant status in the interpretation of landscape.<br>
<br>If Bowen's early research was in the field of physical anthropology his first published paper  (<span class="italic">Geographical Teacher</span>, 13, 1924&#150;6, 317&#150;26) was &#145;A study of rural settlement in south-west Wales&#146;. That interest became his specialist concern, more particularly those settlements which had grown about the cells established in the post-Roman period by the so-called Celtic saints. In 1932 he published an article entitled &#145;Early Christianity in the British Isles: a study in historical geography&#146;  (<span class="italic">Geography</span>, 17, 1932, 267&#150;77), and in 1934 <span class="italic">Aberystwyth Studies</span> included a paper by him on &#145;The travels of Saint Samson of Dol&#146;  (13, 61&#150;7). His research and writings subsequently broadened to cover the early history of western Britain and its prehistorical antecedents. Its full flowering was represented in his three books, <span class="italic">The Settlements of the Celtic Saints in Wales</span> (1954), <span class="italic">Saints, Seaways, and Settlements</span> (1969) and <span class="italic">Britain and the Western Seaways</span> (1972).<br>
<br>Apart from his specialized field Bowen's interests ranged widely. For many years he was a Sunday school teacher in a Welsh Baptist chapel; in his retirement he lectured on church history in the United Theological College at Aberystwyth. The paper &#145;Bedyddwyr Cymru tua 1714&#146; in <span class="italic">Trafodion Cymdeithas Hanes Bedyddwyr Cymru</span> (1957&#150;8, 5&#150;14), (&#145;Welsh Baptists circa 1714&#146; in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Welsh Baptists Historical Society</span>, 1957&#150;8, 5&#150;14), and the volume of essays <span class="italic">Geography, Culture, and Habitat</span> (1975) indicate his versatility, although Wales was always a common denominator. He lived for many years with his sister. After his retirement in 1968 Bowen continued to live at Aberystwyth where he died unmarried after a heart attack on 8 November 1983 at Bronglais General Hospital, Aberystwyth. He was buried at Carmarthen.<br>
<br>Bowen's work was widely recognized. He was president of the Institute of British Geographers in 1958 and president of section E of the British Association in 1962. He was awarded the Murchison grant by the Royal Geographical Society in 1958. In 1949 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and in 1967 he was president of the Cambrian Archaeological Society. He was awarded an honorary LLD by the University of Wales and an honorary DUniv by the Open University. He was an honorary member of the Gorsedd of Bards.<br>
<br>But it was as a teacher and lecturer that Bowen was supreme. His exposition, based on careful structuring, triad upon triad, and the timing of a consummate actor, was masterly. It was in the tradition of Welsh preaching rather than of academic discourse, a feature reinforced by his lively presentation, epitomical short, dark appearance and <span class="roman">Bible</span> black clothing. By his devotion to his subject, and his willingness to lecture throughout the country in the smallest and remotest of locations, he did much to establish geography as an academic discipline in Wales.<br>
