<span class="headword">Thomas,  Howard</span>  (1909&#150;1986), <span class="occ">broadcaster and film and television impresario</span>, was born on 5 March 1909 in Cwm, Monmouthshire, the second son and third and youngest child of William George Thomas, stationer and postmaster, and his wife, Alice Maud Stephens. The family left south Wales when Thomas was eleven and moved to Beswick, Manchester. He went to local schools until he was old enough to start work.<br>
<br>Thomas took evening classes in advertising and qualified as a copywriter, which led him to a small but aggressive Manchester advertising agency run by F. John Roe, where he developed the enterprise and showmanship on which he was to draw for the rest of his career. He moved to London in 1934 and in that year married Hilda, daughter of Harrison Fogg, a Manchester journalist; they had two daughters. In 1937 he joined London Press Exchange and obtained his first BBC commission. He set up the commercial radio department of London Press Exchange in 1938, writing and producing most of its programmes himself, and also became one of BBC radio's highest paid freelance scriptwriters.<br>
<br>Rejected for military service in 1940 because of his defective eyesight, Thomas was offered a BBC staff position and in the next three years produced over 500 programmes, among them two of the most notable of the war years. <span class="italic">Sincerely yours</span> established Vera Lynn as a musical link between servicemen and their partners back home and made her a star to be remembered ever afterwards as the forces' sweetheart. In <span class="italic">The Brains Trust</span>, a panel of experts answered listeners' questions. This was a simple formula which became an outstanding popular success because of Thomas's selection of the panellists; three regulars&#151;biologist Julian Huxley, philosopher C. E. M. Joad, and retired naval commander A. B. Campbell&#151;became national figures.<br>
<br>In 1944 Thomas resigned from the BBC, where he saw no future for himself, and moved to the film industry as producer-in-chief of Path&eacute; Pictures, the short-film subsidiary of the Associated British Picture Corporation, where he revitalized Path&eacute; News and Path&eacute; Pictorial and extended production into documentaries, such as his colour film of the coronation of Elizabeth II. Thomas was a passionate advocate of commercial television. When the Associated British Picture Corporation was invited by the Independent Television Authority in 1955 to apply for the weekend contract in the north and midlands, his lobbying was finally rewarded. ABC Television was formed as a subsidiary, with Thomas as managing director, and went on the air in February 1956.<br>
<br>ABC was the last and smallest of the original &#145;big four&#146; contractors, alongside Associated Rediffusion, ATV, and Granada. But Thomas's energy and enthusiasm, and his ability to pick the right like-minded lieutenants, propelled the little company into prominence. <span class="italic">Armchair Theatre</span>, under Sydney Newman, galvanized the single television play; arts programming was pioneered with <span class="italic">Tempo</span>, religious programming with <span class="italic">The Sunday Break</span>, adult education with <span class="italic">Sunday Session</span>; and London's dominance of popular entertainment at the weekend was successfully challenged with programmes like <span class="italic">Blackpool Night out</span>, <span class="italic">Candid Camera</span>, and the stylish thriller series <span class="italic">The Avengers</span>.<br>
<br>When the structure of independent television was reshaped in 1967, the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) offered the London weekday contract to a new company formed by the merger of Rediffusion and ABC TV, in which majority control was to be exercised by ABC, with Thomas as managing director. In the words of IBA chairman Lord Hill of Luton, &#145;the combination of these two companies seemed to the Authority to offer the possibility of a programme company of real excellence&#146;. Thames Television began transmission in August 1968 and realized the possibility of excellence in the ensuing years with a programme output high in both quantity and quality, ranging from <span class="italic">This Week</span> and <span class="italic">The World at War</span> to <span class="italic">Rumpole of the Bailey</span> and <span class="italic">Minder</span>, from <span class="italic">The Naked Civil Servant</span> and <span class="italic">Edward and Mrs Simpson</span> to <span class="italic">This is your Life</span> and <span class="italic">The Benny Hill Show</span>. In 1974 Thomas succeeded Lord Shawcross as chairman. He retired at the age of seventy in 1979.<br>
<br>Thomas was part of a particularly colourful period in the history of broadcasting in Britain, a bluff, burly showman in both radio and television. Among the founding fathers of independent television, he had the unique distinction of setting up and running two highly successful programme companies. He remained a programme maker throughout his career, brimming with ideas himself and always respectful of the ideas of other programme makers, whose talents he was quick to spot and ready to support. It was remarkable that, apart from his appointment as CBE in 1967, his achievement was never appropriately recognized. He was a governor of the British Film Institute (1974&#150;82) and vice-president of the Royal Television Society (1976&#150;84). He wrote five books, including <span class="italic">How to Write for Broadcasting</span> (1940). He also served three times as chairman of Independent Television News.<br>
<br>Thomas was above average height, thickset, balding from a quite early age, with a bluff manner and a forceful presence emphasized by his horn-rimmed spectacles. He was capable of great charm and persuasiveness, which served him well in both radio and television. Thomas died in hospital in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire (where his home was Old Ship House, Wharfe Lane), on 6 November 1986.<br>
