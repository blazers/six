<span class="headword">Dawson,  Robert</span>  (1771&#150;1860), <span class="occ">surveyor and cartographer</span>, was born in Plymouth on 10 November 1771, the seventh of ten children born to Matthew Dawson (<i>d</i>. 1783) and his wife, and their only child to live to maturity. He lived with his family in Plymouth Dockyard until he was thirteen when he was taken on as an apprentice by a &#145;good man&#146; as Dawson described him in a letter, probably William Gardner, chief draughtsman in the drawing office in the Tower of London, who in 1784 was conducting a survey of Plymouth. The same &#145;good man&#146; secured Dawson's appointment to the Board of Ordnance in 1791. Dawson was to serve with the Ordnance Survey for forty-five years, his technical skill and ability to lead ensuring his rapid promotion. He initially took part in military surveys in the south of England and by 1800 he had gained a reputation as a competent surveyor and an excellent draughtsman and was seconded for two years to teach at the Royal Military Academy at High Wycombe. He proved an outstanding teacher of both military pupils at the academy and, after 1810, of civilian pupils at the East India Company's college at Addiscombe. In 1803 he designed the curriculum for the cadets attached to the developing Ordnance Survey&#151;in six months cadets using his <span class="italic">Course of Instruction</span> were to become proficient in all practical aspects of surveying and map drawing.<br>
<br>Dawson's early cartographic style owed much to Gardner's teaching, but it changed soon after he left the college at High Wycombe where he had perhaps come under the influence of the French topographical instructor, General Fran&ccedil;ois Jarry. He was also influenced by British military cartography and draughtsmanship and by French surveying textbooks. His method of showing relief by a combination of pen and ink shading and soft brushwork hachures developed until, by the 1820s, his technique of using brown colour washes to depict the Welsh landscape conveyed a vivid three-dimensional impression of topography, particularly well suited to rugged areas, which drew praise from contemporaries and continued to command admiration, although his methods were later abandoned. Although Dawson's brushwork was occasionally criticized by engravers as hard to interpret, his maps are unquestionably very pleasing to the eye. His &#145;model of hills&#146; of 1830 was used to bring more uniformity to the Ordnance board's presentation of relief. He retired about 1836 on a pension, having risen to be chief draughtsman and principal instructor and one of the best paid of the Ordnance board's staff. He married Jane, sister of two well-known ordnance surveyors, Richard and Charles Budgen, in 1794 in Lewes, Sussex. They had eight children, whose various birthplaces reflect the peripatetic life of an ordnance surveyor. Two girls, both Felicia, died in infancy. Matthew and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7355/', "Robert Kearsley Dawson")</script> were commissioned to the Royal Engineers. Charles was a surveyor in the Ordnance Survey. George, a clergyman, was rector of Woodleigh, near Kingsbridge, Devon, where his father was living at the time of his death on 22 June 1860.<br>
