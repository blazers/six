<span class="headword">Pringle,  William Mather Rutherford</span>  (1874&#150;1928), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Gordon, Berwickshire, on 22 January 1874, the third and youngest son of George Pringle, farm steward, of Gordon, and his wife, Elizabeth Mather. He was educated at Garnethill School, Glasgow, and at Glasgow University, where he graduated with honours in classics and history. In 1904 he was called to the bar by the Middle Temple. On 4 June 1906 he married Lilias Patrick (<i>b</i>. 1877/8), who survived him, daughter of Joseph Somerville, timber salesman, of Glasgow. They had four sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>At the 1906 general election Pringle unsuccessfully contested the Camlachie division of Glasgow as the Liberal candidate. He entered parliament as the member for North-West Lanarkshire at the general election of January 1910, and quickly gained a reputation for his skill in the use of parliamentary procedure and tactics, which he later used to great effect. On 3 August 1914 he made an important speech in the House of Commons in support of the decision to go to war with Germany over the violation of Belgian neutrality: &#145;We who hold to the Liberal tradition, and still honour Mr Gladstone's ideas, are bound in a conflict of this kind to range ourselves on the side of international morality against the forces of blood and iron&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 66, 1880). But he subsequently objected to what he regarded as the oppressive methods used to carry out the war, opposing conscription and other aspects of the <span class="roman">Military Service Acts</span>.<br>
<br>After the Liberal split which saw Lloyd George become leader of a new coalition government in late 1916, Pringle became one of the most determined and vocal critics of the new prime minister, whom he personally &#145;detested&#146;  (Wilson, 332). He and James Myles Hogge became known as the &#145;terrible twins&#146; who kept up the attack on the Lloyd George government in defence, as they saw it, of true Liberal beliefs and individual liberty. Pringle strongly condemned Lloyd George's manipulation of his &#145;Kept Press&#146;  (Owen, 467).<br>
<br>Pringle lost his seat in the 1918 &#145;coupon&#146; election, when he came third behind a coalition Conservative and a Labour candidate at Glasgow Springburn, and he was again third in a by-election at Manchester Rusholme in October 1919. After coming second in a by-election at Yorkshire Penistone in March 1921, he was returned for that seat in the 1922 general election and held it in the following year. He had developed&#151;after earlier being a critic&#151;a fierce loyalty to Asquith, and he maintained this throughout his second period in the house, alongside his peculiar ability to annoy and distract ministers through his use of parliamentary tactics. <span class="italic">The Times</span> noted that it &#145;was said that Labour Ministers dreaded nothing more than the guerrilla warfare of Mr Pringle on the Liberal benches&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 2 April 1928, 19). Asquith wrote of parliament in 1924 that &#145;This would be the dullest place in Europe but for Pringle &hellip; he is far the most resourceful Parliamentarian in the House&#146;  (Asquith, 211).<br>
<br>In 1924 Pringle was invited to join the Liberal &#145;shadow cabinet&#146; under Asquith, but in the general election of October 1924 lost his seat. Following the election, an &#145;angry meeting&#146;  (Owen, 684) of around one hundred defeated Liberal candidates was held, with Pringle in the chair. Much of the blame for their defeat they attributed to Lloyd George's failure to direct sufficiently the resources of his &#145;Lloyd George Fund&#146; towards the general benefit of the party in the election. At this meeting the Liberal and Radical Candidates' Association was formed and Pringle, as its first chairman, sought to have this body gain a formal say in the choice of the parliamentary leadership.<br>
<br>Pringle also played a significant role in the formation of the Liberal Council in 1927 and was largely responsible for its monthly publication, <span class="italic">Burdens on Industry</span>. He attempted to return to parliament, and at the time of his death he was the prospective candidate for Paisley, which had previously been held by Asquith. His loyalty, in his later years, to Asquith was unquestioned, and his ability to keep ministers of whatever party on their toes, sometimes almost as a lone voice, was widely respected. Although not in office he played an influential role in the parliaments of his period. He died of heart failure at his home, Hampton, 10 Sutherland Grove, Southfields, Surrey, on 1 April 1928, and was buried on 5 April.<br>
