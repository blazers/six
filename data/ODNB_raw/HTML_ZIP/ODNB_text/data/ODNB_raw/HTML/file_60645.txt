<span class="headword">Blackwood, Lady  Caroline Maureen  Hamilton-Temple-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Caroline Blackwood]</span>  (1931&#150;1996), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 16 July 1931, at 4 Hans Crescent, Knightsbridge, London, the eldest of three children of Basil Sheridan Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, fourth marquess of Dufferin and Ava (1909&#150;1945), and his wife, Maureen Constance Guinness (1907&#150;1998), socialite and one of the &#145;fabulous Guinness girls&#146; of the 1920s. Caroline was the great-granddaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33601/', "Edward Cecil Guinness, first earl of Iveagh (1847&#150;1927)")</script>, and of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31914/', "Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, first marquess of Dufferin and Ava (1826&#150;1902)")</script>, governor-general of Canada and viceroy of India. She was scantily educated at Rockport Preparatory School for Boys, Brillantmont School, Lausanne, and Downham School for Girls, Essex, and had an unhappy childhood at the family seat at Clandeboye in Ulster. After a finishing school in Oxford, she came out as a d&eacute;butante in 1949 at a ball held at Londonderry House. As a teenager she was plump, ungainly, and lacking in confidence; her stockings were always falling down. However, she had huge avid blue eyes and wonderful blonde hair, and after losing weight developed into a captivating beauty and a sensational d&eacute;butante.<br>
<br>Blackwood then took a secretarial job with the Hulton Press, and was given small reporting assignments by Claud Cockburn. Ann Fleming introduced Blackwood to the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/103935/', "Lucian Michael Freud (1922&#150;2011)")</script>, with whom she eloped to Paris in 1952. There she met Picasso, and did not wash for three days after he drew on her hands and fingernails. After their marriage on 9 December 1953 she became a striking figure in London's <i>haute boh&egrave;me</i>: the Gargoyle Club and Colony Room replaced Belgravia drawing-rooms as her haunts. She sat for several of Freud's finest portraits, notably <span class="italic">Girl in Bed</span>, which testify to her outstanding allure. Cyril Connolly's attentions to Blackwood became so unequivocal that Freud ambushed him in Soho and kicked his shins. She was impressed by the ruthless vision of Freud and of Francis Bacon, and her later fiction was a literary version of their view of humanity.<br>
<br>After her marriage had disintegrated Blackwood moved in 1957 to New York, where she studied acting at the Stella Adler school. She had relationships with the editor of the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> Alan Ross (1922&#150;2001) and with the Anglo-American screenwriter Ivan Moffat (1918&#150;2002). She also went to Hollywood, appeared in an Italian film, and had a small part in the television series <span class="italic">Have Gun Will Travel</span> in the 1950s. Her marriage to Freud was dissolved in Mexico in 1958. Meeting her that year Christopher Isherwood noted, &#145;Caroline was round eyed as usual, either dumb or scared&#146;. As a dinner guest he thought her &#145;a frost&#146;  (Isherwood, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 1.768, 814). On 15 August 1959, in Yonkers, she married Israel Citkowitz (1909&#150;1974), a composer with a creative block. They had three daughters (although a deathbed admission revealed that Ivan Moffat was the father of Ivana).<br>
<br>In the early 1960s Blackwood began contributing to <span class="italic">Encounter</span>, the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, and other periodicals on such subjects as beatniks, Ulster sectarianism, women's lib theatre, and New York free schools. Although these articles were elegant, minutely observed, and sometimes wickedly funny, they had, according to Isherwood, a persistent flaw: &#145;She is only capable of thinking negatively. Confronted by a phenomenon, she asks herself: what is wrong with it?&#146;  (Isherwood, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 803). During the mid-1960s she had an affair with Robert Benjamin (Bob) Silvers (<i>b</i>. 1929), founder and co-editor of the <span class="italic">New York Review of Books</span> (1963). Although her marriage to Citkowitz was sundered, he continued to live near her and served as her gentle nanny-duenna until his death.<br>
<br>After returning to London, in April 1970 Blackwood began a relationship with the manic-depressive American poet Robert Traill Spence Lowell (1917&#150;1977), who was then a visiting professor at All Souls College, Oxford. Their son was born on 28 September 1971, and after obtaining divorces from their spouses in Santo Domingo, they married on 21 October 1972 and lived in London, in Milgate, Kent, and later in Castletown, co. Kildare. The sequence of poems in Lowell's <span class="italic">The Dolphin</span> (1973) provides a disrupted narrative of his involvement with Blackwood and the birth of their son. She was distressed and confused in her reactions to Lowell's manic episodes. She felt useless during his attacks, and afraid of their effects on her children. Her anxieties, alcohol-related illnesses, and late-night tirades exacerbated his condition. The turmoil and tension of their relationship were aggravated by the chaos of their domestic arrangements. During 1976&#150;7 the marriage disintegrated. Lowell died clutching a Freud portrait of Blackwood, in the back seat of a New York taxi, on his way to resume life with his second wife, Elizabeth Hardwick.<br>
<br>Despite their marital anguish, Lowell was crucial to Blackwood's development as a novelist. He encouraged her, as Caroline Blackwood, to assemble her first book, a collection of stories and reportage, with a title from an Ulster protestant marching song, <span class="italic">For All that I Found there</span> (1973), and a coruscating memoir of her daughter's treatment in a burns unit. Blackwood's first novel, <span class="italic">The Stepdaughter</span> (1976), is a concise, gripping monologue by a rich, self-pitying woman deserted by her husband in a luxurious New York apartment and tormented by her fat, stodgy stepdaughter. Like much of Blackwood's fictional writing, it has a claustrophobic emotional intensity as it demonstrates how a selfish woman's emotional state distorts her perception and treatment of other people. <span class="italic">The Stepdaughter</span>, which won the David Higham prize for the best first novel of the year, has Blackwood's hallmark: exactitude, wit, and sensitivity as well as the relentless tone of resentment characteristic of her narratives. Its female fury is chilling.<br>
<br>The tone in much of Blackwood's fiction was that of a prodigious and observant child: knowing, unhappy, and helpless in the power of cruel, devious, or emotionally suffocating adults. This temper was particularly conspicuous in her second novel, <span class="italic">Great Granny Webster</span> (1977), which was partly based on her own miserable childhood. She depicted an austere and loveless old woman's destructive impact on her daughter and granddaughter. The cumulative effect is of blistering resentment, grief, and despair that nothing can palliate. It impressed Philip Larkin and was also short-listed for the Booker prize.<br>
<br>As a result of the punitive taxation levied by the Callaghan government Blackwood left England in 1977 and took an apartment in the great Georgian house of Castletown in co. Kildare, which was convenient for Guinness family parties. One of her last serious relationships was with the poet and fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, Andrew Harvey (<i>b</i>. 1951). The death of her eldest daughter Natalya in 1978 further demoralized her; her love of children had impressed Elizabeth Bishop, but she was sometimes a difficult mother.<br>
<br>In 1980 Blackwood wrote a study of the relations between the duchess of Windsor and her cunning lawyer, Ma&icirc;tre Suzanne Blum. This malicious, macabre, zestful, and muddled book proved impossible to publish during Blum's lifetime and was eventually issued as <span class="italic">The Last of the Duchess</span> (1995). Blackwood's third novel, a misanthropic psychological thriller, <span class="italic">The Fate of Mary Rose</span> (1981), describes the effect on a Kent village of the rape and murder of a ten-year-old girl, Maureen. Narrated by a selfish historian whose obsessions destroy his domestic life, it is a pitiless investigation of neurosis, cruelty, and panic. <span class="italic">Good Night Sweet Ladies</span> (1983) is a collection of five short stories. &#145;Olga&#146; is perhaps the most intensely personal; but Blackwood's depiction of annihilating egotists who are variously bullying, reclusive, vain, or self-deceiving is so implacable and gruesome that the reader can feel as overwhelmed as Lowell did by her late-night tirades. The stories' power and emotional precision are, however, undeniable. Her final novel, <span class="italic">Corrigan</span> (1984), was least successful. It depicted the effects on a depressed widow of a charming, energetic but sinister cripple who erupts into her life.<br>
<br>Blackwood's later books were based on interviews and vignettes. <span class="italic">On the Perimeter: Caroline Blackwood at Greenham Common</span> (1984) contained her observations of the peace women's encampment outside an American air base in Berkshire. She also published a personal account of hunting and hunt saboteurs, <span class="italic">In the Pink</span> (1987). In this reflective yet ghoulish book she deployed her powers at depicting obsessive personalities of both fox-hunters and animal rights activists. Together with Anna Haycraft (Alice Thomas Ellis) she compiled a cookbook for the expeditious <span class="italic">Darling, you shouldn't have Gone to so much Trouble</span> (1980). Its recipes by, among others, Tallulah Bankhead, Quentin Crisp, and Roald Dahl, were described by Anita Brookner as &#145;<i>cuisine grosseur</i> with a vengeance&#146;  (Brookner, 1282).<br>
<br>James Lees-Milne found Blackwood &#145;a difficult girl&#146; in 1980: &#145;Chain-smoking, churchyard cough, beautiful blue staring eyes, raddled complexion&#146;  (Lees-Milne, 101). She returned to the USA in 1987, settling at Sag Harbor, Long Island. Although her powers were depleted by alcoholism, her occasional writings&#151;such as a vivid memoir of Princess Margaret and Francis Bacon  (<span class="italic">New York Review of Books</span>, 24 Sept 1992)&#151;remained exceptional. She died of cancer on 14 February 1996, at the Mayfair Hotel, Park Avenue and East 65th Street, New York. Her mordant humour was never quelled. On her deathbed Anna Haycraft brought some holy water from Lourdes which was accidentally splashed on her bed-sheets. &#145;I might have caught my death,&#146; Blackwood muttered  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). Before her death she had been working on a novel about a transsexual.<br>
