<span class="headword">Quinil <span class="st"> [Quivil]</span>,  Peter</span>  (<em>c.</em>1230&#150;1291), <span class="occ">bishop of Exeter</span>, was the son of Peter Quinil, provost of Exeter, and his wife, Helewis. Until recently the surname was interpreted as Quivil, but it appears to be a variant of the modern name Quen(n)ell or Quin(n)ell. Peter was also called &#145;de Exonia&#146; during his lifetime. The fact that he was styled master in 1262 when he resigned his first known benefice, the rectory of Mullion in Cornwall, may imply that he received a university education. He became archdeacon of St David's in 1263 and was made a canon of Exeter Cathedral by Bishop Walter of Bronescombe in 1276. After Walter's death on 22 July 1280, Quinil was elected bishop of Exeter by his fellow canons between 4 August and 7 October; he was consecrated in Canterbury Cathedral by Richard of Gravesend, bishop of London (<i>d</i>. 1303), on 10 November.<br>
<br>Quinil did not hold major royal offices while bishop, and spent most of his episcopate in Devon and Cornwall, undertaking only short visits to London. He continued the work of previous bishops rather than making significant new departures. His most notable achievement in the diocese was to hold a synod in April 1287, which enacted fifty-six canons in the tradition of thirteenth-century ecclesiastical legislation. These regulated the sacraments, duties of the clergy, functioning of parish churches, and behaviour of the laity, and were copied, kept, and referred to in the diocese until the fifteenth century. In Exeter he joined together some of the small city parishes to make more viable units, but he was later accused of obstructing the attempts of the local Franciscan friars to move to a better site. His episcopal register&#151;the second to survive in Exeter diocese&#151;is partly extant in a volume of twenty-four folios but these are chiefly limited to the years 1281&#150;4. The state of the diocese in his day is also well illustrated by the lists of ecclesiastical revenues contained in the <span class="italic">Taxatio</span> of Pope Nicholas IV conducted in 1291.<br>
<br>Quinil gave much attention to his cathedral. In 1281 and 1283 he issued statutes regulating its liturgy, commemorative anniversaries (obits), finances, and its clergy's dress and behaviour. He completed its administrative structure on national lines by ordering the chancellor in 1283 to lecture on theology or canon law and by instituting the office of subdean in 1284. He also gave the cathedral the tithes of nine churches in the diocese, either for specific dignitaries or for the chapter as a whole. In 1281, one of the canons, John Pycot, was elected dean in dubious circumstances. Quinil refused to recognize him, inaugurating a struggle between his own supporters, led by the precentor Walter of Lechlade, and those of Pycot. The latter had the backing of Archbishop John Pecham, whose relations with Quinil were generally poor. On 10 November 1283 Lechlade was murdered outside the cathedral on his way to matins. Nineteen local clergy and laity were implicated in the deed, and Edward I visited Exeter in December 1285 to see that justice was done. The mayor and four other laymen were hanged; Pycot, deprived of the deanery, retired to a monastery. On 1 January 1286 the king gave permission for the cathedral close to be surrounded by walls and gates to protect the clergy at night. The gates remained until the nineteenth century, symbolizing the uneasy relationship between the city and the cathedral.<br>
<br>Quinil's other legacy to the cathedral was architectural. His predecessor Walter of Bronescombe had begun to transform the Norman building into a Gothic structure by building a new lady chapel. Quinil continued this work, and although it is not clear who conceived the idea of rebuilding the main church on Gothic lines, he was regarded after his death as &#145;first founder of the new work&#146; and was said to have contributed to it at his own expense  (Erskine, 1.xiii). During his episcopate, the lady chapel was finished and work began on the presbytery, the choir aisles, and two double chapels, following a plan similar to that of Salisbury Cathedral but on a smaller scale. Further west, the two Norman towers of the cathedral were opened to the interior and made into transepts with chapels on their eastern sides to accommodate altars. This work caused the cathedral to grow larger and more complex, reflecting a growth in the number of clergy and their liturgical functions.<br>
<br>Quinil died on 1 October 1291, choking on syrup according to a local story, which attributed his death to his hostility towards the friars. He was buried before the altar of the new lady chapel under an incised marble slab bearing a foliated cross and the inscription &#145;Petra tegit Petrum: nichil officiat sibi tetrum&#146; (&#145;The stone covers Peter; may nothing do you [Peter] harm&#146;). The tomb is modest and the bishop founded no chantry, but the cathedral chapter later endowed an anniversary mass in his honour.<br>
