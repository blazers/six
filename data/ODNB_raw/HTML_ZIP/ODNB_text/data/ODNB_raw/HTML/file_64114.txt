<span class="headword">Eliot,  Edward James</span>  (1758&#150;1797), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Port Eliot in Cornwall on 24 August 1758, the first surviving of four sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8627/', "Edward Craggs-Eliot (1727&#150;1804)")</script>, politician, of Port Eliot, created Baron Eliot in 1784, and his wife, Catherine (<i>c</i>.1735&#150;1804), daughter and heir of Edward Elliston of Gestingthorpe, Essex, an East India Company captain. Schooled at Liskeard, he entered Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1775, where he became friends with the future premier, William Pitt; he proceeded MA in 1780. Eliot sat in parliament on the family interest, for St Germans, from 1780, and for Liskeard from 1784, though in 1790 he was elected for both. He had acted with the opposition to North but, supporting Shelburne, was placed at the Treasury board from July 1782 to April 1783, and again, after opposing the Fox&#150;North coalition, from December 1783, in Pitt's ministry. That autumn, with William Wilberforce, he had accompanied Pitt to France.<br>
<br>Eliot was appointed king's remembrancer in the exchequer in 1785, worth &pound;1500 a year, as a prelude to marrying, on 24 September 1785, Pitt's sister Lady Harriot (1758&#150;1786), younger daughter of William Pitt, first earl of Chatham, and Hester Grenville. A year later she died, survived by her newborn daughter, Harriot, on 25 September 1786. In mourning, Eliot espoused religion and a virtuous life. Resident at Broomfield, Clapham, near Wilberforce's home, he participated in his philanthropic causes: the Proclamation Society, prison reform, poor relief, and abolition of the slave trade, for which he voted. He supported a Sunday observance bill in the Commons on 26 March 1795. Wilberforce taxed him with lobbying Pitt for the &#145;Saints&#146;, and with mediating between himself and Pitt. He had been credited with stopping succession by purchase to exchequer clerkships.<br>
<br>Not a ready debater, Eliot acted as a government teller in the house. His bill to stop corruption in Stockbridge elections was lost on 27 May 1793. Soon afterwards he became joint commissioner for Indian affairs, resigning for health reasons from the Treasury board. He became a captain in the Cornish fencibles in 1794. He invested in East India Company stock, and in February 1797 his friends expected him to become governor-general of Bengal. The return of a chronic stomach disorder ruled him out. Privy that summer to a plan of Pitt's to resign, he died at Port Eliot on 20 September 1797, to the dismay of Pitt and Wilberforce, the latter maintaining that Eliot's unpretentious demeanour had caused his intelligence and character to be underestimated. He was buried at St Germans on 3 October. His brother John, fellow member for Liskeard, succeeded to the barony and was created earl of St Germans in 1815. Eliot's only child, Harriot Hester Eliot, married William Henry Pringle, later lieutenant-general, on 20 May 1806.<br>
