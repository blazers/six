<span class="headword">Smyly <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Franks]</span>,  Ellen</span>  (1815&#150;1901), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was probably born in Dublin, the third daughter of Matthew Franks of Merrion Square, Dublin, and Jerpoint Hill, Thomastown, co. Kilkenny. Little is known of her early life. In 1834 she married Josiah Smyly (1804&#150;1864), a surgeon at the Meath Hospital in Dublin and later vice-president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. The couple had twelve children, four sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36172/', "Philip Crampton Smyly")</script>, and eight daughters, of whom two died in infancy.<br>
<br>Smyly is best known for her philanthropic work with children. When she was seventeen she engaged in home and hospital visitation of the poor in Dublin, inspired by religious idealism. Her granddaughter later claimed that Smyly &#145;seemed to hear a voice insistently saying to her &#147;Take these children and nurse them for Me&#148;&#146;  (Smyly, 4). She opened her first <span class="roman">Bible</span> school in a disused forge in Harmony Row, near Grand Canal Street, about 1850. Smyly was active at a time when the evangelical missionary movement had been revitalized in Ireland, particularly in Dublin, and she became a close friend of Alexander Dallas, founder of the Irish Church Missions. The Irish Church Missions, which aimed to &#145;communicate the gospel to the Roman Catholics and Converts of Ireland&#146;, was a highly organized society which claimed fifty-one local committees in Ireland by 1854. Proselytizing activities made the mission controversial and aroused the ire of Catholics, both clerical and lay. Nevertheless, it was in conjunction with Dallas that Smyly began her day schools in Dublin, which operated in Townsend Street, Grand Canal Street, The Coombe, Lurgan Street, and Luke Street. Each school had its own committee but the same members sat on several of the committees. Smyly and her daughters Ellen, Annie, and Harriet taught in the schools, and, in order to raise money for them, Smyly addressed meetings all over England and Ireland. She also wrote numerous letters and appeals which appeared in newspapers. Thomas Barnardo (1845&#150;1905) became a close friend and was very much influenced by Smyly's work, going on to establish a chain of homes for destitute children in England from 1870.<br>
<br>Once the day schools had been established Smyly opened residential homes in the same areas of Dublin. Working closely with the Irish Church Missions she targeted the very poorest Catholics. She opened an orphanage called the Bird's Nest in 1859 in Kingstown. Here the children were supported from public subscriptions but the teachers were paid by the Irish Church Missions. Smyly also founded the magazine <span class="italic">Erin's Hope</span>, which was published monthly. She experienced considerable opposition to her enterprises from the Catholic community, and very public battles for &#145;the souls of children&#146; raged between Catholic and protestant from the pulpits, through the press, and on the street. Ellen Smyly died on 16 May 1901 at her home, 8 Merrion Square, Dublin. She left seven homes and four day schools which were carried on by members of her family.<br>
