<span class="headword">Wedderburn,  David</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1580, <em>d.</em> 1646), <span class="occ">poet and Latin grammarian</span>, was baptized in the parish church of Aberdeen on 2 January 1580, the eldest son of William Wedderburn (1550?&#150;1620), a burgess of the town, and Marjorie Annand. There is some confusion as to where Wedderburn completed his education. Although Marischal College, Aberdeen, appears to be the strongest contender, it is possible that he matriculated at the University of St Andrews during the period 1598&#150;1600. He was appointed as a master in the grammar school of Aberdeen in April 1602 but resigned his post the following year with the intention of pursuing a clerical vocation. For reasons unknown he appears to have abandoned this aim and returned in 1603 to his teaching post in the grammar school, where he remained until failing health compelled him to resign the rectorship in 1640. He married twice. On 30 April 1611 he married Janet Johnstone, with whom he had a son who was baptized on 25 March 1612 but whose name went unrecorded in the parish register of Aberdeen. Janet died on 29 October 1613 and was buried in the church of St Nicholas, Aberdeen, where Wedderburn had a monument erected in her memory. On 25 October the next year he married Bathia Mowat, with whom he had two sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>Wedderburn was granted a professorship and taught humanities in Marischal College after the death of Gilbert Gray in 1614. A complaint from the civic authorities, however, forced him to resign this charge ten years later in order that he might focus solely on raising standards in the grammar school. In February 1628 he successfully petitioned the town council to have Andrew Howat appointed to teach arithmetic in the grammar school. In July of that same year and &#145;for the godlie and vertuous educatioun and teaching of the youth in pietie, gude letters, and gude maneres&#146;  (<span class="italic">Extracts from the Records of the Burgh of Aberdeen, 1625&#150;1642</span>), Alexander Fraser was added to the teaching staff after an anonymous benefactor bequeathed 500 merks for that purpose. Wedderburn's own annual salary was boosted by 80 merks in September 1629. On resigning his post in 1640 he received a pension of 200 merks in recognition of his service to education in the burgh.<br>
<br>Wedderburn was a Latin poet and scholar of notable distinction. In 1612, after the premature death of Prince Henry, he composed <span class="italic">In obitum summae spei principis Henrici, Jacobi VI</span>, which was printed by Andrew Hart the following year. In 1617 the town council of Aberdeen paid him 500 merks for the compilation of <span class="italic">Invictissimo et potentissimo monarchae Jacobi VI, Britanniae magnae</span> and <span class="italic">Propempticon charitum Abredonionsium</span>, which were read to King James at Falkland Palace on 19 May 1617. On 6 February 1620 Wedderburn was made poet laureate of Aberdeen, for which he received an annual sum of 80 merks from the city magistrates. On 14 August that same year he was awarded the freedom of the city. It was probably at the prompting of the town council that he produced a Latin poem on the death of the king in 1625, entitled <span class="italic">Abredonia atrata sub obitum serenissimi et potentissimi monarchae Jacobi VI</span>, which was printed by Edward Raban.<br>
<br>In 1633 Wedderburn composed <span class="italic">Vivat rex</span> on the visit of Charles I to Scotland. In 1635 he also contributed to the <span class="roman">Funerals</span>, a series of verses produced in memory of Patrick Forbes, the late bishop of Aberdeen. In 1641 he composed six Latin elegies on the death of his old schoolfriend and fellow classicist Arthur Johnstone. These were later reprinted in 1731 in the <span class="italic">Poetarum Scotorum musae sacrae</span>. He produced a similar obituary in celebration of the life of George Jameson in 1644. Between 1643 and 1644 Wedderburn further compiled two volumes containing 300 moral epigrams and several elegies. Eight of his Latin poems are to be found in the <span class="italic">Delitiae poetarum Scotorum</span> compiled by Sir John Scot of Scotstarvit in 1637.<br>
<br>In spite of his prodigious output and reputation as a poet, Wedderburn was probably best known for his <span class="italic">Short Introduction to Grammar</span>, for which he received payment of &pound;100 Scots from the town council of Aberdeen. This work, which was to become a standard text on Latin in grammar schools throughout Scotland, was first published in 1632 and later reprinted several times; it was on its account that he was given the freedom of Dundee on 20 May 1632 <i>in erudiendo juventutem</i>. His <span class="italic">Institutiones grammaticae</span> and <span class="italic">Vocabula</span>, first published in 1633 and 1636 respectively, were similarly reprinted for the benefit of future generations of young Scots. In 2006 a new translation of <span class="italic">Vocabula</span> gained attention for its early description of the game of football. Wedderburn died in Aberdeen, probably on 23 October 1646. He was buried in St Nicholas's Church there.<br>
<br>Wedderburn's younger brother, <a name="cosubject_28952"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Wedderburn</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1581), was also a <span class="occ">Latin scholar</span> of some renown. He was baptized at Aberdeen on 3 September 1581; he appears to have received part of his education in England before matriculating as a bursar of Marischal College on 29 January 1623, after a successful petition by his brothers David and William secured his place. He was responsible for the preparation of <span class="italic">Persius enucleatus, sive, Commentarius exactissimus et maxime perspicuus in Persium, poetarum omnium difficillimum</span>, which was subsequently published in Amsterdam in 1664. He was probably the author of <span class="italic">Radii Augustiniani sive praecupuae S. P. Augustin in s. scripture locus annotationes</span>, published in 1652. It is not known when he died or whether he married and raised a family.<br>
<br>More is known of the chequered career of <a name="cosubject_28963"></a><span class="headword">William Wedderburn</span>  (<em>c.</em>1582&#150;1659/60), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>. He taught alongside his eldest brother, David, in the grammar school at Aberdeen in 1616/17 before his appointment as a regent in Marischal College shortly afterwards. He had burgess status conferred on him by the town of Aberdeen on 25 October 1623. On 10 June the following year he married Margaret Tullidelph, with whom he had a son, William.<br>
<br>In 1633 Wedderburn was inducted minister of Bethelnie (also named Old Meldrum) parish church in Aberdeenshire, and was officially presented to this charge by Charles I on 22 June 1636. He was a member of the famous general assemblies of 1638 and 1639 which abrogated Erastian episcopacy and re-established presbyterianism in the Church of Scotland. He was deposed for fornication in 1642 but was fully restored to the ministry by the general assembly of August the following year. Nevertheless he had to be censured and suspended yet again since on 2 November 1648 the presbytery of Aberdeen reinstated him to the pastorate. At an unknown date his first wife died, and on 22 November 1649 he married Agnes Howisone. He was subsequently, on 21 October 1651, called to the charge of Strathdon or Innernochtie, where he remained until his death at Strathdon at some date between 19 April 1659 and 19 April 1660.<br>
