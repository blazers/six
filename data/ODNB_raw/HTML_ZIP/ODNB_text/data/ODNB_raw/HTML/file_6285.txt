<span class="headword">Corbet,  Clement</span>  (<em>c.</em>1576&#150;1652), <span class="occ">civil lawyer</span>, was the sixth of eight sons of Sir Miles Corbet (<i>d</i>. 1607) of Sprowston and his first wife, Katherine, daughter of Sir Christopher Heydon. His father was high sheriff of Norfolk in 1591 and was knighted at the sacking of Cadiz in 1596. Corbet was admitted a scholar of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, on 7 December 1592, took the degree of LLB in 1598, held a fellowship at his college from 1598 to 1611, and was created LLD in 1605. In May 1607 Corbet was appointed professor of law at Gresham College, London, and occupied that chair until November 1613. He was already chancellor of the diocese of Chichester when he became master of Trinity Hall in October 1611 at the early age of about thirty-five, immediately after the death of John Cowell. On 9 May 1612 Corbet was admitted a member of the College of Advocates at Doctors' Commons. He was vice-chancellor of Cambridge University in 1613&#150;14.<br>
<br>In 1613 Corbet married Elizabeth Kemp (<i>d</i>. 1644), through whom he held Saham-Toney manor, Norfolk; they raised a family, of whom a son, Samuel, and at least four daughters survived him. The focus of Corbet's life moved to Norfolk in 1624 when he became registrar of audience and consistory courts at Norwich, continuing to adjudicate on civil litigation in the consistory court even after the abolition of the episcopacy in 1646. In 1625 he resigned the mastership of Trinity Hall and leased a house in the precincts of Norwich Cathedral, where he was appointed vicar-general and principal official to Matthew Wren, bishop of Norwich. Corbet sought a uniform and orthodox church, to which end he encouraged Wren to be more severe with the puritans. He died on 28 May 1652 and was buried in the chancel of Belaugh church, Norfolk. Samuel erected a monument to his parents, describing his father as &#145;a hammer of schism&#146;, but he was otherwise not a conspicuous figure.<br>
