<span class="headword">Macdonald,  John</span>  (1759&#150;1831), <span class="occ">military engineer and cartographer</span>, was born in Flodigarry, Isle of Skye, on 30 October 1759, the fifth and youngest son of Allan Macdonald of Kingsburgh, a captain in the 84th Royal Highland Emigrants, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17432/', "Flora Macdonald (1722&#150;1790)")</script>, the Jacobite heroine. He attended the grammar school at Portree and then the Royal High School, Edinburgh. In 1780 he was granted a cadetship in the army of the East India Company and joined the Bombay infantry. Because of his interest in fortification he transferred to the Bombay Engineers on 6 April 1782 but, unhappy with the conditions of service, he travelled to Calcutta and, through the influence of a relative, was commissioned in the Bengal Engineers instead in September 1782 and resigned his Bombay commission. As an ensign his first appointment was as assistant engineer at Bencoolen, west Sumatra.<br>
<br>In 1784 Macdonald was employed to survey the west coast of Sumatra from Batang Kapas to Padang. His survey work was of such significance that he was noted by the government as a &#145;young officer of great merit and highly deserving of encouragement&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 8) and given a brevet captaincy. The same year, at Fort Marlborough, he married Nancy Scott Bogle, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Salmon (1760/61&#150;1786), the young widow of Lawrence Bogle, a Bengal civil servant, and the daughter of George Salmon. On account of the high standard of his work, the East India Company ordered Macdonald to Pulo Penang (Penang Island) in 1786 to carry out a survey, but on arrival he found that Captain Alexander Kyd (1754&#150;1826) of the Bengal Engineers had already commenced the survey. He proceeded to Calcutta and, given revised orders, returned as military and civil engineer to Bencoolen, where he was given command of the artillery with permission to develop and test an experimental fuse he had designed, the results of which were sent to Calcutta on 4 October 1786. During the next twelve months the unhealthy climate at Bencoolen claimed his family: his wife died on 28 October 1786, shortly after giving birth to their second daughter, Nancy, who died fifteen days later; their two-year-old elder daughter died on 27 June 1787. Macdonald, however, continued to serve at Bencoolen, and was promoted lieutenant on 16 December 1794 (retaining his honorary rank of captain), and was on the Fort Marlborough establishment during an unsuccessful attack by the French that year. During his final years in Sumatra he produced a <span class="italic">Plan of Fort Marlbro and its Environs</span>, later published by Alexander Dalrymple (27 August 1797), and wrote a paper, <span class="italic">Natural Productions of Sumatra&#151;Camphor, Coral and Copper</span>, which was published in Calcutta in 1795.<br>
<br>Macdonald returned to Scotland in 1796 on sick leave. During his voyage home in a small American vessel he remained for several months on St Helena and consolidated his earlier work on variations of the magnetic needle. The results were later published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, submitted to the Royal Society, and earned him election as a fellow of the society in 1800. Many of his maps and charts were later deposited in the British Museum.<br>
<br>Macdonald was promoted captain on 8 January 1798 and, with the East India Company's permission, became a captain in the Royal Edinburgh volunteer artillery, a corps of pikemen formed from gentlemen of Edinburgh. During this service he wrote a treatise on the practice and theory of artillery. On 4 March 1799 he was commissioned as a major into Lord Macdonald's western fencibles, and served until June 1800. He took half pay on 30 July 1800, but was then promoted lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Clan alpine fencible artillery, and served with that unit in Ireland until its disbandment in 1801.<br>
<br>Following the peace of Amiens Macdonald travelled to France; he later published translations of several French military works. On 24 October 1799 he had married Frances Maria Chambers (1774/5&#150;1860), the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5078/', "Sir Robert Chambers (1737&#150;1803)")</script> and Frances Wilton; they had seven sons and two daughters. Macdonald's last military appointment was in 1804, when Pitt, as lord warden of the Cinque Ports, raised the Cinque Port Volunteers and granted him a commission as major. He held the post until the reduction of the unit in 1806.<br>
<br>Macdonald's family latterly moved to Exeter, where, in addition to his charitable works, he used his military experience to write <span class="italic">A treatise explanatory of a new system of naval, military and political telegraphic communication</span> (1817), which included his &#145;military anthropo telegraph for field service&#146;. He died at his home at Summerlands Place, Exeter, on 16 August 1831 and was buried in the south transept of Exeter Cathedral, where his grave is marked with a brass plaque. He was an exemplary military officer and engineer who received little acknowledgement during his lifetime for his years of dedicated service.<br>
