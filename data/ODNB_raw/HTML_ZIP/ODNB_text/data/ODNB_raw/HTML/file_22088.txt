<span class="headword">Phayre, Sir  Robert</span>  (1820&#150;1897), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born at Shrewsbury on 22 January 1820, was the third son of Richard Phayre of Claremont Buildings, Shrewsbury, and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22086/', "General Sir Arthur Purves Phayre")</script>. He was educated at Shrewsbury School, and commissioned ensign in the East India Company service on 26 January 1839, being posted to the 25th Bombay native infantry, and became lieutenant on 1 December 1840. He served with his regiment in the First Anglo-Afghan War, was engaged with the Baluchis under Nasir Khan at Kotra and Gandava in December 1840, and was mentioned in dispatches. He took part in the 1843 Sind War, was severely wounded at Miani, and was again mentioned in dispatches for bravery. In 1844 he was appointed assistant quartermaster-general in Sind. In 1846 he married Diana Bunbury (<i>d</i>. 1904), daughter of Captain Arnold Thompson, formerly paymaster of the 81st regiment.<br>
<br>From 1851 to 1856 Phayre was specially employed in clearing mountain roads in the southern Maratha country. In 1856&#150;7 he was involved in the organization of the expeditionary force to Persia. From March 1857 and throughout the Indian mutiny he was quartermaster-general to the Bombay army, his services being highly commended by Sir Hugh Rose (later Lord Strathnairn) on 15 May 1860. He held this appointment until 1868. He had become captain in his regiment on 28 December 1848, and was made brevet major on 16 June 1857, and major in the Bombay staff corps on 18 February 1861.<br>
<br>Phayre became brevet lieutenant-colonel on 6 January 1863, and colonel five years later. He took part in the Abyssinian expedition as quartermaster-general, was mentioned in dispatches, and was made CB and aide-de-camp to the queen. From 1868 to 1872 he was political superintendent of the Sind frontier, and commandant of the frontier force. In March 1873 he was appointed resident at Baroda. He made strong representations of the misgovernment of the Maharaja Gaikwar, Malhar Rao, and a commission which investigated his charges found that they were substantially proved. The Gaikwar was warned and advised to change his minister, but matters did not improve. The friction between Phayre and the Gaikwar increased, and at the instigation of the latter an attempt was made on 9 November 1874 to poison Phayre, by putting arsenic and diamond dust in his sherbet. The Baroda trial followed, and led to the deposition of the Gaikwar on 23 April 1875. But the Indian government had previously decided to change the resident at Baroda, and Phayre, declining to resign, was superseded by Sir Lewis Pelly on 25 November 1874.<br>
<br>Reverting to military employment, Phayre commanded a brigade, first in Bombay and afterwards in Rajputana, from 10 May 1875 to 4 May 1880. Having been promoted major-general on 1 January 1880, he was then appointed to command the reserve division of the army engaged in the second campaign of the Second Anglo-Afghan War, and had charge of the line of communication by Quetta to Kandahar. After the disaster of Maiwand (27 July 1880), Phayre was directed to push forward to Kandahar, which was being besieged by Ayub Khan, but was delayed by a lack of troops and transport, as well as by tribal uprising as a result of Maiwand, and Kandahar was relieved by Roberts before his arrival. Phayre was mentioned in dispatches, and made KCB on 22 February 1881. He commanded with distinction a division of the Bombay army from 1 March 1881 to 2 March 1886, and for some months acted as commander-in-chief at Bombay. On 22 January 1887 he was placed on the unemployed supernumerary list. He had become lieutenant-general on 1 November 1881, and became general on 22 January 1889. He received the GCB on 26 May 1894.<br>
<br>Phayre was active in religious and philanthropic movements, and published pamphlets including <span class="italic">The Bible versus Corrupt Christianity</span> (1890) and <span class="italic">Monasticism Unveiled</span> (1890). He died at his home, 64 St George's Square, Pimlico, London, on 28 January 1897.<br>
