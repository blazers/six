<span class="headword">Stonor, Sir  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1281&#150;1354), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was the eldest son of Richard Stonor, a prosperous freeholder of Stonor, Oxfordshire. Trained as a lawyer, he was called to the bar of the common bench as a serjeant-at-law in 1311 and his rapid promotion shows his outstanding ability, even though he lived in a time of unprecedented opportunities for lay lawyers as the clerical monopoly relaxed. In 1315 he was made a king's serjeant, one of the first group so appointed on a regular basis, and on 16 October 1320 he was appointed one of the justices of the common pleas. He kept the office until 1329 except for the period from July 1323 to 3 May 1324 when he served as a justice of the king's bench, as part of a determined campaign to assert the rule of law. As a justice he was knighted; his title is first found in 1324.<br>
<br>In 1329 Stonor was made chief baron of the exchequer on 22 February and chief justice of common pleas on 3 September, but on 2 March 1331 he was removed from the chief justiceship and appointed second justice on 1 April following. This was perhaps part of Edward III's policy of replacing earlier officers once he began his personal rule, though there is no evidence that Stonor was ever involved in politics. On 7 July 1335 he was reappointed chief justice. Stonor was among those removed from office on 30 November 1340 in a purge of the administration, and for a time he was imprisoned in the Tower of London and at Nottingham Castle. But he was restored to office on 9 May 1342 and remained chief justice until 22 February 1354, when he retired owing to weakness, though he remained on the king's council until his death.<br>
<br>Almost the whole of Stonor's career was at the common bench at Westminster (at York in 1327&#150;9 and 1334&#150;6), but he had many extra commissions, mainly in the south and midlands. These included oyer and terminer, gaol delivery, and special inquiries into such matters as the disturbances at Bury St Edmunds and Abingdon Abbey in 1327 and at Oxford in 1335; the misconduct of officials in 1323 and 1331&#150;4; and the trial of rebels in 1323, 1327, and 1331. A review of the trial of Otto Grandson for misgovernment of the Channel Islands in 1319 and diplomatic missions to France in 1324 and Spain in 1325 were among Stonor's overseas commissions.<br>
<br>In 1335 the priory of Christ Church, Canterbury, was engaged in litigation and the prior, seeking &#145;a great man to maintain our right&#146;, suggested Stonor as seneschal since he was &#145;prudent, well known and beloved among the great&#146;  (Sheppard, 2.85&#150;7). Stonor declined, though he had been legal adviser to the priory for many years, and suggested another. This incident demonstrates both Stonor's reputation and the widespread practice among landowners of retaining, on a long term, both advocates and judges, which constituted an important source of lawyers' incomes. Among others who retained him were the Black Prince and John Droxford, bishop of Bath and Wells. It is likely that such patrons facilitated Stonor's education and that of his brothers.<br>
<br>Stonor acquired valuable lands in nine counties, mainly in southern England, and properties in London and Westminster. In 1349 he had licence to endow a college of priests and built a wing adjoining his chapel at Stonor to accommodate them. He was a patron of the convent at Little Marlow, near Stonor, where his two sisters and his daughter were nuns. His wife, whom he had married by <i>c</i>.1314, was Maud or Matilda (most probably Fitzlewis, but possibly Bevill or Lisle). They had six sons and five daughters. Stonor died on 24 or 31 August 1354 (or possibly on 9 September 1354). In the abbey church of Dorchester in Oxfordshire is the effigy of a judge bearing the Stonor arms, almost certainly John Stonor; it may indicate that he was buried there. His eldest son, also <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63922/', "John Stonor")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52796/', "Stonor family")</script>], inherited. At the end of the twentieth century the family still continued at Stonor in the male line.<br>
