<span class="headword">Stelfox,  Arthur Wilson</span>  (1883&#150;1972), <span class="occ">naturalist</span>, was born in Belfast on 15 December 1883, the youngest child of James Stelfox (1842&#150;1910), civil engineer, and his wife, Jennie McIlwaine, daughter of the rector of St George's, Belfast. After attending Campbell College in Belfast, he went in 1907 to London to train as an architect; he became an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1909.<br>
<br>Early interested in natural history, Stelfox was publishing papers on molluscs as early as 1904 and on Irish plants by 1906. He took part in the Royal Irish Academy's Clare Island survey of 1909, 1910, and 1912, and considered his resulting report on the land and freshwater Mollusca of the area, published in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy</span> in 1912, to be his best paper. Unhappy with Woodward's 1913 monograph on the small freshwater bivalves <i>Pisidium</i>, Stelfox, Charles Oldham, and R. A. Phillips formed the <i>Pisidium</i>-Club, a collaboration which resulted in a definitive paper in the <span class="italic">Journal of Conchology</span> in 1918 (the species <i>Neopisidium Stelfoxi</i> Pirogov &amp; Starobogatov was later named in his honour).<br>
<br>In 1914 Stelfox married Margarita Dawson (Daisy) Mitchell (1886&#150;1971), a botanist who published much on the Mycetozoa (slime moulds) in Ireland. About this time he also began pioneering experiments in the breeding of land snails (<i>Helix aspersa</i> and various species of <i>Cepaea</i>), work which was published in the <span class="italic">Journal of Conchology</span> in 1915, 1918, and 1968.<br>
<br>In 1920 Stelfox joined the staff of the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin. From this time he began to specialize in the Hymenoptera (particularly parasitic Hymenoptera). He ordered the pioneer collection of A. H. Haliday which had been reduced to chaos some hundred years earlier and prepared a number of public exhibits. Although he acted as <i>de facto</i> keeper for a number of years, Stelfox was unsuccessful in gaining the post on a permanent basis; in 1930 Patrick O'Connor was appointed instead. During his years at the museum Stelfox became increasingly interested in (and skilled at) the identification of animals from remains found at various archaeological sites; an important paper on the subject was published in 1938 in <span class="italic">Irish Naturalists' Journal</span> (a journal he had been instrumental in establishing in the mid-1920s).<br>
<br>Stelfox retired from the museum in 1948. In 1956 he moved from Dublin to co. Down, taking with him the plants which had made his garden at Harolds Cross so well known (he was said to have had every British species of <i>Carex</i> in cultivation and also grew plants extinct in their wild habitats in Ireland). As in Dublin, his Down residence was an open house to which younger botanists were always welcome. Until 1972 he continued to produce a steady stream of papers, many of which appeared in the <span class="italic">Irish Naturalists' Journal</span>. Between 1927 and 1966 he published eleven major entomological papers in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy</span>; his full malacological bibliography comprised eighty-two titles. With his wife he wrote <span class="italic">The National Programme for Rural Science or Nature Study</span> (1928) addressed to teachers of rural science, at that time a popular subject with Irish educationists. In 1966 he donated his Hymenoptera collection to the Smithsonian Institution; it then numbered in excess of 90,000 specimens. Beirne's vilification of Stelfox in the entomological supplement to the <span class="italic">Irish Naturalists' Journal</span> (1985) was an undeserved treatment of a man who was generous, endlessly patient with enquiries, and scrupulously honest in his dealings. Stelfox died in Downshire Hospital, Downpatrick, co. Down, on 19 May 1972. He was buried at the city cemetery in Belfast.<br>
