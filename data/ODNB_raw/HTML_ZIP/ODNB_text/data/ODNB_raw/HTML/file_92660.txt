</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sisson,  Charles Hubert</span>  (1914&#150;2003), <span class="occ">poet, essayist, and civil servant</span>, was born on 22 April 1914 at 468 Stapleton Road, Bristol, the third of four children of Richard Percy Sisson and his wife, Ellen Minnie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Worlock. His father, who came from Kendal in Westmorland, kept a watch and clock repair shop in Bristol. Business was poor, and when his father later qualified as an optician the family was saved from probable ruin. Sisson was born above the shop. His mother was the daughter of a tenant farmer from Wiltshire, who later moved to a farm near Bristol. This rural connection and &#145;the faint intonation and marked rhythms of west country speech&#146; in his mother's voice were to mean much to Sisson, providing a link with &#145;centuries of the spoken word&#146;  (<span class="italic">On the Lookout</span>, 233). Poetry was for him always a matter of the spoken word, the more plainly spoken the better.<br>
<br>The impoverished and in other ways strained circumstances of Sisson's boyhood, as they were suggested by <span class="italic">On the Lookout</span> (1989) and other autobiographical writings, were keenly felt by him. A certain harshness or awkwardness remained for him a touchstone of the real (though by no means the only one) in his own writing and that of others. A close attachment of his boyhood was to a younger sister, badly disabled and confined to the house, who died when he was fourteen. Sisson also spoke of himself, a little later, as &#145;struck down by an appalling adolescent grief&#146;  (<span class="italic">In Two Minds</span>, 271). Both events played a part in confirming the view of life, at once bleak and passionate, which his poems later revealed.<br>
<br>Sisson was bookish from an early age. He attended Fairfield secondary school and went on to Bristol University, where he read philosophy and English literature, specializing in the seventeenth century, a study which continued throughout his life. After graduation in 1934 he spent a year in Germany, followed by six months in Paris. His revulsion at Nazi Germany was matched by a love of France and of its literature which always remained with him. He shared the 1930s obsession with politics, and a preoccupation with the <i>res publica</i> would be central to his writing. But he differed from his <i>bien-pensant</i> contemporaries by thinking in terms of national interests, rather than of ideologies.<br>
<br>On his return to England, with no other employment in prospect, Sisson took the civil service examination and in 1936 entered the Ministry of Labour. On 20 August 1937 he married Nora Gilbertson (1914&#150;2003), whom he had known as a girl at school. She was a teacher, and daughter of Anthony Huddleston Gilbertson, also a teacher. There were two daughters of the marriage. Being over twenty-five and in a reserved occupation, Sisson was unable to volunteer at the outbreak of the Second World War. He enlisted in the army in January 1942, and was sent to India, where he spent the years until 1945 in the ranks, becoming a sergeant. The experience of these years was recorded in <span class="italic">One Eye on India</span> (published with <span class="italic">On the Lookout</span> in 1989). It also appeared in his excellent first novel, <span class="italic">An Asiatic Romance</span> (1953). This period of enforced exile strengthened Sisson's always powerful sense of patriotic attachment. His reaction to &#145;the endless elusiveness of Hinduism&#146;  (<span class="italic">Is there a Church of England?</span> 1993, 5) also helped to set in motion his slow approach to the Anglican church.<br>
<br>From the army Sisson returned to the civil service. Of his career there after this time he wrote in &#145;The Pleasers&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>All that remains is to tell how, later,<br>
</div>
<div>I became a top person in my way<br>
</div>
</blockquote>adding wryly<blockquote>
<div>But did not reach the top after all,<br>
</div>
<div>Because I had not the right sort of mind.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Collected Poems</span>, 343)</blockquote>By 1962 he had risen to become under-secretary at the Ministry of Labour. (No English poet has had greater experience of public affairs and the practical business of government.) But, though ambitious and &#145;altogether a rather good performer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Contemporary Authors</span>, 303), he was not naturally one of the pleasers. His career closed bitterly. Having been promised and then denied a post he coveted, he was promoted out of harm's way, and &#145;set the seal&#146; on his disgrace when he published in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> three &#145;knowledgeable&#146; articles about the management of the civil service, &#145;then reaching a high pitch of folly&#146;  (<span class="italic">On the Lookout</span>, 225). He engineered his early retirement in 1973 by using an administrative reform with which he was charged to abolish his own job. He moved from near Sevenoaks to Langport in Somerset, to a house looking out from a bluff over the River Parrett and low fields to the Dorset hills. This was the country he cared for most. &#145;You could look out on worse than that&#146;, he would say with ironic feeling  (personal knowledge).<br>
<br>Sisson's life in the civil service had been in acute tension with his life as a writer. The drive toward expression was unrelenting. Between 1937 and its close in 1949 he was a regular contributor to the <span class="italic">New English Weekly</span>. In 1959 he published <span class="italic">The Spirit of British Administration</span>, a classic study comparing British, French, and German traditions of public administration. A second novel, <span class="italic">Christopher Homm</span>, the portrait of a modern Everyman in limbo, appeared in 1965. Other notable productions were <span class="italic">The Case of Walter Bagehot</span> (1972), an assault on nineteenth-century liberalism and its heirs, a small masterpiece of incisive polemic; and <span class="italic">English Poetry 1900&#150;1950</span> (1971), an engagingly personal account from a modernist perspective. Sisson also published three volumes of poetry. But it was not until after his retirement that he came to prominence as a poet, with the appearance of <span class="italic">In the Trojan Ditch</span> (1974). This volume marked the beginning of an association with the Carcanet Press and its founder, Michael Schmidt, whose support encouraged Sisson in the extraordinary productivity of his later years.<br>
<br>All but a very few pages of Sisson's <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> (1998) were written after the age of forty. They were &#145;poems of the return journey&#146;. But after hesitant beginnings the story was one of increasing fluency and range. Poetry for Sisson meant a &#145;rejection of whatever appears with the face of familiarity&#146;  (<span class="italic">In Two Minds</span>, 286). Rather than being a construction, it is a kind of unbuilding. The attempt to establish, in however limited a way, the real, or in Sisson's preferred word, the &#145;solid&#146;, also means the dismantling of illusion and pretence. This insistence could give an aggressive or satirical edge to his writing. There was always a fierce undertow of feeling. The <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> was a daunting book in which the best poems were widely scattered. Any list of these would include &#145;A Letter to John Donne&#146;, &#145;The Usk&#146;, &#145;The Red Admiral&#146;, &#145;In Flood&#146;, the last section of &#145;Burrington Combe&#146;, and &#145;Taxila&#146;. &#145;Poetry&#146;, Sisson said, &#145;is the nearest thing to human speech we have&#146;  (Clive Wilmer, <span class="italic">Poets Talking</span>, 1994, 14).<br>
<br>Sisson was a prolific translator of poetry. Translation was for him a way of reading works not by contemporaries, to which he wanted to come close. It also enabled him &#145;to release the energies of poetry without passing for having said anything of his own&#146;  (<span class="italic">In Two Minds</span>, 286). Besides lesser undertakings, he produced vigorous versions of Catullus (1966), Lucretius (1976), Dante's <span class="italic">Divine Comedy</span> (1980), and Virgil's <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> (1986), the Dante being arguably, the Virgil certainly, the best twentieth-century versions of these works in English verse. These translations bore out Sisson's rule that the formal properties of verse in one language cannot be rendered directly in another; the matter of the original is faithfully given. Sisson was also continuously active as a reviewer, essayist, and editor. A bulky volume of collected essays, <span class="italic">The Avoidance of Literature</span>, appeared in 1978. (What he meant by the paradoxical title is that it is fatal to the truth to write derivatively.) Several further collections followed.<br>
<br>Sisson's religious and political beliefs, as his essays show them, emerged, as if by subterranean tunnel, out of the seventeenth century. He was a tory by Dr Johnson's definition, a persuasion fundamentally at odds with modern Conservatism. He detested banking interests and a managerial class adept in manoeuvre but irresponsibly divorced from the body politic. His admiration went instead to those who &#145;without relaxing their hold on the business of the day, are able to see it as a manifestation of more permanent interests&#146;  (<span class="italic">Case of Walter Bagehot</span>, 1972, 43). An embodiment of these permanent interests for him was the Church of England, which he joined at the age of thirty-nine, having been brought up a Methodist. The virtual abandonment by the clergy of the <span class="roman">Authorized Version of the Bible</span>, and then the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, aroused his contemptuous fury and drew him into public controversy. &#145;What is at stake&#146;, he wrote, &#145;is not some literary frivolity about the &#147;old&#148; and the &#147;new&#148;, but the profoundly important distinction between the more and the less meaningful&#146;  (<span class="italic">Is there a Church of England?</span>, 7). The betrayal, as he considered it, of the church was one aspect of a vaster sense of loss by which his later poetry was haunted. We exist, Sisson believed, (if at all) not as individuals but in relation to each other, as part of a congregation, a &#145;historical community&#146;  (Scruton), the relation being proved by language, our ability to speak to and understand each other. Loyalty was a central value for him. But loyalty meant being prepared to speak out, to rock the boat&#151;and this, when he felt it to be necessary, he would do with panache.<br>
<br>To someone meeting Sisson for the first time and expecting to discover a Timon in his cave, it could come as a surprise to find &#145;a modest and extremely humane man&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). His gruffness was of a courteous kind, in part the effect of diffidence, and was shot through with humour. He was mischievously observant of the human comedy, yet accepting of shortcomings. While there was nothing of the bohemian about him, he remained sceptical of the &#145;bourgeois virtues&#146; that he practised  (<span class="italic">Contemporary Authors</span>, 303). Any theoretical scheme for, or pretension to, the self-sufficient perfectibility of man or society raised his hackles. In an unshowy way he tried to live a Christian life, as he found it represented in such manuals as Jeremy Taylor's <span class="italic">Holy Living and Holy Dying</span>. Sisson had to keep his mind occupied with tasks to prevent it from preying on itself. He worked hard and regularly and always, it seemed, with result&#151;his first thoughts being usually his best; yet he appeared to spend as much time in his garden or in the countryside around Langport as at his desk. A gardener, he was proud of his fruit trees, his herbs, and the homegrown vegetables on his table. (He refused to have in his garden any plants which had been introduced into England after the seventeenth century.) Over the years he collected a fine library. He also possessed a small collection of modern art, strikingly akin in sensibility to his poems. He was a man of robust appearance, whose way of walking, head forward, one leg very slightly dragging, indicated both the determination and the acknowledgement of imperfection with which he approached life. These also appeared in the contrast, at poetry readings, between his throwaway, rather mumbled manner of introducing a poem, and his vehemence when it came to reading the poem itself. In 1993 he was made a Companion of Honour for &#145;services to literature&#146;.<br>
<br>The final poem in Sisson's definitive <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> (1998) was a deliberate signing-off. In 1997 he suffered the first of several strokes, and his last years&#151;as he was not shy of saying&#151;were spent looking forward to death. Of his poetry he said (but as if the remark had a wider application), &#145;All that is past. There's nothing now&#146;  (personal knowledge). He died at his home, Moorfield Cottage, The Hill, Langport, on 5 September 2003, following another stroke. He was survived by his two daughters, his wife having predeceased him by seven months. He was buried beside her in the graveyard of St Mary, Huish Episcopi, the parish adjoining his, after a funeral service conducted according to the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>.<br>
