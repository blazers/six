<span class="headword">Hughes,  David John</span>  (1930&#150;2005), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 27 July 1930 at 6 Park Close Road, Alton, Hampshire, the only child of Gwilym Fielden Hughes (1899&#150;1989), schoolmaster, writer, and broadcaster, and his wife, Edna Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cochrane (1903&#150;1996). His father was the Yorkshire-born son of a Congregational minister from Caernarvonshire, and his mother was born in Lancashire. He was observant of his roots, perhaps the more so as his childhood was disrupted by the Second World War. In 1937 his father had moved from the headmastership of Alton senior boys' school to that of Queen's Road senior boys' school, Wimbledon, but two years later the family was evacuated to Chichester, and then back to Alton. They did not return to London until the war was over.<br>
<br>Hughes was educated at Eggar's Grammar School, Alton, and then at King's College School, Wimbledon. As an Alton choirboy he reported sermons for the <span class="italic">Hampshire Herald</span>; at the age of seventeen he offered poems to John Lehmann's <span class="italic">Penguin New Writing</span>. During national service at RAF Warrington (1948&#150;50) he read J. B. Priestley under his desk. At Oxford, where he read English at Christ Church and edited <span class="italic">Isis</span>, he kept in touch with Lehmann, giving him the idea for a BBC programme, <span class="italic">New Soundings</span>, and in 1953, when Lehmann was setting up his new title, the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, he took on Hughes (who had graduated with a second-class degree earlier that year) as his assistant editor. Lehmann, an autocrat, liked Hughes, whom he described as &#145;sweet-tempered and able&#146;, though he noticed &#145;grim psychological struggles in his relations with his family&#146;  (Wright, 212). Nevertheless Hughes left in 1955 to work for another autocrat, Rupert Hart-Davis, in publishing. (The <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> soon followed to the same address; Alan Ross, who succeeded Lehmann as editor from 1961, became one of Hughes's closest friends.) Hart-Davis, recognizing Hughes's ambition, gave him a paid half-day off a week to write and in 1957 his first novel was published, <span class="italic">A Feeling in the Air</span>.<br>
<br>It was as &#145;a young poet&#146;  (Zetterling, 152) that, the same year, he was introduced by Patrick Woodcock to the Swedish film star Mai Elisabet Zetterling (1925&#150;1994), newly parted from Tyrone Power. Woodcock mischievously introduced Mai Zetterling as &#145;a middle-aged Latvian refugee who speaks only German&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 19 June 2002). Hughes was tall and dark, Zetterling was tiny, elfin, blonde. They married in Oxford on 23 April 1958, in which year Hart-Davis published Hughes's second book, <span class="italic">J. B. Priestley: an Informal Study of his Work</span>.<br>
<br>Hughes's second novel, <span class="italic">Sealed with a Loving Kiss</span>, followed in 1959, but for the next sixteen years his career&#151;apart from a stint as editor of Michael Heseltine and Clive Labovitch's magazine <span class="italic">Town</span>, 1960&#150;61&#151;was largely allied to Zetterling's. Hughes left his damp basement in Bayswater, Zetterling her smart flat in Kensington, and they bought and restored a tumble-down old rectory, Berry Grove, at Liss in Hampshire. Zetterling, determined to be more than a decorative studio actress, gave herself five years to get established as an independent film-maker. Hughes collaborated with her, whether as co-writer, sound man, or stills photographer, on the short <span class="italic">The War Game</span> (1962; nominated for a BAFTA award), <span class="italic">Loving Couples</span> (1964; nominated for the palme d'or at Cannes), the controversial <span class="italic">Night Games</span> (1966; nominated for the leone d'oro at Venice, but banned from public performance there), <span class="italic">Dr Glas</span> (1968; based on the novel by Hjalmar S&ouml;derberg), <span class="italic">The Girls</span> (1968; based on Aristophanes' <span class="italic">Lysistrata</span>), and <span class="italic">Vincent the Dutchman</span> (1972; a BAFTA award-winning drama-documentary about Van Gogh).<br>
<br>In 1964, the year he published <span class="italic">The Road to Stockholm and Lapland</span>, a relaxed account of a drive through northern Europe in Zetterling's Sunbeam Rapier convertible (most of her films were shot in Sweden), Hughes made his mark with a fourth novel, <span class="italic">The Major</span>. Brief, spare, impressively violent, it told the story of the mundane Major Kane's vicious campaign to reclaim his family house from an aged tenant. In 1968 came <span class="italic">The Man Who Invented Tomorrow</span>, a tease of H. G. Wells. But exile did not suit Hughes. Unhappy in the remote house near Uz&egrave;s, in Languedoc, that Zetterling had fallen in love with four years before, deracinated and unable to write, he returned in 1974 to London. They divorced in 1976.<br>
<br>Hughes lived in Pimlico, then for a period in New York, teaching, before marrying, at Lambeth register office on 1 November 1980, Elizabeth Jane Booth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Westoll (<i>b</i>. 1947), daughter of James (Tim) Westoll, landowner and ornithologist. He and Elizabeth settled down in contentment to live in London, finally at 163 Kennington Road, with a second home at a farmhouse in the hills above Llandovery in Carmarthenshire, and then in Aldington, Kent; they had a son, Merlin, and a daughter, Anna Rose. After the subtle, well-crafted novels <span class="italic">Memories of Dying</span> (1976), <span class="italic">A Genoese Fancy</span> (1979), and <span class="italic">The Imperial German Dinner Service</span> (1983), Hughes scored his most notable success with <span class="italic">The Pork Butcher</span> (1984). A haunting tale of a German ex-soldier returning to France to the site of a Second World War massacre in which he had participated, it displayed all Hughes's finest characteristics as a writer: wit, economy, sensuality, and a brutal power of surprise. The book won the W. H. Smith literary award and was turned in 1989 into a film, <span class="italic">Souvenir</span>, that Hughes deplored. His last work of conventional fiction was the light-hearted <span class="italic">But for Bunter</span> (1985), published in America as <span class="italic">The Joke of the Century</span> (1986), in which twentieth-century history was taken over by the Fat Owl of Frank Richards's remove.<br>
<br>J. B. Priestley liberated Hughes, he said, by his &#145;insistence on being his own man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Himself and Other Animals</span>, 6); by unbending frankness, Priestley achieves a direct relationship with his reader. In <span class="italic">J. B. Priestley</span> (defined, tellingly, as &#145;a chapter of autobiography&#146;; p. 220) the 28-year-old Hughes asserted the duty of an author as &#145;clearly and honestly and in the round&#146; to expose his personality: &#145;I have often felt that the difficulty of conveying oneself on paper, pleasantly and without falsehood, is something a writer must conquer before his images of other people can satisfactorily pass that way&#146;  (p. 48). One of his earlier books, the decidedly experimental <span class="italic">The Rosewater Revolution</span> (1971), exploring the margins of fiction and non-fiction, was initially subtitled &#145;aspects of myself&#146;. &#145;Conveying oneself&#146;, conveying David Hughes in the full round, became the purpose of his later books, often to the discomfiture of reviewers.<br>
<br>All the characters in <span class="italic">The Little Book</span> (1996; half fiction, half not, and written almost as a love letter to his wife, Elizabeth) were &#145;aspects of myself&#146;, from Dave Higgs, Davis Fielden, and Hugh Dickinson to D. J. House and Davina Darley. After a brush with cancer he imagined a &#145;book to end books&#146;, &#145;the unwritable bible&#146;, &#145;the little book that said it all&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Little Book</span>, 8, 10). <span class="italic">Himself and Other Animals</span> (1997), a revision of the life of his friend (and sometime Hart-Davis author) Gerald Durrell that he had undertaken on his return to England in 1974, was as much about the author as his subject, the zookeeper in his several habitats, lunching in Jersey, drinking in the Midi. <span class="italic">The Lent Jewels</span> (2002), an explicitly personal, slyly inconclusive investigation of religious faith, purported to be about the death from scarlet fever of five out of the six daughters of Archibald Campbell Tait (a future archbishop of Canterbury) in one month in 1856. Hughes's last book, <span class="italic">The Hack's Tale</span> (2004), a journey by autoroute, autostrada, and pilgrims' way into the worlds of Froissart, Boccaccio, and Chaucer, was a cry of frustration at the twenty-first-century media.<br>
<br>Benign, solicitous, clubbable, with an air of the bohemian schoolmaster, Hughes seemed never happier than at the lunch table, glass in hand, full board before him, and a long afternoon ahead. Mai Zetterling called him &#145;a sensualist <i>par excellence</i>&#146;  (Zetterling, 160). But he was a writer of the utmost seriousness, a painful perfectionist and a scrupulous critic. A man of appetites, he concealed his difficulties with art. Handsome, romantic, &#145;positively Byronic&#146;, for Zetterling he was &#145;a secretive person, even to himself&#146;  (ibid., 154, 157).<br>
<br>Elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1986, Hughes served on its council from 1989 to 1996, edited its journal from 1992 to 1996, and in 1998 became a vice-president. He was editor of the New Fiction Society, 1975&#150;8 and 1981&#150;2, film critic of the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, 1982&#150;3, and fiction critic of the <span class="italic">Mail on Sunday</span>, 1982&#150;99. From 1986 to 1995, with Giles Gordon, he edited an annual, <span class="italic">Best Short Stories</span>, for Heinemann. A brilliant technician who strove for &#145;good words exactly positioned&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Little Book</span>, 36), he was as diligent in encouraging younger writers as he was in keeping old friendships in spruce repair. He died on 11 April 2005 at St Thomas's Hospital, Lambeth, London, of sepsis and infective arthropathy (in his bad ankle) accompanied by liver and kidney failure. He was survived by his wife and their two children, and buried on 19 April in Bonnington, Kent, by the church of St Rumwold of which he had written vividly in <span class="italic">The Hack's Tale</span>  (p. 63)&#151;dedicated to &#145;a saint so holy he only lived a day&#146;.<br>
