<span class="headword">Birch,  Samuel</span>  (1813&#150;1885), <span class="occ">Egyptologist</span>, was born on 2 or 3 November 1813 in London, eldest son of the Revd Samuel Birch (1780?&#150;1848), rector of St Mary Woolnoth, later a prebendary of St Paul's Cathedral and vicar of Little Marlow, Buckinghamshire, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of William Browning, of Woburn Place, London. His grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2434/', "Samuel Birch (1757&#150;1841)")</script>, was a dramatist and pastry-cook, and had been lord mayor of London in 1814&#150;15. His father had a distinguished academic record, having been for many years professor of geometry at Gresham College, London. Surprisingly, therefore, young Samuel, after an early education at preparatory schools in Greenwich and Blackheath, followed by five years at Merchant Taylors' School (1826&#150;31), did not proceed to university.<br>
<br>At school Birch began his studies of Chinese, and the promise of a position in China may have led him to forgo university. He did not, however, go to China, but briefly held an appointment in the Public Record Office before becoming an assistant in the department of antiquities in the British Museum in January 1836. His initial task, to catalogue the Chinese coins in the museum, led his grandfather to comment: &#145;Good God, Sammy! has the family come to that?&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). On 22 July 1839 he married Charlotte Francis, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11353/', "Samuel Frederick Gray")</script>, a botanist and pharmacologist.<br>
<br>Chinese studies remained important throughout Birch's life, but Egyptology captured his main attention. He is best remembered as one of the first British Egyptologists. He began his Egyptological studies before he entered the British Museum, when Egyptology was in its infancy. Of British scholars, only John Gardner Wilkinson had as yet shown a proper comprehension of the ancient Egyptian language. His great work, <span class="italic">The Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians</span>, was published the year after Birch entered the museum, and it was appropriate that Birch should produce a revised edition in 1878, adding much new material.<br>
<br>When Birch joined the department of antiquities it covered the whole of the ancient world, coins, the Orient, and medieval material. Birch ranged widely in all fields, as required, and his early non-Egyptological publications included: <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Greek and Etruscan Vases</span> (1851), with C. T. Newton; <span class="italic">History of Ancient Pottery and Porcelain</span> (1858); <span class="italic">Inscriptions in the Cuneiform Character</span> (1851), revised by S. Birch and Sir H. C. Rawlinson; and <span class="italic">Inscriptions in the Himyaritic Character</span> (1863). A large number of shorter articles on coins and classical and British antiquities appeared in the appropriate learned journals.<br>
<br>Edward Hawkins, the benign keeper of antiquities, generously nurtured young talent, and he especially encouraged Birch's numismatic interests. In Egyptological matters Hawkins's support was crucial. From the outset of his museum career Birch's interest lay primarily in the Egyptian language, in the translation of and commentary on texts, and especially in the reading of Egyptian texts on papyri, many of which were written in the little-understood hieratic and demotic scripts. When Birch entered the museum the holdings of papyri were preserved in the department of manuscripts. Birch sought them out and in 1838 initiated their publication. Between 1841 and 1844 three large fascicles of <span class="italic">Select Papyri in the Hieratic Character</span> appeared, with introductory remarks by Birch. This pioneering work was the first of many issued under Birch's editorship. Meanwhile, undoubtedly at his instigation, all the ancient Egyptian papyri were transferred to the department of antiquities, where they could more easily be studied by Birch, who alone had the competence to do so. He did not neglect the main collections of Egyptian antiquities in the museum, and in 1842&#150;3 he co-operated with Joseph Bonomi and Francis Arundale in producing <span class="italic">The Gallery of Antiquities Selected from the British Museum</span>.<br>
<br>In 1844 Birch became an assistant keeper in the department of antiquities. When Hawkins retired in 1860 the department was subdivided, and in 1861 Birch became keeper of oriental, British, and medieval antiquities. In 1866, after further departmental division, he became keeper of oriental antiquities, and from then until his death he was able to concentrate his scholarly efforts on Egyptian antiquities. He continued the publication of important texts in <span class="italic">Inscriptions in the Hieratic and Demotic Character</span> (1868) and <span class="italic">Facsimile of an Egyptian Hieratic Papyrus of the Reign of Ramesses III</span> (1876), the latter concerning the longest known ancient papyrus. He contributed translations of many important historical texts to the series <span class="italic">Records of the Past</span> (1874&#150;81). In 1883 he produced an influential commentary on the important Northumberland collection, <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Collections of Egyptian Antiquities at Alnwick Castle</span>. His articles in learned journals continued unabated, and he made important contributions to many works of others, not least the English translation of C. C. J. Bunsen's <span class="italic">Egypt's Place in Universal History</span>. He revised the 1867 edition, including in the last volume his own translation of the &#145;Book of the dead&#146;, an Egyptian grammar, and an Egyptian dictionary. In these he provided the first useful working tools for English-speaking students of ancient Egypt.<br>
<br>The founding in 1870 of the Society of Biblical Archaeology was largely Birch's achievement, and for the rest of his life he supported it by public lectures and by contributing regularly to its <span class="italic">Transactions</span> and <span class="italic">Proceedings</span>. He did not welcome the establishment of the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1882, objecting to what he called sentimental archaeology directed at a gullible public. Undoubtedly he feared the competition to his society offered by a popularly based organization mounting glamorous excavations in Egypt. His fears, if they were such, were in the end justified, and his society was wound up after the First World War. The Egypt Exploration Society (as the fund had become) continued to flourish throughout the twentieth century.<br>
<br>All sources agree that Birch, in addition to being a scholar of the first importance, was a public servant devoted to his duties, and a man of extraordinary kindliness and generosity. He was free from malice and worldly ambition. He was a desk scholar who was content to work on the material in the museum, or sent to him for study. He never went to Egypt. Sir Ernest Budge, himself a young recruit into Birch's department, wrote with great affection in <span class="italic">By Nile and Tigris</span> (1920):<blockquote>His greyish-green eyes were deep-set, and nothing escaped them, and when he was moved to mirth they laughed before the muscles of his mouth relaxed. &hellip; His gait was that of a man whose thoughts travel faster than his feet, and the length and quickness of his strides indicated with more than ordinary clearness the working of his mind at the moment. (1.20)</blockquote>The epigraph on Birch's gravestone in Highgate cemetery encapsulates his modesty and fame: &#145;Samuel Birch D.C.L., LL.D, F.S.A., Etc., Etc., The Egyptologist&#146;. He was much honoured for his services to scholarship. He was a corresponding member of the Archaeological Institute of Rome (1839), the Berlin Academy (1851), the Academy of Herculaneum (1852), and the Acad&eacute;mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres (1861). He was an honorary LLD of the universities of Aberdeen (1862) and Cambridge (1875), DCL of Oxford University (1876), and honorary fellow of the Queen's College, Oxford (1877). Among numerous foreign awards, he received from the emperor of Germany the cross second class of the order of the Crown (1874), and from the emperor of Brazil the order of the Knight of the Rose (1875).<br>
<br>Samuel Birch died at his home, 64 Caversham Road, Camden Town, London, on 27 December 1885, and was buried at Highgate new (east) cemetery. He was survived by his second wife, Sarah (1839&#150;1908), several daughters, and three sons, one of whom, Walter de Gray Birch, was an assistant in the department of manuscripts at the British Museum. His first wife, Charlotte, predeceased him by many years.<br>
