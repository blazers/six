<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Willes, Sir  James Shaw</span>  (1814&#150;1872), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in Cork on 13 February 1814, the son of James Willes (1775&#150;1852), physician, and Elizabeth, daughter of John Shaw, mayor of Cork in 1792. He came from a protestant family settled in Cork and may have been descended from Edward Willes (1704&#150;1768), who became chief baron of Ireland, and related to the English family of Willes of Newbold Comyn, which produced the lecherous chief justice Sir John Willes (1685&#150;1761). James was the eldest of six children, three boys and three girls. He was educated at Dr Porter's school in Cork, and at Trinity College, Dublin, where he matriculated in 1831 and graduated BA in 1836 after taking the general degree examination. There was at the time virtually no law teaching at Trinity. Later, in 1860, Trinity conferred on him the degree of LLD. After initially intending to practise at the Irish bar, according to one account, and spending some time as a pupil of Stephen Collins QC in Dublin, he moved to London in 1837, joined the Inner Temple, and became a pupil and thereafter a salaried assistant to the special pleader <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5338/', "Thomas Chitty (1802&#150;1878)")</script>. The Willes and Chitty families were otherwise connected, and James's younger sister Mary (Minnie) later married Thomas Chitty's son, Thomas Edward.<br>
<br>Willes was called to the bar on 12 June 1840 and joined the home circuit, though his practice was principally in London in mercantile and shipping cases. He lived in chambers in the Temple. He became a close friend of John William Smith, who established a reputation for learning through his <span class="italic">Compendium of Mercantile Law</span> (1834) and innovatory <span class="italic">Leading Cases in Various Branches of the Law</span> (1837 and 1840). After Smith's death Willes, together with Henry Singer Keating, edited the fourth and fifth editions of this very successful work. It was a task for which Willes was well suited, for he possessed an extraordinary knowledge of case law, and was reputed to have read the entire corpus of published reports, including the medieval yearbooks. Willes became tubman of the court of exchequer in 1851; this was an honorary position in the gift of the lord chief baron, ranking below that of postman. He never took silk. He developed a high-class practice, principally in commercial cases. In recognition of his abilities he was appointed in 1850 to the second common law commission which was to inquire into common-law procedure and recommend reforms; the commission produced three reports, and Willes played a considerable part in the legislation which followed, especially the <span class="roman">Common Law Procedure Act</span> of 1854. He also served on the Indian law commission (1861), the English and Irish law commission (1862), the digest of law commission (from 1870), and the judicature commission (from 1869). Unlike many judges of the period he never became a member of parliament nor had any political affiliations.<br>
<br>In July 1855 Willes succeeded Sir William Maule as a judge of the court of common pleas on the nomination of Lord Cranworth. He was knighted at Osborne in August. In 1871 he was invited to become one of the four new salaried members of the judicial committee of the privy council, but declined; he was, however, sworn of the privy council in November 1871 for reasons which remain a little obscure. He was one of the first judges appointed to try election petitions, and in this capacity established the principles applicable to this new judicial task.<br>
<br>Willes continued as a judge of the common pleas until his death. Strongly patriotic, he also served as a private soldier in the Inns of Court Volunteers from 1859 until shortly before his death.<br>
<br>On 17 May 1856 Willes married Helen Jennings, daughter of Thomas Jennings of Cork, a mineral water manufacturer; there is some reason to believe that Willes married under threat of a breach of promise action arising out of a youthful romance in Dublin. The marriage, which produced no children, does not appear to have been a happy one. At about this time he moved to a house at 16 Eaton Square. From 1865 Willes's home became Otterspool, a house on the River Colne near Aldenham outside Watford in Hertfordshire, where he appears to have lived apart from Lady Willes. In London he lived in the Judges' Chambers, Rolls Garden, Chancery Lane. His recreations at Otterspool were walking his three dogs, boating, and feeding the trout; in youth a keen fisherman, he came to forbid fishing in his water.<br>
<br>Willes was a man of wide general culture, with a mastery of all the major European languages and some knowledge of oriental languages as well. He was an enthusiastic traveller in Europe, America, and the East (it is not clear which countries he visited). In common with virtually all the major figures of the classical age of the common law he received no formal legal education. His reputation for legal learning was unrivalled and fully deserved; he wholly lacked pedantry, and as an active law reformer of liberal sympathies he had no respect for valueless legal technicality. He was familiar with European legal culture as well as with the common law. He served as a judge at a period when legislative reform was cleansing the legal system of archaisms; substantive law, developed by the common-law judges sitting collegially, was replacing jury discretion, and the judicial conventions of the period encouraged a judicial style which presented legal decisions as legitimated more by their rationality than by their conformity to precedent. Though Willes nowhere explicitly set out his own judicial philosophy, he belonged to the school of legal science. He conceived of the common law as a body of general principles, and the displays of erudition and elaborate analysis of case law which are to be found in some of his opinions were used by him as a means towards the end of isolating a rationally defensible legal principle. Notable examples of his style are to be found in <i>Indermaur v. Dames</i> (1866), dealing with the liability of an occupier of property to entrants who suffer injuries, <i>Phillips v. Eyre</i> (1870), dealing with the jurisdiction of English courts over acts committed abroad arising out of the suppression of a supposed rising in Jamaica by Governor Eyre, and <i>Beamish v. Beamish</i> (1861), dealing with the ecclesiastical law of marriage. In <i>Marks v. Feldman</i> (1870) he gave one of the briefest opinions in the reports: <span class="italic">Dolus circuitu non purgatur</span>. Willes's effectiveness as a judge was enhanced by the simplicity and lucidity of his style. Professional opinion placed him in the first rank of common-law judges of his period. With the lapse of time, however, few of his opinions are now read.<br>
<br>Willes was a tall man with a prominent nose and eyes; no portrait is known to exist, but a photograph does. There is a print in the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> in 1872. He never lost his Irish accent. His manner was reserved and courteous, but was said by Serjeant Ballantyne to have lacked cordiality. He had a slightly eccentric streak, illustrated by his behaviour when taking the judicial oaths. He declined to abjure King James and his descendants audibly, insisting that he was &#145;abjuring them in his mind&#146;. He was an emotional man, somewhat given to tears, with a reputation in criminal cases of being merciful. After the death of his brother William Henry Willes (1822&#150;1863), a county court judge, he suffered poor health, in particular heart disease and, in later years, severe attacks of gout. His poor health has been attributed to overwork; there is no doubt that he was indeed a compulsive worker. In the long vacation of 1872, after the conclusion of the assizes at Liverpool, he became noticeably depressed, sleepless, and forgetful, and on 2 October shot himself fatally in the chest with a revolver at his home, Otterspool. He was survived by Lady Willes, who died in 1887. He was buried in Brompton cemetery on 7 October.<br>
