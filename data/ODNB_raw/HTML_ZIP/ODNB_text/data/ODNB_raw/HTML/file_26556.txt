<span class="headword">Stokes,  Henry Sewell</span>  (1808&#150;1895), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at Gibraltar on 16 June 1808, the eldest son of Henry Stokes (<i>d</i>. 1832), proctor and notary at Gibraltar, who was a native of Dartmouth, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sewell (1787&#150;1857). Henry Sewell went to England in 1815 and was sent in 1817 to St Saviour's Grammar School at Southwark, and later to William Giles's school at Chatham, where Charles Dickens was his companion. In 1825 he returned to Gibraltar and was taught by French, Spanish, and Italian teachers while studying mercantile law at his father's office. His first poem, <span class="italic">The Lay of the Desert</span>, designed and in part written on Dartmoor, was published in 1830. <span class="italic">The Song of Albion: a Poem on the Reform Crisis</span> and <span class="italic">Discourses on Opinion</span> followed in 1831. He was then articled to Mr Bridgman, a solicitor at Tavistock, and was admitted attorney in January 1832 and solicitor in February. For a short time he was a student of the Middle Temple.<br>
<br>Stokes lived for some weeks at St Austell, Cornwall, acquiring evidence on mining customs in the duchy, and in 1834 settled at Truro, where he practised as a solicitor for many years and played an active role as a Liberal in local politics. He founded the <span class="italic">Cornish Guardian and Western Chronicle</span> newspaper (later merged with the <span class="italic">West Briton</span>) in July 1833 and was its editor for three years. Charles Buller and Sir William Molesworth were occasional leader writers. Stokes also wrote leaders for the <span class="italic">Devon Independent</span>, which had a large circulation in Cornwall, and was an occasional contributor to the <span class="italic">West Briton</span>.<br>
<br>On 9 August 1834 Stokes married Louisa Rachel Evans (<i>d</i>. 1890), daughter of the Revd William Evans of Parkwood, Tavistock. They had one son, William Evans Stokes, and three daughters.<br>
<br>From the number of poems he wrote about the county, Stokes was sometimes called &#145;the laureate for Cornwall&#146;. <span class="italic">The Vale of Lanherne</span> (1836) included a sketch of Lanherne nunnery and the church of St Mawgan by his wife. Tennyson spent a week with him at Truro in 1848. In addition to the numerous flysheets and small poems that he published, Stokes contributed an article on the court of the vice-warden of the stannaries to the <span class="italic">Mining Almanac</span> (1849) of Henry English. <span class="italic">The Vale of Lanherne</span> was reissued in 1853 with illustrations by Charles Haghe from designs by James G. Philp and Stokes received letters of appreciation from W. S. Landor, Matthew Arnold, and Edward Bulwer Lytton. <span class="italic">Echoes of the War</span> was published in 1855. A critic in the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span> described the volume in July 1855 as &#145;the sincere response of a warm British heart to the tales of noble deeds, and nobly endured suffering, which have come to us from the Crimea&#146;. Stokes's poem &#145;Inkerman&#146; was especially singled out for praise as &#145;an easy, spirited ballad of the kind we wish our war-poets had hit on more frequently, instead of the high-flown metaphysical strain&#146;  (Wright, 428).<br>
<br>In 1856 Stokes was elected mayor of Truro and in 1859 was appointed town clerk. On the nomination of Lord Vivian, lord lieutenant of the county, he became clerk of the peace for Cornwall in February 1865. The duties of this post forced him to move to Bodmin, where he spent the rest of his days, all the while continuing to write and publish his poetry. The 1870s were particularly prolific years, seeing the publication of <span class="italic">Rhymes of Cornwall</span> (1871; reissued 1884 as <span class="italic">The Voyage of Arundel and other Rhymes from Cornwall</span>), <span class="italic">Memories</span> (1872; new edition 1879), <span class="italic">Poems of Later Years</span> (1873; reissued in 1881 as <span class="italic">The Chantry Owl and other Verses</span>), <span class="italic">Restormel: a Legend of Piers Gaveston</span> (1875; republished 1882), and <span class="italic">The Gate of Heaven: the Plaint of Morwenstow</span> (1876). On 17 August 1876 Stokes delivered a paper on books and manuscripts relating to Cornwall at a meeting of the British Archaeological Association at Bodmin, which was later printed in its journal. He was elected the first president of the Cornwall Law Society at its inaugural meeting in St Austell on 13 August 1883. In December 1891, at a public meeting held at Truro, Stokes was presented with an oil portrait of himself and a cheque for &pound;500 &#145;as a token of the high esteem in which he was held by all classes throughout Cornwall&#146;  (Wright, 429). He was granted the freedom of the city of Truro in 1894. Stokes died at Castle Street, Bodmin, on 7 April 1895 and was buried in Bodmin cemetery on 13 April.<br>
