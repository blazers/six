<span class="headword">Corbet,  Henry</span>  (1820&#150;1878), <span class="occ">agricultural editor</span>, was born on 31 December 1820 and educated at Bedford School. He hoped to go to university but was unable to do so because of family difficulties. During the early 1840s he lived in London and first came to public attention in November 1846 when he was appointed secretary of the London (or Central, as it was then styled) Farmers' Club in succession to Thomas Thorp. The issue of tenant right was one of the great concerns of the club during its early years. In 1848 Corbet collaborated with William Shaw, the editor of the <span class="italic">Mark Lane Express and Agricultural Journal</span> and founder of the Farmers' Club, to produce a digest of the agricultural customs of England and Wales that had been reported to Phillip Pusey's select committee on tenant right, the proceedings of which were never formally published. Corbet was also awarded a prize by the Wenlock Farmers' Club for an essay on tenant right which came to be regarded as a definitive statement on the subject.<br>
<br>Shaw left abruptly for Australia in 1852 and Corbet was invited to write for the <span class="italic">Mark Lane Express</span>; he soon took over as editor. He established a reputation for a combative, forthright style of writing, and while tenant right remained one of his most abiding concerns he also campaigned on a range of issues such as the abolition of the malt tax, the reform of the game laws, county expenditure and county rates, the need for effective government action to counter the spread of animal disease, and the sale of sub-standard and adulterated animal feedstuffs. Apart from leading articles in the <span class="italic">Mark Lane Express</span>, the six papers that he gave to the London Farmers' Club between 1860 and 1870 offer insights into Corbet's style and opinions.<br>
<br>Although Corbet took a close interest in all aspects of agricultural progress he was more sceptical about the potential of agricultural science than many of his contemporaries. His particular expertise was in the appraisal of farm livestock, and he was much in demand as a stock judge at agricultural shows. The depth of his knowledge of stock was evident in his report on the livestock exhibited at the Royal Agricultural Society of England's 1872 Cardiff show and in his essay, &#145;Heads&#146;, for the Bath and West Society. Corbet was also an enthusiastic sportsman and edited the <span class="italic">Steeplechase Calendar</span> between 1845 and 1848. Later he wrote extensively for <span class="italic">The Field</span>, <span class="italic">Bell's Life</span>, and <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span>; a selection of these writings was published as <span class="italic">Tales and Traits of Sporting Life</span> (1864).<br>
<br>Despite Corbet's criticisms of the lack of a unified system of tenant right and the operation of the game laws, he was essentially conservative in many of his views about the countryside. He spoke out against trends in country sport of which he disapproved, such as the fashion for large-scale pheasant shooting or the overexploitation of two-year-old horses on the turf, and he saw fox-hunting as a cohesive social force. As he concluded in his address, &#145;Foxes <i>versus</i> rabbits&#146;, to the London Farmers' Club (May 1869):<blockquote>let us try our best to keep one old English pastime amongst us pure and undefiled. We have scared the wolf from our woods and forests, we have banished the bustard from our plains, and the very grouse fly before the shepherd and his flock; but it will be a bad day for this country when a fox can no longer be routed from his lair to &#145;Die in the open as a good'un should do!&#146; (<span class="italic">Farmer's Magazine</span>, 3rd ser., 35, June 1869, 515&#150;16)</blockquote>Corbet was active in a number of agricultural institutions. He was secretary of the Total Repeal Malt-Tax Association, helped to reform the constitution of the Smithfield Club in the early 1860s, and was for many years auditor to the Royal Agricultural Society of England. In 1871 he, with his brother Edward, established the Alexandra Park Horse Show. He was made a member of the council of the Royal Agricultural Benevolent Institution and of the committee of Lord Vernon's French Farmers' Relief Fund, and in 1876 was elected a member of the Agricultural Society of France in recognition of services to agriculture. In December 1875 he suffered a severe stroke, which left him paralysed and unable to continue his work.<br>
<br>Corbet was best-known for his editorship of the <span class="italic">Mark Lane Express</span>, which achieved under him &#145;an individuality and a reputation for thoroughness and independence&#146;  (&#145;Noteworthy agriculturists: Mr. Henry Corbet&#146;). But the paper&#151;like the London Farmers' Club&#151;carried little political influence. His antipathy towards the central chamber of agriculture (founded in 1866 in the wake of the disastrous outbreak of &#145;cattle plague&#146;) further fragmented the agricultural interest at a time when it was becoming marginalized in an increasingly urban and industrial economy. Although his anecdotes and strong sense of the ludicrous made him good company, his acerbic style and tendency towards personalized attacks&#151;as, for example, in his denunciation of Samuel Sidney, the secretary of the Islington Agricultural Hall Company&#151;made him a number of enemies.<br>
<br>On his retirement from the London Farmers' Club Corbet was presented with 100 guineas; his poverty led to another collection, and he was presented with a further &pound;350 in May 1878. After the long illness which followed his stroke, he died at his home, 22 Walpole Street, Chelsea, on 29 December 1878 and was buried close to his father at Chepstow on 4 January 1879.<br>
