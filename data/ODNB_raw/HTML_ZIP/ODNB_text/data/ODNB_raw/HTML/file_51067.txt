<span class="headword">Gretton, Sir  Peter William</span>  (1912&#150;1992), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 27 August 1912 at Dalhousie, near Simla, India, the elder of the two sons of George Foster Gretton (1878&#150;1950), a major in the Indian army who, after 1919, became an active joint partner of Lillywhites, Piccadilly, developing its range of ski goods, and his wife, Teresa Anne (1875&#150;1947), the eldest of eleven children of William McEnery (1839&#150;1919), medical practitioner. His younger brother, Richard John 
    (Dick; <i>b</i>. 1915)
  , was killed in action in north Africa in 1941. Four members in five generations were recognized by the Royal Humane Society: indeed Gretton also later became a vice-president. His mother, daughter of an Irish doctor, was a Catholic. So Gretton went initially to Ladycross, a Catholic preparatory school; and he sent his own three sons to Ampleforth, two under Basil Hume's housemastership. He himself went to Dartmouth and Greenwich Royal Naval colleges, where he was prone to overwork to exhaustion. In his examinations for the rank of lieutenant, he gained &#145;a full house of firsts in the Subs' course&#146;  (autobiography, 47), that is five certificates. In 1930 he was assigned to <i>Renown</i>, flagship of the battle-cruiser squadron. The following decade gave him a rich naval panorama&#151;fleet assemblies at Gibraltar and Palma, a West Indies cruise, seatime in <i>Rodney</i>. He tried fleet flying, but found his pilot gifts wanting. His heart went to destroyers, where command responsibility came quickly; indeed he avoided specializing, preferring to remain a &#145;salthorse&#146;. During the 1936 Arab uprising he was ashore at Haifa, protecting truck convoys by mounting a 2 pound ship's pom-pom on a hired lorry for night work. He later led a mixed platoon of seamen to help the local police firefighting and street-fighting, for which he was awarded a DSC, though on land. He spent his last two years of peace instructing at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. A timely anti-submarine course saw him into war no longer &#145;on the beach&#146;, but into east-coast convoys. He was just twenty-seven and an all-round athlete&#151;horses had long featured in recreation.<br>
<br>In April 1940 Gretton became Captain Philip Vian's first lieutenant in the destroyer <i>Cossack</i>, in time for the second Narvik battle, where the battleship <i>Warspite</i> and her escort destroyer sank <i>U-64</i> and the eight survivors of the ten large German destroyers that reached port from the first Narvik battle. He was granted a mention in dispatches. The following year, commanding a destroyer kept at sea a year beyond its due life, he was appointed OBE for western approaches duties. One August night in 1942, commanding an escort destroyer, he rammed and sank an Italian submarine while screening a carrier, thus earning his first DSO.<br>
<br>Each of the services had cause to fight and win a crucial campaign: in 1940 the RAF over Britain; in 1942 the army in the desert; in 1943 the navy in the Atlantic. Each had its remarkable heroes. As to the Atlantic, two convoy escort commanders shone by their inventiveness and fierce efficiency. The first was Captain Johnny Walker (second escort group), who won the CB and four DSOs, dying of exhaustion in Liverpool in July 1944: he had persuaded his Catholic son to defer priestly training in Rome to become a submariner, as which he died at sea. The second was Gretton (B7 group), who won three DSOs and the OBE, coming through the war with strains that caused his premature retirement as fifth sea lord. Where Walker's forte was in beating U-boat tactics by team technique, Gretton's was in trained expectancy of his captains' independence. Both showed unrelenting vigour, communicated to their teams. Walker had been Gretton's Captain D in 1942. Churchill afterwards wrote: &#145;The Battle of the Atlantic was the dominant factor all through the War&#146;  (Gretton, <span class="italic">Convoy</span>, 181). Support groups were formed first in 1942, and were gradually joined by escort-carriers, and distant land-based air strikes. The &#145;crisis of crises&#146; came in the first twenty days of March 1943: in 10 days 41 ships were lost, in 10 more days 56&#151;all in convoys. The New World and the Old were all but isolated one from another. During April a hundred U-boats left the Bay of Biscay against convoys. Seemingly Britain was on the edge of surrender&#151;leaving Europe without hope of liberation (for how might D-day have been launched from across the Atlantic?).<br>
<br>After the last nightmare month&#151;March 1943&#151;monthly shipping losses never again reached three figures, fast dipping away in the summer of 1943. The battle was specifically won during four successive convoy actions, three fought by Gretton's B7 group. Details were set out in his memoir, <span class="italic">Convoy Escort Commander</span> (1964) and the May 1968 issue of <i>Navy</i>. HX231 was a fast convoy of 61 ships sailing to the UK, attacked by a pack of 17 U-boats, which sank 6 ships at the cost of considerable damage to themselves. ONS5 was a slow convoy of 39 ships sailing to the USA, attacked by 4 packs of U-boats (16, 17, 24, and 16 successively) which sank a third of the convoy; B7 group sank 8 U-boats (2 collided), damaging several more. This proved the turning point. Gretton called it &#145;the fiercest convoy action of the War&#146;  (unpublished autobiography, 83); Stephen Roskill in <span class="italic">War at Sea</span> called it &#145;as decisive as Quiberon Bay or The Nile&#146;  (Gretton, <span class="italic">Convoy</span>, 147). SC130 was a slow convoy of 39 ships sailing to the UK, attacked by 4 packs each of 20 U-boats. Five of these were sunk, one of them carrying Admiral D&ouml;nitz's son, while others were damaged. The fourth such convoy was HX239. D&ouml;nitz later wrote that Germany had &#145;radically to increase the fighting power of the U-boats &hellip; accordingly I withdrew the boats from the North Atlantic&#146;  (Gretton, <span class="italic">Convoy</span>, 161&#150;2)&#151;on 24 May, as SC130 reached home waters. In May alone, an intolerable forty-one U-boats had been sunk. In 1974, soon after full sources had been released, Gretton published his study of a single action, <span class="italic">Crisis Convoy: the Story of HX231</span>. That convoy was the first to benefit from long-range air escort from Liberators based in Iceland and Northern Ireland, combined with new support groups. Air support became crucial: HX239 had with it the first escort-carriers.<br>
<br>On 29 May 1943 Gretton married Dorothy Nancy Gladys 
    (Judy; <i>b</i>. 1920)
  , daughter of James Eastwood Du Vivier and his wife, Caroline Vau de Venne, of Belgium. She was at that time serving as a WRNS officer. There were four children: Anne (<i>b</i>. 1944), Michael Peter (<i>b</i>. 1946), William Philip (<i>b</i>. 1948), and George Richard (<i>b</i>. 1953). Later in that auspicious year Gretton, to the delight of B7, was given the role of commanding the support group, reinforcing convoy escorts. During a three-week spell at sea he supported five convoys, his ship sharing the destruction of two U-boats. His leadership, seamanship, training capacity, and grasp of problems at sea earned him his third DSO. He finished his war by writing a new <span class="roman">Admiralty convoy instruction</span>, on which he lectured around the Home Fleet, causing wonder. He was finally posted to the Admiralty, next to Churchill's chiefs of staff headquarters for joint planning. He was shifting from stale sailor to studied scholar, crystallizing what he had lived. He was privy to the fruits of Ultra and occasionally present at meetings of the chiefs of staff. His team estimated what U-boat design was reaching: if such boats got into action &#145;a new Battle of the Atlantic would be fought&#146;  (autobiography, 90)&#151;so Bomber Harris prevented production until too late. Gretton flew to Nuremberg to watch the war crimes trials: &#145;Admirals Raeder and D&ouml;nitz were most dignified&#146;  (ibid., 92).<br>
<br>Gretton reached the rank of captain early, aged thirty-six, in 1948. Until 1950 he was an observer at Washington's Naval War College, analysing S. E. Morison's new war history and arguing for large compact convoys professionally escorted. Against nuclear bombs, he advocated a full allied appreciation of Japan's collapsing economy in 1945. Until 1952 he was naval assistant to the first sea lord, Lord Fraser, who took him to allied co-ordinate meetings in Europe and the USA, showing him the nascent NATO (founded in 1949). In 1951 he represented Fraser at negotiations in Rome, finding himself overridden by the chief of the air staff. The Korean War loomed, US forces setting the pace. Churchill returned to power, overplaying his cards about Atlantic naval command. Gretton's meeting with him generated his 1968 book: <span class="italic">Former Naval Person: Churchill and the Navy</span>. Gretton then commanded the cruiser <i>Gambia</i>, largely in peaceable Malta. It assisted after a Greek earthquake, supplying by sea. Then in 1955 he became chief of staff to the admiral of the naval mission in Washington. Mountbatten became first sea lord and in November visited, essentially to co-ordinate upon nuclear submarines: &#145;He knew everyone from the President downwards&#146;  (autobiography, 131). Then in 1956&#150;7 Gretton was commodore in command of the naval task group for the British atomic tests at Christmas Island. There was no harbour there, and the anchorage enjoyed heavy swells. The USA claimed ownership, despite Captain Cook's discovery; so Gretton flew to Washington again to &#145;sort it out with Arleigh Burke&#146;  (ibid., 134) of the US navy. Three H-bombs were dropped on schedule. Then the scientists asked for more unscheduled tests, as Gretton's health broke. In 1958, losing health, he was promoted rear-admiral, and made senior naval member of the directing staff, the Imperial Defence College. He introduced a course on nuclear deterrent strategy. In 1960 he became flag officer, sea training; and was in 1961 promoted vice-admiral (his first son, Michael, following him in that rank). At Portland he trained thirty-three ships in fifteen months. In 1962 he became deputy chief of naval staff and fifth sea lord, being knighted KCB in 1963, when he retired because of his health. His legacy was to show all branches of the navy that their uncoordinated pipe dreams added up to massive financial unreality. Soon afterwards, defence budgets were hit by a wilting national economy.<br>
<br>After a restful but busy 1964, when he completed two books, his war memoir and a study of current defence problems, <span class="italic">Maritime Strategy</span> (1965), Gretton was appointed domestic bursar of University College, Oxford. There he brought high standards to the local administration. In his years there his college took in hand the creation of a science library, the erection of the Mitchell Building, the modernization of external student developments, and the refurbishing (with Judy) of college annexes. He was quickly elected a fellow, and on his retirement in 1971 a senior research fellow. His last book, initially published in Spanish, was a full-length study, <span class="italic">The Forgotten Factor: the Naval Aspect of the Spanish Civil War</span> (1984). An exceptionally handsome man, Gretton died in Oxford on 11 November 1992. He was survived by his wife and four children.<br>
