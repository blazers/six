<span class="headword">Bradley <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Layfield]</span>,  Helen</span>  (1900&#150;1979), <span class="occ">painter and writer</span>, was born on 20 November 1900 at Lees, near Oldham, Lancashire, the first of the four children of Frederick Layfield and his wife, Jane Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Shaw. Her father was a supplier of small items of hardware to shops in the Oldham area. In 1911 the family moved from Lees to Frederick Street in Oldham, where Helen Layfield attended Clarksfield School, which she left at the age of thirteen. At the prompting of the headmaster she entered for, and won, the John Platt scholarship at Oldham Art School. Despite the fact that her uncle, Charles Edward Shaw (<i>fl</i>. 1879&#150;1895), was a professional artist, her father thought it an unsuitable career for a young woman. He allowed her to study jewellery and embroidery instead but she was forced to postpone her education in 1914 with the outbreak of the war.<br>
<br>In 1926 Helen Layfield married the flower painter and textile designer Thomas Bradley (1900&#150;1993), who had also studied at Oldham Art School; they had two children, Peter and Elizabeth. It was not until Helen Bradley was sixty-five years old that she first exhibited the nostalgic narrative paintings for which she became well known. Her intention, at first, was to show her grandchildren what life had been like when she was a child. Over the next fourteen years, until her death only a week before she was due to be appointed MBE, she developed and popularized a unique style combining image and text, lucid description, and high fantasy.<br>
<br>L. S. Lowry's industrial scenes provide the most obvious parallel to Helen Bradley's work and, indeed, Lowry knew of and commented favourably on her paintings. Her style is far more anecdotal, however, and unashamedly sentimental, reflecting the homely, down-to-earth personality which would make her as popular a television chat-show guest as she was an artist. Her paintings and accompanying texts illustrate the period from 1904 to 1908. The main characters are her three maiden aunts, her mother, Helen herself, her younger brother George Bradley (<i>d</i>. 1989), Miss Carter (who wore pink), and the object of her affections, Mr Taylor, the bank manager. They are usually pictured on holiday in Blackpool or Southport, taking walks in Salford's Peel Park, or on excursions to the shops or the market. A strain of whimsical, even bizarre, humour runs through the later series of paintings, <span class="italic">In the Beginning</span>, based on stories recounted by Helen's great-aunt Jane in which God makes some very unexpected personal appearances in the streets of Oldham and Manchester.<br>
<br>Sometimes dismissed as a &#145;na&iuml;ve&#146; painter, the distinctive appearance of Helen Bradley's work represents a fusion of specific sources adapted to a very particular purpose. The absence of shading and her use of rich colours, decorative patterning, and simplified forms can be traced back to an interest in Persian and Mughal miniatures. As she said:<blockquote>All these people painted a story &hellip; The Turks also painted stories, about a kind of super-giant, and they simplified their art. They painted horses which had generals on them very big, and all the men very little, which absolutely tickled me pink. (Stafford, 5)</blockquote>When she lived in London in the 1940s, she saw an exhibition of paintings by the Dutch artist Hendrick Avercamp (1585&#150;1634), whose skies, similar to those in the paintings of J. M. W. Turner, inspired the atmospheric backdrops to her scenes of the industrial north. She also encountered works by the Chinese artist Gao Qipei (1672&#150;1734), whose lyrical and calligraphic approach to landscape is most evident in her watercolours.<br>
<br>Helen Bradley wrote and illustrated four books, the first of which, <span class="italic">And Miss Carter Wore Pink: the Diary of an Edwardian Childhood</span>, was published in 1971. Practically a household name in the 1970s, she appeared twice on Russell Harty's television chat shows and was a frequent guest on the television programmes <span class="italic">Pebble Mill at One</span> and <span class="italic">Jackanory</span>. Helen Bradley died at her home, 2 Green Villa Park, Wilmslow, Cheshire, on 19 July 1979. She was cremated at Prestbury crematorium on 23 July and a service of thanksgiving was held at the United Reformed church in Wilmslow on the same day. Her estate was valued for probate under the name Nellie Bradley. Her paintings have continued to command high prices at auction and have regularly featured in retrospective exhibitions in the 1980s and 1990s, including Warrington Museum and Art Gallery in 1991 and in Osaka, Japan, in 1993. The Museum and Art Gallery, Salford, owns <span class="italic">It was a Beautiful Place &hellip;</span>, a view in Peel Park, and there are further works in the Atkinson Art Gallery, Southport, and Oldham Art Gallery. Miss Carter Publications, which Helen Bradley and her husband, Tom, were instrumental in setting up, continued in the late twentieth century to promote her work through limited-edition prints and reproductions.<br>
