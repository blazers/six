<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kinnaird,  Douglas James William</span>  (1788&#150;1830), <span class="occ">writer and politician</span>, was born on 26 February 1788, the fourth surviving son of George, seventh Lord Kinnaird (1754&#150;1805), of Inchture, Perthshire, and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1805), sole heir to Griffin Ransom, banker, of Westminster. He was educated briefly at Eton College (1799&#150;1802), then at G&ouml;ttingen University, where he acquired fluent French and German. He graduated MA from Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1811. In July 1813, with John Cam Hobhouse, he visited the Russian Emperor Alexander I's headquarters at Peterswaldau. Kinnaird then witnessed the Russo-Prussian victory over the French at Kulm, on 30 August. Travelling via Prague to Paris, he was present at Louis XVIII's first entry, on 28 April 1814, before returning to England with the journalist William Jerdan.<br>
<br>Although Kinnaird had been acquainted with Byron at Cambridge, their friendship began in earnest in the winter of 1814 when Thomas Moore recalls &#145;those evenings we passed together at the house of &hellip; Douglas Kinnaird, where music,&#151;followed by its accustomed sequel of supper, brandy and water, and not a little laughter,&#151;kept us together, usually till rather a late hour&#146;  (Moore, 3.136&#150;7). These parties were presided over by Kinnaird's mistress, the minor actor and singer Maria Keppel, mother to a son born in April 1814. Their relationship, which lasted from 1809 to 1818, was extremely volatile, with frequent separations. Neither she, nor the illegitimate child, was remembered in his will. In May 1815 Kinnaird was elected to the management subcommittee of Drury Lane Theatre, boasting to Hobhouse of &#145;drawing our friend Byron into the same situation&#146;. He continued &#145;the Lord is delighted with his office, &amp; will, I think fill it nobly&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 47224, fol. 3). Not surprisingly, he wrote a letter dated 26 March 1816, denying all Lady Byron's charges against her husband  (Broughton, 2.320&#150;21); but the sharing of Kinnaird's bachelor lifestyle and his close involvement with the stage undoubtedly hastened the collapse of Byron's marriage. Kinnaird introduced the poet to both Edmund Kean and Isaac Nathan, for the latter of whom Byron wrote the <span class="italic">Hebrew Melodies</span>, &#145;at the request of my friend, the Hon. Douglas Kinnaird&#146;  (&#145;Advertisement&#146; to <span class="italic">Hebrew Melodies</span>, January 1815).<br>
<br>In London on 22 April 1816 Kinnaird and Maria Keppel gave Byron two bottles of champagne and a cake as parting gifts before he left England for ever three days later. Byron had awarded him power of attorney, so that thereafter, as well as handling all of his English finances, Kinnaird was the chief recipient of his correspondence from Italy. He commissioned Byron's &#145;Monody on the Death of the Right Hon. R. B. Sheridan&#146;, written at Villa Diodati in July 1816, spoken by Mrs Davison at Drury Lane on 7 September that year. Effectively running that playhouse after the suicide of Sir Samuel Whitbread, Kinnaird's greatest theatrical coup was to persuade Junius Brutus Booth to leave Covent Garden and act Iago to Kean's Othello on 20 February 1817. &#145;It was made the more dramatic by the fact that Kinnaird had got Kean to convey the invitation to Booth and invite his own antagonist to do battle with him&#146;  (Macqueen Pope, 250). Thus the &#145;greatest histrionic battle of the century was arranged&#146;  (Playfair, 170); but Booth was obliged to concede that Kean &#145;had won a signal victory&#146;  (ibid., 173).<br>
<br>In 1817, in Munich with his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15632/', "Charles Kinnaird (1780&#150;1826)")</script>, Kinnaird dined with Maximilian I of Bavaria and his son-in-law Eug&egrave;ne de Beauharnais, later meeting Princess Hortense of Holland at Augsberg. The brothers travelled on to Venice where they saw Byron. The significance of this visit (19 September&#150;1 October) is that Kinnaird brought a copy of John Hookham Frere's recently published &#145;Whistlecraft&#146;. Seeing <i>ottava rima</i> successfully applied to comic English poetry immediately inspired Byron to write <span class="italic">Beppo</span>, and subsequently influenced <span class="italic">Don Juan</span> itself.<br>
<br>Politically on the radical left, Kinnaird was a member of the &#145;Rota&#146; dining club, and first attempted to enter parliament in the general election of 1818. Although nominated as a candidate for the Westminster seat, he stood down in favour of Sir Francis Burdett. Kinnaird was however elected MP for Bishops Castle, Shropshire, at a by-election in July the following year. This enabled him to speak defending his friend in the debate on Hobhouse's notorious <span class="italic">Trifling Mistake</span> pamphlet in December 1819, when the latter was imprisoned for breach of parliamentary privilege. On 16 December from Newgate Hobhouse wrote &#145;D. Kinnaird &hellip; has made a failure in the H. of Commons &amp; is ashamed&#151;or his partners wish to keep him from public meetings&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 56540), alluding to his avoidance of mass reform rallies and increased involvement with the family bank. On the dissolution of the partnership with Sir F. B. Morland that year, Kinnaird became sole managing director. In the general election of March 1820 he was re-elected by only four votes in the double return for Bishops Castle, but declared &#145;not duly elected&#146; in July when he stood down from parliament never to return. Yet his political activism continued; in January 1821 he was again in Paris, &#145;staying with Lord Rancliffe&#146; and meeting liberal members of the chamber of deputies  (BL, Add. MS 47224, fol. 17). He also remained a speaker at East India House debates and published <span class="italic">Remarks on the Volume of Hyderabad Papers, etc</span> in 1825. His only other publication was a free adaptation of John Fletcher's <span class="italic">Merchant of Bruges</span> (1815), which enjoyed some success at Drury Lane in that year.<br>
<br>As well as handling Byron's English finances, Kinnaird was also deeply involved in the publication of all his works after 1816, being sent manuscripts and instructed to &#145;<i>correct</i> the <i>proofs</i> and arrange with [John] Murray for me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Byron's Letters and Journals</span>, 5.83). When the first canto of &#145;Don Juan&#146; arrived in London in December 1818, alone among Byron's friends Kinnaird &#145;did not <i>then</i> [according to Hobhouse] see the objection to publishing&#146;  (Graham, 257); though Hobhouse and Scrope Berdmore Davies later &#145;changed his opinion&#146;  (ibid., 260). It was Kinnaird who, on 14 May 1824, was the first in England to learn of Byron's fate at Missolonghi, immediately writing from his own sickbed to Hobhouse: &#145;delay is absurd &amp; I know not how to soften what your own fortitude alone can make you bear like a man&#151;Byron is no more&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 47224, fol. 26). To Hobhouse's relief, Kinnaird then volunteered to break the news of her brother's death to Augusta Leigh. Soon afterwards he was involved with Byron's funeral arrangements, including applying to Dr Ireland, dean of Westminster, to request interment in the Abbey. This annoyed Hobhouse because it had &#145;given [Ireland] an opportunity to refuse burial&#146; there  (Marchand, 468). On 16 May 1824 Kinnaird was &#145;obliged to depart immediately for Scotland&#146;  (Broughton, 3.336), so he was not present at the destruction, the following day, of Byron's &#145;Memoirs&#146;. This was diplomatic, but he must have been against the burning.<br>
<br>Despite describing that lady as &#145;I think half = witted&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 47224, fol. 40), Kinnaird was anxious to help Augusta Leigh when he realized her to be &#145;in great difficulty&#146; financially in 1829. Before he could do so, however, he succumbed to a cancer which he had bravely suffered for several years. He died at his Pall Mall home, aged forty-two, on Friday 12 March 1830, less than a fortnight after writing his will, and was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 19 March. John Cam Hobhouse was being modest when he told Samuel Rogers, &#145;I am sure Kinnaird is the best friend Byron ever had in the world&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 56548), but he certainly came a close second to Hobhouse.<br>
