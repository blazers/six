<span class="headword">Powell,  Thomas</span>  (1779&#150;1863), <span class="occ">coal owner</span>, was born in Monmouthshire (at Monmouth or Chepstow) on 6 January 1779, the son of John Powell. No records of his early life and education have been found. His substantial achievement was to lay the foundations of the Powell Duffryn Company, the most widely known name in the Welsh coal industry.<br>
<br>Powell began his commercial career around 1810 as a timber merchant. He became interested in Monmouthshire's newly developing bituminous (house) coal industry, which at the time was mostly operated through single, small-scale enterprises. Powell's ambitions were wider. In 1837, along with Thomas Protheroe and Joseph Latch, he made a determined effort to control Monmouthshire coal prices by forming the Newport Coal Company, through which the main proprietors were to sell their coal. Before 1840 he had already become the greatest single figure in the bituminous coal trade, and by 1841 he owned four collieries&#151;Gelli-gaer, Gelli-groes, Bryn, and, in partnership with Protheroe, Buttery Hatch&#151;which employed 431 men and boys.<br>
<br>Powell was also exceptionally quick to recognize the potential of the new trade in steam coal from Cardiff, and perceptive in not following its legendary pioneer, Lucy Thomas, into the Merthyr valley in the 1830s. Instead he moved to the virtually unworked Aberd&acirc;r (Cynon) valley and rapidly opened a succession of collieries to serve this new market: Old Dyffryn (Tir Ffounder) was sunk first (1840&#150;42), then came Upper Dyffryn (1844&#150;6), Middle Dyffryn (1850), Lower Dyffryn and Cwm Pennar (1850&#150;54), Abergwawr (1855), and Cwmdare (1852&#150;4). Thomas Powell was unique at this stage of the development of the coal industry of south Wales. By the time he was sixty and heavily handicapped by deafness he had built up a similar supremacy in the business of steam coal to the one he had achieved in the bituminous coal trade. At a time when even the most enterprising were unlikely to be involved in more than two collieries, he ruled over a multi-pit undertaking.<br>
<br>Powell's other activities&#151;in banking, docks, and railways (he was on the original board of the Taff Vale Railway)&#151;were influenced by and undertaken to support his coal enterprises. By 1862 he owned sixteen pits and exported 700,000 tons of coal a year. After his death his property passed to his three sons (his will was stolen but dramatically recovered by a policeman disguised as a woman), who avoided their obligations by selling, for &pound;365,000, all the steam-coal collieries in the Aberd&acirc;r valley, together with the New Tredegar colliery in the Rhymni valley, to a group headed by Sir George Elliot; and on 28 July 1864 the Powell Duffryn Steam Coal Company was formed.<br>
<br>Thomas Powell lived a long life of frugality and industry: the day before his death at the age of eighty-three he had been at work in his Newport office. He left a personal estate of about &pound;250,000. Even the most celebratory books on the coal pioneers, however, hint at something more dubious than an industrious approach. It is not surprising, therefore, to find the colliery owner John Nixon complaining that Powell had simply reneged on paying him an agreed commission for marketing Powell's coal in France. Nixon recorded Powell's blunt response: &#145;I had a law suit with Lord Bute, and I beat him &hellip; I never in my life made an agreement that I could not get out of&#146;  (Vincent, 152). This was not entirely accurate: in 1841 Powell had been obliged to pay substantial damages to Sir Charles Morgan of Tredegar for moving coal under his land without a way-leave. More creditably, after an explosion killing twenty-eight people at Dyffryn in 1845, Powell rejected a public subscription to care for the five widows, instead giving them an allowance of 9<i>s</i>. a week with housing and coal.<br>
<br>Powell was one of the first six aldermen of Newport under the 1835 act. He was a member of the Church of England, and was married three times (although his family life is obscure). He is known to have had three sons and at least two daughters. The eldest son was, with his family, murdered in Abyssinia in 1869; the youngest disappeared without trace while in a hot-air balloon over the English Channel in 1881; and the middle son later died following a blow from a horse. Thomas Powell died at home at The Gaer, in the parish of St Woolos, Newport, on 24 March 1863, survived by his third wife, Anne Powell.<br>
