<span class="headword">Ashton, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1384), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, came from Long Ashton in Somerset, and was the son of another Robert Ashton. The younger Robert's date of birth is uncertain, but he was already a knight in 1361. He accompanied Lionel, duke of Clarence to Ireland and was appointed chancellor there on 24 October 1364&#151;he had already exercised the office for some time&#151;and he held the post until 20 February 1367. He is noted as one of the king's bachelors at Christmas 1366, and by January 1368 had also served as captain of Gu&icirc;nes. Just before war with France resumed, he was sent to Ponthieu to inspect the fortifications of the surrounding region, a matter on which he was later deemed an expert. Arriving on 22 March 1369 at Le Crotoy, of which he became captain, he was forced to leave in early May when the French overran the county. But by then he had been named admiral to the west, and in this capacity he took part in inconclusive operations in Normandy later in the year. In 1371 he became keeper of Southampton, but in the following summer he was sent back to Ireland as justiciar to investigate complaints about Sir William Windsor's administration, which he did so conscientiously but slowly, until Windsor himself replaced him as justiciar on 20 September.<br>
<br>Ashton next participated in the earl of March's unsuccessful expedition to restore Duke John IV of Brittany in 1374&#150;5. Complaints were later made specifically about the depredations of Ashton's men in Devon, but he remained high in the trust of the ageing king and his sons. On 26 September 1375 he was appointed treasurer and, although attacked in the Good Parliament, he managed to escape the opprobrium that fell on the other favourites with whom he was closely associated, like William, Lord Latimer, Alice Perrers, and Richard Lyons; he was treasurer until 11 January 1377, when he became king's chamberlain. His success in steering through this turbulent period unscathed may have been partly due to his abilities as an orator and skilled diplomat; these were demonstrated in a hostile speech against the papacy delivered in convocation in January 1377, by his nomination as envoy to the Anglo-French peace talks at Bruges in April, and by Walsingham's account of an alleged tirade against the Londoners on Gaunt's behalf (though the <span class="italic">Anonimalle Chronicle</span> attributes this to Gaunt himself).<br>
<br>Ashton remained active in Richard II's early years, combining his duties as admiral with various captaincies, such as those of Sangatte and Gu&icirc;nes in the Calais pale, and defence of the Isle of Wight. Appointed keeper of Porchester Castle on 15 February 1376, he undertook major repairs, and a tower at the north-east angle of the inner ward, incorporating novel artillery features, still bears his name. He remained close to John of Gaunt, owing to the duke his appointment as under-constable of England in 1381, during the earl of Buckingham's absence abroad, as well as the keepership of Ashdown forest. On 1 February 1381 he resigned his custody of Porchester to take up the constableship of Dover and wardenship of the Cinque Ports, for which he received &pound;300 p.a. In this key role he not only continued to play his part as admiral but also helped to suppress the peasants' revolt in Kent, while taking his share in local administration.<br>
<br>Ashton died on 9 January 1384. His first wife, Elizabeth de l'Orti, previously married to Ralph Middleney (<i>d</i>. 1361), held lands in Somerset and Dorset, and their daughter, Eleanor (also known as Alice), married John Berkeley of Over, in Gloucestershire. Ashton's second wife was Philippa Talbot, who after his death married successively Sir Matthew Gournay and Sir John Tiptoft, and died in 1417. As treasurer Ashton enjoyed several lucrative wardships and during his career he accumulated many manors, chiefly in the west country. The heirs to his Dorset and Gloucestershire lands were the descendants of his father's sister, Isabel; those in Somerset went to his second wife or to Sir William Windsor by virtue of deeds previously drawn up with Alice Perrers. Ashton was buried in the church of St Mary de Castro at Dover, where a commemorative brass once existed.<br>
