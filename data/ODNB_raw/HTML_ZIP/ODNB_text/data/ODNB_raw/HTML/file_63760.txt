<span class="headword">Hodgson,  Solomon</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1760, <em>d.</em> 1800), <span class="occ">printer and newspaper proprietor</span>, was baptized in Long Marton, Westmorland, on 29 September 1760, the son of Solomon Hodgson (1715/16&#150;1779) of Knock, in that parish and his wife, Sarah Lothian (1718/19&#150;1806), of Kirkoswald. He married in St John's Church, Newcastle upon Tyne, on 15 February 1785, Sarah [<a name="cosubject_64893"></a><span class="headword">Sarah Hodgson</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1760, <em>d.</em> 1822)], <span class="occ">printer and newspaper proprietor</span>, fifth daughter of Thomas Slack (1723?&#150;1784) and Anne Fisher (1719&#150;1778), who after Solomon Hodgson's death in 1800 continued and expanded the printing, bookselling, and newspaper businesses, in which she was always actively concerned.<br>
<br>It is supposed that Hodgson was apprenticed to Thomas Slack, assisting him in the work of his printing shop and in the publication of the <span class="italic">Newcastle Chronicle</span>, a weekly newspaper launched by Slack in March 1764. On 21 February 1785 the executors of Thomas Slack's estate transferred to Solomon Hodgson the <span class="italic">Newcastle Chronicle</span>, together with the printing, bookselling, and stationery business. It is probable that Hodgson also offered binding for, according to Thomas Bewick, he employed Gilbert Gray, a bookbinder who had served his time under Allan Ramsay, the Edinburgh poet and bookseller. Solomon, and later his widow, like Slack, also sold by retail and wholesale many nostrums, advertisements for them appearing regularly in their newspaper. The imprint &#145;S. Hodgson&#146; appears in 1784 on an edition of <span class="italic">The History of All Nations</span>, printed for G. Robinson in London; he must, therefore, have assumed responsibility for the business immediately on the death of Thomas Slack, who bequeathed it, in a poorly drawn will, to his daughter Sarah. In 1794 Hodgson sold his bookselling and stationery business at his shop in Union Street to John (I) Bell (1755&#150;1816), his former manager who had married Hodgson's sister-in-law, Anne Slack. In June 1800 Sarah Hodgson made clear her intention to buy back this business at the end of Bell's lease; this was completed by 1803 and thereafter she infused new life into the whole concern.<br>
<br>Solomon Hodgson continued to develop the <span class="italic">Newcastle Chronicle</span>, acting as reporter, editor, and publisher, as well as advertising agent. His retentive memory allowed him to report political and other speeches without recourse to notes taken at the time. Richard Welford writes that Hodgson<blockquote>uniformly advanced the genuine sentiments of his mind, uninfluenced by party, or any political society &hellip; and so long as he could do it consistently with personal safety, he exercised the privilege of declaring his sentiments on every important subject with a boldness and freedom becoming a Briton &hellip; (Welford, <span class="italic">Men of Mark</span>, 2.544&#150;5)</blockquote>Hodgson's efforts &#145;raised the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> to the position of the leading organ of Whig politics in the North of England&#146;  (Welford, &#145;Early Newcastle typography&#146;, 46). Following Hodgson's death the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> of 11 April 1800 carried an advertisement from his widow in which she stated that she had taken over the paper from her late husband, adding &#145;She trusts that, in Consequence of the Arrangements which she has it in her Power to make, that Paper will be found not unworthy of the Patronage from a generous Public which it has hitherto experienced&#146;. From 1784 the newspaper had been composed by William Preston, who assisted Sarah Hodgson with the editing and publishing of the <span class="italic">Newcastle Chronicle</span> after the death of her husband. Preston left in May 1808 to set up in business as a printer with William Heaton, another former Hodgson employee. Sarah was later assisted in the production of the newspaper by her sons Thomas (1785&#150;1850) and James (1798&#150;1867), later an alderman who became mayor of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1841. In 1850 the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> was sold to Mark William Lambert (1812&#150;1893), who, in turn, sold it to Joseph Cowen (1831&#150;1900), industrialist and MP, when it became a radical campaigning journal; it ceased publication in 1953.<br>
<br>The Hodgsons continued the successful publications started by Thomas and Anne Slack, in particular the <span class="italic">Newcastle Memorandum-Book</span>, an annual which ceased publication only in 1893, and Mrs Slack's <span class="italic">Ladies' Own Memorandum-Book</span>, which he, followed by Sarah Hodgson, published jointly with the London publishers George Robinson &amp; Co.; until the latter failed in 1805. Hodgson also issued editions of two more works by Mrs Slack, published under her maiden name, Anne Fisher: <span class="italic">A Practical New Grammar</span>, which appeared in 1785, 1787, 1788, 1789 (with a London-printed edition in the same year), 1795, and 1800; and <span class="italic">The New English Tutor</span> (undated, but probably after 1786). Sarah published an edition of her mother's <span class="italic">Young Scholar's Delight</span> in 1802. Solomon also issued editions of S. Thomas's (supposedly Thomas Slack's pseudonym) <span class="italic">The Banker's Sure Guide</span> in 1791 and 1798, with an issue by Sarah in 1803; <span class="italic">The British Negociator</span> in 1791, with one by Sarah in 1814; and <span class="italic">The Ready Calculator</span> in 1786.<br>
<br>Many of the works listed for Solomon Hodgson in the <span class="italic">English Short-Title Catalogue</span> are slight items such as sermons and advertisements for subscription concerts, but it was not long after taking charge of the business that he became concerned with more substantial new material. In 1785 he printed the first volume of William Hutchinson's <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of the County Palatine of Durham</span>, a large illustrated quarto. The second volume appeared in 1787, but, having fallen out with the author, Hodgson was not responsible for the third.<br>
<br>In 1786 Hodgson printed and published Mary Smith's <span class="italic">The Complete House-Keeper</span> (always a popular subject), and in the same year three works by Claude Fleury, <span class="italic">A Larger Historical Catechism</span>, <span class="italic">The Manners of the Israelites</span>, and <span class="italic">The Manners of the Christians</span> (the latter two translated by Charles Cordell, a Catholic priest living in Newcastle). Each year thereafter saw substantial works for which he was responsible, among them John Bailey's <span class="italic">General View of the Agriculture of the County of Northumberland</span> (1797) for Sir John Sinclair's board of agriculture.<br>
<br>The Hodgsons were also innovative in their choice of titles. Edward Moises' <span class="italic">The Persian Interpreter</span> (1792) was the first book to be printed in an Arabic typeface in England outside London and the university towns of Oxford and Cambridge. At the end of this volume Moises presented proposals for the publication by subscription of an edition in six volumes of <span class="italic">The Persian Poets, Historians, and Moralists</span>, and of a large, one-volume Persian, Arabic, and English dictionary; nothing seems to have come of these proposals.<br>
<br>About 1803 Sarah Hodgson started printing an Arabic version of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, prepared by Joseph Dacre Carlyle (1759&#150;1806), vicar of Newcastle upon Tyne, chancellor of Carlisle, and professor of Arabic at the University of Cambridge. Charles Wilkins, in the advertisement for his edition of John Richardson's <span class="italic">Dictionary, Persian, Arabic and English</span> (1806), wrote of the Arabic typeface used in that work:<blockquote>The punches were gratuitously designed by myself, and executed, under my superintendence, by that ingenious mechanic, Mr William Martin [employed by George Nicol as type designer and typefounder for the Shakspeare Press of William Bulmer], expressly for the purpose of printing a portable edition of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> in the Arabic language &hellip; [by] &hellip; that celebrated Arabic scholar &hellip; the Reverend Mr. Carlisle &hellip;</blockquote>This work, with the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in Arabic, was finally published in 1811 as <span class="italic">The Holy Bible Containing the Old and New Testaments in the Arabic Language</span>; it was produced under the patronage of Shute Barrington (1734&#150;1826), bishop of Durham. After Carlyle's death it was seen through the press by Henry Ford, lord almoner's reader in Arabic at Oxford. This work should have been the first showing of Martin's Arabic type, which actually appeared first in William Jones's <span class="italic">Grammar of the Persian Language</span> (1804). The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts contributed &pound;250 for 1000 copies of the Arabic <span class="roman">Bible</span> to be distributed in Africa and Asia, and the British and Foreign Bible Society also gave &pound;250, purchasing or receiving over 1000 copies. Sarah Hodgson also used Martin's Arabic typeface in 1809 in <span class="italic">The Arabick Alphabet</span>, a slim octavo booklet by Thomas Burgess, bishop of St David's.<br>
<br>Solomon Hodgson was friendly with the wood-engraver Thomas Bewick, and when the latter and his business partner, Ralph Beilby, were considering publishing <span class="italic">A General History of Quadrupeds</span> they consulted the printer &#145;as to the probability of such a publication paying us for our labours&#146;, and were &#145;most warmly encouraged &hellip; to proceed&#146;, adding the footnote &#145;In this we were greatly mistaken, for Solomon's dissipated life prevented him attending to it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 105&#150;6). Hodgson printed (and published) the first four editions of the <span class="italic">General History</span> in 1790, 1791, 1792, and 1800, and printed the first two editions of <span class="italic">Land Birds</span>, volume 1 of the <span class="italic">History of British Birds</span>, in 1797 and 1800, and <span class="italic">Figures of British Land Birds</span> in 1800. The name Hodgson does not appear in the imprint of these works after 1800.<br>
<br>After the death of Solomon Hodgson, Bewick quarrelled bitterly with his widow over a small discrepancy in the account for the printing of the first volume of the <span class="italic">History of British Birds</span>. The engraver found he &#145;could not go on pleasantly with Mrs Hodgson in the Printing of the Quadrupeds&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 125), and offered to buy her share in the work; she refused to sell and later sold it to the London publisher Longman. Nevertheless, in 1805 the engraver had recovered from his ill feeling sufficiently to withdraw the charge that he had made for a memorial cut to Samuel Hodgson, reproduced in John Sykes's <span class="italic">Local Records</span>, (1866, 2.2).<br>
<br>In 1799 Hodgson printed and published <span class="italic">The Hive of Ancient &amp; Modern Literature</span>, a selection by himself of short pieces of prose and verse &#145;to inculcate in the minds of youth strong impressions of their moral obligations&#146;. It is &#145;embellished with a number of engravings on wood by T. Bewick and L. Clennell, both of Newcastle&#146; and was reprinted several times, Sarah publishing the third edition in 1806 and the fourth in 1812.<br>
<br>In 1788 Hodgson printed for the Newcastle Dispensary (founded in 1777) a report on inoculation, and in the following year one on the resuscitation of drowned persons. He started printing the dispensary's annual reports in 1796, and was followed until 1821 by Sarah Hodgson when she transferred the work to her sons. Sarah also took over the printing of the annual reports of the Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Society in 1800, continuing until the year of her death, when her sons again took over. The society had been founded in 1793 by William Turner, the Unitarian minister of Hanover Square Chapel, Newcastle, and it may be that Sarah changed her religious affiliation about this time. The first of Turner's sermons to be printed by her appeared in 1800, and she and her sons were reported to have been members of Turner's Unitarian congregation  (Welford, <span class="italic">Men of mark</span>, 2.548). Sarah printed several more of Turner's sermons and other works for the Unitarian chapel. It appears that Solomon had remained an Anglican. He died on 4 April 1800 and was buried under a table monument in the churchyard of St John's Church, Newcastle.<br>
<br>Sarah Hodgson died on 10 September 1822 at Newcastle upon Tyne after a short illness, reported by the <span class="italic">Tyne Mercury</span> as cholera morbus (presumably European cholera). The Revd William Turner preached the sermon, afterwards published, at her funeral at the Hanover Square Chapel on 15 September.<br>
