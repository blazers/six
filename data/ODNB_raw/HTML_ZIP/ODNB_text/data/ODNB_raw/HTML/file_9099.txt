<span class="headword">Fairland,  Thomas</span>  (1804&#150;1852), <span class="occ">lithographer and engraver</span>, took an interest in drawing at an early age and worked from nature in London's Kensington Gardens; later he studied under Fuseli at the Royal Academy, where he gained a silver medal for a drawing of a cast of Hercules which then stood in the academy's entrance hall. On leaving the academy he became a pupil of the line engraver Charles Warren, but in the late 1820s he was attracted to lithography, which was then challenging engraving in several fields of printmaking. About this time he exhibited a few works at the Suffolk Street Galleries (1828&#150;33). Lithography seems to have suited his talents as a draughtsman, and he soon became one of the best-known reproductive lithographers in Britain, though he had no reputation at all as an original lithographer and therefore hardly figures in the literature of the subject. His reproductive lithography includes work after his British contemporaries, among them A. Cooper, R. Farrier, C. Hancock, and Edwin Landseer, and after major artists such as David, Matsys, and Raphael. A volume of <span class="italic">Comic Sketches</span> (1844), after W. Hunt, is said to have been particularly popular, and his reproduction of a cartoon of the <span class="italic">Virgin and Child</span> by Raphael attracted attention. He also lithographed many portraits, pictures of animals, and plates for drawing books. Though his work as a lithographic draughtsman was much admired in its day, it was also criticized. An anonymous contemporary writer referred to the comic pictures he lithographed after Farrier as done &#145;with great boldness and spirit&#146;, but noted that &#145;He does not succeed, however, in producing clear and brilliant tints and effects, and consequently his style appears heavy when it would otherwise be forcible&#146;  (<span class="italic">Library of the Fine Arts</span>, 210).<br>
<br>With the passing of time Fairland has come to be seen as one of the minor reproductive lithographic draughtsmen of the second quarter of the nineteenth century. In 1829 he lithographed two plates, as did his brother William, for Flaxman's <span class="italic">Lectures on Sculpture</span>, and by 1830 the two men were listed as working together as lithographic printers in London. From the late 1830s into the 1840s Fairland worked as a lithographic printer on his own account from 45 St John's Square, Clerkenwell, sometimes printing his own lithographs. As a draughtsman he appears to have had no firm allegiance to any one printer and his lithographs were printed by several firms: Hullmandel, Day, Graf, and M. and N. Hanhart. Nevertheless, in 1842 he submitted affidavits (as did William Day and Jeremiah Graf) in support of Charles Hancock in his dispute with Charles Hullmandel over the latter's lithotint patent. He also worked as a portrait painter, undertaking commissions for eminent people, including royalty. Despite a large output of reproductive lithography, he struggled to make a good living from his work; he was not helped by long-term health problems, which led to his premature death on 22 October 1852, at his home, 15 Aberdeen Place, Marylebone.<br>
<br>His younger brother William Fairland (<i>b</i>. 1806), also an engraver and lithographer, took up lithography before him; among his earliest lithographs are some fine plates for the second volume of George Simpson's <span class="italic">The Anatomy of the Bones and Muscles</span> (1825).<br>
