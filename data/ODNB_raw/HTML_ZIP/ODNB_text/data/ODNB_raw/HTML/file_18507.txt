<span class="headword">Meehan,  Charles Patrick</span>  (1812&#150;1890), <span class="occ">writer and translator</span>, was born at 141 Great Britain (now Parnell) Street, Dublin, on 12 July 1812. He received his early education at his parents' native town, Ballymahon, co. Longford, and in 1828 went to the Irish College in Rome, where he was ordained priest in 1834. He also acquired a good knowledge of Italian, German, French, and Spanish there. After nine months' work as a curate at Rathdrum, co. Wicklow, he was transferred to a curacy at the parish church of Sts Michael and John, Exchange Street, Dublin, in 1835. He remained there all his life. He was well known for his charity and temperance activity.<br>
<br>As a member of the Romantic nationalist group Young Ireland, Meehan contributed to <span class="italic">The Nation</span>. His first poem, &#145;Boyhood's Years&#146;, appeared in the journal on 5 November 1842 under the pseudonym Clericus. A few more poems, translations of continental poetry, and articles followed. Meehan was known for his wit, and Young Irelanders often gathered in his presbytery. He was close friends with John Mitchel, Father Kenyon, T. D. Reilly, and James Clarence Mangan.<br>
<br>Meehan prominently defended Young Ireland from accusations of atheism, and also spoke in favour of mixed education. He seceded with Young Ireland from Daniel O'Connell's repeal movement in 1846, and became an active member of the Irish confederation. He wrote <span class="italic">History of the Confederation of Kilkenny</span> (1846) and a translation from the Latin of Dominic O'Daly, <span class="italic">The Geraldines, Earls of Desmond</span> (1847) for the <span class="roman">Library of Ireland</span>.<br>
<br>In 1847 Meehan was president of St Patrick's Confederate Club, which met in Bishop Street, Dublin, but retired in the hope for an appointment at one of the new queen's colleges. He published <span class="italic">The life and death of Most Rev. Francis Kirwan, bishop of Killala, from the Latin of John Lynch, archdeacon of Tuam, author of Cambrensus eversus</span> in 1848.<br>
<br>After the failed rising of 1848 Meehan appears to have taken no further part in public life, but focused on his parish duties and his literary work. He gave occasional lectures, and visited famous libraries on the continent in search of unpublished manuscripts dealing with Ireland. In 1865 he was elected member of the Royal Irish Academy, and he was known in Irish literary circles. He wrote many articles in Irish periodicals, mainly translations and historical works. His chief compilations were <span class="italic">Rise and fall of Irish Franciscan monasteries, and memoirs of the Irish hierarchy in the seventeenth century</span> (1869) and <span class="italic">Fate and Fortunes of Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, and Rory O'Donell, Earl of Tyrconnel</span> (1870); the latter was popularly known as &#145;The flight of the earls&#146;. He also edited Thomas Davis's essays (1883) and selections of Mangan's poetry (1884), and re-edited Richard R. Madden's <span class="italic">Literary Remains of the United Irishmen</span> (1887).<br>
<br>In his old age Meehan was regarded as an eccentric. He was &#145;slightly under medium height, always wore a monocle, attached to a silk ribbon, a tall silk hat, and a stout blackthorn stick&#146;  (O'Sullivan, 314). He died on 14 March 1890 in the presbytery of Sts Michael and John, Lower Exchange Street, Dublin, and was buried in Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin. His parishioners erected a mural tablet to him in the church of Sts Michael and John.<br>
