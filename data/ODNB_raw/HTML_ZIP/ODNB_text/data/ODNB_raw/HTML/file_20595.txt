<span class="headword">Ogilvy,  James</span>, fifth Lord Ogilvy of Airlie  (1540/41&#150;1606), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the eldest son of James Ogilvy, master of Ogilvy (<i>c</i>.1520&#150;1547), and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69900/', "Katherine Campbell (d. 1578)")</script>, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75460/', "Sir John Campbell")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70941/', "Campbell family, of Cawdor")</script>] and Muriel Calder of Cawdor. His father having died at the battle of Pinkie on 10 September 1547, he succeeded his grandfather, James, fourth Lord Ogilvy of Airlie, some time before 13 July 1548. His mother married the ninth earl of Crawford in 1549 and in 1558 he himself married Jean Forbes (1541&#150;<i>c</i>.1610), eldest daughter of William, seventh Lord Forbes, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Keith. They had eight sons: James, sixth Lord Ogilvy of Airlie; Sir John of Craig; David of Pitmuies; William, a pensioner of Kirriemuir and Newtyle; Archibald, who probably died young; Patrick of Muirton; Francis of Newgrange; and George of Friock; as well as a daughter, Margaret, who wed first George Keith, fifth Earl Marischal, and then, after his death, Alexander Strachan of Thornton.<br>
<br>A powerful figure in Forfarshire, Lord Ogilvy joined the lords of congregation at Perth in June 1559 and was one of the Scottish commissioners who brokered the treaty of Berwick on 27 February 1560. The decision taken by Alexander Ogilvy of Deskford and Findlater in 1545 to disinherit his son in favour of his wife's relation Sir John Gordon, third son of the fourth earl of Huntly, caused great division between the Ogilvys and Gordons, which had reached its peak by the time Queen Mary returned to Scotland in August 1561. On 10 September 1562 Gordon of Deskford attacked Lord Ogilvy outside the Aberdeen tolbooth, severely wounding his right arm. Ogilvy joined the crown forces brought north to bring Deskford to heel and when the Gordons opposed these at Corrichie on 28 October they were routed, Deskford being taken prisoner and executed. Ogilvy received a commission with neighbouring lords in September 1563 to remove the MacGregors from their lands. When the earl of Moray and the duke of Chatelherault rebelled in 1565, Ogilvy supported the crown. He attended the dinner given by Lord Bothwell in the Ainslie tavern in April 1567 and signed the bond supporting the earl's marriage to the queen, but subsequently joined the confederacy of nobles who gathered at Stirling in June determined to safeguard the infant prince and separate Mary from Bothwell. He was not present at Carberry on the 15th, however, and cannot have approved of the subsequent forced abdication and imprisonment of the queen.<br>
<br>When Mary escaped from Lochleven Castle on 2 May 1568 Ogilvy signed the Hamilton bond and rode north to muster forces, but was unable to reach the queen's army before its precipitate defeat at Langside on the 13th. Lord Ogilvy, who was able to carry most of the Ogilvy lairds, including Inverkeilor and Balgro, into the queen's party, assembled with other Marian supporters at Largs at the end of July. Though he signed a bond in April 1569 acknowledging Moray's authority as regent, he wrote to Mary the following month confirming his allegiance. He attended the Perth convention in July, voting against the queen's divorce from Bothwell. In December, Ogilvy and his wife were ordered to desist from oppressing John Stirling of Easter Brakie. The following August, Ogilvy acted in concert with the earl of Crawford and Sir James Balfour of Pittendreich in proclaiming the queen at Brechin and Forfar. However, the earl of Morton's sudden descent on Forfarshire forced him to retreat to Aberdeen and, leaving his wife as commissioner of his estates, he took ship for France in October. He returned to Airlie in 1572, but was shortly after arrested and warded in Linlithgow Palace. In May 1576 he was transferred to Glasgow and in February 1577, through the solicitation of various noblemen, to St Andrews. On his way to Fife he halted in Edinburgh to speak with Morton, who surprisingly expressed his respect for the queen. He was finally released on 14 March 1578, when James VI first asserted his personal authority, and at the Stirling convention was briefly admitted to the privy council; but when Morton recovered control of government Ogilvy retired to Bolshan Castle. He attended the October 1579 parliament which extended the pacification of Perth to many former Marians but unexpectedly forfeited the Hamiltons.<br>
<br>Morton fell irrevocably from power at the end of 1580 and Ogilvy gave his support to the new government of the duke of Lennox. The kirk had voiced suspicions as to his Catholic leanings, and to dispel these doubts he subscribed the negative confession in January 1581. He joined the privy council in March and sat on the assize which condemned Morton for Darnley's murder in June. The Ruthven raid of August 1582 brought down Lennox and for its duration removed Ogilvy from participation in government. In 1585 he was called before the council to answer for reiving the property of Patrick Wood of Bonnyton. He was also closely associated with the Catholic conspiracies of King James's early reign and was known to shelter Jesuit missionaries in his houses, while his son Sir John of Craig was vigorously pursued by the government for much of his life for his persistent support of the Jesuit missions. Ogilvy nevertheless continued to enjoy royal favour, and in June 1596 was appointed with the bishop of Dunkeld as an ambassador to attend the coronation of Christian IV of Denmark, returning in September with rich rewards.<br>
<br>Between 1557 and 1560 Lord Ogilvy had purchased the lands of Forter from the abbot of Coupar Angus, displacing the MacKerrows to install his own kinsmen on the lands and building Forter Castle to control the passes. This expansion north into Glenisla brought the Ogilvys into conflict with Campbells settled on the old abbey lands and with the earls of Atholl who disputed the lordship. Ogilvy had acquired a feu of the lands and castle of Farnell from the sixth earl of Argyll and bishop of Brechin in 1574, but failed to meet payment, and when the young seventh earl raised an action to recover the same in July 1590 relations between the families worsened, reaching a bloody conclusion when the master of Ogilvy and his brothers murdered four Campbells in Glenisla on 18 August 1591. The Campbells retaliated days later, bringing down over 3000 men in a brutal raid on Ogilvy lands, killing indiscriminately and forcing Lord Ogilvy and his family to flee Forter Castle. Argyll was ordered to withdraw his clansmen, but the Campbells remained on the hills, to raid Glenisla and Glen Cova again in September. Later in the month Lord Ogilvy and the earl of Crawford captured and summarily executed at Perth two MacGregors who had participated in the raids, infuriating Argyll and Atholl, whose protection the MacGregors claimed. Lord Ogilvy was unsuccessful in seeking redress for the raids before the council, the king choosing to reconcile the affair through arbitration. In February 1599 Ogilvy was summoned with the sixth earl of Atholl to appear before council to resolve their feud, but both men proved reluctant to compear, the master appearing for his father on 19 April, while Atholl sent no representation.<br>
<br>In the later years of his life Ogilvy, who enjoyed good relations with his nephew Crawford, sought to avoid a resurgence of his family's old feud with the Lindsays, but was unable to restrain his sons. In March 1600 the master and some of his brothers attacked Alexander Lindsay, Lord Spynie, on the road between Kinblethmont and Gardyne, wounding his head and killing Patrick, son of William Rynd of Carse. All parties were required to find caution and Lord Ogilvy was ordered to ward himself in Arbroath. None the less his son David was fatally stabbed by David Lindsay, an illegitimate son of the earl of Crawford, as he made his way to his lodgings in Edinburgh's Canongate on 13 July 1602, while the master continued to pursue his feud with Spynie, blowing off the gate of Kinblethmont Castle to sack it during a night raid on 30 January 1603. Lord Ogilvy died at Farnell Castle in October 1606 and was buried with Catholic rites in the aisle of Kinnell church.<br>
