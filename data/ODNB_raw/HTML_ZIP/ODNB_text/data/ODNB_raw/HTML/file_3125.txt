<span class="headword">Boyle,  David</span>, Lord Shewalton  (1772&#150;1853), <span class="occ">advocate</span>, was born on 26 July 1772 at Irvine, Ayrshire, the fourth son of Patrick Boyle (1717&#150;1798), of Shewalton, army chaplain and landowner, and of his second wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1832), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8271/', "Alexander Dunlop (1684&#150;1747)")</script>, professor of Greek at the University of Glasgow; Patrick Boyle was the third son of John, second earl of Glasgow. Boyle was educated at the University of St Andrews from 1787 to 1789 and then at the University of Glasgow, where he studied law with John Millar, the whig pupil of Adam Smith and in his day the most famous teacher of law in Britain. Boyle was called to the Scottish bar on 14 December 1793. His abilities and connections impressed Lord Melville, political manager of Scotland, on whose recommendation he became solicitor-general for Scotland in May 1807, in the duke of Portland's administration. In the general election of the following month he became MP for Ayrshire, which he continued to represent until his appointment on 23 February 1811 to the court of session as Lord Boyle. He was appointed lord justice clerk on 15 October 1811. He was sworn on 11 April 1820 a member of the privy council. In 1837, on succeeding to the estate of his elder brother, he changed his judicial title to Lord Shewalton.<br>
<br>Boyle practised as an advocate and gained a good reputation. He increased his political value by dynastic marriage, on 24 December 1804, to an heiress from the landed gentry of his native county, Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Alexander Montgomerie of Annick, brother of the twelfth earl of Eglintoun; she died on 14 April 1822. They had six sons and five daughters. Boyle married secondly, on 17 July 1827, Camilla Catherine, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25962/', "David Smythe of Methven")</script>, Lord Methven, a Scottish judge. She died on 25 December 1880, leaving three sons and one daughter. One of Boyle's daughters by his first marriage, Helen, married the advocate and philanthropist Sir Charles Dalrymple Fergusson, fifth baronet, and was mother to the colonial governor Sir James Fergusson. Boyle's sons by his second marriage included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32013/', "George David Boyle")</script>, who became dean of Salisbury in 1880.<br>
<br>After acting as lord justice clerk for nearly thirty years, Boyle was appointed lord justice-general and president of the court of session, on the resignation of Charles Hope, Lord Granton. Boyle resigned office on 5 May 1852, declining the baronetcy which was offered to him. He died at Shewalton on 4 February 1853 and was buried at Dundonald, Ayrshire, on 11 February.<br>
