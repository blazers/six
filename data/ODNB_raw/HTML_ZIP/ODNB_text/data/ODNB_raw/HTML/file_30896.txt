<span class="headword">Camps,  Francis Edward</span>  (1905&#150;1972), <span class="occ">forensic scientist</span>, was born on 28 June 1905 at Teddington, Middlesex, the eldest of the three sons of Percy William Leopold Camps (1878&#150;1956), a general practitioner and surgeon, and his wife, Alice, daughter of Joseph Redfern, of Matlock. He was educated at Marlborough College, Guy's Hospital, the School of Tropical Medicine at Liverpool, and Neuch&acirc;tel University, Switzerland. He qualified MRCS LRCP (1928), graduated MB BS (London, 1930) and MD (1933), received the diploma in tropical medicine and hygiene (Liverpool, 1931), and was elected FRCPath (1964) and FRCP (1968).<br>
<br>After qualifying in medicine in 1928 Camps practised first as a house physician at Guy's Hospital and then as a junior partner in general practice in rural Essex. In 1935 he abandoned clinical medicine and became a pathologist at the Chelmsford and Essex Hospital, specializing in bacteriology and epidemiology. There the Essex coroners sought his help in improving the standard of post-mortem reports, and he became increasingly involved with criminal cases. It was not, however, until after the Second World War that Camps turned to forensic medicine as a full-time career. He started lecturing at the London Hospital medical college in 1945, being appointed lecturer in 1953, reader in 1954, and professor in 1963. On his retirement in 1970 he became emeritus professor, having established the department as a leader in its field. Apart from lecturing to undergraduates and postgraduates at the London Hospital, Camps lectured in forensic medicine at the medical schools of the Royal Free Hospital, the Middlesex Hospital, and University College Hospital. He examined in the medical faculties of five British universities, and played a large part in persuading the Society of Apothecaries to set up the diploma in medical jurisprudence. He was consultant pathologist to the Emergency Medical Service during the war, holder of a travelling fellowship of the Kellogg Foundation, and honorary consultant in forensic medicine to the army (1964&#150;70), an appointment he particularly valued.<br>
<br>Camps was tireless in his enthusiasm and advocacy for his subject and served on many committees, including the British Medical Association special committee on the recognition of intoxication in the relation of alcohol to road accidents (1951), the coroners' rules committee of the Home Office (1953), the mortuaries' committee of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government (1955), and the Home Office Scientific Advisory Council (1965). He was a founder of the British Association in Forensic Medicine in 1950, and was its president in 1958&#150;60. He was the moving force behind the formation of the British Academy of Forensic Sciences in 1959, and served as its president (1963) and secretary-general (1960&#150;71). He edited its journal, <span class="italic">Medicine, Science and the Law</span>, from 1960 until his death, at which time he was president of the Society for the Study of Addiction and vice-president of the Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths.<br>
<br>Camps married three times. His first wife, Dulcie Williams, was a nurse whom he met when working at Guy's Hospital. They had a son and two daughters, but later divorced. In 1942 he married Mary Ross Mackenzie MD, a pathologist and daughter of James Ross Mackenzie, lecturer in anaesthesia at Aberdeen. They had a son and a daughter. She died in 1970, and two years later Camps married Ann Elizabeth Robinson PhD FRIC, a toxicologist at the London Hospital. Camps held strong views, sometimes in opposition to his colleagues, and had exceptional stamina. He worked hard in the mortuary, laboratory, and court, and also as a lecturer, writer, and broadcaster; he rarely refused a case or an invitation to speak. He published several books, many of which are landmarks in forensic medicine; as editor of the second edition of <span class="italic">Gradwohl's Legal Medicine</span> (1968), he won the Swiney prize in 1969. He travelled widely, being particularly concerned to advance his subject in other countries, and was well known in the United States.<br>
<br>Of the large number of important cases in which Camps was involved, perhaps the best-known were those of Hume, Christie, and Emmett Dunne. He was deeply interested in Jack the Ripper. As a person, Camps was impressive but modest, enthusiastic and charming. He was popular with students, and they with him. Outside his work, his interests included fishing and gardening. He was a delightful host or guest, having a rich sense of humour, and also a loyal, devoted friend, and a stimulating colleague and teacher.<br>
<br>A heavy smoker, Camps was convinced that he had inoperable cancer, when he died of a ruptured gastric ulcer at the Chelmsford and Essex Hospital on 8 July 1972. His wife survived him. A memorial service was held in the parish church of St Augustine with St Philip, Stepney Way, London.<br>
