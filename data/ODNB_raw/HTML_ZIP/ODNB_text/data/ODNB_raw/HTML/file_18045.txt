<span class="headword">Margaret</span> <span class="st"> [Margaret of England]</span>  (1240&#150;1275), <span class="occ">queen of Scots, consort of Alexander III</span>, was the eldest daughter and second child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12950/', "Henry III of England (1207&#150;1272)")</script> and his queen, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8620/', "Eleanor of Provence (c.1223&#150;1291)")</script>. She was born at Windsor in October 1240, about the 5th, although the date of her birth is given erroneously by several chroniclers. The early years of her life were passed there along with her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8517/', "Edward")</script>, who was a year older, and the daughter of the earl of Lincoln. Her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8504/', "Edmund")</script> was born in 1245. Green's account claims that she was named Margaret after her aunt, Queen Margaret of France, and, quoting Matthew Paris, because her mother in the pangs of childbirth had invoked the aid of St Margaret (of Antioch). On 27 November that year a royal writ ordered the payment of 10 marks to her custodians, Bartholomew Peche and Geoffrey de Caux.<br>
<br>In 1243&#150;4 there was an outburst of hostilities between Henry III and Alexander II, king of Scots, but the treaty of Newcastle on 13 August 1244 restored peace between England and Scotland, and arranged that the marriage of Margaret and Alexander (1241&#150;1286), the infant son of Alexander II, should take place when the children were old enough. In 1249 the death of Alexander II made Margaret's betrothed husband <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/323/', "Alexander III of Scotland")</script>. The instability of the Scottish government in the period of minority made it expedient for both countries to effect the marriage sooner rather than later, and on 26 December 1251 Alexander and Margaret were married at York by Archbishop Walter de Gray of York (<i>d</i>. 1255). There had been elaborate preparations for the wedding, which Paris states was attended by 1000 English and 600 Scottish knights, and so vast a throng of people that the ceremony was performed secretly and in the early morning to avoid the crowd. Enormous sums were lavished on the entertainments and large quantities of food were consumed. Next day Henry III bound himself to pay Alexander 5000 marks as the marriage portion of his daughter. Around the time of the marriage Henry was involved in the replacement of the Scottish government, which had been led since 1249 by the noble faction headed by the Durward family. Their rivals, the Comyns, were installed as the main force in government.<br>
<br>The first years of Margaret's residence in Scotland seem to have been solitary and unhappy. She was put under the charge of Robert le Norrey, Stephen Bauzan (<i>d</i>. 1257), and the widowed Matilda de Cantilupe. Paris, the fullest source for details of Margaret's life, names Robert de Ros (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1270) and John de Balliol as her principal guardians. Geoffrey of Langley (<i>d</i>. 1274) was also sent to Scotland by Henry III, but Paris states that he returned to England because of Scottish objections to him. In 1253 Henry III requested that Margaret should be allowed to visit her (pregnant) mother in England, but the request came to nothing. She was dissatisfied with her treatment in Scotland, and seems to have complained bitterly. Paris uses the issue as an excuse for anti-Scottish venom. He states that in 1255 Queen Eleanor sent a famous physician, Reginald of Bath, to enquire into Margaret's health and condition. Finding the queen pale and agitated, and full of complaints against her guardians, Reginald indiscreetly expressed his indignation in public, and soon afterwards died suddenly, apparently of poison. King Henry sent Richard de Clare, earl of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1262), and John Mansel (<i>d</i>. 1265) to act as his agents in assisting another coup in Scotland. Margaret and Alexander III were taken from Edinburgh to Roxburgh, while Henry III and Eleanor were now at Wark. The two royal couples met in both places, and Margaret remained a short time with her mother at Wark. A new settlement of the Scottish government was effected: Ros and Balliol were deprived of their estates and the Durward faction was once again installed as the primary force in the administration.<br>
<br>Early in 1256 Margaret received a visit from her brother Edward. In August of the same year she and Alexander went to England. They attended the festivities of the feast of the Assumption on the 15th at Woodstock and, thence proceeding to London, were sumptuously entertained by John Mansel. Shortly thereafter, however, there was more political upheaval in Scotland, culminating in the couple's capture by the Comyn faction in October 1257. By 1260 Alexander III had gained personal control of the Scottish government, and in that year he and Margaret again visited England. Alexander returned to Scotland before the end of the year, leaving Margaret to celebrate Christmas at Windsor, where on 28 February 1261 she gave birth to her first child, Margaret. Three years later her eldest son, Alexander, was born on 21 December 1264 at Jedburgh. A second son, named David, was born in 1270.<br>
<br>Margaret and Alexander III met her brother Edward at Roxburgh early in 1267 and in 1268 they again attended Henry III's court. According to the Lanercost chronicle, she was very anxious for Edward's safety during his absence on crusade, and deeply lamented her father's death in 1272. On 19 August 1274 she and her husband attended Edward I's coronation at Westminster. Margaret died at Cupar Castle on 27 February 1275 and was buried at Dunfermline Abbey. The so-called chronicler of Lanercost (really a Franciscan of Carlisle), who claims to have had his information from her confessor, speaks of her in the warmest terms. &#145;She was a lady&#146;, he says, &#145;of great beauty, chastity, and humility&#151;three qualities which are rarely found together in the same person&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronicon de Lanercost</span>, 97). She was a good friend of the friars, and on her deathbed received the last sacraments from her confessor, a Franciscan, while she refused to admit into her chamber the great bishops and abbots.<br>
