<span class="headword">Pride,  Thomas</span>, appointed Lord Pride under the protectorate  (<em>d.</em> 1658), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and regicide</span>, was the son of William Pride, yeoman of Pedwell Manor, in the parish of Ashcot, Somerset. On 30 January 1622 he was apprenticed to Thomas Bradway, citizen and haberdasher of London, for seven years. He was duly made free of the company on 24 April 1629, and less than four months later married Elizabeth, daughter of the ironmonger Robert Tomson of St Botolph, London. Rather than practise as a haberdasher, however, he took up the lucrative trade of brewing. His business prospered, so that by the 1640s he owned, in partnership with a Maior Yates, two profitable brewhouses in Surrey, and possibly a third in Edinburgh. In August 1647 he affixed his name prominently to a petition of seventy-six brewers to the House of Lords demanding the elimination of the excise tax on beer and ale, on the grounds that they were &#145;the cheapest food, and cheifest nourishment&#146; of the poor; that the price of malt had reached &#145;extraordinarie&#146; heights, and that the brewers faced &#145;utter ruine and destruction&#146; if they continued to be taxed on their product  (Parl. Arch., main papers, 24 Aug 1647). The Lords turned a deaf ear to these entreaties.<h2>
<a name="NewModelofficer"></a>New Model officer</h2>When war broke out between king and parliament, Pride contributed &#145;one browne horse with three whyte feete&#146;, along with its rider and equipage, to the parliamentary war effort  (TNA: PRO, SP 28/131, pt. 3, fol. 1). As a member of the Society of the Artillery Garden he enlisted with the rank of ensign in the Red regiment of London trained bands. By September 1642 he had been given a captaincy in the new regiment of Colonel Henry Barclay in the earl of Essex's army. In December 1643 he rose to the rank of major in the Orange auxiliaries and later in Essex's infantry when it was forced to surrender at Lostwithiel in Cornwall. In March 1645, at the foundation of the New Model Army, the House of Lords attempted to alter Sir Thomas Fairfax's proposed list of officers by demoting the radical Major Cowell to captain, and restoring Pride to the rank of major in Barclay's regiment. The Lords' attempt failed; Cowell stayed a major, but Pride none the less soon found himself lieutenant-colonel of the regiment, now under Colonel Edward Harley. Since Harley was absent during the 1645 campaign, Pride was the effective commander of the regiment. At Naseby he played a critical role as leader of one of the three infantry regiments that were held in reserve behind the front line. The king's infantry rolled back their New Model counterparts until they fell behind the reserves. Major-General Philip Skippon had already been gravely wounded; however, thanks to Pride, Hammond, and Rainborowe the reserves did not panic but halted the royalist advance, and helped to save the day for parliament. Pride also distinguished himself at the storming of Bristol, where his regiment was among the first to scale the city walls, and also at the storm of Dartmouth, when his men were the first to enter the town from the north.<br>
<br>When the New Model Army revolted against parliament's attempt to disband it without its arrears in the spring of 1647, Pride was one of the officers most militant in asserting the right of soldiers to petition for redress of their grievances. He drew his regiment to a rendezvous, had the soldiers' petition read at the head of the regiment, threatened a fellow officer that any who declined to sign the soldiers' petition &#145;should be blotted out of the rolls and excluded and counted as no members of the army&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 1.418), and extracted 1100 signatures (virtually the whole regiment). His conservative presbyterian colonel, Edward Harley, complained of his activities in parliament, and Pride was summoned to the bar of the House of Commons to explain his conduct. Undeterred and defiant, he next took part in a high-level delegation that laid a <span class="italic">Petition and Vindication of the Officers</span> before the House of Commons on 27 April. In July he also helped draft the New Model's articles of impeachment against the eleven members who were viewed as its mortal enemies in the House of Commons. When one-quarter of the officers withdrew from the army out of loyalty to parliament Pride replaced Harley as colonel.<h2>
<a name="PridesPurge"></a>Pride's Purge</h2>In the second civil war Pride served under Cromwell in the Welsh campaign, his regiment fighting &#145;desperately&#146; at Chepstow  (Rushworth, 6.1118). He was also at the battle of Preston, where his regiment played a secondary role. In late September he was at the Scottish border, blocking up Tweedmouth and blowing up the guard house that the royalists had built on the bridge. His regiment joined with Richard Deane's and Thomas Harrison's to present a petition demanding that parliament should proceed against the king &#145;as an enemy to the kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">Severall Petitions Presented to his Excellency the Lord Fairfax</span>, 1648, 8). It was also part of the 7000&#150;strong force that occupied London at the beginning of December 1648. Although David Underdown has questioned whether Pride was &#145;anything more than the obedient instrument of a policy dictated by others&#146;  (Underdown, 141), he was quite possibly a member of the subcommittee of six officers and MPs who, on the night of 5 December, made the arrangements for the purging of the House of Commons of its conservative or presbyterian members. There is no doubt about his enthusiasm for the policy concerted by Ireton and others, for it was Pride who on the morning of the 6th set a guard around the house. He then stood on the stairs leading to the entrance, flourishing his list of members to be secured. Presently Thomas, Lord Grey of Groby arrived to help him with identifications. About forty-five members were arrested and four times that number were secluded or stayed away. Pride carried out the political cleansing with courtesy except in the case of the lawyer William Prynne. The cantankerous member for Newport tried to force his way past, but Pride with the help of his soldiers pushed him down the stairs and hustled him away to nearby Queen's Court. Prynne is said to have demanded, as he was being carried off, &#145;By what authority and commission, and for what cause, they did thus violently seize on and pull him down from the House&#146;, to which Pride and Sir Hardress Waller pointed to their soldiers with swords drawn, muskets at the ready, and matches alight, answering &#145;there was their commission&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Parliamentary or Constitutional History of England</span>, 18.449). This violence against the House of Commons became known as Pride's Purge. The colonel and his regiment were richly rewarded for their services. Twelve days after the purge the committee of the army ordered that he should be paid &pound;2600 on account for his regiment. During December 1648 and January 1649 warrants totalling &pound;7691 were issued for the pay of his regiment. Hardly any other regiment was as generously treated at the climax of the English revolution  (TNA: PRO, SP 28/57, fols. 350<i>v</i>, 462, SP28/58, fols. 65, 244, 278<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>In January, Pride was appointed to the high court of justice that was created to try Charles I for treason against the people of England. He attended all but two of the planning meetings of the court in the painted chamber, as well as every one of the four public sessions of the court in Westminster Hall, and signed the death warrant [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. Beside his signature he affixed a seal bearing the impress of a chevron inter three animals' heads erased. His regiment was stationed in London for the rest of the year as a guard for parliament, while Pride himself was elected to the London common council in December.<h2>
<a name="Londonandnationalpolitics"></a>London and national politics</h2>Pride's election to the common council foreshadowed an intense involvement in local politics which lasted for the better part of a decade. A member of John Duppa's separatist church, he had a dense network of personal contacts within the City. In late 1652 he was implicated in a scheme for the overthrow of the oligarchy which controlled the Saddlers' Company, and in another to replace Prideaux's lucrative postal system by a cheaper and more frequent service. In 1653 he was appointed to the committee to look into the Savoy Hospital and Ely House to ensure &#145;that only such men may be admitted as are proved to be deserving of relief&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1652&#150;3</i>, 363). In the same year he was one of a group of sequestrators who petitioned for a prolongation of their powers, and for a cure to be provided for St Bartholomew-the-Less. In 1656 he was one of three army officers who were asked by the council of state to examine a petition from sick and maimed soldiers in the Savoy. Finally, he got himself named a governor of St Bartholomew's Hospital, and attended several of their meetings. In 1655&#150;6 he was high sheriff of Surrey, and a commissioner for securing the peace of London, in which posts he continued his campaign, dating back to 1653, for the suppression of cock-fighting, bear- and bull-baiting, and &#145;playing for prizes by fencers&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1652&#150;3</i>, 306) in Southwark. After the Restoration he became a figure of fun to royalist wits, who mocked his hostility to these popular entertainments.<br>
<br>From his political base in London, Pride also involved himself in national issues. In August 1649 he presented on behalf of the army's council of officers a petition to parliament calling for the repeal of all statutes and ordinances &#145;whereby many consciencious people are molested, and the propagation of the gospel hindered&#146;, the suppression of &#145;open acts of prophaneness, as drunkenness, swearing, and uncleanness&#146;, the release of political prisoners, and the reform of the law  (<span class="italic">Kingdomes Faithfull and Impartial Scout</span>, 10&#150;17 Aug 1649, 224). Two months later the council of officers, wary of the continuing threat from the religious and Leveller left, decided to meet once a week to work out plans for law reform and the abolition of tithes. Again Pride was prominent in the radical agitation on these questions. Indeed, he stood at the Commons door on 26 December 1651 during the debate on law reform as a mute reminder to MPs of the fate they might expect if they failed to implement desired changes. The vehemence of his feeling towards the legal profession is further reflected in a comment he is reported to have made in Westminster Hall in 1652 &#145;that it would never be well with England until &hellip; mercenary lawyers' gownes were hung up by the Scotch-trophies&#146;  (N. Burt, <span class="italic">A New Yeers Gift for England</span>, 1653, 15).<h2>
<a name="Theprofitsofrevolution"></a>The profits of revolution</h2>Satisfaction for the state's financial creditors was another issue in which Pride took a keen interest. As a revolutionary insider he had had no difficulty obtaining redemption of his own debts. In December 1647 he had received &pound;100 towards his arrears of pay, while in 1652 he used his arrears debentures totalling &pound;1418, as well as debentures purchased from the men of his own regiment, to acquire Nonesuch Great Park (also known as Worcester Park) in Surrey for &pound;11,591. In May 1652 parliament further rewarded him with a grant of forfeited Scottish lands worth &pound;500 per annum. He was briefly associated with Samuel Chidley in the latter's agitation for payment of the state's creditors. However, when Chidley, in December 1652, attempted to claim Pride's support for his petition against the Rump's requirement that holders of public faith bills should &#145;double&#146; (advance the same amount again in cash) in order to be paid off, the colonel issued an angry disclaimer, and the two went their separate ways.<br>
<br>Pride sought profit from the revolution in another way. In November 1650 he and several business associates signed a lucrative contract with the navy commissioners to provide &#145;good, sweet, wholesome and serviceable provisions&#146; to the fleet  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. A.216, pp. 261&#150;2). They were to victual it at sea and in harbour at the ports of London, Dover, Harwich, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Liverpool, and Chatham, as well as Leith (Scotland) and Kinsale (Ireland). In July 1653, however, there was &#145;great complaint of victuals, especially of beer and water&#146;. Pride was forced to condemn the beer on two ships and &#145;promise a better supply&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom., 1653&#150;4</span>, 9). Before that could be procured, &pound;1600 worth of his own beer had been dumped overboard as undrinkable. He and the other victuallers now wanted out of the contract, and petitioned the lord protector to that effect. Cromwell did not yield to their request until October 1654, yet for some reason the navy commissioners extended the contract to August 1655.<br>
<br>Pride also begged to be forgiven his arrears of excise, dating from the years 1643 to 1645, when he was &#145;absent in the army&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1654</i>, 426), and amounting to &pound;5580. The excise commissioners opposed Pride's petition on account of the precedent it would create for other merchants who were in arrears. Although he was based mainly in London during the 1650s, Pride did see military action. In 1650 he accompanied Cromwell to Scotland, commanded a brigade at Dunbar, and fought the following year at the battle of Worcester.<h2>
<a name="Protectoratepoliticsanddeath"></a>Protectorate politics and death</h2>Pride was elected to only one parliament during the 1650s, that of 1656, and he never served on the council of state. A committed republican, he was reportedly kept in England in 1654 while his regiment was sent to Scotland because the protector distrusted him. Nevertheless, on 17 January 1656 Cromwell knighted him, performing the ceremony with a faggot stick, according to Ludlow. Little over a year later, however, he played a leading part in the agitation among the officers against making Cromwell king. &#145;He shall not&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow</span>, 2.25) was his blunt response to the report that Cromwell was thinking of accepting the crown. He then set about to organize the petition which changed the protector's mind. Yet curiously, after the passing of &#145;The humble petition and advice&#146;, he was pleased to be appointed to Cromwell's other house. &#145;He hath now changed his principles and his mind with the times&#146; was the sour remark of a republican pamphleteer: &#145;the noble lawyers will be glad of his company and friendship, for that there is now no fear of his hanging up their gowns by the Scottish colours in Westminster Hall&#146;  (&#145;A second narrative&#146;, 381). Shortly after the death of Oliver, Pride signed the proclamation of Richard Cromwell as new protector.<br>
<br>Pride died shortly thereafter, on 23 October 1658, and was buried at Nonesuch on 2 November. According to a London newsbook, his last words were &#145;that he was very sorry for these three nations, whom he saw in a most sad and deplorable condition&#146;  (<span class="italic">Weekly Intelligencer</span>, 1&#150;8 Nov 1659, 212). His will confirmed the picture of a convinced puritan, who bequeathed his soul &#145;into the hands of my pretious Redeemer, Lord Jesus Christ, being perswaded by the faith he hath wrought in me, that he will wash it thoroughly from all its defilements and present it to his father and my father as his own purchas&#146;. It also revealed a man who by the end of his life had become wealthy, suspicious, and perhaps quarrelsome. He warned his sons William and Samuel not to practise &#145;fraude, or cousenage&#146; in their stewardship of his major property, Nonesuch Great Park. He named his &#145;faithfull and loveinge wife&#146;, Elizabeth his executrix, but allowed her &#145;no more then foure hundred pounds p. annum&#146; out of the park. He threatened to cut her off from all benefits if she disposed of any part of her interest in his estate. Previously he had settled the manor of Great Stoughton, Huntingdonshire, on his first son, Thomas, as well as half the partnership of his two brewhouses at Kingston, Surrey. His son Joseph was to be paid &pound;4000 from the brewhouses when he reached the age of twenty-one, but if Thomas and the other partner tried to block this bequest, the entire ownership of the brewhouses was to be turned over to Joseph. To his daughter Elizabeth and her husband, Robert, son of Colonel Valentine Wauton, he left only &pound;5 each  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/283, fols. 213<i>v</i>&#150;214<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Pride's estates were confiscated and Nonesuch Great Park was restored to the crown. His carcase, which was voted to be exhumed, drawn to Tyburn, hung up in its coffin, and buried under the gallows, along with those of Cromwell, Ireton, and Bradshaw, seems in the event to have escaped that indignity.<br>
<br>Pride was one of the fearless revolutionaries of the New Model Army who were instrumental in winning the war against the king, bringing him to judgment, and shaping the regime that came after him. No intellectual, he spoke little and wrote even less. But he was a radical puritan who knew his own mind, and did not shrink from imposing his views upon others. Remembered above all for the purge of parliament which bears his name, he also enjoyed a flourishing career as a merchant, in addition to enriching himself from the spoils of revolution.<br>
