<span class="headword">Mogg,  Mary <span class="st"> [Molly]</span></span>  (1698/9&#150;1766), <span class="occ">celebrated beauty</span>, was one of two daughters born to John Mogg (<i>d</i>. 1736), landlord of The Rose inn at Wokingham in Berkshire. Little is known of Molly other than that she worked in her father's tavern and that her exceptional beauty inspired John Gay, in company with Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift, to write a poem about her entitled &#145;Molly Mogg, or, The Fair Maid of the Inn&#146;, which quickly became a popular song. However, even these bare details have been the subject of disagreement.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>, in quoting from the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> for 1859, claims that Molly's sister Sally was in fact the great beauty and the subject of the song. It suggests that Gay and his friends had been too drunk to distinguish between the sisters and that thus the tributes had been paid to Molly erroneously  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 84&#150;5). This version of events is denied in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>: listing Molly among the deaths for 1766 aged sixty-seven (she died a spinster at Wokingham on 7 March), the entry states unequivocally that she was the person about whom Gay had written the song &#145;Molly Mogg&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 36.151). Similarly in the <span class="italic">London Daily Post</span> for 21 October 1736 notice was given that Mr Mogg, who was confirmed as having kept The Rose inn for several years, had died a few days previously. He was described as &#145;Father of Molly Mogg on whom the famous song was made&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 175).<br>
<br>The other area of disagreement concerns authorship and whether the poem was the result of the collaborative efforts of Swift, Gay, and Pope, or written solely by Gay or by Pope. What is not contested is that the poem was probably written in the summer of 1726, a couple of months after Swift had arrived in England to arrange publication of <span class="italic">Gulliver's Travels</span>. It is generally accepted that about this time Pope, Swift, and Gay had gone together to Wokingham and to nearby Binfield, where Pope had lived ten years earlier. It has been suggested that Pope was taking his fellow wits on a nostalgic journey into his past and possibly to meet his old Binfield friends the Doncastles  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 172).<br>
<br>AAA, a contributor to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> for June 1755, claims that Pope had written the original poem, the eleven stanzas of which were reprinted in the issue in French, at the age of seventeen. However, as J. Yeowell notes, when Pope was seventeen, in 1705, Molly Mogg would have been only about six years old  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 173). Other evidence points to Gay as the author, and the poem is generally attributed to him. Vinton Dearing says that Swift referred to &#145;Molly Mogg&#146; as Gay's, and that Gay authorized the printing of the full fifteen stanzas under his own name in the fifth edition of Lintot's <span class="italic">Miscellany</span> (2, 1727, 617). However, Dearing also makes the valuable point that since &#145;Molly Mogg&#146; is a &#145;crambo&#146; poem (one designed to exhaust all possible rhymes on a given name) it was likely to have been a collaborative effort. Indeed when the poem was first published, in <span class="italic">Mist's Weekly Journal</span> on 27 August 1726, authorship was attributed to &#145;Two or Three Men of Wit&#146;. Furthermore the inclusion of stanzas 8 and 13 in the full version of the poem was the result of a challenge thrown down by Incog, in <span class="italic">Mist's Weekly Journal</span> for 20 August 1726, to &#145;furnish another Rhime&#146; on Molly Mogg.<br>
<br>The poem, which had probably been handed about privately before appearing in <span class="italic">Mist's Weekly Journal</span>, enjoyed immense success and soon acquired a couple of tunes to add to its popularity. The full text of fifteen four-line stanzas was printed in Dublin in two broadsides; another version, without stanzas 8 and 13, was reprinted in <span class="italic">The Choice</span> in 1729 and 1732. Another broadside appeared in <span class="italic">Musical Miscellany</span>, <span class="italic">Read's Weekly Journal</span>, and <span class="italic">The Hive</span>. In addition four other broadsides were published between 1726 and 1732 which omitted stanza 13 and arranged the remaining fourteen stanzas into pairs to make seven verses in order to fit them beneath the musical scores of different tunes.<br>
