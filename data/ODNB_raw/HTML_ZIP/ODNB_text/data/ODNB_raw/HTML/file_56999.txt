<span class="headword">Aylmer, Sir  Gerald</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1559), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the younger son of Bartholomew Aylmer of Lyons, co. Kildare, and Margaret Cheevers. There is no record of his legal education, though it is likely that he attended the inns of court since most of his contemporaries on the bench had formal legal training. At an unknown date he married Alison, daughter of Gerald Fitzgerald of Athlone, and his sister married Sir Thomas Luttrell, chief justice of common pleas.<br>
<br>Aylmer was regarded as loyal to the Geraldine lord deputy, the earl of Kildare, when he served as sheriff of Limerick in the earlier 1520s. As a partisan of Kildare, he was made second justice of the court of common pleas on 19 December 1528. He was confirmed in that role on 23 August 1532, yet he was apparently acting as agent for disaffected councillors when he presented a critique of the Geraldine administration at the English court in 1533, along with John Alen. Aylmer was appointed chief baron of the exchequer on 25 June 1534, just before the Kildare rebellion, and when Sir Bartholomew Dillon died unexpectedly after only one year on the bench, Aylmer was named chief justice of king's bench (12 August 1535). Thereafter he was a principal agent of Cromwell and worked closely with John Alen, master of the rolls, in the defeat of the Geraldine revolt. They travelled to England in 1536 to receive the bill for suppression of the Irish monasteries, bringing the legislation to the Reformation Parliament of 1536&#150;7. The act of St Wolstan's, introduced in September 1536 as a special commission of dissolution, assured Aylmer and his fellow chief justice and brother-in-law Thomas Luttrell an annual rent of &pound;4 during the life of Sir Richard Weston, the last prior. Aylmer joined with Alen and others in the comprehensive commission to dissolve Irish monastic houses, gaining profitable estates in Meath. He conducted an inquisition at Limerick of ecclesiastical shrines in 1541, and he obtained the Franciscan friary at Drogheda by patent of 16 February 1543 for the price of &pound;54 17<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. His loyal service to the crown did not, however, conclusively demonstrate his commitment to the protestant faith.<br>
<br>The new lord deputy, Lord Leonard Grey, adopted a pro-Geraldine policy after the Kildare rebellion was quashed in 1536, and the wily Aylmer, along with John Alen, campaigned to undermine Grey's administration. Aylmer attended Sir Anthony St Leger to London in 1538, joining the commission of inquiry to bring charges against the viceroy. Yet he was knighted in 1539 and survived the downfall of both Grey and Cromwell in 1540 to serve under three sovereigns, being reappointed chief justice on 24 March 1547 and on 16 November 1553. In 1541 he was among the leading Irish lawyers who petitioned for a lease of Blackfriars monastery in Dublin to establish there an Irish inn of court. He was named lord justice along with Sir Thomas Cusake on 6 December 1552, an unusual honour for one of his position on the council. However, he was left off the council in 1556 when the new viceroy, Lord Fitzwalter, replaced the minions of his predecessor St Leger. Like most of his contemporaries, Aylmer was also an able military figure who was employed in the field against the Geraldines and the O'Neills, attending the lord deputy in expeditions against the O'Connors (1537) and the Kavanaghs (1538). He was knighted in the field after the battle of Bellahoe in 1539, and given a grant of Dollardstown, Meath. Near the end of his career the aged Aylmer came infrequently to the Irish council and Elizabeth wrote in 1559 that she wished to promote another Old English lawyer, John Plunkett, to the office of chief justice in his place.<br>
<br>Aylmer died in office in 1559, a tenacious survivor from the Cromwellian administration whose support of Lord Deputy St Leger demonstrated the kind of eclectic fidelity required of mid-Tudor administrators. His kinsman and namesake Sir Gerald Aylmer of co. Kildare, perhaps a son, was a leader of opposition to the cess among the pale &eacute;lite in the 1580s.<br>
