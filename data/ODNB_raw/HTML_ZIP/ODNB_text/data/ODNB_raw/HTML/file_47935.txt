<span class="headword">Dunstan,  Albert Ernest</span>  (1878&#150;1964), <span class="occ">research chemist and petroleum technologist</span>, was born on 25 January 1878 at 69 Washington Road, Sheffield, the only son of Arthur Dunstan (<i>d</i>. 1896), a workshop manager, and Mary Ann Wainwright (<i>d</i>. 1897). His father was shop manager for an old-established firm (Edward Greaves &amp; Son) which manufactured cabinet cases and fitted containers for fine cutlery. Dunstan had four sisters, all younger than himself. He was educated in Sheffield, first at Sharrow Lane board school and then, from the age of twelve, at the Royal Grammar School.<br>
<br>In 1895 Dunstan gained a scholarship for intending teachers from the College of Preceptors and for the next two years he combined studies at Firth College with teaching at a preparatory school. Initially a keen classics scholar, he now turned his interest to science, but the death of his parents meant that by 1897 continued education had to yield priority to earning a living. Thus in April 1898 he took up an appointment as junior master at Clifton House School, Eastbourne. In October 1900 he was able to resume his studies, this time at the Royal College of Science in London, and these resulted in a BSc degree. This was followed by a teaching appointment at Dame Alice Owen's School, Islington.<br>
<br>In 1905 Dunstan obtained the post of lecturer in chemistry and physics at the newly built East Ham Technical College and secondary day school. Here he took advantage of good laboratory facilities to explore what was becoming a major interest, namely viscosity. His first paper on the viscosity of liquids had in fact already been published in the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the Chemical Society in 1904. By 1910 he had written several chemistry textbooks and his output of published papers on viscosity had risen to over twenty. In addition, despite his busy teaching schedule at East Ham both during the day and in the evenings, he carried out experimental work on viscosity at University College, London, under Professor Trouton. This led to a DSc in 1910. In 1911 Dunstan married one of his students, Louisa Cleaverley (<i>d</i>. 1963). They had a daughter and a son, Bernard, an artist and member of the Royal Academy.<br>
<br>By early 1913 the refinery at Abadan of the young Anglo-Persian Oil Company (to become Anglo-Iranian Oil in 1937, and British Petroleum in 1954) was in full operation. A prime function of this refinery was to supply fuel oil to the British navy, but it was soon found that the Admiralty fuel oil made from Persian crude could sometimes undergo an increase in viscosity in ships' bunkers. This often meant handling problems under cold weather conditions, as in the North Sea, and was a matter of much concern to the navy, especially following the outbreak of war in 1914. The Admiralty therefore asked their specialist adviser on petroleum matters, Sir Boverton Redwood, for expert assistance in view of his proven knowledge of viscosity phenomena; Dunstan was recommended early in 1915 as the man to tackle the problem. Dunstan took with him Dr F. B. Thole, one of his teaching colleagues, and these two, initially working for the Admiralty, soon officially joined Anglo-Persian, carrying out their investigations in the laboratories at East Ham. They also worked on other interests of Anglo-Persian&#151;for example the refining of motor spirit and kerosene from Persian crude, and the potential manufacture of toluene (for TNT) from petroleum. This latter interest was studied by Dunstan through his activities at a large experimental plant at Thameshaven.<br>
<br>In November 1916 Dunstan was asked by his directors to go out to Persia. He accepted with alacrity, and once there he made a study of refinery operations at Abadan and visited the oilfield at Maidan-i-Naftun. He returned to Britain in April 1917 and reported to Charles Greenway, chairman of Anglo-Persian, that the company possessed a crude oil of vast potentialities, but that little was yet known of its actual composition. The result of this meeting was an instruction to set up a research organization coupled with the offer of the post of research chemist (at a salary of &pound;750 per annum).<br>
<br>A research laboratory was established in September 1917 at Meadhurst, a dilapidated Georgian mansion in Sunbury-on-Thames. This building had a large cellar (initially flooded), which was converted, despite wartime shortages, into a laboratory. Thus was established, with Dunstan and Thole as the only staff, the nucleus of what was later to become the vast Sunbury Research Centre of British Petroleum. In 1919 adjacent land was purchased for the erection of a properly designed new laboratory block complete with workshops, a canteen, and other amenities. Occupation of these new buildings began in 1921, and with the extra space and staff available Dunstan was able adequately to carry out research into the chemistry of crude oil.<br>
<br>One legacy from the war was a shortage of liquid fuels and Dunstan became a chemical adviser to a committee on the production of oil from cannel coal and allied minerals which had been set up by the Institution of Petroleum Technologists (later the Institute of Petroleum) in 1918. In 1921 he visited an experimental plant at Rheinau in Germany, to examine the possibility of producing oil from coal using a high-pressure hydrogenation process developed by Bergius.<br>
<br>During the early 1920s many investigations were in progress at Sunbury, priority being given to processes for the desulphurization of light distillate fractions, one using sodium hypochlorite as the reagent, and the other using selective adsorption over bauxite. These processes were successfully brought into operation during 1921 and 1922 at Abadan and at the company's new refinery at Llandarcy, near Swansea. Many other petroleum products such as fuel oil, lubricating oil, diesel oil, and aviation spirit were investigated by Dunstan and his team, and the decisions concerning which projects to work on were largely taken by Dunstan himself, without interference from head office. Dunstan also developed an intense interest in cracking processes, and was sent to Detroit in 1922 to study an American cracking process (Ramage process). This became the start of a long programme of work on cracking reactions at Sunbury, which by 1924 had led to the development of a new cracking process, the &#145;A-D-H&#146; process, named after the individuals concerned, Auld, Dunstan, and Herring.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1924 Dunstan was transferred to head office in London as chief chemist of the company, with overall responsibility for laboratory matters not only at Sunbury but also in the Persian oilfield, and at the Abadan and Llandarcy refineries. He was already a member of the Institution of Petroleum Technologists, and indeed had been elected in 1919 to its council, on which he remained until 1958&#151;a record period. He became vice-president of the institution for the period 1928&#150;9, and president for the sessions 1929&#150;30 and 1930&#150;31. He was also honorary editor of its publications, a duty which he undertook for twenty-five years. In 1938 he was awarded the institute's Redwood medal for his outstanding services to petroleum technology.<br>
<br>Over the years Dunstan participated with similar energy in the affairs of many other learned societies, and his offices included being the chairman of the education committee of the Royal Institute of Chemistry, a member of council of the Chemical Society and of the Society of Chemical Industry, treasurer of the Chemical Council, a member of council of the Institute of Fuel, a member of the Faraday Society, president of the British Association of Chemists, and a member of the parliamentary and scientific committee of the House of Commons. He was also associated with various government departmental committees: he was a member of the fuel efficiency committee and chaired both the liquid fuel committee and the creosote-pitch committee of the Ministry of Fuel and Power; he was a member of the Home Office committee on smoke screens and of the mixtures committee of the petroleum warfare department; he was a board member of HM fuel research station; and he was a general council member of the British Standards Institution. Furthermore he maintained close contact with many universities.<br>
<br>Dunstan travelled widely, on company business, on lecture tours, and to attend international conferences such as the World Power Conference in Berlin in 1930 and the World Petroleum Congress in London in 1933 (for which he was a convenor of papers). He had many valuable friends among outstanding petroleum technologists in America, and in 1929 the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) elected him chairman of the ASTM committee for testing petroleum and its products&#151;a tribute to his continuing efforts to promote co-operation between the ASTM and the Institute of Petroleum in developing standardized test procedures for use on both sides of the Atlantic. In all such activities Dunstan assumed the role of unofficial ambassador not only for his company but also for the petroleum industry as a whole, both nationally and internationally. His drive, enthusiasm, and breezy, extrovert manner endeared him to all he met.<br>
<br>Dunstan retired from Anglo-Iranian Oil at the end of 1946 with some 35 patents to his name and over 120 technical papers, as well as several textbooks. Perhaps his greatest achievement in regard to publications was as managing editor for the four massive volumes of <span class="italic">The Science of Petroleum</span>, published in 1938 and followed by three parts of a fifth volume during the period 1950&#150;55. He spent his latter years in a house in Cambridge. His wife died in 1963, and he died in the following year, on 6 January 1964, at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge. On 22 September 1965 a new four-storey laboratory block housing 130 staff was formally opened at the Sunbury Research Centre. This new building was named the Dunstan Laboratory, a fitting memorial to the man who had made it all possible.<br>
