<span class="headword">Knight, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1718), <span class="occ">merchant and politician</span>, was the elder son of <a name="cosubject_15725"></a><span class="headword">John Knight</span>  (1616?&#150;1679) of Bristol, <span class="occ">merchant</span>, and his first wife, a Somerset woman whose maiden name was Parsons. The elder John Knight was the grandson of the effective founder of the family's position within the civic and mercantile worlds of Bristol, Francis Knight (<i>d</i>. 1616), through Francis's second son, Edward. Another of Francis's grandsons, by his eldest son, was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15726/', "Sir John Knight (bap. 1613, d. 1683)")</script>, often known as &#145;the elder&#146;, another prominent figure in Restoration Bristol whose political and business career intertwined with those of his cousin and nephew.<br>
<br>John Knight, the son of Edward Knight and his wife, Martha Challoner, served as apprentice to his merchant father from 1634 to 1641. He based his fortune, however, on East Anglian fenland purchased during the 1640s. His first wife had died and he had remarried by 1651; his second wife was Mary Latch (<i>d</i>. 1681). He returned to Bristol by the early 1650s, where he established a sugar refinery at the Great House, St Augustine's Back, which was supplied by his West Indian plantations. He was warden of the Merchant Venturers three times (1654&#150;5, 1655&#150;6, and 1661&#150;2), and master once (1666&#150;7). In 1664 he was appointed sheriff of Bristol. Unlike his son, he was sympathetic to dissenters and gave them a respite from harassment during his mayoralty of Bristol in 1670&#150;71. His most important foe in this period was his cousin and former business partner, Sir John Knight the elder, with whom he fought numerous lawsuits. In 1675 he gave his fenland and West Indian properties to his younger son, Joseph, while his elder son, John, inherited the Bristol sugar business and lands at Congresbury, Somerset, after his father's death on 29 March 1679, though the will led to legal contests within the family.<br>
<br>The younger John Knight spent several years representing his father's interests in the West Indies, apparently living in Montserrat. He had returned to Bristol by the early 1670s and married Anne Smith, daughter of Thomas Smith of Long Ashton, Somerset; they had one son and two daughters. In June 1674 he was elected to Bristol's common council, though for a while he refused to serve. In November 1675 he joined the Merchant Venturers of Bristol, but it was not until September 1679 that he accepted election to the city's common council. The younger Knight's father had died six months earlier, which henceforth makes it easier to discern which of that name was performing increasingly prominent functions for the Merchant Venturers and the city corporation. He now became a warden of the Merchant Venturers and in September 1681 was made one of the city's two sheriffs for the year following.<br>
<br>The shrievalty provided Knight with his first major opportunity to exercise leadership, which he did by directing the persecution of protestant dissenters. He quickly came into regular contact with officers of the royal court and convinced them of his zeal for the king's interests. Knight was also one of those leading an attack on Sir Robert Atkyns, the city's recorder and a justice of common pleas recently dismissed for his opposition to the royal court. Knight's campaign to close conventicles and harass dissenters became so extreme that he soon spurred a vigorous opposition within the corporation, which became seriously divided. Despite the conflict in Bristol, Knight was presented to the king at Newmarket in March 1682, where he was knighted. In these years it thus becomes easy to confuse Knight with his uncle, Sir John Knight the elder. This senior Sir John, though also a prominent foe of conventicles, as evidenced by his actions as mayor in 1663&#150;4, opposed his namesake until his death in late 1683. The junior Sir John was sometimes known as &#145;the younger&#146; or &#145;of The Hill&#146;, after his place of residence in St Michael's parish.<br>
<br>In December 1682 Knight and others wrote to the government recommending the dismissal of four aldermen who allegedly stirred trouble in the corporation. From this arose the suggestion that Bristol, like other corporations in this period, be served with an information in the nature of <i>quo warranto</i> to compel them to surrender their charter, thus permitting the issue of a new charter to install Knight's &#145;loyal&#146; partisans firmly in power. Knight managed the surrender process, keeping Secretary of State Sir Leoline Jenkins informed about shifting local political alignments. Although he expected a favourable outcome, Knight misjudged the situation and failed to convince a majority of the corporation to vote to surrender the charter in March 1683. By now many in the corporation, even his allies, had become suspicious of what a new charter might do to increase Knight's power. But legal process against the city moved forward until a charter surrender was at last obtained in early 1684.<br>
<br>Knight now looked to Whitehall for greater preferment in return for his services, and put himself forward to be governor of the Leeward Islands. Some in England supported his nomination, but many islanders remembered Knight's &#145;rude behaviour and insolence&#146;  (Latimer, 423) while he lived there and petitioned against his appointment, effectively ending his ambitions. Surprisingly, Knight requested the king's permission to resign from Bristol's council in July 1684, only one month after he had gained the city's new charter. Throughout this period, despite his divisive political efforts, Knight was frequently called upon to use his influence to represent Bristol's mercantile interests at court. Hoping to build on this influence, Knight stood unsuccessfully at a parliamentary by-election in December 1685.<br>
<br>By this time Knight's worries were shifting from protestant dissenters to Catholics, whose interests King James now promoted. In April 1686 Knight reported a Catholic meeting to the mayor and sheriffs, and they arrested a priest and others. News soon arrived at court of Knight's aggressive manner toward Catholics and other citizens in this and other incidents. By late May the &#145;violent tory in Bristol&#146;  (Luttrell, 1.379) had been arrested and brought before the privy council to explain his actions, for which he was now imprisoned. A writ of habeas corpus failed to gain his release, but when tried by a jury in Bristol in November, Knight was acquitted.<br>
<br>Knight rejoined the common council upon the restoration of Bristol's pre-1684 corporation in October 1688. Elected to represent Bristol in the convention of 1689, Knight soon became known as one of those who disagreed that King James's departure had made the throne vacant and thus as one who opposed making William and Mary monarchs. Knight was returned to parliament in 1690; he was elected mayor of Bristol later that year. At Westminster Knight worked to protect Bristol's trading interests in Africa and elsewhere, but he earned greatest fame for his popular attack on foreigners in the debate on a <span class="roman">Naturalization Bill</span>. His speech questioned the loyalty and integrity of the measure's supporters; he concluded by moving that &#145;let us first kick the bill out of the House, and then foreigners out of the kingdom&#146;  (Knight, 8). The Commons voted to condemn the speech in its published form and it was burnt by the hangman, though not before Knight had denied all knowledge of how it appeared in print. Knight was in contact with the exiled Jacobite court in these years. After the assassination plot of 1696 Knight was detained on suspicion of his Jacobitism, though he was released for lack of evidence. Knight did not stand for parliament in 1695; when he did so in 1698, he failed to regain his seat.<br>
<br>In 1702 Knight resigned from Bristol's common council once again and later retired to the small estate at Congresbury that he had inherited from his father. He died in apparent poverty in February 1718.<br>
