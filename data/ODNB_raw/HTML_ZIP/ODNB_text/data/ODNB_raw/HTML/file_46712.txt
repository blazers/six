<span class="headword">Cruchley,  George Frederick</span>  (1796/7&#150;1880), <span class="occ">map publisher</span>, was born in London. He may have been the George Frederick Crutchley, son of John Crutchley and his wife, Ann, who was born on 1 April 1797 and baptized at St Clement Danes on 23 April 1797. Nothing more is known of his parentage or early life save that he described himself in his early days as &#145;from Arrowsmith's&#146;, having presumably been apprenticed to the celebrated Aaron Arrowsmith, the elder. In 1823 Cruchley established his own firm at 349 Oxford Street, London. In 1825 it moved to 38 Ludgate Street and in 1833 to 81 Fleet Street where it remained until its dissolution in 1877. He married, probably in the late 1820s, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hume, with whom he had at least four daughters.<br>
<br>Initially Cruchley concentrated on publishing clear, attractive plans of London which he promoted energetically. Many were republished many times, with revisions and extensions, in varying formats, sometimes with additional information, notably about railways and postal districts. From 1826 he created a fine series of London plans which was represented at the Great Exhibition of 1851. Their popularity is shown by their frequent re-edition and longevity. His maps of London's environs, such as <span class="italic">Cruchley's Environs of London Extending Thirty Miles from the Metropolis</span> (issued from 1824), were superior in some respects to the Ordnance Survey's one-inch sheets: for example in differentiating grades of roads and footpaths; noting distances from London; listing fairs, markets, and watermen's fares; and by their more frequent revision. He was one of the last major map publishers to undertake private estate mapping, but no examples of his estate maps are known to survive. The quality of his work resulted in his being commissioned from the late 1820s to engrave plans for official reports on railway proposals.<br>
<br>From the mid-1830s, however, Cruchley progressively abandoned the high standards for which his apprenticeship had prepared him and of which his early work showed him amply capable. The turning point can perhaps be traced to his 1836 revision and reissue of Christopher Greenwood's 1818 map of Lancashire. Such ready profits were to be had from making minor alterations to existing maps and publishing them as allegedly new works that Cruchley began assiduously to buy up or acquire for issue the stock of others, notably the plates of George and John Cary, acquired some time between 1846 and <i>c</i>.1850. His only significant updating of the Cary maps was the frequently inaccurate addition of railways and telegraphs. This was typical of his growing practice of issuing maps of doubtful reliability created from old plates using cheap lithographic transfer techniques. The Cary maps and others were also adapted to appeal to the growing market for touring and excursion maps. They were sold widely at bookstalls and railway stations and Cruchley promoted them vigorously by advertising, by offering them in different portable formats, coloured or uncoloured and by mail order, by producing special exhibition issues, and even printing them on silk or as handkerchiefs.<br>
<br>Cruchley extended his output through the republication of earlier atlases, such as <span class="italic">Outlines of the World</span> (1843), first published by Arrowsmiths in 1825. Some of these general atlases were aimed at the growing educational market and he boasted that his educational maps were used by the royal children. He also recognized a growing commercial market and supplied maps to merchants and traders and to institutions such as public libraries. On 16 January 1877 Cruchley's stock was sold at auction by Hodgson's whose sale catalogue revealed the high proportion of his plates which had been acquired from others. Much of the stock was bought by Gall and Inglis who continued to issue some, notably the Cary maps, until well into the twentieth century. Cruchley had lived at 12 Penn Road Villas, London, while still in business, but retired to 65 Grand Parade, Brighton, where he died on 16 June 1880. His wife predeceased him and a nephew, Alfred Frederick King, was left to execute his will, proved at the surprisingly small sum of under &pound;2000.<br>
<br>Cruchley began his career by producing high-quality maps, mainly of the London area, but soon saw the opportunities for supplying an expanding market which demanded neither quality nor reliability but only cheapness. In exploiting this demand Cruchley pioneered vigorous and innovative marketing techniques later imitated by competitors.<br>
