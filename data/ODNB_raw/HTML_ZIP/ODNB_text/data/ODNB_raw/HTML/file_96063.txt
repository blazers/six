<span class="headword">Caulfield,  Patrick Joseph</span>  (1936&#150;2005), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 29 January 1936 at 17 All Saints Road, Acton, London, the son of Patrick Caulfield, plate layer, and his wife, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gill. During the Second World War the family lived in Bolton, Lancashire, where Caulfield's father worked for the De Havilland aircraft factory; in later years Caulfield took elocution lessons to lose the accent he had picked up there. The family moved back to Acton with the return of peace.<br>
<br>At the age of fifteen Caulfield left Acton secondary modern school and worked drilling gas rings in a factory before moving to the advertising department of Crosse and Blackwell, where his duties included varnishing chocolates for display purposes. At seventeen he enlisted in the RAF, pre-empting call-up for national service, and, while stationed at RAF Northwood, in his free time began going to evening classes at Harrow School of Art. Having admitted in his interview with William Coldstream at the Slade School of Fine Art that he did not know the name of any important British artist, Caulfield won a place at Chelsea School of Art in 1956. It was at Chelsea that he met (Anna) Pauline Jacobs, a fellow student eight years his junior (later a fabric designer), and daughter of Christopher Gage Jacobs, architect. They eventually married at the Sacred Heart Church, Lambourn, Berkshire, on 22 June 1968, and had three sons.<br>
<br>Caulfield had a particular aversion to Walter Sickert, and the dark and damp, seedy atmospheres of the paintings of the Camden Town Group. At Chelsea one of his tutors was Jack Smith, well known then as a &#145;kitchen sink&#146; realist, a style that Caulfield may be thought to have simultaneously flooded with colour and stripped of emotion. He started out in the 1960s painting black-outlined objects against plain colour fields. The paint surface was &#145;dumb&#146; and uninflected, like a poster or a page in a magazine. Almost from the beginning the pictures were pleasant, clean, and bright, although Caulfield's detractors saw them as bland, even blank, and devoid of conventional &#145;humanist&#146; content. &#145;I didn't like misty brush-strokes and atmospheric painting&#146;, Caulfield later said. &#145;This was my reaction against the Englishness of English painting which so greatly valued a slightly understated, tentative figuration&#146;  (personal knowledge).<br>
<br>A turning point was Caulfield's first trip abroad in 1960, shortly before taking his place at the Royal College of Art (1960&#150;63). He was in Athens, <i>en route</i> to Crete, and, having grown accustomed to the drabness of austerity Britain, was unprepared for the pre-war American Cadillacs and Fleetwoods cruising the ancient streets looking for fares. The combination of the chromed and finned petal-pink Cadillacs against the backdrop of the Acropolis&#151;the conjunction of the Old World with the New&#151;became one of the characteristic ideas of his work. While many of his contemporaries and near-contemporaries&#151;David Hockney, Derek Boshier, and Richard Smith among them&#151;emigrated to America both actually and in the temper and content of what they produced, Caulfield, always resistant to any kind of mid-Atlanticism and no convert to the notion of &#145;hip&#146;, triumphantly combined European manners and conceptually complex, intellectually challenging, cutting-edge art.<br>
<br>Because they were students together at the Royal College of Art, Caulfield was often aligned with the &#145;third wave&#146; of British pop artists, which included Hockney, R. B. Kitaj, Peter Phillips, and Allen Jones. Caulfield always resisted the association. As late as the Royal Academy's big survey exhibition of pop art in 1991, in which his work featured prominently, he defined pop art dismissively as &#145;social realism without the realism&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 Oct 2005). But among the things Caulfield had in common with his contemporaries was a rejection of the gestural painting favoured by the &#145;abstract expressionists&#146; and other abstract painters, and the personal agonizing associated with Frank Auerbach, Francis Bacon, and what would come to be known as the School of London. He wished to exclude himself as far as possible from his art, making it as apparently objective, dispassionate, and anonymous as the work of the twentieth-century artists whom he most admired, such as Fernand L&eacute;ger and Juan Gris. His <span class="italic">Portrait of Juan Gris</span>, painted while he was still at the Royal College of Art, was one of the last of his paintings to include a human figure, in line with his belief that &#145;Picasso had pulled the plug on interpreting the human form&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 30 Sept 2005).<br>
<br>Caulfield's main subject as a painter was the blissful, occasionally transcending melancholy of human absence and solitude. The bars and restaurants and other social spaces he painted were devoid of people. The &#145;exit&#146; sign that is the focus of one of his later paintings, <span class="italic">Happy Hour</span> (1996), is the direction in which his fellow drinkers have all already headed. The figure reflected in the single filled glass at the centre of the canvas is the painter pursuing his solitary practice. Indeed, it was characteristic of Caulfield that even a visit to the theatre could become a way of experiencing his separateness and enveloping aloneness, even (indeed especially) in the teeth of what, for others, was a convivial social occasion. &#145;The trouble with the theatre&#146;, he liked to say, &#145;is that it so interferes with one's evening&#146;  (private information, J. Hoyland). Nobody who went to the theatre with him, whether it was to see something in the West End or at Covent Garden (where he created a long talked-about set for Michael Corder's ballet <span class="italic">Party Game</span>, for the Royal Ballet in 1984, based on big, billboard-sized versions of the burgundy-shaded boudoir lights that cast their dim glow over the stalls) ever expected to see him back in his seat after the interval. The reverie going on in his head was the one he invariably wanted to stay with.<br>
<br>Caulfield was an urbanite, with no taste for the pastoral in art or in life, or for the trappings of country living. He delighted in referring to the country as &#145;the mud museum&#146;  (personal knowledge). When he was invited to choose from works in the National Gallery for the &#145;Artist's Eye&#146; series in 1986, he ruled out religious pictures (&#145;I didn't want paintings of angels&#146;) and concentrated on paintings that reflected his interest in urban imagery. Half of his selection was drawn from the gallery's basement, the repository of paintings that were, on the whole, considered less remarkable than the ones in the grand rooms. The still lives of drink and food, and scenes set in music halls and taverns, tended to be equally modest. <span class="italic">Lunch-time</span> (1985), the painting of his own that Caulfield chose to include, was typical of his sense of humour in that there is no food to be found in it. It shows the nicotined corner of a City pub decorated with a pot of geraniums and generic bric-&agrave;-brac, and crowded with deep, all-too-solid shadows. If, as Grey Gowrie once maintained, Francis Bacon was unique in the twentieth century &#145;in his ability to render the indoor, overfed, alcohol and tobacco-lined flesh of the average urban male&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mail on Sunday</span>, 11 April 1993), then this surely is a portrait of his comfily recessed, button-backed set and lair.<br>
<br>Caulfield was constantly alert to the everyday excitements of living in a major city. It is unlikely that he ever read Virginia Woolf (&#145;seemed to deal with a middle-to-upper-class society that I didn't know anything about and it meant nothing to me&#146;, he once said of the mid-century English novel)  (B. Robertson, &#145;Patrick Caulfield: prints&#146;, Waddington Gallery, 1981), but he shared with Woolf a love of urban experience, seen quite vividly in a novel like <span class="italic">Mrs Dalloway</span>, for example, in all its hallucinatory particulars. And yet for the forty years of his career Caulfield painted places that offered respite from the noise and sheer teeming variety of city life. These included restaurants, caf&eacute;s, hotel foyers, and other public places, as well as bars. For several years his first call of the day after leaving his home in Belsize Park in north London was at his local pub, a few minutes after the bolts had been drawn in the morning. He liked to breathe in the opening-time cellar smells and observe the shapes the slanting light cut through the fixtures and fittings; he liked to stare into the distance and listen to London. Early paintings such as <span class="italic">View of the Rooftops</span> (1965) and <span class="italic">Lit Window</span> (1969), and later ones such as <span class="italic">Trou Normand</span> (1997), <span class="italic">Rust Never Sleeps</span> (1996), and <span class="italic">Terrace</span> (2002), are proof that this was time well spent. The arrival of fellow customers he took as a sign that it was time for him to be on his way.<br>
<br>Caulfield's place on the fault-line of European and American experience was occasionally alluded to directly in his work. From the 1980s on, he started squeezing acrylic paint straight out of the bottle to recreate the textures of anaglypta and lincrusta and other serviceable, lodging-house surfaces that were begining to disappear. Above and alongside them Caulfield would introduce passages of photorealist painting that conveyed the luridly patterned, wype-cleen Vymura wallpapers that had been imported from America and, for a time, enjoyed a fleeting popularity. A sly gap at floor level betrayed the fact that a regency or art deco column had been encased in formica or a cheap plastic veneer. He mixed in Victorian ceiling sconces and Tiffany-style lamps with affectless contemporary prints. A single Caulfield painting, the critic Marco Livingstone noted, could be an inventory of &#145;the full range of everything imaginable that painting can encompass&#151;<i>trompe l'oeil</i> realism set against geometric abstraction, careful delineation abutting freely brushed areas, forceful sensations of three-dimensionality adjacent to surfaces of the most extreme flatness&#146;  (Livingstone, 158).<br>
<br>Caulfield started off using decorator's gloss paint on hardboard because he liked the impersonal surface it produced. By the time of his major work, he had moved on to acrylic (and occasionally oil) on canvas. Where he never wavered was in his commitment to impure, industrial, non-art colour; colours that were more the colours of things than atmospheres; that referred, directly or indirectly, to the experience of modernity. The post-war period was the period of the digitalization of colour in art. This, the British artist David Batchelor argued, &#145;was an entirely new conception of colour &hellip; More urban colours than the colours of nature. Artificial colours, city colours, industrial colours. Colours that are consistent with the images, materials and forms of an urban, industrial art&#146;  (D. Batchelor, <span class="italic">Chromophobia</span>, 2000, 98, 106). It was Caulfield's unabashed fondness for impure colours and sharp finishes, his determination to deal head-on with modern kitsch and artificiality, that made him an artist's artist. It seems likely, however, that it was these same qualities that throughout his life denied him the interest of collectors, and so the material rewards, that so many of his contemporaries enjoyed.<br>
<br>Caulfield was a Royal Academician (1993); a senior fellow of the Royal College of Art (1993); an honorary fellow of the London Institute (1996); winner of the Jerwood prize (in 1995, with Maggi Hambling); and nominee for the 1987 Turner prize. He was appointed CBE in 1996, and enjoyed major retrospectives at the Tate Gallery (1981), the Serpentine Gallery (1992), and the Hayward Gallery (1999). Unusually for a modern-minded visual artist, he was a voracious reader of books. He was introduced to the poems of Jules Laforgue as a student and in 1972 produced a series of twenty-two prints based on Laforgue's work. In the 1980s he started reading Raymond Carver's short stories, which also appealed to him for their refusal of floridity and long-windedness, and for the unflinching way they addressed the problem of drink. When Carver visited England before his own premature death, Caulfield, who was unwell at the time, made a heroic effort to cross London to see him read.<br>
<br>Caulfield was found to be suffering from cancer of the mouth and tongue in November 1992, a condition that, with characteristic candour and courage, he didn't hesitate to attribute to his love of whisky. He never recovered his health after the operation that followed. His first marriage having ended in divorce, on 17 November 1999, at Burgh House, Hampstead, he married his fellow artist Janet Nathan, the 61-year-old daughter of Harold Poster, industrialist. He died of squamous cell cancer on 29 September 2005 at his home, 19 Belsize Square, Belsize Park, London, and was survived by his wife and the three sons of his first marriage. &#145;The most inexplicable thing about Patrick was his work&#146;, Caulfield's lifelong friend the painter John Hoyland said at his funeral. &#145;It was and remains an enigma. Patrick was charming, graceful and seemingly impassive; he rarely showed his inner passions. He concealed everything that mattered to him from all but a few&#146;  (private information, J. Hoyland). He was nevertheless recognized as one of the great British painters of the late twentieth century.<br>
