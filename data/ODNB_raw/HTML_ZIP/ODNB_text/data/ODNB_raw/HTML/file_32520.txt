<span class="headword">Commerell, Sir  John Edmund</span>  (1829&#150;1901), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born in London on 13 January 1829, was the second son of John Williams Commerell of Strood Park, Horsham, and his wife, Sophia, daughter of William Bosanquet. He entered the navy in February 1842 and was at once sent out to China, where he experienced the realities of war. Later he was in the <i>Firebrand</i> with Captain James Hope and took part in the operations in the Paran&aacute;, including the engagement with the batteries at Obligado on 20 November 1845, when the chain was cut by the boats of the <i>Firebrand</i>, a gallant achievement, which passed without official recognition. He was promoted lieutenant on 13 December 1848. Commerell married, in 1853, Mathilda Maria, fourth daughter of Joseph Bushby of Halkin Street, London.<br>
<br>As lieutenant of the <i>Vulture</i> Commerell was in the Baltic in 1854 and took part in the operations in the Gulf of Bothnia, in 1855 was in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, and on 29 September was promoted commander of the gun-vessel <i>Weser</i>, employed in the Sea of Azov. A few days later, on 11 October, he landed with a small party, made a hazardous march inland, and set fire to a large store of forage and corn. This service was important and dangerous, and the Victoria Cross was awarded to Commerell and two of his seamen. In 1859 he was off China in the <i>Fury</i> and commanded a division of the seamen landed for the unsuccessful attack on the Taku (Dagu) forts. Although repulsed, the determined courage in the face of insurmountable difficulties was recognized, and Commerell was promoted captain on 18 July. In 1866 his services while in command of the <i>Terrible</i>, laying the Atlantic cable, were rewarded with a CB civil division. In 1869 he commanded the <i>Monarch</i>, which in December carried across the Atlantic the remains of George Peabody, the American philanthropist and founder of the &#145;Peabody dwellings&#146;. In 1870 Commerell received the military CB, and in February 1871, with a broad pennant in the <i>Rattlesnake</i>, was appointed commander-in-chief on the west coast of Africa. In the Second Anglo-Asante War, in August 1873, while reconnoitring up the River Pra, he was dangerously wounded by a musket shot in the lungs, which compelled him to invalid. In March 1874 he was created a KCB, and he attained his flag on 12 November 1876. In the following year he was sent out to the Mediterranean as second in command, at the special request of Sir Geoffrey Hornby, with whom his relations were most cordial and who highly commended his ability and loyalty. In November 1882 he went out as commander-in-chief on the North American station, where he remained nearly three years, returning in autumn 1885.<br>
<br>In 1880 Commerell had unsuccessfully contested Southampton, but in the 1885 general election, and again in 1886, he was elected Conservative MP for Southampton, and zealously for the next two years endeavoured to awaken the country to the necessity of strengthening the navy. He was thus largely instrumental in bringing about the <span class="roman">Naval Defence Act</span> of 1889, though he was not then in parliament, having resigned his seat in July 1888 on being appointed commander-in-chief at Portsmouth. He had already been promoted admiral in April 1886, and had been made a GCB at Queen Victoria's jubilee in June 1887. At Portsmouth in 1889 he commanded at the naval review and received Kaiser Wilhelm II, who afterwards wrote him an autograph letter on presenting him with a sword.<br>
<br>Commerell was always popular at court; he was naval aide-de-camp to the queen from 1872 to 1877, and was her groom-in-waiting from 1874 to 1879 and again from 1891. On the death of Sir Provo Wallis he was, at the queen's request, promoted on 13 February 1892 admiral of the fleet, though not the senior admiral. In January 1899, at the age of seventy, he was placed on the retired list, and he died at his home, 45 Rutland Gate, London, on 21 May 1901; his wife survived him. An officer of great experience in amphibious and riverine warfare, Commerell was one of the leaders of the intellectual and material renaissance of the Royal Navy that began in the early 1880s.<br>
