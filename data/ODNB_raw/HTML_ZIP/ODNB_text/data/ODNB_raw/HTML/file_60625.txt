<span class="headword">Reinhardt,  Max</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Max Goldmann]</span>  (1873&#150;1943), <span class="occ">theatre director and manager</span>, was born Max Goldmann on 9 September 1873 in Baden, near Vienna, of Jewish parents, the eldest of six children of Wilhelm Goldmann (1846&#150;1906), shopkeeper, and his wife, Rosa Weingraf (1851&#150;1924). After attending Realschule and B&uuml;rgerschule in Vienna he began acting under the name of Max Reinhardt in 1890, and from 1894 to 1903 performed at the Deutsches Theater, Berlin. In 1901 he founded a cabaret, later to become the Kleines Theater, Berlin, where he devoted himself more and more to directing plays. His first major breakthrough occurred in 1905 at the Neues Theater in Berlin with a spectacular staging of <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>, in which a revolving stage was used for the first time in modern theatre as an integral part of the production.<br>
<br>Reinhardt went on to become arguably the most prolific and versatile director of twentieth-century theatre. He brought freshness and excitement to classics that had previously been routinely offered in wooden productions, notably Shakespeare, Goethe, medieval drama, and Greek tragedy; for example, he staged Sophocles' <span class="italic">Oedipus Rex</span> in a circus arena. He also daringly presented controversial modern works, such as Wilde's <span class="italic">Salome</span>, Ibsen's <span class="italic">Ghosts</span>, the banned <span class="italic">Spring's Awakening</span> by Wedekind, plays by Gorky and Strindberg, and he later provided opportunities for staging expressionist works in his &#145;Young Germany&#146; seasons at the Deutsches Theater, Berlin.<br>
<br>After achieving international fame Reinhardt accepted an invitation in 1911 to premi&egrave;re Karl Vollmoeller's <span class="italic">The Miracle</span>, a mimed religious drama, at Olympia, London. This vast spectacle was a huge success and was subsequently frequently revived; eventually in 1924&#150;5 it was taken on tour across the United States, with Lady Diana Cooper in the lead role. From 1915 to 1918 Reinhardt became the controversial director of the Berlin Volksb&uuml;hne, saving it from closure. In 1919 he opened his so-called &#145;Theatre of Five Thousand&#146;, a huge arena seating 3200, which, however, soon proved uneconomic. A more successful venture was the founding in 1920 of the Salzburg Festival, at which Reinhardt's production of Hugo von Hofmannsthal's adaptation of the English morality play <span class="italic">Everyman</span> continues to be performed to this day. In the same year Reinhardt moved back to Vienna, where he refurbished the Theater in der Josefstadt and established himself in a luxury residence at Schloss Leopoldskron, Salzburg. In 1927&#150;8 his ensemble performed in New York, and he lectured at Columbia University: &#145;On the actor&#146;. In 1932 his production of Offenbach's <span class="italic">La belle H&eacute;l&egrave;ne</span> was performed in London and Manchester.<br>
<br>With Hitler's accession to power in 1933, Reinhardt was forced to hand over his theatres &#145;to the German people&#146;. Goebbels offered to confer on Reinhardt the status of &#145;honorary Aryan&#146;. Reinhardt declined, courageously writing a critical open letter to Goering and Goebbels. He now had to spend more of his time abroad, in June 1933 staging his favourite play, <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>, with a largely amateur cast on a broad hillside in South Park, Headington, Oxford (&#145;lovely to the eye, &hellip; partaken &hellip; fully of the nature of a dream&#146;, reported <span class="italic">The Times</span>  (Styan, 60)). In 1935 he directed for Warner Brothers his sugary film version of <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>, with Olivia de Havilland playing Hermia, Mickey Rooney Puck, and James Cagney Bottom. In 1934 he ended his failed marriage (begun in 1910) to the actress Else Heims, with whom he had had two sons, and was at last free to marry his partner and frequent leading lady, Helene Thimig.<br>
<br>In 1937 Reinhardt moved to the United States, and his Austrian property was confiscated by the Nazis the following year. In Hollywood in 1938 he founded the Max Reinhardt Workshop for Stage, Screen and Radio, the last of several institutions created by Reinhardt for the training of the actor. In 1940 he became a United States citizen and continued to direct plays until the last year of his life. He died of a stroke on 31 October 1943 in the Gladstone Hotel in New York, and was buried at Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, on 3 November.<br>
<br>In terms of theatrical style Reinhardt was not particularly innovative, and this, coupled with the fact that he wrote little about his own work, has meant that his importance has been underestimated. Reinhardt's achievement lay not only in the colossal range of his work but above all in the beauty of his stagings and the care that went into them. He nurtured the talents of virtually all the leading German-speaking actors of the day. He gave opportunities to scenic designers to transform the stage into a work of art. He paid attention to detail, working with extras on crowd scenes with hitherto unheard-of solicitude. He was equally skilled at creating pieces for a tiny intimate theatre as mounting a colossal spectacle with hundreds of extras. By offering a fresh reading of great poetic dramas such as those of Greek tragedy or Goethe's <span class="italic">Faust</span>, he not only established these once more as viable pieces of modern repertory; he also demonstrated to young playwrights the possibility of creating significant drama that went beyond the limits of naturalism and encouraged them in their efforts by enabling the staging of experimental works. The style that emerged from all this has been described as &#145;impressionistic realism&#146;, a style that was unashamedly theatrical in a way that was not possible in naturalism but which, in the search for beauty, eschewed the distorted excesses of expressionism. At a time when most European theatre was being constrained by a misguided pursuit of total realism or being emasculated by commercial pressures to offer mindless entertainment, Reinhardt restored to the stage a respect for quality in acting, design, and writing that has laid the foundations for all that is best in theatre today. As the critic Herbert Ihering summed it up: &#145;The revolution in theatre was no other than this: that for the first time theatre sought to be an art. Art, measured not against life, but according to its own laws, like painting, music, or poetry&#146;  (Ihering, &#145;Das neue Theater&#146;, <span class="italic">Die neue Rundschau</span>, 1921, 423&#150;4).<br>
