<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ayscough,  Samuel</span>  (1745&#150;1804), <span class="occ">librarian and antiquary</span>, was born in Nottingham and baptized at St Peter's, Nottingham, on 29 November 1745, the only son of George Ayscough (1721/2&#150;1783), printer, and his second wife, Edith Wigley. His grandfather, William Ayscough, was a stationer and printer in Nottingham, and when he died on 2 March 1719 the business was run by his widow until George Ayscough was old enough to take it over. George continued the printing business until the year 1762, some thirty years after his mother's death. Although he enjoyed the esteem of his neighbours, he was not a good business man. He speculated unwisely, even to the extent of the alchemical folly of attempting to extract gold from the dross of coal. In 1762, having lost almost all his money, he took over a large farm at Great Wigston in Leicestershire, managing ultimately to lose the rest of his money and the patrimony of his children.<br>
<br>Samuel Ayscough was educated at the grammar school in Nottingham under Richard Johnson, author of <span class="italic">Noctes Nottinghamiae</span>. He helped his father in his various attempts to achieve some measure of business success, and when these failed took over the running of a mill. But even this was a failure, and it was owing to the timely help of an old schoolfellow and friend, John Eamer (later to be knighted and lord mayor of London), that he migrated to London about 1770 at Eamer's suggestion. There, newly clothed at Eamer's expense, he became overseer of street paviours, a position he also owed to Eamer's help. Before long, however, he found employment in some capacity with John Rivington, a prominent bookseller and publisher of London. Doubtless because of the experience he gained as an employee of Rivington, he progressed to a position as assistant to the principal librarian of the British Museum in the cataloguing department. Henceforth, his life was to revolve around that institution, one of his chief pleasures being to act as a guide to its treasures.<br>
<br>With his salary from the British Museum, plus some income from arranging private libraries, and financial help from Eamer, Ayscough was in a position to send for and support his father until the latter's death on 18 November 1783. In 1782, with permission of the trustees of the museum, he published privately his catalogue of the undescribed manuscripts in the museum, a labour which took him some two years. He used 20,000 slips of paper in making the catalogue, having examined every manuscript, and employed two indexes for ease of reference. The first gives the manuscript numbers and the pages on which they are described; the second, all the names in the two volumes. The catalogue describes 5000 volumes and is still indispensable. He was not at that time a member of the permanent staff of the museum. When he did become a member about 1785 he had unsuccessfully applied for five earlier vacancies over a period of fifteen years. His first appointment was in the department of natural history, but in February 1791 he succeeded to the department of printed books. In 1787, with the help of Samuel Harper and Dr Paul Henry Maty, he produced a catalogue of the printed books in the museum entitled <span class="italic">Librorum impressorium qui in museo Britannico adservantur catalogus</span>, not entirely free from faults but of great immediate and subsequent value.<br>
<br>In addition to the catalogues of British Museum holdings, Ayscough earned his fame as the prince of index makers by compiling the index for the first seventy volumes of Ralph Griffiths's <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> in 1786, with a continuation to volume 81 in 1796. His two-volume index to the first fifty-six volumes of the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> appeared in 1789. The index was divided into five parts: &#145;Essays&#146;, &#145;Poetry&#146;, &#145;Names&#146;, &#145;Books&#146;, and &#145;Plates and cuts&#146;, with the addition of an index to nine numbers of &#145;Miscellaneous correspondence&#146;. In an unsigned two-page preface, Ayscough, adopting an editorial stance, wrote<blockquote>The Utility of a GENERAL INDEX, to so mixt a Work as the <span class="roman">GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE</span>, when by the Indulgence of the Publick it has increased to above Twenty Volumes, is too evident to be questioned; and we therefore hope that we are now making some return to our Friends, however unequal, for the Favours which we have received; for not to be able to find what we know to be in our possession, is a more vexatious circumstance than the mere want of what we have neglected to procure.</blockquote>The index to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> is not, however, without its limitations: the name Smith, for example, occurs in hundreds of entries bare of forenames. To accompany the third volume of an edition of Shakespeare's plays, Ayscough in 1790 published what is described on the title-page as an index to &#145;the remarkable words and passages made use of by Shakespeare&#146;, but is actually the first concordance of Shakespeare's plays. The publisher John Stockdale paid Ayscough 200 guineas for his index. Other indexes compiled by Ayscough were of the first twenty volumes of the <span class="italic">British Critic</span>, published in 1804; of John Bridges' <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of Northamptonshire</span> (1791); and of the first volume of Owen Manning's <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of the County of Surrey</span> (1804), the second and third volumes being published in 1809 and 1814, well after Ayscough's death. There is no evidence that he compiled the index to the <span class="italic">Annual Register</span> (1758&#150;80) which has been ascribed to him. John Nichols, who knew him, ascribes to him the indexes to Dr Paul Henry Maty's <span class="italic">New Review</span> (1782&#150;86). In 1802 he provided the indexes for, but did not edit, <span class="italic">Calendarium rotulorum patentium in Turri Londinensis</span>. The title-page names T. Astle as the editor; John Caley was the co-editor of this and other volumes of records. Ayscough is said to have claimed to have earned &pound;1300 by his indexing.<br>
<br>Ayscough's single most extended literary effort was his <span class="italic">Remarks on the letters from an American farmer, or, A detection of the errors of Mr. J. Hector St. John, pointing out the pernicious tendency of those letters to Great Britain</span>, published in 1783, occasioned by the publication one year earlier of de Crevecoeur's <span class="italic">Letters of an American Farmer</span>. Ayscough claimed that the author was neither an American nor a farmer, and that his sole purpose was to urge Englishmen to migrate to America. The pamphlet was praised in reviews in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> and in the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>. Ayscough contributed some forty pieces to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, the earliest in February 1781. His letters cover a number of topics&#151;medical, agricultural, topographical, and architectural&#151;and address miscellaneous matters such as impostures and the mortality of cats. His historical contributions include anecdotes of Cardinal Wolsey, Alexander Oldys, James Ralph, Bishop Wickham, and Archbishop Matthews, and a reprint of four letters by Ben Jonson. John Nichols was of the opinion that the pieces written by Ayscough for the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> were &#145;in a style which would not have discredited talents of which the world has a higher opinion&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 9.56).<br>
<br>At some time between 1781 and 1785, but probably at the later date, Ayscough was ordained, something he had long desired. He was presented to the curacy of Normanton-on-Soar in Nottinghamshire, and afterwards was appointed assistant curate of the none too decorous parish of St Giles-in-the-Fields under the Revd Richard Southgate, a colleague at the British Museum. He so comported himself as to win the friendship of a number of eminent persons, including John Buckner, later bishop of Chichester. He was elected to the Society of Antiquaries on 12 March 1789. Eight years later, to the month and almost to the day, he communicated two items to <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> (13, 1797): &#145;Copies of two manuscripts on the proper method of defence against invasion&#146;, and on 9 March &#145;Copy of a manuscript in the British Museum Harl. MSS. 6844, <i>fol</i>. 49&#146;.<br>
<br>Ayscough delivered fifteen Fairchild lectures from 1790 to 1804. Thomas Fairchild, gardener, of Shoreditch, bequeathed a sum of money for a sermon each Whit Tuesday on the &#145;Wonderful works of God in the creation&#146;. The sermons, intended for publication after Ayscough's death, never appeared. He had hoped unsuccessfully to find some 200 subscribers at about 2 guineas each to enable him to edit a collection of historical letters in the British Museum bequeathed by Thomas Birch. Another ambitious work remains in manuscript, a catalogue of the ancient rolls and charters in the British Museum, a work which occupied him for some five years from 1787 to 1792. His last effort in the museum was in arranging the books in classes and cataloguing the king's tracts.<br>
<br>About 1803 Ayscough was presented to the small vicarage of Cudham in Kent by Lord Chancellor Eldon. The vicarage was some 17 miles from London, but Ayscough travelled the distance every Saturday to fulfil his pastoral duties, returning on Monday. In a two-part letter to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (74, 1804, 830&#150;33, 901&#150;3), he gave a detailed account of his parish. He died in his apartments in the museum of what has been termed dropsy in the chest on 30 October 1804, and was buried in the cemetery of St George's, Bloomsbury.<br>
