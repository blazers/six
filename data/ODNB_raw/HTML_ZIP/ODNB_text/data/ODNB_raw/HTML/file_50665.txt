<span class="headword">Savage,  John Percival</span>  (1895&#150;1970), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, was born at 8 Watt Street, Nottingham, on 18 November 1895, the son of Robert Louther Savage, a railway guard, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pakes, who was a Primitive Methodist. In 1911, when he was fifteen, he left Mundella secondary school, Nottingham, without qualifications and joined Boots, the retail chain and pharmaceutical manufacturers, as an office boy. At the time the founder, Jesse Boot, was trying to improve the standard of recruits by taking them from the local secondary schools; though his eyes were thought to be weak, young Savage was sent into the accounts department.<br>
<br>Savage's rise through the business was undoubtedly due to his shrewdness and dedication to the company, but can be adequately understood only by reference to the internal organization of Boots during that period. In 1921, after Jesse Boot sold his controlling interest in the company to the American firm Rexall, John Greenwood was appointed expense controller and Savage became one of his assistants. It was recognized that with the rapid growth of payroll, retail branches, and manufacturing, the need for co-ordination of policy on expenditure was vital. Although the company as a whole had profit objectives, it was virtually impossible to allocate individual targets to sections within it because, with the exception of the shops, individual profit-earning units could not be defined. Central direction of expenditure was therefore inevitable, and in the course of a few years the expense control department acquired considerable executive authority. Savage allowed it to become a kind of clearing-house for numerous problems which did not easily belong elsewhere; his major assets were his earthy common sense, his easy rapport with the men he had grown up with, and his growing reputation as a mediator. On 20 April 1922 he married Beatrice Maude, daughter of Henry Hodgson, a painter.<br>
<br>During the twenty years or so that Savage was his assistant, Greenwood allowed him a very free hand and he represented the finance director on various Boots committees on which Greenwood really ought to have been sitting. This delegation not only gave Greenwood more time for hunting and fishing but, in particular, saved him from having to disagree too often with Lord Trent (Jesse Boot's son and successor), who took the chair at some of these meetings. The arrangement was no doubt also congenial to Trent, who hated difficult personal encounters and found Savage an easier person to deal with. In 1936 Trent appointed Savage as his personal assistant and in 1941, when the chairman effectively moved to government service as a civil commissioner, Savage became general manager. Having been Trent's right-hand man for eighteen years, he was the only executive who knew enough of the business to succeed him.<br>
<br>This career background serves to explain the main achievements of Savage's seven years as Boots' chairman and managing director (1954&#150;61). It can fairly be regarded as a period of transition from the Trent autocracy to managerial government by committee. During the years in which Savage was administrative general manager but lacked the authority of appointment as chief executive, he had to form policy from a feeling for the consensus&#151;given the jealousy of his rivals there was no practical alternative. When he was finally appointed chairman, he continued to be reasonable and considerate to those whom he regarded as of similar rank and social background; in office Savage allowed the executive to argue with him and worked for agreement. He had few original ideas of his own and seldom visited the branches, so was also prepared to listen to younger men. He was a good organizer of managers in the sense that he provided the right conditions to enable them to work together as a team. One of the Boots buyers at the period recalled that he suddenly acquired so much more freedom that he hardly knew how to use it. However, the benefits were still limited; a small circle of &#145;buddies&#146; gained most.<br>
<br>In later years Savage was sensitive about his lack of formal education; &#145;superior&#146; accents grated with him and the Boots' managers recruited at Cambridge made him feel insecure. Greenwood tried to give him some polish by taking him to his London club and to a Savile Row tailor, but he never enjoyed such surroundings or formal occasions. He was immensely proud of his achievement in climbing from the lowest rung of the ladder to the top but he was not entirely at ease there, particularly on formal occasions. He was popular in his own circle but nervous at shareholders' meetings. He had never worked for any other firm, did not join employers' organizations, would not take directorships in other firms, and knew little of the world of business outside Boots. In any situation he took his inspiration from what Lord Trent would have done. Trent had trusted him to maintain his policies and Savage was loyal to the end; his chairmanship was really an extension of Trent's. Shy and truculent, Savage too often bristled at strangers and subordinates, and his habitual swearing intimidated or alienated some of the rising generation of managers. By the time he was Boots chairman one of his family could describe him as a &#145;fallen Methodist&#146;, and he had a great liking for pink gins. Savage died at his home, 612 Derby Road, Nottingham, on 22 February 1970.<br>
