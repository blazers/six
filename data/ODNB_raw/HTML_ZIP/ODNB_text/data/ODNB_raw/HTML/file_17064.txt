<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lovell, Sir  Salathiel</span>  (1631/2&#150;1713), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the son of Benjamin Lovell (1607/8&#150;1680) and his first wife, Mary Godwin (<i>d</i>. 1658). The naturalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17062/', "Robert Lovell")</script> was his brother. Benjamin Lovell was rector of Preston Bagot, Warwickshire, from 1636. During the civil war Benjamin exchanged the word for the sword; he served briefly as a captain in the cavalry regiment raised in the county by Colonel William Purefoy and was present at the siege of Gloucester in 1643. He became rector of Lapworth, Warwickshire, where he resisted paying the sequestered minister's wife her due out of the revenues of the parish. In 1646 he was threatened with the loss of the living unless he did so, and by May 1649 owed her two years' arrears. Benjamin Lovell conformed at the Restoration, and was still alive in 1677.<h2>
<a name="Northamptonandthelaw"></a>Northampton and the law</h2>In June 1648 Lovell was admitted to Gray's Inn. In 1652 he was created one of the trustees for the parish lands in Lapworth (and twenty-five years later he helped defeat an attempt to convey the lands into the trusteeship of local gentry rather than of parishioners). For a time he worked as an attorney's clerk in Buckingham, and was called to the bar in November 1656. By 1661 he had moved to Northampton, where on 2 June he and his wife, Mary (1641/2&#150;1719), baptized their son Salathiel in the parish church of All Saints. They may already have had a daughter, Maria. Nine sons and three daughters followed between September 1662 and June 1681.<br>
<br>Lovell established himself as a significant figure in the politics of Northampton. In 1663 he acted as the local agent for Christopher Hatton when the latter stood in a parliamentary by-election in the town with the backing of the town's dissenting interest and the council members recently secluded under the <span class="roman">Corporation Act</span>. On 31 January Lovell headed the list of signatories&#151;&#145;your vestalls&#146;&#151;appealing to Hatton to stand as &#145;our Publicola &amp; most noble Consull, to see restored our faythfull Senators of late most violently irregulated&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 29551, fol. 9<i>r</i>). On the day of the election, while the corporation proceeded to choose Sir William Dudley on a restricted franchise in the town hall, Hatton's supporters elected him at the market cross on an open franchise, and Lovell importuned the sheriff for four hours to issue a double return (unsuccessfully, though Hatton won on appeal to the Commons). Lovell's local position was doubtless advanced by the triumph by 1672 of the &#145;fanatic party&#146;&#151;the secluded councillors and their supporters on the corporation&#151;and by their demand for his legal expertise as Northampton's partisan politics were fought out in king's bench. He became deputy recorder (the town's chief legal officer, as the recordership itself was always held by an influential local peer), a testimony both to his local importance and to the success of his legal career in London. Following the devastation of Northampton by fire in 1675 Lovell was one of the named commissioners appointed to adjudicate in disputes arising from the rebuilding of the town. He also picked up the post of deputy to the earl of Arlington as steward of the royal manor of Higham Ferrers, Northamptonshire. At some point he acquired an estate at Harleston, 4 miles to the west of Northampton.<br>
<br>Lovell also became a significant figure in Gray's Inn. Although in November 1669 he had to apologize to the pension (the meeting of the governing bench) for &#145;his error in his Behaviour and carriage and for words spoken at a former Pencon&#146;  (Fletcher, 2.4), he was called to be an ancient of the inn in November 1671 and became a bencher in November 1677; thereafter he was a frequent attender at the pensions until 1688.<br>
<br>Early in 1684 Lovell's politics brought him under suspicion with the government, when he was accused of involvement with the fugitive radical whig Thomas Hunt. On 18 January Sir Roger L'Estrange wrote to Secretary of State Jenkins that a prominent Northampton tory had informed him that Hunt had &#145;sent his libels to Northampton as by direction from Mr Lovell of Gray's Inn, and that the thing is proved upon Lovell, it appears under Hunt's own hand that he corresponds with Lovell, who knows where he is&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1683&#150;4</i>, 219). L'Estrange recommended that Lovell's chambers be searched. However, Lovell had already written to Arlington to forestall the charge a few days earlier. About midsummer 1682, he explained, Hunt, a fellow member of Gray's Inn whom he hardly knew, had asked him what booksellers there were in Northampton; he had given him a couple of names and thought nothing more of it. However, on 9 January, while attending the sessions on behalf of a client, Lovell heard Hunt's <span class="italic">Postscript</span> (an attack on the clergy who preached up passive obedience and the divine right of kings from their pulpits) presented as a seditious book, and saw a letter produced in court from Hunt to one of the booksellers which had been sent with a consignment of 150 copies of the book, asking him to send the money for them by Lovell. Lovell protested that he had known nothing of this: &#145;I never read that book and am far from promoting that or any book touching the government and have never concerned myself in public affairs&#146;  (ibid., 206). Lovell's protests appear somewhat disingenuous (Hunt was already a notorious figure when he spoke to Lovell), and later in 1684 he acted as counsel for the whig William Sacheverell and others charged with riot in the disputes in defence of the borough charter of Nottingham.<br>
<br>Superficially, Lovell accommodated to the regime of James II. He was one of a group of lawyers installed as serjeant on 26 June 1688. The rings which they presented by custom at Westminster Hall acknowledged the recent birth of the king's son and the declaration of indulgence with the inscription &#145;Rex princeps et Christiana libertas&#146; (&#145;King, prince, and Christian liberty&#146;; Baker, <span class="italic">Serjeants</span>, 418). However, Lovell's name also appeared on a list drawn up by an unknown but evidently informed hand of those who might act in opposition to James.<h2>
<a name="RecorderofLondon"></a>Recorder of London</h2>On 10 June 1692 Lovell was elected as recorder of London by the court of aldermen; the defeated candidates were the whig MP and lawyer Sir John Tremayne and James Selby, and, in a tied vote with Selby, Lovell was elected on the casting vote of the lord mayor. On 22 October 1692 he was knighted when the City dignitaries attended the king at Kensington Palace to congratulate him on his safe return from the Netherlands. In 1695 Lovell was made a king's serjeant and appointed second justice of Chester and of Denbighshire, Flintshire, and Montgomeryshire, a position he held in tandem with the recordership.<br>
<br>Lovell showed himself a loyal agent of William III's regime. In September 1695 at the Old Bailey he heard the case of the Jacobite Captain Waugh, charged with procuring an escape from a government messenger: where the judges in king's bench had worried away at the legal technicalities in a similar case, Lovell &#145;cut asunder the Gordian knots of law he could not untie, and the fact being proved refused a special verdict, and directed the jury to bring him in guilty, which they did&#146;  (<span class="italic">Downshire MSS</span>, 1.691). Later that year Lovell helped prepare the evidence for the bill of attainder against Sir John Fenwick.<br>
<br>Lovell became recorder at a time of rising concern with crime in the metropolis, fed by economic disruption and by political and religious anxieties. The 1690s saw high levels of prosecution of thieves, and of the coiners and clippers who endangered a currency in a state of crisis; it also witnessed the drive against vice offences by the societies for the reformation of manners (of which Lovell was a supporter). Lovell was a very active magistrate, and, when in 1702 he sought the grant of the forfeited estate of a convicted coiner, he presented himself very much as the committed crime fighter, declaring that over the past nine years he had had more &#145;trouble &amp; fateague in the discovery and Conviccon of such Offenders [coiners] and other Criminalls than any person in the Kingdome&#146;  (TNA: PRO, T1/78, fol. 130).<br>
<br>Others took a less positive view of Lovell's activities. Daniel Defoe was savage in his denunciation in <span class="italic">The Reformation of Manners</span> (1702), portraying him as the archetype of the bad judge who shamelessly played to the gallery in his public pronouncements<blockquote>
<div>The <i>City-Mouth</i>, with eloquence endu'd,<br>
</div>
<div>To Mountebank the list'ning Multitude<br>
</div>
</blockquote>glorying in his power of life and death, and sadistically hectoring the condemned from the bench:<blockquote>
<div>L&#151;l, the Pandor of thy Judgment-Seat,<br>
</div>
<div>Has neither Manners, Honesty, nor Wit;<br>
</div>
<div>Instead of which, he's plenteously supply'd<br>
</div>
<div>With Nonsense, Noise, Impertinence, and Pride&hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>With awkward scornful Phiz, and vile Grimace<br>
</div>
<div>The genuine Talents of an ugly Face;<br>
</div>
<div>With haughty Tone insults the Wretch that dies<br>
</div>
<div>And sports with his approaching Miseries<br>
</div>
<div>God-like he nods upon the Bench of State;<br>
</div>
<div>His Smiles are Life, and if he Frown 'Tis Fate:<br>
</div>
<div>Boldly invading Heaven's Prerogative;<br>
</div>
<div>For with his Breath he kills, or saves alive.<br>
</div> (Defoe, 70&#150;71)</blockquote>This much is arguably no more than condemning Lovell as the hard face of the war against crime and vice: at each sessions at the Old Bailey, Lovell not only sat in judgment on many of the cases, but at the end delivered the sentences on all of them. But most troubling of all to his critics was precisely how Lovell pursued the &#145;discovery and Conviccon&#146; of offenders: the linked questions of his relationship with thief-takers and his role in the granting of royal pardons.<br>
<br>Even the rulers of the City had serious reservations about the report that Lovell presented to the king and (increasingly) the cabinet after each sessions recommending who should be pardoned, apparently appropriating to himself the role of sole intermediary between the Old Bailey bench and the City on the one hand, and Whitehall on the other. Seven months after his appointment, on 15 January 1693, the court of aldermen complained that a pardon of Newgate convicts was passing the great seal without their prior notification. Three days later they ordered that after every sessions, &#145;Mr Recorder doe before he attend his Matie with his Report Come unto this Court and take the sense and Judgment of the same in what Character and Circumstance he shall Represent to his Majesty the severall Condemned Persons&#146;  (CLRO, REP 97, 100). The issue rumbled on until September, when Lovell himself admitted that &#145;the present Method of reporting to their Majesties&#146; had led to &#145;great and intollerable troubles and many unjust Jealousies and Reflections&#146;. The court accepted his proposal that the justices present should together decide before the end of each sessions who should be recommended for pardon  (ibid., 454&#150;5). Nevertheless, in spring 1700 the court of aldermen again attacked Lovell for making his report to the cabinet without due consultation, and unanimously voted to deny him the recorder's customary annual gratuity of 100 guineas &#145;for his disrespects to the Chayre and his not Obeying the Orders of this Court&#146;  (CLRO, REP 104, 296). The aldermen relented a few months later upon Lovell giving them &#145;full Satisfaccon&#146;  (CLRO, REP 105, 4).<br>
<br>The court's objections were in part a matter of defending jurisdictional territory, and it is uncertain how far the aldermen were responding to a real rather than a formal change in the recorder's role in the pardoning process; the impetus for the change probably came more from the cabinet than the recorder, and their objections did little to halt it. In 1693 the aldermen were also responding to complaints that far too many criminals were being reprieved. Some may have opposed Lovell for his whig politics. But the court was evidently concerned about his lack of accountability and about <i>who</i> was being pardoned. What the court thought of Lovell's motives is unknowable, but they were addressing an issue which in the bitter satire of Defoe and Tom Brown was taken as evidence of corruption. To them Lovell was a man who misused the power of life and death, which he exercised through his influence in court and his voice in the granting of royal pardons; to Defoe, Lovell was a man who could be bought, who actively shielded and took a share of the spoils of criminals:<blockquote>
<div>Definitive in Law, without Appeal,<br>
</div>
<div>But always serves the Hand who pays him well:<br>
</div>
<div>He trades in Justice, and the Souls of Men,<br>
</div>
<div>And prostitutes them equally to Gain:<br>
</div>
<div>He has his Publick Book of Rates to show,<br>
</div>
<div>Where every Rogue the Price of Life may know<br>
</div>
<div>Fraternities of Villains he maintains,<br>
</div>
<div>Protects their Robberies, and shares the Gains;<br>
</div>
<div>Who thieve with Toleration as a Trade,<br>
</div>
<div>And then restore according as they paid.<br>
</div> (Defoe, 70&#150;71)</blockquote>This was an accusation about Lovell's relationship with thief-takers, the ambiguous figures who inhabited the borderland between the law and crime, mediating between the authorities and victims of theft on the one hand and criminals on the other. They detected and brought to trial some offenders for private or official reward, while often simply helping people get their stolen goods back for a fee. These were men who in some cases were as much organizers as detectors of crime.<br>
<br>The charges of corrupt dealings with thief-takers dogged Lovell's memory. In 1725, at the time of the downfall of Jonathan Wild and twelve years after Lovell's death, a correspondent of the <span class="italic">British Journal</span> related how Lovell had colluded with the thief-taker John Connell in his attempt to get one of the latter's clients, Rogers, acquitted of theft. Connell brought into court one of his henchmen, Joseph Hatfield, who swore that he and Morris Evans (who was then a prisoner in Newgate, and whom Connell tried to bribe to confess to the crime) were the actual thieves. Lovell spoke in Hatfield's favour and attempted to have the case dismissed, then and at the next sessions. In the hope of getting a judge other than Lovell, the prosecutors then had the case held over to a further sessions, when Lovell defended Hatfield to the presiding judge, the lord chief justice, Sir John Holt, as:<blockquote>a poor young unhappy Man, that had been drawn in to be an assistant in conveying away a Truck with some Clothes in it &hellip; who was now dead in Prison; and that Hatfield's Conscience having prick'd him, he came voluntarily, and made a Confession in Court of his Crime, to prevent another Man's being wrongfully hang'd for what he had done; and that we [the accusers] had been maliciously and cruelly prosecuting several Sessions for it, when he appeared to be a true Penitent, that it was hoped he would never attempt a dishonest Act again. (<span class="italic">British Journal</span>, 24 April 1725, 2)</blockquote>According to Morris Evans, &#145;Hatfield had always a Purse of five or six hundred Pounds to bribe the R&#151;r, and Court Officers, or their Servants, and had, by that Means, many Times escap'd hanging&#146;. And if Evans was doing no more than retail street gossip or tell the writer what he thought he wanted to hear, the latter noted that at the trial,<blockquote>it look'd as if the Lord Chief Justice thought H. had then brib'd the R&#151;r for his Speeches in his Favour: For he reproached him for it with such a Shew of Contempt, as one would scarcely use to a Slave. (<span class="italic">British Journal</span>, 1 May 1725, 1)</blockquote>This account, made many years later, receives some support from the bare record of the case in the Middlesex sessions rolls, while Hatfield is elsewhere identified as helping Connell in an attempted extortion by helping him frame someone with a theft. And Hatfield was at the least remarkably lucky: a frequent defendant at the Old Bailey in the years around 1700, he survived to die in Newgate in 1725, while other men and women no more guilty than he had been hanged long before.<br>
<br>Ultimately, it can never be known whether Lovell took bribes from the thief-takers. He undoubtedly looked to them for many prosecutions. He inevitably knew these men: they came to him with accusations seeking arrest warrants (though he was certainly not the only magistrate they resorted to), and his signature appears on the depositions they made and on the bonds to prosecute that they took out. In May 1693 he threw his weight behind the petition for reward of Anthony Dunn and Anthony St Leger as men &#145;Eminently Serviceable to the Government&#146; in the prosecution of clippers and coiners, who had &#145;Apprehended prosecuted and Convicted near Forty such notorious Offenders&#146;  (TNA: PRO, T1/22, fol. 152<i>v</i>). He failed to mention that they were also convicts who had been pardoned only the previous January in the pardon which had so concerned the court of aldermen. They went on to be leading thief-takers, frequently bringing their accusations to Lovell. In 1698 the forger William Chaloner alleged that he was being pursued by Lovell and his thief-catchers.<br>
<br>Lovell's relationship with thief-takers provided grounds for his own claim to be a vigorous crime fighter as much as it did for his critics' charge of corruption. The combination of policing, judicial, and pardoning functions offered an active recorder both a powerful weapon against crime and the opportunity for favour and corruption. Doubts about his partiality in pardoning evidently stemmed from how he exercised this range of powers in his dealings with thief-takers and (at the least) high-profile examples of its deployment on behalf of particular offenders such as Dunn, St Leger, and Hatfield. The institution of statutory rewards (against highwaymen in 1693 and especially against coiners in 1695) encouraged reservations about the motives of prosecutors, especially when the offence was the apparently &#145;victimless&#146; one of coining, where thief-takers were particularly prominent in obtaining convictions. The relationship between Lovell and the thief-takers was mutually beneficial. They could provide him with names, information, and prisoners at the bar, using their influence within, and knowledge of, the capital's criminal networks. In turn, Lovell could protect them and their clients, in practice upholding their authority by allowing them to demonstrate their powerful connections. Lovell was neither the first nor last recorder to work with thief-takers, and some degree of horse-trading with criminal contacts is no doubt an essential part of policing in any period. Nevertheless, Lovell and the thief-takers exploited the particular opportunities provided by the anxieties and reforms of the 1690s. The evidence of his relationship with the thief-takers is consistent with either outright bribery or with favour derived from sacrificing the stricter tenets of justice to the demands of policing the city, which mainly required that the authorities inflict exemplary punishment on some individuals, while at the same time acquiring a sense of the criminal networks of the capital. These readings of Lovell's behaviour&#151;outright corruption or a ruthlessly pragmatic partiality&#151;need not be mutually exclusive.<h2>
<a name="Baronoftheexchequer"></a>Baron of the exchequer</h2>Lovell himself claimed in 1702 that the recordership was &#145;a place of great trouble &amp; little profitt&#146; and that he had &#145;long served the public at his own charge, to the damage of his fortune&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calendar of Treasury Papers, 1697&#150;1702</span>, 561, 89), although in declaring his salary to be only &pound;80 per annum he omitted both the City's annual 100 guinea gratuity and the &pound;100 a year he received for the Chester and Welsh judgeships. The king accepted that Lovell &#145;hath been a great loser by that servis&#146;, noting that recorders were usually quickly promoted to a judgeship in the great common-law courts of Westminster Hall  (ibid., 562). Lovell's career had stalled. In June 1700 he was expected to succeed Sir Nicholas Lechmere as baron of the exchequer, but the king opposed his appointment because he had impeded his attempts to woo the tories by refusing to make way for Sir Bartholomew Shower as recorder. Five years later it was noted that Lovell &#145;is pushing hard for the Judge's place and is like to have it&#146;, but that the plan to appoint his intended replacement, upon which his promotion depended, was unlikely to pass the court of aldermen  (<span class="italic">Downshire MSS</span>, 1.842).<br>
<br>By now Lovell was in his seventies. As early as 1693 Jacobites gleefully retailed his unfortunate choice of words at the trial of highwayman James Whitney, condemning him for his cruelty in shedding Christian blood by shooting his pursuers' horses from under them. As he grew older, other stories accrued around his alleged senility: that he should be called Obliviscor (&#145;forgetter&#146;) rather than recorder. His great-grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8478/', "Richard Lovell Edgeworth")</script> told a story of Salathiel inadvertently condemning his failing memory out of his own mouth. When a young lawyer protested that Lovell had forgotten the law on a certain point, he replied, &#145;Young man, I have forgotten more law than you will ever remember&#146; (a story which, however, has been told about several judges). In 1707 Lovell resigned the Chester and Welsh judgeships. However, in June 1708 he was finally promoted and sworn in as an additional baron of the exchequer when John Smith was appointed to serve in the newly created Scottish court of exchequer. Lovell's new position carried a salary of &pound;1000 per annum. He resigned the recordership and was succeeded by Peter King. He continued to advise on matters of crime, writing to the Treasury in October 1709 about rewards for the conviction of burglars.<br>
<br>While on the western circuit in April 1710 Lovell's charge to the grand jury at the Devon assizes was in large part a rant against the high Anglican toryism of Henry Sacheverell and the riots which had accompanied the latter's trial. Intemperate and intellectually somewhat incoherent, it is interesting for what it says about Lovell's lifelong politics. He drew on the classic seventeenth-century smear of identifying the political threat of popery&#151;&#145;A Wild Fire is running about, to the great Disturbance of the Peace. And whence comes it? From Priests and Jesuits&#146;  (Lamoine, 77). In his contempt for the high Anglican doctrine of passive obedience to the monarch, Sir Salathiel was very much the son of the martial Benjamin Lovell, very much the man who had advised Thomas Hunt on booksellers:<blockquote>I would ask you of all those, that cry up the Doctrine of Passive Obedience what they mean; or what Necessity there is for trumping up that damnable Doctrine? Many may say I am hot; I am fervent as the Subject on which I am requires. I doubt not, but some may still remember the dismal Consequences of it some 60 Years ago and upwards. Or at least most of you have heard the deplorable Calamities it drew upon this Nation. (ibid., 78)</blockquote>Lovell died on 3 May 1713, aged eighty-one, and was buried at Harleston ten days later. His widow, Mary, survived him by six years, dying on 9 December 1719, aged seventy-seven. Their son Samuel had become a Welsh judge, but like all but one of the Lovells' sons did not outlive his parents, although at least two of their daughters shared their longevity.<br>
