<span class="headword">Mountbatten <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ashley]</span>, Dame  Edwina Cynthia Annette</span>, Countess Mountbatten of Burma  (1901&#150;1960), <span class="occ">director of emergency relief services and vicereine of India</span>, was born at 32 Bruton Street, London, on 28 November 1901, the elder of the two daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30471/', "Wilfrid William Ashley, Baron Mount Temple of Lee (1867&#150;1939)")</script>, politician, and his first wife, Amalia Mary Maud 
    (Maudie; 1879&#150;1911)
  , only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32323/', "Sir Ernest Cassel")</script>, financier and philanthropist. Edward VII, her grandfather's friend and client, was her godfather, and she was nearly christened Edwardina.<br>
<br>Edwina's childhood was lonely, with an ailing mother, a distracted father, and, from 1914, a determined stepmother whom Edwina and her sister, Mary, found it hard to like. Cassel was Edwina's mainstay; at eighteen, after two years at boarding-school and six months in Italy, she went to live with her grandfather in London at Brook House, his palace in Park Lane. When he died in 1921 Edwina inherited Brook House and the greater part of Cassel's immense fortune. Edwina was now adrift, with nothing to do and, until she was of age, no access to her money. Of all her friends the most sympathetic was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31480/', "Lord Louis (Dickie) Mountbatten (1900&#150;1979)")</script>, whose adored father had died in the same week as Sir Ernest. Mountbatten, a lieutenant in the Royal Navy, and younger son of admiral of the fleet the marquess of Milford Haven, formerly Prince Louis of Battenberg, was ambitious, good-looking, and energetic. Despite the misgivings of his mother, Victoria, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, who thought them both too young and her son too poor, on 18 July 1922 they were married.<br>
<br>Edwina had beauty, wealth, restless energy, and quick intelligence. A woman of extremes, she was jealous of her husband's professional success and of the attention he gave the navy. She consoled herself first with lovers, then with increasingly exotic and testing journeys across the globe, leaving her children, Patricia (<i>b</i>. 1924) and Pamela (<i>b</i>. 1929), in the care of nurses and governesses, Dickie's mother, and Dickie himself.<br>
<br>The war saved the Mountbattens' stormy marriage. At last Edwina's skills and energies were fully tested. Rejected at first by disapproving matrons, she eventually became deputy chairman of the Depot for Knitted Garments for the Navy. Her dedication won respect; that, and her connections, brought her to the Joint War Organization of the Red Cross and the order of St John, where she proved a brilliant administrator, tirelessly visiting bombed cities and shelters across Britain, military camps, and hospitals at home and overseas. Appointed superintendent-in-chief of the St John Ambulance Brigade in 1942, she worked closely with her husband, now chief of combined operations, for the welfare of servicemen and their families.<br>
<br>Edwina's greatest contribution came in the aftermath of war. As supreme allied commander south-east Asia, Mountbatten had, in the wake of the Japanese surrender, formidable military and civil responsibility over vast and scattered territory. Edwina assembled teams and equipment to locate and rescue thousands of internees and prisoners of war, venturing at great risk into swamps and jungle. For this and later work she was appointed GCStJ (1945), DCVO (1946), GBE (1947), and CI (1947).<br>
<br>Exhausted, Edwina longed, uncharacteristically, for tranquil family life at Broadlands, the house in Hampshire that had once belonged to Lord Palmerston, which Edwina had inherited from her father in 1939, together with Classiebawn Castle, in co. Sligo. In January 1947, however, Mountbatten was asked to go to India as viceroy to negotiate and achieve the independence of the subcontinent. Impatient with hierarchy and convention, Edwina brought a fresh breeze to the huge enterprise of the viceroy's household, opening it to people of every sort. Her links helped her to inform Mountbatten and his staff as they sought to resolve innumerable difficulties arising from the imminent independence and, inescapably, separation of India and Pakistan. Partition brought bloodshed, as whole populations fled across the country, their meeting places killing grounds. With Edwina at its head, the United Council of Relief and Welfare, co-ordinating all the major voluntary organizations, struggled to help the desperate refugees.<br>
<br>In these demanding times Edwina grew close to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35191/', "Jawaharlal Nehru")</script>, prime minister of India. Six weeks before the Mountbattens' departure in 1948, their task complete, Edwina and Nehru acknowledged the depth of their feelings for each other. For the remaining twelve years of her life they wrote constantly, with rare meetings in England and India. This association, and Edwina's known anti-colonial sympathy, assisted Mountbatten's political opponents. His appointment in 1955 as first sea lord, long sought, was triumphant. Proud of each other's success, loyal, and affectionate, the Mountbattens' partnership at last achieved equilibrium.<br>
<br>Unremitting work as superintendent-in-chief of the St John Ambulance Brigade, with the Save the Children Fund and some hundred other voluntary organizations, wore Edwina out and she died in her sleep at Jesselton, North Borneo, on the night of 20&#150;21 February 1960. As she had wished, she was buried at sea, off Portsmouth, with naval honours, escorted by an Indian warship sent by Nehru.<br>
