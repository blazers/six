<span class="headword">Nicholson,  Reynold Alleyne</span>  (1868&#150;1945), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, was born at Keighley, Yorkshire, on 19 August 1868, the eldest of the five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20136/', "Henry Alleyne Nicholson (1844&#150;1899)")</script> and his wife, Isabella Hutchison, from Kirkcaldy in Fife. His father, then a practising surgeon, later became professor of natural history at the universities of St Andrews and Aberdeen. Nicholson went to school in these two cities and from Aberdeen University entered Trinity College, Cambridge, as a pensioner in 1887. After being awarded the Porson prize for Greek verse in his first year he became a scholar of his college, and in 1890 obtained a first class in part one of the classical tripos and again won the Porson prize. Although he dropped to a third class in part two (1891) he gained a first in the Indian languages tripos in 1892.<br>
<br>Nicholson's interest in oriental languages was first stimulated in the library of his grandfather, the biblical scholar John Nicholson, from whom he inherited a collection of Arabic and Persian manuscripts. It was fostered by E. G. Browne, with whom he read Persian, and by short periods of study at Leiden and Strasbourg, where he read Arabic with Michael Jan de Goeje and Theodor N&ouml;ldeke. His election to a fellowship at Trinity in 1893 opened the partnership with Browne which lasted until the latter's death in 1926. Except for one year's tenure of the chair of Persian at University College, London, in 1901&#150;2, the whole of Nicholson's academic career was spent in Cambridge. He returned there to succeed Browne first as lecturer in Persian (1902&#150;26), then in 1926 (when he was also re-elected fellow of Trinity) as Sir Thomas Adams's professor of Arabic.<br>
<br>From the first, Nicholson was strongly attracted to the literature of Sufism. For his fellowship thesis he made a selection from the mystical odes of Rumi called <span class="italic">D&#299;v&#257;ni Shamsi Tabr&#299;z</span>, the publication of which, with translation and annotation, in 1898 placed him at once in the front rank of oriental scholarship. Between 1905 and 1914 he published editions or translations of four major works on Sufism, two in Persian (&#145;Attar's <span class="italic">Tadhkiratu 'l-awliy&aacute;</span>, 2 vols., 1905&#150;7, and <span class="italic">Kashf al-mahj&uacute;b</span> of Hujwiri, 1911) and two in Arabic (Ibn al-&#145;Arabi's odes, <span class="italic">Tarjum&aacute;n al-ashw&aacute;q</span>, 1911, and <span class="italic">Kit&aacute;b al-lum</span> of al-Sarraj, 1914), besides various collaborations with Browne. In 1914 he summed up his studies in a manual for the general reader, <span class="italic">The Mystics of Islam</span>. Meanwhile he had written his <span class="italic">Literary History of the Arabs</span> (1907), a personal appreciation of Arabic literature, which became a standard text. He also issued an annotated series of Arabic readers (1907&#150;11).<br>
<br>Nicholson's publications resumed after the war with two important volumes, <span class="italic">Studies in Islamic Poetry</span> and <span class="italic">Studies in Islamic Mysticism</span> (both 1921), supplemented in 1923 by a small but significant work entitled <span class="italic">The Idea of Personality in Sufism</span>. His major project in this period was a complete critical edition with translation and annotation of the <span class="italic">Mathnaw&iacute;</span> of Rumi, the greatest literary achievement of Persian mysticism. Eighteen years of sustained industry enabled him to issue between 1925 and 1940 the eight volumes he had planned; a final volume, intended to sum up Rumi's life and work and his place in the history of Sufism, remained unwritten.<br>
<br>Nicholson's work on Sufism was considered the greatest single contribution made by a European scholar to the subject. He was responsible for opening up one of the major developments of human thought for both specialists and the lay reader, transforming the understanding of it by presenting its major products with rare imagination and literary taste, as well as with careful scholarship. He himself was gifted with poetic sensibility and talent. In earlier years he wrote light verse, some of which he reprinted in <span class="italic">The Don and the Dervish</span> (1911), and in 1922 he published a volume of <span class="italic">Translations of Eastern Poetry and Prose</span>.<br>
<br>Nicholson was an honorary LLD of Aberdeen (1913), a fellow of the British Academy (1922), gold medallist of the Royal Asiatic Society (1938), and an associate member of the Persian Academy. In outward manner he was reserved and in public speech he was diffident, but as a teacher he was kind and sympathetic, and regarded with affection. His chief recreation was golf, and as an undergraduate he played in the Cambridge team against Oxford. In 1903 he married his first cousin, Cecilia, daughter of Thomas Varty, of Penrith; there were no children. After retiring in 1933 he continued to take an interest in the oriental school until in 1940 failing health and eyesight forced him into retreat in north Wales. He died at Fairholme Nursing Home, Woodlands Road, Saltney, Chester, on 27 August 1945. He was survived by his wife.<br>
