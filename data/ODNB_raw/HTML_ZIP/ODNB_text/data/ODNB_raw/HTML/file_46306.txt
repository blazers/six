<span class="headword">Tennant <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Eroles]</span>,  Mariquita Dorotea Francesca</span>  (1811&#150;1860), <span class="occ">social reformer</span>, was born on 1 November 1811, the daughter of Don Antonio Eroles of Barcelona, an army officer. Her sister, Rosa Florentina Eroles, married Francis Beaufort Edgeworth (<i>d</i>. 1841), the half-brother of the novelist Maria Edgeworth. Mariquita Eroles was married twice, firstly to David Reid (1807&#150;1835), fourth son of Andrew and Janet Reid of Lyonsdown near Barnet. They lived in Florence and had a daughter, Mary. After David Reid's death in November 1835 his widow remained in Florence, where she married the Revd Robert John Tennant (<i>d</i>. 1842), Anglican chaplain to the British congregation there. The marriage, which may have been the occasion for her conversion from Catholicism to Anglicanism, was short-lived. Robert Tennant died in July 1842, and after remaining a few months more in Florence, Mariquita Tennant joined her widowed sister at the Edgeworth's family home, Edgeworthstown, in Ireland.<br>
<br>By the end of 1848 Mariquita Tennant was living at The Limes, a medieval house belonging to her sister, situated near St Andrew's Church in the village of Clewer, near Windsor. On 29 December 1848 she gave refuge to a young woman called Marianne George who had been abused by her stepfather, the father of her four children. Tennant intended simply to remove her from her surroundings and train her as a servant, but the rector of Clewer, Thomas Thellusson Carter (1808&#150;1901), was anxious to provide a safe refuge for other women in moral danger. Not only was Windsor a garrison town, but two railway companies were bringing their lines into the town, and there were many itinerant workers. Mariquita Tennant therefore offered to help any women wishing to escape from the beerhouses and brothels of Clewer Fields, a notorious slum area not far from Windsor Castle. On 14 June 1849 she admitted two more young women to her house. Both had sought refuge in Clewer Fields but, hearing of Mariquita Tennant, they approached her and were taken to The Limes. Others followed, so that very soon there were more than a dozen, with numbers continuing to increase.<br>
<br>Clearly Mariquita Tennant could not cope with so many women single-handedly: many of them were unruly and some violent. Within a strict disciplinary framework she endeavoured to teach them basic domestic skills interspersed with religious instruction. As the work proceeded she began to cherish the notion of founding a religious sisterhood (of which she would be the self-styled lady superior), similar to that founded by E. B. Pusey at Park Village West. To that end she adapted the Park Village rule to suit her own needs. That the sisterhood never became a reality was due to the lack of reliable volunteers. Indeed, her only really committed helper was Charlotte Julia Weale (1829&#150;1918), who came to Clewer in February 1850 for a period of six months. During her time at the Clewer house of mercy Charlotte Weale kept comprehensive notebooks detailing the case histories of the women, the daily timetable, and religious instructions. She also kept copies of correspondence between Tennant and supporters of her work, such as Elizabeth Herbert (1822&#150;1911) and W. E. Gladstone, in whom Mariquita Tennant found a kindred spirit. Their mutual concern for a young woman called Emma Clifton led Tennant (despite her poor health) to travel to London and personally seek her out in the hope of bringing her back to Clewer&#151;a mission which ultimately proved fruitless.<br>
<br>It is clear from Charlotte Weale's writings that Mariquita Tennant was not an easy person to work with, which is probably why none of her helpers stayed very long. This, in addition to the difficulty of establishing and maintaining order and discipline within the house, took its toll on Mariquita Tennant's health. There was also the stress of finding alternative accommodation, The Limes having been a temporary measure. But in February 1851 the house of mercy finally moved to a large house in Hatch Lane, Clewer, called Nightingale Place, which had a 15 acre estate. By this time Tennant had already resolved to resign, and finally left in April 1851.<br>
<br>Following her retirement from the house of mercy, Mariquita Tennant withdrew to her private home, Trinity House, in Windsor, where she lived with her daughter Mary in increasingly poor health. When well enough she attended Holy Trinity Church close by, and shortly before her death she opened a meeting-room in Bier Lane not far from Clewer Fields, which was known as Our Room. She died on 21 February 1860 at 9 Claremont Road, Clewer, after a short illness, prematurely aged and worn out. She was buried in Clewer churchyard within sight of The Limes. A visitor to Clewer in 1864 described her gravestone as representing an open coffin containing a <span class="roman">Bible</span> and a cross on top of an empty shroud, with the words &#145;Non est hic, sed resurrexit&#146; (Not here, but risen) carved inside the open lid. This ornate memorial was later replaced with a simple stone cross.<br>
<br>Mariquita Tennant was an enigmatic woman whom history has bypassed. She was a pioneer in the great wave of moral rescue work begun in the mid-nineteenth century and later undertaken by the religious communities which sprang from the Oxford Movement. The Clewer house of mercy which she left behind in Hatch Lane evolved quite differently under the wise, gentle, but firm guidance of Harriet Monsell (1811&#150;1883). Nor was the quasi-sisterhood envisioned by Mariquita Tennant in any way like the Community of St John Baptist which took over her work. But though she cannot claim to have founded a religious community, she can rightly be credited with the foundation of a religious work in the house of mercy; she was the forerunner of all who followed at Clewer.<br>
