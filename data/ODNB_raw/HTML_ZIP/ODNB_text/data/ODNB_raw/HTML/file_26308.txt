<span class="headword">Stapleton,  Thomas</span>  (1806&#150;1849), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, born on 16 October 1806, was the second of the five sons (there were also three daughters) of Thomas Stapleton (1788&#150;1839) of Carlton Hall, Yorkshire, and his first wife, Maria Juliana (<i>d</i>. 1827), daughter of Sir Robert Gerard, ninth baronet. His elder brother, Miles Thomas Stapleton, was the eighth Baron Beaumont. On the death of his father he succeeded to some landed property near Richmond, Yorkshire. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 15 January 1839, and, being a close friend of John Gage Rokewode, its director, he took a keen interest in the society's operations. He was one of its vice-presidents from 1846 to 1850. His most important literary work was his introduction to and edition of the rolls of the Norman exchequer, printed by the Society of Antiquaries as <span class="italic">Magni rotuli scaccarii Normanniae sub regibus Angliae</span> (2 vols., 1841&#150;4), which 150 years later remains the authoritative edition of these important twelfth-century records. He also contributed several papers to <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, the Society of Antiquaries' journal. At the meeting of the Archaeological Institute at York in 1846 he read a long memoir on the secular canons of the church of the Holy Trinity, otherwise Christ Church, in York, and its conversion into a priory of Benedictine monks.<br>
<br>Stapleton became a fellow of the Royal Society. He was also one of the founders of the Camden Society, and undertook one of its earliest works, <span class="italic">The Plumpton Correspondence</span> (1839), an important collection of fifteenth-century letters known partially from seventeenth-century transcripts. He edited for the same society in 1846 the chronicle of London from 1178 to 1274, entitled <span class="italic">De antiquis legibus liber</span> and the <span class="italic">Chronicon Petroburgense</span>, which ill health prevented him from completing as he would have wished. It was later issued after the addition of an introduction by a second editor, John Bruce. It was reprinted in 1968. Stapleton died unmarried at Cromwell Cottage, Old Brompton, London, on 4 December 1849.<br>
