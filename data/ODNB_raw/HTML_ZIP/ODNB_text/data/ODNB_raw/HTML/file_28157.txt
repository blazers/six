<span class="headword">Vautor,  Thomas</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1592&#150;1619), <span class="occ">composer</span>, first appears as a household musician in the family of Mary Beaumont of Glenfield, Leicestershire. On her first marriage in 1592 he passed into the service of her husband, Sir George Villiers, at Brooksby. Following Sir George's death in 1606, his widow moved with her sons to Goadby, also in Leicestershire, where on 19 June she married Sir William Rayner, who himself died four months later. She subsequently married Sir Thomas Compton. In 1616 Vautor was admitted BMus at Oxford. By this time Lady Compton's son, George Villiers, was rising in the king's favour; upon his creation as marquess of Buckingham in 1618 Vautor dedicated to him his only collection of madrigals, entitled <span class="italic">The first set: being songs of divers ayres and natures, of five and six parts: apt for viols and voices</span> (1619).<br>
<br>This volume contains Vautor's only known music, but it suffices to reveal him as one of the most interesting minor composers of this rich period in English music. Its twenty-two items are markedly varied and, as Vautor's preface makes clear, were composed over an extended period, some pieces dating from its dedicatee's &#145;tender yeares&#146;. These probably include the three lively <i>ballets</i> that open the collection, and which are in a typical 1590s style. Vautor was not a contributor to <span class="italic">The Triumphs of Oriana</span> (1601), the collection of madrigals published in honour of the ageing Queen Elizabeth, but &#145;Shepherds and nymphs&#146;, included in his own collection and ending &#145;Farewell, fair Oriana&#146;, is a posthumous tribute to that sovereign. Two pieces are explicit elegies, the first a pair of madrigals, &#145;Melpomene, bewail&#146; with &#145;Whilst fatal sisters&#146;, for Prince Henry (<i>d</i>. 1612), the second &#145;Weep, weep, mine eyes&#146;, for Sir Thomas Beaumont of Stoughton, Leicestershire (<i>d</i>. 1614); curiously, both are viol-accompanied duets in an antiquated &#145;grave&#146; style more characteristic of early Elizabethan music, though the former concludes with a six-voice, madrigalian-style chorus that is thoroughly up-to-date. In the sharpest contrast to these sober pieces is &#145;Mother, I will have a husband&#146;, a torrent of babble from a girl intent on matrimony at all costs.<br>
<br>The remaining pieces further reveal Vautor's range and quality&#151;some of them may be counted among the finest of English madrigals. To name but two: &#145;Sweet Suffolk owl&#146;, whose initial chattering declamation and lively word painting are deftly balanced by its conclusion's haunting melancholy, and the pair of madrigals, &#145;Lock up, fair lids&#146; with &#145;And yet, O dream&#146; (a setting of a sonnet by Sir Philip Sidney), impressive for its often spacious paragraphs laced with quietly expressive dissonance, and its masterly use of chromaticism and word painting. Nothing is known of Vautor after the publication of his madrigal volume.<br>
