<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Knightley, Sir  Richard</span>  (1533&#150;1615), <span class="occ">politician and patron of puritans</span>, was the eldest son of Sir Valentine Knightley of Fawsley, Northamptonshire, and his wife, Anne, the daughter of Edward Ferrers of Warwickshire. The family fortunes were based on sheep farming, for which the lands on their estates were enclosed, and on the death of his father in 1566 Sir Richard inherited an extensive property said to be worth &pound;13,000 a year. By that date he had already moved into the circle of Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, who knighted him at Kenilworth in 1565 during the royal progress there. Knightley's religious sympathies with the puritans were already apparent, and in 1567 he was among other associates of Leicester granted a patent as governors of the property of ministers of the gospel in Warwickshire, an initiative which created a fund to support preaching clergy. Knightley married first, in 1556, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1573), the daughter of Sir Richard Fermor; they had three sons and three daughters. His second wife was Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1603), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25159/', "Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset")</script>; they had seven sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Knightley's social position soon secured for him a central role in the government of his own county; he was a regular member of the bench, and was appointed sheriff in 1568, 1581, and 1589. He was deputy lieutenant of the county and heavily involved in militia and musters through into his eighties, disrupted briefly by removal from office following his support for those puritan ministers unwilling to subscribe to the canons of 1604. This was not the first occasion, however, on which his puritan sympathies had brought him into conflict with authority. In 1581 Knightley, in association with Leicester, endowed a lectureship at Towcester for Andrew King, one of the ministers deprived during the vestiarian controversy; King had been active in the town since at least 1574. But it was the radical preaching at nearby Southam five years earlier, in 1576, that had drawn the attention of the privy council. The exercise there was said to attract local justices, and it is certain that Knightley was involved, as some of those attending sermons at Southam were also accused of gadding to sermons at Fawsley. The suppression of the exercises marked a watershed in Elizabethan religious history, but Knightley continued to support puritan clergy in those parishes where he was patron, and to use his influence in the county to secure other livings for godly ministers.<br>
<br>Knightley took these concerns with him when elected to parliament as member for Northampton in 1584, and when he served on committees dealing with church attendance and pluralism. In the parliament of 1586 he was on the committee which drew up the unsuccessful petition for reform of the ministry. Knightley shared the strong anti-papist views of his fellow puritans, being present at the execution of Anthony Babington in 1586 and the execution and funeral of Mary, queen of Scots the following year, though he remained sympathetic to his Catholic neighbours. By the late 1580s hopes for further reform of the church through parliament had receded and the puritans adopted an alternative strategy of local initiatives, whereby clergy were organized into classes, in order to bring about their aims. Northamptonshire became a noted centre of this movement, and many of Knightley's clerical appointees were involved. Another crisis ensued, with the clerical leadership being tried before Star Chamber in 1591. By then Knightley had himself been arraigned before that body because of his involvement in the publication of the Marprelate tracts. Knightley was actually in London during August 1588, attending to militia business relating to the Armada when the Marprelate press was removed from East Molesey to a building on his estate at Fawsley. He later claimed to have had no knowledge of the printing of <span class="italic">The Epitome</span>, which took place there over the following months, but several of his servants were implicated in both the printing and distribution of the books. By the end of the year Knightley had arranged for the removal of the Marprelate press to the Coventry house of his nephew, John Hales. While this was taking place Knightley's standing with the council remained high, and with the support of the lord chancellor, Sir Christopher Hatton, who was also lord lieutenant of Northamptonshire, he was elected as MP for the county in autumn 1588. In contrast to previous sessions Knightley played no part in the commissions dealing with religious affairs in this parliament, and after its dissolution he returned to his work as deputy lieutenant. The discovery of copies of the Marprelate tracts in the possession of Knightley's servant, who was carrying them to his master's brother-in-law, the earl of Hertford, resulted in Knightley's imprisonment in the Fleet in November 1589. He was tried before his friend Hatton who, with Archbishop Whitgift, interceded with the queen to procure his release from gaol on payment of a fine of &pound;2000.<br>
<br>By the end of 1591 Knightley had resumed his county responsibilities, sitting on several commissions. By that date the classis movement had been disbanded, and puritan activists subsequently adopted a less overtly political agenda. Along with several other local gentry Knightley continued to support puritan ministers in the area, and his status locally, reflected in his re-election as MP for the county in 1597, offered them protection. By this time the family estates had been diminished, due in part to the extravagance of his elder sons, Valentine and Edward, and this occasioned complicated settlements which were also designed to protect the interests of his second wife, Elizabeth, and her children. This marriage placed Knightley on the fringes of the succession question, and he was given custody of his nephew Viscount Beauchamp following the latter's involvement in the Essex conspiracy, but there was no truth in the rumour that he proclaimed his nephew king on the death of Elizabeth. The accession of James revived the religious debates, and in 1605 Knightley joined other county gentry in a petition supporting those puritan ministers who were being prosecuted for their failure to subscribe to the canons of 1604. With his old friend Sir Edward Montague, and another old campaigner, Sir Francis Hastings, Knightley was fined before Star Chamber and removed from the deputy lieutenancy and the commission of the peace; but he was soon restored to his local offices, maintaining an active presence until his death. His support for puritans also continued, and Fawsley became the home of John Dod, the celebrated preacher and catechist, at this time. Knightley died at Fawsley on 1 September 1615.<br>
