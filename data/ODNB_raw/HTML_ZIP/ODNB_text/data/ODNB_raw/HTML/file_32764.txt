</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Debenham,  Frank</span>  (1883&#150;1965), <span class="occ">geographer and polar scientist</span>, was born at Bowral, New South Wales, on 26 December 1883, the second son of the Revd John Willmott Debenham, vicar of Bowral and schoolmaster, and his wife, Edith Cleveland. He attended the school run by his father and, after his death in 1898, by his mother, and from there went to the King's School, Parramatta (1900&#150;02), and Sydney University (1902&#150;6) from where he graduated BA in arts. He then taught at Armidale School, before re-entering Sydney University in 1908 and graduating BSc in 1910, having majored in geology. Edgeworth David, who was then professor, had been with Sir Ernest Shackleton in the Antarctic between 1907 and 1909. When Robert Falcon Scott was recruiting for his second (<i>Terra Nova</i>) expedition in 1910 he wished to associate Australia with it and, having secured Griffith Taylor in London, when in Sydney asked Debenham to join him.<br>
<br>In the Antarctic Debenham's work, geological and cartographical, was done first (1910&#150;11) on the western side of McMurdo Sound. He visited the Koettlitz glacier, the Ferrar glacier, and other features in the foothills of the Royal Society range. An injury to his knee sustained while playing football prevented his going on the ill-fated polar attempt and in 1911&#150;12 he went to Granite harbour and the Mackay glacier. One of his most significant contributions to the work of the expedition, and subsequently to his pupils at Cambridge, was his expertise in plane-table mapping. He convinced Scott and other members of the expedition of its value not only at base camps but also on sledge journeys. Scott in his diary recorded that Debenham was &#145;a well-trained, sturdy worker, with a quiet meaning that carries conviction; he realizes the conceptions of thoroughness and conscientiousness&#146;.<br>
<br>After leaving the Antarctic in 1913 Debenham went with other members of the expedition to Cambridge to work up his results. He graduated BA in 1919 and MA in 1922. His studies were interrupted by the outbreak of war in 1914. He joined the 7th battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire light infantry, and after service in France and then Salonika, where he was severely wounded and shell-shocked, he was demobilized as a major and returned to Cambridge.<br>
<br>In 1919 Debenham was appointed to the Royal Geographical Society's lectureship in surveying and cartography at Cambridge. In 1919 he was elected into a fellowship at Gonville and Caius College, where he was a tutor (1923&#150;8). In the immediate post-war years the geographical tripos was founded and in addition to continuing his Antarctic work Debenham gave himself wholeheartedly to the building up of the department.<br>
<br>By that time Debenham was the only surviving member of the Antarctic expedition who had both the local knowledge and the cartographic expertise to complete the charts. In 1921 he co-wrote two reports on the geology of Antarctica and later wrote his <span class="italic">Report on the Maps and Surveys</span> of the <i>Terra Nova</i> expedition (1923). His maps were still in use in the late 1950s. His suggestion that some of the Scott Mansion House fund should be used to build an institute for polar research was accepted and he was appointed director in 1926. In 1934 the Scott Polar Research Institute was opened, and it owed much to the enterprise and planning of Debenham. The institute took on its later enlarged form after his death, but he delighted in the gift from the Ford Foundation for the great addition to the original building, although he himself was not wholly reconciled to the fact that polar exploration had ceased to be the preserve of the amateur and had been taken over by sustained government-funded research.<br>
<br>The department of geography expanded continuously from its foundation. Debenham became a reader and head of department in 1928 and was primarily responsible for its move to Downing Place. During its expansion after 1933 Debenham's skill and interest as a planner were again invoked. In 1928 the twelfth international geographical congress was held in part in Cambridge and Debenham acted as secretary of the executive committee. In 1931 he became the first professor of geography in Cambridge. The new department was in full use by 1936, and during the Second World War its activities were numerous. Debenham had a great gift for teaching practical survey methods and making and recording astronomical and other observations. Apart from his normal teaching which still continued, he was notably successful in training a large number of service cadets who were attached for six-month courses. Two of the London departments were also billeted in Cambridge and with Debenham's help and encouragement found a welcome and temporary home there. Meanwhile, the Scott Polar Research Institute housed a section of the naval intelligence division of the Admiralty. He retired as director in 1946.<br>
<br>After the war unprecedented numbers of students came to the department of geography and these years, until Debenham's retirement in 1949, were perhaps the most satisfying of all, because they showed so clearly his role in making Cambridge a leading world centre for both geography and polar research.<br>
<br>After retirement Debenham for some years was very active. He travelled extensively in central Africa and made an interesting study of the water resources of the Bangweulu swamp. Debenham's flair for teaching, planning, and inspiring students and colleagues in their academic work and explorations was universally acknowledged in his lifetime and in the tributes which appeared after his death. Curiously, however, they somehow obscured the significance of his own writing and editorial work which was sustained and solid. He published numerous papers and books of which the most scientifically important were the early reports of his Antarctic work, which appeared at a formative time for glaciology. His books included <span class="italic">The Polar Regions</span> (1930), <span class="italic">In the Antarctic</span> (1952), and <span class="italic">Antarctica; the Story of a Continent</span> (1959), and he edited Bellingshausen's <span class="italic">Antarctic Narrative</span> for the Hakluyt Society in 1945. He was the founding editor of the <span class="italic">Polar Record</span> (1913). He also wrote teaching texts in geography and cartography and contributed largely to the high-quality and innovative relief maps in the Reader's Digest <span class="italic">Great World Atlas</span> (1961).<br>
<br>Lord McNair said that Debenham<blockquote>was one of the most modest and unselfregarding persons that I have ever known &hellip; He was a good organizer and knew how to get the best out of those working with him&#151;mainly because he was generous in giving credit to others and because he inspired their affection and confidence. (address, memorial service)</blockquote>He respected and encouraged scholarship in others, and the tributes paid after his death show him to have been almost universally liked.Debenham had an extremely happy domestic life. On 27 January 1917 at St Philip's parish church, Kensington, he married Dorothy Lucy, daughter of J. T. Lempriere of Melbourne; they had two sons and four daughters. He and his wife (Deb and Mrs Deb) were most hospitable and gave a memorable welcome to former colleagues and students. In the last years of his life he suffered from heart trouble and deafness and spent much of his time at his desk, but was always glad to talk to friends for a short time.<br>
<br>In 1919 Debenham was appointed OBE. In 1948 he received the Victoria medal of the Royal Geographical Society of which he was a fellow (from 1914), vice-president (1951&#150;3), and honorary fellow (from 1965). He received the David Livingstone centenary medal of the American Geographical Society in 1948, and he received honorary degrees from the universities of Sydney (1959), Western Australia (1937), and Durham (1952).<br>
<br>Debenham died in the Evelyn Nursing Home, Cambridge, on 23 November 1965. He is commemorated by two buildings at Cambridge, and a mountain and a glacier in Antarctica were named after him. He was survived by his wife.<br>
