<span class="headword">Smythson,  Robert</span>  (1534/5&#150;1614), <span class="occ">master mason and architect</span>, was aged seventy-nine when he died in 1614, according to his memorial tablet in the parish church at Wollaton, Nottinghamshire, but neither the date nor the place of his birth is known. In the 1660s, at the time of the heralds' visitation of Derbyshire, his great-grandson John Smythson stated that he had &#145;Armes belonging to his family of Westmorland&#146;. No arms or descent was subsequently registered, but it is possible that Robert was connected with the Smythsons who were tenant farmers in Crosthwaite and Crosby Ravensworth in Westmorland, and who were certainly not armigerous. The fact that his memorial carries the arms of the Masons' Company of London suggests that it was in and around London that he served his apprenticeship, acquired experience, and learned to draw.<br>
<br>Smythson's first recorded appearance is at Longleat House, Wiltshire, where he went to work for Sir John Thynne as a master mason in March 1568. He brought with him his own group of masons and a letter of introduction from Humphrey Lovell, the queen's master mason, according to which he had previously been working for Sir Francis Knollys, probably at Caversham House, near Reading. Smythson stayed at Longleat on and off until 1580. Together with a French master mason, Alan Maynard, he was largely responsible for remodelling the exterior of the house, and for much internal detail; in both cases the design, as well as the execution, was probably due to them. In 1576 there is evidence that he was involved with alterations made at Wardour Castle, Wiltshire, for Sir Matthew Arundell. It may have been this connection that took him to Nottinghamshire in 1580, to work for Arundell's brother-in-law Sir Francis Willoughby at Wollaton Hall. His position at Wollaton was that of surveyor of the work, rather than a practising mason. The surviving building accounts and his own drawings make clear that he was responsible for the execution and design of this remarkable house. In the 1590s he took on his son <a href="#cosubject_63444">John [<i>see below</i>]</a> as assistant and draughtsman, and a number of the drawings of this period are by John, or at least lettered up in his hand. Robert Smythson stayed on in the service of the Willoughby family, and was employed by them on administrative and financial business, as well as in his capacity as a surveyor. He is described on his monument at Wollaton as &#145;architector and survayor unto the most worthy house of Wollaton, and diverse others of great account&#146;; this is the first known occasion on which he was called an architect, a term and function then still only in embryo in England.<br>
<br>Some 150 drawings by Robert Smythson and his son John survive in the drawings collection of the Royal Institute of British Architects, now held in the Victoria and Albert Museum. A proportion of these are surveys, but many are original designs (some of them drawings of considerable beauty), and besides including designs relevant to Longleat and Wollaton they supply evidence about several of the &#145;diverse other&#146; houses mentioned on his monument. They include Worksop Manor, Nottinghamshire (remodelled <i>c</i>.1585), Hardwick Hall, Derbyshire (1590&#150;97), Burton Agnes, Yorkshire (<i>c</i>.1601&#150;1610), and designs, only partially carried out, for remodelling Welbeck Abbey, Nottinghamshire. The stylistic evidence of drawings and documented buildings, supported by patronage links and geographical proximity, enables a number of other houses to be attributed to him, including Worksop Manor Lodge, Nottinghamshire, Fountains Hall, Yorkshire, Wootton Lodge, Staffordshire, and possibly Barlborough Hall, Derbyshire, and Doddington Hall, Lincolnshire. There is no evidence that at any of these houses Smythson was involved on the same day-to-day basis as at Longleat and Wollaton; his contribution must often have been limited to the provision of a set of plans and elevations, which were liable to alteration at the whim of the patron and executive craftsmen.<br>
<br>Even allowing for these limitations, Smythson's is the strongest architectural personality to have survived from the Elizabethan and Jacobean age. This is partly because more is known about him, and because his drawings and those of his younger contemporary John Thorpe (a high proportion of which are survey drawings) are the only large collections from this period that still exist, but it is also because of the distinctive and remarkable character of the houses with which he can be connected. Both his drawings and the buildings show that he had, for the Elizabethan period, a capable grasp of the language of classical ornament; he knew and used the works of Serlio, possibly of Palladio, and of the Flemish mannerist Vredeman de Vries, whose designs were extensively adapted at Wollaton. But his drawings and buildings also show an interest in the native Gothic tradition. His achievement was to draw on these two strains, and on the contemporary Elizabethan taste for the kind of ingenious conceits known at the time as &#145;devices&#146;, to produce a creative synthesis. In the resulting buildings classical detail and a considerable degree of classical order can be found joined with dramatic combinations of towers, bay windows, and great expanses of glass, derived from the Gothic tradition, and with the complex and ingenious plans which were the architectural expression of the device. At Longleat, where he worked with Maynard, bay windows and lavish glazing were serenely combined with rich classical detail. Wollaton is the most extraordinary of his houses, but it suffers from an over-abundance of motifs. Hardwick, in its combination of high drama, spatial ingenuity, and classical restraint, must be considered his masterpiece. Robert Smythson died in Wollaton on 15 October 1614.<br>
<br>Nothing is known about Smythson's marriage, but his son <a name="cosubject_63444"></a><span class="headword">John Smythson</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1634) was old enough to work as a mason at Wollaton in 1588, his first documented appearance. In the 1590s he was working with his father; in 1597 they are recorded as visiting Hardwick together, when payments of &pound;1 to &#145;Mr Smythson the surveyor&#146; and 10<i>s</i>. to &#145;his son&#146; underline the hierarchy of the relationship. He was still living at Wollaton when he married Margaret Newton of Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, in December 1600. He probably continued to work with his father into the new century. But by 1608, if not before, he had moved from Wollaton into the orbit of the Cavendish family, to work for Sir Charles Cavendish, and later for his son William, the future duke of Newcastle upon Tyne. He remained in their service (and lived in houses belonging to them) until his death in 1634. Although he accepted commissions from other clients, the bulk of his work was for the Cavendishes, including additions and alterations at Welbeck Abbey, the virtual rebuilding of Bolsover Castle, Derbyshire, from 1612, a new house at Slingsby Castle, Yorkshire (<i>c</i>.1630), and work as land surveyor and estate bailiff, not unlike that which his father had carried out for the Willoughbys. It was probably the Cavendishes who sent him on trips to London and the south in 1609 and 1618&#150;19, on which he made valuable survey drawings of buildings and gardens in London and elsewhere. For them he also evolved a distinctively personal style of ornament and detail, of which just a few survivals remain at Welbeck but which is still gloriously abundant at Bolsover. His later work, at Bolsover, Slingsby, and in a fine chimneypiece at Clifton House, Nottingham, shows the influence of the German designer Wendel Dietterlin.<br>
<br>A memorial tablet in the church at Bolsover records the &#145;skill in architecture&#146; of John's son, Huntingdon Smythson (<i>d</i>. 1648), but no work by him has been securely identified.<br>
