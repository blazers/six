<span class="headword">Pleasants,  Thomas</span>  (1728&#150;1818), <span class="occ">benefactor</span>, was born in co. Carlow, the eldest son of William Pleasants and Grace Edwards. Little is known of Pleasants's early life as he did not rise to prominence until his wife of twenty-seven years, Mildred Daunt, died on 1 February 1814 and bequeathed the 86-year-old Pleasants &pound;90,000. Since he had not earned the money himself, as there were no children from the marriage, and because a lawsuit concerning his wife's family over the terms of her will had caused much ill feeling between him and the Daunts, Pleasants felt he could neither spend the money himself nor leave it to any relations.<br>
<br>Instead Pleasants became a generous supporter of the Royal Dublin Society. In 1809 the society had been unable to respond to a memorial from the woollen weavers of Dublin, so within two months of his inheritance Pleasants spent &pound;14,000, four times the amount mentioned in the memorial, to purchase a plot of ground in Cork Street, where he erected a store tenter house where weavers could dry their wool during the winter. It was estimated that by these means 22,000 men, women, and children were saved from want each year. He also donated many paintings and pictures to the collection of the Royal Dublin Society as well as a sum of &pound;100 to augment the society's library. It was also at his expense that the lodges and entrances of the botanic gardens at Glasnevin, co. Dublin, were erected at a cost of &pound;600. On 22 July 1814 Pleasants received the freedom of the city of Dublin in return for his efforts. Additionally, he donated &pound;6000 to the Meath Hospital, Dublin: &pound;4000 to build an operating room, and the interest of the residue to purchase wine and other necessities for the afflicted. In 1816 he invested &pound;160 to reprint Samuel Madden's <span class="italic">Reflections and Resolutions Proper for the Gentlemen of Ireland</span> (1st edn, 1738). The published form, which contained Pleasants's annotations, was to be dispersed free of charge among members of any societies dedicated to the arts, manufactures, and agriculture in Ireland.<br>
<br>Pleasants died at the age of ninety on 1 March 1818 at 67 Camden Street, Dublin, and was buried at St Bride's graveyard in the city. In his will, which at thirty-two pages had taken two years to write, he left large sums to several Dublin charities: &pound;5000 to the Dublin Fever Hospital in Cork Street; &pound;5000 for the hospital for incurables; &pound;3000 to St Bridget's parish school; &pound;3000 to the Dublin almshouse; &pound;3000 to the Meath charitable loan; and &pound;1000 each to St Luke's charity school, St James parochial school, and a school for females. Most importantly he left his home and &pound;15,000 to establish an orphanage for protestant females, as well as various personal bequests to servants and relatives and &pound;300 to erect a monument to his father-in-law, and the original source of his wealth, Surgeon Daunt. In recognition of his bequests Pleasants has a street in Dublin named after him.<br>
