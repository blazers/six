<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Simonds family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1768&#150;1960), <span class="occ">brewers</span>, traced its origins in that trade to William Simonds (<i>bap</i>. 1733, <i>d</i>. 1782), who was the second son of a yeoman of Arborfield, Berkshire, Thomas Simonds (1700&#150;1765), the owner of extensive estates. On his father's death William Simonds, who was married to Mary Blackall (1730&#150;1797), resolved to forsake the land and become an industrialist. He moved to nearby Reading, which the excise department records show to have become the most important malting area in Britain. There Berkshire barley was converted into malt and shipped down the River Thames to the large-scale breweries in London, such as Barclay Perkins. Having established a malting business at Reading, about 1768 he began brewing as well.<br>
<br>Simonds's town centre premises were, however, too cramped to permit much expansion, and it was his only son, <a name="cosubject_97872"></a><span class="headword">William Blackall Simonds</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1761, <em>d.</em> 1834)<span class="occ"></span>, baptized at Broad Street Independent Chapel, Reading, on 13 August 1761, who created the more considerable brewery that brought his family both celebrity and wealth. In 1789 W. B. Simonds acquired a greenfield site on what were then the outskirts of Reading, because it adjoined a tributary of the Thames, the River Kennet, convenient for transporting in bulk such ingredients as hops and malt by barge and for dispatching the brewed beer. To design the brewhouse and a family residence he employed his friend the architect John Soane. He met the set-up cost of &pound;6400 partly from inherited wealth, including &pound;1000 from his maternal grandfather, William Blackall (<i>b</i>. 1690), and a &pound;2000 dowry for his wife Elizabeth (1734&#150;1842), daughter of Daniel May (1734&#150;1773), miller of Pangbourne, Berkshire. They married at Pangbourne in 1783 and had five sons and two daughters. Elizabeth's uncle, Thomas May (1737&#150;1800), founded May's brewery of Basingstoke, eventually bought by H. and G. Simonds in the late 1940s.<br>
<br>Simonds's taste for luxury was evident in the coloured silhouette he had made of himself as a young man, with fashionable powdered hair, fancy cravat, and sky-blue coat decorated with silver buttons. In 1799 he replaced the horse-driven rotary mill for grinding barley with a Boulton and Watt steam engine, only the second to be installed in a Berkshire brewery, and a very confident gesture that provided significantly greater capacity than was needed at that time.<br>
<br>As early as 1791, newly appointed receiver-general of taxes for west Berkshire, Simonds was co-founder of Micklem, Stephens, Simonds, and Harris's bank in Reading. However, the refusal by local magistrates to issue licences for new public houses frustrated his ambition to offer Simonds' high-quality beer to a wider clientele. The consequent lack of competition in the town allowed rivals to sell a poorly made product at inflated prices. By 1814, seeing no future in brewing there, he was anxious to give it up and concentrate on his banking activities. Having withdrawn from the original bank he established a new wholly family-run bank; in addition to himself and his second son, Henry, the partners were John and Charles, sons of William Simonds's elder brother, Thomas; it was later entitled John Simonds, Charles Simonds &amp; Co., Reading Bank. Having served as mayor of Reading in 1816, as four of his descendants did by 1882, W. B. Simonds retired to London and then to Pangbourne, where he died on 13 January 1834. Instead of taking capital out of the brewery, he accepted an annuity and left &pound;1000.<br>
<br>The Simonds bank survived the financial crisis of 1825. When news arrived at Reading that its correspondent bank in London, Williams &amp; Co., had failed, Charles Simonds travelled overnight to the capital and next morning opened an office opposite Williams' bank, displaying a notice &#145;Reading Notes paid here&#146;. By the late 1860s Simonds' had five banking branches in neighbouring towns from Basingstoke to High Wycombe. In 1871 John Simonds was joined by his sons John and William and by his nephew James; the latter trio ran the bank until 1905. Although it held the brewery account, relations were not particularly close, the brewery partners declining to subject themselves to what they termed the clutches of their bankers. Despite obtaining the account in 1889 of the newly established Berkshire county council, the bank never earned more than moderate profits, which rose from &pound;4800 in 1844 to &pound;25,000 in 1912. During the following year the fourth generation of Simonds banking partners sold out to Barclays Bank, which continues to operate from the original Simonds premises in King Street after nearly 200 years.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, W. B. Simonds had handed over the brewery assets to his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_98001"></a><span class="headword">Blackall Simonds</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1784, <em>d.</em> 1875), who was baptized at St Lawrence's, Reading on 20 July 1784. A boisterous regency character, he energetically involved himself in the rough-and-tumble of unreformed national and local politics and in arduous fox-hunting. A member of the south Berkshire hunt, he and his groom used hunt outings to track down potential sites for public houses around the county. His foresight was rewarded when in 1830 the <span class="roman">Beer Act</span> permitted the opening of beer shops without a magistrate's licence, and he was able to move speedily, ahead of his competitors, to acquire new public houses.<br>
<br>During the 1830s the brewery's reputation grew so that annual production rose from 11,000 to 15,000 barrels. Steadily overtaking rivals who failed to improve their inferior brands of beer, it was already the largest brewery in Reading when in 1834 it introduced the earliest of its novelties, a less strong pale ale, at first solely for export, shipped even as far as Australia. Burdened by having to run the brewery single-handed, Blackall Simonds saw a decline in demand over the next decade. Then in 1845, having no children, he handed over to his brothers Henry Simonds (1785&#150;1874) and George Simonds (1794&#150;1852), who since 1814 had been building up a nearby wine and spirits business. Retiring to the Isle of Wight, Blackall followed his father's practice in receiving annuities for himself and his wife, Emma Jane (1796&#150;1885), daughter of Thomas Usborne of Reading. He died at Ryde on 18 February 1875.<br>
<br>The new partners inaugurated an era of rapid expansion, during which brewery output increased from 12,000 barrels in 1850 to 40,000 barrels in 1868. When George Simonds died in 1852 members of the third generation, grandsons of William Blackall Simonds and nephews and executors of Blackall Simonds, entered the firm: Henry Adolphus Simonds (1823&#150;1910) and his cousin Henry John Simonds (1829&#150;1896), a scholar at Eton College and later a fellow of King's College, Cambridge, who became a barrister. Early in the same decade they began to market pale ale in Britain. Now that much manual labour was being eased by machinery, consumers were demanding beer of lower strength. Within three decades that brand&#151;sold in bottles from 1858 onwards&#151;accounted for half the brewery's output.<br>
<br>A plentiful supply of male Simonds descendants of the founder gave the partners scope to select the most able to join their ranks. They expected junior members to devote their entire time to the business, and to be supervised at a distance by the senior partners, who permitted them considerable discretion. That combination of energy and experience allowed growth to take place through tangible innovations as well as through imaginative expansion of the market for beer. On the technical side the firm's laboratory, one of the earliest in the brewery industry, employed scientists who tested both the ingredients and the standard of each brew. Moreover, George Simonds's eldest son, Blackall Simonds junior (1839&#150;1905), who joined in 1868 when Henry Simonds retired, was a trained engineer. In the mid-1870s he designed the first ever concrete industrial store on four levels to hold stocks of the firm's beer and wine. A decade later the firm introduced a new system of fermentation, the Burton Union method. While being labour-intensive, it led to marked improvements in the palatability of the pale ale.<br>
<br>The younger partners were in the meantime planning to open fresh outlets, to supplement their many tied houses. Now that Aldershot, twenty miles from Reading, had been designated as the headquarters of the British army, in 1872 they arranged to set up the first canteen for the troops stationed there. The popularity of that initiative encouraged the firm to establish branches in Gibraltar and Malta so as to make beer available to overseas garrisons in those colonies. Between 1877 and 1883 they followed up that move by securing contracts for supplying railway refreshment rooms. By 1885 the partners' technical and market strategies had caused output to rise from 40,000 barrels in 1868 to 114,000 barrels, while net profit was up from &pound;10,000 to over &pound;25,000.<br>
<br>That year the firm was registered as a limited company, under the name of H. and G. Simonds Ltd, with capital of &pound;500,000. The directors and senior Simonds managers held all the issued preference and ordinary shares. The family thus retained full control over the business, and avoided the kind of scramble by private investors for their shares that other brewery companies were experiencing. The latter had sought outside capital in order to buy up further outlets for their beers; to achieve the same goal without extending its capital, in 1896&#150;9 the Simonds company created no less than &pound;275,000 worth of 4 per cent debentures. As a result it doubled the number of its tied houses.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Blackall Simonds junior's younger brother, <a name="cosubject_96961"></a><span class="headword">George Blackall Simonds</span> <span class="st"> [<em>later </em>George  Blackall-Simonds]</span>  (1843&#150;1929), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was achieving fame in an altogether different field. Born in Reading on 6 October 1843, the second of the three sons of George Simonds and his wife, Mary Anne Boulger, he had been educated at Bradfield College, which his family had helped to found. Having decided on an artistic career in preference to joining the brewery, he studied sculpture under Johannes Schilling in Dresden, and later with Louis J&eacute;hotte in Brussels. During a twelve-year stay in Rome, in 1877 he married (Emily) Gertrude Prescott (1859&#150;1940), an American citizen whom he had met there. George Prescott Simonds (1881&#150;1914), their only child, was killed very early in the First World War.<br>
<br>In Italy Simonds displayed the family's scientific aptitude by pioneering the Victorian effort to reintroduce the Renaissance technology of casting bronzes from wax moulds. The &#145;lost wax&#146; (<i>cire perdue</i>) method involved fashioning a wax model, forming a mould, and then melting away the wax before pouring in metal between the core and the mould. Simonds used that technique to make what is widely hailed as his finest work in that genre, <span class="italic">The Falconer</span> (1868). That represents a life-sized youth in steel breastplate, jerkin, tights, and cap slipping, or unleashing, a peregrine falcon of impressive wing span, at least half the young man's height.<br>
<br>Following its display at the Vienna International Exhibition of 1873 a massive bronze replica, over 11 feet high and cast at Florence in a single piece, was commissioned for New York's Central Park, where it was dedicated in 1875; after weathering and constant vandalism, it was repaired and repatinated in 1982. The trouble Simonds took over its creation reflected his abiding recreational interest in falconry, a sport he worked hard to revive in the UK, becoming founder president of the British Falconry Society.<br>
<br>Simonds made a number of statues for his native town of Reading, most notably one of the largest bronzes hitherto cast, which took him two years to design and execute, the 31 foot long Maiwand lion (1886) in the Forbury Gardens. It commemorates the 328 officers and men of the Royal Berkshire regiment who died at Maiwand during the campaign of 1879&#150;80 in Afghanistan. His bust of the engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette was erected on the Victoria Embankment in London, one of more than 200 works in an unusually wide range of materials, including marble, bronze, plaster, terracotta, silver, brass, wood, and cast iron.<br>
<br>Having returned to Britain, an imposing figure with the widest of moustaches, George Blackall Simonds achieved celebrity in London's art world. There he became in 1884 a founder and the first master of the Art-Workers' Guild, which provided a forum where artists, architects, and craftsmen could share their views: an organization familiar to the studio life of Rome, but not found hitherto in northern countries. In 1879 he and a relative by marriage patented their invention of an iconograph, which allowed the dimensions of sculptures and other solid objects to be magnified or reduced.<br>
<br>In 1903, aged sixty, Simonds retired from sculpting, and became a director of the brewery company. Two years later, on the death of his brother Blackall, he took the name of Blackall-Simonds. In 1910 he succeeded Henry Adolphus Simonds as chairman of the brewery, and remained in that office until his own death, at his home, Bradfield House, Bradfield, Berkshire, on 16 December 1929. He was buried at Bradfield. Shortly before his death the company received for the first time the royal warrant for supplying its products to the royal households. His family remembered him as not having much of a head for the intricacies of business, but he related well to the brewery staff and was a ready mediator at company meetings. He led the company through the five-month general strike and other industrial disputes of 1926. Despite crippling shortages of raw materials and transport, he refused to lay off any of the 1200 employees. After its close the grateful workforce subscribed to buy the directors a long-case clock for the boardroom.<br>
<br>A succession of elderly chairmen did not seriously hold back the brewery's more recent progress, thanks to the activities of some very dynamic younger directors. The most noteworthy during George Blackall-Simonds's reign was <a name="cosubject_48191"></a><span class="headword">Frederick Adolphus <span class="st"> [Eric]</span> Simonds</span>  (1881&#150;1953), <span class="occ">brewer</span>. Born in Reading on 2 January 1881, he was the eldest son of Louis de Luze Simonds (1852&#150;1916) and his wife, Mary Elizabeth (1857&#150;1930), daughter of Gavin Turnbull, an army surgeon. Eric had three younger brothers and a sister. His brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31687/', "Gavin Turnbull Simonds (1881&#150;1971)")</script>, a lawyer of distinction, served as lord chancellor in Winston Churchill's second government from 1951 to 1954.<br>
<br>Frederick William Simonds (1819&#150;1896), a younger grandson of William Blackall Simonds, had emigrated to New York in 1845 and in the following year married Sophie de Luze, the Swiss consul's daughter. Their son, Louis de Luze Simonds, was recalled by his childless great-uncle, Henry Adolphus, to Reading, where he became the first company secretary when H. and G. Simonds Ltd was registered in 1885 and then managing director, and later still Henry's heir.<br>
<br>Educated at Eton and at Magdalen College, Oxford, Eric Simonds served with the Royal Berkshire regiment in the South African War of 1899&#150;1902 before becoming a trainee with the company. He was made a director in 1905. He initially focused on building up business in Gibraltar, Malta, Cairo, Belgium, and other overseas branches, with considerable success, although the joint venture with East African Breweries Ltd in Kenya did not turn out to be profitable. In 1909 he married Amy FitzGerald (1883&#150;1969), daughter of John Sheriff Hill, a banker. They had a daughter who died in infancy, and three sons, Louis, Duncan, and Kenneth, all of whom became directors of Simonds companies. He succeeded his father as managing director in 1916. The company had hitherto relied entirely on internal growth, all its 350 outlets being in or close to Reading. He took advantage of developments in motor transport, and the ever increasing network of trunk roads, to plan the company's expansion by means of outside acquisitions.<br>
<br>Eric Simonds began that strategy by purchasing breweries mainly in south-west England, including the Tamar Brewery in Devonport, W. J. Rogers in Bristol, and R. H. Stiles at Bridgend in Glamorgan. In the home counties around London he bought Ashby's in Staines and Wheeler's in High Wycombe. By the beginning of the Second World War in 1939 H. and G. Simonds was recognized as one of the most rapidly expanding breweries in the whole of southern England, at a time when regional brewery companies were becoming common throughout the British industry. In 1938 Eric Simonds took over the chairmanship from Stephen Shea-Simonds.<br>
<br>After 1945 he resumed his ambitious programme of acquisitions; those included Phillips' brewery in Newport, Monmouthshire, May's brewery in Basingstoke, and Pool &amp; Sons in Penzance. With the four acquired breweries that were maintained in production, H. and G. Simonds' output in 1953 reached almost 500,000 barrels, up from 175,000 barrels in 1900. Retaining the company's capital structure intact, he paid for these acquisitions by a series of debenture issues. After a final acquisition in 1955 of the Octagon Brewery in Plymouth, by the time of its merger the company had 1132 public houses and 63 off-licences. Eric was high sheriff of Berkshire in 1928&#150;9 and president of the Royal Warrant Holders' Association in 1937 and 1945. A full-bodied man with a florid complexion, he would have made a &#145;good model for John Bull&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 Aug 1953), revelling in his many sporting activities and friendships. He died in a London nursing home, 30 Devonshire Place, Marylebone, on 17 August 1953 and was buried at Cliddesden, Hampshire.<br>
<br>His successor was the first non-family chairman, General Sir Miles Dempsey, who had commanded the British 2nd Army from Normandy to the Rhine in the Second World War, and was colonel of the Royal Berkshire Regiment. Dempsey had joined the Simonds board in 1947 as vice-chairman on retirement from the army. His fellow directors included members of the sixth Simonds generation, including Eric's son Duncan Simonds (1916&#150;2002) and Richard Quarry (1912&#150;2003) as joint managing directors. In 1960 the company's board agreed to a merger on equal terms with the two great and recently merged London breweries, Courage and Barclay Perkins, which together had net operating assets of &pound;21 million, compared with H. and G. Simonds' &pound;9.8 million.<br>
<br>Initially registered as Courage Barclay and Simonds Ltd, the new company later adopted the first of those names, one of the three main subsidiaries, Courage (Central) Ltd having its head office in Reading. Then in 1980 all the latter's operations were moved from William Blackall Simonds's original site on Bridge Street to a new brewery on the southern outskirts of the town, close to the M4 motorway at Worton Grange.<br>
<br>The brewery the Simonds family had founded and managed in Reading remained under its control throughout a period of almost two hundred years. Thanks to a large supply of able family members, financial prudence in husbanding their corporate capital, a drive to innovate, and marketing skills, the Simondses achieved the very rare feat among large-scale British manufacturing industry of continuous profitability and growth into the sixth family generation.<br>
