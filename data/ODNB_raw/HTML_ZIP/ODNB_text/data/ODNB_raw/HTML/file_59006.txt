<span class="headword">Walton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Deck]</span>,  Amy Catherine</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Mrs O. F. Walton]</span>  (1849&#150;1939), <span class="occ">children's writer</span>, daughter of the Revd John Deck (1815&#150;1882), vicar of St Stephen's, Hull, and Mary Ann Sanderson Gibson (1813&#150;1903), hymn writer, was born on 7 August 1849 at 5 Belgrave Terrace, Hull. She has been confused in the British Library catalogue, the Bodleian catalogue, and elsewhere with Mrs Catherine Augusta Walton (<i>d</i>. 1906), wife of Oriel Farnell Walton (1846&#150;1886), a barrister, and eldest daughter of Lord Cecil James Gordon-Moore (1806&#150;1878) and his wife, Emily Moore (<i>d</i>. 1902).<br>
<br>The Deck family's Anglican evangelical credentials were proved by the father's fiercely anti-Puseyite publications, the collaborative hymn writing of mother and daughter, and the middle names of Amy's younger brother, Henry Legh Richmond (<i>b</i>. 1853). Her best-known work, <span class="italic">Christie's Old Organ, or, &#145;Home Sweet Home&#146;</span> (1874), was written to illustrate her mother's hymn &#145;There is a city bright&#146;, to which Amy had contributed the first verse. One of her first works for children, <span class="italic">My Mates and I</span> (1873), had been sold under her father's name to the Religious Tract Society for &pound;24. The Religious Tract Society's payments were low (she received &pound;15 for <span class="italic">Christie's Old Organ</span> with a bonus of more than &pound;6), yet by 1919 she had received a further &pound;492 from their profits on her early works. Another of her piously sentimental best-sellers for children, <span class="italic">Little Dot</span> (1873), had also been written before her marriage, on 16 February 1875, at St Stephen's, Hull, to the Revd Octavius Frank Walton (1844&#150;1933), who had served as her father's curate for the previous three years. Her work had been published anonymously before her marriage; post-1875 works and reprints were printed under her married name.<br>
<br>Immediately after their marriage Octavius Walton took up the ecclesiastically contentious post of incumbent of Christ Church, Mount Zion, Jerusalem, but returned in 1876 to a chaplaincy established for English textile workers in the Scottish borders at Cally, Kirkcudbright. Here they stayed until 1883. Subsequent moves took Octavius Walton to the tradesmen's church of St Thomas, York (1883&#150;93); St Jude's, Wolverhampton, Staffordshire (1893&#150;1906), where Amy's widowed mother joined them; and Leigh, Tonbridge, Kent (1906&#150;17). After a period of retirement in Shamley Green, near Guildford, Surrey, the couple returned to live at Great Barnetts, Leigh.<br>
<br>By the time Octavius became vicar of Leigh, Amy had immersed herself in parish work, such as the Sunday school, the mothers' union, and sewing classes for teenage girls, leaving little time for her writing: only two of her thirty titles appeared after this move. A photograph of this period shows a woman of kindly if slightly masculine appearance, her hair scraped back and presenting a strange contrast with the rather fussily feminine clothes she is wearing.<br>
<br>Although Walton's tales sometimes espoused topical philanthropic causes, such as the outcry against the moral and physical risks suffered by child actors in cheap theatres and travelling fairs, featured in <span class="italic">A Peep Behind the Scenes</span> (1877), or the campaign for safer seafaring conditions, alluded to in <span class="italic">Saved at Sea</span> (1879) and <span class="italic">Launch the Lifeboat</span> (1886), their chief purpose was always the evangelical work of conversion. The effect of their sentimental piety was unmarred by sectarian prejudice: the labours of devout parochial clergymen were rated no more highly than those of mission chapels or scripture readers, or the timely words of a Christian neighbour, in achieving the great work of salvation. Despite asserting that earthly pilgrimage is but a prelude to reward or punishment in the afterlife, her tales rarely refrained from offering shorter-term proof of the fates awaiting the redeemed and the unredeemed. Both structurally and morally her stories leaned heavily upon a fairy-tale inheritance that made them palatable to children, and their sanitized pictures of virtuous orphaned waifs, whose innate cleanliness and gentility was often confirmed by the satisfying revelation of a genetic entitlement to middle-class status, made them safe presents for children of every class. Tales that had initially appeared in cheap tract format were often republished as more sumptuous illustrated gift-books. She and her publishers were to approve a film version of <span class="italic">A Peep Behind the Scenes</span>, shown by the Studio of Portsmouth Road, Thames Ditton, Surrey, on 11 December 1918.<br>
<br>Walton also wrote simple retellings of biblical stories, such as <span class="italic">The King's Cup-Bearer: the Story of Nehemiah</span> (1891), and <span class="italic">Dr Forester</span> (1906), a romantic Christian mystery tale aimed at an adolescent readership. Walton died on 5 July 1939 at Dry Bank House, Dry Hill, Park Road, Tonbridge, Kent. The cause of death was heart failure following a fall in her home.<br>
