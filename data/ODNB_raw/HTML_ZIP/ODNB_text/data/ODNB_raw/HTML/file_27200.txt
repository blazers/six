<span class="headword">Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [Thomas (II) of York]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1114), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, came of a notable clerical family, being the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24600/', "Samson (d. 1112)")</script>, treasurer and possibly dean of Bayeux and then bishop of Worcester from 1096 until his death, brother of Richard, bishop of Bayeux (<i>c</i>.1108&#150;1133), and nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27199/', "Archbishop Thomas (I)")</script> of York (1070&#150;1100). To distinguish him from his uncle he is commonly known as Thomas (II) of York or Thomas the younger. It was to the first Archbishop Thomas that he owed his promotion as provost of the collegiate church of Beverley in 1092. He was introduced as a clerk at the king's court, where he became a royal chaplain. On 27 May 1108, six days after the death of Archbishop Gerard, Thomas was appointed archbishop of York by Henry I. According to Hugh the Chanter, the king had been intending to confer on him the vacant bishopric of London, but, at the request of Dean Hugh and other members of the York chapter who were then at court, he was appointed to York instead. It was a popular appointment with the chapter, as Thomas had been educated at York; Hugh asserts that the canons, given a free choice in 1100, would have elected him to succeed his uncle. Hugh records that Thomas's popularity with the York chapter was partly due to certain characteristics that he shared with his late uncle; almost certainly he would have been expected to be sympathetic to the stance taken by York in response to the demands of the archbishops of Canterbury that the northern archbishops make written profession of obedience to them. Indeed, Hugh states that Thomas &#145;knew the rights and wrongs of the case&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hugh the Chanter</span>, 27). The archbishop-elect then attended Anselm's council held at London (28 May 1108) to which his predecessor had been travelling at the time of his death, and associated himself with Anselm's reforms.<br>
<br>Almost immediately the question of the primacy was raised. The monks of Christ Church, Canterbury, put pressure on Archbishop Anselm (<i>d</i>. 1109) to summon Thomas in order to receive consecration and make profession. The dean and chapter of York, however, wrote to Thomas to forbid him to go to Canterbury or to make such profession. Thomas declared that he would take the advice of the king, and journeyed to the royal court at Winchester. Henry I was inclined to support York's claims and ordered Thomas not to make profession. Anselm, however, wrote to Thomas demanding that he accept consecration and fixing a day for the ceremony; and he threatened that he would himself perform episcopal functions within the diocese of York should Thomas refuse. Thomas contrived to delay, excusing himself from the journey on the grounds that the chapter of York had forbidden him to make profession, and that his predecessor, Gerard, had so impoverished the see that he could not afford to travel. There followed an interchange of letters: from Anselm forbidding Thomas to go to Rome for his pallium; from Anselm to the pope requesting him to withhold the pallium until Thomas had been consecrated; from Thomas to Anselm explaining that his chapter had forbidden him to make profession; and from the chapter to Thomas threatening to denounce him should he do so. On Anselm's behalf the bishops of London and Rochester attempted to persuade Thomas to act as the archbishop wished. Thomas received them at Southwell, explaining that he had communicated all this to the king, who was then in Normandy. The king then wrote to Anselm ordering him to stop his demands until he should return to England. He also sent the dean of York to Rome with letters explaining the situation, and asking the pope to send a legate to England to decide the case, since Thomas was unable, for various reasons, to travel to Rome. The pope agreed, and sent Cardinal Odalric (Ulric) with the pallium and instructions concerning the dispute.<br>
<br>Thomas's prevarication succeeded in postponing the matter until after the death of Archbishop Anselm, who on his deathbed still warned Thomas against exercising episcopal authority before he had been consecrated; and the king, having received the papal envoys in Normandy, sent them ahead to England. When he himself returned he was approached by the monks of Canterbury, and he ordered them to wait until Whitsun for an answer. On 13 and 14 June 1109 he received at court the various parties, including the archbishop-elect and the papal legate. But the king was no longer inclined to support York; as Hugh the Chanter realized, he had done so in the past partly in order to oppose Anselm rather than from firm conviction of the rightness of York's cause. Henry now changed his mind, and ordered Thomas to make profession. He commanded the bishops, and members of Thomas's own family, to use their influence with him, and, under pressure to resign if he did not make profession, Thomas capitulated: he made a vague profession to an unnamed archbishop of Canterbury, and was consecrated by the bishop of London on 27 June 1109 in the presence of six bishops. In response to requests by the bishops of Norwich and Durham, the king declared that the profession had been made in response to a royal command, rather than as the result of a legal sentence.<br>
<br>Following his profession and consecration Thomas journeyed north with Cardinal Odalric, and received his pallium from the legate at York on 1 August. Thomas was under pressure to consecrate Turgot (<i>d</i>. 1115) as bishop of St Andrews, without the profession of obedience that Archbishop Gerard had demanded, and this he did in York on the same day. Thomas spent three days in York before accompanying the cardinal south as far as the River Trent. As they parted the archbishop was astounded to receive a summons from the legate to the Roman curia to answer charges of having made his profession contrary to the decrees of the Roman church. However, he and others present persuaded the cardinal that the profession had been forced upon him by the king, and the summons was withdrawn.<br>
<br>Thomas also consecrated, with written profession, Michael, bishop of Glasgow, and later Ralph Nowell (<i>d</i>. 1144), bishop of Orkney, and Wimund, bishop of Man and the Isles. As archbishop he was credited with the creation of two prebends in the church of York, possibly those of Fridaythorpe and Sherburn in Elmet, and he granted the canons the vill of Helperby to hold in common. He granted to the collegiate church of Southwell the liberties enjoyed by the churches of York, Beverley, and Ripon, and aided the same church in its construction work by ordering the men of Nottinghamshire to make their Pentecostal procession to the church of Southwell rather than that of York. His period of office saw the introduction of the regular canons to the diocese of York, both to Bridlington and in 1113 to the ancient minster church of Hexham, where the hereditary priest, Eilaf, was expelled, and replaced by canons drawn from Huntingdon. Thomas allegedly tried to remove the bones of St Eata to York to compensate for York's lack of relics, but was thwarted in his attempts by a vision of the saint himself. He endowed the Augustinian priory of Hexham with a generous amount of land, rents, and allowances, as well as with books and ornaments.<br>
<br>Thomas (II) was a corpulent man; Hugh the Chanter states that he was &#145;full-bodied and fatter than he should have been&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hugh the Chanter</span>, 49), and that this explained both his lack of action and his submission over the matter of the profession of obedience: his corpulence would have prevented him tolerating the discomforts of exile. His overweight may have been a factor in his early death. Hugh notes as another characteristic of Thomas that he maintained his virginity. During his period as provost of Beverley, Thomas had suffered an illness and was allegedly told by his doctors that his life could only be saved by breaking his lifelong vow of chastity. His friends, according to William of Newburgh, attempted to persuade him to this course of action by introducing a woman secretly into his household. Thomas, however, refused both medical advice and the well-meaning assistance of his friends, and recovered after he had prayed to St John of Beverley. But the illness returned at a later date, and Thomas died at Beverley on either 19 or 24 February 1114. He was buried in York near to the tomb of his uncle. Walter Daniel, in his life of Ailred, abbot of Rievaulx, recorded that Thomas's death was seen in a vision by the young Ailred, son of Eilaf, the priest ousted from Hexham by Thomas; when he announced the event to his disbelieving family several days before news of it arrived in Hexham, his father drew laughter by commenting &#145;truly he has died, who lives a bad life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of Ailred</span>, 72).<br>
<br>Thomas's rule at York was a brief one, but he clearly had the affection and trust of the York canons who remembered him as a man &#145;agreeable both in morals and manners&#146; despite his capitulation over his profession of obedience  (<span class="italic">Hugh the Chanter</span>, 27). Similar epitaphs were given by Richard of Hexham and William of Newburgh, and Symeon of Durham praised Thomas's chastity and probity.<br>
