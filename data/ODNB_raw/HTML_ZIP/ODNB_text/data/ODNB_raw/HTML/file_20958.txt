<span class="headword">Ouseley, Sir  William Gore</span>  (1797&#150;1866), <span class="occ">diplomatist and author</span>, born in London on 26 July 1797, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20957/', "Sir William Ouseley (1767&#150;1842)")</script>, orientalist, and his wife, Julia Irving; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20955/', "Sir Gore Ouseley, bt")</script>, also an orientalist, was his uncle. He entered the diplomatic service when very young, and in November 1817 was attached to the British embassy at Stockholm. After serving at other European courts he became, in November 1825, paid attach&eacute; at Washington, DC. He remained there for seven years, and in 1832 published <span class="italic">Remarks on the statistics and political institutions of the United States, with some observations on the ecclesiastical system of America, her sources of revenue &hellip;</span>. The book, an edition of which was issued at Philadelphia during the same year under the auspices of Washington Irving, gave a highly favourable picture of American institutions. It was somewhat severely criticized by William Jacob in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> for December 1832, but was quoted with approval in Lord Brougham's <span class="italic">Political Philosophy</span>  (1849, pt 3, 340).<br>
<br>In June 1832 Ouseley went to Rio de Janeiro as secretary of legation. He served as charg&eacute; d'affaires in Brazil in 1833 and again in 1836 and 1838&#150;41. On 13 December 1844 he was sent to Buenos Aires as minister to the Argentine confederation, from where he was dispatched, in January 1846, on a special mission to Montevideo (see TNA: PRO, FO 6/114). In conjunction with M. Deffaudis, the representative of France, he secured the evacuation of Uruguay by the Argentine troops and the withdrawal of their fleet from the capital, which was occupied by English and French troops.<br>
<br>Some time after his return to England, in 1850, Ouseley published <span class="italic">Notes on the Slave Trade, with Remarks on the Measures Adopted for its Suppression</span>. It was directed against the proposals recently made in parliament by William Hutt for withdrawing the squadron employed on the west coast of Africa in checking the slave trade.<br>
<br>On 29 June 1852 Ouseley was created KCB. He was made DCL by Oxford University on 20 June 1855. On 30 October 1857 he was dispatched on a special mission to Central America. He afterwards travelled in the United States, and returned to England in 1860. He retired on a pension of &pound;1000, but continued to take much interest in South American affairs, being chairman of the Falkland Islands' Company and other companies at his death.<br>
<br>Ouseley, besides speaking several modern languages, was a good classical scholar. In addition to the works mentioned, and some contributions to periodicals, he published <span class="italic">A description of views in South America, from original drawings made in Brazil, the River Plate, the Parana &hellip;</span> (1852). The drawings were selected for publication by Queen Victoria. He married, in 1829, Maria, daughter of M. Van Ness, governor of Vermont. She died on 18 January 1881, having borne two sons and a daughter. The elder son, William Charles, was attached to Sir Charles Hotham's mission to the River Plate in 1852, and died in Paraguay in 1858. The other son, a lieutenant in the navy, died during the Baltic operations in the same year. The daughter, Frances, married J. T. Fitzmaurice RN, fifth son of the earl of Orkney. Ouseley died from an abscess of the prostate at his London home, 31 Albemarle Street, on 6 March 1866.<br>
