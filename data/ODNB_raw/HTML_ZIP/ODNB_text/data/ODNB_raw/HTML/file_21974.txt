<span class="headword">Perley,  Moses Henry</span>  (1804&#150;1862), <span class="occ">entrepreneur and naturalist in Canada</span>, was born in Maugerville, Sunbury county, New Brunswick, on 31 December 1804, the son of Moses Perley and his cousin Mary, who were of an old Welsh family which had settled in Massachusetts in 1630. His father died before his birth. His mother took him to Saint John, New Brunswick, when he was very young and he went to school there, spending much of his free time with the local native people, in whose welfare he took a keen interest. On 6 September 1829 he married Jane, the daughter of Isaac Ketchum; they had eight children and took in two orphans. In 1828 he became an attorney and in 1830 was called to the bar, but soon entered business, particularly lumbering and coalmining, in which he was not conspicuously successful. Perley was critical of those who sought to restrict American investment in New Brunswick, and was accused in turn of being too pro-American.<br>
<br>Perley's knowledge of the area and interest in native people led to his being appointed honorary commissioner for Indian affairs at some point between 1839 and 1841, and in reports of 1842 and 1843 he protested against squatter encroachment on their lands, recommending that the crown hold these lands in trust and encourage them to settle in villages where education and health services could be provided. The native people of New Brunswick elected him &#145;chief over all&#146; in 1842, and he frequently visited their settlements dressed in native clothes. Perley sharply criticized the 1844 <span class="roman">New Brunswick Indian Act</span>. The act enabled the government to sell wide tracts of native land, ostensibly for their benefit, but Perley, quite rightly, feared it would enable squatters to hold on to their land. Although he did his best to safeguard the interests of the native people after the passing of the act, he found that public opinion, squatter intransigence, and government indifference all conspired against them.<br>
<br>Perley continued to practise law and to cultivate his business interests, and by 1840 he was an authority on the province's natural resources. In 1843 and 1847 he was made New Brunswick emigrant agent for the provincial and British governments respectively, and as such supervised the arrival of and helped immigrants, many of whom arrived sick and destitute. His knowledge of the country prompted the government to turn to him for reports on timber resources (1847) and fisheries (1849) and to help negotiate the reciprocity treaty between the United States and the British North American colonies. In 1855 he was appointed fisheries commissioner to enforce the reciprocity treaty, and he also continued as emigration officer until 1858. In 1861 he bought a share in the <span class="italic">Colonial Empire</span> newspaper, which advocated intercolonial free trade and union. Perley became ill in the summer of 1862 on board the <i>Desperate</i> while inspecting the fisheries, died on board on 17 August, and was buried at Forteau, Labrador. As well as his many government reports, he left works on natural history and Indian legends, and, as founder of the Natural History Society of New Brunswick and an ichthyologist of note, laid the foundation of natural science in the province.<br>
