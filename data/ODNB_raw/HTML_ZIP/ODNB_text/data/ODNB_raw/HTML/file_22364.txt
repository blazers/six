<span class="headword">Player, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1686), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was probably born in London, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22363/', "Sir Thomas Player (d. 1672)")</script>, local politician, and his wife, Rebecca (<i>d</i>. 1667). His father, who, in 1638, lived in the parish of St Leonard Eastcheap, London, before moving to Mare Street, Hackney, rose to prominence in the City in the 1640s as a cross-grained Independent, and he served the corporation of London as chamberlain during the Commonwealth, the protectorate, and the restored monarchy. On 20 April 1641 Player married Joyce (<i>bap</i>. 1622, <i>d</i>. 1686), daughter of William Kendall, a leading presbyterian common councilman of Bread Street, but Player did not become free of the City, as a member of the Haberdashers' Company, until 1659. He benefited from Charles II's appreciation of his father's financial services as chamberlain at the time of the Restoration, being knighted, along with his father, in 1660. He also served as a Middlesex JP (1660&#150;80), a Middlesex assessment commissioner (1661&#150;80), a London lieutenancy commissioner (1662&#150;77), and a London trained band colonel (1660, 1674&#150;7). He was eventually chosen leader of the Honourable Artillery Company (1669&#150;77), and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society (1673), and a common councilman for Bassishaw (1672&#150;82), where he lived, in Basinghall Street, near the Guildhall. He succeeded his father as chamberlain in 1672, a few weeks prior to the elder Player's death. <br>
<br>Player was originally a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Sir John Robinson, the leading Anglican loyalist in the corporation, who described him to the secretary of state, Sir Joseph Williamson, in 1670 as &#145;an honest, brave gentleman&#146; who &#145;ought to be encouraged&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1670</i>, 268). By 1672&#150;3 he had become one of Williamson's sources of intelligence in the City. In January 1674 he was intimate with such leading loyalist aldermen as Sir Robert Vyner and Sir Joseph Sheldon; and he served as the receiver for exchequer funds set aside for the rebuilding of St Paul's Cathedral. According to one report he was one of the king's drinking companions and still enjoyed occasional personal access to Charles as late as 1676. <br>
<br>Player, however, was both politically ambitious and independent; and he complained, about the time of the stop of the exchequer in 1672, that Charles owed him &pound;4000. He threw in his lot with &#145;the Nonconforming Men&#146;, promising, according to one critic, to weaken enforcement of the <span class="roman">Conventicle Acts</span> in return for their support  (BL, Add. MS 34362, fol. 9). Robinson blamed him for a 1673 common council petition full of grievances, claiming that he had promoted it for the sake of his own popularity; and when the aldermen stifled it Player claimed that their action &#145;was such a breach upon the Common Councell as hath not beene knowne&#146;  (Christie, 1.114; 2.55). By 1675 Player was a deputy alderman for his ward and had joined such other civic leaders as Sir Samuel Barnardiston, Francis Jenks, and Thomas Papillon in co-ordinating opposition to the earl of Danby's ministry in London and parliament. Player was targeted at court for retaliation in 1677 after he was compromised by the collapse of two opposition bankers, with whom he was associated, and by the arrest of the earl of Shaftesbury, with whom he also had ties. At the midsummer common hall Danby intervened in the corporation in hopes of seeing him evicted from office, only to be baffled when thousands of liverymen appeared to re-elect Player as chamberlain. But he was dropped from the London lieutenancy; and James, duke of York, engineered his elimination as leader of the artillery company, claiming &#145;no honest man ought to countenance him&#146;  (Raikes, 1.195). <br>
<br>In January 1679, after Charles II had prorogued parliament, Player was among the civic leaders who circulated a popular petition in London calling for another session. He was then elected as a City MP to each of the three exclusion parliaments. Both his outspoken language over the next four years, which often employed military imagery, and his vigilant arousal of London citizens on behalf of a protestant succession earned him hatred at court and poetic caricature as Dryden's &#145;railing Rabsheka&#146;  (Lord and others, 3.294). In the 1679 parliament he sat on the secret Commons committee for the investigation of the Popish Plot, and in debate he defended the probable need to take up arms against the &#145;Popish Guards&#146; of a Catholic successor, who might endanger protestant life and property  (Grey, 7.151). He moved the first bill to exclude the Catholic duke of York from the succession in May 1679, while simultaneously promoting another London petition to pressure Charles into accepting it. He was also named a parliamentary commissioner for the disbandment of the army. <br>
<br>In the long interval between the 1679 parliament and its repeatedly prorogued successor Player acted as the chief organizer of the London opposition. He helped orchestrate popular demands for a doubling of the guards in London in September 1679, after Charles II's serious illness prompted the duke of York to rush home from the continent for a possible succession. Even some in Player's own political camp thought this action was intended primarily &#145;to get fame among the people&#146;  (<span class="italic">Seventh Report</span>, HMC, 475). <br>
<br>In the following months Player actively promoted petitions for a parliamentary session. When the new parliament finally met in October 1680 Player served on the Commons committee that drafted the <span class="roman">Second Exclusion Bill</span>. &#145;Let the Duke be removed&#146;, he challenged the house, maintaining that Londoners were &#145;not afraid of [civil] War&#146;, if that was a necessary consequence of exclusion  (Grey, 7.406). When the Commons adopted the bill he served on a civic committee that drafted a corporation address to the throne requesting Charles &#145;to hearken &amp; incline to the humble Advice&#146; of his parliament  (CLRO, common council journal, 49.157). When the bill was lost in the Lords, Player said, in the Commons, that the citizens of London would &#145;not give [the king] a penny for <i>Tangier</i>, nor any thing else&#146; until the succession and protestantism had been secured  (Grey, 8.10). He also recommended the removal of London recorder Sir George Jeffreys, with whom he had once been friends, for interfering with petitions. <br>
<br>When Charles first prorogued and then dissolved parliament in January 1681 Player was again at the centre of opposition to the king. He was on the civic committee that drafted a petition immediately after the prorogation demanding that parliament resume on the announced date. After his re-election as City MP he sought, reportedly with the assistance of some whig officers of the trained bands, to resume his position as leader of the Honourable Artillery Company and to oust the duke of York as its captain-general. Charles prevented Player's intended coup by himself becoming leader of the company; but this incident and others confirmed loyalist fears that whig leaders were embarking upon the same military courses as their predecessors in the Long Parliament. In the short-lived third Exclusion Parliament at Oxford, Player was on the Commons committee for the impeachment of the informer Edward Fitzharris, and he moved that any judge, JP, or jury who co-operated with the king's plan to have Fitzharris tried elsewhere was guilty of betraying the constitution. After the Oxford dissolution Player was predictably among the promoters of a London petition demanding another parliament that was approved in common council in May 1681. <br>
<br>Player was vulnerable to political retaliation as the loyalist reaction of 1681&#150;3 gathered momentum. John Rouse, one of his London operatives, was taken up on charges of treason in June 1681 and rumours circulated that Player would also be charged, but the dismissal of the government's cases against Rouse and also the earl of Shaftesbury by London juries saved the chamberlain from prosecution. In January 1682 he was elected to the civic committee to defend the London charter against the crown's <i>quo warranto</i>. He thwarted a loyalist effort to congratulate York on his return to the capital in March 1682, recommending another petition for a parliament rather than any honouring of &#145;the chief ground of all &hellip; our miseries &amp; calamities&#146;  (Library of Congress, London Newsletters, 8.28). He was also among those who welcomed Monmouth, the alternative protestant successor, to London in September 1682, after Monmouth's tour of the west country had demonstrated his continuing popularity. <br>
<br>Player's promotion of the London whigs' candidates for the shrievalty in 1682 earned him inclusion in the government's case against leading civic whigs for turning the shrieval election into a riot. He was also active on behalf of the whig mayoral candidates of 1682 before the poll was tweaked by the loyalist aldermen on behalf of tory Sir William Pritchard. Player consequently absented himself from Pritchard's swearing in as lord mayor (leading to stories that he had fled with the City's funds), and he seconded Sir William Williams's threat to impeach Pritchard, informing the new mayor that the citizens of London &#145;would spend their Estates, rather than &hellip; [be] wronged by injustice&#146;  (Library of Congress, London Newsletters, 7.297). <br>
<br>Player's words proved prophetic, at least in his own case. He was already the subject of privy council harassment about his superintendence of funds for the redemption of captives in north Africa. The government's probe soon widened to include his disbursement of money for the army disbandment. The tory electors of his ward ousted him from common council in December. In May 1683 he and the other civic whigs charged with riot were found guilty in king's bench and Player was fined 500 marks. In September 1683, as the corporation's charter hung in the balance, the common hall replaced him as chamberlain. <br>
<br>Blows aimed at Player in the loyalist press were equally damaging. Thomas Otway may have had Player and others in mind in his portrayal of Antonio in <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span> (1682), and John Crowne may have incorporated Player's character into the Podesta of Naples in <span class="italic">City politiques</span> (1683). Satirists nicknamed him Sir Thomas Cresswell in allusion to his alleged intimacy with the notorious Mother Cresswell and her prostitutes. For Dryden he was:<blockquote>
<div>So full of zeal he has no need of grace;<br>
</div>
<div>A saint that can both flesh and spirit use,<br>
</div>
<div>Alike haunt conventicles and the stews.<br>
</div> (Lord and others, 3.294&#150;5)</blockquote>Player apparently stayed clear of the plotting that some whigs engaged in during 1682&#150;3. He was disarmed after the disclosure of the Rye House plot in June 1683 and his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Rouse, who was arrested and charged, apparently offered to implicate Player in treasonable schemes. No evidence appears to have been found against him, however, and Rouse exonerated Player of any wrongdoing from the scaffold. In the meantime Player sought to mend his political fences with Charles II and the duke of York, but his role as one of the leading London campaigners against a Catholic successor was not forgotten. James, who succeeded in 1685 as James II, absolutely refused to forgive him. In 1685 Player's estate was seized until alleged deficiencies of &pound;3250 in his army disbursement accounts were made up. He died, apparently without surviving children, on 14 January 1686 and on 20 January was buried at Hackney, where his wife was also buried on 8 December the same year.<br>
