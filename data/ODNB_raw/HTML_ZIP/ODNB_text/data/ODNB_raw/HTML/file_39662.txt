<span class="headword">Bulloch,  James Dunwoody</span>  (1823&#150;1901), <span class="occ">naval officer and merchant</span>, was born near Savannah, Georgia, USA, on 25 June 1823, the son of Major James Stephens Bulloch (1793&#150;1849), a member of the company which owned the pioneer steamship <i>Savannah</i>, and his wife, Hester Amarintha (1797&#150;1831), daughter of Senator John Elliott. His half-sister Martha married Theodore Roosevelt sen.<br>
<br>James Bulloch joined the US navy as midshipman in 1839 and served in several ships, including the battleship <i>Delaware</i>, before attending the Navy School at Philadelphia from 1844 to 1845. The navy provided a few lieutenants to serve in the east coast&#150;California mail steamers as a means of expanding the pool of steam expertise, and Bulloch was given command of the <i>Georgia</i>. In 1853 he retired from the navy and went into the merchant service, first in the California mails, later sailing between New York and the southern ports. On 19 November 1851 he married Elizabeth Euphemia Caskie (1831&#150;1854) and in January 1857 he married Mrs Harriott Cross Foster (1829&#150;1897), daughter of brevet Brigadier-General Osborn Cross of Maryland. He had five children.<br>
<br>When the American Civil War broke out in 1861 Bulloch resigned, and was commissioned into the Confederate navy and dispatched to England as chief agent. His task was to procure warships, to supplement the hopelessly inadequate fleet&#151;and building capacity&#151;of the South. He naturally based himself in Liverpool, where there were shipyards, good communications with major weapons manufacturers, banking facilities provided by Charles Prioleau, and many Confederate sympathizers in the local business community. By far his most spectacular success was the purchase of the commerce raider <i>Alabama</i> (commissioned 1862), which at one stage he had expected to command, but his superiors rightly placed a higher priority on his procurement activities. Under the command of Captain Raphael Semmes <i>Alabama</i> was so successful as to affect the overall pattern of the war, and was the focus of American outrage, leading to an arbitration arranged by Gladstone's government of 1868&#150;74.<br>
<br>Bulloch negotiated the construction or purchase of eleven further warships in Britain and France, though Union agents succeeded in having seven of these seized by the British and French governments as breaches of neutrality. Three were ironclad ram steamers with turret guns, of such speed and power that they could conceivably have changed the outcome of the war.<br>
<br>Bulloch did not fall within the terms of the amnesty proclamations, which is perhaps unsurprising as he had probably done more harm to the Union war effort than any other one man. Bulloch was unable to return to the USA but his Liverpool friends remained loyal to him, and he set up in business trading as Bulloch and Robertson, commission merchants, reputedly specializing in cotton. He continued to mix in the upper echelons of local society, and lived in the (then) prestigious Upper Parliament Street. In retirement he moved to a smaller house, at the edge of Sefton Park. His daughter Jessie married Maxwell Hyslop-Maxwell jun., a member of a long-established and highly respected family of North American merchants.<br>
<br>In 1883 Bulloch published a remarkable book entitled <span class="italic">The Secret Service of the Confederate States in Europe</span>, which extends to over 900 pages, and describes in minute detail the complex technical, financial, legal, and moral issues involved, along with the espionage, and counter-espionage practised by both sides.<br>
<br>Little is known of Bulloch's personal life or qualities. In Liverpool he remained reticent about his past and was said to have &#145;a distinguished personality, magnetic courtly manners, and was courteous and kind&#146;  (<span class="italic">DAB</span>, 3.258). Theodore Roosevelt jun. visited him three times in Liverpool, and left some descriptions of &#145;Uncle Jimmy&#146;, including the statement that he was &#145;utterly unable to &#147;get on&#148; in the worldly sense of that phrase&#146;  (Roosevelt, 15).<br>
<br>Bulloch died at Maxwell Hyslop-Maxwell's home, 76 Canning Street, Liverpool, on 7 January 1901. He was buried in Smithdown Road cemetery, Liverpool, where his grave is still occasionally visited by historians of the Confederacy.<br>
