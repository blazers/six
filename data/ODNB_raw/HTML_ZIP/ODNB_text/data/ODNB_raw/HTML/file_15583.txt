<div class="para">
<span class="headword">King,  Peter</span>, seventh Baron King  (1775&#150;1833), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 31 August 1775, the eldest son of Peter, the sixth baron, and Charlotte, daughter of Edward Tredcroft of Horsham, and great-grandson of Peter King, first Baron King, lord chancellor. He was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, and succeeded to the title in 1793. After a short tour on the continent he returned to England on coming of age, and took his seat in the House of Lords. True to the whig traditions of his family, he acted with Lord Holland, whose motion for an inquiry into the causes of the failure of the expedition to the Low Countries he supported in his maiden speech on 12 February 1800.<br>
<br>Except to oppose a <span class="roman">Habeas Corpus Suspension Bill</span>, or a bill to prolong the suspension of cash payments by the Banks of England and Ireland, begun in 1797, King at first rarely intervened in debate. He made a profound study of the currency question, and published his findings in a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Restriction of Payments in Specie at the Banks of England and Ireland</span> (2nd edn, 1803). Much enlarged, it was reissued as <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Effects of the Bank Restrictions</span> (1804). In this classic tract King argued that the suspension had caused an excessive issue of notes, particularly by the Bank of Ireland, and a consequent depreciation of the paper and appreciation of bullion, and he advocated a gradual return to the system of specie payment. It was reviewed by Horner in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> (2.402), and attracted much attention, but produced no practical result. As the depreciation increased, King in 1811 gave notice to his leasehold tenantry that he could no longer accept notes in payment of rent, except at a discount varying according to the date of the lease. Ministers, alarmed lest his example should be followed generally, hastily introduced a measure making notes of the Banks of England and Ireland payable on demand legal tender in payment of rent out of court, and prohibiting the acceptance or payment of more than 21<i>s</i>. for a guinea. King opposed the bill, and justified his own conduct in an able and spirited speech (afterwards published as a pamphlet), but it passed into law, and was followed in 1812 by a measure making the notes legal tender in all cases (51 Geo. III, c. 127; 52 Geo. III, c. 50). He sat in the Lords' committee on cash payments in 1819 and took part in the debates on it in 1820, describing an internal failure of consumption, largely due to cash payments coupled with high taxation.<br>
<br>King was from the first, and as long as he lived, a determined opponent of the corn laws, which he denounced as a &#145;job of jobs&#146;. He supported Catholic emancipation and the commutation of tithes, and opposed grants in aid of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, pluralities, and other abuses, and was suspected of a leaning to Presbyterianism (see Antischismaticus, <span class="italic">Hierarchia versus Anarchiam</span>, 1831; and J. T. Law, <span class="italic">A letter to Lord King controverting the sentiments lately delivered in parliament by his lordship, Mr. O'Connell, and Mr. Sheil, as to the fourfold division of tithes</span>, 1832). His long-standing interest in Locke was embodied in his <span class="italic">Life of John Locke</span>, published in 1829 and reissued with extra material in 1830; his hatred of the corn laws and of corruption prompted his <span class="italic">Short History of the Job of Jobs</span> (1825).<br>
<br>King married, on 26 May 1804, Lady Hester Fortescue, daughter of Hugh, first Earl Fortescue and his wife, Hester; they had two sons, William, created Lord Lovelace in 1838, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15584/', "Peter John Locke King")</script>. King died suddenly on 4 June 1833 at his house in Dover Street, London, and his widow died aged eighty-nine in 1873 at their home, Brooklands, in Weybridge, Surrey. As Henry Brougham's praise of his capacity and character testifies, King's unexpected death ended a career of increasing distinction.<br>
