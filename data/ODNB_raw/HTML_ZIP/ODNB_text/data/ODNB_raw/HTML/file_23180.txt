<span class="headword">Rawle,  Francis</span>  (<em>c.</em>1660&#150;1727), <span class="occ">writer on trade and finance</span>, was probably born in Plymouth, the son of Francis Rawle and his wife, Jane. He was descended from an old Cornish family of some wealth and standing, once settled near St Juliot on the north Cornish coast and later in the Plymouth region. Both father and son were Quakers, and were persecuted for their religious belief and imprisoned together at Exeter in 1683. On this account they obtained a grant from William Penn, left Plymouth in the <i>Desire</i>, and arrived at Philadelphia on 23 June 1686.<br>
<br>Rawle first settled on 2500 acres in New Plymouth, where he founded the society known as the Plymouth Friends. He married Martha, daughter of Robert Turner, an Irish merchant, in 1689; they had ten children. The family moved to Philadelphia, where Rawle's substance and talents, and wealth from his marriage, soon brought him to note. In early 1689 he became a justice of the peace and judge of the court of common pleas; under the charter of 1691 he was one of six aldermen of Philadelphia; and in 1692 he became deputy registrar of wills and in 1694 commissioner of property. He sat in the assembly between 1704 and 1709, and was appointed again from 1719 to 1726. As a member Rawle participated in most of the important committees of the house, including that dealing with currency issues.<br>
<br>It was for contributions to this field that Rawle is principally remembered. Pennsylvania, like other colonies at the time, faced a continual shortage of hard currency in the form of gold and silver coin due in part to laws forbidding the export of British coinage. Attempts by colonial governors to attract hard currency by raising its value had led Westminster to introduce paper money as the principal means of trade. In <span class="italic">Some Remedies Proposed for Restoring the Sunk Credit of the Province of Pennsylvania</span> (1721), Rawle called for the issue of a limited amount of paper money secured by land, and for its acceptance as full legal tender to prevent future depreciations of value. He was fully involved in the currency committee's drafting of the <span class="roman">Paper Money Act</span> (1723).<br>
<br>In two further works, <span class="italic">Ways and Means for the Inhabitants of Delaware to Become Rich</span> (1725) and <span class="italic">A Just Rebuke to a Dialogue betwixt Simon and Timothy</span> (1726), Rawle stressed the importance of achieving a favourable balance of trade, by stimulating exports and controlling imports through tariffs on such items as West Indian rum. Rawle died in Philadelphia on 5 March 1727.<br>
