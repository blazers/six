<span class="headword">Lacy,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1610&#150;1671), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the son of Thomas Lacy of Beverley in the East Riding of Yorkshire and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Franceys of Beckingham, Nottinghamshire. His date of birth is derived from the information that he was aged fifty-six (or in his fifty-sixth year) in 1666. The Lacy family had long been known for recusancy and in September 1631 Thomas was examined by the president of the council in the north for alleged involvement in furthering the Catholic cause. William Lacy was admitted, probably before 1629, to St John's College, Cambridge, graduated BA in 1632, and proceeded MA in 1636. Admitted as a fellow of his college on 5 April 1636, he acted as tutor during 1640&#150;42. He proceeded BD in 1642 and was made preacher at St John's at Michaelmas 1643.<br>
<br>Lacy was a co-author with John Barwick and others of <span class="italic">Certain Disquisitions and Considerations Representing to the Conscience the Unlawfulness of the Oath Entituled, a Solemn League and Covenant</span> (1644); the sheets were seized by the parliamentarians, but the book was reprinted at Oxford. Ejected from his fellowship in 1644 Lacy attached himself to the royalist army, and evidently became chaplain to Prince Rupert, for he was present at the storming of Bridgwater by Sir Thomas Fairfax on 23 July 1645 and was listed shortly afterwards as &#145;Lacy, priest to Prince Rupert&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fairfax's Letter</span>, 6). In prison, he soon became impoverished, but survived thanks to the generosity of John Barwick. It seems that Lacy inherited his father's property at Beverley, though he may have been forced to sell. On 19 April 1648 he was listed as one of the Hampshire persons already sequestrated. Before 1 September 1651 he compounded for a fine of &pound;26, one-sixth of the value of his estate, but on 21 November of the same year he claimed in a deposition to the committee of &#145;debts he owed to several persons before 20 May 1642, total &pound;44. Also that &pound;30 debts, for which he compounded, have since become desperate, and are not likely to be paid&#146;  (Green, 3.1382).<br>
<br>On the return of Charles II, Lacy was restored to his fellowship by a warrant from the earl of Manchester dated 27 August 1660 and executed on 2 November. He was also presented by the king on 1 October 1660 to the prebend of South Cave in the diocese of York, but the appointment did not take effect and the prebend lapsed. At Cambridge, Lacy was admitted on 4 November 1661 to a senior fellowship; he was recommended by the king for the degree of DD on 3 October 1662, an honour awarded the following year. In 1669 he contributed &pound;5 towards the building of the third court at St John's College. On 13 October 1662, now aged over fifty, at St Mary's Church, Leicester, Lacy married one Ann Dan (<i>d</i>. 1686), a widow; this was probably Ann, daughter of William Sherman, a gentleman of Newark, Lincolnshire, baptized in the same parish on 11 January 1618; the couple appear to have had one child, a son, William, who was born on 25 July 1663 but who was buried a few days later on 12 August. Ten days after his marriage, on 23 October 1662, Lacy was presented by Sir George Savile to the rectory of Thornhill, near Dewsbury, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, in the place of the ejected minister. The parish register records that on 8 November 1662 &#145;Dr Will. Lacy inducted into the Rectory of Thornhill and Joshua Witton overturned&#146;  (Charlesworth, 1.172). There he rebuilt the rectory house, destroyed during the civil wars. It was evidently a very substantial building, for Lacy was assessed in 1666 for nine hearths.<br>
<br>Lacy died at Thornhill on 12 May 1671 and was buried next day in the church, where a stone was laid to his memory. In his will, dated 7 September 1670, he provided &pound;350 in reversion, for two exhibitions of &pound;8 each, to be taken up at St John's by boys from Beverley grammar school.<br>
