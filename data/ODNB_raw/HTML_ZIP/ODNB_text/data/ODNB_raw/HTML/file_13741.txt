<span class="headword">Scott,  James Robert  Hope-</span>  (1812&#150;1873), <span class="occ">barrister</span>, born on 15 July 1812 at Marlow, Buckinghamshire, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13712/', "General Sir Alexander Hope (1769&#150;1837)")</script> of Rankeillour and Luffness, and grandson of John Hope, second earl of Hopetoun. His mother was Georgina Alicia (<i>d</i>. 1855), third and youngest daughter of George Brown of Ellerton, Roxburghshire. Hope's childhood, from 1813 to 1820, was spent at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, of which his father was the founder and first governor. James Hope (as he then was) then joined his parents and a tutor, William Mills, of Magdalen College, Oxford, on a continental tour which took in Dresden, Lausanne, and Florence. After a year at Kepier grammar school, Houghton-le-Spring, under the Revd William Rawes (1823&#150;4), he entered Eton College at Michaelmas 1825. There he was a pupil of the Revd Edward Coleridge. He left Eton in December 1828 and spent much of the following year in Paris as the guest of the duchesse de Gontaut, governess to the French royal family. He went into residence at Christ Church, Oxford, at Michaelmas 1829 and graduated BA in November 1832 with an honorary fourth class in classics. On 13 April 1833 he was elected a fellow of Merton College, and early in 1835 began legal studies at Lincoln's Inn under the eminent conveyancer John Hodgkin (1800&#150;1875), a Quaker, and William Plunkett, conveyancer of the Temple.<br>
<br>A new era in Hope's life began in 1836 with the beginning of an intense friendship with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10787/', "W. E. Gladstone")</script>, his slightly older contemporary at Eton and Christ Church, and with the lawyer Edward Badeley (1803&#150;1868). He was now one of a group of devout young laymen practising a strict rule of life and dedicated to philanthropic activity on behalf of organizations such as the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, and the Children's Friend Society for Emigration. As fellow and bursar of Merton College he developed an interest in its early history, and in 1838 produced a report urging a return to the ideals of its founder as expressed in its statutes. His ideas on the religious reformation of the university in the spirit of Walter de Merton and William Waynflete were expanded in an article on the Magdalen College statutes which he wrote for the <span class="italic">British Critic</span> in 1840, at the request of J. H. Newman. His long friendship with Newman began in 1838.<br>
<br>Hope held Gladstone in thrall by the fascination of his personality, and exercised a strong influence on Gladstone's mind and actions over a period of fifteen years (1836&#150;51). It was he who saw Gladstone's work on church&#150;state relations through to publication in 1838. Between 1840 and 1843 he was closely involved with Gladstone and H. E. Manning in plans for the foundation at Glenalmond, Perthshire, of a college for the education of the Scottish Episcopalian clergy. On an Italian tour with Badeley, from September 1840 to May 1841, he made a close study of ecclesiastical education and developed an admiration of the Society of Jesus. He had designed Trinity College, Glenalmond, which opened in 1847, to be a seminary, but in the event it came to function primarily as a public school.<br>
<br>On 24 January 1838 Hope graduated BCL at Oxford, and two days later was called to the bar at the Inner Temple. In 1840 he was junior counsel on behalf of the deans and chapters petitioning against the <span class="roman">Ecclesiastical Duties and Revenues Bill</span>, and when on 24 July the bill came before the Lords on second reading he made his reputation by a masterly speech of three hours' duration before a full house. Gladstone later recalled it as the most impressive display of oratory he had heard in his lifetime. In August 1840 Hope was appointed chancellor of the diocese of Salisbury. It might have been expected that he would make his career as an ecclesiastical lawyer, but instead he chose the more neutral ground of the parliamentary bar, specializing in railway legislation. He rapidly built up an immensely lucrative practice, in due course becoming standing counsel to almost every railway company in the United Kingdom, and his representations to parliamentary committees largely helped to establish railway law. In one year alone he saw twenty-five bills through parliament for the London and North-Western Company. He achieved a notable triumph in 1857 as counsel for the corporation of Liverpool in their opposition to the <span class="roman">Mersey Docks and Conservancy Bill</span>. Here he indulged in an uncharacteristically florid encomium of Liverpool, enquiring whether it was to become &#145;forsooth, the Piraeus of such an Athens as Manchester&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 2.115). His manner in committee was normally imperturbable and brisk.<br>
<br>In the early 1840s Hope was closely identified with the Tractarian movement and became J. H. Newman's confidant. The establishment of the Anglo-Prussian see of Jerusalem in the winter of 1841 prompted him to publish a vigorous protest. On 10 February 1845 he resigned the chancellorship of Salisbury, but the process of his separation from the Church of England was long drawn out. The Gorham trial and judgment of 1849&#150;50 and Newman's lectures on the difficulties of Anglicans in 1850 brought his religious crisis to a head. He was received into the Roman Catholic church at Farm Street, west London, along with his friend H. E. Manning, on 6 April 1851. His conversion was a grievous blow to Gladstone, who owned to feeling &#145;unmanned and unnerved&#146;  (Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 4.325). Hope was dropped as Gladstone's executor, and the friendship never recovered its former intimacy.<br>
<br>On 19 August 1847 Hope married Charlotte Harriet Jane Lockhart (<i>d</i>. 1858), only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16904/', "John Gibson Lockhart (1794&#150;1854)")</script> and his wife, Sophia Scott (1799&#150;1837), and granddaughter of Sir Walter Scott. She became a Catholic soon after his own conversion. In August 1848 he became the tenant of Abbotsford, which he rented from his wife's brother, Walter Lockhart Scott. At the latter's death on 10 January 1853 he became, by right of his wife, the owner of Abbotsford, and thereupon assumed the surname of Hope-Scott. He made substantial alterations to the house. In 1855 he purchased the estate of Dorlin, near Loch Shiel, in an area of the west highlands largely populated by Catholics, and built a house there. In all, he spent some &pound;40,000 during the last thirteen years of his life on the building of Catholic churches and schools in Scotland. In 1859 he was involved with his friend and fellow convert Serjeant Edward Bellasis (1800&#150;1873), and with J. H. Newman, in the foundation of the Oratory School, Birmingham. Hope-Scott was the main adviser and major fund-raiser in this project to establish a Catholic public school.<br>
<br>Charlotte Hope-Scott died in childbed on 26 October 1858, and their new-born child on 3 December; Walter Michael, the infant son and heir (born on 2 June 1857), died eight days later. On 7 January 1861 Hope-Scott married again, his second wife being Lady Victoria Alexandrina (<i>d</i>. 1870), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13916/', "Henry Granville Fitzalan-Howard, fourteenth duke of Norfolk (1815&#150;1860)")</script>. The duke had died on 25 November 1860, leaving Hope-Scott guardian of his heir, who was still a minor. He and Edward Bellasis were also joint trustees of Lord Edmund Howard, to whom the Alton Towers estates had been devised by Bertram Arthur Talbot, seventeenth earl of Shrewsbury. After much litigation, a considerable portion of the property was secured to Lord Edmund.<br>
<br>On 22 August 1867 Queen Victoria visited Abbotsford. In the same year Hope-Scott bought the Villa Madona at Hy&egrave;res, in the south of France, where much of his later life was passed. In 1867 he wrote the magisterial statement which contributed to the repeal of the <span class="roman">Ecclesiastical Titles Act</span>. His second wife died in childbed on 20 December 1870, nine days after giving birth to a son, James Fitzalan: from this second blow Hope-Scott never recovered. He withdrew from his legal practice and his health declined. In his final years he occupied himself with an abridgement of Lockhart's <span class="italic">Life of Sir Walter Scott</span>, published in 1871 with a preface addressed to Gladstone. He died at his London home, 7 Hyde Park Place, on 29 April 1873. Newman preached at the requiem at Farm Street on 5 May and the interment took place at St Margaret's Convent, Edinburgh, on 7 May.<br>
<br>Hope-Scott's only surviving child from his first marriage, Mary Monica (<i>b</i>. 1852), married in 1874 Joseph Constable Maxwell, third son of William, Lord Herries, who assumed the name of Scott in right of his wife as heir of Abbotsford. From his second marriage Hope-Scott left a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33972/', "James Fitzalan Hope, later created Baron Rankeillour (1870&#150;1949)")</script>, and three daughters.<br>
<br>Strikingly handsome in appearance, fastidious and reserved in manner, decisive in the conduct of his profession, and possessed of a strong sense of duty, Hope-Scott was a man who preferred to exercise influence rather than power, and seemed detached from worldly success. It is a paradox that the disciple of Walter de Merton and Walter Scott should have made his fortune as the leading advocate of the railway age. Something of the spell which he cast in his youth can be felt in the posthumous tributes of his closest friends, Gladstone and Newman  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 2.252&#150;65, 2.273&#150;87).<br>
