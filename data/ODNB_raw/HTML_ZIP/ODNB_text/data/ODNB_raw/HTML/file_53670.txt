<span class="headword">Fiske,  Nicholas</span>  (1579&#150;1659), <span class="occ">astrologer and medical practitioner</span>, was born on 22 July 1579 at Stadhaugh, in the parish of Laxfield, Suffolk, the oldest surviving son of Matthew and Elizabeth Fiske and from a long-established landed family. Though well educated, he chose to study astrology and physic at home instead of going to university. He was described as a &#145;licentiate in physick&#146; and he practised medicine at Colchester (though he is not recorded in the roll of the College of Physicians), where he became well acquainted with the physician William Gilbert, author of <span class="italic">De magnete</span> (1600). He later described himself as &#145;iatromathematicus&#146;, which suggests that he put his astrological skills to use in the practice of medicine.<br>
<br>Fiske married Judith Reade, daughter of William Reade, minister of Trinity Church, Colchester (probably about 1630); they had two sons and five daughters. In 1633 he was summoned to London by Dr Thomas Winston of Gresham College, to instruct Lord Treasurer Weston's son in arithmetic and astronomy. He settled in Covent Garden, and had a good practice both in astrology and physic. One of his astrological clients was the lawyer Sir Robert Holborne, John Hampden's counsel in the &#145;ship money&#146; case, who paid Fiske &pound;100 to calculate his nativity. William Lilly, who became a close friend following Fiske's move to London, described him as &#145;very studious, laborious, of good Apprehension&#146;, and highly proficient in astrology, physic, astronomy, and mathematics  (Lilly, 28). Fiske's standing was also recognized by Sir Francis Kynaston, who appointed him professor of astronomy at his short-lived Musaeum Minervae, a college founded on utilitarian principles in Covent Garden in the mid-1630s.<br>
<br>In 1650, encouraged by his friends Lilly and Elias Ashmole, Fiske published Sir Christopher Heydon's <span class="italic">An Astrological Discourse</span>, having acquired the manuscript after the death in 1616 of Dr Richard Forster, to whom Heydon had presented it. Fiske had tried to publish it before the civil war, but had been blocked by the clerical censors. He commended the work to the newly established Society of Astrologers, in the hope that it would inaugurate an astrological renaissance in England. Lilly described Fiske as a diffident man and a poor teacher; John Gadbury, by contrast, declared him an excellent teacher despite his lack of fluency, adding that he was &#145;a Gentleman of a very Pious, Exemplary and vertuous Life&#146;  (Gadbury, <span class="italic">Obsequium</span>, 113). Fiske enjoyed substantial receipts from his medical and astrological practice, which he kept up for sixty years, and a rental income of &pound;100 a year from his property in Suffolk. Gadbury records, however, that he died relatively poor, having lost most of his wealth through the malice of his enemies. He died in London &#145;of a lingering Consumption&#146;  (Gadbury, <span class="italic">Collectio</span>, 128) on 7 February 1659 and was buried at St Paul's Church, Covent Garden, on 9 February. His younger son Matthew was also a well-known astrologer.<br>
