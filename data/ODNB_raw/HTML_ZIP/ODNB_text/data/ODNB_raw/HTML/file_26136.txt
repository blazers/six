<span class="headword">Spencer, Sir  Robert Cavendish</span>  (1791&#150;1830), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born on 24 October 1791, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26125/', "George John Spencer, second Earl Spencer (1758&#150;1834)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Lavinia, eldest daughter of Charles Bingham, first Earl Lucan, and the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26133/', "John Charles Spencer, Viscount Althorp and third Earl Spencer")</script>, <a href="#cosubject_26122">Frederick Spencer, fourth Earl Spencer [<i>see below</i>]</a>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38714/', "George Spencer")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38715/', "Sarah Lyttelton")</script>. He was educated at Harrow School. In August 1804 he entered the navy on the <i>Tigre</i> (Captain Benjamin Hallowell, afterwards Carew), and served continuously with him, in the <i>Tigre</i> and afterwards in the <i>Malta</i> (being promoted lieutenant on 13 December 1810) until appointed to command the brig <i>Pelorus</i> in October 1812. On 22 January 1813 he was promoted commander of the <i>Kite</i>, from which he was moved into the <i>Espoir</i>, one of the squadron off Marseilles, under the command of Captain Thomas Ussher. He was afterwards appointed to the <i>Carron</i>, employed on the coast of North America, served in the operations against New Orleans, and was promoted to post rank by the commander-in-chief, Sir Alexander Inglis Cochrane, on 4 June 1814. In 1815 he commanded the <i>Cydnus</i> on the home station, and from 1817 to 1819 the frigate <i>Ganymede</i> (26 guns) in the Mediterranean, where he successfully negotiated with the bey of Tunis. From 1819 to 1822 he commanded the <i>Owen Glendower</i> on the South American station, and from 1823 to 1826 the frigate <i>Naiad</i> (46 guns) in the Mediterranean, where he took an active part in the operations against Algiers in the summer of 1824, and himself concluded the agreement with the bey. He was later employed on the coast of Greece during the Greek War of Independence. During these years of peace service, and especially in the <i>Naiad</i>, Spencer acquired a reputation in the service as a first-rate gunnery officer and disciplinarian. When the <i>Naiad</i> was paid off, she was spoken of as the perfection of a man-of-war. Spencer's reputation in the service ensured that his ships were always crowded with young aristocrats and the sons of senior naval officers. Had he lived, his career, which had been remarkably good under his political opponents, would have prospered.<br>
<br>From August 1827 to September 1828 Spencer was private secretary and groom of the bedchamber to the duke of Clarence, then lord high admiral. Spencer worked closely with Clarence on important reforms concerning gunnery, steam power, and manning. However, his liberal politics and advanced views ensured that he was widely blamed for the breakdown of relations between Clarence and Sir George Cockburn, the leader of his council. In October 1828 he was nominated a KCH, and he was knighted on 24 November. In September 1828 he was appointed to command the <i>Madagascar</i>, again in the Mediterranean. He had just been recalled to England on his appointment as surveyor-general of the ordnance, when he died, off Alexandria, on 4 November 1830, from &#145;an inflammation of the bowels&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 82). He was buried at Malta. He never married.<br>
<br>His younger brother, <a name="cosubject_26122"></a><span class="headword">Frederick Spencer</span>, fourth Earl Spencer  (1798&#150;1857), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born on 14 April 1798, entered the navy on 18 September 1811. After serving as lieutenant under his brother in the <i>Owen Glendower</i>, Spencer commanded the brig <i>Alacrity</i> on the South American station. After promotion to captain on 26 August 1826, he was appointed to the frigate <i>Talbot</i>; he commanded her with distinction at the battle of Navarino on 20 October 1827, and in subsequent operations on the coast of the Morea. For these services he was made a CB (13 November 1827) and was decorated by the kings of France and Greece, and by the tsar. On 23 February 1830 he married his second cousin, Elizabeth Georgina (<i>d</i>. 10 April 1851), daughter of William Stephen Poyntz MP, of Cowdray Park, Midhurst. They had three children; the only son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36209/', "John Poyntz Spencer")</script>, later became the fifth Earl Spencer.<br>
<br>In 1831 Spencer was MP for Worcestershire, and afterwards for Midhurst (between 1832 and 1834, and 1837 and 1841). On the death of his eldest brother, he succeeded as fourth Earl Spencer, on 1 October 1845. From 1846 to 1848 he was lord chamberlain of the queen's household; he was made a KG on 23 March 1849, and in 1854 was appointed lord steward. On 9 August 1854 he married Adelaide Horatia Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 29 Oct 1877), daughter of Sir Horace Beauchamp Seymour. They had two children: Charles Robert became in 1910 the sixth Earl Spencer. A lifelong whig, Spencer was regarded by his children as a serious and reserved man. He died a vice-admiral on the retired list on 27 December 1857.<br>
