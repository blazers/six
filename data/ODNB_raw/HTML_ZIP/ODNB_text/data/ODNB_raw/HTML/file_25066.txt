<span class="headword">Selwyn,  George Augustus</span>  (1809&#150;1878), <span class="occ">bishop of New Zealand and bishop of Lichfield</span>, was born on 5 April 1809 at Church Row, Hampstead, Middlesex. He was the second of the four sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25068/', "William Selwyn (1775&#150;1855)")</script>, barrister, and Laetitia Frances Kynaston (<i>d</i>. 1842), and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25064/', "Sir Charles Jasper Selwyn (1813&#150;1869)")</script> and of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25069/', "William Selwyn (1806&#150;1875)")</script>. He went when aged seven to Dr Nicholas's Preparatory School in Ealing, where J. H. Newman (the future cardinal) and his brother Francis were fellow pupils. Selwyn then went to Eton College, where he acquired a reputation both as a scholar and as an athlete, and in 1827 he proceeded as a scholar to St John's College, Cambridge. A rowing blue in 1829, he took his BA in 1831, coming second in the classical tripos, and his MA in 1834, and was elected a fellow of his college.<br>
<br>After Cambridge, Selwyn taught at Eton while employed as private tutor to two sons of the earl of Powys. Ordained deacon in June 1833 he was briefly honorary curate at Boveney; ordained priest a year later, likewise on Trinity Sunday and at St George's, Hanover Square, London, he settled as curate to the vicar of Windsor, Isaac Gossett. He broke off his engagement to Anna, daughter of Eton's headmaster John Keate, and subsequently married Sarah Harriet (1809&#150;1907), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23568/', "Sir John Richardson")</script>, on 25 June 1839. Of their four children, only the two eldest sons survived, William and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25067/', "John Richardson Selwyn")</script>.<br>
<br>At Windsor Selwyn's practical talent for organizing church life and his preoccupation with church order began to show. Highly critical of whig plans for reforming the Church of England and taking his cue from W. E. Gladstone, he circulated privately in 1838 his pamphlet <span class="italic">Are Cathedral Institutions Useless?</span> He argued against disendowment and for the revision of cathedral statutes based on his knowledge of Ely. He wanted the reinvigoration of cathedrals under episcopal leadership, in order to create diocesan centres for training ministers, teaching, providing for diocesan councils or synods, organizing missionary work, and assisting the poor. Reflecting the influence of the early Oxford Movement, these principles guided him subsequently in both New Zealand and Lichfield.<br>
<br>At this time the need for more colonial bishoprics was acutely felt by church leaders concerned to combat the global spread of nonconformity and Roman Catholicism. With the establishment of British rule in 1840 and the likely rapid expansion of white settlement, New Zealand's requirement was rated most highly. Although his brother William refused the new diocese, George Selwyn accepted readily and was consecrated at Lambeth on 17 October 1841; he took his Cambridge DD degree the following week, and sailed from Plymouth on Boxing day.<br>
<br>In New Zealand resources never permitted Selwyn to build the Norman-style cathedral which the Camden Society at Cambridge had advised him was appropriate to Maori understanding. But his foundation of St John's College, with its school &#145;to be conducted upon the plan (<i>mutatis mutandis</i>) of Eton&#146; and its provision for training clergy, first at Waimate and from 1844 at Auckland, gave expression for a decade to his wish for an active diocesan centre. Selwyn spent five years becoming familiar with New Zealand. An imposing, energetic man, he travelled extensively, appointed archdeacons to help him, and convened synods of his clergy in 1844 and 1847. At the latter gathering, he issued his primary charge defining the principal issues facing his diocese.<br>
<br>Selwyn was convinced that missions should be proper church institutions under episcopal leadership, rather than societies of lay enthusiasts, and he supported the Tractarian ideal of the &#145;missionary bishop&#146;. If this made his relationship with the Church Missionary Society (CMS) sometimes difficult, those problems were exacerbated by misunderstanding and difficulties of communication with England. He was soon in dispute with the society at home over questions of missionary placements and ordination. Locally he was drawn into a bitter wrangle with some CMS missionaries, which culminated in the society's dismissal of Henry Williams. Selwyn's part arose less from differences over authority than from his thoughtlessness, and from a concept of missionary work and desire for volunteers which led him to support Governor Grey's wish to reduce missionaries' private landholdings.<blockquote>The position of a Missionary in New Zealand requires his undivided attention to the natives &hellip; very little benefit has resulted from the combination of Agriculture with Missionary duties. &hellip; It is seldom that much good results in England from the union in the same person of the office of Clergyman and Landlord. (Evans, 38&#150;9)</blockquote>Selwyn's anti-Erastianism also showed itself in his persistent search both for the funds and for the endowments which would make the New Zealand church self-sufficient and for ways of increasing its powers of self-government. His discovery in 1854 that no legal obstacles prevented the holding of diocesan synods in colonial sees opened the way, in the absence of resistance from the imperial government, for colonial clergy and laity to meet and to regulate the affairs of their churches. Having seized the opportunity, Selwyn finally completed a draft constitution for the Church of New Zealand in 1857 and secured its adoption at the first general synod in 1859. Although he was opposed to disestablishment in Britain, by the late 1860s this movement in New Zealand had accomplished the final separation of church and state. Not only did other colonial churches follow this example, but support for Selwyn's practice from bishops in Australia, Canada, and South Africa contributed much to the subsequent development of the church both in England and throughout the Anglican communion.<br>
<br>The same relentless activity characterized Selwyn's approach to the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and the western Pacific. Committed to a fundamental racial equality, Selwyn insisted on a liberal interpretation of the treaty of Waitangi, under which British authority had been acquired, and he was from the beginning a staunch defender of Maori rights, especially those of land sale and tenure. For this he was frequently attacked by settlers and their supporters in Britain such as Joseph Hume and J. A. Roebuck, especially from the time of the northern war of 1845&#150;6. Nevertheless he constantly mediated in both inter-Maori disputes and conflicts between Maori and white settlers (Pakeha). Requiring all his clergy to learn Maori, as he had done on his first voyage from England, Selwyn was responsible for the revision of the Maori <span class="roman">Bible</span> and prayer book. Although criticized by some for delaying the ordination of Maori converts, in consequence of his expectations of the same standards for them as for European candidates in matters of behaviour and scholarship, there is little ground for doubting his conviction of the urgent necessity for a native ministry. That ministry began to emerge early in the 1860s but, along with Selwyn's attempts to promote Maori welfare, rights, and education, it was scarcely strong enough to survive the impact of the wars of the 1860s. This left the church's work among the Maori in ruins, though in many places Selwyn's personal reputation was only enhanced by his unselfish assistance of the wars' victims.<br>
<br>Selwyn's work with the Pacific islanders rested on the regular voyages he began in 1847. Exploiting an error in his letters patent, which extended his diocese as far as latitude 34&deg; N, he systematically visited the islands and brought young islanders to St John's for schooling, returning them at regular intervals to instruct their own people. He gained support from the Australasian bishops' conference in 1850 for his oversight of the Melanesian mission, raised &pound;10,000 as an endowment for a bishopric during his visit to Britain in 1854, and finally secured the consecration of his friend J. C. Patteson as bishop of Melanesia in 1861. There, as in New Zealand itself, persuading English church leaders and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG) of the need for the subdivision of his huge see went hand in hand with Selwyn's attempts to secure the leadership of the infant church in the hands of like-minded friends. His success was reflected in the appointment of bishops C. J. Abraham, Henry Harper, and Edmund Hobhouse. Towards nonconformists he was civil and co-operative&#151;for instance, in negotiating missionary spheres of activity with the presbyterians and the London Missionary Society. But his sympathy was limited by what he saw as their rejection of Anglicanism's comprehensiveness and the opportunity it offered for Christian unity.<br>
<br>At the first Lambeth conference, summoned in September 1867 to address colonial issues, Selwyn played a leading role in asserting the freedom of colonial churches to link themselves voluntarily with the Church of England. While in Britain he was admitted honorary DCL by Oxford University and, mindful of his own insistence on the principle of clerical obedience to ecclesiastical superiors, he very reluctantly accepted episcopal appointment to the diocese of Lichfield. Enthroned on 9 January 1868 he returned to New Zealand for a brief farewell.<br>
<br>At Lichfield the mark of the missionary bishop was soon made. The cathedral's statutes were revised and the laity further involved in diocesan affairs, and the theological college's work was expanded. Closer relations with the Canadian and American churches were fostered by Selwyn's visits in 1871 and 1874, and home missions as well as interest in overseas missionaries were greatly encouraged as a stimulus to the life of the whole church. With no more time for middle-class comforts or conventions than for finer points in theological debate, Selwyn was ever the active reformer and invigorator. He died on 11 April 1878 at the bishop's palace, Lichfield. For Gladstone, who attended his burial in the grounds of Lichfield Cathedral both as a lifelong friend and as godfather to his eldest son, he was &#145;one of the band of great Bishops&#146;  (Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 16 April 1878). Selwyn College, Cambridge, was erected by subscription in his memory.<br>
