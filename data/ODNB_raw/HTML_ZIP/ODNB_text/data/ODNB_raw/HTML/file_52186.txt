<span class="headword">Le Fayre,  Mark</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1417/18), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, is of uncertain origins, but his unusual names, and his interest in Freefolk, Hampshire, point to a connection with the baronial Husee family, possibly as an illegitimate son. Sir Mark Husee, heir to the lord of Freefolk, died in 1346, and the surname Le Fayre may signify the vair (ermine) of the Husee arms. Husee contacts, including the earls of Arundel, perhaps helped him make his way.<br>
<br>Le Fayre, who entered the Winchester merchant guild in 1366 or 1367, came to dominate that city's long-distance commerce in a way that no single merchant had done in earlier and more prosperous times. He dealt in woollen cloth, for the making and finishing of which Winchester became a notable centre in his time, and imported large quantities of Gascon wine through Southampton. Between 1383 and 1408 he regularly sold wine in Winchester. He also shipped wine from Southampton to London, and by 1400 was supplying it to the king. Between 1371/2 and 1404/5 he exported cloth through Southampton. His sales of cloth in Winchester were on a smaller scale. In 1408 he was the only merchant not a Londoner to sell cloth to the royal household, and in 1414 claimed to be owed nearly &pound;448 for cloth and wine supplied to Henry IV. He also imported woad, iron, oil, wax, and salt, and supplied woad and potash to the Winchester dyeing trade. On occasion he shipped wool to Calais and exported corn to Bordeaux. An entrepreneur in the cloth industry, he put out work to weavers and supervised a dyehouse. He had debtors, including clergy and knights, in London and at least five counties.<br>
<br>Le Fayre rose high in Winchester and was often active in the capital on its behalf. His first known civic position was as a bagman (collector of revenues) in 1377, and in 1378&#150;9 he was the senior bailiff. He represented Winchester in seven of the nine parliaments between 1385 and 1395, and in six between 1399 and 1417. First elected as mayor for 1398&#150;9, he held the office four more times (1402&#150;3, 1408&#150;9, 1411&#150;12, 1413&#150;14). Constable of the Winchester staple in 1390&#150;91, he was aulnager for Hampshire between 1408 and 1415, and had a royal commission to seize Flemish ships in 1415.<br>
<br>Le Fayre's earliest known property holdings were for commercial use, and included shops in Winchester High Street where cloth was sold, a shop with the same speciality in St Giles's Fair outside Winchester, a stone cellar on a prime site for wine dealing in Southampton, and a wine tavern in Winchester, all acquired well before 1400. His spacious Winchester residence occupied a secluded site, but was in Parchment Street, close to High Street and the cloth-working district. He was probably living there by 1381, but only as tenant of the Inkepenne family, wool merchants before 1350 whose wealth probably exceeded Le Fayre's. His occupancy of the house where they had lived was a sign of success. About 1400, when he would have been well over fifty, his career became more sedentary, a change marked by tenure of the mayoralty, a shift in investment from trade to rents, and probably a more direct engagement in cloth production. He built several houses, a sound investment since, despite the contraction of the city, rents for good-quality buildings rose until about 1410. In that year he purchased tenements which he rebuilt as an inn, a prominent place of resort in High Street. At the same time he organized the repair of an inn belonging to the city, promising to lend money for the enterprise should it be needed. In 1412 the net annual value of his lands in Winchester, Southampton, Romsey, Freefolk, and Wiltshire (probably Salisbury) was given as &pound;46. The estate reflects his interest in towns associated with the cloth trade, and is notable for its lack of rural holdings, apart from his country seat at Freefolk acquired in 1403. In 1417 his Winchester holdings alone brought in about &pound;34, one of the most valuable rent rolls in the city.<br>
<br>By 1386 Le Fayre had married his first wife, Joan. Later he made provision for properties to descend to his daughter Catherine and her heirs. By 1398 Catherine had married John Newman, a Salisbury merchant who died in 1402. Later that year she married Henry Somer (<i>d</i>. 1450), a rising and highly regarded crown servant. Le Fayre stood surety for Somer more than once, and with him acquired property in London. The two men probably began their alliance before 1400, possibly in connection with the Southampton wine trade and through the influence of Somer's patron, Archbishop Thomas Arundel (<i>d</i>. 1414). Joan died in 1410, and in the following year Le Fayre married Agnes Langestoke. At that time he settled Freefolk on Somer and Catherine, and arranged for his Winchester freeholds to be settled on himself, Agnes, and his heirs. Somer gained control of the Winchester property early in 1417, and just over year later, Le Fayre having died around the end of 1417, bought out Agnes's claim. A fortune created by a Winchester merchant thus came to contribute a regular, if declining, income to an influential official based in London. The city of Winchester later acquired the freeholds and commemorated Le Fayre and Joan as benefactors.<br>
