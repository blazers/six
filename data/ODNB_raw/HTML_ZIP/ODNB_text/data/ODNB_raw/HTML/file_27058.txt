<span class="headword">Taylor, Sir  John</span>  (1771&#150;1843), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 29 September 1771, the son of Walter Taylor of Castle Taylor, co. Galway, and his second wife, Hester, daughter of Richard Trench, and sister of William Power Keating Trench, earl of Clancarty. He entered the army in November 1794 as ensign in the 105th foot, became lieutenant in the 118th on 6 December, and captain in the 102nd on 9 September 1795. He was brigade major and aide-de-camp to Major-General Trench during the 1798 Irish uprising, and was aide-de-camp to General Hutchinson during the 1799 campaign in the Netherlands and that of Egypt in 1801. He had been transferred to the 26th foot on 30 October 1799, but was soon afterwards placed on half pay. He was made a brevet major on 2 September 1801, and a lieutenant-colonel on 28 February 1805.<br>
<br>On 18 May 1809 Taylor was made lieutenant-colonel in the 88th (Connaught Rangers), and went to Cadiz in command of the 2nd battalion in 1810. In the following winter it joined Wellington's army within the lines of Torres Vedras. It was attached to the light division, and after Mass&eacute;na's retreat it took part in the combat of Sabugal (3 April 1811). A year afterwards it was sent home, having been reduced by a large draft to the 1st battalion to make up for its losses at Badajoz. On 4 June 1813 Taylor was made brevet colonel. He returned to Spain soon afterwards, and on 9 September took command of the 1st battalion, which formed part of the 3rd division. He commanded it until the end of the war, and received the gold medal with two clasps for Nivelle, Orthez, and Toulouse. At Orthez he was severely wounded.<br>
<br>Taylor was made CB for his Peninsular services and afterwards KCB (17 October 1834). He was promoted major-general on 12 August 1819, and lieutenant-general on 10 January 1837. On 15 March 1837 he was made colonel of the 80th foot.<br>
<br>Taylor married Albinia Frances, daughter of St John Jeffreys of Blarney Castle, co. Cork, and widow of Lieutenant-Colonel Freemantle; they had two daughters. Taylor died in London on 8 December 1843.<br>
