<span class="headword">Rattray,  Thomas, of Craighall</span>  (1684&#150;1743), <span class="occ">Scottish Episcopal bishop of Dunkeld</span>, was the eldest son of James Rattray (<i>d</i>. 1692), laird of Craighall, near Blairgowrie, Perthshire, and Elizabeth, daughter of Sir George Hay of Megginich. He succeeded as laird at his father's death on 13 July 1692. In 1713, when he was twenty-nine, Rattray sought baptism by immersion and confirmation from Bishop John Falconer, probably as the necessary canonical preliminary to ordination. By 1724 at least he was one of the clergy in the former diocese of Brechin. He married Margaret (<i>c</i>.1690&#150;1737), daughter of Thomas Galloway, second Lord Dunkeld, and they had two sons, including the golfer and physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64814/', "John Rattray")</script>, and three daughters.<br>
<br>Rattray came to prominence in the Scottish Episcopal church as a theologian. In 1716 he assisted Bishop Nathaniel Spinckes in translating into Greek the English nonjurors' abortive proposal for a union between themselves and the Greek Orthodox church. In 1718 the English nonjurors appealed to the Scottish bishops for a ruling in their dispute over the use of ancient eucharistic ceremonies and prayers for the dead. The Scottish bishops offered only to mediate rather than to decide the issue and turned to Rattray as a recognized expert in the matter. He advised the occasional use of the opposite form by both parties, but this was unsatisfactory to both sides. The same controversy also divided the Scottish Episcopal church where it was further complicated by the usagers' support for the Scottish communion office, a liturgy derived from the Scottish prayer book of 1637.<br>
<br>In 1720 this growing division among episcopalians was deepened by disagreement over whether the episcopate should govern the church as a council of non-territorial bishops, or as diocesan bishops. The issue was inflamed in that year when Bishop John Fullarton accepted election to the diocese of Edinburgh. Diocesan episcopacy had been avoided by episcopalians since the revolution of 1688, the bishops governing their church collectively as a college. Fullarton's unilateral acceptance of a diocesan title was seen by the anti-usager bishops as a usurpation of the royal nomination of bishops which, as Jacobites, they accorded to the son of James Stuart, claimant to the British throne. The bishops managed to thrash out some agreement for the sake of their disorganized church by circulating a pastoral letter in February 1723 against the liturgical usages as ill-advised in the present predicament of their legally proscribed church. They also required the clergy to sign an agreement to that effect. Rattray responded in the tract <span class="italic">Some Remarks on the Circular Letter of the Edinburgh Bishops</span>. In this he set out his arguments for diocesan episcopacy as the only recognized form in the early church, asserting that a non-diocesan bishop could not claim authority over the clergy and laity within that district. In common with the usager party among the English nonjurors, he claimed that the usages were necessary for the celebration of the eucharist because their use in the early church pointed to their institution by Christ himself. Rattray also opposed the subscription required of the clergy as beyond the jurisdictions of non-diocesan bishops; as valuing peace more than truth; and as illegitimate because there was no authorized single form of liturgy and ceremonies in the Episcopal church.<br>
<br>After the death of Bishop Falconer in July 1723, Rattray became the leader as well as the theologian of the usager and diocesan party of Scottish Episcopalians. Consequently he was chosen by the majority usager clergy and laity of the diocese of Brechin to succeed Falconer. However, the college bishops' majority resulted in the appointment of their candidate, Robert Norrie, though Rattray lodged a long and learned protest against overturning the clergy's election. On Norrie's death in 1727 the usager party grew in strength among the bishops when the Brechin clergy repeated their election of Rattray. He was consecrated at Edinburgh on 4 June 1727 by Primus Arthur Millar, and bishops James Gadderar and Andrew Cant, despite protests from the college party. Rattray's elevation was one of a series of rival consecrations by both parties designed to augment their respective strengths.<br>
<br>As bishop of the diocese encompassing Angus, the Mearns, and Perthshire east of the River Tay, Rattray experienced the same divisions that he was partly responsible for among the bishops. Leading male managers of the congregation in Perth had become accustomed to controlling their church, regarding the clergy as paid employees who carried out their instructions. They opposed Rattray on the apparent grounds of an anti-usages position, but underlying the division was a conflict between attitudes to lay and ordained authority in which Rattray's high theology of ordained authority inevitably conflicted with the managers' desire for unimpeded control of the Perth congregation. Rattray initially sought to avoid conflict by being cautious about his episcopal authority, but in 1740 a schism occurred over the managers' unilateral appointment of a new incumbent, with the managers refusing Rattray's offer of a neutral referee. Consequently Rattray proceeded to the deposition of the incumbent, being unprepared to accept public flouting of his divine authority as bishop.<br>
<br>Rattray had already set out his theology of episcopacy as divinely instituted in his <span class="italic">Essay on the nature of the church, and a review of the elections of bishops in the primitive church</span> (1728), which became a standard theological work in episcopalian circles. The ability of determined laity to oppose Rattray ostensibly from an anti-usage position demonstrates that a concordat in 1731 between the two parties of bishops had not resolved episcopalian divisions. In that document the declining power of the collegers was evident in their agreement to divide Scotland into ten dioceses and in their acceptance of appointment to dioceses through the principle of election rather than royal nomination. Diocesan episcopacy having been achieved, the usages controversy was resolved in an agreed compromise to permit both the Scottish and English liturgies. Rattray relinquished his claim to be bishop of Brechin to the leading colleger bishop, John Ochterlonie, and was henceforth accepted as bishop of Dunkeld (1732). However, it did require a visit by Rattray to his old diocese to reconcile his supporters there to being governed by the leading college bishop.<br>
<br>After many years of bitter and conscientious division, rancour still continued among the bishops and their clerical and lay supporters. Rattray therefore proposed to Primus David Freebairn that an episcopal synod be held to reconcile the bishops' divisions. In 1738 the bishops, in Edinburgh for this proposed synod, divided along the usual lines over whether or not Bishop Gavin Dunbar could send a priest as his proxy, to which the collegers objected. Consequently the diocesans met separately and, as now they were the majority of the bishops, they proceeded to elect Rattray as primus in place of Freebairn. It meant that a younger and more vigorous man replaced an old and infirm one, but the partisan election only exacerbated the differences between the leaders of a dwindling church. This impasse was only solved by default with the death of Freebairn in 1739. Rattray then offered his resignation as primus, which was unacceptable to the bishops of his party who now virtually monopolized the episcopate.<br>
<br>As primus Rattray endeavoured to embody in his church the findings of his theological scholarship, and to develop a working structure for his disorganized church. However, he only had a free hand for this following the death of his able opponent Ochterlone in 1742. His scholarship and his authority were consistently behind the use of the Scottish communion office as against the eucharistic liturgy of the English <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. His proposed code of canons formed the basis of the original code accepted after his death by the episcopal synod in 1743. But in a reversal of his earlier views as primus, Rattray objected to independent action by the clergy as, for example, in 1739 when the Edinburgh clergy maintained their rights against the episcopal synod in an election for their new bishop.<br>
<br>Most of Rattray's theological works were published posthumously, including his edition of <span class="italic">The Ancient Liturgy of the Church of Jerusalem</span> (1744). Rattray believed this liturgy to be so ancient that he was anxious for the Scottish communion office to conform to it. A liturgical adaptation along these lines was actually produced by Rattray, although probably only used in his private chapel on his estate at Craighall, Perthshire. It was published as an appendix in the 1748 edition. His liturgical work was more influential in shaping the definitive edition of the Scottish communion office of 1764. Another posthumous work was <span class="italic">Some particular instructions concerning the Christian covenant, and the mysteries by which it is transacted and maintained</span> (1748). These and other unpublished sermons and dissertations were published in 1860 by the high-church episcopalian theologian George Forbes through his private Pitsligo Press. Rattray died on 12 May 1743, probably in Edinburgh, aged sixty.<br>
