<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kosterlitz,  Hans Walter</span>  (1903&#150;1996), <span class="occ">pharmacologist</span>, was born on 27 April 1903 in Berlin, the son of Bernhard Kosterlitz, medical practitioner, and his wife, Selma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lepman. Both Kosterlitz and his brother followed their father into medicine. Kosterlitz was educated at the universities of Heidelberg, Freiburg, and Berlin. His leanings were towards laboratory-based research, and he wrote his first scientific papers while still a medical student in Berlin. He gained his MD in 1928, and remained in Berlin for five years as an assistant in the first medical department, following his early interest in biochemistry, and studying the altered sugar metabolism in diabetic patients.<br>
<br>Though not Jewish, Kosterlitz was evidently dismayed by developments in Germany, and in 1934 he decided to join the laboratory of John James Rickard Macleod, the regius professor of physiology in Aberdeen. Macleod had recently returned from Toronto, and was famous as one of the co-discoverers, with Frederick Grant Banting and Charles Herbert Best, of insulin. Though Aberdeen may have seemed a somewhat remote scientific outpost, Macleod's laboratory had great appeal for researchers in the field of diabetes. Macleod died only a year after Kosterlitz joined his laboratory, but the latter carried on his research into carbohydrate metabolism for another fifteen years. He was appointed a Carnegie teaching fellow in 1936 (the year in which he received his Aberdeen PhD), and lecturer in physiology in 1939. On 9 March 1937 he married Johanna Maria Katharina 
    (Hanna; <i>b</i>. 1905/6)
  , daughter of Heinrich Gressh&ouml;ner, farmer. They had one son, Michael.<br>
<br>Early in the Second World War Kosterlitz was briefly interned, but he soon returned to Aberdeen to contribute to the training of medical students, and to work on what he saw as a more urgent topic than diabetes, namely the effects of nutrition on liver function. He was appointed senior lecturer in 1945, and reader in physiology in 1955. In the early 1950s he decided to change direction scientifically, and he turned his attention to the autonomic nervous system, particularly the control of peristalsis, the rhythmical propulsive action of the gastrointestinal tract. A brief period at Harvard in 1953&#150;4, working with Otto Krayer (a distinguished expatriate German pharmacologist whom Kosterlitz had known in Berlin), kindled his interest in pharmacology, and he learned of a paper published by Paul Trendelenburg in 1917 showing that the plant alkaloid morphine powerfully inhibited peristalsis. In Aberdeen he devoted himself to studying the peristaltic reflex in isolated segments of intestine suspended in organ baths, and using this preparation to analyse the actions of morphine on the nerves involved in peristalsis. At that time several other laboratories were studying morphine's effects on the brain, and there was scepticism about the relevance of Kosterlitz's painstaking pharmacological work on the intestine. He revealed much later that he had harboured from the beginning the idea that morphine, a plant-derived substance, might be acting as a surrogate for an endogenous chemical mediator, and that his undisclosed ambition had been to discover its nature.<br>
<br>Kosterlitz remained a reader in physiology at Aberdeen for thirteen years until 1968 when, at the age of sixty-five, he became professor and head of the newly created department of pharmacology at Aberdeen. This finally gave him the opportunity, denied for many years, to build up and lead his own department, and he made the most of it. His group turned its attention to carrying out careful quantitative pharmacological studies of the effects of morphine-like drugs on different animal tissues. Through these studies, they showed unequivocally the existence of three types of opiate &#145;receptor&#146; (specialized binding molecules through which drugs exert their specific physiological effects). Simultaneously, other groups in Sweden and the United States came to similar conclusions by studying the binding of opiate drugs to different tissues. The discovery of specific receptors suggested the existence of an endogenous chemical mediator which, like morphine, produces physiological effects when it becomes attached to the receptor; Kosterlitz's long cherished belief in the existence of endogenous &#145;opioids&#146; thus gained considerable credibility.<br>
<br>At this critical point Kosterlitz, then seventy, had to retire from his university post, but he stayed on as director of a new, independently funded unit for research on addictive drugs, which he led for another twenty-two years. John Hughes, deputy director, played a major part in the unit's very successful research. They immediately set about identifying the mysterious endogenous substance, starting from copious extracts of pig brain, and using the pharmacological assays for morphine-like substances that they had perfected. After many set-backs, they succeeded in 1975 in isolating two novel peptides (leu- and met-enkephalin), which were the elusive endogenous opioid peptides. These short peptides, containing only five amino acids, were soon found within the sequence of much longer peptides (endorphins) produced by the pituitary gland, which also belong to the endogenous opioid family. This family of mediators, and the associated receptors, quickly became the focus of intense worldwide research activity, and proved to be involved in many brain functions, including pain perception, drug dependence, learning and memory, endocrine secretions, and much else. Kosterlitz's discovery thus represented an important scientific breakthrough, which was the basis for many subsequent advances in the pharmacology of the nervous system.<br>
<br>Kosterlitz had an infectious enthusiasm for his work, and reciprocated the affection and respect of numerous younger colleagues. His many distinctions included fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1951), the Schmiedeberg Plakette of the German Pharmacological Society (1976), fellowship of the Royal Society (1978), the Albert Lasker award (1978), the royal medal of the Royal Society (1979), and honorary degrees from the universities of Li&egrave;ge, Aberdeen, St Andrews, and Dundee. Despite two serious strokes, and other illnesses in later life, he remained active as a scientist in Aberdeen (publishing his last paper in 1991) until shortly before his death, of bronchopneumonia and cerebrovascular disease, at Rowan Court, Cults, Aberdeen, on 26 October 1996; he was buried at Newhills cemetery, Aberdeen. He was survived by his wife, Hanna, and son, Michael, professor of theoretical physics at Brown University.<br>
