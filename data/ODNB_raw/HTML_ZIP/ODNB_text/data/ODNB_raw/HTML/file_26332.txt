<span class="headword">Stawell, Sir  William Jonas Foster</span>  (1815&#150;1889), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician in Australia</span>, the third son of Jonas Stawell (1769&#150;1840) of Oldcourt, Cork, and his wife, Anna Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1833), the daughter of William Foster, bishop of Clogher, was born at Oldcourt on 27 June 1815. Educated from 1832 at Trinity College, Dublin, as a pensioner, he graduated BA in 1837. He then studied law both at King's Inns, Dublin, and Lincoln's Inn, and was called to the Irish bar in 1839. A big man of over 6 feet in height, he was described by his wife as &#145;ruddy and of fair countenance&#146; with &#145;wonderfully expressive eyes of a bright chestnut colour&#146;  (M. Stawell, 21).<br>
<br>After practising for a time at the bar in Dublin, Stawell emigrated to Melbourne in 1842, was admitted to practice at the local bar, and quickly obtained a reasonable share of the work. He also joined in some pastoral pursuits with a cousin, J. L. F. V. Foster (later Foster-Vesey-Fitzgerald). He rapidly became one of the leading members of the bar. He took an active part in politics, helped to form the Anti-Transportation League, and strongly supported the separation of the Port Phillip district from New South Wales.<br>
<br>In 1851 Stawell became a member of the nominated legislative council and the first attorney-general of the newly erected colony. He held this office until 28 November 1855, drafting and conducting through the council the early laws of the colony. He also took an active part in the preparation of the new <span class="roman">Constitution Act</span> in 1854&#150;5. To him are due the names &#145;legislative council&#146; and &#145;legislative assembly&#146; for the two chambers. As attorney-general Stawell was in the forefront of the government's handling of the rebellion on the goldfields which culminated in the Eureka stockade in 1854 and in the prosecutions which followed. He met with much opposition and obloquy, but his strength and patience triumphed over attacks. Henry Samuel Chapman thought him almost the only efficient member of the government, and many considered that his firmness saved the state.<br>
<br>In 1856 Stawell married Mary Frances Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1921), the daughter of Lieutenant William Pomeroy Greene RN, of Woodlands, Victoria.<br>
<br>The new constitution came into force in November 1855, but it was almost a year before the first elected parliament assembled. Stawell was elected to the legislative assembly as member for Melbourne. He took office at once as attorney-general, but on 25 February 1857 he retired from political life on becoming the second chief justice of Victoria. He was knighted later that year. Apart from his judicial duties, he devoted his time during the following years chiefly to furthering the progress of the Church of England and of education in the colony. He was a staunch supporter of Bishop Charles Perry, by whom he had been converted from an agnostic to a devout churchman, and drafted a constitution for the church in Victoria which introduced for the first time anywhere in the world participation by the laity in the government of the Church of England. In 1879 he became one of the first lay canons of St Paul's Cathedral.<br>
<br>In 1873 Stawell went on leave to England for nearly two years. In 1875, and again in 1877, he acted as governor of the colony, and on the second occasion was confronted with an unusual problem. The conservative Kerferd government applied to Stawell for a dissolution but was refused. Kerferd resigned and Stawell sent for Berry, who, being unable to carry his tariff proposals, applied for a dissolution which was also refused. Berry resigned and a short-lived government was formed by Sir James McCulloch. There was much contemporary controversy about Stawell's decisions. He again acted as governor from March to July 1884. In August 1886 he resigned his office as chief justice, and in the following year was appointed lieutenant-governor of Victoria. In January 1889 he left for Europe in order to reinvigorate his health, but he died at Naples on 12 March, and was buried in the English cemetery. He was survived by his wife, six sons, and four daughters.<br>
<br>Stawell was a fair judge with a strong sense of justice, and a sound lawyer. For many years he was one of the most prominent figures in public life in Victoria. He was an enthusiastic promoter of exploration. He was president of the Philosophical Institute (afterwards the Royal Society) of Victoria in 1858&#150;9, and was closely associated with the foundation of Melbourne University in 1853 (for a short time he was its chancellor). He was a trustee of the public library, and president of the Melbourne Hospital and other charitable organizations. He became LLD of Dublin in 1873 and of Melbourne in 1875, and KCMG in 1886.<br>
