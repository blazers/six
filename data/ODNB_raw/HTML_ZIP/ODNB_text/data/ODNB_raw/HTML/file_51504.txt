<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kelly,  Barbara</span>  (1924&#150;2007), <span class="occ">performer and television personality</span>, was born on 5 October 1924 in West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Her father was an Irishman who worked as a lorry driver; her mother originally came from Manchester. Her childhood was not happy, and she hated the ballet and elocution classes forced on her by her stage-struck mother. Leaving school early, she nevertheless took up modelling, and joined an amateur dramatic company, performing at the Vancouver Little Theatre. It was during a performance there in 1940 that she was spotted by a cast member then rehearsing for a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) radio production of the York and Chester mystery plays. She was cast as the Virgin Mary, and it was while working on this production that she met her future husband, <a name="cosubject_51504"></a><span class="headword">Bernard Chastey Braden</span>  (1916&#150;1993), <span class="occ">actor and broadcaster</span>. Braden, also from Vancouver, was born on 16 May 1916, the son of Edwin Braden, a nonconformist minister, and his wife, Mary, a music teacher. After an education at local schools he began work in 1935 as a radio singer, then an announcer and engineer. After contracting tuberculosis, which interrupted his career for a year, he returned to radio, writing and performing for the CBC.<br>
<br>Recalling his first meeting with Kelly during rehearsals, Braden wrote that it was not only her outstanding beauty that drew attention: &#145;It was the voice that caused a hush. The range was incredible &hellip; I thought it phenomenal. So did everyone else&#146;  (Braden, 16). Her precocious talent and microphone technique led to her gaining a permanent place in the CBC's radio repertory company, while continuing her work as a fashion model. She and Braden were married on 13 April 1942, after which the couple moved to Toronto, where Braden continued to write and perform for the CBC; together they starred in a highly successful radio serial, <span class="italic">John and Judy</span>. They had three children between 1943 and 1948, Christopher, Kelly, and Kim.<br>
<br>In 1947 CBC sent Braden to Britain to make a series of documentaries on post-war recovery. It was a short working trip, but the material gathered for these programmes formed the basis of a book, <span class="italic">These English</span> (1948). In 1949 he was back in the UK, this time with Kelly. The couple quickly established themselves as popular entertainers on stage and radio, their bright, lively personalities, attractive accents, and warm humour endearing them to British audiences. Braden played the part of Harold Mitchell in Laurence Olivier's production of <span class="italic">A Streetcar Named Desire</span>, which opened at the Aldwych Theatre later the same year. Both Braden and Kelly were in demand separately in radio dramas, and Kelly became a hit in the West End show <span class="italic">Male Animal</span>, also in 1949. Although she appeared in a number of stage shows subsequently, she confessed that she never liked the medium, being much happier on radio, and later television. In May 1949 the couple appeared in a one-off situation comedy about two Canadians living in London, called <span class="italic">Leave Your Name and Number</span>. The show was so successful that the BBC developed it as a full series, starting in April 1951.<br>
<br>By this time Braden had established himself with the hugely successful <span class="italic">Breakfast with Braden</span>, a Saturday morning comedy and music series that was first aired in January 1950. The format was preserved when the programme moved to an evening slot in September 1950, becoming <span class="italic">Bedtime with Braden</span>, when Braden was joined by Kelly. In June of that year the couple appeared on the cover of the <span class="italic">Radio Times</span>. Braden's impact on British radio audiences of the time may be judged by an article in the 1951 edition of the <span class="italic">BBC Year Book</span>:<blockquote>One of the more mobile, quick-firing units in the current Canadian invasion of British entertainment is a one-man blitz named Bernard Braden &hellip; So far nobody has explained whence Braden derives the energy that has rocketed him to stardom in only a year. (<span class="italic">BBC Year Book</span>, 92&#150;3)</blockquote>In 1951, the still-young BBC Television featured <span class="italic">An Evening at Home with Bernard Braden and Barbara Kelly</span>.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Bedtime with Braden</span> continued to run for a further four series, but in 1953 Kelly left the show to join the television panel game with which she was to become most associated, <span class="italic">What's my Line</span>. Chaired by Eamonn Andrews, and featuring the panellists David Nixon, Gilbert Harding, Isobel Barnett, and Kelly, the format was a simple one: members of the public would perform a short mime, from which the panel attempted to guess their occupation. Broadcast on Sunday evenings on the only television channel available until the launch of ITV in 1955, <span class="italic">What's my Line</span> was almost compulsory viewing for those families possessing a television set. It ran until 1963, and in 1984 it was revived, running for a further three years, with Kelly and Andrews the only survivors of its original cast.<br>
<br>During the early 1950s Kelly also appeared in a number of films, among them <span class="italic">A Tale of Five Cities</span> (1951), <span class="italic">Glad Tidings</span> (1953), and <span class="italic">Love in Pawn</span> (1953). These were undistinguished works, but they helped to subsidize the Bradens' flamboyant lifestyle, with a large flat in Knightsbridge and a fine house in Hampstead. By the start of the 1960s Kelly was one of the best-known personalities on British radio and television. Over the next decade, however, her career was eclipsed as her husband's moved into the ascendant. From 1962 to 1968 Braden presented the programme for which he is best remembered, <span class="italic">On the Braden Beat</span>, for ATV. With this programme and its BBC successor, Braden created a new genre; the programme, a pioneering example of consumer television, won a BAFTA award in 1964, and Braden became the Variety Club's personality of the year in 1965. In 1968 he presented a BBC version in a similar format, <span class="italic">Braden's Week</span>, which ran until 1972, when Braden was sacked, allegedly for presenting a margarine commercial on ITV. The broadcaster Esther Rantzen, a researcher on the show, later went on to present <span class="italic">That's Life</span>, a television programme much like <span class="italic">Braden's Week</span> in style and format. Although Rantzen always acknowledged her debt to Braden, Kelly remained bitter about the chain of events.<br>
<br>From the 1970s onwards the careers of both Kelly and Braden were in decline; despite some further occasional radio, television, and stage work, they were never again to reach the remarkable heights of popularity and public acclaim they had enjoyed during the 1950s and 1960s. During this time they developed Adanac Productions (Adanac being Canada spelt backwards), specializing in presentations at business conferences. Kelly also started an agency offering advice on career development to celebrities and, through her company Prime Performers, supplied the services of entertainers and broadcasters as after-dinner speakers.<br>
<br>In May 1987 Kelly was operated on for throat cancer. This was successful, but it left her face scarred and from this time she became more reclusive. In 1990 Braden published his memoirs, <span class="italic">The Kindness of Strangers</span>, and in 1992 the couple celebrated their golden wedding anniversary. Despite being in poor health herself, Kelly nursed her husband through a series of strokes. At the time of his death, at the Royal Free Hospital, Hampstead, London, on 2 February 1993, following a heart attack, Braden was working on a second volume of autobiography. In 2000 Kelly set up a new company, Speakerpower, &#145;specialising in personal training for everyone who has to speak in public&#146;, and utilizing the services of successful broadcasters and performers as trainers. Suffering from cancer, she died of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at the Marie Curie Hospice, Camden, London, on 15 January 2007. She was survived by her two daughters, her son Christopher having predeceased her. By the time of their deaths, radio and television trends had changed out of all recognition, and Kelly's and Braden's last years were spent in relative obscurity. Nevertheless they had had a remarkable influence on post-war British media over a period of nearly thirty years. Kelly, vivacious, charming, attractive, was a breath of fresh air and a household name on both radio and television, while Braden deserves recognition not only for his extreme versatility, but for his major contribution to broadcasting by pioneering consumer television.<br>
