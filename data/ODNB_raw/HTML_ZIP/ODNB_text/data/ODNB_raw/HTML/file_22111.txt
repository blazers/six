<span class="headword">Philippa</span> <span class="st"> [Philippa of Lancaster]</span>  (1360&#150;1415), <span class="occ">queen of Portugal, consort of Jo&atilde;o I</span>, was the first child and elder daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14843/', "John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster (1340&#150;1399)")</script>, and his first wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54463/', "Blanche of Lancaster (1346?&#150;1368)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14843/', "John of Gaunt")</script>]. In September 1372 she and her sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54443/', "Elizabeth")</script> were sharing a household with their brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12951/', "Henry (the future Henry IV)")</script>, and in 1376 the sisters' governess was their father's mistress, Katherine Swynford [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26858/', "Katherine, duchess of Lancaster")</script>]. Philippa was a well-educated woman, who in later life habitually read the book of <span class="roman">Psalms</span>; a copy of John Gower's English poem <span class="italic">Confessio amantis</span> was probably sent to her in Portugal, and won her approval. The French poet Eustace Deschamps's characterization of her as chief patron of the order of the Flower in England places her at the centre of courtly debates relating to May day celebrations. In Portugal her love of courtly games with her ladies was remarked on.<br>
<br>Philippa remained unmarried until her twenty-seventh year: her father had frequently used her marriage in diplomacy. In 1374 she was contracted to Gaston de Foix (Ph&eacute;bus), count of Foix; in 1381&#150;2 she was offered to Jean de Blois, claimant to the duchy of Brittany, and in 1383 to Count William of Ostrevant, the heir to Hainault, Holland, and Zeeland. Gaunt took her on his expedition to claim the Castilian throne in 1386; after he was established in Galicia, Jo&atilde;o I of Portugal (1357&#150;1433) offered to marry her, and this was agreed on as part of the alliance made between the two princes at Ponte do Mouro in November. The betrothal and nuptials took place at Porto during February 1387, before the necessary papal dispensation for the marriage had been issued. In July Philippa miscarried while visiting Jo&atilde;o, who lay seriously ill at Curval, but the births of other children followed rapidly. Branca, born in 1388, and Afonso, born in 1390, both died in infancy. Then came the future Duarte I (1391&#150;1438), Pedro, duke of Coimbra (1392&#150;1449), Henrique 
    (Henry the Navigator; 1394&#150;1460)
  , Isabel (1397&#150;1471), who married Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, Jo&atilde;o (1400&#150;1465), and Fernando (1402&#150;1443).<br>
<br>Besides ensuring the succession for the new Portuguese dynasty (the house of Avis), Philippa was important in fostering links between Portugal and England, a trend facilitated by the mixture of Portuguese and English servants in her household. She was on good terms with both Richard II and her brother Henry IV. In 1399 she wrote to Thomas Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury, asking him to assuage her brother's anger with her friend Bishop Henry Despenser of Norwich, which probably stemmed from the bishop's attempt to defend Richard's cause against Henry's invasion. Philippa was instrumental in persuading Henry to foist Jo&atilde;o's illegitimate daughter, Beatriz, on the earl of Arundel as his bride in 1405. She and her English servants had some cultural influence in Portugal. She introduced the use of Sarum to Lisbon Cathedral. One of its canons, the Englishman Robert Payn, translated Gower's <span class="italic">Confessio amantis</span> into Portuguese. The historian Fern&atilde;o Lopes (secretary to Philippa's son Fernando) pictured her as a model queen, obedient to her husband, pious, charitable, and affable. She died of plague on 18 July 1415 at Odevillas, and was buried in October 1416 in the Dominican friary founded by her husband at Batalha. Their magnificent tomb, with their effigies clasping hands, is in the Capela do Fundador, constructed on Jo&atilde;o's orders between 1426 and 1434.<br>
