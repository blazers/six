</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Borrow,  George Henry</span>  (1803&#150;1881), <span class="occ">writer and traveller</span>, was born on 5 July 1803 at East Dereham in Norfolk, the son of Captain Thomas Borrow (1758&#150;1824), adjutant of the West Norfolk militia, and his wife, Ann (1772&#150;1858), daughter of Samuel Parfrement, a farmer. His elder brother was John Thomas Borrow.<br>
<br>The Napoleonic wars ensured that the family put down no roots. The West Norfolks were posted up and down the country, and even after Waterloo saw service in Ireland. Borrow's schooling was sporadic: a year at the high school in Edinburgh in 1813&#150;14 and another at Norwich grammar school in 1814&#150;15 represented his longest continuous periods of education until, in May 1816, the family at last settled in Norwich.<br>
<br>Borrow returned to Norwich grammar school, but in March 1819 he was articled to a firm of solicitors. He did not apply himself to the law, preferring to visit the Gypsies on Mousehold Heath and to study a variety of languages. One of his tutors was William Taylor, Norwich's foremost intellectual and iconoclast, who turned Borrow's thoughts to the literary field. Borrow also showed signs of being fired by Taylor's radicalism, but that did not last. Translations by Borrow&#151;from German, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, and Spanish&#151;started appearing in Sir Richard Phillips's <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>, and he longed to live by his pen. Two days after his articles expired, and a month after his father's death, he took the coach to London on 1 April 1824. When it became obvious that there would be no other employment than ill-paid hack work for Phillips, the depression from which he had suffered intermittently since childhood returned to plague him. His main task, under Phillips's direction, was to compile <span class="italic">Celebrated Trials</span> (6 vols., 1825). He also contributed to Phillips's periodicals and brought out a translation of Klinger's <span class="italic">Faustus</span> (1825); but a year in Grub Street convinced him that he must escape from London. In <span class="italic">Lavengro</span>, he would describe writing <span class="italic">The Life and Adventures of Joseph Sell, the Great Traveller</span> in order to find enough money to do so. None of the attempted identifications of this claimed work has proved valid.<br>
<br>Then came several obscure years, the first few months of which were treated with a liberal seasoning of imagination in <span class="italic">Lavengro</span> and <span class="italic">The Romany Rye</span>. Whether there was, in life, someone as important to Borrow as Isopel Berners was to Lavengro is an unsolved puzzle. For the most part Borrow drifted along, alternating between Norwich and London. Much time was spent fruitlessly on translations; only his <span class="italic">Romantic Ballads, Translated from the Danish</span> appeared in print (1826). Stories of extensive foreign travel must be heavily discounted. Borrow was almost thirty before he found, in 1833, employment with the British and Foreign Bible Society. In maturity, he always expressed allegiance to the Church of England, and a strong antipathy for Roman Catholicism: but in introducing him to the Bible Society, his sponsor said Borrow was &#145;of no very exactly defined denomination of Christians&#146;. Borrow impressed the society not just by his appearance&#151;he was an imposing 6 foot 3 inches, with prematurely grey hair&#151;but by his linguistic capacities. They sent him to St Petersburg (1833&#150;5) to oversee the printing of a Manchu version of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, and then to Portugal and Spain (1835&#150;40) to distribute the scriptures. In Russia and the Peninsula Borrow worked energetically, and sometimes heroically, on the society's behalf. In Spain, civil war made his expeditions risky, while the hostile attitude of the authorities, coupled with his own provocative approach, led twice to his imprisonment. He was still able to pursue his linguistic and translating interests. In St Petersburg he produced <span class="italic">Targum</span>, a volume of translations from thirty languages, and <span class="italic">The Talisman &hellip; with other Pieces</span>, from Russian and Polish (both 1835). In Madrid the Bible Society financed the printing of St Luke's gospel translated into Spanish Romani by Borrow and Gypsy friends, and also a Basque version, where Borrow's editorial role was minor (both 1838).<br>
<br>By the time his last Spanish tour began, it was clear that Borrow's future with the Bible Society was limited. Increasingly he concerned himself with his own affairs, completing the groundwork for a few books, and thinking up new territory to explore. In mid-1839 he was joined, in the large house he rented in Seville, by a 43-year-old widow and her 21-year-old daughter, Mary and Henrietta Clarke, with whom he had become acquainted shortly before entering the Bible Society's service. Mary Clarke needed to escape from family litigation at home; but all along, she seems quietly to have taken the initiative with Borrow. When he at last complied with the Bible Society's recall, he sailed in the company of the Clarkes. Three weeks later, on 23 April 1840, he married Mary Clarke in London.<br>
<br>Borrow settled on his wife's little estate on the shores of Oulton Broad in Suffolk and began turning his experiences to literary account. After a modest start with <span class="italic">The Zincali</span> (2 vols., 1841), a book about the Gypsies of Spain and elsewhere, he had a runaway success in 1843 with <span class="italic">The Bible in Spain</span> (3 vols.), a stirring account of his adventures in the Peninsula which also satisfied the evangelical temper of the 1840s. He then turned to his earlier life, gradually discovering that he had to transform reality into his own apprehension of the truth. He had set himself a standard of unusual incident which was difficult to maintain, and had dropped hints of further adventures which he was ill placed to substantiate. In 1844, dogged by low spirits, he embarked on his last foreign journey, a solitary expedition across Europe to Constantinople, seeking to compose his mind and find new material. Relief was no more than partial and temporary. In the end, he fashioned two books which followed episodically, from birth to early manhood, the fortunes of a complex character (not necessarily always himself as he was or had been), with much satirical comment on society and religion. Only by stopping in mid-narrative was he able to send the part he called <span class="italic">Lavengro</span> to John Murray, his impatient publisher. When it appeared in 1851, its intermingling of imagination and reality puzzled many readers and irritated others. The sequel, <span class="italic">The Romany Rye</span> (1857), seemed an even greater mystification.<br>
<br>In 1853 Borrow moved to Great Yarmouth with his wife and stepdaughter, without abandoning their home at Oulton. The Yarmouth years were punctuated by walking tours in which he covered many hundreds of miles in Norfolk, Cornwall, Wales, the Isle of Man, Scotland, and Ireland. From one of them <span class="italic">Wild Wales</span> emerged (1862)&#151;a classic on Wales and the Welsh, seen through the eyes of a very unusual Englishman. At the same time he completed <span class="italic">Celtic Bards, Chiefs and Kings</span>, published in 1928, long after his death. He also published a translation of Ellis Wynne's <span class="italic">The Sleeping Bard</span> in 1860 just before he moved to London, where he did little writing apart from working at translations and the like. After his wife died in 1869, there were few people to turn to for company, and a proposal of marriage to Lucy Brightwell, a Norwich friend from childhood, was declined. He delivered his swansong, <span class="italic">Romano Lavo-Lil</span>, to Murray and went back to East Anglia&#151;&#145;to die&#146;, he said. The book, published in 1874, was poorly received by the new generation of Romani scholars who were following the trail he had blazed. It was the only one of his principal works to make no money during his lifetime; his income from the others amounted to &pound;3366 over forty years.<br>
<br>Borrow died at Oulton on 26 July 1881 (of &#145;decay of nature&#146; according to his death certificate) and was buried beside his wife in Brompton cemetery. His reputation had long been in decline, but revived towards the close of the nineteenth century. Borrow's bibliography is swelled by articles, reviews, compilations, and, above all, his beloved translations: but his enduring legacy was a handful of original works unlike any others, episodic narratives capturing the imagination with strange and at times superbly presented characters and powerful picaresque sketches. Pervading them all is the opinionated but compelling personality of their narrator.<br>
