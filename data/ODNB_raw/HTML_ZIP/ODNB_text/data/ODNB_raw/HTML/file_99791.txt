<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lumsden, Sir  Peter Stark</span>  (1829&#150;1918), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Mathura, India, on 9 November 1829, the fourth son in the family of six sons and five daughters of Colonel Thomas Lumsden (1789&#150;1874), Bengal artillery, of Belhelvie Lodge, Aberdeenshire, and his wife, Hay (<i>d</i>. 11 October 1873), youngest daughter of John Burnett of Elrick, Aberdeenshire. His eldest brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17184/', "Sir Henry Burnett (Harry) Lumsden (1821&#150;1896)")</script>, an officer in the Indian army; his youngest brother, Hugh David Lumsden (1844&#150;1928), became a land surveyor and railway builder in Canada.<br>
<br>Following an education at the military college of the East India Company at Addiscombe, Lumsden was commissioned into the Bengal infantry on 10 December 1847. Between 1852 and 1856 he saw action on the north-west frontier of India, where he was mentioned in dispatches and received a campaign medal and clasp. In 1857, at the outbreak of the Indian mutiny (in which his younger brother William Henry Lumsden, a lieutenant in the 68th native infantry, was killed in action), he was part of a diplomatic mission to Afghanistan with his eldest brother, but returned to India in May 1858 to take part in the final operations against the mutineers, particularly the pursuit of Tantia Topi, under the command of Sir Hugh Rose. Again, he was mentioned in dispatches and decorated. In 1860 he was quartermaster-general to Sir Robert Napier's second division, which fought in China, and he distinguished himself at Sinho, Tangku (Tanggu), and the Taku (Dagu) forts, and took part in the advance on Peking (Beijing). He was promoted brevet-major in 1863, and awarded a campaign medal with two clasps. On 30 October 1862, at Rawalpindi, he married Mary Margaret (1832/3&#150;1922), daughter of John Marriott of Beechley, Lancashire.<br>
<br>In 1865 Lumsden took part in the brief campaign against Bhutan and was promoted lieutenant-colonel in August 1866. He then turned to staff work. He served as quartermaster-general in India between 1868 and 1873. He was made a full colonel in March 1870 and became aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria. In 1872 he was appointed resident to Hyderabad, and CB the following year. He was created CSI, served as adjutant-general of India (1874&#150;9), and became the chief of staff of India in September 1879, having been knighted in July. He was also extremely enterprising: when Sir Frederick Roberts led his column on Kandahar during the Second Afghan War (1878&#150;80) he was approached by a foul-smelling fakir, an &#145;extraordinary looking creature&#146;, who claimed to have obtained valuable intelligence on the Afghan forces. Roberts did not realize the fakir was Lumsden, who had been on his own personal reconnaissance in an elaborate disguise with &#145;decoration of peculiar sanctity &hellip; dirt, wig and all&#146;. He was also known for his great physical fitness: recovering from scarlet fever, he was alerted to the presence nearby of a man who was drowning. He asked the crowd if someone would volunteer to rescue the man since he himself was quite ill, but, when no one stepped forward, he plunged in, and, with extraordinary effort, pulled the man to safety.<br>
<br>Lumsden was promoted major-general in 1881, and in 1883 became a member of the Council of India, where he was thought of as someone with a &#145;sturdy independence&#146; of mind. In the 1880s the tsarist empire was advancing south through central Asia and closing rapidly on the border of Afghanistan. Britain had pledged itself to &#145;protect&#146; Afghanistan as part of its buffer zone in the defence of India. However, the ambiguity of the northern Afghan frontier line and the overlapping claims of the Afghans and the Russians caused the British government to accept a Russian offer that the borders of Russian Turkestan and Afghanistan should be settled on the spot by commissioners appointed by each power. In July 1884 Lumsden was selected to lead the British commission in preference to General Roberts, who was thought to be too much the champion of the &#145;forward policy&#146; in defence of India. It was not a modest organization, consisting of almost 2000 troops and logistical staff. Lumsden's remit was set out by Earl Granville, the foreign secretary, in a Foreign Office dispatch of 25 August 1884, which stated that the government &#145;in no way desire to control your action &hellip; [we] rely on your discretion and judgement&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 18 May 1885).<br>
<br>Lumsden set out from London in September 1884, and was joined in Herat in November by the portion of the British commission from India commanded by Sir West Ridgeway. Throughout the winter the Russians procrastinated about negotiations as they advanced their forces, and Lumsden was frustrated by the lack of progress. Communications with London were difficult, and he complained that he got precious little direction or information from the British government, other than Reuters reports to the Indian press. He believed the Afghans were Britain's allies, and the Russians were already in occupation of lands south of the frontier line agreed in 1873, and so he encouraged the Afghans to defend themselves at Panjdeh, while warning the Russians that any advance would be resisted. When it became obvious the Russians would attack, Lumsden withdrew the bulk of his commission, leaving just two British officers as observers with the Afghans, but he had already exceeded his brief of simply demarcating a border. The Russians overran the Afghan force at Pandjeh (30 March 1885), bringing Britain and Russia to the brink of war. Initially the British government backed the Afghans against Russian aggression, but privately Gladstone criticized Lumsden as a &#145;dunderhead&#146; who had &#145;wanted war&#146;  (Gladstone to Granville, 18 April 1885, Lumsden memorandum, 17 June 1885, FO). Parliamentary blue books of diplomatic correspondence concerning his mission were published in May 1885, when he was recalled to Britain. His meeting with the Liberal foreign secretary was frosty, though on his arrival in London (5 June 1885) he was greeted by enthusiastic crowds.<br>
<br>Gladstone's government fell days after Lumsden's return, and when the Conservatives came to power they appointed him GCB (3 July 1885) to signal their appreciation of an officer who had been left in an impossible position. Ridgeway having succeeded him in October 1885 as commissioner for the delimitation of the Afghan frontier, Lumsden remained at the India Office in London, and was promoted lieutenant-general in 1887 and general in 1890. He retired from the Council of India in 1893. As an authority on northern Afghanistan he addressed the Royal Geographical Society in 1885, and on the publication of the autobiography of the amir of Afghanistan, wrote at length to defend the record of the Afghan boundary commission  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 8 Dec 1900). In 1899 he published, with G. R. Elsmie, a biography of his late elder brother entitled <span class="italic">Lumsden of the Guides</span>.<br>
<br>In retirement Lumsden settled in Scotland, serving as a JP and deputy lieutenant for Aberdeen and Banff, and enjoying &#145;the pursuits of a country gentleman&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12 Nov 1918). He died at his home, Buchromb, Dufftown, Banffshire, on 9 November 1918. Physically brave and single-minded, Lumsden was a key figure in the Panjdeh incident. He was frustrated that he was denied the government's confidence, but, despite the criticisms of Gladstone and Granville, he managed to avoid embroiling British personnel in a dispute that could easily have led to war.<br>
