<span class="headword">Dearmer,  Percy</span>  (1867&#150;1936), <span class="occ">liturgist and historian of Christian worship</span>, was born in London on 27 February 1867, the younger son of Thomas Dearmer (<i>c</i>.1817&#150;1877), artist and drawing master, who died when Percy was ten years old, and his wife, Caroline Miriam Turner (<i>c</i>.1831&#150;1911), who was proprietor and head of Somerset House, a school for girls in Maida Vale. He was educated at Streatham School, at Westminster School (1880&#150;81), at a private school at Vevey, Switzerland, and at Christ Church, Oxford (1886&#150;9), where he read modern history.<br>
<br>At Christ Church Dearmer came under the influence of the historian F. York Powell and the future bishop of Oxford T. B. Strong. Powell converted him to socialism, Strong to tractarianism. Further Oxford friendships&#151;with James Adderley, Charles Gore, and others&#151;guided these enthusiasms into a coalescence which was Christian socialism. He threw himself into the work of first the Guild of St Matthew and then the Christian Social Union, of the London branch of which he was secretary from 1891 to 1912. But at heart he was an artist; his most creative work revealed this, and his permanent contribution both to the church and to national life is to be found in his profound understanding of the true relation between religion, particularly worship, and art. He saw art as not merely decoration but an essential and integral component of the worship offered to God by the church. No one did more in his time to raise the standards of art in public worship, and he is one of the few clergymen to have been awarded the distinction of the honorary ARIBA.<br>
<br>Dearmer was ordained deacon in 1891 and priest in 1892 at Rochester and after serving four curacies (which ranged from St Anne's, South Lambeth, to Berkeley Chapel, Mayfair), he was appointed in 1901 to the vicarage of St Mary's, Primrose Hill, where he remained until 1915, and there he was able to put his convictions into practice. Leading artists of all kinds gathered round him, including the designer and stained-glass artist Mark Travers, and St Mary's became known throughout the country through his publications and his establishment in 1912 of the Warham Guild for the design and supply of vestments and ornaments of the type recommended in <span class="italic">The Parson's Handbook</span> (1899, 12th edn 1931). This, his most important book, was an attempt to recall the church to the native English tradition (&#145;the English Use&#146;) in matters of liturgy and ceremonial rather than imitating Roman Catholic usages. His involvement in the Alcuin Club (founded 1897) was another means of advocating that distinctive style of church furnishing adopted in numerous Anglican churches in the first half of the twentieth century. He also made vigorous and imaginative efforts to improve the quality of church music, and was largely responsible for editing the <span class="italic">English Hymnal</span> (1906), <span class="italic">Songs of Praise</span> (1925), and the <span class="italic">Oxford Book of Carols</span> (1928) in which he involved Ralph Vaughan Williams, Martin Shaw, and Gustav Holst, which revolutionized congregational hymn singing.<br>
<br>During the First World War Dearmer was chaplain to the British Red Cross ambulance unit in Serbia where his wife, (Jessie) Mabel Pritchard (1872&#150;1915), daughter of Surgeon-Major William White and his wife, Selina, whom he had married on 26 May 1892, died of enteric fever in 1915. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55763/', "Mabel Dearmer")</script> was a noted novelist and playwright. On 19 August 1916 he married Nancy 
    (Nan; 1889&#150;1979)
  , only daughter of Arthur and Marian Knowles. With his first wife Dearmer had two sons: the younger, Christopher, died of wounds received at Gallipoli in 1915; his elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63185/', "Geoffrey Dearmer (1893&#150;1996)")</script>, lived to 103 and was one of the last First World War poets to survive. With his second wife, who survived him, he had one son, Antony, who was killed in action with the RAF in 1943, and two daughters. After the war Dearmer resided in Chelsea and busied himself in manifold activities, the Church of England not seeming able to harness his talents. He was the first professor of ecclesiastical art at King's College, London (1919&#150;36), and was lecturer in art there (1924&#150;32). In 1920 he became secretary of the recently founded League of Arts (he was chairman from 1921 to 1936), and, along with Miss Maude Royden, with whom he worked until 1924, he established the Guildhouse. To the relief of his many friends, to whom his lack of preferment had become a scandal, in 1931 he was nominated to a canonry at Westminster Abbey, where&#151;perhaps too late in life&#151;his gifts had full scope and opportunity. He made a distinctive contribution to the preaching and ceremonial in the abbey and developed remarkable powers as a broadcaster of services for children. Always striking in appearance and highly individual in speech and manner, Dearmer was an original, independent thinker, informed by a thorough scholarship in his own subjects, although in later life he risked this being dissipated by an over-great and sometimes ephemeral output. He died suddenly, of coronary thrombosis, at his residence at 4 Little Cloister, on 29 May 1936, and his ashes were interred in the Great Cloister, Westminster Abbey, on 3 June.<br>
