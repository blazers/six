<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dobree,  Peter Paul</span>  (1782&#150;1825), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born in Guernsey, the son of William Dobree of Guernsey. He was educated under Dr Richard Valpy at Reading School before matriculating in 1800 at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA as fourth senior optime in 1804. Elected a fellow of Trinity in 1806, he lived there for the rest of his life, graduating MA in 1807, and being ordained deacon in 1812 and priest in 1813. Charles Burney gave him an introduction in London in 1805 to Richard Porson; so began an acquaintance which, although it lasted only three years until Porson's death, led to Dobree's becoming perhaps his most illustrious and devoted pupil.<br>
<br>Dobree's first appearance as an author was in the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> (52, 1807, appendix) to which he contributed an important review of Bothe's <span class="italic">Aeschylus</span> in which he attacked its freedom of textual conjecture, while displaying the more conservative, informed, but penetratingly sharp style of criticism which he never abandoned. He contributed a few other reviews to the same journal, but these were less significant. On Porson's death in 1808 Dobree came forward as a candidate for the regius professorship of Greek at Cambridge, and was to have read his probationary lecture on Aristophanes; finding the electors unanimous, or nearly so, in favour of James Henry Monk, he withdrew from the contest. On Monk's resignation in 1823, Dobree was the only candidate, and was elected after a praelection on the funeral oration ascribed to Lysias (published in volume 1 of his <span class="italic">Adversaria</span>, 1831&#150;3, repr. 1874). His health gave way almost immediately afterwards, and he died, unmarried, in his rooms at Trinity on 24 September 1825. He was buried close to Porson in the chapel, where at his sister's provision a bust and tablet to his memory were erected. The inscription emphasizes his candid but equable temper, affability, and moral concern, before extolling his scholarship; it is printed in the preface to the <span class="italic">Adversaria</span>.<br>
<br>Though a man of varied acquirements, Dobree spent his life on classical, chiefly Greek, literature. He laid up vast stores for future years: besides a large body of notes on the Greek dramatists and Athenaeus, he left very extensive collections on the historians and orators, and probably meditated an edition of Demosthenes. He gave a great deal of attention to Greek inscriptions, writing over the years a number of papers signed usually &#145;O.&#146; (significance unknown) or &#145;Stelocopas&#146; (stonecutter); he appears to have been one of the first editors of inscriptions to have used sublinear dots to indicate letters imperfectly read (<span class="italic">Miscellaneous Notes on Inscriptions</span>, ed. J. Scholefield, 1835, 84). When the annotated portion of Porson's library was bought by Trinity College, he was selected, with two of his brother fellows, Monk and Charles James Blomfield, to edit the manuscripts. He was at first prevented by illness from taking a share in the work, and shortly after his recovery set out on a journey to Spain; thus the volume of Porson's <span class="italic">Adversaria</span> was edited by his two colleagues. But all of the papers on Aristophanes were entrusted to his care, and in 1820 he produced <span class="italic">Notae in Aristophanem</span>, with the <span class="italic">Plutus</span> prefixed, chiefly from Porson's autograph. In 1822 he edited the <span class="italic">Lexicon</span> of Photius from Porson's transcript of the <span class="roman">Gale MS</span> in Trinity College Library, which Porson had twice copied out, the first transcript having perished in the fire at the premises of Perry the bookseller; to this volume he added a fragment of a rhetorical lexicon edited from the margin of a Cambridge manuscript, and corrections and supplementary indexes to Porson's work. He had a share in the founding of his teacher Edward Valpy's <span class="italic">Classical Journal</span> in 1810, and occasionally wrote in it, chiefly on inscriptions. To Thomas Kidd's <span class="italic">Tracts and Criticisms of Porson</span> (1815) he added the brief <span class="italic">Auctarium</span>, and to Hugh James Rose's <span class="italic">Inscriptiones Graecae</span> (1825) the letter on the Greek marbles in Trinity College Library. With the exception of the notes on inscriptions, everything he published in his lifetime sprang from his reverence for Porson (not least his perpetuating of Porson's own suspicion that Peter Elmsley had purloined some of Porson's conjectures).<br>
<br>Dobree bequeathed 1000 volumes to the library of his college, but his books with manuscript notes to that of the university. From these his successor in the regius chair, James Scholefield, published his <span class="italic">Adversaria</span> and <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Notes on Inscriptions, with Addenda to the Adversaria</span> (1835), and he reissued the <span class="italic">Lexicon rhetoricum Cantabrigiense</span> (1834) which Dobree had appended to Porson's <span class="italic">Photius</span>. These amply justify Dobree's being classed in the first rank of English textual scholars. Julius Hare set Dobree on a par with his master, Porson, observing:<blockquote>his mind seems to have been of kindred character; [with] the same unweariable accuracy, the same promptness in coming to the point, the same aversion to all roundabout discussions, the same felicity in hitting on the very passage by which a question is to be settled &hellip; both [were] preserved by their wary good sense from ever committing a blunder; both &hellip; equally fearful of going beyond their warrant, equally distrustful of all theoretical speculations, equally convinced that in language usage is all in all. (Hare, 1.205&#150;6)</blockquote>Modern assessments agree in finding much of the master's &#145;spirit and something of the genius&#146;  (Brink, 112) in the pupil, but praise Dobree for his deliberate extension of the Porsonian method and tradition to Greek prose writers. A. E. Housman distinguishes between Porson's followers and characterizes Dobree as &#145;the shrewder emendator&#146; and Elmsley as &#145;the subtler grammarian&#146;  (Housman, <span class="italic">Classical Papers</span>, 1972, 1006).<br>
