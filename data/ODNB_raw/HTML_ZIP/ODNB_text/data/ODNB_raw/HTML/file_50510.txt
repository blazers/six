<span class="headword">Close,  William</span>  (1775?&#150;1813), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was reputedly born on 25 May 1775 at Field Broughton, Cartmel, Lancashire. His father, John Close, variously described as farmer and molecatcher, subsequently moved to the Isle of Walney, off the Furness coast, before settling by 1795 at Dalton in Furness. Until he was ten, Close attended the chapel school on the Isle of Walney, where the only book was <span class="italic">Lilly's Grammar</span>. He recalled supplementary study under an ash tree in the chapel yard, and apparently desired originally to be a sailor. But in 1790 he was apprenticed to Mr Parkinson, a surgeon at Burton in Kendal. In 1796&#150;7 Close attended lectures at the Royal Infirmary and the university in Edinburgh. Shortly afterwards, having apparently obtained a diploma, he joined Thomas Brockbank in medical practice at Dalton in Furness. On 30 October 1803 he married Isabel, daughter of Robert Charnock, a blacksmith, and his wife, Isabella; a son was born in 1805, and a daughter in 1806.<br>
<br>For sixteen years Close devoted himself to professional duties while also studying music, drawing, natural philosophy, and the history of the Furness area. He showed awareness of medical advances: in 1799 he experimented with vaccination against smallpox; children in the village of Rampside were inoculated at his own expense and with supposed success. In 1805 he produced a new edition of Thomas West's <span class="italic">Antiquities of Furness</span>, with a supplement of eighty-six pages. Among other topics, he added local detail on Dalton, a biography of George Romney, the portrait painter (born in Dalton in Furness), engravings, and lists of plants. Between 1805 and 1813 he prepared a topographical work, <span class="italic">An Itinerary of Furness and the Environs</span>. The historian T. A. Beck later tried arranging Close's unfinished notes into a continuous narrative, and the subsequent manuscript survives at Manchester Central Library. The work contains descriptions of country seats, picturesque scenery, and other local sights, supplemented by transcripts of documents and epitaphs and observations on recovering land from Walney Channel.<br>
<br>Between 1800 and 1805 Close contributed to William Nicholson's <span class="italic">Journal of Natural Philosophy</span>. From youth, he had also performed music, which he initially taught to Dalton children. By 1798 he was contemplating improvements to wind instruments. In 1809 he sent proposals to the Society of Arts for improving the range of trumpets by using tubular appendages. His techniques were also adaptable to the french horn and the bugle. After commissioning trials, a committee recommended Close for the society's gold medal, but he was offered only a silver medal. Close declined the award (the society's minutes suggested controversy) and he was also asked to relinquish patent rights. During 1812 he published a treatise and on 14 April was granted a patent for improvements to &#145;polyphonian trumpets&#146;. He subsequently sold the rights to Thomas Percival, a London dealer. Close died from consumption at Dalton in Furness on 27 June 1813; he was buried at Walney chapel on the 29th.<br>
<br>One writer described Close as &#145;a little slender man, very clever but rather changeable and fond of riding on horseback&#146;  (Gaythorpe). His medical colleague William Harrison mentioned his &#145;natural irritability&#146;, while estimates of his medical and academic work have varied. Although some of his interests seemed eccentric, later scholars utilized and generally admired his writings. However, the contemporary diarist William Fleming of Pennington (possibly because of academic rivalry) was often contemptuous of his personality, appearance, music playing, and editorial ability. Certainly his musical innovations were quickly superseded by later advancements. But during his lifetime Close was probably the most active personality in the intellectual life of the Furness area.<br>
