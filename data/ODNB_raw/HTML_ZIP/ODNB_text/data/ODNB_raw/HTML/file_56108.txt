<span class="headword">Gordon,  Mary Louisa</span>  (1861&#150;1941), <span class="occ">physician and prison inspector</span>, was born on 15 August 1861 at Seaforth in Lancashire, the daughter of James Gordon and his wife, Mary Emily Carter. The Gordons had lived for generations in the Scottish borderlands. The circumstances of her upbringing and education remain obscure, but in her early twenties she trained at the London School of Medicine for Women. On 11 November 1890 she registered as a medical practitioner, having achieved licentiate status with the Royal College of Physicians in Edinburgh, the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh, and the Faculty of Physical Surgery, Glasgow; she also achieved licentiate status in midwifery. She had to overcome sustained resistance to her project of a medical career among family and friends, who accused her of having a morbid interest in disease and believed that a medical career was a degrading and risky undertaking for a woman. One of Mary Gordon's most marked traits was that she acted on her convictions, often in the face of resistance.<br>
<br>From 1890 to 1908 Mary Gordon practised medicine in London. She was appointed the first ever woman inspector of prisons in March 1908 and took up a post on the English and Welsh Prison Commission chaired by Sir Evelyn Ruggles-Brise. The appointment was made in line with one of the recommendations of the 1895 Gladstone committee on prisons, which was not acted upon until Herbert Gladstone himself became Liberal home secretary in 1905. Again her friends opposed this move, arguing that such an essentially bureaucratic and administrative post was unsuitable for a doctor. Mary Gordon was responsible for inspecting the female wings of about forty local prisons where women were held, and the convict prison, State Inebriate Asylum, and borstal for women, all at Aylesbury. Initially she was viewed with suspicion and anxiety in the Prison Commission, where she was frequently described as &#145;a new departure&#146;; as she was not allocated an office, she had to work from her Harley Street clinic. Her job was to report annually to the commission on the maintenance of standards and regulations in all women's prison facilities in England and Wales, and to advise the Prison Commission generally on matters regarding the imprisonment of women and treatment of their inebriacy in the certified inebriate asylums for women. There was no training for this work, and Mary Gordon attached herself to a London prison for three days to discover how the system worked; she also visited women's prisons in France, the Netherlands, and Belgium.<br>
<br>By 1908 the prisons were at the heart of the struggle for women's suffrage, for since late 1905 suffragettes had been committed to prison for offences in connection with the suffrage issue. Mary Gordon deeply sympathized with this cause: until mid-1914 she clandestinely corresponded with a leading suffragette, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence (1867&#150;1954), and with the Women's Social and Political Union about conditions in the prisons and about leaders (such as Emmeline Pankhurst) who were periodically in prison. At that time the police raided the headquarters of the Women's Social and Political Union and stumbled upon this correspondence. The Home Office demanded that she publicly dissociate herself from the organization, which Mary Gordon refused to do, arguing that her support for women's suffrage was not unlawful and that she had never supported violence. The outbreak of the First World War led to suspension of the movement and the matter rested. However, she was never forgiven by the Home Office and Prison Commission mandarins. In 1916 she took temporary leave of absence to do war work with the Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service, serving in Macedonia in the Serbian transport column; one of her superiors caustically remarked, &#145;she will not be missed&#146;. As late as 1919 her appointment ten years before was described as &#145;a sop to feminism&#146;. She retired in 1921.<br>
<br>Mary Gordon's ideas about women offenders and imprisonment resonated closely with the new liberalism and dynamic psychology which had become symbols of reform and progress among many of her era. She argued that the retributive and punitive prison system characteristic of the nineteenth century was inherently flawed because most female prisoners were not susceptible to force or severity. In fact, she insisted, prisons in the admittedly less draconian era of the early twentieth century functioned like warehouses, storing a complex society with its own rules and roles, in which each prisoner was guaranteed a secure place and in which the criminal merely hibernated until release allowed resumption of crime. In these universities of crime women were brutalized and alienated rather than rehabilitated. Mary Gordon emphasized the necessity of scientific understanding of women offenders in order to apply reformatory measures to them: this faith in knowledge as a key to human progress pervaded all her thinking. Female criminality was to her the result of a very poor emotional environment in the home of the small child, physical and moral deprivation, stunted or distorted psychological development in childhood and adolescence, defective education, and exploitation by accomplished older criminals. To this environmentalist analysis Mary Gordon added a constitutional element also common in social scientific writings of the time: she claimed that many women offenders were suffering from inherited constitutional defects or mental defectiveness, and therefore easily fell victim to criminality. However, she most eloquently emphasized emotion and relationship as being at the core of the causes of crime and hence its cure, and paid close attention to contemporary clinical insistence on the centrality of such phenomena as repression, the unconscious, suppression, hysteria, regression, instinct, and fantasy in the production of female crime. Mary Gordon was deeply versed in the psychological theory of the time, which she quoted widely in her writing.<br>
<br>Another consistent theme in Mary Gordon's thinking was that social institutions were part of an oppressive criminogenic chain beginning with very poor nurture and family relationships. The police and law, for instance, combined to brand young women as &#145;common prostitutes&#146; for life; prisons suppressed emotion and individuality, increasing self-denigration. Gordon advocated optimistic and energetic systems of training; her vision was of women offender institutions designed as communities with high degrees of freedom of expression, creativity, enthusiasm, and hope, in which the individual prisoner imbibed these qualities from the collective ethos of staff and inmates. However, daunted on occasion by the sheer mass of female prisoners and fearful that the children of today's criminals would be the prisoners of tomorrow, Mary Gordon supported a substantial programme of mental, familial, and social hygiene. There is a contrast between her optimism and sudden expression of deep pessimism in her writing, but these two aspects of her philosophy were integrated in her insistence on the need for medical, psychological, and social scientific analysis, leading to the development of an individual programme of reformatory treatment for each woman prisoner: Mary Gordon wished the whole woman to be understood in the context of her physical condition, mentality, intellect, and morality.<br>
<br>Mary Gordon's concern with feeling and experience was revealed in her other writing, most notably <span class="italic">The Chase of the Wild Goose</span>, published by Leonard and Virginia Woolf in 1936. This is an account, based on their journals, of two female lovers who fled persecution by their families in the late eighteenth century to set up home in the Vale of Llangollen, where they lived for fifty years. Mary Gordon dramatically excavated their intense yearning for one another and the protracted struggles they underwent to protect their relationship. Indeed, she believed that the experience of women at the hands of men was generally painful because men lacked the emotional and empathetic imagination of women. Her other publications were a novel, <span class="italic">A Jury of the Virtuous</span> (1907), and her work on women prisoners, <span class="italic">Penal Discipline</span> (1922).<br>
<br>Mary Gordon never married and had no children: she remarked near the end of her life that this solitariness had been part of the price of freedom in a world which stifled human spirit. She spent her last years at Hawk Wood, Crowborough, Sussex, where she died on 5 May 1941. Historically significant as a pioneer of women officials at the top echelons of the prison system, she experienced great isolation and distrust even before the suffragette issue and yet remained convinced that knowledge and dedication would lead ultimately to freedom of the whole human spirit.<br>
