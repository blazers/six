<span class="headword">M'Diarmid,  John</span>  (1790&#150;1852), <span class="occ">newspaper editor</span>, born at Glasgow, was the son of Hugh M'Diarmid, minister of the Gaelic church in Glasgow. After some education, mainly in Edinburgh, he became, at an early age, owing to his father's death, a clerk in an Edinburgh counting-house, whence he passed into the head office of the Commercial Bank, Edinburgh, remaining there until 1817. He devoted his leisure to study, attending several classes in the university, and for two years spent his evenings as amanuensis to Professor John Playfair, who gave him access to his classes and his library. He was a distinguished member of a college debating society, and of the Edinburgh Forum, a club that helped to train many good speakers, and he wrote some clever verses. He formed friendships with Sir Walter Scott and his circle. In 1819 he married Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McKnight (<i>d</i>. 1850), of Dumfries.<br>
<br>On 25 January 1817 M'Diarmid joined Charles Maclaren and William Ritchie in preparing the first number of <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> newspaper, and in the same month he moved to Dumfries to become editor of the <span class="italic">Dumfries and Galloway Courier</span>, which he edited until his death. M'Diarmid became an authority on Dumfriesshire, especially its agriculture, and wrote many attractive descriptions of his journeys about the county. In 1820 he declined the editorship of the <span class="italic">Caledonian Mercury</span> in Edinburgh, receiving at the same time an interest in the property of the <span class="italic">Courier</span>, of which he became owner in 1837. His paper followed the liberal political line common in lowland Scotland at that time. His son, William Ritchie M'Diarmid, became a partner in the paper in 1843.<br>
<br>When, in September 1832, Dumfries suffered heavily from cholera, M'Diarmid's appeal for a relief fund brought in &pound;2900, which he skilfully distributed. He was the trusted adviser of Robert Burns's widow, Jean, until her death in 1834, when he was her executor. M'Diarmid published editions, with memoirs, of William Cowper (1817) and Oliver Goldsmith (1823). In 1820 the first volume of his <span class="italic">Scrap Book</span>, consisting of selections and original contributions, appeared. A second series speedily followed, and both were frequently reprinted. In 1825 he started the <span class="italic">Dumfries Magazine</span>, which ran for three years. In 1830 he reprinted <span class="italic">Sketches from Nature</span> from the <span class="italic">Courier</span>, and in 1832 he contributed to an <span class="italic">Illustrated Picture of Dumfries</span>, an account of the town and district. He also wrote a description of Moffat and a life of William Nicholson (1782&#150;1849), the Galloway poet.<br>
<br>M'Diarmid died of erysipelas at Dumfries on 18 November 1852, and was buried next to his wife in Dumfries cemetery.<br>
