<span class="headword">Ashurst,  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1679), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was admitted as a sizar to Queens' College, Cambridge, on 23 August 1623; he graduated BA in 1628 and proceeded MA in 1631. In 1632 he was instituted to the vicarage of Arlesey, Bedfordshire. On 20 November 1660 he was married at Arlesey to Mary, widow of Daniel Baldocke. Ashurst must not be confused with the man of the same name who became dean of divinity at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1658. Both men lost their positions after the Restoration; in the case of Ashurst of Arlesey, his removal was voluntary. He had been episcopally ordained, but could not comply with the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> of 1662, and so resigned his living, continuing, however, to sign the bishop's transcripts of the parish register until 1664. A successor was instituted in 1667, but in 1672 Ashurst regained the cure and held it until his death.<br>
<br>Ashurst probably owed this to a powerful neighbour, Sir Samuel Browne, justice of common pleas, his &#145;great friend and patron&#146;:<blockquote>the whole parish was well affected towards him for his worthy behaviour amongst them, and was entirely under the influence of the judge &hellip; and so, though he was legally silenced, he continued in his church a nonconformist. He read part of the morning and evening service, viz, the confession, scripture-hymns, the creed, and some of the collects &hellip; His contempt of the world and contentedness on a very small income were very remarkable. He took for his small tithes just what his parishioners were pleased to give him. (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.93)</blockquote>Ashurst died in 1679 and was &#145;buried in woolen&#146; at Arlesey on 16 December  (<span class="italic">Nonconformist's Memorial</span>, 1.281). His neighbour, Richard Read, of nearby Henlow, preached the funeral sermon.<br>
