<span class="headword">Dodd <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Barnes]</span>,  Anne</span>  (<em>c.</em>1685&#150;1739), <span class="occ">pamphlet shop keeper</span>, was born Anne Barnes, but nothing is known of her before her marriage, on 18 March 1708, to the stationer Nathaniel Dodd, the licence allegation describing her merely as a spinster of St Bride's parish, London, aged upwards of twenty-two years. The couple were married in St Bride's and apparently lived in the parish for the next four years, two of their children being baptized there.<br>
<br>In February 1708, just before his marriage, Nathaniel Dodd had purchased the freedom of the Stationers' Company, but what trade he or his wife carried on during these early years is not known. Some time in late 1711 or early 1712, however, the Dodds moved to the sign of the Peacock without Temple Bar in St Clement Danes parish where they established what quickly became, and for forty years remained, the best-known pamphlet shop in London.<br>
<br>By law any wife's business was then legally her husband's, and this makes it difficult to determine whose business the shop really was. Nathaniel Dodd, testifying in 1718 after one of the many arrests which such a business involved, speaks of himself taking the offending newspaper, Mist's <span class="italic">Weekly Journal</span>, from the printer and supplying copies to a subsidiary distributor, while others later describe being his servant, or taking receipts from him. However, the shop itself is generally referred to as kept by Mrs Dodd, and even the witness who claimed to serve Mr Dodd testified that it was Dodd's wife who was the &#145;retailler of newspapers and pamphlets commonly called a Mercury&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 35/28/18, 12 Aug 1721).<br>
<br>Whatever her husband's role, it was always Anne Dodd's name which appeared on the imprints of the hundreds of newspapers and pamphlets advertised as for sale at the Peacock. And even if for the first decade Anne Dodd was merely the nominal proprietor, all that changed with Nathaniel's early death in October 1723. Thereafter Anne had sole charge of the business, and the fact that it continued to prosper for three more decades strongly suggests that she had always been perfectly capable of running things on her own.<br>
<br>Anne Dodd's success and renown should not, however, be confused with real importance in the publishing world, for she owned no copyrights and merely distributed those papers on which her name appeared, buying them in bulk from the actual publishers and supplying them wholesale to the hawkers or retail to the public. Pope's use of her imprint on the early editions of <span class="italic">The Dunciad</span> (almost certainly without her consent) was thus mere parodic obfuscation.<br>
<br>This subsidiary role did not, however, save Mrs Dodd from government harassment or even, in 1728, from imprisonment, though she pleaded in 1731 that:<blockquote>the business sometimes compels me to sell Papers that give Offense, but I must beg leave to Declare Sincerely that what Papers I sell in just Praise of our Happy Government, far exceed the other in Number. Hard Case! that I must either offend where I am shure I would not, or else starve my Poor Babes. (TNA: PRO, SP 36/23/134, 26 May 1731)</blockquote>This was pure hyperbole for the youngest of Dodd's surviving &#145;Babes&#146; was then at least seven and the eldest twenty-two. Nor were they near to starving, for when Anne Dodd died she left &pound;500 to the children of her eldest daughter, Elizabeth, wife of the London surgeon Mileson Hingeston, and &pound;600 each, besides jewellery and personal effects, to her two younger daughters, Anne and Sarah, who were also left the lease of the shop. They were strongly encouraged to carry on the business which continued, apparently unchanged, until the mid-1750s. Fielding's description in the <span class="italic">Covent Garden Journal</span> of 21 January 1752 of &#145;Mrs. Dodd's shop&#146; with &#145;all that vast and formidable Host of Papers and Pamphlets arranged on her Shelves&#146; might have portrayed any moment over the previous forty years, though Fielding's &#145;Mrs. Dodd&#146; was the younger Anne Dodd (<i>fl</i>. 1739&#150;1756), in whose name the business was carried on, and who is thus often confused with her more famous mother. The older Anne Dodd died in April 1739 and was buried on the 22nd at Enfield in Middlesex.<br>
