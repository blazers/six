<span class="headword">Tracy,  William  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1174), <span class="occ">one of the murderers of Thomas Becket</span>, was probably the son of Turgis de Tracy, a member of a Norman family with strong connections with Maine, where another Turgis, probably William's grandfather, had been William the Conqueror's seneschal in the 1070s. The family seems to have taken its name from the hamlet of Tracy, near Vire in Normandy. William de Tracy was married and although the identity of his wife is uncertain she was probably English rather than a Norman heiress. He had a son named Henry, known as &#145;the Hunchback&#146;.<br>
<br>William de Tracy was a man of considerable property. Lord of at least part of the Devon manor of Bradninch, the <span class="roman">Domesday</span> fief of William Capra, which had almost certainly come to the Tracy family during Stephen's reign, he also held Moreton Hampstead, west of Exeter, where the dedication of the parish church was later changed to &#145;St Thomas Becket&#146;. Moreover he had significant estates in Normandy, where in 1172 he held one fee to himself and the service of a further five in the lordship of Passais. The extent of his holdings is indicated by the knight service he owed. In 1165 he answered for scutage on thirty knights. In his return to the Inquest of Knight Service in 1166 he responded as holding 25&frac34; knights' fees of the old enfeoffment and 2&frac12; in demesne, and later scutages were charged on 25&#150;6 knights' fees.<br>
<br>Although, therefore, Tracy was a man of considerable substance, there is no sign of his having taken an active role in royal service, beyond being described as a courtier and chamber knight. He acted as a witness to at least six royal charters, including Henry II's confirmation of 1155 to St Martin of Troarn, made at Worcester, when the other witnesses, mostly of the highest rank, included the present and future archbishops of Canterbury, Theobald and Thomas Becket. Tracy also made charitable grants on his own account. One such can be assigned to the period before the murder of Becket, by the wording of the charter itself, which refers to a grant of all the churches on his land to Alan de Tracy, clerk, by William de Tracy &#145;before his crime against St. Thomas&#146;. Another benefaction which probably, though not certainly, antedates the murder is the founding of a leper hospital at Couesmes-en-Froulay near Ambri&egrave;res in Maine. An entry in the cartulary of St &Eacute;tienne de Plessis-Grimoult, executed by Guillaume, bishop of Le Mans (1154&#150;87), records this endowment, and the building of the leper hostel by Tracy. However, the project was evidently of short duration, since by 1187 at the latest the house had been empty for some time, and its revenues had been assigned by Henry II to Alan the Clerk, William de Tracy's brother, who in turn requested that they should be given to the church at Yvrandes, where there was a hermitage linked with Plessis-Grimoult.<br>
<br>There are slight indications, however, that Tracy had earned and enjoyed royal favour in the years before 1170. He is described as having often performed bravely in military action, and presumably this ability was displayed on the king's behalf. On two occasions, in 1165 and 1168, he received pardons by royal writ for payments for scutage and for the aid for marrying the king's daughter amounting to &pound;37 10<i>s</i>., the full amount of his debts.<br>
<br>Tracy was certainly at Henry II's court at Bur-le-Roi, near Bayeux, at Christmas 1170, where Becket's conduct, and above all his excommunication of the bishops who had crowned Henry, the Young King, earlier that year, was angrily discussed. The king's famous outburst, &#145;What miserable drones and traitors have I nourished and promoted in my household, who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born clerk&#146;  (Robertson and Sheppard, 2.429), which later oral tradition renders simply, &#145;Who will rid me of this turbulent priest?&#146;  (Lyttelton, pt 4, 353), prompted the departure of Tracy with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9647/', "Reginald Fitzurse")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19379/', "Hugh de Morville")</script>, and Richard Brito on their ill-conceived journey to Canterbury. Fitzurse (in whose article the confrontation with Becket is described more fully) took the lead in the initial interview with the archbishop on 29 December, in which Tracy uttered not a word. Unlike the other three knights Tracy did not put on armour before the frenzied pursuit of Becket into the cathedral, but throughout the murder wore a green cloak and a particoloured tunic. So, as he was less encumbered than the others, they tried at one point to hoist Becket onto his back, to carry him out of the cathedral itself, and in the tussle which followed, the archbishop nearly felled him. It has been claimed that both he and Reginald Fitzurse struck the first blow, and nearly cut off the arm of Becket's attendant, Edward Grim&#151;Tracy certainly claimed responsibility for this, in conversation the evening after the murder at Saltwood Castle, though he believed that the wounded man was John of Salisbury. Tracy and the other murderers left the cathedral immediately after completing their pillage of the archiepiscopal palace, and retired that night to Saltwood Castle, Kent. They eventually took refuge at the royal castle of Knaresborough, Yorkshire, then in the custody of Morville.<br>
<br>Tracy seems to have been the first to come to his senses: in a confession to Bartholomew, bishop of Exeter, apparently made in Devon shortly after the murder, he said that his heart sank and he feared that the earth might open up and swallow him. Mythical stories about the fate of all four of the knights involved in Becket's murder appeared rapidly, but especially in the case of Tracy. The most famous of these is that Tracy, on his way to the Holy Land to do penance for the murder, was turned back by adverse winds. Another local legend had it that he spent many years in a hermitage on the Devon coast, expiating his offence. However, an extremely, and apparently deliberately, cryptic letter from Becket's former chaplain, Herbert of Bosham, makes it clear that he had made his way to the papal curia by the latter months of 1171, &#145;at the time when King Henry went into Ireland&#146;  (Robertson and Sheppard, 7.511&#150;12). According to Herbert, Tracy had obtained secret information about the legates Albert and Theodwin, so secret that it should have been known only to the king of England. It is not clear what use Herbert expected Tracy to make of this, but in any case, according to the author of the life of Becket in the Lansdowne manuscript, he was ordered by the pope to continue his journey to the Holy Land. The last certainly established action of his life took place at Cosenza in southern Italy, presumably on his way there, where he executed a charter conferring on the monks of Christ Church, Canterbury, the sum of 100<i>s</i>. a year, to support a monk praying day and night for the living and the dead, from his manor of Daccombe in Devon. This charter was witnessed by the abbot of St Euphemia, where, according to Herbert of Bosham, Tracy lay dying. Herbert gives horrific details of Tracy's death, and although there is an alternative tradition that he did reach the Holy Land, his account of events is to be preferred. The charter making the grant of Daccombe was confirmed by Henry II between July and October 1174, and this confirmation therefore constitutes an extreme <i>terminus ante quem</i> for Tracy's death.<br>
<br>Although William de Tracy left a legitimate heir in Henry the Hunchback, the latter did not immediately succeed to his father's lands. Indeed William's tenants later claimed that their lord's Devon lands had escheated to the crown after Becket's death. Certainly when they were restored to the Tracy family, after the accession of Richard I in 1189, the recipient was not Henry but William's nephew, Hugh de Couterne. Ten years later Henry did regain them briefly, through some chicanery on King John's part, but they were then returned to Hugh. Despite the claims of some historians to the contrary, it would appear that his part in the archbishop's murder did cause William de Tracy a significant loss of royal favour.<br>
