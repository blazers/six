</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Reid, Sir  Thomas Wemyss</span>  (1842&#150;1905), <span class="occ">journalist and biographer</span>, born in Elswick Row, Newcastle upon Tyne, on 29 March 1842, was the second son of Alexander Reid, Congregational minister of that town from 1830 to 1880, and his second wife, Jessy Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Wemyss (<i>d</i>. 1845) of Darlington, a Hebrew scholar and biblical critic of distinction. After a short stay at Madras College, St Andrews, where he had brain fever, Reid was educated at Percy Street Academy, Newcastle, by John Collingwood Bruce. In 1856 he became a clerk in the Wentworth Beaumont Lead office at Newcastle. He early determined on journalism, at fifteen sending reports on local topics to the <span class="italic">Northern Daily Express</span>. These attracted the notice of the proprietor, who had him taught shorthand. Reid did occasional reporting work at seventeen; and a local cartoon entitled &#145;The Press of Newcastle&#146; showed him at the time as a boy in a short jacket perched on a stool taking down a speech. Another youthful exploit was the foundation near his father's chapel of the West End Literary Institute, which included a penny bank.<br>
<br>In July 1861 Reid gave up his clerkship for a journalistic career, becoming chief reporter on the <span class="italic">Newcastle Journal</span>. His brilliant descriptive report of the Hartley colliery accident in January 1862 was issued as a pamphlet, and raised &pound;40 for the relief of the victims' families. In 1863 Reid varied reporting with leader writing and dramatic criticism; in June 1864 he was appointed editor of the bi-weekly <span class="italic">Preston Guardian</span>, the leading journal in north Lancashire; and in January 1866 he moved to Leeds to become head of the reporting staff of the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span>, a daily paper founded and for more than a century owned by the Baines family. He maintained a connection with it for the rest of his life. On 5 September 1867 Reid married his cousin Kate, daughter of the Revd John Thornton of Stockport, a dissenting minister; she died on 4 February 1870, having borne one son. He then married, on 26 March 1873, Louisa, daughter of Benjamin Berry, merchant, of Headingley, Leeds, who bore him a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>From the autumn of 1867 until the spring of 1870 Reid was London representative of the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span>. In order to gain admission to the press gallery of the House of Commons he had to become an occasional reporter for the London <span class="italic">Morning Star</span>, then edited by Justin McCarthy. He subsequently took a leading part in the movement that resulted in 1881 in the opening of the gallery to the provincial press. An acquaintance with William Edward Baxter, secretary to the Admiralty, placed at his disposal important political information which gave high interest to his articles. Reid at this time was on intimate terms with Sala, James Macdonell, W. H. Mudford, and other leading journalists. He sent descriptive articles to <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal</span> and formed a lifelong friendship with the editor, James Payn. To the <span class="italic">St James's Magazine</span>, edited by Mrs Riddell, he sent sketches of statesmen, which were republished as <span class="italic">Cabinet Portraits</span>, his first book, in 1872.<br>
<br>On 15 May 1870 Reid returned to Leeds, to act as editor of the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span>. The paper rapidly developed under his alert control; in 1873 he opened a London office, sharing it with the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>, and arranged with the <span class="italic">Standard</span> for the supply of foreign intelligence.<br>
<br>Reid was a moderate Liberal. A &#145;writing editor&#146; with an extremely able pen, he was the first to establish a provincial paper as a real rival to the London press, in the quality of its news and comment, and in its access to behind-the-scenes information. His early knowledge of Gladstone's unexpected decision to dissolve parliament in 1874 was the first of many scoops. Reid upheld W. E. Forster's <span class="roman">Education Bill</span> against the radicals, and supported, against the teetotallers, Bruce's moderate <span class="roman">Licensing Bill</span>. In the 1880 election it was at his suggestion that Gladstone was invited to contest Leeds as well as Midlothian. Reid's relations with Forster were always close, and he vigorously championed his political action in Ireland during 1880&#150;82. The <span class="italic">Mercury</span> under his editorship continued to support Gladstone when he took up the cause of home rule. While at Leeds, Reid was also on friendly terms with Richard Monckton Milnes, Lord Houghton, at whose house at Fryston he was a frequent guest.<br>
<br>Reid made many journeys abroad, chiefly in his journalistic capacity. In 1877 he visited Paris with letters of introduction from Lord Houghton to the comte de Paris and M. De Blowitz, and was introduced to Gambetta. A holiday trip in Germany, Hungary, and Romania in 1878 he described in the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>. He went to Tunis as special correspondent of the <span class="italic">Standard</span> in 1881, and narrated his experiences in <span class="italic">The Land of the Bey</span> (1882).<br>
<br>Reid's close association with the Gladstone family led to his most dramatic <i>coup</i>, for it was his letter and subsequent encouragement that led in December 1885 to H. J. Gladstone's flying of the &#145;Hawarden kite&#146;, the announcement of his father's &#145;conversion&#146; to Irish home rule  (see Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 11, appx I). In 1887 Reid withdrew from the editorship of the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span>, to which he continued a weekly contribution until his death, in order to become manager of the publishing firm of Cassell &amp; Co. London was thenceforth his permanent home, and his work there was incessant. In January 1890 he added to his publishing labours the editorship of the <span class="italic">Speaker</span>, a new weekly paper which he founded and which combined literature with Liberal politics, and was a central forum for the discussion of the future of post-Gladstonian Liberalism. Reid became a strong supporter and a personal friend of Lord Rosebery, whose views he mainly sought to expound in the <span class="italic">Speaker</span>. He was knighted&#151;one of the first journalistic knighthoods&#151;on Rosebery's recommendation in 1894 in consideration of &#145;services to letters and politics&#146;.<br>
<br>In September 1899 Reid ceased to be editor of the <span class="italic">Speaker</span>, which in spite of its literary merits was financially only a qualified success. Subsequently he wrote a shrewd and well-informed survey of political affairs month by month for the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>, as well as weekly contributions to the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span>. He was elected president of the Institute of Journalists for 1898&#150;9. He had become in 1878 a member of the Reform Club on the proposition of Forster and Hugh Childers, and he soon took a prominent part in its management, long acting as chairman of committee. He was elected an honorary member of the Eighty Club in 1892, at the instance of his friend Lord Russell of Killowen.<br>
<br>Reid also made a reputation in literature (he received the degree of LLD from St Andrews University in 1893). During his first residence at Leeds he had visited Haworth and interested himself in the lives of the Bront&euml;s. Ellen Nussey, Charlotte Bront&euml;'s intimate friend and schoolfellow, entrusted to him the novelist's correspondence with herself, and other material which had not been accessible to Mrs Gaskell. With such aid Reid wrote some articles in <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>, which he expanded into his <span class="italic">Charlotte Bront&euml;: a Monograph</span> (1877). Reid was also, with John Morley, an important biographical historian of Victorian Liberalism. In his lives of W. E. Forster (2 vols., 1888), and Richard Monckton Milnes, first Lord Houghton (2 vols., 1890), he printed much valuable correspondence, and Gladstone helped him by reading the proofs. As Forster's papers subsequently disappeared, Reid's biography has proved of especial importance. He also published memoirs of Lyon Playfair, first Lord Playfair of St Andrews (1899); John Deakin Heaton MD of Leeds (1883); and a vivid monograph on his close friend William Black the novelist (1902). A <span class="italic">Life of W. E. Gladstone</span>, which he edited in 1899, includes much still-valuable material, and is excellently illustrated. He further enjoyed success as a novelist, <span class="italic">Gladys Fane: a Story of Two Lives</span> (1884; 8th edn, 1902), and <span class="italic">Mauleverer's Millions: a Yorkshire Romance</span> (1886), each selling well. He also left <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, which included much confidential matter of a political kind; portions were edited by his brother, Dr Stuart Reid, in 1905.<br>
<br>A diabetic for his last eighteen months, Reid died of pleurisy, active to the last and almost pen in hand, at his house, 26 Bramham Gardens, South Kensington, London, on 26 February 1905, and was buried in Brompton cemetery; his second wife, Louisa, survived him.<br>
