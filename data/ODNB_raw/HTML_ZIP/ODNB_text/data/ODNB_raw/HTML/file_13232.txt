<span class="headword">Higgins,  Godfrey</span>  (1773&#150;1833), <span class="occ">historian of religion</span>, only son of Godfrey Higgins of Skellow Grange, near Doncaster, and his wife, Christiana (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Matterson), was born on (or shortly before) 1 May 1773. He entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1790, moving to Trinity Hall in 1791, but did not take a degree. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1818, but was not called to the bar. On his father's death in 1794 he succeeded to a considerable estate. In 1800 he married Jane, heir of Richard Thorpe. They had three children: a son, Godfrey, a daughter, Jane, who married Lieutenant-General Matthew Sharpe of Hoddom Castle, near Dumfries, and another daughter, Charlotte, who died, unmarried, before Higgins. His London house was 20 Keppel Street, Russell Square. In 1802, during the scare of an anticipated invasion by Napoleon, Higgins became a major in the 3rd West York militia, and while in this service he was seized with a bad fever at Harwich, from the effects of which he never recovered.<br>
<br>After resigning his commission in 1813, Higgins devoted himself entirely to an unbiased investigation into the history of religious beliefs. He acquired a knowledge of Hebrew, and sometimes pursued his studies in foreign libraries. At the date of his death he had projected a journey to Egypt and the Near East in search of further clues to religious problems. Higgins's principal publications were in the field of comparative religion. His <span class="italic">Horae sabbaticae</span> (1826), which received notice and criticism, contains an autobiography in the 1851 edition. In 1829 he published a work on Muhammad, and <span class="italic">The Celtic Druids</span>, which was the more critically successful of the two. His last work was <span class="italic">Anacalypsis: an attempt to draw aside the veil of the Saitic Isis, or, An inquiry into the origin of languages, nations, and religions</span>, which was printed in June 1833 but was not published until 1836. The second volume was edited by George Smallfield at the expense of Higgins's son after his father's death. Higgins claimed to be a Christian, regarding Jesus as a Nazarite, of the monastic order of Pythagorean Essenes, probably a Samaritan by birth, and leading the life of a hermit.<br>
<br>Higgins acted with energy as a justice of the peace, and was keenly interested in practical questions of political economy. He took part in measures for the better treatment of the insane, and provided for the erection of a house for pauper lunatics near Wakefield. He favoured the abolition of the corn laws in conjunction with the &#145;fund law&#146; and game laws. He supported calls for the reform of the House of Commons and advocated the abolition of the protestant church in Ireland. His interest in social and political issues was manifested in several publications including <span class="italic">A Letter to Earl Fitzwilliam on the Abuses of the York Lunatic Asylum</span> (1814); <span class="italic">The Evidence of Godfrey Higgins and C. Best Taken before a Committee of the House of Commons respecting the Asylum at York</span> (1816); and letters and observations on the passing of the <span class="roman">Metallic Currency Bill</span> (1819), and on the corn laws and fund laws (1826). In 1831 several of the radical political unions of Yorkshire were anxious to elect him to parliament; he pledged himself to serve if elected, but declined to come forward as a candidate. Much of his correspondence with the political unions of Halifax, Huddersfield, Dewsbury, and Wakefield, along with some observations on the corn and fund laws and parliamentary reform, is contained in a volume published as <span class="italic">An Address to the Electors and Others of the West-Riding of the County of York</span> (1833).<br>
<br>Higgins attended the meeting of the British Association at Cambridge in June 1833, returned home out of health, and died at his Yorkshire residence at Skellow Grange on 9 August 1833. His wife had died eleven years earlier, on 11 May 1822 at Bath. Higgins was a freemason, and a fellow of the Society of Arts, the Royal Asiatic Society, and other learned bodies.<br>
