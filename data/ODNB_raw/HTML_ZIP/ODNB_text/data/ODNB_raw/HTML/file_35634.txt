<span class="headword">Purser,  Louis Claude</span>  (1854&#150;1932), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born at Dungarvan, co. Waterford, on 28 September 1854, the youngest son of Benjamin Purser, grain merchant, of Dungarvan, and his wife, Anne, daughter of John Mallet, iron, brass, and copper founder, of Dublin (but originally from Devon), and sister of the engineer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17890/', "Robert Mallet")</script>. He was educated first at Midleton College, co. Cork, then at Portora Royal School, Enniskillen, before entering Trinity College, Dublin, in 1871. There he was influenced by that brilliant group of fellows, J. P. Mahaffy, Arthur Palmer, and R. Y. Tyrrell, who were then winning high repute for Dublin classical scholarship. Oscar Wilde was among his university contemporaries. A reverse in the family fortunes drove him into teaching before he graduated as senior moderator in classics in 1875, and between then and his election as a fellow in 1881 habits of industry and self-denial became second nature to him. By this time he had been attracted to the main interest of his life. In 1882 he collaborated with Tyrrell in the second volume of <span class="italic">The Correspondence of Cicero</span> (1886) and during the preparation of the subsequent volumes (1890, 1894, 1897, 1899) his contribution became predominant. In 1898 he was appointed professor of Latin at Trinity College but his modesty led him to resign in 1904 despite protests from his colleagues, and he thenceforth confined himself to administrative duties in the college. He was appointed vice-provost in 1924, but with the ill health of the provost, J. H. Bernard, Purser found himself burdened with quasi-public duties and, daunted perhaps by the pressures of the post, was driven once again by his anxious nature to resign after three years. In 1927 he also resigned his fellowship, but he lived long enough to complete the revision of <span class="italic">The Correspondence of Cicero</span> for its second edition. A private man, Purser clung to his rather cheerless rooms in the college and made his study his hearthstone. He died, unmarried, at Elpis Hospital, Lower Mount Street, Dublin, on 20 March 1932.<br>
<br>Purser's scholarship was marked by a literary gift and historical grasp as well as by minute and exhaustive criticism of text and language, and he will be remembered by <span class="italic">The Correspondence of Cicero</span>. His output is impossible to quantify precisely, for besides a critical text of Cicero's letters in the Oxford Classical Texts series (<span class="italic">Ad familiares</span>, 1901, and <span class="italic">Ad Atticum</span>, 1903), an edition of Apuleius's <span class="italic">Story of Cupid and Psyche</span> (1910), work on Sidonius Apollinaris and Prudentius in later years, and contributions to <span class="italic">Hermathena</span> and the <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> of the Royal Irish Academy, much of his work was inextricably involved with that of other scholars, whose books he completed and revised when they were stricken by illness. His completion of the edition of Ovid's <span class="italic">Heroides</span> by his colleague Arthur Palmer was praised with uncharacteristic warmth by A. E. Housman. Purser was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1923, and received honorary degrees from the universities of Glasgow (1914), Oxford (1923), and Durham (1931). He refused the presidency of the Royal Irish Academy, of which he was secretary from 1902 to 1914 and vice-president in 1916, 1922, and 1927&#150;8.<br>
