<span class="headword">Crockett,  Samuel Rutherford</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Samuel Crocket]</span>  (1859&#150;1914), <span class="occ">Free Church of Scotland minister and novelist</span>, was born Samuel Crocket on 24 September 1859 at the farm of Little Duchrae, Balmaghie, Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, natural son of Annie Crocket (1828&#150;1879), dairymaid, daughter of William Crocket (1784&#150;1875), tenant farmer, and his wife, Mary Dickson (1802&#150;1884). Crockett gave his father's name as &#145;David Blaine Crockett, farmer&#146; on his marriage certificate. His grandparents, although Cameronians, made his country childhood very happy. Stories of covenanting forebears were adventures to him: he acted them out like cowboys and indians. From the Free Church school at Castle Douglas he won in 1876 an annual &pound;20 bursary to Edinburgh University, supplementing it by miscellaneous journalism.<br>
<br>Thereafter Crockett explored Europe as a travelling tutor, and in 1881 entered New College, Edinburgh, as a Free Church divinity student, evangelized in slums, added Rutherford to his name, and continued his ever-increasing journalism. In 1886 he was called to the Free Church in Penicuik, Midlothian, and published <span class="italic">Dulce cor</span>, his poems. On 10 March 1887 he married Ruth Mary Milner (1861&#150;1932), daughter of a Manchester philanthropist and mill owner, whom he had met through his writing. They had four children, on whom Crockett based his six humorous books for children.<br>
<br>Crockett continued his journalism, rising early to write before starting his pastoral duties, which included literary and scientific talks to his congregation, following Free Church policy. Missions to miners and paper mill workers increased his warm sympathy for the poor; he was a leader in relief work after the 1889 Mauricewood pit disaster, and a hard-working, well-liked minister. Sketches of ministers and congregations, slyly mocking humbug in both, which he contributed to a Glasgow religious weekly, were so popular that twenty-four, published in 1893 as <span class="italic">The Stickit Minister</span>, brought Crockett immediate fame. The success in 1894 of <span class="italic">The Raiders</span> and <span class="italic">The Lilac Sunbonnet</span>, an adventure story and a romance, both evoking Galloway's wild beauty, encouraged him, impatient with Free Church narrowness, to risk full-time writing.<br>
<br>Often dismissed as merely a kailyard writer of sentimental, old-fashioned tales of Scottish rural life, Crockett inclined rather to the sensational, borrowing plots from experience, tradition, and his enormous library, taking liberties with history and exaggerating. He called himself a romancer but his hatred of cruelty, his sardonic humour, and his vigorous description and characterization in Scots and English came through with gusto, whether about covenanters (<span class="italic">The Men of the Moss Hags</span>), sixteenth-century Ayrshire feuds and Sawny Bean the macabre Scottish cannibal (<span class="italic">The Grey Man</span>), Edinburgh slums (<span class="italic">Cleg Kelly</span>), the tragic fifteenth-century Douglases (<span class="italic">The Black Douglas</span>, <span class="italic">Maid Margaret</span>), his own childhood melodramatically heightened (<span class="italic">Kit Kennedy</span>), or nineteenth-century Italian banditti (<span class="italic">The Silver Skull</span>). His range was wide and varied&#151;sixty-three books in twenty years, mostly novels and collections of short stories&#151;but every Crockett was different; many readers were disappointed.<br>
<br>Of immense stature, an alpine climber, golfer, and far-travelled photographer, Crockett was, however, never strong; weakened by recurrent malaria and enteritis, he nevertheless had to write, wintering abroad and returning home to Penicuik, Peebles, or Auchencairn in summer. His letters show cheerful courage, but his novels display strain and flagging power. He died suddenly at Villa Philip, Tarascon, near Avignon, southern France, on 16 April 1914, and was brought home to Balmaghie churchyard for burial on 23 April.<br>
