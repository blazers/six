<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Whitelegge, Sir  (Benjamin) Arthur</span>  (1852&#150;1933), <span class="occ">factory inspector</span>, was born on 17 October 1852 in Manchester, the son of Henry Whitelegge, gentleman, of Tideswell, Derbyshire, and his wife, Ann Mason Carrington, of Carrington Hall, Cheshire. He was educated at Tideswell grammar school and from 1870 at University College, London. He took the London University BSc in 1874, and qualified MRCS in 1876. There followed a series of clinical appointments: as house surgeon to the Manchester Hospital for Children, then medical officer to the St Pancras Smallpox Sanitarium, and finally medical officer to the Sheffield Fever Hospital.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Whitelegge continued to study, proceeding MB in 1878 and MD in 1881. He was particularly interested in infectious diseases and public health, and in 1881 he took the Cambridge University diploma in public health. In 1884 he was appointed medical officer of health for Nottingham. In 1889 he became county medical officer of health for the West Riding of Yorkshire, a post he combined from 1894 with the position of chief sanitary officer to the West Riding Rivers Board. In 1885 he married Fanny Marian, daughter of the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33998/', "John Callcott Horsley RA")</script>. They had two sons.<br>
<br>In 1886 the Local Government Board appointed a commission to investigate Louis Pasteur's claims to have found a cure for rabies. Whitelegge's brother-in-law Victor Horsley served on the commission, and Whitelegge supplied him with pathological specimens from rabid dogs caught around Nottingham. He subsequently gave evidence to a House of Lords committee on muzzling dogs, which he had found effective in controlling the Nottingham outbreak. He went on to conduct epidemiological studies of the transmission and variation of several other epidemic diseases, which established his reputation as an authority in this area. In 1890 the first edition of his <span class="italic">Manual of Hygiene and Public Health</span> appeared, and in 1891 he was appointed lecturer on hygiene and public health at Charing Cross Hospital medical school. He delivered the 1893 Milroy lectures to the Royal College of Physicians on changes of type in epidemic disease, and he served as examiner in state medicine to the University of London from 1895 to 1897.<br>
<br>Whitelegge's knowledge of epidemiology, and his experience of public health administration in industrial districts, recommended him at this time to the Home Office, which was being pressed to reorganize its industrial health work. From 1893 he served on a departmental committee to review the collection and publication of factory statistics, and from 1895 on a committee of inquiry into anthrax among wool sorters. In 1896 he was appointed chief inspector of factories and workshops, the first medical man to hold this position. Under his guidance the factory inspectorate was greatly expanded and systematically reorganized, and the districts assigned to inspectors were redrawn to encourage closer co-operation with local authority health services. He served on the royal commission on arsenical poisoning in beer (1901), and on the Home Office committee on the lighting of factories (1913). In 1902, when the annual meeting of the British Medical Association first ran a section of industrial hygiene and diseases of occupation, Whitelegge presided over that section, and in 1913 he was elected a vice-president of the Royal Sanitary Institute. Whitelegge was appointed FRCP in 1898, CB in 1902, and KCB in 1911.<br>
<br>By the time he retired in 1917, Whitelegge had proved himself a hard-working administrator. Punctilious and at times pedantic, he could appear abrupt and unfriendly. He was not physically robust and his main recreation was playing bridge and parlour games. He died on 25 April 1933 at Westminster Hospital, London, and was buried three days later.<br>
