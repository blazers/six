<span class="headword">Heath,  Roy Aubrey Kelvin</span>  (1926&#150;2008), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 13 August 1926 in Georgetown, British Guiana, the second son and youngest of the four children of Melrose Arthur Heath (<i>d</i>. 1928), head teacher of a primary school, and his wife, Jessie de Weever (<i>d</i>. 1991), music teacher. His father died before Heath's second birthday, leaving his mother to bring him up with his two sisters, Avis and Lynette, his elder brother, Sonny, being cared for by his maternal grandfather. They lived in the coastal village of Agricola until Heath was eight, when they moved back to Georgetown. Although living in a working-class area of the city in straitened circumstances the mother maintained the family's respectability, and believed strongly in the importance of her children's education. Heath himself became fascinated by the seething variety of human life in the close-packed community, and by the folklore and storytelling that were to influence his own later writing. While still attending Georgetown Central High School, he made surreptitious excursions to the city's billiard saloons and low-life dives.<br>
<br>Heath left school at sixteen for a career in the civil service, becoming a clerk in the treasury in 1944. In 1950 he arrived in Britain to further his education, from 1952 reading modern languages, part-time, at London University, while a clerk at Allen and Hanbury's factory in London. He gained a BA in French in 1956. On 10 January 1953 he had married Emilia (formerly Aemilia) Oberli, then an au pair to the Jewish arts benefactor George Rapp, who became Heath's patron. They had two sons and a daughter. From 1959 he taught at primary schools for the inner London education authority, and from 1968 French and German at Christ's College grammar school, Finchley. He was later to study law, being called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1964, and to the Guyana bar in 1973, but never practised as a lawyer.<br>
<br>Guyana's achievement of independence in 1966 prompted Heath's ambition to chronicle the social history of his homeland in the twentieth century. Beginning in 1972 he contributed short fiction to periodicals, to the Guyanese literary annual <span class="italic">Firebird</span>, and to the BBC. His first novel, <span class="italic">A Man Come Home</span>, followed in 1974. Its haunting narrative inspired by folk myth and its Guyanese setting heralded a distinctive talent confirmed by <span class="italic">The Murderer</span> (1978), a dark, intense tragedy set among the alleys and canals of Georgetown, which won that year's <span class="italic">Guardian</span> fiction prize. Seven novels followed, focusing on different aspects of Guyanese life and culture, all receiving high critical praise, as well as an autobiography of his early life, <span class="italic">Shadows Round the Moon</span> (1990).<br>
<br>Heath's Georgetown trilogy, <span class="italic">From the Heat of the Day</span> (1979), <span class="italic">One Generation</span> (1980), and <span class="italic">Genetha</span> (1981), reissued as <span class="italic">The Armstrong Trilogy</span> in 1994, chronicled the epic of a Guyanese middle-class family. The tragic protagonist in <span class="italic">Orealla</span> (1984) was poised between the frustrations of Georgetown society and the allure of a vanishing village culture. <span class="italic">The Shadow Bride</span> (1988), which he considered his finest work, re-created the life of the <i>d&eacute;racin&eacute;</i> east Indian immigrants, with the conflicts between social idealism and individual passions accentuated by the country's divisions and corruption. Village life was the setting of <span class="italic">Kwaku</span> (1982), a picaresque novel of an incompetent fake healer, whose story was given a political turn in Heath's last novel, <span class="italic">The Ministry of Hope</span> (1997), in which Kwaku moved to Georgetown and ironically found himself becoming successful in a world of endemic fraud and corruption.<br>
<br>Proficient in French and German, Heath was conversant with contemporary European literature and ideas. He had a great love of classical music. At the heart of his work lay a fascination with psychology and the dark workings of the psyche. He was influenced in particular by Freud, and by Jung, whose theories of the archetypes and the collective unconscious shaped both the content and method of his writing. But if his interests were cosmopolitan, he remained resolutely and, as he put it, &#145;intensely Guyanese&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 27 June 2008). For him psychology was inseparable from anthropology and history. The personal traumas central to his fiction were set in the context of Guyana's history of slavery, colonialism, and post-colonialism; the fragmentation of cultures imported from Africa, Asia, and Europe; and the powerful, distinctive presences of the country's towns and landscapes.<br>
<br>Heath refused British nationality, and eschewed publicity as a writer. He kept contacts with the immigrant working classes, teaching some of them English in adult evening classes. Until his mother's death he made regular return visits to Guyana. His one play, <span class="italic">Inez Combray</span>, won the Guyana Theatre Guild prize when produced in Georgetown in 1972. He gave the prestigious Edgar Mittelholzer lectures, &#145;Art and History&#146;, in 1984, and received the Guyana literature prize in 1989. Towards the end of his life he became increasingly debilitated by Parkinson's disease. Yet he never lost his interest in life. &#145;Perhaps the greatest truth&#146;, he wrote, &#145;is the elusiveness of truth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Shadows Round the Moon</span>, 124). He died on 14 May 2008 at Northwick Park Hospital, Harrow, London, of multiple causes, leaving behind a unique body of writing distinguished by its deep human insight and haunting evocation of place. He was survived by his wife, Emilia, and their three children.<br>
