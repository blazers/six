<span class="headword">Ashby, Sir  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1646, <em>d.</em> 1693), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was baptized on 21 March 1646, the fourth son of Robert Ashby (1607&#150;1659), merchant of Lowestoft, and his wife, Alice, a sister of the naval officer Sir Thomas Allin. The Allin connection probably explains Ashby's entry into the navy and subsequent promotion. He was lieutenant of the <i>Adventure</i> from November 1665 to June 1666, then lieutenant of the <i>Princess</i> in 1668 before being appointed to his first command, the <i>Deptford Ketch</i>, on 4 October 1668, serving in her until June 1669. He commanded the <i>Advice</i> and <i>Rainbow</i> in 1670&#150;72. Ashby took command of the <i>Pearl</i> in January 1672 and remained aboard her until the end of May 1673, fighting in the first battle of Schooneveld. He moved to the <i>Lion</i> before the second battle of Schooneveld on 4 June, serving in Prince Rupert's division of the Red squadron, and also served in her at the battle of the Texel on 11 August.<br>
<br>Ashby commanded the <i>Rose</i> from 1674 to 1677, partly in American waters, and took part in the naval operations connected with the 1675 rebellion in Virginia. He commanded the <i>Dunkirk</i> in 1678&#150;9, the <i>Constant Warwick</i> in 1680&#150;81, and the <i>Mary Rose</i> from 1681 to 1684, employed in the latter chiefly in convoying the Levant trade. In May 1685 he succeeded his uncle Sir Thomas Allin as governor of Sandgate Castle in Kent. From June to August 1685 Ashby commanded the <i>Mountague</i>, one of the ships mobilized to counter the rebellion of the duke of Monmouth, before taking command of the <i>Henrietta</i>, then in use as a guardship. Ashby commanded the <i>Mordaunt</i> in 1687&#150;8, and in September 1688, as part of the mobilization in response to the threatened invasion by William of Orange, he was appointed to command the third-rate <i>Defiance</i>. Those in the fleet who covertly supported William were keen to win Ashby over, he being &#145;zealous for the King, and had great credit in the fleet&#146;  (Laughton, 27). Ashby was reluctant at first, &#145;replying that in their profession they were not taught to turn against the King&#146;, but was eventually won over by his lieutenant, George Byng, who persuaded him of the need to fight &#145;popish oppression&#146;  (ibid., 28). During 1689 Ashby was warmly recommended by both of William's leading naval commanders, Arthur Herbert and Edward Russell, as a staunch supporter of the revolution. After commanding the <i>Defiance</i> creditably in the battle of Bantry Bay on 1 May 1689, he was knighted by William III aboard the flagship on 16 May, becoming rear-admiral of the Red squadron on 6 June.<br>
<br>In the 1690 campaign Ashby served initially as vice-admiral of the blue but was vice-admiral of the red during the battle of Beachy Head (30 June), flying his flag in the <i>Berwick</i>. The removal of Herbert from the chief command after the battle led to the appointment of three joint admirals on 6 August 1690, with Ashby serving alongside Sir Richard Haddock and Sir Henry Killigrew. His own conduct at Beachy Head was praised by Queen Mary, who assured him &#145;of her esteem of his courage and conduct &hellip; and that she will never forget his good service&#146;  (<span class="italic">Finch MSS</span>, 2.336) He reverted to vice-admiral of the red for the 1691 campaign but served as admiral of the blue in both 1692 and 1693, commanding from the <i>Victory</i> at the battles of Barfleur and La Hogue (19&#150;24 May 1692). Additionally, Ashby served on the Navy Board as controller of storekeepers' accounts from 11 July 1690 until his death, which occurred at Portsmouth on 12 June 1693. He was buried at Lowestoft, where a monument was erected in the parish church. He seems never to have married, and by his will, dated 7 June 1693, he bequeathed most of his estate to his brother Thomas, along with smaller bequests to several cousins and naval colleagues.<br>
