<span class="headword">Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [Thomas of Galloway]</span>, earl of Atholl  (<em>d.</em> 1231), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49361/', "Roland")</script>, lord of Galloway (<i>d</i>. 1200), and Helen (<i>d</i>. 1217), daughter of Richard de Morville, lord of Lauderdale and Cunningham and constable of the Scottish king. He had one brother and two sisters who survived to adulthood: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49362/', "Alan")</script>, who succeeded in 1200 to the lordship of Galloway; Ada, wife of Walter Bisset of Aboyne; and Dervorguilla, wife of Nicholas de Stuteville of Liddel in Cumbria. A marriage to an unidentified wife, contracted before <i>c</i>.1207&#150;8, produced a son old enough to serve as a hostage in England in 1213. Before January 1210 he married Isabella, elder daughter of Henry, earl of Atholl, and received the title of earl. With her he had two sons, but only the younger, <a href="#cosubject_50014">Patrick [<i>see below</i>]</a>, survived childhood. Maduff, &#145;son of the earl&#146;, a witness to a charter of Isabella in her widowhood, may be the son of the first marriage, or illegitimate. Thomas had one certain bastard, Alan.<br>
<br>The extent of Thomas's inheritance in Galloway is unknown, but from 1204&#150;5 it furnished him with a fleet of galleys. In that year he entered the service of King John, who hired the vessels for use in the abortive Normandy campaign and for the 1206 expedition to Poitou. This service brought property in northern and western England, apparently lost when he returned to Scotland <i>c</i>.1209. It was probably in the period 1205&#150;9 that Thomas committed the rape at York for which he was pardoned in 1212 at the request of the Scottish king. In 1211 Earl Thomas served against the MacWilliams in Ross, and in 1212 he began a series of operations in Ulster directed against &Aacute;ed &Oacute; N&eacute;ill, the MacWilliams' ally, which culminated in 1214 in his construction of a castle at Coleraine. Scottish and English policies here coincided, and an initial small grant of land in Ulster from John was enlarged in June 1215 into a substantial lordship centred on Coleraine. This, and a grant of the custody of Antrim Castle, were unsuccessful moves designed to win the earl's support in John's conflict with the barons&#151;he is not known to have played any part in the civil war in England of 1215&#150;17.<br>
<br>In June 1219 Earl Thomas gave homage and fealty to Henry III and received confirmation of his Irish possessions, but in July 1222 was ordered to surrender Antrim, and by 1224 Coleraine had been destroyed by &Oacute; N&eacute;ill. The mounting threat to Ulster from Hugh de Lacy, who was trying to recover the lordship there of which John had dispossessed him, saw English attempts to retain Earl Thomas's interest in Ireland, with cash payments and temporary grants of land being made until his possessions in Ulster could be restored. When the crown reached an accommodation with the Lacys in 1226, an apparently ineffective attempt was made to safeguard the earl's possessions. His inability to defend his Irish lands in the early 1220s arose from Earl Thomas's commitment to his brother's venture into Manx politics. In 1221 his galleys destroyed a Hebridean fleet off the Irish coast and slew Diarmait &Oacute; Conchobhair, claimant to the kingship of Connacht, which was held by an ally of Henry III, and in 1228 Earl Thomas was again active in the Isles, joining Alan's invasion of Man in support of the exiled King Ragnvald. But Earl Thomas gave no further aid after Ragnvald's death in 1229, and by July 1230 his ships were once more in English service, probably for Henry III's expedition to Brittany and Bordeaux. Earl Thomas's death, possibly as the result of a tournament accident, and his burial in Coupar Abbey are recorded in 1231. In 1252 Patrick, son of Constantine of Goswick, a knight of the earl of Dunbar, was pardoned by Henry III for the killing of Thomas of Galloway. Isabella survived him for an unknown number of years, but was dead before 1242. From about 1233 to perhaps about 1237, the earldom was held by Alan Durward, possibly through exercise of the wardship of the heir, Patrick, and in 1237 an unnamed earl of Atholl, perhaps Durward, witnessed the treaty of York.<br>
<br>The career of <a name="cosubject_50014"></a><span class="headword">Patrick</span>, fifth earl of Atholl  (<em>c.</em>1222&#150;1242)<span class="occ"></span>, who was a minor in 1231, was brief. In 1242 he was about to enter his inheritance, when his murdered body was found in his burnt-out lodgings in Haddington. No satisfactory explanation for his murder presents itself, but his Comyn kinsmen accused John Bisset and his uncle, Walter Bisset of Aboyne, husband of Patrick's aunt, Ada. While the Comyns claimed that control of Patrick's paternal lands in Galloway and Ireland was the motive, their accusations may have been prompted by territorial rivalry in Scotland. This was believed by many contemporaries, including Alexander II, who was reluctant to act until he was forced to banish Walter Bisset by the earls of Buchan and Dunbar. Atholl passed to Patrick's maternal aunt, Forueleth, and her husband, David Hastings.<br>
