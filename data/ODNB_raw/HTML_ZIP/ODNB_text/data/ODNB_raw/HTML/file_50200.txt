<span class="headword">Favent,  Thomas</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1388&#150;1400), <span class="occ">tract writer</span>, cannot be securely identified. He has been identified with Thomas Favent, a clerk in the diocese of Salisbury, who in 1393 obtained a papal licence to choose his confessor, and in 1400 received a ratification of his estate in the church of Donnington in the diocese of Salisbury. This Thomas Favent presumably took his name from Fovant in Wiltshire, and was probably related to Cecily Fovent, the abbess of the nunnery of Shaftesbury who in 1406 founded a chantry in memory of her parents. But there also appears in the government records of this time a Thomas Fovent, clerk, who in 1391 was appointed collector of tunnage and poundage in the port of London, a position that he relinquished in 1395. This Thomas Fovent would have been well placed to comment upon events in London, and it is tempting to identify him with the Salisbury clerk. Yet if he was the author of a treatise in favour of the appellants little else is known about him, and there is no evidence relating to the circumstances that lay behind his appointment in 1391. It is possible that his treatise, on the Merciless Parliament of 1388, which survives only in a late medieval transcript  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Bodley misc. 2963), was relatively unknown in Richard II's reign.<br>
<br>The treatise itself is a highly partisan piece of writing. Its purpose was to justify the action of the lords appellant in seeking to condemn certain of Richard's supporters in the parliament of 1388. Misleadingly called a history of the Wonderful Parliament of 1386, the opening part of the treatise is of some slight historical value, and includes an account of Nicholas Brembre's attempt to hold London against the appellants. Despite the bias of his writing, Favent's description of the Merciless Parliament itself constitutes a useful record of that assembly, and enables us to establish more clearly the sequence of events. In his work Favent included a good deal of procedural information which must have derived from a well-informed source, possibly Geoffrey Martin, one of the clerks of the crown. Favent also had an eye for dramatic detail, seen in his account of the capture of the chief justice, Sir Robert Tresilian, and he occasionally supplies information which is not to be found elsewhere. His treatise, which seems to have been written immediately after the Merciless Parliament, may never have circulated outside an extremely small circle. It had some influence later, however, for during the reign of Charles I &#145;a rough English translation&#146;  (McKisack, v) was used by parliamentary pamphleteers to encourage resistance to the crown. Published in 1641 as <span class="italic">A true relation of that memorable parliament, which wrought wonders</span>, this version was attributed to Thomas Fannant.<br>
