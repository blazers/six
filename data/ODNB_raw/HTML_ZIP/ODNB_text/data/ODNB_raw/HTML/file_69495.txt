</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Barton, Sir  Derek Harold Richard</span>  (1918&#150;1998), <span class="occ">organic chemist</span>, was born on 8 September 1918 at Grenfell, Sun Lane, Gravesend, Kent. His father, William Thomas Barton, was a carpenter, his mother was Maud Henrietta, formerly Lukes. He was educated at Tonbridge School, Kent, but he had to leave without any qualifications after his father's sudden death in 1935. For the next two years he worked in the family timber business but, convinced that there must be something more interesting in life, he attended Gillingham Technical College to pass the necessary examinations, including the Imperial College entrance examination. For financial reasons he had to choose London University, and he entered Imperial College in 1938. After only two years' study Barton obtained the top BSc with first-class honours in chemistry. Research in organic chemistry with Professor I. M. Heilbron followed. During the Second World War research on a topic of national interest was encouraged and Barton chose the synthesis of vinyl chloride, for which he received a research fellowship from the Distillers Company. In this he collaborated with a refugee German chemist named Mugdan who had spent his working life in industry. From him Barton learned how a practical industrial chemist would approach a problem.<h2>
<a name="Widerangingexperience"></a>Wide-ranging experience</h2>This early work involved the gas-phase pyrolysis of dichloroethanes. Barton studied this process using glass apparatus. At first the reaction was rapid but it slowed as the glass surface became contaminated. Barton later noticed that of two forms of dichloroethane one decomposed much faster than the other. Moreover the results varied from day to day. He traced these effects to differences in the method of preparation and to an uncontrolled factor&#151;a leak in the apparatus which let in variable amounts of air. Small amounts of oxygen or chlorine, he found, had a spectacular effect on the rate of decomposition of 1,2 dichloroethane (CH<sub>2</sub>Cl-CH<sub>2</sub>Cl), but none at all on that of 1,1 dichloroethane (CHCl<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub>) and he concluded that the reaction mechanisms must be different. He also found that in commercial 1,2 dichloroethane small quantities of an impurity, ethylene chlorohydrin (CH<sub>2</sub>Cl-CH<sub>2</sub>OH), acted as an inhibitor which he removed by treatment with aqueous potassium permanganate or chromic acid. Barton completed his PhD in 1942, having laid the foundations for some important aspects of his later chemical researches.<br>
<br>About this time a medical examination revealed a cardiac weakness, and Barton was excused night-time fire-watch duties. The condition also precluded him from active service, and he remained at Imperial College working for two years in military intelligence developing secret inks for use on human skin behind enemy lines. On 20 December 1944 he married Jeanne Kate Wilkins (<i>b</i>. 1916/17), a clerk; they had one son. Barton then spent a year in chemical industry at Albright and Wilson in Birmingham. Here he was concerned with the synthesis of organo-phosphorus compounds. The work was routine but there was a good chemical library and his reading introduced him to the latest physical organic chemistry of E. D. Hughes and C. K. Ingold. Barton had become interested in the complex chemistry of the steroids as an undergraduate and he continued to pursue this subject in his spare time, preparing himself for the chance to investigate their reactions.<br>
<br>In 1945 Barton returned to Imperial College as an assistant lecturer, but as there was no vacancy in organic chemistry he spent four years teaching inorganic and physical chemistry. This forced him to take a far more mathematical approach to chemistry than he had formerly adopted. He was encouraged by E. R. H. Jones to attempt a correlation between optical rotation and molecular structure by analysing the literature on the triterpenoids. These are complex, cyclic hydrocarbons of general formula C<sub>30</sub>H<sub>48</sub> which occur in nature. Many show optical activity based on stereoisomerism, a property of the three-dimensional carbon atom explained by J. H. Van't Hoff in 1874. Barton showed that, using Van't Hoff's principle of optical superposition, molecular structures could be correlated with optical activity. His approach was empirical with no theoretical basis and he called it the method of molecular rotational differences. It was useful in the period from 1940 to 1960 and can still be applied today. Barton later extended it to other natural compounds such as the bile acids, hormones, and steroids. This work contributed to his later researches in conformational analysis where preferred three-dimensional shapes of organic molecules are correlated with their chemical reactivities and physical properties.<br>
<br>In 1890 Hermann Sachse, an assistant at the Charlottenburg Institute in Germany, had pointed out that if the normal tetrahedral angle of 109&deg; 28' of the quadrivalent carbon atom was retained in the cyclohexane ring (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>) two conformations free from angle strain could exist. This observation was ignored until 1918 when Ernst Mohr, professor of chemistry at Heidelberg, reintroduced the theory of strain-free carbon rings. Mohr suggested two arrangements for cyclohexane which he called &#145;boat&#146; and &#145;chair&#146; structures. He found that the chair conformation in which three carbon atoms are above the plane of the molecule while the other three are below it was more stable than the boat arrangement in which the two carbon atoms at each end of the ring are raised above the rest. This was confirmed in 1943 by the Norwegian physical chemist Odd Hassel using electron diffraction techniques, and reconfirmed by K. S. Pitzer using statistical mechanics.<h2>
<a name="Conformationalanalysis"></a>Conformational analysis</h2>Thus when Barton entered the field of conformational analysis some important groundwork had already been done, but it was Barton who first showed that conformational analysis could be applied to polycyclic systems with powerful effect. He realized the importance of the shape of the cyclohexane molecule to his studies of the steroids and showed that understanding the conformations of such complex molecules was essential to any study of their chemical reactivities. In 1948, as an ICI research fellow, he began to study the stereochemistry of abietic acid (C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>30</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), a diterpene derivative which forms the chief constituent of rosin. When oxidized with nitric acid in the presence of a vanadium pentoxide catalyst a tri-carboxylic acid was obtained and using a mixture of organic chemistry and physical measurements Barton was able to determine the conformation of abietic acid. He also designed a set of molecular models that would accurately represent the geometry of the steroids and other complex molecules and allowed him to visualize the three-dimensional principles of conformational analysis. His application of these principles to the steroids enabled him to rationalize a large body of existing steroid chemistry which had proved incomprehensible using standard two-dimensional stereochemistry.<br>
<br>The reputation which Barton gained by these researches led to an invitation to spend a year as a visiting lecturer and associate professor at Harvard in 1949. He was required to stand in for R. B. Woodward during a sabbatical year, but as Woodward continued his research at Harvard he and Barton worked together and became firm friends. Barton disagreed with Louis Feiser's theory about steric effects in the steroids to account for their unusual reactivities. Having already begun to develop the concept of conformational analysis he analysed the observations in terms of the preferred conformation of the molecule. Heated discussions followed but Barton maintained his ideas which he announced in a short paper on &#145;The conformation of the steroid nucleus&#146;, published in the Swiss journal <span class="italic">Experientia</span> in 1950. In this paper Barton explained that &#145;conformation&#146; referred to different spatial arrangements in molecular structures which allowed bonded atoms to remain combined without strain. He showed that the conformation of a complex molecule exerts an even greater influence on its chemical reactivity than the chemical groups it contains. Barton was in a unique position to do this, having acquired an excellent knowledge of steroid and terpinoid chemistry, while at the same time teaching and researching in the field of gas-phase chemical kinetics. He realized that there should be a relation between rates of reaction and the preferred conformations of the reacting molecules. The rates of reactivity of the same chemically active group in different isomers of steroids could be predicted and even calculated from differences in spatial orientation. Conformational analysis was soon being applied to all types of compounds. The recognition that important differences in reactivity may come from small differences in spatial structures involving the same chemical groups introduced a new three-dimensional view of molecular structures that was widely utilized by practical organic chemists. Conformational analysis revolutionized organic chemistry and in recognition of his work Barton received many awards including the first Roger Adams award of the American Chemical Society, the Davy medal of the Royal Society and in 1969 the Nobel prize, shared with Odd Hassel.<br>
<br>Strain-free conformations can be found in five-membered rings and above, but in cyclic molecules containing 7 to 12 carbon atoms there are usually several conformations of similar energy. Since the 1960s experimental techniques such as X-ray and electron diffraction analyses and infra-red, nuclear magnetic resonance, and microwave spectroscopies have been augmented by molecular mechanics, a computational method by which the total strain energies of various conformations can be calculated. The structure with the lowest energy is always found to be the most stable. By such calculations unstable conformations, difficult to study experimentally, can be examined and the quality of molecular mechanics calculations has become very high. However, Barton was always less interested in the quantitative aspects of conformational analysis than in applying its principles to experimental problems.<br>
<br>On his return to Britain, Barton was appointed reader and later, in 1953, professor of organic chemistry at Birkbeck College, London. Here he continued his research on conformational analysis by applying its principles to stereochemical problems in triterpenoid molecules. Lanosterol (C<sub>29</sub>H<sub>40</sub>O) was synthesized jointly by Barton and Woodward and Barton was able to correct the proposed structure for cycloartenol using his conformational principles. Both were later recognized as key compounds in biosynthesis. While at Birkbeck, Barton developed a synthesis of usnic acid, a main constituent of lichens. This involved free-radical coupling of phenols and led to a general theory of the biosynthesis of alkaloids through phenol coupling. He pursued this theory through classic laboratory syntheses and by isolating plant substances from plants fed with solutions containing radioactive atoms for labelling purposes. He also proposed the metabolic pathway by which morphine and other alkaloids are made in the poppy. In 1954 Barton was elected FRS and in the following year he was invited to become regius professor of chemistry at the University of Glasgow.<h2>
<a name="ProfessorshipsatGlasgowandLondon"></a>Professorships at Glasgow and London</h2>At Glasgow, Barton collaborated with Monteath Robertson, a leading X-ray crystallographer, attacking a variety of structural problems involving clerodin, limonin, and the sesquiterpene carophyllene on which Barton had begun work at Birkbeck. Barton's group used chemical degradation methods while Monteath studied the same compounds by crystallographic methods. At Glasgow, Barton also entered another field of research involving organic photochemistry. In particular he studied the effects of light on the molecular rearrangements of santonin. Arising from this work he published numerous papers on organic photochemistry in the early 1960s. During his vacations while at Glasgow, Barton returned to the United States to work at the Research Institute for Medicine and Chemistry in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Here he developed a photochemical procedure which became known as Barton's reaction. It brought together his interests in stereochemistry and photochemistry and was later used in the synthesis of the steroid hormone aldosterone. Barton was elected fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1956, but his stay at Glasgow was ended abruptly in the following year when he was appointed professor of organic chemistry at Imperial College, London. Here he continued his work on organic syntheses and the development of new synthetic reactions for the next twenty years.<br>
<br>One of Barton's most important advances came early in his tenure at Imperial College. In 1958 he became associated with the newly established Research Institute for Medicine and Chemistry at Cambridge, England. The first objective of this group was to devise a viable synthesis of aldosterone, the hormone which controls the electrolyte balance in the body. Known methods involved unacceptably high temperatures, but Barton suggested a solution based on his photochemical work. He proposed a process in which the photolysis of corticosterone (C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>23</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) would produce pure crystals of aldosterone acetate. The process revealed Barton's ingenuity in that he used light as the energy source, whereas most organic reactions used heat. It was also remarkable for the use of free radicals, but, most important, it provided a method for preparing the steroid aldosterone (C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>21</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) at a time when the world supply was only a few milligrams. The power of his new synthesis was demonstrated at a lecture when he produced a bottle containing 60 grams of the steroid. Following this success Barton concentrated on the discovery of new chemical reactions which would provide economical and more efficient methods for the manufacture of complex organic compounds. He made many contributions to natural product research.<br>
<br>His first marriage was dissolved and Barton married his second wife, Christiane Cognet, in 1969. In the following year he was appointed Hofmann professor of organic chemistry and in 1972 he was awarded the royal medal of the Royal Society. In the same year he was knighted and also received the French L&eacute;gion d'honneur (chevalier 1972; officer 1985). He was president of the Royal Society of Chemistry in 1973&#150;4. Continuing his study of the applications of radical chemistry Barton developed a theory called phenolic oxidative coupling by which he could explain how complex structures such as morphine could be synthesized inside plants. In 1975 he invented a deoxygenation process to increase the biological activity of certain antibiotics by removing secondary hydroxyl radicals. In the experimental development of this process Barton was assisted by S. W. McCombie and the resulting process became known as the Barton&#150;McCombie reaction.<h2>
<a name="MovetoFrance"></a>Move to France</h2>For some years Barton had been associated with the French Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and in 1978, at sixty, he retired from Imperial College, having the previous year become director of the Institut de Chimie des Substances Naturelles, at Gif-sur-Yvette, France. The main reason for this move was his desire to avoid compulsory retirement at sixty-five. He spent eight years at Gif-sur-Yvette and settled easily into French life. His second wife, who was French, was naturally pleased to return to her native country. During this very creative period Barton worked on the invention of new reactions involving radicals which began a whole new approach to organic synthesis. It was in this field that he began to attack his last great scientific challenge, the oxidation of saturated hydrocarbons. His aim was to convert petroleum products into feedstocks for the fine chemicals industry. Drawing on his encyclopaedic knowledge of natural reactions and his imagination of primordial conditions on earth, he invented the successful Gif oxidation, using a combination of air, iron powder, hydrogen sulphide, vinegar, and a little pyridine. In 1980 he was awarded the Copley medal of the Royal Society. In 1983 he introduced radical reagents called Barton esters. He also made important contributions to fluorination, vitamin D chemistry, and the penicillins. In each case Barton made a major contribution which would have been the high point for most other organic chemists.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsandreputation"></a>Last years and reputation</h2>Once more faced with the prospect of unwanted retirement in 1985 he looked for a new chance to continue his work on the discovery of new chemical reactions. He accepted an invitation to become distinguished professor of chemistry at Texas A and M University, USA, where he worked on novel reactions involving the oxidation of hydrocarbons. In 1992 his second wife died and a year later he married Judith Von-Leuenberger Cobb. He continued to travel the world as he had done for many years, attending international conferences, lecturing and acting as a consultant in industry and universities. In 1995 he became Dow professor of chemical invention, a post he held until his death at College Station, Texas A and M University, on 16 March 1998. He was survived by his third wife.<br>
<br>Derek Barton's personality was complex. The public persona he presented in scientific meetings was austere. With his scientific rigour he was prone to ask the most probing questions after a lecture and many of his scientific colleagues, finding it hard to live up to his demanding standards, were in awe of him. To those who knew him well, however, he revealed a sense of fun and a wealth of anecdotes. He also showed a surprisingly catholic range of interests including music and literature. Above all, he was intensely proud of the worldwide extent of his former colleagues with whom he maintained contact and always wished to help. Barton dominated organic chemistry for fifty years, changing the subject by his prodigious knowledge, vision, and insight. He produced a vast corpus of original work, even surpassing his personal target to publish a thousand papers before the age of eighty. During his long career he trained more than 300 students and post-doctoral fellows, many of whom went on to hold important chairs of chemistry.<br>
