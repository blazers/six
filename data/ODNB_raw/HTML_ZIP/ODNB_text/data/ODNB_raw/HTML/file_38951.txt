<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kauffer,  Edward McKnight</span>  (1890&#150;1954), <span class="occ">artist and graphic designer</span>, was born Edward Kauffer in Great Falls, Cascade county, Montana, USA, on 14 December 1890, the only son of John and Anna Kauffer. His parents were first- and second-generation immigrants to the United States, his father of Hanseatic German stock, his mother of Swedish origin. John Kauffer, a violinist and trap-drummer, was away from home with touring bands for long periods. The marriage ended in divorce when Edward was three and he was sent to an orphanage for two years. He grew up in the small brewing town of Evansville on the Ohio River in Indiana. In 1899 Anna Kauffer married John M. Rees and Edward enjoyed a settled family life and encouragement for his youthful artistic aspirations.<br>
<br>At the age of twelve or thirteen Kauffer left school to become a helper to the scene painter at Evansville's grand opera. From the age of seventeen he was listed as a painter in the city directory and, in the same year, 1907, he left home to tour with a company of travelling players. The character actor Frank Bacon took Kauffer up and in 1910 found him a position with the San Francisco bookseller and art dealer Paul Elder. Here Kauffer contracted a lifelong love of books&#151;of which he became a distinguished illustrator&#151;and received his first formal training as a painter at the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art. Maria Zimmern Petrie, who met Kauffer in his early twenties, remembered him as &#145;a very tall, lanky, good-looking man, with a slightly curved nose, blue eyes, a shock of red hair and the very light complexion that often goes with red hair&#146;  (private information). Kauffer was befriended by a regular customer of the bookshop, Professor Joseph E. McKnight, who offered to help him to study in Paris. In gratitude Kauffer adopted his patron's name: as Edward McKnight Kauffer he became well known as a painter in avant-garde circles in London during the First World War and famous afterwards in poster art, the field he made his own. Having arrived in Paris in autumn 1913, Kauffer studied in the afternoon sketch schools and at the Acad&eacute;mie Moderne, painting under the spell of Van Gogh. On 7 July 1914 he married Grace Ehrlich, a gifted American concert pianist. A month later the onset of the First World War forced them to leave for England.<br>
<br>&#145;I do not know how he came to England&#146;, wrote Sir Francis Meynell in the catalogue of the memorial exhibition of Kauffer's work held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1955, &#145;but when he came he was already the exquisite, the son of a hundred kings.&#146; The attraction was mutual; Kauffer came to love England, its sense of tranquillity and tradition. He was welcomed into disparate and often warring artistic factions&#151;including the London Group, Roger Fry's Omega Workshops, and Wyndham Lewis's X Group&#151;and in 1915 he was commissioned to design posters by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London. Here his patron was Frank Pick. Over the next twenty-five years Kauffer became Pick's most prolific and innovative designer. Kauffer began in 1915 with a poster titled &#145;In Watford&#146; which displayed his interest in the Japanese woodblock print and the work of Van Gogh. Soon Kauffer added fauve touches to his designs and then forceful imagery in the vorticist style. His single most important and widely reproduced poster design was initially published, under the title &#145;Flight&#146;, in <span class="italic">Colour</span> magazine in June 1917. This design presented, as Francis Meynell wrote, &#145;a flight of birds that might almost be a flight of aeroplanes; a symbol, in those days of hope, of the unity of useful invention and natural things&#146;. The composition was based on the sketches Kauffer had made the previous year at Blewbury in Berkshire. However, the design was also informed by Kauffer's knowledge of Japanese art, futurism, and vorticism. &#145;Flight&#146; was used by Meynell in March 1919 to launch the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span>, captioned &#145;Soaring to Success! DAILY HERALD&#151;the Early Bird&#146;.<br>
<br>Until 1921 Kauffer regarded himself as a painter and always kept his art practice alive, sometimes in the medium of watercolour. As well as the Underground Electric Railways, Kauffer's clients included Eastman &amp; Co., the drycleaners, Eno's Fruit Salts, Derry and Toms, the Kensington department store, Steinthal &amp; Co. in Manchester, for whom he devised eye-catching labels for cotton bales, Vigil Silk, and Pomeroy Day Cream. However, Kauffer took on a variety of commissions during the 1920s, such as a cubist-inspired street sign for the Poetry Bookshop, titles for Alfred Hitchcock's film <span class="italic">The Lodger</span>, graphics for the British Empire Exhibition of 1924, posters for the Empire Marketing Board, books vividly illustrated by the pochoir process for Curwen Press, and rugs woven by the Wilton Royal Carpet Factory. For Meynell, Kauffer also provided 150 witty illustrations for the Nonesuch Press edition of <span class="italic">The Anatomy of Melancholy</span> (1925). Kauffer's sprightly, jazzy, designs were part of the social fabric of progressive, forward-looking Britain in his time. In Evelyn Waugh's <span class="italic">Brideshead Revisited</span> (1945) the fictional Charles Ryder recalls how he had displayed a Kauffer poster in his Oxford college rooms in the early 1920s.<br>
<br>Kauffer's dominance continued, in the more sober guise of greys, beiges, and aluminium inks, into the late 1920s and 1930s. Between 1927 and 1929 he worked as a designer at the W. S. Crawford advertising agency. His colleague Ashley Havinden remembered Kauffer's impact: while other designers sat hunched over work tables, Kauffer stood at an adjustable architect's desk imported from Germany. Clients during the 1930s included the Orient Line and Shell-Mex, for whom he designed striking lorry-bills. For Embassy Court, the apartment block in Brighton by Welles Coates, Kauffer designed a photo-mural on the theme of leisure. He provided the sets and costumes for many theatre productions, culminating with the Arthur Bliss ballet <span class="italic">Checkmate</span>, premi&egrave;red at Sadler's Wells in 1937 (and revised by Kauffer for its revival at Covent Garden in 1947). For his friend T. S. Eliot he made illustrations to accompany the <span class="roman">Ariel</span> poems. Kauffer was a man of many friendships. Other friends included his fellow artists Roger Fry and Man Ray, the writers Aldous Huxley and Marianne Moore, and enlightened clients like Jack Beddington of Shell and Eric Gregory of Lund Humphries. Kauffer's triumph in his English years was signalled by his appointment as an honorary (being American) royal designer for industry in the first awards made in 1936. The next year Kauffer received the accolade of a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art, New York.<br>
<br>A daughter, Ann, had been born to the Kauffers on 6 October 1920; however, their marriage had failed by the 1920s. From 1923 Kauffer lived with the American textile designer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38548/', "Marion Dorn")</script>, at 17 John Street, The Adelphi, London (to 1931), and then at Swan Court, Chelsea, until July 1940. They eventually married at City Hall, New York, in 1950. In 1940 Kauffer and Dorn had, at the urging of the American embassy in London, reluctantly left England. Although he continued to produce distinguished work&#151;inventive posters for American Airlines, haunting illustrations to Poe for Alfred A. Knopf, and numerous thoughtful book jackets for Random House&#151;Kauffer never fully rebuilt his career in his native land. He died in New York City on 22 October 1954, and was buried at Woodlawn cemetery. He was survived by his first wife, Grace, by Marion Dorn, and by his daughter, Ann, who died in 1996.<br>
<br>T. S. Eliot summed up Kauffer's contribution: &#145;He did something for modern art with the public and something for the public with modern art&#146;  (notes for BBC talk on Kauffer, King's College Archive Centre, Cambridge). Kauffer brought finesse to the uninspiring world of &#145;commercial art&#146; and became a leader in the new profession of graphic design.<br>
