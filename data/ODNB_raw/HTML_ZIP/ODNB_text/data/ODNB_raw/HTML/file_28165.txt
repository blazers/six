<span class="headword">Vaux,  William</span>, third Baron Vaux  (1535&#150;1595), <span class="occ">recusant and priest harbourer</span>, was probably born at Harrowden, Northamptonshire, in August 1535, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28163/', "Thomas Vaux, second Baron Vaux (1509&#150;1556)")</script>, and Elizabeth (1504&times;9&#150;1556), daughter and heir of Sir Thomas Cheyne of Irthlingborough. William succeeded to the title upon the death of his father in October 1556, and at some time before 1 June 1557 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Beaumont of Grace Dieu, Leicestershire. They had four children: <a href="#cosubject_69039">Henry [<i>see below</i>]</a>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69032/', "Eleanor Brooksby (c.1560&#150;1625)")</script>, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1561), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28159/', "Anne Vaux (bap. 1562, d. in or after 1637)")</script>. Upon the death of his first wife (12 August 1562) William married Mary, daughter of John Tresham of Rushton and sister of Sir Thomas Tresham. They had five children: George (1564&#150;1594), Edward (<i>d</i>. 1585), Ambrose (<i>d</i>. 1626), Muriel, and Catherine.<br>
<br>On 20 January 1558 Vaux took his seat in the House of Lords and appeared there several times during the final year of Mary Tudor's reign. After her death he was one of the noblemen appointed to escort the new queen, Elizabeth, from Hatfield to London. He stayed away from parliament in 1559 and gave his proxy to the earl of Bedford, a protestant. Despite being known as a Catholic in 1567 and being listed as a supporter of the queen of the Scots he was a commissioner for musters in 1569&#150;70, on a committee dealing with vagabonds and the eating of meat at forbidden times in 1572, and on a commission for gaol delivery in 1578&#150;9. Persons believed that Vaux was arrested after the invasion of Ireland, but he was still at liberty at that time because he signed the certificate of musters on 22 September 1580 and sat in parliament on 19 January 1581. The queen and council viewed Vaux as a loyal subject despite his recusancy and support for Mary Stuart until his association with the Jesuit Edmund Campion.<br>
<br>In 1567 or 1568 Vaux looked for a competent tutor for his precocious son Henry. He decided upon Campion, who accepted the invitation and spent several months at Harrowden. Campion's letter to Henry, written on the eve of his departure from Oxford to Ireland in July 1570, testified to his deep friendship with the Vaux family and to the cultivated atmosphere in which Henry was raised. Vaux's troubles began after Campion's capture at the end of July 1581. On 6 August the privy council instructed Sir Walter Mildmay to summon Vaux and commit him to the custody of someone sound in religion because it was believed that Campion had stayed at his house. On 18 August he was questioned in the presence of members of the privy council. He and Sir Thomas Tresham were asked to swear that Campion had stayed at their houses. Both refused and were committed to the Fleet as close prisoners. Along with Tresham and others Vaux appeared before Star Chamber on 15 November. Asked again if Campion had stayed at his house, Vaux replied: &#145;And as to the receiving of Mr. Campion I (albeit I confess he was school master to some of my boys) yet deny that he was at my house. I say that he was not there to my knowledge, whereof reprove me [that is prove me wrong], and let me be punished with that punishment I deserve&#146;  (Anstruther, 122). They remained close prisoners after the trial. None the less at least once, <i>c</i>.7 January 1582, he and the other Catholic prisoners attended a clandestine mass in the Fleet. For this offence he and Tresham were fined 100 marks each. During his imprisonment his daughter Elizabeth entered the Poor Clares in Rouen in March 1582, and his sons Edward and Ambrose visited the English College in Rome in April. George visited the college in Rheims later the same year. Interestingly Vaux was never tried for sending his children abroad. About 19 April 1583 he and Tresham were released. During his imprisonment he had conveyed land to his sons so that it could not be seized to pay his recusancy fines.<br>
<br>Vaux was forced to remain in the London area, and rented a house in Hackney which was frequented by priests, as the council knew. Because of his fines and his conveyances of land, he could not pay his levy for light horse and lances. Lord Vaux's house received attention in the winter of 1585&#150;6 as the site of an exorcism performed by the Jesuit William Weston upon a servant of Anthony Babington, later infamous for his role in the Babington plot. On 7 December 1587 Vaux was committed to the care of the archbishop of Canterbury. He was released in February 1589 when he appeared in the House of Lords. In 1590 Vaux was allowed to go to Northamptonshire for the first time in nine years. By this date his physical and mental health had deteriorated. In 1591 a government spy commented of Vaux and Thomas Tresham that they were good subjects and opposed the plans of the Spanish. The spy found their loyalty most remarkable. Vaux died on 30 August 1595 at Irthlingborough. The title passed to his grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28160/', "Edward Vaux")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28163/', "Vaux, Thomas, second Baron Vaux (1509&#150;1556)")</script>], first-born son of George Vaux and Elizabeth Roper.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_69039"></a><span class="headword">Henry Vaux</span>  (<em>c.</em>1559&#150;1587)<span class="occ"></span> was most likely born at Harrowden, the oldest son of William, third Baron Vaux, and Elizabeth Beaumont. He was an especially talented child, and by the age of thirteen was writing poetry in English and Latin. In 1571 Lord Vaux entrusted the care of the children of his marriage with Elizabeth Beaumont to her mother (also named Elizabeth) for ten years. He paid &pound;20 annually for Henry and &pound;10 annually for each of his sisters. Presumably the children received most of their education at Grace Dieu. In 1580 Henry Vaux was a member of an association of Catholic laymen, organized by George Gilbert to meet and support recently arrived priests and to conduct them to Catholic households. By 1583 he refused to marry because of his desire to become a priest. Consequently he and Lord Vaux drafted an agreement whereby the title and inheritance was settled on his half-brother George after an annuity had been set aside for Henry. Henry postponed his departure for the continent to study for orders until he constructed a safe network for clergy in England.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1580s Henry provided accommodation for and assistance to priests. He attended the meeting of leading recusants, priests, and Jesuits in Hoxton in the spring of 1585 that resulted in the establishment of a fund for the support of the clergy. Henry promised 100 marks to the fund. Periodically he was named in interrogations and confessions. On 5 November 1586 Henry was captured when the Vaux house in Hackney was raided. After examination by the privy council he was sent to the Marshalsea prison. Because of the deterioration of his health he was released for three months on 22 May 1587. He went to stay with his sister Eleanor Brooksby at Great Ashby, where he died of consumption on 19 November 1587. In a letter to Claudio Acquaviva, Jesuit father general, on 16 April 1596, Henry Garnet claimed that Henry Vaux pronounced the simple vows of the Society of Jesus immediately before his death. Few seem to have been aware of the vows. Indeed the Jesuit John Gerard wrote that the only thing that caused Henry Vaux regret on his deathbed was that he could not then be admitted into the society.<br>
