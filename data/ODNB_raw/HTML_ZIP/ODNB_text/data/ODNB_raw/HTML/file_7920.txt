<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Douglas,  Thomas</span>, fifth earl of Selkirk  (1771&#150;1820), <span class="occ">colonist and proponent of colonization in North America</span>, was born at St Mary's Isle, Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland, on 20 June 1771, the youngest of the seven sons of Dunbar Douglas, fourth earl of Selkirk (1722&#150;1799), and his wife, Helen Hamilton (1737/8&#150;1802), the daughter of the Hon. John Hamilton and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Home. His father was an obscure Scottish nobleman of &#145;true whig&#146; political proclivities who had been educated under Francis Hutcheson at the University of Glasgow and spent most of his life improving his estates. Only around the time of Thomas's birth did he begin to become involved in a prolonged political struggle for the independence of the Scots peerage from English ministerial authority. During the war against America he was an outspoken critic of government conduct.<h2>
<a name="Earlylife"></a>Early life</h2>Like several of his elder brothers, Thomas was educated at Palgrave, a Unitarian dissenting academy located about 30 miles north of Cambridge and run by the Revd Rochemont Barbauld and his wife, Anna Laetitia. Mrs Barbauld was a minor poet who believed in the unity of moral and intellectual development. Besides English accents, the Douglas boys probably acquired at Palgrave the consumptive tendencies that bedevilled them throughout their adult lives. While Thomas was attending Palgrave, his father and his eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76177/', "Basil William Douglas (Lord Daer)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42297/', "London Corresponding Society")</script>], increased the intensity of the family campaign not only for the reform of the political privileges enjoyed by the Scottish peerage but for wide-ranging parliamentary reform, which made the family politically and socially unacceptable to most of its contemporaries.<br>
<br>In 1785 Douglas matriculated at the University of Edinburgh, where he was taught by Dugald Stewart and joined &#145;the Club&#146;, an informal association of students that included Walter Scott, William Clerk, Adam Ferguson, and George Abercromby. He entered the undergraduate Speculative Society of Edinburgh in 1789 and was active at its meetings until he left Edinburgh in early April 1791 for revolutionary Paris with his brother-in-law Sir James Hall. Douglas never returned to student life or obtained a degree. If Edinburgh had provided an undergraduate education, Paris provided graduate-level training. Sir James Hall was a well-known scientist with a wide acquaintance among the French <i>philosophes</i>, and Lord Daer was a notorious radical who personally transported Thomas Paine and <span class="italic">The Rights of Man</span> to Britain in 1791. Young Douglas was able to mingle&#151;and even argue informally&#151;with the likes of Condorcet, Brissot de Warville, and du Chastellet. Paris provided him with several exemplary lessons, including the dangers of totally ignoring reform and the possibility of intellectuals also becoming men of action. Throughout the early 1790s he continued to travel, mainly abroad, although he made an eye-opening tour of the highlands of Scotland in 1792. His brother Lord Daer became increasingly involved in radical political agitation and Scottish nationalism, and died in 1794 in Devon, just before repressive action was taken by the government.<br>
<br>With the death of Daer, followed over the next few years by the deaths of his other brothers, Douglas moved inexorably closer to the family title: he became Lord Daer himself in 1797 and the fifth earl of Selkirk in May 1799. That same year saw the publication of his first writing in political economy, an anonymous and untitled pamphlet describing the poor relief system of Galloway as lately reformed under his direction. Little is known of his movements between late 1799 and 1801. In Kirkcudbrightshire he worked to settle the sale of the family estate at Baldoon agreed between his father and Lord Galloway in 1793, which brought a substantial sum to the family coffers. Late in 1801, however, the Roman Catholic vicar-general of the highland district, John Chisholm, informed his superiors in Edinburgh that the earl of Selkirk wanted to discuss matters of importance with him, and in February 1802 Selkirk prepared the draft of a memorial to the British government proposing that he take charge of a plan for Irish Catholics to set up a colony in Louisiana. Selkirk's lifelong involvement with North American colonization had begun.<h2>
<a name="NorthAmericancolonization"></a>North American colonization</h2>The British government found the Louisiana proposal&#151;and a revision proposing to relocate the scheme at the confluence of the waters which fell into Lake Winnipeg and the rivers which drained into Hudson Bay&#151;unacceptable. Selkirk was prepared to change locations, and subsequently offered Upper Canada or Prince Edward Island as well, but was initially more stubborn about the source of his colonists. Lord Hobart, secretary of state for the colonies, suggested that Selkirk shift from Irish to Scottish families, and the earl eventually took up this idea with enthusiasm. Thus was he manoeuvred into the midst of the highland emigration crisis, which was becoming a major public issue in Scotland. Characteristically, he plunged into emigration mania with little thought for the implications of his actions. He was soon in the highlands, especially the Hebrides, actively recruiting settlers. When in late 1802 a number of books and pamphlets began to appear criticizing the highland operations of unscrupulous promoters of North America, Selkirk was a principal target. Matters became more complicated when his negotiations over land concessions with the British government broke down late in 1802, forcing him to buy land in Prince Edward Island on the open market. The passage of parliamentary legislation regulating the emigrant trade in the spring of 1803 was a godsend for Selkirk, for he was the only promoter whose project seemed likely to survive the stringent new laws. He acquired many new recruits as a result. Ultimately Selkirk sent more than 800 highlanders to Prince Edward Island aboard three ships in the spring of 1803, and, as promised, accompanied the party to the island. It proved his only successful colonization venture.<br>
<br>Selkirk spent a month on Prince Edward Island organizing his settlement, and then made a tour of the United States and Upper Canada. Here he still had plans of creating a personal estate, at Baldoon on the Chenail &Eacute;carte, near Windsor, which would, he envisaged, breed the finest possible sheep for North America. He left Baldoon in July 1804, just before the arrival of 102 settlers for the estate. They later experienced a malaria epidemic, and the settlement eventually succumbed to the disruptions of the Anglo-American War. After his return to Britain Selkirk began writing the manuscript that would become <span class="italic">Observations on the Present State of the Highlands of Scotland</span> (1805), his major contribution to political economy and the debate over emigration. In this work he emphasized the illogical self-interest of the various objections against highland emigration to North America, arguing that highlanders were entitled to move to preserve their language, culture, and manners. The hearty applause he received from the reviewers helped him in December 1806 to gain election to the House of Lords as a representative Scottish peer, loosely associated with the reform whigs. Once elected, he continued the family tradition of arguing for reform of the Scottish peerage, with a pamphlet, <span class="italic">A Letter to the Peers of Scotland</span>. He made a sufficient impact upon his contemporaries that the newly installed tory government offered to support him at the general election of 1807. Once re-elected, he shifted his energy to advocating reform of the militia, calling for the establishment of a citizen army under a system of universal military training. On 29 November 1807 he married Jean Wedderburn, the daughter of James Wedderburn (later Wedderburn-Colvile) of Inveresk, a distinguished Scottish lawyer.<br>
<br>In 1808 Selkirk became involved with the noted explorer Sir Alexander Mackenzie in purchasing stock in the Hudson's Bay Company, a process that continued through 1809, the year he published <span class="italic">A Letter Addressed to John Cartwright</span>, disavowing parliamentary reform for its encouragement of popular demagogues and the abuses of the American political system. He was now poised on the verge of the great project and adventure of his life: the establishment of a colony at Red River, the first European settlement in what is now western Canada. As with his previous scheme, Selkirk started by establishing a goal that many thought chimerical, surrounded that goal with well-conceived theoretical justifications, and then proceeded to improvise his way towards its realization. He assumed that his title, status, and connections would make it possible to work within the system and gain its support. This turned out not to be the case.<br>
<br>The Hudson's Bay Company was in serious difficulty by 1809, its shares of stock declining in value on the London market in the face of aggressive competition from its Montreal-based rivals. Selkirk and his merchant brother-in-law Andrew Wedderburn proposed drastic reforms in early 1810, calling initially for profit-sharing with the employees and an orderly inland expansion based upon newly recruited highlanders. A year later Selkirk unveiled his great scheme, by which he would accept a grant of land within the bounds of the company's territories in return for supplying the necessary recruits for expansion. Agents of the North West Company desperately, but unsuccessfully, opposed the grant at the stockholders' meeting and then turned to opposing the recruitment of highlanders in Scotland itself. Nevertheless, the first party, headed by Miles Macdonell, departed in July 1811.<br>
<br>Because of his place in the House of Lords (he was re-elected as a representative peer in 1812) and his position as lord lieutenant of Kirkcudbright (from 1807), Selkirk found it impossible during wartime to cross the Atlantic to lead his people personally, as he had planned. Instead, he sought to take advantage of the worsening military situation in North America for the benefit of both Red River and the British empire, and he proposed to the secretary of war that he should raise and lead a corps modelled on the Canadian fencible regiment. A stipulation added that the men should settle in Red River at the close of service, and their families should be transported there beforehand at government expense. The regiment received cabinet approval, but was eventually rejected by the commander-in-chief, the duke of York. During the months when its acceptance seemed likely, Selkirk had discussed the possibility of recruiting his regiment from among the tenants of the marquess of Stafford in Sutherland, whose lands were being cleared for sheep. Instead, he was forced to transport to Red River families recruited without his consent, on his own account.<br>
<br>The Sutherland settlers, sent to North America beginning in the summer of 1813, put additional pressures upon the limited food supply at the settlement. The potential for conflict between the settlers and the Montreal-based traders of the North West Company who dominated the western fur trade was always high, and was exacerbated by the decision of Selkirk's local governor, Miles Macdonell, to issue on 8 January 1814 a proclamation forbidding the export of provisions from the territory without licence. Open warfare resulted from the subsequent decision of the Hudson's Bay Company to establish a large trading presence in the rich Athabasca territory to compete directly with the Montreal traders. Selkirk was helpless to provide much assistance to his beleaguered settlement, and spent his spare time doing research on the fur trade of North America. This work resulted in the publication in 1816 of <span class="italic">A Sketch of the British Fur Trade in North America</span>, a systematic exposure of the abuse of the aboriginal peoples of the west by the North West Company, based chiefly on Hudson's Bay Company documents. Selkirk's health remained precarious, with increasing signs of consumption.<br>
<br>After the end of the wars in Europe and America, Selkirk and his family planned to visit America, and departed in September 1815. In the meantime, earlier in the year and unbeknown to Selkirk, the Nor'Westers (agents of the North West Company), with a mixture of threats and promises, convinced many of Selkirk's settlers to move to Upper Canada with the canoe brigades. In the wake of this disaster Miles Macdonell was replaced as governor by Robert Semple. In Montreal, Selkirk was unable to gain any military protection from the government for the Red River settlement, and he decided to recruit a small mobile force of well-armed and well-disciplined men from among the disbanded De Meuron regiment of Swiss mercenaries. With a large party of these mercenaries, Selkirk started west for Fort William (the North West Company's headquarters on the western shore of Lake Superior) in July 1816. <i>En route</i>, he learned that Governor Semple and twenty-one settlers had been killed by a party of mixed-race men at Seven Oaks on 19 June 1816. The Selkirk party hastened to Fort William and captured it easily. Selkirk arrested the leading partners, who happened to be present for the annual company meeting, and shipped them east for trial. But he then proceeded to make one of the great blunders of his life: he purchased all the furs held in Fort William from one of the more vulnerable North West Company partners for a pittance, and thus exposed himself to charges of personal profiteering.<br>
<br>Despite the successful seizure of Fort William, the forces arrayed against Selkirk grew in confidence, particularly when the governments in Canada and in London agreed that none of the various parties to the fur trade war in the west was entitled to claim any moral advantage in the controversy. A considerable pamphlet war, in which Selkirk was worsted, erupted in Montreal, Toronto, and London in late 1816 and 1817. Selkirk's forces recaptured Red River early in 1817, while he wintered at Fort William. He finally arrived at his settlement in the spring of 1817. Meanwhile, the colonial secretary, Lord Bathurst, angrily ordered the governor of Lower Canada, Sir John Sherbrooke, to arrest Selkirk. Sherbrooke had already appointed an investigating commission headed by W. B. Coltman, which arrived at Red River on 1 July 1817. Coltman's approach was to regard all parties involved as equally culpable, a position that Selkirk abhorred, since he regarded his settlers as innocent victims of North West Company aggression. If Selkirk did not succeed in gaining the support of Coltman, whose published report did indeed blame everyone, he did manage to put his settlement back on its feet before heading south on horseback in September 1817. His decision to return east via the United States was prudent, given the hostility to him in many parts of Canada: he arrived back in York, Upper Canada, in January 1818.<br>
<br>Selkirk spent the next few months embroiled in legal complications in the Canadian courts, his health continually deteriorating through the ensuing period of turmoil. He had remained in remarkably good health during his time in the western outdoors, but this condition did not long survive his return to the east. He was unable to vindicate his position in the courts, and was not re-elected to the House of Lords in 1818 despite government support, ostensibly because of his prolonged absence in America. He returned to Britain late in 1818, and, despite increasing illness, spent long hours at his desk preparing a series of statements outlining his interpretation of events in North America and defending his conduct. Because of his death most of these explanations were not published at the time, and have appeared in print only a century and a half later. Some contemporary breakthrough did occur in his favour when his brother-in-law Sir James Montgomery called successfully in the House of Commons in June 1819 for the tabling of the relevant Colonial Office documents of the Red River settlement. The papers were printed within weeks and made clear that the North West Company had indeed criminally conspired against Selkirk's settlement, as he had always claimed. On doctor's orders he headed for southern Europe in September 1819, and had reached as far as the town of Pau in the foothills of the Pyrenees when the languor of ill health forced him to stop. He died there on 8 April 1820, and was buried in the protestant cemetery at Orthez. Although his efforts to vindicate his name were largely unsuccessful in his lifetime, Selkirk has since become a mythical figure in the development of the Canadian west and a prophet of western agricultural settlement.<br>
