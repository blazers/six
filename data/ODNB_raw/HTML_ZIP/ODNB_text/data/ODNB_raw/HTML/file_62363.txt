<span class="headword">Pickering,  Lewis</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1571), <span class="occ">courtier and convicted seditious libeller</span>, was baptized in February 1571, the son of John Pickering of Tichmarsh, Northamptonshire, and his second wife, Ursula. He matriculated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1587, but apparently left without a degree before entering Gray's Inn in 1592. Emmanuel was a cradle of puritanism, and whatever religious sentiments Pickering acquired there were undoubtedly reinforced at his inn, a favoured haunt of Northamptonshire's godly.<br>
<br>Upon Elizabeth I's death in 1603, and presumably with the backing of weightier figures in Northamptonshire or in other puritan circles, Pickering headed for Scotland, where, he later claimed, he was the first to give James &#145;intelligence that he was proclaymed &amp; generallie accepted as Kinge of England&#146;  (Cecil MSS, 192, fol. 18). Trusted by James and welcomed into the royal entourage, Pickering tried to use his good fortune to aid the cause of further reformation in the English church. For the first two years of the new reign Pickering, along with the Scot Patrick Galloway, was a key point of contact at court for the revived puritan movement, acting as a conduit for strategic news, reformist schemes, and godly petitioning. Early in 1605, however, as puritan optimism began to fade in the face of James I's studiously moderate ecclesiastical policy, Pickering's brief court career came to a catastrophic end. In February, Thomas Bywater, a fellow puritan, named Pickering as the author of a bitter verse libel, &#145;The Lamentation of Dickie for the Death of Jockie&#146;, that had been pinned to the hearse of the late archbishop of Canterbury, John Whitgift, in March 1604. Although he denied writing it, Pickering was prosecuted in Star Chamber in May 1605 for seditious libel.<br>
<br>Pickering's conviction was as much a political as a legal necessity. By tarring a relatively prominent puritan with sedition, the authorities could powerfully demonstrate what they repeatedly asserted: that puritan resistance to royal ecclesiastical policy was politically subversive. To secure this highly useful conviction, Attorney-General Sir Edward Coke was forced, in part by Pickering's defence and in part by these political exigencies, to clarify and reformulate seditious libel law. Coke's reformulations made the Pickering case a major legal precedent, establishing that the dead could be libelled, that truth was no defence, and that attacks on royal ministers constituted seditious assaults on royal authority. Pickering was sentenced to a year in prison and a &pound;1000 fine. He was to be pilloried in London, Croydon, and Northampton, and, if he refused to confess, to have his ears nailed to the pillory. Pickering was pilloried at least once, though it is not known whether he was mutilated, and he was imprisoned until late in the year, when he was released and his fine excused. Shortly afterwards, Pickering signed a paper recanting his puritan views: he acknowledged the legitimacy of the ceremonies mandated by the church and accepted the crown's right to deprive those clergy who refused to do likewise.<br>
<br>At the time of his arrest, Pickering was engaged to marry a Mrs Russell, a widow in the countess of Bedford's service. Whether his marriage plans survived his disgrace is unknown, as is the date of his death.<br>
