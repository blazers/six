<span class="headword">Clerke,  Henry</span>  (1621/2?&#150;1687), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was one of several children of Thomas Clerke (1580&#150;1663) of Willoughby, Warwickshire. He matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, in 1638, when his age was entered as sixteen, and spent the remainder of his life within Magdalen College, where he obtained a demyship, graduated BA in 1641, and proceeded MA in 1644. From 1642 to 1667 he held a fellowship, submitting to the parliamentary visitors' examination in 1648 and having no trouble retaining his position in 1660 when the surviving expelled fellows returned. He was reader in logic in 1643, bursar in 1653, 1656, and 1662, and vice-president in 1655 and again in 1663.<br>
<br>Clerke was created BM in January 1648, admitted to practise medicine the following February, and took the MD by accumulation in 1652, being incorporated in Cambridge in 1673. From 1652 to 1671 he deputized for William Petty as Tomlins reader in anatomy. He was admitted a candidate of the College of Physicians in 1658 and elected fellow in 1669. Clerke was one of the group of virtuoso-physicians who gathered at Petty's house from 1649 and, after his departure, at John Wilkins's lodgings at Wadham College, to perform dissections and discuss apothecary matters and other scientific topics. John Evelyn, Henry Oldenburg, and Robert Boyle were among their visitors. In 1657 the group migrated to Boyle's house where they had access to his scientific apparatus. Clerke was an early member of the Royal Society, and the first from Magdalen, being elected on 24 October 1667, but he paid his subscription only for 1667&#150;9 and played no part in its London meetings.<br>
<br>Following the death of Thomas Pierce, president of Magdalen College, Clerke was elected in his place on 5 March 1672, and in order to fully qualify for the office he soon afterwards took holy orders. He was appointed vice-chancellor on 9 October 1676. He married, probably in the 1660s, Catherine (1635/6&#150;1669), fourth daughter of William Adams of Charwelton, Northamptonshire. They had a son, Henry, who died in the same year as his mother, and a daughter, Catherine, known around the college as the Infanta, possibly because of the haughty air she adopted as the president's daughter. She married in 1682 Richard Shuttleworth (1666&#150;1687) of Gawthrop (or Gawthorpe) Hall, near Burnley, Lancashire, at that time a gentleman commoner of Trinity College and considerably younger than his wife&#151;he was still in his minority at the time of his father-in-law's death, by which time they had three children. In the summer of 1685 Clerke went on a tour of Yorkshire with his daughter and son-in-law, calling on the way back at Willoughby and Nottingham.<br>
<br>Clerke died at Gawthrop Hall on 24 March 1687, allegedly aged sixty-eight, and on 9 April was buried with his ancestors at Willoughby. He left the furniture and linen in his college lodgings to one of his sisters and her daughter, who may have been looking after him there. He made generous bequests to his immediate family, part of this to come from the sale of his books; to his college the sum of &pound;50 to buy a gilded bowl and cover to be placed on the altar; and lesser sums to various parishes. The college erected and subsequently restored a monument in the church at Willoughby commemorating him as a great benefactor.<br>
