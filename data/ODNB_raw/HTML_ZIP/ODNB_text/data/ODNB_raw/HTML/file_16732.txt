<span class="headword">Linley,  George</span>  (1798&#150;1865), <span class="occ">poet and songwriter</span>, was born at Briggate, Leeds, and baptized on 7 February 1798, at St Peter's Church, Leeds, a younger son of James Linley (1764&#150;1812), a tin plate worker, and his wife, Ann (1769&#150;1839), whose maiden name was possibly Townsley. He was educated first by Joshua Eastburn, a Quaker, then at Leeds grammar school; by the age of sixteen he was an ensign in the 3rd West Yorkshire militia. His service took him to Doncaster and Dublin. He had stirred up antagonistic feelings in Leeds by attacking local dignitaries in lampooning verses in the <span class="italic">Leeds Intelligencer</span>, and &#145;bolted to London in a huff&#146;  (Spark, &#145;God bless&#146;). On 4 April 1824, at St Cuthbert's Church in Edinburgh, he married Violet, the youngest daughter of the orientalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10716/', "Dr John Borthwick Gilchrist (1759&#150;1841)")</script>. About 1826 he was reported to be a partner in a mercantile firm in Leith, but he soon returned to London. He and his wife had at least four children, three of whom were christened there: Julia (<i>bap</i>. 1832), Mary Ann (<i>bap</i>. 1834), and Violet Olivia (<i>bap</i>. 1837). He also had at least one son, <a href="#cosubject_16732">George [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>Once established in London, Linley proved that he was, in his own words, &#145;addicted to poetry&#146;  (Spark, &#145;God bless&#146;), by his prolific outpouring of song lyrics, hymns, ballads, musical arrangements of nursery rhymes and folk-songs, and more ambitiously, operatic works, for which he sometimes wrote both words and music. He wrote the lyrics and/or music of several hundred songs between 1830 and 1865. Many of these had considerable contemporary popularity: his obituarist in the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span> (29 September 1865) gives particular mention to &#145;Thou art gone from my gaze&#146;, &#145;Ever of thee&#146;, and &#145;Little Nell&#146;. These works are marked by a pronounced sentimentality, somewhat at odds with the aggressively satirical tone of Linley's other poetical works, <span class="italic">Musical Cynics of London</span> (1862; reprinted 1862) and <span class="italic">The Modern Hudibras</span> (1864; enlarged edn, 1864). In the former work he interpolates prose passages among the heroic couplets; a main target of his satire is Henry Fothergill Chorley, music critic of <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>. Linley was unrepentant that some people had &#145;hinted at an undue severity&#146; towards Chorley: he refers to the &#145;malignant ravings&#146; of Chorley, defending his poem as &#145;retributive justice&#146;  (Preface, 2nd edn). <span class="italic">The Modern Hudibras</span> is more wide-ranging in its satirical attacks&#151;including references to his native Yorkshire. Both poems are characterized by awkward rhymes and laboured movement, and Linley's attempts at grander musical forms were no more successful. His first such undertaking was to write the music and songs for <span class="italic">Francesca Doria</span> which was produced on 3 March 1849 at the Princess's Theatre, London. This was followed by <span class="italic">The Toymaker</span> (1861), an adaptation of Adams' <span class="italic">La poup&eacute;e de Nuremberg</span>, performed at Covent Garden Theatre on 19 November. <span class="italic">Law versus Love</span>, a one-act comedietta, was performed at the Princess's Theatre on 6 December 1862. Linley also wrote a number of librettos, including that for Balfe's <span class="italic">Catherine Grey</span>, the first English opera without spoken dialogue. Most of this material, however, has been relegated to the realms of musical history. Perhaps the most enduring of Linley's compositions was the song &#145;God Bless the Prince of Wales&#146;; he is said to have suggested ideas for the musical setting to its composer, Henry Brinley Richards. Richards earned &pound;100 for the composition, from which sum &pound;10 was given to Linley. Linley appears to have had no musical training and thus the limited nature of his achievements may be viewed with greater tolerance.<br>
<br>Linley died at his home, Alfred Cottage, Victoria Road, Kensington, after prolonged illness, on 10 September 1865 and was buried on 15 September at Kensal Green cemetery. He was survived by his wife. His son <a name="cosubject_16732"></a><span class="headword">George Linley</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1834, <em>d.</em> 1869), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was baptized on 29 September 1834 at St Phillip's, Birmingham. He followed in his father's footsteps as an aspiring poet. He published <span class="italic">The Goldseeker and other Poems</span> (1860), based on his travels in Australia, and dedicated to the duke of Argyll, and <span class="italic">Old Saws Newly Set</span> (1864), a collection of fables. On 4 October 1862 he married Emma, the younger sister of Sims Reeves, singer. He died on 28 April 1869, aged thirty-three.<br>
