<span class="headword">Nugent,  Thomas</span>, first Baron Nugent of Riverston  (<em>d.</em> 1715), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20398/', "Richard Nugent, second earl of Westmeath (1626&#150;1684)")</script>, army officer, and his wife, Mary (1623&#150;1672), daughter of Sir Thomas Nugent, bt, of Moyrath, Westmeath. Born into a prominent Old English family with a strong legal tradition, he was domiciled at Clonyn, Westmeath, when he entered the Inner Temple in 1669; he was admitted to King's Inns in Dublin on 21 November 1674 and practised as a barrister. In 1680 (probably in September) he married a member of another leading Old English family, Marianna (1662&#150;1735), daughter of Henry Barnewall, second Viscount Barnewall of Kingsland. They had several daughters and two sons.<br>
<br>After the accession of James II, Nugent was one of a number of Catholic barristers to become king's counsel (12 September 1685). The second earl of Clarendon, who came to Ireland as viceroy in January 1686, treated him as a representative of the Roman Catholic interest. When Nugent was made a judge of the king's bench (23 April 1686), Clarendon wrote of his being &#145;a man of birth indeed &hellip; but no lawyer, and so will do harm upon the account of his learning&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.356). On taking his seat he was reported by Clarendon to have had a wrangle with another judge, Sir John Lyndon, about precedence, &#145;as brisk as if it had been between two women&#146;  (ibid.). In May 1686 he was appointed to the Irish privy council, and in October of the following year, with Tyrconnell now lord lieutenant, he was made chief justice of the king's bench. The court of king's bench under his tenure was regarded by William King and others as promoting the Catholic interest at the expense of protestants. He was alleged to have declared it treasonous to possess weapons without licence, when in fact a fine of &pound;20 was the highest penalty prescribed by law. On another occasion he was said by William King to have declared the robbery of protestants to be necessary for the furtherance of James II's policy. Clarendon recorded some instances of what he saw as judicial partiality, though he admitted that Nugent had shown humanity in a particular case.<br>
<br>Early in 1688, with the king's approval, Tyrconnell sent Nugent to England with Chief Baron Rice carrying alternative draft bills for the modification of the Restoration land settlement. According to William King, they were met in London by a hostile mob who escorted them with potatoes fixed on sticks, amid cries of &#145;make room for the Irish ambassadors&#146;  (King, chap. 3, section 12, 2). They returned to Ireland in April with a draft bill of settlement. Preparations for an Irish parliament were soon under way, but events in England intervened and by August the calling of an Irish parliament had been indefinitely postponed.<br>
<br>Nugent's response to William of Orange's intervention in England was robust. In a charge to the Dublin grand jury he was said to have expressed a hope that William's followers would soon be &#145;hung up all over England&#146; in &#145;bunches like a rope of onions&#146;  (Ingram, 43). Holding the assizes at Cork in March 1689 he ordered the protestant people of Bandon, who had declared for William III and attacked the Jacobite garrison on 22 February, to be indicted for high treason, but he was persuaded by General Justin MacCarthy into respecting Bandon's capitulation. After James II had landed at Kinsale on 12 March 1689 he consulted Nugent in the presence of both Avaux and Melfort.<br>
<br>With a parliament summoned for May, James signed a warrant on 3 April 1689 for a writ of summons to Nugent to sit in the House of Lords as Baron Nugent of Riverston, one of the rare occasions when a writ of summons created a hereditary peerage by express words. On 13 May, six days after the opening of parliament, Nugent introduced a bill for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Restoration Acts of Settlement and Explanation</span>, a far more sweeping measure than the draft bill he had brought back from London the previous year. He was generally active in the House of Lords, frequently presiding at committees. On 6 July, two weeks before parliament was prorogued, he was appointed a commissioner of the Irish Treasury (renewed 17 June 1690), and he continued to sit on the bench, taking the spring assizes in Connaught in 1690. He was at Limerick during or soon after William's abortive siege, and in September 1690 he was appointed to act as secretary for war when Sir Richard Nagle travelled to France with Tyrconnell for consultations. During Tyrconnell's absence Nugent was dismissed from office by Berwick acting under Sarsfield's influence, though he was soon restored by Tyrconnell on his return in January 1691. Regarded as a personal adherent of the Jacobite viceroy, he was accused by the anti-peace party of holding secret and treasonable communication with the Williamites. After Tyrconnell's death in August 1691 he seems to have played no significant part in the negotiations that led to the treaty of Limerick (3 October 1691), though he was covered by its terms, retained his estates, and was granted a licence to carry arms&#151;all of which suggests that he was not regarded with particular animosity in post-war protestant Ireland, despite the antagonism he had aroused as a judge in the later 1680s.<br>
<br>With the war over, Nugent's public career was at an end. Although his barony was treated as invalid by the Williamite authorities, both he and his sons who succeeded him were referred to as Baron Nugent of Riverston. When he died in May 1715 he was succeeded by his elder son, Richard Hyacinth Nugent (<i>d</i>. 1738), who in turn was succeeded by his younger brother, William (<i>d</i>. 1756). The title was merged with the earldom of Westmeath in 1839.<br>
