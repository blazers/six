<span class="headword">Paulet, Lord  William</span>  (1804&#150;1893), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, fourth son of Charles Ingoldsby Paulet, thirteenth marquess of Winchester (1764&#150;1843), and his wife, Anne (1773&#150;1841), second daughter of John Andrews of Shotney Hall, Northumberland, was born at Amport House, Andover, Hampshire, on 7 July 1804. After attending Eton College (his name appears in the school lists of 1820), he was appointed ensign in the 85th (Duke of York's Own) light infantry on 1 February 1821. On 23 August 1822 he was made lieutenant in the 7th Royal Fusiliers; he purchased an unattached company on 12 February 1825 and exchanged to the 21st Royal North British Fusiliers. On 10 September 1830 he became major 68th (Durham) regiment of light infantry, and lieutenant-colonel on 21 April 1843, serving with the regiment at Gibraltar, in the West Indies, North America, and at home until 31 December 1848, when he exchanged to half pay unattached. He became brevet colonel on 20 June 1854, went to the Crimea as assistant adjutant-general of the cavalry division, under Lord Lucan, and was present at the Alma, Balaklava (where his hat was carried off by roundshot), Inkerman, and Sevastopol. On 23 November 1854 Lord Raglan appointed him to command &#145;on the Bosporus, at Gallipoli, and the Dardanelles&#146;, where the overcrowded hospitals, in which Florence Nightingale and her nurses had begun work three weeks before, needed an experienced officer in overall command. This post he held until after the fall of Sevastopol, when he succeeded to the command of the light division in the Crimea, which he retained until the allied evacuation. He was created CB (July 1855), the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and the order of the Mejidiye (third class).<br>
<br>Paulet was one of the first officers appointed to a command at Aldershot camp, where he commanded the 1st brigade from 1856 to 1860, becoming a major-general on 13 June 1858. He commanded the south-western district, with headquarters at Portsmouth, from 1860 to 1865. He was made KCB in 1865, and a lieutenant-general on 8 December 1867; he was adjutant-general of the forces from 1865 to 1870, and was made GCB in 1870, general on 7 October 1874, and field marshal on 10 July 1886. After a short period as colonel 87th Royal Irish Fusiliers, Paulet was appointed, on 9 April 1864, colonel of his former regiment, the 68th, in the interest of which he never ceased to exert his influence. He died, unmarried, at his London residence, 18 St James's Square, Westminster, on 9 May 1893.<br>
