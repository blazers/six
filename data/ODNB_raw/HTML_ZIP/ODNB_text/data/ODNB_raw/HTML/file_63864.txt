<span class="headword">Hale,  Cicely Bertha</span>  (1884&#150;1981), <span class="occ">suffragette and health visitor</span>, was born on 5 September 1884 at 8 Sussex Gardens, Paddington, London, the youngest of the five surviving children of Charles Douglas Bowdich Hale (1850&#150;1927), a general practitioner, and his wife, Bertha Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Poole (1840&#150;1937). When Cicely was seven the family moved to a large house in Sussex Place near by. A timid child, she felt inadequate and unloved, and was close only to her protective next sister, Betsy. Taught by their mother, then by governesses, in their late teens the girls were sent to the ladies' department of King's College in Kensington, headed by Lilian Faithfull. They also attended &#145;the Gym&#146; run by the Misses Bear, where fellow students included several princesses. Because Dr Hale had treated high school girls whose health had allegedly suffered from overwork, he forbade his daughters to undertake more than four hours of classes a day. Despite a broad cultural education, including theatregoing and continental travel, Cicely Hale always felt disadvantaged by her lack of formal schooling. She resented having to wait on her brothers as a child, and in later life she came to resent the way the daughters' education was thought less important than the sons'.<br>
<br>Hale trained as a secretary and, after an uncongenial first post, went in 1908 as assistant to Mary Home in the information department of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), the result of hearing Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst speak in Hyde Park. There she provided a news-cutting and research service, learned to typeset <span class="italic">The Suffragette</span>, and, in 1912, took charge of the department. Though she experienced many police raids, she was never arrested. Concern for her father's reputation restrained her militancy, so that she felt guilty at having given less than her colleagues.<br>
<br>After the outbreak of the First World War, Hale continued to typeset <span class="italic">The Suffragette</span> (renamed <span class="italic">The Britannia</span>) until 1916 when her father's retirement deprived her of both home and allowance. Her experience in the WSPU greatly boosted her self-confidence. Recognizing that without qualifications she could not obtain interesting work or a reasonable salary, she decided to study for the health visitor's certificate of the Royal Sanitary Institute (training at the Infant Welfare Clinic at Salisbury Street, Marylebone) and the certificate of the Central Midwives' Board (at the General Lying-In Hospital in York Road, Waterloo, and in Camberwell). She partly financed her studies by acting as Dr Christine Murrell's secretary.<br>
<br>After six months at the maternity almoners' office at the London Hospital in Whitechapel, working with Russian and Polish Jewish mothers, Hale returned to the Salisbury Street clinic as health visitor superintendent, a post she held for sixteen years. As a sideline she answered letters from customers of Glaxo Laboratories about their baby products. In 1918 she rented rooms in Ormonde Terrace, facing Primrose Hill, where, in 1920, Ann Campbell moved next door. Campbell, a pioneer policewoman who became chief inspector of the Women's Auxiliary Police Service, shared her life for twenty years. They lived together in a flat in Dorset Square, Marylebone, holidaying abroad every year.<br>
<br>In 1934 Hale moved to a health visitor's post in Littlehampton to be nearer her mother; on her mother's death, in 1937, she returned to London. From the Holland Park flat she shared with Campbell she conducted the &#145;Baby circle&#146; for the <span class="italic">Woman's Own</span>, writing a weekly column and answering an enormous correspondence. When war broke out, Hale and Campbell moved to Oxford, where Campbell died in 1941. To fill the gap in her life, Hale wrote <span class="italic">Can I Help you with Baby?</span>, which went into three editions. She returned to London in 1943, but took a flat in Littlehampton in 1944 and lived there half the week. When a new management took the <span class="italic">Woman's Own</span> up-market she gave up the &#145;Baby circle&#146; after nine years and retired to Littlehampton in 1946.<br>
<br>In 1947 Hale met Mary Cuningham Chater (1896&#150;1990), music adviser to the Girl Guides Association, and began a new career. As division secretary to the Arun Valley Guides, she helped to assemble the <span class="roman">International Song Books</span>, ran a Brownie pack, and experienced camping for the first time, acting as camp nurse for three summers. She finally retired in 1968, aged eighty-four. She shared Mary Chater's home in St Winefride's Road, Littlehampton, from 1950 to 1965, when they took adjoining flats on South Terrace. At her death she was living at Kenwith, St Winefride's Road.<br>
<br>After the publication of her memoir <span class="italic">A Good Long Time</span> (1975), Hale found herself in demand, as one of the few suffragettes still alive, as a speaker in schools, on radio, and on television. In the book she emerges as a person of progressive views, a tolerant, interested observer of society, whose self-esteem, damaged in childhood, had been amply repaired by professional and personal fulfilment. The pages reveal no sense of irony or self-consciousness that her life's work consisted in advising others about things she had not herself experienced, or that she lived with women rather than husband and children.<br>
<br>Cicely Hale died on 28 May 1981 of pneumonia and lung abscesses at 43 Glenville Road, Rustingdon, Sussex, after a &#145;good long&#146; life of ninety-six years. Her obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> noted that &#145;Her courage, kindness and enterprise made her a delightful friend and a much loved aunt of numerous nephews and nieces of three generations&#146;.<br>
