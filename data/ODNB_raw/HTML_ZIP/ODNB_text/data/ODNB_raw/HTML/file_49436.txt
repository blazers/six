<span class="headword">Copland,  Alexander</span>  (1774&#150;1834), <span class="occ">building contractor</span>, was born on 14 May 1774, in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, the only surviving son of Alexander Copland (1736&#150;1793), builder, and his wife, Barbara (1734&#150;17901), daughter of Richard Smirke of Wigton, Cumberland&#151;probably the grandfather of the architect and artist Robert Smirke (1781&#150;1867)&#151;and widow of Richard McCartney.<br>
<br>Copland was educated at a school at Sowerby, near Thirsk, Yorkshire, and in November 1784 bound as an apprentice to Richard Holland, surveyor, at the Stationers' Company. He entered the Royal Academy Schools in November 1788. Apart from small legacies, his father bequeathed him all his leasehold and personal estate, said by Smirke to be worth &pound;10,000. Copland was admitted to the freedom of the Stationers' Company on 5 April 1796, and on 30 April married Lucy (<i>d</i>. 1849), only daughter of William Giffard of Turnham Green, Middlesex. They had three sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Copland's significance lies in his being the earliest of the great building contractors. He was called on to build barracks, often in country areas, with great rapidity, and based his operations in London, where he largely recruited a workforce of hundreds of men of all trades&#151;though never more men on a site than could work to advantage&#151;whom he supplied with tools, in contrast to the tradition by which the artisan supplied his own. He enforced a new degree of labour discipline, ascribing his success in completing work on schedule to his having &#145;always employed a great many more Superintending Clerks and Foremen than is usual for the number of men, in order to compel the workmen to do their duty&#146;  (&#145;Commissioners of military inquiry&#146;, 2.47).<br>
<br>Copland's career progressed through personal contacts. His brother-in-law, Henry Hemsley, a surveyor in the barrack office, gave the crucial impetus when in 1796 he asked him to supply prefabricated barrack buildings for the West Indies. The government then decided, in view of the war with revolutionary France, to build temporary wooden barracks throughout the country, and in August 1796 Copland was employed to build one at Chelmsford, Essex, for 2400 men, in only five weeks. He built another in three weeks at Weymouth for 300 cavalry and officers, prior to the king's visit in 1798. Thereafter he was extensively employed by the barrack-master-general in the Isle of Wight, 1798&#150;1802, where he employed 700 men; in the Channel Islands (1799, for Russian troops evacuated from Holland); and in Weeley (Essex), Winchester, and elsewhere. In all, by 1805 a total of twenty-six barracks at a charge of &pound;1,464,629, were executed by Copland's own firm, save for about &pound;4000 of stonework on the prestigious Windsor barracks.<br>
<br>These barracks were contracted for on the basis of &#145;measure and valuation&#146;. So generous were the valuations of the barrack office surveyors that Copland was able to make very large profits; an independent valuation of his Silverhill bill in 1805, allowing a 15 per cent profit margin, reduced it by 48 per cent. Copland's work at Radipole, Dorset, in 1804, was attacked as &#145;a most glaring instance of imposition&#146;  (&#145;Commissioners of military inquiry&#146;, 2.52). The rubble foundation of the stables employed mortar made of muddy sand without a proper proportion of lime; repairs estimated at &pound;2600 were required within the year, &#145;which could not have been the case, had the Builder performed his Contract with common honesty&#146;  (&#145;Commissioners of military inquiry&#146;, 2.52).<br>
<br>Barrack building, however, was by no means his only activity. John Sanders of the barrack office was architect of two major contracts, for the Duke of York's Asylum, Chelsea (1801&#150;03), and for the Royal Military College, Sandhurst (1807&#150;12), and probably also of a third, the guard house in Hyde Park (1798). The first of these contracts no doubt brought Copland into personal touch with the duke of York, whose town house in Piccadilly, mortgaged to the banker Coutts, he proposed in 1801 to develop as a residential hotel. Eventually Copland paid &pound;37,000 in instalments in 1802&#150;5 to become absolute purchaser of York House. In association with the architect Henry Holland (cousin of Richard), and Holland's nephew, the builder Henry Rowles, Copland converted it into residential chambers known as Albany, erecting also two parallel rows of chambers in the gardens, the first purpose-built residential apartments of their kind.<br>
<br>In addition, like his father, Copland built houses for the upper end of the London market. From at least 1799 he was also a timber merchant, and about 1806 entered into partnership in that trade with Rowles. In 1807 and 1808 Copland built houses which were let at from &pound;102 to &pound;150 per annum on Rowles's Upper Cadogan Place estate, subsequently selling them on. He also worked on Covent Garden theatre (1809), designed by his cousin, Sir Robert Smirke (but not, as often claimed, on the great hall of Christ's Hospital, where he merely, as a governor, served on the responsible committee).<br>
<br>Copland leased building sites from Rowles, and from about 1811 joined him in exploiting Westminster Abbey's Tothill Fields estate; in 1827 and again very shortly before his death he invested over &pound;2000 in leases in the neighbourhood of Vincent Square, but probably as a land speculation rather than for building, for both men had retired from contracting by 1821. Their firm (sometimes including the name of Holland), nevertheless continued at Narrow-wall (later Belvedere Road), Lambeth, until Copland's death. By 1808 Copland had acquired, in addition to his residence and premises at 67 St Martin's Lane, a yard in Horseferry Road, Westminster, to which he soon added others in Millbank, on the river. The latter he gave up when in 1812&#151;the year in which he also moved from St Martin's Lane to Great George Street&#151;he established workshops and a house on a 10,000 square yard site in Horseferry Road, which contained also sawpits and brickworks.<br>
<br>Copland also appears in an 1817 list of architects practising in London, but his only known work is the ornate thatched cottage of 1818 &#145;in the Elizabethan style, built after the manner of one at Virginia Water belonging to &hellip; George IV&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Letters of Captain Marryat</span>, 2.130), on his Langham estate, Norfolk, in the planning of which he was assisted by his son Frank, then a pupil in the office of Sir John Soane (1753&#150;1837). His library was sold at Sothebys in 1837.<br>
<br>Copland, handsome and self-confident, early used his profits in adopting an aristocratic manner of life, with country seat and town house; he entertained extensively, rode to hounds, and sent his three sons to Eton. In 1801 he purchased for &pound;10,000 the bulk (some 76 acres) of the estate at Gunnersbury, Middlesex, formerly the property of Princess Amelia. He immediately erected a house, enlarged in 1816, where pastimes included cricket and archery. In 1810 he bought a 1000 acre estate at Langham, Norfolk, which in June 1830 he exchanged for Sussex House, Hammersmith, the property of his old friend Captain Marryat, the novelist. He moved in 1812 from St Martin's Lane to a large house, 29 Great George Street, Westminster (subsequently the National Portrait Gallery), where, despite frequent attacks of gout, he entertained liberally, culminating in 1832 in a grand ball.<br>
<br>Almost as soon as the continent was open to English travellers, in September&#150;October 1814 Copland toured northern France and Belgium. In 1819 he took his family and two servants on a four-month tour of Wales, the Lakes, Scotland, and north-east England, bearing introductions to several noblemen. In 1820&#150;22 he sent his eldest son on an unusually comprehensive European tour, and a family tour in three carriages, accompanied by three servants, through France and Switzerland to Italy, followed between August 1823 and May 1824. Copland was a magistrate for Middlesex but in 1820 paid a fine rather than serve as sheriff of London. On his eldest son's marriage in 1826 he settled &pound;300 a year on him and gave a reception for 350 guests. To a younger son he advanced &pound;6000 to purchase a commission in the Queen's Bays. Copland was also a generous benefactor to hospitals, being elected treasurer of the Charing Cross Hospital.<br>
<br>His children's travel diaries show Copland to have been keenly interested in the works of both man and nature, alike enthusiastic about visiting Crawshay's Welsh ironworks, Smirke's new Lowther Castle, and Staffa's caves. He was, too, a committed family man, keen that wife and children share such experiences, and visiting his mother's birthplace to enquire into her family. Copland died in his Westminster house, 29 Great George Street, on 12 July 1834, and was buried in the chancel vault of St Martin-in-the-Fields.<br>
