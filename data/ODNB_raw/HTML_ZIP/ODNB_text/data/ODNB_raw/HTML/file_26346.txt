<span class="headword">Steele,  Richard</span>  (1629&#150;1692), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister</span>, was born at Claycroft in Barthomley, Cheshire, on 10 May 1629, the son of Robert Steele, a local husbandman. He was educated at Northwich grammar school and went up to Cambridge in 1642, matriculating as a sizar from St John's College on 1 April. Steele graduated BA in 1650 and proceeded MA in 1651. He later moved from Cambridge to Oxford, becoming the chaplain of Corpus Christi College, and in July 1656 was incorporated MA at Oxford.<br>
<br>A supporter of parliament's cause during the civil wars, Steele was made an assistant to the parliamentary commission for north Wales in 1654. He was admitted to the living of Hanmer in Flintshire on 21 June 1654, but as Henry Newcome visited him there on 10 June of that year it is probable that he was administering to the congregation at an earlier date. Steele believed in the unity of the church and was a presbyterian in practice, associating his parish with the fourth Shropshire classical presbytery. Although the classis system, instituted by act of parliament in 1647, was generally stillborn in the country, the Shropshire classis was active, and Steele was among the presbyters of the classis who ordained the minister and diarist Philip Henry on 16 September 1657. Steele and Henry would be lifelong friends, and Steele's belief in the validity of the presbyterian system of ordination is shown by the ordination of Henry's son, Matthew, at Steele's house in London in May 1687, twenty-seven years after the Restoration abolished the parliamentarian classis system.<br>
<br>Steele was an early sufferer from the conservative backlash that occurred with the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. In September of that year he was presented before the Flint assizes with Philip Henry for not reading the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> but was saved by the terms of the king's declaration of Breda from further prosecution. He was again before the court in March 1661 for the same offence. The decision of the bishops to re-establish the Church of England on exclusive grounds meant that Steele, like most moderate presbyterians, could not subscribe and so he chose to resign his living in August 1662. On 17 August he preached his farewell sermon as a minister of the Church of England against the intolerable situation that subscription to the (as yet uncirculated) prayer book placed him in. However, he did not separate from the Church of England and still took communion at Hanmer. This he did in the pre-civil war tradition of sitting, refusing to take the sacrament in the &#145;idolatrous&#146; kneeling position. Steele and Philip Henry were again arrested and briefly imprisoned in October 1663, on suspicion of treason. Steele had a brief sojourn in London in August 1664, where he preached to a meeting at the Golden Goat in Cheapside. However, he returned to Flintshire in 1665 and in April was again arrested. The authorities seized his diary, and Calamy contends that they misread passages to smear Steele's name, taking a reference to &#145;a carnal account&#146; to be &#145;some woman design&#146;. This act seems to have been successful &#145;to his great reproach and injury&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.708).<br>
<br>With the imposition of the <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span> in 1666 Steele was forced to move away from Hanmer, and lived in or near the town of Betley in Staffordshire. By 1672 he was living in London and was licensed during the indulgence as a presbyterian at Westmoreland House. He supported the indulgence and acted as an agent for his former friends and colleagues in the west, obtaining licences for them in London whether they requested it or not. Although Steele still had connections in his home town of Barthomley, he used his time in London for the profit of nonconformity, preaching to a morning gathering at Armourers' Hall in Coleman Street and to an afternoon congregation in Hoxton. He remained in London, moving to a meeting at Bartholomew Close by 1678, and was fined &pound;20 in April 1683 by the Guildhall sessions for preaching to that congregation; he was also a regular preacher at the nonconformist morning exercises. When the revolution of 1688 brought toleration he registered as a preacher at Hoxton.<br>
<br>As a result of his humble background Steele was well suited to writing works of popular piety. In 1668 he wrote <span class="italic">The Husbandman's Calling</span>, which was succeeded by <span class="italic">The Tradesman's Calling</span> in 1684. Both these works commended the godly life to the lower orders and sought to teach farmers and shopkeepers how labouring in their calling could be used to find proof of the grace of God; the latter work was one of the first to be given away by the Society for Promoting Religious Knowledge. He also wrote <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning Old Age</span> (1688) to assist those facing their last years to obtain religious certainty.<br>
<br>Steele died in London on 16 November 1692 and was buried at the London church of St Bartholomew-the-Great, where his friend and successor George Hamond preached a funeral oration. He left money to found a school in his home town of Barthomley and to assist the widows of nonconformist ministers. Steele was survived by his wife, Frances, two sons, Richard and John, and two daughters, Abigail and Hannah.<br>
