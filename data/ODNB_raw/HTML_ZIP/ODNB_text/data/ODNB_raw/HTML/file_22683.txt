<span class="headword">Poynings, Sir  Edward</span>  (1459&#150;1521), <span class="occ">administrator, soldier, and diplomat</span>, was born in the autumn of 1459, probably at his father's house in Southwark.<h2>
<a name="OriginsandearlyservicetoHenryVII"></a>Origins and early service to Henry VII</h2>Poynings was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65100/', "Robert Poynings (c.1419&#150;1461)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22684/', "Poynings, Michael")</script>] and his wife, Elizabeth Paston (1429?&#150;1487/8), who married in 1458. His father, who had been carver and sword-bearer to Jack Cade, was killed at the second battle of St Albans in February 1461, after which his estates in Kent and Sussex were seized by his cousin Eleanor, countess of Northumberland, who retained many of them until her death in 1484. Poynings was brought up by his mother, who in 1466 married Sir George Brown of Betchworth, Surrey. She later appointed him her executor. In October 1483 he was prominent in the rising against Richard III in Kent, probably being drawn in by his stepfather. He was attainted in the parliament of January 1484, but escaped abroad, and joined Henry Tudor in Brittany. He led the English party in Vannes in October 1484 when Henry fled into France.<br>
<br>Poynings's later reputation as an outstanding administrator and experienced military commander grew out of his trusted position in Henry Tudor's court in exile. He landed with Henry at Milford Haven in August 1485, where he was knighted. Thereafter he combined membership of the king's council with household office. His attainder was reversed by parliament in November. He also recovered his father's estates, and in 1488 secured a life interest in six manors of Sir Guy Brian's inheritance. These twelve manors, mainly in Kent and Sussex, were worth &pound;427 a year, but in September the king also rewarded him, as knight of the body, with a lavish grant of seven manors in the midlands forfeited by Humphrey Stafford, and in 1491 Poynings was created knight of the Garter. He was commissioned to inspect the ordnance at Calais, Gu&icirc;nes, and Hammes in August 1488, and in 1492 he had command of 12 ships and 1500 troops sent to the Netherlands to aid Maximilian against a French-instigated revolt. After clearing the sea of pirates preying on English commerce from the rebel base at Sluys, Poynings laid siege to Sluys in August, while the duke of Saxony blockaded it by land. After hard fighting the two castles defending the town were surrendered to Poynings, who then negotiated the rebels' submission to Maximilian. Poynings then joined Henry VII before Boulogne, but in November the treaty of &Eacute;taples ended the French War. Poynings was appointed deputy lieutenant of Calais, the scene of Yorkist plotting, and in July 1493, he was sent with William Warham on embassy to Flanders in a vain attempt to expose Perkin Warbeck, who was harboured there by Marguerite of Burgundy, and to procure his expulsion from the Netherlands. Archduke Philip would only promise not to support Warbeck but disclaimed any power to intervene in Marguerite's affairs.<h2>
<a name="AppointmenttoIrelandandearlyproblems"></a>Appointment to Ireland and early problems</h2>In Ireland, however, the situation was even more problematic, with continued Yorkist plotting and the recrudescence of an old feud between the lordship's leading families, the Butlers and Geraldines. Warbeck had already made one descent on this traditional Yorkist stronghold in a bid to improve on Lambert Simnel's unsuccessful invasion of England in 1487, and since then successive attempts to strengthen royal control over the English lordship of Ireland and to restore order had all failed. Thus by the summer of 1494 Henry felt that sterner measures were needed. It was to be for his service in Ireland that Poynings was chiefly remembered and where his skills as a soldier&#150;administrator were most effectively deployed. In September he was appointed deputy to the king's son, Henry, the nominal lieutenant of Ireland. At the request of the prelates, magnates, and other notables of Ireland&#151;so Henry informed Charles VIII of France&#151;he was to lead an expedition to impose order among the wild Irish, establishing there the same justice and good rule as in England. Yet his retinue of 427 men was very small for this purpose, even when reinforced by 226 soldiers already in Ireland. In reality Poynings had instructions to reduce the lordship to royal control and to destroy the king's enemies and rebels there. He was also accompanied by a handful of skilled administrators to reform the Dublin administration. Indeed, with the appointment of three experienced lawyers, headed by Henry Deane, bishop of Bangor, as chancellor and chief justices, and of Sir Hugh Conway as treasurer, the Irish council was dominated by English outsiders.<br>
<br>Poynings landed at Howth on 13 October 1494 and almost immediately summoned a parliament to meet at Drogheda on 1 December. Initially affairs ran smoothly. Leading lords, English and Gaelic, came in to the deputy and chiefs surrendered pledges for peace, but in November the deputy led a hosting into Ulster, where &Oacute; hAnluain and M&aacute;g Aonghusa remained aloof and &Oacute; Domhnaill was intriguing with James IV of Scotland. Accompanied by the earl of Kildare, Gerald Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1513), and Sir James Ormond, Poynings invaded the country of &Oacute; hAnluain, who eventually submitted, as did M&aacute;g Aonghusa shortly afterwards. Yet the deputy then learned of communications between Kildare and the chiefs immediately before their submission and, in view of Kildare's previous record, suspected treachery. This breach with Kildare ended any real hopes that Poynings's more ambitious military objectives might be realized.<h2>
<a name="Poyningslaw"></a>Poynings' law</h2>Later generations remembered Poynings best for an act (10 Henry VII c. 9) of the parliament he convened, known as Poynings' law. This provided that in future no parliament could be held in Ireland without the king's prior consent signified under the great seal of England, and that only bills similarly approved by the council in England could be considered. Its obscure wording may simply reproduce verbatim the king's instructions to Poynings about this before he left for Ireland, and the elaborate operational procedure for Poynings' law was worked out only later. Yet its purpose was to prevent parliament's unauthorized use by governors like Kildare to further private interests, in particular to prevent Warbeck from using parliament, as Simnel had, to legitimize a <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>. Subsequently the local community came to see Poynings' law as a bulwark against arbitrary rule by English governors, and still later as a restraint on parliament's legislative freedom, but no one anticipated that Poynings' law would survive, with modifications, until 1782. Another statute (10 Henry VII c. 39), sometimes also called Poynings' law, likewise had a long history, though its original purpose is unclear. It ordained that all statutes for the common weal of late made in England should apply in Ireland. Possibly a particular application to Ireland was intended of recent English legislation curbing magnate retaining (also regulated by other statutes of Poynings's parliament), but the act was later used to justify a more general application of English statutes passed before 1494. Otherwise, the forty-nine acts of Poynings's parliament had a shorter lifespan, although much of the legislation was politically important and of official origin. One act enjoined obedience to the king's commands under his English seals, and repealed a statute of the Yorkist parliament of 1460 to the contrary. The chief judges and financial officers were to hold office during pleasure, not for life. It was made treason to incite the Irish to levy war against the governor. Custody of the chief royal castles was restricted to those born in England. Finally, many statutes re-enacted, with slight modifications, previous legislation for fostering the use of English law, customs, and weapons and proscribing Gaelic practices, notably by confirming the <span class="roman">Statutes of Kilkenny</span> of 1366. Overall, the legislation strengthened the king's control over the lordship and the Dublin administration.<h2>
<a name="Militarysuccessandadministrativereform"></a>Military success and administrative reform</h2>By spring 1495, however, Poynings was increasingly preoccupied with the worsening military situation, and Bishop Deane as chancellor presided over the later sessions of parliament, which was dissolved in April. Kildare was eventually arrested in late February, and shipped to England. Within days his brother, Sir James Fitzgerald, had seized Carlow Castle and Poynings and Ormond besieged it throughout the spring, eventually retaking it in July. The terms of Kildare's attainder for treason highlighted the growing danger from Warbeck: he was accused of plotting the deputy's murder, holding communications with the king's enemies, and conspiring with the king of Scots and the earl of Desmond for an army of Scots to invade Ireland and overthrow the deputy and the king's true subjects. During the spring Desmond and Lord Barry were organizing a rising in Munster on Warbeck's behalf, and Gaelic chiefs throughout the west and north were also restive; but without reinforcements, Poynings could do no more than defend the pale. In late June, Desmond besieged Waterford, just as Warbeck sailed from Flanders. Warbeck's eventual arrival with a fleet on 23 July intensified the city's blockade and the king, responding to renewed appeals from Poynings, promised reinforcements. Yet in the crisis the deputy was forced to call out levies from the pale and Gaelic troops from Leinster as he marched south to confront the rebels. He broke the siege on 3 August, dispersing the blockading forces with his artillery and capturing three of Warbeck's ships. Warbeck retreated westwards and then retired to Scotland, while Poynings conducted mopping-up operations until his recall in December. In military terms Poynings's main achievement in Ireland was undoubtedly the crushing of the Yorkists. Yet an unsuspected legacy of his deputyship was probably the concept of &#145;the English pale&#146;, meaning the closely delineated and defended area of &#145;the four obedient shires&#146; around Dublin. The first reference to the Calais pale dates from 1494, during Poynings's deputyship there; and following his transfer to Ireland, a statute of Poynings's parliament for &#145;diches to be made aboute the Inglishe pale&#146; marks the first recorded reference to a pale in Ireland.<br>
<br>Concurrently with the military crisis Poynings's administration was attempting to meet the king's demands for financial and administrative reform. The foundations for this had been laid in parliament, with an act of resumption, and the grant of a double subsidy based on a revised extent which yielded Ir&pound;1500 per annum over five years. Yet, since the king spent &pound;12,000 on Irish affairs between August 1494 and December 1495, chiefly on the army, efforts to raise more money in Ireland were intensified, notably in April 1495 when the offices of under-treasurer and treasurer-at-war were revived for two associates of Poynings, William Hatteclyffe and John Pympe. As peace was restored during the autumn, military expenditure was curtailed, the value of crown lands recovered, and reform of the customs also swelled revenue from that source. Thus for the year 1495&#150;6 the Irish revenues yielded Ir&pound;3056, or about double its usual value. Yet even this substantial increase was not sufficient, and those captains and officials remaining after Poynings's departure were now needed for the defence of the English north against Warbeck and James IV.<h2>
<a name="Administrativeanddiplomaticservice14961516"></a>Administrative and diplomatic service, 1496&#150;1516</h2>Leaving from Ireland in December 1495 Poynings returned to his native Kent, where he had earlier been appointed lieutenant of Dover Castle, close by Warbeck's attempted landing at Deal in early July 1495. He had been on the Kent peace commission since Henry's accession, was promoted constable of Dover in September 1504, and became deputy warden of the Cinque Ports in 1505; but, in the king's last decade, he also attended the council more regularly. In 1500 he was present at Henry VII's interview with Archduke Philip at Calais, and in October 1501 was among those who conducted Katherine of Aragon to London. In 1508 he likewise conducted the Flemish ambassadors who came to conclude the projected marriage of Henry's daughter Mary to Prince Charles of Castile. Some time before the king's death, he became comptroller of the household and was one of the trusty councillors recommended by Henry in his will to his son.<br>
<br>Poynings attended Henry VIII's coronation as comptroller of the household. He was also promoted lord warden of the Cinque Ports, but soon emerged as a leading diplomat. He witnessed the renewal of the treaty with Scotland on 29 August 1509. In June 1511 he had command of the ships and 1500 soldiers dispatched to the Low Countries to assist Maximilian in suppressing revolt in Guelderland. His expedition embarked at Sandwich on 18 July, and enjoyed some success, reducing several towns and castles. Poynings returned to England in the autumn. He sat in the parliament of 1512&#150;14, probably as knight of the shire for Kent, and led the Commons delegation which announced its choice of speaker to the chancellor in the Lords. From May to November 1512 he was travelling in the Netherlands as one of four commissioners negotiating a league against France. He returned there early in 1513, with Sir Richard Wingfield, to conclude negotiations for Maximilian's inclusion on 5 April in the Holy League. With a retinue of 500 men he was present at the capture of Th&eacute;rouanne on 22 August, and on 24 September of Tournai, of which he was appointed lieutenant with a garrison of 5000 men. For most of 1514 he was engaged in diplomatic work in the Netherlands. He resided chiefly in Tournai, where he uncovered a plot to betray the city to the French. His duties there precluded his attendance at the third session of parliament, where he secured an act (5 Henry VIII c. 18) annulling all suits prejudicial to his landed possessions determined in his absence.<br>
<br>In February 1515 Poynings finally returned to England, having been replaced as governor of Tournai by Lord Mountjoy. He requested leave to go on a pilgrimage to Rome, but on 7 May he was appointed ambassador, with Dr William Knight, to renew the league of 1505 with Prince Charles. They arrived in Bruges on 23 May, but returned to England after four months' unsuccessful negotiation. Almost immediately, however, the French victory at Marignano once more cemented the league of her enemies, and Poynings, recommissioned ambassador to Charles (now king of Spain) on 21 February 1516, succeeded in concluding a treaty with him on 19 April. Charles also granted him a pension of 1000 livres.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsdeathandlegacy"></a>Last years, death, and legacy</h2>This was the last of Poynings's important negotiations. Thereafter he spent most of his time in the Cinque Ports or at his manor of Westenhanger, Kent, where he rebuilt the castle. In 1517 he became chancellor of the Order of the Garter, and in June he was at Calais deciding disputes between English and French merchants and dealing with violations of the treaty. In 1518 he was treating for the surrender of Tournai. Poynings was promoted treasurer of the household in 1519, and Henry considered raising him to the peerage, but he never became Lord Poynings, although he was occasionally so styled. As warden he supplied ships to transport Henry VIII to Calais in 1520 and attended him at the Field of Cloth of Gold. He was also present at Henry's meeting with Charles V at Gravelines. He died at Westenhanger on 22 October 1521.<br>
<br>Poynings had married, before 1485, Isabella (Elizabeth), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24883/', "Sir John Scott")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54537/', "Scott family")</script>], comptroller of the household, and sister of Sir William Scott, warden of the Cinque Ports; she died on 15 August 1528, and was buried in Brabourne church, where she is commemorated by a brass. They had one child, John, who predeceased Poynings childless, but Poynings left seven illegitimate children&#151;three sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65669/', "Sir Adrian Poynings")</script>, and four daughters. He provided for them in his will of 27 July 1521, leaving Westenhanger to his eldest son, Thomas, to whom the king also regranted some lands; but most of Poynings's estates reverted to Henry Percy, fifth earl of Northumberland. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22686/', "Thomas Poynings")</script> was in 1545 created Lord Poynings and appointed lieutenant of Boulogne. His two brothers also served as captains there. Of Poynings's daughters, Jane married Thomas, eighth Lord Clinton (<i>d</i>. 1517), and Poynings paid &pound;135 for the wardship of his grandson, Edward, ninth Lord Clinton.<br>
