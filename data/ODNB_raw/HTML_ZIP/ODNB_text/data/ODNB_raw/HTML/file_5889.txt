<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Coleridge,  Sara</span>  (1802&#150;1852), <span class="occ">writer and literary editor</span>, was born on 23 December 1802 at Greta Hall, Keswick, the youngest of the three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5888/', "Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772&#150;1834)")</script>, poet and philosopher, and his wife, Sara Fricker Coleridge (1770&#150;1845). Although she spent little time in the company of her father, who, estranged from his wife, preferred London to the Lake District, young Sara and her two brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5879/', "Derwent Coleridge (1800&#150;1883)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5880/', "(David) Hartley Coleridge (1796&#150;1849)")</script>, grew up with all the benefits of living in a well-known literary household. Sharing Greta Hall with their aunt and uncle, Edith and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26056/', "Robert Southey (1774&#150;1843)")</script>, the Coleridges were also close friends of William Wordsworth and his family. The ongoing literary labours of Wordsworth and Southey thus ensured an almost constant stream of visitors at Greta Hall, and by the age of twenty Sara had met many of the most famous writers of her day. This stimulating environment, the excellent tutelage of her mother and uncle, her own intellectual prowess, and the impecunious state of the Coleridge family all contributed to Sara's first literary efforts.<br>
<br>When in 1818 Derwent found himself unable to afford study at Cambridge, Sara and Derwent, at Southey's suggestion, together began a translation of Martin Dobrizhoffer's book on Paraguay, <span class="italic">Historia de Abiponibus</span> (1784). Derwent soon lost interest, but Sara persisted, and in January 1822 John Murray published <span class="italic">An Account of the Abiphones, an Equestrian People of Paraguay</span>. Three years later she published a second translation, <span class="italic">The right joyous and pleasant history of the facts, tests, and prowesses of the Chevalier Bayard</span> (1825). By 1825 Sara had visited her father in London and had become secretly engaged to her first cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5882/', "Henry Nelson Coleridge (1798&#150;1843)")</script>. Their engagement was long and difficult. Each suffered from ill health, and Sara had already begun to depend on opium, a dependence which, like that of her father, was to continue throughout her life. After Sara and Henry finally married on 3 September 1829, they moved to London, where Henry practised law and where it was assumed that Sara would renounce her literary labours for the more dutiful roles of wife and mother.<br>
<br>Sara and Henry lived at 21 Downshire Hill, Downshire Place, Hampstead, not far from her father's house in Highgate. Sara's first child, Herbert [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5883/', "Coleridge, Herbert (1830&#150;1861)")</script>], was born on 7 October 1830; her second, Edith (1832&#150;1911), followed in July 1832. Although she continued to read widely and to maintain an impressive correspondence, Sara became an invalid soon after the birth of her children. She suffered from a variety of physical and mental ailments, all of which were exacerbated by her increasing dependence on opium. In January 1834 she gave birth to twins, Florence and Berkeley, who lived only a few days and whose deaths plunged her into depression. Her illness notwithstanding, she worked hard educating her children, and later in 1834 J. W. Parker published a collection of poems, <span class="italic">Pretty Lessons in Verse for Small Children</span>. Although the book went through five editions in almost as many years, Sara never considered it anything more than a family project. <span class="italic">Pretty Lessons</span> was followed in 1837 by <span class="italic">Phantasmion</span>, a long prose fairy tale with numerous poems interspersed.<br>
<br>The crucial event of this period was the death of Sara's father on 25 July 1834. His <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span> had appeared the previous January, and his death was followed by a critical reassessment of his poetical and philosophical career, the most notorious of which was Thomas De Quincey's damning four-part serial in <span class="italic">Tait's Edinburgh Magazine</span>. Although irate about De Quincey's discussion of her father's opium addiction and his failed marriage, Sara was more upset by the charges of plagiarism, and rather than sink to the level of undignified journalism, she and her husband began an editorial campaign that was designed to protect and preserve Coleridge's reputation. Aided by Sara, Henry Nelson Coleridge published <span class="italic">Table Talk</span> in 1835 and four volumes of <span class="italic">Literary Remains</span> between 1836 and 1839. In addition to assisting Henry, Sara began a systematic rereading of her father's works, an exercise that required analysis of his theological and philosophical predecessors. Plagued by ill health (she had three miscarriages between 1836 and 1839) and by a move to 10 Chester Place, Regent's Park, Sara nevertheless began work on a new edition of <span class="italic">Aids to Reflection</span> (1825).<br>
<br>Henry Nelson Coleridge never lived to see that edition. In May 1842 he collapsed with degenerative nerve disease. When he died the following January, Sara, after the appropriate period of mourning, assumed control of the editorial campaign, and although she took advice from her brother Derwent and from her cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5887/', "John Taylor Coleridge")</script>, it was her vision, her labour, and her scrupulous research that kept her father's works before the public eye. After seeing the 1843 edition of <span class="italic">Aids to Reflection</span> through the press, the second volume of which included her own long essay &#145;On rationalism&#146;, Sara published <span class="italic">Biographia literaria</span> (1847), <span class="italic">Notes and Lectures upon Shakespeare</span> (1849), <span class="italic">Essays on his Own Times</span> (1850), and <span class="italic">The Poems of Samuel Taylor Coleridge</span> (1852). Each new edition was accompanied by a lengthy introduction or appendix in which Coleridge's theories were explicated, defended, or qualified. Her finest achievement was her edition of the <span class="italic">Biographia</span>, which took her four years and which continues to be acknowledged by modern scholars. Her introduction to that edition itself occupies almost an entire volume.<br>
<br>In addition to her editorial labours, Sara wrote two reviews for the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, the first on Tennyson's <span class="italic">The Princess</span> for the March 1848 number, and the second on a new edition of Beaumont and Fletcher the following September. By this time an entrenched member of the London literati, Sara counted among her correspondents Joanna Baillie, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Anna Jameson, F. D. Maurice, Henry Crabb Robinson, William Gladstone, Henry Taylor, and Aubrey de Vere. She continued to read voraciously and offered opinions on everything from the inconsistencies of the Oxford Movement to architectural excesses of the Great Exhibition. When she died at her home at 10 Chester Place, on 3 May 1852, after a long and horrific battle with breast cancer, Sara Coleridge left hundreds of pages of unpublished manuscripts&#151;essays, letters, journals, poems, and theological dialogues in the style of Landor's <span class="italic">Imaginary Conversations</span>. Many were fragments. For a woman who spent the greater part of her intellectual life putting her father's literary house in order, it is the last irony that she, arguably the most Coleridgean of Coleridge's offspring, was unable to order her own.<br>
