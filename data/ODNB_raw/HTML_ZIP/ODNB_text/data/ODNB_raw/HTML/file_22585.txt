<span class="headword">Portlock,  Joseph Ellison</span>  (1794&#150;1864), <span class="occ">surveyor, army officer, and geologist</span>, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22586/', "Captain Nathaniel Portlock (d. 1817)")</script>, was born at Gosport, Hampshire, on 30 September 1794. After passing through the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, he was commissioned second lieutenant, Royal Engineers, on 20 July 1813. He served briefly at Portsmouth and Chatham, and was promoted first lieutenant on 13 December 1813. In 1814 he joined the army in Canada. He took part in the siege of Fort Erie (August 1814), and for the greater part of it was the only engineer officer in the trenches. When the army retired he constructed the lines and bridgehead of Chippewa at which Lieutenant-General Sir Gordon Drummond made his successful stand and saved Upper Canada. He afterwards took part in numerous exploratory expeditions and Portlock harbour in Lake Huron was named after him by Drummond.<br>
<br>When Portlock returned to England in October 1822 the Ordnance Survey was about to be extended to Ireland and enlarged in scope to include cadastral as well as topographical surveying, and in 1824 he was chosen by Colonel Thomas Colby for employment there. In the organization of the Irish survey Portlock was the confidential assistant and companion of Colby, an important account of whose life and work he published in 1869. He worked with Colby in the Tower of London until, in 1825, they both went to Ireland, where Portlock was attached to the trigonometrical branch of the work, of which he soon became the senior, and ultimately the sole, officer. In 1825 he made observations at Slievedonard, co. Down, 2800 feet above the sea, a very exposed station where the camp was frequently blown down and the instruments preserved only with difficulty. Portlock had to undertake a system of vertical observations and calculations for altitudes as well as those for the horizontal triangulation. He carried a line of levelling from the coast of co. Down to the coast of Donegal, and caused similar lines to be observed in other places, crossing Ireland in every direction and terminating at stations on the coast where tidal observations were simultaneously made. These operations greatly improved the accuracy of measurements of altitude and also furnished the material for a valuable paper on tides, by the astronomer royal, published in the <span class="italic">Papers of the Royal Society of London</span> in 1845.<br>
<br>On 24 February 1831 Portlock married, at Kilmaine, co. Mayo, Julia Browne. In 1832 it was arranged to compile a descriptive memoir of the survey and Portlock, having completed the work to connect the Irish triangulation to the points already fixed in Britain, undertook the sections on geology and productive economy, since he greatly favoured the extension of the survey work to the production of such memoirs. He began to collect information on geology, zoology, and soils. Unfortunately, for financial reasons, the preparation of the memoir was suspended in 1838, and finally abandoned, so the volume <span class="italic">Geology of Londonderry, Tyrone, and Fermanagh, with Portions of Adjacent Counties</span> (1843) is the only product of his work. While employed on the Irish survey Portlock helped various scientific institutions in Ireland, notably the Geological and Zoological societies. He was one of the early presidents of both, and an enthusiastic contributor to the Geological Society. In 1835 the British Association met in Dublin, and he gave valuable help, particularly with the work on geology and geography. He was president of the geological section at Belfast in 1852 and he contributed geological and ornithological papers to several learned journals.<br>
<br>Portlock was promoted first captain in September 1839. In 1843 his work on the Irish survey ended, and he returned to the ordinary duties of the corps of Royal Engineers, embarking in May for Corfu, where he helped to remodel the fortress and continued his geological and zoological observations. He returned to England in 1847, and while stationed at Portsmouth continued his research, particularly on marine biology. In 1849 he was appointed commanding royal engineer at Cork, where the employment of convicts on military public works was begun. Under Portlock's charge some started work on the unfinished Fort Westmoreland on Spike Island&#151;an experiment which helped to prompt the adoption of the system. While in Cork he married, on 11 December 1849, Fanny, daughter of Major-General Charles Turner, commander of the Cork district.<br>
<br>In 1851 Portlock was appointed inspector of studies at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. He was an ardent advocate of education in the army, especially in the scientific corps, and he instituted many valuable reforms in the system at Woolwich. In 1856 he resigned his position, receiving a commendation for his services, and in November was appointed commanding royal engineer of the south-eastern district, stationed at Dover. In May 1857 he joined the newly formed council of military education, of which he proved an ardent advocate. He insisted that public appointments should be made after open competition and that social rank should be immaterial in selection. In this he agreed with Sir Thomas Larcom, who had also seen this principle in action in the Irish survey. Portlock was also insistent that officers be well educated, and was instrumental in extending the teaching of science at Sandhurst and at the Staff College. He retired from active service on 25 November 1857 with the honorary rank of major-general, but remained until 1862 a member of the council of military education. In 1857 and 1858 he was president of the Geological Society of London. Contemporaries were impressed with his energy and zeal as well as with his scientific integrity and his ability to lead by example. In 1857 he received from Trinity College, Dublin, the honorary degree of doctor of laws. He was a fellow of the Royal Society, and a member of the Royal Irish Academy and of numerous other learned societies. In 1862 he settled at Blackrock, near Dublin, where he died on 14 February 1864. He left no children from either of his marriages.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Portlock published geological and zoological papers based on observations made at his various stations, as well as papers on military engineering and fortification, including some for the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>.<br>
