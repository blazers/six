<span class="headword">Oudart,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1681), <span class="occ">government official</span>, was born at Mechelen, Brabant, in the Low Countries and styled himself &#145;Sieur de Rixtel au Pays de Kempen en Brabant&#146; in later life. He moved to England as &#145;a little page&#146; in the household of Sir Henry Wotton, who subsequently sponsored his education. Created MA at Oxford on 13 August 1636 and incorporated MA at Cambridge in 1639, Oudart studied medicine. He was licensed to practise medicine from St Catharine's College, Cambridge, in 1639, and took the degree of MB at Oxford on 31 January 1643. By September 1640 he was serving as secretary to Sir William Boswell, the English ambassador at The Hague, and two years later was in the employ of Sir Edward Nicholas, then acting secretary of state. He continued to serve Nicholas after the secretary left England for France in 1646, writing newsletters in invisible lemon-juice ink.<br>
<br>Oudart was first recorded as a member of Charles I's entourage in August 1647, although he had probably been with the king as a writing clerk before this, and compounded with parliament for a fine of &pound;22. He remained with the confined king, handling correspondence, including a letter from Charles in early 1648 urging his son, the duke of York, to attempt escape which so incensed the House of Lords as to produce speculation that Oudart might have been executed had he not fled to the Netherlands. He took notes of the treaty negotiations in the Isle of Wight. Charles I may, however, have lost trust in him and Nicholas seems to have believed he was involved in betraying the king's escape plans.<br>
<br>By June 1649 Oudart was secretary to Charles I's daughter, Mary of Orange, the princess royal, in the Netherlands, and his services were lent to her brother, Charles II, whom Oudart accompanied to Scotland in 1650. Moving between the Orange court and the royalist exiles around Henrietta Maria, he earned the animosity of Sir Edward Hyde and of Nicholas, who was suspicious of his involvement with Nicholas's rival, Robert Long. In 1655 Oudart married &#145;a handsome gentlewoman&#146;, Eva Tortarolis, daughter of John Tortarolis of Leiden, who was rumoured to have a portion of &pound;10,000. The marriage produced three daughters: Barbara, who married William Foster; Amelia Isabella, married to Bartholomew van Sittert; and Dorothy, who was unmarried at the time of her father's death. A member of the princess of Orange's council, Oudart remained in her employ until her death in 1661, was named an executor of her estate, and served her son William as Latin secretary and a member of his council. He was characterized by a contemporary as one who &#145;gettes his desires&#146; through &#145;obsequious eye service&#146; rather than &#145;sufficiency or integrity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nicholas Papers</span>, 3.100), although the princess considered him honest and loyal.<br>
<br>Oudart sought rewards at the Restoration, but was granted only a reversion to a signet clerkship and admitted gentleman of the privy chamber on 18 November 1662. From at least January 1663 he was connected with the wine licence office, but lost money there. For years he shuttled to the Netherlands, settling the estate of the princess of Orange, undertaking minor diplomatic duties, and keeping an eye on his wife's property. In the summer of 1665 he was arrested there in retaliation for the English imprisonment of a member of the Dutch embassy in London and although an exchange was made in January 1666 he later claimed to have been racked and kept in prison after his counterpart's release. A warrant authorizing &pound;500 compensation was issued in February 1666 but the incident marked the end of Oudart's position with William of Orange and led to the loss of his wife's Dutch estates. He was granted a patent as secretary for the Latin tongue on 19 July 1666, with a salary of &pound;80. From 1667 he was a fellow of the Royal Society and an acquaintance of Samuel Pepys and of John Evelyn, who petitioned for the office of Latin secretary in 1670 when he heard Oudart was &#145;irrecoverably sick&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 29/273/106).<br>
<br>In 1675 Oudart petitioned Charles II for the lease of a crown estate on the grounds that he had served the crown since his youth, &#145;being a great sufferer, and being now with his family reduced to very great straits&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1675&#150;6</i>, 468). The following year he was once again in the Netherlands trying to regain estates there and in 1678 unsuccessfully petitioned to assume his reversion to a signet clerkship. In 1680 he requested permission to sell the office of Latin secretary, being too infirm to carry out its duties and badly needing money. He died in Little Dean's Yard, Westminster, and was buried in the west cloister of Westminster Abbey on 21 December 1681. His will, dated 5 March 1672, was proved on 13 July 1682 by his widow, Eva. She subsequently petitioned the crown for payment of moneys owed him, she and her family having gone to live off the charity of friends and relatives in the Netherlands. A manuscript copy of &#145;Eikon basilike&#146;, said to be in Oudart's hand, was used for Royston's printed edition, while a number of Oudart's papers came into the possession of the antiquary Francis Peck who printed some of them in his <span class="italic">Desiderata curiosa</span>.<br>
