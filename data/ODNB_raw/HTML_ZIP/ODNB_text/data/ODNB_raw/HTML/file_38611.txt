<span class="headword">Smith <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Grant]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (1797&#150;1885), <span class="occ">diarist</span>, was born on 7 May 1797 at 5 Charlotte Square, Edinburgh, the eldest of five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11273/', "Sir John Peter Grant (1774&#150;1848)")</script>, laird of Rothiemurchus, advocate, MP, and judge, and his wife, Jane, daughter of Edmund Ironside, rector of Houghton-le-Spring.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Grant's childhood was spent mostly on the family estate of Rothiemurchus, Strathspey, and in London. She was educated by governesses and tutors and entered Edinburgh society in 1814. In 1820 the family returned to Rothiemurchus following the decline of her father's career and fortunes. From about 1826 Elizabeth wrote articles to supplement family finances. Her first article, entitled &#145;An Old Story&#146;, she submitted to <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> under a fictitious name. It was not accepted, but appeared later in <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine for Town and Country</span>. Having earned &pound;3 for this first article she wrote other stories for <span class="italic">Fraser's</span> and for <span class="italic">The Inspector: a Weekly Dramatic Paper</span>. In 1825 she and her sister Mary earned a total of &pound;40 from their stories for <span class="italic">The Inspector</span>, some of which received favourable criticism in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, but which Elizabeth later recalled as &#145;a bundle of rubbish&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, ed. Tod, 196). However, it is for her memoirs of these early years, written later in life, for which she is remembered as The Highland Lady.<br>
<br>In 1827 the family moved to Bombay following Sir John Grant's appointment as a puisne judge. In India Elizabeth Grant met Colonel Henry Smith, of Baltiboys, an officer in the 5th Bombay cavalry. They were married in Bombay in 1829. The Smiths returned to Ireland in April 1830 to live on Colonel Smith's estate in co. Wicklow. Elizabeth took an active part in the management and improvement of the impoverished estate and wrote articles for <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal</span> to supplement estate income. She combined this with raising a family of three children: Jane (<i>b</i>. 1830), Anne (<i>b</i>. 1832), and John (<i>b</i>. 1838). Between 1845 and 1854 she wrote the recollections of her life, concentrating on her years in Scotland and providing a unique portrait of the social life of the highlands. Written initially as a private memoir for her family, the first public edition of <span class="italic">Memoirs of a Highland Lady</span> was published in 1898, edited and abridged by her niece, Lady Strachey. This first edition was reprinted four times in one year and a second edition followed in 1911, reprinted in 1928. A third edition appeared in 1950, but the first complete and authentic edition did not appear until 1988. <span class="italic">The Irish Journals of Elizabeth Smith, 1840&#150;1850</span>, published in 1980, was a selection from journals she kept during her married life in Ireland from 1840 to 1885. A more complete edition, <span class="italic">The Highland Lady in Ireland</span>, was published in 1991, and includes details of the great famine of the late 1840s. In 1996 was published <span class="italic">A Highland Lady in France: Elizabeth Grant of Rothiemurchus, 1843&#150;1845</span>, which covered the time she spent in France during the early 1840s among British &eacute;migr&eacute; society.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Smith's memoirs and diaries represent an invaluable social and historical document. Her vivid accounts of life in Scotland, England, India, Ireland, and France provide an important insight into a period of dramatic social and economic change. She recorded the figures and lifestyle of the first half of the nineteenth century across the social strata, with observations of both public figures and the working people. Her writings are particularly useful as a rare example of a female account of highland and Irish life. She died on 16 November 1885 at Baltiboys, Blessington, co. Wicklow.<br>
