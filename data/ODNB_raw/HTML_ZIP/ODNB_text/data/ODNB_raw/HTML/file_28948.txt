<span class="headword">Webster,  William</span>  (1689&#150;1758), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and theological writer</span>, was born at Cove in Suffolk in December 1689, the son of Richard Webster (<i>bur</i>. 1722) and his wife, Jane, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26086/', "Anthony Sparrow (1612&#150;1685)")</script>, bishop of Norwich. His father was a nonjuring clergyman, who afterwards submitted and became vicar of Poslingford in Suffolk. Webster was educated at school in Beccles under Mr Leeds, and was admitted to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, on 2 March 1708. He graduated BA in 1712, MA in 1716, and DD in 1732. He was ordained deacon on 24 June 1713 as curate of Depden in Suffolk, and priest on 26 February 1716 as curate of St Dunstan-in-the-West, London. He edited the manuscript life of General Monck written by Thomas Skinner (1629/30&#150;1679) and published it in 1723 with his own preface vindicating Monck's character. He followed this with <span class="italic">The Clergy's Right of Maintenance Vindicated from Scripture and Reason</span> (1726; 2nd edn, 1727), and two translations of French works: Louis Maimbourg's history of Arianism, and Richard Simon's edition of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>.<br>
<br>After leaving St Dunstan's in 1731, Webster was appointed in August 1732 to the curacy of St Clement Eastcheap, and in February 1732 was presented to the rectory of Depden. On 16 December 1732, under the pseudonym of &#145;Richard Hooker of the Inner Temple&#146;, he began to edit a periodical entitled the <span class="italic">Weekly Miscellany</span>, which continued until 27 June 1741. Nicknamed &#145;Old Mother Hooker's Journal&#146;, the <span class="italic">Miscellany</span> was &#145;a lively mouthpiece&#146; for high-churchmen and nonjurors and it &#145;poured out defiant Jeremiads against the spirit of the age&#146;  (Walsh and Taylor, 33). It attracted most attention for the attacks made in its columns on William Warburton's <span class="italic">Divine Legation of Moses</span>. Webster's contributions to the controversy were republished under the title of <span class="italic">Remarks on the Divine Legation</span> [1739]. They earned him a place in Alexander Pope's <span class="italic">Dunciad</span>, in a passage (bk 2, l. 258) in which Webster was coupled with George Whitefield, who had also criticized Warburton.<br>
<br>In 1740 Webster published a pamphlet on the woollen manufactory based on information supplied by a merchant in the trade, and entitled <span class="italic">The Consequences of Trade to the Wealth and Strength of any Nation, by a Draper of London</span>. It sold well and went into a fifth edition in 1741, the same year as Webster wrote a refutation of his own arguments, published under the pseudonym Andrew Freeport as <span class="italic">The Draper Confuted</span>.<br>
<br>In July 1740 Webster was instituted to the vicarages of Ware and Thundridge and South Mimms in Hertfordshire, which he retained until his death, resigning his rectory and curacy. In later life he fell into considerable poverty, and after vainly petitioning the archbishops and bishops for charity and publishing a treatise on church preferment, he appealed to the public in <span class="italic">A Plain Narrative of Facts, or, The Author's Case Fairly and Candidly Stated</span> (1758).<br>
<br>Webster was a voluminous writer, chiefly on theological subjects, and published a volume of tracts, sermons, and addresses in 1745. His <span class="italic">Casuistical Essay on Anger and Forgiveness</span> (1750) won compliments from Christopher Smart in his seventh ode. Unmarried, Webster died at Ware on 4 December 1758.<br>
