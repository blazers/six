<span class="headword">O'Toole,  Bryan</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1825), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was appointed cornet in a regiment of hussars raised by Friedrich, Baron Hompesch, in 1792, and served with it, under the duke of Brunswick, in the first campaign of that year in Champagne, including the taking of Verdun and the attack on Thionville. He was present at the battle of Jemappes, and later, under the prince of Cond&eacute;, at Neerwinden, at the blockades of Cond&eacute; and Maubeuge, and the battle of Charleroi. He then joined the British army under the duke of York, and commanded a squadron of Hompesch at Boxtel and Nijmegen, and in the winter retreat of 1794&#150;5 from the Waal to Bremen. On his arrival in England he was appointed captain-lieutenant in one of the regiments of the Irish brigade, then in British pay, and on 25 March 1796 was made captain in the Hompesch hussars, with which he went to the West Indies. Baron Hompesch had two units in British pay (hussars and rifles). O'Toole served with the Hompesch hussars in San Domingo, and returned home with the remnants of the corps in 1797.<br>
<br>O'Toole was appointed to a troop in a new corps, Hompesch's mounted riflemen, with which he served in Ireland in 1798, and was present at Vinegar Hill and Ballynahinch. He was placed on half pay when the corps was disbanded in 1802. He was appointed captain in the 39th foot in 1803, and began a series of assignments in southern Europe. He was aide-de-camp to Major-General Broderick in the expedition to Naples in 1805, and to Sir Galbraith Lowry Cole in the expedition to Calabria and at the battle of Maida in 1806. After receiving the rank of brevet major in 1808, he commanded a light battalion at the capture of Ischia in 1809, and commanded the Calabrian Free Corps, in British pay, during Murat's threatened invasion of Sicily in 1810. He resigned his command to accompany the 39th to the Peninsula as captain, and was appointed major in the 2nd Portuguese cacadores, which he commanded at Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, Salamanca, Madrid, and the siege of and retreat from Burgos. On 21 June 1813 he was appointed lieutenant-colonel, and received command of the 7th cacadores in Sir Lowry Cole's division, which took part in the battle of Vitoria, the blockade of Pampeluna, and the battles in the Pyrenees. During his Peninsular service O'Toole lost the use of one arm. He was placed on half pay of the Portuguese officers in 1816. He was made CB on 4 June 1815, and had the gold cross for Ciudad Rodrigo, Salamanca, Vitoria, and the Pyrenees. He died at Fairford, co. Wexford, on 27 February 1825.<br>
