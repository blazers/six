<span class="headword">Ray,  Robin</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Robin Olden]</span>  (1934&#150;1998), <span class="occ">broadcaster</span>, was born on 17 September 1934 at 630 Fulham Road, Fulham, London, elder of the two sons of Charles Olden (1905&#150;1977), better known as the comedian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64577/', "Ted Ray")</script>, and his wife, Dorothy Sybil Stevens (<i>b</i>. 1909), a dancer. He was educated at Highgate School (May 1947 to March 1950)&#151;he wanted to become a concert pianist but realized he was not good enough&#151;and at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and did national service as a Royal Army Service Corps officer (second lieutenant, 5 December 1953). At school and in the army he used his real name, Olden, but he subsequently used as his professional name Robin Ray and became generally known by it: he omitted &#145;Olden&#146; from his <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry. His television d&eacute;but was in 1956 in an ITV crime play, <span class="italic">The Guv'nor</span>, and his London stage d&eacute;but was in 1960 in <span class="italic">The Changeling</span> at the Royal Court Theatre. Following further acting, he was chief technical instructor at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (1961&#150;5), but resigned over internal politics in support of the principal, John Fernald, then was associate director of the Meadowbrook Theater, Detroit (1965&#150;6). He married on 25 January 1960 Susan Myra Ann Stranks (<i>b</i>. 1939), actress and later children's television presenter; they had one son.<br>
<br>Urbane, stylish, with boyish if then unfashionable good looks and an enthusiasm for and extensive knowledge of classical music&#151;and since childhood an avid record-collector&#151;Ray enjoyed from 1965 a successful and varied career in BBC and commercial radio and television broadcasting, as a writer, producer, and presenter. Programmes in which he was involved included <span class="italic">Face the Music</span>, <span class="italic">Call my Bluff</span>, <span class="italic">The Movie Quiz</span>, and <span class="italic">Cabbages and Kings</span>. He was musical adviser to the commercial radio station Classic FM, and its artistic director (1988&#150;91), compiling for it a music database. He continued to act intermittently, and he wrote or devised and presented several shows including <span class="italic">Tomfoolery</span> (1980), <span class="italic">Caf&eacute; Puccini</span> (1986, with Andrew Lloyd Webber), and <span class="italic">Let's Do It</span> (1994). In 1977 he was a member of the Booker prize panel, and he was <span class="italic">Punch</span> drama critic (1986&#150;7). He compiled several books including <span class="italic">Robin Ray's Music Quiz</span> (1978). After a short illness he died in Martlets Hospice, Wayfield Avenue, Hove, Sussex, on 29 November 1998 from lung cancer and was privately cremated on 3 December. His wife, Susan, survived him.<br>
<br>Ray's younger brother, <a name="cosubject_92686"></a><span class="headword">Andrew Ray</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Andrew Olden]</span>  (1939&#150;2003), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 31 May 1939 at Onslow House, Chase Road, Southgate, London. He was educated at Franklin House preparatory school, Palmers Green, London, but his success in the title role of the film <span class="italic">The Mudlark</span> (1950), alongside Irene Dunn as Queen Victoria, brought an effective end to his formal education. He scored further successes in such films as J. Lee Thompson's thriller <span class="italic">The Yellow Balloon</span> (1953), the same director's <span class="italic">Woman in a Dressing Gown</span> (1957), and John Ford's <span class="italic">Gideon's Day</span> (1958). His father had put his earnings into a trust until his seventeenth birthday; when he came into the trust he went, as he later said, &#145;a bit mad&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 23 Aug 2003), buying sports cars and writing off two in six months in near-fatal crashes. On 25 August 1959, against his father's wishes, he married the twenty-year-old actress Susan Joan Burnet (1938&#150;2010), daughter of Gordon Stewart Burnet, accountant; they had a son and a daughter. In 1960 he won critical acclaim for his portrayal of Geoffrey in Shelagh Delaney's <span class="italic">A Taste of Honey</span> in New York, but on his return he found that work had dried up. In April 1965 he was taken to hospital after taking a drugs overdose. After treatment he rebuilt his career, winning plaudits for his portrayal of Leonard Bast in <span class="italic">Howard's End</span> at the New Theatre (1967). There followed a steady stream of film, theatre, and television roles, notably as George VI in <span class="italic">Crown Matrimonial</span> at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket (1972), the younger George (when duke of York) in the television series <span class="italic">Edward and Mrs Simpson</span> (1978), and Klaus Fuchs in Ian Curteis's <span class="italic">Atom Spies</span>, for Anglia Television (1979). He also appeared in television series such as <span class="italic">Dixon of Dock Green</span>; <span class="italic">Upstairs, Downstairs</span>; and <span class="italic">Inspector Morse</span>. He and his wife Susan separated in the 1970s but remained on good terms and never divorced. In his final years he lived in Hove, Sussex. He died on 20 August 2003 at University College Hospital, London, of heart failure. He was survived by his wife and their two children.<br>
