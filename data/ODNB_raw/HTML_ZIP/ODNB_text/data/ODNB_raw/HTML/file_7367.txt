<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Day <span class="st"> [Daye]</span>,  John</span>  (1521/2&#150;1584), <span class="occ">printer and bookseller</span>, may have been born in Dunwich, Suffolk. The capital investment that he brought to his work as a printer and publisher has led some to suppose that he came of a prosperous family, but this may equally be attributed to his business acumen, innovative spirit, and ruthless pursuit of pious opportunity. By 1540 he seems to have been in London, as in that year a John Day was noted in a city deposition as a late servant of the printer and physician Thomas Raynalde. In 1546 Day was very probably one of twenty men freed by redemption (by purchase) into the London Stringers' Company, and, having secured the valuable privilege of the city freedom, he began to print in the same year. From 1547 to 1549 he was based in the parish of St Sepulchre at the sign of the Resurrection; in 1549 he moved into the gatehouse of Aldersgate, rented from the city for &pound;23 a year, which seems to have served as home and printing house for the rest of his career.<br>
<br>Of Day's commitment to the evangelical cause there can be no doubt and from 1546 he worked mostly in partnership with other members of the emerging protestant book trade, principally William Seres. Seres and Day were among the first to grasp the new opportunities afforded by the accession of Edward VI in 1547. A relaxation of the law against heretical books, combined with the positive advocacy of an evangelical agenda by prominent members of the new governing clique, led to a vast increase in the number of books published from 1547 to 1549, an increase entirely accounted for by protestant works. Day found himself in the vanguard of the new movement. Numbered among his publications were books by some of the most prominent authors: John Hooper, Hugh Latimer, John Poynet, and William Turner of the new evangelical establishment; John Calvin of the major continental theologians. Ten of the twenty books published in 1548 by Day and Seres were contributions to the debate over eucharistic doctrine, including works by Luke Shepherd, Robert Crowley, and William Turner. Day also developed a notable speciality in bringing to an English market important works of continental protestantism. His translations included milestone works such as Herman von Wied's <span class="italic">Consultation</span> on the reform of the diocese of Cologne, a work of obvious relevance to the present debate on the future direction of the English church. Day's editions were mostly congenial octavos, published in a clear, pleasantly ordered blackletter type with plentiful room for marginal annotation.<br>
<br>In 1550 Day opened a shop in Cheapside, transferred from the Stringers' Company to the Stationers' Company, and dissolved his partnership with Seres. However, he continued to print with or for a number of London publishers, and also under his own name. A steady stream of small-format editions were punctuated by larger, more ambitious projects, most notably an elaborate folio <span class="roman">Bible</span> (for which Day seems to have been granted a patent). In all, something like 130 works may be attributed to his press, or were published with his collaboration, during the Edwardian period. In a period when the output of the English printing industry was still markedly less sophisticated than that at most major continental centres, Day's work was also characterized by a notable technical assurance, which may partly be attributed to the extensive use he made of foreign workmen, a professional reliance on foreign expertise that would last for the whole of his career. Day was also closely connected to leading members of the church establishment and political &eacute;lite, and in 1553 he was granted a patent to publish works by Thomas Becon and John Ponet, a monopoly which became both significant and lucrative when Ponet's <span class="italic">Brief Catechism</span> was appended to the <span class="italic">ABC</span>. All of these features of Day's work&#151;typographical sophistication, close connections with the continental printing industries, and official patronage&#151;would underpin his more spectacular success in the Elizabethan period.<br>
<br>For a bookseller so closely associated with the Edwardian regime, the reign of Mary Tudor was bound to be difficult, and Day made little attempt to embrace the new religious principles, though the precise chronology of his activities during the period has been difficult to establish. He did not help his cause by becoming embroiled in the production of clandestine protestant literature. Between October 1553 and May 1554 at least eight works hostile to the new regime appeared, published secretly in England, under the pseudonym Michael Wood of Rouen for which Day may well have been responsible. Although there seems little to connect these grubby, ephemeral tracts with Day's usual quality of workmanship, the distinctive Garamond roman type used by Wood is indeed found in autograph works of Day's press published both before and after. Whether or not responsible for these books, Day certainly did enough to arouse the suspicions of the authorities, and in October 1554 he was arrested and briefly imprisoned. By 1556 he was working again in London, though on a much reduced scale.<br>
<br>With Elizabeth's accession Day's business burst into renewed life. He embarked on a steady production of editions that would continue unabated until his death. His work early in the reign represented partly the re-establishment of patterns established during the Edwardian era: liturgical handbooks for the London Dutch church, sermons and controversial works of the leading figures of the new church establishment. But he also had more ambitious plans. In 1559 he secured a crucial if ambiguous privilege to print Cunningham's <span class="italic">Cosmographical Glass</span> for life, and any other books &#145;not repugnant to Holy Scripture or the law&#146; and not covered by other patents, for seven years  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1558&#150;60</i>, 4). Day exploited this to establish control of publication of the <span class="italic">ABC with Little Catechism</span> (a restoration of his Edwardian privilege), and the period's best-selling book, the English psalter of Sternhold and Hopkins. Even without other prestige projects, such as collected editions of the works of Becon, Latimer, and Tyndale, control of these two staples of English religious life would have made him a rich man. When other aggrieved printers challenged Day's monopoly late in his life, they estimated his annual profit from these two books alone at between &pound;200 and &pound;500. Not surprisingly, the defence of such a lucrative monopoly required powerful protectors at the heart of the regime: in Day's case apparently most crucially Robert Dudley, the queen's favourite and soon to be earl of Leicester.<br>
<br>It was probably only the profits generated by Day's small books which made possible one of the great publishing ventures of the Elizabethan era: John Foxe's <span class="italic">Book of Martyrs</span>. Foxe returned to England from exile in October 1559, and as he set about gathering the contemporary testimonies that would be the book's enduring claim to greatness, a partnership with Day, who was already engaged in the publication of works by prominent Marian martyrs and whose shop, almost alone in London, had the technical resources to match Foxe's ambitions, seemed a natural choice. In the months leading to the final publication of the <span class="italic">Actes and Monuments</span> in March 1563 Foxe was a frequent presence at Day's printing house, and indeed received much of his correspondence there. But the burden of making Foxe's vision a practical reality fell on Day.<br>
<br>Remarkably little attention has been paid to the technical aspects of production of this work. This was a project of a complexity seldom before attempted by an English printer. Not only was the book enormous&#151;the first English edition ran to 1800 pages&#151;its complex compositional structure of different typefaces, columns, and marginalia added greatly to the technical difficulties. As news of Foxe's venture spread, new witnesses to the persecutions came forward, and the author was receiving new information up to and after the date of first publication, all of which had to be included. The extent of the interpolations is revealed in the irregularity of the collation, with inserted leaves and extra or irregular gatherings; more modest changes were made possible by the addition of small slips pasted over already set text. Finally, the fifty woodcut illustrations, all new, and all probably cut abroad or by Flemish artists working in England, had to be commissioned and designed. Although one of the great glories of the book, these represented a considerable extra investment; there is some internal evidence that the larger illustrations arrived late in the day, and their incorporation with the text caused further technical difficulties.<br>
<br>Although we lack any precise information about the production process, it is possible to reconstruct in broad outline the impact such an enormous project would have had on Day's press. For the second edition of 1570 Day employed three presses simultaneously. If this were the case for the first edition, a book of 900 folio leaves would still have occupied three presses for almost twelve months, assuming an edition of 1250 copies. That they were indeed so occupied is clearly indicated by the fact that after two busy years the published output of Day's presses slowed to virtually nothing in 1562, when he was described as being forty, with only two works published apart from the valuable psalms. The cost of keeping three presses running, paying the wages of highly skilled Dutch workmen, and buying ink and paper may have amounted to an investment of not far short of &pound;1000&#151;all before a single copy was available for sale.<br>
<br>Having taken such risks, Day reaped his reward. The book was an instant success, helped on its way by official patronage (in 1571 it was ordered to be set up in every cathedral and in the houses of the senior clergy) and it made Day's reputation. Further editions followed in 1570, 1576, and 1583: Day was still giving pains to this last edition shortly before his death. Foxe and Day remained on good terms throughout, and in the preface to his edition of the works of Tyndale, Barnes, and Frith in 1573 Foxe paid generous tribute to a partner without whom his ambitious plans could scarcely have been realized.<br>
<br>Publication freed Day to return to other projects. In 1564 a smaller-format edition of the letters of the Marian martyrs catered to demand for a cheaper, more accessible version of the martyrology, and works of protestant theology and controversy remained the core of his business. Day also made himself available to publish political tracts helpful to the regime, such as three works by Thomas Norton responding to the papal bull of excommunication (1570) and George Buchanan's polemic against Mary, queen of Scots. In addition, from 1564, Day was the official printer to the city authorities. But the success of the <span class="italic">Actes and Monuments</span> and steady income from his patents also gave Day room to diversify. Early in the reign Day struck up a relationship with Matthew Parker, to whom he proved a willing foil in the archbishop's cherished antiquarian projects. In 1566 he published for Parker Aelfric's <span class="italic">Testimonie of Antiquitie</span>, a book which required the design and casting of special Anglo-Saxon characters. The reward for this and other establishment connections was a new and valuable patent: in 1570 Day received the rights to Nowell's <span class="italic">Catechism</span>, extended to all Nowell's works four years later. Emboldened by the technical success of the <span class="italic">Actes and Monuments</span>, Day also diversified into other categories of illustrated work, most notably an English translation of Euclid's <span class="italic">Elements of Geometry</span> (1570), a brilliant deluxe folio.<br>
<br>Day's success was not entirely unalloyed. In 1573, &#145;one asplyn&#146;, either Day's apprentice Thomas Asplin or the stationer Robert Asplin, attempted to murder him and his family  (Arber, <span class="italic">Regs. Stationers</span>, 1.466). About the same time a bold but unsuccessful attempt by Day to build a new shop in the centre of St Paul's Churchyard led to a clash between the city and church authorities; Day eventually secured premises elsewhere in the Churchyard. In the years after 1577 Day became less ambitious, falling back on the reliable best-sellers that were the basis of his wealth. His shop retained a steady output, and in 1583 still operated four presses. His last years were marred by controversy, as competitors in the London trade, led by his former apprentice John Wolfe, made a determined effort to break his stranglehold on such large areas of protestant print. Following a commission of inquiry, Day handed the rights to thirty books to the Stationers' Company in 1584, though not including his most lucrative monopolies. The dispute remained unresolved at his death, leaving a troubled and complex inheritance for his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7371/', "Richard Day (b. 1552, d. in or before 1606)")</script>.<br>
<br>Day was married twice, and had thirteen children by each marriage; among those from the second marriage was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7369/', "John Day (1566&#150;1628)")</script>, Aristotelian scholar and Church of England clergyman. The name of his first wife is unknown; his second, Alice Lehunte (<i>d</i>. 1612), a gentlewoman, survived him. He accumulated extensive property in London and Suffolk, and a range of printing types and ornamental materials that would have done justice to a major continental printer. He died at Walden in Essex on 23 July 1584, <i>en route</i> to visit his second wife's family in Suffolk. He was buried on 2 August in the parish church of Little Bradley, Suffolk, where a funeral monument was erected; administration of his estate was granted to Alice on 30 August. His death removed one of the titans of the Elizabethan book world, and one of the London book trade's most innovative and adept members.<br>
