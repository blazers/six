<span class="headword">Scudamore,  John</span>, first Viscount Scudamore  (1601&#150;1671), <span class="occ">diplomat and politician</span>, was born on 24 or 28 February 1601 at Holme Lacy, Herefordshire, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76455/', "Sir James Scudamore (bap. 1568, d. 1619)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71878/', "Scudamore family")</script>] and his second wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1632), widow of Sir Thomas Baskervile (<i>d</i>. 1597) and daughter of Sir Thomas Throckmorton of Gloucestershire, and his wife, Elizabeth; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56857/', "Barnabas Scudamore (bap. 1609, d. 1651/2)")</script> was his younger brother. His parents' marriage soured, and his father finally repudiated his mother in 1608. John Scudamore married, on 12 March 1615, Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1600, <i>d</i>. 1651), daughter and heir of Sir Arthur Porter of Llanthony, Monmouthshire, and Hempsted, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Anne; the marriage brought substantial estates, power, and connections to the Holme Lacy Scudamores. After the marriage John continued his studies, matriculating at Magdalen College, Oxford, in November 1616 before being admitted at the Middle Temple in December 1617; in November 1618 he left England for France with a licence to travel for three years.<h2>
<a name="Socialandpoliticalpreferment"></a>Social and political preferment</h2>Scudamore's travels were cut short by the early death of his father in April 1619; he returned to England where his grandfather, old Sir John Scudamore (1542&#150;1623), oversaw his preferment. His grandfather bought John a baronetcy in June 1620, immediately promoting him to the place of precedence in Herefordshire, a county with no resident peer, and over the next three years old Sir John, with the assistance of the lord lieutenant, the earl of Northampton, and a neighbour, Sir Walter Pye, ensured the smooth transition of the family's power in the southern marches to the baronet. Young Sir John assumed the captaincy of the Herefordshire county troop of horse which his father had previously held, was elected senior knight of the shire for Herefordshire to the 1621 parliament, was appointed to the commission of the peace for Herefordshire in February 1622 and <i>custos rotulorum</i> in May, and in the same year was made a deputy lieutenant in the county. By the time his grandfather died, in April 1623, the still youthful Sir John Scudamore was the most powerful magnate in Herefordshire, witnessed by his appointment to the council in the marches of Wales (under the jurisdiction of which both Herefordshire and Gloucestershire fell) in August 1623 and his election once again as the senior knight of the shire to the 1624 parliament.<br>
<br>Scudamore was ambitious, however, for further preferment from the king. Using his contacts at court, especially Sir Roger Palmer, cupbearer to Charles I, he pressed his claims to have agitated for royal policies among MPs, to have been zealous in the collection of the subsidy, and to have perfected the trained bands in Herefordshire. The historical record is silent on the first claim, while modern research has shown the slender basis for the second  (Atherton, chap. 4), but in the mid-1620s Scudamore was an active local governor and particularly zealous as a deputy lieutenant. He worked hard to fashion an image of martial prowess to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather, a gentleman pensioner to Queen Elizabeth, and father, one of the foremost tilters at court in the 1590s, casting himself as the agent through which the county horse would be improved and trained, and organizing his household servants and retainers into a horse troop. While the king was said to have a &#145;good opinion&#146; of Scudamore  (TNA: PRO, C115/M24/7758), his appeals fell on deaf ears and his position in Herefordshire began to be eclipsed by the rise of others, notably Pye and Sir Roger Harley, both of whom had attached themselves to the favourite the duke of Buckingham. Scudamore was returned to parliament in 1625 for the city of Hereford rather than the shire, and did not stand in 1626. In addition, he faced two further crises in the mid-1620s: financial problems as he tried to raise the money to pay the marriage portions of four of his sisters and the debts of his uncle and mother; and personal tragedy, with the early deaths of his first three children.<h2>
<a name="ReligiousconversionandfriendshipwithLaud"></a>Religious conversion and friendship with Laud</h2>Scudamore was rescued from his troubles by a religious conversion and the patronage of the favourite. By 1622 he had established a warm friendship with William Laud. When the friendship began is not known, though it may have been when Laud was dean of Gloucester between 1616 and 1621. Laud acted almost as a proxy father to Scudamore, fussing over his health and that of his wife, and warning him to beware of the January cold; he was also a friend at court, a divinity tutor, and a spiritual friend to the young baronet. The two men met at Holme Lacy, as Laud travelled between London and diocesan responsibilities (Laud preached at Holme Lacy on Sunday 20 November 1625, for example), and in London when Scudamore's affairs took him there. In January 1627 Scudamore asked Laud's advice for a way out of his problems: could he sell some of his impropriations to pay his debts? Laud's reply, that a layman had no right to possess what belonged to the clergy by divine law, set the baronet on a course of restoring impropriations and avoiding sacrilege that was to dominate the rest of his life. Scudamore found other estates to sell to ease his financial worries.<br>
<br>Scudamore had identified himself as one of the handful of lay Laudians. He was about to join another select set&#151;the Buckinghamites&#151;to restore his political fortunes. He seems to have attached himself to the favourite in 1626, proving his mettle in the efficient administration of the forced loan in Herefordshire in 1627 and vigorously, if ineffectually, defending the duke in the 1628 parliament (in which Scudamore was again MP for Hereford). His reward came in July 1628, when (like so many others that year) he was raised to the Irish peerage, as Baron Dromore and Viscount Scudamore of Sligo, even though, like the others, he had neither estates in nor connections with Ireland.<br>
<br>Buckingham's death was a severe personal blow&#151;Scudamore sent an early account of the duke's assassination to Laud&#151;and according to a later family tradition he attended the favourite's funeral, but he did not, as earlier accounts have suggested, retire from affairs. True, he did not attend the 1629 session of parliament; none the less, when later that year, after sustained complaints from the English nobility about Englishmen like Scudamore with Irish titles but no estates in Ireland, the king removed the Irish viscounts from all commissions in England, Scudamore was retained by Charles I on the Herefordshire commission of the peace, a signal mark of royal favour. In the early 1630s he was added to further commissions in Herefordshire: those for knighthood fines and for raising contributions for the repair of St Paul's Cathedral. On these he was an active commissioner.<br>
<br>Scudamore also spent the early 1630s restoring the church at Dore in Herefordshire. The estates of the former Cistercian abbey had come to the Scudamores after the dissolution but by the early seventeenth century the abbey church, which formed the parish church of Dore, was badly in need of repair. Between 1632 and 1635 Scudamore restored the building, forming the parish church from the crossing and choir of the abbey; he added a new roof, south porch, tower, belfry, a new bell, and a churchyard wall. The church was also fitted out in full Laudian style with an altar, new woodwork (rails, screen, pulpit, reading desk, and pews), and stained glass. The total cost was more than &pound;425. In addition, he endowed it with the impropriate rectory and all the tithes from the hitherto exempt site and demesne of the abbey, and gave the manor house to the rector to live in (when this later proved liable to flooding he had it pulled down and rebuilt). The restored church was a model of the viscount's high-church or Laudian beliefs, stressing the beauty of holiness, the central place of the eucharist, and the role of ceremonious worship, points all reinforced by the day-long service of consecration on 22 March 1635. Nor was Dore the only church to benefit from Scudamore's piety and fear of committing sacrilege. He built stone parsonages for the ministers of Holme Lacy and Hempsted; he repaired Holme Lacy church and twice gave it a new set of plate; he endowed Hempsted and two other churches with impropriate tithes; and he contributed to the repairs of three cathedrals&#151;Hereford (of which he was high steward), St Paul's, and Bristol. In his lifetime Scudamore was held up as &#145;a Worthy Copy for others to write after&#146; and praised for his restoration of church lands and protection of the clergy  (W. Carpenter, <span class="italic">Jura cleri, or, An Apology for the Rights of the Long-Despised Clergy</span>, 1661, 11).<h2>
<a name="EmbassytoFrance"></a>Embassy to France</h2>Early in 1635 Scudamore was appointed as Charles's ambassador to France, though his departure was delayed until August. Lacking diplomatic experience, he was chosen at Laud's behest to uphold the rights of the Church of England abroad, for in 1635 Charles was uninterested in pursuing a French alliance, preferring to seek after Spain and the Habsburgs instead. Shortly after his arrival Scudamore's embassy chapel, furnished with all Laudian trappings and ritual, caused considerable controversy on both sides of the channel. It was later alleged that it was &#145;adorned according to the newe devise, so that manie Papists there said they were at the English masse&#146;  (R. N. Worth, ed., <span class="italic">The Buller Papers</span>, 1895, 128), but Scudamore received the full backing of both Charles and Laud.<br>
<br>Scudamore did not, however, have the support of Henrietta Maria, and in April 1636 his mission was seconded by the appointment of the staunchly protestant earl of Leicester as extraordinary ambassador. Immediately the two fell to quarrelling: they could agree on nothing, neither religion (the earl inclining to the Huguenots whom, it was believed, felt snubbed by Scudamore's Laudianism), nor English policy in Europe (the earl wanting an Anglo-French alliance, the viscount supporting the king's pro-Spanish peace). Leicester, a more adroit politician with greater support at the English court, soon triumphed and the remainder of Scudamore's embassy saw his exclusion from negotiations and gradual eclipse in all his other duties by Leicester, who lost no opportunity to ridicule him to the English court as an incompetent, pro-Spanish dullard with no respect in France.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, others had a higher opinion of Scudamore's intellectual and political abilities. In his native Herefordshire his reputation and power remained undiminished. His reputation for learning in divinity and philosophy earned him the friendship of the philosophers Thomas Hobbes, Sir Kenelm Digby, and others in the circle of Marin Mersenne in Paris, and in particular with Hugo Grotius (the Swedish ambassador to France), with whom he discussed plans for a union of the English and Scandinavian churches.<h2>
<a name="Politicaleclipseandroyalism"></a>Political eclipse and royalism</h2>Frustrated by the negotiations with the French, humiliated by the triumph of Leicester, and dispirited by the absence of his wife (who had returned to England in September 1638), in November 1638 Scudamore asked for his recall and returned to the English court in March 1639. Though from 1640 he took a house in Petty France, Westminster, to be near the court, no further honours were granted him, despite a tradition that returning ambassadors were generally preferred. The opposition of Henrietta Maria and the king's preoccupation with the rebellion in Scotland counted against him. He apparently spent most of the next three-and-a-half years in Westminster, and was relatively aloof from affairs in Herefordshire, intervening directly only infrequently, such as to sign a pro-episcopacy petition in January 1642, or to secure the election of his son James (1624&#150;1668) as MP for Hereford at a by-election in the spring of that year. In his absence the royalist party in the county formed around others, with Fitzwilliam Coningsby (<i>c</i>.1595&#150;1666) securing its leadership. While Scudamore's younger brother Barnabas had joined the king's army by August 1642, the viscount lay low during both the summer (even though he was appointed a commissioner of array in Herefordshire) and the occupation of Hereford by parliamentarian forces (September&#150;December 1642). The resumption of royalist control in Hereford, however, saw a major struggle between Scudamore and Coningsby for leadership of the royalist party. By the end of March 1643 Scudamore, with his better connections in the king's court at Oxford and traditional power base in Hereford (of which he had been high steward since 1630), had won, but only by starving Coningsby's regiment of men, money, and supplies until it was, Coningsby claimed, &#145;rather like a Constables watch then a Garrison&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 303, fol. 115<i>v</i>). The confusion sown in Hereford by the struggle between Scudamore and Coningsby, and the lack of leadership provided by the former, was matched by the incompetence of Lord Herbert of Cherbury, the king's commander in south Wales and the southern marches. Thus it was that when Sir William Waller appeared before Hereford with a small force on 25 April 1643 Scudamore and the royalist garrison promptly surrendered with barely a shot fired in anger. Scudamore was sent to London as a delinquent and placed under house arrest; he was not released until 20 March 1647. He estimated his losses at &pound;22,190, including his composition fine, the plunder of his houses at Holme Lacy and Petty France, and the destruction of two houses at Llanthony at the time of the siege of Gloucester.<h2>
<a name="Scholarlyreligiousandagriculturalpursuits"></a>Scholarly, religious, and agricultural pursuits</h2>For the remainder of the 1640s and 1650s Scudamore lived peaceably at Holme Lacy and Petty France, devoting himself to agriculture, divinity, and charity. A noted agricultural improver throughout his life, he discovered, grafted, and developed the redstreak apple which became celebrated as the best cider crab in the seventeenth century. It was famed as the &#145;Scudamore crab&#146; and its cider, for which Holme Lacy became famous, as the &#145;vin de Scudamore&#146; (Bodl. Oxf., MS Don. f. 5, fols. 36&#150;7; <span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 2.292). Scudamore is also credited with introducing from the Low Countries the ancestors of the renowned white-faced Hereford cattle.<br>
<br>In 1648 Samuel Hartlib thought Scudamore &#145;a great schollar&#146; who was &#145;studying hard continually&#146;, while in 1663 the Herefordshire clergyman, philosopher, and horticulturist John Beale called him &#145;a person learned and greate fautor of sound learning&#146; (Sheffield University, Hartlib papers, 31/22/19B; H. Oldenburg, <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. A. R. Hall and M. B. Hall, 13 vols., 1965&#150;86, 2.11). In 1656 Peter Gunning turned down his offer of a &pound;40 annuity to live in his household and tutor him in philosophy. Undaunted, Scudamore secured the guidance of Henry Hammond for his reading. On his wife's death in December 1651 he insisted on tithing his extra-parochial estates at Llanthony. From then until 1662, when he secured a private act uniting Llanthony to the parish of Hempsted, he applied both the accruing tithes and their arrears to the relief of distressed orthodox divines. By 1662 he had dispensed more than &pound;1650 to about eighty clerics, some of them obscure country ministers, others nationally renowned figures, including Matthew Wren, with whom he was close friends, Richard Sterne, Robert Herrick, and John Bramhall.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>At the Restoration Scudamore returned to his former local offices and power, and sought the preferment of his son James. A wayward character and inveterate gambler who had spent the later 1650s hiding first in France and then in the eastern Mediterranean to escape his creditors, James was elected MP for Herefordshire in 1661, but his father's hopes were dashed by James's death on 18 June 1668. The viscount died on 19 May 1671, probably at Petty France, and was buried on 8 June at Holme Lacy. He was succeeded by his grandson, John Scudamore, the second viscount (1649&#150;1697).<br>
