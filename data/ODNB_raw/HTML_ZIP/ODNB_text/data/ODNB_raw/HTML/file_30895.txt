<span class="headword">Campbell,  Patrick Gordon</span>, third Baron Glenavy  (1913&#150;1980), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born at 21 Great Denmark Street, Dublin, on 6 June 1913, the eldest of the three children of Charles Henry Gordon Campbell, second Baron Glenavy (1885&#150;1963), later governor of the Bank of Ireland, and his wife, Beatrice Moss Elvery, distinguished painter, and daughter of William Elvery, businessman, of Rothbury, Foxrock, co. Dublin. Campbell spent the first nine years of his life in London until the family returned to Dublin. As both his father and his grandfather, James Henry Mussen Campbell (1851&#150;1931), lord chancellor of Ireland under the union and later chairman of the Irish Free State, were supporters of the pro-treaty party, they were marked for IRA reprisals during &#145;the troubles&#146;; on Christmas eve 1922 the family was roused at gunpoint and herded out on to the lawn where they watched their home being set on fire.<br>
<br>Campbell was stimulated by the artistic interests of his parents who were part of circles which included Samuel Beckett, Elizabeth Bowen, and J. B. Priestley. His father himself had a novel admired by D. H. Lawrence and Katherine Mansfield. As a child Campbell was already tall and gangling (his knees knocked together so hard, he was to recall, that they were severely bruised) and he developed a sometimes paralysing stammer. His time at Crawley's preparatory school, Castle Park in Dublin, Rossall School, and briefly at Pembroke College, Oxford, was undistinguished. When he went down from Oxford after four terms without taking a degree his father did his best to launch him in business, without success. For two years he was an apprentice for an electrical firm in Munich. He left for Paris after being attacked for mocking the Nazi anthem. As a last resort his father sent him with an introduction to Robert Maire Smyllie, the Falstaffian but shrewd editor of the <span class="italic">Irish Times</span>. Smyllie tested him out by sending him to do a piece on a visit to the Dublin Zoo; it appeared unchanged the following day; and after a spell learning to type and failing to learn shorthand, Patrick Campbell was finally launched on his successful career with Smyllie nurturing Campbell's gift for prose.<br>
<br>Smyllie pursued a policy of sending his more promising recruits on a round of jobs: Campbell was briefly a feature writer, leader writer, literary editor, film critic, and parliamentary sketch writer, his mordant humour at the expense of some members of the D&aacute;il establishing his reputation with readers. The <span class="italic">Irish Times</span> was one of the most respected English language newspapers, but after three years Campbell felt Dublin was becoming too small. He left for Fleet Street to work for Lord Beaverbrook, who had known and admired his grandfather. He failed to make an impression at either the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> or the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>, and when the Second World War broke out he returned to Ireland where, as Smyllie declined to take him back, he struggled to establish himself as a writer and joined the Irish marine service, in which he stayed until 1944. It was a difficult decision, as many Irish were joining the British forces. Certainly after the war Campbell felt uncomfortable that he missed &#145;a fearful experience that millions of other people endured and some others failed to survive&#146; (including his sister Elizabeth who was killed in an air raid in London). On 7 August 1941 Campbell married Sylvia Alfreda Willoughby-Lee, a secretary for the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, and daughter of Captain Kenneth Willoughby-Lee MC, of Muizenberg, South Africa. In 1944 Smyllie relented, and offered Campbell the job of writing &#145;An Irishman's diary&#146;, a popular column which he had to produce five days a week. The column provided the format he followed for the rest of his life: &#145;a situation with a beginning, a middle and an end&#151;almost a short story&#151;with myself right in the middle of it&#146;  (Campbell).<br>
<br>By 1947 Campbell felt sufficiently confident to return to Fleet Street to do a weekly column for the <span class="italic">Sunday Dispatch</span>, a paper which Smyllie abhorred. It proved to be very popular, as did the monthly article he wrote for the magazine <span class="italic">Lilliput</span> from 1947 to 1953. The more literary and distinguished <span class="italic">Lilliput</span> began to assume greater importance in Campbell's life. Here he built up his reputation as a humorist and was compared favourably with essayists James Thurber and Stephen Leacock. His best work from this period can be found in <span class="italic">Patrick Campbell's Omnibus</span> (1954).<br>
<br>But the <span class="italic">Lilliput</span> job put a strain on Campbell's already faltering marriage. In 1947 he was divorced and on 6 August 1949 he married Cherry Margaret Lowson Lawson, daughter of Major George Lowson Monro, of the Indian army. By the time of their marriage she had charged her name to Campbell by deed poll. They settled in Dolphin Square, London, where Brigid, his only child, was born. During this period Campbell also became a film writer for the Rank Organization, then at the height of its film production era, and he was employed as an &#145;additional dialogue writer&#146; for Pinewood Studios. He also made his mark in gatherings such as the Thursday Club.<br>
<br>Agreeable though the life was, it did Campbell's writing no good; this became, as he admitted, mechanical. One by one he lost his regular jobs. But after a shaky spell which culminated in the end of his second marriage in divorce, a series of entertaining recollections of past episodes in his life for <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> (later collected in <span class="italic">Come Here till I Tell You</span>, 1960) led to his being offered a column in the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>. There he perfected the style which allowed him to &#145;toss up a trifle of experience and keep it in the air with great dexterity for minutes before letting it spin away into fantasy&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). When E. G. (Ned) Sherrin suggested he should become one of the resident talkers in BBC television's <span class="italic">Not so Much a Programme, More a Way of Life</span>, he decided to risk trying out his stammer on a mass audience. In the end Campbell used his stammer to point up jokes&#151;or, often, to make ordinary statements sound as if they were jokes. Later he won more kudos in the <span class="italic">Call my Bluff</span> series in the protracted battle with Frank Muir's team. Gratifying though it was for him to receive tributes, as he often did, for giving the stammer a new image, he always insisted that he would willingly have got rid of it if he could.<br>
<br>Campbell's public profile increased sales of his books: fifteen were published, chiefly for the Christmas market, in the space of twenty-three years. Most of them were collections of his articles, the exceptions being <span class="italic">My Life and Easy Times</span> (1967), his autobiography, which was also a moving tribute to his father, and <span class="italic">How to Become a Scratch Golfer</span> (1963), a light-hearted look back over one of the two recreations he listed in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> (the other being, simply, &#145;pleasure&#146;). As a golfer he had in fact been quite close to international standard, on one occasion surviving four rounds of the Irish open amateur championship, defeating a leading Walker cup contender in the process.<br>
<br>Campbell's second marriage was dissolved in 1966 and in the same year he married Vivienne, previously wife of Charles Orme, and daughter of Charles Knight MC. He had worked with her for years on film and television scripts. After their marriage they went to live in the south of France, where they remained&#151;except when television and other commitments brought him back to England&#151;until he died of viral pneumonia, following a few years of ill health, in University College Hospital, London, on 9 November 1980. He was succeeded in the barony by his brother Michael Mussen (1924&#150;1984).<br>
<br>Campbell had succeeded his father as Lord Glenavy in 1963, but he rarely reminded anyone of his title. Thanks to his stammer, his height, and his imposing appearance&#151;he had something of the look of a Roman emperor about him&#151;he became a well-known and much imitated public figure, remembered as a skilled humorist and raconteur.<br>
