<span class="headword">Cobbold,  Thomas Spencer</span>  (1828&#150;1886), <span class="occ">helminthologist</span>, was born at Ipswich on 26 May 1828, the third son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5738/', "Revd Richard Cobbold (1797&#150;1877)")</script>, novelist, and his wife, Mary Anne Waller (<i>bap</i>. 1801, <i>d</i>. 1876). He was educated at Charterhouse School, and in 1844 became a pupil of J. Green Crosse, surgeon to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital. In 1847 he went to Edinburgh University, where he was assistant to professors Hughes Bennett and Goodsir; he graduated in medicine (as a gold medallist) in 1851. On 19 February the following year he married Frances Philippa Amys, daughter of John Hewitt Amys, gentleman, of Palgrave, Suffolk.<br>
<br>After a short visit to Paris Cobbold returned to Edinburgh, where he became curator of the anatomical museum. While in post, in 1854 he attended the lectures of Edward Forbes, which further aroused his interest in natural history and geology. In 1857 he moved to London, where he was appointed lecturer on botany at St Mary's Hospital. In 1861 he obtained a similar post at the Middlesex Hospital, where for thirteen years he lectured on zoology and comparative anatomy. During this period Cobbold became devoted to helminthology, especially the study of parasitic worms. Many memoirs on the subject were contributed by him to the learned societies, and he was elected FRS in 1864.<br>
<br>The following year financial considerations pushed Cobbold into medical practice in London but by specializing as a consultant on cases where the presence of internal parasites was suspected he continued to build his reputation in helminthology. In 1868 he was, through Sir Roderick Murchison's influence, appointed Swiney lecturer on geology at the British Museum. His lectures proved popular and achieved a total cumulative audience of some 15,000 over the course of his five-year appointment. In 1873 he received an appointment as professor of botany at the Royal Veterinary College, which shortly afterwards instituted a special professorship of helminthology for him.<br>
<br>Cobbold's work, which was original and painstaking, successfully elucidated many obscure features in the history of animal parasites. His principal books included <span class="italic">Entozoa: an Introduction to the Study of Helminthology, with Reference more Particularly to the Internal Parasites of Man</span> (1864; supp. 1869), <span class="italic">The Internal Parasites of our Domesticated Animals</span> (1873), <span class="italic">Tapeworms</span> (1866; 4th edn, 1883), and <span class="italic">Parasites of Meat and Prepared Flesh Food</span> (1884). He was also a contributor to numerous encyclopaedias and dictionaries, and to journals including the <span class="italic">Annals of Natural History</span>, the <span class="italic">Journal</span> and <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the Linnean Society (of which he was a fellow), the Zoological Society's <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> and <span class="italic">Transactions</span>, and the <span class="italic">Intellectual Observer</span>.<br>
<br>Cobbold died of heart disease on 20 March 1886 at his home, 74 Portsdown Road, Paddington, London. He was survived by his wife. In 1887 she and one of their sons offered to institute a gold medal in his memory at the Linnean Society, but the conditions were too restrictive and the society declined.<br>
