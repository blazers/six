<span class="headword">Baring <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em> Stewart-Mackenzie]</span>,  Louisa Caroline</span>, Lady Ashburton  (1827&#150;1903), <span class="occ">art collector and philanthropist</span>, was born at Seaforth Lodge, Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, in the Outer Hebrides, on 5 March 1827, the third daughter and sixth child of James Alexander Stewart-Mackenzie (<i>d</i>. 1843), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26521/', "Mary Frederica Elizabeth Stewart-Mackenzie (1783&#150;1862)")</script>, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14126/', "Francis Humberston Mackenzie, Baron Seaforth and Mackenzie of Kintail")</script>, and widow of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13677/', "Sir Samuel Hood")</script>. Many of her earliest years were spent on the grim moorland island inherited by her mother through the Seaforths, at Brahan Castle, Ross-shire, which remained her deeply loved home until her marriage. Several of her adolescent years were spent in Ceylon, where her father served as governor, and in Corfu, where he was appointed lord high commissioner in 1841. After his return, he died in 1843; Louisa Stewart-Mackenzie now lived at Brahan with her mother, who had been Walter Scott's prototype for Ellen in <span class="italic">The Lady of the Lake</span>.<br>
<br>At eighteen years old Louisa Stewart-Mackenzie was tall, with a superb posture; her brilliant dark eyes beneath firm brows were an inheritance from her Portuguese Sephardi paternal grandmother. So faithful were her strong, well-defined features to those of classical nobility that the art historian and critic Anna Jameson credited her with a resemblance to the head of Juno in Rome, the &#145;Ludovisi goddess&#146;. Yet, despite her attractions, a streak of pushiness, of ambition, was all too apparent; her emotions were uncontrolled, her capriciousness uncircumscribed, her restlessness inexhaustible. She was romantically inclined, and a readiness to fall in love flourished in conjunction with her eagerness for marriage. Ruskin, while giving her drawing lessons at Wallington Hall, Sir Walter Trevelyan's house in Northumberland, saw her as &#145;a romantic young lady&#151;just on the edge of downhill&#146;  (V. Surtees, <span class="italic">Reflections of a Friendship</span>, 1979, 35). Her unreciprocated adoration for Sir William Maxwell-Stirling (in fact he scarcely knew her) took her nearly four years to conquer. Fervent female friendships were also a constant feature of her life. Letters eloquent of devotion to Florence Nightingale and Harriet Hosmer, the American sculptor in Rome, reflect her warmth of heart as well as her emotional effusiveness. Her most enduring and uncomplicated friendship was with Pauline, Lady Trevelyan, whom she first met in Corfu and loved dearly throughout her life. Louisa was hard-up and restless, with no suitors to hand other than Edwin Landseer (whom she was inclined to accept), when an invitation came from the highland shooting lodge, at Loch Luichart, of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1386/', "(William) Bingham Baring, second Baron Ashburton (1799&#150;1864)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1384/', "Baring, Harriet Mary")</script>]. Lately left a widower at fifty-nine, extremely wealthy, and enfeebled by gout, he missed the stimulus of his magnificently brilliant and witty wife. Louisa Stewart-Mackenzie played her cards with dexterity and, with what Thomas Carlyle called &#145;a stroke of artful dodging&#146;, she married him and his material advantages at Bath House, Piccadilly, on 17 November 1858.<br>
<br>This happy marriage, fulfilled by the birth of a daughter, ended on 23 March 1864 with Lord Ashburton's death and, with it, the surrendering of Bath House and The Grange, a great neo-classical house in Hampshire. In her widowhood Lady Ashburton's manic collecting of magnificent paintings and modern sculpture gave an outlet for her &#145;locomotive energy&#146;. No inventory of her art collection has been found: when she died her finances were in chaos and nearly everything was sold. However, it is known that she had sketches by Rubens, possibly Veronese cartoons, a Mantegna, a Rossetti watercolour, several watercolours by W. L. Leitch, many works by Harriet Hosmer, Edward Lear, G. F. Watts, and Marochetti, three sketches by Titian, and several examples of old master drawings. These works were housed in her multiplying residences: Seaforth Lodge, Devon, completed at the end of 1864, was followed by palatial Melchet Court, Hampshire, finished in 1868. Her final project, Kent House, Knightsbridge, was completed about 1873.<br>
<br>Socially ambitious, Lady Ashburton surrounded herself with well-known names. The Carlyles, Ruskin, the duke of Argyll, the Walter Trevelyans, Lear, W. W. Story, Robert Browning, Samuel Wilberforce (the bishop of Oxford), Lord Houghton, Millais, Professor John Tyndall, Charles Kingsley&#151;all these and many more she gathered under her roof during her hectic career. In later life Carlyle was her great new objective, a pursuit apprehensively accepted by the aged widower. The epic controversy regarding her marriage proposal, probably made in August 1869, to Robert Browning and her fury at his rejection remains unresolved, though quite in character with her ambitions. Extravagance and an ever-changing scene were the stimulants of Lady Ashburton's final years; when her energies for building and art collecting began to flag, she devoted herself to philanthropy. In the last fifteen years of her life the mission to seamen in Canning Town, together with the Ashburton Home of Rest, played the largest part, but she supported many other charitable causes, including the Tower Hamlets mission, the Metropolitan Tabernacle at Islington, the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association, and the Holy Trinity Mission Fund, Bethnal Green; advocacy for temperance was integral to all. Distressed by her daughter's early death in 1902, Lady Ashburton died of cancer at Kent House, Knightsbridge, on 2 February 1903, the &#145;wandering meteor&#146; being laid to rest in the soil of a highland glen.<br>
