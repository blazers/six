<span class="headword">Orton,  Reginald</span>  (1810&#150;1862), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, born at Surat, near Bombay, on 27 January 1810, was the only son of James Orton (<i>d</i>. 1857), a surgeon in the East India Company's service and inspector-general of Bombay hospitals, and the grandson of Reginald Orton, rector of Hawksworth, near Richmond, Yorkshire. Reginald was educated at the grammar school, Richmond, under James Tate. He afterwards returned to Bombay, where he was apprenticed to his father. On the completion of his apprenticeship he returned to England and entered St Thomas's Hospital as a medical student. He was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1833 and a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries the following year.<br>
<br>In 1834 Orton became a partner in a Mr Fothergill's practice in Sunderland. On 4 October 1836 he married Agnes Caroline, the second daughter of Orton Bradley of Westmorland. They had one son and two daughters. Agnes died on 31 January 1840, and on 25 March 1841 Orton married Mary Isabella, the eldest daughter of Turner Thompson, a shipowner of Sunderland. They had four children.<br>
<br>Orton lived in Sunderland until shortly before his death, when he took a farm at Bishopwearmouth. He was surgeon to the Sunderland Eye Infirmary and consulting surgeon to the Seaham Infirmary. Throughout his life he was a busy medical practitioner and an active reformer. Sunderland owed to his initiative its system of gas lighting, its water supply, its public baths, its library, and its institute. Orton was one of the leading campaigners against the duty on glass and windows, which was repealed in 1845. He suggested to the government that, if light was still to be taxed, the duty should be regulated by the size of the panes, so that those who could afford large sheets of plate glass should pay more than their poorer neighbours. If it were to be found that the duty could be entirely abolished, however, he advocated the imposition of a moderate house duty, commencing at a certain rental, to make good the loss of revenue. This scheme was eventually adopted.<br>
<br>Orton also took a lively interest in maritime matters, and turned his attention to appliances for saving life at sea. He projected a new form of reel lifebuoy, and invented a lifeboat which was light, low in the water, open so that the sea passed through it (the crew being encased in waterproof bags), and practically incapable of being capsized; for these he took out a patent in 1845. The boat was used on one or two occasions.<br>
<br>Orton died on 1 September 1862 at Ford North Farm, Bishopwearmouth, and was buried in the town cemetery. He wrote no books (the <span class="italic">Essay on the Epidemic Cholera of India</span> (1831) is by his uncle of the same name) but did publish two medical papers.<br>
