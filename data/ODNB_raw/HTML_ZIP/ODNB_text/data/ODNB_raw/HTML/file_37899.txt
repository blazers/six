<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Roberton, Sir  Hugh Stevenson</span>  (1874&#150;1952), <span class="occ">composer and conductor</span>, was born in Glasgow on 23 February 1874, the second son and third in the family of four sons and two daughters of James Roberton, founder of the family firm of undertakers, James Roberton &amp; Son, and his wife, Mary Sim. He was educated in Glasgow, trained in the family business, and at twenty-one was appointed general manager of the funeral department of the Glasgow Tramway and Omnibus Company. Inspired by his mother, an untrained singer who knew hundreds of folk-songs, he exhibited instinctive musical gifts from an early age, conducting a group of children when he was ten. As a composer and conductor he was entirely self-taught, gaining experience by singing in and directing church choirs. In 1901 he was appointed conductor of the Toynbee Musical Association, a mixed-voice choir attached to a men's social club, and in 1906 he founded the Glasgow Orpheus Choir, with which his name became indelibly linked for the rest of his life. Within two years the choir was booked to sing at the Queen's Hall in London, and a royal command performance soon followed at Balmoral.<br>
<br>In addition to the traditional songs of Scotland, the Glasgow Orpheus Choir gave early performances of most of Sir Edward Elgar's partsongs, and included in their programmes music by Bach and Brahms, and Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox liturgical music. Roberton published some 300 pieces of his own, and his work became an integral part of the choir's programmes. They included <span class="italic">Songs of the Isles</span> (1937), based on highland airs, a <span class="italic">Concert Edition of Scottish Airs</span>, and his best-known partsong anthem, &#145;All in the April evening&#146;. In 1911 he founded the Glasgow music festival and in 1921 he was a founder of the British Federation of Music Festivals. He became well known as a music festival adjudicator, working in Canada every alternate year between 1924 and 1938, and he took the Glasgow Orpheus Choir on tours to Canada, the USA, and half a dozen European countries. Roberton's interests extended to chamber music, and for some years his concerts featured visits from the London String Quartet and the Lener String Quartet.<br>
<br>Roberton wrote two plays, published as <span class="italic">Kirsteen</span> (1922); a collection of humorous sketches, <span class="italic">Curdies</span> (1931); and <span class="italic">Choir Singing</span> (1925). He married first, in 1895, Joan, daughter of Donald McGillivray, and second, in 1909, Helen, daughter of John Birkmyre, fisherman. There were two daughters and four sons by the first marriage, and three sons by the second.<br>
<br>In 1951 Roberton took on the vice-presidency of the newly formed Musicians' Organization for Peace. He had always been a socialist and a pacifist, a brave position for a man in public life to adopt at the time, and he and his colleagues paid a heavy price for his principles when in 1940 the BBC banned broadcasts by the Glasgow Orpheus Choir. This prompted a debate in parliament and elicited one of Winston Churchill's most astute and amusing comments: he did not see, he said, why being a pacifist should make a man play flat. The ban was rescinded.<br>
<br>In 1951 Roberton decided he could no longer provide the dynamic leadership needed to maintain the choir's international reputation, and stepped down. As a result, the Glasgow Orpheus Choir, so totally identified throughout its life with just one man, ceased to exist.<br>
<br>Roberton was knighted in 1931. From Aberdeen University he received an honorary LLD in 1951. He died on 7 October 1952 in Glasgow, and was survived by his second wife.<br>
