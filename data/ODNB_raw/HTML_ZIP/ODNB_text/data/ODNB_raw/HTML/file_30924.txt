<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Chick, Dame  Harriette</span>  (1875&#150;1977), <span class="occ">nutritionist</span>, was born at 5 Newman Street, London, on 6 January 1875, the fifth child and third daughter of the eleven children (four boys and seven girls) of Samuel Chick, a prosperous lace merchant and property owner, and his wife, Emma Hooley, the daughter of a grocer and corn merchant, of Macclesfield, Cheshire. Her parents, both Methodists, brought up their large family strictly, with family prayers twice daily and a ban on such worldly pleasures as theatres and dancing. They sent their daughters to Notting Hill high school, which provided an excellent education (including science) for girls; five of them became university graduates, in botany, physics and chemistry, English, and medicine.<br>
<br>Harriette Chick studied botany, chemistry, and physics at University College, London, graduating BSc in 1896. She then turned her attention to analytical chemistry and bacteriology, obtaining her DSc in 1904 partly by a study of green algae in polluted waters. With an 1851 Exhibition award she worked in the Hyginia Institute of Vienna, in Munich under Professor Max Gruber, a pioneer in bacteriology, and in Liverpool under Rubert Boyce. Charles Sherrington, professor of physiology in Liverpool, suggested she should apply for the Jenner memorial research studentship at the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine near Chelsea Bridge, of which Charles Martin had become director in 1903. Her application was vigorously opposed by two members of the staff who implored the director not to appoint a woman, but she joined the institute in 1905. Chick then started to investigate the process of disinfection by chemicals and heat. The standard test for disinfectants, introduced by Samuel Rideal and J. T. Ainslie Walker in 1903, was unrealistic, as it was carried out in distilled water. The Chick&#150;Martin test, which replaced it, added 3 per cent dried human faeces. This led Chick and Martin to carry out pioneer work on the nature of proteins, demonstrating that heat coagulation was an orderly process governed by established chemical laws.<br>
<br>In 1915, following the outbreak of the First World War, Chick went to Elstree to assist in the urgent task of testing and bottling tetanus antitoxin for the army. She soon returned to Chelsea to supervise the preparation of agglutinating sera for the diagnosis of typhoid, paratyphoid, and dysentery, then prevalent in allied troops in Flanders and the Middle East.<br>
<br>Chick and her colleagues also investigated the distribution of the anti-beriberi vitamin in food, at the request of Martin, who, while on active service with the Australian Army Medical Corps, had recognized beriberi among troops evacuated from Gallipoli. They also studied the distribution and stability in foods of the antiscorbutic vitamin.<br>
<br>From 1918 to 1945 Chick was secretary of the Accessory Food Factors Committee of the Medical Research Committee (later Council) and the Lister Institute, making an important contribution to the committee's monograph <span class="italic">The Present State of Knowledge Concerning Accessory Food Factors (Vitamins)</span> (1919; rev. 1924, 1932). From 1934 to 1937 she was secretary of the League of Nations health section committee on the physiological bases of nutrition.<br>
<br>In 1919 the Accessory Food Factors Committee sent Chick and Elsie Dalyell from the Lister Institute to investigate the deficiencies in Vienna; a few months later Margaret Hume joined them. They found that scurvy, rickets, and xerophthalmia were prevalent in infants and young children, and osteomalacia in the elderly. The team confirmed the healing property of cod liver oil in rickets, and the discovery of K. Huldschinsky of Berlin that exposure to ultraviolet light also healed rickets. These clinical findings, published as <span class="italic">Studies of Rickets in Vienna, 1919&#150;22</span> (1924) convinced Clemens von Pirquet, director of the Universit&auml;ts Kinderklinik, where much of the research was conducted, of the importance of diet in rickets and the error of his previous position, which viewed rickets as a disease of microbial origin. In Britain the publication helped to shift the scientific and medical consensus in favour of the vitamin theory of rickets of Edward Mellanby, and away from the hygienic theory of Diarmid No&euml;l Paton.<br>
<br>Back at the Lister Institute, Chick became head of a newly formed division of nutrition and began investigating the nutritional value of proteins. This work involved the purification of diets for rats and led to studies of the B vitamins, at a time when little was known about them. She became interested in pellagra and the relation of maize to this disease, and gave a series of lectures on it in the USA in 1932. When the Second World War started, the division of nutrition moved to Martin's house in Cambridge. Wartime work included studies of the nutritive value of bread, flour, and potatoes, using rats. After her retirement in 1945 Chick kept in contact with the Lister Institute as a member of its governing body, attending the annual general meeting in June 1975 some six months after her 100th birthday.<br>
<br>Chick was a founder member of the Nutrition Society in 1941 and was elected an honorary member in 1949, and president in 1956&#150;9. In 1974 the British Nutrition Foundation awarded her its annual prize, for which she prepared a lecture on her work in Vienna; shortly before her 100th birthday she gave a lively introduction, leaving the remainder to be read by A. M. Copping. She remained mentally and physically active until her death at the age of 102 in the Evelyn Nursing Home, Cambridge, on 9 July 1977. Chick was appointed CBE in 1932 and DBE in 1949, and was awarded an honorary DSc by Manchester University in 1933.<br>
<br>Harriette Chick was short in stature, neat in dress, lively, and interested in conversation. She was unmarried.<br>
