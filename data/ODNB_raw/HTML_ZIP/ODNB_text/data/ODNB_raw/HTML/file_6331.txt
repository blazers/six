<span class="headword">Cornhill,  William  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1223), <span class="occ">bishop of Coventry</span>, belonged to a London family who rose in the service of Henry II and his sons. He was probably the nephew, or possibly the son, of Reginald of Cornhill (<i>d</i>. 1209/10), a close adherent of John, and doubtless owed his elevation to this fact.<br>
<br>About 1204 William of Cornhill's name begins to appear frequently in the records as a royal clerk and an officer of the exchequer. His first ecclesiastical preferment was the rectory of Maidstone to which he was presented in 1205 by the king. The following year he was made <i>custos</i> of the vacant bishopric of Winchester and abbey of Malmesbury, and in 1206 he acquired a similar role in relation to the see of Lincoln. On 30 June 1207 the king made him archdeacon of Huntingdon and a prebendary of Chichester: he presumably paid the price of 500 marks for these promotions  (<span class="italic">Rotuli de oblatis et finibus</span>, 412). In 1208 Cornhill served as a royal justice, and for the next two years was in constant attendance on the king, being appointed royal chamberlain in succession to Hubert de Burgh (<i>d</i>. 1243) and Peter des Roches (<i>d</i>. 1238). On occasions he transmitted orders for the preparation of royal letters, which consequently bore the mark &#145;per W. de Cornhill&#146;. One of the most trusted of John's advisers (though sometimes out of favour), in 1207 he was appointed assessor for the thirteenth in Lincolnshire, while in 1208, as part of the king's response to the interdict, he was given custody of the clergy's lands in the diocese of Lincoln. In 1213 there is evidence for his participating in the marriage market, when he was granted the right to dispose of the heirs and widows associated with two rich estates&#151;this was the usual type of secular reward for John's servants. Finally, some time before 9 July 1214, through the king's influence, he was elected bishop by both the monks of Coventry and the canons of Lichfield, though he continued to be called archdeacon of Huntingdon until at least 16 August, and probably did not resign this office until he received the temporalities of his see on 20 October of that year (his successor as archdeacon is first recorded on 15 November). He was consecrated by Archbishop Stephen Langton (<i>d</i>. 1228) at Reading on 25 January 1215  (<span class="italic">Ann. mon.</span>, 2.282), the king making him a large grant of venison from Windsor Forest towards his consecration feast.<br>
<br>Cornhill remained active on the side of John until the very end of the reign; he went on unsuccessful missions to persuade both the Londoners and the Welsh princes to support the king  (Rymer, <span class="italic">Foedera</span>, 1.121, 127) and accompanied him to Runnymede, being named in <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> as one of the magnates by whose advice it was issued. He was present when the legate Guala crowned Henry III at Gloucester on 28 October 1216. Of his acts as bishop little is recorded, almost certainly because the practice of keeping episcopal records on rolls did not become prevalent in his diocese, unlike that of Lincoln. Cornhill attended the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 and has been said by some modern scholars to have been so influenced by it, and the principles of church government enunciated there, that he was responsible for the <span class="italic">Constitutiones cuiusdam episcopi</span>, one of the earliest sets of diocesan constitutions  (BL, Cotton MS Vespasian E.iii; <span class="italic">Councils &amp; Synods</span>, vol. 2, ed. F. M. Powicke and C. R. Cheney, 2 vols., 1964, 2.781&#150;97). C. R. Cheney, however, considered that Hereford diocese was the more likely origin of this document. Cornhill granted the canons of Lichfield the privilege of electing their own dean.<br>
<br>In September 1221 Cornhill was deprived of speech by a sudden stroke of paralysis during an ordination service. He died on 19 August 1223, and was buried in Lichfield Cathedral, where his coffin was discovered in 1662. The prior of Coventry's contemporary epitaph was &#145;Vir simplex et liberalis, fidelis regi et utilis regno&#146; (&#145;a generous low-born man, faithful to the king and of service to the realm&#146;; Dugdale, <span class="italic">Monasticon</span>, 6.1242).<br>
