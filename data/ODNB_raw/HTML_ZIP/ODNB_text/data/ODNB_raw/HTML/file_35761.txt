<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ritchie <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Thackeray]</span>,  Anne Isabella</span>, Lady Ritchie  (1837&#150;1919), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 9 June 1837 at 18 Albion Street, north of Hyde Park, London, the elder surviving daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27155/', "William Makepeace Thackeray (1811&#150;1863)")</script> and his wife, Isabella Gethin Creagh Shawe (1816&#150;1893). The circumstances of her birth entered family legend: the homeopathic doctor recommended by her grandmother proved incompetent, and her father was forced to dash out in search of a replacement.<br>
<br>The Thackerays, recently returned from France, were then leading a somewhat hand-to-mouth existence. Hard up and still uncertain that a literary career was desirable, Thackeray had only just begun to take his first steps in the world of journalism. A much darker cloud hanging over the young Annie's early life was the growing ill health of her mother. After the birth of her third child, Harriet Marian (known as Minnie) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59994/', "Stephen, Harriet Marian")</script>], in the summer of 1840, Isabella sank into depression. On holiday in Margate she tried to drown her elder daughter in the sea, thought better of it, and pulled her out. Deeply traumatized by the incident, Annie did not tell her father about it until many years later. <i>En route</i> for Ireland a month later, Isabella made an unsuccessful suicide attempt. She never regained her reason.<br>
<br>Together with the girls' faithful nurse Jessie Brodie, the Thackerays decamped to Paris to stay with the children's paternal stepgrandfather and grandmother, Major and Mrs Henry Carmichael-Smyth. The combination of family poverty and Isabella's insanity left an indelible impression on the three-year-old's mind. In a later memoir Annie recalled Brodie asking Thackeray to change his last &pound;5 note, with the children playing in one room and &#145;Mamma raving in the other&#146;  (Ritchie, 130). With Isabella lodged in a variety of continental sanitoria&#151;she was eventually placed with a private keeper in Camberwell&#151;Annie and Minnie remained with their grandparents for the next six years, affectionately treated but exposed to Mrs Carmichael-Smyth's immensely gloomy brand of evangelical Christianity. Late in 1846 their father, who had by this stage established his literary career, bought a house in Young Street, Kensington, where he installed his daughters under the care of a succession of governesses.<br>
<br>Thackeray was devoted to his daughters, who eagerly reciprocated this affection. Annie's memoirs draw a lively picture of life at Young Street and its distinguished visitors, among whom Tennyson and the Carlyles remained lasting friends. As they grew older the girls accompanied their father on several foreign trips, notably to Italy in the winter of 1853&#150;4, while Annie frequently doubled up as his amanuensis: much of the manuscript of <span class="italic">The Newcomes</span> (1853&#150;5), for example, is in her hand. Though he frequently commented on his elder daughter's supposed plainness, often addressing her as &#145;My dearest fat&#146;, Thackeray esteemed her intellect, and even more, perhaps, her moral qualities. As editor of the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, he shepherded her first piece of journalism, &#145;Little scholars&#146;, into print. After his resignation the magazine serialized her first novel, <span class="italic">The Story of Elizabeth</span> (1863).<br>
<br>Inevitably, Annie was deeply affected by her father's death later in the same year. The two volumes of her private journals, composed in 1864 and 1878, are oddly masochistic in their assumption of past unworthiness. Thackeray left over &pound;20,000. With this the girls, at first accompanied by Mrs Carmichael-Smyth, who died late in 1864, established themselves in a small house at Brompton. On Minnie's marriage to the literary journalist Leslie Stephen in 1867, the three of them lived together at Onslow Gardens. Helped by her father's connections (her books continued to be serialized in the <span class="italic">Cornhill</span>) and the success of novels such as <span class="italic">The Village on the Cliff</span> (1867) and <span class="italic">Old Kensington</span> (1873), Annie's literary reputation was by now firmly established. Annie's fiction dates exclusively from a twenty-five-year period ending in the mid-1880s. Though making use of a number of fashionable genres, for example the governess melodrama (<span class="italic">The Village on the Cliff</span>) and the social panorama (<span class="italic">Old Kensington</span>), its strongest roots are autobiographical. <span class="italic">The Story of Elizabeth</span> draws on her early years in Paris under the somewhat strict supervision of her paternal grandmother, while <span class="italic">Mrs Dymond</span>, set in the Lake District and Paris at the time of the Franco-Prussian War, incorporates her own memories of the commune in 1871. Her other fiction includes <span class="italic">Miss Angel</span> (1875), based on the life of the artist Angelica Kauffman (1741&#150;1807), and a volume of stories, <span class="italic">Bluebeard's Keys and other Stories</span> (1874). Minnie died of pre-eclampsia in 1875 and critics have noted the energizing influence on Annie's work of Minnie's death and her own subsequent engagement: the novella <span class="italic">From the Island</span> (1877), set in Julia Cameron's house at Freshwater and containing thinly disguised portraits of several friends, marks a considerable advance in her technique. Though highly regarded in their time, her novels never quite reach the top rank of mid-Victorian fiction. None the less they are full of interest and drama. One of their most welcome characteristics is a refusal to settle for the stock situations of the time. In <span class="italic">The Story of Elizabeth</span>, for instance, it is hinted that the heroine, Elizabeth Gilmour, is competing with her widowed mother for the attentions of family friend Sir John Dampier (an implication that annoyed contemporary reviewers). Catherine George in <span class="italic">The Village on the Cliff</span> ends up refusing handsome Dick Butler, using her late husband's legacy to bring up her younger sisters and urging Dick to marry the true object of his affection.<br>
<br>Subsequently Annie surprised everybody&#151;not least Leslie Stephen, who found the couple canoodling on the sofa&#151;by marrying, on 2 August 1877, her cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35764/', "Richmond Thackeray Willoughby Ritchie (1854&#150;1912)")</script>, seventeen years her junior and at this point still a Cambridge undergraduate. George Eliot feelingly described the match as &#145;one of several instances that I know of lately, showing that young men of even brilliant advantages will often choose as their life's companion a woman whose attractions are wholly of the spiritual order&#146;  (Ritchie, 171). Despite the difference in years, and Richmond's intermittently roving eye&#151;Annie wrote enigmatically that she loved him &#145;not well enough to refuse him&#146;  (G&eacute;rin, 174)&#151;the marriage was a success, and produced two children, Hester and Billy. After the publication of <span class="italic">Mrs Dymond</span> (1885) Annie confined herself to reminiscences, <i>belles lettres</i>, and the editing of her father's works. Richmond enjoyed a distinguished career as a civil servant at the India Office, and was awarded a KCB in 1907 and a permanent under-secretaryship before dying prematurely of pneumonia in 1912. His wife had by this stage become one of the great ornaments of early twentieth-century literary life. She was the friend of Henry James. Stevenson had written her a poem. George Eliot had declared that with the partial exception of Trollope she was the only modern novelist she cared to read. A portrait by Sargent, to which a troop of admirers subscribed, shows a serene and grey-haired old lady with distinct traces of her father's physiognomy.<br>
<br>Having survived the First World War, when the windows of her house in Chelsea were blown in by an enemy bomb, Annie died on 20 February 1919 at her home, The Porch, Freshwater, Isle of Wight. She was buried in Hampstead on 4 March 1919. Among her obituaries, one of the most evocative is that contributed to the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> by her stepniece Virginia Woolf (who also drew her as Mrs Hilbery in <span class="italic">Night and Day</span>.) Although her novels are largely forgotten, posterity will remember her both as the diligent custodian of her father's memory (her biographical prefaces to the 1911 <span class="roman">Centenary Edition</span> of his works, collected as <span class="italic">The Two Thackerays</span>, 1988, are of lasting value) and as a vivid memorialist&#151;roles which frequently, as in the autobiographical <span class="italic">Chapters from some Memoirs</span> (1894), overlap. A mass of surviving correspondence, much of it unpublished, confirms her centrality to the late-Victorian literary scene.<br>
