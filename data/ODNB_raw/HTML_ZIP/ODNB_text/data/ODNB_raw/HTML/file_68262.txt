<span class="headword">Brocklesby,  Edward</span>  (1524/5&#150;1573/4), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the youngest of three surviving sons of Robert Brocklesby of Glentworth, Lincolnshire (<i>d</i>. 1553) and his first wife (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Cusforthe). He was educated at Eton College and King's College, Cambridge, matriculating on 13 August 1542 at the age of seventeen. A fellow from 1545, he graduated BA in 1547 and proceeded MA in 1550.<br>
<br>Brocklesby clearly became a protestant, for he relinquished his fellowship in 1555 and on 9 June 1558 was granted citizenship of Emden, whose exile community during Mary I's reign included Nicholas Bullingham, former archdeacon and future bishop of Lincoln. In the interim he had married&#151;his daughter Sara was herself married by 1573&#151;and had perhaps also become engaged in secret protestant activities in Marian England, like his exact contemporary Robert Cole, fellow of King's from 1545 to 1551.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Brocklesby's first wife, and he probably returned to England a widower. Although instituted vicar of Congresbury, Somerset, on 1 June 1560 he quickly gravitated to London, and in late 1561, as minister of the vacant parish of St Nicholas Olave, was described in a report to Matthew Parker, archbishop of Canterbury, as unmarried, learned, but non-resident, and living in the household of Edmund Guest, bishop of Rochester. Since Guest had been vice-provost of King's during his residence, Brocklesby perhaps went to London as one of Guest's private chaplains. In October 1562 he received letters of sequestration as curate of St Nicholas Olave.<br>
<br>Brocklesby's brother Richard was among those who stood surety for Bullingham's first fruits as bishop of Lincoln (1560), and in 1563 he was himself nominated by Bullingham to the vicarage of Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. He was soon embroiled in the campaign waged by the Oxford heads Thomas Sampson, dean of Christ Church, and Laurence Humphrey, president of Magdalen, against Archbishop Parker's drive for clerical conformity. Since this was originally confined to Oxford, Cambridge, and London, Brocklesby would hardly have attracted attention had he simply withdrawn to rural Hertfordshire. He was thus perhaps one of the &#145;four other&#146; London clergy examined by Parker on 3 March 1565 along with Sampson and Humphrey, since on 8 May he was arraigned before the ecclesiastical commissioners at Lambeth. The case was heard by Parker, bishops Guest and Edmund Grindal of London, Sir Ambrose Cave, and William Drury. When the use of the surplice was demanded Brocklesby resolutely refused. He was thereupon deprived of Hemel Hempstead, thus becoming the first official casualty of the vestiarian controversy&#151;&#145;the first put out of his living for the surplice&#146;  (Peel, 1.52). Sampson was deprived of Christ Church at about this time, but his successor, Thomas Godwin, was not appointed until 26 May.<br>
<br>In March 1566 Parker suspended thirty-seven London ministers who repudiated the surplice and square cap. Those refusing to conform within three months faced deprivation, but by royal warrant of 1 July 1566 were granted the right to sue for the cancellation of any remaining instalments of first fruits where these had not already fallen due. Brocklesby managed to take advantage of this warrant, appearing before the barons of the exchequer at Easter 1568 with letters testimonial from Parker rehearsing the circumstances of his deprivation three years earlier, and drawn up at that time. He and his sureties were duly discharged of their obligations for Hemel Hempstead's first fruits.<br>
<br>In 1568 or 1569 Brocklesby was instituted rector of Branston, Lincolnshire, on the presentation of Christopher Wray, the future lord chief justice, who had married the widow of Brocklesby's eldest brother, Robert (<i>d</i>. 1557). In 1571 he was collated by Bullingham to the prebend of Sexaginta Solidorum in Lincoln Cathedral. He died in possession of both preferments.<br>
<br>In his will, dated 9 December 1573, Brocklesby left detailed bequests to his son Nathaniel, his unmarried daughters Rebecca and Elizabeth, and a married daughter, Sara Standeburne. Nathaniel, a minor, and Brocklesby's (unnamed) second wife were appointed executors. He died, at Branston or Lincoln, within weeks. Probate was granted to his (still unnamed) wife on 2 April 1574, power being reserved to Nathaniel until his majority.<br>
