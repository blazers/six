<span class="headword">Wigstan</span> <span class="st"> [St Wigstan]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 849), <span class="occ">martyr</span>, is most reliably documented in what is probably the ninth-century section of an early eleventh-century list of saints' resting places, <span class="italic">Secgan be &thorn;am godes sanctum &thorn;e on Engla lande &#339;rost reston</span>, which has an entry &#145;Then St Wigstan rests at the monastery of Repton near the River Trent&#146;  (Liebermann, 11). This record may be corroborated by architectural study at St Wystan's Church, Repton, which shows that during the Anglo-Saxon period two corridors were pierced to give access to the crypt, possibly to allow access to a saint's shrine, presumably Wigstan's. Archaeological excavation has shown a cluster of richly fitted graves around the east end of the church, possibly representing persons wishing to be buried close to the saint. According to Thomas of Marlborough (<i>d</i>. 1236), prior of Evesham and author of the abbey's chronicle, King Cnut translated Wigstan's remains to Evesham, although a portion was later returned to the newly founded canons of Repton. The same writer asserts that Wigstan was the son of Wigmund, king of Mercia in the early ninth century, and his queen, &AElig;lffl&aelig;d. On Wigmund's death, Wigstan refused to become king, preferring a life of religion. When his relative Beorhtfrith asked permission to marry the widowed queen, however, Wigstan refused and Beorhtfrith accordingly had him murdered. John of Worcester, writing in the early twelfth century, gives a brief mention of Wigstan's parentage, death, and burial (at Repton), and gives the date of his death as 1 June 849. Finally, a slightly different version of Wigstan's life and death is preserved in two fourteenth-century manuscripts, Gotha, Forschungsbibliothek, MS I. 81, and London, British Library, Harley MS 2253, which came originally from Herefordshire. Because this version does not refer to the translation of Wigstan's relics to Evesham in the time of Cnut it is possible, but by no means certain, that they derive from an early <i>passio</i>, possibly of ninth-century date.<br>
<br>If the information contained in these texts is reliable, it appears that Wigstan was a victim of dynastic conflict in early ninth-century Mercia, specifically between the family of King Wiglaf, whose son Wigmund was, and the family of King Beorhtwulf, father of Wigstan's killer Beorhtfrith. Wigstan's subsequent veneration as a saint is part of a wider pattern of the veneration of kings and princes killed for what appear to have been political motives. That veneration may have been prompted by the church at large as a means of drawing attention to the crimes of the murderers; or it may have emanated from the desire of the victims' families to perpetuate their memory and the iniquity of their enemies. Repton seems to have been the centre of a royal estate, for in later centuries it had a large parish with dependent chapelries; and Wigstan's cult seems also to have been fostered on the neighbouring royal estate of Glen, where churches at Wigston and Wistow, Leicestershire, were dedicated to the saint. In the later middle ages, Wistow was supposed to have been the site of Wigstan's murder. The cult appears never to have been widely diffused, and its relationship with these royal estates suggests that it was sponsored from within the Mercian royal family.<br>
