<span class="headword">Porter <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Fantham]</span>,  Annie</span>  (1880&#150;1963), <span class="occ">zoologist</span>, was born on 20 February 1880 at Lewes Road Farm, Preston, Sussex, the elder daughter of Samuel Porter, poulterer, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Redwood. The family moved to Brighton soon after her birth. Annie was educated in Brighton before studying at University College, London, from 1902 to 1905, when she graduated BSc in botany. Her particular interest was mycology, and after graduation she undertook zoological research in parasitology at University College. For her doctorate, awarded by London University in 1910, she presented six published papers on parasites found in sheep, mice, and water bugs. She was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1911.<br>
<br>Annie Porter collaborated with Harold Benjamin Fantham (1875/6&#150;1937) in writing <span class="italic">Some Minute Animal Parasites, or, Unseen Foes in the Animal World</span> (1914). The book was intended for both scientists and the general public and has fifty-six illustrations of protozoa drawn by the authors. Porter and Fantham &#145;suspected that smallpox, trachoma, hydrophobia and measles, the causal agents of which are little understood, are due to the agency of Protozoa as yet incompletely determined&#146;  (p. 302).<br>
<br>H. B. Fantham was an assistant to the Quick professor of biology at Cambridge University. By 1914 he was a lecturer in parasitology at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. In September 1913 Annie Porter was appointed for a year as helminthologist at the Quick Laboratory, to deal with the accumulation of material. Her post was funded from the Tropical Diseases Research Fund. From October 1914 to 1916 she held a Beit memorial research fellowship, at the Quick Laboratory. On 24 November 1915 she married Fantham, the son of Benjamin Fantham. They published numerous joint papers, but Annie continued to use her maiden name for all her published work.<br>
<br>In 1917 Annie's husband was appointed professor of zoology at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. Annie Porter came to hold several appointments in South Africa, some concurrently. From 1917 she was head of the department of parasitology at the South African Institute for Medical Research in Johannesburg; from 1921 she was also senior lecturer in parasitology at the University of the Witwatersrand. She was an examiner in parasitology both at this university and at the University of South Africa. When the medical school at the University of the Witwatersrand was founded in 1916 Annie Porter became their first lecturer in parasitology. She was said to have had the reputation of running the zoology department through her husband, who was said to be rather a difficult person; a member of the Eugenics Society, he was against the mixing of races. In South Africa Annie Porter did a considerable amount of research, producing a detailed report (published in 1938) on larval <i>Trematoda</i> found in certain South African <i>Mollusca</i>. This was particularly important in relation to understanding the disease bilharzia.<br>
<br>Annie Porter was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of South Africa; she served a term as vice-president, and was a council member. In 1927 she was a South Africa medallist. Annie was president of Section D (zoology) of the South African Association for the Advancement of Science in 1922, and in 1924 she became president of the South African Geographical Society. She was clearly a leader among South African parasitologists and was working in a field of research in which little had been done in South Africa. However, her publications were very diverse and she never really seemed to settle on a clearly defined area of study.<br>
<br>In 1933 H. B. Fantham was appointed as Strathcona professor of zoology at McGill University, Montreal, and Annie held a post there as a research associate. Their arrival was noted in the Montreal papers, and <span class="italic">The Star</span> for 3 January 1933 reported that &#145;Mrs. Fantham showed every bit as much interest in her new surroundings as her husband and was not at all embarrassed when conversation took a scientific turn for she is a scientist in her own right&#146;. While at McGill, Porter worked with the medical staff at the Royal Victoria Hospital on parasites collected from 139 patients. She found fourteen different species of human parasite and proved that amoebic dysentery was endemic in Montreal. Porter's husband died in October 1937, and she returned to England soon afterwards.<br>
<br>Annie Porter was a fellow of the Zoological Society, and Sir Julian Huxley, then secretary, asked her to be honorary parasitologist for the Zoological Society of London at Regent's Park. She held the position from 1938 until a few months before she died. She submitted an annual report on the parasites she had found in the animals, which was published in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London</span>. She continued to work through the collections of parasites she and her husband had made in South Africa and Canada and published numerous papers, usually citing her late husband's name first.<br>
<br>Annie Porter was also interested in the education of children with cerebral palsy. Once a year she arranged for some of the animals from London Zoo to be taken to the children on a visit. During the war she used her knowledge of mycology to hunt out edible fungi for the benefit of the staff. She propagated the fungi by spreading the spores in suitable places in Regent's Park.<br>
<br>Annie Porter died in St Pancras Hospital, London, on 9 May 1963, from bronchopneumonia. Among her bequests were: &pound;10,000 to Christ's College, Cambridge (her husband's college), to endow a fellowship in parasitology; &pound;5000 each to University College, London, the University of the Witwatersrand, and the Zoological Society of London (and also a microscope) for research; and &pound;1000 to McGill University. The research scholarship administered by the University of the Witwatersrand could be held in any university in the British empire.<br>
