<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ross family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1215&#150;<em>c.</em>1415), <span class="occ">nobility</span>, took both name and title from one of the ancient provinces of Scotland, situated north of the Moray Firth. As first constituted, the earldom comprised only Easter Ross, that is, the eastern and central parts of modern Ross&#151;its expansion to the Moray Firth and to the west coast was a development of the fourteenth century. At least one earl of Ross is recorded from before the thirteenth century, the mysterious Malcolm Macheth, who after an unsuccessful rebellion against David I was imprisoned for twenty-three years, before being released in 1157 and granted the earldom, which he held until his death in 1168. But although Malcolm had sons they did not follow him as earls, which may explain why they reverted to the rebellious courses which had cost their father his liberty. Indeed, it was the suppression of later Macheths which led to the revival of the earldom.<br>
<br>In the early summer of 1215 representatives of the families of Macwilliam and Macheth, claimants respectively, it would appear, to the Scottish throne and the earldom of Ross, invaded northern Scotland from the west and were suppressed by forces led by <a name="cosubject_75447"></a><span class="headword">Farquhar Mactaggart</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1251). Suggestions that Farquhar's byname, meaning &#145;son of the priest&#146;, derived from his possession of the former west-coast monastery of Applecross, seem to have originated in nineteenth-century speculation; if he had an ecclesiastical connection it is more likely to have been with the shrine and sanctuary of St Duthac at Tain, on the southern shore of the Dornoch Firth. Probably a native of eastern Ross, he and others of that region would doubtless have regarded invasions from the west with hostility, looking for lordship to Scottish kings who were now increasingly active in the north of their realm, rather than to pretenders with Irish connections. On 15 June 1215 Farquhar presented the young Alexander II with the heads of his enemies, and was rewarded with a knighthood. In 1221 Alexander came to Inverness, and some time between then and 1226 he made Farquhar earl of Ross, the first in what proved a long-lasting dynasty. In July 1235 Farquhar justified his elevation during Alexander's campaign in Galloway, his arrival late in the day turning a desperate fight in the king's favour. He already had links with Galloway and the Western Isles. In the 1220s he founded a Premonstratensian abbey at Fearn with canons from Whithorn, while by 1223 his daughter Christina had married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20672/', "&#211;l&#225;f, afterwards king of Man")</script>, and he later assisted his son-in-law against enemies in Skye. He also made appearances at court, witnessing the treaty of York in 1237 and subscribing the copy of the Anglo-Scottish treaty of 1244 which was sent for papal confirmation.<br>
<br>Farquhar died about 1251, and was buried at Fearn. It is an apt comment on the association with royal power which lay behind his remarkable career that his two sons, born to an unknown mother, should have been named William and Malcolm, doubtless after two twelfth-century Scottish kings. <a name="cosubject_75448"></a><span class="headword">William  of Ross</span>, second earl of Ross  (<em>d.</em> 1274)<span class="occ"></span>, had been old enough in 1235 to fight alongside his father (whose byname he is not known to have inherited). He married Jean, daughter of William Comyn, earl of Buchan, and supported his brother-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6049/', "Walter Comyn, earl of Menteith")</script>, during the minority of Alexander III. But when Alexander began to rule in person in the early 1260s, and resumed his father's efforts to extend royal power into the west of Scotland, William was active on the king's behalf. In 1262 he was one of the leaders of a force which ravaged Skye, and in the aftermath of the following year's unsuccessful expedition by the king of Norway appears to have been given custody of Skye and Lewis. He died at &#145;Earles Allane&#146;, most likely in Easter Ross, about 18 May 1274; presumably he was buried at Fearn.<br>
<br>William's only son and successor, <a name="cosubject_54309"></a><span class="headword">William Ross</span>, third earl of Ross  (<em>d.</em> 1323)<span class="occ"></span>, was among the nobles who swore in 1284 to uphold the claim of Margaret, the Maid of Norway, to the Scottish throne. In 1290 he subscribed the treaty of Birgham, for Margaret's marriage to Prince Edward of England. A supporter of John Balliol in the Great Cause, he was given custody by King John of a new sheriffdom embracing the outer isles, Skye, Wester Ross, and Kintail. When Anglo-Scottish hostilities began he was captured at the battle of Dunbar; imprisoned in the Tower of London he was not released until 1303, after his wife had petitioned Edward I for her husband's freedom. Shortly afterwards Edward made him warden of Scotland beyond Spey. William's Comyn connections caused him to oppose Robert Bruce in 1306, and when the latter's wife, daughter, and sister took sanctuary at Tain he handed them over to the English. But after his appeals for help to Edward II failed to bring him relief against Scottish attacks he made a truce and then, on 31 October 1308, submitted to King Robert. He was treated leniently and retained his lands (to which Dingwall was added in 1321). With his eldest son he attended Robert's first parliament in 1309, and he was one of the eight earls who set their seals to the declaration of Arbroath in 1320. With his wife, Euphemia (whose ancestry is unknown, though she apparently had property in the sheriffdom of Edinburgh), he had three sons, Hugh, John (who married Margaret, niece and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6047/', "John Comyn, earl of Buchan")</script>), and Walter, who was killed at Bannockburn; and also at least one daughter, Isabel, who married Edward Bruce. Earl William died at Delny, near Invergordon, on 28 January 1323.<br>
<br>William's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_54310"></a><span class="headword">Hugh Ross</span>, fourth earl of Ross  (<em>d.</em> 1333)<span class="occ"></span>, was showered with royal favours even before he succeeded to the earldom. Chief among these was his first marriage, to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3754/', "King Robert's")</script> sister Maud, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3753/', "Robert Brus, earl of Carrick")</script>, which took place some time before 1323. They had two sons and a daughter. Grants of lands and offices (some of them made to him jointly with his wife) included the sheriffdoms and burghs of Cromarty and Nairn, the Isle of Skye, and estates in southern Ross and the Black Isle, as well as the thanage of Glendowachy in Fife; they helped make Earl Hugh one of the richest magnates in the kingdom. In 1328 he swore on King Robert's behalf that the terms of the Anglo-Scottish treaty for the marriage of Prince David to Princess Joan would be observed. Maud had died some time before 24 November 1329, when Hugh received a dispensation for his marriage to Margaret Graham, daughter of Sir David Graham of Old Montrose; they had a son and three daughters. Hugh was loyal to the cause of King Robert's son. He brought a force to the army which fought for David II at Halidon Hill on 19 July 1333 and was killed there, one of the few Scottish magnates to distinguish himself in the battle. His third son, Hugh, became the ancestor of the Rosses of Balnagown, who eventually carried on the family; and two of his daughters made important marriages, Marjorie to Malise, eighth earl of Strathearn, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54314/', "Euphemia")</script> successively to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23119/', "John Randolph, earl of Moray (d. 1346)")</script>, and Robert the Steward, later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23713/', "King Robert II")</script>.<br>
<br>The body of Earl Hugh was buried at Fearn. His eldest son and heir, <a name="cosubject_54311"></a><span class="headword">William Ross</span>, fifth earl of Ross  (<em>d.</em> 1372)<span class="occ"></span>, is traditionally said to have been in banishment in Norway when his father died, and to have formally succeeded to the earldom only on 17 May 1336. Three years later he played an important part in the capture of Perth from the English. He angered David II in October 1346, however, when he came to the muster at Perth for an invasion of England and there instigated the murder of Ranald MacRuaridh, the leader of a contingent from the Outer Isles, with whom he was quarrelling over lands in Kintail. He and his men then left the army. In 1358 he was named as a hostage for the king's release from his English captivity, but may have been slow to depart, since he attended parliaments on 12 November 1358 and 26 October 1359. A powerful figure in the north, in the 1360s William's links with the Steward, and his own marriage (under a dispensation granted 25 May 1342) to Mary, daughter of John of Islay, lord of the Isles, led to his supporting what has been described as a &#145;highland party&#146; in opposing the king. He paid a high price for his stand. About 1350 he had entailed his earldom and lands on his brother Hugh of Balnagown, and after the early death of his son William apparently reverted to this arrangement. But David, having against her father's will arranged the marriage (before September 1366) of Earl William's elder daughter, <a name="cosubject_54312"></a><span class="headword">Euphemia Ross</span>  (<em>d.</em> before 1399)<span class="occ"></span>, to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54256/', "Sir Walter Leslie")</script>, a leading royalist, in 1370 forced William to resign the earldom of Ross and lordship of Skye to the crown, so that they could be regranted to him under an entail which ensured the succession of Leslie and his wife. On the accession of Robert II in 1371 William addressed a detailed complaint to the new king, complaining of this and other acts of oppression, but Robert did not help him. William died at Delny on 9 February 1372 and was probably buried at Fearn, where he had rebuilt the abbey church.<br>
<br>Earl William was succeeded by Euphemia, who normally styled herself lady, but on one occasion countess, of Ross. Her younger sister Janet, who married Sir Alexander Fraser, inherited the Buchan lands that had descended to her father from his uncle John Ross. Sir Walter Leslie (who was likewise called lord of Ross rather than earl) died on 27 February 1382, leaving a son, Alexander, and a daughter, Mary or Mariota. Later in that year Euphemia married the king's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26451/', "Alexander Stewart")</script>, &#145;the wolf of Badenoch&#146;, soon to become earl of Buchan and joint owner of all her lands. Their childless marriage was ended by divorce in 1392, after which Euphemia recovered her lordships and estates. On her death, before 1399, she was succeeded in the earldom by her son Alexander Leslie, who married Isabel, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26502/', "Robert Stewart, duke of Albany")</script>, in 1398 and died at Dingwall on 8 May 1402, leaving an only daughter, Euphemia. In 1405 Albany was calling himself lord of the ward of Ross. Ten years later he persuaded Euphemia to convey the earldom to his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26483/', "John Stewart, already earl of Buchan")</script>, with reversion to his other sons and ultimately himself. But his position was challenged by Donald, lord of the Isles, in the name of his wife, Mary Leslie, and the earldom of Ross eventually descended to their son Alexander.<br>
