<span class="headword">Simpson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bell]</span>,  Jane Cross</span>  (1811&#150;1886), <span class="occ">hymn writer</span>, daughter of James Bell, advocate (<i>d</i>. 1826), and his wife, Janet (1780&#150;1855), daughter of the Revd James Hamilton of Cathcart parish church, Glasgow, was born in Glasgow on 12 November 1811. Educated by her father, she studied the classics as well as those subjects which were conventionally considered appropriate for middle-class girls of the time. In her youth she travelled extensively in Europe. From 1822 onwards, Bell was assessor and town clerk of Greenock; his daughter contributed frequently to the <span class="italic">Greenock Advertiser</span> under the pseudonym Gertrude. In 1831 her hymn on prayer, &#145;Go where the morning shineth&#146;, appeared in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Literary Journal</span>, then edited by her brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2004/', "Henry Glassford Bell (1803&#150;1874)")</script>. On 2 July 1837 she married her half-cousin, James Bell Simpson (<i>d</i>. 1874), an artist and bibliographer, who was librarian of the Stirling Library, Glasgow, from 1851 to 1860; he published <span class="italic">Literary and Dramatic Sketches</span> (1872).<br>
<br>Throughout her adult life Jane Simpson's work, in both prose and verse, appeared in various literary and religious journals, including the <span class="italic">Scottish Christian Herald</span> and <span class="italic">Good Words</span>. She published several collections of poems, including <span class="italic">Linda, and other Poems</span> (1879), which ran to three editions. Her most popular hymns appeared in a number of widely used Victorian collections, including Charles Roger's <span class="italic">Lyra Britannica</span> (1867), James Martineau's <span class="italic">Hymns of Praise and Prayer</span> (1874), Ebenezer Prout's <span class="italic">Psalmist</span> (1878), and the <span class="italic">Scottish Evangelical Hymnal</span> (1878). These hymns, and indeed her writing in general, addressed some characteristic concerns of nineteenth-century protestant evangelical piety: in particular the death of children, but also the bonds of human affection and domesticity, and the benificence of God as demonstrated in the beauty of creation. Her rather sentimental style and &#145;improving&#146; tone is typically Victorian; thus Jane Cross Simpson's work is significant as representative of its time and <i>&#339;uvre</i>, rather than for any enduring literary or religious value.<br>
<br>After her husband's death Jane Simpson lived with her daughter, successively in Portobello, Midlothian; Newport, Fife; and Aberdeen. She died in Aberdeen on 17 June 1886. She had eight children, but was survived only by two daughters.<br>
