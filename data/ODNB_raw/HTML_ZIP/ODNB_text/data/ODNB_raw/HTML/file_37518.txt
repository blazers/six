<span class="headword">Hatch,  Frederick Henry</span>  (1864&#150;1932), <span class="occ">geologist and mining engineer</span>, was born on 7 March 1864 at 7 Westbourne Park Place, Bayswater, London, eldest son in the London family of five sons and two daughters born illegitimately to Henry Hatch (1817&#150;1885) of Oxford, boot- and shoemaker (later merchant, draper, Liberal councillor, and lessee of the Theatre Royal, Oxford) and his common-law wife, Elizabeth Ann (<i>bap</i>. 1832) of Witney, Oxfordshire, daughter of William Collier, weaver, and his wife, Elizabeth. (In 1838, Henry Hatch had married Eliza, daughter of John Thomas Dobney, superintendent registrar of births, deaths and marriages for the district of Oxford, and his wife, Ann; their four sons and two daughters were born between 1840 and 1847.)<br>
<br>Hatch was educated at private schools in London and Paris. By 1879 he was studying general science, both privately and at University College, London. Passing the intermediate science exam in 1883, he was second in the first division with honours in chemistry, his &#145;obtained number of marks qualifying [him] for Scholarship, Exhibition or prize&#146;  (private information). His subsequent claim to have &#145;gained a gold medal and the Tuffnell scholarship for proficiency in analytical chemistry&#146;  (Hatch, &#145;Vita&#146;) appeared widely in contemporary biographical notices. However, University of London records do not show him receiving such an award, nor taking a London degree. Nevertheless, in 1883 he began study at the University of Bonn, and from April 1885 also worked as assistant to A. von Lasaulx in the museum of the Institute of Mineralogy. He completed his dissertation &#145;Ueber die Gesteine der Vulcan-Gruppe von Arequipa&#146; (&#145;On the volcanic rocks of Arequipa&#146; [Peru]) in December 1885 and was awarded his PhD in 1886.<br>
<br>Having returned to London, Hatch joined the Geological Survey of Great Britain as a temporary assistant geologist (petrologist for England and Wales), undertaking studies of rocks from Britain and Ireland. He translated K. H. F. Rosenbusch's <span class="italic">Hilfstabellen zur Mikroskopischen Mineralbestimmung in Gesteinen</span> in 1889 and published his own <span class="italic">Introduction to the Study of Petrology</span> (1891) and <span class="italic">Mineralogy</span> (1892). He was also instructor in geology at the Royal Geographical Society and lectured aspiring explorers in the subject.<br>
<br>On 13 September 1890 Hatch married Mary Elizabeth (1866&#150;1921), eldest daughter of William Henry Randall, merchant and one-time American consul in Madeira, and his wife, Mary Ann de Villiers. She was an intrepid, high-spirited woman of feminist views who felt that &#145;a career in the civil service however distinguished did not offer the prospects commensurate with the talents she believed her good-looking husband possessed&#146;  (private information). She persuaded him, in 1892, to go to Johannesburg as a mining engineer. Hatch joined the South African Trust and Finance Company, and soon demonstrated that the apparently separate gold-bearing &#145;reefs&#146; being worked in several mines were all down-faulted parts of the same main reef leader, thus providing an important guide for future exploration.<br>
<br>In 1893, Hatch became assistant to the American mining engineer John Hays Hammond (1855&#150;1936) who had recently joined the De Beers Consolidated Mines company. Early in the following year Hammond was invited by Cecil Rhodes to become chief consulting engineer to Consolidated Gold Fields of South Africa, and Hatch moved with him. He subsequently accompanied Hammond and Rhodes on a two-month expedition to evaluate the gold-mining potential of Matabeleland and Mashonaland. By 1895, Rhodes was encouraging Dr Leander Jameson and Hammond (by then a ringleader of the reform movement) to engineer a general uprising against the Boers. Hatch wisely returned with his family to England that summer. The subsequent failure of the Jameson raid on the fort at Johannesburg at the turn of the year 1896 resulted in the imprisonment by the Boers of Hammond and other leading reformers.<br>
<br>After some months of work on copper mines in Huelva, Spain, Hatch returned to South Africa where, under difficult conditions, he mapped 8000 square miles of the southern Transvaal, greatly assisting subsequent exploration for the main reef. A steadily worsening political situation led Hatch to return to England in October 1897. Subsequently, as a consultant, he studied gold, copper, and nickel mines in Canada, Spain, India, and Eritrea. He returned to Johannesburg as a mining engineer following the end of the South African War in 1902. His subsequent proof that gold-bearing reefs similar to those of the Central Rand were also present at depth in the East Rand was another important aid to future gold exploration. He also served as president of the Geological Society of South Africa for 1905&#150;6.<br>
<br>Hatch returned to England in March 1906, and again set up as a consultant mining engineer, travelling to the Orenburg goldfields in Siberia (1906) and undertaking a survey of the mines and mineral resources of Natal and Zululand, South Africa (1909). From 1910 to 1913 he was a member of Christ's College, Cambridge, and he lectured in economic geology. He gave the James Forrest lecture to the Institution of Civil Engineers (1911) and was a member of the advisory board of the Royal School of Mines, London (1912&#150;14).<br>
<br>The First World War began shortly before Hatch became president of the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy (IMM) for the 1914&#150;15 session. As the war progressed, stocks of imported iron and manganese ores, vital to production of the steel used in munitions and ship construction, became increasingly critical. Hatch was appointed to the Imperial Institute advisory committee on mineral resources in 1916 (a move which soured his relationship with the IMM) and in March 1917, he moved to the iron and steel production department of the Ministry of Munitions with responsibility for ensuring a sufficient home-production of ferrous ores. Following the armistice, he was appointed director of the mineral resources development branch of the Board of Trade (1919&#150;20). He became a technical adviser to the mines department (1920&#150;32) and was on the governing boards of the Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau (1919&#150;25) and Imperial Institute (1927&#150;32).<br>
<br>Hatch's publications include <span class="italic">The Gold Mines of the Rand</span> (with J. A. Chalmers, 1895); <span class="italic">The Geology of South Africa</span> (with G. S. Corstorphine, 1905); <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Study of Ore Deposits</span> (1929); and the two volumes of <span class="italic">The Textbook of Petrology</span>&#151;<span class="italic">Igneous Rocks</span> (1914; 8th edn, with A. K. Wells, 1926; 10th edn, with A. K. and M. K. Wells, 1949) and <span class="italic">Sedimentary Rocks</span> (with R. H. Rastall and T. Crook, 1913; 3rd edn, with M. Black, 1928)&#151;which became standard university texts, in addition to over one hundred scientific papers and discussions.<br>
<br>Photographs show Hatch to have been an imposing moustached figure. His contemporaries knew him as &#145;a painstaking, studious, highly-cultured scientist&#146; who &#145;always retained a scholar's intellectual integrity and &hellip; intolerance of sham&#146;  (private information); as president of the IMM he had &#145;by example, and by precept, cultivated the habit of studiously short speeches&#146;  (Trewartha-James). Correspondence and anecdotal evidence suggest that, at least in later life, he may have had a somewhat irascible nature. He was a keen golfer and a member of the Bath Club and the Athenaeum. He was appointed OBE in 1920, principally for his work on ore-supplies during the First World War. The rare sulphide mineral hatchite is named after him.<br>
<br>Hatch's wife accompanied him to the Transvaal and on fieldwork in the Indian jungle. They had four sons, the two youngest of whom were killed in action in 1915 and 1916, and one daughter. Following his wife's death from influenza in 1921, he married Amie (<i>b</i>. 1873) (daughter of William Henry Poole, and the divorced wife of Henry Farquharson Kerr, president of the Kerr Steamship Company of Kingston, Jamaica) in 1923, but they appear to have lived apart in 1925&#150;7 and finally separated in 1928. Hatch died of bronchopneumonia on 22 September 1932, at his home, D3 The Albany, Albany Square, Piccadilly, London, following an operation, and was buried in Gap Road cemetery, Wimbledon, the next day, adjacent to his first wife's grave.<br>
