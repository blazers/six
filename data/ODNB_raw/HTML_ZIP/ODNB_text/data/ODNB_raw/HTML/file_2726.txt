<span class="headword">Blyth,  Geoffrey</span>  (<em>c.</em>1470&#150;1530), <span class="occ">bishop of Coventry and Lichfield</span>, born at Norton, Derbyshire, was the second son of William Blyth of Leeds, Yorkshire. His mother was the sister (name unknown) of Thomas Rotherham, archbishop of York. His brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2728/', "John Blyth")</script> became bishop of Salisbury and master of the rolls. Geoffrey Blyth was educated at Eton College and at King's College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1487 and MA in 1490. Ordained priest on 4 April 1495, he incepted as a doctor of theology in 1497&#150;8; a papal dispensation of 1498 still referred to him as a bachelor of theology, but papal letters when he became a bishop in 1503 describe him as master of theology, confirming that he had proceeded to the doctorate. In 1498 or 1499 he became warden of the King's Hall, a position he retained until 1528.<br>
<br>A successful pluralist, Blyth held prebends in Beverley and York minsters in the diocese of York, and became rector of Hedon, Nottinghamshire. He also became rector of Corfe Castle, Dorset, and was collated to prebends in Salisbury Cathedral and St Paul's Cathedral. On 9 May 1493 his uncle Archbishop Rotherham collated him to the archdeaconry of Cleveland, a position he vacated in 1498, when he became archdeacon of Gloucester, while his brother John collated him first (1 November 1494) to the treasurership, and then (22 August 1499) to the archdeaconry, of Salisbury. He was also elected dean of York (26 January 1497). All those benefices which he still held he resigned when he became a bishop. He probably owed his elevation to his serving Henry VII as an ambassador; on 27 May 1502 he was sent on an embassy to Ladislas II, king of Hungary and Bohemia, and he went on many subsequent, though less important, diplomatic missions.<br>
<br>Blyth was provided to the see of Coventry and Lichfield on 5 May 1503. The temporalities were released on 26 September, and he was consecrated on the following day by Richard Fox, bishop of Winchester. As bishop, Blyth seems to have been unable to avoid controversy. He was hampered by the independence enjoyed by the dean and chapter, which exempted them from taking an oath of obedience, but still performed a small number of ordination ceremonies and carried out the occasional visitation of religious houses (where he appears to have found fewer serious problems than his contemporaries on the bench, and those more financial than doctrinal). Early in 1509 he found it expedient to obtain a pardon, to cover his financial responsibilities as executor of the wills of both uncle and brother, while between 1510 and 1513 he was drawn into the testamentary jurisdiction disputes between Bishop Fox and Archbishop Warham (supporting Fox).<br>
<br>In 1512 Blyth was appointed lord president of the council in the marches of Wales, an office he held until 1524; on taking up office he set up a commission to investigate &#145;insurrection, rebellions and Lollardy&#146; in south Wales and the counties of the Welsh march  (Hudson, 34), but it is not known if any action followed, and Blyth usually seems to have been something of a figurehead as president. Meanwhile, an inquest held on 15 June 1513, following the death of Sir Ralph Langford, leaving a minor as his heir, found that Langford and Blyth had conspired in January 1511 to convey the title to lands and manors in Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, and Lincolnshire to Anthony Fitzherbert, so as to defraud the king of his wardship. Then in 1523 Blyth faced a charge of treason, accused by an unknown Welshman; the background to the affair remains obscure (it may have arisen from ill will within the Lichfield chapter), and Blyth was eventually cleared following examination by a committee of peers, but only after three months in custody.<br>
<br>Despite his troubles, Blyth seems to have dealt seriously with his episcopal responsibilities. He acted vigorously against heresy, trying to halt the spread of Lollard literature, and taking some forty abjurations in person between January and February 1512. In the famous case of Richard Hunne, a suspected London heretic who died in the bishop's prison in suspicious circumstances following his arrest in 1514, Blyth was called upon to examine Hunne's annotated copy of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and his observations were central in several of the articles Bishop Fitzjames later objected against Hunne, as well as being useful in the anti-heresy campaigns of other bishops. Personal difficulties persisted, however, and, on 11 July 1530, following Wolsey's downfall, a <i>praemunire</i> information was filed in king's bench against Blyth and thirteen other clerics. The basis of the information appears to have been his having abetted Wolsey's papal legacy by having granted him a third of his annual income through a negotiated composition. Although this might have been related to the dropped treason charge of 1523, he was none the less guilty of <i>praemunire</i> by association. Little seems to have come of it, however, and Blyth died in London soon afterwards.<br>
<br>Blyth was buried in Lichfield Cathedral before the image of St Ceadda (Chad), where a monument (long since destroyed) was erected to his memory. He had secured offices and benefices in his diocese for a number of his relations. In his will, dated 28 April 1530 and proved on 1 March 1531, he bequeathed legacies to his cathedrals, to the churches of St Chad in Shrewsbury and Norton, to Eton College, and to King's College and King's Hall, Cambridge. To Eton and King's College he left great standing cups, both gilt with covers. A notable builder, in his lifetime he built houses for the choristers of Lichfield and a chapel at Norton (in which he erected an alabaster tomb for his parents), also establishing a chantry there. He gave King's College a gilt mitre for the boy-bishop in 1510, a pair of great organs worth &pound;40 in 1512, a rochet of the best cloth for the boy-bishop in 1518, and a fair banner representing the assumption of the Virgin in 1519. He also collected all the statutes of Lichfield, and had these confirmed by Cardinal Wolsey, in his capacity of legate, in 1526.<br>
