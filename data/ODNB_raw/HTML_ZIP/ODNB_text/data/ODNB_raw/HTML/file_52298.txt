<span class="headword">Motley</span>  (<em>act. </em>1921&#150;<em>c.</em>1975), <span class="occ">theatre designers</span>, was the trade name of the team of three remarkable women, the sisters <a name="cosubject_74322"></a><span class="headword">(Audrey) Sophia Harris <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Devine]</span></span>  (1900&#150;1966)<span class="occ"></span>, <a name="cosubject_74151"></a><span class="headword">Margaret Frances <span class="st"> [Percy]</span> Harris</span>  (1904&#150;2000)<span class="occ"></span>, and <a name="cosubject_52298"></a><span class="headword">Elizabeth Alice Marjorie Montgomery <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Wilmot]</span></span>  (1902&#150;1993)<span class="occ"></span>. Sophia (<i>b</i>. 2 July 1900) and Margaret (<i>b</i>. 28 May 1904)&#151;known from childhood as Percy&#151;were raised in Hayes, Kent. Their father, William Harris (1867&#150;1924), was a Lloyds' broker, and their mother, Kathleen (1873&#150;1916), an unconventional woman who loved to dress up her children for photographs. Their happy childhood was disturbed, however, by their mother's early death and by the loss of their brother in the First World War. In 1921 they began to study art at the Chelsea Illustrators' School, where they met Elizabeth Montgomery, whose family had moved to Fulham from Cambridge. Elizabeth's father, William, was born in Liverpool, of Irish-Scottish parentage, and after attending London University joined the Presbyterian church. With his wife, Marta, he moved as curate to Kidlington, Oxfordshire, where Elizabeth was born on 15 February 1902. Subsequently he became a theology lecturer at St John's College, Cambridge, before moving to London in wartime to help to decode German messages.<br>
<br>The three women became friends, united by a passion for the theatre and in particular for the performances at the Old Vic by the rising young actor John Gielgud (1904&#150;2000), who bought some drawings by Elizabeth of him in his Old Vic roles. He took the risk of asking the group to design the costumes for his 1932 Oxford University Drama Society production of <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, in which professional actors&#151;Peggy Ashcroft and Edith Evans&#151;took the female roles; the undergraduate performers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32801/', "George Devine (1910&#150;1966)")</script>, the future actor and theatre director, who later also became influential in Motley's career.<br>
<br>That Oxford <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> was the first major production to bear the name Motley, taken from <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>'s &#145;Motley's the only wear&#146;. Gielgud never liked it (&#145;So anonymous&#146;) but it was characteristic of the three women, none of them remotely hungry for personal fame. The production was also marked by the Motley trademarks of simplicity of line and bold clarity of colour. They were completely united in their approach to their work as organic design rather than decoration, and work was always harmonious between them. Percy, gruffly authoritative in her perennial tweeds and trousers, was the technical genius of the trio&#151;principally responsible for the practical mechanics of the set design, ground plans, and working drawings&#151;while Sophia and Elizabeth, both stylish women and chic dressers (Motley briefly, with Sophia mainly at the helm, entered the world of couture fashion with a London shop, under their joint name, in the 1930s), were unrivalled in their knowledge of period and of modern costume and cutting. Gielgud, the first to appreciate their individual and combined talents, became their lifelong friend and champion.<br>
<br>In the 1930s Gielgud's seasons at the New (later Albery) Theatre and at the Queen's, reintroducing the classics to the commercial stage with a company yoking established stars with emerging talent (who included Ashcroft, Devine, Alec Guinness, and Laurence Olivier), established the nearest thing in London to a permanent ensemble between the Irving&#150;Tree era and the subsidized companies in the 1960s, and Motley was crucial to those seasons. In the course of some sixteen productions for Gielgud in that period their work&#151;innovatory in its insistence on design over decoration and in their use of unconventional (and often cheap) materials such as wool and felt&#151;effected a quiet revolution in British theatre design. Their workshops&#151;originally those of the cabinet-maker Thomas Chippendale&#151;opposite the New Theatre in St Martin's Lane, became a kind of informal club for adventurous young London theatrical talent.<br>
<br>Motley's greatest achievements over that time included Gordon Daviot's chronicle play <span class="italic">Richard of Bordeaux</span> (1933), with Gielgud as Richard II against versatile settings of swagged curtains, and Gielgud's 1934 <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, using an impressively flexible multi-level set with Cranach-inspired costumes. They also worked with Michel Saint-Denis, from the Compagnie des Quinze, directing Gielgud in Obey's <span class="italic">Noah</span> (1935) and on a dazzling <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> (1935), with Gielgud and Olivier alternating Romeo and Mercutio to Ashcroft's Juliet against a fluid Renaissance setting based on a central rotating tower.<br>
<br>Perhaps the summation of Motley's work with the Gielgud companies was the Queen's Theatre production of Chekhov's <span class="italic">Three Sisters</span> (1938), with an extraordinary cast under Saint-Denis that included Gielgud, Ashcroft, Devine, and Michael Redgrave. Motley's designs solved all the technical and logistical problems of the play, which has four settings. Peggy Ashcroft always said that she had never known a production suggest more potently the changing seasons of a play.<br>
<br>In 1939, just before the outbreak of war, Motley designed Gielgud's legendary production of Wilde's <span class="italic">The Importance of being Earnest</span>, with Edith Evans as Lady Bracknell to his Worthing. The sets, of subtly heightened naturalism, were much influenced by Gielgud's memories of the William Morris drawing rooms of a Holland Park house that he had visited as a boy.<br>
<br>When war broke out Elizabeth Montgomery and Margaret Harris were in America; Sophia on 27 October 1939 married George Devine and remained in England, where their only child, Harriet, was born. In America they worked on Olivier's New York production of <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> (1940), in which he was cast opposite Vivien Leigh. They remained in America throughout the war, their work including Motley's first excursions into ballet, working with Agnes de Mille on productions that included <span class="italic">Tally-Ho</span> (1944). Among their classical excursions was <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> (Alvin, New York, 1945), a startling production in a much-praised set of layered crags backed by a vast blue cyclorama.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Montgomery, who married the American writer Patrick Wilmot in 1956, remained in America for the next two decades, working mainly as a highly successful costume designer (still under the Motley name) on a range of productions from Broadway musicals (<span class="italic">South Pacific</span>, <span class="italic">Paint your Wagon</span>, and <span class="italic">Can-can</span>, for example) to opera, including sets and costumes for a stunning <span class="italic">Il trovatore</span> (Metropolitan Opera, 1959). She also worked in the burgeoning American regional theatre, including a production of <span class="italic">Troilus and Cressida</span> set during the American Civil War, for the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Connecticut (1961).<br>
<br>Back in England, Percy Harris resumed her career, often with Sophia's collaboration on costumes (Sophia was costume designer on many outstanding British films, including <span class="italic">The Innocents</span>, 1961, <span class="italic">This Sporting Life</span>, 1963, and <span class="italic">The Pumpkin Eater</span>, 1964). She picked up many of her &#145;family&#146; connections and once more worked with Gielgud and Ashcroft, on <span class="italic">The Heiress</span> (Haymarket, 1949). Further rewarding ventures with Ashcroft included a Devine production of <span class="italic">Hedda Gabler</span> (Hammersmith, 1954) against a much lighter setting than was then usual in Ibsen. This was a production of the peripatetic English Stage Company, which in 1956, under Devine, found a London home at the Royal Court Theatre. Its ideals derived from Gielgud's seasons and from the practice of Saint-Denis's ensemble that the author's text governed all production decisions. The designer Jocelyn Herbert (Devine's partner after his divorce from Sophia) defined its ethos as those involved saw it: &#145;an attitude to life, as well as to theatre&#146;  (Mullin, 126). Motley made crucial contributions to the early, pared-down Royal Court aesthetic, and designed productions that included a witty <span class="italic">Country Wife</span> (1956), using translucent plastic screens painted with line-drawings of period architectural details, and Ibsen's <span class="italic">Rosmersholm</span> (1959), with Ashcroft, played in bold relief against a back wall of four classical columns with a central double door. The firm also provided the costumes for the first production of John Osborne's <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span> (Royal Court, 1956).<br>
<br>Motley's work at Stratford in the 1950s under Glen Byam-Shaw (another graduate from Gielgud's 1930s seasons) was something of a golden age for the firm. Especially fine were the Ashcroft&#150;Michael Redgrave <span class="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span> (1953), using a simple, stepped permanent set with a variously lit backcloth to suggest changes of location, and a buoyant, constantly inventive <span class="italic">Merry Wives of Windsor</span> (1955). Motley and Byam-Shaw worked often in West End theatre productions too, including Terence Rattigan's <span class="italic">Ross</span> and another Ibsen&#151;<span class="italic">The Lady from the Sea</span> (Queen's, 1951)&#151;with shimmering gauzes suggesting the fjord-reflected light. The team also worked at the National Theatre, framing Olivier's Captain in a forbidding fortress setting for <span class="italic">The Dance of Death</span> (1967). Motley also designed the delicious drollery of No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">Hay Fever</span> in his own production for the National (1965), with Edith Evans and Maggie Smith.<br>
<br>Byam-Shaw was also the key partner in Motley's opera work in England, when Percy was head of design at Sadler's Wells and, later, for English National Opera (ENO) at the Coliseum. Her design work remained constantly fresh and technically adventurous, not least in a later operatic project, the British premi&egrave;re of Prokofiev's <span class="italic">War and Peace</span> (1974) for ENO, an extraordinary achievement using a background of constantly changing projections.<br>
<br>Following Sophia's death at her home, 9 Lower Mall, Hammersmith, on 27 March 1966, and with Elizabeth Montgomery increasingly inactive, Percy Harris&#151;before concentrating exclusively on the London-based design school that later bore the Motley name and continued its legacy&#151;designed a few productions under her own name, including a <span class="italic">Tosca</span> for ENO and Julian Mitchell's adaptation of Ivy Compton-Burnett's <span class="italic">A Family and a Fortune</span> (Apollo, 1975), with Alec Guinness&#151;a distillation of the best that Motley stood for. She used her unrivalled knowledge of the period to evoke the ossified world of a late-Edwardian household, with only a few brocaded walls, a trapezoid parquet floor, and rhythmically flown chandeliers. The power of the best theatrical design to suggest rather than naturalistically to reproduce was perfectly illustrated in this production, as it had been in so many others over half a century to bear the credit &#145;design by Motley&#146;.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Montgomery died at Barnes, Surrey, on 15 May 1993; Percy Harris died in Northwood, Middlesex, on 10 May 2000.<br>
