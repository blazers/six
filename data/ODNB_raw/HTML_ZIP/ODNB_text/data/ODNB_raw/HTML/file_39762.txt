<span class="headword">Seymour <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Boheme]</span>,  Anna Maria</span>  (<em>c.</em>1692&#150;1723), <span class="occ">actress</span>, is first recorded as playing Clara in Thomas Shadwell's <span class="italic">The Scowrers</span> on 22 August 1717, at Drury Lane. Most of her later appearances were with the Lincoln's Inn Fields company, which also included <a href="#cosubject_39762">Anthony Boheme [<i>see below</i>]</a>, whom she married on 18 May 1723. According to John Doran, Boheme &#145;took her off the stage&#146;, robbing the company of their &#145;best actress &hellip; to Ryan's great regret as she acted admirably up to him&#146;  (Doran, 374). The <span class="italic">British Journal</span> (13 April 1723), referring to the marriage, described her as &#145;that celebrated actress&#146;. She played Queen Elizabeth to Lacy Ryan's Richard in <span class="italic">Richard III</span> and Gertrude to his Hamlet. In fact she appeared as many times, if not more, with James Quin, playing, among other roles, Desdemona to his Othello, Lady Macbeth to his Macbeth, and Mrs Sullen to his Sullen (in George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span>). In the space of six years between her d&eacute;but at Lincoln's Inn Fields (11 October 1718), as Oriana in James Shirley's <span class="italic">The Traytor</span>, and her final appearance there, she appeared more than 150 times. By 1720 she was well on the way to becoming an established member of the company. Thomas Davies cites her appearance as Mrs Page in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span> as &#145;the first play at Lincoln's Inn Fields to fix the attention of the public&#146;  (Davies, 1.139), and she continued to play this role throughout her career at the theatre. On this first occasion Boheme appeared as Slender; later he took the part of Shallow.<br>
<br>Mrs Seymour played on a number of occasions with her future husband, notably as the eponymous heroine in Elijah Fenton's <span class="italic">Mariamne</span>, which Doran describes as &#145;her one great creation&#146;  (Doran, 374). Her final appearance at Lincoln's Inn Fields, on 7 June 1723, was in this role. Boheme was Herod to her Mariamne, and an anonymous picture in the Bodleian Library, according to Highfill, shows them together in the play, although, if the date of the painting is 1726, it cannot show Anna Boheme as Mariamne. Other parts she acted with Boheme include Arpasia in Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">Tamerlane</span>, Cordelia, Cressida, Elvira in Joseph Addison's <span class="italic">Cato</span>, with Boheme this time playing Manuel, Isabella to his Angelo in <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span>, Tamara, Lady Macbeth, Jocasta (a role she also acted in Jane Robe's short-lived <span class="italic">The Fatal Legacy</span>), and Roxanne in Nathaniel Lee's <span class="italic">The Rival Queens</span>. However, her appearances were by no means all with Boheme: among other roles were Cynthia in a &#145;new drest&#146; revival of William Congreve's <span class="italic">The Double Dealer</span>, Lady Touchwood in the same play, and Laetitia in his <span class="italic">The Old Bachelor</span>; Lady Brute in Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Provok'd Wife</span>, Imoinda in Thomas Southerne's <span class="italic">Oroonoko</span>, Lady Macduff, Queen Isabel in <span class="italic">Richard II</span>, Sylvia in Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span>, and Aramante in a revival of <span class="italic">The Spanish Curate</span>, by Beaumont and Fletcher, with Boheme in the part of Bartolus. Like her husband-to-be, she created only a few new roles: Lady Meanwell in a new one-act farce, <span class="italic">The Chimera, or, An Hue or Cry to Change Alley</span> by Thomas Odell (January 1721); Isabella in <span class="italic">The Fair Captive</span> by Eliza Heywood (March 1721); and Sabrina in <span class="italic">Hibernia Freed</span> by William Phillips (February 1722).<br>
<br>Anna Seymour's marriage to Boheme was short-lived, for she died less than two months later in Norwich, perhaps on tour with her husband, on 10 July 1723. A report in the <span class="italic">Daily Journal</span> of 13 July carried the news of her death: &#145;that celebrated Actress Mrs Seymour &hellip; of a Fever the 10th Instant&#146;  (Avery, 2.730). It may be that she was already ill at the time of her marriage, for she was indisposed and unable to play Mrs Page in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span> on 21 March 1723, although she had recovered by 25 March and made a number of other appearances at the theatre before her final one (6 June 1723) as Mariamne.<br>
<br>Little is known about the early life of <a name="cosubject_39762"></a><span class="headword">Anthony Boheme</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1732)<span class="occ"></span>. Highfill suggests that he was probably in his forties by the time his name first occurs in theatrical records. Avery records his first appearance in the capital as 16 October 1718, at Lincoln's Inn Fields, in the role of Decius in <span class="italic">Cato</span>. According to Doran, he joined the company from Southwark fair, and continued to play there and at Bartholomew fair in the summers of 1720&#150;22. At the fairs he seems to have established a reputation for comedy, although his later reputation was built upon his playing of tragic roles. Performing in the same cast of that d&eacute;but performance at Lincoln's Inn Fields was Anna Seymour, as Lucia, who was later to become his wife. Both of them were to spend virtually all of their London careers at that theatre, although there were rumours of Boheme's imminent departure to Drury Lane at about the time of his marriage.<br>
<br>Boheme turned principally to tragic roles on joining the Lincoln's Inn Fields company. Many of these were Shakespearian, including King Lear, Shylock in <span class="italic">The Jew of Venice</span> (a version of <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>), Ulysses in <span class="italic">Troilus and Cressida</span>, Cassius in <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span>, Brabantio in <span class="italic">Othello</span>, Titus Andronicus, and Macbeth. Among other major established roles were Oedipus, Alexander in <span class="italic">The Rival Queens</span>, Theseus in Edmund Smith's <span class="italic">Phaedra and Hippolytus</span>, Priuli in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>, and Tamerlane. However, he seems to have created only a few roles: Lord Gracebank in <span class="italic">The Chimera</span>, Holly in <span class="italic">The Fair Captive</span>, Omar in John Sturmy's <span class="italic">Sesostris</span>, and O'Brien in <span class="italic">Hibernia Freed</span>.<br>
<br>After the death of Anna Seymour, Boheme married another actress from the company. Even less is known about her than his first wife, and only two appearances are recorded for her. His final performance appears to have been as Alvarez in Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Mistake</span>, on 26 October 1731. Boheme died in early January 1732. The <span class="italic">Daily Journal</span> of Monday 11 January 1732 reported that he had been interred at Greenwich the previous night: &#145;The Pall was supported by Mr Quin, Mr [Lacy] Ryan and 4 other Comedians&#146;.<br>
