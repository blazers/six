<span class="headword">Scully,  William Francis John</span>  (1821&#150;1906), <span class="occ">land speculator</span>, was born on 23 November 1821 at Kilfeacle House, co. Tipperary, Ireland, the youngest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24978/', "Denys Scully (1773&#150;1830)")</script>, barrister and political activist, and his wife, Catherine Eyre (<i>d</i>. 1843). One of his brothers was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24979/', "Vincent Scully (1810&#150;1871)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24978/', "Scully, Denys")</script>]. William Scully was born into a dynasty founded on command of the law, the assertion of Catholic claims, and commercial exploitation of land. He was sent to the Jesuit school at Stonyhurst, Lancashire, when aged fourteen, and he remained there for one school year. He was then apprenticed to a Dublin solicitor but did not proceed into the profession.<br>
<br>Scully devoted himself instead to the acquisition and management of land. The share of the family's landed holdings available for him was greatly increased with the death in 1842 of his eldest brother, James, who was brutally assassinated, apparently in revenge for harsh behaviour towards tenants. This did little to diminish the robustness of Scully's behaviour as a landlord. His passion for the use of advanced agricultural techniques, of which he had a thorough grasp, was an additional source of friction with his tenants. In August 1865 at Kilkenny crown court he was given a sentence of twelve months' imprisonment (which he may not have served), for striking the head of the wife of a tenant resisting the service of an eviction writ. In August 1868 he attempted to serve eviction notices on the tenants of Ballycohey, co. Tipperary, a recently acquired townland whose inhabitants had refused to accept new, highly restrictive leases. On 14 August, in a carefully planned ambush, two of Scully's party were killed and he himself received gunshot wounds. The affair was reported in sensational terms throughout Ireland and Britain. Even the most fervent upholders of landlord rights tended to agree that Scully's behaviour was insupportable, not least because of his personal participation in what convention saw as work proper to subordinates. The Ballycohey affray had a significant impact on Gladstone's perception of the Irish land question, and so on the genesis of the <span class="roman">Land Act</span> of 1870. Scully continued to be an Irish landlord almost to the end of his life but in 1870 he took up residence in London.<br>
<br>Starting in 1850 Scully also acquired land in Illinois, USA. From 1866 onwards this investment yielded profit and already by 1870 Scully was a dollar millionaire. Huge acquisitions that year in Kansas and Nebraska were added to subsequently. From his home in Holland Park, London, Scully methodically organized and managed a transatlantic landed empire which relied on systematic drainage, scientific soil improvement, a distinctive &#145;cash rent&#146; lease (the &#145;Scully lease&#146;), paternalistic estate regulation, a talented hand-picked management team, and intensive three-month visits every other year by Scully himself. By 1896 his American landholdings amounted to 250,000 acres. In October 1902 Scully was granted USA citizenship. He had been living in Washington, DC since 1900, but he returned to London later in 1902.<br>
<br>In 1851 Scully married Margaret Mary Sweetman of Dublin; they had three daughters before her death in 1861. On 10 February 1876 he married Enriqueta Angela Chynoweth (1849&#150;1932), of London, and they had three sons and one daughter. John Scully (1849&#150;1885) was the child from an earlier liaison of Scully's. His mother's name is not known, and he attended Rugby School at his father's expense and was later employed on the Scully estates in the USA. In his will (dated 1901, at Washington) William Scully explicitly disinherited the children of his first marriage for reasons that are unknown. An imperious response to anything or anyone that thwarted him was characteristic. In 1867 or 1868 he had reacted to a parish priest's criticism from the altar by becoming an Anglican, to the distress of his siblings, two of whom were nuns. He died at his home at 12 Holland Park, London, on 17 October 1906, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. He was survived by his second wife. Estimates of his wealth ranged between 10 and 50 million dollars.<br>
