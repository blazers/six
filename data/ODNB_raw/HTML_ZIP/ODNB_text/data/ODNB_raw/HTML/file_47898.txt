<span class="headword">Marks,  Harry Hananel</span>  (1855&#150;1916), <span class="occ">journalist, newspaper proprietor, and politician</span>, was born on 9 April 1855 in London, the fifth of six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34882/', "David Woolf Marks (1811&#150;1909)")</script>, eminent Hebrew scholar and chief rabbi of the West London Synagogue, and his wife, Cecilia (<i>d</i>. 1882), daughter of Moseley Woolf of Birmingham and his wife.<br>
<br>Marks attended University College School, London, from 1864 to 1868, before completing his formal education at the Athen&eacute;e Royale, Brussels. At the age of sixteen he travelled to New Orleans, where his father had friends, and remained in the United States until 1883. These were truly formative years. To the end of his life he admired American &#145;know-how&#146;. Marks married Annie Estelle Benjamin of Montreal in 1884; they had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>After a spell selling sewing machines Marks entered journalism on the strength of &#145;previous experience&#146;&#151;of which he had none. <i>Chutzpah</i> he had in abundance. He learned his trade on various Texas newspapers, &#145;the roughest and most thorough literary training that America offered&#146;  (<span class="italic">Financial News</span>, 27 Dec 1916). Marks moved to New York, working for the <span class="italic">New York World</span> from 1873 to 1878, and editing the <span class="italic">Daily Mining News</span> after 1880. A selection of his articles, published in 1882, included reflections on the &#145;precarious and Bohemian sort of existence&#146; of the American newspaper reporter. &#145;My own experience&#146;, he wrote, &#145;is that a gentleman can be a reporter, and still be a gentleman. But it is difficult&#146;  (Marks, <span class="italic">Small Change</span>, 10&#150;11). A master of irony, in 1879 Marks wrote and published himself <span class="italic">Down with the Jews! Meeting of the Society for Suppressing the Jewish Race</span>. This savaged those American politicians who sought to whip up hostility towards Jews.<br>
<br>While in New York, Marks combined journalism with speculation in mining and oil shares. Rumours of sharp practice followed him back to London in 1883; so too did the malicious accusation that he had defrauded and deserted the widow of a business associate with whom he had been intimate. Later, Marks sought to clear his name by suing George Butterfield, an aggrieved company promoter, who had published particulars of his alleged New York indiscretions. Marks failed to convince an Old Bailey jury, which found against him, though the judge made it clear that he regarded the verdict as perverse  (<span class="italic">Financial News</span>, 18 Dec 1890). Thereafter Marks never quite shook off the suspicion that he was rather shady.<br>
<br>By this time Marks had established himself as the chief proprietor and editor of the <span class="italic">Financial and Mining News</span>, London's first financial daily. Its d&eacute;but, on 23 January 1884, predated the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> (with which it merged in 1945) by four years. The <span class="italic">News</span> initiated a transformation in the British financial press, which had acquired a reputation for dullness. Marks imported cross-headings, short paragraphs, and a breezy style which irritated competitors but appealed to financial sector professionals and their clerks. The <span class="italic">News</span> also sold among the wider investing public whose interest it claimed to serve. It quickly developed into a crusading journal with a strong line in investigative company reporting. Exposing a vein of corruption in the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1888 was a major journalistic <i>coup</i>.<br>
<br>&#145;Yankee bounce&#146; triumphed over &#145;eighteen-hundred-and-fast-asleep conservatism of the old school&#146;  (<span class="italic">Financial News</span>, 29 April 1884). The <span class="italic">News</span> became the flagship of the new financial journalism, accessible as well as authoritative, which characterized the money pages of most London newspapers by 1900. There was, however, a darker side. Corruption was endemic in the largely unregulated financial sector and Marks was sorely tempted. In the late 1880s he appears to have used his newspaper to create a market for shares in the Rae (Transvaal) goldmine, unloading his holding through dummy vendors before the price collapsed. It also seems that Marks could be &#145;squared&#146; by company promoters anxious to secure a favourable reception for a new issue. Edward Hooley's explanation, in 1898, that he had given Marks &pound;17,000 prior to the flotation of the New Beeston Cycle Company because he was &#145;a friend&#146; failed to convince sceptics  (Porter, 8&#150;10). Such abuses were not uncommon among financial journalists at the time.<br>
<br>Marks entered politics in 1889 as a member of the first London county council. A Conservative with progressive inclinations, Marks was an unsuccessful parliamentary candidate at Bethnal Green in 1892. Three years later he gained a narrow victory at St George-in-the-East, another East End constituency, subsequently reinforcing his position when charges relating to corrupt electoral practices were not upheld in court. Although he stood down in 1900, Marks was later praised for his political work in London by Akers-Douglas, Conservative chief whip, who recalled &#145;a regular attendant and constant supporter of the Government, and a first-rate speaker&#146;  (Akers-Douglas to Cobb, 6 Feb 1904, Chilston MSS). In 1904 he re-entered parliament, winning a by-election at Thanet where he had built his principal residence, Callis Court, near Broadstairs. Opinion about Marks among Thanet Conservatives was divided: some of them believed that he was a &#145;dishonest rogue&#146; and unfit to sit in parliament, but he was popular among local working men, winning again in 1906 despite the intervention of a second Conservative candidate. He retired undefeated in 1910.<br>
<br>Marks suffered a stroke in 1909 and was thereafter in poor health. He retained, as editor-in-chief, a connection with the <span class="italic">Financial News</span>, interfering in its affairs to the intense irritation of Ellis Powell, who had succeeded him as editor. Powell's revenge, exacted posthumously, was to allege that Marks had tried to sell the paper to a German agent in 1915  (Kynaston, 78&#150;81). Marks died from complications of diabetes at 119A Mount Street, Mayfair, London, on 21 December 1916. His wife also died in 1916.<br>
