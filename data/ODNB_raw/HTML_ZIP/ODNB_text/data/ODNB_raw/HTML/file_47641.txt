<span class="headword">Love,  Joseph</span>  (1796&#150;1875), <span class="occ">colliery owner</span>, was born in co. Durham, but little else is known about his early life. Born into a poor family, he started work as a pit boy at the age of eight, and at fourteen he was supporting his parents. He subsequently moved from the pit to become an itinerant packman, selling soft goods around the colliery villages, and at the age of twenty-five he used his savings to open a shop. In 1825 he married Sarah, the daughter of Isaac Pearson, a prosperous timber merchant of North Shields. Love then became a speculative builder, winning profitable contracts for colliery housing before being ruined by a bank failure. He continued in the timber trade, selling pit props, and in 1840 he purchased Brancepeth colliery, his first pit. At that time the iron and steel industry, shipbuilding, and the railways were beginning a period of expansion in the north-east of England which created an immense demand for coal and the means to export it to London and beyond. Because of his entry into the coal industry in this period of highly profitable expansion, Love came to own or part-own six pits in mid-west Durham.<br>
<br>Love was prominent in the Methodist New Connexion. In 1819 he was on the plan as a preacher, and throughout his life he lived with discipline and frugality. Love funded chapels and chapel-related activities throughout the country, but especially in Durham. The neo-classical Bethel Chapel in Durham North Road was the most architecturally distinguished monument to his generosity. He also supported overseas missions in Canada and Australia. Towards the end of his life Love was plagued by frequent requests to clear the debts of New Connexion chapels that he considered ill managed, notably the Chelsea Chapel. In 1873 he wrote that he felt like advertising that &#145;I have washed my hands of the New Connexion, being fairly pressed out&#146;  (William Cooke Collection, John Rylands Library). By this time he was suffering from the wasting disease that was to lead to his death. He does not seem to have acted on his threat by the time of his death, though the relative absence of published obituaries and eulogies, especially in the Methodist press, suggests some distancing of Love from his previous commitments. None the less, Dr Cooke, the president of the Methodist New Connexion, preached at Love's memorial service and a chapel was dedicated to his memory shortly afterwards.<br>
<br>Methodist accounts of Love record a life of piety and good works. But a different Love appears in the records of the labour and trade union movement, leading one historian to conclude that &#145;Mr Love's business actions were in sharp contrast to the piety of his private life &hellip; He belonged to a school which had learned well the lesson, to hide from the right hand what its left hand did&#146;  (Welbourne, 121). Love gave key managerial posts in his enterprises to his relatives, and it was a cause of complaint that others could not gain promotion. He victimized men who supported trade unionism and was instrumental in breaking the third union of the Durham and Northumberland miners in 1863 through the &#145;rocking&#146; strike in his pits (1863&#150;4). The men working in low seams were unable to fill their tubs sufficiently to prevent the coal settling below the rim during the journey to the surface. The men claimed they were paid nothing for each such tub. When they went on strike Love evicted the miners and their families from their homes, in severe winter weather, and he cut their credit through his role as the shopkeepers' landlord. His actions earned the hostility of both the Durham newspapers and <span class="italic">The Times</span>, in whose letter columns Love sought to defend his actions.<br>
<br>Joseph Love was important in the history of British entrepreneurialism. Like many other businessmen he was able to reconcile his Methodism with running a business empire in harshly competitive conditions. He also represented a phase of British capitalism in which labour and capital met face to face. Later employers were able to acquire anonymity, protecting their interests behind the names of joint-stock companies, while their private lives became increasingly remote from those of their employees. Unlike these corporate owners of modern firms Love was in close contact with his enterprises and the daily life of his workforce. He was unable, therefore, to avoid facing the conflict between his own economic interests and the welfare of his workers. Nevertheless, Love was very successful: he was one of a small group of nineteenth-century figures to rise from a working-class background to riches through hard work, frugality, and enterprise&#151;an exemplar of Samuel Smiles's &#145;self-help&#146;. He died on 21 February 1875 at his house, Mount Beulah, Durham, and left an estate worth about &pound;1 million to his wife, making her one of the richest women in Britain. Their one child, Isaac Pearson Love, predeceased Joseph.<br>
