</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lake,  Gerard</span>, first Viscount Lake of Delhi  (1744&#150;1808), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, the elder son of Lancelot Charles Lake (<i>d</i>. 1751) of Flambards, Harrow on the Hill, Middlesex, and his wife, Letitia (<i>d</i>. 1760), daughter of John Gumley, glass manufacturer and army contractor, of Isleworth, Middlesex, was born on 27 July 1744.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareerandparliament"></a>Early career and parliament</h2>Educated at Eton College (1755&#150;6), he was appointed ensign in the 1st foot guards on 9 May 1758, and served with the 2nd battalion in the campaigns in Germany in 1760&#150;62. After displaying enterprise at the battle of Wilhelmstadt, near Kassel, he was appointed aide-de-camp to General Sir Richard Pearson, and lieutenant and captain on 3 January 1762. He married on 26 June 1770 Elizabeth (1751&#150;1798), only daughter of Edward Barker, sometime consul at Tripoli, of St Julian's, Hertfordshire: they had three sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>In 1776 Lake was promoted captain and lieutenant-colonel and appointed to the household of the prince of Wales, probably because the king hoped he would have a beneficial influence on the prince. His relationship with the prince was close, at least in the early years. In 1781 he went with drafts to America and served in the campaign in North Carolina under Lord Cornwallis. With the force trapped in Yorktown at the end of September 1781, on 16 October he led one element of a desperate attempt under Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Abercromby to force redoubts and destroy guns threatening the encampment. After the surrender of Yorktown, Lake was a prisoner on parole until the end of the war. He was appointed a regimental major on 20 October 1784.<br>
<br>First equerry to the prince of Wales, 1780&#150;86 and 1787&#150;96, and gentleman attendant on him from 1796 until his death, Lake devoted several years chiefly to managing the prince's stables. He also indulged his own passion for gambling. At a by-election in 1789 he unsuccessfully contested the venal householder borough of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. Supported by his fellow members of the Buckinghamshire Independent Club, led by the duke of Portland, Lake spent lavishly at Aylesbury. He was elected unopposed at the 1790 general election, and again in 1796. He voted with the whig opposition on the Ochakov question (April 1791 and March 1792), and in December 1792 was listed as &#145;supposed attached&#146; to the duke of Portland. He retired from parliament at the 1802 dissolution.<br>
<br>Lake became a major-general in 1790 and a regimental lieutenant-colonel in 1792. In February 1793 he embarked in command of a brigade composed of the 1st battalions of the three regiments of foot guards. This force was present at the siege of Valenciennes and achieved a significant if costly local victory against the French at Lincelles, near Lille. Lake was invalided home in September 1793 and, although able to rejoin the duke of York briefly the following year, was again sent home in April 1794. That month he was appointed colonel of the 53rd foot and in November 1796 transferred to the 73rd foot.<h2>
<a name="Ireland17961798"></a>Ireland 1796&#150;1798</h2>In December 1796 Lake was appointed to the command in Ulster, under Henry Luttrell (later Lord Carhampton) as commander-in-chief. He became a lieutenant-general in January 1797. In early spring 1797 Lake, in command of a mixed force of militia, yeomanry, and fencibles, was ordered by John Jeffreys, Earl Camden (lord lieutenant 1795&#150;8), to use all methods to disarm Ulster. The Irish government &#145;meant to strike terror&#146;  (Camden to Portland, 3 Nov 1797, Bartlett, 270) and the harsh measures of house burning, flogging, and mass arrests greatly weakened the United Irishmen and secured large quantities of arms. When General Sir Ralph Abercromby, commander-in-chief from late 1797, who had indicated his disapproval of the policy of Dublin Castle, in February 1798 issued a general order condemning the absence of control of the Irish armed forces, especially the militia, Camden welcomed his resignation, and Lake succeeded to the command on 25 April 1798.<br>
<br>Lake again used harsh methods, including an order to take no prisoners, following the outbreak of rebellion in the south of Ireland on 24 May 1798. Although the rebels gained Wexford, they failed in an assault on Arklow and withdrew. After reinforcements arrived from England, Lake was able to assemble the army which, after an artillery attack and two hours of desperate fighting at Vinegar Hill, near Enniscorthy, finally crushed the rebellion in Wexford; Lake entered Wexford on 22 June 1798. Following the arrival of Cornwallis as lord lieutenant and commander-in-chief on 20 June 1798, Lake reverted to the command in Leitrim. After a French force of some 1100 men commanded by General Joseph Humbert landed in Killala Bay in late August, Lake was sent to Galway. Lake confronted the French at Castlebar with a mixed force of Irish militia, English and Scottish fencibles, and some regulars. His force broke in panic before a French bayonet charge. However, other detachments converged on Humbert, who had not been reinforced from France, and on 8 September the French surrendered at Ballinamuck. Lake was elected to the Irish parliament as member for Armagh to help secure passage of the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span>, but left Ireland in 1799.<h2>
<a name="India18011807"></a>India, 1801&#150;1807</h2>In 1800 Lake was appointed commander-in-chief and second member of the supreme council in India. After landing at Calcutta on 31 January 1801, and making an initial tour of inspection, he set up his headquarters at Cawnpore. He devoted much attention to improving military method in the Bengal army and introduced galloper guns into the cavalry and light troops into the infantry. After the conclusion of a treaty with the nawab of Oudh in November 1801, Lake was involved in the spring of 1802 in the pacification of parts of the Jumna-Ganges Doab, including the territory of Balwant Singh of Sasni.<br>
<br>The Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803&#150;5) was the climax of Lake's military career. In March 1803, following the conclusion of the treaty of Bassein with the Peshwa Baji Rao, the Madras government assembled a considerable force in the northern part of Mysore, to aid him in the restoration of his authority within the Maratha confederacy. The governor-general, Richard, Marquess Wellesley, left it to Lake to decide whether he should command this force himself or remain in Oudh. As the force assembled at Harihar under the command of Major-General Arthur Wellesley moved forward into Maratha territory, Lake prepared the force in Oudh designed to bring pressure on Daulat Rao Sindhia of Ujjain to accept the changed relationship of the Peshwa to the East India Company. Lake knew that the French adventurer General Perron, whose control of part of northern India under the nominal sovereignty of Sindhia amounted to independent statehood, was both creating a further brigade of infantry and seeking permission from Wellesley to withdraw into British territory. In early May 1803 Lake was directed to prepare a force to be based near the Jumna for use after the monsoon. The movement of Raghoji Bhonsla of Nagpur with his army to unite with Sindhia in early June was seen as indicating a hostile intention, and at the end of June Lake took precautionary measures. Word of these crossed with instructions from the governor-general that gave to both Lake and Arthur Wellesley wide delegated political and military powers. The alliance of the Maratha rulers was expected to &#145;vanish upon the approach of the British force&#146;  (R. Wellesley to Lake, 28 June 1803, <span class="italic">Despatches</span>, 3.164). This optimism was shared by Lake: &#145;I think Perron once beat &hellip; little is to be apprehended&#146;  (Lake to R. Wellesley, 9 July 1803, BL, Add. MS 13742, fol. 46). The governor-general sent Graeme Mercer as a political adviser. Lake, who had visited Agra, felt able to assure Fort William that he would consider its seizure &#145;by a <i>coup de main</i>&#146;  (Lake to M. Shawe, 17 July 1803, BL, Add. MS 13741, fol. 144). Lake had information on the deployment and the strength of Perron's force, hoped to negotiate the withdrawal of Perron from the command of Sindhia's army in Hindustan, and believed that some of his European officers could be suborned.<br>
<br>Lake moved forward, planning to proceed to the frontier, &#145;where I shall assemble my force and where I shall hope shortly to accomplish your wishes, by negotiation or otherwise&#146;  (Lake to Marquess Wellesley, 2 Aug 1803, BL, Add. MS 13742, fol. 101). He considered that letters from the Deccan &#145;fully authorise me &hellip; to commence hostilities if M. Perron does not incline to negotiation, which from his opening a correspondence with me I rather believe he does&#146;  (Lake to Marquess Wellesley, 10 Aug 1803, BL, Add. MS 13741, fol. 151). By 18 August Lake knew that Perron was removing treasure from Coel, possibly to Agra. Four days later he had confirmation of the intended desertion of officers in the service of Sindhia. On 27 August the force of three brigades of cavalry, four of infantry, and 65 guns crossed the Maratha frontier.<br>
<br>On 29 August Lake was able to displace a Maratha infantry and cavalry force and establish a position before Aligarh. He hoped to secure this fortress by bribery, but on 4 September resolved to attempt it by assault. It was captured by an hour's heavy fighting, aided by guidance of an officer who had recently left Sindhia's service. Perron negotiated with Lake, and secured a personal safe conduct. Lake moved forwards towards Delhi. On 11 September at Patpanganj the pickets found the Maratha army encamped in a strong position at close quarters. Lake reconnoitred, and attempted an assault with cavalry, who were exposed to casualties from Maratha artillery. He then feigned a withdrawal with the cavalry, which led the Maratha brigades incautiously to move forward, and moved his own infantry through the cavalry and then ordered a general charge with the bayonet. The Marathas retreated headlong, suffering some 3000 casualties, against British casualties of about 350. Lake could now move towards Delhi, and on 15 September was able to report that a group of French officers formerly in the service of Sindhia had surrendered. One of the symbolic scenes in the history of British India followed on 16 September, when Lake was received in the Red Fort by the Mughal emperor Shah Alam.<br>
<br>Lake engaged irregular forces lately in the service of Perron for service with the British forces, and was able to report that &#145;no French officer of any consequence now remains in Sindhia's service&#146;  (Lake to R. Wellesley, 1 Oct 1803, <span class="italic">Despatches</span>, 3.390). Lake moved on to Agra, where the sepoys had arrested their European officers, but had no single alternative leader. Lake attempted, as he had done at Aligarh, to secure the fort by offering liberal terms of surrender, but this venture failed. On 10 October in an expensive operation, involving heavy casualties on both sides, Lake, using only Indian troops, took possession of the town and cleared the ravines to the south of the fort of Maratha forces. In the ravines was placed a powerful siege battery, the effectiveness of which led the divided garrison within the fort to release a French officer and through him agree terms of surrender. The extensive treasure in the fortress was distributed to the troops as prize money.<br>
<br>Lake had known in early July that an extensive reinforcement of disciplined infantry had been sent northwards by Sindhia from the Deccan. They had been commanded in the first instance by the Frenchman Dudrenec, who deserted, and were now led by Ambaji Inglia, who, having been appointed by Sindhia to succeed Perron, himself had ambitions to rule again in Hindustan, and secretly negotiated with Lake. These forces moved away from Agra towards Jaipur. Lake left his heavy artillery, and by forced marches, eventually with cavalry only, arrived in the environs of the entire Maratha force, near Laswari. Lake ordered a cavalry assault which, although it pressed home, failed to dislodge the Maratha artillery and supporting infantry. There was a lull in the fighting during the middle of 1 November. On the British side the infantry had now arrived. On the Maratha, battalions not involved in the morning fighting had rejoined, and a double line of defences was created near the walled village of Mohalpur. Ambaji Inglia offered a conditional withdrawal secured by surrender of his guns, but failed to complete the negotiation in the limited time allowed. In a second attack with both infantry and cavalry, Lake attempted to outflank the Maratha position, which was strongly protected by artillery. The 76th suffered severely and Lake saved its position with a cavalry charge. He personally led two sepoy regiments in an attack on Mohalpur, while on the Maratha left flank the Deccani cavalry were put to flight, and the circle of cavalry units about the doomed Maratha infantry was completed by the movement of the two other brigades. A costly victory (822 men killed and wounded of a total force of 8000) at Laswari was also complete. It had, as Lake explained to Lord Wellesley, annihilated the regular force in northern India in Sindhia's service commanded by French officers.<br>
<br>In negotiation Lake and Mercer now secured the transfer of the fortress of Gwalior and the conclusion with Ambaji Inglia of a treaty, destined not to be honoured, which gave him a position as a British ally. When troops were moved forward to secure Gwalior, the commander refused to yield it, although within twenty-four hours it was secured by negotiation: Ambaji Inglia was later informed that the action of the commandant had rendered the treaty with him invalid. Meantime, in the Deccan campaign of 1803, Arthur Wellesley had successively defeated the formed brigades of Sindhia at Assaye on 23 September and a force of both Sindhia and Raghoji Bhonsla at Argaon on 30 November, and captured Gawilgarh on 15 December. After negotiations conducted in his camp, Arthur Wellesley concluded the treaty of Deogaon on 17 December with Raghoji Bhonsla and, on 30 December, the treaty of Sarji Arjangaon with Daulat Rao Sindhia, securing as a result of the two campaigns, his own and that of Lake, extensive territorial cessions.<br>
<br>The other major Maratha, Jaswant Rao Holkar, had stood aloof from the events of 1803, and while Sindhia and Bhonsla were preoccupied, had plundered extensively in central India. Lake sent to the governor-general letters from Holkar, friendly in tone, but noted that Holkar's &#145;actions do not appear to accord with his words&#146;  (Lake to Lord Wellesley, 28 Dec 1803, <span class="italic">Despatches</span>, 3.556). While hoping to avert hostilities, Lord Wellesley again gave Lake delegated political authority. Holkar agreed to send agents to negotiate, but continued to attempt to create hostile alliances. The agents presented hubristic demands in Lake's camp on 18 and 19 March 1804, and these Lake and Mercer rejected. In April Lake reported that he saw little prospect of peace with Holkar, and that forbearance had been ineffective. He feared that if he advanced, Holkar would enter and pillage recently acquired territory. On 16 May Lord Wellesley determined to initiate hostilities against Holkar, relying on a prospect of support from Sindhia, with whom a subsidiary alliance treaty had been concluded.<br>
<br>Holkar withdrew precipitately from before Jaipur, after Lake had moved forward a detachment under Colonel the Hon. W. Monson, which was ordered to secure passes near Bundi and Lakheri. A limited force from Sindhia moved north from Ujjain. But Holkar had withdrawn onto his strength, artillery and infantry. Although Monson was able to move beyond Bundi through the Mukhandra Pass and capture Hinglaishghar, the news of a retreat near Badnawar on 1 July of a force under Colonel Murray that had advanced from Gujarat led Monson in turn to withdraw, and at this point Holkar was able to turn his full force upon him. An initial limited retreat, at first to Rampura, became by the persistent pressure of Holkar a disordered rout, ultimately to Agra at the end of August, with extensive desertions of both regular and irregular forces.<br>
<br>To attempt to reverse the consequences of this defeat, Lake marched from Cawnpore on 2 September 1804, and reached Agra by the end of the month. Holkar besieged Delhi, and its capture was averted by a skilled defence commanded by Colonels David Ocherlony and James Burn. When Holkar attempted a cavalry irruption into British territory east of the Jumna, Lake after some noteworthy forced marches defeated him with a cavalry force at Farrukhabad on 16 November. General J. H. Fraser had meantime defeated an infantry and artillery concentration near Dig. The reunited army achieved the capture of the fortress of Dig on 25 December. Lake turned to the siege of Bharatpur, whose raja had repudiated an earlier subsidiary alliance, although having &#145;at his disposal fewer than 8,000 men and less than eighty pieces of ordnance&#146;  (Pemble, 388). The first two rushed attacks failed because the batteries had been laid too far from the walls and there had been insufficient reconnaissance. In a third assault the trench designed to give the storming parties cover was inadequate and the troops were exposed to withering fire. The fourth assault failed because the ladders were too few and too short. Ironically, after such a costly and prolonged blunder (450 men had been killed and 2500 wounded) word of Lake's appointment to the peerage arrived at this point&#151;he was created Baron Lake of Delhi and Laswary and Aston Clinton, Buckinghamshire, on 13 September 1804&#151;and the raja agreed to terms. The army had been before Bharatpur for three months and twenty days.<br>
<br>Holkar had not been within Bharatpur, although his cavalry had contributed to the harrying of attackers and of convoys. In the last stages of the siege Mir Khan, one of the most successful of Holkar's commanders, had attempted a prolonged incursion into Rohilkhand, from which he had been expelled. At the same time Sindhia, who had permitted an attack on the camp of the British resident, moved north, ostensibly to mediate between the company and Holkar, but in reality with the intention of joining him. The combined forces of Sindhia and Holkar were assessed as 5000 regular infantry, 12,000 silledar horse, 12,000 pindaries, and 146 guns. Lake deployed his force during the monsoon in advanced positions and the two Maratha chiefs quarrelled, separated, and withdrew. At the end of his governor-generalship, when about to be succeeded by Lord Cornwallis, Lord Wellelsey again authorized Lake, now stationed at Mathura, to make preparations for active operations.<br>
<br>Instructions from Cornwallis led to a rift between himself and Lake. Cornwallis considered the British in India over-extended; there were constant &#145;calls for reinforcements of men and for remittances of money&#146; but &#145;little other profit except brilliant Gazettes&#146;  (Cornwallis to Lake, 30 Aug 1805, <span class="italic">Correspondence of &hellip; Cornwallis</span>, 3.544). Lake reacted badly to a statement by Cornwallis of their respective authority, Cornwallis having been again appointed, as in 1786, governor-general and commander-in-chief. Instructions from Cornwallis gave authority for an approach to Sindhia to secure a peace settlement, negotiated by Colonel John Malcolm and concluded in the treaty of Mustaphapur on 22 November. This settlement was significantly varied by Sir George Barlow, who had succeeded as governor-general on the death of Cornwallis (5 October 1805), under protest from Lake, in a way that ended British connections with states to the south and west of the Jumna. Lake at the same time received instructions drastically to reduce irregular forces to stem the drain on the finances. Lake formed a defensive line against Holkar, and in early November, as Holkar escaped into Sikh territory, attempted to secure their co-operation against &#145;a plunderer whose existence in any degree of power is I fear incompatible with the full restoration of peace in India&#146;  (Lake to Barlow, 11 Nov 1805, BL, Add. MS 13605, fol. 191). On receiving from Barlow instructions on a peace settlement with Holkar, which would transfer to Holkar extensive territories, including areas south of the Tapti, Lake followed him into the Punjab, crossing the Sutlej, and on the banks of the Beas, Malcolm presented agents from Holkar with a draft treaty, to be ratified in a limited time. An attempt to vary its terms was rejected, and on 7 January 1806 Lake was able to send Barlow the text of an agreed treaty. Barlow varied this treaty also, again under protest from Lake, giving further territorial cessions to Holkar. Lake then slowly withdrew his army, pausing at Delhi to complete arrangements with the Mughal emperor, proceeded to Cawnpore, and thence to Calcutta. He sailed for Britain on 9 February 1807.<h2>
<a name="Lastperiod18071808"></a>Last period, 1807&#150;1808</h2>Lake was advanced to a viscountcy under the same designation as his barony on 4 November 1807 and took his seat in the House of Lords on 21 January 1808. He held various sinecures, including the receiver-generalship of the duchy of Cornwall from March 1807. Following a violent cold, caught while attending the court martial at Chelsea on 18 February, of Lieutenant-General Whitelocke, Lake died at his residence in Lower Brook Street, London, on 20 February 1808, aged sixty-three; he was buried on 5 March 1808 at Aston Clinton.<br>
<br>A soldier's general, Lake achieved much on the battlefield by ferocious energy and tactical skill. Lake could command, and he retained the adherence of his soldiers. But he lacked political skill and the capacity to interpret intelligence, and by his misjudgment of Holkar in 1804 and his impetuosity before Bharatpur in 1805 he contributed to the failure of the last year of the governor-generalship of Richard Wellesley. He professed indifference to money and, despite gaining considerable prize money in 1803, his massive accumulated gambling debts ensured he did not die wealthy. On 29 February in the House of Commons, Lord Castlereagh proposed a pension of &pound;2000 to Lake's next two heirs in succession. After a long debate&#151;in which opposition MPs opposed the pension and the reformer William Smith claimed that Lake had &#145;brought &pound;140,000 from India, although the property of which he died possessed did not exceed &pound;40,000 with an estate of &pound;800 a year&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 248)&#151;the pension of &pound;2000 was settled on the next two successors to the title, which became extinct after the death of Lake's second son, Warwick, the third viscount, on 24 June 1848.<br>
