<span class="headword">Pott,  Alfred</span>  (1822&#150;1908), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and college head</span>, was born on 30 September 1822 at Norwood, Surrey, the second son of Charles Pott of Norwood and Anna, daughter of C. S. Cox, master in chancery. From 1838 he was educated at Eton College under Edward Craven Hawtrey, and he matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, on 15 December 1840. Having been elected to a demyship at Magdalen College in 1843, he graduated BA in 1844 with a second class in <i>literae humaniores</i>, and in the following year he won the Johnson theological scholarship. He was treasurer in 1844 and president and librarian in 1845 of the Oxford Union. He proceeded MA in 1847, and BD in 1854. Ordained deacon in December 1845 and priest in the following year, in 1847 he became curate of Cuddesdon, and in 1852 vicar on the nomination of Bishop Samuel Wilberforce. In 1853 he was elected a fellow of Magdalen College.<br>
<br>In 1851 Wilberforce had given Pott the task of building a theological college opposite the bishop's palace in Cuddesdon, near Oxford. As first principal he stressed the task of &#145;forming character and moulding habits&#146;  (Chadwick, 32), which subsequently influenced theological education far beyond Cuddesdon. Because of his own modesty, his work as rural dean, and his lengthy periods of illness, he was somewhat overshadowed by his far more uncompromising vice-principal, Henry Parry Liddon. As principal he lectured on the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and he also published a number of sermons and addresses he had given to the people of the village; his <span class="italic">Confirmation Lectures</span> (1852) reached a fifth edition in 1886. On 5 July 1855 he married Emily Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1903), daughter of Joseph Gibbs, vicar of Clifton Hampden, Oxfordshire. Their only daughter was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41259/', "Gladys Sydney Pott (1867&#150;1961)")</script>, anti-suffragist and civil servant.<br>
<br>Pott resigned as principal owing to ill health shortly after Charles Pourtales Golightly had called attention to ritualist and Romanizing practices of the Cuddesdon system. Pott's judicious defence against these charges, together with his high standing in the diocese and his appointment of Edward King (1829&#150;1910) as chaplain &#145;to change the tone&#146; of the college, did much to allay the fears among the clergy, and to secure the future of residential graduate theological education.<br>
<br>In 1858 Pott accepted the living of East Hendred, Berkshire, though he once again took on the running of Cuddesdon College following his successor's death in 1862 until Edward King's appointment in 1863. He became vicar and rural dean of nearby Abingdon in 1867, remaining so until 1875. Bishop Wilberforce appointed Pott one of his examining chaplains (a position he retained on Wilberforce's translation to Winchester in 1869). He was made an honorary canon of Christ Church in 1868, and in 1869 Wilberforce preferred him to the archdeaconry of Berkshire. Wilberforce had hoped to have Pott elevated to the episcopate, but after his sudden death in 1873, Pott lost his chief mentor. He subsequently held the benefices of Clifton Hampden (1875&#150;82) and of Sonning, Berkshire (1882&#150;99). He resigned the archdeaconry in 1903, but retained his honorary canonry. In convocation, though only an occasional speaker, Pott was a recognized authority on ecclesiastical law; and as archdeacon he showed wisdom, justice, and judgement. Although a high-churchman, he was never a party man and enjoyed the friendship of those of widely divergent opinions. After the publication of R. G. Wilberforce's <span class="italic">Life of the Right Revd Samuel Wilberforce</span> in 1882 Pott destroyed all his own private papers and diaries for undisclosed reasons, and wrote a brief autobiographical sketch (now lost) for the use of the family.<br>
<br>Pott died at his home, Woodside, Windlesham, Surrey, on 28 February 1908, and was buried at Clifton Hampden churchyard.<br>
