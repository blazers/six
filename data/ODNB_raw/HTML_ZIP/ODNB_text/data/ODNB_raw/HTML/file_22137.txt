<span class="headword">Phillimore,  Joseph</span>  (1775&#150;1855), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born on 14 September 1775, the eldest son of Joseph Phillimore of Kensington, vicar of Orton on the Hill, Leicestershire, and Mary, daughter of John Machin of Kensington. He was educated at Westminster School, London, and Christ Church, Oxford, and matriculated on 30 May 1793; he graduated BA on 4 May 1797, BCL on 30 April 1800, and DCL on 20 January 1804. He won prizes at Christ Church for Latin verse (1793) and prose (1798), and the university English essay prize (1798) for his dissertation, &#145;Chivalry&#146;.<br>
<br>In December 1806 Francis Horner reported that &#145;that little, inconstant fluttering Philander Phillimore is to be married&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>, 795), and on 19 March 1807 Phillimore married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1859), daughter of Walter Bagot, rector of Blithfield and Leigh, Staffordshire, and precentor of St Asaph, younger brother of William, first Lord Bagot. Six sons and two daughters survived childhood. One son drowned at Oxford, with the son of the dean of Christ Church, who attempted a rescue; Phillimore's two sons <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22136/', "John George Phillimore")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22138/', "Robert Joseph Phillimore")</script> became celebrated lawyers, and a further son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22134/', "Greville Phillimore")</script>, was a priest and author.<br>
<br>Admitted an advocate to Doctors' Commons (21 November 1804), Phillimore served as librarian there in 1816&#150;17 and treasurer in 1818&#150;20. He practised in the ecclesiastical and Admiralty courts, and in 1806&#150;7 was commissioner for the disposal of Prussian and Danish ships seized after Prussian violations of Hanoverian neutrality, and Denmark's submission to France. In 1809 he succeeded Dr French Laurence as regius professor of civil law at Oxford, diocesan chancellor of Oxford, and judge of the Cinque Ports Admiralty Court, but his wish to become chancellor of Durham failed. Seen as a prospective parliamentary candidate for Oxford University, on 17 March 1817 he was returned, supporting Lord Grenville, for St Mawes, Cornwall, the seat vacated on the death of his friend Francis Horner; Phillimore represented the constituency until the dissolution of 2 June 1826. He then represented Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, from 9 June 1826 until 24 July 1830, after which he was unable to find a seat.<br>
<br>In his maiden speech, on 5 May 1817, Phillimore opposed the <span class="roman">London Tithes Bill</span>, securing postponement. He was an original member of Grenville's short-lived third party in 1818. On 9 May 1817 he advocated Catholic relief, a subject upon which he published fifteen letters in the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> under the name of Philopatris (some of which were reprinted in a pamphlet). In 1819 he debated metropolitan prisons, building new churches, the <span class="roman">Marriage Act</span>, and international law, informing the house that civil lawyers did not seek commissions to suppress slave trading as the salaries were insufficient. From its reconstitution in February 1822, he joined the Indian Board of Control until the end of Lord Goderich's administration in January 1828; and on 23 January 1833 he became a principal commissioner adjudicating French claims under the treaties of 1815 and 1818. He presided over and drafted the report of the registration commission, dated 13 September 1836. Acting as surrogate Admiralty judge, in 1831 Phillimore established, importantly, the award of salvage to captors of royal fish. Although his candidature had been frustrated three times before, on 25 October 1834 he was appointed king's advocate in the Admiralty court, where he had been a beneficiary of the practice, pioneered the previous century by Lord Mansfield, of bringing civil lawyers into king's bench to argue maritime causes. He held this post until his death. Phillimore became commissary of the dean and chapter of St Paul's (1834), and diocesan chancellor of Worcester (1834), Bristol (1842), and Gloucester (1846). He received an honorary LLD degree at Cambridge in 1834 and was elected FRS in 1840. Lord Lyndhurst, introducing a bill to reform ecclesiastical courts on 2 March 1844, praised Phillimore's chancellorships.<br>
<br>After contributions to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> (notably in 1811 on abuses of the licence trade by neutral ships), Phillimore fuelled developments in the ecclesiastical law doctrine of precedent by editing reports of cases determined by Sir George Lee in the arches and prerogative courts of Canterbury between 1752 and 1758 (published in 1833), and by others in the ecclesiastical courts at Doctors' Commons and the high court of delegates between 1809 and 1821 (published between 1818 and 1827). He gave evidence to the 1832 commission on the reform of the church courts. As regius professor he assisted in Lord Grenville's appointment as chancellor of Oxford University in 1809, and he was remembered for his Latin oratory at commemorations, impressing visiting allied sovereigns in 1814: the Prussian king asked personally for a copy of Phillimore's speech. His Sheldon Theatre speeches at three commemorations in 1834, the chancellor (the duke of Wellington) presiding personally, were printed the same year. Phillimore gave evidence to the royal commission on the state of the university and its colleges, recalling that, with respect to his professorship, he could be neither expected nor required to abandon his legal practice in London; on several occasions he wanted to give a course of lectures but was not encouraged to do so. He retained his chair until his death at his home, Shiplake House, near Reading, on 24 January 1855. Sydney Smith described Phillimore as &#145;an excellent man but not intended by nature for a giver of opinions&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>, 796).<br>
