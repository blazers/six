<span class="headword">Copland <span class="st"> [Coplande]</span>,  Robert <span class="st"> [Roberte]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em>1505&#150;1547), <span class="occ">translator and printer</span>, began his career in Wynkyn de Worde's shop. Because in his poem <span class="italic">Hye Way</span> one of the beggars tells &#145;Copland&#146; that he is:<blockquote>
<div>And lyke your maystershyp<br>
</div>
<div>of the north<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Francis suggested a northern origin for the printer  (Francis, 9), but Hazlitt's reading &#145;If it please your mastership, of the north&#146; is more likely  (<span class="italic">Remains of the Early Popular Poetry</span>, 4 vols., 1864&#150;6, 1.336). It has been suggested that Copland was Caxton's apprentice, because of Copland's statement in his preface to <span class="italic">Kynge Appolyn of Thyre</span> (before 1510) that he was &#145;gladly folowynge the trace of my mayster Caxton begynnyng wyth small storyes and pamfletes and so to other&#146;. In addition, about 1505 Copland had called his translation <span class="italic">A Complaynt of them that be to Soone Maryed</span> his &#145;fyrst werke&#146;. If he were between twenty and twenty-four in this year, however, Copland's birth date would lie between 1485 and 1481&#151;too late for him to have been Caxton's apprentice before the latter's death in 1491. Hence Copland's reference to &#145;my mayster&#146; probably indicates only his respect for the patron and employer of his own undoubted master, Wynkyn de Worde. Anthony Wood's belief that &#145;R. Copland and E. More had as it seems spent some time in Oxon, in the condition of poor scholars&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.249&#150;50) is refuted by Copland's own statement that &#145;in scole nor countre / I never take effect&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Castell of Pleasure</span>, C6v). The will of Cecilye Clowgh, &#145;wedow of the parisshe of Seynt Bride the Virgin&#146;, tentatively dated 28 January 1543, provides a bequest to &#145;my ostis Coplonde&#146;  (Darlington, 84), who was perhaps the printer's wife, in view of the date and the parish, since Copland's sign of the Rose Garland faced on Fleet Street, near Fleet Bridge, in that large extramural parish  (<span class="italic">The Tryumphant Vyctory</span>, 1532, colophon).<br>
<br>For about a decade before he began work as a printer Copland translated French light reading which de Worde published. First, about 1505, he produced a pair of <i>mal-mari&eacute;</i> laments, <span class="italic">A Complaynt of them that be to Soone Maryed</span> and <span class="italic">The Complaynte of them that ben to Late Maryed</span>, the latter certainly, the former possibly, by Pierre Gringore. To each of these he attached an acrostic verse envoi displaying his own name, ROBERTE (-US) COPLAND(E), imitating a French authorial fashion. In 1508 he revised, partly retranslated, and wrote verse for the popular compendium of physical and spiritual advice, <span class="italic">The Kalender of Shepeherdes</span>. Some time before 1510 he produced his translation <span class="italic">Kynge Appolyn of Thyre</span>, and on 6 February 1512 his translation <span class="italic">The Knyght of the Swanne</span>, or <span class="italic">Helyas</span>, appeared; for both of these romances he supplied prose prefaces. After he began work as a printer, in 1514, he continued to produce translations: his version of a French dance manual, <span class="italic">The Maner of Dauncynge of Bace Daunces after the Use of Fraunce</span>, was published on 22 March 1521. Later, in 1524, he brought out <span class="italic">The Begynnynge and Foundacyon of the &hellip; Knyghtes Hospytallers</span>, a translation of the account by Guillaume de Caorsin (<i>c</i>.1430&#150;1501), together with the <span class="italic">Syege of Rodes</span>, from the eyewitness account of 1522 by Jacques de Bourbon, both commissioned by the grand prior of the knights of Malta in England. On 7 August 1528 <span class="italic">The Secrete of Secretes</span> appeared, his translation of the medieval encyclopaedic compilation, and in the same year Copland produced the first English printed navigational route book, <span class="italic">The Rutter of the See</span> (1528). The next year saw the appearance of a short guide to daily living: <span class="italic">The Maner to Lyve Well</span> was printed in thirty-six editions of books of hours between 1529 and 1556, and thus played a considerable part in the emergence of English in this popular devotional manual. His later translations included a 1532 news dispatch on the current fighting in Styria, <span class="italic">The Tryumphant Vyctory of the Imperyall Mageste agaynst the Turkes</span>; a compendium of four surgical tracts (among them the first printing of Galen in English, <span class="italic">The Questyonary of Cyrurgyens</span>, 1542); and, about 1545, a version of the popular memory treatise by Pietro Tommai (Peter of Ravenna), <span class="italic">Fenix</span> (1491). Copland's translation, <span class="italic">The Art of Memory</span> (<i>c</i>.1545), was the first complete text devoted to classical mnemonic theory to appear in English. This list of his translations demonstrates Copland's centrality as a conduit for French popular literature; at the same time it suggests the utility of his translated works of information.<br>
<br>Copland's first printing was also for de Worde, with whom he shared the printing of two previously published and successful texts, one religious (<span class="italic">The Deyenge Creature</span>, 1514), the other legal (<span class="italic">The Justices of Peas</span>, 1515). It may be that the older printer here planned a large edition and commissioned part of it from his employee, as the younger man's introduction to the craft. Copland printed in all thirty-five editions (disregarding ephemera like indulgences and images of pity), and of this number several items which bear his colophon were probably printed for de Worde. After the latter's death in 1534 or 1535, ten books, almost a third of Copland's output, were printed for other men, a record which indicates a continuing lack of capital.<br>
<br>Copland many times showed himself acutely aware of early printing's technical concerns as it attempted to accommodate its inheritance from a manuscript tradition. He served as de Worde's corrector for <span class="italic">Ipomydon</span> in 1518 (&#145;Syth that no wryter / wolde take it to amende&#146;), and, as William Herbert noted, he was the first printer to use the comma in addition to the virgule (early January 1534, in Erasmus's <span class="italic">Funus</span> and John Colet's <span class="italic">A Ryght Fruteful Monycion</span>). He warns printers against overzealous changes:<blockquote>
<div>Correccyon<br>
</div>
<div>I agre<br>
</div>
<div>but there a pause, Folowe your copy<br>
</div>
<div>and lette thamendynge alone.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Guystarde and Sygysmonde</span>, 1532, D2v)</blockquote>The criticisms he put into Quidam's mouth in the preface to <span class="italic">The Seven Sorowes</span> (<i>c</i>.1526) demonstrate his sensitivity to the accurate transmission of text. &#145;By my soule the prynters make such englyshe, so yll spelled, so yll poynted, and so pevyshe, that scantly one cane rede lynes tow, But to fynde sentence, he hath ynough to do&#146;  (A3). Most tellingly, he printed Chaucer's <span class="italic">Parliament of Fowls</span> from manuscript (Bodl. Oxf., MS 638) rather than depending primarily on an earlier edition, claiming that in so doing he had &#145;losed&#146; the text from &#145;ruynous domage&#146;, amended the poetry to &#145;thylke same langage that Chaucer to the gave&#146;, and thus made it possible for lovers of Chaucer to &#145;his mynde avewe&#146;.<br>
<br>In his writing Copland's personal voice registers strongly, even in the ephemeral verses which preface many of his publications and in the &#145;go little book&#146; envois which conclude them. In 1518, for instance, he apologized to <span class="italic">The Castell of Pleasure</span>'s author for adding his own &#145;verses incorrect&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>Without your lycence<br>
</div>
<div>yf I dyde them impresse, Pardon I praye you<br>
</div>
<div>of this my homelynesse.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>In this editorial verse he several times commented on the decay of reading: &#145;Bokes be not set by theyr tymes is past I gesse&#146;  (<span class="italic">Castell</span>, <span class="italic">Assemble of Foules</span>, <span class="italic">Guystarde and Sygysmonde</span>). But it is in his three longer poems that his skill in the creation of dramatic situation and character through dialogue is best displayed. <span class="italic">The Seven Sorowes that Women have when Theyr Husbandes be Deade</span> (written about 1526) provides a parody of religious meditation on the seven sorrows of the Virgin, but the conventionally lascivious widow's emotions and thoughts are presented sympathetically, with an interior focus rare for the period. The tone shifts somewhat uneasily between psychological realism and conventional misogynist fun. The short, amusing <i>jeu d'esprit</i> <span class="italic">Jyl of Braintfords Testament</span> (<i>c</i>.1535) might be labelled a very late English fabliau owing to its scatological jokes and bequest of farts theme. <span class="italic">The Hye Way to the Spyttell Hous</span>, written between 1529 and 1534, is a depiction of the life of the (often criminal) poor who went to London's St Bartholomew's Hospital, and makes a central contribution to the early modern English discussion of poverty as a social problem. It contains the first printed version of thieves' cant in England and thus anticipates the later sixteenth-century work of Thomas Harman, John Awdely, and Thomas Dekker. The poem is indebted in its second section to Robert de Balsac's <span class="italic">Le chemin de l'ospital</span> (1502), a catalogue of fools.<br>
<br>Copland worked in a period for which almost no Stationers' Company records survive, but he is glimpsed as one of a group of colleagues when, on 25 October 1526, the bishop of London, Cuthbert Tunstall, warned thirty-one members of the book trade against printing Lutheran books. Copland's lifelong connection with de Worde is further shown by his appointment as one of two overseers for the latter's will and by a bequest of 10 marks in books, perhaps equivalent to a year's income. The lay subsidy assessment taken in the printer's ward of Farringdon Without on 4 April 1544 records his worth as 20<i>s</i>., a low figure, though these assessments were sometimes suspect. Near the end of his life Andrew Boorde's <span class="italic">Breviary of Helthe</span>, dated 15 July 1547, refers to another book of Boorde's, his <span class="italic">Introduction of Knowledge</span>, &#145;whiche hath been longe a pryntynge for lacke of money and paper and it is in pryntynge with pyctures at Roberte Coplande prynter&#146;  (Duff, 30). In his <span class="italic">Pryncyples of Astronamye</span>, which Copland printed (1547?), Boorde refers again to this work: &#145;Introduction of knowledg a boke of my makyng the whiche ys aprintyng at old Robert Coplands the eldist printer of Ingland the which doeth print thes yere mi pronosticacions&#146;. This evidence, combined with the <span class="italic">Short-Title Catalogue</span>'s assignment of a Copland-printed herbal to the same probable date, suggests that Copland was still active in this year. He perhaps died before its end, however, since in 1547 his successor, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6266/', "William Copland (d. 1569)")</script>, printed <span class="italic">A Fruteful &hellip; Instruction</span> for Richard Kele (the <span class="italic">STC</span> lists an additional group of four books which may be assigned to 1548 and to either Robert or William Copland).<br>
