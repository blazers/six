<span class="headword">Keane <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Skrine]</span>,  Mary Nesta <span class="st"> [Molly; </span></span> <span class="st"> <em>pseud. </em>M. J. Farrell]</span>  (1904&#150;1996), <span class="occ">novelist and playwright</span>, was born on 20 July 1904 at Kilnamora, co. Kildare, Ireland, into an Anglo-Irish family, the third of the five children of Walter Clarmont Skrine, governor of Mauritius, originally from a Somerset family, and his wife, the <span class="occ">poet</span> <a name="cosubject_59206"></a><span class="headword">(Agnes) Nesta Shakespear Skrine <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Higginson; </span></span> <span class="st"> <em>pseud. </em>Moira O'Neill]</span>  (1865&#150;1955). Nesta was born in Cushendun, co. Antrim, the daughter of Charles Henry Higginson and his wife, Mary. Her first published work was <span class="italic">An Easter Vacation</span> (1893), a seaside romance ponderously jocular in tone, which was followed by a fairy story for children, <span class="italic">The Elf-Errant</span> (1893). In 1895 she married Walter Skrine. The work with which her name is principally associated, <span class="italic">Songs of the Glens of Antrim</span>, appeared in 1901 and became one of the most popular books of Irish regional verse. She was technically very skilled in the use of varied and complicated rhyming patterns. The poems, attempting the use of the Hiberno-English of the Glens of Antrim, run the gamut from sadness at lost love to mild comedy, and are all pervaded by love for the Irish homeland. Some were frequently anthologized (such as &#145;Corrymeela&#146;). O'Neill lived for a time in Alberta, Canada, where her husband farmed extensively, and she included a section entitled &#145;Songs from North-West Canada&#146; in <span class="italic">More Songs of the Glens of Antrim</span> (1921). Canada figures also as a location in her novel <span class="italic">From Two Points of View</span> (1924), an ambitious but rather contrived love story. The <span class="italic">Collected Poems of Moira O'Neill</span> appeared in 1933. She died in co. Wexford on 22 January 1955. <br>
<br>Mary Nesta Skrine, always known as Molly, spent her first five years in co. Kildare. The family then moved to Ballyrankin, co. Wexford, where she had a lonely and unhappy childhood. She was educated privately and patchily, briefly attending the French School in Bray, co. Wicklow. While she was at school, members of the IRA set fire to the family home. In the main she was left to the dubious care of a string of somewhat eccentric governesses, but she made splendid use of some of the more memorable oddities of these ladies in her later fiction. Her first fictional work, a light-hearted novel amusingly entitled <span class="italic">The Knight of the Cheerful Countenance</span>, was started when she was seventeen &#145;for pin money&#146; to increase her meagre dress allowance, and she was surprised and gratified when it was published by Mills and Boon in 1926. She wrote it under the pseudonym M. J. Farrell, a name she selected from above a country public house as she was riding home from hunting. She used a pseudonym to avoid the scorn of her Anglo-Irish gentry friends, who, she believed, would have despised such arty pretensions in one of their own class. She retained the name for all her novels and plays until the surprise appearance of her most celebrated novel, <span class="italic">Good Behaviour</span>, in 1981. <br>
<br>In the 1920s and 1930s M. J. Farrell published a succession of novels, including <span class="italic">Young Entry</span> (1928), <span class="italic">Taking Chances</span> (1929), <span class="italic">Mad Puppetstown</span> (1931), <span class="italic">Conversation Piece</span> (1932), and <span class="italic">Full House</span> (1935). They were warmly received, and Hugh Walpole called her &#145;one of the best half-dozen younger women writers now writing in England&#146;  (Devlin, <span class="italic">The Rising Tide</span>, vi), not realizing that her literary labours were being conducted on John Bull's other island. <span class="italic">Devoted Ladies</span> (1934), about a lesbian relationship, and one of the most powerful and sexually potent of the M. J. Farrell works, moved Compton Mackenzie to dub it &#145;infernally good &hellip; a worldly wise, witty and remorselessly cruel book &hellip; certainly one of the most brilliant novels I have read in the last two years&#146;  (Devlin, <span class="italic">Devoted Ladies</span>, viii). <br>
<br>As a novelist Farrell belongs in the long and distinguished line of &#145;big house&#146; Anglo-Irish ascendancy writers, which dates from Maria Edgeworth and Lady Morgan, and includes among its modern exponents George Moore and Elizabeth Bowen (her contemporary and close friend) and, latterly, Caroline Blackwood, John Banville, and William Trevor. Like these writers, she sets her fiction in the large gentry houses which are just beginning to crumble, as their owners' prestige and finances dwindle in an emerging, bourgeois, Catholic Ireland. An important respect in which she differs from most of these other writers is her avoidance of political themes, as in <span class="italic">The Rising Tide</span> (1937), which was set in 1900 during a period of home rule agitation. <br>
<br>Farrell concentrates instead on the claustrophobia of personal relationships within closely knit family groups. She meticulously observes the well-furnished interiors of her chosen mansions, delighting in details of carpets, curtains, bedrooms, fireplaces, chandeliers, and also the ruinously dangerous intimacies of family life. Occasionally, as in early chapters of <span class="italic">Devoted Ladies</span>, she moved her scene to London's gossipy literary milieu, but the fiction comes into its own once she has transferred her characters, both the lusty and the effete, to an Irish gentry dwelling, and the windswept acres over which their horses and hounds pursue the fox with a vigour unparalleled outside the works of Somerville and Ross. Riding and hunting were Farrell's favourite pastimes, and her prose comes vividly to life when she describes a day's gallop. She is equally good, however, at describing the terror felt by small ascendancy children when they are first forced to mount their troublesome ponies. (Her brother, Walter Skrine, despite having been seriously injured in the First World War, rode in the Grand National.) <br>
<br>On 20 October 1938 Molly Skrine married Robert Lumley (Bobby) Keane (1909/10&#150;1946), a gentleman farmer, with whom she lived for five years before their marriage&#151;unconventional in this as in much else. They had two daughters, Sally and Virginia. In the same year as her marriage she had a great success with her first play, <span class="italic">Spring Meeting</span> (1938); she was assisted by her close friend John Perry, whom she had met while staying at Woodrooff, his parents' house. The play was staged at the Ambassadors Theatre, and was directed, as were her other stage works, by John Gielgud. It gave the actress Margaret Rutherford her first starring role, as Bijou Furze, a formidable and eccentric elderly spinster who has a secret gambling habit. Sybil Thorndike and Lewis Casson had leading roles in another successful comedy, <span class="italic">Treasure Hunt</span>, at the Apollo in 1949. Molly's light-hearted plays won popular and critical approval, and James Agate said he &#145;would back this impish writer to hold her own against Noel Coward himself&#146;  (Devlin, <span class="italic">The Rising Tide</span>, i). <br>
<br>Bobby Keane's early death in 1946 meant that the family had to abandon their beautiful home, Belleville, in the Blackwater valley. The failure of her play <span class="italic">Dazzling Prospects</span> (1961) was another blow. It was put on at the Globe Theatre with Margaret Rutherford in the lead, and under the aegis of Molly's great friend the impresario Binkie Beaumont. But the play was wrong for the time, with very different, realistic works such as John Osborne's <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span> taking over from frivolous comedy. M. J. Farrell fell silent for the subsequent two decades. <br>
<br>Molly Keane set about the difficult business of bringing up her two daughters in reduced circumstances, but never lost touch with either her Anglo-Irish friends or her large circle of literary acquaintances in London. She moved to England for five years but returned to Ireland when she bought a house at Ardmore, co. Waterford. Here she entertained the actress Peggy Ashcroft who, bedridden with influenza and needing something to read, asked her hostess whether she had written anything interesting lately. Keane had in fact submitted <span class="italic">Good Behaviour</span> to her old friend William Collins, who had published many of her M. J. Farrell novels, but Collins thought it far too dark and rejected it. Ashcroft thought the book a triumph, however, and sent it to her friend Ian Parsons of Chatto and Windus, who liked it but could not persuade Chatto to take it. <span class="italic">Good Behaviour</span> was eventually published by Andr&eacute; Deutsch in 1981. It was a wickedly funny book in which Keane came into her own as a brilliant observer of family relationships and sexual conduct. Its finest achievement is its gawky and overgrown heroine, Aroon St Charles, who is far too dim to understand her cruel mother, homosexual brother, or lecherous father, but nevertheless triumphs over them all in the end, becoming in Keane's skilful depiction a terrifying epitome of menacing, unloved ugliness. It was shortlisted for the Booker prize and televised by the BBC in 1982, and a new readership acclaimed this &#145;unknown&#146; Irish writer. All of the M. J. Farrell novels were reissued by Virago. Inspired by the novel's great success, Keane went on to publish two more lively novels, <span class="italic">Time after Time</span> (1983) and <span class="italic">Loving and Giving</span> (1988). Her cookery book, <span class="italic">Nursery Cooking</span>, was published in 1985. With an attractive pointed face and clear blue eyes, she had a sharp sense of humour. In her final years she was incapacitated by heart trouble, and she died on 22 April 1996 after a fall in her home at Ardmore.<br>
