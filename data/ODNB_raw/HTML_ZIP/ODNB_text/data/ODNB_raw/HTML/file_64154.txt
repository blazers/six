<span class="headword">Liesching, Sir  Percivale</span>  (1895&#150;1973), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born on 1 April 1895 at 1 Thurlestone Road, West Norwood, London, the son of Henry Selby Liesching, a Trinity House civil servant, and his wife, Elaine Frances Flint. A pupil at Bedford School, in 1913 Liesching was awarded a junior Hulme scholarship to read Greats at Brasenose College, Oxford. But before doing so he volunteered for war service, serving in Europe and east Africa. He was mentioned in dispatches and ended the war as a captain in the tank corps. In 1919 he proceeded to Brasenose, obtaining a distinction in the one-year Greats course for returning soldiers and playing rugby for his college and the university. He formally received his degree in 1921 (and took an MA in 1939).<br>
<br>In 1920 Liesching entered the Colonial Office but transferred to the newly created Dominions Office in 1925. In 1928 he joined the staff of Britain's first high commissioner in Canada where he made a good impression. &#145;Reserved, intelligent, efficient&#146;, he was sensitive to Canadian susceptibilities and &#145;as congenial in the drawing room as he was accomplished in the office&#146;  (Keenleyside, 1.251). He left Ottawa in 1932 to become political secretary (1933&#150;5) and official secretary (1936&#150;8) to the UK high commissioner in Australia. In 1939 he returned to London as an assistant under-secretary. However, he chafed at the confines of the rigidly run department and in 1942 transferred, as second secretary, to the Board of Trade. There he not only withstood the bullying of the board's president, Hugh Dalton, but won Dalton's grudging respect. Among other things, he skilfully negotiated the commercial side of the 1945 American loan. As permanent under-secretary at the Ministry of Food from 1946 to 1948, he again demonstrated considerable diplomatic prowess when, in 1947, he led a mission to tell Ottawa of drastic cuts in British food purchases.<br>
<br>Liesching became permanent under-secretary of the Commonwealth Relations Office in 1949. Being utterly different from Sir Eric Machtig, the previous permanent under-secretary whom the Commonwealth secretary, Noel-Baker, had determined to remove, Liesching seemed an admirable choice. He enjoyed exercising power and was decisive, shrewd, diplomatic, and clear-sighted. But to Noel-Baker's consternation, he could not work with Liesching. They disagreed on fundamentals. Liesching was a tough realist who had no time for his minister's idealism. Within less than a year Noel-Baker departed, suspecting Liesching had influenced his removal.<br>
<br>Liesching was a highly effective permanent under-secretary, not least in the way he reorganized the department. From 1955 until his retirement in 1958, he was high commissioner in South Africa and for Basutoland, the Bechuanaland protectorate, and Swaziland. He was appointed CMG in 1932, KCMG in 1944, KCB in 1947, GCMG in 1951, and KCVO in 1953. In retirement he was a director of the Rio Tinto Company, the Automatic Telephone and Electric Company, and W. J. Fraser &amp; Co. As a member of the Plowden committee (1963), which led to the amalgamation of the Commonwealth Relations Office staff with those of the Foreign Office, Liesching safeguarded the interests of his former department.<br>
<br>On 26 March 1924 Liesching married a gentle and reserved woman, Ethel Georgina Nicol Williamson (<i>b</i>. 1900/01), the daughter of James Williamson, a gentleman of Bishops Down Grange, Tunbridge Wells, Kent. They had three daughters. Liesching was a lean man of average height, with dark hair, an upright bearing, and a very strong, sharp-featured, aquiline face. He had a military mien and was said to have applied a military ethos to his civilian work. Despite his charm, affability, conversational prowess, and skill in personal relations at all levels, he was respected rather than popular. He had practical rather than intellectual wisdom. In retrospect, he lacked vision on some issues (such as the Central African Federation and the exile of Seretse Khama) and, as was then common, had a touch of what would now be seen as racism. None the less, he was described as &#145;one of the outstanding public servants of his generation&#146;  (Garner, <span class="italic">The Times</span>). Liesching died of cancer at Holy Trinity vicarage, Hurst Road, Sidcup, Kent, on 4 November 1973.<br>
