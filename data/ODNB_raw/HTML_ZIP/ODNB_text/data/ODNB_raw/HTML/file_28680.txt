</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Warburton,  William</span>  (1698&#150;1779), <span class="occ">bishop of Gloucester and religious controversialist</span>, was born in Newark, Nottinghamshire, on 24 December 1698, the second and only surviving son of George Warburton (<i>d</i>. 1706), attorney and town clerk of Newark, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1749), daughter of William Holman, an alderman of the town. The Warburton family originated in Cheshire, and Warburton's grandfather had been involved in Booth's attempted royalist rising at Chester in 1659. He himself wrote out some biographical and genealogical memoranda, which can be found in the British Library (Add. MS 4320, fols. 206&#150;9). He attended school at Newark; one of his masters there was later rather surprised by the appearance of Warburton's major work, <span class="italic">The Divine Legation of Moses</span>, because &#145;when at school, he had always considered young Warburton to be the dullest of all dull scholars&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 50, 1780, 474). He briefly moved to Oakham School before returning to Newark, where he was taught by a cousin, also named William Warburton. His father died in 1706, so it was important that the young Warburton, who was responsible for his sisters and his mother (to whom he was devoted), should secure a career relatively early in life, and he was therefore articled for five years to an attorney, John Kirke, at East Markham, Nottinghamshire, on 23 April 1714. On completion of his articles he practised law in Newark from 1719 to 1723.<h2>
<a name="Literarycumecclesiasticvocation"></a>Literary-cum-ecclesiastic vocation</h2>Warburton had a pronounced appetite for reading, in which he was encouraged by his schoolmaster cousin, and it was this literary bent that led him to consider a change in vocation: he decided to take orders in the church. He was ordained deacon on 23 December 1723 by Archbishop William Dawes, of York. In that year his first publication appeared: <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Translations in Prose and Verse</span>, a small volume which he addressed to his patron, Sir Robert Sutton, MP for Nottinghamshire, who in 1727 presented him to his first small living, Greaseley, in Nottinghamshire. He was ordained priest by Edmund Gibson, bishop of London, at St Paul's on 1 March 1727, and in June 1728 Sutton presented him to the rich living of Brant Broughton, in Lincolnshire, which he continued to hold until 1746. In taking the living of Brant Broughton he resigned Greaseley, but in 1730 he was given the additional living of Firsby, in Leicestershire, by the duke of Newcastle (with whom he corresponded), which he held as a non-resident, with Steeping Magna, until 1756.<br>
<br>Warburton became close to William Stukeley, the antiquary, who lived nearby at Stamford, and from 1722 until the eve of Stukeley's death in 1765 they exchanged letters, many of which were published in the second volume of J. Nichols's <span class="italic">Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth Century</span>. Francis Peck and John Towne, both antiquaries, were also close to Warburton at this time, as was the philosopher David Hartley, then practising as a physician at Newark. Warburton was granted an MA at Cambridge, at the recommendation of Sutton, on the occasion of the king's visit in 1728. His literary ambitions had been further encouraged by a meeting in London at Christmas 1726 with Lewis Theobald, which had been organized by Matthew Concanen. Theobald used some of his new acquaintance's notes in his edition of Shakespeare; he corresponded with Warburton, chiefly about variant readings, for seven years. Warburton concurred with Concanen and Theobald in their severe criticisms of Pope, remarking in a letter to Concanen of 2 January 1727 that &#145;Dryden borrowed for want of leisure, and Pope for want of genius&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Illustrations</span>, 2.195). It was fortunate for Warburton that Pope remained unaware of this letter, which was first published by Mark Akenside in a note to his &#145;Ode to Thomas Edwards&#146; in 1751.<br>
<br>Concanen also arranged the publication of Warburton's first substantial work, <span class="italic">A critical and philosophical enquiry into the causes of prodigies and miracles, as related by historians</span> (1727), in which the fledgeling author attacked, <i>inter alia</i>, Hobbes, Shaftesbury, and Mandeville (for their antipathy to religion), as well as a whole mass of ancient and medieval historians and chroniclers (for their credulousness). Aside from Ralegh and Clarendon, Warburton was equally critical of modern historians as supposedly lacking any real knowledge of human nature, and he was especially censorious when condemning the antiquarian tastes promoted by the followers of Stow and Holinshed, which he denounced as &#145;a deprav'd Appetite for <i>Trash</i> and <i>Cinders</i>&#146;  (W. Warburton, <span class="italic">A Critical and Philosophical Enquiry</span>, 65). He was concerned to demonstrate the role of providence in human affairs, particularly as evinced through the miracles of the <span class="roman">Old and New testaments</span>, in contradistinction to a superstitious reverence for portents and signs, which he associated with heathenism. The assured tone of this work would prove typical of his later writings, although this was a text that he quickly decided to suppress. When his disciple Richard Hurd came to edit Warburton's works he too chose not to republish it. Though the work appeared anonymously Warburton sent out presentation copies. He also published a less contentious work in 1727, <span class="italic">The Legal Judicature in Chancery Stated</span>, which drew on his legal training in stating the relationship between the chancery and the rolls court. This was an early instance of his marked interest in the law and the English constitution, subjects which retained his attention for the rest of his career. He would also long prove all too happy either to praise or defame prominent characters in print, and an early instance of this occurred just before he himself acquired a public reputation in the 1730s. Sir Robert Sutton was expelled from the House of Commons in 1732 as a result of corruption relating to the Charitable Corporation for the Relief of the Industrious Poor, of which he was a director; the following year Warburton provided <span class="italic">An Apology for Sir Robert Sutton</span>, in which he absolved him of the charges laid against him, concluding that his patron was a victim of malice, cavil, and hearsay. He later requested that Pope remove slighting references to Sutton in this connection from both <span class="italic">Of the Use of Riches</span> and his <span class="italic">Epilogue to the Satires</span>.<br>
<br>Warburton's years at Brant Broughton were productive ones, and he spent a great deal of his time there in retired study. As Hurd wrote in his introduction to his edition of Warburton's works:<blockquote>living by himself, and not having the fashionable opinions of a great society to bias his own, he might acquire an enlarged turn of mind, and strike out for himself, as he clearly did, an original cast both of thought and composition. (Hurd, <span class="italic">Discourse</span>, 6)</blockquote>The first major result of this independence of mind was his controversial defence of the established church and the <span class="roman">Test Acts</span>, <span class="italic">The Alliance between Church and State</span> (1736). Warburton argued that religion alone can supply the rewards necessary to ensure that individual virtue continues to underpin the proper function of civil government. The magistrate was to oversee the government of the body, the church that of the soul. Fundamental to the alliance so formed was the influence that the church could give to the service of the state, and the support and protection that the state could in turn give to the church. Above all the church was to oversee that popular measure of the early and mid-eighteenth-century Church of England, the &#145;reformation of manners&#146;. Warburton argued that an established denomination provided moral security for the state, and that it should therefore be composed by the majority confession of the nation, thereby standing clear of any multiplication and fragmentation into sectarianism. Sectarianism he identified as the source of contention and internal wars. Reflection on the legacy of the civil war, a subject on which he had planned to write a history, comprised a major part of his thinking on such matters. He read most of the political pamphlets produced between 1640 and 1660, and his very full annotations to Clarendon's <span class="italic">History</span> were finally published by the Clarendon Press in 1826. While he argued that the civil magistrate could not coerce opinions he also declared that such opinions should always give way to civil peace. Utility was absolutely central to his argument, but it was a utility that led to knowledge of divine truth through the proper, tolerant practice of Christianity as a revealed religion. Hobbes and Roman Catholicism represented the two extremes to be avoided; Hooker and Locke were lauded as the defenders of a tolerant church. Neither high- nor low-church apologists were ready to accept what seemed to many to be an overly legalistic and compromisingly Erastian understanding of the church. Warburton's Erastianism was decidedly atypical of established apologetic in the eighteenth century, as was his explicit appeal to Lockean contract theory. None the less the work won him the admiration of Bishop Francis Hare of Chichester, who had been more critical of an edition of Velleius Paterculus that Warburton had addressed to him and which he published in the <span class="italic">Biblioth&egrave;que Britannique</span> in 1736. Hare recommended Warburton, on the altogether securer strength of the <span class="italic">Alliance</span>, to the theologically sophisticated Queen Caroline, long noted for taking a close personal interest in church affairs. Unfortunately for Warburton the queen died in November 1737, and the preferment that he might otherwise have expected did not come his way.<h2>
<a name="FriendshipwithPope"></a>Friendship with Pope</h2>Bishop Hare died in 1740, leaving Warburton without an important supporter, but a friendship which was to prove extremely beneficial to him began in the same year. Although he had attacked Pope when a member of the Theobald circle, even contributing anonymous articles against him in the <span class="italic">Daily Journal</span> in March and April 1728, he defended the theology of Pope's <span class="italic">Essay on Man</span> in a series of letters in <span class="italic">The History of the Works of the Learned</span> in December 1738. These letters were a reply to a work by a Swiss divine, Jean Pierre de Crousaz, who, in his <span class="italic">Examen de l'essai de Monsieur Pope sur l'homme</span> (1737), had identified the argument of the poem with Leibnizianism; Warburton's able, if suitably combative, defence appeared as <span class="italic">Vindication</span>, in 1740. As a result of this unexpected defence, in which Pope's essay was read as an exercise in Newtonian natural theology, Warburton spent a week with him at Twickenham in 1740, having been introduced to him through the good offices of William Murray, later Lord Mansfield. Pope thus gained an increasingly influential theologian as his philosophical apologist, and Warburton gained the friendship of an extremely well-connected writer. Warburton seems to have brought Pope back to Christian orthodoxy, gradually supplanting the religiously suspect Bolingbroke in his affections. Pope attributed to Warburton the creation of the fourth book of the <span class="italic">Dunciad</span>, in its 1743 version; Warburton's notes to the poem are as concerned with theology as they are with literary questions, as are his detailed and expansive annotations to the <span class="italic">Essay on Criticism</span> and the <span class="italic">Essay on Man</span>. Such was the close nature of the friendship that when in 1741 an offer of an Oxford DD was made to Warburton, only to be rapidly withdrawn, Pope declined the simultaneous offer of an LLD that the university had made to him. At the poet's death Warburton became his executor, from which position he made rather a lot of money, and an interesting exchange of letters between him and his publisher Knapton on this and allied matters has been published as <span class="italic">Pope's Literary Legacy</span>.<br>
<br>It was through Pope that Warburton met Ralph Allen, the postal entrepreneur and Bath philanthropist, who had invited both men to his home, Prior Park, in November 1741. This was to prove Warburton's fortune, since he married Allen's favourite niece, Gertrude Tucker (<i>d</i>. 1796), on 5 September 1745. When Allen died in 1764 Warburton was the beneficiary of a generous bequest, and it had also been arranged that Mrs Warburton was to be left Prior Park at the death of her uncle's widow. Warburton spent the greater part of the year at Prior Park from the date of his marriage, and it was largely for this reason that he resigned the living of Brant Broughton in 1746, the year in which Murray, as solicitor-general, secured him the lucrative and influential preachership at Lincoln's Inn. His lectures on religion at Lincoln's Inn were published in two volumes in 1753 as <span class="italic">The Principles of Natural and Revealed Religion Occasionally Opened and Explained</span>. His links with Lincoln's Inn were affirmed in 1769, when he founded the Warburtonian lectures on the proof of Christianity through prophecies (a favoured proof in eighteenth-century Christian apologetics).<br>
<br>Warburton had long been deeply interested in literature, and his friendship with Pope consolidated this interest. He was also close to Samuel Richardson, for whom he wrote a preface to <span class="italic">Clarissa</span>, and he likewise provided a dissertation on chivalry for Thomas Jarvis's translation of <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> (1742). Henry Fielding knew him through a mutual friendship with Allen, and a mock encomium to his learning is to be found in <span class="italic">Tom Jones</span> (bk 3, chap. 1). Laurence Sterne, whom he met through a friendship with David Garrick, had offered to make him Tristram's tutor in <span class="italic">The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman</span> but Warburton allegedly prevented this by presenting Sterne with a small present of a bag of gold. Warburton had long been fascinated by Shakespeare, contributing much to Sir Thomas Hanmer's edition of the works. The question of how much he actually contributed to this edition later provoked a furious quarrel, as can be seen in Philip Nichols's pamphlet <span class="italic">The Castrated Letter of Sir T. Hanmer</span> (1763). Warburton had produced his own edition of Shakespeare in 1747. This quickly proved controversial, not least as many of his emendations are nothing if not absurd, and he was attacked by Thomas Edwards of Lincoln's Inn (where Warburton was the recently installed preacher) in his <span class="italic">Canons of Criticism</span> (1748). Edwards's criticisms were reaffirmed by John Upton in <span class="italic">Critical Observations on Shakespeare</span> (1748) and by Benjamin Heath in <span class="italic">Revisal of Shakespeare's Text</span> (1766). Warburton's contributions to the developing art of the editor were, however, considerable, if markedly uneven in quality. Much attention to these matters is apparent in Warburton's lengthy correspondence with Thomas Birch, to whom he had declared on 24 November 1737 that &#145;the most agreeable subject in the world &hellip; is literary history&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 4320, fol. 119<i>r</i>). In a much later letter to Birch, of 25 October 1763, Warburton characteristically emphasized an allied commitment in a manner otherwise surprising in a bishop: &#145;You must know I am a great Antiquarian, tho' I make no word of it; as half-ashamed of my taste; like a man who has taken an odd fancy to an ugly mistress&#146;  (ibid., fol. 199<i>r</i>). It was this union of assumed piety and frank worldliness that gave Warburton so ambiguous a contemporary reputation. This applied to all his public dealings, and especially in regard to his literary labours, where he acquired a reputation for graceless irascibility. Edwards's well-received, deeply humorous critique of Warburton's Shakespeare edition had delighted Akenside, a declared enemy of Warburton, who similarly lampooned Warburton's work on editions of Milton and of Pope's poetry in his &#145;Ode to Thomas Edwards&#146; (1751), declaring that no poet required the assistance of &#145;such a militant divine&#146;:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">[a] sophist vain,<br>
</div>
<div>Who durst approach his hallow'd strain<br>
</div>
<div>With unwash'd hands and lips profane.<br>
</div> (ll. 40&#150;42)</blockquote>Nevertheless whatever their actual opinions of Warburton all writers owed him a debt for his work on literary property. His <span class="italic">Letter from an Author to a Member of Parliament Concerning Literary Property</span> (1747) was the first theoretical examination of the subject, a treatment not unrelated to his own interest in his role as Pope's literary executor. His edition of Pope's works appeared in 1751; he wrote a large part of the life of Pope&#151;attributed to Owen Ruffhead&#151;that appeared in the 1769 edition of the works.<br>
<br>Pope had been concerned to introduce his new friend to his old confidant Bolingbroke. He wrote to Allen on 6 March 1744 how he wished to introduce Warburton to &#145;the One Great Man in Europe, who knows as much as He&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Alexander Pope</span>, 4.504&#150;5). The introduction heralded a poisonous rivalry, and Warburton responded testily, in <span class="italic">A Letter to the Lord Viscount B&#151;</span> (1749), to Bolingbroke's equivocal remarks concerning Pope in his <span class="italic">Idea of a Patriot King</span>, which led to a war of words in which Bolingbroke made some telling points in his <span class="italic">Familiar Letter to the most Impudent Man Living</span> (1749). This was an encounter which led to the most tedious and unnecessary of Warburton's writings, <span class="italic">A View of Lord Bolingbroke's Philosophy</span> (1754&#150;5), a work which Montesquieu admired. Pope himself had seen a dark side of Warburton's character, which he noted in a letter of August 1743 to Martha Blount, who had felt slighted by Warburton and the Allens: &#145;W. is a sneaking Parson, &amp; I told him he flattered&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Alexander Pope</span>, 4.463&#150;4).<h2>
<a name="TheologicalandliterarycontroversiesTheDivineLegationofMosesDemonstrated"></a>Theological and literary controversies: The Divine Legation of Moses Demonstrated</h2>Warburton's friendship with Pope had begun in the short interval between the appearance of the first and second volumes of his major work, <span class="italic">The Divine Legation of Moses Demonstrated</span> (1738&#150;41), an audacious demonstration of sometimes prodigious and always combative learning that guaranteed him his reputation as the would-be literary dictator of mid-eighteenth-century England, a role which his work as Pope's executor only served to emphasize. Pope's reading of the first volume left him rhapsodic, as he wrote to Warburton on 24 June 1740:<blockquote>I am not really Learned enough to be a judge in Works of the nature &amp; Depth of yours, but I travel thro your book, as thro an Amazing Scene of ancient Egypt or Greece, struck with Veneration &amp; Wonder, but at every step wanting an Instructor to tell me all I wish to know. Such you prove to me in the Walks of Antiquity &amp; such you will prove to all Mankind. (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Alexander Pope</span>, 4.251)</blockquote>Hurd's comparable praise for the work is not without foundation, especially his claim that &#145;in the whole compass of modern or antient theology, there is nothing equal or similar to this extraordinary performance&#146;  (Hurd, <span class="italic">Discourse</span>, 36). The central argument of this work is built on a daring paradox, the pivotal need for which is apparent in the subtitle to the <span class="italic">Divine Legation</span>, in which the truth of Christianity is to be shown on the principles of a &#145;religious deist&#146;. Deists had dismissed all priestly religions as providing false comfort to humanity through the fallacious doctrines of a future life, which were merely an &#145;engine&#146; of &#145;priestcraft&#146; by which the clergy gained false authority and illegitimate status in society. According to Warburton, however, Moses did not even mention such a doctrine, thereby proving that his was the true revealed faith, since God chose not to reveal such a doctrine immediately but hid it until the time was right for its proper promulgation. In defence of this paradox Warburton argued that God had intervened directly in the ancient world of the Hebrews through extraordinary providences, and there was thus no need for comforting doctrines of futurity; not one of the characters in the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> acted according to the doctrine of a future state, living only with respect to the present life. This proved a contentious proposition, and it was one which Warburton had quickly to defend from a host of critics, both freethinkers and Christians. Replies to the central paradox of the work appeared in rapid succession throughout the 1740s and 1750s; enmity to Warburton's ideas frequently united otherwise disparate groups of clergy. His arguments were challenged by Cambridge Newtonians such as Arthur Ashley Sykes and John Jackson, in 1744 and 1745 respectively; by Hutchinsonians such as Julius Bate, in a tract of 1741; by William Law, the nonjuror and mystical Behmenist, as late as 1756; and, very effectively, by the ultra-latitudinarian Francis Blackburne, in 1757. It is a tribute to the polemical ire of Warburton's writings that opposition to them could encompass such an unprecedentedly wide arc of clerical opinion. Benjamin Newton, writing in 1758, suggested that the work actually provided ammunition for the very freethinkers that it was designed to refute, while John Tillard, in a tract published in 1742, defended the ancient religions against Warburton's criticisms. Bishop Potter of London, who distrusted Warburton, encouraged the clergy of his diocese to publish critiques of <span class="italic">The Divine Legation</span>. Most controversially Warburton subsequently became embroiled in a very public dispute in 1756 over the nature of the book of <span class="roman">Job</span> with Robert Lowth, professor of Hebrew at Oxford, an encounter in which he came out much worse than the learned Lowth, who had originally been offended by a slighting remark that Warburton had made regarding his father (Warburton was both envious and suspicious of clerical dynasties). As a result of this encounter Warburton once more argued, in a 1765 addition to the work, that Job had had no knowledge of futurity and that the work was a political allegory; Lowth again contested this, in <span class="italic">Letter to the Author of &#145;The Divine Legation&#146;</span>, and he was not above pointing to Warburton's poor command of Hebrew in making his case.<br>
<br>Quite aside from its paradoxical kernel <span class="italic">The Divine Legation</span> proved controversial because, in Hurd's words, it &#145;took in all that was most curious in Gentile, Jewish, and Christian antiquity&#146;  (Hurd, <span class="italic">Discourse</span>, 20). His theories regarding the origins of writing were to prove particularly influential: Condillac translated sections of the work on the nature of hieroglyphs, guaranteeing Warburton a high status in linguistic speculation throughout late eighteenth-century Europe. This standing was questioned by others in France: Voltaire wrote a short refutation of the bishop's work, <span class="italic">A Warburton</span>, and Rousseau criticized his notions of church and state relations in his <span class="italic">Contrat Social</span>. A German translation of <span class="italic">The Divine Legation</span> was produced at Leipzig and Frankfurt between 1751 and 1753; it was to influence a number of German theologians and classical scholars. Praise for the work was also received from Virginia, where the book was much discussed. Warburton's readings of classical sources were, however, often as unhappily received as were his readings of sacred literature. A long-standing friendship with Conyers Middleton, with whom he shared marked hatreds of more consciously orthodox divines, was brought to an abrupt end when Middleton, the biographer of Cicero, questioned Warburton's interpretation of Cicero's religion in the fifth edition of his <span class="italic">Letter from Rome</span> (1742). Warburton distanced himself from Middleton when writing against other critics of his work; his notes to later editions of <span class="italic">The Divine Legation</span> further allowed him to finish off his critics in a brutal manner, a characteristic that his contemporaries found increasingly distasteful. Nevertheless this public distancing from an erstwhile friend also served to reinforce Warburton's otherwise contentious reputation for orthodoxy, as Middleton's reputation for heterodoxy had grown markedly over the preceding decade and a half. Similarly Warburton's friendship with John Jortin, who, like Middleton, was a Cambridge divine of advanced theological opinions, ended when Jortin mildly censured his reading of the sixth book of the <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> in <span class="italic">Six Dissertations</span> (1755). Jortin was savagely attacked by Richard Hurd, Warburton's young acolyte, who was to prove a long-standing epistolary confidant, in a vituperative pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Delicacy of Friendship</span>. Edward Gibbon's first venture into print in English, <span class="italic">Critical Observations on the Sixth Book of the Aeneid</span> (1770), was also largely concerned with Warburton's alleged misreading of the text, and his engagements with Warburton were of great significance for him at the outset of his intellectual life, as is clear in his account in the <span class="italic">Autobiographies</span>.<br>
<br>Middleton had produced a critique of the miracles of the early church which appeared in 1749; it initiated a major debate among churchmen and other interested parties. Warburton seized the opportunity to affirm his orthodoxy by arguing for the truth of what was one of the latest possible miracles, according to the standards of protestantism: that which faced the emperor Julian at the rebuilding of the temple at Jerusalem. His <span class="italic">Julian</span> (1751) proved a controversial work; Montesquieu greatly admired it, while Voltaire loathed it. The nonconformist divine Philip Doddridge, a friend and frequent correspondent of Warburton, was also impressed by the work. The Doddridge&#150;Warburton correspondence&#151;eighteen letters from Warburton are reproduced in G. F. Nuttall's <span class="italic">Calendar</span> of Doddridge's correspondence (1979)&#151;reveals Warburton's more professedly pious commitments; he was also a great admirer of Doddridge's expositions of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and a manifest follower of his recommendations for family prayer and devotions. Doddridge was interested too in Warburton's feelings on being attacked by John Byrom in <span class="italic">Enthusiasm: a Poetical Essay</span>. Warburton's relations with &#145;enthusiasm&#146; were not happy. His dislike of Methodism was deep, and he condemned both the soteriology and the practical enthusiasm of John Wesley and George Whitefield in <span class="italic">The Doctrine of Grace</span> (1763), a work which drew hurt replies from both men. Both Wesley and Whitefield believed that his notion of grace revealed Warburton to be less than orthodox, leading Whitefield to expostulate, &#145;Alas! What could a Middleton say more?&#146;  (G. Whitefield, <span class="italic">Observations on some Fatal Mistakes, in a Book Lately Published, and Intitled, &#145;The Doctrine of Grace&#146;</span>, 1764, 7). The work also drew eloquent criticisms from John Andrews, a clergyman of Warburton's diocese, and Thomas Leland, of Trinity College, Dublin, both of whom felt it too vituperative a work and one which potentially exposed the Church of England to doctrinal assault concerning the nature of grace from more orthodox protestants. Thomas Hartley condemned Warburton's views in an appendix to his <span class="italic">Paradise Restored</span> (1764). Samuel Chandler defended Warburton against Wesley but there was otherwise little support for <span class="italic">The Doctrine of Grace</span>. Warburton's work on the doctrine of the sacraments, <span class="italic">A Rational Account of the Nature and End of the Lord's Supper</span> (1761), was, surprisingly perhaps, quietly received. The 1760s proved the zenith of Warburton's controversial career, climaxing in the quarrel with Lowth, and this was at least as much a consequence of his political as of his theological opinions. Lowth's words in his 1765 <span class="italic">Letter</span> to Warburton had done their work: &#145;I am a staunch Republican and a zealous Protestant in Literature, nor will ever bear with a Perpetual Dictator, or an Infallible Pope, whose Decrees are to be submitted to without appeal, and to be received with implicit assent&#146;  (p. 133).<h2>
<a name="Warburtonthewhig"></a>Warburton the whig</h2>Warburton had always profited from his strict adherence to the interests of the whig party. His dedication of the second volume of <span class="italic">The Divine Legation</span> to Lord Chesterfield had resulted in the offer of an Irish chaplaincy in 1745, when Chesterfield was made lord lieutenant, an offer which subsequently fell through when family duties made it impossible for Warburton to leave England, a decision which Chesterfield much respected. A new edition of <span class="italic">The Alliance</span> was also dedicated to Chesterfield, in 1747. Warburton was, however, no mere place-seeker: he was a staunchly loyal whig and he published two strongly anti-Jacobite sermons when Charles Edward Stuart's forces were in England. The politico-theology of these sermons was challenged as extreme by Henry Stebbing, a critic of <span class="italic">The Divine Legation</span>, and Warburton replied to him in equally strong terms in <span class="italic">An Apologetical Dedication to the Reverend Dr Henry Stebbing</span> (1746), virtually accusing him of crypto-Jacobitism. Warburton's dual standing as Pope's editor and whig churchman was satirized in an anonymous work, <span class="italic">Proposals for printing, by subscription, in one volume in quarto, a commentary critical and theological upon the learned Mr William Warburton's apologetical dedication to the Reverend Dr Henry Stebbing</span> (1746), the tone of which reveals just how unpopular Warburton had become with many of his critics. This is also apparent in William Dodd's satire, <span class="italic">A New Dunciad</span>. Warburton's denunciations of freethinkers also gained him enemies in the sceptical camp, most notably David Hume. Warburton had originally thought Hume too low a specimen of the sceptical breed to notice but he felt obliged to respond to Hume's <span class="italic">Natural History of Religion</span> with <span class="italic">Remarks</span> (1757). Even then he felt it proper to publish the <span class="italic">Remarks</span> anonymously, completing the work with Hurd's assistance. Hume was unimpressed by the performance. In a letter to William Strahan of 25 June 1771 he made an observation that would have been shared by many other writers:<blockquote>It is petulance, and Insolence and abuse, that distinguish the Warburtonian School, even above all other Parsons and Theologians &hellip; I remember Lord Mansfield said to me that Warburton was a very opposite man in company to what he was in his Books; then, replyd I, he must be the most agreeable Companion in Europe, for surely he is the most odious Writer. (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2.244)</blockquote>A consistent whig in his politics, Warburton had been notably loyal to Newcastle and then to Lord Chancellor Hardwicke, who rewarded him with a prebend at Gloucester in 1754. Warburton profitably exchanged this for one at Durham, in whose chapter library he read widely. It was at Durham that he critically annotated a copy of Daniel Neal's <span class="italic">History of the Puritans</span> in preparation for his assault on Methodism, an early manuscript preparation of which, &#145;The true Methodist, or, Christian in earnest&#146;, revised in July 1755, is in the John Rylands Library at Manchester (MS 253 AB). In 1754 he became a chaplain to the king and was granted a Canterbury DD by Archbishop Herring. He regularly exchanged letters with Charles Yorke, the future attorney-general, a correspondence (published in 1812) in which his wife occasionally joined in successfully seeking a naval command for her brother (BL, Egerton 1952, fols. 223&#150;4, 226, 228, 230). In 1757 Warburton was made dean of Bristol, and through the local interest of Allen and of William Pitt, an admirer and frequent correspondent, he was made bishop of Gloucester in 1760 (holding his Durham prebend <i>in commendam</i>). This did not win universal approval and Horace Walpole later observed that Pitt had promoted him &#145;to the opposition of the whole episcopal bench&#146;, as Warburton's &#145;doubtful Christianity &hellip; writings and turbulent arrogance made him generally obnoxious&#146;  (Walpole, 85). Warburton's principled whiggery was expressed in his sermon to the House of Lords on 31 January 1760 and in a sermon condemning slavery which he delivered in 1766 to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts.<br>
<br>Warburton's political associations, combined with his monopoly on Pope's writings, served to expose him to the ire of John Wilkes, who grotesquely parodied the bishop's minute and pugnacious style of annotation in the notes to his notorious <span class="italic">Essay on Woman</span> (1763), a clandestine work that Warburton, the earl of Sandwich, and Lord Mansfield sought out and suppressed. The notes, attributed to Warburton, were as obscene as the poem itself. This attack on Wilkes, widely perceived as a &#145;patriot&#146;, gained Warburton further notoriety, and he was condemned for it at some length by the clerical poet Charles Churchill, in <span class="italic">The Duellist</span> (1764) and in the dedication to his posthumously published <span class="italic">Sermons</span> (1765). In <span class="italic">The Duellist</span> Warburton's pride, meanness, ambition, gracelessness, and hypocrisy were blended with allusions to his writings, leading Churchill to a curt dismissal with which many contemporaries would have concurred:<blockquote>
<div>A great Divine, as Lords agree,<br>
</div>
<div>Without the least Divinity;<br>
</div>
<div>To crown all, in a declining age,<br>
</div>
<div>Enflam'd with Church and Party-rage,<br>
</div>
<div>Behold him, full and perfect quite,<br>
</div>
<div>A false Saint, and true Hypocrite.<br>
</div> (bk 3, ll. 806&#150;10)</blockquote>Churchill also libelled Warburton and his wife in this poem, claiming that their only child (who was to predecease both) was not Warburton's at all; he was rumoured by some to be the son of his chaplain, and by others to be the son of the wit Thomas Potter (1673/4&#150;1747). His widow subsequently married another chaplain, Martin Stafford Smith, in 1781. Walpole greatly enjoyed Warburton's apparent discomfiture during the Lords' debate on Wilkes in 1763, and he claimed that Warburton had subsequently used his connections to try to gain the bishopric of London for himself as a recompense for the abuse that he had suffered from Wilkes and his allies. Warburton certainly believed that he deserved better than the see of Gloucester, and his letters to Hurd reveal the suspicions and envies of a disappointed man.<h2>
<a name="Declinedeathandposthumousreputation"></a>Decline, death, and posthumous reputation</h2>Warburton fell into a rapid decline in the wake of the controversies of the 1760s. He left Prior Park to reside in Gloucester in 1769, where he had a serious fall in his library in 1770, from the effects of which he never recovered. The loss of his young son (<i>b</i>. 1756) in 1775 exacerbated his illness, and he fell into senility, dying in the bishop's palace at Gloucester on 7 June 1779. He was buried in the cathedral, where his widow erected a monument to him bearing an inscription by Hurd. Hurd continued to correspond with her after she remarried, especially regarding the edition of Warburton's works, about which Hurd was very careful. He wrote to her on 23 March 1784, noting:<blockquote>We have reduced the expense as low as possible by printing only 200 copies, &amp; by agreeing for a Head to be engraved from the picture at Gloucester at 20&pound;, &amp; for examining the Greek &amp; Latin quotations, which must be done with care, 20&pound; more. (BL, Egerton 1958, fol. 98<i>v</i>)</blockquote>Hurd and Mrs Stafford Smith were Warburton's closest posthumous allies. The Warburtonian party had never been large, encompassing John Towne, Thomas Balguy, Jonathan Toup, and (though they later fell out) John Brown, whose <span class="italic">Estimate</span> Warburton had much enjoyed. He especially favoured Brown's critique of Shaftesbury's moral doctrine in his <span class="italic">Essays on the Characteristics</span>; Warburton had always detested Shaftesbury and frequently bemoaned his influence on what he derided as fashionable opinion. Warburton had written a preface to Catharine Cockburn's <span class="italic">Remarks</span>, on Thomas Rutherforth, in 1747 but otherwise wrote sparingly on moral theory. He had neither the aptitude nor the inclination to write in a philosophical manner, devoting himself instead to historical and literary defences of Christianity. His reputation in the mid-eighteenth century was high but the changing nature of apologetic, which would favour such divines as Joseph Butler, meant that it fell into obsolescence with remarkable speed.<br>
<br>As early as 1785 John Disney observed that &#145;Few learned theological books have been more universally read in their day, than Mr. Warburton's <span class="roman">Divine legation</span>, and still fewer of those which have been so much noticed, have been so soon neglected, disregarded and forgotten&#146;  (Disney, 269). Disney believed that the engagement with Lowth had proved decisive in Warburton's decline. When in conversation with &#145;three very learned and respectable dignitaries of the established church&#146; Disney noted that all wondered whether Warburton's writings had better served the cause of infidelity than they had Christianity  (ibid., 270). The seven-volume edition of his works financed by his widow under the editorship of Hurd, which appeared in 1788, signally failed to make an impact; it contained some hitherto unpublished material, notably parts of the uncompleted ninth book of <span class="italic">The Divine Legation</span>, <span class="italic">Directions for the Study of Theology</span>, and Warburton's notes on Neal's <span class="italic">History of the Puritans</span>. His reputation was further harmed when Samuel Parr, an opponent of what he identified as the small Warburtonian party in the church, published the long-disowned <span class="italic">Enquiry into the Causes of Prodigies and Miracles</span> in <span class="italic">Tracts by Warburton and a Warburtonian</span> (1789). Not all of his readers were so dismissive, however: George Grote, in making manuscript notes from his writings, had been convinced by the argument of Warburton's <span class="italic">Julian</span>  (BL, Add. MS 29524, fols. 80&#150;86), an admiration in which the secular historian had been unpredictably joined by Joseph Milner, the pre-eminent evangelical church historian. The publication in 1809 of the letters between Hurd and Warburton added to this sense of a re-evaluation of the bishop and his works. In 1828 a prominent evangelical, James Garbett, published an Oxford fellowship dissertation, <span class="italic">An Essay on Warburton's &#145;Divine Legation&#146;</span> (1828), which contained judicious praise as well as a level of predictable censure. Gladstone strongly condemned the teaching of the <span class="italic">Alliance</span> in <span class="italic">The State in its Relations with the Church</span> (1838), although Macaulay was a little more accommodating of the Warburtonian thesis in his <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> account of Gladstone's book. Francis Kilvert published an edition of the previously unpublished papers in 1841 and John Selby Watson produced a notably unsympathetic biography in 1863. Mark Pattison wrote excellently about Warburton, both as a subject in himself and as an editor of Pope's poetry, while essays concerning him by both Leslie and James Fitzjames Stephen appeared in the 1870s; he is also interestingly examined in Leslie Stephen's <span class="italic">History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century</span> (1878). A. W. Evans produced a well-balanced and sympathetic biography in 1932. Warburton's significance has been increasingly recognized by literary historians and by such intellectual historians as J. G. A. Pocock, as well as by Jacques Derrida, in <span class="italic">Of Grammatology</span>, an instance of his continuing relevance to European, as much as to British, intellectual history.<br>
