<span class="headword">Mauleverer, Sir  Thomas</span>, first baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1599, <em>d.</em> 1655), <span class="occ">politician and regicide</span>, was born at Allerton Mauleverer, Yorkshire, and baptized there on 9 April 1599, the eldest son of Sir Richard Mauleverer of Allerton Mauleverer (<i>c</i>.1528&#150;1603), high sheriff of Yorkshire in 1588, and his second wife, Katherine, daughter of Sir Ralph Bourchier of Beningbrough and his first wife, Elizabeth. He matriculated from St John's College, Cambridge, in 1616 and was admitted to Gray's Inn on 22 October 1617. His first wife was Mary, daughter of Sir Richard Hutton, justice of the common pleas. In 1622 he married his second wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1653), daughter of Thomas Wilbraham of Woodhey, Cheshire. In 1630 he was prosecuted for failure to compound in distraint of knighthood and during the 1630s he served regularly as a West Riding JP alongside Ferdinando Fairfax. In July 1640 he signed the Yorkshire gentry's petition against the king's billeting of soldiers, and he was elected MP for Boroughbridge that November. The king created him a baronet on 4 August 1641, but his association with the Fairfaxes led him to sign their anti-royalist declaration at Otley on 29 August 1642. Ferdinando, now Baron Fairfax and parliament's general in Yorkshire, appointed him to negotiate the neutrality treaty concluded at Rothwell on 29 September, but the truce soon collapsed and Mauleverer was besieged by royalists in his home at Allerton Mauleverer. On 23 October, Fairfax sent a troop of horse to rescue him, and Mauleverer was subsequently appointed a colonel, raising a troop of horse and regiment of foot.<br>
<br>In January 1643 Mauleverer appeared sixth on the royalists' list of Yorkshire traitors and he has been described as &#145;one of the most zealous parliamentarians in Yorkshire&#146;  (Cliffe, 338). Thomas Gent defamed him as &#145;one of those Black-Guards of Usurpation&#146;, alleging that his unruly soldiers &#145;in a sacrilegious Manner, broke the windows and defac'd the Monuments&#146; in the collegiate church of Ripon  (T. Gent, <span class="italic">Ancient and Modern History of the Loyal Town of Ripon</span>, 1733, 118). By May 1643 he was a sequestrator and a member of parliament's county committee. He was among Fairfax's army routed at Adwalton Moor on 30 June, but escaped with Fairfax on a boat from Selby to Hull. With the royalists about to besiege Hull, on 27 August Fairfax appointed him to seek out traitors and spies in the town. In January 1644 Mauleverer accompanied Sir Thomas Fairfax into Cheshire to relieve Nantwich. During his absences Allerton Mauleverer was plundered, and he later accused Sir William Ingram of seizing corn valued at &pound;500 in his tithe barn.<br>
<br>On 7 November 1645 Mauleverer informed Speaker Lenthall that the parliamentarian forces refused to reduce Skipton Castle, urging their immediate payment, the removal of the Scots from Yorkshire, and that excise money be used locally. On 3 May 1647 he submitted his pay accounts, and his son-in-law, Thomas Scot, brought his petition before the Commons for reimbursement of his &pound;15,000 war expenses. Both houses voted &pound;1000 from the excise and ordered the committee for northern affairs to organize further repayments. Mauleverer attended the king's trial and signed the death warrant [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. He remained as a West Riding JP, but his public career ended when the Rump Parliament was dismissed in 1653. He had died by 9 June 1655, but was exempted from the Restoration <span class="roman">Act of Pardon</span>.<br>
<br>His eldest son, <a name="cosubject_18372"></a><span class="headword">Sir Richard Mauleverer</span>, second baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1623, <em>d.</em> 1675), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Allerton Mauleverer and baptized there on 28 September 1623. He was admitted to Gray's Inn on 12 July 1641, and on 10 August the next year married Anne (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1622), daughter of Sir Robert Clarke of Pleshey, Essex. His father granted him an annuity of &pound;500, which was subsequently removed for his disobedient royalism. He was knighted for his royalist service at Christ Church, Oxford, on 27 March 1645. After the war he petitioned that he declared himself to the committee for compounding, and owing to his debts of &pound;1500 he was fined only &pound;4 6<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. until his annuity could be recovered. Declared an outlaw in 1654, he was captured during a royalist rising in Yorkshire the following year. He made a daring escape from Chester Castle on 26 March, reaching The Hague in June. Imprisoned on his return to London in 1659, he was released on bail in September. He joined the king at Breda and was appointed a gentleman of the privy chamber in June 1660. He was commissioned as colonel of militia, and his baronetcy and estates, valued at &pound;1200 per year, were restored. He was elected MP for Boroughbridge on 8 April 1661 and was commissioned as captain in Lord Gerard's regiment in 1666. He remained an inactive court MP, and was granted &pound;200 royal bounty on 30 April 1675. He was buried in Westminster Abbey on 25 July 1675.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_18371"></a><span class="headword">John Mauleverer</span>  (<em>c.</em>1610&#150;1650), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the eldest son of John Mauleverer of Letwell, Yorkshire, and his second wife, Margaret, daughter of John Lewis of Marr, Yorkshire. He married Dorcas, daughter of John Matthew and granddaughter of Toby Matthew, archbishop of York. In the civil wars he sided with the Fairfaxes, who commissioned him as colonel. He headed the list of prisoners taken by the royalists in Bradford in July 1643 but escaped or was exchanged, because by 1644 he commanded Hull's garrison regiment. The Fairfaxes nominated him as Hull's lieutenant-governor, and the town's MP, Peregrine Pelham, informed the corporation on 15 April 1645:<blockquote>I p'ceive by your Northerne Burgesses that they have noe desire that Mr Malleveror should command at Hull. They say he is strange to them, and soe he is to most of the House. He would not have been nominated in the House without much difficulty. (T. Tindall Wildridge, ed., <span class="italic">The Hull Letters: Documents from the Hull Records, 1625&#150;46</span>, 1886, 63)</blockquote>On 14 April 1646 Mauleverer was admitted as an elder brother to Hull Trinity House, and on 13 June Fairfax thanked him for refusing Mrs Hotham's demands to search Sir John Hotham's townhouse for property Fairfax had confiscated. In 1648 Mauleverer's regiment helped besiege Pontefract and in 1650 they were allotted to Cromwell's army invading Scotland. He died from fatigue at Edinburgh in December 1650, and Cromwell recalled: &#145;he had a spirit very much beyond his natural strength of body, having undergone many fits of sickness during his hard service in the field&#146;  (T. Carlyle, <span class="italic">Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell</span>, ed. S. C. Lomas, 3 vols., 1904, 3.272).<br>
