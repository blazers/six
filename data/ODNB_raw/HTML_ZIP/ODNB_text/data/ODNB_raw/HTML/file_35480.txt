<span class="headword">Perkins,  Robert Cyril Layton</span>  (1866&#150;1955), <span class="occ">entomologist</span>, was born on 15 November 1866 at Badminton, Gloucestershire, the second of the five children of the Revd Charles Mathew Perkins and his wife, Agnes Martha Beach, daughter of the Revd Percy Thomas. His grandfather, father, and uncle were all interested in natural history and Perkins himself showed an interest in the subject from a very early age. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School (1877&#150;85) and Jesus College, Oxford, where after two years he changed from classics to science, obtaining a fourth class in 1889. His first great interest in entomology was Lepidoptera, but contact with Edward Saunders during his last years at school fostered an interest in Aculeata (stinging wasps, ants, and bees), which he retained throughout his life.<br>
<br>Perkins briefly worked as a private tutor at Dartmouth, but in 1891 was selected by the Sandwich Islands committee (set up by the British Association and the Royal Society) to go as collector to the Hawaiian Islands. There he spent the greater part of the next ten years collecting all groups of terrestrial animals&#151;returning to England periodically to work on the results. His expeditions into the islands' interiors were almost always made alone, since local porters refused to stay in the forest. As a result each trip was limited to about six weeks as, being short and spare in stature, he was unable to carry equipment for a longer stay.<br>
<br>In 1895 Perkins met Albert Koebele, and in the next few years helped him with the liberation of insect parasites which Koebele was sending to Honolulu for the control of pests. In 1897 they visited Mexico, where, from observations of the <i>Lantana</i> weed, they started the successful use of insects in controlling its spread in the Hawaiian Islands. In 1901 Perkins married Zo&euml; Lucy Sherrard Alatau (<i>d</i>. 1940), daughter of A. T. Atkinson, sometime superintendent of public schools in the Hawaiian Islands, and granddaughter of Thomas Witlam Atkinson. Of their four sons, one died in infancy. From 1902 to 1904 Perkins worked for the board of agriculture of the Territory of Hawaii, organizing inspection of imported plants to prevent the introduction of pests.<br>
<br>In 1904 Perkins became director of the new division of entomology at the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association's experimental station. The most urgent problem was to prevent the havoc then being wrought by the sugar cane leafhopper. No suitable means could be found of applying insecticides in cane fields, and so Perkins and Koebele went to Australia to collect the parasites of leafhoppers in the cane fields there, where the insects appeared to cause little damage. After returning to the Hawaiian Islands they raised stocks of the parasites for liberation and dispersal in the cane fields, where their introduction proved of great benefit. This work occupied Perkins throughout the day. At night he spent long hours studying the classification of these insects, of which little was known. He was able to correlate various biological observations with taxonomy, particularly in the Dryinidae, and the results of this work were published by the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association in a series of bulletins.<br>
<br>Perkins retired to England from his post in 1912 on account of ill health and settled in Devon, but was retained on the staff as a consulting entomologist. From then on his work on Hawaiian insects was concerned mainly with taxonomy. He also resumed his study of the British Aculeata which led to a series of papers on the species of the larger and more difficult genera, greatly simplifying their recognition. Associated with this work, he studied the <i>Stylops</i> parasites of British bees. He had a large correspondence and often gave help to young students of Aculeata. He encouraged a continued interest in the group, which was consequently one of the best worked of the order in Britain, both systematically and biologically. In the early 1920s Perkins helped the Revd F. D. Morice in his contemplated revision of the group of British sawflies, work which led to preliminary revisions of some of the critical genera.<br>
<br>In addition to his entomological work, Perkins had interests in terrestrial zoology and he supplied information on the Hawaiian birds, many of which later became extinct. He had most acute vision and a remarkable visual memory, which aided both his field and his taxonomic work. In the latter he had a faculty for observing and selecting characters which vary little within a species, thus making identification simpler.<br>
<br>Although not robust, Perkins had a great interest in sport. In his young days he enjoyed skating, and at Dartmouth he used to run with the beagles. Above all else he preferred trout fishing, which he continued until his eyesight began to fail. He retained his great interest in classics throughout his life.<br>
<br>In 1906 Perkins was awarded an Oxford DSc and in 1912 he received the gold medal of the Linnean Society of London. He was elected FRS in 1920. Following the death of his first wife, he married, in 1942, Mrs Clara M. J. Senior (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Dowse); she died in 1949. In his last days Perkins went blind; he died at his home, Wotton, Newton Road, Bovey Tracey, on 29 September 1955.<br>
