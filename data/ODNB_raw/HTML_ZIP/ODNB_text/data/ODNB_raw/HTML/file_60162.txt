<span class="headword">Wood,  Sancton</span>  (1815&#150;1886), <span class="occ">architect and surveyor</span>, was born in April 1815 at Hackney, Middlesex, the youngest of six children and the only son of John Wood and his wife, Harriet Russell, who was a member of the Smirke family of Wigton, Cumberland. His father was a member of an old and prosperous Cumberland family, who moved to London to pursue a business in cotton goods. Sancton took his forename from his uncle Philip Sancton, a successful London merchant, who had married his father's sister. He first entered a small private school in Devon, and then moved to a school at Hazelwood, Birmingham, run by T. W. Hill whose son Sir Rowland Hill (1795&#150;1879) was author of the penny postal system. The school was run &#145;To leave as much as possible, all power in the hands of the boys themselves&#146;  (M. D. Hill, <span class="italic">Public Education</span>, 1822), a philosophy that failed to stimulate young Sancton Wood into serious study. Nevertheless his interest in drawing and family influence gained him a pupillage in the office of his cousin Sir Robert Smirke RA (1780&#150;1867), followed by employment with Sydney Smirke RA (1798&#150;1877). His contemporaries recalled his quiet retiring nature, sometimes excitable, but always courteous. He married <i>c</i>.1844, and he and his wife, Elizabeth Sarah (1813/14&#150;1875), had two sons, Herbert (<i>b</i>. 1845) and William Winder (<i>b</i>. 1846). His wife and both sons predeceased him.<br>
<br>Wood's impeccable classical training in architecture and presentation, learned in Smirke's office, gained him early recognition. In 1837 he designed one of London's first railway termini, at Shoreditch for the Eastern Counties Railway. Budget restraint limited the scope of work, but success in competitions followed, beginning with a &pound;100 prize for Ipswich station. Then in 1845 he headed a field of sixty-five competitors for the design of Kingsbridge terminus and company offices, Dublin (now known as Heuston station). The magnificent two-storey office block, nine bays wide by five bays deep, is dominated by attached Corinthian columns between the first-floor pedimented windows. The enclosing single-storey wing walls to the platforms are linked to the office block by an intervening domed turret at each corner. In 1846 he won the &pound;100 prize for Blackburn station. Links with Irish railways led to further work for the Great Southern and Western, between Dublin and Cork, and the Limerick Junction line. He also designed the stand at the Curragh racecourse. Other railway commissions included stations on the Rugby and Stamford line (1846), and Syston and Peterborough route (1847).<br>
<br>Wood was elected an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1841, an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1848, and an associate of the Institution of Surveyors, also in 1848. Commercial buildings, schools, churches, and estate development, principally in the London area, were credited to him. These included the Queen's Assurance Company office (1852) at the south-west corner of King Street and Gresham Street; the Lime Grove estate, Putney; Hackney town hall (1864); and terrace houses, Lancaster Gate (1857). Interest in surveying led to his appointment as district surveyor for Putney and Roehampton, followed by a similar appointment at St Luke's, Chelsea (from 1866). He was a member of the examining board for district surveyors.<br>
<br>In 1850 Wood, his wife, and their two sons moved to 11 Putney Hill, London, a detached house of his own design where Wood died on 18 April 1886. He was buried six days later in the same grave as his wife and sons, at Putney Lower Common cemetery. His probate records his estate valued at &pound;15,470.<br>
