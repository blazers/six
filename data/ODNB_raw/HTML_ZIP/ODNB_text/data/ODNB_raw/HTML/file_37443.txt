<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Garrod,  Dorothy Annie Elizabeth</span>  (1892&#150;1968), <span class="occ">archaeologist and prehistorian</span>, was born on 5 May 1892 at 9 Chandos Street, London, the second of four children and only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33339/', "Sir Archibald Edward Garrod (1857&#150;1936)")</script>, physician, later first professor of medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital and regius professor of medicine at Oxford, and his wife, Laura Elisabeth (<i>d</i>. 1940), daughter of Sir Thomas Smith, first baronet, surgeon. She was initially educated at home, where her governess, Isabel Fry, was the first in a series of inspirational teachers. Birklands School, St Albans, prepared her for entrance to Cambridge University; she read history (1913&#150;16) at Newnham College, with which she began a lifelong association. During the First World War two brothers and her (unofficial) fianc&eacute; were killed; her youngest brother died of influenza in 1919 before demobilization. Her own war service (1917&#150;19) with the Catholic Women's League (she converted to Roman Catholicism in 1913) took her to France and Germany, then after the armistice to Malta, where her father was head of war hospitals. It was his suggestion that she occupy her mind among the island's spectacular prehistoric antiquities.<br>
<br>The family's move to Oxford enabled Dorothy Garrod to study for the university diploma in anthropology, gained with distinction in 1921, under the legendary R. R. Marett, who regarded the study of prehistory as no longer an amateur pastime but a branch of science in its own right. She had pledged to compensate her bereaved parents by achieving a life worthy of the family's formidable intellectual tradition  (Caton-Thompson, 341). She now found her goal, to be a prehistorian of the palaeolithic, the Old Stone Age.<br>
<br>Through Marett, Dorothy Garrod met the great men of French prehistory and saw the wonders of the painted caves; at Count B&eacute;gou&euml;n's house, the Abb&eacute; Henri Breuil agreed to take her as his pupil at the Institut de Pal&eacute;ontologie Humaine in Paris (1922&#150;4). During these years she gained fieldwork experience at palaeolithic sites including La Quina with Henri Martin, Les Eyzies (Denis Peyrony), and in Corr&egrave;ze (Jean Bouyssonie). At this time also she attracted the notice of George Grant MacCurdy of Yale University, then planning the creation of his American School of Prehistoric Research (ASPR). With Breuil's encouragement she gathered material for her first book <span class="italic">The Upper Palaeolithic in Britain</span> (1926), hitherto unsynthesized, for which she was awarded a BSc degree from Oxford.<br>
<br>To Breuil also Garrod owed her own first major excavation at the Devil's Tower, Gibraltar, discovered by him during wartime missions to Spain. Here she found the middle palaeolithic Mousterian flint industry known from her French studies, thereafter a central interest, and five skull fragments of a Neanderthal child. Though she was not a woman given to sentiment, this discovery made a deep impression. She gave the child the resonant name Abel, recording the date of his disinterment, age at death, and probable age before present (22,000 years) in her private photograph album. The rare ability shown in the digging and publication (1928) of the site established her place in palaeolithic studies. She was appointed&#151;the only woman and youngest member&#151;to the international commission charged in 1927 with investigating the notorious Glozel affair. The commission considered that artefacts of a supposed ancient civilization found at Glozel (near Vichy) were fraudulent, though counter-claims were made, some&#151;unjustly&#151;against Dorothy Garrod herself. She considered the whole affair absurd, although belief in a &#145;Glozelian civilization&#146; has proved curiously persistent.<br>
<br>The years 1928&#150;37 were largely concerned with western Asia and determined Garrod's lasting reputation. Prehistoric archaeology in Palestine under British mandate, though still in its infancy, showed signs of great potential. The patronage of MacCurdy and Sir John Linton Myres, both anxious to explore this field of research, was among the factors which led to her excavation in the Judaean cave of Shukba, in the Wadi en-Natuf, for the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem. Overlying a Mousterian occupation level were human remains associated with a previously unknown mesolithic culture she named&#151;after the wadi&#151;Natufian. Later in 1928 she excavated two caves in southern Kurdistan, Hazar Merd (Mousterian) and Zarzi (late upper palaeolithic). The area, unexplored in prehistoric terms, was as troubled then as later; this apparently held no fears for her, though her small team worked under armed police escort. In Palestine further work at Shukba was abandoned in favour of the need to excavate a group of caves in the Wadi el-Mughara, Mount Carmel, recently reprieved from destruction by quarrying. Dorothy Garrod was appointed director of the Anglo-American expedition which began work in spring 1929. The series of seven seasons' work at Mount Carmel (1929&#150;34) was to prove the most important in her archaeological career.<br>
<br>At El-Wad cave Garrod found again the distinctive Natufian culture first identified at Shukba, but here in a far richer phase of decorated burials with a complex tool kit of worked stone and bone. Flint blades hafted into bone sickles persuaded her that the Natufians were practising an early form of agriculture. The deepest (Mousterian) of seven archaeological levels in El-Wad corresponded to the uppermost undisturbed level of a further seven in Tabun cave nearby, extending down to a pre-handaxe stone industry at the deepest level. By skilled typological analysis of tens of thousands of stone implements recovered from the Carmel caves she established an almost unbroken cultural sequence, now known to span some 600,000 years or more of human activity, thus imposing order on the hitherto incoherent archaeology of the Levant. In addition to the Natufian burials, the caves contained older human remains. In Tabun cave an adult Mousterian female with Neanderthal characteristics was found, while under her direction T. D. McCown found at Skhul cave a virtual cemetery of ten Mousterian individuals with features more similar to modern humans.<br>
<br>The young Jacquetta Hawkes, at Mount Carmel during the 1932 season, remembered the personal and professional qualities of her director:<blockquote>Small (5 ft. 2 in.), composed and neat beside her fellahin workers&#151;girls in brightly ballooning skirts and a few lusty pick-men&#151;her command of them was absolute. When a builder tried to cheat her she overwhelmed him, thumping the table, her normally calm eyes glaring. In the cool peace of the evening after a good dinner there were a few classical records to be played or she might take up her flute. Her talk (low-pitched) was sometimes witty, always congenial. (<span class="italic">DNB</span>)</blockquote>By the final season (1934) the excavation's surviving daily journal shows how these qualities were tested by the immensity of the task, as anxieties over funding, sickness among her workers, and the privations of daily living all drew on her reserves of courage and humour.Garrod had begun the Mount Carmel excavation as a research fellow at Newnham College (1929&#150;32); she finished it as director of studies (1933&#150;42). She now returned to Cambridge to prepare her final report (including the faunal analysis by D. M. A. Bate). <span class="italic">The Stone Age of Mount Carmel</span>, 1 (1937) established a new standard for its time, recognized by the award of the degree of DSc by Oxford University.<br>
<br>Garrod's continuing interest in palaeolithic migration patterns underlay a survey in Anatolia undertaken for the ASPR in 1938. When bureaucratic delays proved unacceptable, she moved on to Bulgaria, then another largely unexplored area. A short excavation in Bacho Kiro cave established the first prehistoric sequence in eastern Europe, with possible evidence of a westward movement by modern humans across the continent in the early upper palaeolithic. Described as calm, self-assured, perfectly confident, and authoritative, Garrod is remembered by an expedition member, Bruce Howe, as &#145;unique, rather like a glass of pale fine stony French white wine&#146;  (private information, Howe).<br>
<br>On 6 May 1939 Dorothy Garrod was elected Cambridge University's Disney professor of archaeology, becoming the first woman to hold a chair at Cambridge or Oxford. No hint of controversy surrounds this important election. Renowned for her excavations, Garrod was clearly chosen for her qualifications. Although women became eligible for all Cambridge University teaching offices and for membership of faculties and faculty boards in 1926, in 1939 they were still not admissible to degrees, were not yet full members of the university, and thus could not become members of its governing bodies. Garrod's election as professor highlighted this inherent contradiction, accentuated the need for administrative change, and added weight to the argument that women should be allowed to graduate from Cambridge. The event was greeted with joy by the women's colleges and was heralded by the wider community as an immense step towards complete equality with men. Full membership for women in the university followed in 1948.<br>
<br>In 1942 Garrod was recruited to the RAF Medmenham unit for photographic interpretation, where she served as a section officer, mapping the effects of allied bombing: she was remembered as superbly efficient. Returning to Cambridge in 1945, she gained a reputation as a conscientious, hard-working administrator with a strong distaste for petty politics. In 1946 she proposed that archaeology became part of the full Cambridge tripos. Her endless committee labour resulted in the institutionalization of the desired curriculum and full degree in 1948.<br>
<br>Fieldwork was maintained during Garrod's professorial years by excavation in France during long vacations with her closest friends, Germaine Henri-Martin at Font&eacute;chevade (Charente) and Suzanne de St Mathurin at Angles sur l'Anglin (Vienne). On retirement in 1952 she settled permanently in France. Now free to resume her own research, she began the long-postponed task of relating the prehistoric sequence of the Levant with that of Europe. Her plan (before absolute dating methods became available) was to correlate the Quaternary sea levels of the eastern Mediterranean with the periodic glaciations in Europe; the ancient beaches and caves of the Lebanese coast provided evidence no longer existing in Palestine. Five years (1958&#150;63) of strenuous excavation were necessary to produce the correlation she sought, with a relative succession which&#151;though greatly extended by modern dating methods&#151;remains valid. Nevertheless her health was overtaxed in the process and continued to decline. In June 1968, while writing up her Lebanese work for publication and shortly after receiving&#151;again as the first woman&#151;the gold medal of the Society of Antiquaries, she suffered a stroke from which she did not recover. She died at the Hope House (Catholic) nursing home in Cambridge on 18 December 1968. Her ashes were buried in her parents' grave at Melton, Suffolk.<br>
<br>Dorothy Garrod's reputation, and appreciation of her pioneering work in prehistoric archaeology, has increased as research in her subject has grown during the years since her death. The excavation techniques of her day enabled her to see long stratigraphic sequences and define basic frameworks on which her successors could safely build. Through her work in the Levantine caves, she identified and addressed crucial questions that still preoccupy prehistorians: the appearance of modern humans and extinction of Neanderthals during the middle palaeolithic, and the later mesolithic transition from nomadic hunter-gathering to settlement and agriculture. Her publications were prompt, thorough, and prolific (over one hundred academic papers and articles), and showed her continual readiness to revise her opinions and to learn. Her election as professor at Cambridge came to be celebrated as a milestone in the struggle to gain access to higher education for women in England. Using her degree plan, Cambridge has become a world centre for prehistoric studies.<br>
<br>In addition to her MA (Cambridge) and DSc (Oxford) degrees Garrod received honorary doctorates from Toulouse and Poitiers. She was a fellow of the British Academy (1952), the Royal Anthropological Institute (Huxley memorial medal, 1962), and the Society of Antiquaries (gold medal, 1968). She was appointed CBE (1965). She was unmarried.<br>
