<span class="headword">Fayrfax <span class="st"> [Fairfax]</span>,  Robert</span>  (1464&#150;1521), <span class="occ">composer and church musician</span>, was born on 23 April 1464 at Deeping Gate, Northamptonshire, the sixth of at least twelve children of William Fayrfax (<i>d</i>. 1498) and his second wife, Anne, daughter of Robert Tanfeld. The Fayrfaxes were typical minor gentry of the period, intermarrying with other armigerous families and creating ties of respect and obligation with their neighbours. The list of godparents and sponsors chosen by William and his wives for their children includes local worthies such as an abbot of Peterborough, an archdeacon of Leicester, and members of one of the richest mercantile families in the district. It also reveals sustained relationships with their landlord, Margaret Beauchamp, dowager duchess of Somerset, her children, and her household, who frequently resided at Maxey Castle nearby. When Margaret Beauchamp died in 1482 Maxey passed to her daughter Margaret Beaufort, who had often stayed there as a child. Three years later Margaret Beaufort became the first lady of the kingdom through her son's victory at Bosworth and accession as Henry VII. It seems likely that Fayrfax's career prospered by means of the patronage of this extremely influential family.<h2>
<a name="Life"></a>Life</h2>As the fourth son in a large brood, Fayrfax had little prospect of playing a leading role within his own family; he would have been expected to enter a profession befitting his status. A career as a church musician was evidently not considered demeaning for the son of a gentleman. Fayrfax may have received his musical training at one of three major collegiate churches in the neighbourhood: Fotheringhay, about 11 miles south-west of Deeping Gate, founded and lavishly maintained by the house of York; Higham Ferrers, some 16 miles further to the south-west; and Tattershall, about 30 miles to the north-east, recently created by Ralph, Lord Cromwell, but destined to pass into the hands of Margaret Beaufort in 1487.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Fayrfax's early career. At his first recorded mention he is already in his mid-thirties and among the &eacute;lite of his profession. Letters patent dated 6 December 1497, granting him the chaplaincy of Snodhill Castle, Herefordshire, describe him as a gentleman of (that is, a singer in) the royal household chapel. Clerks in royal service were often rewarded with chaplaincies and other benefices, and these seem to have been traded as commodities. Fayrfax resigned this chaplaincy after less than a year, doubtless because he had no intention of entering holy orders, and on 16 November 1498 it was reassigned to Robert Cowper, an ordained priest and probably later master of the choristers in Margaret Beaufort's household chapel. Like other favoured members of the royal household, Fayrfax sought and obtained nominations to corrodies or pensions from religious houses. On 29 March 1498 he was awarded a corrody in the monastery of Selby, Yorkshire, and on 4 December 1501 he was granted another in the monastery of Stanley, Wiltshire; he surrendered the latter in favour of another gentleman of the chapel, John Fyssher, on 21 February 1513.<br>
<br>Several membership lists of the royal household survive from the later years of Henry VII and the reign of Henry VIII, and Fayrfax appears among the gentlemen of the chapel in all of them until his death. In the earliest list, recording allocations of livery for the funeral of Prince Edmund (<i>d</i>. 19 June 1500), third son of Henry VII, he is named thirteenth out of fifteen gentlemen; in the next, for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth (23 February 1503), wife of Henry VII, he is named ninth out of eighteen; in the next, for the funeral of Henry VII himself (9 May 1509), he is named fifth out of eighteen. Since existing gentlemen's names move up these lists as names above them drop out and names of new gentlemen are added at the bottom, that Fayrfax's name moves up four places between June 1500 and February 1503 suggests that he cannot have joined the chapel long before the first mention of him in December 1497; otherwise there would probably have been more than two singers below him in 1500.<br>
<br>In 1502 Fayrfax became a member of the Confraternity of St Nicholas, a guild of London parish clerks which had many professional musicians among its members. He is probably the Robert Fairfax who leased property belonging to the chapel of St Thomas, London Bridge, between 1501 and 1506. Whatever may have happened earlier in his career, he certainly had dealings with Margaret Beaufort towards the end of her long life: on 4 December 1504 he was remunerated for unspecified services, and on 11 August 1507 she paid him 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. for &#145;a newe masse&#146;.<br>
<br>The accession of Henry VIII seems to have brought Fayrfax significant advancement. In the livery list for the new king's coronation (24 June 1509) he is named first among the gentlemen of the chapel, above four senior colleagues (including the master of the choristers, William Newark) whose names had preceded his in the list for the funeral of the king's father seven weeks earlier. He also heads the gentlemen in the livery list for the funeral of the infant Prince Henry (27 February 1511), when for the first time he is styled M. Doctor Farefax, and in the attendance list at the Field of Cloth of Gold in the summer of 1520. Between December 1509 and December 1513 he was paid for the board and teaching of two chapel choristers, William Alderson and Arthur Lovekyn, described as &#145;the king's scholars&#146;.<br>
<br>Fayrfax also received considerable financial rewards from Henry VIII. On 20 June 1509, four days before the coronation, he was awarded a lifetime annuity of &pound;9 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. (being 6<i>d</i>. per day); from 16 November 1513 he shared this annuity with one Robert Bithsey or Blithsee. On 10 September 1514 he was appointed a poor knight of the King's Alms at Windsor and granted 12<i>d</i>. a day for life. On each new year's day from 1516 to 1520 inclusive Fayrfax gave the king a present and had a generous payment in return: &pound;13 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. &#145;in Reward for a boke&#146;; &pound;20 &#145;for a boke of Antemys&#146;; &pound;20 &#145;for a pricksonge boke&#146;; &pound;20 &#145;for a balet bok lymned&#146;; and &pound;13 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. for an unspecified item. Gifts of this nature and on this scale, worth about double a singing-man's annual salary, suggest that his position at court was not that of a run-of-the-mill chapel musician.<br>
<br>Fayrfax seems to have been the first composer to hold degrees in music from both universities; he graduated BMus at Cambridge in 1501, took the MusD there in 1504, and was incorporated DMus at Oxford in 1511. At this time music degrees were usually awarded in recognition of compositional skill demonstrated in a test-piece. The heading &#145;Doctor ffeyrfax for his forme in proceadinge to bee Doctor&#146; in one copy of his mass <span class="italic">O quam glorifica</span> probably refers to the Cambridge doctorate; his exercise for the baccalaureate has not been identified.<br>
<br>For much of his life Fayrfax maintained an association with the Benedictine abbey of St Albans, the precise nature of which has yet to be established. Anthony Wood states that he was &#145;informator chori&#146; there. If this was the case, the choir in question is likely to have been that of the abbey's lady chapel rather than that of the monastic community itself, and Fayrfax can hardly have served as a full-time choirmaster at St Albans after joining the royal household chapel. The continuance of a more informal relationship could, however, have been facilitated or even encouraged by the royal family's own patronage of the abbey. Fayrfax was evidently in St Albans on 28 March 1502, when he received 20<i>s</i>. from Queen Elizabeth for &#145;an Anthem of oure lady and Saint Elisabeth&#146;, almost certainly the votive antiphon <span class="italic">Aeternae laudis lilium</span>. His antiphon <span class="italic">O Albane Deo grate</span> (which survives only in a Marian version, <span class="italic">O Maria Deo grata</span>) and mass <span class="italic">Albanus</span> must also have been composed for the abbey, but their style suggests that these are not among his later works.<br>
<br>For some weeks during what was to be the last year of his life Fayrfax was seconded to the service of Cardinal Wolsey, who held <i>in commendam</i> the abbacy of St Albans. Fayrfax had a residence in the parish of St Andrew, immediately adjacent to the north perimeter wall of the abbey, and it was in the abbey church that he was buried. A seventeenth-century sketch of the brass long vanished from his grave-slab shows him standing with his wife above the inscription: &#145;Pray for the soules of Master Robert ffayerfax doctor of music and Agnes his wife the w[hi]ch Robert decessed the xxiiii day of October the yeare M<sup>o</sup>. v<sup>c</sup>. xxi on whose soules Jh[es]u have mercy amen.&#146; Agnes outlived her husband, being granted letters of administration of his estate &#145;while he lived in the parish of St Andrews&#146; on 14 November 1521; nothing more is known of her. A grave-slab in the abbey church with indents roughly matching the brasses shown in the sketch of 1643 also has indents for two smaller brasses which probably depicted two sons and two daughters, but there seems to be no other evidence that Robert and Agnes had any children. Although this grave-slab was restored to mark the quatercentenary of Fayrfax's death in 1921, there is no conclusive evidence that it is his.<h2>
<a name="Works"></a>Works</h2>The esteem in which Fayrfax was held is attested by the surviving musical sources, which contain more music by him than by any other composer of his generation. Furthermore, some of his compositions were still being copied early in the seventeenth century, long after those of his contemporaries had been entirely forgotten. This implies something more than the respect owed to a famous composer; if Elizabethan and Jacobean musicians made copies of works by Fayrfax but ignored those of his contemporaries, it must surely have been at least partly because his style seemed less dated. The sobriety, lucidity, and persuasiveness of much of his music are indeed untypical of the period.<br>
<br>The extant works by Fayrfax comprise six masses, two settings of the <span class="roman">Magnificat</span>, ten votive antiphons, eight partsongs, and three textless pieces probably intended for instruments. Several other compositions, including some sequences copied for King's College, Cambridge, in 1508&#150;9, and a setting of the <span class="roman">Nunc dimittis</span>, are known only from contemporary references. Almost all of the sacred works are for five voices; Fayrfax's avoidance of more extravagant textures accords with his predominantly reticent style. The earlier compositions include the <span class="roman">Magnificat</span> <span class="italic">Regale</span> and the antiphons <span class="italic">Ave lumen gratiae</span> and <span class="italic">Salve regina</span>, which had been copied into the Eton choirbook <i>c</i>.1502&#150;4 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94452', "Composers of the Eton choirbook")</script>]. <span class="italic">Salve regina</span> could be the earliest of his known works; it is much more ornate than most of his music and contains examples of clumsy part-writing. The stiffness and rather aimless melodic style of the antiphon <span class="italic">O Albane Deo grate</span>/<span class="italic">O Maria Deo grata</span> and the mass <span class="italic">Albanus</span> could also imply a relatively early date of composition, perhaps antedating Fayrfax's entry into the royal household chapel. <span class="italic">Aeternae laudis lilium</span> was probably in existence by March 1502; the anonymous mass <span class="italic">Regali ex progenie</span> copied for King's College, Cambridge, in 1503&#150;4 may have been his; and the mass <span class="italic">O quam glorifica</span> (a prodigious demonstration of numerical virtuosity) is almost certainly his exercise for the Cambridge doctorate awarded in 1504. Fayrfax's other compositions cannot be dated except on grounds of style, but the superb craftsmanship and sense of timing evident in the mass <span class="italic">Tecum principium</span> and the antiphon <span class="italic">Maria plena virtute</span> suggest that these are among his most mature works. The eloquence of <span class="italic">Maria plena virtute</span> is unprecedented in English music; it is hard to believe that he could have created such a perfect marriage of words and music without some knowledge of the music of Josquin.<br>
<br>Fayrfax's masses are especially important in view of the great scarcity of works in this form surviving from composers of his generation. Five of them use the traditional method of composition upon a <i>cantus firmus</i> that had been established in English masses of the 1420s and was to continue as late as the reign of Mary Tudor. His <i>cantus firmus</i> treatment is quite varied: the very long <i>cantus firmus</i> of <span class="italic">O quam glorifica</span> is given only once in each movement, whereas <span class="italic">Albanus</span> states its nine-note <i>cantus firmus</i> forwards, backwards, upside down, and upside down and backwards thirty times. The mass <span class="italic">O bone Jesu</span> is not based on a <i>cantus firmus</i>, but shares musical material with Fayrfax's antiphon <span class="italic">O bone Jesu</span> (only one voice of which survives) and <span class="roman">Magnificat</span> <span class="italic">O bone Jesu</span>; the fragmentary state of the antiphon makes it impossible to explore the relationship exhaustively, but he seems here to have introduced to England the concept of the parody, or derived, mass.<br>
<br>Fayrfax was apparently unusually fond of linking works with each other: apart from the <span class="italic">O bone Jesu</span> mass, <span class="roman">Magnificat</span> and antiphon, the <span class="italic">Albanus</span> mass and the antiphon <span class="italic">O Albane</span>/<span class="italic">O Maria</span> share the same <i>cantus firmus</i>, and the antiphon <span class="italic">Gaude flore virginali</span> (whose bass voice alone survives) seems to have been written on the same <i>cantus firmus</i> as the mass <span class="italic">Regali ex progenie</span>. These groups of musically interrelated works for mass, vespers, and the evening devotion may perhaps be the ancestors of the services written by English composers after the Reformation.<br>
<br>Fayrfax's English songs resemble his church music in many respects: they are true partsongs, in which all of the (usually three or four) voices share the melodic material, and they show a careful attitude to word-setting and a concern for formal clarity. They are, however, generally a little more florid than the sacred compositions and they tend to exploit imitative writing more thoroughly. Most of them are contained in the Fayrfax manuscript  (BL, Add. MS 5465), a collection of songs by composers associated with the court of Henry VII, which belonged to a Yorkshire branch of the Fairfax family in the early seventeenth century.<br>
