<span class="headword">Payne,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1787), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was established in Paternoster Row, London, at least by 1745, working first alone and then in partnership with Joseph Bouquet until early 1752. From 1753 to 1758 Payne gave his address as &#145;Pope's Head in Pater noster Row&#146;, then simply as &#145;Pater noster Row&#146;, and from about 1765 &#145;The Feathers, Pater noster Row&#146;. Payne was sufficiently known to Samuel Johnson to be invited to join a club formed by Johnson in winter 1749, meeting every Tuesday evening at the King's Head in Ivy Lane near St Paul's, and later known as the Ivy Lane Club. It was through his friendship with Johnson that Payne published William Lauder's <span class="italic">Essay on Milton's Use and Imitation of the Moderns in his &#145;Paradise Lost&#146;</span> (1750), to which Johnson contributed. Lauder&#151;Scottish Latin scholar, schoolmaster, and armchair Jacobite&#151;had been working since at least 1745 to prove that Milton had plagiarized <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>, suggesting that the epic bore a strong resemblance to works of certain neo-Latin writers. When John Douglas discovered that portions of the passages of the neo-Latin writers quoted in the <span class="italic">Essay</span> were, in fact, passages from <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> translated into Latin, he exposed Lauder's forgeries in <span class="italic">Milton vindicated from the charge of plagiarism brought against him by Mr. Lauder and Lauder himself convicted of several forgeries and gross impositions on the public</span> (1751). It was clear to both Johnson and Payne that something had to be done to salvage their reputations. Payne and Bouquet placed an advertisement in the newspapers and wrote &#145;A new preface&#146; apologizing for the imposition on the public and attempting to explain how they had been deceived. Johnson wrote a &#145;New postscript&#146; in which further disclaimers were made, which, like the &#145;New preface&#146;, was printed separately to be inserted in unsold copies and to be distributed to those who had already bought copies. The friendship between Payne and Johnson does not appear to have been damaged by this episode and would continue to the end of Johnson's life. Early in September 1784, a few months before his own death, Johnson wrote to a mutual friend about Payne (who was then ill) remarking, &#145;poor Payne &hellip; I should count his death a great loss&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Samuel Johnson</span>, 389&#150;90).<br>
<br>Payne published Johnson's <span class="italic">Rambler</span> essays (1750&#150;52), as well as the <span class="italic">Adventurer</span> essays (1752&#150;4) edited by John Hawkesworth, another member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/71313', "Ivy Lane Club")</script>, with contributions by Johnson. Later Payne was responsible with others for starting the <span class="italic">Universal Chronicle, or, Weekly Gazette</span>. To the first number Johnson contributed a two-part essay explaining first what the paper hoped to accomplish and second the responsibilities of those who write for such publications. In the second number of 15 April 1758 appeared the first <span class="italic">Idler</span> essay, a series for which Johnson produced all but twelve of 104 essays published during the next two years. <span class="italic">The Life of Harriot Stuart</span> (1750), the first novel of Charlotte Lennox, a person whose career Johnson was eager to advance, was another publication of Payne's. Payne also published his own writings. In 1758 he wrote and published <span class="italic">New Tables of Interest</span>, with a preface by Johnson, followed by <span class="italic">A Letter Occasioned by the Lord Bishop of Gloucester's &#145;Doctrine of Grace&#146;</span> (1763), <span class="italic">The Ground and Nature of Christian Redemption</span> (1769), <span class="italic">Letter to a Modern Defender of Christianity</span> (1771), and other works on religious topics.<br>
<br>Payne had been elected to the service of the Bank of England in 1744, and he became deputy accountant in 1773 and accountant-general in 1780, before retiring on 30 June 1785. Throughout the period when he worked for the bank he maintained involvement with various aspects of the book trade: his hours at the bank allowed it and the low salary necessitated it. Payne died unmarried at Lympstone, near Exeter, on 10 March 1787, where he had probably been living since 1785. He had a brother, Henry, who was a bookseller in Pall Mall, London.<br>
<br>Payne has been confused with another <a name="cosubject_21647"></a><span class="headword">John Payne</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1762&#150;1800), <span class="occ">author and compiler</span>, who was admitted a freeman of the London Stationers' Company by redemption on 7 December 1762. He went into partnership with the bookseller Joseph Johnson about July 1768 but in early January 1770 a fire destroyed most of their business and the partnership dissolved. Payne moved to Marsham Street, Westminster, and turned author and compiler, often under assumed names, such as George Augustus Hervey and William Frederic Melmouth. Among his works are <span class="italic">The naval, commercial, and general history of Great Britain, from the earliest times to the rupture with Spain, in the year 1779</span> (1780&#150;83), <span class="italic">Universal Geography</span> (1791), <span class="italic">An Epitome of History</span> (1794), <span class="italic">Geographical Extracts</span> (1796), and <span class="italic">A Concise History of Greece</span> (1800). He was noted as being resident in King Street, Cheapside, in 1782 and in Pentonville in 1800.<br>
