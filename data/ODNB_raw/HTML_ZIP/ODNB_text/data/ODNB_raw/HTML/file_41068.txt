<span class="headword">Charles Edward, Prince</span>, second duke of Albany  (1884&#150;1954), <span class="occ">duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha</span>, was born at Claremont House, Esher, on 19 July 1884, the posthumous son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16475/', "Prince Leopold, duke of Albany (1853&#150;1884)")</script>, Queen Victoria's youngest son, and his wife, Princess Helen of Waldeck-Pyrmont (1861&#150;1922). He was given the names Leopold Charles Edward George Albert, and was known as Charles Edward. Prince Leopold suffered from haemophilia, but a haemophilic man cannot pass the condition to his son, so Charles Edward was healthy. He had one sister and was brought up by his widowed mother. He was educated at Sandroyd School, Surrey, and at Park Hill School, Lyndhurst, Hampshire, and in 1898 he went to Eton College.<br>
<br>The duchess of Albany wanted Charles Edward to follow his father to Oxford, but her plans were overruled when in 1899 her husband's elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/346/', "Alfred, duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha")</script>, lost his only son and heir. The duke of Connaught was next in line to the duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, but refused the inheritance for himself and his son, and, under intense family pressure, Charles Edward was named as heir. At fifteen years old he was uprooted from Eton, where he was happy, and taken to Coburg for his education. Finding that Duke Alfred wanted to separate her from her son, Helen took refuge with her own brother-in-law King Wilhelm of W&uuml;rttemberg and found a tutor for Charles Edward, who spoke very little German. Later the Kaiser arranged for him to go to the Leichterfelde military academy at Potsdam to study for the Prussian army. Charles Edward also attended Bonn University.<br>
<br>In July 1900 Charles Edward succeeded his uncle, and a regency was instituted under Prince Ernest of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. A conscientious young man with a taste for the arts and music, Charles Edward became popular in Coburg. He was less happy in Berlin, where his cousin, Kaiser Wilhelm II, appeared to resent him and lost no opportunity to bully him. In 1905 Charles Edward came of age, and on 11 October he married Princess Viktoria Adelheid of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl&uuml;cksburg (1885&#150;1970), whom he had loved for some time. They were happy, and had five children.<br>
<br>The duke still felt close to his old home in England. He often returned there and was on good terms with the royal family. His eldest son had Edward VII for a godfather, and his sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30757/', "Alice, countess of Athlone")</script>, married Prince Alexander of Teck, brother to Queen Mary, the consort of George V. The outbreak of the First World War found the duke in England and faced him with a painful dilemma. He told his sister he would like to fight for England, but duty demanded his return to Coburg, where people were turning against the ducal house for its English connections. A show of patriotism was imperative. A lame leg from a bobsleigh accident made active service impossible at first, but Charles Edward supported his own Coburg troops on the eastern and western fronts throughout the war and his sympathies became more German as the years passed. In Britain he was denounced as a traitor. Forced to abdicate the ducal throne of Coburg in November 1918, he was stripped of his British titles in 1919, but there was still some sympathy for him in the British establishment, where it was remembered how German nationality had been forced upon him.<br>
<br>A disappointed man, in the early 1930s Charles Edward was drawn to the Nazi party by its confident militarism, which was strongly reminiscent of imperial Germany, and by fear of communism. He attended Nazi rallies and held several appointments, becoming president of the German Red Cross in 1933 and a party member in 1935. He longed for better relations with Britain: as president of the Anglo-German Fellowship he visited England and was active in canvassing the prince of Wales and other prominent men thought to be pro-German. In this way the Nazi regime sought to make use of his connections. His enthusiastic reports to Berlin reflected hope, but not reality: he idealized memories of Eton and never understood that by the 1930s his boyhood contemporaries saw him as a foreigner.<br>
<br>The Second World War shattered Charles Edward's hopes of closer friendship between England and Nazi Germany and brought personal grief. His second son and son-in-law were killed in action and his adherence to Nazism deepened. He never acknowledged the brutality of the movement and remained unrepentant even when placed in an internment camp in 1945. He was almost crippled by arthritis and had a malignant tumour on his face: the spread of the disease to his eyes could not be halted. Too ill to face trial for his Nazi activities in person, Charles Edward was found guilty in his absence and fined by a de-Nazification court in August 1949. He lived on in complete retirement and in worsening health, and died in his flat in the Els&auml;sser Strasse in Coburg on 6 March 1954. He was temporarily interred at Schloss Callenberg beside his son on 11 March, and finally buried there on 12 October.<br>
