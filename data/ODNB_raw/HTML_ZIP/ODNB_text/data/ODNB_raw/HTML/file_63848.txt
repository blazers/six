<span class="headword">Franklin,  Hugh Arthur</span>  (1889&#150;1962), <span class="occ">women's activist</span>, was born on 27 May 1889 at 28 Pembridge Villas, Notting Hill, London, the fourth of six children of Arthur Ellis Franklin (1857&#150;1938), a senior partner in the banking firm of A. Keyser &amp; Co., and his wife, Caroline Jacob (1863&#150;1935), who was an active supporter of women's enfranchisement, eventually being elected to the executive committee of the Jewish League for Woman Suffrage. His elder sister, Alice Franklin, was an energetic feminist. Another sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61364/', "Helen Caroline Bentwich (1892&#150;1972)")</script>, spent many years in Palestine and was later prominent in the London county council. Hugh Franklin's parents were Jewish, and he was brought up in the Jewish faith.<br>
<br>Franklin was educated at Clifton College, and from 1908 at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he initially read engineering, later changing to economics and sociology. He joined the Independent Labour Party and the Fabian Society, and in 1909 he became actively involved with the women's suffrage movement, joining the Men's League for Women's Suffrage, and organizing meetings at Cambridge for the constitutional suffragists Millicent Garrett Fawcett and Lady McLaren. However, his main sympathies lay with the militants of the Women's Social and Political Union, and when in 1910 the Men's Political Union for Women's Enfranchisement was formed by Victor Duval as its male affiliate, he immediately joined it. Also, at this time Franklin abandoned Judaism and declared his intention of leaving Cambridge, although he was persuaded to stay for finals. None of this met with the approval of his father, who allegedly offered money (which was refused) to Victor Duval as an inducement to him to persuade Hugh Franklin to leave the Men's Political Union. Hugh Franklin's involvement with suffrage activity, particularly in organizing the Women's Social and Political Union procession &#145;From Prison to Citizenship&#146;, which took place on 18 June 1910, made him miss several of his finals papers, and at the end of June he went down for good from Cambridge. With some reluctance, he accepted employment as private secretary to Sir Matthew Nathan, then secretary to the Post Office and a prominent member of the Anglo-Jewish &#145;cousinhood&#146;.<br>
<br>In the &#145;black Friday&#146; suffrage demonstration of 18 November 1910 Franklin was arrested, but not charged; he was outraged by police tactics, and on 26 November 1910 he attempted to whip Winston Churchill, whom as home secretary he believed to be responsible. For this he was sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment in Pentonville, where he went on hunger strike; also, he was dismissed from Nathan's employment. On 8 March 1911 he was again arrested for trying to break Churchill's windows, again refused food, and was forcibly fed. Thereafter he travelled the country speaking on behalf of women's suffrage, particularly protesting against the treatment in prison of the male suffragist William Ball. He then set fire to an empty railway carriage at Harrow Station, and promptly went into hiding above Henderson's bookshop (popularly known as &#145;the Bomb Shop&#146; because of its supposed anarchist clientele) at 66 Charing Cross Road. He was arrested in February 1913, and sentenced to nine months' imprisonment. Again he went on hunger strike, and was forcibly fed, apparently more than 100 times, until his release on licence under the <span class="roman">Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill-Health) Act</span>, commonly called the <span class="roman">&#145;Cat and Mouse Act&#146;</span>. Like most &#145;mice&#146;, he disappeared immediately on release, adopting the alias Henry Forster, and with his fianc&eacute;e, the militant suffragette Elsie Diederichs Duval (1893?&#150;1919), sister of his Men's Political Union colleague and friend Victor Duval, he escaped first to Dresden, then to Belgium, where he remained until the outbreak of war, and the amnesty on women's suffrage offences in August 1914.<br>
<br>Hugh Franklin was disqualified for war service on the grounds of poor eyesight, and served on the staff of the ordnance factories at Woolwich. On 28 September 1915 he married Elsie Duval at the West London Synagogue. He supported anti-war movements, particularly favouring Sylvia Pankhurst. His wife, whose health had already been undermined by hunger striking and forcible feeding, died of influenza on 1 January 1919 at her father-in-law's house.<br>
<br>After the war Hugh Franklin was set up in the timber trade, at which he was ultimately unsuccessful. He appears to have married again in 1921. His second wife was Elsie Constance Tuke, known as Bunny. This marrying out of the Jewish faith may explain why Franklin's father cut him out of his will. Despite being disinherited, he does not seem to have needed to work for a living, and in 1931 he gave up business for writing. He joined the Labour Party, in whose interest he unsuccessfully contested the parliamentary seats of Hornsey in 1931 and St Albans in 1935, finally winning a seat on the Middlesex county council in 1946. He was treasurer of the National Council for Civil Liberties from 1934 to 1939. He also held office on committees of the London county council, the Metropolitan Water Board, the New Fabian Research Bureau, the Labour Party national executive council, and on boards of governors of schools and on hospital management committees. His experiences of imprisonment led him not only to join the Howard League for Penal Reform, but also to write a play (never produced) entitled &#145;On Remand&#146;.<br>
<br>Hugh Franklin in later life appeared a typical unremarkable resident of Hampstead Garden Suburb, though with an active, albeit impractical, interest in inventing. Tall, thin, with long legs, he was always tinkering with an antique motor car, and to his nephews and nieces seemed great fun. He died of heart failure at New End Hospital, Hampstead, on 21 October 1962, leaving no issue. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
