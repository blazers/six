<span class="headword">Cook <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lansley]</span>,  Beryl Frances</span>  (1926&#150;2008), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at Helmsley, Pooley Green Road, Egham, Surrey, on 10 September 1926, the third of four daughters of Adrian Stephen Barton Lansley, mechanical engineer, and his wife, Ella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Farmer-Francis, an office worker. Her parents separated four years later, and Beryl's mother moved to Reading with her four daughters. When Beryl was ten a boy called John Victor Cook moved in next door (his father, Victor Harry Cook, was a tax officer with the Inland Revenue), and was soon her childhood sweetheart. She went to Kendrick Girls' School, but excelled at nothing, including art, and left when she was fourteen to train as a typist. In 1944 the family moved to London where she took a variety of jobs including performing as a chorus girl in a production of <span class="italic">The Gypsy Princess</span> and working as a model for Goldberg's fashion showroom in Bond Street. She was attracted to the limelight but didn't make a career on the boards or catwalk. In 1947 she moved with her mother and sisters to Hampton to help run a tea room. She met up again with John Cook, who was now an officer in the merchant navy, and they married on 2 October 1948. Their son, John, was born in 1950. They lived briefly in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex and then, in 1955, took a tenancy together of the White Horse pub in Stoke by Nayland in Suffolk, in the heart of Constable country. They kept pigs and chickens but, as Beryl quipped later, &#145;it may have been healthy, but we hated the life&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 30 May 2008). A year later they moved to Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia, where Beryl worked as a bookkeeper in an insurance office, while John worked in car sales. It was there that her life suddenly switched gear.<br>
<br>Most art grows out of art&#151;the natural flowering of a childhood talent, encouraged by parents or at school, or born in an atmosphere of art. Beryl Cook's art, apparently, came out of nowhere. When they were still in Salisbury in 1960 she and John gave their ten-year-old son a child's oil painting set. He painted a typical child's picture with a strip of sky at the top and a band of grass at the bottom with a little house standing on it. Beryl commented that there was nothing in the middle. Young John replied, reasonably enough, that there <i>was</i> nothing in the middle. &#145;I'll paint you a picture with something in the middle&#146;, Beryl replied, and she painted two large, naked breasts with a woman's face above them with big eyes glancing furiously right, as if to say &#145;what are you looking at?&#146;. She had no idea how to paint a waist, so she painted in a broad black band, as if the woman were leaning over a shellacked fence. Her husband immediately dubbed it &#145;The Hangover&#146;, and this bright gem of a painting hung in her house ever after. She later said that she felt as if she had been kicked in the stomach when she saw what she had done. She had no idea where it came from, and had at first no idea what to do with the creative power she had found within herself  (personal knowledge).<br>
<br>It not until about five years later, when she and her family had moved back to live in East Looe in Cornwall, that Beryl Cook began to see scenes around her, particularly in their local pub, which she thought she would like to paint. There are hints of Stanley Spencer and Edward Burra as well as Picasso, Manet, and Matisse in her very early attempts, but what is remarkable is how rapidly she developed her instantly recognizable style; she soon became famous for her &#145;fat ladies&#146;. But it is not only the ladies in her paintings that are fat: everything is fat, the cigarettes and wine glasses, the shoes (she loved painting shoes), the fur coats, the ice creams and Cornish pasties, the hairdos, and the dustbins. She never painted nails on her fingers, not because she couldn't but because such finicky details would have distracted from their fullness. The only details on her ballooned features were the lines of mouths and the angles of glances. These were crucial and take one to the heart of the start of each picture. They spring from direct observations of unguarded moments when someone reveals their true feelings, relaxes with a fag, dances with joy, or surreptitiously eyes up a sailor, moments that make us, the viewers, smile, and sometimes laugh out loud, as we recognize these feelings in ourselves.<br>
<br>In 1968 the Cooks bought a bed and breakfast in Plymouth, and soon the walls were covered with her paintings. If guests commented on them she pretended that they were by her son, or husband. But in 1975 Bernard Samuels, the director of the Plymouth Art Centre, heard about this boarding house full of paintings, and went to see it. He immediately offered Beryl Cook an exhibition. The show drew crowds, many sales, priced between &pound;40 and &pound;60, and attention from local and then national media. In 1976 her painting of the knowingly smiling barmaid of their local pub, the Lockyer Tavern, starred on the cover of the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> colour magazine. The London art dealer Lionel Levy saw it and invited her to show in his Portal Gallery. She subsequently held eighteen hugely successful exhibitions there. Her paintings began to be reproduced as greetings cards which were sold around the world. The first of eleven books of her art, <span class="italic">Beryl Cook: the Works</span>, was published by John Murray in 1978, and in the following year Melvyn Bragg featured her on his <span class="italic">South Bank Show</span> on ITV.<br>
<br>As she became more and more successful Beryl Cook's horizons widened. She travelled to New York, flying out on Concorde and sailing back on the <i>QE2</i>, searched out tango dancers in Buenos Aires, and followed in the footsteps of the painter Edward Burra in Marseilles, all the while making tiny sketches in her handbag, occasionally pretending to snap John so that she could photograph a background detail. She became Britain's most genuinely popular living painter in the 1980s.<br>
<br>Cook's popularity to a large extent excluded her from the established contemporary art world that lauded avant-garde work that offended public taste. A few critics liked her work, such as Edward Lucie-Smith, but curators were much derided when they bought her work for public collections. Modern art was supposed to be angst-ridden, the critics claimed, so Beryl Cook's paintings couldn't be modern or, as one eminent gallery director once announced, even art. They are, and gloriously so, each image a memorable insight into contemporary life. The warmth in them is palpable. Cook said, &#145;I can see things that horrify me and upset me, but I don't want to paint them. If I thought that by painting something very meaningful it would change things then perhaps I would want to, I don't know. But I don't believe that. Instead I think people are getting dulled by the amount of horror. I only paint when I'm excited by something, and what excites me is the joy, the animation, the pleasure in life&#146;  (press cutting, 1985, Beryl Cook archive). She was appointed OBE in 1996. Typically she couldn't face going to Buckingham Palace to receive it. She died of cancer, painting almost until the last, in Plymouth, on 28 May 2008. She was survived by her husband and their son.<br>
