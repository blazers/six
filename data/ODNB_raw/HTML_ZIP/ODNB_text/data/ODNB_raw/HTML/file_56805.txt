<span class="headword">Walter,  Arthur Fraser</span>  (1846&#150;1910), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor</span>, was born on 12 September 1846 at Waterloo House, near Wokingham, Berkshire, the second of the two sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28638/', "John Walter (1818&#150;1894)")</script>, grandson of the founder of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and of his first wife, Emily Frances (<i>d</i>. 1858), eldest daughter of Henry Court of Castlemans, Berkshire. It was Arthur Walter's misfortune to be head of the family at the moment when circumstances forced the sale of the paper. It was in a different sense a personal misfortune. His elder brother, John, groomed for a dynastic role as John Walter the fourth, was drowned on Christmas eve 1870, while rescuing one of his half-brothers and a cousin from the frozen lake at the family home, Bear Wood in Newland, Berkshire. Arthur thus found himself thrust into a position for which he was prepared neither by upbringing nor by temperament.<br>
<br>At Eton College, Arthur Walter, though less sociable than his elder brother, was a painstaking scholar and an excellent games player. He completed his education at Christ Church, Oxford, where he took a first in classical moderations and a third in finals. The latter may have been due to the competing appeal of cricket, which he played for the university against Cambridge. He made no great mark in his college, except that he was active in a campaign against poor college food, which became known as &#145;the bread-and-butter row&#146; and attracted (not surprisingly, the campaign's opponents remarked) the friendly support of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Shortly after graduating Walter started helping his father with the paper. He also entered Lincoln's Inn and was called to the bar in 1875, but he never practised. On 15 October 1872 he married Henrietta Maria (<i>b</i>. 1846/7), eldest daughter of the Revd Thomas Anchitel Anson, of Longford rectory, Derbyshire. They had two sons and two daughters. In 1885 his father, by now sixty-seven, made him joint manager of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and in 1894, on his father's death, he became chief proprietor. He conducted the paper along its traditional gentlemanly and politically independent lines. He did not seek to impose his views on the editor, G. E. Buckle, with whom he got on well and who was in the chair throughout his proprietorship. The printing side was left entirely to his younger half-brother Godfrey. None of this took him away from Bear Wood for more than three or four days a week.<br>
<br>This apparently stable regime was deceptive. The structure of <span class="italic">The Times</span> had grown cumbersome. Two-thirds of the buildings and printing business now belonged to Arthur Walter, and one-third to Godfrey. The printing business had a longstanding contract with the paper (which had been founded to provide it with work). <span class="italic">The Times</span> itself was owned as a co-partnership, in which the shares, divided into sixteenths, were often subdivided. Arthur Walter owned two sixteenths. There were about 100 other partners. These arrangements sufficed, so long as the paper made a profit. If it did not, the partners would be bound to object, since their liabilities at law were unlimited. This was precisely the problem developing at about the time of Arthur Walter's succession. His single most important action in response, and arguably the most important decision of his career, was the appointment in 1890 of C. F. Moberly Bell as his assistant manager. The choice was all the more remarkable because Bell had spent most of his working life in business in Egypt, where latterly he was the <span class="italic">Times</span> correspondent, and Walter did not know him well. The appointment had profound consequences. Bell's formidable personality and absorption in the job enabled him to dominate his nominal superior and, eventually, to defeat the Walters' own plans for <span class="italic">The Times</span> and to sell it to Alfred Harmsworth. Bell found a paper with steadily declining circulation and advertising, archaic design, and outdated printing services for which it was overcharged. He sought relief in such money-making initiatives as a reprint of the ninth edition of <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> and the Times Book Club. At length legal action by some of the partners led to a dissolution of the partnership, and in July 1907 <span class="italic">The Times</span> went up for sale. Arthur Walter, on Godfrey's initiative, sought a limited liability company in which the main injection of capital would come from the newspaper entrepreneur C. Arthur Pearson. Neither Bell nor Buckle was privy to this scheme. When it was disclosed precipitately after a mischievous paragraph in Harmsworth's <span class="italic">Observer</span>, Bell immediately determined to defeat it. Pearson, who founded the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, was known as a &#145;hustler&#146;. Harmsworth too ran papers that were the antithesis of <span class="italic">The Times</span> in looks and content. But his record was stronger and he was prepared to give Bell assurances about maintaining the paper's character and independence. Arthur Walter abandoned Pearson and threw in his lot with Bell. During the negotiations Harmsworth's identity remained secret&#151;even from Walter and his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36718/', "John Walter (1873&#150;1968)")</script>, who joined the business in 1898. Walter's influence helped to bring round the partners and nullify alternative schemes. In March 1908 the court approved the sale, chiefly to Harmsworth nominees, of whom Bell was the principal. Arthur Walter was the second largest single shareholder and became chairman of the new Times Publishing Company Limited. Had he worked with Bell from the beginning, the problems of the old structure might well have been resolved without the Walter proprietorship coming to an end.<br>
<br>Quite apart from the traditions of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, which meant that the proprietor, though instantly deferred to, was never obtrusive, Arthur Walter was by nature reserved and aloof, and he lacked imagination. A portrait by H. Riviere shows him in middle age, balding and with flowing moustaches typical of his generation. His education completely failed to equip him for business in a rapidly changing newspaper world. The Bear Wood estate, amounting to 7000 acres, always engaged his interest&#151;for instance in landscape gardening. Locally he was known as a country gentleman whom private affairs frequently called to London. He served as a county councillor, a railway company director, and a Territorial Army colonel. Arthur Walter died at Bear Wood on 22 February 1910 after an attack of influenza.<br>
