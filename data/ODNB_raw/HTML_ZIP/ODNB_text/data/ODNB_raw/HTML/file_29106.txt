</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Westall,  Richard</span>  (1765&#150;1836), <span class="occ">painter and illustrator</span>, was born on 2 January 1765 at Reepham, Norfolk, the eldest son of Benjamin Westall (1736&#150;1794), a brewer, and his first wife, Mary (1739&#150;1770), the daughter of John Ayton of London. He was baptized at All Saints', Norwich, where his father was a churchwarden, on 13 January 1765. The <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> suggested that he was born in Hertford: this error is of some significance, as he was never regarded as a Norwich artist, although one of the Cromes (probably John) purchased his pictures and the Norwich artist, John Thirtle exhibited <span class="italic">Venus and Cupid (after Westall)</span> in 1805. However, the Westalls were an established Norfolk family. The family residence of Kerdistone Manor has been traditionally linked to the Chaucer family, and a connection with Geoffrey Chaucer's grandmother Mary de Westhale&#151;who is believed to have been the model for the Wife of Bath&#151;is possible.<br>
<br>The death of Richard's mother in 1770 left Benjamin Westall with four young children, the youngest of whom was blind; at about the same time his brewery failed and he was made bankrupt. Westall later referred to these difficult times in his poem <span class="italic">A Day in Spring</span> (1808), describing how a relation of his mother, William Ayton, provided assistance:<blockquote>
<div>Thou, the parent of my fame,<br>
</div>
<div>Thou, whose warmth preserved the flame,<br>
</div>
<div>Which was dying in my breast,<br>
</div>
<div>By cold penury opprest.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Benjamin Westall soon married again, and, with his second wife, Martha Harbord, went to manage a brewery in Hertford: here Richard's younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29107/', "William Westall (1781&#150;1850)")</script>, also an artist, was born on 12 October 1781.<br>
<br>After being placed with an attorney in Norfolk, Westall moved to London, where in 1779 he became apprenticed to John Thompson, a heraldic engraver on silver; he also studied at an evening school run by Thomas Simpson. The Norfolk artist John Alefounder instructed him in the execution of miniatures and advised the young man to become a painter. Accordingly, in 1784 Westall exhibited the first of 384 pictures at the Royal Academy. He was admitted as a student of the Academy Schools in the following year, when he exhibited an illustration of Chaucer's <span class="italic">Wife of Bath's Tale</span>, became an associate of the academy in 1792, and was made a full academician in 1794&#151;the same year as his close friend Thomas Lawrence, with whose family he lived between 1790 and 1794.<br>
<br>Westall &#145;soon attracted attention by his large and highly finished drawings in watercolour&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), including the noteworthy <span class="italic">Mary Queen of Scots on her Way to Execution</span> (exh. RA, 1787). Horace Walpole described the figure of Sappho in <span class="italic">Sappho Chanting the Hymn of Love</span> (exh. RA, 1796) as &#145;beautiful beyond description&#146; and his <span class="italic">Hesiod Instructing the Greeks</span> (exh. RA, 1796) as &#145;by far one of the finest compositions ever painted in England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 15.404). Joseph Farington recorded in his diary that &#145;the King particularly dwelt on Westall's drawings and said he had never seen anything equal to them&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 2.527). However, Westall had his critics. John Williams, who wrote under the pseudonym Anthony Pasquin, remarked of the <span class="italic">Hesiod</span> picture, &#145;This is such an effort, as no person, possessing taste and knowledge, can regard with satisfaction; yet it involves that trickery and finery which is so captivating to vulgar minds&#146;  (A. Pasquin, <span class="italic">A Critical Guide to the Royal Academy</span>, 1796, 24). Some years later William Hazlitt exclaimed to James Northcote: &#145;I confess I never liked Westall. It was one of the errors of my youth that I did not think him equal to Raphael and Rubens united, as Payne Knight contended&#146;  (W. Hazlitt, <span class="italic">The Round Table</span>, 1908, 382). A further comment from Pasquin, in his critique of the 1794 exhibition, provides stimulus to thought: &#145;He [Westall] has been precipitated to the command of the fleet, before he well knows the principles of navigation&#146;  (A. Pasquin, <span class="italic">A Liberal Critique on the Present Exhibition of the Royal Academy</span>, 1794, 25). Richard Payne Knight was Westall's most liberal patron and sympathetic critic. In his <span class="italic">Analytical Enquiry into the Principles of Taste</span> (1805), he singled out Westall's <span class="italic">Storm in Harvest</span> (1796) as one of the &#145;most interesting and affecting pictures that art has ever produced&#146;  (p. 304). Indeed, he purchased the picture, along with another, <span class="italic">The Grecian Marriage</span>, in which he discerned &#145;the utmost purity and dignity of heroic character and composition embellished and not impaired by the most rich and splendid harmony of colouring&#146;  (<span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, 23, 1814, 287).<br>
<br>In the 1790s Westall was a contributor to Boydell's Shakspeare Gallery and to Fuseli's <span class="roman">Milton Gallery</span>. He went on to illustrate several editions of Sir Walter Scott's novels, the works of Byron (of whom he also painted several portraits, one of which is held by the National Portrait Gallery, London), William Cowper, James Thomson, Robert Burns, George Crabbe, and many leading authors and poets. Byron provided a generous accolade by remarking that Westall's illustrations for <span class="italic">Don Juan</span> &#145;are quite beautiful&#151;the drawings are superb&#151;the brush has beat the poetry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Byron's Letters and Journals</span>, ed L. A. Marchand, 1973&#150;82, 7.165, 168). Westall's naval associations were evident from several oils depicting the life of Nelson, shown at the Royal Academy in 1807 and now in the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich. He also negotiated with the Admiralty, through Sir Joseph Banks, over his brother's pictures of Australia.<br>
<br>Westall's career reached its height in 1814, when he staged his own exhibition in Pall Mall of 312 pictures, 240 &#145;never before exhibited&#146;. The names of the proprietors of his paintings and illustrations (listed in the exhibition catalogue) reflect the high contemporary standing of Westall's art. As well as Knight, they included Thomas Hope, the earls of Oxford, Carlisle, and Harrowby, Byron, Samuel Rogers, the prince regent, Isaac D'Israeli, and Westall's brother-in-law and fellow artist William Daniell. Publishers, naturally, were prominent among those who owned his illustrations. The exhibition met with enthusiastic reviews. The critic in the <span class="italic">Repository of Arts</span> commented:<blockquote>That honour which Great Britain has derived from the discovery of the art of painting in transparent water colours, and which most enlightened foreigners have so willingly accorded to us, is in great degree to be ascribed to Mr Westall. His drawings for many years formed the principal feature of attraction at the exhibitions of the Royal Academy. (<span class="italic">Repository of Arts</span>, 1814, 357&#150;8)</blockquote>The critic of the <span class="italic">New Monthly</span> reviewed the exhibition over two issues and remarked that <span class="italic">Dionysius and Damocles</span>, owned by Hope, was &#145;one of the most splendid, tasteful and elegant cabinet pictures of any modern master&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Monthly</span>, 1814, 141&#150;2, 248&#150;9). Another painting which attracted interest was <span class="italic">Elijah Raising the Widow's Son</span>, exhibited at the British Institution in 1813 and then purchased by that body for 450 guineas. <span class="italic">The Times</span> of 5 February 1813 extravagantly compared it to the works of Titian and Rembrandt. This painting was presented to Egham parish church (St John the Baptist) in 1834 but was badly damaged by fire in 1950. The head of Elijah, however, is still visible. John Nash's only surviving London church, All Souls, Langham Place, has an altarpiece by Westall of <span class="italic">Christ Crowned with Thorns</span>, presented to that church by George IV at its opening in 1824.<br>
<br>From about 1815 onwards Westall's reputation slowly declined. In addition, he broke his right arm after falling from a horse and the injury took two years to mend. Almost bankrupt, he considered leaving for France. Perhaps the most interesting exhibited paintings of his later years were from Goethe's <span class="italic">Faust</span>. His <span class="italic">Faust and Lilith, the Young Witch</span> (exh. RA, 1831) bears comparison with Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix's 1828 lithograph of the same subject. In this instance, it appears that Westall may have been inspired by the French artist's illustration, but Delacroix profited by Westall's works in turn. His painting of <span class="italic">Gulnare rend visite &agrave; Conrad en prison</span> (1822/3) drew on the composition of Westall's drawing of this scene from Byron, engraved by Charles Heath. This was not the only instance of Westall's illustrations influencing the work of foreign artists. Engravings of his works were widely available abroad, particularly in France, and won him an international reputation that outlasted his celebrity at home. William Etty, after a visit to France in the 1820s, mentioned Westall as among those whose work is &#145;not only admired but imitated&#146;  (D. Farr, <span class="italic">William Etty</span>, 1958, 44, 120). Recent research has shown that the French lithographer Camille Rocqueplan made use of Westall's illustrations of Scott, while G&eacute;ricault drew on his Byron illustrations, and his <span class="italic">Faust</span> paintings have been found to have influenced the German artist Theodore Matthias von Holst. Westall was also a major inspiration for the American artist Edward Hicks.<br>
<br>Westall remained a bachelor but was apparently once engaged to a Miss Bennett, the sister of his pupil William James Bennett; he painted a portrait of his intended bride for the 1804 exhibition at the Royal Academy. He died on 4 December 1836 at his home, 4 Russell Place, Fitzroy Square, London. For the last nine years of his life he had been drawing master to Princess Victoria; he visited her twice a week and painted a charming portrait of her (Royal Collection), which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1830. Echoing his own poem, the princess sorrowfully recorded that the once popular painter had died &#145;by cold penury opprest&#146;.<br>
<br>Also saddened by Westall's death was John Constable, who attended his funeral. The link between the two men was not an artistic one. As a representative of another generation of painters, Constable had been critical of &#145;the School of Westall&#146;; C. R. Leslie, Constable's biographer, no doubt echoed the opinion of his subject when he wrote in 1812 that &#145;His [Westall's] faults seem to arise from a wish to improve upon nature&#146;  (C. R. Leslie, <span class="italic">Autobiographical Recollections</span>, ed. T. Taylor, 1860, 18&#150;20). Westall had clearly belonged to the neo-classical, romantic, and historical schools of the late eighteenth century, and his reputation declined quickly in the robust atmosphere of the early nineteenth century. Nevertheless, he was a significant and innovative figure in the development of the English watercolour, his elegant and precise book illustrations set new standards in that field, and his portraits and historical and religious paintings have deservedly received more scholarly attention recently than hitherto. He was a leading artist for some twenty years, and fruitful comparisons of his works with those of other better-known contemporaries can and have been made: his portraits have been considered alongside those of Thomas Lawrence, while his more sentimental pieces resemble the pastorals of Francis Wheatley and his illustrations to Milton stand comparison with the works of Henry Fuseli. Examples of Westall's work, including <span class="italic">Milton and his Daughters</span>, are in Sir John Soane's Museum, London.<br>
