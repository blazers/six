<span class="headword">Nutt,  Alfred Tr&uuml;bner</span>  (1856&#150;1910), <span class="occ">publisher and Celtic scholar</span>, was born in London on 22 November 1856, the eldest and only surviving son of David Nutt (<i>d</i>. 1863), a foreign bookseller and publisher, and his wife, Ellen, daughter of Robert Carter and granddaughter of William Miller, publisher, of Albemarle Street, London, predecessor of John (II) Murray. His second name commemorated his father's partnership with Nicholas Tr&uuml;bner. He was educated first at University College School, London, and afterwards at Coll&egrave;ge de Vitry-le-Fran&ccedil;ois in the Marne d&eacute;partement, France, until 1873. Having served three years' business apprenticeship in Leipzig, Berlin, and Paris, in 1878 he took his place as head of his father's firm which, founded in 1829 at 58 Fleet Street, London, was moved in 1848 to 270&#150;271 Strand. The business, which had been mainly confined to foreign bookselling, soon benefited by young Nutt's energy and enterprise, especially in the publishing department, which he mainly devoted to folklore and antiquities. Among his chief publications were the collection of unedited Scottish Gaelic texts known as <span class="italic">Waifs and Strays of Celtic Tradition</span>, the <span class="roman">Northern Library</span> of Old Norse texts, the <span class="roman">Tudor Library</span> of rare sixteenth-century works, the Tudor translations (in sixteenth-century prose), the <span class="roman">Grimm Library</span>, the <span class="roman">Biblioth&egrave;que de Carabas</span>, a critical edition of <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> in Spanish, <span class="roman">Nutt's Juvenile Library</span>, the works of W. E. Henley, and the collection of English, Celtic, and Indian fairy tales. He also produced a number of excellent school books. The business was carried on in London at 57&#150;59 Long Acre, &#145;At the sign of the Phoenix&#146;, from 1890 to 1912, when it was removed to Grape Street, New Oxford Street.<br>
<br>Nutt was not only an astute businessman, but was also a lifelong student of folklore and of the Celtic languages, and displayed scholarship and power of original research in both fields. His name was &#145;definitely associated with the plea for the insular, Celtic, and popular <i>provenance</i> of the Arthurian cycle&#146;  (<span class="italic">Folk-Lore</span>, 513). Nutt founded the <span class="italic">Folk-Lore Journal</span> (afterwards <span class="italic">Folk-Lore</span>), was one of the earliest members of the Folk-Lore Society (1879), and was elected president in 1897 and 1898. Besides presidential addresses he contributed many valuable articles to the society's journal, the <span class="italic">Folk-Lore Record</span>, and in 1892 he edited a volume of <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the International Folk-Lore Congress (1891). In 1886 he helped to establish the English Goethe Society and he was one of the founders of the movement which led in 1898 to the formation of the Irish Texts Society. His most important literary productions included &#145;Studies on the legend of the holy grail, with special reference to the hypothesis of its Celtic origin&#146;  (<span class="italic">Folk-Lore Record</span>, 23, 1888), and two essays on the Irish vision of the afterlife and the Celtic doctrine of rebirth, appended to <span class="italic">The Voyage of Bran, Son of Febal, to the Land of the Living</span>  (<span class="roman">Grimm Library</span>, vols. 4 and 6, 1895&#150;7). He also wrote numerous studies of the <span class="italic">Mabinogion</span>, the holy grail and of Celtic and Gaelic literature, and produced an annotated edition of Matthew Arnold's <span class="italic">Study of Celtic Literature</span> (1910).<br>
<br>On 21 May 1910, while on holiday at Melun on the Seine, Nutt drowned trying to save his invalid son, who had fallen into the river. His wife, Mrs M. L. Nutt, who had been his secretary for several years, succeeded him as head of the firm. Two sons survived him.<br>
