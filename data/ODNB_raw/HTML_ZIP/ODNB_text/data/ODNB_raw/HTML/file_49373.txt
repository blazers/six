<span class="headword">Florence (V)</span>, count of Holland  (1254&#150;1296), <span class="occ">claimant to the Scottish throne</span>, was born at Leiden in 1254, perhaps in July, the son of William (II), count of Holland and king of the Romans (1227&#150;1256), and Elisabeth of Brunswick (1228&#150;1266), and grew up in an atmosphere of intrigues under changing regentships and during the early years after his coming of age in 1266. In 1268 or 1269 he married B&eacute;atrice de Dampierre (1253/4&#150;1296), daughter of Gui, count of Flanders (<i>d</i>. 1305), with whom he probably had nine children, of whom seven died in infancy. He also fathered at least seven bastards. At the start of his reign Florence was in free and undisputed possession of only a relatively small part of his territory and he considered it his main task to remedy this situation. In 1283 the southern part of Holland was freed from its feudal ties with Brabant. After a disastrous campaign against the rebellious West Frisians in 1272, a more successful one in 1282 formed the beginning of the subjection of the north of his territory, completed in 1289. And from 1278 onwards, by a shrewd but unscrupulous policy, the count managed to gain considerable power over the adjacent prince-bishopric of Utrecht and to extend his own territory at the bishop's expense. But Florence's authority over the Zeeland Islands, where an unruly nobility stood in his way, remained uncertain, and in 1290, after a short war, he was forced to recognize the suzerainty of the count of Flanders over the isles.<br>
<br>From about 1280 Edward I of England acted as a mediator in several of Florence's conflicts with his neighbours. The king's interest in the strategically important county of Holland, as well as his influence on Florence, are apparent from two contracts concluded in 1281 and 1285, arranging the marriage of the count's daughter with the king's son Alphonso (<i>d</i>. 1284), and of Florence's son and heir, John (Jan), born in 1284, with Edward's daughter Elizabeth respectively. In 1291, after the death of Margaret, the Maid of Norway, the count was among the principal claimants to the Scottish throne [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93692', "Competitors for the throne of Scotland")</script>]. He asserted that his great-great-great-grandmother Ada, a sister of King William the Lion, had been recognized as heir to the throne after her other brother, David, earl of Huntingdon (<i>d</i>. 1219), from whom the other main contenders were descended, had either relinquished his own claim in return for the lordship of Garioch, or lost it through forfeiture as a felon. Court proceedings were delayed to allow Florence time to produce the relevant documents, but though it is certain that in 1291 a (forged) relinquishment by Earl David existed in Scotland, Florence never produced it, but withdrew his claim at the last moment in 1292. It is unclear who or what influenced his actions, but it may be significant that in June 1292 he struck a deal with Robert (V) de Brus (<i>d</i>. 1295), another claimant, for their mutual advantage should either of them succeed to the Scottish throne, and that in 1290 and 1291 he had received large sums under the treaty of 1285 from Edward I, with whom he had come to Norham for the opening of the Great Cause in May 1291.<br>
<br>Florence's relationship with Edward I remained unchanged for the time being, and in 1294 he acted as the king's main negotiator over a treaty with the king of the Romans. In 1295, however, while Edward was building up a coalition against France which included the count of Flanders, Florence entered upon a new war with that county. Edward reacted with measures damaging to the economic interests of Holland, and Florence then concluded a treaty with the king of France (January 1296). A conspiracy of nobles from his own county, aimed at kidnapping the count and delivering him into the hands of the English king, miscarried disastrously and ended in Florence's murder near Muiden Castle (east of Amsterdam) in June 1296; he was buried at Rijnsburg Abbey.<br>
