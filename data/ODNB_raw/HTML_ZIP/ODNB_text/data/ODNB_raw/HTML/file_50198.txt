<span class="headword">Burton,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1437), <span class="occ">chronicler and abbot of Meaux</span>, was the author of the most authoritative Cistercian chronicle to be written in late medieval England. The place of his birth, and the details of his early life are unknown. Although the continuator of his chronicle described him as &#145;well educated&#146;, there is no evidence that he studied at a university. Late in the fourteenth century he became a monk at Meaux, Yorkshire, where his name first appears in two lists of members of the abbey in 1394 and 1396. In the first list he is described as &#145;bursar and sergeant of the abbey&#146;. In the second list no office appears after his name, but in 1396 Burton was elected abbot in a disputed election which was referred to the papal curia. As abbot of Meaux he attended the general chapter of the Cistercian order in Vienna in 1397. None the less, despite a papal judgment in his favour Burton resigned his position as abbot in 1399. According to the evidence of an incised slab now in Wawne church, Yorkshire, he died on 4 October 1437 at what must have been an advanced age, having lost his sight during the final years of his life. He was buried in Meaux Abbey.<br>
<br>Burton's chronicle survives in two manuscripts which contain an early and a revised version of his text respectively. He appears to have begun his work <i>c</i>.1388, and to have completed the first version of his chronicle by 1396. He then revised his text, probably between 1397 and 1402. The Meaux chronicle, which is built around the history of Meaux, is divided into sections dealing with the tenure of each abbot. It possesses the unique feature that each section is further divided into local and general history, and each of these subsections further subdivided to deal with particular aspects of their subject matter. Burton also included in his chronicle a list of abbots of Meaux, of chapter-headings, and a table denoting the properties of each abbot. A continuation to his chronicle which was written during the time of Abbot John Horton (1445) is found in the revised version only. This continuation omits the sections on general history.<br>
<br>Although certain of his sources appear to be lost, Burton took his account of general history mainly from a number of well-known chronicles. Many of these were of northern origin, and would have been readily available in the Meaux Library, whose catalogue survives as part of Burton's collectanea. The sections on general history contain useful information, but the most valuable parts of his work are undoubtedly those that deal with the history of Meaux. In these parts of his chronicle Burton provided an exceptionally detailed account of a Cistercian community, describing such matters as the numbers of monks, the state of religious observance, dissensions in the monastery, particularly during the time of Abbot William Scarborough (1372&#150;96), and, most importantly, an account of the abbey's properties and finances. As a former bursar Burton possessed an expert knowledge of the finances of the house, and it was this knowledge that gives his work its unique value.<br>
<br>Because he could draw on his own practical experience, Burton's description of the community at Meaux constitutes the best extant account of the domestic history of a Cistercian monastery during the later middle ages. His work is also of some interest because of his skilled use of charter evidence, and his antiquarian outlook. Burton based his account upon a thorough examination of the records of the house, and his critical examination of these documents marks him out as a historical writer of unusual ability. Not surprisingly, he included a register of documentary material relevant to Meaux in the revised version of his chronicle. He was also interested in the topographical changes in the area around Meaux, and in the history of the abbey's buildings. Altogether his work, which stands at the end of a long tradition of Cistercian writing in the north, shows how effectively the history of a corporate body could be written by an individual with an enduring interest in its past.<br>
