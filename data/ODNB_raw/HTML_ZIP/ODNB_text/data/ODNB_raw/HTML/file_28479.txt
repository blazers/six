<span class="headword">Walker,  George</span>  (1645/6&#150;1690), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland clergyman</span>, was the son of the Revd George Walker (<i>c</i>.1600&#150;1677) and Ursula (<i>d</i>. 1654), the daughter of Sir John Stanhope of Melwood, Yorkshire. His parents settled in Ireland but fled following the 1641 rising. Although Walker is generally supposed to have been born and brought up in Yorkshire, he claimed to have an &#145;affection to the Scottish nation where he had his education&#146;  (Walker, <span class="italic">Vindication</span>, preface, 3). The family returned to Ireland after the Restoration and Walker matriculated at Dublin University in 1662 and took holy orders. He married, about 1668, Isabella Barclay (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1650), with whom he had five sons and three daughters. In 1674 he was appointed rector of Donoghmore, co. Tyrone, which had been devastated during the civil war. He built a rectory there in 1683 and a mill in the village in 1684.<h2>
<a name="ThesiegeofLondonderry"></a>The siege of Londonderry</h2>In early 1689, when Ireland was again on the brink of war, Walker rallied the protestants in the area and raised men to garrison Dungannon. Orders to abandon the town were received on 14 March from Colonel Robert Lundy, who planned to consolidate the forces under his command. When King James's army marched on Londonderry, Walker commanded five companies in St Johnstown. On 13 April he rode to Lundy to alert him to the danger, and was present that night at Clady when the Irish advance was temporarily checked. On the following morning he was posted with his troops to Long Causey, north of Lifford, but once the Irish army crossed the Finn he was forced to abandon his position and fall back on Londonderry. Walker arrived at night to find the gates shut, and he and his men were obliged to sleep outside the walls. He gained entry the next day only after the sentry had been threatened.<br>
<br>Lundy's decision to treat with the enemy once King James arrived outside the city provoked a mutiny. Lundy refused to continue as governor and on 19 April, after a hurried election, Henry Baker succeeded him and nominated Walker as a joint governor, a choice that was ratified by the electorate. Both Walker and Baker begged Lundy to remain, but without success, and Walker arranged Lundy's escape from the city the following evening. The division of responsibilities between the new governors was such that Walker took charge of the civil administration of the city and all the provisioning, while Baker looked after military affairs. Walker was also elected colonel of one of the regiments in the city and took an active part in its defence throughout the ensuing three months. He proved to be an inspirational leader. John Michelburne, never quick to praise others, wrote of Walker that: &#145;Truly much Praise was due to him for having been so great an Animator of the Protestant Cause in those worst of Times&#146;  (Michelburne, <span class="italic">An Account</span>, x). When Baker died on 30 June, Michelburne succeeded him to become joint governor with Walker.<br>
<br>After the Irish failed to storm the defences on 4 June, the siege developed into a blockade. Provisions in the city ran low and the garrison was reduced to eating horseflesh, cats, mice, seaweed, and dogs &#145;fattened by eating the bodies of the slain Irish&#146;  (Walker, <span class="italic">True Account</span>, 39). The desperate circumstances of the city prompted occasional outbreaks of rioting fuelled by wild rumours that Walker was either embezzling the stores or treating with the enemy. A later cause of discontent in some quarters was the suggestion that Walker's intransigence was preventing an honourable capitulation. In early June, he was forced to take refuge in Baker's house while a violent mob searched for him outside, and later that month a group of officers signed a petition to have him removed. Nevertheless, the complaints against Walker were rejected by the overwhelming majority of the garrison as, after the city was finally relieved on 28th July, he and Michelburne welcomed General Percy Kirke into the city on behalf of the inhabitants and led the celebrations.<h2>
<a name="Celebrity"></a>Celebrity</h2>After handing over the command of his regiment, Walker was entrusted with a loyal address to King William signed by 145 officers, clergymen, &#145;and other gentlemen&#146; of Londonderry. On 9 August he set sail for Scotland and began a triumphant progress to London. He was made a burgess and guild-brother of the city of Glasgow on 13 August. He received the same honours in Edinburgh on the next day, and on his journey south he was mobbed and dined in Chester on 22 August.<br>
<br>Walker's reputation in London had been made not only by the newsletters but by the publication of a speech and two sermons supposedly given by him during the siege. He was met at Barnet by a coach belonging to Sir Robert Cotton, the MP for Chester, and was brought discreetly into the city. Nevertheless, &#145;The prime citizens treated him with all the demonstrations of joy and gratitude; and the vulgar even stifled him with gazing, crowding and acclamations&#146;  (Macrory, 325). A week after his arrival, he was taken to Hampton Court to be presented to the king. William drank to his health, gave him &pound;5000, commissioned Kneller to paint his portrait, and promised him the bishopric of Derry when it fell vacant. Walker was banqueted by the Irish Society, the sheriffs of London, and the lord mayor, and was made a doctor of divinity by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.<br>
<br>In November 1689 Walker presented a petition to the House of Commons on behalf of the 2000 widows and orphans in Londonderry, and was invited to the bar of the house to be told by the speaker that &pound;10,000 had been voted for the relief of the sufferers and that note had been taken of the &#145;extraordinary service you have done to their Majesties and to England and Ireland&#146;.<br>
<br>Walker's self-effacing manner was much admired. He told the House of Commons: &#145;As for the service I have done, it is very little, and does not deserve this favour you have done me&#146;  (Hempton, 403). The <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> noted that &#145;The applauses of the People as he passes are very troublesome to him, for his modesty is as great, and as deservedly admired, as his courage and Conduct&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, no. 2484). Narcissus Luttrell described Walker as &#145;a very modest person&#146;  (Luttrell, 555), and John Tillotson, yet to become archbishop of Canterbury, wrote approvingly of &#145;Walker, whose modesty is equal to his merit&#146;  (Milligan, 360).<br>
<br>Bishop Burnet saw Walker as being &#145;but a man of ordinary parts, but they were well suited to this work, for he did wonders in this siege&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 63057B, fol. 278). The caricature of Walker in King James's <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> (p. 334) as a &#145;fierce Minister of the gospel, being of the true Cromwelian or Cameronian stamp&#146; is quite false, especially as Walker described himself as &#145;a true son of the Church of England&#146;  (Walker, <span class="italic">Vindication</span>, 13).<h2>
<a name="Pamphletwars"></a>Pamphlet wars</h2>Walker took lodgings in Fetter Lane, London, where he hurriedly wrote his <span class="italic">True Account of the Siege of London-Derry</span>. Although this proved a popular and vivid description of the siege, it drew immediate criticism, especially from Presbyterians, and sparked off a pamphlet war. In an attempt to placate his critics, Walker published later in the year <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Account of the Siege of Derry</span>. Sensitive to the suggestion that as a clergyman he should not have taken up arms, he pleaded that<blockquote>his Case has all the authority that the greatest necessity in the World can give to any Action&#151;the lives of thousands, besides his own, were at stake; his Religion, that is dearer than all, and the <i>English</i> and <i>Scotch</i> equally dear to him, next door to an utter Extirpation out of Ireland. (Walker, <span class="italic">Vindication</span>, 23)</blockquote>Walker's <span class="italic">True Account</span> was in early 1690 attacked in print by the Irish Presbyterian minister John Mackenzie, who had been his regimental chaplain during the siege. &#145;Walker&#146;, wrote Mackenzie, &#145;was a man of peace all the time and was guilty of shedding no other blood to stain his coat but the blood of the grape&#146;  (Mackenzie, <span class="italic">Invisible Champion</span>, 8). The <span class="italic">True Account</span> was criticized for falsely playing up Walker's own part in the siege at the expense of others: &#145;Gov. Baker has been thus injuriously pilfered of several of his deserved plumes, and Dr Walker adorned with them&#146;  (Mackenzie, <span class="italic">Narrative</span>, preface, iii).<br>
<br>Mackenzie took particular exception to Walker's describing himself throughout the <span class="italic">True Account</span> as &#145;The Governor&#146;, thereby giving the impression that he stood above Baker and Michelburne. Whenever Baker or Michelburne signed a document first, Mackenzie asserted, Walker &#145;seldom failed to crowd in his name before them&#146;  (Mackenzie, <span class="italic">Narrative</span>, 62). Whatever the truth of that, Mackenzie's claim that Walker was not a governor at all, but merely the commissary of stores, is certainly false. This is clear from Michelburne's barbed remark of 1692 that he &#145;was in joynt Command with the Doctor, whose conduct appear'd more conspicuous in the Eating part than the Fighting, and reason good, the Charge of the Stores, and Provision being committed to him alone&#146;  (Michelburne, <span class="italic">An Account</span>, x).<br>
<br>In recounting a surprise attack by the defenders in the early hours of 6 May, Walker described himself as leading &#145;at the head of them with all imaginable silence&#146;  (Walker, <span class="italic">True Account</span>, 26). Mackenzie retorted: &#145;if he did so, it was not only with all imaginable silence, but with so wonderful secrecy too, as to be neither seen nor heard by any of those that are said to follow him&#146;  (Mackenzie, <span class="italic">Invisible Champion</span>, 8).<br>
<br>Walker was also criticized for belittling the part in the defence played by the Presbyterians in the city. In the <span class="italic">True Account</span>, he listed the names of seventeen other clergymen who were in the city during the siege. There were also seven nonconforming ministers, he wrote, &#145;whose names I could not learn&#146;  (Hempton, 146), but noted that they &#145;were equally careful of their people and kept them obedient and quiet&#146;  (ibid., 113). This statement, with its suggestion that the Presbyterians were naturally disobedient and noisy, still caused anger two centuries after his death. &#145;Perhaps no other passage could be produced from the whole range of English literature in which an equal amount of deliberate and stinging malice is conveyed under the garb of innocence and praise&#146;  (Witherow, 300).<br>
<br>To the Presbyterians, Walker's crime was aggravated by his printing a misspelt list of those nonconforming ministers at the end of his <span class="italic">Vindication</span>. William Gilchrist of Kilrea was spelt as &#145;Mr W. KilChrist&#146;. &#145;The mischievious intent cannot be mistaken&#146;, wrote Doctor Killen  (Killen, xvi). It was &#145;a puerile attempt to annoy the Presbyterians&#146;  (ibid.).<h2>
<a name="TheBoyne"></a>The Boyne</h2>Walker travelled back to Ireland in February 1690 and was in Carrickfergus to greet King William on his arrival on 14 June. The see of Derry became vacant on the death of Ezekiel Hopkins on 19 June, but Walker was never consecrated bishop, as he accompanied the army on its march south. While encouraging the troops forward, he was shot dead at the battle of the Boyne on 1 July 1690. The account published by Sir John Dalrymple in 1771 that, on being told of Walker's death by the river, King William enquired sarcastically &#145;Fool that he was, what had he to do there?&#146;  (Dalrymple, 1.40) is apocryphal. Walker's corpse was stripped by camp followers and was buried on the field of battle on the same day.<br>
<br>Thirteen years later Walker's widow paid for his remains to be disinterred and reburied in the church at Castlecaulfield, co. Tyrone. The Latin inscription on his monument there reads: &#145;His fame shall be more durable than rock.&#146; When the bones were inspected in 1838 it was found that they belonged to more than one man. &#145;A cast was taken of the skull, which was perfectly sound, and in which the organs of intelligence and firmness were remarkably developed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Newry Telegraph</span>, 30 Oct 1838). In 1826 a statue of Walker on an 81 foot stone column was erected on the walls of Londonderry. It was destroyed by a bomb in 1973.<br>
