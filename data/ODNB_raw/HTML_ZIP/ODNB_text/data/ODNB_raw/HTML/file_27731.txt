<span class="headword">Trevor,  Marcus <span class="st"> [Mark]</span></span>, first Viscount Dungannon  (1618&#150;1670), <span class="occ">royalist army officer and politician</span>, was born at Rostrevor, co. Down, on 15 April 1618, the son of Sir Edward Trevor (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1649) of Rostrevor and of Bryneunallt, Denbighshire, and his second wife, Rose (<i>d</i>. 1623), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28032/', "Henry Ussher")</script>, archbishop of Armagh. His father had left his property in Wales for estates in Ireland worth &pound;800 per annum.<br>
<br>Trevor was admitted to the Inner Temple in November 1634. However, his connections to the planter community in Ireland were strong. On 29 September 1633 he was engaged to marry Frances (<i>c</i>.1618&#150;1656), the daughter and coheir of Marmaduke Whitechurch of Loughbrickland, co. Down. They married in August 1636 after her parents' deaths; they had two children. His sister married Sir Hans Hamilton of Monella and Hamilton's Bawn. In September 1636 Trevor walked in Lord Montgomery of Ards's funeral procession. In the 1640 Down election he and his father aligned themselves with the planter Hills and the Irish Bagnalls, McGuinesses, and O'Neills against the Montgomery&#150;Hamilton (planter) faction and their Irish allies. He served as MP for Downpatrick (1639&#150;49), while his father was elected for Newtownards in 1640. Following the Irish rising of October 1641 the insurgents imprisoned his father in Narrowater Castle, Newry, until April 1642. Marcus Trevor became a commander in Down, and received a letter threatening reprisals from the rebel Con Magennis (perhaps a former political ally). He later joined one of the earl of Ormond's regiments. In October 1643 he departed for England to serve the king against the parliamentarians. Following parliamentarian advances in north-east Wales he found himself a major of horse defending Holt Bridge with Ellice's foot. He acquired command of the horse regiment of Arthur, Lord Capel (originally raised in November 1642). On 12 January 1644 he just escaped capture by the parliamentarians when they made a night attack on Ellesmere, Shropshire. By February his regiment mustered just 30 men, but by 5 May its strength had risen to 400. He joined Prince Rupert's army on 16 May.<br>
<br>At the battle of Marston Moor his regiment served with the right wing of the royalist cavalry at the extreme left of the front line. Once the battle started Marcus countercharged Cromwell's horse regiment, hitting it in the right flank. He personally fought Cromwell and wounded him, forcing the future lord protector to leave the action to have his wound dressed. Trevor's horse survived the battle and retreated to north Wales. He became the governor of Ruthin Castle on the River Clywd. His regiment was badly weakened in the action at Montgomery Castle on 18 September. On 19 October Sir Thomas Myddleton's parliamentarian force attacked Ruthin. Trevor and his 120 cavalry fled, but his deputy successfully held the town. In December the inhabitants of the vale of Clywd petitioned Lord Byron against the regiment's excessive requisitions. Before the war's end Trevor's horse was cast into Prince Charles's horse as reinforcements, and it disbanded following the royalist defeat in Cornwall. On 12 April 1646 Trevor surrendered Ruthin Castle to the parliamentarians. He submitted to Fairfax in Oxford in May.<br>
<br>In July 1647 Trevor and his wife, Frances, were in Holywell, Flintshire, on the way to Ireland. Once there he joined Michael Jones's parliamentarian force for service against the Irish confederates. He received the governorship of Carlingford on 13 April 1648. On 3 November while scouting for Jones he prevented the parliamentarians from being surprised when he spotted Owen Roe O'Neill's army crossing a bridge near Clonee, 5 miles from Dublin. He served under Colonel George Monck, perhaps as late as April 1649. On hearing of Charles I's execution he deserted the parliamentarian army and joined Ormond's Irish royalist army. In May he helped Lord Inchiquin, who commanded 2000 foot and 1500 horse, to blockade and capture Drogheda. On 23 July with six horse troops he attacked the Irish confederate Lieutenant-General Richard O'Farrell who was convoying a supply of ammunition received from the parliamentarians. Trevor's cavalry dispersed all but 70 of the 800 largely drunken Irish foot and horse, forcing O'Neill's army to retreat into Monaghan. Subsequently he commanded a food and ammunition magazine at Ardee, but he could not aid Drogheda during Cromwell's siege. On 26 September with 500 horse he attacked Colonel Robert Venables at Dromore. Trevor's initial success turned to failure when the English rallied. Following a skirmish Trevor retreated west across the River Bann. After Ormond and O'Neill formed an alliance on 12 October Trevor was so excited at the prospects it offered that he travelled to his former enemy's camp to pay his respects. In November, while serving with Inchiquin during the attack on Cromwell at Glascarig near Wexford he was shot in the belly and carried to Kilkenny. On 16 December Monck ordered Major George Rawdon to prohibit Trevor from returning to his estates. In March 1650 Ormond promoted him lieutenant-general of horse, but in April with Viscount Montgomery of Ards and Lord Moore he submitted to Cromwell at Clonmell.<br>
<br>The regicide Colonel John Jones (who hailed from north Wales, as had Trevor's father) had succeeded Trevor as governor of Carlingford, and despite their political differences the two men became friends. As Jones married a sister of Cromwell's in 1655 the connection had potential patronage benefits for Trevor. Meanwhile in October 1651, perhaps in connection with the terms of his submission, he claimed exemption from the common burdens. The Commonwealth government trusted him sufficiently in October 1652 to order him to gather 500 Roman Catholic Irish in Ulster and march them to Carlingford for transportation from the province. Subsequently he supported Henry Cromwell major-general of the forces in Ireland, and from 1657 lord deputy, spent time in Dublin, and even received a hawk from his former oppressor Major Rawdon. As late as November 1654 the lord protector suggested that he be imprisoned, but he changed his policy on 25 April 1655 when he ordered that his former adversary be placed under his protection and permitted to use his Irish estates. Trevor later claimed that as the republic fell apart he had tried to suborn Henry Cromwell to declare for Charles II, promising him 5000 troops from Ulster. Whatever the truth of that story, he certainly maintained close relations with the protectorate regime in Ireland as it entered its final days. Jones arranged for him to receive the lease of the corporation of Carlingford and its lands (600 acres), while in June 1659 the lord lieutenant presented him with a similar grant of Dundalk (1200 acres) as well as further lands in co. Louth, and in co. Kildare, as one of his last acts. In November 1659 with Viscount Montgomery of Ards and Colonel Vere Essex Cromwell he began plotting the restoration of the monarchy in Ireland. In the next month he was involved in the royalist plot against Dublin Castle. In 1660 he kept Ormond, then living in Brussels, apprised of Irish affairs.<br>
<br>After the Restoration Trevor gained a degree of public prominence as a government official. He became ranger of Ulster on 6 December and was appointed to the Irish privy council on 19 December. In 1661 the shire electors of Down returned him to the Dublin parliament. His friendship with Ormond brought him material benefits when on 20 March 1661 the Irish land commissioners confirmed his rights (against those of pre-October 1641 landholders and grantees who had served against the Irish rebels) to the protectorate land grants, a decision confirmed by the privy council on 24 October. He received the office of master of the game and ranger-general of his majesty's woods (including Phoenix Park, where the post had a lodge) on 28 August, the licence for gunpowder manufacture in Down on 16 October, and command of a troop of Irish horse. He was elevated to the Irish peerage on 28 August 1662 as Baron Trevor of Rostrevor and Viscount Dungannon and entered the Irish House of Lords on 12 September. The citation in his grant of supporters stated the elevation to peerage arose from his wounding Cromwell, but given his subsequent career the patronage of Ormond was most likely the cause of the honour. During the Restoration he alternated his time between Ulster and Dublin. As lord lieutenant of co. Down from 1664 he dealt with tory bands by setting them against each other, as opposed to the more usual policy of allowing them to go into voluntary exile with the profits of their crimes. In June 1666 he helped to suppress a mutiny by the Carrickfergus Castle garrison. That August he travelled to co. Kilkenny, co. Wicklow, and co. Wexford in the company of Ormond. On 14 August 1667 he received the appointment as marshal of Ireland, which brought him an annual salary of &pound;687. In April 1668 he and his wife travelled to Holyhead, Chester, and Coventry with Ormond. In October 1669, along with Viscount Conway, he dealt with the pay stoppage of the Royal regiment in Dublin. He died on 3 January 1670 at Dundalk and was buried in Clanallin church, near Rostrevor, on 10 January. His first wife had died on 9 February 1656. He was survived by his second wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1692), daughter and heir of John Lewis of Anglesey and widow of John Owen of Orieltown, Pembrokeshire.<br>
<br>With his first wife, Frances, Trevor had two sons. Arthur was born in 1644 and died on 1 June 1661. Marcus (1645&#150;3 June 1669), matriculated at Trinity College, Dublin, on 10 June 1661, and served as the MP for Down from November 1665 to August 1666. With his second wife Trevor had four sons. Edward died in March 1666. Lewis succeeded as second viscount. He subscribed for the publication of the fourth edition of Milton's <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>. He died in Spring Gardens, Middlesex, and was buried on 3 January 1692 in Kensington. John, born in Dublin in 1668, matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 27 March 1686 with his brother Marcus 
    (Mark; <i>b</i>. 1669)
  . On 31 December 1687 the younger brother accidentally shot and killed his sibling and fellow student. Mark succeeded as third viscount in 1692. After Oxford he attended the Inner Temple in 1688; he had a reputation for drunkenness. Mark became a soldier as his father had and served as colonel of the foot in Spain from 1704 until his death at Alicante on 8 November 1706 from spotted fever. He had married Arabella Susanna, widow of Sir John Magill, and daughter of Hugh Hamilton of Glenawly. Their daughter Arabella, baptized on 7 February 1667, married the Hon. Henry Bertie on 17 July 1708, and died on 10 December 1708. As the peerage was limited to the male heirs she did not succeed to the title. Eventually the property passed to Arthur Hill-Trevor, Viscount Dungannon.<br>
