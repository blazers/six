<span class="headword">Alnwick,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1275&#150;1333), <span class="occ">Franciscan friar and theologian, and bishop of Giovinazzo</span>, took his name from Alnwick in Northumberland. The course of his later career suggests that he was born about 1275. Having become a Franciscan friar, he probably studied theology at his order's studium at Newcastle. However, by 1303 he was a licensed doctor of theology at Paris, being then listed among the few foreign masters who sided with Philippe IV, king of France, in his dispute with Pope Boniface VIII. Alnwick also lectured at other intellectual centres on the continent&#151;at Montpellier, Bologna, and Naples. But he returned to England, for he is listed as the forty-second Franciscan regent master at Oxford. This would place him as a master at Oxford about 1316, during the years when Henry Harclay was chancellor of the university.<br>
<br>Notes in the margins of Alnwick's manuscripts indicate that he was in lively debate with the authors of his own and recent times, English and French, including Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure, Henri de Gand, Pierre Aureole, Giacomo da Ascoli, Godefroi de Fontaines, Henry Harclay, and Thomas Wilton. Mainly, however, he was in conversation with John Duns Scotus, and it was this association that kept his memory alive, particularly among other Scotists, like Peter Thomas and the anonymous Scotist of Vatican City, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, MS Vat. lat. 869, who disagreed with him. He collaborated with Scotus in the production of the latter's <span class="italic">Commentary on the &#145;Sentences&#146;</span> (<span class="italic">Ordinatio</span>). He also served as the reporter for one of Scotus's <span class="italic">Collationes</span>, and compiled the long additions (<span class="italic">Additiones magnae</span>) which were meant to fill the lacunae left in books 1 and 2 of the <span class="italic">Ordinatio</span>. But although Alnwick based his philosophy and theology on the fundamental starting points of Scotus's teaching, he often followed his own star.<br>
<br>Alnwick's commentary on Peter Lombard's <span class="italic">Sentences</span> is preserved in whole or part in manuscripts found in Assisi, Cracow, and Padua. A few questions of this commentary have been edited in journals, as have almost a dozen questions of his <span class="italic">Determinationes</span>, as well as a sermon on the beatific vision, and some questions from his commentary on the <span class="italic">De anima</span>. His <span class="italic">Quodlibet</span> and <span class="italic">Quaestiones de esse intelligibili</span> were published in 1937 as volume 10 of the <span class="roman">Bibliotheca Franciscana Scholastica Medii Aevi</span>.<br>
<br>Alnwick participated in the general chapter of the Franciscan order held at Perugia in 1322, where he joined the theologians who drew up and signed the decree <span class="italic">De paupertate Christi</span> attacking the position on apostolic poverty maintained by Pope John XXII. Alnwick may not have been actively involved in the formulation of the decree, but his commitment to it is shown by the public defence he subsequently gave of it in the last question of his <span class="italic">Determinationes</span>. There he argued that Christ and his apostles possessed nothing either personally or in common. This opposition to the papal thesis caused Pope John in 1323 to order the bishops of Bologna and Ferrara to initiate a process against Alnwick, who, however, fled to Naples, where King Robert of Sicily befriended him, and in 1330 had him canonically appointed and legitimately confirmed as bishop of Giovinazzo. He died in Avignon in March 1333.<br>
