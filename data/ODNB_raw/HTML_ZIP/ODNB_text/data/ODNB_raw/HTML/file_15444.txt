<span class="headword">Keppel,  William Coutts</span>, seventh earl of Albemarle and Viscount Bury  (1832&#150;1894), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in London on 15 April 1832, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15442/', "George Thomas Keppel, sixth earl of Albemarle (1799&#150;1891)")</script>, and his wife, Susan (<i>d</i>. 1885), third daughter of Sir Coutts Trotter, bt. From 1851 to 1891 he was styled Viscount Bury, his father's second title. He was educated at Eton College, and in 1843, when eleven years old, was gazetted ensign and lieutenant in the 43rd regiment. In 1849 he became lieutenant in the Scots guards, and during 1850&#150;51 he was private secretary to Lord John Russell. In 1852 he went to India as aide-de-camp to Lord Frederick Fitzclarence, commander-in-chief at Bombay. In the following year he came home on sick leave, retired from the army, and in December 1854 went to Canada as superintendent of Indian affairs. This experience produced his <span class="italic">Exodus of the Western Nations</span> (2 vols., 1865), which is really a history of North America, with particular reference to Canada. While in Canada he married, on 15 November 1855, at Dundurn, Sophia Mary, (<i>d</i>. 5 April 1917), daughter of Sir Alan Napier MacNab, speaker of the Canadian parliament, and his second wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stuart. They had three sons and seven daughters.<br>
<br>After his return to England Bury was, on 30 March 1857, elected as a Liberal for Norwich, a notoriously corrupt borough. He was re-elected on 29 April 1859, and again on 28 June following his appointment by Lord Palmerston to the post of treasurer of the household. His election was, however, declared void on petition and on 1 December 1860 he was returned for Wick burghs. He stood for Dover at the general election of 1865, but was defeated, and he ceased to be treasurer of the household in 1866 when the Conservatives came into power. On 17 November 1868 he was returned for Berwick. In 1874 he was defeated for Berwick, and in 1875 for Stroud. He next became a Conservative, and on 6 September 1876 was raised to the peerage during his father's lifetime as Baron Ashford. From March 1878 to April 1880 he was under-secretary for war under Beaconsfield, and in 1885&#150;6 he held the same office under Lord Salisbury. On Easter Sunday 1879 he was received into the Roman Catholic church (his father-in-law's earlier conversion had led to uproar in Canada). He had a public row with W. E. Gladstone in 1880 about the Vatican Council of 1870.<br>
<br>Bury, who was created KCMG in 1870, was an enthusiastic member of the volunteers and in 1860 published a pamphlet on their reform. In the same year he was made lieutenant-colonel of the Civil Service rifle volunteers, and volunteer aide-de-camp to the queen in 1881. He was also author of <span class="italic">The Rinderpest Treated by Homoeopathy in South Holland</span> (1865) and with G. Lacy Hillier of <span class="italic">Cycling</span>, in the <span class="roman">Badminton Library</span> (1887), a popular work in its day. Bury succeeded his father as seventh earl of Albemarle on 21 February 1891, and died, of paralysis, at Prospect House, Barnes, Surrey, on 28 August 1894, being buried on the 31st at the family seat, Quidenham, Norfolk.<br>
