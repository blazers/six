<span class="headword">Needham,  Roger Michael</span>  (1935&#150;2003), <span class="occ">computer scientist</span>, was born on 9 February 1935 at 262 Vicarage Road, King's Heath, Birmingham, the only child of Leonard William Needham (<i>c</i>.1905&#150;1973), a university lecturer in chemistry, and his wife, Phyllis Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Baker (<i>c</i>.1904&#150;1976), both of 99 Middle Park Road, Selly Oak, Birmingham. His parents met as chemistry students at the University of Birmingham. He was brought up in Sheffield and educated at Doncaster grammar school. He went to St John's College, Cambridge, in 1953 as a scholar to study mathematics. In his own words, Needham discovered &#145;five years of mathematics is too much for anybody&#146;  (personal knowledge), so in his third year he switched to philosophy. This early training in marshalling arguments engendered the clarity and precision that became the hallmark of his publications and lectures. As an undergraduate Needham met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98729/', "Karen Ida Boalth Sp&#228;rck Jones (1935&#150;2007)")</script>, whom he married on 10 June 1958; she was the daughter of Alfred Owen Jones, college lecturer. Both had an interest in language which led them to work together on &#145;automatic language processing&#146; at the Cambridge Language Research Unit. As his introduction to computing Needham took the diploma in numerical analysis and automatic computing in 1957 at the Cambridge University Mathematical (later Computer) Laboratory. He obtained his PhD in 1961 with a thesis on automatic information classification and retrieval; this was the foundation for his lifelong interest in computer algorithms and data structures. While research students he and Karen built their own single-storey wooden house in Coton, Cambridge, in which they lived for most of their married life; they also bought their first boat.<br>
<br>Following his PhD Needham joined the team working under Maurice Wilkes building a successor to the early EDSAC (electronic delay storage automatic calculator) computers. The project was a collaboration with International Computers and Tabulators Ltd (ICT, later International Computers Ltd, or ICL), and was based on a modified design of the Atlas computer which became known as TITAN (Atlas 2 in its commercial form). TITAN was initially intended to operate as a &#145;batch processing system&#146;, but early in the project Wilkes visited the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he saw an example of &#145;time sharing&#146;, where users worked interactively at online terminals. Wilkes recognized this as the way of the future and returned fired with enthusiasm for having TITAN adopt this model. The task was challenging, requiring a complete revision of the operating system design. Needham made a major contribution to this project, carrying it to a successful conclusion; this enabled TITAN to provide the Cambridge University central computing service through to the early 1970s and established Needham as a leading operating systems researcher. The scheme he invented that made it impossible for user passwords to be stolen from the system remained generally in use on contemporary systems at the time of his death.<br>
<br>By the early 1970s Needham had become Wilkes's right-hand man, being made reader in 1973, succeeding Wilkes as laboratory head on his retirement in 1980, and becoming professor of computer systems in 1981. The period from 1975 to 1990 was a golden age: the Computer Laboratory grew in strength, funding was adequate, and government involvement in academic matters was benign. Needham gave vigorous leadership to a series of projects and through them mentored many generations of research students who went on to hold significant positions in academia and industry. First came the Cambridge CAP computer and its operating system, and then the Cambridge model distributed system based on the pioneering Cambridge ring local area network developed by Wilkes and David Wheeler. This project developed a very early example of client-server computing, foreshadowing later &#145;thin-client&#146; systems. From 1977 to 1984 Needham established a close relationship with the Xerox research centre in Palo Alto, California, working as a visiting consultant. Palo Alto was the cradle for much of the development of personal computers and networks. Needham worked on the design of file servers, large-scale electronic mail systems, and then the research for which he was best known, the design of cryptographic protocols for authentication. He first published on this topic with Michael Schroeder in 1978, continuing with seminal work on using mathematical logic for showing the correctness of authentication protocols in collaboration with Mike Burrows and Mart&iacute;n Abadi, at that time working at the DEC systems research centre in California.<br>
<br>As a senior academic Needham was drawn into the university and wider activities. He served on university and national bodies like the University Grants Committee. He became the first Cambridge University pro-vice-chancellor in 1996. Working with the vice-chancellor, Alec Broers, Needham developed his existing role in fostering strong relationships between Cambridge University and industry, becoming known as one of the &#145;godfathers&#146; of the economic growth of the Cambridge region as a centre for hi-tech research and development. But while he enjoyed these activities he hankered for new challenges, and mindful of the university's retiring age he happily seized the opportunity to set up and run Microsoft's first overseas research laboratory in Cambridge in 1997. As the first managing director of Microsoft Research Ltd he set the tone of the laboratory which continued after his death: long-range research, done by the best people given a free hand.<br>
<br>Needham's work was widely recognized. He became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1985 and of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1993&#151;he particularly enjoyed the latter, having always regarded himself as a practical man. He was a fellow of the British Computer Society and, from 1994, of the Association for Computing Machinery. He won the Institution of Electrical Engineers' Faraday medal in 1998. He was appointed CBE in 2001. He was a fellow of Wolfson College, Cambridge, from 1965 until his death.<br>
<br>Needham was a plain speaker, an entertaining conversationalist with a puckish sense of humour, and, for someone with his breadth of knowledge, a man remarkably tolerant of those with less understanding. Outside work his passions were reading, sailing, and politics. He was a left-leaning South Cambridgeshire district councillor for many years. As Needham's career developed so too did his wife Karen's: she continued in the area of language and information processing. They took great interest in each other's research, discussing projects together and commenting on each other's papers and lectures. Visiting the Needhams' home was always a delight, for the hospitality and discourse offered and to share in their pleasure in books, old and contemporary, on many subjects, and in their varied and intriguing objects, some collected and others Karen's artistic handiwork.<br>
<br>Needham was diagnosed with cancer late in 2002 and died at his home, 9 Long Lane, Willingham, Cambridge, on 1 March 2003. He was survived by his wife. They had no children. After his death Microsoft sponsored an annual Roger Needham prize, to be awarded by the British Computer Society for a distinguished research contribution in computer science by a young UK-based researcher. As a memorial the University of Cambridge named the building occupied by the Microsoft Cambridge research laboratory the Roger Needham Building. This news was given to Needham by Sir Alec Broers at an event organized to celebrate Needham's fifty years' association with Cambridge, attended by many of his friends and colleagues, a few weeks before his death.<br>
