<span class="headword">Crowe, Sir  Edward Thomas Frederick</span>  (1877&#150;1960), <span class="occ">public servant</span>, was born at Zante in the Ionian Islands on 20 August 1877, the son of Alfred Louis Crowe, who later became vice-consul for the island, and his wife, Matilda Fortunata Barff. He was educated at Bedford grammar school and in 1897 joined the consular service as a student interpreter in Japan. In 1901 he married Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1947), daughter of William Hyde Lay, British consul at Chefoo (Yantai), China. They had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>During the Russo-Japanese War Crowe was in charge of the consulate at Tamsui (Danshui), Taipei (Tabei), then a Japanese possession, where his ability attracted attention at Tokyo, and in 1906 he was assigned to the legation as commercial attach&eacute;. He was appointed CMG in 1911. In 1918, after the creation of the department of overseas trade and the commercial diplomatic service, he was confirmed as the first commercial counsellor at the new embassy in Tokyo. He was knighted in 1922, and was recalled to London in 1924. He never returned to the Far East, but his admiration and affection for the Japanese people remained a feature of his life. For seven years he was vice-president of the Japan Society in London, the Japanese ambassador being traditionally its president, and he took an active part in its work, on the council and at its lectures. After the Second World War he led a movement for the submission of a petition for clemency to the war crimes tribunal at Tokyo for Mamoru Shigemitsu, the former ambassador in London and later Japanese foreign minister. In 1950 Crowe became the first president of the Japan Association, formed to promote British trade interests in Japan. In 1955 he was decorated with the Japanese order (first class) of the Sacred Treasure.<br>
<br>From 1924 to 1928 Crowe served as director of the foreign division of the department of overseas trade, and in April 1928 he was chosen to succeed Sir William Clark as comptroller-general of the department. During his term of office, which lasted until the autumn of 1937, he did much to foster British trade with the Far East, and to reconcile the interests of British and Japanese cotton-goods exporters. His nine years as comptroller-general marked the period of widest influence for the department. He brought to the post a practical and sympathetic experience of the problems facing exporters and he was endowed with boundless energy, an inquisitive mind, and a remarkable capacity for winning people's confidence. Not content with the current administrative duties of his office, he got to know intimately each member of his staff, at home or overseas; he was in personal contact with the leaders in banking, industry, and commerce in London; and, unusually for a government official, he frequently took the initiative to visit the centres of industry in the provinces and to address their chambers of commerce. Single-handed he did much to reverse the previous apathy or indifference of government departments to the difficulties of exporters. Above all, he strove for the expansion of the annual British Industries Fair which provided an important showcase for British exports. For nine years he was vice-president of the International Exhibitions Bureau at Paris, and vice-president of the board of governors of the Imperial Institute. In recognition of his services he was advanced to KCMG in 1930.<br>
<br>Crowe retired from government service in 1937, and took up the chairmanship of Croda Ltd and directorships of W. T. Henley's Telegraph Works Company, Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company, and the English Electric Company Ltd. He became an ardent supporter of the Royal Society of Arts, serving as vice-president (1937&#150;60), president (1942&#150;3), and chairman of the council (1941&#150;3). He identified himself particularly with the society's work for the vocational education of young people and for sixteen years was chairman of its examination committee. He also served on many government committees, including Lord Goschen's on the law relating to trade marks, Lord Gorell's on art and industry, and Lord Fleming's on public schools.<br>
<br>Crowe was one whose character found its happier development only after his release from the ties of official life. He was not a scholar and he disliked being alone; his delight was in meeting people and drawing them to him. After his death, Sir Harry Lindsay recalled &#145;his sense of human neighbourliness&#146;, which &#145;endeared him to all with whom he came into contact&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Society of Arts</span>, 298). He had a graceful facility for public speaking, enjoyed abundant health, and appeared to be incapable of fatigue. In his old age, with his mass of white hair, his monocle, and his blue beret, he was a respected and popular figure. He died on 8 March 1960 at 10 Sharia Willcocks Zamalek, Cairo, during a visit to his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70377/', "Colin Tradescant Crowe")</script>, then British charg&eacute; d'affaires in Cairo. A memorial service was held in his honour at Holy Trinity Church, Brompton, on 20 May.<br>
