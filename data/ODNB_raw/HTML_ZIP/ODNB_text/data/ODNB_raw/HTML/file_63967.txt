<span class="headword">Ponsonby,  Frederick</span>, third earl of Bessborough  (1758&#150;1844), <span class="occ">politician and landowner</span>, was born on 24 January 1758, most probably at 1 Cavendish Square, London, the fifth (but only surviving) son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22504/', "William Ponsonby, second earl of Bessborough (1704&#150;1793)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Caroline Cavendish (1719&#150;1760), daughter of the third duke of Devonshire; he was baptized at St Marylebone on 21 February 1758. Viscount Duncannon&#151;as he was to be known until his father's death on 11 March 1793&#151;was connected from birth to the leading whig families. Though two of his sons did notable public service, he got through a long life with scant notice, and is known almost wholly as the husband of one of the finest letter-writers in English.<br>
<br>After a private schooling, a spell at Christ Church, Oxford (1774&#150;77), and the grand tour, Duncannon married on 27 November 1780 Lady Henrietta Spencer (1761&#150;1821) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38506/', "Ponsonby, Henrietta Frances")</script>], daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38713/', "John Spencer, first Earl Spencer")</script>, and sister of Georgiana, duchess of Devonshire. In the same year he was elected, in the Devonshire interest, MP for Knaresborough, a seat he kept until his removal to the Lords in 1793. His political career was undistinguished. He supported Charles James Fox on the American War of Independence, blaming it on the king's &#145;evil&#146; advisers, and he was briefly a lord of the Admiralty (1782, 1783) in the Rockingham and Fox&#150;North administrations. In 1794 he followed the duke of Portland and seconded the address in support of the war with France, but a few months later the recall from Ireland of his brother-in-law William, second Earl Fitzwilliam, drove him back into opposition; he was the only other peer to sign Fitzwilliam's protest  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 8 May 1795). He remained in moderate opposition; at the forming in 1806 of the Fox&#150;Grenville ministry he declined the postmastership and then the lord stewardship to accommodate others. On Irish matters he opposed the Union and Arthur Wellesley's 1807 <span class="roman">Insurrection Bill</span>.<br>
<br>At Cavendish Square, where Duncannon and his bride at once took part in high whig social life, three sons and a daughter were born between 1781 and 1787. Both he and, to begin with, his wife gambled. Her debts, though smaller than her sister's, led him in 1793 to plead with her to tell him everything; he trusted &#145;that for the future you will see the necessity of our not going on as we have done&#146;  (Bessborough and Aspinall, 92). In the same year he succeeded his father as third earl of Bessborough in the Irish peerage. At the same time he took over the Bessborough estates in co. Kilkenny but he found the income disappointing because, in an inflationary period, the 27,000 acres were mostly let on long leases; though he took his seat in the Irish parliament he was an absentee, living in London and at Roehampton in Surrey. &#145;It is a sad piece of business&#146;, he wrote to his wife from Bessborough in 1793, &#145;to settle so many things, especially for me who has never been used to manage any thing&#146;  (Bessborough and Aspinall, 88). In 1801 he sold the family picture collection, and only a &pound;100,000 legacy from his kinsman Henry Cavendish relieved him in 1810 from financial embarrassment.<br>
<br>Bessborough's relationship with his wife still baffles: published documentation is partial in all senses, and some remains inaccessible. Contemporary comment, by Horace Walpole and others, generally stressed the &#145;kind&#146; and &#145;amiable&#146; temperament he shared with the whole Ponsonby family. Yet in the early years of the marriage his Cavendish aunt the duchess of Portland reproved him for scolding his wife in public, and his Spencer in-laws bridled at his neglect of her and his staying out all night. These may have been minor incidents within the conventions of aristocratic married life. His wife was several times unfaithful, as Duncannon apparently was himself; her brief affair with Richard Brinsley Sheridan, which Bessborough discovered in 1789, so flagrantly breached the rule (for women) &#145;thou shalt not be found out&#146; that he started divorce proceedings, but was persuaded by his brother-in-law the fifth duke of Devonshire to forgive his wife. Published extracts from his letters to her in 1793, when she was ill, are sensible and show solicitude, affection, and respect: &#145;no happiness can be complete without you&#146;  (Bessborough and Aspinall, 95&#150;6). Lady Bessborough's long and wholehearted affair from 1794 with the younger Granville Leveson-Gower produced two children, brought up, as was the custom, in their natural father's family under assumed names. Throughout it her letters as published give the impression that Bessborough remained amiable but had to be handled gingerly: the rule against letting the affair show held, and the births were disguised as &#145;illness&#146;. A limited man married to a clever, emotional, witty woman, he seems to have retreated into his hobbies&#151;cards, sketching, and print collecting; he interleaved Daniel Lysons's four-volume <span class="italic">Environs of London</span> with some 2000 prints. During the scandal of their daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15911/', "Lady Caroline Lamb's")</script> affair with Byron he appears to have been sympathetic but to have left the burden of intervention to his wife.<br>
<br>According to Sir Joshua Reynolds's portrait at Althorp Bessborough had the oval, slightly aquiline, &#145;gentlemanlike&#146; Cavendish face. From 1798 he suffered bad fits of gout. He was fond of his children, especially his youngest child, William (from 1838 Lord de Mauley). After his wife's death he handed over his properties to his eldest son and lived with William at Canford House, Dorset, where he died on 3 February 1844. He was buried there but was later reburied alongside his son at Hatherop, Gloucestershire, where de Mauley had moved after selling Canford House.<br>

<p> some time after 1821 had handed over use of houses and lands to eldest son (but not clear whether conveyed ownership, or what financial arrangements were); in early married life (1780s&#150;90s) was financially insecure, in part because of gambling and other debts, in part, probably, because Irish rents failed to catch up with inflation; situation greatly eased in 1810 by legacy of &pound;100,000 from kinsman Henry Cavendish: Bessborough and Aspinall, eds., <i>Lady Bessborough</i>
