<span class="headword">Armstrong, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1633, <em>d.</em> 1684), <span class="occ">army officer and conspirator</span>, was baptized on 27 December 1633 at St Stephen's protestant church, Nijmegen, the son of Thomas Armstrong (<i>d</i>. 1662), army officer, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Anderson. A coronet of horse at Nijmegen in 1633, the elder Armstrong was appointed quartermaster-general of horse in Ireland in 1640. He served under Ormond in the wars in Ireland, was knighted by March 1643, received an estate at Corbellis, co. Dublin (1643), and sat for Dublin in the Irish parliament in 1647. He surrendered Trim, co. Meath (1650), and Castle Rushen, Isle of Man (1651), to the forces of the English parliament. Incarcerated from April 1655 to June 1659 he supported the Restoration, received a patent to make farthings in Ireland (1660), and was reappointed quartermaster-general of horse in April 1662. He died on 19 November 1662.<br>
<br>The younger Armstrong imbibed his father's royalism, participated in the plot to seize Chester Castle in 1655, carried funds from the earl of Oxford to the exiled court, and may have been imprisoned for a year after he returned. He married Catherine Pollexfen (settlement dated 10 February 1657), niece of the earl of Clarendon; they had three daughters, Catherine, Jane, and Mary. Commissioned captain-lieutenant of Oxford's regiment of Horse Guards in February 1661, he was knighted in late 1667 or 1668 and would later serve as major of the king's Life Guards (1673&#150;8), lieutenant-colonel of the Queen's Horse (1678&#150;9), and lieutenant-colonel of the King's horse guards (1679). Following the death of the king's sister, Henriette-Anne, in June 1670, Armstrong conveyed the news to a distraught Charles II. Armstrong created a minor stir in August 1675 when he killed the son of one of the queen's ladies-in-waiting at a London theatre, but the man had provoked the dispute and drawn first and Armstrong was pardoned. He was naturalized by act of parliament in 1677. Associating himself with Charles's natural son, the duke of Monmouth, Armstrong served with him in France from 1672, fighting at the siege of Maastricht (1673). He served with Monmouth, this time alongside the Dutch, in 1678, and was wounded at St Denis. In 1679 he joined the duke in his suppression of the covenanter rising, culminating in the battle at Bothwell Bridge.<br>
<br>It was through Monmouth's influence that Armstrong was elected to the first Exclusion Parliament as MP for Stafford in March 1679. Here he served on two minor committees, to investigate abuses in the Post Office and, ironically, given his reputation for profligacy, to examine the laws against profanity. Although Shaftesbury listed Armstrong among the courtiers, he reputedly opposed Danby and certainly voted for the first of the bills to exclude James, duke of York, from the throne. Pressured by an irate James, Charles banished Armstrong from court in August because of &#145;his too pregnant zeal against the Duke of York&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, 4.535), yet he permitted Armstrong to sell his post in the guards and renewed the coinage patent formerly held by his father, though now shared with George Legge. About the same time Armstrong met with Buckingham, probably as Monmouth's agent, to discuss a plan for a common council in London that comprised men who had not taken the corporation oath and, according to Longford, he was also now intriguing with Shaftesbury. In the poisoned climate of subornation and alleged sedition following disclosures of the supposed Popish Plot, Elizabeth Cellier and her associates purportedly hoped to implicate Armstrong, Monmouth, Sir William Waller, and Charles Gerard, Viscount Brandon, in treason. As he waited for the second Exclusion Parliament to meet, Armstrong assisted Monmouth in his efforts to prove that Charles had secretly married Monmouth's mother, Lucy Walters. When parliament convened, Armstrong again sat for Stafford, serving on committees to investigate judicial proceedings and to arrange the trial of the Catholic peer Viscount Stafford. As a member of the 1681 Oxford Parliament, still for Stafford, he was appointed to the committee to prepare another exclusion bill. Following Shaftesbury's death an anonymous tory mocked both men's reputed dissoluteness, ascribing to the earl's imaginary will the line &#145;To thee [Armstrong] I do bequeath my brace of whores&#146;  (<span class="italic">Last Will and Testament of Anthony, King of Poland</span>, 1683).<br>
<br>Before the Oxford Parliament, Armstrong, Monmouth, and Lord William Russell had met at Shaftesbury's house, possibly to discuss an insurrection to compel Charles to ban James from the succession. When Charles became ill in May 1682 the three conferred again, and similar meetings ensued. Armstrong accompanied Monmouth on his progress through Staffordshire and Cheshire in September, and when the duke was arrested he dispatched Armstrong to obtain a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. Later that month Armstrong, Monmouth, Ford Lord Grey of Warke, Robert Ferguson, and Colonel John Rumsey discussed plans at Thomas Shepherd's house for an uprising. As the conspiring continued Armstrong and Ferguson were in contact with the cabal headed by the attorney Robert West, but Lord Howard of Escrick's later accusation that Sir Thomas planned to lead a party of assassins was baseless. With Grey and Monmouth, Armstrong examined the state of the royal guards and London's defences. Armstrong, Monmouth, and Grey also had discussions with Brandon and Sir Gilbert Gerard about a simultaneous rebellion in Cheshire. As the conspirators prepared to draft a revolutionary manifesto in the spring of 1683, Armstrong, Monmouth, Grey, Ferguson, and Rumsey favoured a monarchical settlement, not a republic. Although Armstrong insisted after his capture in 1684 that he knew nothing of assassination plans, the evidence indicates otherwise. Following disclosure of the Rye House assassination plot the government issued a proclamation on 28 June 1683 for Armstrong's apprehension, promising a reward of &pound;500 [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93794', "Rye House plotters")</script>].<br>
<br>Although he eluded capture Armstrong was indicted for high treason at the Old Bailey on 12 July; the state had two witnesses, Rumsey and Shepherd. A sentence of outlawry was pronounced against him in Michaelmas term. By August he was in Cleves with Grey and Ferguson, moving thereafter to Rotterdam. In exile, where he sometimes used the alias Henry Lawrence, he was reportedly planning to kill John Row, a possible witness against him, but Grey dissuaded him. However, Armstrong and Grey discussed the possibility of hiring an assassin to murder Rumsey and Shepherd. <i>En route</i> for Amsterdam in June 1684 Armstrong was captured by agents of Thomas Chudleigh with letters from Monmouth in his possession. Armstrong's efforts to stab himself or fling himself from the royal yacht were unsuccessful, and Charles's agents returned him to England under heavy guard. Detesting Armstrong to the end, James wrote sarcastically to William of Orange about the capture of &#145;that worthy assassinating knight&#146;  (Prinsterer, 588). At the king's bench on 14 June 1684 the court rejected Armstrong's request for a trial. His appeal to an Edwardian statute (5 &amp; 6 Edw. VI c. 11) permitting a trial for an outlaw who surrendered within a year was deemed irrelevant because he had been captured. When George Jeffreys sentenced him to die, his daughter protested that the court intended to murder him, and for this she was briefly confined. Professing himself a sincere member of the Church of England and innocent of any plot to assassinate Charles or alter the government, Armstrong was executed in London on 20 June. His head was affixed to Westminster Hall, three of his quarters displayed in London, and the fourth at Stafford. Although his marriage settlement had provided his widow with an Irish estate worth &pound;150 p.a., the government granted it to Sir Edward Scott. Armstrong also left bonds worth &pound;12,700. In 1689 his widow petitioned the convention for reversal of his attainder, which was finally granted in November 1694.<br>
