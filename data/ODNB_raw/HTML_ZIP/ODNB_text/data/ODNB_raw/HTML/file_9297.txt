<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fenton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Besswick; <em>married name </em>Powlett or Paulet]</span>,  Lavinia</span>, duchess of Bolton  (1710&#150;1760), <span class="occ">actress and singer</span>, was born on 7 October 1710 and baptized at St Margaret Westminster on 22 October as Lavinia Besswick, daughter of Peter and Elizabeth. According to <span class="italic">The Life of Lavinia Beswick, alias Fenton, alias Polly Peachum</span>, a mixture of fact and fiction published after <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> made her the toast of the town in 1728, she was the illegitimate daughter of one Beswick, a lieutenant in a man-of-war, who was recalled to his ship before she was born. We are told that when Beswick did not return Lavinia's mother married a Mr Fenton and opened a coffee house near Charing Cross. Lavinia, then aged seven or eight, &#145;being a Child of a vivacious lively Spirit, and a promising Beauty&#146;, was a favourite of the customers, and<blockquote>a Comedian belonging to the <i>Old House</i> [Drury Lane Theatre], took great Delight in hearing her sing such little Catches as she had learnt from the humming Beaux &hellip; and taught her some Airs, which have since been to her Advantage. (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 7)</blockquote>She was sent to boarding-school for five years, after which her mother began scheming for a suitable protector for her, but the girl found her own first lover, a Portuguese nobleman.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Life</span> states that she first appeared on stage in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">The Orphan</span> at the New Theatre in the Haymarket, later sharing a benefit there with Mr Gilbert, when she played Cherry in George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Stratagem</span>. She joined a twice-a-week summer company of young actors at Lincoln's Inn Fields, and was then engaged by the theatre manager John Rich for the winter season. The theatre advertisements bear this out, for &#145;a Gentlewoman who never appear'd on any Stage before&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Post</span>, 24 Feb 1726) played the <i>ing&eacute;nue</i> role of Serina in <span class="italic">The Orphan</span> at the New Theatre on 24 February 1726 and &#145;Miss Besswick&#146; shared a benefit there with Gilbert on 12 April, when <span class="italic">The Stratagem</span> was performed. During the summer season at Lincoln's Inn Fields Miss Fenton was advertised as Lucilla in William Davenant's <span class="italic">The Man's the Master</span>, &#145;being the first Time of her Appearance on this Stage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Courant</span>, 15 July 1726), and later played Lucia in Thomas Shadwell's <span class="italic">Epsom Wells</span> and Ginnet in Davenant's <span class="italic">The Wits</span>. With John Rich's patent company from autumn 1726 she took the role of Mrs Squeamish in William Wycherley's <span class="italic">The Country Wife</span>, made many appearances as a country lass in Lewis Theobald's pantomime <span class="italic">The Rape of Proserpine</span> and, during the benefits in spring 1727, was Cherry in <span class="italic">The Stratagem</span> and Lucy in Thomas Baker's <span class="italic">Tunbridge Walks</span>.<br>
<br>John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>, with Lavinia Fenton as Polly Peachum, was first performed at Lincoln's Inn Fields on 29 January 1728. According to the actor James Quin its success was in doubt until the audience was won over by Polly's innocent looks in her pathetic air &#145;O ponder well&#146;. On 20 March, after the thirty-sixth night, Gay wrote to Swift:<blockquote>There is a Mezzo-tinto Print publish'd to day of Polly, the Heroine of the Beggar's Opera, who was before unknown, &amp; is now in so high vogue, that I am in doubt, whether her fame does not surpass that of the Opera itself. (<span class="italic">Letters of John Gay</span>, 72&#150;3)</blockquote>Henry Carey agreed:<blockquote>
<div>The Sons of <i>Bayes</i>, in Lyric lays,<br>
</div>
<div>Sound forth her Fame in Print O!<br>
</div>
<div>And, as we pass, in Frame and Glass,<br>
</div>
<div>We see her <i>Mezzo-tint</i>-O!<br>
</div> (Carey, 152)</blockquote>Her &#145;life&#146; was printed, her portrait appeared on screens and fans, a collection of theatrical anecdotes was dedicated to her, supposed letters to her were published, and the prima donnas of the Italian opera were said to be quite eclipsed. Not everything was adulatory. Verses in the <span class="italic">Daily Journal</span> accused her of having a coarse voice and charmless face, and there was much salacious gossip. The poet Edward Young wrote to Thomas Tickell: &#145;Polly a Wench that acts in the Beggars Opera &hellip; 'tis said, has raised her Price from one Guinea to 100, tho she cannot be a greater whore than she was before&#146;  (Tickell, 144&#150;5). But it was sweet, faithful Polly, dressed, as Charles Macklin remembered, with Quaker-like simplicity, who delighted the audiences.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> was performed every night until 7 March, and then twice weekly between the actors' benefits, for which Lavinia Fenton learned several new roles, including Ophelia in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, Betty in Susanna Centlivre's <span class="italic">A Bold Stroke for a Wife</span>, and Marcella (with the mad song &#145;I burn&#146;) in Thomas D'Urfey's <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span>. She appeared in Farquhar's <span class="italic">Love and a Bottle</span> for the benefit of her Macheath, Thomas Walker, performed a skating dance with the dancer Nivelon, and sang a ballad by the bass singer Richard Leveridge. For her own benefit she acted Cherry in <span class="italic">The Stratagem</span>, but the takings were under &pound;100. The <span class="italic">Life</span> claimed that this was because her patrons were offended by pit and boxes being put together and that Rich allowed her <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> as a replacement benefit. The sixty-first night of the opera, on 14 June, was advertised as the last that season, but an extra performance was added on 19 June, when &#145;to the great Surprize of the Audience, the Part of <i>Polly Peachum</i> was performed by Miss WARREN, who was very much applauded; the first Performer being retired, as it is reported, from the Stage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Country Journal</span>, 22 June 1728). Gay sent the news to Swift on 6 July: &#145;The D of Bolton I hear hath run away with Polly Peachum, having settled 400<i>l</i> a year upon her during pleasure, &amp; upon disagreement 200<i>l</i> a year&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Gay</span>, 76).<br>
<br>It is <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21615/', "Charles Powlett (or Paulet), third duke of Bolton (1685&#150;1754)")</script>, who gazes fixedly at Polly in the Hogarth painting of <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> Newgate scene now in the Tate collection. According to Horace Walpole, the duke had been forced by his father to marry an heiress, but she was ugly (&#145;a monster&#146;; Walpole, 2.329), the marriage was probably never consummated, and the couple separated when his father died. Lavinia Fenton seems to have lived happily and discreetly with Bolton, and they had three sons, Charles, Percy, and Horatio Armand, who entered the church, the navy, and the army respectively. The duke was determined to regularize their union immediately his wife died, to the extent of arranging for a clergyman, Joseph Warton, to travel with him and his family on their continental tour in 1751. Warton returned to England before the expected news of the duchess's death arrived, and the marriage was performed on 20 October 1751 at Aix-en-Provence by the hastily summoned chaplain to the British embassy at Turin. Forty years later Warton was to write of Lavinia:<blockquote>She was very accomplished; was a most agreeable companion; had much wit, and strong good sense, and a just taste in polite literature. Her person was agreeable and well-made; though she could not be called a beauty. I have had the pleasure of being at table with her, when her conversation was much admired by the first characters of the age. (<span class="italic">Works of Alexander Pope</span>, 9.100)</blockquote>On Bolton's death in 1754 the title passed to his brother, since his sons were illegitimate, but he bequeathed all he owned to his &#145;dear and well beloved wife&#146;, making her the sole executrix. He died at Tunbridge Wells, and it was a surgeon from that town, George Kelley, whom the dowager duchess made her executor and residuary legatee. Horace Walpole saw her relationship with Kelley as evidence that she had &#145;after a life of merit relapsed into her Pollyhood&#146;  (Walpole, 21.365), but her will makes it clear that her sons were already provided for. She died at her home, Westcombe House, Greenwich, on 24 January 1760 and was buried at St Alfege's Church on 3 February.<br>
