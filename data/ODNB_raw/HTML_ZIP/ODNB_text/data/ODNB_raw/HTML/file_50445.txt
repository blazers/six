<span class="headword">Fothergill,  John Rowland</span>  (1876&#150;1957), <span class="occ">innkeeper and author</span>, was born on 27 February 1876 at Kennington, Ashford, Kent, the only son of George Fothergill and his wife, Isabel Eliza (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Crawshay). He had two sisters. His mother died when he was two days old, and George Fothergill subsequently remarried; there was a son by this second marriage. The Fothergills were a long-established Lakeland gentry family, claiming descent from a Norman baron, and his father was both remote and stern. At the age of eleven Fothergill was sent to Old College in Windermere and endured much humiliation and beating. A year later he entered Bath College and in 1895 went up to St John's College, Oxford, where he stayed only one term, as he failed the preliminary examinations.<br>
<br>It would be fair to describe Fothergill during the next twenty-six years of his life as a dilettante. At Bath College, already a romantically handsome youth, he had some early initiation into homosexuality. As an undergraduate he met Oscar Wilde, and he was to become an intimate of Wilde both before his trial and later in France after Wilde had served his sentence. Fothergill was also closely associated with Robert Ross for a number of years.<br>
<br>After leaving Oxford Fothergill drifted for a number of years without a real vocation though, with the assistance of William Rothenstein, he opened the Carfax Gallery in Oxford in 1898. During a tour of European museums he was impressed by Greek antiquities and &#145;decided to learn about Greek art and to live it&#146;  (Sox, 145). At about this time Fothergill had an affair with a rich young American, Beatrice Romaine Goddard. Torn between homosexual and heterosexual attachments, Fothergill joined Edward Perry Warren's unusual group of bachelor aesthetes known as the Lewes House Brotherhood. He helped collect antiquities for the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, and continued his studies in classical archaeology. Eventually leaving this milieu, Fothergill studied at Leipzig, and then at the Slade School (1905&#150;6), and was drawn into the circle surrounding Augustus John. During this time he was briefly married to Doris Elsa Henning.<br>
<br>In 1922 Fothergill abandoned the life of a dilettante and scholar. Much to the astonishment of those close to him, and at the age of forty-six, he acquired The Spreadeagle in Thame, Oxfordshire, and found his vocation. Also in 1922 he embarked on a lasting and transparently happy marriage to Kate Headley Kirby, who contributed enormously to the running of The Spreadeagle; they had two sons. In his most successful book, <span class="italic">An Innkeeper's Diary</span>, Fothergill wrote cryptically that his background and previous work disqualified him from any of the usual jobs: &#145;I found that I must do something for a living, so I was compelled to take an inn&#146;  (Fothergill, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 1).<br>
<br>Fothergill described himself in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> as an &#145;amateur pioneer innkeeper&#146;. Before the Second World War innkeeping was an outr&eacute; occupation for someone of his background, yet, virtually single-handedly, he made the profession of innkeeping smart as well as respectable. In its heyday during the latter part of the twenties, The Spreadeagle became a haunt for the literary and artistic world, as well as for Oxford dons and well-connected undergraduates. Its patrons included writers such as G. B. Shaw, H. G. Wells, Evelyn Waugh, the Sitwells, and G. K. Chesterton, artists such as Augustus John and Paul Nash, and actors and actresses. Even heads of state such as Field Marshal Smuts were numbered among the guests.<br>
<br>Fothergill possessed many (though by no means all) of the essential attributes of an outstanding innkeeper: he was an excellent chef, a connoisseur of wine (though he drank very little himself), an early campaigner for &#145;real food&#146;, and cared passionately about the quality of the furnishings. Foodstuffs were regularly ordered from Athens, France, Norway, Jaffa, and Italy, and he also sought out the best local produce. Three local bakers produced &#145;three different kinds of bread made from flours that I have forced upon them, besides the breads we make ourselves&#146;, and there was &#145;cheese from East Harptree, salt from Malden, mustard from Leighton Buzzard&#146;  (Fothergill, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 170).<br>
<br>Yet the success of Fothergill's enterprise depended first and foremost on his intriguing, volatile, and provocative personality. He had a clear idea of the kind of clientele he wished to attract, and those whom he cherished felt honoured to be sharing his company. He had little compunction in showing the door to the wrong sort. &#145;I've determined&#146;, Fothergill wrote in his diary, &#145;not only to have proper and properly cooked food but to have only either intelligent, beautiful or well-bred people to eat it&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 Aug 1957). H. G. Wells described Fothergill as &#145;a fantastic innkeeper &hellip; dressed in the suit of bottle-green cloth, with brass buttons and buckled shoes&#146;  (Sox, 161). Harold Acton concurred that:<blockquote>for a quiet dinner there was no alternative but to drive to Thame. At John Fothergill's &hellip; one could be sure of good food and better wine in congenial surroundings with a host whose affability and erudition revived a more liberal age. (ibid., 161)</blockquote>Fothergill was an irresistible raconteur, but if he had lacked the art of telling stories in print it is unlikely that he would still be remembered today. Fortunately, he was persuaded to write <span class="italic">An Innkeeper's Diary</span>, which was an instant best-seller when it was first published in 1931 and has been reprinted many times since as well as being dramatized for both television and radio. Like Flora Thompson's <span class="italic">Lark Rise to Candleford</span> it recalls with uncommon vividness the feel of Oxfordshire life in a former era; both writers convey the moral values that prevailed at their time and in their own social class.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Diary</span> presents an image of its author as irascible, gratuitously offensive, and an outrageous snob. He would refuse to accept guests because he disliked their notepaper or their letter-writing style. On one occasion, he recounts having charged a party who had come in for tea an extra 6<i>d</i>. per head because they were ill-shaped, ugly or ill-dressed&#151;&#145;surely this was a more praiseworthy action than the usual one of charging people extra because they <i>are</i> beautiful, well-bred and dressed&#146;  (Fothergill, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 27). He particularly detested those who came in off the streets and tried to use his lavatories without asking. He would accost these interlopers and demand their addresses&#151;&#145;in case I need a pumpship when I'm passing your home&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Ten years at The Spreadeagle brought Fothergill fame but scarcely fortune. He was a poor businessman, and book royalties could not compensate for hotel losses. He was forced to sell, spent an unsuccessful year at a hotel in Ascot, and in 1934 acquired the Three Swans in Market Harborough, where he stayed until 1952. Fothergill died at St Luke's Hospital, Rugby, on 26 August 1957. While at Market Harborough he had published two more volumes of reminiscences, <span class="italic">Confessions of an Innkeeper</span> in 1938 and <span class="italic">My Three Inns</span> in 1949, but neither had the bite and raciness of <span class="italic">An Innkeeper's Diary</span>. It surpassed them as his best book, a minor classic in the annals of innkeeping.<br>
