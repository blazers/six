<span class="headword">Coryndon, Sir  Robert Thorne</span>  (1870&#150;1925), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born in Queenstown, Cape Colony, on 2 April 1870, one of six children born to Selby Coryndon (1835&#150;1885), a lawyer, and Emily Caldecott (<i>d</i>. 1889), daughter of a Cape politician. He was educated at a number of South African schools, finishing off his secondary school career at Cheltenham College (1884&#150;7), then returning to the Cape to work in the law firm of his uncle Alfred Caldecott. Office routine was too confining for an outdoorsman like Coryndon, and when his mother died in July 1889, he joined the Bechuanaland border police. This &eacute;lite force, recruited from the ranks of well-to-do Cape families&#151;euphemistically known as the &#145;Top Hat Brigade&#146;&#151;signified Coryndon's entry into the imperial world of Cecil Rhodes. He was to become one of Rhodes's &#145;twelve apostles&#146; or &#145;young lambs&#146;.<br>
<br>The British government's reliance on the British South Africa Company to execute its imperial schemes proved critical for Coryndon's future in the colonial service. In 1890, after being transferred to the company's police, Coryndon was a member of the pioneer column to Mashonaland, part of the territory later known as Southern Rhodesia. While the Rhodesian incursion effectively ended his police career, it did not, as with most of the invading force, mean life as a European settler. The twenty-year-old joined the administration instead, soon working as a surveyor and cartographer with the surveyor-general's department in Salisbury. Late in 1892 Coryndon accepted a commission from Lionel Walter Rothschild to collect specimens of flora and fauna, taking leave of absence from his post in the administration. He captured two white rhinoceroses, which were dispatched to the British Museum (Natural History) in Kensington and to Rothschild's museum at Tring. His precise recording of all his kills, and the technically proficient sketches he executed&#151;he is credited with the first ever drawings of the ancient ruins of Zimbabwe&#151;stand in marked contrast to his later lack of attention to bureaucratic procedures as a top-level colonial administrator.<br>
<br>The Rothschild contract was cut short by the Matabele (Ndebele) campaign of 1893; Coryndon joined a volunteer burgher force under Major Forbes. After Lobengula's defeat Coryndon took up big game hunting professionally, and on occasion drove the postal cart from Salisbury to Kimberley. Less than three years had elapsed when the Rhodesian adventurer became involved in the second, more formidable, conflict with the Matabele, who were this time joined by some Shona groups in the 1896&#150;7 uprising. Coryndon was in charge of a party of Beal's scouts but saw action only once before succumbing to pneumonia. While in hospital he learned of the death in the rising of his younger brother John Selby (1877&#150;1896), a trooper with the Salisbury Rifles. Discharged in November 1896, Coryndon took up a position as one of Rhodes's private secretaries, and accompanied his employer to face the hearings on the Jameson raid (1896&#150;7). Rhodes then offered his amanuensis the choice of either managing one of his estates or becoming resident adviser to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75928/', "King Lewanika of Bulozi (Barotseland)")</script>. Coryndon, portentously, chose the latter.<br>
<br>Coryndon's move to Barotseland (North-Western Rhodesia, later part of Northern Rhodesia) marked the beginning of a career spanning almost three decades as an imperial pro-consul. He was the first administrator of Barotseland, which meant negotiating with Lewanika on political authority, instituting a tax regime, and abolishing slavery. He received little guidance from his British South Africa Company overseers; in turn, he was regarded by an official at the South African high commission as &#145;a remote and at times disturbing figure &hellip; no office man&#146;  (Coryndon MSS, Bodl. RH, MSS Afr. s.633 10/1/31&#150;33). It was Coryndon's ability to survive in the bush that had attracted Rhodes. Muscular and 5 feet 9 inches tall, the professional hunter was renowned for his feats of physical strength, including tearing in half a deck of cards with his powerful hands, and for his skills in carpentry and building. The two men were reputed to have met on the postal run to Kimberley, although Rhodes already knew Coryndon as his father's son in &eacute;lite Cape society. Yet they were never really close, and Coryndon's Barotseland experience created a greater distance between them.<br>
<br>In April 1907 Coryndon took up his appointment as resident commissioner of the new protectorate of Swaziland as the direct representative of the British government. He was to remain there until 1916. After many itinerant years in the Rhodesias where, he claimed, &#145;I did not spend three consecutive months in one place&#146; and &#145;with no real foothold&#146; in England, the new resident commissioner regarded Swaziland as &#145;the first real home I have ever had&#146;  (University of Zambia, Coryndon MS 4). It was in 1909, during his Swazi appointment, that he married Phyllis Mary, daughter of James Worthington of Lowestoft, Suffolk, and sister of his Barotseland colleague Frank. They had three sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Coryndon's main duty in the high commission territory was to oversee the land partition between the Swazi and European concessionaires, a partition considered unfavourable by the Swazi royals when it was announced in October 1907. The new resident commissioner, while not responsible for the recommendations of the land commission (1904&#150;7), was responsible for their implementation. For his role, he earned the Swazi nickname Msindazwe (translated as &#145;he who sits heavily upon the land&#146; or &#145;he who exerts tremendous influence over the land&#146;). As in Barotseland, Coryndon was charged with setting up an administrative infrastructure, initiating tax collection and ensuring a smooth relationship with the indigenous authority.<br>
<br>In 1914 Coryndon's Rhodesian experience, along with his immersion in the Swazi land settlement, earned him the chairmanship of the Southern Rhodesian native reserves commission, known as the Coryndon commission. The Colonial Office was anxious for a final settlement of the land question before the anticipated incorporation of the settler territory into the Union of South Africa. The highly controversial Coryndon commission smacked of being a company affair, and the chairman's connections with the British South Africa Company, coupled with the recommendation that African reserves be diminished by over 1 million acres, sparked a torrent of criticism. Yet it was Coryndon's aversion to segregation, stemming from his belief that tribalism was retrogressive, that inspired the commission report, ratified by order in council in 1920.<br>
<br>The Rhodesian inquiry virtually filled the last two years of Coryndon's Swazi appointment. A brief stint as resident commissioner of Basutoland (1916&#150;17) was followed by his first governorship, Uganda (1917&#150;22). In Uganda he complained again about a lack of direction in policy, especially economic policy. The post-war slump virtually wiped out European plantation agriculture, but Coryndon acceded to European demands for political representation and established the first executive and legislative councils (1921). The governor placed his economic faith in Lancashire cotton, encouraging peasant production while simultaneously endeavouring to control the chiefs whom he denigrated as a plutocratic, corrupt class hindering economic progress. Coryndon's reputation as a governor of &#145;Native territories&#146; preceded his appointment to the governorship of Kenya (1922&#150;5), and so he was initially distrusted by the vociferous white settler community&#151;who referred to him as &#145;policeman Bobby Coryndon&#146;&#151;then embroiled in a controversy over Asian political rights. Yet Coryndon's antagonism towards Indians, deriving from his belief that the Asian community blocked African economic progress, and his objections to &#145;tribalism&#146;, coincided with settler aspirations. Indigenous production and settler agriculture both fared well under the governor, although his so-called dual policy (the complementary interests of white and black) has been characterized as a disguise for his support of settler hegemony. The 1923 Devonshire declaration pronouncing African paramountcy ended the Indian crisis but put paid to settler hopes for self-government. Although Coryndon set up local native councils for African regional government (1924), he was commonly regarded as a spokesman for settler interests at the time of his death in Nairobi from acute pancreatitis on 10 February 1925. He was buried the next day at the new cemetery in Nairobi. Lady Coryndon survived him.<br>
<br>Coryndon left little in the way of published works, and certainly no philosophical rationale of colonialism. He was the type who wanted to &#145;get on with the job&#146;, something which has been associated with an imperious, dictatorial manner. He often criticized both the British South Africa Company and the Colonial Office for poor pay and benefits, and for lack of imperial vision. He was made a CMG in 1911 and promoted KCMG in 1919.<br>
