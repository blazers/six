<span class="headword">Mastin,  John</span>  (1747&#150;1829), <span class="occ">topographer</span>, was born on 30 September 1747 in Epperstone, Nottinghamshire, to William Mastin (<i>d</i>. 1779), a freeholder husbandman, and his wife, Ann (<i>c</i>.1721&#150;1792), daughter of John Baguley, of Stoke Bardolph, Nottinghamshire. After education at a dame-school and at establishments at Woodborough and Nottingham, Mastin returned home to Epperstone when about twelve and entered the service of a succession of gentlemen and clergymen. Over the next ten years his self-education continued with his employers' encouragement. He was both competent and energetic, and in his later teenage years was well known locally as a wrestler. About 1771 he obtained his first senior post, as a steward at Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire. In 1772, however, he resigned after eloping to marry the seventeen-year-old Mary Gurney (1754/5&#150;1811), a modestly wealthy minor whose prospects he checked by journeying to London to inspect the will of her deceased father, William Gurney, a freeholder and wheelwright of Rickmansworth.<br>
<br>In 1773 a kinsman offered Mastin a curacy if he could qualify himself, which he did in 1777 after instruction by a clergyman. By the end of the same year he had been appointed to the curacies of Husbands Bosworth, Leicestershire, and of Naseby, Northamptonshire. Ordained priest in 1779, he was appointed sequestrator at Naseby in 1781, the year his seventh and last child was born. He became vicar of Naseby in 1783 and moved there, to the newly refurbished parsonage, in 1787. In 1791, a year after he surrendered his curacy of Husbands Bosworth, he began to write a history of Naseby. At the instigation of George Ashby, the patron of the living, this was published for some 600 subscribers in 1792. Although <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of Naseby</span> was conventionally cumulative, perhaps not least because of the guidance Mastin received from the Leicestershire historian John Nichols, it nevertheless owed much to Mastin's own curiosity, observations, and fieldwork, including archaeological excavation. As well as sections on church and manorial history, soils, fossils, agriculture, and plants it included a lengthy discourse on the battle of 1645, reprinting various primary sources and recording a few local traditions. It was enlivened with biographical sketches of the parish's &#145;ingenious mechanics&#146; such as John Tresler, blacksmith and whitesmith, caster of metals, locksmith, and maker of steel crossbows for shooting rooks with balls. The book was well received, and an offer was made (but declined) to propose Mastin as a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. A second edition, with additions and engravings, was published in 1818.<br>
<br>Mastin remained vicar of Naseby until his death. During that time he served in addition numerous terms as curate or stipendiary priest in nearby parishes. In 1802 he became vicar of Dunton Bassett, Leicestershire, and in 1822 vicar of Cold Ashby, which adjoins Naseby. He was reportedly a formidable figure, &#145;largely formed, but not corpulently covered. His dress was of the old school, black coat and waistcoat and knee breeches with black stockings&#146;  (Foard, 353). Throughout his adult life he also maintained an active interest in farming and land management, and acted both on his own behalf and as agent for others. He submitted several communications to the board of agriculture, from which he received a silver plate in 1801 for an essay, probably on the conversion of grass levels to tillage. In his old age he wrote a manuscript autobiography.<br>
<br>Mastin died aged eighty-one in his daughter's arms at Naseby vicarage on 15 January 1829 after a long decline, and was buried in his own church.<br>
