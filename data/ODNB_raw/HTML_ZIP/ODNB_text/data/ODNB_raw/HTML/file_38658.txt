<span class="headword">Illingworth, Sir  Charles Frederick William</span>  (1899&#150;1991), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born on 8 May 1899 at 33 West View, Halifax, Yorkshire, the only child of John Illingworth, an iron and steel merchant, and his wife, Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Boys. He attended the Heath grammar school, Halifax, until 1915, when he joined the Sea Scouts, taking part in coastguard duties on the Yorkshire coast. Subsequent work in a munitions factory and then as a farm labourer provided more rigorous training and experience, and promoted his physical fitness. In 1916 he began medical studies at the University of Edinburgh. Although completion of his first year entitled him to exemption from military service, he chose to enlist in the Officers' Training Corps and volunteered for the Royal Flying Corps: after training at Farnborough and Oxford, he was based near Amiens, flying Sopwith Camels on sorties over the battle lines. In August 1918 he made a forced landing over enemy lines and was imprisoned in Bavaria, until the imminent end of the war was intimated by a letter from his father, reporting the homecoming of his (non-existent) brother. Illingworth made his way home, arriving on Christmas day. The spirited determination with which he met the challenges of these early experiences was maintained throughout his subsequent career, in which his outstanding achievements were particularly remarkable for a man of small stature and outwardly retiring disposition. However, his devotion to high standards in all his activities, and his insistence on the same qualities in the work of his associates, constituted an inspiring (albeit daunting) example to students and professional colleagues alike.<br>
<br>Illingworth began his delayed medical studies at Edinburgh University, graduating MB ChB in 1922. He gained valuable experience during six months' work at the Royal Infirmary as house surgeon to Sir Edward Stiles, who was famed for his surgical skill.<br>
<br>Following his term as a house physician, at Derbyshire Royal Infirmary, Illingworth returned to Edinburgh, becoming clinical tutor to Sir David Wilkie, a specialist in abdominal surgery. In this post he acquired experience in gastroenterology, a subject in which he retained a practical interest throughout his career. On 12 April 1928 he married Eleanor Mary Bennett (1901/2&#150;1971); they had four sons.<br>
<br>Illingworth's pre-eminence in the practice and teaching of surgery was based on strict adherence to certain principles of technique, which demanded scrupulous attention to economy of manipulation. Accordingly, the conduct of his own surgical operations was deft, rapid, and decisive. His success and reputation were further enhanced by the warm sympathy that he showed in the care of his patients. A model of punctiliousness, he would not tolerate any slackness among his staff.<br>
<br>In 1939 Illingworth was appointed to the regius chair of surgery in Glasgow. Strongly encouraged by the principal, Sir Hector Hetherington, he embarked on major initiatives, in staff appointments and in the establishment of collaborative work, both within the medical school and in association with other departments. These developments were especially admirable in view of the dispersed nature of the various sections of the medical school. Under Illingworth's leadership, the Glasgow school achieved worldwide renown for excellence in the practice and teaching of medicine and surgery, and also in research (which Illingworth did not pursue personally but strongly encouraged). The work of the school entailed substantial collaboration with other departments. Illingworth recognized that such working relationships were to become essential adjuncts to medicine and surgery.<br>
<br>The end of the war made possible major rebuilding, allowing the establishment of a modern surgical research unit, contiguous with the wards, and having first-class facilities. These improvements, together with Illingworth's personal distinction, attracted numerous visiting specialists, including many from the USA. Glasgow also provided professors of surgery for numerous universities in the UK and overseas.<br>
<br>Illingworth was a prolific author. Among his most important and best-selling works were <span class="italic">A Textbook of Surgical Pathology</span> (twelve editions, 1932&#150;79) and the <span class="italic">Short Textbook of Surgery</span> (nine editions, 1938&#150;72). His monograph, <span class="italic">The Story of William Hunter</span> (1967), celebrated the eighteenth-century surgeon noted for his great benefactions to Glasgow University.<br>
<br>Notwithstanding his eminence and high honours, including CBE (1946), knighthood (1961), and appointment as honorary surgeon to the queen (1961&#150;5), Sir Charles retained a characteristic modesty and an inveterate dislike of pretentiousness. As a patient himself, undergoing open-heart surgery at the age of eighty-two, he elected for a bed in a general ward. Dismissive of convalescence, he quickly resumed his leisure pursuit of hill-walking.<br>
<br>Retirement in 1964 gave Sir Charles the opportunity for further enterprises. He appreciated the need to provide for new techniques which were essential for modern medical practice and cognate research. Accordingly, in order to secure additional resources for funding work in the relevant disciplines, Sir Charles persuaded a group of ten distinguished associates and patrons to establish, in 1967, a foundation for the support of research in Scotland in medical and related fields. The name, Tenovus-Scotland, was derived from the similarly sponsored, but more specialized, Tenovus Institute for Cancer Research in Cardiff. Sir Charles's committee ensured that Tenovus-Scotland would be sufficiently endowed to continue its independent support of an increasing variety of projects. Sadly, the founder did not survive long enough to participate in the dinner celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of Tenovus-Scotland.<br>
<br>With indefatigable determination and industry, when approaching ninety, Sir Charles resumed authorship, publishing <span class="italic">There is a History in All Men's Lives</span> (1988), an informal autobiographical memoir, in which his own matchless achievements are given scant attention. He assigned the profits from its sale to Tenovus-Scotland. Charles Illingworth died at 234 Crow Road, Glasgow, on 23 February 1991.<br>
