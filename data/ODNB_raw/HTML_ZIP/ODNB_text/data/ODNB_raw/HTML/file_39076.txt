<span class="headword">Browne,  (Frances Worsley) Stella</span>  (1880&#150;1955), <span class="occ">feminist and abortion law reformer</span>, was born at Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, on 9 May 1880, elder daughter of Daniel Marshall Browne RN (1843&#150;1883) and his second wife, Anna Dulcibella Mary Dodwell (1848&#150;1919). Her father drowned on duty with the Canadian marine when she was three.<br>
<br>Related, through her mother's sister's marriage to Sir Alexander Siemens, to the Anglo-German engineering dynasty, Stella Browne was educated partly in Germany, and at St Felix School, Southwold. She attended Somerville College, Oxford, from 1899 to 1902, achieving second-class honours in modern history. A teaching career ended when her health broke down from strain and privation. From 1907 to 1912 she was librarian at Morley College in south London. From 1912 she seems to have supported herself (rather precariously) by reviewing, journalism, translating, and lecturing, eked out by occasional clerical jobs.<br>
<br>Stella Browne participated in the famous <span class="italic">Freewoman</span> debate of 1912 on chastity and sexual desire in women, and corresponded with Havelock Ellis from 1914 until his death in 1938 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96362', "Freewoman circle")</script>]. She was active in the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology. The papers she gave to the society, entitled &#145;The sexual variety and variability among women and their bearing upon social reconstruction&#146; (1915; published, 1917) and &#145;Studies in female inversion&#146; (1918; published, 1923), emphasized the need for women to speak about their own experiences. In both principle and practice Stella was a convinced believer in free love, known to have had various lovers, certainly some male, and possibly some female, though these cannot be reliably identified. She translated and annotated significant works of continental sexology including Van de Velde's <span class="italic">Ideal Marriage</span> (1928) and <span class="italic">Fertility and Sterility in Marriage</span> (1931), F. Muller-Lyer's <span class="italic">Marriage</span> (1931), and Max Hodann's <span class="italic">History of Modern Morals</span> (1937). She also translated German poetry, including that of Otto Braun (published in an English translation of Braun's <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1924).<br>
<br>Stella Browne's vigorous support for birth control (well predating the First World War) and abortion (her earliest published statement dates from 1915), largely conducted through the auspices of the Malthusian League, was part of a wide-ranging agenda of feminist and socialist reform. She desired to place in women's own hands the means to control their fertility, while also working to relieve the stigma on illegitimacy. In evidence to the interdepartmental (Birkett) committee on abortion in 1937, she courageously revealed that if abortion &#145;was necessarily fatal or injurious, I should not be here before you&#146;  (B. Brookes, <span class="italic">Abortion in England, 1900&#150;1967</span>, 1988, 122).<br>
<br>Stella Browne was also involved with other organizations, including the Women's Social and Political Union, the Divorce Law Reform Union, the No-Conscription Fellowship, the Humanitarian League, and the Federation of Progressive Societies and Individuals. She was an early member of the British Communist Party and was also active in the Chelsea branch of the Labour Party and the Fabian Society. Though often alleged to have been a eugenicist she repeatedly criticized the criteria of &#145;fitness&#146; propounded by the Eugenics Society. However, she did join the society for a short period (1938&#150;42), probably to represent the interests of the Abortion Law Reform Association of which she was a founder (1936).<br>
<br>In her later years, with sight deteriorating and other health problems, Stella Browne lived with her younger sister (Alice) Sylvia Lemira Browne in Liverpool, far from comrades in the struggle. Stella none the less remained actively in touch and constantly wrote to the press to keep alive the issue of legalizing abortion. Her associates regularly described her as &#145;indomitable&#146;.<br>
<br>Stella Browne died from heart disease during the night of 8 May 1955 at her home, 39 Hawarden Avenue, Sefton Park, Liverpool. She was cremated and her ashes scattered on 11 May at Landican cemetery, Birkenhead, where a memorial plaque to her was later erected. The campaigns she fought for seemed at the time to be in eclipse; twelve years later, however, the Abortion Law Reform Association was instrumental in aiding the passage of David Steel's act of 1967, which did not, however, go as far as Stella Browne would have wished in leaving the decision entirely to the woman concerned. Her writings remain of considerable pertinence to feminist debates.<br>
