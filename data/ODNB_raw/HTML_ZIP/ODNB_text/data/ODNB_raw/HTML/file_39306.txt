<span class="headword">Cullen,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1838&#150;1914), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and poet</span>, born at Newport, co. Tipperary, Ireland, was the son of a farmer from Newport. Possibly educated privately and at St Aiden's, he briefly entered Trinity College, Dublin, in July 1867 but did not proceed to a degree. By this time he was already working within the Church of England, holding curacies, possibly at St George's, Wigan, Lancashire (1865&#150;7), and definitely at Knipton (1867&#150;9) and Bottesford (1869&#150;74), both in Leicestershire. While at Knipton he married, on 3 May 1869, German-born Leontine Eugenie Dorndinger 
    (or Derndinger; <i>c</i>.1841&#150;1906)
  , with whom he had three children. In February 1874 he became vicar of Radcliffe-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, a position he held until his death.<br>
<br>Cullen was to have a considerable impact on his new parish. Between 1875 and 1907 he organized some nine religious missions to stimulate belief and increase church attendance. He masterminded the extension of the church, St Mary's, believing it necessary because of a rapid increase in population in the parish. The medieval nave and tower were replaced and the Victorian chancel modified between 1878 and 1883 to the design of Goddard and Paget of Leicester. The tower's unusual saddleback roof was said to be the idea of Cullen's German wife as a reminder of her homeland. In his general parish work he kept careful records, relaid the churchyard, encouraged Sunday-school teaching, and supervised the work of the local day school. In 1882 he unwittingly put Radcliffe-on-Trent at the centre of a public health inquiry. Distressed by presiding over the frequent burials of children during a scarlet fever epidemic, he wrote to the Local Government Board in London requesting action. The subsequent investigation came to the notice of the <span class="italic">Nottingham Journal</span> which waged a long-running campaign against the village, making it notorious during the summer of 1882.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Cullen wrote and translated poetry, mainly from the German. <span class="italic">Horae poeticae</span>, a collection of poems written in his youth, was published in 1869, followed by various poems and idylls from 1882 onwards. In 1886 he received the thanks of Queen Victoria for his work <span class="italic">Queens Regnant</span>. Originally written for recitation at Baltimore Female College in the United States, it was dedicated &#145;To all good women in every land&#146;, was well received by American reviewers, and allegedly earned him the reputation of being a supporter of women's suffrage. <span class="italic">Songs of Consolation</span> appeared in 1893, including a poem dedicated to his brother who had died in 1849. <span class="italic">The River Trent: an Idyll</span> was published in 1899, its eleven poems described in 1941 as &#145;a curious blend of Gray's <span class="italic">Elegy</span>, Tennyson's <span class="italic">In Memoriam</span> and Victorian vicar&#146;. His own <span class="italic">In Memoriam</span> was dedicated to his wife, who died in 1906. Much of his work, including <span class="italic">Ian and Edric</span>, a theological discussion in blank verse, was collected into a 359-page volume, <span class="italic">Poems and Idylls</span>, in 1913.<br>
<br>In 1893 Cullen was awarded an honorary doctorate of divinity by Illinois Wesleyan University. Of &#145;very strong and pronounced views&#146;, he was long remembered as a benevolent, white-bearded figure in a clerical hat, travelling in a wicker-sided trap. He died at the vicarage, Radcliffe-on-Trent, of apoplexy on 6 May 1914 and was buried two days later at Bottesford where he had been curate forty years before.<br>
