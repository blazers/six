<span class="headword">Blagrave,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1688), <span class="occ">musician</span>, was the eldest son of Richard Blagrave (<i>d</i>. 1641) and his third wife, Ann (<i>d</i>. in or after 1672), who were married at Northwood, Isle of Wight, on 19 February 1622. Richard, of Berkshire ancestry, was a musician at the court of Charles I; Ann was the daughter of a court musician, Thomas Mason, and sister of another, John Mason (whose will mentions members of the Blagrave family, as does that of the musician John Goodwin). Thomas Blagrave deputized for the sackbut player Edward Bassano from December 1637, and in the next year was admitted to the hautboy and sackbut ensemble to assist his father, on whose death in 1641 he inherited a full post. On 14 October 1645 he married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1689), the daughter of Thomas Clarevell (or Clarvox) of Parson's Green, Middlesex, at St Margaret's, Westminster; the marriage was apparently childless.<br>
<br>A signet warrant of July 1681 describes Blagrave as &#145;a great sufferer for loyalty in the late rebellion&#146;, but he nevertheless became one of Cromwell's musicians. At some stage he shared with the older Henry Purcell the bass role of Mustapha in William D'Avenant's <span class="italic">The Siege of Rhodes</span>, though variant cast lists throw doubt on statements that he participated in the original production of 1656. Pepys became friendly with Blagrave, and on 18 March 1660 recorded giving him a lute &#145;two years ago&#146; in return for a note for 40<i>s</i>. On 21 June 1660 Pepys had a flageolet lesson from Blagrave, and he afterwards mentioned him several times.<br>
<br>Following the Restoration Blagrave was sworn in as a court violinist (18 June 1660), and he thereafter played in the king's band of violins. He was also made a gentleman of the Chapel Royal, of which he was to be chosen clerk of the cheque in 1682. Although he was at Windsor as a wind player on 17 April 1661, it was not until 3 August that year that he regained the place he held before the civil wars.<br>
<br>On 20 April 1662 Pepys visited Blagrave at &#145;his old house in the Fishyard&#146;; this was in St Margaret's Lane, Westminster, where he lived for the rest of his life (although a poll tax return for 1664 places him on the north side of the Strand). In August 1664 Blagrave became a lay clerk of Westminster Abbey; there in 1666 he succeeded Christopher Gibbons as master of the choristers, a post which he yielded up in 1670 (the accounts assign both events to March, but this may be a bookkeeping convenience). Pepys clearly had Blagrave's several posts in mind when, on 20 May 1666, he described him as &#145;a sober politique man, that gets money and increase of places&#146;.<br>
<br>At Windsor in 1674 Blagrave sang as a countertenor, though at the coronation of James II, in 1685, he sang as a bass. The new reign brought a review of posts, leaving Blagrave with only his place in the chapel. He made his will on 14 May 1686, but lived until 21 November 1688 (he is presumed to have died at Westminster) and was buried in the north cloister of Westminster Abbey three days later; he made small bequests to members of his family, and left a house and land at Teddington, Middlesex, to his wife. She made her will on 5 February 1689, and was buried next to him on 12 October 1689.<br>
<br>Pepys's good opinion of Blagrave was shared by Anthony Wood, who wrote that he was &#145;a gentile and honest man&#146;. His song &#145;What conscience say it is in thee&#146; appears in <span class="italic">Select Ayres and Dialogues</span> (1669); another song, the short but appealing &#145;What means this strangeness&#146;, survives in manuscript.<br>
