<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sampson,  Anthony Terrell Seward</span>  (1926&#150;2004), <span class="occ">journalist and author</span>, was born at 19 Mill Lane, Billingham-on-Tees, co. Durham, on 3 August 1926, the only son of Michael Trevisky Sampson, chief scientist at the ICI ammonia works in Billingham, and his wife, Phyllis, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Seward. His mother came from the world of the Cambridge intelligentsia and, with her three sisters, was devoted to their father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36026/', "Sir Albert Seward")</script>, a professor of geology. The family had friends among the Darwins, Huxleys, Barlows, and Keyneses. When Sampson was still young the family moved to Hampstead, where he went to The Hall preparatory school. From there he won a scholarship to Westminster School, then evacuated to the Herefordshire countryside in the village of Whitbourne. Like his parents he was clever, and he became a brilliant mathematician and secretary of the college political and literary societies, but he found human relations less easy. With two others&#151;one later the chief engineering designer of Concorde&#151;he formed Les Trois Cyniques, a college group intent on the downfall of law and order, which eventually languished through lack of support. After school he joined the Royal Navy and served as a sub-lieutenant at the German naval base at Cuxhaven. Ashamed of the way the British armed forces treated their former enemies, he returned to England and won a scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford, where he studied the minor Elizabethan dramatists and drank heavily with others who returned to complete their tertiary education after the war. He graduated with a second-class degree in English in 1950 but failed to work out a way of life after university until one evening he found himself at the Oxford Playhouse sitting next to Jim Bailey, son of the South African diamond magnate Sir Abe Bailey, who shortly afterwards offered Sampson a job editing his newly acquired pictorial magazine for non-whites in South Africa, <span class="italic">Drum</span>.<br>
<br>Sampson's early years lived out in the ghetto slums of Johannesburg not only brought him to new life but informed all his subsequent political and socio-political convictions. They proved to be the making of him. A few weeks before his death he wrote &#145;I always felt pulled between two sides of the world: north and south, finite and infinite, organised and disorganised, wondering where I belonged&#146;  (memoir). <span class="italic">Drum</span> was not overtly or primarily political but the wild, untrained black reporters employed by Sampson knew well at first hand and then detailed in jazzy prose many of the horrors, for non-whites, of life in apartheid South Africa. From them their young editor learned of the demeaning effect of segregated education, and lack of amenities and social services, on those forced to live in the squalor of the shanty town settlements. In 1955 he returned to England and wrote his first book, <span class="italic">Drum, a Venture into the New Africa</span> (1956). In a rare moment of introspection he wrote: &#145;Europe was translated into Africa. Every movement, every look, had the touch and feel of Africa. As I walked across the room in my European way, I felt like a corpse striding out from the grave&#146;  (<span class="italic">Drum</span>, 147). And later he wrote &#145;I felt more at ease in that slum that I had ever felt among white comforts, as the small room expanded with the warmth and vigour of talk, music and brandy&#146;  (memoir).<br>
<br>On his return to England Sampson had joined the <span class="italic">Observer</span> team under David Astor's editorship. Astor was particularly good at drawing out the best in his often prickly staff and he and Sampson remained lifelong friends. There he might have polished his skills as a tabloid editor&#151;colour supplements were by then on the horizon&#151;but chose instead to become Pendennis, author of a column about personalities. He found businessmen more interesting than political and literary figures: a financier like George Soros appealed to him more than heads of Oxbridge colleges and other establishment mandarins. Later he concentrated on business affairs under the <i>nom de plume</i> Mammon.<br>
<br>Sampson wrote three further books about South Africa before turning to his <span class="italic">Anatomy of Britain</span>. He wrote later:<blockquote>I had to write my <span class="italic">Anatomy</span> at speed, to capture the mood of the whole country at a single moment: 250,000 words in 15 months &hellip; As I wandered through the maze of power I felt disoriented and more isolated, like a ball-bearing which had become loose, tossed up and down by smooth-turning cogs. As I finished the book I was more exhilarated with adrenalin, but I felt I was preparing a bomb which could go off anywhere&#151;probably in my face. (memoir)</blockquote>His publishers, Hodder and Stoughton, published it with equal speed in July 1962. (On its publication Sampson fled to South Africa to renew old friendships in the wake of the Sharpeville crisis.) He had intended his <span class="italic">Anatomy</span> to be useful to school-leavers and young graduates who wanted to understand the country they had grown up in, and shoals of these used it as a crib in their exams, while young socialists saw it as a dissection of the ruling class and young conservative careerists used it as a route map to the top. But it was also taken seriously in academia. From the corridors of power to smoke-filled conference rooms, from vice-chancellors to trade union bosses and heads of the armed forces, Sampson anatomized how Britain really worked, where power really lay, &#145;who runs this place&#146;. The public's imagination was caught by the diagrams of interlocking focal centres representing the civil service, insurance, industry, scientists, trade unions, diplomats, and parliament. Financiers, the Treasury, and committees were double-ringed.<br>
<br>Sampson never rested. Alongside his <span class="italic">Observer</span> columns, and often refreshed by them with new evidence and new themes, he updated his first <span class="italic">Anatomy</span> with <span class="italic">Anatomy of Britain Today</span> (1965), <span class="italic">The New Anatomy of Britain</span> (1971), <span class="italic">The Changing Anatomy of Britain</span> (1982), and <span class="italic">The Essential Anatomy of Britain</span> (1992), following the same apparently affable but increasingly barbed concentration on the powerful in public life, fleshed out with acute personal observation, homework done, up-to-the-minute, and, given his method of conducting his own research with the help of two or three devoted assistants, surprisingly accurate. Through all the brouhaha that followed the publication of the first <span class="italic">Anatomy</span> he found at <span class="italic">The Observer</span> the intellectual stimulus and camaraderie that had been so lacking for him at Oxford. He remained deeply attached to <span class="italic">The Observer's</span> outlook on life, which reflected his own.<br>
<br>During his early adulthood Sampson's personal life elided without remainder into his research and writing. Increasingly this took a toll on him and not long after the publication of his first <span class="italic">Anatomy</span> he suffered a nervous breakdown, induced by a confrontation with his &#145;hidden daemons&#146;. (His subsequent treatment by a psychotherapist, including hallucinations and a &#145;return to the womb&#146;, fired by LSD, he described vividly but with characteristic detachment in his unpublished memoir.) Though the list of successful and valuable books he wrote extended significantly after the first <span class="italic">Anatomy</span>, it was not until he married the beautiful and clever Sally Virginia Bentlif, who worked for his literary agent A. D. Peters, on 31 May 1965 that he became even mildly domesticated. She was the daughter of Philip Graeme Bentlif, medical practitioner, and twelve years younger than Sampson. He had bought a substantial London house and a weekend cottage at Walberswick where he sailed the Suffolk coast and estuaries as he had done as a boy, and he and Sally were soon proud parents, of Katie and Paul.<br>
<br>In 1968 Sampson published <span class="italic">The New Europeans: a Guide to the Workings, Institutions and Character of Contemporary Western Europe</span>, reflecting his new interest in the possibilities of closer European integration through his work with and for one of its most distinguished proponents, Jean Monnet. Eight other major projects followed: in 1973 <span class="italic">The Sovereign State: the Secret History of ITT</span> (on telephonic communication, which won the Prix Internationale de la Presse in Nice a year later); in 1975 <span class="italic">The Seven Sisters: the Great Oil Companies and World they Made</span>; in 1977 <span class="italic">The Arms Bazaar: the Dealers, the Bribes, from Vickers to Lockhead</span>; in 1981 <span class="italic">The Money Lenders: Bankers in a Dangerous World</span>; in 1984 <span class="italic">Empires of the Sky: the Politics, Context and Cartels of World Airlines</span>; in 1987 <span class="italic">Black and Gold: Tycoons, Revolutionaries and Apartheid</span> (on mining), for which he was banned from returning to South Africa until 1990; in 1989 <span class="italic">The Midas Touch: Money, People and Power from East to West</span> (on international finance); and in 1995 <span class="italic">Company Man: the Rise and Fall of Corporate Life</span> (on multinational corporations). He also co-edited with his wife <span class="italic">The Oxford Book of Ages</span> (1985), on the seven stages of human life, and presented the widely acclaimed television series <span class="italic">The Midas Touch</span> on the new plutocrats in 1990. He was an excellent television presenter, with a pleasant but not bland persona, and with considerable wit and a ready tongue as well as a good memory. For most of this phase of his working life he did almost all the work of research and writing himself, only latterly letting someone else type the final draft. One of his favourites among his books was <span class="italic">The Scholar Gypsy: the Quest for a Family Secret</span> (1997), about the double life of his grandfather, the librarian of Liverpool University and a philologist, who became drawn into the world of a gypsy family in north Wales, married bigamously, and produced an illegitimate daughter whom none of his first family was supposed to talk about. His grandson unearthed the whole story and bought a flat in Edinburgh for the strong-minded Scottish teacher, his newly acquired aunt, in her old age.<br>
<br>In 1988 Sampson suffered a heart attack and underwent surgery in the United States for a quadruple bypass, about which he wrote movingly and stylishly. He made a full recovery and developed a flair for writing on offbeat subjects in his column. In 1999 he published the authorized biography of Nelson Mandela, which brought him international acclaim, a permanent place in the African National Congress's hall of fame, and many prizes including, posthumously, the order of the companions of honour of O. R. Tambo in silver for his contribution to South African journalism and to the ideals of freedom and justice. He and Mandela had been friends from the time Sampson attended the treason trials and helped the future head of state write the speech he made from the dock before the sentence of life imprisonment was passed on him. After publication Sampson and his wife were frequent visitors to the ageing former president. The biography was a masterly achievement, balanced and moving, thorough yet readable, critical at times but in every way worthy of the great man who was his subject. Due to the amount of research and interviewing required, more helpers (some of whom under his guidance went on to make good careers as journalists and editors) were recruited, and Sampson's Ladbroke Grove home became a centre of the anti-apartheid movement with such figures as Walter Sisulu and Oliver Tambo visiting regularly.<br>
<br>Sampson was associate professor at the University of Vincennes, Paris, in 1968&#150;70, contributing editor to <span class="italic">Newsweek</span> from 1977, editorial consultant to the Brandt commission in 1978&#150;9 (a connection of which he was especially and rightly proud), chairman of the Society of Authors from 1992 to 1994, a trustee of the Scott Trust (owners of <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> and <span class="italic">The Observer</span>) from 1993 to 1996, and from 1995 to his death a member of the international advisory board of Independent Newspapers (South Africa). He also contributed to one of France's leading politico-cultural periodicals, and visited that country regularly. He briefly entered the political scene as a founder member of the Social Democratic Party in 1982; he stayed aloof from the inevitable jockeying for position, though he remained a close friend of Shirley Williams.<br>
<br>His achievements aside, Sampson's personality was remarkable. His capacity for friendship with the young as well as his contemporaries increased as he grew older. Indeed in later life he became affable and clubbable, joining the Beefsteak and Groucho clubs, though he retained to the end his air of amused detachment, regarding his companions as fellow-conspirators in a not entirely friendly world. His death on 18 December 2004 at Quarry Garden, Wardour, Tisbury, Wiltshire, of heart failure, though not entirely unexpected, was a shock to his many friends. He was survived by his wife, Sally, and their two children.<br>
