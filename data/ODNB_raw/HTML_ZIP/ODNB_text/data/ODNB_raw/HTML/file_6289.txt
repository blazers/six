<span class="headword">Corbet,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1619, <em>d.</em> 1680), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was baptized on 14 February 1619 at Holy Trinity, Gloucester, the son of Roger Corbet, a shoemaker of Gloucester. He matriculated from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, in 1636 and graduated BA on 5 July 1639 (in 1658 he supplicated for the degree of BD). In 1640 he was appointed rector of St Mary de Crypt, Gloucester, and he was for two years (1641&#150;3) usher at the attached grammar school, of which his undergraduate contemporary at Magdalen Hall, John Biddle, afterwards imprisoned for his anti-trinitarianism, was then master. When Gloucester was garrisoned by the parliamentarian army Corbet was appointed chaplain to the governor, Colonel Edward Massey. &#145;Out of abundant respect to my deare native place&#146; and because &#145;the Action of these times transcends the Barons Warres, and those tedious discords between the House of <i>Yorke</i> and <i>Lancaster</i>&#146;, in 1645 he published <span class="italic">A historicall relation of the military government of Gloucester: from the beginning of the civill warre betweene king and parliament, to the removall of Colonell Massie</span>  (sig. A2<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>On 15 December 1646 Corbet became curate of St James's, Duke's Place, London, but he had given up this post by November 1647. After staying briefly in Bridgwater, Somerset, he was appointed preacher at Chichester Cathedral, Sussex, on 19 September 1648. On 7 May 1656 he became rector of Bramshott, Hampshire. In 1654 he was appointed an assistant to the Sussex commission for approbation of public preachers (or triers), and in 1658 to the Hampshire commission.<br>
<br>Following the Restoration, in <span class="italic">The Interest of England in the Matter of Religion</span> (1660) Corbet argued that &#145;the Upholding of both Parties by a just and equal Accommodation&#146; is &#145;more desireable, and more agreeable to the State of <i>England</i>, then the absolute Exalting&#146; of either the presbyterians or the episcopalians  (title-page). In his reply, <span class="italic">Interest Mistaken, or, The Holy Cheat</span> (1661), Roger L'Estrange denounced presbyterianism as a seditious movement acting under &#145;the Masque of Religion&#146;  (title-page). It was this opinion which prevailed, and following the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> in 1662 Corbet gave up a stipend of &pound;200 per annum and left the established church &#145;to keep the Peace of his Conscience&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 3.96, para. 206/1).<br>
<br>Following his ejection Corbet moved to London and &#145;lived privately, taking no employment till his first wife died&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.1265); of this first marriage, nothing is known. He then lived in the house of John Micklethwaite, a future president of the College of Physicians knighted in 1681, serving him as chaplain. In 1664 Corbet was reported to be preaching in Ironmongers Lane and at the Seven Stars, Ludgate Hill. In 1668 he was nominated by Thomas Manton &#145;in the roome of Mr. [William] Jenkyns&#146; as a delegate in discussions concerning comprehension of nonconformists within the established church  (Keeble and Nuttall, letter 760). In the episcopal returns of 1669 he was reported to be preaching at Fernhurst, Sussex, and at Chipping Barnet, Hertfordshire. About this time he married his second wife, Frances (<i>d</i>. in or after 1685), a daughter of William Twisse, prolocutor of the Westminster assembly, and he joined the household of Alderman Webb, of Totteridge, Hertfordshire, as his chaplain.<br>
<br>It may have been Corbet's presence in Totteridge which led Richard Baxter to choose it as his place of residence in the autumn of 1669 following his release from prison that summer. He had first met Corbet in 1642 when he took refuge in Gloucester for three months, and the two became lifelong friends who never had &#145;one displeasing word&#146;  (Baxter, <span class="italic">Sermon</span>, 27). When, in June 1670, Baxter and his wife, Margaret, took their second, larger, house in Totteridge, Corbet and his wife, Frances, moved in with them, and the two wives became as closely attached as their husbands.<br>
<br>Corbet left Totteridge early in 1672 when the declaration of indulgence offered the chance for renewed public ministry. &#145;His old flock at <i>Chichester</i>&#146; invited him to return  (Baxter, <span class="italic">Sermon</span>, 28) and he was licensed there as a presbyterian on 1 May 1672. At some point thereafter he engaged in oral disputation with Peter Gunning, then bishop of Chichester, at which Gunning inveighed against nonconformists as seditious schismatics, without allowing Corbet the right of reply, to the subsequent disapproval of John Tillotson, afterwards archbishop of Canterbury. In a letter to Gunning of 11 December 1679, Baxter recommended to the bishop <span class="italic">The Kingdom of God among Men</span> (1671) by &#145;your old troubled Neighbour Mr. <i>Jo. Corbet</i>&#146;, if Gunning would &#145;better understand us&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, letter 1037).<br>
<br>Corbet, like Baxter, was committed to moderation in ecclesiastical affairs and to the incorporation of nonconformity within the established church. He consistently argued that the unity of the catholic Christian church lies in its confession of faith, not in any &#145;one ritual or set Form of Sacred Office, one policy or model of Rules and Orders&#146;, on which the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> is silent  (<span class="italic">Point of Church-Unity</span>, 20). In his published works he wrote as one &#145;not eager for any Party, &hellip; with charity towards real Christians of all Parties&#146;, taking up Baxter's phrase &#145;meer Christianity&#146; to define this interdenominational faith  (<span class="italic">Kingdom of God</span>, sigs. A3&#150;A3<i>v</i>, A4). In his prefatory epistle to Corbet's posthumous <span class="italic">An account given of the principles &amp; practices of several nonconformists. Wherein it appears that their religion is no other than what is profest in the Church of England</span> (1682) Baxter, noting &#145;the agreement of all here written &hellip; with what I have Published&#146;, added &#145;But as we were of one Mind and Heart, our agreement is no wonder&#146;  (sig. A2). The <span class="italic">Account</span> is a classic defence of the nonconformists' faith as conscientious and practical protestantism, of &#145;healing principles&#146; and the same &#145;Catholick Spirit&#146; as the established church  (Corbet, <span class="italic">Account</span>, 23), against caricatures of it as &#145;a mixture of folly and villany &hellip; turbulent and seditious&#146;  (ibid., 1). Like Corbet's anonymous <span class="italic">Discourse of the Religion of England</span> (1667) and <span class="italic">The Point of Church-Unity and Schism Discuss'd</span> (1679), and the tracts in his <span class="italic">Remains</span> (1684), the <span class="italic">Account</span> is marked by succinctness, lucidity, and accessibility. Baxter, both more prolix and more contentious than Corbet, so valued him as &#145;one of the most Calm, as well as Judicious Nonconformists&#146; that he submitted the manuscript of his <span class="italic">Cure of Church Divisions</span> (1670) to him before publication &#145;and altered every Word that he wished to be altered&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 3.72, para. 155). Corbet encouraged Baxter in the composition of his eirenical <span class="italic">Catholick Theologie</span> (1675), and Baxter consulted him in the course of negotiations with Tillotson and Edward Stillingfleet in 1675. He described Corbet as &#145;a Man of extraordinary Judgment, stayedness, moderation, peaceable Principles, and blameless Life, a solid Preacher, well known by his Writings&#146;  (ibid., 3.96, para. 206 (1)). These writings included the first volume of John Rushworth's <span class="italic">Historical Collections</span> (1659), which was &#145;much of his Composure&#146;  (ibid.), and later his <span class="italic">Self-Imployment in Secret</span> (1681), prefaced by John Howe, a collection of Corbet's private meditative and introspective papers, frequently reprinted. Calamy is a partial witness, but his testimony to Corbet is quite exceptional among his accounts of the ejected nonconformist ministers: &#145;A great Man every way&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.333).<br>
<br>Corbet made his will in Chichester on 30 January 1679. It mentions property in Chichester and elsewhere in Sussex, and refers to his wife, Frances, his sons John and Samuel, his daughter Susannah, his brother Arthur, and his sister Jane Thomas. Corbet was &#145;many Years afflicted &hellip; with the Stone, which at last was his death&#146; on 26 December 1680, probably in London  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.335). He was buried in St Andrew's, Holborn, London, on 31 December, Baxter preaching the funeral sermon. Following his death his &#145;Exemplary Wife&#146; lived with Richard and Margaret Baxter as Margaret's companion until the latter's death in June 1681  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 3.189, para. 66). In a letter to Richard Baxter of 1 November 1685 Frances Corbet writes that she often thinks to herself &#145;if it were now with me, as it was in times past, how glad I should be&#146;, and she looks forward to &#145;a safe, and a comfortable death&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, letter 1154).<br>
