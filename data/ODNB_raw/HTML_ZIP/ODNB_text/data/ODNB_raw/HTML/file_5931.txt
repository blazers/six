<span class="headword">Collingwood,  George</span>  (<em>c.</em>1679&#150;1716), <span class="occ">Jacobite insurgent</span>, was born in Eslington, Northumberland, the eldest son of William Collingwood (<i>c</i>.1654&#150;1715), gentleman, and Mary (<i>b</i>. 1659), daughter of Sir Richard Forster of Stokesley, second baronet. He held estates at Eslington worth approximately &pound;900 per annum. The family were staunch Roman Catholics and maintained a Jesuit priest at Eslington. One contemporary described George as &#145;a very pious gentleman and well-beloved in his country&#146;  (Patten, 141); his brother Thomas became a Jesuit priest and served as chaplain to the Selby family of Biddlestone, Northumberland. In 1710 George married the Hon. Catherine Browne (1684/5&#150;1776), daughter of Henry Browne, fifth Viscount Montague (marriage bond 3 June 1710). Catherine was a fellow Roman Catholic, and her father had served as secretary of state to James II in exile. They had three daughters: Isabella (<i>b</i>. 1711), Barbara (<i>b</i>. 1712), and Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1761).<br>
<br>George Collingwood took part in the Jacobite rising of 1715, joining the Northumbrian forces raised by the earl of Derwentwater. It was said that he joined only at his wife's insistence; however it is known from his correspondence that he was in close social contact with other Catholic gentry of the north-east who also rallied to the Jacobite cause. He joined the march to Preston, where he was taken prisoner. He was among the gentry prisoners ordered to be taken to London for trial. Once in the capital he would probably have faced a couple of years in gaol before being released under the general pardon of 1717. Like the majority of the Northumbrian gentry Jacobite insurgents he would have forfeited his estates but not his life. However at Wigan he had an attack of gout and, unable to travel to London, was transferred instead to Liverpool. In the north-west the government wished to prevent any further disturbances and acted swiftly and uncompromisingly against the dissidents. George Collingwood was tried on 9 February 1716. According to Lady Cowper, his wife wrote to a friend in London for assistance but received the following reply: &#145;I think you are mad when you talk of saving your Husband's Life. Don't you know you will have five hundred Pounds a Year Jointure if he's hanged, and that you won't have a Groat if he's saved?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 78). No reprieve was forthcoming, and on 25 February 1716, aged about thirty-seven, George Collingwood was hanged, drawn, and quartered at Liverpool. His estate at Eslington was forfeited and sold to the Liddell family of Ravensworth, co. Durham.<br>
