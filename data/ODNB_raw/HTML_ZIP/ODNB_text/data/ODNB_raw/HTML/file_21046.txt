<span class="headword">Oxberry,  William Henry</span>  (1808&#150;1852), <span class="occ">actor</span>, the son of the actor and theatrical writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21045/', "William Oxberry (1784&#150;1824)")</script> and his wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hewitt, was born on 21 April 1808, probably in London. He received his preliminary education at Merchant Taylors' School, London, which he entered in September 1816. At a school in Kentish Town, kept by a Mr Patterson, he received some training in acting. On leaving there his education was continued under John Clarke, the author of <span class="italic">Ravenna</span>, and Revd R. Nixon. First placed in his father's printing office, he became afterwards, like him, &#145;the pupil of an eminent artist&#146;. He was then apprenticed to Septimus Wray, a surgeon of Salisbury Square, Fleet Street, where he remained until his father's death in 1824.<br>
<br>About the beginning of 1825 Oxberry appeared at a private theatre in Rawstorne Street, London, as Abel Day to the Captain Careless of Frank Matthews. After playing Tommy in <span class="italic">All at Coventry</span>, he made his first professional appearance at the Olympic at a benefit for his stepfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23245/', "Leman Thomas Rede")</script>, on 17 March 1825, as Sam Swipes in <span class="italic">Exchange No Robbery</span>. He was then employed by Leigh Hunt of <span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, but soon returned to the stage, and played in Chelmsford, Hythe, Manchester, and Sheffield before joining Hammond's company at York and Hull. In the autumn of 1832 he acted at the Strand in Rede's <span class="italic">Loves of the Angels</span>. At the close of the season he went with Harriet Smithson to Paris and played low-comedy parts at the Italian Opera.<br>
<br>After returning to England, Oxberry accepted a four-year engagement at the English Opera House (Lyceum), of which, with disastrous effect upon his fortunes, he became manager. He was then at the Princess's. In autumn 1841 he succeeded Robert Keeley at Covent Garden and played Flute in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>. In 1842 he was again at the Lyceum, where he appeared principally in burlesque and won a reputation as a comic dancer. The occasional parts he took in farce included his repeatedly revived Victim in John Oxenford's <span class="italic">My Fellow Clerk</span> and Mizzle in the same author's <span class="italic">A Day Well Spent</span>. In January 1843 he was at the Princess's playing the hero, a jealous husband, of <span class="italic">A Lost Letter</span>. In June he was a ridiculous old schoolmaster in John Poole's drama <span class="italic">The Swedish Ferryman</span>, and in September, with Edward Wright and Paul Bedford, was at the Strand playing in <span class="italic">Bombastes furioso</span> and <span class="italic">The Three Graces</span>. On returning to the Princess's Oxberry appeared with the Keeleys and Walter Lacy in W. T. Moncrieff's farce <span class="italic">Borrowing a Husband</span>, and in 1844 was Wamba in the opera of <span class="italic">The Maid of Judah</span>, a version of <span class="italic">Ivanhoe</span>. In February 1845 he was Sir Harry in James Townley's <span class="italic">High Life below Stairs</span>, and in April, Verges to Miss Cushman's Beatrice. In July he was the original Mrs Caudle to the Mr Caudle of Henry Compton in <span class="italic">Mr and Mrs Caudle</span>. He was also at Covent Garden under the management of Madame Vestris. There were few theatres at which he was not seen, and for a time he managed the Windsor theatre.<br>
<br>A very little man, with a quaint, peculiar manner and a thin voice, Oxberry was a lively actor and dancer in burlesque, but was said rarely to know his part on first nights. He was a member of the Dramatic Authors' Society, and a somewhat voluminous dramatist. His plays have never been collected, and many of them were never printed. Nicoll lists twenty-two, of which the melodrama <span class="italic">Matteo Falcone</span> (performed at the Lyceum in June 1836) and the farce <span class="italic">The Pacha's Pets</span> (Royal Victoria, September 1838) are perhaps the most noteworthy. Oxberry himself claimed to have left behind thirty unacted plays, which he trusted would be given after his death for the benefit of his second wife (his first wife, Ellen Lancaster, had died in 1842) and three children, otherwise unprovided for. He was responsible for <span class="italic">Oxberry's Weekly Budget of Plays</span> (1843&#150;4), consisting of thirty-nine plays edited by him, and <span class="italic">Oxberry's Dramatic Chronology</span> (1850). Up to his death he was, with Charles Mathews and Madame Vestris, playing in <span class="italic">The Game of Speculation</span> and <span class="italic">The Prince of Happy Land</span>. His death, through lung disease, augmented by somewhat festive habits, took place on 29 February 1852. By a curious and painful will, printed in <span class="italic">The Era</span> for 21 March 1852, and written four days before he died, he left such property as he possessed to Charles Melville, a tragic actor better known outside London, in trust for his children. He expressed many wishes concerning his funeral which were not observed; asked that his heart might be preserved in some medical museum as a specimen of a broken one; hoped that a benefit might be given him to pay his debts, which were moderate; and left messages of farewell to many well-known actors.<br>
