<span class="headword">Banks,  George Linnaeus</span>  (1821&#150;1881), <span class="occ">author and journalist</span>, was born at the Bull Ring, Birmingham, on 2 March 1821, and baptized at Cherry Street Wesleyan Methodist chapel, Birmingham, the son of John Banks, a seedsman, and his wife, Sarah. The father was an inflexible Methodist; he once took a copy of <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> from his son and thrust it into the fire. When a boy George was totally blind for seven months, and was eventually cured by a quack, who applied leeches to the soles of his feet. He was sent to work for an engraver, but his eyes proved too weak for this work; afterwards he went to a modeller, then, neglected by his father, bound himself apprentice to a cabinet-maker. His master's business failed, and Banks became, at the age of seventeen or eighteen, a contributor to newspapers and magazines, an amateur actor, and orator. He had a remarkable faculty for silhouette portraiture. He was an active radical, and from December 1846 a popular lecturer. One of his lyrics, &#145;What I Live For&#146;, was frequently quoted by platform and pulpit orators; it is believed that it first appeared in a Liverpool newspaper. He wrote a number of plays, though some attributions of his authorship are doubtful: he was said to have written <span class="italic">The Slave King</span> for the African-American actor Ira Aldridge, and <span class="italic">The Swiss Father</span>, performed in Liverpool, in which William Creswick took the leading part. In both instances, however, earlier versions of the plays had been performed, almost certainly the work of other authors. His songs, especially &#145;The Minstrel King&#146; and &#145;Warwickshire Will&#146;, were long popular. The song &#145;Dandy Jim of Caroline&#146;, sometimes attributed to him, is more probably attributable to Henry Russell.<br>
<br>On 27 December 1846 Banks married Isabella [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1296/', "Banks, Isabella Varley (1821&#150;1897)")</script>], daughter of James Varley, a chemist, of Manchester; she was the author of a volume of poetry, <span class="italic">Ivy Leaves</span>, and several novels. They had eight children. Between 1848 and 1864 Banks was editor of the <span class="italic">Harrogate Advertiser</span>, <span class="italic">Birmingham Mercury</span>, <span class="italic">Dublin Daily Express</span>, <span class="italic">Durham Chronicle</span>, <span class="italic">Sussex Mercury</span>, and <span class="italic">Windsor Royal Standard</span>. For a time he had some share, along with William Sawyer, in the <span class="italic">Brighton Excursionist</span>. Several volumes of his poetry were published, including <span class="italic">Daisies in the Grass</span> (1865), which contained work by himself and his wife, and he also took part in the Shakespeare tercentenary. His increasing alcoholism and depression led to financial problems, and latterly his wife's writing supported the family. He destroyed most of his papers, thus frustrating his wife's intention of writing his biography. A characteristic Victorian autodidact, who flourished in the world of the radical intelligentsia, he died of cancer of the penis and pneumonia on 3 May 1881 in Dalston, London, and was buried at Abney Park cemetery; his wife survived him.<br>
