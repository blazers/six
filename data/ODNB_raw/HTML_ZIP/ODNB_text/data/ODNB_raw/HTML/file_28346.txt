<span class="headword">Vogel, Sir  Julius</span>  (1835&#150;1899), <span class="occ">premier of New Zealand</span>, was born on 24 February 1835 in London, the second of three children and the elder son of Albert Leopold Vogel, a Dutch Christian, and his wife, Phoebe, the daughter of Alexander and Sophia Isaac. His mother's Jewish merchant family had lived in England from at least the mid-eighteenth century. His father was estranged from the family after the birth of the third child, and, after his younger brother died in 1841, he moved with his mother and his sister, Frances, into the large, comfortable Isaac home in New Cross Road, south London. His education was typical of the commercial middle class. Until the age of eleven he was taught by governesses at home. This was followed by a year at the junior school of University College in Gower Street, two years boarding at a Jewish school in Ramsgate, and a final year back at Gower Street. In 1850 he joined the family firm, already overstocked with uncles and cousins, only too aware that his future as a young clerk was precarious. The death of his mother in August 1851 determined that he would have to seek his fortune elsewhere, and he began to attend lectures at the newly opened Government School of Mines in London. A year later, with some expertise in assaying, he sailed for the Victorian goldfields.<br>
<br>Vogel was only seventeen when he arrived in Melbourne. He first set up as an assayer, and then went into goldfield storekeeping and gold purchasing. By mid-1854 he was based in Maryborough and travelled to the nearby goldfields with pharmaceuticals and other supplies. Two years later he pitched his tent in the main street of Dunolly and became a journalist. He began by contributing articles to the Melbourne <span class="italic">Argus</span> and then became editor of the Dunolly <span class="italic">Advertiser</span>. His career in newspapers collapsed with the decline of the goldfields in 1861, and he stood for a seat in the Victorian parliament. After being heavily defeated, he left for Otago, New Zealand, where gold discoveries had recently been reported.<br>
<br>Vogel settled in Dunedin, and in November 1861 became co-founder and editor of the <span class="italic">Otago Daily Times</span>, New Zealand's first daily newspaper. With a staff including Ebenezer Fox, later secretary to the cabinet, and Benjamin Farjeon, a future novelist, <span class="italic">The Times</span> became the leading newspaper in the largest and wealthiest town in the country. Vogel used it as a springboard first into community affairs and then into local politics. In June 1863 he was elected to the Otago provincial council and in November 1866 he became head of the provincial executive, occupying the post of provincial treasurer until May 1869.<br>
<br>Election to the provincial council was followed in September 1863 by victory in a by-election to the house of representatives. In parliament Vogel quickly demonstrated his outspoken, argumentative nature and his financial ability. When William Fox took over the leadership of government in June 1869, he recruited Vogel as his colonial treasurer.<br>
<br>On 19 March 1867 Vogel married Mary, the daughter of William and Emily Clayton, his Dunedin neighbours. William Clayton was a highly regarded architect. Mary Clayton was eighteen at the time of her marriage, a seemingly quiet but forceful young woman who bore four children between 1868 and 1875, and strongly supported her husband's political and social ambitions. Vogel adored her, as he did his sister who came to live with them, and always attempted to provide his family with the material comforts and domestic warmth that he felt he had missed through his youth and early career.<br>
<br>The Vogels had planned to move to Auckland after the parliamentary session of 1869, and Vogel had arranged to become editor of the <span class="italic">Southern Cross</span>, having lost his control of <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1868. The colonial treasurership ended this plan, although he did for a while own the <span class="italic">Cross</span>. Vogel won Auckland constituencies in the elections of 1871 and 1875, but henceforth was never really settled in New Zealand. The family lived in Wellington during the parliamentary sessions but spent long periods out of the country on political business until Vogel's appointment to London in 1876. Although he returned to New Zealand on business in 1882&#150;3 and was back in politics between 1884 and 1888, most of the rest of his life after 1876 was spent in England.<br>
<br>Vogel was at the height of his political powers in the first half of the 1870s. As a representative of Otago on the South Island, he had viewed the wars of the 1860s between Europeans and Maori as a northern matter. He had then advocated that the South Island separate from the North to pursue its economic development unencumbered by the disruption of fighting and war debts. However, by 1869 he recognized that European control and progress required a unified colony, increased migration and settlement, and a modern transport and communications infrastructure. His financial statement of 1870 revived the colonizing creed of rapid progress through public expenditure by outlining a ten-year plan for government-financed and -managed immigration and public works. During the following years &#145;Vogelism&#146; brought more than 100,000 immigrants into the colony to settle on the land and work in construction and domestic service, and provided the country with a network of roads, railways, and bridges. Vogel became the dominant figure in politics. When the provincial governments, previously responsible for settlement and development, created political difficulties for the operation of his policy, he proposed the abolition of the provincial councils in the North Island. By 1875 parliament had agreed that all the provincial councils should go, making the central government supreme. Vogel held at various stages the offices of colonial treasurer, postmaster-general, commissioner of customs, telegraph commissioner, and minister of immigration. He was premier from April 1873 until July 1875 and then again from February to August 1876.<br>
<br>Vogel recognized that New Zealand needed to increase its exports, and he worked to establish trade with Australia, the United States, and the Pacific islands. He spent many months in Australia, and visited the United States to negotiate steamship services to New Zealand. He also arranged contracts to link New Zealand and Australia by cable. He returned to England on political and financial missions in 1871 and 1874&#150;5, assisted in raising loans for the colony, and discussed defence and British policy in the Pacific. In 1872 he was rewarded with a CMG and, in 1875, a KCMG.<br>
<br>In August 1876, with the country on the verge of a financial recession and his own political support much eroded, Vogel resigned the premiership and accepted appointment as agent-general in London. He was in poor health and finances, and intended to use the colonial appointment to establish a career in business or politics in England. In the 1880 general election he stood as a Conservative for the borough of Penryn and Falmouth and shared in the party's massive defeat. His official duties provided him with valuable contacts, but when his private financial interests began to conflict with those of the government he was required to resign.<br>
<br>Vogel spent the early 1880s promoting a range of speculative land, electricity, railway, and telecommunication companies. All were high risk and under capitalized and damaged his business reputation. In 1884 he returned to New Zealand and, hoping to save one of his companies through government intervention, contested a seat in parliament. The country, suffering badly from depressed export prices and government retrenchment, welcomed him back. He took a seat in the house as member for Christchurch North and became colonial treasurer in a government led by Robert Stout. Unable to effect a financial recovery, this government was thrown out of office in 1887. Vogel retained his seat and was leader of the opposition for a year. However, after the 1888 parliamentary session the Vogels returned to England for good.<br>
<br>Although he believed that he had given the best years of his life to New Zealand, Vogel's real commitment was to the notion of a Greater Britain. He envisaged New Zealand as the Britain of the south seas and pursued colonial expansion in the Pacific, urging Britain to annex strategic and potential trading partners among the islands. He was an early advocate of imperial federation, and supported a federal parliament and collective responsibility exercised by states bound in an indissoluble union.<br>
<br>Vogel published some thirty or more articles on the politics of New Zealand and the empire, most of which appeared in the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span> and the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>. He edited the 1875 <span class="italic">Official New Zealand Handbook</span> and in 1889 published a novel, <span class="italic">Anno Domini, or, Woman's Destiny</span>. The latter prophesied a united Anglo-American empire, ruled by women and free of poverty.<br>
<br>Rather short in stature, Vogel was portly, even as a young man. His bachelor period on the goldfields gave him a penchant for pipes and cigars, alcohol, and oysters, which took their toll on his health. By his forties he suffered from gout and by the 1880s could barely walk. He wore big woollen slippers, travelled with a wheelchair, and always needed assistance. His increasing deafness made his participation in parliamentary debate difficult. Lines of pain are etched on his face in later photographs.<br>
<br>Perhaps because of the rejections of childhood and youth, Vogel cherished an overwhelming desire for public success and recognition. He was an extrovert, impulsive, generous, and headstrong. Some of his contemporaries were repelled by his brash abuses of political power and his disregard for propriety, while they also recognized his ability and personal charm. Few could separate the man from his policies, and his reputation fluctuated with economic cycles. He was often blamed for the severity of the 1880s depression, and then, in the late 1890s, was seen as the man who had provided the country with the infrastructure necessary for an export-led recovery. The Keynesian view that depression could be cured by government expenditure cast Vogel as a visionary economic thinker.<br>
<br>Vogel's life ended in disappointment and poverty. Confined to a book-lined room in his home, Hillersdon, in East Molesey, Surrey, from the early 1890s, he worried over his family and their future. In 1893 his second son was killed in action against the Matabele (Ndebele). Mary Vogel was so concerned by his depression and financial worries that she turned to New Zealand friends for help. In his last years the New Zealand government provided him with a small sinecure. He died at home of a heart attack on 12 March 1899 and was buried three days later at the Jewish cemetery at Willesden.<br>
