<span class="headword">Wilkinson,  (James John) Garth</span>  (1812&#150;1899), <span class="occ">Swedenborgian writer and homoeopath</span>, born in Acton Street, Gray's Inn Lane, London, on 3 June 1812, was the eldest son of <a name="cosubject_29426"></a><span class="headword">James John Wilkinson</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1780, <em>d.</em> 1858), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, the eldest son of Martin Wilkinson, attorney, and Jane Rawling. James Wilkinson was baptized at St Mary-le-Bow, Durham, on 19 June 1780, and entered Gray's Inn, London, on 26 November 1802; he practised as a special pleader and was also a judge of the county palatine of Durham. On 4 September 1811 he married Harriet Robinson of Sunderland. By 1849 he had married again; his second wife, Anne Wilkinson, wrote a number of legal works. She predeceased him. He died at 8 Church Row, London, on 25 December 1858.<br>
<br>Garth Wilkinson was educated at a school in Sunderland, and afterwards at a private school at Mill Hill kept by John Charles Thorowgood and at Totteridge in Hertfordshire. At the age of about sixteen he was apprenticed by his father to Thomas Leighton, senior surgeon of the infirmary at Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1832 he went to London to train at various hospitals, and in June 1834 he became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England and a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries. On 4 January 1840 he married Emma Anne, daughter of William Marsh, a jeweller. They had one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>Wilkinson was attracted by the writings of William Blake, and in 1839 he edited his <span class="italic">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</span>, with considerable alterations. A volume of his own poems, entitled <span class="italic">Improvisations from the Spirit</span>, which appeared in 1857, showed many traces of Blake's influence. Early in life Wilkinson was also introduced, by his maternal uncle George Blakiston Robinson, to the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg, and he became a member of the committee of the Swedenborg Society and of the subcommittee for promoting the issue of a uniform edition of Swedenborg's works. From 1839 he devoted most of his literary energies to the translation and elucidation of Swedenborg's writings.<br>
<br>When in 1840 Wilkinson began to contribute to the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span> the originality of his philosophic intellect immediately attracted attention. A paper which appeared in 1841 dealing with Coleridge's comments on Swedenborg's <span class="italic">De oeconomia regni animalis</span> and his <span class="italic">De cultu et amore Dei</span> gained him the admiration of the American writer Henry James, father of the novelist. James corresponded with Wilkinson at length, and two of his works, <span class="italic">The Church of Christ not an Ecclesiasticism</span> (2nd edn, 1856) and <span class="italic">Christianity the Logic of Creation</span> (1857), were composed of letters originally addressed to Wilkinson. In 1843 and 1844 Wilkinson published his translation of Swedenborg's <span class="italic">De oeconomia regni animalis</span> as <span class="italic">The Animal Kingdom Considered</span>. These volumes were followed by further translations, one of which, <span class="italic">Outlines of a Philosophic Argument on the Infinite</span>, won him the friendship of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Wilkinson's translations were accompanied by preliminary discourses which were declared by Emerson to &#145;throw all contemporary philosophy of England into shade&#146;  (<span class="italic">Representative Men</span>, 1882, 65; cf. <span class="italic">English Traits</span>, 1857, 140). Besides enjoying the esteem of Emerson, Wilkinson was intimate with Thomas Carlyle, James Anthony Froude, Charles Dickens, Alfred Tennyson, and the Oliphants, and he was the friend of Edward Augustus Freeman, who was a relative.<br>
<br>For Wilkinson, Swedenborg promised not merely a linkage (mystical in some definitions) between everything natural and supernatural but also a new organization of knowledge and thus of medical and social relations. &#145;All power&#146; (as he worded one sentence of his own translation of the Swede's <span class="italic">Animal Kingdom</span>, xxxix) &#145;resides in the least things&#146;. This core principle made him a readier listener when Emma Anne refused, on homoeopathic grounds, to administer a drug he himself had just prepared for their first baby. Her mutiny precipitated his conversion to homoeopathy. (This incident is recounted in Wilkinson's own words in his biography by C. J. Wilkinson on pages 247&#150;9.) Wilkinson then established himself as a homoeopath in Wimpole Street, London.<br>
<br>The same Swedenborgian principle helped make Wilkinson, along with Swedenborgians such as William White but unlike some homoeopaths, into a furious opponent of vaccination. This, for him&#151;along with the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span> and vivisection&#151;exemplified an already current misdevelopment in the natural sciences and in any version of medicine that claimed to derive from them. This misdevelopment was, he believed, compartmentalization, and one of its silliest results was materialism; its ghastliest was, towards the lay and powerless in general and towards women and animals in particular, a coldly objectifying arrogance, or &#145;specialism&#146; as he called it. This had social (not least anti-woman) dimensions. Crucially it applied primogeniture to the terrain of knowledge:<blockquote>aim[ing] rather at increasing intellectual property in a few hands, and transmitting it unimpaired from generation to generation, than &hellip; [at] the public service. &hellip; All the &hellip; fences, and other arrangements of intellectual estates, are especially adapted for the system of individual proprietorship, and would be useless under a different mode of tenure. (<span class="italic">Science for All</span>, 1847, 3&#150;16)</blockquote>By contrast Wilkinson agreed with most plebeian medicators in wanting every person to be their own and their neighbour's healer, unintimidated by what he called the &#145;corporate quackery&#146; of orthodoxy.<br>
<br>All this made Wilkinson, despite his membership of the Royal College of Surgeons, not merely someone for whom surgery had become &#145;ever an abomination&#146;  (Wilkinson, 264) but also an increasingly shrill Cassandra against the dominant intellectual and social trends in medicine. His own allegiance to &#145;leasts&#146; harmonized with spiritualists and with many medical heretics in their belief in the power of what came to be called &#145;imponderables&#146;. In common with mid-nineteenth-century medical botanists and others, he attempted to work out the democratic implications of this apparent power. In the 1880s he was still looking forward to &#145;new doctrines&#146; which would renew &#145;all business, all property, all relations&#146; and would amount to &#145;the Second Coming of Christ&#146;  (<span class="italic">Swedenborg's Doctrines and the Translation of his Works</span>, 1882, 5, 7). During the 1840s he had been stirred by Fourierism and in 1848 he had visited Paris and felt sympathy with its insurgent workers.<br>
<br>Wilkinson was versed in Icelandic and Scandinavian literature. He was a member of the Icelandic Society of Copenhagen, and corresponded with Gunnar Rudberg, the Scandinavian philologist. He was associated with J&oacute;n A. Hjaltal&iacute;n in translating Swedenborg's <span class="italic">Divine Love and Wisdom</span> into Icelandic (1869). He visited the United States, and about 1850 was the English correspondent of several New York and Boston papers. His earliest residence in London was 25 Church Row, Hampstead. About 1848 he moved to Finchley Road. He died at 4 Finchley Road, London, on 18 October 1899, and was buried on 21 October in Hampstead cemetery.<br>
