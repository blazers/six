<span class="headword">Fane,  Francis William Henry</span>, twelfth earl of Westmorland  (1825&#150;1891), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born in Hill Street, Berkeley Square, London, on 19 November 1825, was the fourth but eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9137/', "John Fane, eleventh earl of Westmorland (1784&#150;1859)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Priscilla Anne Wellesley-Pole [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9140/', "Fane, Priscilla Anne")</script>], daughter of William Wellesley-Pole, third earl of Mornington. He was educated at Westminster School (from 18 September 1837) and at Sandhurst. He was gazetted ensign into the 74th regiment on 24 February 1843 and lieutenant on 26 July 1844, and served in the Punjab campaign of 1846. On 1 August 1848 he was promoted captain and made aide-de-camp to Viscount Hardinge, the governor-general of India. He served under Lord Gough, received a medal for bravery at the battle of Gujrat on 21 February 1849, and obtained his majority on 7 June. After the war he returned to England and exchanged into the Coldstream Guards. On the outbreak of the Crimean War he went out as aide-de-camp to Lord Raglan (his uncle by marriage), and was present at the Alma (20 September 1854), bringing home Raglan's dispatches. He was appointed brevet lieutenant-colonel on the day of the battle, and lieutenant-colonel on 12 December 1854. He was present at Raglan's death. Made CB on 10 July 1855 and knight of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur on 30 April 1857, he received the Mejidiye (fifth class) on 2 March 1858, and in 1856 became aide-de-camp to the duke of Cambridge.<br>
<br>Since the death of his elder brother in 1851 Fane had been styled Lord Burghersh, and on 16 October 1859 he succeeded his father as twelfth earl of Westmorland. He retired from the army in 1860 with the rank of colonel, and devoted himself to the turf. He won many victories in the handicaps, but never in any of the great races for three-year-olds. Eventually, unsuccessful betting compelled him to give up racing on his own account, but for some time he looked after the eighth duke of Devonshire's horses. Lord Westmorland died at 34 Brook Street on 3 August 1891, and was buried on the 5th at Apethorpe, Northamptonshire, his principal seat. He had married at St George's, Hanover Square, on 16 July 1857, Lady Adelaide Ida Curzon (1835&#150;1903), second daughter of Richard William Curzon, first Earl Howe. He was succeeded by his only surviving son, Anthony Mildmay Julian.<br>
