<span class="headword">Pack,  Faithful Christopher</span>  (1760&#150;1840), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 12 August 1760 in Norwich, the son of a Quaker merchant whose family claimed a connection with that of Sir Christopher Packe, lord mayor of London. Though employed by his father in early adulthood Pack showed a strong aptitude for painting. With the failure of the family business he took up painting as a profession, and moved to London in 1781. He made friends with the painter John Hamilton Mortimer, and studied under Sir Joshua Reynolds, making copies after his portraits. After a brief spell in Norwich ,Pack spent four years (1783&#150;7) in Liverpool, exhibiting at the Society for Promoting Painting and Design in 1784. Returning to London, he showed at the Royal Academy in 1786 and 1787.<br>
<br>With a recommendation from Reynolds to the duke of Rutland, then lord lieutenant of Ireland, Pack departed for his first period in Dublin about 1789. He had some success as a portrait painter, reputedly meeting Gilbert Stuart at an artists' dinner on St Luke's day in 1789. In 1790 he contributed two pictures to an exhibition at the Lyceum in College Green. Again in London, he exhibited four pictures at the Royal Academy in 1796 (the same year that he stood as a candidate for associate there) including <span class="italic">One of the Society of Quakers, Aged 83</span>. He then taught drawing for a number of years in Bath, living at 19 Green Park Street.<br>
<br>Returning to Dublin once more in 1802, Pack continued as a teacher of drawing and painting. From that time until 1821 he exhibited widely, including pictures of horses, portraits, and landscapes. He was president of the Society of Arts in 1812, showing thirty-seven works there, and was vice-president of the Royal Hibernian Society in 1814. By 1820, however, he seemed to experience harder times. His offer to lecture at the Dublin Society was declined, and in the following year, on 21 March 1821, a sale of his pictures was conducted from his residence, 33 Dawson Street. He finally left Dublin for London, contributing to the Royal Academy in 1822 and 1840, but mainly to the British Institution (1825&#150;39), works in oil and watercolour. He also made landscapes in pastels, and reproduced some of his Irish views in aquatint, of which proofs were signed &#145;F. Chris Pack&#146;. In exhibition catalogues his name appears under the names &#145;C.&#146; &#145;F. C.&#146; or &#145;F. Christopher&#146; Pack. He died aged eighty-one at 20 Sandwich Street, Gray's Inn Lane, London, on 25 October 1840, a few months after his wife, who had died in August that year.<br>
