<span class="headword">Binney, Sir  (Frederick) George</span>  (1900&#150;1972), <span class="occ">explorer and blockade runner</span>, was born on 23 September 1900 at Great Bookham, Surrey, the second of two sons of Maximilian Frederick Breffit Binney (1859&#150;1936), vicar of Richmond, Surrey, and his first wife, Emily Blinkhorn, who died when Binney was born. There were two more sons of a second marriage. He won a scholarship from Summer Fields, Oxford, to Eton College and later to Merton College, Oxford. He obtained a third class in English in 1923. At Oxford, at a chance meeting with Julian Huxley in Blackwells, he was asked as editor of <span class="italic">Isis</span> to back an expedition to Spitsbergen and to become its organizer and secretary. This was the Oxford University Spitsbergen expedition of 1921. In 1923 he organized and led the Merton College Arctic expedition and in 1924 the Oxford University Arctic expedition. The first to use a seaplane for Arctic surveys, he recorded his experiences in his book <span class="italic">With Seaplane and Sledge in the Arctic</span> (1925). His achievements were recognized by the Back award of the Royal Geographical Society, the gold medal <i>de la roquette</i> of the Geographical Society of Paris, and in 1957 by the founder's gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society.<br>
<br>Binney joined the Hudson's Bay Company in 1926, and spent the winters in England recruiting young apprentices and the summers planting them on trading stations in the Canadian Arctic. A <span class="italic">Times</span> leader on his <span class="italic">The Eskimo Book of Knowledge</span> (1931), the first book other than the <span class="roman">Bible</span> to be made available to the Inuit in their own language, led his chairman to offer him promotion to the company's headquarters in Winnipeg, but he refused and joined the United Steel Companies Ltd the next day. He was appointed to build up a central export department and became the company's export director, distinguishing himself by his remarkable success as an unconventional negotiator. He remained with United Steel until it was nationalized, travelling the world on its behalf, from Europe to North and South America, Russia, Iran, India, and the Far East.<br>
<br>Having narrowly missed service in the First World War, Binney was determined to play a part in the second. In December 1939 he was sent by iron and steel control (Ministry of Supply) as their Scandinavian representative to Sweden to negotiate the purchase and shipment of special steels, machine tools, and ball-bearings which were vital for the British armament industries. The German invasion of Denmark and Norway on 9 April 1940 cut Sweden off from the West, whereupon Binney decided to run the gauntlet of the Skagerrak blockade. He defeated opposition to his plan at home and in Sweden and was given diplomatic status as assistant commercial attach&eacute; at the British legation; he recruited British, Norwegian, and Swedish crews for five Norwegian merchantmen. Operation Rubble, as it was called, sailed from Bro Fjord north of G&ouml;teborg on 23 January 1941 with Binney as commodore. It got through to Kirkwall in the Orkneys with 25,000 tons of vital war supplies and five ships for the allied merchant fleets. Binney refused an important appointment in Washington, and returned to Sweden to run operation Performance in March 1942 with ten ships. Only two got through, with 5000 tons of cargo, two returned to Sweden, and the rest were sunk or scuttled.<br>
<br>Binney was expelled from Sweden as <i>persona non grata</i> for smuggling scuttling charges and arms on board his ships but reappeared as commander, Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, in 1943 in charge of operation Bridford. This consisted of a flotilla of five motor coasters (of which two were lost) which delivered 347&frac12; tons of valuable cargo while another 88 tons were airlifted. Having been invalided out after a heart attack, Binney still involved himself in yet another operation&#151;Moonshine&#151;which delivered arms to the Danish resistance. He was knighted in 1941 and appointed to the DSO in 1944 for these remarkable exploits. His unique contribution to the war effort was to help meet the shortfall of ball-bearings when there were too few coming from British factories and insufficient imports from the USA and Canada. After demobilization in 1945 Binney returned to United Steel, and left it once only&#151;for a brief foray for the government as leader of the UK trade and industrial mission to Ghana in 1959.<br>
<br>This jovial buccaneer with his puckish sense of humour, his stocky physique, ruddy complexion, and keen blue eyes was a man of discriminating taste in books, antiques, and the good things of life. Binney's homes were perfect settings for his treasures, and his restoration of his home, Horham Hall, Thaxted, Essex, was typical of his taste. He was an obstinate individualist with scant respect for authority, a man of impeccable integrity, and meticulous in his attention to detail. Cyril Alington, his headmaster at Eton, called him &#145;the ingenious and ingenuous Binney&#146;: this he always remained.<br>
<br>Binney was married first, on 7 May 1946, to Evelyn Mary, widow of Flight Lieutenant A. P. F. Fane of the RAF Volunteer Reserve, and elder daughter of Thomas G. Marriott, of Putney Hill, London. This marriage was dissolved in 1954 and the following year Binney married Sonia, widow of Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Crofton Simms MC, and daughter of Paymaster Rear-Admiral Sir William Marcus Charles Beresford Whyte. He adopted her son Marcus. He died on 27 September 1972 at his home, Domaine des Vaux, Haut de la Vall&eacute;e, St Lawrence, Jersey, Channel Islands.<br>
