<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bell,  Joseph</span>  (1837&#150;1911), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, the son of Benjamin Bell, surgeon, and his wife, Cecilia Craigie, was born on 2 December 1837 at St Andrew Square, Edinburgh. He was educated at the Edinburgh Academy and entered the University of Edinburgh at the early age of sixteen; he graduated MD in 1859. He travelled to the continent but was not attracted to stay and study there. Bell returned to become house surgeon to Professor James Syme, and then house physician to William Gairdner.<br>
<br>Bell became a demonstrator in anatomy, and at the early age of twenty-six he set up his own classes of systematic and operative surgery. He was special assistant to Syme for five years and was held in high esteem by his master and mentor. In 1865 he married Edith Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1874), daughter of the Hon. James Erskine Murray of the Elibank family; they had a son and two daughters. In 1872 Bell became a senior surgeon to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. During these years he also served with great distinction in the Edinburgh Eye Infirmary. Having completed the statutory fifteen years' service, he then &#145;retired&#146; from the Royal Infirmary to become the first surgeon to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children.<br>
<br>Bell's reputation as a brilliant, caring craftsman and surgeon has been extensively recorded, but he was also a dedicated mentor of nurses. He introduced the new Nightingale ward design to the Royal Infirmary and began the clinical teaching of nurses on Sunday morning rounds. He was the founder and vice-president of the Queen Victoria Jubilee Institute of Nurses. Bell was a strong churchman and after seeing two or three patients on a Sunday morning would go without fail to St George's United Free Church, where he was a senior elder.<br>
<br>Bell was not a prolific writer, but his book <span class="italic">Some Notes on Surgery for Nurses</span> (1887), dedicated to Florence Nightingale, ran to six editions. His other publications included <span class="italic">A Manual of the Operations of Surgery</span>, which ran to seven editions, and articles on scapulo-humeral dislocation and pulsating tumours of the orbit. He served Edinburgh University from 1895 as the assessor of the university court and was soon elected a curator of patronage, a post he held until he died. He was also committed to and involved in the admission of women to the medical school, which obviously involved much tact and understanding in order to break down prejudice. He was an examiner for the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh for more than forty-two years, treasurer for eleven, and president in 1887&#150;9. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and deputy lieutenant of the county.<br>
<br>Bell won notoriety as the inspiration for the creation of the character of Sherlock Holmes. Arthur Conan Doyle was a medical student in Edinburgh and had been impressed if not inspired by Bell's professional appearance&#151;&#145;a tall, stately, kindly man, keen eyes and aquiline features contributing to his air of intent investigation. He would study with close interest all the mannerisms, features, expressions and personal traits of a patient&#146;  (Liebow). Bell died on 4 October 1911 at his home, Mauricewood, Milton Bridge, Midlothian. He is buried in Dean cemetery, Edinburgh.<br>
