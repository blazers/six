<span class="headword">Coloribus,  John  de</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1502&#150;1555), <span class="occ">Dominican friar</span>, was Walloon in origin. He first appears as a member of the Dominican convent at Lille in 1502, when he was sent to study philosophy at Paris. In the nine years following he was recorded at a number of other houses in the Low Countries and northern France, and at the end of 1509 was appointed by the master-general to lecture at Lille on the <span class="italic">Sentences</span>. By 1511, however, he had left the continent under a cloud: he and a colleague had fled the Paris convent with a &#145;noteworthy&#146; theft and were consequently condemned to severe punishment and imprisonment wherever they should be found. Instead he came to Oxford, where he preached the university sermon on Ash Wednesday 1511 and successfully supplicated for the degree of BTh on 15 October following, describing himself as having studied logic, philosophy, and theology for sixteen years. On 10 May 1516 he supplicated for the degree of DTh, and was dispensed on 11 November 1522. In 1521 he was one of the theologians reported by the university as available to support the king in attacking Luther; like the others he had already written unpublished <i>opuscula</i> in this cause. In 1525, according to Wood, he was one of the fellows of Wolsey's Cardinal College.<br>
<br>John de Coloribus remained a Dominican, and it was as such that he received letters of denization on 17 March 1527. By 1531 he had left Oxford and moved to Cornwall, where he entered the employment of the Arundell family of Lanherne. During that year his services were required by the bishop of Lincoln, perhaps in connection with Henry VIII's divorce, but he preferred to be in the south-west, and begged Sir Thomas Arundell to speak up for him, &#145;that I may obtain some good provision to return to Cornwall&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 5, no. 214). He duly returned to Cornwall, and as a friar of Truro undertook preaching for the canons of Bodmin Priory, who in 1537 granted him an annuity of &pound;4 for life. He retained his right to this following the successive dissolutions of the Truro friary on 22 September 1538 and of Bodmin Priory on 27 February 1539. On 3 December 1538 he was among the former Dominicans dispensed to hold a benefice, but it seems unlikely that he obtained one. He remained in Cornwall, however, and perhaps returned to the Arundell household, since it was Sir Thomas who about 1543 persuaded de Coloribus to have his pension ratified by the court of augmentations. The result, according to a petition which de Coloribus presented to the chancellor about 1548, was that it was stolen from him by George Rolle of Stevenstone, a Devon landowner who speculated profitably in former monastic property and had the additional advantage of government office, as keeper of the records of the court of common pleas. Nevertheless, although de Coloribus described himself as &#145;a very poore man, sykly, impotente, bare in substans&#146;  (TNA: PRO, C 1/1207, no. 33) he was able to recover his pension, and was still receiving it in 1555. It is not known where or when he died.<br>
