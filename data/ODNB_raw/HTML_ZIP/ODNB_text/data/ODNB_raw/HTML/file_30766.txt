<span class="headword">Armitage, Sir  Arthur Llewellyn</span>  (1916&#150;1984), <span class="occ">jurist and university administrator</span>, was born on 1 August 1916 at Town Gate, Marsden, Yorkshire, the elder son of Kenyon Armitage (<i>d</i>. 1972), master draper of Oldham, and his wife, Lucy Amelia Beaumont (<i>d</i>. 1968). He attended Oldham Hulme grammar school and in 1933 he entered Queens' College, Cambridge, to which he remained passionately devoted for the rest of his life. Having obtained a first class in both parts of the law tripos and a distinction in the LLB, he spent two years at Yale University on a Commonwealth Fund fellowship and in 1940 was called to the bar by the Inner Temple, of which he later became an honorary bencher. In the same year he married Joan Kenyon (<i>b</i>. 1916), daughter of Harold Marcroft, yarn agent, of Oldham. They had two daughters. From 1940 to 1945 he served in the King's Royal Rifle Corps, attaining the rank of temporary major.<br>
<br>In 1945 Armitage accepted the offer of a law fellowship at Queens'. He was senior tutor of the college when, in 1958, at the age of forty-two, he was elected president. Queens' had fine buildings but few endowments and Armitage had to husband the college's resources with care. At the same time he was an effective university lecturer in law, his main interest being criminal law. He edited, with J. W. C. Turner, a casebook on criminal law and took an active part in establishing the department of criminal science, the forerunner of the Cambridge Institute of Criminology. He was also one of the editors of four editions of the practitioners' book <span class="italic">Clerk and Lindsell on Torts</span>.<br>
<br>Armitage's lecturing was noted for both its clarity and its physical vigour; his class watched with fascination as he twisted his body round the podium and often seemed about to crash to the floor. His college supervisions concentrated on basics: &#145;this is a book; it works on the hinge principle&#146;  (private information). His style became the object of much mimicry among his devoted pupils.<br>
<br>Armitage did not neglect the practice of criminal law. For twenty years he served as justice of the peace on the Cambridge city bench and from 1965 to 1971 was deputy chairman of Huntingdon (later Huntingdon and Peterborough) quarter sessions. In the field of public service, he had cut his teeth from the mid-1950s as a chairman of wages councils, later chairing the committee on the pay of postmen and the Agricultural Wages Board for England and Wales. No committee concerned with the penal system or with universities seemed to be complete without him.<br>
<br>In the 1960s Armitage served on the advisory committee on grants to students and the UNESCO advisory mission for the development of the University of the West Indies. This was the period of expansion of universities following the Robbins report and henceforth Armitage was in the thick of it. From 1967 to 1971 he served on the influential lord chancellor's advisory committee on legal education (the Ormrod committee) and later chaired that on legal education in Northern Ireland. In 1967&#150;8 he was president of the Society of Public Teachers of Law.<br>
<br>From 1965 to 1967 Armitage served his turn as vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge. In that capacity he came into contact with Humphrey Cripps who had financed a large new building for his own college, St John's, at the north end of the Backs and now accepted Armitage's invitation to provide an even larger building for Queens' at the south end. Before the building was begun, however, Armitage, who had become known in universities outside Cambridge through his membership of the University Grants Committee, was invited to become vice-chancellor of Manchester University, the largest non-federal university in Britain. Having ensured that the Cripps benefaction was secured for Queens' he accepted. He could not resist making frequent visits to Cambridge and was happy to serve as chairman of the governors of the Leys School there.<br>
<br>From 1974 to 1976 Armitage was chairman of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals of the UK universities, and was knighted in 1975. He also served both on the council of the Association of Commonwealth Universities and on the Inter-University Council for Higher Education Overseas. After his removal to Manchester, the amount of government work increased, for he was clearly regarded as a safe pair of hands. From 1973 to 1979 he was chairman of the National Advisory Council for the Training and Supply of Teachers and from 1976 to 1979 chairman of the committee on the political activities of civil servants.<br>
<br>Armitage gave up his vice-chancellorship in 1980 after ten years in office. That year he became chairman of the social security advisory committee, but probably the committee which brought him most into the public eye was the one that he chaired on lorries, people, and the environment. The committee reported in December 1980 and there was a white paper in December 1981 (command paper 8439). It concluded that it would serve the public interest to accept the economic benefits to be derived from heavier lorries, while reducing their adverse effects. It therefore proposed increases in the weight, though not the size, of lorries, and recommended an expansion of bypasses on lorry routes.<br>
<br>Armitage was a gregarious man of great energy, who exuded optimism. He was physically large, with prominent bushy eyebrows, well depicted in the portrait by Ruskin Spear in Queens' College. He played golf vigorously. He was an honorary LLD of the universities of Manchester (1970), Queen's, Belfast (1980), Liverpool (1981), and Birmingham (1981). In 1968 he was made a member of the Venezuelan order of Andres Bello, first class. He died on 1 February 1984 at his home, Rowley Lodge, Kermincham, near Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, and his ashes were interred in St Botolph's Church, Cambridge. He was survived by his wife and daughters.<br>
