<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Riddell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Woodley]</span>,  Maria</span>  (1772&#150;1808), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in England on 4 November 1772, the sixth of seven children and the youngest of the three daughters of William Woodley (1722&#150;1793), a West Indian plantation owner, twice governor and captain-general of the Leeward Islands, and his wife, Frances Payne. She first demonstrated her literary bent at the age of fifteen, jousting in verse with Joseph Jekyll, a noted wit twice her age; her &#145;Inscription on an hermitage&#146;, written during a stay in the Caribbean in 1788, displays real poetical maturity. In the course of a second visit in 1790&#150;91 she composed her <span class="italic">Voyages to the Madeira and Leeward Caribbean Isles: with sketches of the natural history of these islands</span> (1792), published with the help of the Edinburgh printer William Smellie, who praised its &#145;science, minute observation, [and] accurate description&#146;.<br>
<br>On 16 September 1790, on St Kitts, Maria married a widower, Walter Riddell (1764&#150;1802), lieutenant (on half pay), plantation owner on Antigua and the second son of Walter Riddell of Newhouse, a well-connected Dumfriesshire merchant, whose other son, Robert, of Glenriddell, was a noted antiquary and friend of Burns. They returned to Scotland, where Walter bought an estate near Dumfries. Renamed Woodley Park, it became the scene of many fashionable and literary gatherings. Two daughters, Anna Maria (1791&#150;1859) and Sophia (1792&#150;1797), were born before Walter departed in 1796 for Antigua, where he died.<br>
<br>Maria's acquaintance with Robert Burns, to whom she owed her introduction to Smellie, began in Dumfries in late 1791. Despite the &#145;Rape of the Sabines&#146; episode during Christmas 1793, when a drunken Burns may have overstepped the bounds of propriety towards his hostess, and notwithstanding the lampoons with which he requited his subsequent exile from her house, the intimate friendship that Burns formed with this &#145;really first-rate woman&#146; survived its year-long breach. She wrote a highly perceptive appreciation of Burns's character after his death in the <span class="italic">Dumfries Journal</span> (August 1796) and collaborated energetically with his biographer James Currie&#151;thereby also effectively protecting her own interests and reputation.<br>
<br>Maria left Scotland in 1797 for London, where she remained until granted, in 1803, apartments in Hampton Court Palace. Intelligent, beautiful, and widely read in four languages, she cultivated men of &#145;unquestionable genius&#146; such as Sir Thomas Lawrence and Henry Fuseli, whom she compared to Burns: his &#145;Lament for Maria&#146; (1809?) was probably written in response to her death. Other literati who frequented her soir&eacute;es included Sir James Mackintosh, Samuel Rogers, and &#145;Conversation&#146; Richard Sharp. Her only other published work was <span class="italic">The Metrical Miscellany</span> (1802; 2nd edn, 1803), an anthology of fugitive verse by contemporary celebrities, in which she also published twenty of her own poems (among them the prefatory verses of 1802 by &#145;The Editor&#146;). Of her prolific correspondence, little beyond that with William Roscoe and James Currie has survived. In 1808 Maria married Phillips Lloyd Fletcher (1782&#150;1863), an officer of dragoons, of Gwernheylod, Ellesmere, Flintshire. She died on 15 December 1808 in Chester and was buried in the Fletcher family vault at Overton.<br>
