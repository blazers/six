<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thomas,  Sidney Gilchrist</span>  (1850&#150;1885), <span class="occ">metallurgist</span>, was born on 16 April 1850 at Campanile Cottage, Canonbury Villas, Islington, London, the second of the four children of William Thomas (1808&#150;1867), a Welsh clerk in the solicitor's department of the Inland Revenue office, and his wife, Melicent Gilchrist (<i>b</i>. 1816), eldest daughter of James Gilchrist, a Scottish nonconformist minister. Educated mainly at Dulwich College, London, where he was a day pupil from 1859 to 1866, Thomas expressed a strong inclination towards applied science, but the death of his father when he was not yet seventeen led him to begin to earn his livelihood immediately after leaving school, at first as an assistant master in a school in Essex. Later in 1867 he obtained a junior clerkship at Marlborough Street police court in London, whence in 1868 he transferred to the Thames court, Arbour Square, Stepney, where he continued until his resignation in May 1879. Meanwhile, after office hours, he studied law and applied chemistry; at the Birkbeck Institution, a sentence used by George Chaloner, teacher of chemistry, seems to have imprinted itself on Thomas's mind: &#145;The man who eliminated phosphorus by means of the Bessemer converter will make his fortune&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). So it was that, about 1870, the solution of this problem became the main purpose of his life.<br>
<br>The age of bulk steel can be said to date from the 1860s, when the two alternative techniques of Bessemer and Siemens both began to be applied extensively. However, neither of these &#145;steelmaking&#146; processes removed phosphorus from the molten metal, and phosphorus rendered the resultant steel brittle and worthless. Consequently, only non-phosphoric ores could be used, so that the larger proportion of British, French, German, and Belgian pig irons remained untreatable by the new processes. As growth of bulk steel took place, so demand increased for a means to deal with the phosphorus; during the 1870s the commercial competition to obtain a solution intensified.<br>
<br>Thomas devoted much of his leisure to the problem posed by phosphorus, attending the laboratories of various chemical teachers, reading up all he could about the subject, sitting examinations of the Department of Science and Art and of the Royal School of Mines, and even experimenting in the fireplace at home. Holidays from his police-court duties were largely spent in visiting ironworks in Britain and abroad. In 1873 he was offered the post of analytical chemist to a brewery at Burton upon Trent, but declined it from conscientious scruples about fostering the use of alcohol. During 1874 and several subsequent years he contributed to the technical journal <span class="italic">Iron</span>.<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1875 Thomas arrived at a theoretical and provisional solution to the problem of dephosphorization. This called for a substance which was chemically basic and physically able to withstand the high temperature involved in the process, because for commercial working the durability of the converter's lining was essential. For the material of the new lining, experiments led him to the selection of lime or its congeners magnesia or magnesian limestone, but the practical realization of such a lining engaged him and his associates until 1879. He foresaw not only that by employing such a lining it would become possible to &#145;fix&#146; the phosphorus from the pig iron in a separate slag, but also that the phosphorus deposited in the basic slag itself represented a material of great potential value for agricultural purposes.<br>
<br>Demand for the relatively new bulk steel was growing strongly, and makers were desperate for means to enable iron resources containing the element to be used. Thomas, with his single-minded, determined investigation of the subject over several years, produced a solution to the difficulty at exactly the crucial time and in the face of considerable competition. In achieving his goal he was sufficiently energetic, skilled, and personable to obtain the essential assistance and confidence of several other people and, despite acute shortages of money, he ensured that the key features of his innovation were well protected by patents for his subsequent financial advantage. Besides the invaluable experimental work undertaken from late 1877 by his cousin, Percy C. Gilchrist (later FRS), chemist at Blaenafon iron- and steelworks in south Wales, Thomas received sympathetic help from the manager at Blaenafon, E. P. Martin, and, after September 1878, from the manager of Bolckow Vaughan &amp; Co.'s large works in Cleveland, E. W. Richards, together with his consultant, J. E. Stead.<br>
<br>Thomas took out his first patent in November 1877, and others followed during 1878 and 1879. In the spring of 1878 he first announced, at a meeting of the Iron and Steel Institute in London, that he had successfully dephosphorized iron in the Bessemer converter, but this statement was disregarded by his hearers. On 4 April 1879 successful experiments on a large scale were performed publicly at Bolckow Vaughan's Middlesbrough works. These demonstrations at once secured the practical commercial triumph both of the process and of the inventor. A paper, written earlier by Thomas in conjunction with Gilchrist for the Iron and Steel Institute, on the &#145;Elimination of phosphorus in the Bessemer converter&#146;, was read in May 1879. There, the solution of the problem of how to dephosphorize pig iron cheaply during converting, now experimentally demonstrated by the &#145;basic&#146; process, was clearly stated to comprise, first, substitution of a durable basic lining for the former siliceous one, and, second, provision of abundant basic material (such as lime) to secure a highly basic slag at an early stage of the blow. The process could also be adapted to the Siemens&#150;Martin system of making steel in open-hearth furnaces. It transpired that the use of lime to separate phosphorus from liquid iron had previously been patented in 1872 by G. J. Snelus, while employment of hot tar as binder for the individual lime fragments in the vessel's lining was covered by a patent filed by E. Riley in November 1878. The interests of the parties were combined and protected by the formation, in 1882, of the Dephosphorizing and Basic Patents Company.<br>
<br>The method was immediately adopted in 1879 and spread rapidly, enabling steel to be produced in much larger quantities. On the continent, the &#145;Thomas process&#146; (of basic-Bessemer converting) and its product, &#145;Thomas steel&#146;, persisted strongly into the 1950s. In many steelmaking districts open-hearth furnaces using the &#145;basic&#146; conditions enunciated by Thomas and Gilchrist predominated throughout the first half of the twentieth century. These same conditions continued to be fundamental features of most steelmaking techniques during the second half of the century, even though oxygen replaced air as the chief refining reagent. In 1885, the year of Thomas's death, world steel output amounted to some 6 million tons, of which 1 million tons, or nearly 17 per cent, was produced using his principles. A century later, in 1985, world steel output exceeded 700 million tons, with at least 550 million tons, or nearly 80 per cent, being made in the conditions he stipulated. Particularly in the years before 1960, besides the steel product, the basic processing yielded large quantities of slag rich in phosphorus, which, after grinding, was applied as agricultural fertilizer. In this way, by 1937 some 20 million tons of phosphoric acid had been returned to the land to increase its productivity.<br>
<br>Evidently precocious, and brought up in a mentally stimulating home, Thomas was a lively and ready conversationalist and correspondent; he was well informed, with wide interests. His enthusiasm helped him to create a favourable impression upon many. He held pronounced views on the more equable distribution of wealth, wanting to ameliorate the lives of the &#145;working masses&#146; and arranging to leave the great bulk of his money to &#145;doing good discriminately&#146;. He believed in life after death. He lived with his mother and sister, and never married. In his youth he was energetic and enjoyed walking and travelling. However, in the pursuit of his objective he drove himself hard and became habitually careless about food and rest. In 1877 he suffered a period of poor health: a few years later serious lung trouble manifested itself, and it became clear that systematic overwork, perhaps coupled with exposure to the ill-ventilated atmosphere of the police courtroom, had resulted in disease.<br>
<br>In early 1881 Thomas paid a triumphal visit to the USA, where he was enthusiastically welcomed by the leading metallurgists and ironmasters. In that year he also founded the North Eastern Steel Company to make products of basic steel in Middlesbrough. In 1882 he was elected a member of council of the Iron and Steel Institute, and in 1883 he was awarded a Bessemer gold medal of the institute, another medal being awarded to G. J. Snelus. Also in 1883 Thomas and Gilchrist received the gold medal from the Society of Arts. Already, however, Thomas was occupied in a vain search for restored health. He made a prolonged voyage round the world in 1883, by way of the Cape of Good Hope, India, Australia, and New Zealand, returning by way of the USA. The winter of 1883 and the first half of 1884 were spent in Algiers, after which he went to Paris with his mother and younger sister Lilian, who had been his close companion and was subsequently his executor. He died of emphysema at 61 avenue Marceau, Paris, on 1 February 1885 and was buried in the cemetery at Passy.<br>
