<span class="headword">Bruce,  Victoria Alexandrina Katherine</span>  (1898&#150;1951), <span class="occ">prison governor</span>, was born on 13 September 1898 at Kennet House, Clackmannan, the youngest by fifteen years in the family of two sons and three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32129/', "Alexander Hugh Bruce, sixth Lord Balfour of Burleigh (1849&#150;1921)")</script>, secretary for Scotland in Lord Salisbury's cabinet from 1895 to 1903, and his wife, Lady Katherine Eliza Hamilton-Gordon (<i>d</i>. 1931), youngest daughter of George John James Hamilton-Gordon, fifth earl of Aberdeen. She was probably educated at home, then became interested in social work, and after working from 1928 to 1931 as voluntary librarian of the boys' prison in Wandsworth, a special wing of Wandsworth prison for boys who had been removed from their borstals for bad behaviour or who had been recalled from parole, she was appointed a probation officer in the juvenile courts in London.<br>
<br>In 1937 Victoria Bruce was offered the job of deputy governor of the Aylesbury Borstal Institutions, where Lilian Barker had been governor from 1923 to 1935, transforming the Aylesbury borstal, the only girls' borstal in the country, which had opened in 1912 in the former state inebriate reformatory in the wing of the women's prison. Borstal training, so called because the first experiment had been in the wing of a prison in Borstal, near Rochester, had been established as part of the penal system in 1908, as a result of the efforts of Sir Evelyn Ruggles-Brise, who held the view that up to a certain age every criminal was potentially a good citizen, and that a prison sentence was inappropriate for young offenders. Alexander Paterson had developed a system of institutional training followed by a closely supervised period of parole.<br>
<br>Victoria Bruce spent three years at Aylesbury borstal before moving to Manchester in 1940 as deputy governor of the prison. In 1943 she returned to Aylesbury as governor of the borstal institution for girls, which now housed 250 girls. She introduced the house system, modelled on the English public school, and continued the work of preparing the girls for domestic and farm work, but Aylesbury borstal, which shared the prison block with the long-term women's prison, was still too large and prison-like to be suitable for young girls. She remained there until 1946, when she was appointed governor of HM prison, Duke Street, Glasgow, a women's prison.<br>
<br>Victoria Bruce died on 25 November 1951 at 6 Cathedral Square, Glasgow, after a short illness, and was buried on 28 November at Clackmannan church, Clackmannan, Scotland. She was unmarried.<br>
