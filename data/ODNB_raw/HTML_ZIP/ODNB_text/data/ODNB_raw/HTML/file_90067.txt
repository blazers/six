<span class="headword">Williams,  Philip James Stradling</span>  (1939&#150;2003), <span class="occ">physicist and politician</span>, was born on 11 January 1939 at the Maternity Home, Tredegar, Monmouthshire, the second of the three children of (William) Glyndwr Williams (1897&#150;1972), schoolmaster, and his wife, (Kezia) Morfydd, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davies (1906&#150;1989), a teacher. His parents were then living at 6 Wood Street, Bargoed, a mining town dominated by an enormous coal-tip, on the border between Monmouthshire and Glamorgan, and it was in this ravaged but densely populated area, a cradle of the industrial revolution and at the very heart of the south Wales coalfield, that Williams was brought up.<br>
<br>Williams's academic career began at Lewis School, Pengam, Glamorgan, from where he went to Clare College, Cambridge, to read natural sciences, winning the Greene cup and the Murgoci prize for physics. A brilliant student, and encouraged by an uncle, R. M. Davies, who was professor of physics at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, he stayed on at Cambridge for seven years after graduating, first doing research into synchrotron radiation in quasars (quasi-stellar objects) at the Cavendish Laboratory (obtaining his PhD in 1964) and then as a university demonstrator and fellow of Clare College. On 9 June 1962 he married Ann Green (<i>b</i>. 1941), a teacher and artist, and daughter of Thomas Henry Green, a builder's foreman; they had a son and daughter. They returned to Wales in 1967 when Williams took up a post as lecturer in the physics department at Aberystwyth; he was promoted reader in 1986 and became professor of solar terrestrial physics in 1991. He was an authority on incoherent scatter radar studies of the upper atmosphere and the complex relationship between the sun and the earth, his main contribution being in pioneering the study of solar wind using interplanetary scintillations. He played a leading role in getting Britain to join the European Incoherent Scatter Facility, of which he was scientific director in 1980&#150;82.<br>
<br>Having joined the Labour Party at the age of sixteen, an occasion made all the more memorable by Aneurin Bevan's having signed his copy of Marx's <span class="italic">Capital</span>, Williams had played an active part in student politics at Cambridge, and was joint author of <span class="italic">Socialism for Tomorrow</span>, a manifesto published by <span class="italic">Socialist Commentary</span> which argued in favour of decentralizing power from London to the regions and nations of Britain. He had a fund of anecdotes illustrating the mutual incomprehension that dogged relations between Cambridge left-wingers from more privileged backgrounds and those who, like himself, were rooted in socialism as lived by the people of the south Wales valleys.<br>
<br>It was the Labour Party's failure to get to grips with the blight settling on his country during the 1950s, a meeting with the Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell, whom he found less than inspiring, and the Nevin report of 1957, which showed that taxes raised in Wales exceeded the government's expenditure in Wales, that drove Williams out of Labour's ranks and into the arms of Plaid Cymru in 1961. He described his political odyssey in his book <span class="italic">A Voice from the Valleys</span> (1981), a rigorous account of radical politics in Wales and a disarmingly forthright statement of his own views. He put his formidable intellectual gifts into thinking not only about what Plaid Cymru should adopt as its economic policies but also, as the momentum for self-government gathered pace in Wales, what kind of democratically elected body was needed to address the problems of a country suffering the worst effects of post-industrialism.<br>
<br>Dr Phil, as he was widely known, threw himself into the hurly-burly of political life with great verve and relish. He stood in Plaid Cymru's name at six elections for the Westminster parliament, all in the Caerphilly constituency, where this boyishly affable, gregarious, and talkative man enjoyed a great deal of grass-roots support. At the by-election of July 1968, at the age of twenty-nine, he nearly unseated the Labour candidate with some 40 per cent of the votes cast, a swing of 29 per cent, at the time the second-largest ever recorded in a United Kingdom election. It was this close shave for Labour in its heartlands, together with Plaid Cymru's victory at Carmarthen in 1966 and a near-miss in Rhondda in 1967, that concentrated the Labour Party's mind on the case for a more effective measure of administrative devolution than Wales had hitherto enjoyed, a process that eventually led to a referendum in 1997 and the creation of a national assembly two years later.<br>
<br>Williams's major contribution to the development of Plaid Cymru's policies was made in <span class="italic">An Economic Plan for Wales</span> (1970), which he wrote with Dafydd Wigley, the party's future leader, and in <span class="italic">The Welsh Budget</span> (1998), in which he demonstrated that Wales, far from being subsidized by England, was more than paying its way in the economy of the United Kingdom. These publications, widely circulated and discussed at the highest levels, were typical of his thinking: well informed and meticulously illustrated, strictly analytical, and rich in the ideas sparked by his deeply held conviction that Wales would become a prosperous, progressive society when freed from the baleful grasp of London control. He served his party as vice-president and national chair (1970&#150;76), in which capacities he did much to promote its interests in the English-speaking parts of the country, which were always nearest his heart; he later also held discussions with the Green Party that led to the election of the Plaid Cymru candidate in Ceredigion.<br>
<br>Williams had the satisfaction of being elected as a list candidate for the south-east region at the first election for the national assembly in 1999 and the following year was voted in a Channel 4 poll as Welsh politician of the year for his work on the Objective One European funding programme. His decision not to stand for election to the assembly for a second term, largely because after the minority Labour administration went into coalition with the Liberal Democrats there was no longer any genuine dialogue with the opposition in the shape of Plaid Cymru, allowed him to return to his career as a scientist, notably with an astronomy project in the Arctic, but caused dismay across the political spectrum, since he was one of the few figures of national stature to sit in the fledgeling body situated in Cardiff Bay.<br>
<br>For relaxation, Williams enjoyed hill-walking, reading history and poetry, and jazz (he played alto saxophone). He suffered a heart attack on 10 June 2003, and was pronounced dead at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, later that day. His death meant the loss to Plaid Cymru of an extraordinarily able strategist and one of its most engaging personalities. He was survived by his wife, Ann, and their two children.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">The Psychology of Distance</span> (2003), published posthumously, Williams examined the role of the political parties in making the Welsh assembly work and analysed the economic and social ills besetting contemporary Wales, addressing many of the tensions, contradictions, and paradoxes which characterized the nation's life and making a brave attempt to resolve them. The breadth and detail of his knowledge, and his passionate advocacy of the cause of full Welsh self-government, were also displayed in <span class="italic">The Assembly Years, 1999&#150;2003</span>, a selection of the speeches he made during plenary sessions in the national assembly, which was published by Plaid Cymru in 2004.<br>
