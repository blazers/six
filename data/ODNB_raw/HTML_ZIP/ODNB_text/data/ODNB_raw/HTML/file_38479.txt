</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blundell, Sir  Michael</span>  (1907&#150;1993), <span class="occ">farmer and politician in Kenya</span>, was born on 7 April 1907 at 33 Campden House Court, Kensington, London, the third of four sons of Alfred Herbert Blundell, a London solicitor, and his wife, Amelia Woodward Richardson. His father's family came from Appletreewick in the Yorkshire dales. He was educated at Wellington College from 1921 to 1925, and was destined to go to Magdalen College, Oxford, but the school had an offer from an old Wellingtonian in Kenya to take on an assistant on his farm. Fired by a visit to the Empire Exhibition at Wembley in 1924, Blundell decided to take up the offer.<br>
<br>Blundell arrived in Mombasa in October 1925 with two tin trunks, a shotgun, and &pound;100. The farm was in Kipkarren in western Kenya, an area of European settlement set up for ex-soldiers after the First World War. Blundell's role as a trainee was to manage the African farmworkers and to drive a tractor which had replaced the ox-teams for ploughing. He shot regularly for the pot and for sport and went on hunting safaris, mainly on foot. It was a pioneering life which brought him into close contact with Africans, whom he quickly learned to respect. In 1927 he moved to manage a farm at Solai, near Nakuru in the Rift valley. He later bought the farm in partnership with his elder brother Jack, who was killed in the Second World War. Blundell played the piano and sang well. He found friends with whom he could indulge in his love of music, and in 1936 visited Austria to study singing and became absorbed in the great lieder cycles, but soon returned to Kenya. Farming in Africa remained the formative influence of his life.<br>
<br>A burly figure, with strong features, Blundell had prodigious energy, both physical and mental. He was fascinated by the new challenges posed by Africa and studied his environment in depth. His mastery of botany enabled him to write a popular book, <span class="italic">The Wild Flowers of Kenya</span>, published in 1982. This was revised and enlarged as <span class="italic">The Wild Flowers of East Africa</span> and published as a definitive guide by Collins in 1987. Above all, Blundell was a natural leader, not afraid of making forthright statements even if they offended older settlers in the small European community of Kenya. The Rift valley became the platform for his move from full-time farming to the political arena, which he chronicled in two books of memoirs, <span class="italic">So Rough a Wind</span>, published in 1964, and <span class="italic">A Love Affair with the Sun</span>, published posthumously in 1994.<br>
<br>Following the onset of the Second World War, Blundell was drafted in 1940 to command a battalion of pioneers, recruited largely from western Kenya. They took part in the Abyssinian campaign, fighting through to the capture of Addis Ababa, the assault on Gondar, and the defeat of the Italian forces. He was made an MBE in 1943. The battalion was afterwards upgraded to a royal engineer unit and sent to the Fourteenth Army, working mainly in Ceylon and India until the war ended, when they all returned to Kenya. Close comradeship with his soldiers made Blundell aware of African aspirations for political advance. Before leaving the army he was promoted colonel to an organization preparing for the reintegration of troops to civilian life.<br>
<br>In 1946 Blundell married and returned to his farm in Solai, bringing with him his wife, Geraldine L&ouml;tte Robarts (<i>d</i>. 1983), previously the wife of an army officer. Just before the war he had been singled out to serve the farming community as a member of the coffee board of Kenya. Now the government appointed him a commissioner in charge of settlement schemes for European ex-soldiers, over 300 of whom had come to the highlands. This was an important step intended to increase agricultural production. Although he gave up this job after a year, Blundell later used his political clout to press the rights of these farmers&#151;who had been led to believe that Kenya would remain a British colony&#151;to fair compensation from the British government. He was already involved in government and deputized briefly for the Rift Valley member of the legislative council in 1947. The following year, in the general election, he stood for the seat and defeated Lord Francis Scott, a doyen of settler politics, to embark upon his own political career.<br>
<br>In a country of 5 million people, the resident European community of about 35,000 had been the dominant group in the political life of Kenya since the 1920s. They acted as an opposition to the government officials and nominees who held power. Their policy priorities were simple: European leadership, the sanctity of the &#145;white highlands&#146;, a communal electoral roll, and separate education for the races. Blundell stood firmly on this platform. He was the epitome of the younger breed of settlers embarking on modern farming methods and growing cash crops. In 1948 he sold his land in Solai and moved to a higher farm at Subukia, east of Nakuru, where he grew pyrethrum and built a new house. A year later he was appointed chairman of the pyrethrum board of Kenya, a post he held for four years. He was re-elected unopposed in the 1952 election and soon became leader of the European elected members. However, there was a growing rift between the older members, who wanted to maintain the <i>status quo</i>, and those who saw the need for political change.<br>
<br>The testing time came with the declaration of Mau Mau emergency in 1952. This uprising, mainly among the Kikuyu and their cousin tribes in the central province, shook the governments in Nairobi and London. Blundell was in the thick of political developments. Faced with attacks on farms and murders of loyal Kikuyu, the European members were strongly critical of the conduct of what had become a limited war. Blundell showered the new governor, Sir Evelyn Baring, with advice, and proposed strengthening the administration of Kikuyu areas. He was at Government House when a mob of angry Europeans demonstrated outside. Baring sent him out with some of his colleagues to address and ultimately disperse them. On a visit to London, Blundell was invited to explain his views to ministers and to the media. In 1954 he became minister without portfolio in the Kenya government and a member of the war council. With the arrival of British troops and expanded administrative and police forces the violence was controlled. The focus turned to intensive development of agriculture in the African areas. Blundell threw himself into this as minister for agriculture, animal husbandry, and water resources (1955&#150;9). He promoted the &#145;Swynnerton plan&#146; to extend the planting of cash crops by African farmers and directed a revolution in land tenure to give them freehold land titles.<br>
<br>Meanwhile there had been a change in political alignments. Blundell and some of his colleagues broke away in 1954 to form the United Country Party (UCP). This grouping with liberal and multiracial aims aroused the opposition of many Europeans. Blundell considered that this polarization was a mistake and the UCP was wound up three years later. He resigned from the government in 1959 and became leader of the New Kenya Group, now as a specially elected member. He was determined to create a nation of all races under African majority leadership, and spoke widely&#151;and to African audiences in Swahili&#151;in preparation for the conference on the future of Kenya which was to be held early in 1960.<br>
<br>Blundell now played a key role in negotiating the constitutional developments leading to Kenya's independence. He was trusted by the political leaders in the Conservative Party, though not implicitly by the colonial secretary, Iain Macleod. The result of the Lancaster House conference in January 1960, when it became clear that the British government would accept majority rule based on universal suffrage, was a shock to European opinion in Kenya. Blundell himself was alarmed by the speed of change to African rule, but he had to bear the opprobrium. On arrival at Nairobi airport he was met by cheering Africans, and by angry Europeans who threw thirty coins at his feet, declaring &#145;Judas, you have betrayed and left us&#146;  (Blundell, <span class="italic">So Rough a Wind</span>, 283). Though ostracized by the bulk of the white community, he worked on in politics, returning to his old job at the agriculture ministry in 1961 after being re-elected with strong African support. His energies were applied to implementing settlement schemes for landless Africans. He was made a KBE in 1962, and in 1963 finally retired from active politics, just before Kenya gained independence. However, this was not the end of his service to the country of which he proudly became a citizen. He devoted himself to the running of Egerton Agricultural College (later a university), and was chairman of its board in 1962. He took great pride in funding the building of a rural school in the area from which most of his troops in the Abyssinian campaign had come. His skills were also sought in commercial boardrooms. He was chairman of East African Breweries from 1964 to 1977, a major job which he carried out with conspicuous success.<br>
<br>In his later years Blundell became a doyen of Kenya politics, respected and consulted by presidents and senior visitors. Ironically, he was looked upon as an advocate with the government by the Europeans in Kenya, coming forward in this capacity in 1990, at the age of eighty-three, to give evidence to the Kenya electoral review committee. His greatest joy was to sit on the veranda of his final home, Ridgeway, in Kiambu district, near Nairobi, and look out over the garden which he had created. After the death of his wife in 1983 he lived at Ridgeway with his daughter and his two granddaughters, and died there on 1 February 1993. He was cremated, and his ashes interred at St Paul's Church in Kiambu.<br>
<br>Blundell served two homelands, Britain and Kenya, with distinction. His major achievement was to pave the way for white Kenyans to come to terms with majority rule; but first and foremost he saw himself as an African.<br>
