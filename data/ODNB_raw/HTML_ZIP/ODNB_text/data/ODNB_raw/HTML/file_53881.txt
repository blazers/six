<span class="headword">Ridley,  George <span class="st"> [Geordie]</span></span>  (1835&#150;1864), <span class="occ">singer and songwriter</span>, was born on 10 February 1835, in Gateshead, the eldest child of Matthew Ridley, ropemaker and sometime coalminer, born at Wrekenton near Gateshead about 1808, and his wife, Frances Stephenson (or Stevenson), born at Gateshead about 1812. George was baptized at St Mary's parish church, Gateshead, on 1 March 1835. He had five brothers and three sisters. A younger brother, John Stephenson Ridley, born about 1846, became the one-mile running champion of England in 1871.<br>
<br>George Ridley began work at Oakwellgate colliery, Gateshead, at the age of eight, and his publisher and biographer, Thomas Allan, later noted that his education &#145;must have been of the simplest&#146;. He worked underground at Oakwellgate, then at the Goose pit, Gateshead, for ten years. About 1853 he moved to surface work as a wagon driver at Shipcote colliery, Gateshead. After three years he suffered an accident that was to change his life: a runaway wagon rolled over and left Ridley with severely crushed legs. Incapable of continuing pit work, he turned his hobby of entertaining as a vocalist into a full-time profession. His period of recuperation was lengthy, and it was not until the early 1860s that he began touring towns and villages north and south of the Tyne singing local and Irish songs.<br>
<br>By 1862, at the very latest, Geordie Ridley had begun to write his own songs, setting them, in both the early music-hall and ballad tradition of the period, to well-known tunes. His first song, &#145;Joey Jones&#146;, concerned the horse which won the Northumberland Plate or &#145;Pitman's Derby&#146; of 1861. By the end of 1862 his songs had gained enough local popularity to persuade Thomas Allan to purchase ten of them and to produce <span class="italic">George Ridley's New Local Songbook</span>.<br>
<br>Although not included in this collection, Ridley's most celebrated work, &#145;The Blaydon Races&#146;, had already been written. It was first performed at Balmbra's Music Hall in the centre of Newcastle on 5 June 1862 at a benefit concert for the professional boat racer Harry Clasper. The following day the <span class="italic">Newcastle Daily Chronicle</span> recorded this first performance: &#145;Mr Ridley adapted to a popular air a ballad descriptive of a journey (in prospect) by road to the ensuing Blaydon Races&#146;. The song was performed again, set to a tune called &#145;Brighton&#146;, on the actual day of the races, 9 June, and, after that event, a final verse was added.<br>
<br>There is no evidence that the song enjoyed any particular popularity in Ridley's lifetime or in the forty years after it was written, its fame being almost entirely a twentieth-century phenomenon. James Cosgrave, a Gateshead comedian, whose stage name was J. C. Scatter, featured it in his act during the early years of the reign of Edward VII, probably picking it up from one of Allan's later publications, in which it began to appear. Its recording on early 78 r.p.m. discs and its adoption by the followers of Newcastle United Football Club turned it into an anthem renowned worldwide in both tune and chorus.<br>
<br>Ridley himself had little over two years left to live after he composed &#145;The Blaydon Races&#146;. During that time he wrote &#145;Cushie Butterfield&#146;, another song which gained popularity in the twentieth century, but at a much more local level. By the summer of 1864 his health was beginning to decline. Fellow entertainers and sportsmen, who featured in many of his songs, ran benefit concerts to help him, but he faded rapidly.<br>
<br>Ridley died, unmarried, at the family home, 1 Grahamsley Street, Gateshead, on 9 September 1864. The cause of death was recorded as &#145;cardiac dropsy&#146;, a heart condition probably accelerated by his accident. Local legend has the author of the most famous of Tyneside songs departing this world in abject poverty, although there is little evidence for this beyond the absence of any grant of probate and the balance of probabilities. He was buried at St Edmund's cemetery, Gateshead, on 11 September 1864.<br>
