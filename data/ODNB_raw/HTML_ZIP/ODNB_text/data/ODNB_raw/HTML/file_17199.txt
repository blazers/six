<span class="headword">Lupo,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1571?, <em>d.</em> 1627/8?), <span class="occ">violinist and composer</span>, son of Joseph Lupo (<i>d</i>. 1616), violinist, and his wife, Laura Bassano (<i>d</i>. in or before 1596), was probably the &#145;Thomas s[on] [of] Basanew&#146; baptized at St Olave, Hart Street, London, on 7 August 1571. Laura's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70537/', "Augustine Bassano")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70535/', "Bassano, Alvise")</script>] lived in the same house, hence the ambiguous entry in the baptismal register. Both the Lupo and Bassano families had been recruited to the court of Henry VIII from Venice in 1540, the former among a group of string players and the latter as wind instrumentalists and instrument makers. Some, if not all, were Jewish; Lupo (also styled Wolf and Lopez) was a surname frequently adopted by Jews in gentile society. Among the Lupo family who arrived in 1540 were Ambrose (<i>d</i>. 1591), Alexander (who served at least until 1544), and Romano (<i>d</i>. 1542), all titled &#145;da Milano&#146;. Two sons born to Ambrose before he left Venice were Peter and Joseph. They may have come to England with their father, but in the 1550s both joined the musicians' guild in Antwerp. Joseph became a member of the string consort at the English court from Michaelmas 1563, and Peter (<i>d</i>. 1608) followed at Lady day 1567. By privy seal of 13 January 1601 Joseph received a &pound;200 gift from the queen for his &#145;long and faithful service&#146;. He was buried at Richmond on 23 April 1616. In 1607 Peter received &pound;20 for his service &#145;and for relief of his present necessitye&#146;, suggesting that he may have been in poor health then. Two sons of Joseph&#151;Thomas and Horatio (<i>bap</i>. 1583, <i>d</i>. 1626)&#151;and one son of Peter&#151;also <a href="#cosubject_17200">Thomas [<i>see below</i>]</a>&#151;in turn joined the group. Horatio was baptized at St Olave, Hart Street, on 5 November 1583. In 1607&#150;8 he was one of ten musicians serving Thomas Sackville, earl of Dorset, and he was a court violinist from Christmas 1611.<br>
<br>The elder Thomas Lupo, the subject of this article, was admitted among the violins at court on 26 January 1588. Augustine Bassano bequeathed him &#145;Twoe of my beste Lutes &hellip; and alsoe all my musicke bookes and other bookes&#146;  (LMA, DL/C/359, fols. 301&#150;2). During James I's reign he participated in the composition and performance of music for a number of masques; the third of five songs printed for <span class="italic">Lord Hay's Masque</span> (6 January 1607) was by him. For Jonson's <span class="italic">Oberon</span> (1 January 1611) and <span class="italic">Love Freed from Ignorance and Folly</span> (3 February 1611) he was paid &pound;5 for setting the dances, and he later received a further &pound;10, perhaps for the corresponding work in Campion's <span class="italic">Lord's Masque</span> (14 February 1613).<br>
<br>Lupo was among the group of musicians appointed to serve Henry, prince of Wales, from Christmas 1610, but they were disbanded following the prince's death on 7 November 1612. Eventually the remaining musicians, including Lupo, were reappointed to serve Charles as prince of Wales from 1617. On 10 May 1619 Lupo resigned his post as violinist, but from Christmas 1620 he became &#145;Composer for our violins, that they may be the better furnished with variety and choise for our delight and pleasure in that kind&#146;. So far as is known, all music attributed to &#145;Thomas Lupo&#146; is by this man. On 8 February 1622 &pound;20 was ordered to be paid to &#145;Thomas Lupo, one of the [prince's] Musicons, for a Booke by him presented&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SC 6/Jas. I/1685).<br>
<br>This present may be one indication of Lupo's new status as an official composer at court; it was among the musicians of Charles, prince of Wales, that the most innovative work was done by Lupo, Orlando Gibbons, John Coprario, and Robert Johnson. Together with his colleague Alfonso Ferrabosco (<i>d</i>. 1628), Lupo had already supplied a substantial body of music for viol consort. Lupo, although less strict in using imitative devices than was customary, rather explored a lively instrumental style, with changes of tempo, metre, and groupings within the ensemble. This variety continued in later years, but in company with Orlando Gibbons and Coprario, Lupo turned to smaller groups, writing treble parts apt for violin rather than viol. Some pieces are lightweight, similar to masque dances, while others introduce rapid passage work. Contrasts of instrumental colour&#151;violin, viol, and organ&#151;are a feature of much music emanating from Charles's musicians in the 1620s.<br>
<br>Lupo lived at Greenwich for some years, and four of his children were buried there between 1616 and 1620. He may have moved to Gillingham, Kent, later; from there on 26 July 1627 he appointed a deputy to receive &pound;106 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. from his arrears, but &#145;before he could subscribe his wife by violence kept him of[f], &amp; would not p[er]mitt him&#146;  (TNA: PRO, E 406/45, fol. 239<i>v</i>). His wife, Lidia, was probably the &#145;Mrs Lupoe&#146; buried at Greenwich on 10 April 1651. Lupo seems to have died about the end of 1627, since on 16 February 1628 he was replaced as court violinist by his son Theophilus. On 6 June 1629 Theophilus wrote a letter from Cooling, Kent (which is within the manor of Gillingham), assigning arrears to pay debts. In 1631 he was named as one of two players of the contratenor violin in the court band. He played in the inns of court masque <span class="italic">The Triumph of Peace</span> in February 1634. Sixteen two-part airs composed by him are known. He was buried at St Giles Cripplegate on 29 July 1650.<br>

<a name="cosubject_17200"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Lupo</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1577, <em>d.</em> in or after 1647), <span class="occ">violinist</span>, son of Peter Lupo (<i>d</i>. 1608) and his second wife, Katherine Wickers, was baptized at St Botolph, Aldgate, London, on 7 June 1577. He began service in the court violin band at midsummer 1598 at the age of twenty-one and served until the breakup of the court music in 1642. Until the death of the elder <a href="#cosubject_17199">Thomas Lupo [<i>see above</i>]</a> he was usually called &#145;the younger&#146; or &#145;junior&#146; in the records, but some references are ambiguous. Evidently he played the tenor violin: he is named as one of two &#145;low tenors&#146; in a list dated 12 April 1631, and was paid &pound;6 for supplying a tenor violin by warrant of 21 July 1632. He too played in <span class="italic">The Triumph of Peace</span> in February 1634, and he was one of the Corporation of Musick in Westminster named in its charter of 15 July 1635. The last known reference to him is dated 5 April 1647, when he signed an acquittance for &pound;6 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. from Cromwell's committee of the revenue (responsible for paying some maintenance to former court servants).<br>
