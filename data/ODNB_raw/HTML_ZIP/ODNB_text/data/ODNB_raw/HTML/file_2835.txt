<span class="headword">Bond,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1675&#150;1735), <span class="occ">journalist and poet</span>, was, in adulthood, said to be of Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. His parentage is uncertain, but he claimed to be related to Sir Henry Bond (<i>d</i>. 1721), a Roman Catholic Jacobite, and to Thomas, Viscount Gage (<i>d</i>. 1754) (Bond, 389; &#145;Dedication&#146;, <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, 9). Another Suffolk aristocrat, John Hervey, first earl of Bristol (1665&#150;1751), acknowledged Bond as his &#145;cousin&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letter-Books</span>, iv). It has been argued  (Baine, 171&#150;2) that Bond was the youngest son of Sir Henry Bond's younger brother Thomas, who was very distantly related to Viscount Gage, but Bond's dedications in 1723 and 1732 to Thomas's children, Henry Jermyn Bond and Judith Bond, do not imply that he was their sibling; also Bond's reputed age at death makes it virtually impossible that he was a legitimate son of Thomas.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Bond's upbringing and education except that his writings imply that he once lived in France. He may be the William Bond, &#145;a Protestant&#146;, who was given a pass to travel to Holland in 1697  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1697</i>, 206). He was certainly in England by 1715, when he emerged in print as something between a gentleman amateur and a hack. He wrote in the <span class="italic">Weekly Journal</span> and was the editor and chief author of a spurious continuation of Steele and Addison's <span class="italic">Spectator</span>, twice a week from January to August 1715. He and Thomas Willis, a fellow contributor to <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> continuation, were said to be Jacobite plotters in 1718, when it was also claimed that Bond had used his pen in the Jacobite cause in 1715  (<span class="italic">Stuart Papers</span>, 287), but his identifiable early writings seem politically unexceptionable. By 1720 he was publishing stridently loyal Hanoverian verse.<br>
<br>Bond was the proprietor and probably part author of the <span class="italic">Weekly Medley</span> from July 1718 to January 1720, and he was co-author with Aaron Hill of the better-known <span class="italic">Plain Dealer</span> from March 1724 to May 1725. Richard Savage called Hill and Bond &#145;the two contending Powers of Light and Darkness&#146; because, as Johnson explained, the character of the <span class="italic">Plain Dealer</span> rose with Hill's essays and fell with Bond's, but this is hardly noticed by an impartial reader  (Johnson, 25n). Bond published translations of two books of Tasso's <span class="italic">Jerusalem Delivered</span> (1719, 1732), a poor edition of Edward Jones's translation of George Buchanan's <span class="italic">History of Scotland</span> (1722), and other editions and translations. Between 1720 and 1730 he addressed several complimentary poems to royalty and aristocracy. Some of his verse appeared under the pen-name H. Stanhope and was published by Edmund Curll. With Martha Fowke Sansom (1689&#150;1736) Bond wrote <span class="italic">The Epistles of Clio and Strephon</span> (1720), a fictional courtship in the form of Ovidian love poems with occasional prose letters.<br>
<br>Bond lodged for a while with the deaf mute fortune-teller Duncan Campbell (<i>d</i>. 1730) and wrote the well-known anonymous <span class="italic">Life</span> of Campbell (1720), once thought to be by Defoe even though it was reissued as <span class="italic">The Supernatural Philosopher</span> (1728) under Bond's name. Bond also wrote a verse address to Campbell, &#145;The Parallel&#146;, much of which consisted of an attack on Alexander Pope. It first appeared in <span class="italic">Mr Campbell's Packet</span> (1720) and was reprinted by Curll as the title-poem in an anti-Pope collection, <span class="italic">The Progress of Dulness</span> (1728), at which point Pope responded by naming Bond as a hitherto nameless dunce in notes to the <span class="italic">Dunciad variorum</span> (1729, 2.118, 3.151). Happily, Pope seems to have been unaware that Campbell later accused Bond of causing dissension in his family and of ruining honest men by inveigling them into dubious business ventures: all the more deplorable because he was &#145;a Man of good Family&#146;  (Campbell, 26).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Tuscan Treaty, or, Tarquin's Overthrow</span>, a blank-verse tragedy, &#145;written by a gentleman lately deceased&#146;  (title-page), revised and altered by Bond, with prologue and epilogue by Aaron Hill, was acted twice at Covent Garden in August 1733 and printed in the same year. Hill gave more substantial help when he allowed his own new tragedy <span class="italic">Zara</span> to be staged by amateurs in the York Buildings for the benefit of Bond, who, according to the playbill, &#145;has lain ill of the Gout, and Rheumatism, upwards of Four Years&#146;  (Scouten, 496). Bond played Lusignan, father of the heroine, on the first night, 29 May 1735, but fainted on the stage and was carried home, where he died the following morning, aged about sixty. It is not known if Bond was ever married: his works contain scattered references to unhappy marriages. In his <span class="italic">Spectator</span> essays (1715) he repeatedly describes himself as old, but not too old for love.<br>
