<span class="headword">Nettleship,  Edward</span>  (1845&#150;1913), <span class="occ">ophthalmic surgeon</span>, was born on 3 March 1845 at the family home in Gold Street, Kettering, Northamptonshire, the fourth of the seven children of Henry John Nettleship (1807&#150;1870), solicitor, and his wife, Isabella Ann (1818&#150;1898), daughter of the Revd James Hogg, vicar of Geddington, Northamptonshire. As he did not possess the remarkable aptitude for the classics of his brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19912/', "Henry Nettleship")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35202/', "John Trivett Nettleship")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19913/', "Richard Lewis Nettleship")</script>, his early education was confined to Kettering grammar school (until 1860). His enthusiasm for natural history suggested a vocation for farming and he was sent to the Royal Agricultural College at Cirencester. Study there (1861&#150;3), and his subsequent courses in London, simultaneously at the Royal Veterinary College and King's College Hospital, proved his academic ability. He graduated MRCVS and as a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries in 1867.<br>
<br>For some months Nettleship returned to the Royal Agricultural College as a lecturer, before deciding to concentrate on human medicine, influenced against his own preference by his family. In 1868 he obtained the membership of the Royal College of Surgeons and, two years later, its fellowship. He had the good fortune to attract the patronage of the polymath Jonathan Hutchinson, initially as his assistant at the London Hospital and the Blackfriars Hospital for Skin Diseases. In 1869 Nettleship published the first description of the skin disorder urticaria pigmentosa.<br>
<br>On 22 January 1869 Nettleship married Elizabeth Endacott Whiteway (<i>b</i>. 1843/4) from Compton in Devon, daughter of Richard Whiteway, a farmer, and the sister of a college friend; there were no children. To secure his professional future, they considered emigration to New Zealand, but experience as Hutchinson's assistant at Moorfields Eye Hospital encouraged Nettleship to specialize. By so doing he deviated from his mentor's teaching; nevertheless, their association matured into lifelong friendship. Nettleship's choice of ophthalmology was facilitated by his appointment as librarian and curator of the museum at Moorfields (1871&#150;3). He seized this opportunity for research, and subsequent publications established his credentials as a meticulous scientific investigator, initially on eye pathology and later on a wide range of clinical topics.<br>
<br>Nettleship left Moorfields for the post of medical superintendent at the Ophthalmic School at Bow (1873&#150;4). This difficult work, with pauper children in isolation because of ocular infections, resulted in a Local Government Board commission for him to report on conditions in the metropolitan poor-law schools. Thereafter his career prospered, with staff appointments at the South London Ophthalmic Hospital (1873&#150;8), St Thomas's Hospital (1878&#150;95), Great Ormond Street Hospital (1880&#150;81), and Moorfields (1882&#150;98).<br>
<br>Contemporaries regarded Nettleship as a sound diagnostician and a methodical, if not brilliant, surgeon. The popularity of his textbook <span class="italic">The Student's Guide to Diseases of the Eye</span> (1879) reflected his teaching ability, and from 1888 to 1891 his workload was increased by appointment as dean of the St Thomas's medical school.<br>
<br>Nettleship's stature in the speciality was recognized by both colleagues and patients. A founder member of the Ophthalmological Society of the United Kingdom, he was chosen as its president (1895&#150;7). His private practice, begun in 1875 and conducted from 5 Wimpole Street, London, flourished. In May 1894, under the scrutiny of considerable press interest, he operated on the former prime minister William Ewart Gladstone, to extract a cataract. Two years later Nettleship examined Queen Victoria for the same condition, but advised against surgery.<br>
<br>Nettleship retired from clinical practice in 1902 and concentrated on the application to his speciality of the developing science of genetics. His former colleagues and students marked his retirement by founding the Nettleship medal &#145;for the encouragement of scientific ophthalmic work&#146;. Nettleship's pioneering series of papers on inherited eye disease inspired a school of successors and was acknowledged in 1912 by fellowship of the Royal Society.<br>
<br>The early influence of his authoritarian mother and the absence of children of his own may have contributed to the austere, reserved fa&ccedil;ade that Nettleship presented to outsiders. This was particularly apparent in 1907, when he was embroiled in the dispute over the care of the children of his late niece, Ida, and Augustus John, their unconventional father. His pupils, patients, and friends were aware, though, of the underlying warmth and generosity of his character, which complemented the energy and determination he applied to his researches. Born into a staunch Church of England family, Nettleship joined the positivists in 1873. In later life he actively supported the eugenics movement, while engaged on a study of albinism with Karl Pearson.<br>
<br>Prostatic surgery in 1911 led to distressing complications, and Nettleship's recovery was interrupted by the development of cancer of the lower bowel. Despite treatment with radiotherapy, he died at his home, Longdown Hollow, Hindhead, Surrey, on 30 October 1913; after cremation at Woking on 3 November, his remains were interred at St Stephen's Church, Shottermill, on 4 November. His wife survived him.<br>
