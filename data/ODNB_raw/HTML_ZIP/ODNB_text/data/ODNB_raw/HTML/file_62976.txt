<span class="headword">Smyth, Sir  Robert</span>, fifth baronet  (1744&#150;1802), <span class="occ">patron of the arts and radical</span>, was born on 10 January 1744 at Berechurch Hall, Essex, the son of the Revd Robert Smyth, vicar of Woolavington, Sussex, and his wife, Dorothy Lloyd. He was educated at Westminster School and was admitted as a pensioner at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 27 January 1762, from where he graduated BA in 1766. He had earlier enrolled at Lincoln's Inn (1761). On 8 December 1765 he succeeded his cousin, Sir Trafford Smyth, as fifth baronet. In 1774 he was elected MP for Cardigan Boroughs, where he remained until December of the following year when he was unseated by petition. Five years later he re-entered parliament as MP for Colchester, close to his estate at Berechurch, for which he sat as an opponent of the North ministry, an enthusiastic member of the association movement, and a supporter of Fox during the Regency crisis.<br>
<br>On 17 September 1776 Smyth had married Charlotte Sophia Delaval Blake (<i>d</i>. 1823); the couple had three children, George Henry, Louisa, and Charlotte. Born in Hamburg, Lady Smyth was naturalized by an act of parliament on 12 March 1781, thereby also confirming her marriage jointure. In 1777 the couple undertook an artistic tour of Italy. They arrived in Milan in early November, visited Naples in March 1778, and reached Rome in early April, where they became acquainted with the painters Henry Fuseli and Piranesi, who dedicated a plate to Smyth in his <span class="italic">Vasi, candelabri, cippi</span> (1778). The ten Italian paintings that descended to Smyth's great-grandson, Thomas George Graham White (sold at Christies on 23 March 1878, lots 1&#150;40), including works by Carracci, Correggio, and Salvator Rosa, seem to have been acquired during this trip. Back in England, Smyth became Fuseli's principal patron, for whom Fuseli produced seven of his finest paintings during the 1780s (dispersed 1878, lots 16&#150;22), most notably <span class="italic">Satan Starting from the Ear of Eve at the Touch of Ithuriel's Spear</span>, <span class="italic">Lady Macbeth</span>, and the <span class="italic">Death of Dido</span>.<br>
<br>Smyth was an ardent supporter of the French Revolution and, &#145;lik[ing] neither the government nor the climate of England&#146;  (Thomas Paine, quoted in Williamson, 247), he settled in Paris in 1791. This may also be when he established his bank in the rue Cerutti now rue Lafitte (not, as asserted by Alger, at the peace of Amiens). During his decade in Paris, Smyth became a &#145;very intimate friend&#146; of Thomas Paine  (Paine, 425). At the famous British dinner at White's Hotel on 18 November 1792, Smyth and Lord Edward Fitzgerald proposed to toast &#145;The speedy abolition of all hereditary titles and feudal distinctions&#146;&#151;misrepresented in the London press as an actual renunciation of their titles&#151;and signed the subsequent &#145;address&#146; to the convention. That autumn he helped Lord Wycombe spirit the author Madame de Flahault out of Paris.<br>
<br>In October 1793 Smyth assisted in the drawing up of a petition against the measures enacted against British residents of Paris. Despite his revolutionary sympathies, he was arrested on 18 November 1793; although released on this occasion, he eventually spent almost a year in confinement. During his own incarceration (from December 1793 to November 1794), Thomas Paine was sustained by the correspondence which Lady Smyth initiated with him (from &#145;the Castle in the Air&#146; [Paine] to &#145;My Little Corner of the World&#146; [Charlotte Smyth],  (Yorke, 2.366)). This &#145;extremely beautiful correspondence&#146; became &#145;half the world&#146; to him, continuing, according to Yorke, &#145;without intermission&#146; until 1802  (ibid., 2.346). Paine's biographers have never reached a definitive conclusion about the exact nature of this intimacy.<br>
<br>In summer 1796 Paine stayed with the Smyths at Versailles when he helped Sir Robert secure a passport to enable him to travel to Hamburg to access funds from England. After Paine's return to America he recommended to Thomas Jefferson that he hire Smyth to help the Americans with their trade affairs. But such assistance was not all one-sided. Smyth consistently gave Paine moral and financial support, and was one of Paine's most frequent visitors when he was living with the Bonnevilles (1797&#150;1802). He was also a silent collaborator in Paine's <span class="italic">Decline and Fall of the English System of Finance</span> (1796), and forced the builders of the iron bridge over the River Wear at Sunderland (completed 1796) to acknowledge that they had relied on Paine's designs and his materials in its construction. Sir Robert Smyth died suddenly at Paris on 12 April 1802 &#145;of gout in his stomach&#146;, and was buried at Berechurch Hall, Essex. His wife died at Versailles in 1823. The baronetcy was inherited by Smyth's son, George Henry, and became extinct at his death in 1852.<br>
