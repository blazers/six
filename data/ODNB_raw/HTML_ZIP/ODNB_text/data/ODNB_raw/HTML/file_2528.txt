</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blackmore, Sir  Richard</span>  (1654&#150;1729), <span class="occ">physician and writer</span>, was born on 22 January 1654 at Corsham, Wiltshire, the third of the four children of Robert Blackmore (<i>d</i>. 1681), a wealthy attorney, and Anne Pilsworth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harris (<i>fl</i>. 1633&#150;1676), widow of Edward Pilsworth. According to Giles Jacob, Blackmore was educated at a country school and then at Westminster School for a brief period. On 19 March 1669 he matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, where he took his BA on 4 April 1674 and MA on 3 June 1676. He continued as tutor at St Edmund Hall and perhaps worked for some time as a schoolmaster.<br>
<br>The year after his father's death Blackmore went to the continent. He first stayed in France, then moved to Geneva, where he composed his first literary work: a Latin epitaph for Thomas Bent, a fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford. From there he went to Italy, where he visited Rome, Venice, and Padua. In Padua he stopped to study medicine at the local university, where he graduated doctor of pure medicine on 24 March 1684. He then returned to England via Germany and Holland, and settled in London to start practice. On 9 February 1685 Blackmore married Mary Adams (<i>d</i>. 1728), who was related to an important whig family, the Verneys of Claydon House, Buckinghamshire, who probably helped him in his career. On 12 April 1687, at the <i>comitia majora extraordinaria</i>, Blackmore was admitted as a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. His relationship with the college was turbulent: he was censured for leave-taking without permission and had strong disagreements with the president and the majority of the college, principally over the project to establish a dispensary to provide free drugs for the London poor, something which Blackmore opposed vehemently.<br>
<br>In 1695 Blackmore published <span class="italic">Prince Arthur: an Heroick Poem in Ten Books</span>, which he stated he had written with the aim of reforming contemporary poetry from the immorality and impiety of the age. The poem, modelled on Virgil's <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> and based on Geoffrey of Monmouth's <span class="italic">Historia regum Britanniae</span>, narrates Arthur's defence of the Britons against the usurping Saxons and his final conquest of London. It displays a transparent political allegory, with the pious Arthur representing William III and his ungodly antagonist symbolizing James II. Despite the severe criticism by John Dennis, who in his <span class="italic">Remarks on a Book Entitled Prince Arthur</span> (1696) reproved Blackmore's &#145;servile&#146; imitation of Virgil, the tedious digressiveness of the plot, and the inconsequency of its &#145;fearful&#146; hero, the poem sold well, reaching a third edition.<br>
<br>King William, who had appointed Blackmore as one of his physicians-in-ordinary, was so pleased with the poem as to present him with a medal of gold and then to knight him on 18 March 1697. Blackmore, who always manifested his attachment to the king and the revolution  (TNA: PRO, C.213/168, chancery: petty bag office, association oath rolls, College of Physicians, London, 1696), was chosen to write the story of Sir George Barclay's plot to murder the king (which was published only in 1723 as <span class="italic">A true and impartial history of the conspiracy against the person and government of King William III, of glorious memory, in the year 1695</span>). In 1697 a sequel to his first poem appeared, <span class="italic">King Arthur: an Heroic Poem in Twelve Books</span>, which continued the allegorical treatment of contemporary events with a Virgilian structure and a Miltonic diction; in its preface, however, Blackmore acknowledged the defects of his former epic, rejecting Aristotelian &#145;rules&#146; for a more sublime style. The poem was greeted with less enthusiasm than <span class="italic">Prince Arthur</span> and did not go into any further editions.<br>
<br>Blackmore was made the object of ridicule and lampoons by the wits he had chastised for their impiety and by the Dispensarians (particularly virulent was Sir Samuel Garth's attack in his <span class="italic">The Dispensary</span>, 1699), and he decided to retort with the poem <span class="italic">A Satyr against Wit</span> (1700). The wits, led by Tom Brown, made things worse with the publication of the mocking <span class="italic">Commendatory Verses, on the Author of the Two Arthurs, and the Satyr against Wit</span> (1700). Blackmore, who in the meantime was engaged in his <span class="italic">Paraphrase on the Book of Job</span> (1700), a Christian epic with a virtuous and peaceful hero, saw the assault rebutted by his supporters' <span class="italic">Discommendatory Verses, on those which are Truly Commendatory, on the Author of the Two Arthurs, and the Satyr against Wit</span> (1700). The attacks on Blackmore were further exacerbated when John Dryden accused him of plagiarism of his own project of an Arthurian epic. Dryden described Blackmore (who had offensively portrayed him in <span class="italic">Prince Arthur</span> and in the <span class="italic">Satyr against Wit</span>) as a &#145;Pedant, Canting Preacher, and a Quack&#146; who wrote while travelling from patient to patient, &#145;to the rumbling of his Coaches Wheels&#146;  (J. Dryden, prologue to <span class="italic">The Pilgrim</span>, 1700, 42, 49). The wits sneered at the &#145;City Bard&#146; and &#145;Cheapside Knight&#146;, as they labelled Blackmore on account of his residence in Cheapside, both as a poet and a physician who &#145;killed&#146; his victims with his verses and his pills. This trite stricture aside, Blackmore was considered one of the leaders of the medical profession and his skills were commended by his contemporaries, notably by John Locke. As a physician-in-ordinary to King William (whom he assisted until his death) Blackmore was entitled to a lodging at Hampton Court and to a salary of &pound;100 per half year  (TNA: PRO, T. 61/16/78). He later held the same post to Queen Anne.<br>
<br>Despite the wits' assault, in 1705 Blackmore published one more epic, <span class="italic">Eliza: an Epic Poem in Ten Books</span>, a poem on the Spanish (that is, Popish) conspiracies against Elizabeth and protestantism (Anne and the Church of England). Samuel Johnson stated that <span class="italic">Eliza</span> &#145;dropped, as it seems, dead-born from the press&#146;  (Johnson, <span class="italic">Poets</span>, 3.81), but the poem did not pass unobserved, for its sardonic portrayal of Roderigo Lopez, the Portuguese physician who made an attempt on Elizabeth's life, was an allegory of John Radcliffe, the eminent physician who was suspected of Jacobite inclinations and had alienated the sympathies of the queen. Blackmore celebrated Queen Anne in her triumphant campaigns in the War of the Spanish Succession, with the long poem <span class="italic">An advice to the poets: a poem occasioned by the wonderful success of her majesty's arms, under the conduct of the duke of Marlborough in Flanders</span> (1706), and the <span class="italic">Instructions to Vander Bank, a sequel to the Advice to the poets: a poem, occasion'd by the glorious success of her majesty's arms, under the command of the duke of Marlborough, the last year in Flanders</span> (1709). In 1711 appeared <span class="italic">The Nature of Man</span>, a physico-theological poem about the effects of climate on man's intellectual faculties, and a tribute to English prosperity and constitutional freedom. It was followed in 1712 by another physico-theological work, <span class="italic">Creation: a Philosophical Poem</span>, which was highly praised for its lofty, Miltonic style by Dennis, Addison, and, later, by Johnson, who included it in his edition of the English poets. The poem, which was acclaimed as the English <span class="italic">De rerum natura</span> and went through sixteen editions, becoming the most popular of Blackmore's works, is a confutation of the atomistic theories of Epicurus and his modern followers, and a vindication of the operations of divine providence.<br>
<br>On 13 November 1713 Blackmore and his friend John Hughes started <span class="italic">The Lay-Monk</span>, published every third week, and which followed the example of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> and <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>. It ceased publication on 15 February 1714, after forty numbers, subsequently collected as <span class="italic">The Lay-Monastery</span> (1714). With the accession of the Hanoverians, Blackmore was no longer summoned to court as physician-in-ordinary, yet his medical career was still successful: in 1716 the College of Physicians made him censor and, on 22 August 1716, selected him as one of the eight elects, the college's ruling body. Meanwhile he moved residence from Cheapside to Earls Court, Kensington. In 1716 and 1717 Blackmore published two volumes of <span class="italic">Essays upon Several Subjects</span> (on topics ranging from the immortality of the soul to the origin of civil power). The second volume contained a tirade against Alexander Pope's blasphemous parody of the first psalm of David, which had been surreptitiously printed by the hack publisher Edmund Curll. A feud between Blackmore and Pope started and never really ended, though it remained mostly at a literary level. Blackmore became one of the main butts of Pope and his Scriblerian friends, who castigated him as poet in <span class="italic">The Dunciad</span> (1728, 2.247&#150;56), and scoffed at his bombastic verses in the mock treatise <span class="italic">Peri Bathous: of the Art of Sinking in Poetry</span> (1727). In 1718 <span class="italic">A Collection of Poems on Various Subjects</span> appeared, containing many of Blackmore's previously published shorter poems and a few new ones.<br>
<br>In 1721 Blackmore published a religious treatise, <span class="italic">Just Prejudices against the Arian Hypothesis</span>, written &#145;in the Defence of God's Existence against the Atheist; and in Vindication of the Christian Religion against the Deist; and of the Divinity of Christ against the Arian and Socinian&#146;  (p. 11). It was immediately followed by a sequel, <span class="italic">Modern Arians Unmasked</span> (1721). Blackmore had always been a supporter of the established church: he was a member of the vestry in the parishes of St Vedast, Foster Lane, and St Michael Le Quern, London, where he also served as a verger, and in 1704 was made one of the vice-presidents of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in America. In 1721 he published <span class="italic">A New Version of the Psalms of David</span>, which he strove ineffectually to have adopted in the church. In 1724 the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel undertook to print a selection of Blackmore's psalms, which however never came to press because of the opposition of the bishop of London. Blackmore was not discouraged in his zealous fight for the reformation of the age, and in 1722 sent to the press <span class="italic">Redemption</span>, a poem on the divinity of Christ, against the Arian hypothesis.<br>
<br>On 22 October 1722, after leaving Kensington to retire to Boxted, Essex, Blackmore resigned his position as an elect of the College of Physicians. In 1723 his last epic poem, <span class="italic">Alfred</span>, appeared, which he dedicated to Prince Frederick of Hanover with the aim of instilling in him &#145;just Ideas of political Prudence, and &hellip; an honourable Ambition of becoming a publick Blessing&#146;  (sig. a2<i>r</i>). The poem failed to win him the attention of the court and went unnoticed by the public. Far from the London crowd, in his Boxted retirement, Blackmore dedicated the last years of his life to the writing of various medical treatises, on the plague (1720), the smallpox (1722), consumption, the gout, dropsy (1727), and the spleen. They are imbued with a religious zeal against atheistic and heretic conceptions and earnestly advocate a pragmatic and anti-academic approach to medicine; Blackmore wrote in English instead of Latin to preserve &#145;the true Dignity and Worth of Physick &hellip; as much as can be [from] Philosophical Notions and Scholastick Darkness&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Treatise of Consumptions and other Distempers Belonging to the Breast and Lungs</span>, 1724, xi). Blackmore was a follower of Sir Thomas Sydenham and stressed the importance of experience and observation over pure speculation and erudition, the &#145;extensive Mechanical Knowledge of Books &hellip; that is call'd Misteria Literaria&#146;  (<span class="italic">Discourse on the Gout, a Rheumatism, and the King's Evil</span>, 1726, xxxvii). His strenuous empiricism made him reject the Galenic theory of the four humours, as well as other medical schools based on hypothetical conjecture. He was particularly attracted to the subject of the spleen, to which he had already devoted one of his <span class="italic">Essays on Various Subjects</span>, and which he investigated in <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours</span> and <span class="italic">A Critical Dissertation upon the Spleen</span> (both 1725). In 1728 he published one more religious treatise, <span class="italic">Natural Theology, or, Moral Duties Consider'd apart from Positive</span>.<br>
<br>Blackmore, who in later life suffered from colic, died at Boxted, Essex, on 9 October 1729 and was buried at the parish church there, where a monumental inscription to his memory was erected. His last work, <span class="italic">The Accomplished Preacher</span>, was posthumously published by his literary executor, the Revd John White of Nayland, Essex, in 1731.<br>
