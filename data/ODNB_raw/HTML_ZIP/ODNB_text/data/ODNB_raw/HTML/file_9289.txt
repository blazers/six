<span class="headword">Fenner,  George</span>  (<em>c.</em>1540&#150;1618), <span class="occ">merchant and privateer</span>, is of unknown parentage. However, the name Fenner was common in west Sussex, and the family into which he was born has been described variously as a mercantile clan in Chichester itself, or as a minor but armigerous gentry family based at West Wittering. It is quite possible that the two were identical, because George Fenner clearly began his career as a trader, and the manor of Earnley was held by a man of that name from 1561 to 1564. There were four Fenners at sea as captains during Elizabeth's reign&#151;Edward, George, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9290/', "Thomas Fenner")</script>, and William&#151;and the <span class="roman">Victoria county history</span> describes them as brothers. However, the evidence for this is insecure, and it seems more likely that they were cousins.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of George Fenner's early life or education, but he was certainly literate, as became a man of his status, and several years of conventional schooling can be assumed. He first appears in public in 1566, when along with Edward he took three ships and a pinnace to the Guinea coast, and became embroiled in a sharp skirmish with several Portuguese men-of-war. By this time he was clearly a seafarer of some experience, but how he obtained that experience is not known. In October of the same year he was included along with John Hawkins in the ban against trafficking to the domains of the king of Spain, and bonds were taken of him for that reason. In 1570, describing himself as &#145;George Fenner of Chichester&#146;, he petitioned the council for redress against the Spaniards for ships allegedly seized by them in the Low Countries. Like many others, Fenner chose to regard this grievance as a licence to plunder on his own behalf. In 1572 he appears to have been attacking Spanish shipping in the Azores, but with what success is not clear. In July 1575 he again petitioned the council for redress, but it is not certain whether his petition referred to his original grievance, or to a new one. His reprisal targets seem to have been rather indiscriminate, because later in the same year he was in trouble for having brought two captured French ships into Portsmouth. Nine years later, in September 1584, he was complaining that the French had seized a ship of his at Le Havre, and an inquiry was set up at Chichester. The outcome is not known, but the circumstances suggest that Fenner continued to be an active trader and part-time pirate throughout these years.<br>
<br>In the Armada campaign Fenner commanded the galleon <i>Leicester</i> with credit but no particular distinction. However, he appears to have earned the good opinion of Lord Admiral Howard, with whom he served in 1591 and again in 1593. He also captained Howard's ship the <i>Disdain</i> on a privateering venture in 1589, taking several prizes. In 1597 he accompanied the earl of Essex on the &#145;islands&#146; voyage, and was later sent out in the <i>Dreadnaught</i>, which was a royal ship, against Spinola's galleys in the channel. His last recorded service was again with Howard, in July 1599. By that time he was becoming old, and may well have retired from the sea. Nothing is known of his domestic circumstances, but the fact that he was admitted as a brother (pensioner) of the newly founded Sutton's Hospital in the London Charterhouse in 1614 suggests that he may have had no immediate family. He died at the Charterhouse on 26 October 1618, and was buried in the chapel.<br>
