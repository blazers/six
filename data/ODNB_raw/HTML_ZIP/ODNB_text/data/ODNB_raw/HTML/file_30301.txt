</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Zouche,  Edward  la</span>, eleventh Baron Zouche  (1556&#150;1625), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was born on 6 June 1556, at Harringworth, Northamptonshire, the only son of George la Zouche, tenth Baron Zouche of Harringworth (<i>c</i>.1526&#150;1569), landowner, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. in or after 1569), daughter and coheir of William Welby of Molton, Lincolnshire. He succeeded as eleventh Lord Zouche on the death of his father on 30 June 1569. The main estates were concentrated in Northamptonshire. As a minor, Zouche became the ward of Sir William Cecil, principal secretary, who entrusted his education to John Whitgift, master of Trinity College, Cambridge. Zouche matriculated there in Easter 1570, and gained an MA in 1571.<br>
<br>Zouche was summoned to parliament on 2 April 1571, but as a minor he did not take his seat for some years. Subsequently he said &#145;the greatest evil hath been the fond spending of my time in my youth&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/239, fol. 156<i>r</i>). In 1575 he quarrelled with Roger North, second Baron North, and on 12 February 1576 both peers were summoned before the privy council and bound over to keep the peace. He married his cousin Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1611), daughter of Sir John Zouche of Codnor, Derbyshire, and his wife, Eleanor, about 1578. Relations with his wife were not cordial and the couple were estranged in 1582. He put her away without an allowance and was sued in the ecclesiastical court for support. Sentenced to pay &pound;2 10<i>s</i>. per week, he refused, was excommunicated, and went abroad before returning to abide by the orders of the court. According to Sir John Holles, while Lady Zouche was &#145;oft dangerously sick &hellip; he [Lord Zouche] never disbursed a penny, and now dead she might have rotted in her chamber as he would have buried her&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 9.83&#150;4). The couple had two daughters, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1617) and Mary (<i>d</i>. 1652).<br>
<br>While abroad, Zouche became interested in diplomatic service, perhaps when he travelled in Scotland. He was appointed one of the peers to try Mary, queen of Scots, at Fotheringhay Castle, Northamptonshire, in 1586, and in the following year he returned to the continent, partly to qualify himself for public service, and partly to advance and enrich his education. He went by sea to Hamburg in March 1587, and then to Heidelberg and Frankfurt. In April 1588 he was at Basel, and in 1590 at Altdorf he met Sir Henry Wotton, with whom he corresponded frequently. In August 1591 Zouche was living in Vienna. He then proceeded to Verona, but in 1593 returned to England.<br>
<br>Zouche's diplomatic career was launched on 22 December 1593, when he was sent as envoy-extraordinary to James VI of Scotland to protest against his leniency towards George Gordon, first marquess of Huntly, Francis Hay, ninth earl of Erroll, and William Douglas, tenth earl of Angus, who were known to be in league with Spain, and to inform him that Elizabeth I would resist with military force the landing of any Spanish troops in Scotland. He had an audience with James on 15 January 1594, urging him to take vigorous action against the Spanish faction in Scotland. Unsuccessful, he asked to be sent home. Returning in the following April, he had no better success. In June 1598 Zouche was sent on a commercial mission to Denmark with Sir Christopher Perkins, who had served several times as envoy to the Danish court and was selected to accompany him.<br>
<br>These missions did nothing to restore Zouche's private fortunes, and in December 1599 he begged Sir Robert Cecil, principal secretary, for a public office. The result was an appointment in August 1600 to a place where he could &#145;live cheaply&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 9.302), the island of Guernsey, where he acted as deputy governor. He seems to have enjoyed life there and patronized Thomas Cartwright. His tenure, however, was short-lived. In June 1602 he was appointed president of the council of Wales and the marches, probably through Cecil's influence.<br>
<br>Zouche arrived at Ludlow on 13 August, sorry to leave the warmer Channel Islands. The situation in the marches was disordered and he set out to resolve the defects of the council and the court. His task was made more difficult because of the entrenched interests of the officials, who &#145;resented the intrusion of a lay nobleman&#146;  (Williams, 304). Shocked at the state of affairs, he wrote that Wales and the border shires were &#145;stuffed with Papists&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 15.17). Trying to take control of the region at the expense of local interests, he exercised his authority &#145;soe muche that his jurisdiction is allready brought in question&#146;  (Manningham, 95). Later, John Chamberlain wrote that &#145;Lord Zouche plays <i>rex</i> in Wales &hellip; with the council and justices, as also with the poor Welchmen&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1601&#150;3</i>, 249). Zouche continued in office under James, who made him grants of land worth &pound;80 a year in 1604, and continued to reward him in subsequent years.<br>
<br>Zouche was sworn of the privy council on 11 May 1603, shortly after James first arrived in London. He served on various commissions over the next twenty years. The most prominent dealt with France, in July 1610, the treasury, in June 1612, Flushing and Brill, in May 1616, abuses in the treasury, in July 1618, ecclesiastical causes, in April 1620, and defective land titles, in June 1622. He was one of the first councillors for the Virginia Company, from May 1609, and the New England Company, from November 1620, and was sworn of the Scottish privy council in June 1617. Lady Zouche died early in 1611 and was buried at Heanor, Derbyshire, on 3 April. By October of that year Zouche had married Sarah (<i>c</i>.1566&#150;1629), daughter of Sir James Harrington of Exton, Rutland, and his wife, Lucy, and widow of Sir George Kingsmill, justice of the common pleas, and of Francis Hastings, Baron Hastings.<br>
<br>After the death of the earl of Salisbury (Cecil) in 1612, Zouche supported anti-Spanish interests among the English privy council against the king's favourite, Robert Carr, earl of Somerset. The distinguished botanist Mathias de L'Obel, a guest in Zouche's household, learned, through his friend Dr John Nasmith, James's chief surgeon, of attempts to poison Somerset's secretary, Sir Thomas Overbury. Zouche was caught up in the resulting court intrigue. His friendship with Thomas Egerton, Baron Ellesmere, lord chancellor, and George Abbot, archbishop of Canterbury, allowed the anti-Spanish interests at court and in the privy council to discover the plot and oust the Spanish faction from the king's favour. Appointed a commissioner in September 1615 to assist Sir Edward Coke, chief justice of the king's bench, in his investigation of the affair, it was said that Zouche was chosen because he was &#145;a man void of all partiality&#146;  (Molyneaux, 75).<br>
<br>Zouche was also engaged in these years in his new position as lord warden of the Cinque Ports. He was appointed in July 1615 at the nomination of Abbot, who promoted him to thwart Somerset's nominee on behalf of the pro-Spanish interests. The Cinque Port burgesses (or &#145;barons&#146;) elected to the House of Commons for the seven ports were under the patronage of the lord warden as constable of Dover Castle and sheriff for the ports. The growing economic decay of the ports increased Zouche's patronage in parliament and at court because the interests of, and therefore the ability of, the burgesses to interfere were diminishing too, which enabled him to extract greater electoral influence. Zouche became very successful in obtaining the placement of his nominees. As lord warden from 1615 to 1624, in the elections of 1621 and 1624 he placed twenty of the twenty-eight seats in the face of pressure from George Villiers, first duke of Buckingham, and the boroughs, the highest number ever obtained in the early Stuart period. His success was due in part to his strong advocacy of the independence and privileges of the port towns. He maintained a steady correspondence, promoting their custumals, economic interests, Dover harbour, and the channel passage. When these were challenged at court in 1621, he defended them vigorously. His relationship with the port towns, however, was reciprocal: he did not interfere with their business nor demand control of their votes in the Commons. He held the wardenship of the Cinque Ports until 17 July 1624, when ill health and Buckingham's persuasions, reinforced by a grant of &pound;1000 and a pension of &pound;500, induced him to resign the office, which was bestowed upon the duke himself.<br>
<br>Zouche's major intellectual interests were history, literature, and mathematics. His literary friends included Sir Henry Wotton, Ben Jonson, and William Browne. Wotton, a lifelong friend, collected books, manuscripts, and paintings for him as well as reports on news and life on the continent. Zouche's cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30302/', "Richard Zouche")</script> dedicated to him <span class="italic">The Dove, or, Passages of Cosmography</span> (1613). Claude Holyband dedicated <span class="italic">A Dictionaire French and English</span> (1593) to him and he was also the dedicatee of the first part of William Browne's <span class="italic">Britannia's Pastorals</span> (1613).<br>
<br>The reduction of Zouche's wealth and patrimony was due largely to his passion for horticulture. He spent considerable sums on gardens, cultivating a &#145;physic-garden&#146; in Hackney, Middlesex, and was a friend of the herbalist John Gerard. L'Obel superintended this garden, accompanied Zouche on his embassy to Denmark in 1598, and dedicated to him his <span class="italic">Pharmaceuticam officinam animadversiones</span> (1605). Zouche spent most of his later years at Bramshill House, Hampshire, where he styled himself &#145;Lord Souch, Saint Maure and Cantelupe&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/146, sig. 101). Besides designing the house, he also designed the gardens. A keen collector of shrubs and trees, he imported Scottish firs. His garden at Hackney was full of plants which he obtained on his foreign travels in the 1580s and 1590s.<br>
<br>It was at Bramshill that Abbot accidentally shot and killed Zouche's warden Peter Hawkins in July 1621, mistaking him for a deer. Abbot was there to consecrate the new chapel. A royal commission found Hawkins's death was the result of accidental homicide, and Abbot was granted a dispensation. Despite this, the archbishop's career was effectively over, paving the way for William Laud. The event marked the waning influence of the anti-Spanish interests on the privy council and the subsequent political decline of Zouche. None the less, he maintained his ties with Edward Russell, third earl of Bedford, William Stanley, sixth earl of Derby, William Herbert, third earl of Pembroke, and Henry Wriothesley, third earl of Southampton, because of his lineage, offices, politics, and religion. His religious zeal for the protestant faith was exhibited in his will.<br>
<br>Zouche's closest relation was Sir Edward Zouche, who was known as Edmund and was the son of John Zouche of Ansty, Wiltshire. He was the main benefactor of Zouche's will, and called &#145;the son of him I loved best in life (except the lord Grey of Wilton)&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/146, sig. 101). Lady Zouche had to employ lawyers to secure her share of the estate. Zouche's lifelong estate steward and servant, William Randolph (father of Thomas Randolph, poet and dramatist, and half-brother of William Randolph, the Virginia colonist) benefited also.<br>
<br>Zouche died on 18 August 1625 at Bramshill, and was buried the next day in the family vault at Eversley, Hampshire. The fact that this vault was connected with Zouche's wine cellar provoked from Jonson the lines:<blockquote>
<div>Wherever I die, oh, here may I lie,<br>
</div>
<div>Along by my good Lord Zouche,<br>
</div>
<div>That when I am dry, to the tap I may hie,<br>
</div>
<div>And so back again to my couch.<br>
</div> (Herford, Simpson, and Simpson, 8.444)</blockquote>Lady Zouche married Sir Thomas Edmondes on 11 September 1626. Since Zouche did not have any sons his baronies fell into abeyance between the heirs of his daughters.<br>
