<span class="headword">Walters,  Edward</span>  (1808&#150;1872), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in December 1808 at 11 Fenchurch Buildings, London, the residence and office of his father, John Walters (1782&#150;1821), architect. His mother was a sister of the architect Edward I'Anson the elder (with whom John Walters had studied under Daniel Alexander). Walters was educated at Brighton, and shortly after his father's early death in 1821 he entered, without articles, the office of Isaac Clarke, one of his father's pupils. Three years' training with Clarke was followed successively by engagements under the renowned builder Thomas Cubitt, the architect Lewis Vulliamy (with whom Owen Jones was a student at the time), the surveyor and architect John Wallen, and finally the civil engineer Sir John Rennie.<br>
<br>In March 1832 Walters was sent by Rennie to Constantinople to superintend construction of a small-arms factory and other works for the Turkish government. While there he made the acquaintance of W. H. Barlow, engineer to the Midland Railway, with whom he subsequently collaborated in various works in England. In Turkey Walters made plans for a palace for the sultan (unbuilt) and at the same time became a friend of Richard Cobden, who was then staying in Constantinople.<br>
<br>Walters left Turkey in 1837, and made a journey through Italy, Sicily, and France with Barlow, before returning to England in January 1838. In 1839, on Cobden's advice, he established an architectural practice at 20 (later 24) Cooper Street in Manchester. One of his earliest works was a warehouse for Cobden at 16 Mosley Street. Other early works included schools, suburban residences, and chapels in a modest Gothic style, for example, in 1842, Granby Row Church. He gained attention with Oakwood Hall, near Stockport, a Tudor-style mansion, for Ormerod Heyworth, and St Andrew's Free Church at the corner of Grosvenor Square and Oxford Street in 1840. In 1851 Walters was brought prominence by his design for the warehouse at the angle of Aytoun Street and Portland Street for Messrs Brown &amp; Co., which initiated the fashion of building Manchester warehouses in the style of the Italian Renaissance. <span class="italic">The Builder</span> considered the palazzo style appropriate as warehouses were not merely store-places for heavy goods but also commodity &#145;emporia&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 16, 1858, 97). Until 1860 he was the pre-eminent architect of the town, with a prolific practice that included warehouses, residences, banks, and chapels  (listed in <span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 30, 1872 201).<br>
<br>Walters's most renowned works were the Free Trade Hall (1853&#150;6) and the Manchester and Salford Bank in Mosley Street (1860). His design for the Free Trade Hall was chosen in a limited competition, and is a fine example of the palazzo type, much praised and illustrated at the time  (see <span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 14, 1856, 526; and 71, 1896, 380). Its cost (&pound;25,000) was raised by subscription, and the contemporary author T. R. Smith praised its acoustic properties in <span class="italic">A Rudimentary Treatise on the Acoustics of Public Buildings</span> (1861). It was partly reconstructed by L. C. Howitt (1896&#150;1964) in 1950&#150;51, following war damage but suffered more damage by an IRA bomb in 1996.<br>
<br>In 1860 Walters unsuccessfully submitted a design in the Manchester assize courts competition, and between 1860 and 1865 he reduced his practice. In the 1860s he joined Barlow in laying out the railway between Ambergate and Manchester, and designed many of the stations, the most successful being those at Bakewell and Miller's Dale; he also worked with his former pupils Barker and Ellis, by whom his practice was continued after his retirement in 1865.<br>
<br>Though Walters worked in Gothic at the opening of his career, his most successful works were in a Renaissance style. Contemporaries and later commentators  (Pevsner, <span class="italic">Lancashire</span>, 282) praised his original and careful adaptation of the Renaissance palazzo to large-scale buildings and the dull Manchester climate. <span class="italic">The Builder</span> praised his buildings for &#145;the grouping of principal and subordinate features, for the manner of overcoming difficulties of numerous stories and closely set windows, &hellip; for the &hellip; mouldings, and the invention in details&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 16, 1858, 97).<br>
<br>After Walters's retirement in 1865 he travelled in England and Italy. He died at 11 Oriental Place, Brighton, on 22 January 1872. He was remembered as &#145;a singularly modest&#146; man &#145;with social qualities of the highest order&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 30, 1872, 200). He never married.<br>
