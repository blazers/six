<span class="headword">Streater,  Robert</span>  (1621&#150;1679), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in London&#151;in Covent Garden according to Vertue, but more probably in Cripplegate&#151;and was baptized on 16 December 1621. He was the third and youngest son of Robert Streeter, painter, of St Giles, Cripplegate, and his second wife. By 1640 the family had moved to Long Acre, near Covent Garden, where the younger Robert lived throughout his adult life. He allegedly trained abroad with one Du Moulin but was in England by 1658, where he specialized in large-scale architectural and decorative paintings. In early 1662 Streater, describing himself as the &#145;King's Painter&#146;, petitioned Charles II for permission to build a house in Long Acre. Appointed sergeant-painter by the king in the following year, he worked from 1664 to 1672 on the decoration of royal carriages and of the queen's barges.<br>
<br>Streater excelled in the use of perspective and foreshortening. George Vertue called him:<blockquote>a compleat Master therein, as also in other Arts of Etching, Graving, and his works of Architecture and Perspective, not a line but is true to the Rules of Art and Symmetry (and in all kind of Paintings&#151;see Streeters most exact &amp; rare Landskips in Oyl. (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 4.31)</blockquote>In 1660 William Russell, seventh earl of Bedford, bought a Streater landscape for his bedroom. The artist's only known topographical landscape is his <span class="italic">View of Boscobel, with the Royal Oak</span> (<i>c</i>.1660?; Royal Collection), attributed to Streater, along with six other works, four of them landscapes, in <span class="italic">A Catalogue of the Collection of Pictures, etc. Belonging to King James the Second</span> (1758).<br>
<br>Streater was noted for his illusionistic painted &#145;perspectives&#146; (decorations). In 1664 Evelyn described one, painted in the court of Mr Povey's house in Lincoln's Inn Fields, as &#145;indeede excellent, with the Vasas [vases] in Imitation of <i>Porphyrie</i>; &amp; fountaine&#146;  (Evelyn, 3.375, 1 July 1664). On 1 February 1669 Samuel Pepys visited &#145;Mr. Streater, the famous history-painter&#146;, finding the architect Christopher Wren and &#145;other virtuosos looking upon the paintings he is making of the new theatre at Oxford&#146;  (Pepys, 9.434). This was Streater's ceiling painting for Wren's Sheldonian Theatre, Oxford, a spectacular allegory painted in oil on canvas. Streater depicted a red awning (like those thought to have been used in the ancient Roman theatres that inspired Wren's architecture) being rolled back to reveal <span class="italic">Truth Descending on the Arts and Sciences</span> and <span class="italic">Envy, Rapine and Ignorance Overcome by Minerva, Hercules and Mercury</span>. The ceiling's allegorical figures were listed by Robert Whitehall in his poem <span class="italic">Urania, or, A description of the painting of the top of the theater at Oxford as the artist laid his design</span> (1669); they include Mosaical Law, the Gospel, History, Divine Poesy, Mathematics, Astronomy, Geography, Architecture, Rhetoric, Law, Justice, Physic, Logic, Printing, and Truth, and the poem concludes:<blockquote>
<div>That future ages must confess they owe<br>
</div>
<div>to Streeter more than Michael Angelo.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Streater also painted a <span class="italic">Last Judgment</span>, in the chapel at All Souls College, Oxford, in 1661&#150;5 (repainted by Sir James Thornhill but recorded in Ackermann's <span class="italic">History of Oxford</span>, 1814). He worked for Wren on thirteen City churches in London but little remains of his work apart from the Sheldonian ceiling, an altarpiece for the church of St Benet Fink, panels of Moses and of Aaron, and a ceiling at St Michael Cornhill, London (reused at the Old Rectory, Great Waldingfield, Sudbury, in Gloucestershire). His ceilings for Whitehall Palace, London, and scenery for Dryden's <span class="italic">Conquest of Granada</span> at the Whitehall Theatre were destroyed by fire. In 1672 Evelyn recorded Sir Robert Clayton's dining-room decorations (later removed to Marden, near Godstone, Surrey): &#145;the history of the Gyants War, incomparably done by Mr. Streeter, but the figures are too near the eye&#146;  (Evelyn, 4.625). Evelyn saw fine works by Streater in 1679 at Mr Boone's (or Bohun's) house, Lee Place, Blackheath (pulled down in 1825).<br>
<br>Streater also painted portraits, including <span class="italic">Sir Francis Prujean, M.D.</span> (1662; Royal College of Physicians, London). He was commissioned by the second earl of Chesterfield to paint <span class="italic">Mucius Scaevola</span> and <span class="italic">Rinaldo</span>, and according to Vertue painted a small <span class="italic">Jupiter upon the Rock</span>. His works, sold cheaply at auction following the death of his son on 13 December 1711, included a portrait of the actor Lacy, paintings of animals, still lifes, <span class="italic">Isaac and Rebecca</span>, <span class="italic">Abraham Sacrificing Isaac</span>, <span class="italic">The Nativity</span>, <span class="italic">The Vision of Jacob</span>, <span class="italic">St. Mary Magdalen</span>, and an architectural subject (for a fuller list see Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 2.70).<br>
<br>A gifted engraver, Streater engraved a self-portrait for Horace Walpole's <span class="italic">Anecdotes of Painting</span>, etched <span class="italic">View of the Battle of Naseby</span>, and designed a frontispiece and plates for Sir Robert Stapylton's <span class="italic">Satires of Juvenal</span> (1660), etched by Wenceslaus Hollar. His art collection included a sketch by Rubens of two children, for the Whitehall ceiling; an oil sketch by Sir Peter Lely for a <span class="italic">Holy Family</span>; H. van Steenwyck's <span class="italic">St Peter in Prison</span>; a large <span class="italic">St Sebastian</span> by Van Dyck; a <span class="italic">Hercules and Dejanira</span> by Benedetto Gennari; a &#145;limning&#146; by Lankrinck; and almost thirty still-life subjects by &#145;Vanzoon&#146;&#151;perhaps the Flemish flower-painter Jan Frans van Son (1658&#150;<i>c</i>.1718), husband of Streater's cousin.<br>
<br>Streater died in April 1679, following an operation for &#145;the stone&#146; by a surgeon summoned from Paris by Charles II. He was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 23 April. In his will, dated 28 March and proved on 12 May by his wife, Ruth, he left &pound;100 and land to his son Robert (<i>d</i>. 13 December 1711), who succeeded him as sergeant-painter; &pound;80 to his second son, Thomas (along with &pound;20 for Thomas's wife, the daughter of the Flemish artist Remigius van Leemput), and &pound;50 to his third son, Charles.<br>
