<span class="headword">Vaughan,  Richard</span>, second earl of Carbery  (1600?&#150;1686), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was the principal magnate of south-west Wales during the mid-seventeenth century, and its leading local royalist during the great civil war. He was the elder of two sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28133/', "John Vaughan (1574/5&#150;1634)")</script> of Golden Grove, Carmarthenshire (later first earl of Carbery), and his first wife, Margaret Meyrick, daughter of the soldier and courtier Sir Gelly Meyrick, and was probably born in 1600; the dearth of local records for this period makes it possible only to surmise the date of birth from later references to his age. It is known that he travelled to Spain in his youth, perhaps accompanying his father in the train of the prince of Wales in 1623. The first contemporary notices of him come with his elections to represent Carmarthenshire in the parliaments between 1624 and 1629. He was knighted at the coronation of Charles I in February 1626, and succeeded to the earldom on his father's death in 1634. On 15 February 1638 he was admitted a member of Gray's Inn. Carbery first married Bridget Lloyd, daughter of Thomas Lloyd of Llanll&#375;r, Cardiganshire. Neither the inception nor the end of the marriage can be dated, but she was dead by 8 August 1637, when he wed again. His new wife reflected his widening horizons, being Frances Altham (1620/21&#150;1650), daughter of Sir James Altham of Oxhey in Watford, Hertfordshire. She was the mother of Carbery's two sons, Francis (<i>d</i>. 1667), first husband of Lady Rachel Wriothesley, the future Lady Rachel Russell (1637&#150;1723), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28135/', "John Vaughan (bap. 1639, d. 1713)")</script>, who was to succeed his father as earl of Carbery.<br>
<br>The parliamentarian propagandist John Vicars called Carbery a man of &#145;pride and menacing insolencies&#146;  (John Vicars, <span class="italic">Magnalia Dei Anglicana, or, England's Parliamentary-Chronicle</span>, 4 parts, 1646, 2.177), but if this comment is not a mere reflection of partisan hostility then it can at least be said that his fiery character was not related to ambition; the very paucity of reference to him before the outbreak of civil war argues for an unusual lack of interest in national affairs. He played no part in the politics of the Short or Long parliaments, and at the opening of the war itself he was such a dark horse that parliament appointed him to execute its militia ordinance in Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire, while the king clearly trusted him likewise to act as his own most distinguished supporter in the region. It was Charles who was correct, but we have no trace of his actions until a regiment raised by him and led by his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28128/', "Henry Vaughan")</script> reached the royal army in January 1643. On 4 April, as part of the establishment of regional royalist commands, Carbery himself was commissioned lieutenant-general of the three south-western Welsh counties and instructed to secure them for the king's cause, with a system of county committees intended to provide him with the money and recruits for a local army. Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire were firmly royalist, but in Pembrokeshire the towns of Tenby and Pembroke contained a party sympathetic to parliament, and thus the new-made general certainly had work to do. He seems, however, to have preferred to observe an informal local truce; as the parliamentarians of those seaports did not trouble him, so he left them in peace, and both waited for the war to be resolved elsewhere.<br>
<br>This amicable situation was ended by Charles's truce with the Irish insurgents in September 1643, and his decision to withdraw the royal army in Ireland to reinforce the English royalists. The ports of Pembrokeshire were thus placed in a vital strategic position, perfectly positioned for use as parliamentarian bases to disrupt the flow of soldiers to the king, and their reduction by his supporters became an urgent matter. Carbery set about it on 18 August, as the armistice with the Irish seemed to be certain, by persuading most of the Pembrokeshire gentry to declare their intention of helping him to secure Tenby and Pembroke, and provide him with &pound;2000 towards any necessary military action. It seems likely that the earl was hoping that no such action would in fact be necessary, and that this show of strength would cow the ports into compliance; and this is what initially occurred. On 30 August the corporation of Tenby had declared for the king, and by 24 October that of Pembroke had done the same. Carbery appeared to have secured a total and bloodless victory, and was lavishly rewarded. On 24 October he was given an English peerage as Baron Vaughan of Emlyn and on 17 November he was commissioned governor of Milford Haven, a position which gave him direct military control of Pembroke and any outlying forts along the inlet leading to it. It may have been this commission which precipitated a rising among the parliamentarian zealots in Pembroke, led by John Poyer, who seized the port and made actual warfare inevitable at last.<br>
<br>Carbery himself had absolutely no experience of war, and no aptitude for it; nor did he have the services of a gifted veteran. In these circumstances he did his best, issuing a declaration on 11 January 1644 which called up the militia of his three counties to besiege Pembroke, and settled county rates to pay them. These forces were drawn into the towns and castles around Pembroke, and a new fort built across the Haven, and left to blockade the town into surrender, without risking a direct attack upon it. In the absence of siege guns or experienced soldiers this was probably all that he could have done, but the strategy underestimated the enterprise both of parliament and of its adherents in Pembroke. The former relieved the port with a naval squadron, and the latter included the sort of talented veteran whom Carbery lacked, in the person of Rowland Laugharne. On 22 February, reinforced by the sailors from the squadron, Laugharne commenced a series of assaults upon the royalist garrisons around Pembroke, and took them one after the other, including Tenby. Carbery's fatal mistake had been to keep no mobile force in reserve, and so he was unable to halt this process. By the end of March 1644 he had lost the whole of Pembrokeshire, and was recalled to the royal court at Oxford to account for the disaster. His departure&#151;and perhaps his leadership&#151;left the local royalists completely demoralized, and in April, Laugharne took possession of Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire as well, without resistance. Carbery had lost the entire region of his command.<br>
<br>At Oxford, Carbery was personally exonerated from blame, but it was obvious that he would have to surrender his commission to a proven soldier, so on 8 May 1644 he commenced his journey back to Wales as adviser to his replacement as commander in the south-west, Charles Gerard. After this he vanishes from view for the remainder of the war, apparently retiring to his seat at Golden Grove to sit it out. When Laugharne made a second, and final, conquest of Carmarthenshire in November 1645, parliament resolved that Carbery should be fined &pound;4500 for his former actions. He was, however, defended by Laugharne himself, who wrote to the speaker of the Commons on 18 November, explaining that the earl promised to be an eager and reliable collaborator and that his local standing would make him very useful to parliament in settling the region. Laugharne therefore requested that the fine be remitted. He was opposed by the Pembrokeshire county committee, which had more bitter memories of Carbery as a former opponent. The balance was tipped when the earl himself went to London to plead his case and to mobilize old and new friends in his behalf; Sir John Meyrick and the earl of Essex seem to have been especially influential in achieving the decision of the Commons to cancel the fine upon 16 February 1646. The formalities of this discharge were not completed until 9 April 1647, but after that he was safe.<br>
<br>Carbery repaid his new masters well, by his utter refusal to support the uprising against them in south Wales in April and May 1648, when his old enemies Poyer and Laugharne made common cause with most of the region's royalists and declared for the king. Whatever compelled his decision&#151;caution after his previous narrow escape or a disinclination to ally with former local foes&#151;it proved prudent, as the uprising was crushed while he continued inactive and undisturbed at Golden Grove. A local tale that he narrowly evaded capture by Cromwell, who was instead entertained and charmed by his wife, is a fiction. Throughout the interregnum he led a retired and comfortable life, achieving some vicarious literary fame as the patron of Jeremy Taylor. While a guest in his house, this Anglican divine published several of his most notable works, from <span class="italic">The Great Exemplar</span> (1649) to the collection of sermons published in 1655 under the title <span class="italic">Golden Grove</span>. Countess Frances died on 9 October 1650, leaving Carbery to make a last and most prestigious match in July 1652, with Lady Alice Egerton, eleventh and youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8587/', "John Egerton, first earl of Bridgewater (1579&#150;1649)")</script>. She was to outlive him by two and a half years, dying in July 1689.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Carbery was appointed president of the newly re-established council in the marches of Wales, an honour which reflected both his former services as a royalist leader and his status as the foremost resident Welsh peer. He carried out his duties with apparent diligence until 1672, when he was dismissed because of a public scandal concerning his alleged ill treatment, extending to physical mutilation, of servants and tenants on his estate at Dryslwyn, Carmarthenshire. The main legacy of his tenure of the presidency was a literary one, resulting from his patronage of Samuel Butler whom he made his secretary, and steward of Ludlow Castle, the seat of the council; it seems to have been there that Butler wrote the first part of <span class="italic">Hudibras</span>. After his disgrace Carbery slips from public view; he died on 3 December 1686, probably at Golden Grove, and is presumed to have been buried in Llandeilo Fawr parish church.<br>
<br>Carbery deserves some honour as a patron of letters and a conscientious administrator, but it is very clear that his contemporaries felt more respect for his social position than his personality. He never showed any interest in politics, and his role as a general was forced upon him and became one of the most inglorious of the civil war. His conduct in that war can be praised for prudence and realism rather than for any other virtues, and it is clear that his own taste was for a quiet life as a provincial nobleman; his part in national history may almost be described as accidental.<br>
