<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Roll,  Eric</span>, Baron Roll of Ipsden  (1907&#150;2005), <span class="occ">economist, public servant, and banker</span>, was born Erich Roll on 1 December 1907 in Nowosielitza, near Czernowitz, in the duchy of Bukowina, Austria, the younger son (there were no daughters) of Mathias Roll (1872&#150;1954), banker, and his wife, Fany, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Frendel (1878&#150;1934), daughter of a grain trader.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandacademiccareer"></a>Early years and academic career</h2>Roll was one of a remarkable group of men who emerged from the mayhem of pre-war central Europe to play key parts in Britain's economic and academic life after the Second World War. His parents were intellectuals and social democrats, who kept two huge German encyclopaedias in their dining room so that any argument over dinner could be instantly resolved. His early education was at the village school and at home; his mother was a trained teacher. Czernowitz, where the economist Joseph Schumpeter once taught, was at the meeting place of Austria, Romania, and Russia. It was to change nationality three times by the end of Roll's long life (finally becoming part of independent Ukraine in 1991). Roll's childhood was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War, during which his parents fled to Vienna, where Roll's schooling continued, at the Piaristenschule then the Piaristengymnasium. Back in Czernowitz, now part of Romania, he attended the Liceul Emanoil-Grigoroviza, where the language of his education switched from German to Romanian. He also learned French at school and English privately, including large passages of Shakespeare by heart.<br>
<br>In 1925 Roll left for Birmingham University. His father particularly admired Britain's social and political system and cultural climate. Roll expected to work in Romania's thriving oil industry, and enrolled in the school of oil engineering and refining, then the only one of its kind. However, he discovered he had little enthusiasm for chemistry and quickly switched to economics. He graduated BCom in 1928, then PhD two years later, finding time to win both the Gladstone memorial prize and ballroom dancing competitions. In 1930 his thesis, on the manufacturing and marketing of steam engines in Britain, 1775&#150;1800, became his first published book. His university days already revealed his enduring knack for accumulating a remarkable network of friends and acquaintances, many of whom either were or became distinguished figures in their field. Even before he had finished his first degree he took a motoring holiday with Hilary Marquand, a future Labour cabinet minister, and met the economists Austin and Joan Robinson.<br>
<br>Meanwhile the economy in central Europe was growing bleaker. In the spring of 1931 Roll became a British subject. From then on he saw himself as English. When Sir Denis Hamilton, editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, once asked him which language he dreamed in, Roll promptly replied, &#145;English&#146;. He later added, &#145;I make Shakespeare responsible for that. I've long concluded that the essence of national identity is language&#146;  (<span class="italic">Desert Island Discs</span>, Aug 2001). Roll's English was almost without accent&#151;as indeed were his French and German.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1930, and with the backing of John Maynard Keynes, Roll took a teaching post at the new University College of Hull under George Cyril Allen. When, three years later, Allen departed for University College, London, Roll was given the task of running the economics department, but it was two more years before he achieved the title (and salary) of professor of economics and commerce. Within his first few weeks at Hull he met Winifred (Freda) Taylor (1909&#150;1998) at a bus stop. The daughter of Elliott Taylor, a Yorkshire railway official, she was president of the students' union at Hull. She later recalled that they had looked so similar, both with fair hair and blue-grey eyes, that they were occasionally mistaken for brother and sister&#151;a confusion that occasionally proved useful during their four-year courtship. They married on 22 September 1934 at Sculcoates register office, and had two daughters, Joanna and Elizabeth.<br>
<br>In old age Roll still thought of himself as very much a product of the 1930s. As his parents had done in Czernowitz, he became part of a group of like-minded intellectuals in Hull. He was aghast at the economic impact of the depression. He and his wife organized relief work during the Spanish Civil War, and wrote and circulated a pamphlet attacking Britain's policy of appeasement. In the course of the 1930s he also produced two successful textbooks, one of which, <span class="italic">About Money</span> (1934), was extensively annotated by T. S. Eliot, one of the directors of Faber and Faber. He wrote his most famous book, <span class="italic">A History of Economic Thought</span> (1938), in the summer of 1938, dashing off the first draft in six weeks. He worked in the garden of a cottage in Wendens Ambo, near Cambridge, rented with Jacob Bronowski and Eirlys Roberts. With its accessible prose and its strong emphasis on Marx in the early editions, the book was initially disdained by other academic economists. However, it remained in print, in many languages and editions, earning good royalties throughout his life. Even in his mid-nineties Roll was wondering whether to write one more edition. In his final career, as a merchant banker, the book became his greatest passport to international eminence: finance ministers had frequently read the book and were flattered to meet its author.<br>
<br>In 1939, on a Rockefeller fellowship, Roll and his wife sailed for the United States, where they were to stay until 1946. He visited Harvard and Princeton and taught in Austin, Texas. &#145;You should have stayed,&#146; Lyndon Johnson said to him many years later. &#145;We might have made something of you&#146;  (E. Roll, 36). He also met a galaxy of up-and-coming economists, including J. K. Galbraith, Wassily Leontief, Fritz Machlup, Gottfried von Haberler, Paul Samuelson, and Robert Triffin. Not only were they part of a great flowering of economic thought; most were or became deeply involved with public policy. But within two years Roll's first career, as an academic, was effectively at an end and he had embarked upon the second, as a public servant with the British food mission in Washington.<h2>
<a name="Publicservice"></a>Public service</h2>J. K. Galbraith once described Roll as the most accomplished negotiator in public affairs in the post-war era  (Stormonth-Darling, 97). He arrived in Washington just before the signing of the <span class="roman">Lend-Lease Act</span>. He was plunged into the international politics of food and agriculture, and the problems caused by the chronic shortage of dollars&#151;two issues that were vital to the British war effort, and that continued to dominate the early years of the post-war era. Through them, Roll discovered the art that he later called &#145;alliance politics&#146;: how to conduct negotiations with a number of parties who shared the same basic objectives but operated under different constraints  (E. Roll, 40&#150;41). Linking international negotiations with the government machine was to be Roll's main task for the following two decades. It was the career of a diplomat, undertaken by an economist, working not in the Foreign Office but in one or another of Whitehall's economic ministries. He remained with the British food mission for five years, latterly as deputy.<br>
<br>In 1946, with his rather reluctant wife and two small daughters, Roll returned to Britain, which he had now come to regard as home. Urged by John Maynard Keynes, he decided to stay in the civil service. Almost immediately he was once more negotiating. This time it was the Marshall plan. Roll commuted to and from Paris initially as an assistant secretary in the Ministry of Food and later as an under-secretary in the Treasury, attached to the central economic planning staff, where he met many of those who were to dominate Whitehall in the 1960s and 1970s. He also became a close friend of Robert Marjolin, the first secretary general of the Organization for European Economic Co-operation, the body that would oversee the administration of Marshall aid.<br>
<br>Negotiations were sometimes hampered by a shortage of solid statistics. When this led Roll to complain to Whitehall about the difficulties of making bricks without straw, the reply was &#145;Goldman expert strawless brickmaker is on the way&#146;  (E. Roll, 54). On another occasion, delegates were requested at short notice to ask their capitals to fill out a detailed questionnaire on requirements for reconstruction. Roll found one delegate filling it out himself. &#145;I think I know better what to put in than they do back home&#146;, he said. Another delegate, scanning the elaborate document, exclaimed, &#145;On fera de la po&eacute;sie&#146;  (ibid., 56). Roll subsequently became one of the so-called four wise men responsible for the initial allocation of aid. &#145;I cannot think of many operations I have been involved in, before or since, that equalled it in complexity&#146; he later recalled  (ibid., 61). Britain emerged with the largest tranche, a triumph for which Roll deserved much of the credit.<br>
<br>As these negotiations came to an end, Roll became part of the permanent British delegation to the Organization for European Economic Co-operation with the title of minister, and moved his family to France. In her autobiography Freda Roll calculated that she had moved at least sixteen times during her married life. The move gave Roll a close view of the institutions that shaped post-war European integration. In 1952 he became deputy head of the British delegation to NATO, with responsibilities for its economic work. He was one of Britain's observers at the Franco-German talks that led to the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community. In his autobiography he recounted a curious secret visit with Stafford Cripps, then chancellor of the exchequer, to the French finance minister to discuss the creation of an alternative to the steel community. That scheme got nowhere. Roll felt that Britain's early ambivalence towards European integration shaped long-term relations with Europe. Whitehall's search for a perfect solution, that would square the three circles of Europe, the Commonwealth, and the relationship with the United States, led to inaction or dangerous delay.<br>
<br>Roll's return to London in 1953 meant reduced living standards (deprived of duty-free tobacco, he gave up smoking). It also meant a return to the Ministry of Food, soon to be uncomfortably amalgamated with the Ministry of Agriculture. But in 1957 he was negotiating again, to create a new world sugar agreement. He was then for a year the executive director of the new International Sugar Council. The experience persuaded him that a &#145;realistic and pragmatic approach&#146; was preferable to the unrestricted supremacy of the free market. Rather, government intervention could often be combined with market forces to secure &#145;politically accepted economic and social goals&#146;  (E. Roll, 94).<br>
<br>Back in London from 1959 as deputy secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Roll was once more involved in Britain's tortured relationship with Europe. In 1960, as Britain dithered about an application to join the Common Market, he chaired a working party on the emerging common agricultural policy. It concluded that most of the problems were manageable, that the policy was not yet set in stone, and that a speedy application was therefore essential. Britain formally submitted a bid in 1961&#151;but speed was not to be had.<br>
<br>Edward Heath included Roll (who was knighted KCMG in 1962, having been made CMG in 1949 and CB in 1956) in the high-powered group of civil servants&#151;the &#145;flying knights&#146;&#151;who masterminded Britain's part in the Brussels negotiations. Roll's skills, Heath later recalled, included &#145;seven languages and the ability to lip-read in both French and German&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 April 2005). Roll later felt that those negotiations were perhaps the high point of his work as a public servant, in their complexity, technicality and &#145;the pressures to which I and my fellow negotiators were subjected&#146;  (E. Roll, 103). On holiday with Robert Marjolin before the talks began, he realized that the concessions available to Britain would be limited by the commission's desire not to undermine the community. In the event, the structure of the negotiations caused problems just as great as the substantive issues under discussion. The six countries of Europe, in the throes of reaching their own agreement on the common agricultural policy, insisted on negotiating as a bloc, and the British frequently found themselves facing a spokesman merely expounding a common position. When de Gaulle finally torpedoed talks in January 1963, Roll expressed surprise to Olivier Wormser, of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. &#145;Indeed&#146;, said Wormser, &#145;You don't know how close to success you were&#146;  (ibid., 128).<br>
<br>In 1963 Roll returned to the United States as economic minister at the embassy and head of the UK Treasury delegation in Washington. It was a vibrant time, with John Kennedy and then Lyndon Johnson in the White House and many of Roll's academic friends in public life. He built a new set of enduring friendships with America's bankers, many of them through Siegmund Warburg, who was to shape the final third of Roll's long career. But with the election in 1964 of a Labour government, Roll was recalled early for what proved to be his final stint in public life.<br>
<br>Before he had taken up his embassy post, Roll had lunched with George Brown, then in opposition. Brown had asked Roll whether he thought the economic work of government would be improved by having a Department of Economic Affairs. Roll had replied cautiously that it might be so, adding that the power of the Treasury was so great that such a department would find it hard to assert itself. Later that year, Roll bumped into Brown again, who urged him not to put down deep roots in America. In 1964 Roll reluctantly became permanent secretary of the new department. &#145;I was even at the time very sceptical about the exaggerated hopes for the DEA entertained by many others&#146;, Roll subsequently wrote  (E. Roll, 164).<br>
<br>For much of the autumn Roll shuttled between London and Washington, where no successor was appointed for three months (Alec Cairncross having refused the post). It was a bad beginning. Douglas Allen, moved from the Treasury, had to handle recruitment for the new department and most organizational matters. Indeed, much of Roll's public service had been in international negotiations, in roles more typical of the Foreign Office than of the other parts of Whitehall. He had little effective experience of departmental management. He also had to cope with a floundering economy, a prime minister whose economic training reinforced his reluctance to relinquish control of economic policy, a hostile and entrenched Treasury, and a tempestuous minister.<br>
<br>One of Roll's most endearing characteristics was a desire always to emphasize the best in others. Even to George Brown, Roll was kindly in retrospect, despite Brown's inebriated bullying: within a month of taking office, Brown had already &#145;sacked&#146; Roll once  (Cairncross, 14). Much later, pressed by the broadcaster Sue Lawley to describe Brown's tantrums, Roll recalled Brown storming into his office shouting furiously at his permanent secretary to &#145;Find my car!&#146; Roll demurred: &#145;I'm always ready to serve you, but not to find your car&#146;, and generously remembered that Brown had apologized the next morning, &#145;which he usually did after a row&#146;. He was, reflected Roll, a highly intelligent man, with good instincts, frustrated by losing the battle for the party leadership to Harold Wilson  (<span class="italic">Desert Island Discs</span>, Aug 2001).<br>
<br>When Brown moved to the Foreign Office in the summer of 1966 he tried to persuade Roll to follow him. Roll refused, pointing out that the Foreign Office would never accept an outsider. But Roll by then had decided to leave the civil service, two years before the official retirement age. There had been talk of making him governor of the Bank of England (he was later on the court), but in the end he embarked upon his third and&#151;as it turned out&#151;his longest career, as a merchant banker.<h2>
<a name="BankeratWarburgs"></a>Banker at Warburgs</h2>In the spring of 1967, after spending the enforced six-month period of &#145;decontamination&#146; at Harvard, writing <span class="italic">The World after Keynes</span> (1968), Roll joined S. G. Warburg &amp; Co. Ltd as deputy chairman. He became a devoted admirer of Siegmund Warburg, one of the most influential figures in the post-war City. Other merchant banks had wooed Roll, but Martin Gordon, who also joined the bank in the 1960s, recalled that Warburg had told Roll that he would probably &#145;have more fun with us&#146;  (Gordon). He was to spend the next thirty-eight years at Warburgs. He became chairman in 1974, joint chairman with David Scholey from 1983 to 1987, president from 1987 to 1995, and finally senior adviser to what had by then become, first, part of Swiss Bank Corporation, and then part of UBS (Union Bank of Switzerland).<br>
<br>When Roll joined Warburgs the influence on financial markets of that middle-European intellectual hothouse was at its height. The merchant bank had created the eurobond market four years earlier by issuing the first eurodollar loan. It had also, thanks to Warburg's partner Henry Grunfeld, won the first great post-war British takeover battle, for British Aluminium in 1958, and now dominated the market.<br>
<br>Roll's first months were unpromising. Others resented the seniority Warburg conferred on his new deputy chairman, who clearly knew little of the banking business. Some, irritated by his transparent hero-worship of the charismatic Warburg, named him Sir Echo. Sometimes Warburg would tease Roll by unexpectedly changing his position and leaving him stranded. Ian Fraser, one of the inventors of the eurobond, described an occasion when Roll chaired the bank's morning meeting and refused to accept a majority view on whether to issue more bonds in a certain deal. &#145;There is someone whose opinion I particularly admire and whom I should like to consult before we minute this decision&#146;, he explained. There was a chorus of laughter: all knew that he wanted Warburg's clearance  (Fraser, 277). However, Roll had a good teacher, and learned quickly. He and Warburg would walk at weekends round the silent squares of Belgravia, talking less about theory than practice: the quirks of particular companies, banks and, above all, people. When Warburg died in 1982 it was Roll with Grunfeld, dubbed the &#145;uncles&#146;, who handled Scholey's succession.<br>
<br>Warburgs were eager to extend their eurobond business, notably to Japan and then to China. Roll's greatest assets were his charm, his astonishing address book, and his instinctive internationalism. He embarked on a tremendous programme of travel on the bank's behalf, generally accompanied (until her death in 1998) by his wife. At his ninetieth birthday party, Scholey said that Roll had never knowingly passed an airport without going into it. Were someone from London to land on an iceberg in Antarctica, said Scholey on another occasion, one of the penguins would be likely to ask how Eric Roll was. He knew everyone by name; was not thrown by Japanese or Chinese names; and had a phenomenal memory for people and for what they had done. His ability to quote reams of Shakespeare endeared him to one head of the Bank of Tokyo, his experience in government to another. He was instrumental in encouraging his friend Yoshitoki Chino, chairman of Daiwa Securities, to set up the Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation, of which he served as founding chairman from 1988 to 2001, and which soon became the major British charity supporting links between Britain and Japan. In cultivating Japanese financial institutions, his advancing years were often a positive advantage. He was also one of the first bankers to go to China, where he impressed his hosts with his knowledge of Marx. S. G. Warburg issued the first eurobond in London for the Bank of China.<br>
<br>In other areas of public life Roll's charm was also a continuing asset. He sat on the boards of several companies, mostly Warburgs' clients, including Times Newspapers and the Rootes car company. From 1971 to 1980 he was also on the National Economic Development Council. Ronald McIntosh, its director-general from 1973, found him a shrewd adviser on cabinet and Treasury machinations against the council. In his diaries McIntosh recalled a fraught lunch of politicians, industrialists, and trade unionists in the thick of a miners' strike that had reduced Britain to a three-day week, with &#145;Eric working hard to keep the conversation light and interesting &hellip; In fact, it was all quite enjoyable&#146;  (McIntosh, 31).<br>
<br>In the final decade of his life Roll continued to travel and to draw on his immense network. Like Grunfeld, who continued to work until his death at the age of ninety-five in 1999, Roll came regularly to work at about 10 a.m. until the week of his death. He would spend the morning in his office close to Scholey's, moving on after lunch to attend the House of Lords (he had become a life peer, as Baron Roll of Ipsden, in 1977 and was a reliable member of the economic affairs committee). Global financial leaders such as Alan Greenspan would ring him up, and he would knowledgeably quiz young colleagues and visiting journalists.<br>
<br>Roll also continued his prolific output of books, academic papers, and speeches. He wrote a rather bland autobiography, <span class="italic">Crowded Hours</span> (1985), with not a single harsh word or unkind revelation. His economic views remained essentially Keynesian and interventionist, although with some subtlety. In 1938, in the first issue of the <span class="italic">Modern Quarterly</span>, a journal whose editorial council included not just Roll but left-wing intellectuals such as Harold Laski and Joseph Needham, he had given warning of the danger that fascist regimes were misusing Keynes's precept of interventionism for militarist ends. Four decades later, in his Stamp memorial lecture of 1976, he chastised those who believed the myth that there had once been a golden age of the market economy. He spoke of the inevitability of more formal channels of intervention in managing the economy. But he also attacked the &#145;clich&eacute;s of collectivism&#146; coming from the other side of the political divide.<br>
<br>Roll also remained a committed European all his life. He deeply regretted the Thatcher government's refusal in 1979 to join the European exchange rate mechanism. Indeed, he had always been an enthusiast for a common currency, having toyed in the early 1960s with the idea of a unit called the <i>moneta</i>. &#145;I suppose it would have been the forerunner to the euro&#146;, he reflected  (Moore). In the early 1990s he chaired a committee that examined the case for giving independence to the Bank of England. It came down strongly in favour of independence. It might seem surprising that a man with Keynesian leanings should have favoured the separation of authority for fiscal and monetary policy, but he was probably moved mainly by the desire to see Britain position itself to participate in the euro. He wrote two more books on political and economic matters: <span class="italic">Where Did We Go Wrong?</span> (1995) and <span class="italic">Where Are We Going?</span> (2000). In both cases, the main answer to the question lay in Europe. Roll feared that the Conservative government would become increasingly anti-European and xenophobic, with a &#145;disagreeable type of demagogic appeal to lower middle-class instincts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Where Are We Going?</span>, 163). Speaking privately of Margaret Thatcher, he abandoned his usual bonhomie: &#145;that terrible woman&#146; was his phrase at a lunch in the 1990s  (private information).<br>
<br>In one sense Roll's long life was a history of might-have-beens, and not just in terms of his long disappointment over Britain's half-hearted involvement with Europe. He was several times considered for, but never held, one of those offices at the head of an international organization like the World Bank, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, for which his background would so ideally have prepared him. As an economist, he was a brilliant expositor but not an original theorist. Moreover, he came to believe that the &#145;limits within which economics can be relied on for precise guidance are very narrow indeed&#146;  (E. Roll, 239). But Roll was never a disappointed man. &#145;He had a sunny nature and a spontaneous gaiety which endeared him to many people&#146;, recalled his wife, looking back on their early years together  (W. Roll, 35). Moreover, Roll also left monuments in all his three careers, any one of which would have been a life's achievement for most people. His <span class="italic">History of Economic Thought</span> continued to sell, seventy years after it first appeared; his success in the Marshall plan negotiations helped to set Britain on the slow path to post-war recovery; and he helped to hold Warburgs together in the years after Siegmund Warburg's death. He made more friends in each career than many do in one; and he had not an ounce of malice. He went to work at Warburgs for the last time in the week of his death, which occurred at King Edward VII's Hospital, Westminster, on 30 March 2005. He was survived by his two daughters.<br>
