<span class="headword">&Oacute; hEodhasa <span class="st"> [O'Hussey]</span>,  Giolla Brighde</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Bonaventura]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1570&#150;1614), <span class="occ">Franciscan friar and poet</span>, was born in the diocese of Clogher, perhaps in co. Fermanagh (although there is a tradition that he came from near Bundoran, co. Donegal). He was a member of a celebrated hereditary learned family whose best-known member was the poet Eochaidh (<i>d</i>. 1612). It is not known how closely Giolla Brighde and Eochaidh were related to one another. Giolla Brighde is first recorded, as an apprentice poet, about the time Aodh Ruadh &Oacute; Domhnaill (Hugh Roe O'Donnell) was inaugurated as chieftain of T&iacute;r Conaill in the middle of 1592, when he composed an ode to the young chief. This work was apparently ignored by its recipient and does not seem to be extant, but shortly afterwards the young poet composed another poem, of eleven quatrains, &#145;A-t&aacute;m ionch&oacute;ra re hAodh&#146; (&#145;I can defend myself to Aodh&#146;); this is preserved in the poem book known as <span class="italic">The Book of O'Donnell's Daughter</span>. Some time later (but prior to 1600), Giolla Brighde left Ireland for the continent, his leaving his country and friends occasioning two moving poems, &#145;Sl&aacute;n agaibh a fhir chumtha&#146; (&#145;Fare you well, my friend&#146;) and &#145;Truagh an t-amharc-sa, a &Eacute;ire!&#146; (&#145;This is a sorrowful sight, O Ireland&#146;).<br>
<br>&Oacute; hEodhasa next appears at Douai on 19 September 1605. He had taken a master's degree and was now seeking permission to go to Louvain to pursue his theological studies, rather than to Salamanca or Valladolid, where he had been asked to go. When the Irish Franciscan college of St Anthony was established at Louvain in 1607 he became one of the first members of staff, having entered the Franciscan order in November of that year and taken as his name in religion Bonaventura. He was ordained in April 1609 and lectured in philosophy and later in theology at Louvain. He had been guardian of St Anthony's for up to two years prior to his untimely death there in 1614.<br>
<br>&Oacute; hEodhasa is especially celebrated in the history of Irish literature as the author of the first Catholic book in Irish to appear in print. This was <span class="italic">An teagasg cr&iacute;osdaidhe</span>, a catechism which was first issued from the press of Jacobus Mesius in Antwerp in 1611. A second edition, printed on the Irish press at Louvain (which Bonaventura was instrumental in obtaining some months before his death), was published some time prior to 1619 (most probably in 1614 or 1615). A third edition was issued in Rome in 1707. The work is partly in verse, but mainly in prose. (The date of the first edition is somewhat disputed: some writers mention 1608 as the year in which it first appeared, but this seems unlikely.) The catechism became an exemplar for later works in the same genre. Apparently printed along with, or shortly after, the second (Louvain) edition of <span class="italic">An teagasg cr&iacute;osdaidhe</span> was a separate booklet of twenty-nine pages containing three poems by Bonaventura: &#145;Truagh liomsa, a chomp&aacute;in, do chor&#146; (&#145;I pity your plight, my friend&#146;, ninety quatrains, addressed to a close friend &#145;who fell into heresy&#146;), &#145;Gabh aithreachas uaim&#146; (&#145;Accept repentance from me&#146;; twenty-one quatrains), and &#145;Truagh cor chloinne h&Aacute;dhaimh&#146; (&#145;Pitiable the condition of the children of Adam&#146;; seventeen quatrains, translated from the Latin of St Bernard). Five further poems by &Oacute; hEodhasa are extant (or possibly six, as in one instance the ascription is uncertain); these include a long catechetical poem which is to be found interspersed through the prose text of <span class="italic">An teagasg cr&iacute;osdaidhe</span>.<br>
<br>A treatise in Latin by &Oacute; hEodhasa on Irish grammar, <span class="italic">Rudimenta grammaticae Hibernicae</span>, attempted for the first time to classify Irish nouns by declension, in imitation of the Latin model. This work, which did not appear in print for more than three and a half centuries after the author's death, was mainly intended for fellow Franciscans and other members of the clergy who would have some competence in reading Latin. Bonaventura shows clearly that, apart from his knowledge of Latin (and of some Greek and Hebrew), he was extremely well versed in the teachings of the traditional Irish grammarians. The examples he adduces, including isolated quatrains and sometimes longer passages of Irish classical poetry, are of particular interest.<br>
<br>&Oacute; hEodhasa died of smallpox at Louvain on 15 November 1614, and was buried at St Anthony's College. His fellow scholar and Franciscan Aodh Mac Aingil (Hugh MacCawell) states that &Oacute; hEodhasa had planned, had he not been cut off so prematurely, to write many other works which would be of benefit, both spiritual and temporal, to the nation. The future Roman Catholic archbishop of Armagh thus sums up his confr&egrave;re's significance: &#145;There has not been for a long time a man so expert and eminent as Bonaventura in learning, in Gaelic and in piety&#146;  (&Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh, 27).<br>
