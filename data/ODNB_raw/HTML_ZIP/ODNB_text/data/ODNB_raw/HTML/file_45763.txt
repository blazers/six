<span class="headword">Marchall,  Roger</span>  (<em>c.</em>1417&#150;1477), <span class="occ">physician and writer on medicine</span>, embodied three strands of late-medieval English life: Cambridge University and its support through gifts of books; the sphere of London medical practice (including royal service); and the financial world of London merchants which afforded him prosperity. Born at Toddington in Bedfordshire, Marchall was one of at least four siblings in what was probably a landowning family. Still alive in the early 1470s were a brother John, of Toddington, a sister, Alice Awncell, and a brother Nicholas (<i>d</i>. 1474), sometime alderman of London and warden of the ironmongers. Whether Thomas Marchall <i>clericus</i> (<i>fl</i>. 1438&#150;1439), author of a Latin poem on cock-fighting, was another brother is unclear. Roger Marchall married Johan, probably after 1456. By the time Marchall's will was written (14 February 1477) they had a daughter, Anne, who was a minor, and an unborn child. Proved on 6 May 1477, the will specified burial in St Katharine Cree, London (his wife and John Clerk, royal apothecary, were executors). Marchall left to his children lands and tenements in that parish and in Hackney, along with &pound;200 and considerable plate. The will is noteworthy for its minimal religious bequests when compared with those of his brother Nicholas.<br>
<br>The first twenty years of Marchall's recorded life were spent at Cambridge. He was admitted as a fellow of Peterhouse in 1437, presumably having determined as MA. This suggests that he was born about 1417. He lectured as regent master, and afterwards held the position of junior proctor of the university (1443&#150;4). He had been awarded the MD degree by 1453. Some of his manuscripts bear his notes and diagrams from this period. He has also been suggested as the author of <span class="italic">Cum rerum motu</span>, a 1441 text on invalid and valid horoscopes for Henry VI, which survives in a later manuscript.<br>
<br>London was Marchall's residence from <i>c</i>.1456, and during this time he served as physician to Edward IV. References to this service are found in a writ of 1468, recording the examination of a woman for leprosy, and in Bodleian, MS Ashmole 424, where he identifies himself as &#145;regum medicus&#146;. Peterhouse, MS 95 contains a recipe, &#145;preservativa Regis Edwardi iiiite&#146;, apparently in his hand. Marchall may also have been responsible for royal horoscopes in his codices. In addition to royal service Marchall attended the first wife of John Howard (later duke of Norfolk) in 1465, and in 1471 is recorded as inspecting treacle for the mayor of London. Records surviving from the period of Marchall's London residence also testify to his financial transactions, particularly with members of the Guild of Ironmongers. In 1464 he conveyed money to Peterhouse as an executor of the will of the London ironmonger Thomas Dorchester, and his own will of 1477 records two debts of &pound;100 each, owed him by the ironmongers William Fuller and William Milne.<br>
<br>Marchall's manuscripts are the richest source of information about his interests. In a careful hand he copied out and annotated the text of Petrarch's <span class="italic">De remediis utriusque fortunae</span>, in what is now Oxford, All Souls College, MS 91. He may have compiled a medical florilegium emphasizing English medical writers in Cambridge, Gonville and Caius College, MS 98/50, and he supplied a number of short texts or notes, as well as diagrams and figures of division, to twelve other manuscripts. Leland also cited him as author of a (mathematical?) text titled <span class="italic">De figuris cata et apodiatis</span>. Marchall was, however, neither the author nor the scribe of the Middle English surgery treatise in New York, Academy of Medicine, MS 13, which has been attributed to him.<br>
<br>Roger Marchall also assembled manuscripts from booklets, adding tables of contents (for example, BL, Harley MS 531). He appears to have commissioned at least four codices from one London scribe and was particularly interested in Albertus Magnus on the <span class="italic">Parva naturalia</span>, owning four codices of that group of texts. He left his mark in numerous manuscripts, most of which he owned, by annotating them and supplying contents tables to them: forty-five survive in fourteen libraries; six others may have been his; twelve mentioned in records have not been traced. The overwhelming majority of the more than 400 texts he listed or annotated in his surviving codices are medical or have to do with astronomy, astrology, or natural philosophy.<br>
<br>Wealth from London trade enabled Roger Marchall to acquire scientific and medical manuscripts, which he used and then donated, apparently in the early 1470s, to three Cambridge colleges which supported the study of medicine: Peterhouse, King's, and Gonville Hall. His intellectual tastes and his wealth are revealed in two deluxe manuscripts he donated to Peterhouse; these are now Bodleian MS Ashmole 424, containing Witelo's <span class="italic">De perspectiva</span>, and Cambridge, Magdalene College, Pepys Library, Pepys MS 2329, a mathematical compendium. His benefaction of a considerable number of valuable books to fifteenth-century Cambridge colleges is exceptional for one who was neither a member of the aristocracy nor a cleric.<br>
