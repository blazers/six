<span class="headword">Davison,  Charles</span>  (1858&#150;1940), <span class="occ">mathematician and writer on seismology</span>, was born on 1 May 1858 in Bishopwearmouth, co. Durham, the second son of Edwin Charles Davison (1818&#150;1902), fleet paymaster, Royal Navy, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Joseph L. Spence of Swayfield, Lincolnshire. He went to the College of Physical Science, Newcastle upon Tyne (1874&#150;7), and then to Emmanuel College, Cambridge (1877&#150;81), where he became a scholar in 1879. He obtained a BA in mathematics (thirteenth wrangler) in 1881 and an MA in 1885.<br>
<br>In January 1884 Davison became senior mathematics master at Blairlodge School, Stirlingshire; in January 1885 he was appointed mathematical master (later head of mathematics) at King Edward's High School, Birmingham, where he remained until his retirement in March 1920. On 14 April 1886 he married Margaret Blanche (1855&#150;1948), daughter of James Harris, schoolmaster, of Great Chart, Ashford, Kent; they had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Between 1892 and 1931 Davison wrote nine mathematical textbooks for schools (one as co-author with R. Levett and one with C. H. Richards), covering aspects of plane and solid geometry, trigonometry, algebra, and calculus. He was, however, best known for his work as a writer on the history of British earthquakes and seismology in general, and his books on these topics remain useful sources of reference. He also published numerous papers in <span class="italic">Nature</span>, the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span>, and the <span class="italic">Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America</span>. Always on the lookout for periodicity in the frequency of shocks, Davison was one of the first to apply the analytical technique of Fourier analysis but his claim to find evidence of diurnal and lunar effects, in addition to one-, eleven-, and nineteen-year periods, was not supported when sensitive, continuous, recording techniques became available.<br>
<br>Despite a shy and diffident manner, Davison was a hard-working and gifted teacher of endless patience, from whose classes many able mathematicians went on to university. In 1895 he became secretary to the British Association seismological committee for study of earth tremors and the following year he and the seismologist John Milne, newly returned from his pioneering work in Japan, became joint secretaries of its newly established subcommittee for seismological investigation, until Davison retired from this position in 1899. He had become ScD (Cambridge) in 1896.<br>
<br>Davison died at his home, 70 Cavendish Avenue, Cambridge, where he lived following his retirement, on 28 April 1940. He was survived by his wife. He was buried on 1 May at St Andrew's Church, Cherry Hinton.<br>
