<span class="headword">Fallows,  Fearon</span>  (1788&#150;1831), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, was born in Cockermouth, Cumberland, on 4 July 1788, the son of John Fallows, a hand-loom weaver of sufficient education to act as clerk in the neighbouring parish of Bridekirk. Although he was brought up to his father's trade, he was a keen student of mathematics. With the help of the Revd H. A. Hervey, vicar of Bridekirk, he became assistant to the headmaster of Plumbland School. Supported by an anonymous patron, in October 1809 he entered St John's College, Cambridge, whence he graduated as third wrangler in the mathematical tripos, after John Herschel and George Peacock. He held a mathematical lectureship at Corpus Christi College for two years, and was then elected a fellow of St John's. He was ordained deacon in 1815 and priest in 1819, and was elected to the Royal Society in June 1820. In 1821 he married Mary Anne Hervey, the eldest daughter of the vicar. The fellows of the newly founded Astronomical Society had lobbied extensively in influential quarters for an observatory in the southern hemisphere, and as a result an order in council of George IV was issued on 20 October 1820 directing the establishment of an astronomical observatory at the Cape of Good Hope.<br>
<br>Although his experience of practical astronomy was rather slight, Fallows was appointed astronomer by the board of longitude, largely on an enthusiastic recommendation by Sir John Herschel. Fallows consulted with John Rennie, who, as his last work, had designed the observatory building on the lines of that at Cambridge&#151;that is, two residences with flat roofs for telescope domes joined by a central section devoted to meridian instruments. Fallows and his wife embarked on the 360 ton <i>Sappho</i> on 4 May 1821, accompanied by his assistant James Fayrer, the son of a London instrument maker. The ship docked at the naval base at Simonstown, where Fallows to his dismay found no funds available to have his instruments transported to Cape Town. They eventually came round the peninsula by sea at his own expense before being stored in the town granary. From a lodging in town Fallows made positional observations of 273 southern stars, the first such since those of Lacaille seventy years before, which were published by the Royal Society in 1824. After several expeditions to explore the area, Fallows chose for the permanent observatory a site between the Liesbeeck and Black rivers near their confluence, about 3 miles from the town, but there were long delays before construction could commence in 1825.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Fallows's assistant Fayrer had been dismissed for drunkenness, and a replacement, the (Catholic) Revd Patrick Scully, was fired for sexual misconduct. Nevertheless Fallows had happily participated in many aspects of colonial life, including acting as chaplain to the forces. As a fellow of the Royal Society he took an active part in local scientific and intellectual activity, and later arranged to conduct divine service in one of the observatory rooms. He personally supervised excavation of the foundations for a building constructed according to a rather amateurish scheme of his own, but fortunately a professional clerk of works, John Skirrow, arrived in February to build it in local stone. An unexpected cargo of Burmese teak provided material for the roof, shutters, and internal joinery. The roof was finished in lead. A professional assistant, Captain William Ronald, arrived on 19 November 1826; although appointed two years previously, he had been kept in London to inspect the principal meridian instruments of the observatory and to accompany them to South Africa. The instrument cases were somewhat roughly handled during landing at the wharf and damage was feared. Fallows always praised the transit circle used to determine right ascensions, but the mural circle, used for declinations, proved erratic, a failing due not to damage, but, as was found many years later, to a defect of construction. Fallows was an assiduous observer; he constructed necessary features such as meridian pillars for the adjustment of these instruments, provided primitive time signals for ships in Table Bay by the discharge of a pistol on the roof at settled times, and made regular observations of stars, sun, moon, and planets, most of which were published by his successors.<br>
<br>Fallows himself published in 1830 measurements of the local acceleration of gravity from pendulum observations. Ronald took sick leave in October 1830 and left for England, to be replaced by a young clerk, James Robertson, but Fallows had to call on his wife for astronomical assistance. Skirrow departed for a colonial post, but supervised the installation of the roof domes&#151;never to be occupied in Fallows's time. Worn out by overwork and relentless official parsimony, Fallows fell ill with scarlet fever and, in spite of a recuperative visit to Simonstown, died at the observatory on 25 July 1831. He was buried there, in front of the main building, at his own request, 12 feet deep under a slab of Robben Island stone. Mrs Fallows, with whom he had only one son, who died young, returned to England with all his papers and unpublished observations, which she handed over to the Admiralty.<br>
