<span class="headword">Lockhart, Sir  James Haldane  Stewart</span>  (1858&#150;1937), <span class="occ">colonial official and art collector</span>, was born on 25 May 1858 in the ancestral home of Ardsheal in Argyll, Scotland, the sixth of the nine children of Miles Lockhart and his wife, Anna Rebecca Charlotte Stewart (<i>d</i>. 1902), niece and heir of the last laird of Ardsheal. He was educated at home and then at a dame-school in the Isle of Man, before entering King William's College, Isle of Man (1868&#150;72), and then George Watson's College, Edinburgh, where he distinguished himself as captain of both cricket and rugby, as well as becoming joint dux (the senior scholar) in 1874. He studied English and Greek at the University of Edinburgh, winning the gold medal for Greek in 1876. He left the university without graduating to join the Colonial Office as a Hong Kong cadet in 1878.<br>
<br>Throughout 1879 Stewart Lockhart studied Chinese in London before beginning his duties in 1880 with two years language training undertaken in Canton (Guangzhou) and Hong Kong. In 1882 he took up his first official appointment in Hong Kong as clerk of councils and chief clerk in the colonial secretariat. After a few months he was moved to the registrar-general's office. In 1883 he was appointed superintendent of opium revenue, and five months later became assistant colonial secretary and assistant auditor-general. He also acted as registrar-general at times during 1884, 1885, and 1886, being appointed to the full post in 1887.<br>
<br>The post allowed Stewart Lockhart to work directly with the Chinese community in the colony. Most Europeans in China did not mix with the Chinese socially but Stewart Lockhart had several important Chinese friends. He was fascinated by all things Chinese, made great efforts to become fluent in the language, and was quickly recognized as a Sinologist of ability. His interests extended to Chinese society and folklore, poetry, art, and numismatics. The longer he remained in the East, the more Confucianist he became in outlook. As registrar-general he promoted the Chinese power base in Hong Kong whenever he could, strengthening the authority of important Chinese societies such as the Tung Wah Hospital Group, the district watch committee, and the Po Leung Kuk.<br>
<br>On 25 February 1889 Stewart Lockhart married Edith Louise Rider Hancock (1870&#150;1950), the daughter of a Hong Kong bullion broker. Happily married for almost fifty years, they had three children: Charles (1889&#150;1962), Mary (1894&#150;1985) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62991/', "Joel, Betty")</script>], and Margaret (1903&#150;1936). It was at the time of his marriage that he formally adopted the double surname Stewart Lockhart. Edith was a loyal supporter, encouraging her husband to follow not only his scholarly pursuits but also to indulge in his love of sport.<br>
<br>Having served successfully for eight years as registrar-general, Stewart Lockhart combined the post with that of colonial secretary from 1895. This made him the most important permanent official in the colony. He worked as tirelessly as ever and when in 1898 the colony was extended with the lease of the New Territories from China, it fell to Stewart Lockhart to organize the administration of the area and to delineate its boundaries. His belief that the territories would one day be returned to China and that existing Chinese systems should therefore be preserved whenever possible ensured that the New Territories retained their Chinese character and were never completely subsumed by British colonial traits. His work in the colony was rewarded in 1898 when he was appointed CMG. He also wrote articles on Chinese language and poetry and between 1895 and 1898 published three volumes on <span class="italic">The Currency of the Farther East</span>.<br>
<br>In 1902 Stewart Lockhart was appointed to be the first civil commissioner of Weihaiwei, a leased territory in Shandong province in north-east China. He was to remain there until he retired, despite the expectation by many that he would one day be appointed governor of Hong Kong. Weihaiwei was an economic and cultural backwater and Stewart Lockhart gradually became disillusioned with this post, despite his advancement to KCMG in 1908. He was rarely overworked during these years and spent much of his time researching aspects of Chinese culture, an interest he shared with his colleague <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34212/', "Sir Reginald Johnston")</script>. He also amassed a considerable collection of Chinese coins and paintings. By 1915 his coin collection was of sufficient significance to merit a further publication by him, <span class="italic">The Stewart Lockhart Collection of Chinese Copper Coins</span>, which catalogued some of the thousands of coins he owned. His scholarship was acknowledged with an honorary LLD degree from the University of Hong Kong in 1918.<br>
<br>In 1921 Stewart Lockhart retired to London where he served on several committees. He became a governor of the School of Oriental Studies at the University of London in 1925, was president of the London Highland Club in 1926&#150;7, a member of the Universities China Committee from 1932, and a member of the honorary committee for the 1935 exhibition of Chinese art held in London. He continued to write book reviews and scholarly articles on a variety of Chinese-related subjects. He died at home, 6 Cresswell Gardens, London, on 26 February 1937. His remains were cremated in London and interred at St Adamnan's, Appin, Argyll.<br>
<br>Before his death Stewart Lockhart gave his daughter Mary his collection of 600 Chinese paintings. In 1950 Mary also inherited her father's collection of coins, photographs, and papers. She gifted these to George Watson's College, Edinburgh, in 1967. The preservation of his collection has ensured that his historical importance in maintaining traditional Chinese values in Hong Kong and, most importantly, in the New Territories has not been forgotten.<br>
