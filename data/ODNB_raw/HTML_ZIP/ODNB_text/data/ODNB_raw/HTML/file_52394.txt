<span class="headword">Edgell,  Beatrice</span>  (1871&#150;1948), <span class="occ">psychologist</span>, was born on 26 October 1871 in Church Street, Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, the youngest daughter of Edward Higginson Edgell, a bank manager, and his wife, Sarah Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Buckle. She attended Notting Hill High School for Girls, London, and the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, obtaining in 1894 a BA with second-class honours in mental and moral science awarded by the University of London. She earned a BA with first-class honours from London in 1897, followed by a BA (first-class honours), and then an MA, from the University of Wales during the following two years. She also obtained a PhD from W&uuml;rzburg, in 1901, and a DLitt in 1924 from the University of Wales. In 1897 Edgell was appointed lecturer in philosophy and head of the department of mental and moral science (renamed the department of philosophy and psychology in 1906) at Bedford College for Women in the University of London, holding the latter post until her retirement in 1933. She became reader in psychology in 1913, professor of psychology in 1927 (attracting much newspaper attention as the first female holder of a chair in psychology), and, on her retirement, emeritus professor of psychology. Edgell held many other appointments in the college and the University of London, including a time as a member of senate (1906&#150;11) and external examiner in psychology (1913&#150;19).<br>
<br>The turn of the century was a period of intellectual discovery for Edgell, since the academic year 1900&#150;01 saw her in Oswald K&uuml;lpe's psychological laboratory at W&uuml;rzburg working on experimental studies of the &#145;higher mental functions&#146;. That she retained an interest in this area for all her professional life is indicated by her well received <span class="italic">Theories of Memory</span> (1924) and her presidential address to the Aristotelian Society in 1930 on the topic of &#145;Images&#146;. Indeed, her cross-disciplinary interests in experimental psychology and philosophy meant that she was equally at home as president from 1929 to 1932 of the British Psychological Society (of which she had been an active member almost from its inception), as she was as president of the Mind Association in 1927, and (in 1932) of section J (psychology) of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. She was also the first female president of each of these four organizations.<br>
<br>It is, however, as a teacher and standard-bearer for psychology, not least within her college and the University of London, that Edgell is best remembered. An anecdote from 1933 records the response to the enquiry, &#145;What did Miss X get?&#146; as an indignant &#145;Get? Why a first, of course. Miss Edgell's students always do.&#146; She was by all accounts a conscientious and painstaking teacher who cared deeply about the education, welfare, and future careers of her students. Colleagues and former students alike spoke of her personal qualities, such as her kindness and generosity, her diplomatic skills, and sense of humour, as well as paying tribute to her considerable intellectual achievements. Her practical approach to teaching led to two successful textbooks. <span class="italic">Mental Life</span> (1926) was especially designed for social science students at Bedford College, while <span class="italic">Ethical Problems</span> (1929) was meant primarily for nurses and social workers&#151;professions in which she took a special interest. Edgell was also successful in building up the laboratory and lecturing facilities serving psychology within Bedford College, although it was not until the college moved to its spacious Regent's Park site in 1913 that her more ambitious teaching and research plans were realized.<br>
<br>After her retirement, Edgell worked in a child guidance clinic and acted as a teacher and examiner in psychology for the nursing profession. Her brief history of the British Psychological Society (1947) is notable as much for its personal and candid reminiscences of the early years of the society as it is for the quality of its easy scholarship; it is perhaps typical that she made no mention of her own part in shaping the society during this period. Edgell died from cancer on 10 August 1948 in the Ash Priors Nursing Home, Pittville Circus, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. Her funeral service was held in Tewkesbury Abbey on 13 August 1948, after which she was cremated and her ashes buried. She was unmarried.<br>
