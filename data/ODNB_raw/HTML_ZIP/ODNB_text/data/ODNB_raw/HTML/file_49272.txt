<span class="headword">Harald Hardrada</span> <span class="st"> [Haraldr inn Har&eth;r&aacute;&eth;i, Haraldr Sigur&eth;arson]</span>  (1015&#150;1066), <span class="occ">king of Norway</span>, was the son of the Norwegian petty king Sigurd S&yacute;r (Sigurd the Sow) and &Aacute;sta Guthbrandsd&oacute;ttir, who had earlier been the wife of Harald Grenski &#145;from Grenland&#146; (west of Oslo Fjord), with whom she had had a son, &Oacute;l&aacute;f Haraldsson (St Olaf). In 1030 at the age of fifteen Harald fought in the battle of Stiklestad, in which his stepbrother was killed and Harald himself was wounded. After the battle he fled east to Sweden and thence went to Russia (Novgorod-Kiev) where he stayed for three or four years at the court of King Yaroslav (<i>d</i>. 1054).<br>
<br>Probably in 1034&#150;5 Harald arrived in Constantinople where he entered the service of the Byzantine emperor. This service is described in a Byzantine source, from which it seems that Harald was a gifted soldier. He rose to command the emperor's special guard of Russians and Scandinavians (Varangians). Norse sources also describe Harald's contribution to the emperor's service, but much of the description of his battles in Asia, Africa, and Sicily is reminiscent of fables and sagas. None the less, the content is partly based in fact. Harald was at one point caught up in the conflict over the Byzantine imperial succession and he amassed a huge fortune in booty. His personal wealth in the end brought him into conflict with the emperor. In 1043 he was forced to flee Constantinople after first securing his riches.<br>
<br>In 1043 Harald was again in Russia at the court of Yaroslav, whose daughter Elizabeth (Ellisif) he married in 1044. They had two daughters. In 1045 Harald made his way back to Scandinavia. His undisguised aim was to become the king of Norway, if necessary by waging war against the then king, Magn&uacute;s &Oacute;l&aacute;fsson (<i>r</i>. 1035&#150;47), Harald's own nephew and the son of &Oacute;l&aacute;f Haraldsson. In preparation for such a war Harald began negotiations with Magn&uacute;s's Danish enemy, Swein Estrithson, and the Swedish king who was Swein's ally. In the face of this threat Magn&uacute;s tried to reach an understanding with Harald and in 1046 they agreed to share Norwegian royal power. The following year Magn&uacute;s died and Harald became sole ruler of Norway.<br>
<br>Harald's reign was of the greatest significance for the consolidation of a Norwegian kingdom, a development already under way but as yet incomplete. Among other things the inland areas to the east were more firmly annexed to the rest of the kingdom. Harald crushed all opposition to royal power and in general favoured the use of force to solve problems. He arranged for a parley with his chief domestic political opponents where, without provocation, he had them assassinated. If he thought it necessary he ravaged and burnt in Norway just as ruthlessly as he had done earlier during campaigns in the Mediterranean. He also had an autocratic, &#145;Byzantine&#146; attitude towards the church. He came into conflict with the archbishop in Hamburg&#150;Bremen, who had responsibility for the church in Scandinavia, because he refused to acknowledge his authority. When the archbishop protested by sending envoys, Harald is said to have replied that he knew no archbishop nor lord in Norway other than the king himself.<br>
<br>Harald founded the dynasty of the later Norwegian kings through his son &Oacute;l&aacute;f Haraldsson the Quiet (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1050), who was king from 1066 to 1093. &Oacute;l&aacute;f's mother was Th&oacute;ra Th&oacute;rbergsd&oacute;ttir, from one of Norway's most prominent families. They had a second son, Magn&uacute;s (<i>c</i>.1049&#150;1069), who ruled jointly with &Oacute;l&aacute;f in the years immediately following their father's death (1066&#150;9).<br>
<br>As the successor to the throne of Magn&uacute;s &Oacute;l&aacute;fsson, Harald pursued the claim to the kingdom of Denmark that Magn&uacute;s had made since 1041&#150;2. The claim was disputed by Swein Estrithson. Almost every summer Harald waged war in Denmark, but in 1064 he and Swein began peace negotiations, which resulted in each recognizing the other's kingdom. Similarly Harald claimed that, as the successor to the Danish kings, he had a legitimate claim to the English throne. The dispute over the succession in England in 1066 gave him the opportunity to try to fulfil his claim through an expedition&#151;the last really great viking raid.<br>
<br>At the beginning of September 1066 the Norwegian fleet sailed for England via Shetland and Orkney, where they gathered significant reinforcements. They reached the mouth of the Tyne on about 10 September. The <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> puts the number of ships at 300. It seems that contact had been made well in advance between Harald and the exiled Tostig Godwineson, although it is unlikely that Tostig had gone to Norway to seek Harald, as both the Norman chronicles and the Norse sagas suggest. It seems more likely that communication had been established via emissaries, since Tostig returned to England in April 1066. When Harald landed at the Tyne, Tostig joined him and became his earl.<br>
<br>The two allies' initial aim was to conquer Northumbria, but they were met by Harold Godwineson's earls Edwin and Morcar and on 20 September the two armies clashed at Fulford just outside York. Harald and Tostig won and Edwin and Morcar fled. A few days later on 24 September the citizens of York surrendered the town to Harald and Tostig. Harald began to load ships to continue his conquest further south. Meanwhile the Yorkshire thegns agreed that Harald would take hostages from the whole of Yorkshire. He awaited them with a large part of his army at Stamford Bridge, east of York, on 25 September. The choice of location could have been due to the fact that Harald had fortified the place or that he controlled the Derwent with his fleet. However, in the meantime Harold Godwineson had advanced from the south in a forced march with far stronger forces than Harald's and had the previous day arrived in Tadcaster. He attacked Harald and Tostig, taking them completely by surprise. Harold Godwineson won after a short but hard-fought battle, and both Harald and Tostig were killed. Later &Oacute;l&aacute;f Haraldsson, who had remained with the ships during the battle, was allowed to take his father's body home to Norway. Among those that followed &Oacute;l&aacute;f was the Englishman Sk&uacute;li, head of a powerful Norwegian family, who in Norway was regarded as the son of Tostig.<br>
