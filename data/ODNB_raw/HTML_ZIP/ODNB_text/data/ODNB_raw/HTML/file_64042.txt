<span class="headword">Donovan,  Terence Daniel</span>  (1936&#150;1996), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born at 24 Antill Road, Mile End, London, on 14 September 1936, the only child of Daniel Donovan, lorry driver, and his wife, (Lilian) Constance Violet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wright, cook. He had a fractured education&#151;&#145;I spent most of the war&#146;, he once said, &#145;in the cab of a large lorry travelling round England with my father&#146;  (Vines). Nevertheless he found time to learn the craft of photography (which throughout his life it remained, never an art). He enrolled to study lithography, as an eleven-year-old apprentice, at the London School of Photo-Engraving in Fleet Street (later relocated and renamed the London College of Printing), while also attending Fairfield Road secondary modern school. He left at fifteen to become a photographer's assistant at Gee and Watson, a blockmakers for the printing industry, and from there moved to work first with the photographer Hugh White and then with Michael Williams, a photographer for <span class="italic">Fleet Illustrated</span>. His stay there&#151;of at least three to four years&#151;was broken by two years of national service in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps (1955&#150;7), where he supplemented his pay by producing picture postcards. In 1957 he joined the studio of the leading fashion photographer John French, as assistant to the photographers Adrian Flowers and John Adrian (also known as Adriaan). After a year he left with Janet Campbell Cohen (<i>b</i>. 1933), a stylist for French, to open a studio in Yeoman's Row, Knightsbridge. It was a success from the start, his first commission pedestrian but well paid: a photograph of a Viota sponge cake, for 27 guineas (taken on 27 January 1959). He and Janet Cohen married on 2 June 1960, and had one son, Daniel.<br>
<br>Unlike many young photographers Donovan was not forced to specialize in a particular discipline, thanks to a versatility that attracted a range of clients, including the leading advertising agencies and fashion and lifestyle magazines of the time. Prominent among the latter were <span class="italic">Vogue</span>, <span class="italic">Harper's Bazaar</span>, and <span class="italic">Man About Town</span> (later renamed <span class="italic">About Town</span> and then just <span class="italic">Town</span>). Donovan's expertise was sought for fashion, still life, and portraiture, both in a studio setting and on location. Shooting mostly with black and white film in the early years, his singular, <i>verit&eacute;</i> style set him apart from his contemporaries and was best illustrated by a series of men's fashion pictures taken on the streets of London for <span class="italic">Man About Town</span>, published in 1961, and, for the same magazine a year later, a series of portraits of the young actress Julie Christie in her London flat. Both sets were taken with an informality untypical of the time.<br>
<br>Donovan brought the life of his times into the studio, too, getting his models to walk and to pose like the girls he knew from the East End. In the process he helped to give magazines a new visual language of gesture and stance&#151;a &#145;working-class chic&#146;. Again for <span class="italic">Man About Town</span> he contributed two remarkable photo-essays, the first on an artists' collective in Holland Park and the second on one day in the life of a West End stripper. He chose not to pursue straight documentary work: &#145;I tend to reduce my reportage to graphics&#146;, he explained later; &#145;I don't really want to report on life &hellip; I'm quite happy to see a girl scratching her nose in a coffee bar and translate that via a model&#146;  (Vines). In 1963 he took his first photograph for <span class="italic">Vogue</span>&#151;a portrait of the conductor Georg Solti in Covent Garden&#151;and began an association with the magazine that ended only with his death. His last published photograph was for <span class="italic">Vogue</span> and appeared posthumously in February 1997, a grainy portrait of the London-based design team Clements Ribeiro, which in style and execution was similar to the up-to-the-minute portraits of the London fashion scene that he had created decades earlier.<br>
<br>Donovan's first marriage came to an end in July 1967, and on 30 April 1970 he married Diana St Felix Dare (<i>b</i>. 1942), film publicist and, later, corporate affairs consultant; they had a son, Terence, and a daughter, Daisy. In the 1970s, while continuing to shoot fashion for <span class="italic">Vogue</span>, Donovan explored the more lucrative field of advertising photography, began a series of experimental &#145;impressionistic&#146; fashion photographs for <span class="italic">Nova</span> magazine, and also turned his hand to the moving image. He financed and directed a feature film, <span class="italic">Yellow Dog</span> (1973), influenced by Japanese cinema and martial arts. The film was not a popular success but he was asked subsequently to direct commercials for television and, later still, to direct for the American CBS Network films of the National Theatre stage plays <span class="italic">Early Days</span>, <span class="italic">On the Razzle</span>, and <span class="italic">The Importance of Being Earnest</span>.<br>
<br>By the 1980s much of Donovan's time was spent on television commercials and advertising photography, although he frequently shot fashion for <span class="italic">Vogue</span>, <span class="italic">Elle</span>, and <span class="italic">Marie Claire</span>, and the fashion collections (often twice a year) for the Italian edition of <span class="italic">Harper's Bazaar</span>. His voracious instinct for the highly colourful, for an exaggerated glamour, and for baroque fantasies in French ch&acirc;teaux made him a favourite with fashion editors of the 1980s and early 1990s. &#145;You see, fashion photography is an act of theatre&#146;, he maintained, &#145;and you really have to love it&#146;  (&#145;Yellow dog&#146;). He brought the sensibility of the glossy magazine to the fashion pages of British newspapers, much as his early employer John French had done years before at the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>. He was also a pioneer of the pop promotional video, most notably that for Robert Palmer's song <span class="italic">Addicted to Love</span> (1986). For this he was nominated one of <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> magazine's &#145;People of the decade&#146; in 1989.<br>
<br>Donovan's interests were wide-ranging, compensating perhaps for the years of disrupted schooling. He was a devotee of Zen Buddhism and a practitioner of judo. At one point he owned a chain of dress shops, a firm of building contractors, and an ironmonger's shop in Chelsea, and part-owned a restaurant with the actor Terence Stamp. He also held a successful show of his paintings at the Albemarle Gallery, London, in 1992. Like his great friend David Bailey he was a by-word for English commercial photography: &#145;The Falstaff of Fashion Photography&#146;, according to Francis Wyndham, &#145;without malice, trusted by his rivals&#146;  (Wyndham, notes). He was a photographer to the royal family, too, taking the official engagement photographs of the duke and duchess of York and photographing the princess of Wales on three occasions (8 October 1986, 24 June 1987, and 26 February 1990). Prints from these three sittings were deposited in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery, London. In 1996 he was appointed visiting professor of Central St Martin's College of Art and Design.<br>
<br>Donovan hanged himself on 22 November 1996 at a studio he was building in Hanwell, London, following a severe reaction to medication; he was buried at Gunnersbury cemetery on 29 November. He was survived by his wife, Diana, and his three children. He had just completed a twenty-one page portfolio for <span class="italic">GQ</span> magazine on rock'n'roll heroes in celebration of &#145;swinging&#146; London's second incarnation&#151;the &#145;cool Britannia&#146; of the mid- to late 1990s. This marked a return to editorial photography that was keenly anticipated and which, published in the month of his death, became his valediction. He published three books of his photographs, <span class="italic">Women Through the Eyes of Smudger TD</span> (<i>c</i>.1964), <span class="italic">Glances</span> (1983), and <span class="italic">Fighting Judo</span> (with Katsuhiko Kashiwazaki, 1985). A retrospective exhibition of his London photographs was held at the Museum of London in 1999, and a large-format anthology of his photographs, <span class="italic">Terence Donovan</span>, was published in 2000.<br>
