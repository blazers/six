<span class="headword">Speed,  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1633, <em>d.</em> 1679?), <span class="occ">printer and bookseller</span>, was baptized on 23 October 1633 at St Giles Cripplegate, London, the son of Samuel Speed (<i>d</i>. before 1661), a citizen and member of the Merchant Taylors' Company&#151;himself the second surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26093/', "John Speed")</script>, the historian and cartographer&#151;and his wife, Jane, daughter of Richard Joyner alias Lloyd of Abingdon, Berkshire. He was the cousin of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26097/', "Samuel Speed")</script>, the clergyman. Speed was neither (as has been suggested) the son of Daniel Speed, a publisher between 1603 and 1620, nor the father of Thomas Speed, a London bookseller from 1689. On 29 September 1649 young Samuel Speed was bound apprentice to a London stationer, Edward Blackmore, who was probably his uncle, the husband of his father's sister Sarah. He was made free on 5 October 1657 and became a printer and publisher in London. His business was located at St Paul's Churchyard from 1658 to 1662, but moved the following year to the Rainbow, Fleet Street, and after 1669 to Threadneedle Street near the Royal Exchange. The printer was almost certainly the Samuel Speed of St Gregory's, London, a bachelor aged twenty-seven who on 20 February 1661 was granted a licence to marry Rose (<i>b</i>. 1642/3), spinster, aged eighteen, daughter of John Underwood, gentleman, of the Middle Temple.<br>
<br>On 8 May 1666 Speed was arrested on charges of publishing and distributing seditious books; specific mention was made of <span class="italic">The Power and Practice of Court Leets</span> by &#145;Ag Ph&#146; in which was reproduced material originally issued in Cromwell's time. This was thought by a nervous government to encourage the spread of dangerous ideas. He was discharged on 26 May on provision of a bond for &pound;300 against repeating the offence. It seems possible that this brush with the law affected Speed's trade; perhaps he had enemies in the Stationers' Company, but however that may be he was soon in trouble again. On 15 April 1669, company officials testified that he had &#145;surreptitiously&#146; obtained licences for two books, <span class="italic">The King's Primer</span> and its replacement, <span class="italic">The King's Psalter</span>, from Samuel Parker, chaplain to Archbishop Sheldon  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1668&#150;9</i>, 280). On 8 October 1672 Speed wrote to the archbishop himself, outlining his project of revising and updating his grandfather's history; he also complained of his own imprisonment in Newgate, which had arisen partly from losses sustained in the great fire of London and partly through legal actions against him, apparently in respect of <span class="italic">The King's Psalter</span> and <span class="italic">The King's Primer</span>.<br>
<br>The appeal to Sheldon was unsuccessful. In 1673 Speed issued <span class="italic">The prisoners compaint to the king's most excellent majestie, or, The cries of the king's bench. With Advice to the disconsolate gentlemen prisoners in the several prisons of England especially the king's bench</span> &#145;By SS a fellow of King's Colledge in Southwark&#146;. There followed the following year <span class="italic">Fragmenta carceris, or, The King's Bench Scuffle, with the Humours of the Common Side</span>, an account in verse of a prison brawl witnessed by the author, &#145;Samuel Speed, a member of the Royal Society&#146;. Despite these ironic shafts, his books reveal Speed not as a radical but as an ultra-loyalist cavalier, seeking to inspire in his readers a sense of outrage that gentlemen such as himself should suffer the indignities of &#145;the common side&#146;. In the frontispiece of <span class="italic">The King's Psalter</span> there appears a portrait of Charles II, with the verse,<blockquote>
<div>First Worship God, and his commands obey,<br>
</div>
<div>And next the King, who doth his sceptre sway:<br>
</div>
<div>Observe his Laws, no innovators trust,<br>
</div>
<div>And to thy neighbour as thyself be just.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>It appears from his <span class="italic">Prison-Pietie</span> (1677) that Speed's financial and legal difficulties had continued unabated: &#145;London's too late and fatal Judgements, the Plague and Fire, having made me uncapable to manage my Affairs with the like success as formerly, some Creditors forced me to a Confinement in <i>Ludgate</i>&#146;; and he observed sadly that &#145;Many when they grow rich in Temporals, wax poor in Spirituals: As their outward man increaseth, so their inward man decayeth; and as the flesh flourishes, the spirit withers: yet prosperous wickedness is accounted vertue&#146;  (sig. A3<i>r</i>, A6<i>r</i>). But his verse, though not of the highest quality, had improved somewhat, and his political loyalty was immovable. In an appended panegyric to Henry Compton, bishop of London, Speed advised:<blockquote>
<div>But if the many headed beast should rise<br>
</div>
<div>To pluck King's plumes, and peck out prelates eyes,<br>
</div>
<div>Teach them to crumble, like a tottering wall,<br>
</div>
<div>Or Dagon crippled with a second fall;<br>
</div>
<div>Or heads on London bridge, exposed to sight,<br>
</div>
<div>That grin, and shew their teeth, but cannot bite.<br>
</div> (p. 191)</blockquote>In 1678 there appeared Speed's translation of <span class="italic">Romae antiquae descriptio</span> by Valerius Quintus Maximus, dedicated to Heneage Finch, lord chancellor, and lately attorney-general, from whom Speed had &#145;lately experienc'd the Influences of your Honours Favours&#146;  (sig. A1<i>r</i>). This may suggest a recent intervention in his legal difficulties which had led to his release. Nothing further is certainly known of Samuel Speed; but there is some reason to suspect that his death may have occurred the following year.<br>
