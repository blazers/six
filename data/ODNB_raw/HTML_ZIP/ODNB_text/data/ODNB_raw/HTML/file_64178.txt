<span class="headword">Keck,  Anthony</span>  (1726/7&#150;1797), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was first recorded in the register of Lugwardine parish, Herefordshire, on 29 June 1761, when he married Mary Palmer by special licence. He was said to be of Randwick, Gloucestershire, and was probably engaged at this time in the rebuilding of the central section of Longworth Hall, in the same parish. Randwick remained his home until 1768 when he moved to Beech House, King's Stanley, where he lived for the rest of his life. Nothing else is known about Keck's background but it seems likely that he was a member of a minor gentry family settled at Great Tew in Oxfordshire or Mickleton in north Gloucestershire, and came to his profession as a gentleman rather than an artisan. During the next three decades he was, according to his obituary in the <span class="italic">Hereford Journal</span> of 11 October 1797, the most &#145;celebrated architect&#146; in Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire, and south Wales.<br>
<br>Much of Keck's earliest recorded work around Stroud is of a minor character. He provided new pews for Standish church in 1764 and new wings for Bownham Park (1766&#150;70); his first complete house was the modest Ferney Hill (1768), near Dursley. Keck's career developed beyond Gloucestershire with the support of the Revd Dr Treadway Nash, the author of <span class="italic">Collections for the History of Worcestershire</span> (1781&#150;2). Nash was a powerful force in Worcestershire in the late eighteenth century, an indefatigable promoter of public works who was a member of an influential group of local gentry. About 1758 he acquired an estate at Bevere, north of Worcester, where Keck was employed to convert his farmhouse into a neat Palladian villa. Thereafter, Nash assiduously promoted Keck's skills among his friends. In 1764, for instance, he was vice-president of a committee established to build a new infirmary in Worcester, which chose Keck as its architect from a shortlist of four architects which included the nationally respected Henry Keene. Nash's influence probably enabled Keck to secure his next commission, St Martin's Church, Worcester (1768&#150;72), where he was once again in competition with Keene and may eventually have worked to his design. Nash was also a trustee for the rebuilding of the Severn Bridge: in August 1770 Keck was paid &pound;50 &#145;for his plans and estimate&#146;  (Bridge book of orders, 1 Aug 1770, Worcs. RO), presumably for a scheme to repair the old bridge which Nash was promoting.<br>
<br>Nash's influence can next be detected at Upton upon Severn, where the lord of the manor was John Martin of Ham Court, Nash's brother-in-law: Keck provided a lead-covered cupola for the parish church (1769) and rebuilt the court (1772). With its end-on bows, pedimented centrepiece, and austere treatment, it was the prototype for several of Keck's later houses. Another of Nash's close acquaintances was the Revd Dr Davenport, rector of Bredon, who seems to have employed Keck in 1771 to add a bay to his rectory. In August, Davenport's former pupil Thomas Mansel Talbot stayed at Bredon; on returning to south Wales in November, he made a note to himself to write to &#145;Mr. Keck&#146;  (Martin, 30). The result was Keck's finest house, Penrice Castle, Glamorgan (1775&#150;80). Like his earlier houses, the fa&ccedil;ade is sparsely ornamented, but a single sea-facing bow runs from basement to attic; inside, the simple but refined rooms are arranged around a top-lit staircase following the typical villa plan.<br>
<br>Two years before work commenced at Penrice, in April 1773, Keck refurbished Kentchurch Court, a medieval manor in west Herefordshire for John Scudamore MP. His neighbour was Sir George Cornewall of Moccas Court, where Keck stepped into the shoes of Robert Adam, exploiting his design but also repeating his own success at Penrice. This is one of several projects where Keck seems to have been employed to adapt the design of a more eminent architect for his patron. By the mid-1770s Keck had established himself as the premier architect in the region: houses in his individual style&#151;bows or canted bays, crisp fa&ccedil;ades, and chaste interiors&#151;appear throughout the Cotswold&#150;Severn area. But some are poorly documented and can only be connected to Keck by style or his association with Nash. Works at Castleditch, Underdown, Canon Frome Court, Hanbury Hall, Burghill Court, and Sufton Court, all in Herefordshire and Worcestershire, have been attributed to Keck; better-documented are Forthampton Court, near Tewkesbury, for the daughter of Bishop Isaac Maddox, and the great bows of Longworth Hall, about 1788. In south Wales there is one documented work, the magnificent Margam orangery, designed in 1787 for Thomas Mansel Talbot. Meanwhile, several commissions are recorded in Gloucestershire: Flaxley Abbey (1777), Moreton in Marsh church (1790), Barnsley Park (<i>c</i>.1780), alterations to Batsford Park (1778&#150;81), and finally, his most important Cotswold commission, the rebuilding of Hill House (1784&#150;92; now Rodborough Manor) for Sir George Paul.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life Keck was increasingly involved in institutional work. Earlier in 1779 he had designed a new lock on the Stroudwater Canal; between 1784 and 1788 &pound;3431 was spent providing a &#145;thorough and complete repair&#146;  (V. Green, <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of the City of Worcester</span>, 2, 1796, 28&#150;9) of Worcester gaol, where Nash was on the restoration committee.<br>
<br>On the day after the collapse of Hereford Cathedral in April 1786, Keck was on the scene providing plans for temporary repairs to the cathedral. In August 1788 the <span class="italic">Hereford Journal</span> announced that Keck was to provide plans for the restoration of the county gaol, but owing to illness they did not materialize until July 1789; by this time the justices had decided to build a new gaol to the designs of John Nash. Keck and Nash were jointly consulted in September 1793 by the trustees of the new asylum in Hereford, where Nash also succeeded as architect. A stone in King's Stanley churchyard recorded Keck's death on 4 October 1797, aged seventy. A daughter was also buried in the same churchyard: Mary, wife of Samuel Sadler, vicar of Sandhurst, Gloucestershire, who died in August 1790.<br>
