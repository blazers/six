<span class="headword">Manning,  Owen</span>  (1721&#150;1801), <span class="occ">county historian and Old English scholar</span>, was the younger son of Joseph Manning (1688?&#150;1773?) and Mary Manning of Orlingbury, Northamptonshire. He is said to have been born at Orlingbury on 11 August 1721 and was baptized there on 5 September. He was educated at Huntingdon grammar school and at Queens' College, Cambridge, where he was admitted pensioner on 29 March 1737 and graduated BA in 1741; he proceeded MA in 1744 and BD in 1753. While an undergraduate Manning suffered two near-death experiences, the first when he was supposed to have died of smallpox and was laid out for burial, and the second when he fell into the River Cam after suffering an epileptic fit, and was thought to have drowned. From 1742 to 1755 he was a fellow of Queens', but he resigned his fellowship in 1755 to marry Catherine, daughter of Reade Peacock of Huntingdon, &#145;a reputable and substantial Tradesman &hellip; who was bred a Quaker&#146;  (Cole MSS, BL, Add. MS 5808, fol. 229<i>v</i>). They had three sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>Manning was ordained deacon at Lincoln on 25 September 1743 and priest at York on 21 September 1746; he held the Queens' living of St Botolph's, Cambridge, from 1749 to 1760. He was prebendary of Lincoln from 1757 to 1801. Dr John Thomas, bishop of Lincoln, to whom he was chaplain, collated him to the prebends of South Scarle (5 August 1757; installed 13 August) and Milton Ecclesia (15 March 1760; installed 5 April). Disappointed in his attempt to be elected president of Queens' in 1760, Manning was appointed that year rector of Chiddingfold in Surrey, which he held until 1768, and in 1763 was presented by Dr Green, dean of Salisbury, to the vicarage of Godalming in Surrey, where he lived until his death. In 1769 he was presented to the rectory of Peper Harow, an adjoining parish, by Viscount Midleton. Like many Queens' men of his time, Manning held strong views in support of civil and religious liberty. This is apparent from his published sermons and pamphlets, including his <span class="italic">Discourses on Election and Justification</span> (1790) and his <span class="italic">Discretion in Matters Pertaining to Religion</span> (1788). It is clear from anecdotal evidence that he was most conscientious in the execution of his pastoral duties in Godalming.<br>
<br>However, it was his scholarly contributions in two different but connected fields, Old English studies and county history, that made Owen Manning a significant figure in the history of the study of early English language and history. He is best-known for his <span class="italic">History of Surrey</span>, completed and published posthumously in three volumes by his collaborator William Bray from 1804 to 1814. It is regarded as one of the best of the older county histories. The first volume in particular, which is largely Manning's work, is distinguished by his careful attention to all available documents, including medieval ones, which he had sought out over nearly forty years, and by its &#145;terse and workmanlike language&#146;  (Simmons, 1.vii). Manning was one of the first historians to make use of the <span class="roman">Domesday</span> records for the history of a county and he had prepared a facsimile of them for his <span class="italic">History</span> as early as 1773.<br>
<br>Manning's earlier work was in Old English studies, and it too is of a high standard. His first achievement was to augment, improve, and publish the Old English and Gothic dictionary of his friend Edward Lye, who died in 1767 with the dictionary unfinished. Manning devoted more than four years to preparing the <span class="italic">Dictionarium Saxonico et Gothico-Latinum</span> for the press, and, when it was published in 1772, it contained a good deal of original research by Manning himself. A full assessment of the importance of Manning's lexicographical work is yet to be made, but the Manning&#150;Lye dictionary served as the model for the 1838 Old English dictionary of Joseph Bosworth.<br>
<br>Manning was the first to publish the Old English text, with literal and free translations and notes, of the will of King Alfred from the <span class="roman">Liber Vitae</span> of the New Minster and Hyde Abbey, Winchester (BL, Stowe MS 944), which had come into the possession of Thomas Astle, who commissioned Manning to prepare an edition of the document. The will was published in 1788, edited by Sir Herbert Croft and with a preface by Astle. On the advice of Richard Gough, Manning also acted as a consultant to Daines Barrington on the text of the <span class="roman">Alfredian Orosius</span> which Barrington published in 1773. At various times he worked on material for an edition of the Caedmon manuscript of Old English poetry, as had Lye, although neither of them ever published it. Manning was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 10 December 1767 and fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1770.<br>
<br>In his final years Manning lost his sight, and he died at the vicarage in Godalming on 9 September 1801 after a short attack of pleurisy. He was buried in the churchyard of St Peter and St Paul, Godalming, on 14 September. According to his will, he wanted no memorial but his parishioners held him in such high esteem that &#145;some of the principal ones amongst them placed a handsome marble tablet to his memory in the Church; and some private friends put an Inscription on a head-stone in the Church yard&#146;  (Bray, 1.vii); the memorial is now in the north chapel of Godalming church. He was survived by his wife and all their children, except their eldest son and one daughter.<br>
