<span class="headword">Pemberton,  Israel</span>  (1715&#150;1779), <span class="occ">merchant and politician in America</span>, was born on 19 May 1715 in Philadelphia, the first son of Israel Pemberton and his wife, Rachel, daughter of Charles Read of Burlington, New Jersey. The elder Israel was a leading Philadelphia merchant, Pennsylvania legislator, and Quaker meeting clerk. Rachel Pemberton was active in the Philadelphia women's meeting. Israel junior's grandparents Phineas and Phoebe Pemberton were among the original Quaker founders of Pennsylvania.<br>
<br>Brought up to strict Quaker principles, Israel attended the Friends' school in Philadelphia and displayed aptitudes for learning and leadership at an early age. He also revealed an impetuous nature. In 1735 the tall, slender, dark-haired, blue-eyed youth went to England to represent his father's business. Pemberton engaged in some risky mercantile practices, and received his father's censure for buying too many goods on credit. Just as troubling to his family, Pemberton's rash courtship violated Quaker etiquette. Before leaving for England, Israel had become close to Sarah Kirkbride of Pennsbury in Bucks county. But when Israel left without making an official proposal, another Quaker, Anthony Morris, pursued Kirkbride's hand. Instead of waiting for Kirkbride officially to turn Morris down, Pemberton continued his own pursuit and caused a family feud that culminated in Morris's claim that he had been too &#145;free&#146; with Kirkbride for her to be &#145;fit for anyone else&#146;  (Thayer, 8). Ultimately the controversy did not irreparably tarnish Israel's and Sarah's standing, for on 30 March 1737 the Philadelphia meeting approved and oversaw their marriage.<br>
<br>By 1745 Pemberton had become a leading Philadelphia merchant. His ships transported flour, rice, tobacco, sugar, molasses, rum, butter, other foodstuffs, lumber, other wood products, cloth, and even servants on transatlantic circuits that made stops in the British Isles, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Italy, the Madeira Islands, the middle colonies, the Chesapeake, South Carolina, Georgia, and the West Indies. In his early days as a merchant, despite his Quaker commitment to pacifism, Pemberton supplied naval fleets and used military escorts. He also developed schemes to avoid or minimize insurance payments to British and Dutch bankers. Although Pemberton continued to trade, by the 1750s he had turned his attention away from transatlantic shipping and instead concentrated on land and the financial markets.<br>
<br>Pemberton lived in the most fashionable district in Philadelphia on the corner of Chestnut and Third streets, occupying a large brick building that was noted for its carefully manicured garden. He also owned several other estates near Philadelphia, including a country home in New Jersey called Bolton. His wife, Sarah, died in 1746, leaving him with seven children. Shortly thereafter, in 1747, Pemberton married the twice-widowed, older, and wealthy Mary Jordan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stanbury (<i>d</i>. 1778). Like his first marriage, this one caused some grumbling in the Quaker community when Samuel Jordan, Mary's brother-in-law, complained that the couple had been too hasty. But again, as with his first marriage, the Quaker meeting approved the wedding.<br>
<br>Pemberton was very active in Philadelphia's civic affairs and especially the Quaker church. He supported the Library Company, bringing in books, serving briefly as president, and revising the charter. Pemberton was appointed clerk of the Friends' public school in 1743 and managed its finances until his death. In 1752 Pemberton helped found the Pennsylvania Hospital and acted as a manager throughout his life. He also joined the Union Fire Company and made many contributions to private charity. His greatest influence came as a pilot of the Philadelphia Quaker meeting. In this capacity Pemberton corresponded with British Quakers and accompanied visiting ministers on their itinerant tours of America. Pemberton also served as an overseer of the press in 1743 and, most significantly, as the pre-eminent clerk of the Philadelphia yearly meeting from 1750 to 1759.<br>
<br>Pemberton was known as a powerful and contentious political leader. He briefly served as a Pennsylvania assemblyman in 1750, but was not re-elected. His political enemies in the colony derisively called him the &#145;King of the Quakers&#146;, and during the American War of Independence John Adams described him as an &#145;artful Jesuit&#146; who would try to &#145;break up Congress&#146;  (Thayer, 233, 212). Pemberton's biographer, Theodore Thayer, wrote that Pemberton's &#145;leadership and prominence rest[ed] largely upon the fact that he lacked so many of the qualities of a good Quaker&#146;  (ibid., 233). Pemberton did indeed fight hard, and he did so to defend many Quaker principles and interests.<br>
<br>Most notably, during the French and Indian War Pemberton argued that instead of battling Indians, British Americans should attempt to pacify them through diplomatic agreements. To this end Pemberton protested military tax bills, petitioned government officials, invited Indians to his home, advised Delawares during treaty proceedings, and conferred with colonial governors, Indian agents, and even generals. He helped Delaware leader Teedyuscung accuse Pennsylvania's proprietors of defrauding them. When Pennsylvania's Governor Denny tried to curb Quaker participation at a treaty conference, Pemberton threatened to publish Lord Halifax's letter that referred to Indians as &#145;foreign princes &amp; an Independent people&#146;  (Thayer, 139). Pemberton also founded the Friendly Association for Regaining and Preserving Peace with the Indians by Pacific Measures. This association appealed to Quakers and other pacifist groups to donate money, which was used to conduct Indian diplomacy, buy Indian gifts, support displaced Pennsylvanians, and ransom Pennsylvanian captives. Pemberton also wanted to use the contributions to stock a frontier post at Fort Pitt, which he hoped would enable him to trade fairly with Ohio valley Indians and eliminate French competition. But other trustees in the friendly association vetoed this profit-making venture, and Pemberton set up the business without them.<br>
<br>Pemberton was also a leader in the early abolitionist movement. In 1773 he unsuccessfully sued to free an enslaved Indian woman and her children. This incident led to the formation of Philadelphia's first abolition society, the Society for the Relief of Free Negroes unlawfully held in Bondage, in 1775. In addition, Pemberton paid visits to individual Quaker slave-owners to urge them to free their slaves.<br>
<br>During the 1760s and 1770s, Pemberton remained active in Quaker politics, though his brother James became the primary clerk of the Philadelphia meeting. In the 1760s he led a faction that opposed Benjamin Franklin's plan to remove the proprietary government and make Pennsylvania a royal colony. In the 1770s Pemberton urged Quakers to avoid all revolutionary associations, committees, and militias. In September 1777, as British armies closed in on Philadelphia during the revolutionary war, American authorities felt that the neutral Quakers might turn loyalist and exiled several of the most renowned leaders, including Israel Pemberton and his two brothers. The prisoners were escorted to and held in Winchester, Virginia, where three of the exiles died. Pemberton wrote many petitions arguing that they had not been duly charged. In addition he authored the pamphlet <span class="italic">An Address to the People of Pennsylvania</span> (1777), which recounted the Quaker side of the story. Pemberton asked his wife, Mary, secretly to distribute the pamphlet, which was also published in German. In April 1778 Mary (now seventy-five) and three other wives crossed to the American side, met George Washington, and petitioned the executive council to release their husbands. The council informed them that their husbands had been freed the previous day.<br>
<br>Pemberton returned to find his estates ransacked by British soldiers. Inflation and the gambling of his son Joseph further damaged his financial situation and he had to sell off much of his property. In October 1778 his wife died, and Pemberton's death followed soon after, in April 1779. His brother John said Israel had never recovered from the ordeal of exile. His funeral in Philadelphia was reportedly the largest in memory and attended by people of all denominations. Despite his losses during the war, Pemberton died a wealthy man. Anthony Benezet complained that he had willed his fortune of &pound;60,000&#150;70,000 to his profligate children and had left nothing to charity.<br>
