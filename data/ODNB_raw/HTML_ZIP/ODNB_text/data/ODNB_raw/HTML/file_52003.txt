<span class="headword">Bayning,  Paul</span>  (<em>c.</em>1539&#150;1616), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was the son of Richard Bayning, a gentleman from Dedham in Essex, and Anne, the daughter of John Baker of Ipswich. He emerges in 1572 as a factor for merchants trading to Portugal, though it seems that he was engaged in clandestine trade with Spain during an embargo, and he was caught by two Spanish pinnaces from Vigo, and roughed up by his captors. He was soon involved in the Venice trade, and along with his brother Andrew (<i>c</i>.1544&#150;1610), with whom he probably acted in partnership, was among the Venice merchants absorbed into the Levant Company when it was incorporated in 1592. This was a hugely lucrative trade (the port books show Bayning importing currants, silks, cotton wool, and spices), but one vulnerable to the deteriorating international situation. When Philip II ordered the seizure of English cargoes in 1585 Bayning and his partner sued for losses amounting to &pound;37,422. He was unsurprisingly among the English merchants who turned to privateering, contributing a ship to the Cadiz expedition in 1587, and investing heavily in Sir James Lancaster's Pernambuco venture of 1595, and the earl of Cumberland's Puerto Rico expedition of 1598. Alongside Sir John Watts, whose son was Bayning's godchild, he was one of the leading privateering magnates of his generation, and like many of them he was a sponsor of the East India Company at its inception, becoming its treasurer in 1600, and selling it his ship the <i>Great Susan</i>.<br>
<br>Bayning was one of the new breed of thrusting, outward-looking, and frankly abrasive merchants; his relationship with the more conservative city establishment was always tense. He had secured his city freedom by unconventional means; not having served an apprenticeship in one of the trading companies, he was made free by redemption at the request of the lady mayoress, Elizabeth Ryvers, in November 1574. It was a controversial move, as the aldermen followed his admission with an immediate order that no merchant be admitted in this fashion in the future, while Bayning himself played off the Mercers and Grocers to avoid paying any fees. Nevertheless he accepted election as alderman in February 1593, and served as sheriff for the year 1593&#150;4. His tenure of the latter office was characteristically tempestuous, as he fell out with the lord mayor by making a novel claim to appoint an important legal officer, the secondary of the counter. Not only had Bayning sought to appropriate patronage that did not belong to the admittedly expensive office of sheriff, but he also failed to show due respect to the mayor, who complained to the privy council that Bayning had neglected the &#145;ordinary attendance due to my place&#146;, showing &#145;open contempt not so much of myself as of order and magistracy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 4.521). Bayning was probably not committed to city politics: his attendance record at the court of aldermen after 1594 was only 22 per cent, worse than that of any of his peers.<br>
<br>It was probably the duties of hospitality entailed upon the shrievalty that explain Bayning's purchase for &pound;1300 from Sir Francis Drake of a substantial city mansion called The Erber; next to the church of St Mary Bothaw, it was previously inhabited by George, duke of Clarence, and had been recently rebuilt by another city magnate, Sir Thomas Pullison (it is now the site of Cannon Street railway station). The house was sufficiently grand to be regularly requisitioned by the authorities for lodging visiting ambassadors. But however magnificent the outward face of the Bayning household, all was not well within.<br>
<br>Bayning's first wife, Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Mowse), about whom little is known, had died of a consumption at the age of twenty-eight in 1579. He remarried, probably in 1581, his second wife being Susanna Norden (<i>d</i>. 1623), daughter of a Suffolk gentleman. Perhaps the marriage was happy at the outset, for Bayning named ships after her&#151;<i>Susan's Handmaid</i> and the <i>Great Susan</i>&#151;and his heir, baptized Paul, was born in the Armada year of 1588. But six years later the marriage had broken down. It is possible that Susanna's adulterous relationship with Jonas Bodenham, one of Drake's captains (her husband's involvement with privateering doubtless made for some heady company) caused the breakdown, but it is not clear whether this liaison began before or after Bayning expelled his wife from the house and refused further communication with her in 1594. In 1597 Susanna complained to Richard Bancroft, bishop of London, and when he prevaricated, to Lord Treasurer Burghley. Bayning attempted a series of legal manoeuvres to avoid answering, but eventually in July 1598 the bishop ordered him to take his wife back. This did not end the matter, for in December 1600 the couple's case came before the high commission and a decree of separation was issued. The case made the Baynings obvious targets for the scandalmongers. James Abell, a disgruntled servant dismissed from Bayning's household, was accused of conspiracy to libel with Susanna's lover Bodenham and the printer and playwright Henry Chettle. The libel accused Bayning of buggery, and although the charge is unproven, the fact that rumours like this were circulating was a sign of how low his stock had fallen.<br>
<br>Bayning was in line for the mayoralty, and his domestic circumstances must have compromised his credibility. It is therefore unsurprising that he sought to be discharged from his position as alderman in March 1602, though John Chamberlain said that &#145;it was for spite, that he would not have his wife Lady Mayores&#146;  (McClure, 1.144). But Bayning had not given up his harassment of his wife. In the face of her attempts at a reconciliation, he promoted a bill against adultery in parliament in 1604, which as she pointed out to Sir Julius Caesar, &#145;doe argue in him a contynavall mallece, and therfor small hope of faythfull reconciliation&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 161, fol. 161). The bill was thrown out by the Lords, who were alive to Bayning's vendetta. The couple's continuing separation still vexed the authorities, for in 1606 James I had to order through the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishop of London that Bayning continue to make maintenance payments to his wife. When he died, he did leave her an annuity of &pound;300, but that was the limit of her claim on the estate. Susanna Bayning always had her supporters&#151;&#145;that helpless (though I hope guiltless) poor woman&#146;, according to Lady Ursula Walsingham  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 7.317)&#151;and the stain on her reputation did not prevent her remarriage, to Sir Francis Leigh.<br>
<br>Little is known of Bayning's last years. He probably retired from active trade and concentrated on his substantial landed estate&#151;at his death he possessed seven manors in Suffolk and Essex. But if this was the case, his household always retained traces of his exotic career. Among his bequests was one of &pound;10 to John Simpson, the minister of St Olave, Hart Street, of which half was to be used for &#145;instructing Anthony my Negro in the principles of the Christian faith and religion when he shalbe fitt to be baptised&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/128, fol. 256<i>v</i>). Bayning died on 30 September 1616, when he was said to be aged seventy-seven, and was buried on 1 October in the church of St Olave, Hart Street, where there survives an interesting monument to him and his brother Andrew: they stand on a corner wall, with busts of Andrew facing west and Paul facing south. Paul had inherited the bulk of his brother's estate in 1610, and their combined fortunes provided the launching pad for the career of Paul's heir, his son Paul (1588&#150;1629), later Viscount Bayning, whose moneylending enabled him to leave an estate worth &pound;153,000 in goods, as well as extensive properties in Essex and Suffolk.<br>
