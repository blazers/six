<span class="headword">Davis,  Richard</span>  (1750&#150;1814), <span class="occ">surveyor</span>, was baptized at Windsor on 22 July 1750, the second of four sons of John Davis (<i>d</i>. 1762), clockmaker and locksmith, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1764). He entered Eton College on 24 May 1757 and left in 1761. The family had a long association with the college, maintaining the school clock and doing other small building works. His name next appears in a notice in <span class="italic">Jackson's Oxford Journal</span> of 6 October 1781, advertising his services in selling a gentleman's property in Stokenchurch, Oxfordshire, in which he describes himself as &#145;Land-Surveyor at Lewknor&#146;. Another notice throws some light onto his missing years: &#145;RICHARD DAVIS, of LEWKNOR &hellip; (removed from Hammersmith) Surveys and Plans ESTATES, and transacts every other Kind of Business with respect to the Purchasing, Selling, or Letting of Estates, Houses &amp;c. on the most reasonable Terms&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jackson's Oxford Journal</span>, 23 March 1782, 3). Davis generally referred to himself as &#145;Richard Davis of Lewknor&#146;, as here, to avoid confusion with Richard Davis of nearby Bloxham, also a surveyor. In 1784 Davis secured his first commission; this was as surveyor to the enclosure in Stanford in the Vale and he prepared a map of the enclosure (now lost). In 1785 he undertook the survey and valuation of the manor of Stutteridge, near Stokenchurch, Oxfordshire. In 1786 Davis was appointed topographer to his majesty King George III by the earl of Salisbury, lord chamberlain of the household, and he retained this designation until his death. The royal appointment is not readily explicable although his grandfather had been clockmaker to George II and his father received the royal warrant as locksmith to Windsor Castle: but the appointment certainly gave a major impetus to Davis's career, and from then on his services were frequently sought as surveyor of estates as far afield as Wales; he was also commissioner to the enclosure in Oxfordshire and in Berkshire.<br>
<br>Davis's home at Lewknor was close to Oxford and he gained numerous commissions from Oxford colleges, including Merton College and New College, as well as from the university itself. In 1787 Davis was asked by Christ Church to survey the open fields and old enclosures in the parish of Benson, for which he also produced a beautifully penned terrier, with the titles highlighted in gold leaf, in which he used decimal fractions for both acreages and shilling values. This was one of several surveys he did for the college. Davis also worked for the board of agriculture, who in 1794 published his <span class="italic">General view of the agriculture of the county of Oxford with observations on the means of its improvement</span>, the forerunner of Arthur Young's edition of 1813. In his <span class="italic">View</span> Davis included a small-scale map of the county compiled by himself.<br>
<br>Davis's &#145;New map of the county of Oxford from an actual survey&#146; was produced in response to the Society of Arts' encouragement of large-scale county mapping. In 1790, when the first advertisement for the map appeared, publication was planned for August 1792, but this turned out to be far too optimistic. The price for each map was to be 2&frac12; guineas with 1 guinea to be paid at the time of subscribing. The map was finally published on 1 August 1797 by John Cary of the Strand, London, in sixteen sheets, at a scale of 2 inches to the mile (1:31,680), in an edition estimated to have been of no more than 200, of which 34 are known to be extant. The scale of 2 inches to the mile was chosen as it had been used by John Rocque for his map of neighbouring Berkshire. Subscribers' copies were numbered in the upper left-hand corner of the title sheet and signed by Davis. The map shows the Oxfordshire landscape before enclosure in most instances. An inset plan of the city of Oxford gives detailed and up-to-date information about changes in the city since previous maps were published. A facsimile edition by Oxfordshire County Libraries was published in 1975 under the editorship of Philip Riden.<br>
<br>Davis lived the comfortable existence of the country gentleman. He was fond of hunting and his name regularly appeared on the Oxfordshire game duty lists. As the owner of a sizeable estate Davis was active in local affairs and he frequently attended parish meetings. He was also head of a large family; with his wife, Anne&#151;of whom nothing beyond her name is known&#151;he had three sons and four daughters. Surveying various estates belonging to Oxford colleges and acting as commissioner to the enclosures provided Davis with a handsome income. By 1790 he could afford to buy an estate at Aston Rowant, Oxfordshire. He built a comfortable <i>cottage orn&eacute;</i> there called Grove Cottage where, on 10 January 1814, he died. He was buried in Lewknor churchyard on 15 January. Davis's wife and son Thomas managed the estate until 1832 when it was sold. Davis's other goods were divided between his surviving two daughters, Elizabeth and Caroline; the latter received also the copper plates of his survey of Oxfordshire. Davis is a good example of a successful estate and county surveyor who was simultaneously involved in the business of agricultural improvements.<br>
