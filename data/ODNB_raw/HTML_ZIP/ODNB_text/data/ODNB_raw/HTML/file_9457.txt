<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Finger,  Gottfried <span class="st"> [Godfrey]</span></span>  (<em>c.</em>1655&#150;1730), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born in Olomouc, Moravia, where Georg Finger, his father or brother, was cantor at St Mo&#345;ice. His mother was Marina Finger. Gottfried Finger presumably spent an early part of his career in the service of the prince-bishop Karl Liechtenstein-Kastelcorno, for pieces composed and copied by Finger survive in the prince-bishop's music collection at Krom&#283;&#345;&iacute;&#382;.<br>
<br>According to J. G. Walther's <span class="italic">Musikalisches Lexicon</span>, Finger was in Munich in 1682. He may have arrived in London as early as 1685, performing in a concert with August K&uuml;hnel in November of that year. Certainly there is further evidence to suggest that he was in London by 1686; a manuscript of recorder music containing pieces by Finger, Keller, Courteville, and others contains an inscription on the first folio that reads, &#145;scripsit Londra 1686&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 4899). He was definitely in London by the spring of 1687, when he received a post in James II's new Catholic chapel by a warrant dated 5 July 1687, backdated to 25 March. In 1688 he published his op. 1, a set of twelve sonatas for varied combinations of strings and continuo. He dedicated it to James II, stating that the sonatas were intended for use in the Catholic chapel.<br>
<br>When James II went into exile in 1688, Finger remained in London and started a successful freelance career. Some of Finger's music, however, accompanied the king to France: airs and sonatas by Finger appear in several manuscripts associated with the Stuart court in exile. Finger quickly became a central figure in London's musical life. He published several collections aimed at the growing amateur music market. <span class="italic">IV Sonatas or Solos</span> (1690) was the first collection published in England of sonatas for solo instrument and continuo, containing three for violin and three for recorder; <span class="italic">A Collection of Choice Ayres</span> (1691) consists of suites for two and three recorders, and <span class="italic">A Collection of Musick in Two Parts</span> (1691) is a varied collection for recorders, violins, and continuo. Finger composed minor-key trumpet music (the earliest known in England) for the St Cecilia celebrations of 1691, composed the ode for 1693, and gave concerts with Giovanni Battista Draghi at York Buildings at least from November 1693.<br>
<br>Finger's career in the theatre seems to have begun in 1694, when he composed a song, &#145;Awake unhappy man&#146;, for a revival of George Chapman's <span class="italic">Bussy d'Ambois</span>. His career as a composer of theatre music was in full swing by 1695, when Thomas Betterton and his colleagues seceded from the United Company and began acting at Lincoln's Inn Fields. He wrote a suite and a song for their first production, Congreve's <span class="italic">Love for Love</span> (30 April 1695), and contributed to at least seven more plays between then and the spring of 1697. When Henry Purcell died suddenly in 1695, Finger composed the music for James Talbot's ode <span class="italic">Weep All ye Muses</span>, performed on 13 January 1696. Talbot, professor of classical languages in Cambridge, seems to have known Finger well, and consulted him for his unfinished treatise on music. Nothing is known of Finger's activities between 8 April 1697 and 17 February 1699, when a concert of vocal and instrumental music was given at York Buildings for his benefit. It is possible that he spent the time abroad in France, Italy, or the Low Countries (or even all three): on 1 December 1701 some music belonging to Finger was advertised as:<blockquote>A Choice Collection of Vocal and Instrumental Music in Italian, French and English, composed by several great masters (the Italian music being most of them originals) with a catalogue given Gratis &hellip; this being the Collection of a Great Master, who has left the land.</blockquote>The notice added that the music had been &#145;made on his travels thr&ocirc; Italy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diverting Post</span>, 1 Dec 1701).<br>
<br>On his return to London Finger plunged once again into the city's theatrical life, writing music for at least nine plays and two semi-operas mounted by Christopher Rich's company at Drury Lane, though his career in England came to an abrupt end when he entered the competition to set William Congreve's masque <span class="italic">The Judgment of Paris</span> and came only fourth, being beaten by John Weldon, John Eccles, and Daniel Purcell; his setting was performed at Dorset Garden on 28 March 1701, and again with the other three on 3 June. According to Roger North, Finger, &#145;having lost his cause, declared he was mistaken in his musick, for he thought he was to be judged by men, and not by boys, and thereupon left England and has not bin here since&#146;  (<span class="italic">Roger North on Music</span>, 312). By December Finger was in Vienna, where the British ambassador reported that, despite complaining that the duke of Somerset had been partial to Eccles and Weldon, Finger planned to perform Eccles's setting in Vienna.<br>
<br>In 1702 Finger was in Berlin in the service of the queen of Prussia, Sophie Charlotte, where according to Walther he composed more operas; also during this period a number of his instrumental collections were published by Roger of Amsterdam. By 1706 he was in Breslau in the service of Duke Karl Philipp of Neuberg, the younger brother of the elector palatine. He remained in Karl Philipp's service for the rest of his life; in October 1707 he was a <i>Kammermusiker</i> in the Innsbruck court <i>Kapelle</i>, and he rose to the position of <i>Konzertmeister</i> in 1708. By this time he was married to his wife Katherina Elizabeth, a harpsichordist. 1708 also saw Finger return to Berlin, where two of his operas, <span class="italic">Der Sieg der Sch&ouml;nheit &uuml;ber die Helden</span> and <span class="italic">Roxane und Alexanders Hochzeit</span>, were performed. He seems to have maintained his post as <i>Konzertmeister</i> as he followed the court to Neuberg an der Donau in 1717, to Heidelberg in 1718, and to Mannheim in 1720. Finger's last years were largely spent composing chamber music and stage works for the court of the elector palatine at Mannheim and D&uuml;sseldorf. His name last appears on the list of musicians in Mannheim in 1723, and he was buried there on 31 August 1730, having presumably died earlier in that year.<br>
<br>Finger was a formidable bass viol virtuoso, and was appointed to teach the instrument in the abandoned scheme for a royal academy in 1695. He did not publish any solo bass viol music, but a group of manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, and a manuscript at Schloss S&uuml;nching, Germany, reveal him to have been one of the most important composers for the instrument of his time. Other important manuscripts are in the Hudebn&iacute; Archiv, Krom&#283;&#345;&iacute;&#382;, Czech Republic, and at Durham Cathedral Library. Seven, apparently early, suites for baryton and bass viol are the earliest surviving ensemble pieces for the baryton. He also composed some of the earliest surviving music using the viola d'amore. He was heavily influenced by his Moravian and Bohemian contemporaries (Pavel Vejvanovsk&yacute; and Heinrich Biber in particular). Like many other continental composers who went to England, Finger had to adapt his relatively flamboyant Austro-Bohemian style to suit the more conservative English audiences. He took music from Moravia with him to England, and some of these copies are preserved in Oxford and Durham. Finger's style may have sat strangely with English audiences at first, but he never discarded the central European love for colourful instrumentation and musical inventiveness for which his native land is justly renowned.<br>
