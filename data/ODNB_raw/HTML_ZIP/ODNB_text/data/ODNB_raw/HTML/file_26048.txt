<span class="headword">South,  Robert</span>  (1634&#150;1716), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and theologian</span>, was born on 4 September 1634 at Hackney, Middlesex, the son of Robert South, a London merchant with roots in Lincolnshire, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Berry, daughter of Captain John Berry of Lydd, Kent. He attended Westminster School and was elected a king's scholar in 1647. Like his schoolmates John Dryden and John Locke he became a favourite of Dr Richard Busby, its staunchly royalist headmaster. On the morning of King Charles's execution, 30 January 1649, Busby kept his students indoors; according to the memoir prefaced to the 1717 edition of his sermons South read the day's Latin prayers to the school, which would have been an extraordinary favour for a fourteen-year-old pupil. With Busby's blessing, in 1651 South took the closed route laid out for king's scholars between Westminster and Christ Church, Oxford. He was elected head of the list of scholars bound for Christ Church, and matriculated from there on 11 December 1651. A relative, Dr John South of New College, regius professor of Greek, contributed to his studentship of &pound;30. Unlike Locke, who followed him to Christ Church a year later, South bridled under John Owen, its Cromwellian dean. South graduated BA on 24 February 1655 and took his MA in June 1657.<br>
<br>While an undergraduate South attended illegal services according to the rites of the Church of England which were conducted by three ejected members of Christ Church, Richard Allestree, John Dolben, and John Fell, in rooms above Merton Street in Oxford. Here South secretly entered holy orders, probably in 1658. The royalist episcopal clergy of Oxford were rewarded at the Restoration. While Fell replaced Owen as dean of Christ Church, South's sermons of 1659&#150;60, tastefully furnished with Laudian railings against the presbyterians, had earned him the attention of the newly restored king's commissioners for ecclesiastical appointments: in August 1660 Edward Hyde, earl of Clarendon, lord chancellor of England and chancellor of Oxford University, made South the university's public orator and his own domestic chaplain. Clarendon disappointed South by not simultaneously granting him a canonship of Christ Church, which had been annexed to the oratorship under the Laudian and Caroline code for the reformation of Oxford in the 1630s. Clarendon, helped by Nathaniel Crew, fellow of Lincoln College and later bishop of Durham, and John Wallis, Savilian professor of mathematics at Oxford, did however see that South gained formal credentials in divinity: despite some grumblings, South was admitted both BD and DD on 1 October 1663.<br>
<br>The ejections which followed the 1662 <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> supplied more provisions of pluralism for Laudian avengers such as South. In 1663 he was installed prebendary of Westminster. In 1667 he became vicar of a parish in the diocese of St Asaph, north Wales, perhaps that of Llanrhaeadr, Denbighshire; there is little recorded of his involvement with the parish, but he probably maintained a curate there. On 29 December 1670 South finally received a canonship of Christ Church, and held it along with the university oratorship until 1677, when he resigned the latter. In the same year he travelled to Poland as chaplain to Clarendon's son, Laurence Hyde, the ambassador-extraordinary to John Sobieski, king of Poland; the purpose of the visit was to present gifts to Sobieski's daughter, who was Charles II's goddaughter. South described his travels in Poland in a long letter to Edward Pococke, regius professor of Hebrew at Oxford and a fellow canon of Christ Church. South respected the piety of Polish Catholics, echoing the respect with which high Anglicans were treating the devotional writing of Cardinal Robert Bellarmine by the late seventeenth century. South noted the generous livings of the Polish church and its widespread pluralism, but also pointed out the lack of pastoral care which resulted from absenteeism, avoided in the Church of England by the appointment of curates to deputize for absentee clergy. While South lived comfortably upon the inheritance of his father's estate in Caversham, Oxfordshire, his own will suggests that he provided for his curates well. In 1678 he became rector of Islip in Oxfordshire, a parish in the gift of Westminster School worth &pound;200 p.a. South directed &pound;100 to his curate and the rest towards educating the children of the parish. He rebuilt the chancel of Islip parish church in 1680, founded a school that still survived as a Church of England aided state funded school at the start of the twenty-first century, and in 1689 built a grand rectory which featured an expansive garden walled off from the street. With genuine Laudian sadness South often lamented the dispersal of church property which had followed the Reformation, and he believed that God avenged those who had built houses upon church ruins, houses &#145;gilded with the name of reformation&#146;  (South, <span class="italic">Twelve Sermons</span>, 339); his sermons mentioned stories of how providence routinely punished the enemies of the church, ranging from Cardinal Thomas Wolsey to the parliamentary defacers of Lichfield Cathedral during the civil wars. The mortar of South's Islip rectory was barely dry by 1695, but White Kennett included an illustration of it in his <span class="italic">Parochial Antiquities</span> of that year, perhaps to show the Anglican commitment to rebuilding church infrastructure following the wars.<br>
<br>South had been appointed a chaplain to James, duke of York, brother of Charles II, in 1667, and remained one through the Popish Plot. The Popish Plot and the exclusion crisis only strengthened South's opinions. In a sermon delivered in July 1678 and printed in 1679 he praised the rigours of a Jesuit education, while attacking Socinians as Epicureans who believed only what pleased them. Throughout his career South feared protestant nonconformity more than Catholicism. His royalist ridicule of the social inversions wrought by the &#145;sectarian barbarisme&#146;  (South, <span class="italic">Interest Deposed</span>, sig. A4<i>v</i>) of the interregnum, together with his belief in the divine right of kings, endeared him to both Charles II and James II. Following the accession of James II in 1685 both the younger Hydes became senior ministers. Laurence Hyde, earl of Rochester, was lord high treasurer, and Henry Hyde, second earl of Clarendon, lord lieutenant of Ireland, and with their patronage combining with the king's knowledge of him, South appeared poised to gain what he most wanted, a bishopric. Yet despite his views and his connections South never received one. Between 1681 and 1685 he had apparently been offered several offices which he had declined by citing the burden of his other duties, but there is a strong possibility that South simply was not offered an office that he wanted. He may have been offered an Irish bishopric early in James's reign, for the see of Cashel became vacant in 1685, but if so he declined it. In July 1686 he wrote to William Sancroft, archbishop of Canterbury, imploring him for high office, perhaps the bishopric of Oxford, which South would have preferred above any other. Nothing came of South's request.<br>
<br>Neither South's professional ambitions nor his scruples were troubled by James's Catholicism, but circumstances eventually forced him to reconsider his sacramental view of kingship. His 1721 biographer claimed that South had promised to &#145;change his black Gown for a Buff-Coat&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life of the Late Reverend Dr. South</span>, 112) in order to suppress the rising of James Scott, duke of Monmouth, in 1685, and in 1688 he showed no enthusiasm for the proposed invasion of William of Orange. Once William had landed he delayed declaring for either James or William for as long as possible. Flummoxed like many Anglicans by the conflict between legitimacy and orthodoxy he delivered sermons which offered ecumenical jeremiads but conclusively evinced a more passionate hatred of protestant rebels than of Catholics. James might have failed England, but South feared more the consequences of William, who combined military aggression with a Calvinist protestantism alien to South's vision of the established church, ascending the throne. South strained to change his colours, and he took the new oaths of allegiance on 31 July 1689, the last day possible to do so without incurring suspension as a nonjuror. His confidence in divine right grudgingly fell beneath the accommodationist fiction that James had abdicated the throne by failing to protect his subjects, and so was consequently owed no obedience. By 1691&#150;2 South had fully finessed his transition into compliance with William and Mary: England, the chosen nation of God, had replaced the king as God's chosen vicegerent on earth, and the sovereignty of the conscience had displaced that of James II. These were dramatic changes for South, given his fervent espousal of divine right during the Restoration. Yet he retained the Augustinian dismissal of dissenters' consciences, holding that these were merely inferior consciences that needed coercion to improve them into orthodoxy. These changes may account for his redoubled hatred of the dissenters, the &#145;sly, sanctified sycophants&#146;  (South, <span class="italic">Twelve Sermons</span>, 2.547) of 1689, whom he genuinely believed sought nothing less than the destruction of the church itself.<br>
<br>South accommodated, but the politics of religion following the revolution of 1688 effectively excluded him from a bishopric for the next two decades, which he spent writing and preaching against the various, but in his mind related, enemies of the high-church position. First and most visible were the heirs of both civil war puritanism and Restoration presbyterianism: these South routinely depicted as unredeemably ignorant, of too low a social station to qualify for the ministry, and made literally insensible in the light of their extemporaneous preaching and their delusional claims to divine inspiration. The royalist memory of the civil wars consistently informed his polemic: such dissenters South frequently compared to the unread shop-hands who in his memory had seized the pulpits at knifepoint during the interregnum. South's attacks upon extemporaneous preaching and divine inspiration made him a royalist, but they did not make him a rationalist. For second among his foes came the dissenters who had embraced rationalism instead: these threatened South's mystical Christianity as the revolution had destroyed his sacramental view of kingship. Just as he blamed a French Dominican for introducing extemporary prayer into England, South blamed the philosophy of Ren&eacute; Descartes, the &#145;rational world&#146;  (South, <span class="italic">Tritheism</span>, sig. A2<i>v</i>) and its dependence on &#145;impartial reason&#146;  (ibid.) for the church's sufferings. For South the introduction of rationalism into theology, such as the Socinians' argument against the Trinity, had caused the church as much trouble as had the puritans and their radical brethren.<br>
<br>South hated inspired dissenters and rational Socinians with equal intensity, but he is most renowned for his attack upon William Sherlock, a fellow Anglican who sought to defeat the same enemies. Since 1690 Sherlock had been embarked upon a quixotic effort to demonstrate the reality of the Trinity with rationalist methods. This, he hoped, would unhand the Socinians with their own weapons. Yet for South mystery and incomprehensibility were the essence of the Trinity and of Christianity itself: Christianity was manifestly not reasonable. In 1693 and again in 1695 South gleefully dismembered Sherlock's argument in <span class="italic">Animadversions upon Dr. Sherlock's Book</span> (1693), and <span class="italic">Tritheism Charged upon Dr. Sherlock's New Notion of the Trinity</span> (1695). John Wallis, his old ally from Oxford and a fellow nemesis of Thomas Hobbes, attacked Sherlock as well. Yet the witty invective and genteel irony of South's performances should not conceal his resolute conviction that the end of Anglican orthodoxy could never justify the means of rationalism. His defence of the Trinity against Sherlock may be seen as a Laudian riposte to John Locke's similarly robust attack upon Robert Filmer in the first treatise: Lockean epistemology could dismantle divine right, but rationalism could never comprehend Christian mystery, however much it claimed to support orthodox doctrine. Yet South never took on Locke, whom he admired despite their many differences; Sherlock was dean of St Paul's and thus a dangerous insider, but Locke's Socinianism put him beyond the boundary of toleration itself.<br>
<br>South's health began to decline after 1698, and during Anne's reign he remained for the most part inactive, living in his house near Westminster Abbey, attending its services, and preparing volumes of his sermons for the press. South urged leniency for Henry Sacheverell during the latter's trial in March 1710, and with the downfall of the ministry of Sidney Godolphin, earl of Godolphin, and John Churchill, duke of Marlborough, later that year, his hopes for a bishopric revived for the first time since the 1688 revolution. When in 1713 he was offered the bishopric of Rochester, made vacant by the death of Thomas Sprat, South declined on the basis of his infirmity. Francis Atterbury, dean of Christ Church, prolocutor of convocation, and high-church champion, took that mitre instead in June 1713, and South fully approved. South died on 8 July 1716. After lying in state at the Jerusalem Chamber and then at the college hall of Westminster, South's corpse was attended by Atterbury to Westminster Abbey, where he was buried on 12 July near the steps of the altar, adjacent to the tomb of his beloved Busby. South's Laudian loyalties survived his accommodation with the revolution, and they ruled beyond the grave: he left &pound;200 in his will for twenty ejected nonjurors, while requiring other beneficiaries to conform to the prayer book worship as decreed by the 1662 <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>. Such stubbornness earned him the praise of the nonjuror Thomas Hearne, who described South as &#145;pretty honest, though he was a Complyer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks and Collections</span> of Thomas Hearne, ed. C. E. Doble and others, 5, 1901, 264).<br>
