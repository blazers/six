<span class="headword">Wordie,  William</span>  (1810&#150;1874), <span class="occ">carrier and contractor</span>, was born on 23 March 1810 at Stirling, son of John Wordie (1783&#150;1830), carrier, and Janet Stewart. William was locally educated and probably went from school into his father's modest cartage business in Stirling, running twice weekly between there and Glasgow. But by the late 1820s it had run into debt. John Wordie died suddenly on 30 June 1830, and left William to continue with half a dozen horses and carts, and many creditors. By 1837 he was paying these off by energetic pursuit of business, now offering a daily service to Glasgow. In that year he married, on 20 December, Janet (1814&#150;1901), daughter of the farmer and landowner Peter Jeffrey of Throsk, on the Forth below Stirling. They had two sons and five daughters. In 1837 also he took John McArthur of Stirling into a partnership, which lasted until 1852.<br>
<br>By the late 1830s road carriers in Scotland faced competition. The pioneer Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway opened in 1831, and the Edinburgh and Glasgow gained their act in 1838, and opened in 1842. Road transport between major centres would suffer although the railways did not as yet consider substantial goods traffic. To gain it they needed a collection and distribution organization, and this William Wordie and a few others in Scotland offered, as Pickfords did in England. In 1842 Wordie contracted with the new Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway to collect and forward goods by rail, using not only his carts but his own railway wagons. Cartage depots were opened at the stations, the first of many.<br>
<br>Railway expansion in Scotland was rapid, especially by the Caledonian company, who in 1849 opened a line from Glasgow to near Falkirk, where a junction was made with the Scottish Central, who had built through to Stirling and Perth, opened in 1848. By 1850 the railway reached Aberdeen via Coupar Angus and Forfar. In 1849 William Wordie had opened an office in Glasgow, and, probably in 1852, moved his head office there from Stirling; he had a house in Glasgow by this time. Freed now from the McArthur partnership, Wordie &amp; Co. rapidly expanded. The contract with the Caledonian had been won in 1851, and the Scottish Central and Aberdeen railways followed in 1854, so by the mid-1850s Wordie &amp; Co. was carrying for the companies which made up the line between Glasgow and Aberdeen via Perth and Dundee. An agreement with Pickfords was made, for forwarding goods, which was to endure until nationalization in 1948, and in 1865&#150;6 Wordies benefited by the Caledonian take-over of the companies forming the Aberdeen route. By this time William Wordie was moving further north. In 1860 he opened a depot in Inverness; he was already at Elgin, both now linked to Aberdeen by rail. In 1865 the Highland Railway was formed by amalgamation, and in 1868 Wordie &amp; Co. gained their cartage work. A year later the company secured the cartage contract for the neighbouring Great North of Scotland Railway.<br>
<br>By the time of his sudden death on 9 October 1874 at his Garngabber estate near Lenzie, following a heart attack, William Wordie controlled a large business, some 700 horses, with stables and depots from Glasgow to Thurso. He was an important figure in Scottish transport, and, as the obituary in the <span class="italic">Glasgow Star</span> said, &#145;Mr Wordie had always a kindly word, and his little, quick, energetic figure will be missed from the platforms of our northern railways&#146;  (quoted in the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>, 10 Oct 1874). He was buried at Stirling new cemetery on 12 October. He was survived by his wife; and his sons, John and Peter, expanded further, over to Ireland and into England, until it was said, &#145;You'll find Wordie &amp; Co. wherever you go&#146;.<br>
