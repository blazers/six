</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Colman,  George, the younger</span>  (1762&#150;1836), <span class="occ">playwright and theatre manager</span>, was born in London on 21 October 1762, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5976/', "George Colman the elder (bap. 1732, d. 1794)")</script>, playwright and theatre manager, and his mistress, later his wife, Sarah Ford (<i>d</i>. 1771). Little is known of his very early years, but Colman had all the advantages available to the son of a successful and well-connected father.<h2>
<a name="Childhoodandeducation"></a>Childhood and education</h2>Until the age of eight Colman lived at his father's house in London and his country estate, Bath House, in Richmond, at which time he was enrolled in Marylebone Seminary, which was intended to provide the boy with the foundation for admittance to an &eacute;lite public school. He had only a few months in school, however, before his mother died on 29 March 1771 from accidentally taking the wrong medication, and he was brought home. On 30 June 1772 Colman was admitted to Westminster School, which his father had attended. Colman records in his memoirs that during this period he first came to know many of the distinguished men of the age, including David Garrick, Edward Gibbon, and Samuel Johnson.<br>
<br>Colman was intended by his father for a career in law and was duly sent to Christ Church, Oxford, on 28 January 1780 on completing his studies at Westminster. By this time his father, already a prominent playwright and theatre manager, had purchased from Samuel Foote in 1777 the ownership of the summer company at the Little Theatre in the Haymarket, an event which had an enormous impact on the young man's life. Attracted by the glamour and excitement, Colman spent much time at the theatre to the detriment of his studies. Taking more extreme action, the father in autumn 1781 sent his over-stimulated son to King's College, Aberdeen, where he remained until he was called home early in 1784.<h2>
<a name="Firstwritingsandearlysuccess"></a>First writings and early success</h2>During this period Colman wrote his first play, <span class="italic">The Female Dramatist</span>, which was performed for the single night of 16 August 1782 at his father's theatre. In this conventional farce Mrs Metaphor, a widow whose life is dedicated to drama, is nearly tricked into marriage by a fortune-hunter, when at the last moment Beverly, a suitor for the hand of Mrs Metaphor's daughter, exposes the scam. While still at King's, Colman completed his second play, <span class="italic">Two to One</span>, late in 1783. It reached the boards at the Little Haymarket on 21 June 1784 and achieved a respectable run of nineteen evenings. This musical comedy anticipated many salient features of Colman's later successes, including witty dialogue, catchy songs, and broad-humoured stage action. Thus by the age of twenty-two Colman had joined an &eacute;lite circle including Congreve, Fielding, and his contemporary Sheridan, all of whom had achieved success on the London stage by their early twenties.<br>
<br>After a short trip to Paris, at his father's insistence Colman was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 9 August 1784, but he never seriously considered a career in law. While his father was away on holiday, he eloped to Gretna Green and on 3 October 1784 married Catharine Morris (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1820), a young actress at the Little Haymarket, initiating a long and unhappy relationship which was kept secret from Colman the elder for several years. How they lived is a mystery, as details of the early years of the marriage were completely suppressed by Colman and in the many reminiscences and biographies of his gossipy contemporaries such as Thomas Dibdin, Charles Matthews, and Joseph Munden. Summer 1785, in addition to seeing the premi&egrave;re on 9 July of his third play, <span class="italic">Turk and No Turk</span>, had, however, more serious implications. Colman the elder, while on holiday at Margate, suffered a serious illness which left him greatly weakened and which began a long period of decline in his health. The result was that the younger Colman began helping to run the theatrical company, a challenge for which he showed great capability. He was soon to excel in writing, as well. On 4 August 1787 Colman mounted his first great success, <span class="italic">Inkle and Yarico</span>, based on a tale from <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> (issue 11). Inkle's repentance and marriage to Yarico in the play's heavily sentimentalized finale, which completely reverses Steele's conclusion, no doubt was the deciding factor in the play's enormous initial and continuing popularity. This play convincingly demonstrated to the London theatrical community that the younger Colman had much in him of his father's dramatic abilities.<h2>
<a name="ThedeathofGeorgeColmantheelderandfinancialburdens"></a>The death of George Colman the elder and financial burdens</h2>Hit after hit followed in subsequent summers until 1794, bringing much glory and financial gain to the family concern. <span class="italic">Ways and Means</span> (1788), a farce, did not fare well in its first season, but went on to become one of Colman's most enduring plays. With <span class="italic">The Battle of Hexham</span> (1789) Colman created a new genre, the historical musical drama, which audiences found original and intriguing. He continued in this genre with the highly successful <span class="italic">The Surrender of Calais</span> (1791) and <span class="italic">The Mountaineers</span> (1793). His father's health, however, steadily declined, with death coming at last on 14 August 1794, but the elder Colman's financial condition had also suffered an irreversible disaster. Though he had amassed a considerable fortune during the previous thirty years through his playwriting achievements and his managerial acumen both at Covent Garden and the Little Haymarket, he learned to his horror in 1787 (as legal documents unknown to previous biographers reveal) that nearly his entire savings had been embezzled from him by his banker. In short, the elder Colman died in debt. The upshot was that Colman the younger, on coming into his estate in 1795, inherited and chose to honour those debts, which were substantial, requiring him to place a heavy mortgage on the theatre's income and facilities. This indenture burdened the son for the next two decades, ultimately driving him into debtors' prison and forcing him out of the theatre business. Thus the received wisdom regarding the activities of Colman the younger, namely that after the death of his father he ruined the business through improvidence, turns out to be incorrect.<br>
<br>During the years 1795 to 1805 Colman carried on as sole owner and manager of the theatre, but he was forced in 1795 to mortgage the business to repay his father's creditors. This arrangement remained in force until 1800, by which time the theatre's profits were falling. A new and, for Colman, even more financially restrictive arrangement was negotiated, but these terms could not be met. By 1805 the situation had eroded to the point where Colman had no choice but to sell off half the business for &pound;7000 to David Morris (his brother-in-law), Peter Tahourdin, and James Winston in order to raise most of the rather large sums demanded by the mortgagees. Thus while Colman certainly was not averse to the pleasures of gracious living, and later achieved some reputation for excessive drinking, he never had the resources after 1795 to waste on any but a modest scale.<br>
<br>A related misconception casts Colman as reckless in regard to the operations of the Haymarket Theatre and prone to disputes and litigation. Colman did spend large sums of money during 1803 and 1804 to finance two extravagant musical productions which never recovered their initial costs, and he certainly erred in thinking that this sort of play would be profitable. His wise choices of plays, however, greatly outnumbered his losers; had his fling with expensive musicals come ten years earlier, he would simply have moved on after licking his wounds. Unfortunately the timing was crucial, and the production debts were a factor forcing the sale of the shares in 1805.<br>
<br>As for the claim that Colman was unduly litigious, detractors note that he was involved in a protracted chancery dispute from 1809 to 1816 with his business partner and brother-in-law David Morris. The fault, however, was with Morris, not Colman. The extensive chancery records and newspaper accounts reveal that Morris, who had purchased Tahourdin's share in 1808, was a headstrong, uncompromising, quarrelsome, and often irrational partner, who in April 1809 sued not only Colman, but also an additional Haymarket partner, James Winston, who was himself aligned with Colman. This protracted and expensive litigation involved managerial control of the company and was so disputatious that the theatre was forced to remain closed during the summer of 1813. The court eventually found on behalf of the defendants, Colman and Winston, on every point, and Morris was ordered to pay all costs and to abide by the partnership guidelines set down by an arbitrator.<br>
<br>The sale of half the business in 1805 satisfied some of Colman's debtors, but S. J. Arnold, the son of Dr Samuel Arnold, the well-known composer, from whom Colman had borrowed significant sums, was not among them. After the elder Arnold's death, the son and widow had Colman arrested as of 28 February 1806. He was committed to the king's bench prison, but, as befitted those debtors with some assets, he was not required to remain within the prison proper but was restricted to residence within the rules until his discharge on 27 September 1817 resulting from the passage of an insolvency act by parliament. His first verified residence was on Lambeth Road as of August 1807, but he moved by March 1809 to 4 Melina Place on Westminster Road and then to 5 Melina Place by April 1816. From these locations he ran the Haymarket Theatre as best he could for over eleven years, wrote plays mainly for other theatres, and dealt with the legal challenges of his brother-in-law.<h2>
<a name="Laterworksandroyalappointments"></a>Later works and royal appointments</h2>Between 1795 and 1810 Colman wrote the lion's share of the plays on which his reputation is founded. The dozen or more hits include <span class="italic">The Iron Chest</span> (Drury Lane, 1795), <span class="italic">The Heir at Law</span> (Haymarket, 1797), <span class="italic">Bluebeard</span> (Drury Lane, 1798), <span class="italic">Feudal Times</span> (Drury Lane, 1799), <span class="italic">The Castle of Sorrento</span> (Haymarket, 1799), <span class="italic">The Review</span> (Haymarket, 1800), <span class="italic">The Poor Gentleman</span> (Covent Garden, 1801), <span class="italic">Love Laughs at Locksmiths</span> (Haymarket, 1803), <span class="italic">Who Wants a Guinea?</span> (Covent Garden, 1805), <span class="italic">We Fly by Night</span> (Covent Garden, 1806), <span class="italic">Forty Thieves</span> (Drury Lane, 1806), <span class="italic">The Africans</span> (Haymarket, 1809), <span class="italic">X.Y.Z.</span> (Covent Garden, 1810), <span class="italic">The Quadrapeds of Quedlinburgh</span> (Haymarket, 1811), <span class="italic">Doctor Hocus Pocus</span> (Haymarket, 1814), and <span class="italic">The Actor of All Work</span> (Haymarket, 1817). His greatest commercial success, <span class="italic">John Bull</span> (Drury Lane, 1803), earned him at least &pound;1200 and achieved the singular reputation of being the play receiving the largest author's fee ever paid to that time. In <span class="italic">John Bull</span>'s heavily charged scenes of sentimentality, dogged honesty, and patriotism Colman gauged precisely the audience's interests and needs in the midst of the darkest years of the Napoleonic wars. By 1809, therefore, although he was living in the rules of the prison, his reputation was at its peak when he was asked to write the prologue spoken by J. P. Kemble which opened the new Covent Garden Theatre on 18 September 1809, and some years later, though by then past his zenith, he also wrote the address for the opening of the newly rebuilt Drury Lane Theatre on 16 October 1822.<br>
<br>At long last in 1817 the financial and legal difficulties began to diminish. Soon after his release from debtors' prison, he negotiated the sale of the remainder of his interest in the Little Haymarket company. Cleared from his debts but now a considerably older and more subdued man, he thereafter wrote plays for the Covent Garden and Drury Lane theatres from time to time, but he never again matched his earlier successes. These later works include <span class="italic">The Gnome-King</span> (Covent Garden, 1819), <span class="italic">A Figure of Fun</span> (Covent Garden, 1821), <span class="italic">The Law of Java</span> (Covent Garden, 1822), <span class="italic">Stella and Leatherlungs</span> (Drury Lane, 1823), and <span class="italic">Five Minutes too Late</span> (Drury Lane, 1825).<br>
<br>On his ascent to the throne in 1821 Colman's old friend the prince regent did not forget him, and granted him the position of lieutenant of the yeomen of the guard, a sinecure which Colman kept for several years. An elegant watercolour portrait in the Victoria and Albert Museum depicts Colman in full regalia for the coronation. The royal appointment, however pleasing, was not lucrative, and Colman continued to live in the familiar confines of Melina Place until 1824, when he moved to the newly built Brompton Square. This relocation to the stylish Brompton area was made possible by yet another patronage appointment from the king in January 1824 to the position of examiner of plays, which Colman held until his death. He took the job seriously and performed his duties as examiner in a systematic and timely fashion, but his actions generated controversy, as his contemporaries claimed that he was censorious far beyond the range of his predecessors and hypocritically moralistic in his standards, since he now censored the very sort of material that appeared in his own successful plays. When questioned on these contradictions by the select committee on dramatic literature in 1832, Colman replied that he was careless in his younger days and that the examiner then ought to have required him to revise. Further, he asserted that he was earlier an author and was now an examiner, and sought to bring merit to the position.<br>
<br>In addition to plays, Colman also wrote several volumes of poetry, an autobiography, and songs, as well as prologues and epilogues for other playwrights. <span class="italic">My Nightgown and Slippers, or, Tales in Verse</span> appeared in 1797 and went through many editions, as did the ostensible sequel <span class="italic">Broad Grins</span> (1802). His <span class="italic">Poetical Vagaries</span> was published in 1813, no doubt necessitated by the financial problems due to the law proceedings then at their most strident point, and was followed three years later by <span class="italic">Eccentricities for Edinburgh</span> (1816). Late in life he brought forward a two-volume set of memoirs entitled <span class="italic">Random Records</span> (1830) which, sadly, covers only his childhood and very early adulthood. The decision to publish that segment only of his life suggests that he intended a continuation if sales were encouraging, but the project remained unfinished at his death. In addition Colman contributed extensively to the plays of his fellow dramatists. No complete census has been established, but scattered through the productions of the first thirty years of the nineteenth century one often may find his hand, as he contributed to the works of many dramatists, such as W. R. Rhodes's <span class="italic">Bombastes furioso</span> (August 1810) and Robert Jameson's <span class="italic">Love and Gout</span> (August 1814). His assistance was required so often that he complained to his partner James Winston in an unpublished letter that he was &#145;sickened by the ungrateful task of tinkering for Authors&#146;  (Burling, 297, n. 68).<br>
<br>Surprisingly little is known of Colman's personal life during his adult years. His autobiography ends with his early twenties, he did not keep a journal, and his surviving correspondence deals mainly with his professional activities. Such evidence as exists reveals that his marriage to Catharine Morris had completely collapsed by 1801, and she was provided with an income for life in the terms of the 1805 sales agreement. By 1801 Colman and Maria Gibbs (1770?&#150;1844), an actress of some repute, had established a felicitous relationship which lasted for the duration of Colman's life. After some years of simple cohabitation, they apparently married in the early 1820s following the death of Colman's estranged first wife, though no record of their betrothal has been found.<br>
<br>Colman fathered two sons, of whom the first, George, was born to Catharine Morris. The date of birth is not known but is usually assigned to 1785. George, the son, entered the army and achieved the rank of captain, but further details are elusive because two captains bearing the name of George Colman flourished during the same period. Thus without further evidence it is impossible to differentiate their careers. Somewhat more is known concerning the second son. Edmund Craven Colman apparently was born in June 1802 to Maria Gibbs, and his relationship with his parents was close for many years. Through his father's influence he entered royal service in 1824, his career lasting at least until 1833 and possibly until 1840.<br>
<br>Though Colman lived to seventy-four he was in poor health for much of the last thirty years of his life from the ravages of gout, as his surviving correspondence reveals. At the time of his death at 22 Brompton Square on 26 October 1836, he had left instructions for a quiet burial in the family vault in Kensington church, where he was duly interred with the remains of his father and grandfather. On 3 November a small party, which included Mrs Colman, Thomas Harris (the son of Henry Harris, the manager of Covent Garden Theatre), Dr Chinnock (his physician), General Phipps, and, presumably, his son Edmund, laid him to rest. Mrs Colman apparently inherited some of his property and immediately retired to Brighton, where she lived until her death in 1844.<br>
<br>Colman was much beloved among the members of the theatrical community for his good humour and generosity, many times providing assistance for performers and other friends in need. He achieved a considerable reputation as a dramatist, being termed in the press of the 1790s as second only to Sheridan, and when the illustrious creator of <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> died in 1814, Colman then became recognized as the foremost playwright of his era. Many of his plays remained repertory standards well into the nineteenth century, throughout the British empire and the United States, though in the early twenty-first century they are virtually unknown except to specialists.<br>
