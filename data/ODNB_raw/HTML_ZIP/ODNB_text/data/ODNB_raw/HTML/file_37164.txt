<span class="headword">Baxendale,  Joseph</span>  (1785&#150;1872), <span class="occ">transport entrepreneur</span>, was born at Lancaster on 28 September 1785, the eldest child in a family of two sons and two daughters of Josiah Baxendale (1761&#150;1835) of Castle Hill, Lancaster, surgeon, and his wife, Mabella (1756&#150;1829), daughter of Thomas Salisbury of Marshfield House, Settle. His father carried on a prosperous practice in Lancaster for some forty years and was a leading citizen. His mother was descended from a family of minor gentry from Newton in Bowland on the Lancashire&#150;Yorkshire border.<br>
<br>Baxendale was educated at Lancaster but left in 1804 for Preston, and afterwards London, where in 1806 he was with Samuel Croughton, wholesale linen draper, of 33 St Paul's Churchyard, the agent for Bannister, Hall &amp; Co., calico-printers of Preston. In 1809 Baxendale returned to Lancashire and became a one-fifth partner in Bannister Hall with Charles Swainson, his cousin through the Salisbury family. The &pound;4000 needed to purchase this share in the partnership Baxendale borrowed from his father and uncle. During these years he travelled much between London and Preston and resided at Darwen Cottage, Walton-le-Dale, near Preston. In 1816 he married Mary (1789&#150;1862), the youngest daughter of Richard Birley (1743&#150;1812) of Blackburn, a wealthy cotton mill owner and co-founder of the firm of Birley, Cardwell &amp; Co., cotton spinners of Blackburn. They had four sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Retiring from Bannister Hall in December 1816 with some &pound;6000 in net profit, Baxendale purchased in April 1817 a one-sixth share in the old established but ailing business of T. and M. Pickford &amp; Co., carriers of Manchester. The &pound;8000 Baxendale needed for this purpose was mostly borrowed from the trustees of his wife's marriage settlement. Two other new partners contributed similar capital at the same time, but the poor condition of the firm's affairs (culminating in the bankruptcy of Thomas and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48610/', "Matthew Pickford")</script> in 1820) increased Baxendale's active role in the business. By 1824 he was appointed the salaried managing partner.<br>
<br>During the next twenty years Baxendale's energetic and far-sighted management turned the firm's fortunes from bankruptcy to great prosperity and expanded it to become the largest carrying business in the United Kingdom, giving a comprehensive service to all major towns and cities in England and Scotland, and a household name in nineteenth-century Britain. Baxendale's leadership and personality became a legend with his employees, whose welfare was his constant concern.<br>
<br>In the 1820s and 1830s the firm relied on canals and roads for the transport of goods, but Baxendale early appreciated the advantages of railways and that Pickford &amp; Co. should go with them rather than against them. His dealings with the Liverpool and Manchester Railway commenced in 1829, even before that line was opened. In 1838 he accepted appointment as general superintendent of the new London and Birmingham Railway, and in 1837 became a director of the South Eastern Railway. From 1841 to 1845 he was chairman of that company and as such instrumental in the construction of the line to Paris via Folkestone and Boulogne. Initially unable to persuade his co-directors of the desirability of using Folkestone harbour, he purchased and developed the site personally in association with his friend Sir William Cubitt, but afterwards sold it to his company at no profit. He was, in the 1840s, a director of the Compagnie du Chemin de Fer du Nord and of the Amiens and Boulogne Railway, and was received by King Louis Philippe. In 1852 he suggested driving a tunnel under the channel to provide a direct rail route. In the late 1830s Baxendale acted as consultant for the construction of the Belgian state railway system. He was also a director of the Regent's Canal Company from 1836, and of the East India Railway Company in the 1840s.<br>
<br>Having, in 1823, moved the headquarters of Pickfords from Manchester to London, Baxendale moved his own residence from Eccles to Woodside, a spacious Georgian villa at Whetstone, near Finchley, on the Great North Road. From there he travelled continuously in his specially constructed fly carriage to check on the activities of his drivers, as he likewise did in his canal boat, the <i>Joseph</i>, on his firm's canal traffic. By degrees he bought out the remaining interests of the Pickford family and of his two other partners, Langton and Inman, so that by 1847 ownership of the business was entirely in the hands of Baxendale and his three elder sons, Joseph Hornby, Lloyd, and Richard Birley, who had become partners in 1843. Baxendale resigned active management of the firm to his sons in 1847 following a period of illness spent abroad. He also resigned his railway directorships.<br>
<br>The last twenty-five years of his life were spent in retirement at Woodside attending to his locally celebrated garden, his increasing investments, and his charitable interests, while keeping a watchful eye on the fortunes of the firm. He was a JP and deputy lieutenant for Middlesex and Hertfordshire and a magistrate for the liberty of St Albans, as well as visitor of the Jesus Hospital Charity, Barnet (which named Baxendale Street on its Bethnal Green estate after him). He was made associate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1837.<br>
<br>A tory in politics and a staunch member of the established church, Baxendale built St John's Church, Whetstone, on part of his estate there in 1832, and during fifty years' residence at Woodside purchased considerable property in the area as well as two agricultural estates at Henham in Essex and Little Dartmouth in Devon. Another investment was a block of houses in Park Village West, Regent's Park, sub-leased from his friend the architect John Nash. Baxendale occupied no. 16 as his London residence from 1838.<br>
<br>Baxendale died at Woodside on 24 March 1872, aged eighty-six, and was buried on 30 March with others of his family in the vault beneath St John's Church. His personal estate at death amounted to &pound;700,000 in investments, in addition to his freehold estates and the business of Pickford &amp; Co., by then entirely made over to his sons. A lifetime's endeavours brought rich rewards and gained him the admiration of Samuel Smiles, who named him &#145;the Franklin of Business&#146;  (Smiles, 172) and praised him for his enlightened treatment of his employees.<br>
<br>By the time of Baxendale's death the firm of Pickford &amp; Co., with its headquarters at 57 Gresham Street in the City of London, employed some 1800 horses and a huge staff of clerks, messengers, and porters. Its fortunes were directed by Baxendale's three elder sons, and in turn by three of his grandsons. Prosperity remained with the firm and its partners until 1901, in which year it became a private limited company and embarked on long-drawn-out litigation with the London and North Western Railway, for whom the firm had acted as cartage agents since 1847. Unsuccessful in the courts and badly affected by the loss of the agency, the partners quarrelled and Joseph's grandson Joseph William Baxendale left the firm in 1908. Thereafter undercapitalized, Pickfords was forced into amalgamation with its rival Carter Paterson in 1912, was bought up by Hay's Wharf Cartage Company in 1920 and finally lost all independence when, with Hay's Wharf Cartage and Carter Paterson, it was acquired by the four railway companies jointly (that is, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, the London and North-Eastern Railway, the Great Western Railway, and the Southern Railway) in 1934.<br>
