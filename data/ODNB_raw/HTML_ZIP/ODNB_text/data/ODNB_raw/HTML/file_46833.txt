<span class="headword">Cole,  Eric Kirkham</span>  (1901&#150;1966), <span class="occ">radio engineer</span>, was born at 14 Windsor Road, Prittlewell, Southend-on-Sea, Essex, on 4 July 1901, the only child of Henry Cole, a dairyman, and his wife, Alice Laura, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kirkham. He was educated at Southend Day Technical School and, after serving a three-year apprenticeship, went into partnership with his father as an electrical engineer. He set up his own business in 1922, making radio receivers to take advantage of the demand following the foundation of the BBC. His first premises were a single rented room in Westcliff-on-Sea, where, assisted by Muriel Bradshaw (1904/5&#150;1965), he made on average six sets a week. These were conventional sets for the period, using headphones for the output and powered from batteries.<br>
<br>However, Cole was soon engaged in the production of less conventional apparatus. This was the result of reading an article written by William Verrels, a war casualty and semi-invalid, in a local newspaper. Verrels wrote of his dependence on his radio set for entertainment and of the inconvenience and expense of getting batteries recharged. Cole contacted Verrels, and eventually went into partnership with him to design and manufacture a &#145;battery eliminator&#146;, which would enable sets to be operated from the mains supply. This was still only a small-scale local operation: Cole, Bradshaw, and Verrels made their initial sales by calling at every house in Westcliff and Southend which displayed an external radio aerial. Their energy and commitment was such that their company expanded during a minor slump in 1924, when many small radio firms went out of business. Cole married Muriel Bradshaw on 15 July 1925; they had two children, a son, Derek, and a daughter, Anne.<br>
<br>In October 1926 Cole reorganized his business as a private company, E. K. Cole Ltd (Ekco), with an authorized capital of &pound;2500. Verrels became chairman, Cole was vice-chairman, and three local businessmen joined them on the board. A new factory was built at Leigh-on-Sea in 1927, employing about fifty people. This business was converted into a public limited company on 25 April 1930.<br>
<br>By this time technical developments had made Cole's battery eliminators obsolete; the public now wanted all-mains radio receivers. Anticipating a substantial increase in business, Cole and Verrels decided that they needed additional technical expertise and more manufacturing capacity. They recruited John Wyborn (then twenty-six years old) from Marconiphone as their chief engineer and Michael Lipman as production engineer, they built a new factory at Southend-on-Sea&#151;the first large factory in Britain intended specifically for manufacturing radio receivers&#151;and they introduced Bakelite (an early plastic) in place of the wooden cabinets preferred by all other British manufacturers. This was something of a gamble in 1930: Bakelite moulding required considerable capital investment in machinery that could be used economically only for very large production runs. In the event, the gamble paid off. Ekco suffered a severe financial crisis after a factory fire in 1932; the firm survived by introducing a new range of receivers in attractive cabinets that could not have been made in more traditional materials. These new cabinets became a pattern for the rest of the industry and helped increase Ekco's turnover to more than a million pounds in 1934.<br>
<br>By the late 1930s Ekco had established an enviable reputation for the reliability of its products. This reputation must, obviously, be credited mainly to the quality control practices introduced by Wyborn and his staff. However, some acknowledgement is due to Cole's own standards and to the example which he set to his employees. During the Second World War Ekco was engaged in the production of portable radios, airborne radar sets, plastic practice bombs, and the T1154/R1155 radio sets for bombers. In 1943 Sir Stafford Cripps, then minister of aircraft production, described Ekco as &#145;one of the best, if not the best, units in the country producing wireless apparatus&#146;  (Geddes and Bussey, 263).<br>
<br>The post-war years brought a boom in demand for domestic television receivers, followed after a few years by a severe slump&#151;very like the changes in the market for radio receivers after the First World War. Cole now controlled a large company. Profiting from his experiences three decades earlier, he appeared for a time to strengthen his own position within the radio industry. Ekco took over the television interests of Dynatron in 1955 and Ferranti in 1957, and also invested in overseas manufacturers. Cole was appointed CBE in 1958. But in fact all was not well with Ekco; its senior management generally was described as being &#145;woefully weak&#146;  (Lipman, 173). The company faced serious financial problems, and its overseas ventures, on the whole, were failures. In 1960 Ekco merged with Pye to form British Electronic Industries Ltd. Cole himself was appointed vice-chairman of the new organization, but retired in 1961 following a boardroom disagreement.<br>
<br>Cole could spare little time for hobbies while working, but was able in retirement to develop his interests in shooting and photography. His wife died in 1965, and he did not survive her for long. He died in a bathing accident at Fitts Village, St James, Barbados, on 18 November 1966.<br>
