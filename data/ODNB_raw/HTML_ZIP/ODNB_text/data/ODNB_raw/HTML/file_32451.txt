<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clifford,  John</span>  (1836&#150;1923), <span class="occ">minister of the New Connexion of General Baptists</span>, was born at Sawley, Derbyshire, on 16 October 1836, the eldest of the seven children of Samuel Clifford, a warp-machine worker, and his wife, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mary Stenson. His father's family were Methodists and his mother's family were Baptists, three of his uncles being Baptist preachers. He went to Baptist schools in Sawley and Lenton, and Wesleyan and national schools in Beeston. At eleven he started work in a lace factory, with a sixteen-hour working day. By the age of thirteen he could read while working his machine, and first began to absorb Emerson's <span class="italic">Essays</span>, which was to be in his hands the week he died. He regarded Emerson as &#145;one of the most potent forces in shaping my life&#146;  (Marchant, 12), because he learned from him the value of ideas.<br>
<br>In November 1850 Clifford experienced conversion in the General Baptist chapel at Beeston, and after being accepted for membership on 29 April 1851 he was baptized on 16 June 1851 by Richard Pike. After two years as a lay preacher in Nottingham, he was recommended by his church to the Midland Baptist College in Leicester, where he began his course in September 1855. Like many other theological students he questioned the historical truth of Christianity, the teaching of Christ, and the place of miracles in the life of the world. Although some of his contemporaries found that they could be more open to biblical criticism as Unitarian ministers, Clifford adopted a broad-based evangelical theology, believing that God's self-revelation was progressive and that geology compelled a reappraisal of <span class="roman">Genesis</span>. He became senior student in his third year when the college moved to Nottingham, and accepted an invitation to Praed Street Baptist Church, Paddington, on condition that he could continue his studies at University College, London. He began his ministry on 17 October 1858 and remained there until he retired on 29 August 1915. He married Rebecca (<i>d</i>. 1919), daughter of Dr Thomas Carter of Newbury, on 14 January 1862, and they had four sons and two daughters. Clifford took his BA in 1861, BSc in 1862 (with honours in logic, moral philosophy, geology, and palaeontology), MA in 1864 (when he was first in the year), and LLB in 1866 (with honours in the principles of legislation). He was elected a fellow of the Geological Society in 1879. He received an honorary DD from Bates' College, Maine, in 1883 and from the University of Chicago in 1911, and an honorary LLD from McMaster University, Toronto, in 1911. His interest in geology reflected his sense of the urgency of reconciling the claims of religion and science, and his study of the principles of legislation indicated his concern for social reform, to be achieved through parliament.<br>
<br>When Clifford went to Praed Street the church had just over sixty members; by the turn of the century there were over a thousand. He believed that the church existed &#145;not only for our spiritual improvement, but also and specially for saving the souls and bodies of the people in the neighbourhood in which we are located&#146;  (Marchant, 40), and this characterized his ministry. A Mutual Economical Benefit Society was established in 1861 to provide sickness insurance, and then a Mutual Improvement Society. The growth of the church made it necessary to build a new chapel a mile away in Westbourne Park Place. Built in early Gothic style it cost &pound;15,000 and was opened on 30 September 1877. Charles Spurgeon preached at a special service the following Tuesday (as he had done when the previous chapel was enlarged in 1872). Clifford's work was especially effective among young men, who formed the backbone of the Westbourne Park Institute, which offered such extensive educational and recreational opportunities that it was called a &#145;people's university&#146;. Some twenty-three of &#145;Clifford's boys&#146; entered the Baptist ministry. The church also opened a home for young women moving to London in 1885, and Clifford's Inn, a public house without beer, in 1908. There were the usual Sunday schools and children's organizations (such as the Band of Hope, Girls' Life Brigade, and Christian Endeavour) as well as a Pleasant Sunday Afternoon Fellowship inaugurated in 1902.<br>
<br>Clifford was brought up in the New Connexion of General Baptists, a product of the eighteenth-century evangelical revival centred in the midlands. As a minister in London he became a national leader and was editor of the <span class="italic">General Baptist Magazine</span> (1870&#150;84). He was president of the General Baptist Association in 1872 and again in 1891, when the association formally joined with the Baptist Union of Great Britain and Ireland, a moment for which Clifford had worked hard for many years. He was president of the London Baptist Association in 1879, and of the Baptist Union in 1888 and 1899. When the first Baptist World Congress was held in London in 1905, attended by delegates from nearly thirty countries, it was resolved to form the Baptist World Alliance, and Clifford was unanimously elected president. In 1908 he chaired the first European Baptist Congress in Berlin, and in 1911 presided at the second Baptist World Congress in Philadelphia. He spoke at the second European Congress in Stockholm in 1913, and presided over the meeting in London in 1920 to organize assistance for European Baptists who had suffered from the war.<br>
<br>Clifford was open to new directions in theology, while preserving the centrality of the person of Christ. This is seen in books such as <span class="italic">The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible</span> (1892), <span class="italic">The Christian Certainties</span> (1894), and <span class="italic">The Ultimate Problems of Christianity</span> (1906). As vice-president of the Baptist Union in 1887&#150;8 he found himself involved in the down-grade controversy. Spurgeon (a lifelong friend) had accused members of the Baptist Union of abandoning doctrines which he held dear, and resigned from the union. Clifford was involved in the attempts at reconciliation, but was determined to avoid the pressure for a new credal statement as a basis for membership. Instead he drafted a declaratory statement which was approved by the Baptist Union Assembly in 1888. His presidential address on that occasion, &#145;The great forty years&#146;, set out his own view of primitive Christianity. Clifford's emphasis on the incarnation was characteristic of the period. His twin emphases on a personal relationship to Christ and freedom of conscience have led to criticisms that he had a &#145;diminished ecclesiology&#146;. He regarded ecclesiology as a branch of sociology, which is why he believed that Christians had to be committed to transforming the whole of society.<br>
<br>Clifford was therefore inevitably a public figure. His concern for social questions began in his childhood factory and memories of Chartism, but later found theological justification. His autumn address to the Baptist Union in 1888 was on the primitive Christian faith as a social gospel, balancing the doctrinal emphasis of his spring address. Hence he supported the London dock strike of 1889 and the Progressive Party on the London county council. Though a lifelong Liberal he was also a member of the Fabian Society: two of his addresses were published as Fabian pamphlets. Clifford is most widely remembered for his involvement in the education controversy. He successfully opposed the imposition of religious tests on board school teachers in London in 1893&#150;4. His campaign against rate assistance for denominational schools in the 1902 <span class="roman">Education Act</span> was unsuccessful, and he became leader of the passive resistance movement which refused to pay education rates because they infringed freedom of conscience.<br>
<br>Clifford's contribution to nonconformist life generally was recognized by his presidency of the National Council of the Evangelical Free Churches (1898&#150;9). Although a keen opponent of the South African War, his influence was important in securing Free Church support for the First World War in 1914. After retirement he was president of the Brotherhood Movement (1916&#150;18) and the World Brotherhood Federation (1919&#150;23). In the new year's honours list of 1921 Clifford was one of the first Free Churchmen to become a Companion of Honour. Though rather short Clifford was of striking appearance, with a full beard (originally red, later grey) and moustache compensating for his bald head, and always a twinkling smile. He died at a meeting of the Baptist Union council at Baptist Church House, Southampton Row, London, on 20 November 1923, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. His wife had died on 23 August 1919.<br>
