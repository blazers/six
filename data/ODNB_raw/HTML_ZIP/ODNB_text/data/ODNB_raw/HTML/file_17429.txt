<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Macdonald, Sir  Archibald</span>, first baronet  (1747&#150;1826), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was born on 13 July 1747 at Armidale Castle on the Isle of Skye, the third and posthumous son of Sir Alexander Macdonald, seventh baronet (1711&#150;1746), and his second wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1799), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19054/', "Alexander Montgomerie, ninth earl of Eglinton")</script>. He must have begun his education in Scotland because in later life he referred to Thomas Erskine as &#145;my old school-fellow&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 21.62) but in the aftermath of Culloden the government was anxious to limit Jacobite influence over the Macdonald boys and recommended that they be sent to England. Macdonald became a king's scholar at Westminster School in 1760 and was elected to a studentship at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1764, where he graduated BA in 1768 and MA in 1772. In this pattern of &eacute;lite education he may have followed the example of another scion of the Scottish aristocracy, William Murray, first earl of Mansfield; like Mansfield he was entered at Lincoln's Inn, in 1765, and called to the bar, on 24 November 1770.<br>
<br>Macdonald's connections provided early employment for him as junior counsel in some appeals to the House of Lords but the first important case that he argued in his own right was <i>Campbell v. Hall</i>, or the <span class="italic">Case of the Island of Grenada</span>, tried before Lord Chief Justice Mansfield in May 1775. The case was very important because it was designed to test the issue of the crown's right to impose a duty on the inhabitants of a colony by prerogative; it came on just as the American War of Independence was breaking out and the second continental congress was meeting at Philadelphia. Citing <i>Calvin's case</i> and several civil law authorities Macdonald contended that no such tax could be imposed by prerogative after the cessation of hostilities, for in a settled colony the power of legislation was confined to king and parliament, as demonstrated by the <span class="roman">Declaratory Act</span> of 1766. Mansfield commented that he had raised &#145;one of the greatest constitutional questions that, perhaps, ever came before this Court&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 20.306).<br>
<br>Although such praise must have assisted his progress the turning point of Macdonald's career came in 1777. In February of that year he was elected to the House of Commons for the borough of Hindon, in Wiltshire, probably by dint of large-scale bribery among its inhabitants; on 26 December he married Lady Louisa (<i>d</i>. 1827), daughter of Granville Leveson-Gower, second Earl Gower, lord president of the council and leader of the Bedford whigs. With such political advantages Macdonald could hardly fail to be promoted and it was no coincidence that he was granted a patent of precedence at the bar less than a month later, in January 1778. Later the same year he was one of several counsel retained on behalf of the governors and officers of Greenwich Hospital on their application to the court of king's bench for an information alleging libel against Captain Thomas Baillie, who had accused them of corrupt administration. On this occasion he failed to satisfy Mansfield, who discharged the rule for an information on the grounds that the writing in question had not been published, in the full sense of the word, and that Baillie had already been punished by the governors.<br>
<br>In parliament Macdonald dutifully followed the line of his father-in-law, even to the extent of public inconsistency and occasional apostasy. With Gower he supported the North administration's prosecution of the American war but he launched an artificially savage attack on North after Gower resigned in November 1779 and then abjectly apologized upon his father-in-law's signal of continued support for the North ministry. At the general election of 1780 he was returned for Gower's borough of Newcastle under Lyme and given a government place as second judge of the Carmarthen circuit in Wales. Becoming more confident in debate he assisted the administration's resistance to economical reform in 1781, despite having previously supported John Dunning's motion against the influence of the crown; and on the occasion of the younger William Pitt's motion for reforming parliamentary representation, debated on 7 May 1782, he declared &#145;that as the present form of the constitution had stood from Charles the 2nd's time, without any material alteration, he could see no reason for any amendment to it at present&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 22.1429). Like Gower he opposed the Fox&#150;North administration from the start. In the debate of March 1783 on the Foxite motion pressing the king to install the new coalition he said that &#145;It did not deserve the respectable name of coalition; it was a perversion of words to call it so&#146;  (ibid., 23.674). Fox thereupon reminded the house of the sequel to his previous assault on North, but Macdonald had signalled his loyalty to the king's friends by declaring that &#145;He thought the democracy more to be feared than the regal power&#146;  (ibid., 675), and in November he argued strenuously against Fox's <span class="roman">India Bill</span> as &#145;a trap &hellip; for the liberties of the nation&#146;  (ibid., 1298), thereby hitching his fortunes firmly to Pitt's rising star. He had his reward after Gower returned to government in Pitt's ministry, when he became solicitor-general at the dissolution of parliament in March 1784 and attorney-general four years later. He continued to represent Newcastle under Lyme until his elevation to the judicial bench, and as a principal law officer he spoke regularly on legal affairs. Most notably, in 1785 he introduced a bill promoting a new scheme for securing the peace in the City of London, Westminster, and Southwark, principally by establishing district police establishments under a metropolitan commission and increasing the frequency of the Old Bailey sessions. Though the bill was defeated by the vested interests of local authorities and traditional fears of centralized authority it anticipated later reforms and, in aiming &#145;to render detection certain, and punishment with a moderate degree of severity, unavoidable&#146;  (ibid., 25.889), Macdonald articulated advanced ideas. He also rendered valuable support to Pitt at the time of the regency crisis in 1788&#150;9, arguing strongly for the power of parliament to determine the powers of a regent against the Foxite claims for automatic reversion to the prince of Wales.<br>
<br>In his other capacity as a leader at the bar Macdonald proved to be competent rather than outstanding. Unusually for a law officer he maintained only a moderate private practice, principally in chancery and in the equity side of the exchequer. On being made attorney-general in June 1788 (when he was knighted) he became responsible for state prosecutions but his tenure predated the main crisis of government reaction to the French Revolution, and in the trials that he prosecuted he was distinguished mainly by his easy confidence and good humour. In December 1789 he prosecuted the bookseller John Stockdale for publishing a pamphlet critical of the impeachment proceedings against Warren Hastings. Although it was an <i>ex officio</i> information the prosecution was not inspired by the government; it had been promoted by an address to the king originally moved by Charles Fox, on the basis that the publication was a libel against the House of Commons, and Macdonald's speech was correspondingly restrained. He opened by saying that &#145;The solemnity of the situation in which I am placed on this occasion, obliges me to address the intellect both of the court and the jury, and neither their passions or their prejudices&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 22.249). In the event his speech was completely overshadowed by Erskine's oration for the liberty of the press, which secured an acquittal, and later in his career he complained that &#145;He had more than once prosecuted, in obedience to the commands of the House, when he knew a conviction could not be expected&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 30.132). A year later he led for the crown in <i>R. v. John Frith</i>, who was indicted for high treason after throwing a stone at the king's coach. On this occasion he had little to do, since the defendant was found unfit to plead on grounds of insanity, although Lord Chief Justice Kenyon praised his characteristic moderation and indulgence to the prisoner  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 22.310). But he was much less forbearing when prosecuting Thomas Paine for a criminal libel in December 1792. The case against Paine had the full support of the government, who were alarmed by the wide circulation of the second part of his <span class="italic">Rights of Man</span>, and Macdonald clearly identified his personal convictions with the prosecution. In loyal and patriotic tones he spoke up forcefully against Paine's &#145;gross, contemptible, and abominable falsehood&#146; on the constitution  (ibid., 385&#150;6) and became righteously indignant over the author's sarcasm at the capacity of the king and his sons for government. The jury's hostile reaction to Erskine's exculpation of Paine for the defence showed that he had caught the public mood, and they gave a verdict for the prosecution without withdrawing from court.<br>
<br>Macdonald was appointed lord chief baron of exchequer on 12 February 1793, following Sir James Eyre's promotion to the court of common pleas. Cases in the exchequer were generally of limited significance and the promotion therefore constituted retirement from the front line of public affairs. But he was commissioned to take part in some important state trials, including the prosecution of Thomas Hardy for treason in late 1794, although Eyre presided and Macdonald said little. Macdonald presided himself at the trial of Colonel Joseph Wall for murder at the Old Bailey in January 1802. The case was one of considerable public interest because the alleged offence had taken place in 1782, when Wall was governor of the garrison of Goree off the coast of Africa, and it concerned the death of a sergeant after a punishment of 800 lashes, administered with a rope's end. In his defence Wall claimed that he had been confronted with a mutiny and had convened a summary court martial but the evidence was quite contradictory, and after reviewing it all very impartially Macdonald left the issue to the jury, who brought in a guilty verdict. He retired from the bench with a baronetcy in 1813, when his eyesight failed, but he maintained his interest in the reform of criminal law, appearing personally before a House of Commons select committee in 1819. On that occasion he argued again for the principle of certainty rather than severity in punishment, and advocated the restriction of capital punishment in favour of imprisonment with hard labour.<br>
<br>Although he was a conservative in politics and one of a generation who were alarmed by the implications of the French Revolution, Macdonald never became a reactionary, unlike his contemporaries John Scott, first earl of Eldon, and Edward Law. Indeed an unwillingness to participate in repressive measures may account for his sidelining in 1793, just when the Pitt government began to move decisively against popular radicalism. Near the end of his career he said that when he drew penal statutes as solicitor- and attorney-general &#145;I was always an exceedingly strong advocate for the milder course&#146;  (&#145;Select committee on criminal laws&#146;, 48); and as a judge in criminal trials that &#145;I would always desire to give the prisoner the benefit of every thing that I could discover in his favour &hellip; I always felt it my duty to be counsel for <i>him</i>&#146;  (ibid., 50). Macdonald died at his home in Duke Street, Westminster, on 18 May 1826, and was buried in Kensington parish church. He was survived by his wife, who died eight months later, and by three children, James (1784&#150;1832), who succeeded to the baronetcy, Louisa (1781&#150;1862), and Caroline Diana (1790&#150;1867).<br>
