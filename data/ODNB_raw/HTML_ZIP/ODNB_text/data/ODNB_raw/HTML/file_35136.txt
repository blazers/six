<span class="headword">Mowat, Sir  Oliver</span>  (1820&#150;1903), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician in Canada</span>, was born on 22 July 1820 in Kingston, Upper Canada, the eldest of the five children of John Mowat (1791&#150;1860) and Helen Levack (1791&#150;1873), immigrants from Caithness. John Mowat had left the British army after the Anglo-American War of 1812&#150;14 and become a well-to-do merchant in the thriving town of Kingston.<br>
<br>Oliver Mowat was brought up among Scots. He attended St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, where his father was an elder, and the Revd John Cruikshank's private school, followed by Midland district grammar school under headmaster George Baxter. He read law in the Kingston office of John A. Macdonald (1836&#150;40) and with the Toronto equity specialist Robert Easton Burns (1841). When called to the bar in November 1841 he went into partnership with Burns, tying his future to the court of chancery and the rising city of Toronto.<br>
<br>On 19 May 1846 Oliver married Jane Ewart (1824&#150;1893), the attractive daughter of Scots-born John Ewart, a well-known Toronto contractor. They had three sons and four daughters; two of the children died in infancy.<br>
<br>Increasing business in the mid-century presented many cases for equitable settlement, and Mowat, through his dedication and sound legal knowledge, was soon retained in the most important. In 1853 he was employing five clerks and had net earnings of C$14,000. Several of the decisions that he won were upheld by the highest court, the judicial committee of the British privy council. His professional standing was recognized by election in 1853 as a bencher of the Law Society of Upper Canada and appointments in 1856 as queen's counsel and commissioner to consolidate the provincial statutes.<br>
<br>The established lawyer felt the challenge of politics. Elected alderman for 1857 and 1858, Mowat left his imprint on Toronto by his promotion of public parks and reforms in city management. At the same time, though hitherto without party affiliation, he came to the conclusion that it was his &#145;duty&#146; to oppose the governing Conservatives, who had &#145;no principle nor patriotism&#146;  (Biggar, 77, 79). In the provincial election of December 1857 he ran as a Reformer in the riding of Ontario South, promising to perform his duties as became &#145;a Christian politician&#146;  (ibid., 70).<br>
<br>In the legislature Mowat rose rapidly to a prominent place beside the Reform chief George Brown. Short, near-sighted, and plain-featured, he was not an impressive figure. Nor was he an orator, but he was a convincing speaker because he was lucid, sensible, and tactful. And he was loyal: Brown considered him one of the &#145;reliables&#146;  (letter to Gordon Brown, 11 May 1863, Brown MSS, Public Archives of Canada). He served as provincial secretary in the two-day Brown&#150;A. A. Dorion ministry of 1858, and as postmaster-general in the nine-month Sandfield Macdonald&#150;Dorion administration of 1863. In this post he negotiated improved contracts with the Grand Trunk Railway Company and the Montreal Ocean Steamship Company for carrying mail.<br>
<br>As mounting sectional discord strained the union between Upper and Lower Canada which had been established in 1841, some Reformers proposed dissolution. Mowat, however, supported Brown at the convention of 1859 in endorsing a federal relationship with local governments for local matters and a general government for common concerns. In May 1864, when Brown's motion for a select committee to devise a solution for the deadlock between the Canadas was carried, Mowat was one of the twenty appointees. On 30 June, again as postmaster-general, he was included with Brown in the &#145;great coalition&#146; to reconstruct the union. At the Quebec conference in October, according to D'Arcy McGee, a fellow delegate, Mowat took a &#145;constant and honourable share&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parliamentary Debates</span>, 137) in drafting the federal plan that would be embodied in the <span class="roman">British North America Act</span> of 1867. On 14 November 1864 his contributions as a father of confederation ended when he accepted the vice-chancellorship of Upper Canada.<br>
<br>In chancery, Mowat rendered about 500 judgments, many of which became Canadian precedents. The work was congenial, and allowed him time for family and the general reading that he enjoyed. But his income was less than as a lawyer, and he was disappointed at being passed over for the chancellorship in 1870. He may have retained some political ambition as well. At any rate, on 24 October 1872 he resigned from the bench and accepted the invitation to head the Liberal government in his native province, which had been renamed Ontario in 1867 and was still adjusting to life in the new dominion of Canada. This unprecedented return of a judge to the political arena was denounced by both the opposition and the legal profession as a &#145;rude shock&#146; to the independence of the judiciary. Still, the consensus was that, while vice-chancellor, Mowat had shown no &#145;tendency to fear, favor, or affection&#146;  (<span class="italic">Canada Law Journal</span>, 8, 1872, 264&#150;5; 33, 1897, 748&#150;9).<br>
<br>Mowat, who thus became Ontario premier by appointment, took also the portfolio of attorney-general, and was elected to the legislature in Oxford North. Inexperienced in leading a government and a party, he proved a master of the art. He chose as colleagues men who were of proven ability and integrity like himself, and maintained unity in cabinet and caucus with a firm hand. His government redrew constituency boundaries carefully, but with little evidence of gerrymandering. It utilized patronage, but without scandal, for Mowat personally controlled its volume and required honesty and efficiency in the recipients.<br>
<br>Mowat's Liberals defeated the Conservatives and several third parties in six successive elections, though mostly with small margins in the popular vote, and he remained premier for almost twenty-four years. Contributing to his success, according to one of his ministers, was his &#145;sagacity&#146;  (Ross, 192) in assessing public opinion on divisive questions such as temperance or franchise reform. When Ontarians were ready, his government gradually stiffened restraints on the liquor trade, and widened the electorate until manhood suffrage was reached in 1888. A secret ballot modelled on the English was introduced in 1874. On the other hand, although Mowat sympathized in the 1890s with the suffragettes and, an abstainer himself, with the prohibitionists, he side-stepped both because, in his familiar phrase, &#145;the time was not ripe&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Globe</span> [Toronto], 11 May 1893).<br>
<br>Issues of religion and race, the most contentious of all, were central in the elections of 1886, 1890, and 1894. Mowat, steadfast in the faith of his fathers, had nevertheless a catholicity of spirit, strengthened by lifelong study of the history of Christianity, which gave him a deep respect for all creeds. He aimed at justice to Ontario's Roman Catholic and French-speaking minorities as well as to the protestant, Anglophone majority. Thus, while denying Orangemen a special act of incorporation, which was offensive to Catholicism, he conceded their right to incorporate under a general act; and, while taking steps to improve Roman Catholic separate schools and Francophone schools, he refused extension of the separate system, which would have alienated protestants. By his moderation and conciliation he built a party that accommodated disparate elements in the population.<br>
<br>For many years, however, historians remembered not the canny practical politician who presided over the golden age of Ontario Liberalism, but the stubborn defender of provincial rights against the dominion. They claimed that his legal battles with prime minister John A. Macdonald contradicted his own earlier work for confederation and weakened the nation.<br>
<br>Actually, Mowat's federalism was rooted in the Upper Canadian ideology of self-government. Under the <span class="roman">British North America Act</span>, he believed, provincial sovereignty was retained, lieutenant-governors possessed the traditional royal prerogatives of escheat, pardon, and appointment of queen's counsel, and provincial legislatures had co-ordinate powers with the federal. In his view it was Macdonald's theory of dominion paramountcy and subordinate provinces that was a false construction. Their jurisdictional clashes were intensified by personal antagonism dating from the 1850s when Mowat joined the Reformers. Political advantage was also at stake. For example, although Macdonald dubbed Mowat a &#145;little tyrant&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Mail</span> [Toronto], 2 June 1882) for his persistence in their quarrel over the authority to grant liquor licences, the fact was that neither leader wanted to yield control of such a rich source of patronage. Similarly, Mowat resisted dominion disallowance of his <span class="roman">Rivers and Streams Act</span> in 1881, 1882, and 1883 because he perceived a threat both to provincial autonomy and to the public interest in Ontario's waterways, which were essential for the lumbering operations that produced considerable revenue for his government.<br>
<br>Mowat's vision for Canada was different from Macdonald's, but he was no less patriotic, as he demonstrated in his 1890s crusade against the advocates of commercial and political union with the United States. His interpretation of the constitution was confirmed by privy council decisions recognizing the provinces within their spheres as &#145;supreme&#146;  (<i>Hodge</i>, 1883) and the lieutenant-governors as representatives of the crown in the provinces  (<i>Maritime Bank</i>, 1892).<br>
<br>Mowat's prolonged boundary struggle with the dominion and province of Manitoba was territorial, not constitutional. Meticulously he gathered evidence to document before the privy council in 1884 and 1888 Ontario's claim from Lake Superior westwards to Lake of the Woods and northwards to the Albany River and James Bay. His victory was complete. Ontario acquired a vast domain with invaluable timber and mineral resources.<br>
<br>Research since the 1960s has turned attention to Mowat's policies for the province's internal development. These were the major part of the &#145;record&#146; that won repeated favour at the polls. His government stimulated every economic sector, helping Ontario to prosper despite the world depression. Agriculture, still the main occupation, received leadership from a new department of agriculture and a new agricultural college and experimental farm. Business and trade benefited from the political stability, provincial grants to railways criss-crossing the southern peninsula in the 1870s, and numerous public works, including dignified parliament buildings completed in 1893. Opening of the north, to complement the agricultural and industrial south, was aided by immigration propaganda, free land, and colonization railways and roads. Encouragement was given to the infant mining industry while ensuring that it furnish public revenue by a charge on ores. While it was uninterested in reforestation, the government did act to protect the forests from fire, check the extinction of fish and game, and begin three provincial parks for conservation and recreation.<br>
<br>Challenged by the human problems emergent with late nineteenth-century industrialization and urbanization, Mowat departed from the <i>laissez-faire</i> of the earlier Reformers and assumed many new responsibilities for the welfare of society, albeit with a wary eye to their cost and political acceptability. His government intervened in employer&#150;employee relations by providing for arbitration of industrial disputes, workmen's compensation, regulation of working conditions in factories, shops, and mines, and protection, by liens, of mechanics' earnings. Education was brought under a minister, and modernized in so many respects that at the 1893 Chicago Exposition the province was honoured by a special award for &#145;a system of Public Instruction almost ideal in the perfection of its details&#146;  (Ontario Legislative Assembly, <span class="italic">Sessional Papers</span> 1897, No. 1, Appendix Q). Various measures furnished protection for public health, neglected children, and women's property rights. As <i>ex officio</i> bencher, Mowat insisted that the Law Society permit women to study and practise law. As attorney-general, he made the judicial system more efficient by instalments of legislation which culminated in 1881 in fusing, as in England, the old rival common law and equity courts.<br>
<br>Mowat's balanced developmental programmes, hesitant though some appear today, set Ontario on the path towards the economic empire and broad social services of the twentieth century. They reveal the essence of his Liberalism: his consideration for all classes, his adherence to British patterns, his trademark blend of caution and progress. B. B. Osler, one of his supporters, commented: &#145;He kept the brakes on, but the motive power was always there&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Globe</span> [Toronto], 27 April 1892).<br>
<br>Mowat was created KCMG in 1892 and GCMG in 1897. In 1893 Wilfrid Laurier, the Canadian Liberal leader, nominated him, &#145;as a veteran in the cause of Reform&#146;  (<span class="italic">Official Report of the Liberal Convention</span>, 1893, 5), to chair the national party convention, and on the eve of the 1896 federal election persuaded him to enter dominion politics. The election won, Mowat resigned the premiership on 13 July, and was appointed a senator and Laurier's minister of justice. His main task was to assist in settling the Manitoba schools controversy.<br>
<br>In Ottawa Mowat found his &#145;ten-hour days&#146; exhausting  (letter to Edward Blake, 1 July 1897, Blake MSS, Archives of Ontario). He returned to Toronto as Ontario's lieutenant-governor on 18 November 1897. But the social and ceremonial functions of this office grew difficult as his strength and eyesight failed. A fall and severe fracture hastened his death, at Government House, on 19 April 1903. He was buried on 22 April in Mount Pleasant cemetery. In his long and diverse public life he had played vital roles in defining the nature of the Canadian federation and transforming Ontario from a small frontier colony to a large, mature province.<br>
