<span class="headword">Fenwick <span class="st"> [Fenwicke]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or after 1593, <em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1670), <span class="occ">merchant and parliamentarian army officer</span>, was a younger son of Roger Fenwick (<i>c</i>.1566&#150;1618), gentleman, of Bitchfield, in the parish of Stamfordham, Northumberland, and his wife, Mabel. His approximate date of birth is derived from that of his elder brother, who was born in 1592 or 1593. John Fenwick was apprenticed on 31 May 1612 to Robert Bewick of Newcastle upon Tyne, boothman. He became a merchant of Newcastle, and by 1628 had married Jane, daughter of John Hall of Newcastle. By 1633 his interests in the textile trade were worth &pound;4000, placing him among Newcastle's wealthiest merchants.<br>
<br>After returning from residence on the continent Fenwick travelled to Scotland three times between October 1638 and January 1639, and subscribed to the national covenant. Secretary Windebank ordered his arrest for this &#145;most notorious and base treachery&#146;  (Welford, 368), but Fenwick escaped to Scotland and his wife and servant were questioned in his absence. He returned accompanying the covenanter army at Newburn on 28 August 1640, and attended Alexander Henderson's sermons with General Leslie at St Nicholas's Church, Newcastle, during the Scots' occupation of Newcastle.<br>
<br>In 1641 Fenwick denounced Thomas Morton, bishop of Durham, in his tract <span class="italic">The Downfall of the Pretended Divine Authoritie of the Hierarchy into the Sea of Rome</span>. He drew connections between the strength of Roman Catholicism in the Newcastle area and the Arminianism of the Durham Cathedral clergy, whom he decried as &#145;more fit for a stage than a pulpit, and other popish Arminian Mountebancks that vend Italian wares&#146;  (Howell, <span class="italic">Newcastle-upon-Tyne</span>, 141). After the Scots' departure in 1641 Fenwick's wife, &#145;another Priscilla, the ornament of her sex&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ambrose Barnes</span>, 133), interrupted the sermon of Newcastle's returning vicar, provoking a riot in which the mayor had to intervene to save her life.<br>
<br>On 8 September 1643 Fenwick was disenfranchised from Newcastle's corporation and his remaining estate was confiscated by royalists. That year he became the publicist for Newcastle's puritan minority, admonishing the townspeople for their sins in his next tract, <span class="italic">Christ Ruling in the Midst of his Enemies</span>. On Sir William Armyne's recommendation he was appointed master of Sherburn Hospital in co. Durham on 30 September 1644. He became a lieutenant-colonel in parliament's army, and on 18 August 1647 parliament ordered that &pound;500 be paid to him towards his arrears during his service in Ireland. On 6 May 1650 the council of state recommended his petition that his son John should succeed him as master of Sherburn for life.<br>
<br>Fenwick enrolled his sons John and Joshua as merchant adventurers of Newcastle in 1655 and 1658, but after the Restoration his son was ejected from Sherburn's mastership. A John Fenwick was listed as a non&#150;communicant and presented at All Saints', Newcastle, in 1662. He appears to have died about 1670.<br>
