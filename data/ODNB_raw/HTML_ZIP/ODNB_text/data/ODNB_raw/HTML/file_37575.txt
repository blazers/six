<span class="headword">Howard,  David</span>  (1839&#150;1916), <span class="occ">chemical manufacturer</span>, was born in Tottenham, Middlesex, the third of four sons (there were no daughters) of Robert Howard, chemical manufacturer, of Stratford, London. He studied at the Royal College of Chemistry, London, under A. W. von Hofmann, and in 1860 joined as a partner the well-established chemical manufacturing business founded by his grandfather, Luke Howard, in 1807. This firm began by manufacturing fine chemicals, especially the anti-malarial drug quinine and its derivatives, for the pharmaceutical industry. David Howard's uncle, J. E. Howard, did much original research on the chemistry of cinchona alkaloids, and he himself pursued the same line of enquiry. He became an acknowledged authority in this field, publishing a number of papers in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Chemical Society</span> from 1871. On 4 May 1865 he married Anna Dora (<i>b</i>. 1843/4), daughter of John Jowitt of Leeds. They had two sons, both of whom became directors of Howards &amp; Sons, the family firm.<br>
<br>During the nineteenth century quinine was the firm's most profitable product, though it also manufactured many other fine chemicals, including cocaine, ether, borax, and citric acid. In 1888, the year in which the Kodak camera was launched, the Howards acquired Hopkin and Williams, of Wandsworth, who made photographic chemicals. Around the turn of the century, manufacture began to be concentrated at a new site in Ilford. In 1903 David Howard succeeded his father as chairman and there followed a period of rapid growth. In 1905 the firm acquired an interest in Bowmans of Warrington, making chemicals for the brewing industry, and in 1914 Thorium Ltd was established to make thorium nitrate for gas mantles. Two years later aspirin manufacture was commenced.<br>
<br>Howard's lifelong interest in chemistry and the chemical industry was not limited to manufacture. He served on the council of the Chemical Society and was president of the Society of Chemical Industry (1886&#150;7) and of the Institute of Chemistry (1903&#150;6). He was much concerned with strict honesty in business transactions and was closely involved in the agitation that led to the passing of the Prevention of Corruption Act in 1900: he was subsequently chairman of the Bribery and Secret Commissions Prevention League, set up to give effect to the provisions of the act. He also served as deputy lieutenant for the county of Essex.<br>
<br>Howard maintained an active interest in his company to the end of his long life. He died suddenly on 14 November 1916 at Snaresbrook railway station while travelling from his home at Devon House, Buckhurst Hill, Essex, to the Ilford factory.<br>
