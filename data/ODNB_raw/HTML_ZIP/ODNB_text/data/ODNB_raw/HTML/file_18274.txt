<span class="headword">Mason,  Henry</span>  (1575/6&#150;1647), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Wigan, Lancashire, a younger son of John Mason, a minor tradesman. He entered Brasenose College, Oxford, as a servitor in 1592, was elected an exhibitioner in 1593 and matriculated on 23 November aged seventeen. He graduated BA on 22 January 1596 and proceeded MA from Corpus Christi College, where he became chaplain in 1602, on 11 May 1603. Showing early signs of his later anti-puritan commitment, in 1603 he was a party to the attempt at Corpus Christi to learn the contents of the university's response to the millenary petition in advance of its publication.<br>
<br>Mason proceeded BD in June 1610, and on 15 January 1611 was collated to the vicarage of Hillingdon, Middlesex, which he resigned in December 1612 when he became rector of St Matthew's, Friday Street, London. He was appointed chaplain to John King, bishop of London, and subsequently, on 14 February 1613, collated to St Andrew Undershaft with St Mary Axe, London. In October 1616 he was installed prebendary of Willesden in St Paul's Cathedral.<br>
<br>Mason became an important figure within English Arminianism. In a series of seven devotional tracts published between 1624 and 1634 he distanced himself from both Roman Catholic and Calvinist doctrines. Already a controversial cleric by 1625 when, in <span class="italic">Christian Humiliation, or, A Treatise of Fasting</span>, he criticized the position of the reformed church on Lenten fasting, in 1633 he co-authored with Samuel Hoard the unlicensed Arminian tract, <span class="italic">God's Love to Mankind</span>; in 1635 he attacked the clergy who &#145;do nible at the orders of our Church, and the Government of the present State&#146; and the<blockquote>ambitious professors, who talk still in a popular language, and speak for the good of their country, and finde fault with the errors in our government, and like zealous <i>Patriots</i> indeed, take part with the Commoners, against their Aldermen, and with the subjects against their Soveraigne; and all that they may steale the hearts of the multitude. (<span class="italic">Hearing and Doing the Ready Way to Blessedness</span>, pp. 31, 429)</blockquote>Instead, Mason identified himself with the doctrinal positions of bishops John King and William Juxon, and said of the Church of England, &#145;I am also perswaded in my soule, that she is the purest, best reformed Church in Europe&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christian Humiliation</span>, sig. A4).<br>
<br>Mason resigned his prebend on 29 March 1637, and Anthony Wood reports that when the &#145;puritan or presbyterian began to be dominant&#146; in London in 1641, Mason also resigned his rectory and retired to Wigan  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath., Oxon.</span>, 3.220&#150;21). In receipt of an annuity of &pound;20 from the Lancashire gentry family of Ince, Mason disappeared into humble, but not uncontroversial, obscurity. Wigan was a hotly contested county town during the civil war and Mason suffered at the hands of parliamentarians; in his will of June 1647 he requested that the mayor and recorder, &#145;help me &amp; the poor against their oppressors who are well known so that I need not to name them&#146;  (Lancs. RO, WCW). Several of Mason's close associates, including his cousin the pewterer Geoffrey Scott to whom Mason bequeathed his personal <span class="roman">Bible</span>, supported the royalists at Wigan. Mason died at Scoles, Wigan, and was buried in the churchyard of All Saints, Wigan, on 7 August 1647. He had in his lifetime (in 1632 and 1639) bestowed &pound;240 in trust for the relief of the poor of the town, and gave most of his library to the grammar school. Mason's publications were frequently reprinted during his lifetime, and in some instances up to 1656. They influenced an individual as markedly different as Sir Simonds D'Ewes, who in 1627 adopted Mason's rules on fasting as his lifelong guide.<br>
