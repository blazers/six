<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blackwood, Sir  (Stevenson) Arthur</span>  (1832&#150;1893), <span class="occ">secretary of the Post Office</span>, was born at Rosslyn Lodge, The Grove, Hampstead, on 22 May 1832, the only son of Arthur Johnstone Blackwood (1808&#150;1874), groom of the privy chamber, and Cecilia Georgiana (<i>d</i>. 1881), daughter of the Hon. John Byng, and widow of John Wright of Lenton Hall, Nottinghamshire. Stevenson was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2548/', "Vice-Admiral the Hon. Sir Henry Blackwood")</script> and had one sister. The family was of Scottish origin, related to Adam Blackwood, from an Irish branch. Stevenson grew up to be very tall and good-looking, though prone to illness. He became a pupil (1843&#150;4) of the Revd Jeremiah Carver, vicar of Great Sampford, Essex. At Eton College in 1845&#150;8 Blackwood maintained his classics. To learn German he lived at Proseken, Mecklenburg (1848&#150;50). He then matriculated from Trinity College, Cambridge. A keen sportsman, Blackwood possessed &#145;bright intelligence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Record</span>, 1012), but took no degree, for in 1852 Lord John Russell appointed him to a clerkship at the Treasury. On volunteering in 1854 for the Crimean campaign, Blackwood became deputy assistant commissary-general. He did well, gaining the applause of his men, a Crimean medal with clasps, and a Turkish decoration. His godmother, Charlotte Wright, by sending him a biography of Colonel Holcombe, stimulated a gradual conversion experience. Recalled in December 1855, he was promoted second-class clerk in the Treasury chest division. In 1856 he suffered from a bout of rheumatic fever.<br>
<br>While being encouraged by Catherine Marsh, daughter of Dr William Marsh, to commit himself further to personal faith in Christianity, Blackwood still moved in London society, where he was known as Beauty Blackwood. His conversion was made complete under William Pennefather. He renounced worldly pleasures and began to learn Hebrew. On 16 December 1858, at St George's, Hanover Square, Blackwood married Harriet Sydney Montagu (1834&#150;1907), the daughter of Conway Richard Dobbs of Castle Dobbs, co. Antrim, and the widow of a prominent evangelical peer, George, sixth duke of Manchester. They had three daughters and two sons, of whom the younger, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31913/', "Algernon Blackwood")</script>, became a notable author; his <span class="italic">Episodes before Thirty</span> (1923) includes reflections on a secluded evangelical upbringing, albeit by loving parents. In successive homes near London, Blackwood held Christian gatherings. At intervals during 1862&#150;92 he published his <span class="roman">Bible</span> addresses. Habitually putting his official duties first, he was prone to overworking. In 1870 and 1872 he served on Treasury commissions overseas. In 1873 he succeeded Pennefather as chairman of the annual Mildmay Conference. Although he accepted moderate Holiness teaching, he continued a strong advocate of Reformation principles.<br>
<br>To enable the Treasury to monitor postal affairs, Blackwood was appointed financial secretary of the Post Office in 1874, becoming CB. At St Martin's-le-Grand, the Post Office headquarters, he soon came to understand its internal tensions. In April 1880 Blackwood was promoted secretary of the Post Office. His administrative gifts and Christian character&#151;not wholly austere, for he retained through life a boyish quality&#151;made him &#145;one of the ablest, most successful, and consistent servants of the state&#146;  (H. S. Blackwood, 399&#150;400). Scholarly opinion, while perceiving an autocratic tendency, continues to regard him in a favourable light. Under Blackwood postal orders were introduced in 1880, inland parcel post in 1883, and sixpenny telegrams in 1885. At a universal postal congress in Lisbon (1885) Blackwood was prominent: his command of French increased his country's influence, and he received a Portuguese decoration. A new postmaster-general, H. C. Raikes, chose to assert his authority at home, but Blackwood was made KCB in 1887. Thereafter he dropped his first name, becoming known as Sir Arthur Blackwood. In 1890 his decisive action at the beginning of a postal strike prevented disruption from spreading; Raikes approved. In 1891 ill health delayed his departure for a postal congress in Vienna. On arrival, his influence still proved strong. In 1892 influenza left Blackwood considerably weakened. Returning to work in May 1893, he persisted until August with departmental reorganization. Clearly in worse health, he left for better air in the Engadine. Growing weaker, he travelled homewards with difficulty, reaching Harwich almost unconscious. Taken ashore to the Great Eastern Hotel, Parkeston, he died on 2 October from pernicious anaemia. He was buried with his parents in Kensal Green cemetery, London.<br>
