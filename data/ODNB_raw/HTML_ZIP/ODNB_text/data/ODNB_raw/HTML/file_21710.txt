<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pearson,  Charles Henry</span>  (1830&#150;1894), <span class="occ">politician in Australia and writer</span>, was born on 7 September 1830 in the principal's house, Church Missionary Institution, Islington, London, the fourth son and the tenth child of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21721/', "Revd John Norman Pearson (1787&#150;1865)")</script> and his wife, Harriet, daughter of Richard Puller, a merchant banker. One of his brothers was the judge <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21719/', "Sir John Pearson")</script>. Until the age of twelve he was tutored at home by his exacting, ambitious, and puritanical father, then attended Rugby School from 1843 to May 1846. He was removed from the school after clashing with his form master G. E. L. Cotton, and was privately tutored for four months before in 1847 entering King's College, London. There he became a disciple of Frederick Denison Maurice and highly valued the teaching of Professor John Sherren Brewer. While acting as a special constable on 10 April 1848 at a Chartist demonstration, he contracted a chill, which had a bad and lasting effect on his health. He matriculated as a commoner from Oriel College, Oxford, in 1849, obtained a scholarship at Exeter College the following year, and was in the first class in the <i>literae humaniores</i> examination in 1852. He graduated BA in 1853 and proceeded MA in 1856. From boyhood he knew French, and while an undergraduate he studied German, Czech, Italian, and Swedish; he was a founder member of the Essay Society, a small society for intellectual discussion, and was president of the Oxford Union Debating Society in 1852&#150;3. Intending to practise medicine, he read anatomy and physiology at Oxford for about two years after taking his degree, while also acting as a private tutor. In 1854 he was elected a fellow of Oriel, and soon after, being attacked by pleurisy, gave up his intention of becoming a physician, on the advice of his doctors. In the following year he was appointed lecturer in English literature, and shortly afterwards professor of modern history, at King's College, London. In 1861 he published <span class="italic">The Early and Middle Ages of England</span> and during the following two years edited the short-lived <span class="italic">National Review</span>; he also contributed to the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>. Believing that his broad-church religious opinions were not in harmony with those of the authorities at King's College, he proposed to the principal, the high-church Dr Richard William Jelf, that he resign his professorship, but was persuaded by Jelf to retain office, and did so until 1865.<br>
<br>For several years Pearson spent his vacations in Europe, studying foreign languages. In 1859, on the eve of the emancipation of Russia's serfs, he summarized the impressions of a long journey in <span class="italic">Russia: by a recent traveller: a series of letters, originally published in &#145;the Continental Review&#146;</span> (reissued with a new introduction in 1970). In 1863 he risked his life to obtain first-hand knowledge of the Polish insurrection against Russian occupation. His account of &#145;The insurrection in Poland&#146;, which was sympathetic to the Poles, was published as a supplement to <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> on 12 September 1863, as a pamphlet under the pseudonym &#145;A Recent Traveller&#146;, and issued in Paris by the Polish diplomatic agency as <span class="italic">Un Anglais en Pologne</span>.<br>
<br>In 1864, after Britain had failed to act on Poland's behalf and Oxford had passed him over for the Chichele professorship of history, Pearson set off for South Australia, where he tried farming at Melrose, some 200 miles north of Adelaide. Although he thrived in the warm, dry climate and learned to respect the &#145;primitive democracy&#146; of the local community, he was driven to England in 1866 by severe drought. In 1867 he defended the political stability of Australian democracy in <span class="italic">Essays on Reform</span>. The following year he brought out a revised two-volume edition of his history of England &#145;during the early and middle ages&#146; and lectured on history for the new North of England Council for Promoting the Higher Education of Women. In 1869 the first edition of his pioneering <span class="italic">Historical Maps of England, during the First Thirteen Centuries</span> was published, and he contributed a historical essay to Josephine Butler's <span class="italic">Woman's Work and Woman's Culture</span> (1869).<br>
<br>In 1869, after visiting the United States and Sweden, Pearson began lecturing on modern history at Trinity College, Cambridge, but two years later, finding his eyesight suffering, and disappointed in the quality of his students, he returned to his South Australian farm via the United States and the Pacific, writing articles <i>en route</i> for the London <span class="italic">Spectator</span>. His health was again strengthened by his new mode of life. On 10 December 1872 he married, at Gawler, South Australia, Edith Lucille, daughter of Philip Butler of Tickford Abbey, Buckinghamshire, and Yattalunga, One Tree Hill, South Australia. Pearson was then forty-two, his bride twenty. At first the couple lived happily on his farm, where he worked at <span class="italic">English History in the Fourteenth Century</span> (1876). But his wife could not bear the very hot summers, and in 1874 they moved to Melbourne, where Pearson lectured on history at the university and founded a debating society whose members included Alfred Deakin, John Quick, and Henry Bournes Higgins. He resigned this post in 1875, and was appointed foundation headmaster of the Presbyterian Ladies' College, the first girls' school in Australia to match the leading boys' grammar schools in offering permanence, imposing buildings, and a large student body and boarding house. To inaugurate the college he gave a lecture on &#145;The higher culture of women&#146;, afterwards published as a pamphlet. He had not, however, given up his interest in politics. Fearing that most of the land of Victoria was falling into the possession of a few very wealthy proprietors, and aware that a newly formed Liberal Party was about to contest a forthcoming election, he proposed the progressive taxation of large estates at a &#145;monster meeting&#146; held in Melbourne on 19 February 1877. He was thereupon asked to resign the headmastership, since his views on the land question were anathema to many of the college's supporters, who now saw him as a &#145;class traitor&#146;. With a daughter aged two and a second child soon to be born, he now became, as Deakin wrote, &#145;a leading figure in one of the fiercest campaigns of party warfare waged within the Empire in this century&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span>, 28 May 1900).<br>
<br>Ironically, although the Liberals won a landslide victory on 11 May 1877, Pearson was allotted a virtually unwinnable seat by party managers, who were unhappy with his free-trade views. As compensation he was given a royal commission to report on public education in Victoria; his report of March 1878 covered all levels of education and provided a blueprint for many future developments. He was in the same year elected member of the legislative assembly for Castlemaine, a safe Liberal seat. In 1879 he accompanied Graham Berry on his unsuccessful mission to England to request the intervention of the home government to prevent future deadlocks between the houses of the legislature. He was re-elected for Castlemaine in 1880, and was minister without portfolio or salary in the Berry administration (1880&#150;81), concerning himself with constitutional reform, with carrying an act &#145;to amend the law relating to the University of Melbourne&#146;, which, among other things, guaranteed equal rights for women, and with boarding out the 200 children housed in unhygienic state industrial schools.<br>
<br>When the Berry government was <i>in articulo mortis</i> Pearson was offered the agent-generalship of Victoria, but having previously criticized such appointments felt obliged to decline it. He did, however, accept an honorary trusteeship of the Melbourne Public Library, Museums and National Gallery, and in this capacity in 1882 worked effectively to secure the foundation of the Melbourne Working Men's College. He failed, however, to carry his proposal to open the Public Library, Museums and National Gallery on Sundays.<br>
<br>In 1883 Pearson was elected for the East Bourke boroughs, for which he sat until the general election in April 1892, when he did not contest the seat. On the formation of the Gillies&#150;Deakin coalition government in February 1886 he became minister of education, a post he held until November 1890. From 1878 until taking ministerial office in 1886 his principal source of income came from writing leading articles and literary reviews for the Melbourne <span class="italic">Age</span> and its weekly, <span class="italic">The Leader</span>, both of which were owned by David Syme. Some 650 anonymous articles written by him from August 1880 to February 1884 had a wide influence on public opinion generally, and particularly in campaigns in which he was involved in his various public capacities.<br>
<br>As minister of education Pearson's greatest success lay in scientific and technical education. He led the government to more than double the grant for the teaching of science and technology, enabling not only the expansion of new technical colleges and established schools of mines, but the building of new chemical, biological, and mechanical laboratories in the university. He also established scholarships to enable 200 primary schoolchildren a year to proceed to independent secondary schools, expanded the state school curriculum to include more science and Australian history and geography, encouraged kindergarten teaching, and had built a fine new teachers' college near the university with residential accommodation for country teachers. In 1889 he successfully resisted a determined campaign by the National Scripture Education League to introduce <span class="roman">Bible</span> instruction into state schools during school hours, arguing that this would be offensive to large numbers of Roman Catholic parents and teachers. An honorary LLD from the University of St Andrews in 1889 recognized his work as an educationist.<br>
<br>An attack of influenza with pneumonia in 1892 led to Pearson's retirement from the assembly and to his return to England, where for a time his health was restored. Financial losses led him to accept in 1893 the post of permanent secretary to the agent-general. He contributed to some English journals, and in 1893 published <span class="italic">National Life and Character: a Forecast</span>, which attracted public attention in Britain, the United States, and Australia by its predictions first, that the so-called &#145;higher races of men, or those which are held to have attained the highest forms of civilization&#146;  (p. 30) would in a few decades find themselves &#145;elbowed and hustled and perhaps even thrust aside&#146;  (p. 85) by peoples whom they had assumed to be innately servile; and second, that in English-speaking and European countries the state would increasingly take over the traditional roles of family and church. Coming at the full tide of imperialist sentiment, this book produced the shock Pearson had expected. Theodore Roosevelt wrote to him: &#145;I don't suppose that any book recently, unless it is Mahan's &#147;Influence of Sea Power&#148;, has excited anything like as much interest or has caused so many men to feel that they had to revise their mental estimates of facts&#146;  (T. Roosevelt to Pearson 11 May 1894, Bodl. Oxf., MSS Pearson). Like Sir M. E. Grant Duff, a former governor of Madras, Roosevelt took the view that the major powers of Europe and America would go to any military lengths to consolidate their dominance of the coloured races. In Australia the book was later quoted by Prime Minister Edmund Barton in defence of the exclusion of coloured migrants and taken up as a sophisticated warning against what Deakin would call &#145;the Yellow Peril to Caucasian civilization creeds and politics&#146;  (A. Deakin to Richard Jebb, 4 June 1908, NLA, MS 339). A second edition appeared in 1894, and a third, posthumously, in 1913.<br>
<br>Pearson died at the house of his sister-in-law, 75 Onslow Square, London, on 29 May 1894, survived by his wife and three teenage daughters. His personal estate was valued at only &pound;511 14<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., and in 1895 his widow was granted a civil-list pension of &pound;100.<br>
<br>Widely travelled and read, with a large number of overseas correspondents, Pearson was the outstanding colonizer of ideas in Australia during the later nineteenth century. Popularly known as &#145;Professor Pearson&#146;, he combined a puritan determination with a gentle manner and a scrupulous respect for the traditional rules and courtesies of public debate. No one did more than he to prepare the way for what became known as the &#145;settled policies&#146; of the new Australian commonwealth. &#145;I can candidly assure you&#146;, wrote Deakin, &#145;that on summing up your colonial experiences you would need to throw into the credit side of the scale an immense amount of other men's actions and words of which you have really been the parent&#146;  (A. Deakin to C. H. Pearson, 12 Aug 1892, State Library of Victoria, Pearson MSS).<br>
