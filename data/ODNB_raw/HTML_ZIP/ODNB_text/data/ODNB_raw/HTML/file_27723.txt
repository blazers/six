</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Trevithick,  Richard</span>  (1771&#150;1833), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, was born near Carn Brea in the parish of Illogan, Cornwall, on 13 April 1771, the only son and youngest of the six children of Richard Trevithick (1735&#150;1797) and Anne Teague (<i>d</i>. 1810). The elder Richard, a practical miner, worked in a number of the copper mines in the extensive Camborne&#150;Illogan&#150;Redruth mining district and rose to become captain (manager) of Wheal Chance, Wheal Treasury, East Stray Park, and the famous Dolcoath mine. At Dolcoath he constructed the deep adit (drainage tunnel) in 1765 and about 1775 erected a Newcomen pumping engine.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandmarriage"></a>Early life and marriage</h2>It was against this background that the younger Richard Trevithick grew up. He was indulged by his mother Anne, and at his local elementary school in Camborne he soon earned a reputation for obstinacy, disobedience, and truancy. However, it was acknowledged that he was quick-witted in an unconventional way and he showed himself to be good with figures. He was also extremely practical, a gift complemented by his proverbial strength. He grew to be 6 feet 2 inches tall and was powerfully built. As a youth he was a renowned wrestler in the Cornish style, and it was alleged that he could hurl a sledge-hammer from ground level clean over the top of a mine engine-house. In Cornwall and elsewhere he became known as the Cornish Giant. He earned a reputation as being gentle and courteous, but to those who knew him there was also a volatile and rash side to his nature.<br>
<br>Although Trevithick received no theoretical training beyond his basic schooling, he existed in an environment steeped in practical mining and engineering; he learned quickly from his father at the family home at Penponds, near Camborne, and from others active in the local mines. The years of Trevithick's childhood and youth were exciting and innovative ones in Cornwall. The introduction of Watt engines in the Cornish mines in the 1770s made redundant the slower, less reliable, and inefficient Newcomen variety and stimulated a new era of experimentation as Cornish engineers strove to evade the Watt patents. The lapse of the patents in 1800 heralded the great age of Cornish steam engineering, epitomized as it was by the emergence and subsequent perfection of the Cornish engine, the development of which Trevithick was to facilitate.<br>
<br>Trevithick married into another mining and engineering family. On 7 November 1797, at St Erth, he married Jane Harvey (1772&#150;1868/9); they had four sons and two daughters. His wife was the daughter of John Harvey of Hayle foundry, Hayle, Cornwall, which became one of the most significant in the county, producing machinery and components for mines and other establishments at home and abroad. Curiously, however, the relationship between Trevithick and the Harveys never reached its full potential, failing to move beyond that of manufacturer and customer.<br>
<br>As early as 1792 Trevithick was engaged to report on the performance of a new engine at Tincroft mine, near Camborne, and in 1795 he was able to introduce fuel-saving improvements in an engine at Wheal Treasury. By 1797 he was engineer at Ding Dong mine, near Penzance, where he improved an engine designed by William Bull, and shortly afterwards he installed an improved Bull engine at Herland mine. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28880/', "James Watt")</script> had already identified Trevithick as his arch-rival in the patent tussle but to the Cornish people he was now something of a local hero, known affectionately as Cap'n Dick.<h2>
<a name="Highpressuresteam"></a>High-pressure steam</h2>By 1800, in a profound departure from Watt's reliance on low pressure, Trevithick had introduced his double-acting high-pressure steam engine, an innovation which opened the way for both the evolution of the Cornish engine and the invention of the steam locomotive. Although high-pressure engines were more expensive to build than their contemporaries, they were much more efficient in their use of coal&#151;an important consideration in Cornwall, where fuel had to be imported from south Wales. Trevithick's new engines were known as &#145;puffers&#146; (to distinguish them from the noiseless condensing engines) and were probably first installed at Dolcoath to wind copper-ore to the surface. A whim (winding) &#145;puffer&#146; is also said to have been installed at the neighbouring Cook's Kitchen in 1800 and was observed to be still in operation there as late as 1870.<br>
<br>About 1802 Trevithick built a small stationary engine for Coalbrookdale in Shropshire (it operated at the unheard-of pressure of 145 lb per sq. in.), but in 1803 he suffered a serious reversal when one of his new high-pressure engines, employed to pump water from the foundations of a mill under construction at Greenwich, exploded with the loss of four lives. Although Trevithick was able to demonstrate that the accident was a result of human error, this did not prevent James Watt and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2983/', "Matthew Boulton")</script> from issuing dire warnings about the dangers of high-pressure steam and the folly of attempting to harness it. Trevithick responded with a range of new safety measures, most notably the &#145;fusible plug&#146; which has remained a standard feature of steam engine design for over 150 years.<br>
<br>Convinced of the flexibility and potential of high-pressure steam, as early as 1806 Trevithick considered the design of new boilers to improve the performance of existing Boulton and Watt pumping engines. However, he was not able to bring this idea to fruition until about 1812, when he harnessed his new &#145;Cornish boilers&#146; to existing engines at Dolcoath. Put simply, the Cornish boiler was horizontal and cylindrical, with a fire tube running through the middle. Following the success of the Dolcoath experiment, in 1812 Trevithick further applied the Cornish boiler at Wheal Prosper (in Gwithian parish) when he used high-pressure steam in both expanding and condensing modes, in effect creating the first prototype for what was to be known (and employed) around the world as &#145;the Cornish engine&#146;. Although others had been experimenting with high-pressure steam, it was Trevithick who had first applied it successfully in an industrial context.<br>
<br>The second outcome of Trevithick's experimentation with high-pressure steam was the steam locomotive. The concept was not new. In 1770 a primitive proto-locomotive had been built in Lorraine, France, by Nicholas Joseph Cugnot, but its tractive effort was virtually non-existent. Similarly, an experimental locomotive constructed by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19561/', "William Murdock")</script> in Redruth, Cornwall, in 1786 proved powerless and unworkable. Trevithick, in contrast, had by 1797 successfully demonstrated at least one working model of a high-pressure steam locomotive. In the previous year he had met Davies Giddy Gilbert, the Cornish technocrat who was to emerge as a major sponsor and advocate of &#145;improving&#146; and &#145;progressive&#146; causes, and together the two men worked to produce a full-size version of Trevithick's locomotive. This is said to have been constructed at Stephen Williams' foundry at the Weeth, Camborne, and it was given its first public demonstration on Christmas eve 1801, an event recorded in the words of the well-known Cornish folk-song &#145;Camborne Hill&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>Goin' up Camborne 'ill, Comin' down,<br>
</div>
<div>Goin' up Camborne 'ill, Comin' down,<br>
</div>
<div>The 'osses stood still, the wheels went aroun',<br>
</div>
<div>Goin' up Camborne 'ill, Comin' down!<br>
</div> (Rowse, 128)</blockquote>A few days later, on 28 December 1801, the locomotive was being driven from Camborne to nearby Tehidy, the seat of the Basset family, when it broke down. The support team adjourned to the local hostelry, allowing the locomotive to overheat and become severely damaged.<br>
<br>Despite this set-back, with the assistance of his cousin Andrew Vivian and the Cornish scientist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7314/', "Sir Humphry Davy")</script>, Trevithick secured a patent for his locomotive on 24 March 1802. Then, in early 1803, a second locomotive was built at Camborne. This version was exhibited in London where it made several successful demonstration runs into the suburbs. However, it suffered a twisted frame, an occurrence which persuaded Trevithick's partners in the project, including Andrew Vivian, to withdraw their support. Undeterred, Trevithick continued the project at the Penydarren ironworks, near Merthyr Tudful in south Wales, where by late 1803 he was employed as engineer.<h2>
<a name="Thefirstrailwaylocomotive"></a>The first railway locomotive</h2>It was at Penydarren that Trevithick constructed what was the first railway locomotive. The first trial of the locomotive took place on 13 February 1804, and on a demonstration run on 21 February it hauled a load of 10 tons of iron, seventy men, and five wagons for a distance of 9&frac12; miles at an average speed of 5 m.p.h. Unfortunately, the permanent way at Penydarren proved unequal to its new task of supporting a railway locomotive, and soon the poorly laid track caused a derailment, after which Trevithick's invention was relegated to the status of stationary engine. However, the locomotive's success was undoubted. It had demonstrated the feasibility of the railway locomotive as a concept, and in so doing had also proved important principles such as the adhesion to rails, as well as establishing enduring railway engineering practices such as the use of coupling rods.<br>
<br>Four years later a new Trevithick locomotive, &#145;Catch-me-who-can&#146;, was exhibited in July and August of 1808 on a circular railway, or &#145;steam circus&#146;, near Gower Street in London. Rides were available at 1<i>s</i>. a head but the enterprise was not a financial success. It was brought to an end when the track again proved inadequate, resulting in a broken rail. Thereafter, having again successfully demonstrated the inherent capability of the steam locomotive, Trevithick seems to have lost interest in this particular project. However, his contribution had been outstanding. As early as 1805 his assistant John Steele had built a Trevithick-designed locomotive at the Wylam colliery in the north-east of England. It was in the north-east that further innovation was achieved, which led to the emergence of the &#145;Newcastle school&#146; of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26397/', "George Stephenson")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26400/', "Robert Stephenson")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Londoninterlude"></a>London interlude</h2>From 1803 to 1807 Trevithick had been engaged to improve a steam dredger at work in the River Thames, and during this period he became interested in a project to drive a tunnel under the river. In 1805 Robert Vazie (a Cornish engineer) had been contracted to construct a tunnel northwards from Rotherhithe but, encountering certain difficulties, he decided to seek Trevithick's involvement in the scheme. Trevithick took charge of the construction during August 1807, but on 23 September&#151;by which time the tunnel had progressed some 950 feet&#151;water broke in and the work was inundated. Trevithick himself was the last to leave the scene, and was almost drowned. Subsequently, he made a number of suggestions as to how the project might be resumed and improved, but the tunnel was abandoned.<br>
<br>Trevithick remained in London, however, and in 1808 he was joined there by his wife Jane and their family. He went into business with a West Indies merchant, Robert Dickinson, setting up a small works in Limehouse. Various patents and inventions emerged (not least the &#145;Nautical Labourer&#146;, a steam tug and floating crane propelled by a paddle wheel), and iron tanks for storing cargo and water in ships were manufactured. However, the business was not a success. There were disagreements between the two partners, and in 1810 Trevithick was ill with typhus. In February 1811 he and Dickinson were declared bankrupt. Dickinson appears to have escaped most of the ensuing financial burden, Trevithick paying off the majority of the outstanding debt and receiving his discharge in 1814.<br>
<br>Trevithick and his family returned to Cornwall in September 1810, as he began to recover from his illness, and it was during the next few years that he was able to develop the potential of his Cornish boiler and high-pressure &#145;plunger-pole&#146; engine. In 1812 at Hayle foundry he built a steam engine designed specifically to drive a threshing machine. It was applied with great success on Sir Christopher Hawkins's Trewithen estate at Probus, near Truro, where it was in operation for seventy years.<h2>
<a name="SouthAmericanadventure"></a>South American adventure</h2>By 1814 Trevithick was beginning to take an interest in the attempts to revive the ancient silver mines of Cerro de Pasco in Peru. He was approached by Francisco Uvill&eacute;, one of the promoters of the proposed reworking, with a view to designing and building equipment for the mines. His response was positive and immediate, and on 1 September 1814 four pumping engines, four winding engines, a portable rolling-mill engine, and much else was shipped from Portsmouth for Peru. Although three of Trevithick's associates had travelled with the engines to ensure their effective installation and operation, Trevithick decided that he too should journey to South America. He sailed from Penzance on 20 October 1816, arriving in Lima to an extravagant reception in February 1817. In all, he was to be abroad for some ten years&#151;a decade of turmoil, change, success, and disappointment.<br>
<br>Despite the warm welcome that Trevithick had received, it soon became apparent that his presence was resented by Uvill&eacute;. Trevithick decided to explore elsewhere in Peru, inspecting mines and becoming involved in the development of a copper and silver mine in the province of Caxatambo. But this was a time of increasing political volatility in Peru, as the war of independence from Spain became widespread and disruptive. For a time Trevithick was attached to Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var's forces, designing a form of carbine for his use, but no sooner was he released from military service than Caxatambo was occupied by the Spanish army. Trevithick was forced to flee, abandoning expensive equipment and some &pound;5000 worth of stockpiled ore. In 1818 Uvill&eacute; died and Trevithick returned to Cerro de Pasco to take charge of the workings. However, his efforts were again frustrated by war when in 1820 a battle took place at the mine and there was much damage to the machinery.<br>
<br>After this set-back Trevithick decided to leave Peru, travelling through Ecuador <i>en route</i> for Bogota in Colombia. He met a certain James Gerard who informed him of potential mining opportunities in Costa Rica. The two men resolved to investigate these possibilities and they visited a range of sites in Costa Rica, identifying and securing the rights for a number of gold and silver prospects. To raise capital to exploit these finds they decided to return to Britain. They crossed the isthmus of Nicaragua on foot (the first Europeans to do so); this was a traumatic journey in which, on one occasion, Trevithick was almost drowned crossing a river and, on another, was menaced by an alligator. From San Juan de Nicaragua they made their way to Cartagena in Colombia, arriving penniless and half-starved.<br>
<br>By a strange coincidence Robert Stephenson was also in Cartagena. In August 1827 Trevithick and Stephenson met, Trevithick exclaiming, &#145;Is that Bobby? I've nursed him many a time&#146;  (Rolt, 139)&#151;a reference to Trevithick's visit to Newcastle upon Tyne in 1805. Stephenson lent Trevithick &pound;50 to pay his fare home, and Trevithick arrived back in Falmouth on 9 October 1827. After a decade's adventuring in South America, his only possessions were the clothes he wore, a gold watch, a draughtsman's compass, a navigator's compass, and a pair of silver spurs.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoBritain"></a>Return to Britain</h2>Although Trevithick received a hearty welcome home in Cornwall, he had been largely forgotten in the rest of Britain, and his belated attempts to seek royalties from his various patents proved largely unsuccessful. Likewise, a petition presented on his behalf to the government in February 1828 was disregarded. These were blows for Trevithick who, with little personal wealth to promote his endeavours, was largely dependent on income from consultancies, commissions, and sponsorships. James Gerard, meanwhile, had landed in Liverpool in late 1827, and together the two men tried to interest London investors in their Costa Rican proposals. Trevithick turned down what he considered to be a paltry offer of &pound;8000 from one speculator for his mineral rights, but shortly afterwards Gerard died in Paris. Thereafter, the Costa Rican project lost its momentum and was soon abandoned.<br>
<br>Despite these financial failures, Trevithick's energy and capacity for invention remained undiminished. In 1828 he was invited to visit the Netherlands to investigate the possibility of using Cornish engines for drainage purposes. It is said that he had to borrow the &pound;2 fare to make the journey, but once in the Netherlands he made a number of suggestions concerning the drainage of submerged land and the construction of dikes. He subsequently designed equipment for use in the Netherlands; it was built at Hayle foundry but for some reason never delivered.<br>
<br>Among other inventions from this period were a closed-cycle steam engine (1829), a portable room heater which was in effect an early form of storage heater (1830), and a design for a ship propelled by a water-jet (1832). Trevithick also designed an enormous column 1000 feet high to commemorate the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> of 1832, a proposal which aroused considerable public attention but was not taken up. His last patent, dated 22 September 1832 (no. 6308), was in connection with the employment of superheated steam.<h2>
<a name="Deathandsubsequenthistoriographicalinvisibility"></a>Death and subsequent historiographical invisibility</h2>At some time in the late 1820s or early 1830s Trevithick entered into an agreement with John Hall of Dartford, Kent, to carry out developmental work on a steam engine of Hall's design. However, Trevithick fell ill and, after a week's confinement in bed in his lodgings at The Bull inn in Dartford, he died on 22 April 1833 at the age of sixty-two. To avoid having a parish funeral for Trevithick, his workmates clubbed together to cover the funeral costs. Trevithick was laid to rest in an unmarked grave in Dartford on 26 April 1833.<br>
<br>Trevithick's wife, Jane, lived to the age of ninety-six. She had remained loyal to him during long years of financial difficulty and separation. (She had received no money from him during his South American sojourn, during which time she was supported by her brother, Henry Harvey.) Of their six children, Francis Trevithick (1812&#150;1877) became chief mechanical engineer of the London and North Western Railway Company, and Frederick Henry Trevithick constructed the floating steam bridge between Portsmouth and Gosport in 1864. Little is known of Richard (1798&#150;1872), John Harvey (1806&#150;1877), Ann, or Elizabeth.<br>
<br>In June 1888 Trevithick was celebrated in a &#145;Trevithick window&#146; in the north aisle of Westminster Abbey, London, in which he was depicted in the guise of St Piran, the patron saint of Cornish miners. However, he has remained somewhat historiographically invisible, despite a laudatory biography written by his son Francis in 1872 and more modern biographies by James Hodge (1973; repr. 1995), L. T. C. Rolt (1960), and others. The unsatisfactory aspects of Trevithick's own life and the early demise of Cornwall as a centre of steam engineering no doubt assisted the process by which the &#145;Newcastle school&#146; of George Stephenson and Robert Stephenson gained general recognition as the &#145;inventor&#146; of the railway locomotive. Only in Cornwall, where the Saturday nearest to the anniversary of his death is celebrated as Trevithick day, are his achievements widely recognized.<br>
