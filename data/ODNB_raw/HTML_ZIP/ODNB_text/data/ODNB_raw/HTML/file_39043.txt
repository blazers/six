<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sainsbury family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1869&#150;1956), <span class="occ">food retailers</span>, originated with <a name="cosubject_39043"></a><span class="headword">John James Sainsbury</span>  (1844&#150;1928)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 12 June 1844 at 5 Oakley Street, Lambeth, the only son and youngest child of John Sainsbury (<i>bap</i>. 1809, <i>d</i>. 1863), ornament and picture frame maker, and his wife, Elizabeth Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Coombes (1817&#150;1902). He was probably educated locally and is believed to have started work as a shop assistant to a grocer in the New Cut, Lambeth. Later he was working in Strutton Ground, Victoria, where he met his future wife, Mary Ann Staples.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_57398"></a><span class="headword">Mary Ann Sainsbury</span>  (1849&#150;1927)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 30 June 1849 at Little Charles Street, St Pancras, the eldest child and only daughter of Benjamin Staples and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cant (<i>c</i>.1827&#150;1909). Benjamin Staples was originally a woodcarver, but by 1864 he had become a dairyman and Mary Ann may have assisted him at his shop at 87 Chalton Street, Euston, before working for Tom Haile, another dairyman, in Strutton Ground. Tradition has it that John James and Mary Ann founded Sainsbury's on their wedding day, 20 April 1869. Their first shop was a dairy at 173 Drury Lane, Holborn, London, run by Mary Ann while John James worked out his notice; poverty obliged them to share the cramped accommodation over the shop with three other families. Mary Ann continued to play an active role in the business until the mid-1870s. Thereafter she devoted herself to the needs of her rapidly expanding family, which, by December 1890, comprised six sons and five daughters. In 1873 the couple moved their young family away from the tenements of Drury Lane to 159 Queen's Crescent, Kentish Town. About 1888 they moved to Bishopsfield, Broadlands Road, Highgate, Middlesex, where they lived thereafter.<br>
<br>The early success of the business was assured by offering in hygienic surroundings high-quality dairy products and fresh provisions at prices which even London's poor could afford. The slogan &#145;Quality perfect, prices lower&#146;, which appeared on early shop fascias, encapsulated this policy. John James was quick to exploit the expanding market for fresh foodstuffs in the railway suburb of Kentish Town and soon opened two further branches in the locality. By the early 1880s he had also taken over several shops from his wife's family and associates in established London market streets in Islington and Stepney. His most significant venture was to acquire in 1882 a shop at 6 (later 11) London Road, Croydon. This was Sainsbury's first branch outside London. It catered for a middle-class clientele by offering a wide range of provisions including foreign cheeses, poultry and game, and &#145;table delicacies&#146; (cooked meats). This shop, which was more elaborately decorated than its predecessors, established the distinctive Sainsbury's house style.<br>
<br>John James Sainsbury's success lay in his ability to match the competitive pricing of the multiples while also offering higher standards of quality, service, and hygiene. This distinguished his shops from Lipton and Home and Colonial, which expanded more rapidly but offered a more limited product range. The slower rate of expansion of Sainsbury's suited John James's management style of closely supervised centralized control. His involvement in the detail of day-to-day business ensured that Sainsbury's retained its family character.<br>
<br>All the sons of John James and Mary Ann were appointed to senior positions in the firm. <a name="cosubject_48169"></a><span class="headword">John Benjamin Sainsbury</span>  (1871&#150;1956)<span class="occ"></span>, the eldest, was taken into partnership on 27 March 1915. The other sons were given responsibility appropriate to their abilities. George, the second son, looked after the firm's accounts, office administration, and distribution, while Arthur and Alfred&#151;the fourth and fifth sons&#151;took on buying roles. Arthur also had responsibility for the production of cooked meats in the firm's &#145;kitchens&#146;. The youngest son, Paul, was involved in building works and design. Frank, the third son, worked on the retail side of the business for a while, but in 1902 he became a farmer, and supplied his father's shops. He improved the quality of the products purchased for the shops by holding agricultural shows and setting up a breeding centre for prize pigs at Haverhill in Suffolk. He also introduced an egg collection scheme which provided a guaranteed market for local producers provided they conformed to specified quality controls.<br>
<br>J. Sainsbury Ltd was incorporated as a joint stock company on 10 November 1922 with an original share capital of &pound;1.3 million. Only members of the Sainsbury family and their descendants were eligible to hold shares. John James became life chairman and governing director. At his death, six years later, his personal holding was reported to be about &pound;300,000.<br>
<br>John James Sainsbury disliked personal publicity and there is little evidence of his private life. His devotion to the business was such that taking his wife for a drive invariably involved a round of branch visits. He continued to attend the office until a month before his death at Bishopsfield on 3 January 1928. Mary Ann had died six months earlier also at Bishopsfield, on 9 June 1927. They were buried at Putney Vale cemetery on 13 June 1927 and 9 January 1928.<br>
<br>John Benjamin Sainsbury succeeded his father as chairman of J. Sainsbury Ltd. He was born above the original Drury Lane shop on 8 January 1871 and educated in Kentish Town, close to his parents' second shop. As soon as he could count, he began to earn pocket money as an &#145;egg boy&#146; and helped to drive his father's single-horse van. He progressed to salesman, learning the business alongside his father and, by 1915, was managing the day-to-day running of the firm's 122 branches. He married Mabel Miriam (1876&#150;1941), daughter of Jacob Van den Bergh, the margarine magnate, in 1896; they had two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74059/', "Robert James Sainsbury")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71184/', "Alan John Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury")</script>, and a daughter.<br>
<br>John Benjamin was, like his father, a natural retailer who spent as much time as possible in the branches. He took the novel step of appointing female branch clerical staff to release managers from administration so that they too could devote themselves to trading matters. During his chairmanship the number of Sainsbury's branches increased from 180 to 248. He took an interest in the individual performance of each branch. Fred Salisbury, his former personal assistant and the first non-Sainsbury to become a director, described him as a &#145;benevolent dictator&#146; who was known for his impetuosity and explosive temper.<br>
<br>John Benjamin's benevolence was most apparent in his concern for staff welfare. At a time when shop work was notoriously insecure and poorly remunerated, Sainsbury's wages were well ahead of competitors such as Lipton, Home and Colonial, and the Co-operatives. He introduced sickness payments, first through the &#145;good fellowship fund&#146; on a discretionary basis in 1922, and subsequently through an insurance and pensions scheme twelve years later. The good fellowship fund also provided payments for employees in adversity. The purchase of a sports ground in 1922 and the setting up of libraries in each branch were further examples of John Benjamin's concern for his staff.<br>
<br>At a time when the alleged loss of skill in the grocer's art had led trade bodies to advocate increased professionalism and practical examinations, Sainsbury's was already providing a structured career progression for promising young men. John Benjamin had introduced a training school at the company's Blackfriars headquarters as early as 1915. This foresight was appreciated by competitors, who advertised for &#145;Sainsbury trained men&#146;. John Benjamin Sainsbury built on his father's successful formula of offering a wide range of high-quality provisions to a broad spectrum of society. This policy provided a more secure basis for the business than the major national multiples could command and gave Sainsbury's an advantage in the inter-war years over Lipton, Home and Colonial, and the International Stores. He also foresaw the retailing opportunities provided by the expansion of London during the inter-war years. He spent hours observing possible locations for new branches and even took his family out at weekends on picnics looking for prospective sites. He was adept at negotiating favourable terms, even boasting that developers had &#145;given&#146; him sites in order to attract Sainsbury's to their locations.<br>
<br>Under John Benjamin's management the business grew in both scale and complexity. The product range expanded threefold over his period of management, with the most notable additions being fresh meat and groceries. However, fresh provisions remained its mainstay. John Benjamin retired at the age of sixty-seven in 1938 following a heart attack, and moved to the Thatched House, Little Common, Bexhill, Sussex. Although he recovered fully, he felt the time was right to pass executive control to his sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71184/', "Alan John Sainsbury (1902&#150;1998)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74059/', "Robert James Sainsbury (1906&#150;2000)")</script>, who became joint general managers. He retained the title of chairman until his death in 1956. He and his wife took a keen interest in the work of several charitable institutions, most notably the Pioneer Health Centre at Peckham, Queen Charlotte's Hospital, and the Mothercraft Training Centre at Highgate. His keen horsemanship was almost the only activity which would tear him away from the business. He rode with the Middlesex Farmers' Draghounds and the Whaddon Chase and, in his earlier days, drove tandems and phaetons. He continued to attend the office in later years and took an active interest in the firm's affairs. When the company ventured into self-service shopping in 1950 he instantly understood the potential of the new retailing method. After viewing the first self-service shop he demanded to know why every branch was not already undergoing conversion. John Benjamin Sainsbury died at the London Clinic, Marylebone, after injuries sustained in a fall, on 23 May 1956. He was cremated at Golders Green crematorium and his ashes buried at Putney Vale cemetery on 29 May; a memorial service was held at Southwark Cathedral on 5 June.<br>
<br>Alan and Robert Sainsbury, as general managers, each specialized in different aspects of the business: Alan on the retailing and trading side, Robert with responsibility for finance and general administration. After the Second World War, and the ending of both food rationing and the restrictions on new building, the brothers made Sainsbury's a leader in the introduction of self-service stores, supported by computerized stock control. Alan Sainsbury took over from his father as chairman in 1956, and served in that role until 1967; he was given a life peerage in 1962.<br>
<br>J. Sainsbury Ltd remained wholly in the ownership of its founding family until 1973, when it underwent public flotation. The Sainsbury family remained major shareholders, however, and retained executive responsibility until 1998. John Sainsbury, who served as chairman from 1969 to 1992, and his cousin David Sainsbury, who succeeded him and retired from the business in 1998, were great-grandsons of the founders. After the flotation the Sainsbury group, J Sainsbury plc, diversified into other retailing activities and operated four store chains in the UK and USA. Sainsbury's Bank, a joint venture with the Bank of Scotland, was established in 1997.<br>
