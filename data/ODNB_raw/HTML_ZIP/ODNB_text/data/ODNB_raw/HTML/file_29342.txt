<span class="headword">Whyte,  Samuel</span>  (1734&#150;1811), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and poet</span>, was born aboard ship on a voyage between Dublin and Liverpool. His mother, whose name has not been discovered, died soon after giving birth. He was once thought to be the natural son of Solomon Whyte, a very extensive landowner from Banbridge, co. Down, but it now seems much more likely that his father was Solomon's younger brother, Richard Whyte (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1744), who was deputy governor of the Tower of London, probably a sinecure not requiring much attendance. Samuel enjoyed a happy childhood in Liverpool, near St Peter's Church, in the home of foster parents, but his fortunes were to change when he returned to Dublin and was reluctantly taken in tow by relations. The only one with a kind word to say to him was his first cousin, Frances Chamberlaine, nine or ten years his senior, who later married the actor and educationist Thomas Sheridan. No doubt to get him out of the way, Samuel was packed off as a boarder to Samuel Edwards's academy in Golden Lane, Dublin, where he obtained a sound education, although there is no information as to how long he remained there.<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1754 Whyte crossed to Liverpool where he revisited the scenes of his childhood. Having lost nearly all his money in that city, he undertook the journey to London on foot with only 9 shillings in his pocket. He appears to have spent a year or so in London where he may have met the woman who was to be his wife, the Therania, apparently, of several of his poems. However, Mrs Whyte never became reconciled to living in Ireland: she missed her friends and, following the birth of three children, her health deteriorated. It is not therefore surprising that the couple separated, although Whyte was exceedingly bitter about the breakup in the poem <span class="italic">The Retrospect</span>, written in 1759.<br>
<br>In April 1758 Whyte set up in Grafton Street, Dublin, a seminary for the instruction of youth, which he also described as an English grammar school. Thomas and Frances Sheridan were to prove a source of great encouragement and support in this project, both by sending their own children to the school and by encouraging some friends and relations to do likewise. Having thus got off to a good start, Whyte's academy soon acquired a great reputation, attracting pupils not only from Dublin but from the provinces as well. It was to number among its pupils the writers Richard Brinsley Sheridan and Thomas Moore, and the duke of Wellington is believed to have spent a short period there before proceeding to Eton College. Catering for boys and girls, Catholics and protestants, its co-educational, interdenominational ethos was, in Ireland at least, two centuries before its time. A hands-on headmaster, Whyte was on visiting terms with the parents of many of his pupils, whom, outside the normal curriculum, he encouraged to take part in private theatricals, to write verse and to socialize at balls, plays, and other entertainments.<br>
<br>Whyte's academy continued to be popular and successful up to the end of the century. It went out of favour after the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> 1801, when the absence of a parliament in Dublin was to result in the decline of that city as a centre of fashion, culture, and the arts. The school lingered on for some years after Whyte's death in 1811 under the direction of his son, Edward Athenry, who had been his father's partner for some years. As well as being a headmaster, Whyte had pretensions to being an educationist. His first work in that sphere was his <span class="italic">Treatise on the English Language</span>, which, though printed in 1761, was published in 1800. His edition of James Burgh's <span class="italic">The Art of Speaking</span> (2nd edn, 1763) proved popular and reached a seventh edition in 1787; Whyte also published &#145;An introductory tract on education&#146; that was prefixed to his <span class="italic">Beauties of History</span> (2nd edn, 1775). In 1772 he published a collection of verse entitled <span class="italic">The Shamrock, or, Hibernian Cresses</span>, a quarto volume of over 500 pages of which thirty-five were devoted to his &#145;Thoughts on the prevailing system of school education&#146; and the rest to verse. However, Whyte conceded that only two thirds of the verse in this bulky tome was his own, the rest being in the main the work of his students. Since this leaves the reader in the predicament of not knowing precisely which are Whyte's poems and which are not, any assessment of Whyte's work as contained in this volume is rendered impossible.<br>
<br>In 1792 Whyte's son Edward Athenry collected his father's work in a 400-page volume entitled <span class="italic">Poems on Various Subjects</span>, of which 280 pages are devoted to verse and the rest to explanatory notes, remarks on Boswell's life of Johnson, and forty pages of what are called &#145;extracts&#146;. It ran to several editions. Again, some of the poems are by other hands, but such poems are duly credited. In this volume Whyte emerges as a fluent versifier for whom, however, no great claims can be made as a poet. There are occasional pieces, such as &#145;A Familiar Epistle to J. H., Esq.&#146; (in reality a description of Dublin in 1758), which, apart from being competent verse, are of interest to the social historian as depictions of life in the Dublin of his time.<br>
<br>In 1801 Whyte and his son Edward Athenry published <span class="italic">Miscellanea nova</span>, a hotchpotch of 280 pages of which only forty are devoted to verse and the rest to letters from various members of the Sheridan family together with Whyte's successful petition to the Irish parliament in the early 1760s to have Thomas Sheridan, then a bankrupt skulking in France, released from his debts. Samuel Whyte died in Grafton Street in September 1811 and was buried in St Anne's churchyard, Dawson Street, Dublin, on 29 September.<br>
