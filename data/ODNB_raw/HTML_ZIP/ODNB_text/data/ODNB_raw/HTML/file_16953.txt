<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lombard,  Peter</span>  (<em>c.</em>1554&#150;1625), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic archbishop of Armagh</span>, was born in Waterford town into an eminent and long-established merchant family. After receiving a good grounding in the classics at Peter White's school in Waterford, he went to the Spanish Netherlands and entered the University of Louvain to study philosophy. He graduated MA in 1572, coming first in his class, before studying theology, and eventually graduated DD in 1594. In the meantime, he was ordained a priest and began lecturing at Louvain, earning a brilliant reputation as a professor first of philosophy and then of theology. In 1594 he was appointed provost of Cambrai Cathedral, and he was also made canon of the collegiate college at Siclin in Tournai.<br>
<br>By the late 1590s the Catholic church was increasingly divided over the issue of divine grace and the role of free will in salvation. The University of Louvain strongly opposed the new emphasis being placed by the Jesuits and their supporters on the importance of free will in securing salvation. In 1598 Lombard was chosen to participate on behalf of Louvain in the ongoing theological debates at Rome. He was also to defend the universities' privileges, which were being challenged by local Jesuits. On his arrival, Lombard quickly impressed Pope Clement VIII with his learning and ability; he spent the rest of his life at Rome, residing at the Palazzo Salviati and becoming theological counsellor to the Holy See.<br>
<br>In 1599 Lombard began acting as an agent at Rome for Hugh O'Neill, earl of Tyrone, who was then leading an uprising against English rule in Ireland. By 1600 he had written his most famous work, <span class="italic">De regno Hiberniae</span>, which is strongly supportive of Tyrone. It begins by defending the Gaelic Irish from charges of barbarity and stresses Ireland's glorious past as a civilized Christian nation, particularly during the early middle ages. Moving to the present, Lombard argued the legitimacy of Tyrone's uprising, declaring that the English had forfeited their right to rule Ireland, based as it was on a papal grant, through their actions against the church. However, many Old English Catholics in Ireland regarded the Gaelic Irish Tyrone as a very imperfect champion of the Catholic cause and remembered how he had failed to support James Fitzmaurice's papal-sponsored crusade to Ireland in 1579. To address these charges, Lombard stressed Tyrone's personal piety and claimed that the earl had long foreseen that the English were bent on the destruction of the Catholic church, but had prudently refrained from taking up arms until he was fully prepared. <span class="italic">De regno Hiberniae</span> was eventually published at Louvain in 1632.<br>
<br>At Rome, Lombard won many influential figures over to Tyrone's cause including Robert Parsons, rector of the English college there, and the duke of Sessa, Spain's papal ambassador. On 18 April 1600 Lombard's lobbying paid off when Pope Clement granted a bull of indulgence to Tyrone's supporters in Ireland and appointed Tyrone captain-general of the Catholic armies in Ireland. However, as Tyrone came under increased military pressure from the English in 1600&#150;01, he badly needed more overt support from Rome. At Tyrone's behest Lombard pressed for Clement to excommunicate those Catholics who opposed Tyrone and to appoint a Spanish nuncio to Ireland. The ultimate goal was for the pope to grant Ireland to Philip II of Spain, who would send his forces to conquer it. However, Clement was strongly anti-Spanish and was not prepared to countenance a further expansion of Spanish power. Moreover, he was also aware that many Catholics in Ireland opposed Tyrone's uprising. As a result he appointed an Italian nuncio and refused to excommunicate pro-government Catholics. However, not wanting to disappoint Tyrone completely, he did make Lombard archbishop of Armagh on 9 July 1601. Lombard had not been Tyrone's first choice for the position, but the earl would be satisfied that a supporter was now head of the Irish church, while the Old English would also be reassured by the promotion of one of their own. As it happened, Lombard was consecrated in Rome, but never went to his archdiocese.<br>
<br>As events swung against Tyrone in Ireland, Lombard began to play a key role in the theological controversies raging at Rome. In 1602 he was appointed president of the special congregation, composed of cardinals and expert theologians, established to debate the issues of grace and salvation. As the congregation wound down its deliberations in 1607, he was authorized to draft the papal bull resolving the controversy. While the majority of the congregation wanted to condemn all forty-two of the propositions attributed to the Jesuit theologian Molina, Lombard's draft condemned only thirty. There is no doubting Lombard's opposition to the Molinists: throughout his career he was a vigorous critic of the Jesuits. His relative moderation on this matter simply reflected his anxiety to preserve the unity of the church. In the event, although Pope Paul V praised Lombard's draft highly, on 28 August 1607 the pontiff dissolved the congregation and ruled that each side should be allowed to follow its own teachings.<br>
<br>During this period Lombard remained deeply engaged in Irish affairs. Following Tyrone's submission to the English early in 1603, Lombard quickly changed his attitude toward the crown, taking the pragmatic view that the Catholic church in Ireland had no option but to accommodate itself to a protestant government. This shift was apparent from the contents of his <span class="italic">Episcopion doron</span>, written in 1604. Dedicated to King James I of England, the book argues that the Catholic church is the one true church and appeals for an end to the persecution of Catholics in Ireland. The deep roots of Catholicism in Ireland are stressed: Catholicism is an intrinsic part of being Irish. The work includes an oblique criticism of Tyrone for exploiting religion to further his own ends.<br>
<br>Thereafter, Lombard deviated from this conciliatory policy only in the immediate aftermath of the flight of Tyrone and Rory O'Donnell, earl of Tyrconnell, from Ireland in autumn 1607. Hoping that this development might precipitate a Spanish invasion of Ireland, Lombard wrote warmly to the earls and sought papal support for armed intervention in Ireland. However, by the time he received the two exiles outside Rome on 29 April 1608, it was clear that no military aid would be forthcoming from either Spain or the pope. Lombard reverted to his policy of appeasing the English in the hope of gaining better treatment for Catholics in Ireland, a decision which soon led to a rift with Tyrone. Indeed, prior to Tyrone's arrival in Rome, Lombard appears to have persuaded the pope not to appoint any of the earl's supporters to Irish bishoprics.<br>
<br>Denied military aid and even permission to travel to Spain, Tyrone cut an increasingly wretched figure at Rome. Despite Lombard's advice, the pope felt obliged to comply with Tyrone's repeated requests on behalf of Florence Conry, who became archbishop of Tuam in 1609, and Eugene McMahon, who was translated to the archbishopric of Dublin in 1611. Lombard was furious at these appointments, believing that the Catholic church should be trying to distance itself from Tyrone. In a memorandum of 1612 he argued that these promotions had precipitated a hardening of the Dublin administration's attitude towards Catholicism, culminating in the execution that year of Conor O'Devany, bishop of Down and Conor. He added that bishops who owed their appointment to Tyrone would achieve little, as they would be subject to constant government harassment. By contrast, Lombard pointed to the success enjoyed by his own deputy David Roth, who had been sent to Ireland about 1610. Roth had opened up informal communications with Sir Arthur Chichester, lord deputy of Ireland, informing him of Lombard's opposition to Tyrone. As a result, Roth was given considerable leeway by the government, being able to resolve a serious dispute between the secular and regular clergy and to hold a provincial synod at Drogheda in 1614.<br>
<br>The Vatican appears to have accepted Lombard's argument that future appointments to Irish bishoprics could not be associates of Tyrone. No further appointments were made until 1618, although ten were made between then and Lombard's death in 1625, and he appears to have had a major bearing on all or most of them. Indeed, in 1619, he was accused of trying to pack the Irish church with his own supporters. Although not averse to some self-aggrandizing, it must also be said that Lombard believed that the promotion of his own supporters was in the best interests of the church. When Tyrone attempted to canvass support for a Spanish invasion of Ireland in 1613&#150;14, Lombard strongly opposed him, declaring that his religion commanded him to remain loyal to his rightful king. Lombard made sure through his nephew Robert that the English heard of this. However, if he was hoping for public appreciation of his efforts from King James, he was to be disappointed. On 21 April 1614, during the course of an address to a delegation of Catholic members of the Irish parliament at Whitehall, James roundly condemned Lombard as a traitor. However, the wily monarch's deeds did not match his words and, in practice, the Dublin government tacitly tolerated Roth's activities in Lombard's name.<br>
<br>An opportunity soon presented itself for Lombard to prove that Catholicism was compatible with loyalty to a protestant king. In England, a group of imprisoned Catholic priests was presented with twelve test questions concerning their attitude towards the king. As theological adviser to the pope, Lombard was charged with drafting the appropriate responses for Catholics in such a situation. The resulting 1052-page manuscript, which was completed in 1616, is Lombard's response to James's criticisms of him. He stresses that James is the rightful king of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and that all Catholics have a duty to acknowledge him as such. Although a heretic, James is a lawful king because he was raised from birth as a protestant and could not have known any better. Lombard does say, however, that Catholics are entitled to disobey laws passed by the king that adversely affect the Catholic religion and that the pope has the power to depose legitimate monarchs who behave like tyrants.<br>
<br>For the rest of his life Lombard was much in demand at Rome for his views on theological issues. On 24 February 1616 he gained an inauspicious place in history by heading the committee of eleven theologians which condemned Galileo's cosmology as heretical. The committee had debated the matter for only five days and showed little appreciation of the issues involved. A year later, Lombard advised the pope on how to approach proposals for a marriage alliance between England and Spain. He strongly endorsed the prospect of a marriage between a Catholic princess and a protestant prince, viewing it as a means of lessening the persecution of Catholics in England and Ireland. Recognizing that bargaining for formal toleration was unrealistic, he hoped that James could be persuaded to desist from enforcing the penal laws.<br>
<br>Apparently, Lombard planned to travel to Ireland in 1620 and again in 1622, but never went. This may have been because he became involved in the long-running controversy over the methods used to convert the natives in Madura. In 1621 he was appointed head of the papal commission to examine whether Jesuit missionaries were justified in adapting Christianity to Brahman customs. The findings of the commission were substantially Lombard's work and had a major bearing on the papal bull issued on 31 January 1623 in favour of such methods. Lombard died shortly after September 1625 at Palombra, about 20 miles from Rome, and was buried in the parish church there.<br>
