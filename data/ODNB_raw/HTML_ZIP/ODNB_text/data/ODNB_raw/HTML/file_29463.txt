<span class="headword">Conches,  William  de</span>  (<em>c.</em>1085&#150;<em>c.</em>1154), <span class="occ">grammarian and commentator on classical texts</span>, derived from Conches in south-east Normandy. The most important source for his life is the <span class="italic">Metalogicon</span> of John of Salisbury, who studied under William between 1138 and 1141. John says that William followed Bernard of Chartres's old-fashioned method of teaching, which centred on the careful exposition of ancient texts; the implication is that he was probably Bernard's pupil. The question of where William taught is much debated. John's account makes it clear that it cannot have been on the Mont-Ste Genevi&egrave;ve. Paris itself is a probable location, because John seems to have studied with other masters at the same time, and only in Paris would this have been possible. However, in spite of the arguments put forward by Southern, some historians think that when John says that he left the Mont-Ste Genevi&egrave;ve to be taught by William, he cannot have meant just that he went into Paris, of which the Mont was a suburb, and they point to allusions in William's writings that suggest that he was a teacher at Chartres. John also says that eventually William gave up his teaching, because students preferred quicker and more fashionable methods of instruction. Instead he formed a connection with the court of Geoffrey the Handsome, duke of Normandy from 1144 to 1149. Not only is William's <span class="italic">Dragmaticon</span> presented in the form of a dialogue with the duke, but he also gave tuition to the duke's sons. In the <span class="italic">Dragmaticon</span> William says that he had taught others for twenty years or more, which would put the beginning of his teaching to <i>c</i>.1120, or perhaps slightly later. In 1979 Southern argued for an earlier date, but this seems impossible, since William was still teaching publicly when John of Salisbury studied with him. Alberic of Trois-Fontaines, chronicling the death of King Stephen in 1154, says that &#145;in his time&#146; William had great celebrity&#151;a comment that suggests that William died shortly before or after 1154.<br>
<br>The writings of William de Conches reflect his three linked interests in grammar, ancient texts, and natural science. His strictly grammatical work took the form of a commentary on Priscian's <span class="italic">Institutiones grammaticae</span>, the standard text for advanced grammatical work in the middle ages. It exists in two recensions, one covering books 1&#150;16, the other the whole work (1st recension: Florence, Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, MS San Marco 310; 2nd recension: Paris, Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, MS Lat. 15130). According to William himself, the first recension was written in his youth (probably <i>c</i>.1120&#150;25), the second in old age (probably late 1140s to 1150s). William was able to draw on the eleventh-century <span class="italic">Glosule</span> to Priscian, but he greatly modified and extended their analysis in the direction of providing a universal grammar.<br>
<br>Expounding ancient texts was part of a grammarian's work. William de Conches interested himself especially in the few ancient and late antique Platonic and Neoplatonic texts then available. He commented on Boethius's <span class="italic">De consolatione philosophiae</span>, on Macrobius's commentary on Cicero's <span class="italic">Somnium Scipionis</span>, and on Plato's <span class="italic">Timaeus</span> in Calcidius's translation (<span class="italic">Glossae super Platonem</span>, ed. E. Jeauneau, 1965). There is also mention by William of a commentary he intended to write on Martianus Capella's <span class="italic">De nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae</span>; a manuscript at Florence  (Biblioteca Nazionale, MS Conv. soppr. I, 1, 28) probably contains material based on it. William's commentaries are remarkable for the extent to which they treat Platonic texts as sources where the Christian scholar, by unravelling metaphorical language, can discover important truths.<br>
<br>William's work as a commentator was closely linked to his interest in natural science, since Macrobius's commentary on the <span class="italic">Somnium Scipionis</span> and the <span class="italic">Timaeus</span> were both rich in scientific discussion. In the <span class="italic">Philosophia mundi</span> (ed. G. Maurach, 1980), William begins by briefly considering God before talking about the elements, the stars, the seas, and the earth, and then human beings&#151;how they are conceived, their senses, and their souls. It is a plan which, very roughly, might have been suggested by the <span class="italic">Timaeus</span> itself. The <span class="italic">Philosophia</span> exists in two recensions, in one of which some of the more daring points are put in more guarded language. In the <span class="italic">Dragmaticon</span> (printed as <span class="italic">Dialogus de substantiis &hellip; a Vuilhelmo Anoponymo philosopho</span> by G. Gratarolus, Strasbourg, 1567; repr. 1967), William treats the same topics in dialogue form, sometimes developing his earlier ideas and abandoning former certainties for a more complex and tentative approach. Besides ancient texts such as the <span class="italic">Timaeus</span>, Macrobius, and Seneca's <span class="italic">Quaestiones naturales</span>, other material translated from the Arabic influenced William's scientific speculations, especially, in his discussion of the elements, Constantine the African's <span class="italic">Pantegni</span>.<br>
<br>From internal cross-references, the order of William's compositions must have been: commentary on Boethius, commentary on Macrobius, <span class="italic">Philosophia</span>, commentary on Priscian (1st version)&#151;almost certainly all before 1130; commentary on <span class="italic">Timaeus</span>, <span class="italic">Dragmaticon</span> (1144&#150;9), commentary on Priscian (2nd version). In the course of his career William became increasingly reluctant to propose ideas that might be considered heterodox. For instance, he gradually moved from asserting the identity between Plato's &#145;world soul&#146; and the Holy Spirit, as he did in his commentary on Boethius, to proposing the identification as a possible view, and finally to omitting it entirely in the <span class="italic">Dragmaticon</span>. Indeed, in his preface to that work, William explicitly renounces a number of the more daring theological ideas put forward in the <span class="italic">Philosophia mundi</span>. He may have been influenced by a letter written to Bernard of Clairvaux by Guillaume de St Thierry about 1141, attacking William's orthodoxy and describing his errors as worse than Peter Abelard's. But Bernard, who had conducted a vigorous campaign against Abelard at Guillaume de St Thierry's prompting, was not this time incited into action&#151;perhaps because William de Conches showed himself willing to abandon his contentious positions.<br>
<br>A florilegium of ancient ethical texts, the <span class="italic">Moralium dogma philosophorum</span> (ed. J. Holmberg, 1929), has often been attributed to William, but almost certainly wrongly. Historians have been misled into thinking there is positive evidence for the attribution by additions made by the early thirteenth-century reviser of the treatise, Bartolomeo da Recanati. Moreover, it is very unlikely that the <span class="italic">Moralium dogma</span> was written before the late 1150s, by which time William was almost certainly dead.<br>
