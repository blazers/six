<span class="headword">Coghill,  Marmaduke</span>  (1673&#150;1739), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was born in co. Dublin on 28 December 1673, the eldest son of Sir John Coghill (<i>d</i>. 1699?), formerly of Coghill Hall in Yorkshire, and of Hester Cramer, a descendant of Colonel Tobias von Cramer, of Swabian origin, who had settled in Ireland earlier in the century. Having entered Trinity College, Dublin, Coghill graduated BA and LLB in 1691 and was made LLD in 1695. Elected first, in 1692, to sit in the Irish House of Commons for co. Armagh he continued to sit in the house from 1713 onwards as a member for Trinity. In the Commons, following the accession of George I, Coghill was to align himself with like-minded individuals in Speaker Conolly's group. In 1699 Coghill succeeded his father as judge of the Irish prerogative court, an elevation that began his close involvement with the affairs of the established Church of Ireland.<br>
<br>The post involved Coghill in deciding on grants of faculties but weightier business soon supervened. Under English legislation of 1701 Coghill was named one of six trustees for forfeited Irish impropriations, the income from which was to be used to build churches and to augment small vicarages. The restoration by Queen Anne's government in 1711 of the first fruits added to Coghill's administrative tasks. An original commissioner of the resultant board he was to earn plaudits as &#145;the great, and indeed principal cause of the numerous benefits&#146; that accrued to the established church from the restoration  (Taylor, 419). Coghill was also associated with the administration of the complementary augmentation scheme devised by Archbishop Hugh Boulter.<br>
<br>At the outset, the relationship between Coghill and Boulter was prickly enough. Coghill made no secret of his disenchantment over the choice of Boulter for the prelacy in 1727 but a <i>modus vivendi</i> soon emerged, despite Boulter's suspicion (which he never shrugged off) that Coghill was more sympathetic to the &#145;Irish interest&#146; than was appropriate or the situation demanded. Boulter supported Coghill's appointment in 1729 as a commissioner of the revenue (which earned him a seat in the privy council), and six years later no objection was raised to his promotion to fill the largely honorific role of chancellor of the Irish exchequer.<br>
<br>Coghill's correspondence with the two Edward Southwells, father and son, successive Irish secretaries of state, reveals considerable political acumen, and nowhere is this clearer than in his blow-by-blow account (which elements in the London administration must surely have welcomed) of the crisis that unfolded over the attempt, initiated in 1722, to foist Wood's halfpence on a recalcitrant country.<br>
<br>As judge of the prerogative Coghill dealt with matters of testate and intestate succession, but questions of marriage law could equally come before him, and one celebrated decision of his in the latter area was destined to enter local folklore; it also explains why he never married. According to Deane Swift, Marmaduke:<blockquote>courted a lady, and was soon to have been married to her; but unfortunately a cause was brought to trial before him, wherein a man was sued for beating his wife. When the matter was agitated, the doctor gave his opinion, &#145;That, although a man had no right to beat his wife unmercifully, yet that with such a little cane or switch as he then held in his hand, a husband was at liberty, and was invested with a power to give his wife moderate correction&#146;; which opinion determined the lady against the doctor. (Swift, 1.304)</blockquote>Gravely ill from gout and attendant complications Coghill resigned his judgeship in January 1739. He proposed a kinsman, Nathaniel Bland, as his successor, but Boulter, who had control of the appointment, refused Bland a permanency. Coghill witnessed only the first instalment of the ensuing crisis (resolved finally by a chancery decree in 1741) for he died on 9 March 1739. He was buried in the family vault in St Andrew's Church, Dublin. A handsome marble monument to him, by Peter Scheemakers, was erected by his sister Mary in Drumcondra Church of Ireland church. A lengthy inscription pays tribute to his virtues, which were also recalled in an anonymous tribute, &#145;The Wonderful Man&#146;, penned in the 1720s:<blockquote>
<div>His Favours never yet were bought,<br>
</div>
<div>And often come, tho' never sought.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>A portrait of Coghill hangs in All Hallows College in Dublin, which incorporates Drumcondra House, the fine Georgian mansion Coghill built for himself about 1725.<br>
