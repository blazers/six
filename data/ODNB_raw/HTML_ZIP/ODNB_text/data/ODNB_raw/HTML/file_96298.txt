<span class="headword">Purcell,  Victor William Williams Saunders</span>  (1896&#150;1965), <span class="occ">colonial administrator and historian</span>, was born on 26 January 1896, the son, and apparently the only child, of Victor Adolphus Purcell (1863&#150;1951), clerk in the Royal Navy, and his wife, Harriett Eva, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Saunders. He was educated at Bancroft's School, then in November 1914 was commissioned second lieutenant in the 11th battalion of the Green Howards. During his war service in France he was wounded and, in April 1918, taken prisoner.<br>
<br>Following his repatriation and demobilization Purcell studied international law at Trinity College, Cambridge (1919&#150;21), but left early in 1921 without graduating in order to take up an appointment to the Malayan civil service. He opted for the Chinese-speaking cadre of the service in order to have two years' study of Cantonese and Mandarin at Canton. He then served in Malaya, mainly in the Chinese protectorate, specializing in its work of supervising Chinese education. This was also the subject of his PhD thesis (&#145;Education and the West in modern China&#146;, Cambridge, 1935). However, he had a comprehensive knowledge of the Malayan Chinese and his book <span class="italic">The Chinese in Malaya</span> (1948) was for many years regarded as a standard work. In 1931 he married (Margarita) Norah Mary No&euml;lle Burbury (<i>d</i>. 1981), but incompatibility soon led to the dissolution of the marriage. They had one son, Hugh Dominic Purcell (1932&#150;2002).<br>
<br>The colonial hierarchy in Malaya recognized Purcell's ability but, in his own words, came to regard him as &#145;a turbulent and adventurous character&#146; who needed watching  (Purcell, 312). In 1940 he was seconded to the UK information ministry as head of its publicity department in Singapore under Sir Robert Scott. He went off to spread the message in Australia and then the USA, where in 1941 he married Jean Rivers, an American whom he described as a &#145;cheerful bohemian&#146;  (ibid., 329). The marriage lasted amicably until his death, though latterly his wife lived apart in New York.<br>
<br>In December 1941 a delayed return passage to Malaya saved Purcell from falling into the hands of the Japanese. After a spell in Australia he moved to London to become the senior Chinese expert of the Malayan planning unit, which prepared a post-war constitution (the Malayan union) that treated the immigrant communities as permanent settlers in Malaya but was utterly unacceptable to the Malays. Purcell regarded the restoration of the rulers' sovereignty in 1948 as a retrograde step towards feudalism. During the British military administration (September 1945 &#150; March 1946) Purcell took a leading part in a firm but conciliatory containment of the aspirations of the communist-led and Chinese-dominated Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army to take control of the country. He was appointed CMG in 1946, but retired on the restoration of civil government in the same year, since he disagreed with the high commissioner, Sir Edward Gent, over his future official position. His retirement deprived Gent, who had urged him to stay, of well-informed advice in dealing with the Chinese in the &#145;emergency&#146; that erupted in 1948. Purcell was later a vigorous champion of the British record in Malaya and even took the questionable view that the years between the wars were its climax and &#145;a serene and happy&#146; period  (Purcell, 359).<br>
<br>After two years as a United Nations consultant Purcell, in 1949, was appointed to a lectureship in Far Eastern history at Cambridge, from which he retired in 1963. He travelled widely and in 1952 revisited Malaya to advise the Malayan Chinese Association on current constitutional negotiations. His statements troubled the waters of inter-communal relations and Sir Gerald Templer, the high commissioner, summoned him for an abusive &#145;dressing down&#146; that is not unknown to the regular army but was deeply offensive to an academic of Purcell's temperament. In journal articles and a book, <span class="italic">Malaya: Communist or Free?</span> (1954), Purcell accused Templer of subordinating the necessary progress of Malaya towards self-government to the short-term requirements of a police state. Templer had provoked the dispute but perhaps had the better case, though it damaged the reputation of both men.<br>
<br>In addition to his authoritative writing on China and on the Chinese in south-east Asia Purcell wrote satirical verse and other literary works. He was a large figure and a dominant personality. Notwithstanding his violent criticisms of Templer, his &#145;urbanity, wit and distaste for everything pretentious made him &hellip; the most charming of literary companions&#146;  (Short, 380). His memoirs, published posthumously as <span class="italic">The Memoirs of a Malayan Official</span> (1965), were anecdotally ebullient but occasionally defensive. In the Green Howards' officers' mess he and others were &#145;just plain British <i>bourgeoisie</i> &hellip; with working class grand-parents&#146; and he had attended an ancient but &#145;obscure&#146; public school  (Purcell, 11). In the Malayan civil service &#145;most of us belonged by origin to the upper lower middle class&#146;  (ibid., 291), but he married a wife distantly connected &#145;with the British aristocracy&#146;  (ibid., 329). However, he was a good administrator, with sound judgement unless provoked, an excellent scholar, and a prolific author, and he had many friends, not least among the Malayan Chinese. He died at his home, 10 Lyndewode Road, Cambridge, on 2 January 1965, of heart failure, and was survived by his second wife and the son of his first marriage.<br>
