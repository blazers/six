<span class="headword">Hughes,  Thomas John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Adfyfr]</span>  (1853&#150;1927), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born in Bridgend, Glamorgan, the son of the Revd Thomas Hughes of Miskin, Llantrisant, Glamorgan. He rose to prominence in October 1886 when he published under the pseudonym Adfyfr the first of three essays on the political condition of Wales in the Liberal <span class="italic">Daily News</span> (on the land question on 12 October 1886, the established church on 27 October 1886, and education on 16 November 1886). These essays appeared as <span class="italic">Neglected Wales</span> (1887), the first of a series of pamphlets published by the South Wales Liberal Federation. Third in the series was his <span class="italic">Landlordism in Wales</span> (1887), an indictment of the power of landowners and the &#145;politico-ecclesiastical alliance in Wales&#146;, endorsed in an appendix by Stuart Rendel, Liberal MP for Montgomeryshire (1880&#150;94) and president of the North Wales Liberal Federation. Privately, however, Rendel and other Welsh Liberal leaders disapproved of Adfyfr's overblown political style and sought to marginalize his influence within Welsh Liberalism. A pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Welsh Magistracy</span> also appeared under the name Adfyfr. Between January 1888 and May 1889 he was the founding editor of the bilingual Liberal nationalist monthly <span class="italic">Cymru Fydd</span>, and in June 1890 was delegated to represent the North and South Wales Liberal Federations on the general committee of the National Liberal Federation.<br>
<br>In declining health from the early 1890s, Adfyfr turned to newspaper journalism, becoming south Wales correspondent of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> and the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, papers which he praised for having &#145;substantially assisted the Principality to speak its deep-seated convictions in English&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cymru Fydd</span>, 1/3, 1888, 126). He was also for more than forty years before his death Pontypridd and Rhondda reporter for the <span class="italic">South Wales Daily News</span>, and served for a time as its sub-editor. He augmented his income by acting as a private secretary to Alfred Thomas, Liberal MP for East Glamorgan (1885&#150;1910), and as an official shorthand writer in the bankruptcy court and public inquiries. He was a practising Calvinistic Methodist, and helped establish the St David's Calvinistic Methodist Church, Gelliwastad Road, Pontypridd. He resisted on grounds of ill health Lord Rhondda's inducements to return to active political life during the First World War, and devoted his final years to newspaper reporting and shorthand writing. He died of heart disease at Pontypridd on 24 October 1927, leaving a widow, six sons, and six daughters. He was buried at Glyntaf cemetery, Pontypridd, on 28 October 1927.<br>
