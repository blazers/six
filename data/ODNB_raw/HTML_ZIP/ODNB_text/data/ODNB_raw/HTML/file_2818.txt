<span class="headword">Bonar,  Andrew Alexander</span>  (1810&#150;1892), <span class="occ">Free Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born at Paterson's Court, Edinburgh, on 29 May 1810, the seventh son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2815/', "James Bonar (1757&#150;1821)")</script>, solicitor of excise, and Marjory Maitland (<i>d</i>. 1854), daughter of James Pyott, bailie of Montrose. He was educated at Edinburgh high school, where he was dux, before studying at Edinburgh University. Although he intended to follow his elder brothers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2814/', "Horatius Bonar")</script> and <a href="#cosubject_2818">John James Bonar [<i>see below</i>]</a> into the ministry, he did not undergo a conversion experience until October 1830. He began his divinity studies the following year and was licensed by the presbytery of Jedburgh in July 1835. He worked as an assistant in Jedburgh until in November 1836 Robert Smith Candlish offered him a position as missionary in St George's parish, Edinburgh. He was ordained assistant and successor to the parish of Collace, Perthshire, in September 1838.<br>
<br>The early years of Bonar's ministry were distinguished by his friendship with Robert Murray McCheyne. Their circle also included William Chalmers Burns and Alexander Somerville. In 1839 he accompanied McCheyne, with Alexander Black and Alexander Keith, to the Holy Land. Bonar's description of their journey appeared in 1842 as <span class="italic">Narrative of a Mission of Inquiry to the Jews</span>. This book was hugely popular and would itself have assured him of lasting influence, even had it not been followed by the still more popular <span class="italic">Memoir and Remains of the Rev Robert Murray McCheyne</span> (1844). Bonar published numerous other works, chief among which were <span class="italic">A Commentary on the Book of Leviticus</span> (1846) and his edition of Samuel Rutherford's <span class="italic">Letters</span> (1848).<br>
<br>After the Disruption of 1843, in which controversy he joined as a pamphleteer, Bonar remained in Collace as minister of the Free Church congregation. He married on 4 April 1848 Isabella Dickson (<i>d</i>. 1864), with whom he had four daughters and two sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31951/', "James Bonar (1852&#150;1941)")</script>, civil servant and economist. In December 1856 he transferred to a new congregation at Finnieston, in Glasgow, where he remained for the rest of his life. His later publications included <span class="italic">Christ and his Church in the Book of Psalms</span> (1859). He received the degree of DD from Edinburgh in 1874 and was elected moderator of the Free Church general assembly in 1878. It was also in that year that his congregation moved to a larger building near the West End Park, Glasgow. He died, after a short illness, at his home, 20 India Street, on 30 December 1892 and was buried in Sighthill cemetery on 4 January 1893. His diary and letters were collected and published by his daughter.<br>
<br>Invariably described as saintly, one obituary described Bonar as &#145;an Evangelical of the Evangelicals&#146;  (<span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>, 2 Jan 1893). He was little interested in church courts and accepted the moderatorship with reluctance; his interest lay in evangelism and revival, and he latterly worked closely with the American Dwight L. Moody. While staunchly conservative in matters of doctrine he held some unfashionable views, for example on prophecy and millennialism, which he had formed under the influence of Edward Irving. As a preacher he was notable for his unusual sing-song delivery, and for the stamina that allowed him to preach three or four times a Sunday until almost the end of his life.<br>
<br>His elder brother <a name="cosubject_2818"></a><span class="headword">John James Bonar</span>  (1803&#150;1891), <span class="occ">Free Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 25 March 1803. Educated at the high school and Edinburgh University, he was licensed by the presbytery of Edinburgh in April 1827. He served as assistant at Scoonie, Fife, before succeeding William Cunningham as assistant to Dr John Scott of the Middle parish church, Greenock, in January 1834. A year later, a dispute led to the withdrawal of a portion of the congregation with Bonar as their pastor. He was ordained minister of St Andrew's Chapel, West Stewart Street, Greenock, in August 1835. After the Disruption of 1843 Bonar and his congregation adhered to the Free Church and, unusually, were able to retain their building. Bonar remained in St Andrew's Free Church for the rest of his long ministry.<br>
<br>The least well known, though possibly the most genial of the three brothers, Bonar shared many of their gifts. Like them he was an evangelical who combined the covenanting spirit of the seventeenth century with the literary cultivation of the nineteenth. An outstanding preacher, he was also a contributor to the <span class="italic">Presbyterian Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of Prophecy</span>. He was for fifty years secretary of the Greenock branch of the Bible Society. Bonar married on 17 July 1838 Isabella Watt (<i>d</i>. 1875), with whom he had five sons, two of whom died in infancy. In 1883 he was honoured with the degree of DD from Edinburgh University. He died at his home in Greenock on 7 July 1891, and was buried in the town cemetery.<br>
