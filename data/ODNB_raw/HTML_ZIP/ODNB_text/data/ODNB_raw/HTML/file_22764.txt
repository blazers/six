<span class="headword">Price,  Sampson</span>  (1585/6&#150;1630), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious writer</span>, was born in Shrewsbury where his father, Thomas Price (<i>d</i>. 1620), was minister of St Chad's. He followed his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22745/', "Daniel Price (1581&#150;1631)")</script>, to the stoutly Calvinist Exeter College, Oxford, matriculating aged sixteen on 30 April 1602, but transferred to Hart Hall, from where he graduated BA on 28 February 1605 and proceeded MA on 6 June 1608. Like his brother, he served on the staff of the strongly protestant prince of Wales, and he was almoner of the Chapel Royal at Prince Henry's death in November 1612. In 1609 he had succeeded Daniel as rector of St Martin's, Carfax, Oxford, although he did not receive a preaching licence until 13 May 1615, the year he vacated the living.<br>
<br>By that time Price had already preached at Paul's Cross in London. On 10 October 1613, in a sermon published as <span class="italic">London's Warning by Laodicea's Lukewarmnesse</span> (1613), he offered Londoners a general warning of the dangers inherent in religious toleration. In his painful homily (<span class="roman">Revelation</span> 3: 15, 16) he attacked atheists, papists, and puritans alike. He further claimed that the death, eleven months before, of Prince Henry, &#145;that sweet Prince, of fresh and bleeding memory, the expectation of all the Christian world&#146;  (p. 41), was itself the sinful consequence of lukewarmness. He dedicated &#145;these rude first-fruits of my paines at the Crosse&#146;  (sig. A2) to John King, bishop of London, no doubt hoping for a city benefice since his erstwhile royal master was dead. Initially it was only to a lectureship, that of St Olave (which London parish of that name is unclear), that he was appointed on 24 April 1615.<br>
<br>Price returned to themes of England's jeremiad when he next preached from <span class="roman">Revelation</span> at the Cross on 17 March 1616. In this sermon, published as <span class="italic">Ephesus Warning before her Woe</span> (1616), he denounced the moral decay in London. The city could equal Rome's glory but for the &#145;byting <i>usurers, inticing Dalilaes</i>, and <i>cozening cheaters</i>&#146;  (p. 71) that were not only the sport and subject of plays but were likely to prompt God's judgment. He pointedly dedicated the sermon to Robert Sidney, Viscount L'Isle, who was lord chamberlain to the Catholic Queen Anna of Denmark. Such homilies won for him the sobriquet of &#145;the Mawl of Hereticks&#146;  (Hennessy, lix).<br>
<br>Price proceeded BD from Exeter College on 13 June 1615 and DD on 30 June 1617. On 28 July that year Archbishop George Abbot collated him to the rectory of All Hallows-the-Great in London. On 9 October the mayor and corporation and the governors of St Bartholomew's Hospital appointed him vicar of the former Franciscan royal church of Christchurch, Newgate Street; he took up residence at New Rents in the parish, and published his remaining printed sermons from there. In 1617 he also preached another admonition, at Condover, Shropshire, published as <span class="italic">The Cleansing of the Saints Sight</span> and on 10 September preached to the corporation of Shrewsbury at the dedication of the town's school chapel by Bishop John Overall. The homily, issued as <span class="italic">The Beauty of Holiness</span> (1618), continued his attack on atheists who despised &#145;the calling of the Teachers of our Temples; scorning <i>Priests</i>, whose spirituall sacrifice of praier, God accepteth as well as he did incense in the old law&#146;  (p. 31). By the spring of 1618 he had become a chaplain-in-ordinary to James VI and I. In 1620 he became vicar of his father's old Shrewsbury church, a post that he held until 1628.<br>
<br>On 8 July 1621 Price preached at Oatlands an anti-Spanish homily. He took as his text Isaiah's prophecy of the Babylonian captivity on learning that Hezekiah had shown his household treasures to the Babylonian ambassadors (<span class="roman">2 Kings</span> 20: 13&#150;18) and linked this to Spanish aggression in Germany. This occasioned a short spell of imprisonment in the Tower. According to Joseph Mead, the king threatened to have him hanged for being &#145;too busy with Rochelle, the Palatinate, and the Spaniard&#146;  (Birch, 2.265&#150;6) and it was only Prince Charles who seemingly interceded for his chaplain. A longer term consequence of his intemperate words may have been the forfeiture of his chaplaincy: his name does not appear in the list of those serving in 1621. However, he seems to have been in the household of Prince Charles and was back in harness as royal chaplain by 5 September 1624 when he preached at the funeral of Sir William Byrde, dean of arches, a sermon published as <span class="italic">The Two Twins of Birth and Death</span> (1624).<br>
<br>In 1622 Price was preacher to Gray's Inn, where his sensitivities to the threat posed by Catholicism to protestant Europe would have been welcome. On 14 July 1626 he was collated by his brother Daniel, by this time dean of Hereford, to the prebendal stall of Church Withington in that cathedral. He died intestate late in 1630 and was buried in the chancel of Christchurch, Newgate Street; administration of his estate was granted on 13 January 1631 to his widow, Elizabeth, of whom nothing else is known.<br>
