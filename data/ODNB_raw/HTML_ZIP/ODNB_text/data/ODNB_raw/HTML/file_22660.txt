<span class="headword">Powell,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1635), <span class="occ">lawyer and writer</span>, of Welsh parentage, came from the same family as Sir Edward Powell, who became master of requests in 1622. Thomas Powell was described as &#145;Londino-Cambrensis&#146; on a number of his works and, when he entered Gray's Inn in London on 30 January 1593, his home was given as Diserth, Radnorshire. Nothing is known of his early life and education.<br>
<br>Powell published his first work, a long poem, <span class="italic">Loves Leprosie</span>, in 1598, dedicating the work to Sir Robert Sidney. The poem tells the story of the death of Achilles, treacherously slain by Paris, after he had arranged to meet Polyxena in the temple of Apollo. Achilles' death was in revenge for his killing of Hector, who, in turn, had prevented the marriage of Achilles and Polyxena. A second long poem, <span class="italic">The Passionate Poet, with a Description of the Thracian Ismarus</span> (1601), was dedicated to Lady Frances, countess of Kildare (who is later mentioned in <span class="italic">Vertues Due</span>, and so may have been one of Powell's early patrons). It is another work inspired by classical settings and consists mainly of a series of descriptions of the variety of trees&#151;including vine, olive, myrtle, oak, bay&#151;found near Athens.<br>
<br>Powell's verse has not fared well at the hands of the few critics who have read his work, and he is generally considered to be incompetent and obscure as a writer (though this may be because he tried to imitate the harsh rhythms and style fashionable among young writers in London in the 1590s). He wrote little more separately published poetry&#151;though his later published works are interspersed with a number of poems&#151;probably because his legal career started to take off. His first prose work was <span class="italic">A Welch Bayte to Spare Provender, or, A Looking Back at the Times</span> (1603), dedicated to Henry Wriothesley, earl of Southampton, a warning of the dangers to the state from both Catholics and dissenters; Powell praised Elizabeth's moderate religious policy, warned of the impending dangers of the succession, and looked forward to James's plans to unite the people of England and Scotland. The book, containing poems to Lady Elizabeth Brydges, Sir Thomas Knevet, and Sir Edward Dyer, was called in and the publisher, Valentine Simms, was ordered to pay a fine of 13<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. for printing it without a licence. The entry in the Stationers' register also refers to a collection of ballads printed by Simms, which probably indicates that Powell had infringed others' rights to the material rather than incurred any official objection to the work. In the same year Powell published <span class="italic">Vertues Due, or, A True Modell of the Life of the Right Honourable Katherine Howard</span>&#151;dedicated to her widower, Charles Howard, earl of Nottingham, the lord high admiral. This lament for Katherine Howard's death was written in sestets and emphasized her chastity, comparing her to Diana and Astrea. A Latin dedicatory poem by &#145;T. P.&#146;, prefaced to John Ford's <span class="italic">Fames Memoriall, or, The Earle of Devonshire Deceased</span> (1606) may also be by Powell.<br>
<br>Powell was appointed solicitor-general in the Welsh marches on 13 November 1613, a position he held until 5 August 1622. He appears to have been searching assiduously through the legal records in the chancery, the Tower of London, and the exchequer in this period&#151;research which was to form the basis of his most important works. In 1622 he published <span class="italic">Direction for the Search of Records Remaining in the Chancerie, Tower, Exchequer, &amp;</span>, prefaced with dedicatory poems to James, Prince Charles, William Noy, reader at Lincoln's Inn, Sir James Ley, lord chief justice, Sir Edward Powell, master of his majesty's requests, James, Viscount Doncaster, and Sir Thomas Coventry. In the address to the reader Powell refers to his twenty years' work in these archives in order to help lawyers prepare for court cases.<br>
<br>In 1623 Powell published <span class="italic">The Attourneys Academy, or, The Manner of Proceding upon any Suite</span>, &#145;The first printed treatise on common-law proceedure&#146;  (Baker, 96). This work was again dedicated to the king and others such as Sir James Ley and Francis, Lord Verulam, Viscount St Albans, and was reprinted three times in the next seven years. It listed and described all the procedures to be followed in English courts, giving details of the requisite fees and locations, in order to benefit all the king's subjects. There was an extensive table appended for ease of use. He also published <span class="italic">Wheresoever you See mee, Trust unto your Selfe, or, The Mysterie of Lending and Borrowing</span>, a survey of all the types of creditor and debtor, dedicated to &#145;the two famous universities, the seminaries of so many desperate debtors, Ram Ally and Milford Lane&#146;. This may have been satirical in intent, but it provides a wealth of information about credit practices in the early 1600s.<br>
<br>On 14 September 1623 Powell petitioned James to request the co-operation of judges and court officers to give him all the necessary information on court fees and other details so that his manuscript, &#145;Direction for the search of records&#146;, a work that Powell claimed would be more useful than the <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>, could be completed. James granted the request and <span class="italic">The Reperterie of Records at Westminster</span> (1631), an extensive catalogue of the records in the chancery, the Tower, and the exchequer, was the result (though it is clear that not all the work is by Powell).<br>
<br>In 1627 Powell published <span class="italic">The Attornies Almanacke</span>, a list of courts designed to help those who have to move &#145;any person, cause, or Record, from an inferior Court to any of the higher Courts at Westminster&#146;. In the same year he is mentioned in a letter from the mayor of Monmouth to the privy council dated 7 September, indicating that he had not paid his share of the loan money assessed on the town. <span class="italic">Tom of All Trades, or, The Plain Pathway to Preferment</span> was published in 1631, a dialogue between the author's fictional persona and a gentleman from Northampton dealing with the way to bring up children, provide for their education, and prepare them for a trade or profession. It contains significant information on English education, schools, and the expectations of the minor gentry in Caroline England, and was reprinted in 1635 as <span class="italic">The Art of Thriving, or, The Plaine Way to Preferment</span> (together with <span class="italic">The Mysterie of Lending and Borrowing</span>). Powell died probably about 1635, leaving &#145;The Breath of an Unfeed Lawyer, or, Beggers Round&#146; in manuscript (Cambridge University Library).<br>
