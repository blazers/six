<span class="headword">Kirkestede,  Henry</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1314, <em>d.</em> in or after 1378), <span class="occ">prior of Bury St Edmunds and bibliographer</span>, was known to early modern biographers as Bostonus Buriensis or John Boston of Bury. Kirkestede came from the Bury dependency of Kirstead (&#145;Kirkestede&#146; and &#145;Kerkestede&#146; in Bury documents) in Norfolk, not from Kirkstead in Lincolnshire as was previously believed. He was ordained priest at Ely in 1338. If he was then twenty-four, the earliest age canonically permitted, he would have been born in 1314. Ordination normally took place seven years after the completion of the novitiate. Kirkestede would have entered the abbey at Bury as a novice monk between the ages of seventeen and twenty-one (<i>c</i>.1331&#150;<i>c</i>.1335). His activities at Bury can be reconstructed from the numerous notes, some of them signed, that he wrote in Bury manuscripts.<br>
<br>Kirkestede's life can be divided roughly into two parts. The first was a relatively peaceful period between 1338 and 1361, in which should be situated his work as novice master and librarian as well as most of his written work relating to these occupations, the <span class="italic">Speculum</span> and the <span class="italic">Catalogus</span>. The second part, a turbulent period from 1361, when he became prior, until his death in or after 1378, was dominated by the effects on the abbey of the black death, which visited Bury in 1349, 1361, and 1368.<br>
<br>By 1346 Kirkestede was one of the abbot's chaplains, doubtless involved in defending the abbey against accusations of corruption by Bishop Bateman of Norwich. He was also one of the monks who served as novice master, to judge from his annotations in treatises concerning the novitiate, the education of monks, and the life and miracles of St Edmund. From an early date Kirkestede was responsible for the abbey's books, an occupation that he continued throughout his life. Bury's library had grown rapidly in the thirteenth century and amounted to approximately 1500 manuscripts by 1338. Kirkestede reorganized the library. He gave each codex an ex-libris, a pressmark (consisting of a letter of the alphabet for the author or subject and an arabic number), and a table of contents. He drew up an inventory of the books, the first since the late twelfth century. The inventory does not survive but there are contemporary references to it. He also rehoused the books, because of the destruction caused by the uprising of 1327.<br>
<br>Kirkestede became prior of Bury in 1361, after the deaths from plague of his predecessor Edmund Brundish and the abbot-elect Henry Hunstanton. He records that, in addition, eighteen monks died of plague in that year alone. He remained prior until some time before 1374. During his tenure he presided over the rebuilding of the great bell-tower which had collapsed in a storm in 1362. He was present at the visitation of the abbey <i>c</i>.1368 by Thomas de la Mare, abbot of St Albans, to inquire into the murder of a monk. Despite his administrative burdens and the difficulties of the times, Kirkestede pursued his interests in the novices and the library. The latest datable note in his hand is an annotation at the death of Gregory XI in 1378.<br>
<br>Kirkestede probably wrote two works, both biobibliographies. He was evidently responsible for the enlargement of the <span class="italic">Speculum coenobitarum</span>, with its list of monastic writers and their works. This compilation represents the earliest known use of the Franciscan <span class="italic">Registrum</span>; it is presumably the treatise on the history of monks and monasticism attributed to Bostonus Buriensis by John Bale.<br>
<br>Kirkestede's main work, the <span class="italic">Catalogus scriptorum ecclesie</span>, compiled for the use of Bury novices, was a substantial bibliography of ecclesiastical writers and their works in the tradition of the patristic <span class="italic">De viris illustribus</span>. The catalogue was assembled from early medieval works of this type by Jerome, Gennadius, and Isidore, from Cassiodorus's <span class="italic">Institutes</span>, from Dominican lists of their writers, and from the mine of biobibliographic information in Vincent of Beauvais's <span class="italic">Speculum historiale</span>. Kirkestede supplied each author with a brief biographical notice and a list of their works. To the lists of titles he added the opening and closing words, most often taken from Bury manuscripts. In addition he absorbed virtually the whole of the early fourteenth-century English Franciscan location list of books known as the <span class="italic">Registrum Anglie de libris doctorum et auctorum veterum</span>, including its system of noting the location of copies of texts by means of arabic numerals which correspond to a numbered list of 189 libraries. He used a manuscript of the <span class="italic">Registrum</span> that is no longer extant. Kirkestede also visited a number of libraries in East Anglia, among them St John's and St Botulph's, Colchester, Ramsey, St Albans, St Benet of Hulme, Holy Trinity, Aldgate, Peterborough, Crowland, and Pipewell. For these and other houses and for Bury itself, the <span class="italic">Catalogus</span> provides a valuable record of their books. Drafts of the biobibliographic entries for Bede, Boethius, Cassian, Chrysostom, Petrus Tripolitanus, and Raoul de Flaix survive in his hand on the flyleaves of Bury manuscripts. Kirkestede's entries for many writers, Englishmen among them, preserve the earliest efforts to compile a list of what that author wrote, forming the origin of a bibliographic tradition that descends to early modern times through Bale and Thomas Tanner. The <span class="italic">Catalogus</span> affords modern scholars a view of the legacy of ancient, patristic, and medieval Latin writing that was known in fourteenth-century East Anglia.<br>
<br>Bale acquired a copy of Kirkestede's manuscript of the <span class="italic">Catalogus</span> from a pensioned Bury monk soon after the dissolution of the abbey, and made extensive extracts from it for his <span class="italic">Scriptorum illustrium maioris Britanniae &hellip; catalogus</span> (Basel, 1557, 1559). Bale created the identity of Bostonus Buriensis from references in the prologue and the colophon in this manuscript. Bale's manuscript passed through James Ussher and Thomas Gale to Tanner before it vanished. It was the source of Tanner's transcript, now CUL, Add. MS 3470. The entries pertaining to English authors were published in 1748 in the preface of Tanner's <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Britannico-Hibernica</span>.<br>
