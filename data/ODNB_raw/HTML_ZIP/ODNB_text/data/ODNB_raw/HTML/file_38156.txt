<span class="headword">Wright <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wesley]</span>,  Mehetabel <span class="st"> [Hetty]</span></span>  (1697&#150;1750), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in Epworth, Lincolnshire, the fifth child and fourth daughter (of ten children who survived early childhood) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29070/', "Samuel Wesley (bap. 1662, d. 1735)")</script>, rector of Epworth and Wroot, and his wife, Susanna Annesley (1669&#150;1742) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66878/', "Wesley, Susanna")</script>]. Her brothers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29069/', "John Wesley")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29067/', "Charles Wesley")</script> founded the Methodist movement; her eldest brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29071/', "Samuel Wesley the younger")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29070/', "Wesley, Samuel (bap. 1662, d. 1735)")</script>] was also an Anglican clergyman and poet. Hetty, as she was known throughout her life, was strikingly intelligent, and was given the same education as her brothers. She was said to be able to read the <span class="roman">Greek Testament</span> at the age of eight.<br>
<br>Hetty grew into a young woman of &#145;mirth, good humour and keen wit. She indulged this disposition so much, that it was said to have given great uneasiness to her parents&#146;  (Clarke, 2.284). By her mid-twenties she had apparently received several offers of marriage; she formed one strong attachment, but her father opposed this match to &#145;an unprincipled lawyer&#146;. In 1725 she eloped on at least two occasions, and eventually returned home several months pregnant. Her despairing parents forced her to marry William Wright, a plumber and glazier of Louth, Lincolnshire, at Haxey, on 13 October 1725. She moved to Louth with her sister Molly as companion. Her husband, doubtless attracted to the marriage by the offer of a dowry to set up his own business, was a good tradesman but &#145;a man utterly unsuited to her in mind, education, manners&#146;  (Clarke, 2.287). Her daughter was born on 18 February 1726, but died in December. Several other children all died in infancy, these deaths attributed by Hetty to the lead works which formed part of her husband's business.<br>
<br>Family disputes continued. In August 1726 Hetty's brother John caused offence in one of his early sermons by criticizing their father's treatment of her. Her attitude to her father remained impenitent, and he spoke of having disowned her. In 1727 she set up a school, but this failed, and in January 1728 Hetty and her husband were settled in London, where he established a successful business in Frith Street, Soho.<br>
<br>By 1729 Hetty had re-established correspondence with her father, and from 1743 she became increasingly influenced by John's religious views. This increased following a visit to friends of the Wesley family at Bristol to recuperate after a serious illness in 1744.<br>
<br>According to Clarke, the family historian, &#145;she had a naturally fine poetic genius, which, though common to the whole family, shone forth in her with peculiar splendour&#146;  (Clarke, 2.285). Hetty's poems display real quality, ranging from memorial verses to acerbic lines on her wretched marriage. She writes movingly on her grief at the death of a child. The poems appeared sporadically in magazines, and were not collected until the nineteenth century. In 1903 her life was recorded in A. T. Quiller-Couch's eponymous historical novel. A visitor recalled Hetty towards the end of her life as &#145;an elegant woman, with great refinement of manners; and had the traces of beauty in her countenance, with the appearances of being broken-hearted&#146;  (Clarke, 2.298). She died on 21 March 1750.<br>
