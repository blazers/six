<span class="headword">Aveling,  Thomas</span>  (1824&#150;1882), <span class="occ">engineer and manufacturer of steamrollers</span>, was born at Elm, near Wisbech, on 11 September 1824, the eldest of three sons. He came from an old-established Cambridgeshire family, but he moved to Rochester in Kent as a boy, when his widowed mother remarried. About 1836 he was apprenticed to a farmer, Edward Lake, whose niece, Sarah Lake (<i>d</i>. 1898), he was to marry. However, his interest in agricultural implements proved to be greater than in other areas of farming and in 1856, with support from his father-in-law, Robert Lake, he bought a small millwrighting business in Rochester. He and his wife had at least one son, <a href="#cosubject_46575">Thomas Lake Aveling [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>Aveling's engineering skills were directed to two main areas of work. The first was the development of a self-moving steam engine for use on the farm and the road. His patented work on driving and steering mechanisms gave him the success that resulted in his being known as the father of the traction engine. The second area in which he was a pioneer was the manufacture of steam road rollers, which he first began to build in 1865. Although he did not originate the idea, he was the first to develop the steamroller into a practical machine.<br>
<br>In 1862 Aveling took as his business partner Richard Thomas Porter, who handled the commercial side of the business, working from an office in London. The expansion of Aveling and Porter brought prominence to Aveling, who served on Rochester borough council until 1871 and as mayor in 1869&#150;70. He was a member of the council of the Royal Agricultural Society of England from 1875 to 1882, a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and the Iron and Steel Institute. One of his recreations was sailing, and it was on a yachting excursion that he caught the chill from which he died on 7 March 1882 at his home, Boley Hill House, Rochester.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_46575"></a><span class="headword">Thomas  Lake Aveling</span>  (1856&#150;1931)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 25 August 1856 at Ruckinge, Kent. From the time he left school he was immersed in the work of his father's engineering firm. Control of Aveling and Porter was handed over to him in 1881, and under his direction the firm expanded until the 1920s. In 1872 about 400 had been employed at the works; in the mid-1890s there were nearly 1000, and at its peak the firm had about 1500 employees. In 1895 the firm was converted into a limited liability company, with capital of &pound;100,000. Thomas Lake Aveling was to serve as chairman and managing director until he retired in 1928. In 1890 Aveling married Rosita Marion Porter (<i>d</i>. 1904), and they had two sons. Among his local interests, he was chairman of the Medway conservancy, a member of the bridgewardens' board of Rochester, and served as a justice of the peace for Kent. He was a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, as well as of the Institution of Civil Engineers. A member of the council of the Smithfield Club, he acted as its president in 1929. He also served on the council of the Royal Agricultural Society of England and was president of the Agricultural Engineers' Association. Other business interests included a directorship of Jesse Ellis Ltd, Maidstone, manufacturers of steam wagons.<br>
<br>Under Aveling's direction, Aveling and Porter concentrated most of its efforts on the production of steamrollers. There was an expanding market, both in Britain and overseas, as roads were being remade to suit modern needs, especially after the advent of motor transport. The success of this policy was that Aveling and Porter met about 70 per cent of the British market for road rollers in the early twentieth century. The firm continued to make various products such as traction engines, ploughing engines, steam wagons, and tramway locomotives, but many others were contracted out. Aveling and Porter threshing machines, for example, were made by Nalder and Nalder of Wantage.<br>
<br>After the First World War, Aveling and Archibald Maconochie, a friend and neighbour in Kent, promoted the formation of Agricultural and General Engineers Ltd. This was a publicly quoted holding company which took over the businesses of Aveling and Porter Ltd, James and Frederick Howard Ltd, and twelve other firms engaged in agricultural and related engineering. The intention was to rationalize the industry through the merger, but this was not fulfilled. The holding company's central overhead costs tended to outweigh savings from the limited amount of integration between the constituent companies. Aveling and Porter's business began to suffer, and by 1928, when Aveling retired, the number of employees had declined and short-time working had been implemented for many of those that remained. Agricultural and General Engineers collapsed in 1932, and in the aftermath Aveling and Porter merged with Barford and Perkins. The new firm, Aveling Barford Ltd, closed the works at Rochester, transferring its operations to Grantham. Thomas Lake Aveling did not live to see the demise of his business. He suffered a heart attack on 5 October 1931, and died that day at his home, Pettings Court, Ash, near Wrotham, Kent.<br>
