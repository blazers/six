<span class="headword">May,  Baptist <span class="st"> [Bab]</span></span>  (<em>bap. </em>1628, <em>d.</em> 1697), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was baptized on 4 November 1628, and was the sixth and youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18420/', "Sir Humphrey May (1572/3&#150;1630)")</script>, privy councillor, and his second wife, Judith (<i>bap</i>. 1598, <i>d</i>. 1661), daughter of Sir William Poley (1562&#150;1629). He took his first name from his uncle, Baptist Hicks, first Viscount Campden. May later told Gilbert Burnet that he had been &#145;bred about the king [Charles II] since he was a child&#146;  (Burnet, 2.465), and by 1648 he was one of the duke of York's pages. It is likely to have been through the influence of his mother's cousin, Henry Jermyn, Lord Jermyn, later earl of St Albans, that he had entered royal service. He was probably back in England in February 1652 when he submitted a petition to the council of state. At the Restoration he and St Albans together obtained the sinecure post of registrar of chancery, and from 1665 he and the poet Abraham Cowley were partners with St Albans in the scheme to develop St James's Square, London. An adjacent street was named Babmaes Mews after him&#151;the use of his nickname in this context having the appearance of a private joke. Between 1662 and 1665 he served as a groom in York's bedchamber.<br>
<br>May is remembered as one of Charles II's most trusted servants. The office of keeper of his privy purse, to which he was appointed on 28 July 1665 on the death of Charles Berkeley, earl of Falmouth, required him to manage the king's private hoard of cash. The key influence behind his appointment seems to have been the royal mistress Barbara Villiers, countess of Castlemaine, who realized that an ally in this office would make the payments due to her his priority. In October 1666 York nominated him as a candidate for Winchelsea, only for the electors to reject him because &#145;they would have no court pimp to be their burgess&#146;  (Pepys, 7.337). A courtier with a talent to amuse rather than to conspire, May had an unfortunate habit of making tactless remarks. A comment by him welcoming the great fire, because it would make the City easier to control, shocked even the king  (<span class="italic">Life of &hellip; Clarendon</span>, 3.101). His alliance with Castlemaine in 1667 against Edward Hyde, earl of Clarendon, was the most public of secret court intrigues. There was in truth little that someone in May's position could do to undermine the lord chancellor except mock him. When Clarendon was brought down in November 1667, Pepys reported that May &#145;fell upon his knees and ketched the king about the legs and joyed him, and said that this was the first time that ever he could call him King of England&#146;  (Pepys, 8.525). Two years later he was one of those who amused the king by ridiculing Henry Bennet, Lord Arlington. The trick failed to work a second time. It was only Castlemaine's support which discouraged Arlington from seeking reprisals against him. For all his privileged access to the king, May showed little skill whenever he attempted to meddle directly in high politics. On being elected MP for Midhurst in 1670, he had plans to promote a bill to allow the king to divorce the queen, but Charles made clear his disapproval as soon as he discovered what May was up to. In 1681 when the king suspended those gentlemen of the bedchamber who persisted in supporting exclusion May came close to being suspended as well. In early 1685 he was involved with Louise Ren&eacute;e de Keroualle, duchess of Portsmouth, and York's other enemies at court in plotting to have the duke sent back to Scotland. They could not have foreseen just how big a miscalculation this would prove to be.<br>
<br>May never enjoyed a monopoly on the king's secret finances. The French pension was paid instead through William Chiffinch, the secret service fund was controlled by the secretary to the Treasury, and Sir Stephen Fox also acted as a conduit for secret payments. The sole surviving set of late seventeenth-century privy purse accounts, which cover the years from 1666 to 1669 and which are known only from a copy transcribed by Edmond Malone (1741&#150;1812), confirm that most of the payments made by May were very mundane  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Malone 44, fols. 100&#150;111). The privy purse may have been most important during the final years of the reign, when Charles used it to channel the surpluses from the Irish revenue to the building of his new palace at Winchester, and when, paradoxically, May was least secure in his favour. That favour was always ambiguous. Burnet thought that May:<blockquote>had the greatest and longest share in the king's secret confidence of any man in that time; for it was never broke off, though often shaken, he being in his notions against every thing that the king was for, both France, popery, and arbitrary government: but a particular sympathy of temper, and his serving the king in his vices, created a confidence much envied, and often attempted to be broke, but never with any success beyond a short coldness. (Burnet, 1.481&#150;2)</blockquote>His real secret was understanding that Charles least wanted to see those who came to him on official business. His favour, like all the other confidential servants, depended on his resisting the temptation to become too obviously involved in the political affairs his master found so tiresome.<br>
<br>In 1685 James II removed May as keeper to make way for James Graham. May was allowed to retain his office as ranger of Windsor Great Park, having held it since May 1671, and he continued to use the Great Lodge (later Cumberland Lodge) as his principal country seat. An attempt to become MP for New Windsor in 1690 (in partnership with Sir Christopher Wren) resulted in a double return, and he had instead to sit for Thetford. He was considered a supporter of the court throughout that parliament. He died on 2 March 1697 and was buried in St George's Chapel, Windsor. He had never married, but his will confirmed that he had had an illegitimate son, Charles, probably with Dorothy Broke of Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk  (will, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/444, fols. 128<i>v</i>&#150;132).<br>
