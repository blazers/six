<span class="headword">Collis,  John Day</span>  (1816&#150;1879), <span class="occ">headmaster and educational writer</span>, son of the Revd Robert Fitzgerald Collis (1790&#150;1863), prebendary of Kilconnell, co. Galway, and his wife, Maria, daughter of Edward Bourke of Nun's Island, Galway, was born on 24 February 1816 at Rathcormack, co. Cork. He was educated at Rugby School from 1832 to 1834 under Thomas Arnold, and entered Merton College, Oxford, as a postmaster in 1834. In 1835 he became Eaton scholar of Worcester College, taking first-class honours in classics in 1838 and proceeding BA in 1838, MA in 1841, and BD and DD in 1860. He gained the Kennicott, and Pusey and Ellerton Hebrew scholarships (1839&#150;41), and was a fellow of his college from 1839 to 1847. On 18 June 1846 he married Josephine Martha (<i>d</i>. 16 Oct 1868), eldest daughter of John Chatfield Tyler, of Kingswood, Gloucestershire.<br>
<br>In December 1842 Collis was nominated headmaster of Bromsgrove School. Through his tireless energy Bromsgrove became one of the leading schools in England; the number of pupils rose from 17 in 1843 to 100 in 1865. A new chapel was built in 1856, and new classrooms were added and the old buildings enlarged and improved at a cost of &pound;5000. He was less effective as a preacher and was an uninspiring teacher; his applications for the headships of Durham (1853) and Rugby (1857) were unsuccessful. By turning Bromsgrove into predominantly a boarding-school, Collis incurred local unpopularity for excluding boys from the town, and some of his policies were strongly criticized in 1865 by James Bryce, one of the assistant commissioners to the schools inquiry commission. He resigned from the headmastership in October 1867 on his appointment to the vicarage of Stratford upon Avon. But his qualities as an educational entrepreneur were again shown by the prosperity of Trinity College School at Stratford, a private venture of which he was both founder (27 January 1872) and first warden. He had earlier married, on 11 October 1871, Elizabeth, daughter of Edward Castleman of Chettle, Dorsetshire, and widow of Rear-Admiral Douglas Curry of Shottery Hall, Stratford upon Avon. A well-known figure in educational circles, he was vice-president of the College of Preceptors and of the Association for the Registration of Schoolmasters. He was a prolific author of classical school textbooks. His <span class="italic">Chief Tenses of Latin Irregular Verbs</span> (1854) and its Greek counterpart both went through thirty-four editions.<br>
<br>Collis was nominated an honorary canon of Worcester Cathedral in 1854, and in 1856 was offered, but declined, the colonial bishopric of Grafton and Armidale. At Bromsgrove he was chairman of the local board and of the poor-law guardians, and took a leading part in local controversies, promoting the restoration of Bromsgrove parish church, which was carried out in 1859 by G. G. Scott. During his incumbency Stratford church was restored and improved, and he completed the formation of the water terrace in the churchyard. Past master and grand chaplain in the Middlesex province of freemasons, Collis was a freeman of the City of London. He died at Shottery Hall, Stratford upon Avon, on 1 April 1879, and was buried at Bromsgrove cemetery on 4 April 1879.<br>
