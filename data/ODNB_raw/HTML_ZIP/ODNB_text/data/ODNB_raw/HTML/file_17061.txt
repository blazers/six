<span class="headword">Lovell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lacy]</span>,  Maria Ann</span>  (1803&#150;1877), <span class="occ">actress and playwright</span>, was born in London on 15 July 1803, the daughter of the younger Willoughby Lacy (<i>d</i>. 1817) and granddaughter of the elder Willoughby Lacy (1749&#150;1831), patentee of Drury Lane and actor. She first appeared on the Belfast stage in 1818 as Mrs Haller, in August von Kotzebue's <span class="italic">The Stranger</span>, and achieved a certain degree of fame as an actress while in Ireland. In 1820 she performed at Glasgow and Edinburgh in conjunction with Edmund Kean and Charles Young. She was later engaged at Covent Garden where, on 9 October 1822, she performed the role of Belvidera, which she followed with the representation of Isabella. Henry Harris, who was the lessee of the theatre, then engaged her for three years. In <span class="italic">Our Actresses</span> Mrs C. Baron states that Maria excelled in pathetic parts. According to the <span class="italic">Theatrical Journal</span>, Maria was &#145;a good actress of secondary standing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Theatrical Journal</span>, 16, 31 Oct 1855), and the <span class="italic">Era Almanack</span> described her as &#145;an esteemed tragic actress&#146;  (<span class="italic">Era Almanack</span>, 1869, 19).<br>
<br>On her marriage in 1830 to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17059/', "George William Lovell (1804&#150;1878)")</script>, playwright, Maria retired from the stage and employed herself in writing plays. Her five-act drama <span class="italic">Ingomar the Barbarian, or, The Son of the Wilderness</span> was adapted from the German and was produced at Drury Lane in June 1851. According to the <span class="italic">Theatrical Journal</span>, the play &#145;was very successful&#146;, owing mostly to the performance of Miss Charlotte Vandenhoff in the character of Parthenia, who &#145;was truly the Greek heroine, nothing more truly Greek in look, and generally in spirit it is possible to conceive&#146;. It was also noted that &#145;At the fall of the curtain the lady authoress curtsied to the audience from a private box&#146;  (<span class="italic">Theatrical Journal</span>, 12, 12 June 1851). In contrast, <span class="italic">The Times</span> complained that the &#145;idea might have been fairly worked out in a couple of acts, with plenty of room for all the graduations in Ingomar's character&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 10 June 1851). The play was staged again in October of the same year at Sadler's Wells with Samuel Phelps taking the title role and Fanny Elizabeth Vining playing Parthenia. According to the <span class="italic">Theatrical Journal</span> the production &#145;attracted a large audience &hellip; although its novelty was forestalled at Drury Lane a few months ago&#146;  (<span class="italic">Theatrical Journal</span>, 12, 29 Oct 1851). The play was also revived in June 1854, December 1867, and at the Victoria Theatre in June 1857. An 1883 staging by the American actress Mary Anderson at the Lyceum in London met with mixed critical response.<br>
<br>Another of Maria's plays, <span class="italic">The Beginning and the End</span>, was a four-act drama first staged at the Haymarket in 1855, but, despite the talents of Charlotte Cushman, William Henry Chippendale, and Henry Howe, the play was a failure. The <span class="italic">Theatrical Journal</span> noted, &#145;It is a drama of the Victorian stamp, the plot hinging on a forged will; and contains neither exciting interest nor well developed character&#146;  (<span class="italic">Theatrical Journal</span>, 16, 31 Oct 1855). <span class="italic">The Times</span> mockingly cited the moral of the play as: &#145;When you burn a will in the kitchen, take care that no one is in the pantry&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 Oct 1855). Maria Lovell died on 2 April 1877 at her home, Grove Lodge, 18 Lyndhurst Road, Hampstead.<br>
