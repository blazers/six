<span class="headword">Morris,  Charles Richard</span>, Baron Morris of Grasmere  (1898&#150;1990), <span class="occ">writer on philosophy and university administrator</span>, was born on 25 January 1898 in Sutton Valence, Kent, the elder child and elder son (the younger was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31470/', "Sir Philip Robert Morris")</script>, educationist) of Meshach Charles Morris, inspector of schools, and his wife, Jane, daughter of James Brasier, of St Cross, Winchester, Hampshire. He was educated at Tonbridge School and at Trinity College, Oxford, where he obtained a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1921). He then became a fellow and tutor in philosophy at Balliol College, Oxford, and held these posts until 1943.<br>
<br>Morris's natural inclination towards an educational career was fostered by his parents and augmented by the general ethos of Balliol under the inspiring mastership of A. D. Lindsay. The horror of the First World War turned that inclination into an absolute commitment to education as the great liberating force beneficial to individuals and society alike. Morris gave this expression in many ways, including by financially supporting his younger sibling's education and by espousing movements to enlarge access to education at all levels at home and abroad.<br>
<br>The first dozen years at Balliol were &#145;paradise&#146;. Morris had able and responsive pupils who admired him for his mastery of the subject and respected him for his remarkable insight into their nature and capability. He wrote three, largely expository, books. The first, <span class="italic">A History of Political Ideas</span> (1924), was written with his wife, Mary. She was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36012/', "Ernest De Selincourt")</script>, professor of English, and his wife, Ethel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Shawcross. They had a long, mutually supportive marriage, based on shared values; the marriage produced a son and a daughter. Her brother introduced him to the Lake District, for which he developed a lasting affection. The other books were <span class="italic">Locke, Berkeley, Hume</span> (1931) and <span class="italic">Idealistic Logic</span> (1933).<br>
<br>The comfortable life of the archetypal Oxford don was challenged in the early 1930s by the vast social tragedy of the depression and the evident threat to democracy posed by the European dictators, especially Adolf Hitler. The Morrises responded privately by assisting refugees and publicly by Morris's becoming an Oxford city councillor (1939&#150;41) and campaigning against the election of a Conservative member in the Oxford parliamentary by-election of 1938, because he deemed inadequate and unacceptable the Conservative government's responses to the dictators' threat to democracy and to evident social injustice in Britain. In this period Morris joined with J. S. Fulton to write <span class="italic">In Defence of Democracy</span> (1935).<br>
<br>In 1939 Morris became a wartime civil servant in the ministries of Supply (until 1942) and Production (1942&#150;3), experiencing at first hand the workings of a command economy and negotiating with counterparts in the USA for the supply of essential war materials. After this he did not return to Oxford but took up the post of headmaster of King Edward's School, Birmingham, to which he had been appointed in 1941. He stayed until 1948, when he became vice-chancellor of the University of Leeds. This brought him and his wife closer to the Lake District, where in 1943 she had inherited a house, gloriously situated above Grasmere, which was to become their real home for the next forty-seven years.<br>
<br>Morris was ideally suited to this vice-chancellorship, for which it seemed all his previous experience had been a preparation. Though he was short of stature, his bright eyes and lively intelligence commanded the affection and respect of colleagues and students. He led the university through post-war austerity and produced a development plan to ensure that Leeds was well placed to take early advantage of the resources which accompanied the government's acceptance of the report of the committee on higher education chaired by Baron Robbins (1961&#150;4). He also foresaw that internal structures of universities must change. He was an influential figure in the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, was its chairman from 1951 to 1955, and was much in demand for service on public bodies in the United Kingdom as diverse as the royal commission on local government in Greater London (1957), the Schools' Broadcasting Council (1954&#150;64), and the advisory committee for the wool textile industry (1952). He made a major contribution to the development of universities overseas through his membership of the Inter-University Council for Higher Education Overseas (1957&#150;64) and of the committee of inquiry into Australian universities (1957), whose definitive report was accepted. Some of these activities continued in retirement, when he also helped the newer universities of Bradford and Lancaster.<br>
<br>Morris was one of Britain's outstanding university administrators and was universally admired for his combination of practicality and total commitment to education. He was knighted in 1953, appointed KCMG in 1963, and made a life peer in 1967. He received eight honorary doctorates. He died, as he would have wished, at Grasmere, on 30 May 1990, two years after his wife's death. There is a portrait of him in the University of Leeds by Robert Buhler.<br>
