<span class="headword">Quillinan,  Edward</span>  (1791&#150;1851), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 12 August 1791 at Porto, Portugal, the son of John Quillinan, wine merchant, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ryan. Both his parents were Irish and his father, of good but impoverished family, had become a prosperous wine merchant in Portugal.<h2>
<a name="Educationarmycareerandfirstpublications"></a>Education, army career, and first publications</h2>Edward was sent to Catholic schools in England: first, unhappily, to Sedgley Park, Staffordshire; second, happily, to a Dominican school at Bornheim House, Carshalton, near London, where he first wrote poems. &#145;Being a catholic, I was unfortunately not sent to either of the universities, which I have ever since lamented&#146;  (Johnston, 6). From 1807 he worked for some months in Porto&#151;not happily&#151;for his father, who by this time had remarried: &#145;I was heartily sick of the counting-house, for my passion was for books very unlike ledgers&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>The French invasion under Junot of Portugal in 1807 forced the family to leave for England, and Quillinan entered the army, becoming a cornet &#145;by purchase in the Queen's Bays&#146; (2nd dragoon guards) stationed at Hastings, then at Canterbury: &#145;the life suited me extremely well, and I had plenty of time to read&#146;  (Johnston, 7). In 1809 he went on the Walcheren expedition, watching with the rest of his regiment the British bombardment of Flushing from boats mustered on the River Scheld. In 1810 he published satirical verses, <span class="italic">The Ball Room Votaries</span> (&#145;two editions in a month&#146;), and the periodical <span class="italic">The Whim</span> (his responsibilities being editorial)&#151;insults led to duels, and a necessity for Quillinan's transfer to another regiment. He first purchased a lieutenancy in the 23rd light dragoons and then exchanged the commission for one in the 3rd dragoon guards, with whom in 1813 he first saw service at St Sebastian in Spain, and was a part of Wellington's pursuit of the enemy from Spain into France. His diary records his march from Toulouse to Calais, from 13 March to 17 July 1814, and contains notes about a proposed novel, ultimately published as <span class="italic">The Conspirators</span> (1841).<br>
<br>In 1814 Quillinan published <span class="italic">Dunluce Castle, a Poem</span>, the first of several of his works to be issued by the private and prestigious Lee Priory Press of Sir Egerton Brydges, who, in the same year (15 December) dedicated his <span class="italic">Occasional Poems</span> (written 1811): &#145;To Edward Quillinan Esq these fugitive poems are dedicated as a sincere but unworthy tribute to his pure genius, his brilliant wit, and noble disposition&#146;. Quillinan was abroad when <span class="italic">Dunluce Castle</span>, an elegant volume with sixty-eight handmade sheets of wove paper, set as large type, well spaced, with only eighteen lines per page, appeared. Quillinan, perhaps through his friendship with his fellow soldier Brydges' elder son, Thomas Brydges Barrett (the last name assumed to inherit the Lee Priory estate from his maternal uncle), came into Brydges' circle in 1813; Brydges had been persuaded in 1813 by John Johnson and John Warwick, formerly compositor and printer, respectively, for Bensley, to set up under his aegis the Lee Priory Press. Colonel Thomas Brydges Barrett provided the premises, Egerton Brydges found the copy, and Johnson and Warwick the equipment and the labour; the press continued until 1823, even though Johnson left in 1817. Typically, the works are printed on cream wove paper, ideal for finely cut engravings; a greyish white Chinese paper was often used for blocks. There were never more than 100 copies of a work printed. Quillinan's contributions continued throughout: <span class="italic">Stanzas by the Author of &#145;Dunluce Castle&#146;</span> (1814) was twenty-six pages of rather more closely spaced text; <span class="italic">Consolation</span> (1815) was a five-page poem addressed to Lady Brydges in memory of her son, Grey Matthew Brydges, who had died in Minorca, a midshipman aged fourteen years and four months. Quillinan published <span class="italic">Elegiac Verses</span> (1817), again addressed to Lady Brydges, on the loss of another child, Edward William George, in 1816. By this date Johnson had left the press, but for Warwick, Quillinan provided verses for the remarkable <span class="italic">Woodcuts and verses</span> (1820) which included all the woodblocks which had been engraved for use at the Lee Priory Press (ninety-eight in all, including forty-one small armorial initials). In his introduction Quillinan commented, with appropriate modesty: &#145;the embellishments in most books are secondary to the printed composition: in this, with very few exceptions, the reverse is the fact&#146;. Quillinan had also printed with other publishers: Longman brought out <span class="italic">Monthermer</span> (1815), a substantial verse romance, and with Bensley <span class="italic">The Sacrifice of Isobel</span> (1816); these two were his most substantial poems to date.<h2>
<a name="MarriageretirementfromthearmyandJemimasillness"></a>Marriage, retirement from the army, and Jemima's illness</h2>In 1817 Quillinan married his first wife, Jemima Anne Deborah Brydges (1793&#150;1822), the second daughter of Sir Egerton. Not for the first or last time, Quillinan involved himself in controversy. In 1819 <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> had published an attack on <span class="italic">Dunluce Castle</span> by Captain Thomas Hamilton, the original Morgan O'Doherty of <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span> who ridiculed the poem in a long review entitled &#145;Poems by a Heavy Dragoon&#146;. In his <span class="italic">Retort Courteous</span> (1821) Quillinan, stationed at Hamilton, Edinburgh, and not knowing the true author of the attack, turned on the editors of <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span>, John Wilson and J. G. Lockhart, coining most of his satire by extracting passages from Lockhart's <span class="italic">Peter's Letters to his Kinsfolk</span> (1819). Ultimately, Quillinan and Captain Hamilton were reconciled by Robert Pearse Gillies, a friend and correspondent of Wordsworth, and it was Gillies who encouraged Quillinan, indeed armed him with a letter of recommendation, to visit Wordsworth at Rydal Mount. Quillinan made three journeys to Rydal, but it was only on the third that he summoned up enough courage to meet the poet; and then he was frigidly received because he had forgotten the letter, and was admitted into friendship only through the intervention of the poet's sister-in-law Sara Hutchinson. In that year, 1821, Quillinan retired from the army:<blockquote>I was settled with poor Jemima &amp; her little baby name-sake at Spring Cottage, Loughrigg. John Reeves &amp; his Wife whom I took with me out of the 3<sup>rd</sup> [Dragoon Guards], he having obtained his discharge, were my groom &amp; cook&#151;the old Irish Nurse and her young assistant Eliza Cooke, with Flora the pet spaniel and my two horses completed my rustic establishment; and never did I pass so happy &amp; satisfactory a summer. De Quinsey [<i>sic</i>], the Opium-Eater, was my nearest neighbour, and lent me his coach-house and stables; but I saw very little of him, for he remained in bed, I understood, all day, and only took the air at night, and then was more shy than an owl.</blockquote>Quillinan's happy manuscript reminiscence does not mention an event recorded in the &#145;Lancaster lunatic asylum admissions and discharge book&#146; for 1816&#150;24 (Lancs. RO), which suggests that the marriage had a difficulty: Jemima, aged twenty-five, of the parish of Ambleside, was admitted on 17 October 1821 and discharged on 13 February 1822: the entry concludes: &#145;Cured&#146;. The diagnosis was &#145;Mania 2<sup>nd</sup> attack&#146;, followed by the mysterious word &#145;Lact&#339;a&#146;. Dorothy Wordsworth records in a letter of 13 June 1822: &#145;She was afflicted with mental derangement after the birth of her last child&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of William and Dorothy Wordsworth</span>, 4.140). The Quillinans by 1822 had moved to Ivy Cottage (now Glen Rothay), not five minutes' walk from Rydal Mount, Wordsworth's home, and it was there, while Quillinan was away on business in London, that his wife, who had been ill, was badly burnt when her dress caught fire. Dorothy Wordsworth nursed her until her death on 25 May 1822, aged twenty-eight, and then arranged the funeral and superintended the nurse and the two motherless children. Wordsworth, godfather of the younger daughter, Rotha (1821&#150;1876), helped Quillinan to write an epigraph that celebrated his wife:<blockquote>
<div>the tender virtues of her blameless life,<br>
</div>
<div>Bright in the daughter, brighter in the wife,<br>
</div>
<div>And in the cheerful mother brightest shone.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>The monument, in Grasmere church, was designed by Chantrey.<br>
<br>Thereafter, Quillinan's life, though based at his London house, 12 Bryanstone Street, Portland Square, or at Lee Priory in Kent, involved travel and writing, and ultimately hopes of marrying Dora Wordsworth. From time to time poems appeared. Some of his elegies to the Brydges family were collected in <span class="italic">Carmina Brugesiana: Domestic Poems</span> (1822). Sir Egerton had been based at Geneva since 1818, and Quillinan, in his grief, visited him there in August 1822. <span class="italic">Shamrock Leaves, or, The Wicklow Excursion</span>, a series of poems celebrating his Irish tour with the Brydges family in 1820, was published by Longman in 1823. In 1829 Quillinan published <span class="italic">The King: the Lay of &#145;a Papist&#146;</span>&#151;on the relation of church and state; interestingly, though always remaining a Roman Catholic, Quillinan brought up his own children in the Church of England, and attended English services. In 1831 Edward Moxon published the first section of <span class="italic">Mischief</span>, influenced by Byron's <span class="italic">Beppo</span> and J. H. Frere's <span class="italic">Monks and Giants</span> (1818), but written in Spenserian stanzas; its light tone is more social amusement than true satire. A second section was published in 1834 with a preface defending himself from the charge of plagiarism from Byron; Wordsworth commented to Quillinan: &#145;It is written with great spirit and a variety of talent which does the author no small credit&#146;  (11 June 1834, <span class="italic">Letters of William and Dorothy Wordsworth</span>, 5.719). Perhaps Wordsworth's most positive comment on Quillinan came on 20 September 1837:<blockquote>it is in your power to attain a permanent place among the poets of England, your thoughts, feelings, knowledge, and judgement in style, and skill in metre entitle you to it; if you have not yet succeeded in gaining it the cause appears to me merely to lie in the subjects wh. you have chosen. (ibid., 6.464)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="MarriagetoDoraWordsworth"></a>Marriage to Dora Wordsworth</h2>Quillinan was becoming more than a Wordsworth family friend. The relationship was built on a mutual concern for Quillinan's two daughters. Wordsworth, however, from 1837, when the matter was raised, refused to encourage Quillinan in his hopes of marrying <a href="#cosubject_22955">Dora [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Wordsworth's reluctance was neither on the grounds of Quillinan's religion, nor a simple unwillingness to let Dora marry.<br>
<br>Quillinan was entangled in the disastrous financial affairs of his brother-in-law and friend, Colonel Thomas Brydges Barrett, and his father-in-law, Sir Egerton Brydges; trust monies had been mishandled, and the colonel was ruined and died in a fisherman's hut at Boulogne in July 1834; Anthony, a younger son, was thrown in a debtors' prison, from which he was to be discharged only as a lunatic. Quillinan was not finally acquitted of fraud until March 1842, almost a year after he had married Dora on 11 May 1841, at St James's Church, Bath, in the presence of her mother, her two brothers, John, who performed the service, and William, who gave her away, and Quillinan's half-brother John Thomas. Wordsworth, like his sister in 1802 at his own marriage, was too overcome to attend. Quillinan wrote to his daughter: &#145;we all, Miss F[enwick] &amp; Mrs W[ordsworth] &amp; Dora herself seeing how much he was moved, requested him <i>not</i> to come; for we had all we wanted from him in the kind &amp; amiable manner in which he had behaved towards us&#146;  (MS, Wordsworth Library). The Wordsworths were visiting Isabella Fenwick at Bath, and it was she who had persuaded the poet to set aside his objection that Quillinan had no fortune. John Thomas, who had successfully maintained their father's business in Porto, gave him some support; according to Crabb Robinson, Quillinan was indeed to be completely dependent on Dora in financial matters. The whole party then went on a visit to Somerset, where Wordsworth and Coleridge had, famously, written <span class="italic">Lyrical Ballads</span> (1798).<h2>
<a name="Laterwritingsandfinalyears"></a>Later writings and final years</h2>Quillinan continued to publish. His three-volume novel <span class="italic">The Conspirators</span> (1841), a series of tales centring on Philadelphian plots against Napoleon, based on his military services in Spain and Portugal, received some praise from reviewers. He wrote a rhymed defence against the attack on Wordsworth in Walter Savage Landor's &#145;Imaginary conversation&#146; between Porson and Southey (<span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>, April 1843). Landor mockingly responded by speaking of Quillinan's writings as &#145;Quill-inanities&#146;, though Quillinan claimed that he himself had given the pun to Landor some thirty years before in Bath. Wordsworth, again, was not impressed and thought the defence indiscreet. Quillinan proved an assiduous husband, and the couple were at their happiest in 1843 and 1844 when they spent their summers on Belle Isle in Windermere, the &#145;Borow-Me-An Island&#146;, as Wordsworth punned, borrowed from the Curwens, but Dora's health grew worse, and, writing and sketching, they travelled in search of health, wandering through Portugal and Spain in 1845&#150;6. On their return via Marseilles and Paris, they moved into a newly built section of Loughrigg Holme, thus sharing the property with John Carter, Wordsworth's man of business. In her final illness, Dora returned to Rydal Mount and died there on 9 July 1847. Wordsworth felt he could not visit Quillinan's house after Dora's death: &#145;I cannot bear to cross the Bridge and Field that leads to his Abode&#146;, Wordsworth wrote to Isabella Fenwick on 6 December 1847, &#145;and he does not come hither&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of William and Dorothy Wordsworth</span>, 7.859). Both men, though courteous, were essentially fixed into separate grief. William Johnston does record walking with Quillinan and Wordsworth in the autumn of 1849, with Wordsworth's thoughts that they would not meet again. On 2 January 1850 Wordsworth did visit the other guests, including Matthew Arnold and his bride, but in his depression declared the prospect &#145;a trial which I feel that I am unable to bear as with due submission to God's Will I ought to do. May He have mercy upon me, and upon the Mother of Her whom we have lost&#146;  (ibid., 7.914).<br>
<br>Even so Quillinan continued to write and translate to the last. Importantly, before Dora's death, it was Quillinan who drafted Wordsworth's one laureate ode, &#145;Ode on the Installation of His Royal Highness Prince Albert as Chancellor of the University of Cambridge&#146;, of 6 July 1847 (two imprints, Cambridge, University Press, 1847, and London, George Bell, undated):<blockquote>the plan and composition of this ode was chiefly prepared by Mr. Quillinan, but carefully revised in MS. by Mr. Wordsworth, who, being in a state of deep domestic affliction, could not otherwise have been able to fulfil the engagement with Prince Albert. (MS note by Mary Wordsworth)</blockquote>Wordsworth had expressed to Miss Fenwick on 19 September 1844 his mortification that Quillinan did so little &#145;because his talents are greatly superior to those of most men who earn a handsome livelihood by Literature&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of William and Dorothy Wordsworth</span>, 7.597). Wordsworth was perhaps unfair. In 1845 Quillinan contributed to the first volume of <span class="italic">The Edinburgh Tales</span> his fiction &#145;The Rangers of Connaught&#146;; in 1846 he wrote for <span class="italic">Tait's Magazine</span> &#145;The Bell: Adventures at a Portuguese Watering-Place&#146; (about Porto); and again in 1846 <span class="italic">The Quarterly</span> published Quillinan's article on Gil Vicente, the Portuguese dramatic poet (Wordsworth read the proof and told J. G. Lockhart: &#145;It is well done and I think it will be a pleasing variety in the <span class="roman">Quarterly</span>&#146;  (ibid., 7.817)). His latest literary activity involved his beginning a translation in <i>ottava rima</i> of the first half (or five cantos) of Camoens's <span class="italic">Lusiad</span>, published posthumously in 1853 by John Adamson, another and admiring translator of Camoens; and he also began a translation (unpublished) of Herculano's history of Portugal.<br>
<br>Edward Quillinan died at Rydal on 8 July 1851 after a cold caught when fishing. He was buried at Grasmere.<br>
<br>A memoir by his friend William Johnston was published by Moxon in 1853 with a selection of Quillinan's poems. Johnston rather suppressed Quillinan's social and humorous verses; some of his lyrics are gently sentimental; his letters and diaries supplement an understanding of the literary circle of which he was a part. Matthew Arnold's epitaph of 27 December 1851, &#145;Stanzas in Memory of Edward Quillinan&#146;, speaks of him as &#145;a man unspoil'd, Sweet, generous, and humane&#146;. Quillinan's friend Johnston, however, twice suggested that Quillinan could be irritable. In his obituary of Quillinan  (<span class="italic">Inverness Courier</span>, 21 April 1853) he quotes an exchange of letters between them in which Johnston suggests that &#145;small men were more irritable than those of larger growth&#146;, and Quillinan, in denying it, confirms he was indeed small: &#145;taller, physically speaking than Tom Moore, and not so tall as Tom Campbell: consequently he is no giant&#146;. In his memoir Johnston quotes John Carter:<blockquote>Mrs Wordsworth was much attached to him, and indeed he was a favourite with everyone who knew him, and his society was much courted by every one in this neighbourhood. Probably his failing was an excitability and restlessness which indicated that Irish blood was in his veins. But I believe, upon the whole, that a more noble, generous, and high-minded creature never breathed. (Johnston, 32)</blockquote>
<a name="cosubject_22955"></a><span class="headword">Dorothy <span class="st"> [Dora]</span> Quillinan</span>  (1804&#150;1847), <span class="occ">writer</span>, the second child of William Wordsworth and Mary Hutchinson, was born on 16 August 1804 at Dove Cottage, Grasmere. She was educated primarily at home and at Miss Dowling's boarding-school at Ambleside, 2 miles from home. She had a gift for friendship and this is revealed in her correspondence: her letters to the Crumps, the Cooksons, to the daughters of Southey and Coleridge, to Mary Stanger, to Maria Jane Jewsbury, and to her own family are lively. Wordsworth celebrated Dora, along with Edith Southey and Sara Coleridge, in his poem &#145;The Triad&#146;, first drafted in 1817. Dora acted as amanuensis for her father, and often travelled with him: in 1828 (21 June&#150;5 August) they travelled with Coleridge into Germany, Dora keeping a journal; in 1831 they visited Walter Scott for the last time; in 1838 they travelled to Northumberland and Durham, when Wordsworth received an honorary degree from Durham University. In 1841 she married Edward Quillinan after surmounting several years of her father's disapproval. In search of health for Dora, the Quillinans travelled in Portugal and Spain. Her one book, published just before her death on 9 July 1847, was dedicated to her parents: <span class="italic">A Journal of a Few Months Residence in Portugal, and Glimpses of the South of Spain</span> (2 vols., 1847). It received a complimentary review in <span class="italic">The Quarterly</span>. &#145;It comes too late to give pleasure&#146;, wrote Crabb Robinson. Her letters are numerous, and can give valuable insight into the life of her father and their whole circle. Dora was skilful in her pencil drawings and small watercolours (in the manner of Amos Green), and numbers of these (together with a few by Quillinan) survive in the Wordsworth Library, Grasmere. She had a central place in her parents' affections, but was often in ill health, and ultimately died of tuberculosis. Her death was catastrophic to Wordsworth's last years. When he died, Quillinan wrote to Sara, Coleridge's daughter, &#145;He has, no doubt, now a higher reward: he is gone to Dora&#146;  (MS, Wordsworth Library).<br>
