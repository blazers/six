<span class="headword">Stevenson,  William Fleming</span>  (1832&#150;1886), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland</span>, the youngest child of William Stevenson, a merchant in Strabane, co. Tyrone, and Margaret Anne, daughter of Samuel Morton, was born at Strabane on 20 September 1832. After being taught for some time by a private tutor he was sent in 1844 to the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, where he remained until he entered the University of Glasgow in 1848. He graduated MA in 1851, and commenced the study of theology at New College, Edinburgh. In 1854, his course completed, he went to Germany, where he studied for some time at the universities of Berlin and Heidelberg, and made his first acquaintance with those forms of home-mission work and Christian activity which he later described in <span class="italic">Praying and Working</span> (1862). In 1856 he was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Strabane, and in the autumn of 1857 became a town missionary in Belfast, where a virulent attack of typhus, caught in the discharge of his duties, almost cost him his life. After holding two temporary appointments, one as locum tenens in Bonn for William Graham DD (1810&#150;1883) in 1858, and the other as assistant to the Revd D. McKee in Belfast in 1859, he was ordained on 1 March 1860 as minister of a newly established Presbyterian congregation at Rathgar, a suburb of Dublin. Two years later a new church there, built largely through Stevenson's efforts, was opened. The services became so popular that the building was soon filled, and was twice enlarged. On 1 June 1865 he married Elizabeth Montgomery, eldest daughter of John Sinclair of Belfast. They had two sons, one of whom became a missionary to India, and three daughters.<br>
<br>Stevenson's literary activity started in 1855 when he began writing in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Christian Instructor</span>, then edited by Dr Norman Macleod. He contributed to <span class="italic">Good Words</span> from its beginning. <span class="italic">Praying and Working</span>, which first appeared in its early numbers, was published separately in 1862 and became one of his most popular works. In 1873 he published a large selection of <span class="italic">Hymns for the Church and Home</span>, which had a wide circulation.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in 1871, Stevenson's deep interest in foreign missions caused him to be appointed colleague to the Revd James Morgan in the honorary convenership of the Irish general assembly's foreign mission. On Morgan's death in 1873 he became sole convener. Much of his time and thought was devoted to this enterprise. As an auxiliary to it he founded a zenana mission. In 1877, accompanied by his wife, and at the request of the general assembly, he made a journey round the world, visiting mission stations, especially in China and India. In 1879&#150;80 he held the chair of evangelistic theology in New College, Edinburgh, and from 1882 until 1886 he was Duff lecturer on foreign missions. A series of lectures which he delivered in this last capacity was published posthumously in 1887, under the title <span class="italic">The Dawn of the Modern Mission</span>. In 1881 he was elected to the lectureship founded in Londonderry in memory of Richard Smyth, and lectured on his favourite theme, &#145;The history and methods of Christian missions&#146;.<br>
<br>Many other public duties devolved upon Stevenson. In 1879 he was appointed by the crown one of the first senators of the newly established Royal University of Ireland. In 1881 he was elected moderator of the general assembly, and received the honorary degree of DD from the University of Edinburgh. And in 1886 he became the first Presbyterian clergyman to be appointed chaplain to the lord lieutenant of Ireland (the earl of Aberdeen). He died suddenly at his home at Orwell Bank, Rathgar, co. Dublin, on 16 September 1886. He was buried in Mount Jerome cemetery, Dublin, on 27 September 1886. The Fleming Stevenson Missionary Training College was established in his memory at Ahmadabad, and his library of 6000 volumes, which became known as the Stevenson Memorial Library, was presented to the Assembly's College (now Union Theological College), Belfast.<br>
