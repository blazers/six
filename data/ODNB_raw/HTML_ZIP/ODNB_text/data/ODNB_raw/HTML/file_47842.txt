<span class="headword">Johnson,  Ralph</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1629, <em>d.</em> 1695), <span class="occ">naturalist</span>, was born at Earby near Newsham, Richmondshire, North Riding of Yorkshire, and baptized on 15 November 1629. He was one of four sons of William Johnson (1600?&#150;1677?), husbandman. In 1652 he married Anne (1623&#150;1695), daughter of Henry Pinkney of East Hope; they had five children, of whom the three sons died young. Johnson attended Sedbergh School, and then St John's College, Cambridge, from 1648 to 1652. From 1652 until 1656 he was master of Darlington grammar school. He was presented to the vicarage of Brignall, very near his birth place, on 6 December 1656, and ordained on 8 August 1661. He remained the resident incumbent for the rest of his life. He was styled MA in his lifetime but it is not known if he was ever given this degree.<br>
<br>In his younger days Johnson had an ideal botanical mentor in Walter Stonehouse, rector of Darfield in south Yorkshire. Stonehouse had helped with the production of the first British flora, Thomas Johnson's <span class="italic">Mercurius botanicus</span> (1634 and 1641). He also knew both John Tradescants, elder and younger, and many of the plants in his herbarium came from the Tradescants' famous garden in south Lambeth, Surrey.<br>
<br>John Ray who was a &#145;great friend&#146; of Johnson's  (Ray, <span class="italic">Synopsis</span>, preface), described him as &#145;a Person of singular skill in Zoology, especially the History of Birds, who communicated to us [at my request] his Method of Birds &hellip; his judgement concurring with ours in the divisions and characteristic notes of the Genera&#146;  (Willughby and Ray, <span class="italic">Ornithology</span>, preface). Johnson made a significant contribution to <span class="italic">Ornithology</span> by Willughby and Ray, which marks the start of scientific ornithology. Ray also described Johnson as &#145;a man most expert &hellip; in all branches of Natural History&#146;  (Willughby and Ray, <span class="italic">Piscium</span>, preface).<br>
<br>Johnson suggested to Ray that in the next edition of his <span class="italic">Catalogus plantarum Angliae</span> (1670) he should arrange the plants in natural rather than alphabetical order  (Ray, <span class="italic">Synopsis</span>, preface). Ray taught Johnson scientific botany, at Brignall, and Johnson became the pioneer botanist of upper Teesdale. Johnson died on 7 May 1695 at Brignall, probably of gout; he had survived his wife by only eighteen days. He was buried two days later in the graveyard of his church, St Mary's, which is now in ruins.<br>
