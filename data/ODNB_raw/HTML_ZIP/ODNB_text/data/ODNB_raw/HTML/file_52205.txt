<span class="headword">Kenyon,  Lloyd  Tyrell-</span>, fifth Baron Kenyon  (1917&#150;1993), <span class="occ">museum administrator and book collector</span>, was born on 13 September 1917 at 17 Manchester Street, Marylebone, London, the only son of Lloyd Tyrell-Kenyon, fourth Baron Kenyon (1864&#150;1927), a lord-in-waiting to Queen Victoria, Edward VII, and George V, and his wife, Gwladys Julia (1884&#150;1965), the only daughter of Colonel Henry Lloyd Howard, of Wigfair, Denbighshire. He had a twin sister. He succeeded to his father's peerage at the age of ten and was educated at Eton College and Magdalene College, Cambridge. After taking his degree Lord Kenyon's interest in the visual arts led to his appointment as an honorary attach&eacute; at the Fitzwilliam Museum, where Louis Clarke had just become director. He joined the Shropshire yeomanry in 1937 and served in the Second World War in the Royal Artillery (Territorial Army) until he was invalided out in 1943 on account of his poor eyesight.<br>
<br>After the war Kenyon married, on 3 June 1946, Leila Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cookson (<i>b</i>. 1923), the widow of Lieutenant Hugh Peel of the Welsh Guards; the couple had three sons (one of whom died in the same year as his father) and a daughter. The subsequent pattern of Kenyon's life was set in these post-war years. Motivated by a strong sense of public duty and skilled at leading on a loose rein, he served on Flint county council for ten years, becoming chairman in 1954&#150;5, was president of the University of North Wales at Bangor from 1947 to 1982 (a post his father had held before him), chief commissioner for the Wales Boy Scouts Association from 1948 to 1966 (his mother had been a friend of the Baden-Powells), and a deputy lieutenant for Flint from 1948. He had boundless zest for the constant travelling involved in these duties, but he also found time to look after his own properties and manage his 10,000 acre estate. He was the first farmer to import Charollais cattle into Britain; and he was a keen gardener and plantsman, personally labelling every species in his borders with meticulous care. Unsentimental about what he owned, he had the once fine and elaborately timbered mansion of Kenyon Peel Hall&#151;which had begun to fall apart after coal extraction in the area had undermined it structurally&#151;pulled down in the 1950s, and Gredington itself, impractically large, he also demolished to be replaced by smaller family houses. He then lived himself in nearby Cumbers House, an attractive late-Victorian red-brick house.<br>
<br>From 1958 Kenyon was closely involved with the Welsh hospital service. He was a member of the Welsh Regional Hospital Board from 1958 to 1963 and of the Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine from 1961 to 1965, and chairman of the Wrexham, Powys, and Mawddach hospital management committee from 1960 to 1974 and of the Clwyd Area Health Authority from 1974 to 1978. He was also a director of Lloyds Bank from 1962 to 1988 and chairman of its north-west board. But closest to his heart was the world of art and books. At the age of thirty-five he was appointed president of the National Museum of Wales (he had been vice-president since 1947), serving for five years from 1952 to 1957. In the following year he began a seven-year term as a member of the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries and became a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery, where he remained on the board for five consecutive terms, succeeding Sir Geoffrey Keynes as chairman in 1966 and relinquishing this position only in 1988, when he was finding it increasingly difficult to read.<br>
<br>Kenyon was in his element with historical portraits; he never tired of consulting and quoting from the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. As chairman he trusted and supported successive directors and their staff; he always found time to talk and encourage, and if, very rarely, reproof were needed, it might happen over dinner at Brooks's. Crisply but meticulously conducted trustees' meetings were preceded by lunch at the Beefsteak and ended in good time for catching the train at Euston. The most important issues in his time were expansion of the gallery's confined building of 1896 adjoining the National Gallery and the provision of outstations in the regions&#151;chiefly in collaboration with the National Trust&#151;to allow significant parts of the collection to be shown outside London. Kenyon was always prepared to lobby ministers, but he disliked fund-raising, except for important purchases such as the portraits of Handel and Sterne, and the first stage of expansion (1993) did not happen until after his retirement. He did, however, initiate and use his personal authority and his proximity to carry through, with characteristic and tireless energy, a highly successful Victorian outstation as part of Clwyd county council's cultural development at Bodelwyddan Castle in north Wales, opened in 1988. It was perhaps his most remarkable single achievement.<br>
<br>Kenyon's appreciation of the unique significance of the gallery's historic archive and his wise encouragement of research reflected his deep love of books. He helped to relaunch the celebrated Gregynog Press in 1978, and was a passionate collector chiefly of early English liturgical books. His elegant handwriting was that of a calligrapher. Kenyon was a member of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts from 1966 to 1992 and chairman of the friends of the national libraries from 1962 to 1985. His knowledge of rare books was always at the service of others, and it was one of the greatest sadnesses of his life that in his later years he had to sell a large part of his collection.<br>
<br>Kenyon never sought to move in London society, and did not attend the House of Lords. He rarely travelled outside England and Wales except for occasional holidays in the sun and a visit to the United States for the centenary of Kenyon College, Ohio. Although his commitments took him frequently to London, where he greatly enjoyed club life and its rituals and his visits to the bookseller Heywood Hill, he was essentially a man of the shires. In his younger days he enjoyed country pursuits, especially hare-coursing, and for many years he was secretary of Altcar Racing Club. Later he owned one racehorse, Rupertino, but although the Peel estate, which adjoined his own and of which he was a senior trustee, included Bangor-on-Dee (Bangor Is-coed) racecourse, he was not at heart a racing man. Kenyon was sociable and hospitable, and infinitely generous. He bore his troubles and infirmities without complaining and never lost his quiet good humour. He was an old-fashioned aristocrat in his self-confident bearing and affability, his way of life, and his devotion to public service. But he was distinctive, too, in his pebble glasses, bow-tie, light fawn topcoat worn even in extreme weathers, and cultural interests. He was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and was appointed CBE in 1972. He died at Cumbers House, Gredington, Shropshire, on 16 May 1993, from lung cancer.<br>
