<span class="headword">Throgmorton,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1445), <span class="occ">landowner and administrator</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63914/', "Thomas Throgmorton (d. 1411)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52798/', "Throgmorton family")</script>] of Fladbury, Worcestershire, and Agnes (<i>d</i>. after 1428), daughter and coheir of Alexander Besford of Besford, Worcestershire. His father had served Thomas Beauchamp, earl of Warwick (<i>d</i>. 1401), as had his Besford grandfather, and it is probable that it was through this connection that in 1409 John was married to Eleanor, daughter and coheir of Guy Spine of Coughton, west Warwickshire, a marriage that considerably enhanced his landed position and brought him lands in Warwickshire. However, after a training in the law, Throgmorton's first employer was Sir John Phelip of Kidderminster. Phelip having died at Harfleur in 1415, Throgmorton was serving Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick (<i>d</i>. 1439), by late 1416. The tie with Warwick was close: Throgmorton was a life retainer and councillor, especially important to Warwick when the earl was overseas, was often in his household, and travelled extensively on his behalf, at least twice to France. He was a key member of the Warwick-dominated gentry network in west Warwickshire and Worcestershire, acting on numerous occasions as feoffee and witness, often with other followers of the earl. As a lawyer connected to the most powerful local nobleman he was a frequent local officer, notably in Worcestershire. His offices there included JP from 1414 until his death, MP in 1414, 1420, 1422, 1432, 1433, and 1439, escheator in 1418&#150;19, and under-sheriff&#151;an office held under the Beauchamps, hereditary sheriffs&#151;in 1416&#150;18, 1419&#150;20, and 1430&#150;31. He played little role in Warwickshire local government until the 1430s, when he was JP from 1433 until 1439, and Worcestershire remained the family's principal sphere of interest until the 1470s.<br>
<br>It was through the earl of Warwick that Throgmorton entered the king's service; he held the Beauchamp chamberlainship of the exchequer from 1418 to his death, and was under-treasurer from 1433 to 1443. Various royal grants followed, including custody of the temporalities of the see of Worcester in 1433, which he shared with some of his Worcestershire friends. The office of under-treasurer brought him into close association with Ralph, Lord Cromwell (<i>d</i>. 1456), the treasurer, and, from at least the early 1420s, he was associated with the lords Ferrers of Chartley, a family of growing importance to Warwick in midlands politics at that time. His various employments brought him the wealth and connections to acquire extensive further property in Warwickshire and Worcestershire, as well as a better title from the bishops of Worcester to the family estate in Fladbury.<br>
<br>Throgmorton was named as an executor of Warwick's will and, after Warwick's death in 1439, was made keeper of the lands of Henry Beauchamp (<i>d</i>. 1446), the earl's under-age heir, and feoffee to Isabel, Warwick's widow. Among his fellow feoffees was Ralph Boteler, Lord Sudeley (<i>d</i>. 1473), a rising power at court, who became Throgmorton's last patron and, with his close associate, John, Lord Beauchamp of Powick, the patron of several other men formerly associated with the earls of Warwick. In Throgmorton's will Sudeley was named as overseer, &#145;for grete affians and trust &thorn;t I haue hadde in his Lordeship&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/3, fol. 248<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Throgmorton died on 12 April 1445, asking that restitution be made to all those he had harmed in his career. At his death he had two sons and six married daughters, his sons-in-law nearly all from prominent midland gentry families, some from within the Warwick connection. He was buried at Fladbury, where he requested a marble stone to dignify the graves of his parents, as well as those of himself and his wife. In 1448 his widow was licensed to found a chantry there, which was eventually established in 1460. In reflection of the family's connection with the crown at both dates, it commemorates Throgmorton's service to Lancaster rather than to Warwick. Throgmorton's widow died some time after May 1449.<br>
