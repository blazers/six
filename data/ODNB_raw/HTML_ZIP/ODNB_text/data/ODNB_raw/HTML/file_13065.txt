<span class="headword">Herbison,  David</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em> the Bard of Dunclug]</span>  (1800&#150;1880), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 14 October 1800 at Mill Street, Ballymena, co. Antrim, the fourth child of William Herbison (<i>d</i>. 1825), an innkeeper, and his wife, Elizabeth Wilson. At the age of three, following an attack of smallpox, he lost his sight. For four years he remained totally blind, but regained the sight in one eye after medical treatment. His education was adversely affected by his weak eyesight and poor health. He attended school for barely two years, and considered himself to be self-educated. In 1810 his father gave up his inn and moved to a small farm at Laymore, Ballymena. At the age of fourteen David Herbison was apprenticed to the loom, and began a lifelong association with linen weaving.<br>
<br>Herbison's father died in 1825. Seeking to improve their prospects, he and an elder brother decided to emigrate to Canada, and sailed from Belfast on 5 April 1827. However, the vessel foundered and sank in the St Lawrence. Although they were rescued, his brother's wife was among the many who drowned. The shock of this experience, together with an unfamiliar climate, made it difficult for him to settle in Quebec. After a few weeks he decided to return to Ballymena, and resumed his occupation as a weaver. In 1830 he married Margaret Archbold (1805&#150;1881), the daughter of a neighbouring farmer, and he and his family lived in their weaver's cottage at Dunclug, near Ballymena, until his death.<br>
<br>From an early age Herbison had a love of books and an affinity for poetry. With his first wages he walked to Belfast to buy a copy of Ramsay's poems, and the next year repeated the journey to acquire the works of Burns. Like many Ulster Presbyterians he looked to Scotland for cultural and literary models, since the two regions shared a similar religious and linguistic heritage. His first published poem appeared in the <span class="italic">Northern Whig</span> in 1830, and he became a regular contributor to local newspapers and periodicals. His first collection, <span class="italic">The Fate of M'Quillan and O'Neill's Daughter</span>, appeared in 1841 and was favourably reviewed. He published four more volumes during his lifetime: <span class="italic">Midnight Musings</span> (1848), <span class="italic">Woodland Wanderings</span> (1858), <span class="italic">The Snow-Wreath</span> (1869), and <span class="italic">The Children of the Year</span> (1876). A posthumous collected edition of his works was published in 1883.<br>
<br>Herbison wrote in his vernacular Ulster Scots as well as in standard English. Prejudice against dialect increasingly constrained him to abandon Ulster Scots, and this deprived him of his most distinctive voice. He was one of the last of a group of rural bards known as the Rhyming Weavers, and exchanged poetical epistles with Thomas Beggs of Ballyclare, James McKowen of Lambeg, and Robert Huddleston of Moneyreagh. Herbison was acclaimed by his fellow poets as the Bard of Dunclug. His work provides a valuable commentary on the decline of hand-loom weaving and its transformation from rural craft to factory-based industry, with the consequent emigration and urbanization. Poems such as &#145;The Auld Wife's Lament for her Teapot&#146;  (Herbison, <span class="italic">Select Works</span>, 45) and &#145;My Ain Native Toun&#146;  (ibid., 305&#150;8) record this social and cultural change. Of all the rural bards, Herbison came closest to establishing a wider literary reputation. As the Bard of Dunclug, he became a minor literary celebrity. He corresponded with Sir Samuel Ferguson, contributed to periodicals in Dublin, Edinburgh, and London, as well as Belfast, and had a considerable readership in Canada and South Carolina. His literary success enabled him to survive the effects of the Irish potato famine and industrialization. He became an agent for a firm of Belfast linen merchants. Yet he retained an attachment to radical causes, supporting electoral reform and tenant rights.<br>
<br>Herbison died on 26 May 1880 at Dunclug, and was buried on 28 May in the new cemetery, Cushendall Road, Ballymena, where in 1881 a monument was erected to his memory by public subscription.<br>
