<span class="headword">Palmer, Sir  Arthur Power</span>  (1840&#150;1904), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 25 June 1840 at Kurubul, India, the son of Captain Nicholas Power Palmer of the 54th Bengal native infantry, and his wife, Rebecca Carter, daughter of Charles Barrett of Dungarvan, co. Waterford. His father was killed on the retreat from Kabul in 1841, and in 1849 his mother married as her second husband Morgan Crofton, son of Captain Morgan Crofton RN, of co. Roscommon. Educated at Cheltenham College (1852&#150;6), Palmer entered the Indian army on 20 February 1857 as ensign in the 5th Bengal native infantry. He served throughout the uprisings of 1857&#150;9, raising a regiment of Sikhs 600 strong for service in Oudh in March 1858. He received his commission as lieutenant on 30 April 1858, and joined Hodson's horse at Lucknow in the following June. At the actions of Nawabganj and Bara Banki his horse was killed under him, and he was present at minor actions (during one of which he was wounded) in the Oudh campaign until its conclusion on the Nepal frontier, and was mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>In 1861 Palmer was transferred to the Bengal staff corps, and served in the campaign on the north-west frontier in 1863&#150;4, being present in the action with the Mohmands near Shabkadar. He served as adjutant to the 10th Bengal lancers in the Abyssinian expedition of 1868, and his services were favourably noticed by Napier. He had married, in 1867, Helen Aylmer (<i>d</i>. 1896), daughter of Aylmer Harris; his second wife, whom he married in 1898, was Constance Gabrielle Richardson (<i>d</i>. 1912), daughter of Godfrey Shaw and widow of Walter Milton Roberts.<br>
<br>Palmer acted as aide-de-camp to General Stafford in the Duffla expedition of 1874&#150;5, and was mentioned in dispatches. In 1876&#150;7 he was on special duty with the Dutch troops in Achin, and fought in several actions in the Dutch war against native forces. He was mentioned in dispatches and received the Dutch cross with two clasps from the Netherlands government. He had been promoted captain in 1869, and served in the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878&#150;80), when he acted as assistant adjutant and quartermaster-general to the Kurram field force. In the attack on the Paiwar Pass (2 December 1878) Palmer rendered good service by making a feint on the right of the Afghan position, and in January 1879 he accompanied the expedition into the Khost valley. He was mentioned in dispatches, and was given the brevet of lieutenant-colonel on 12 November 1879. From 1880 to 1885 he was assistant adjutant-general in Bengal, becoming colonel in 1883. Two years later he took part as commander of the 9th Bengal cavalry in the expedition to Suakin, and showed great dash and energy throughout the campaign. For his share in the raid on Thakul (6 May 1885) he was mentioned in dispatches. He was made a CB on 25 August 1885.<br>
<br>During the campaign in Burma in 1892&#150;3 Palmer commanded the force operating in the northern Chin hills. He received the thanks of the government of India, was mentioned in dispatches and government orders, and on 8 May 1894 was made KCB. He became major-general in 1893 and lieutenant-general in 1897. In 1897&#150;8 he served in the Tirah campaign as general officer on the line of communications, and subsequently commanded the 2nd division at the action of Chagru Kotal. He commanded the Punjab frontier force from 1898 to 1900, being promoted general in 1899. On the death of Sir William Lockhart, he was appointed provisional commander-in-chief in India, and member of the executive council (19 March 1900).<br>
<br>In selecting regiments and commanders for service in South Africa and China in 1900 Palmer showed high administrative capacity, but the provisional nature of his appointment, and a somewhat accommodating character, hardly equipped him to deal with as masterful a viceroy as Curzon. According to his adjutant-general, Smith-Dorrien, Curzon &#145;snubbed him on every possible occasion&#146;, and &#145;the tone of the minutes on his recommendations was hurtful and trying&#146;  (Mason, 395). Palmer was succeeded by Kitchener in 1902. He was made GCIE in 1901, and GCB in 1903. He died at his home, 15 Buckingham Palace Gardens, Westminster, on 28 February 1904, after an operation for appendicitis, and was buried in Brompton cemetery. He was survived by his second wife and two daughters.<br>
