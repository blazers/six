<span class="headword">&AElig;thelred</span>  (<em>d.</em> 911), <span class="occ">ruler of the Mercians</span>, took over the government of that portion of Mercia left to the English after the vikings had dismembered the kingdom in 877 and King Ceolwulf II had disappeared from the scene two years later. Nothing certain is known of how &AElig;thelred attained leadership of the Mercians, nor of his family background. He first appears in 883, by which time he had recognized the overlordship of the West Saxon king, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/183/', "Alfred")</script>: he made a grant to Berkeley Abbey in that year with Alfred's assent. Although the chronicler &AElig;thelweard (<i>d</i>. 998), who used sources independent of the extant versions of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, calls &AElig;thelred &#145;king&#146;, the title accorded to him by the latter texts is &#145;ealdorman&#146;. He certainly seems to have remained in some form of submission to the West Saxon kings for the rest of his life. His allegiance predates the occupation of London in 886 by Alfred, to whom &#145;all the English people that were not under subjection to the Danes&#146; submitted  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 886). Alfred's immediate concession to &AElig;thelred of control over London, which had been in Mercian hands earlier in the century, perhaps reflects the king's need to maintain unity among those English peoples who remained outside viking territory. Even more important for cementing the bond between the West Saxon and Mercian rulers was &AElig;thelred's marriage to Alfred's daughter and eldest child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8907/', "&#198;thelfl&#230;d")</script>, which had happened by the time Asser was writing his life of the king in 893, and perhaps took place as early as 888. &AElig;thelred was probably older than his wife, perhaps considerably so.<br>
<br>The year 892 brought new viking invaders to England, and &AElig;thelred took part in a concerted effort to oppose them. After the initial defeat of one viking leader, H&aelig;sten, he stood godfather to one of H&aelig;sten's two sons, while Alfred sponsored the other. In 893 &AElig;thelred took reinforcements from London to join Alfred's eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8514/', "Edward (870s?&#150;924)")</script>, in pinning down one force at Thorney in Buckinghamshire. Finding themselves insufficiently strong to assault the army directly, &AElig;thelred and Edward allowed it to leave English territory. Later in the year, a reinforced viking army set out on a raid up the Thames valley, and then up the Severn. &AElig;thelred followed it, with a force that included the ealdormen of Wiltshire and Somerset, contingents drawn from every fortified settlement in English Mercia and Wessex east of the Parret, and a detachment sent by the Welsh princes. The raiding army was besieged on the Severn at Buttington near Welshpool, but eventually cut its way out and limped back to its base at Shoebury, Essex. The presence of Welshmen in &AElig;thelred's force indicates the seriousness of the threat posed by the viking army. The relationship between the Welsh princes and the Mercian ruler was usually more hostile: Asser records that individual Welsh princes submitted to Alfred in order to obtain protection against &AElig;thelred.<br>
<br>&AElig;thelred's role in the ensuing campaign is nowhere made explicit, though it is highly likely that he co-ordinated the Mercian response to further raids. Late in 893 part of the viking force in Essex, joined by men from East Anglia and Northumbria, established itself at Chester but was starved out and moved to Wales, which it devastated for nearly a year; on its return east it avoided Wessex and Mercia altogether. In 895 an English army was obliged to shadow a viking party across the midlands to the Severn, where the vikings over-wintered. The dispersal of this force marked the end of serious viking assaults during Alfred's reign.<br>
<br>The construction of the defensive system of fortified sites (<i>burhs</i>) which Alfred began was chiefly continued by Edward and &AElig;thelfl&aelig;d after &AElig;thelred's death. Nevertheless, &AElig;thelred and &AElig;thelfl&aelig;d were approached by Werferth, bishop of Worcester, to fortify that town for the defence of the people and the security of the cathedral. Of even more importance to the Mercian rulers, perhaps, was Gloucester, where there is evidence for a royal palace and mint and where the street pattern is strikingly similar to that of some of Alfred's <i>burhs</i> in Wessex. &AElig;thelfl&aelig;d founded a new minster there, to which relics of the Northumbrian royal saint Oswald were translated in 909, and where, according to &AElig;thelweard, both she and her husband were buried.<br>
<br>At some time in the decade after Alfred's death in 899 &AElig;thelred seems to have fallen ill. Leadership of the Mercians is then accorded to Edward the Elder or to &AElig;thelfl&aelig;d: the West Saxon version of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> credits Edward with sending the Mercian army against the vikings in 909 and 910, and the so-called &#145;Mercian Register&#146; (embedded in texts B, C, and D of the chronicle) records that &AElig;thelfl&aelig;d built a fortified settlement at &#145;Bremesburh&#146; in 910. &AElig;thelred died in 911&#151;the precise date is unknown. &AElig;thelfl&aelig;d was subsequently able to assume rulership of the Mercians herself. The title by which she was known, <i>Myrcna hl&#339;fdige</i>, &#145;Lady of the Mercians&#146;, was an adaptation of &AElig;thelred's habitual title of <i>Myrcna hlaford</i>, &#145;Lord of the Mercians&#146;. Her brother Edward, however, &#145;succeeded to London and Oxford and to all the lands which belonged to them&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 911).<br>
