<span class="headword">Lamont,  Johann  von</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>John Lamont]</span>  (1805&#150;1879), <span class="occ">astronomer and geophysicist</span>, was born John Lamont on 13 December 1805 in Corriemulzie, near Braemar, Aberdeenshire, the only child of Robert Lamont, forester, and his second wife, Elspeth Ewan. In 1817, after his father's death Father Gall Robertson recruited him for the Scottish Benedictine monastery of St James in Regensburg, Bavaria, while his mother and stepbrother emigrated to the United States. The prior of the monastery, Benedikt Deasson, devoted himself to the boy's education in mathematics and mechanics. During the summer of 1827 Lamont spent his vacation at the observatory in Bogenhausen, near Munich. The director, Johann Georg von Soldner, appreciated Lamont's work and appointed him as his assistant in March 1828. Two years later Lamont obtained a doctorate from the University of Munich. After Soldner's death in 1833 Lamont provisionally headed the observatory, and he was appointed director in July 1835. He enjoyed the support of Friedrich von Schelling, president of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences, of which he became an extraordinary member in 1835 and an ordinary member in 1836. In 1837 he began lecturing on practical astronomy at the University of Munich and succeeded Franz von Paula Gruithuisen as professor of astronomy on 20 December 1852. For a short period Lamont was a member of the senate of the University of Munich (1857&#150;9).<br>
<br>Lamont's scientific work focused on astronomy, meteorology, and terrestrial magnetism. In order to do precise measurements in these fields he devised numerous new instruments in a private workshop that ultimately became part of the observatory in 1853. An outstanding 10.5 Paris inch refractor (approximately 11.25 standard inches) with a focal length of 15 feet, built by the famous workshop of Utzschneider-Fraunhofer, served him in the late 1830s for observing objects of relatively low luminosity, such as the satellites of Saturn and Uranus, the relative motion of star clusters, and Halley's comet in 1836. After 1840 Lamont's astronomical work focused mainly on positional astronomy and resulted in a catalogue of 80,000 stars, of which 12,000 had been previously undiscovered (&#145;Observationes astronomicae in specula regia Monachiensi institutae&#146;, published as <span class="italic">Annalen der K&ouml;niglichen Sternwarte bei M&uuml;nchen</span>, 20 vols. in ten bound books, 1848&#150;74). Lamont was also the first in Europe to devise a chronometer for recording the transit time of stars across the meridian (1850).<br>
<br>In the 1840s Lamont's attention was drawn to meteorology and terrestrial magnetism. As atmospheric conditions determined the quality of astronomical observations, he became interested in the study of weather and proposed a network of meteorological stations. In an effort to co-ordinate measurements he founded a meteorological association in 1842, and published the <span class="italic">Annalen f&uuml;r Meteorologie und Erdmagnetismus</span> from 1842 to 1844. His work, though remaining fragmentary due to lack of funding, laid the foundation for meteorological science in Bavaria and introduced new meteorological measuring and recording devices.<br>
<br>Lamont's interest in geophysics and terrestrial magnetism, to which he contributed his most important works, was closely linked to the initiative by C. F. Gauss and W. Weber that aimed at obtaining data on the earth's magnetic field by means of regular and simultaneous measurements at different observatories all over the world. Having built a magnetic observatory in 1840 with funds from the Bavarian government Lamont participated in the international campaign between 1841 and 1845, and he devised a whole range of new instruments, such as automatic recording apparatuses and portable theodolites, which were suited for expeditions (see J. von Lamont, <span class="italic">Handbuch des Erdmagnetismus</span>, 1849). In the late 1850s he extended his measurements to many places in Bavaria and travelled to France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Holland, and Denmark. Beside these main lines of work Lamont also participated in triangulation measurements between Austria and Bavaria, established statistics on Bavarian population, wrote on issues of law, health, and royal genealogy, and held popular lectures.<br>
<br>Lamont, of modest character and liberal to charities, did not marry and led a solitary life, though he did take part in the reunions of the &#145;Catholic Casino&#146; in Munich. Lamont was a member of numerous European academies, including the Royal Society of London, and received among other honours the order of Gregory the Great (conferred by Pius IX) and the order of the crown of Bavaria, the latter bringing with it the title of nobility. Lamont died on 6 August 1879 from the effects of a youthful spinal injury and was buried in the churchyard in Bogenhausen. On his gravestone was engraved: &#145;et coelum et terram exploravit&#146; (&#145;he explored the sky as well as the earth&#146;). Upon his death he bequeathed his savings to a foundation which he had established in 1853 to support students of astronomy, mathematical physics, and mathematics, and whose capital amounted to 160,000 marks.<br>
