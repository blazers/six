<span class="headword">Walker,  Thomas</span>  (1784&#150;1836), <span class="occ">police magistrate and author</span>, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63603/', "Thomas Walker (1749&#150;1817)")</script> and Hannah Shore, was born at Barlow Hall, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, near Manchester, on 10 October 1784. His father, a Manchester cotton merchant, was the head of the town's whig or reform party and in 1785 led the successful opposition to Pitt's fustian tax. <br>
<br>The younger Thomas Walker attended a school at Manchester before going up to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1808 and MA in 1811. He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple on 8 May 1812, and, after the death of his father, lived for some years at Longford Hall, Stretford, engaging in township affairs and dealing successfully with the problem of pauperism, which became his special study. A Malthusian, in 1826 he published <span class="italic">Observations on the Nature, Extent, and Effects of Pauperism, and on the Means of Reducing it</span> (2nd edn, 1831), and in 1834 <span class="italic">Suggestions for a Constitutional and Efficient Reform in Parochial Government</span>. In 1829 he was appointed a police magistrate at the Lambeth Street court.<br>
<br>On 20 May 1835 Walker began the publication of a weekly periodical entitled <span class="italic">The Original</span>, which he continued until the following December. It was a collection of his thoughts on many subjects, intended to raise &#145;the national tone in whatever concerns us socially or individually&#146;; his papers on health and gastronomy, however, were the chief attraction of the work. Many editions of <span class="italic">The Original</span> were published: one, with memoirs of the two Walkers by William Blanchard Jerrold, came out in 1874; another, edited by William Augustus Guy, in 1875; and one, with an introduction by Henry Morley, in 1887. A selection, entitled <span class="italic">The Art of Dining and of Attaining High Health</span>, was printed at Philadelphia in 1837, and another selection, by Felix Summerley (Sir Henry Cole), was published in 1881 under the title <span class="italic">Aristology, or, The Art of Dining</span>.<br>
<br>Walker died unmarried at Brussels on 20 January 1836, and was buried in the cemetery there. A tablet to his memory was placed in London at St Mary's, Whitechapel.<br>
