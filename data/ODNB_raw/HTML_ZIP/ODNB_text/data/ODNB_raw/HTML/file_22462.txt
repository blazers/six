<span class="headword">Pole, Sir  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1561, <em>d.</em> 1635), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was baptized at Colyton, Devon, on 27 August 1561, the son of William Pole (<i>c</i>.1514&#150;1587) of Shute, Devon, a gentleman whose family had extensive estates in east Devon, and Katherine, daughter of Alexander Popham, lord chief justice of England. In February 1579, like his father before him, he entered the Inner Temple. On 20 July 1583 at Shobrooke, Devon, he married Mary, the daughter and one of the heirs of Sir William Peryam of Crediton, and they had six sons and six daughters before Mary's death from a fall in May 1606.<br>
<br>Pole represented Bossiney, Cornwall, in the parliament of 1586, became justice of the peace for Devon by 1592, and served as high sheriff for Devon in the year 1602&#150;3. He was for many years one of the feoffees of Colyton. On 15 February 1606 he was knighted by James I at Whitehall. He paid &pound;37 10<i>s</i>. to the Virginia Company and was one of the incorporators of the third Virginia charter in 1612. His second marriage was to Jane, the wealthy widow of Roger How of London and daughter of William Simmes or Symes of Chard, Somerset. There were no children from this marriage.<br>
<br>Pole is best known as an antiquary and must have begun his work well before 1608 when Ralph Brooke, York herald, made extracts from his writings. Two folio manuscript volumes, probably completed about 1617, were eventually printed as <span class="italic">Collections towards a Description of the County of Devon</span> by John Nichols in 1791. A transcript had previously been made by John Anstis and further transcripts were made from this copy. Another volume of 622 pages, described by the historian John Prince as &#145;a vast manuscript volume in folio as big as a church <span class="roman">Bible</span>, containing copies of deeds, seals and grants&#146;  (Prince, 505), was used by Prince to compile his <span class="italic">Danmonii orientales illustres</span> (1701); his manuscript extracts also survive  (BL, Add. MS 28649). A small proportion privately printed by Sir Thomas Phillips as <span class="italic">Sir William Pole's Copies of Extracts from Old Evidences</span> (<i>c</i>.1840) bears witness to the industry of Pole in searching out historical source material. Some 4600 documents scattered in the charter chests of the gentry in the west of England are described with varying amounts of detail, including cartularies of Tavistock and Newenham abbeys which have otherwise disappeared. This thoroughness makes him, in Prince's words, &#145;the first as the best antiquary (for certainty and judgment) that ever we had in our county&#146;  (Prince, 506), although ironically Prince is inaccurate in his account of Pole's early life, confusing father and son. Pole was also acknowledged by the antiquary Tristram Risdon as being the man &#145;from whose lamp I have received light in these my labours&#146;  (Risdon, 29). According to Prince, much of the material collected by Pole &#145;miscarried in the time of the late civil wars&#146;  (Prince, 506) when Colcombe Castle was burned, but, as well as the two items already mentioned, a folio volume containing &#145;The coats of arms of the Devonshire gentry drawn with a pen&#146; and another folio compilation containing copies of deeds and charters relating to Tor Abbey survived in the library at Shute House; they were transferred to Antony in Cornwall, the home of the Carew Pole branch of the family, when the senior line of the Poles of Shute became extinct in 1926.<br>
<br>Pole retired from Shute House to Colcombe Castle in the parish of Colyton which he had &#145;new built&#146;  (Prince, 505) and where he died on 9 February 1635. He was buried in the chancel of Colyton church and was succeeded by his second son, John, who was created a baronet and added to his father's writings. John died on 16 April 1658.<br>
