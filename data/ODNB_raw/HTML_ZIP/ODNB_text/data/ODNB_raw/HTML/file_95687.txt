<span class="headword">Robson,  Edward Robert</span>  (1835&#150;1917), <span class="occ">architect and surveyor</span>, was born in Durham on 2 March 1835, the eldest son of Robert Robson and his wife, Susanna. His father was a prominent local builder, an alderman, justice of the peace, and three times mayor of Durham. Educated at private schools, Robson entered his father's business in 1851, remaining there for three years. Among his father's clients was the architect John Dobson, and in 1853 Robson was articled to him, joining one of the largest and most successful practices in the north of England. Robson's next move took him to London, and three years' work as a draughtsman for George Gilbert Scott. Scott's was the best Gothic practice in the country, and working for him introduced Robson to many of the rising stars of the architectural profession. It also introduced him to the most advanced Gothic architecture of the period, and it seems likely that Robson had a hand in Dobson's Inglethorpe Hall, Norfolk (1858&#150;60), which goes well beyond his master's usual range.<br>
<br>In 1858 Robson travelled through Europe and the following year went into partnership with J. W. Wilson Walton (later Walton-Wilson). In 1860 he was elected an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and became a fellow in 1864. But this did not mark the start of a career in private practice. While his partner managed an office in London, Robson returned to Durham where he was appointed architect to the cathedral. He remained in that role until 1864, restoring the tower with George Gilbert Scott (1858&#150;61), and the north side of the Galilee with C. Hodgson Fowler (1864). This work left little opportunity for independent commissions, although he did build the churches of St Cuthbert in Durham (1858&#150;63) and St Mary in West Rainton (1864), and the Mowbray almshouses in Bishopwearmouth (1863). And, in 1861, his job also provided him with the means to marry Marian, eldest daughter of Henry Longden, iron founder of Sheffield. They had three children, a daughter and two sons, the youngest of whom, Philip Appleby Robson, followed his father into architectural practice and also wrote on school building.<br>
<br>Robson left Durham in 1864 to become architect and surveyor to the corporation of Liverpool, a post he held until 1871. Restricted by the terms of his contract, which prevented him from taking on private commissions, he found in the church of St Anne's, St Anne Street (1870&#150;71), a rare opportunity to act as an architect in his own right. None the less, he did become an accomplished surveyor and was elected a fellow of the Surveyors' Institution in 1872. He completed the municipal buildings begun by his predecessor John Weightman (1862&#150;8) and erected a great Gothic screen wall in Stanley Park, Anfield (1868&#150;71).<br>
<br>Perhaps because the air of the city was bad for his health, and perhaps because he wanted a greater chance to design in his own right, Robson left Liverpool for London, having been appointed surveyor to the newly created school board there. On taking up the job in July 1871 on &pound;500 a year, he experienced a drop in both salary and status, but he was promoted to architect less than twelve months later and his pay was doubled. More importantly, the move to London allowed Robson to work independently, and he established a partnership with J. J. Stevenson, an arrangement which lasted until 1876. None the less, as architect to the London school board Robson was busy enough: during his time there he had overall responsibility for nearly 300 new schools. In search of appropriate models he toured Europe and America, summing up his conclusions in <span class="italic">School Architecture</span> (1874), a book that became the standard text on its subject. More important still, in issuing circulars, assessing competitions, and designing schools of his own, Robson developed a distinctive approach to board school building.<br>
<br>The result was a strikingly new sort of school. &#145;Lighthouses! Beacons of the future! Capsules, with hundreds of bright little seeds in each, out of which will spring the wiser, better England of the future&#146;, as Sherlock Holmes described them  (A. Conan Doyle, <span class="italic">The Complete Sherlock Holmes Short Stories</span>, 1928, 515). Frequently building in slums, Robson and the board were determined that these schools should impress their young users and their families. They were large, imposing, and often as many as three storeys high. They dominated their surroundings. Most remarkably of all, and after some initial hesitation, Robson rejected Gothic models in favour of an eclectic English Renaissance style: more fitting, as he suggested, for secular schools. Their elevations, with fancy gables, colourful brickwork, and terracotta ornamentation, were highly fashionable. Their plans&#151;usually featuring separate classrooms entered from a central schoolroom, and separate playgrounds and entrances for boys and girls&#151;would influence elementary school design until the early years of the twentieth century. To be sure, Robson was not a lonely pioneer: others had already built in this &#145;Queen Anne&#146; revival style. Nor was his planning as original as he claimed. None the less, Robson was the mastermind behind hundreds of schools, and he became the single greatest advocate of the board school style. From Bonner Street, Hackney (1875), to Oban Street, in Bromley-by-Bow (1881), his own schools brilliantly embodied the reforming idealism of the school board for London itself.<br>
<br>Robson remained at the school board until 1884, when he became consulting architect to the Education Department, a job he held for the next twenty years. Once again, it appears that he wanted more opportunity for private practice. Administrative work for the department and his continued role as an adviser to the London school board made this difficult. However Robson did find some time, working with John Whichcord and forming a partnership with J. J. Gott between 1910 and 1914. He built the People's Palace in the Mile End Road (1886), the New Art Gallery, Regent Street (1888), and worked at various schools&#151;including Cheltenham Ladies' College (1896&#150;8) and the enormous Jews' Free School in Spitalfields (1904&#150;5). Above all, though, at the Education Department he did for the nation what he had done for London. His rules for school building, which were issued annually between 1884 and 1904, influenced designs throughout the country.<br>
<br>Robson spent his last years living in Blackheath, Kent, and he died at his home there, 2 The Paragon, on 19 January 1917. He was buried at Shooters Hill five days later. For much of his career Robson was less architect than surveyor, and for still more of it he was less surveyor than civil servant. Although his son attempted to claim credit on his father's behalf for inventing the Queen Anne revival style, this was clearly not the case. Nor was his work always appreciated&#151;he was accused of profligacy, incompetence, and even corruption. On a number of occasions the school board of London voted to take him to law. But through his example, his writings, and his role as a pioneering public servant, he transformed the architecture of education and influenced schools all across England. Although twice offered a knighthood, he turned the honour down. His memorial is appropriately found in schools throughout the country.<br>
