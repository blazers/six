<span class="headword">Knewstub <span class="st"> [Knewstubs]</span>,  John</span>  (1544&#150;1624), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Kirkby Stephen in Westmorland in 1544. Nothing is known of his youth until his attendance at St John's College, Cambridge, from which he graduated BA in 1564. In 1567 he was admitted to a fellowship at St John's, where he soon emerged as a member of the puritan faction in the university, being among those who petitioned against the wearing of clerical vestments. He was one of a group&#151;along with Ezekiel Culverwell, John Carter, and others&#151;that met with Lawrence Chaderton to expound and discuss the scriptures, and he developed lifelong friendships with John Still, Adam Winthrop, Henry Sandes, Roger Goad, and others. His <span class="italic">Lectures &hellip; upon the Twentieth Chapter of Exodus</span>, first published in 1577, went through four printings between then and 1584. Delivered while he was at Cambridge, they set forth the developing English Calvinist theology which expounded God's determination of those who were elect and thus in covenant with him.<br>
<br>Shortly before that work appeared Knewstub had emerged as an important figure in the church when in 1576 he preached the Good Friday sermon at Paul's Cross against the Family of Love. Opposition to the Familists preoccupied him over the next five years. In 1580 he was engaged to investigate the influence of the Family of Love at the royal court and was then chosen to deliver letters from the privy council to five bishops ordering the investigation of the sect in their dioceses. He was himself appointed to the investigating commission in the diocese of Norwich. In 1581 he helped to prepare and promote a bill against the Familists which was introduced into the parliament that met in the early months of that year. His prominence in the attack upon these heterodox opinions helped to mask his own reservations concerning church practices, and the prominent connections that he made during this campaign were useful in protecting him from episcopal attacks on nonconformity in the 1580s.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in 1579 he was presented to the living of Cockfield, Suffolk, by Sir William Spring. In 1582 he hosted a gathering of mostly East Anglian clergy to discuss the observance of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. The following year a group of Suffolk ministers, including Knewstub and others who had attended the Cockfield meeting, appealed to the bishop of Norwich in protest against Archbishop Whitgift's three articles, which intended to enforce clerical conformity. The ministers took the occasion to express their concerns about such matters as the rite of baptism and burial practices. Along with other signatories Knewstub was suspended from his ministry for his nonconformity, but through the intervention of Lord Burghley and others this proved temporary. In 1585&#150;6 Knewstub served as a chaplain to the earl of Leicester on the latter's expedition to the Netherlands, another reflection of his connections with prominent puritans at court.<br>
<br>In Suffolk Knewstub had emerged as leader of the combination lecture that functioned at Bury St Edmunds, and in 1589 he became engaged in a dispute with Thomas Rogers, who had been excluded from the lecture after preaching a sermon perceived to be critical of Chaderton. Throughout the latter part of Elizabeth's reign Knewstub was one of the dominant figures in the puritan movement in the Stour valley borderland of Suffolk and Essex. He travelled throughout the region, preaching and visiting such clerical colleagues as Richard Rogers, Ezekiel Culverwell, and Stephen Egerton, as well as lay supporters of the movement. His advice was sought on ecclesiastical appointments. Along with John Still he was consulted by the townsmen of Bury St Edmunds over the choice of town preachers. In 1592 he joined with Chaderton, Roger Goad, and Still, among others, in recommending John Ward of Haverhill to be town preacher of Ipswich. Though he continued to be cited in visitations for refusal either to wear the surplice or to sign with the cross in baptism, no action was taken against him. He was also noted for his advocacy of fasts and strict sabbath observance. No record of Knewstub's subscription to Whitgift's three articles has been found, and it is likely that, in common with many other clergymen, he offered only a qualified conformity.<br>
<br>In 1595 Knewstub was proposed by Goad and others as master of St John's after the death of William Whitaker, but he was not elected. In 1596 he was named as an overseer of the Boxford grammar school chartered by the queen. Fellow overseers included Adam Winthrop, Thomas Lovell, Henry Sandes, and members of the Waldegrave and Gurdon families.<br>
<br>In 1603 Knewstub was chosen to be one of the puritan spokesmen at the following year's Hampton Court conference. When the sought-for reforms were denied he pleaded with the king for tolerance of those in Suffolk who desired to avoid use of the surplice and signing with the cross in baptism, but his plea was rejected. Correspondence between his friends William Bedell and Samuel Ward indicates that at this time Knewstub was concerned with the possible consequences of continuing nonconformity and was seeking a curate who would conduct services while wearing a surplice. This stratagem failed, and in 1606 he was presented for not using the sign of the cross in baptism and for not wearing the surplice. In 1611 he was again cited for not wearing the surplice. Yet he escaped deprivation.<br>
<br>Knewstub continued to play a prominent role in efforts to foster the piety of the godly in the Stour valley, and he preached strongly on the need to exercise Christian love to all members of the community. In 1605 he preached the funeral sermon for Robert Welche of Little Waldingfield and with his fellow clergymen carried the coffin to the graveyard. He joined Richard Rogers of Wethersfield, Essex, in acting as spiritual physician to an Essex youth. In September 1613, along with John Winthrop Groton, Henry Sandes (the lecturer of Boxford), and others, he formed a covenanted spiritual association whose members were pledged to remember each other in their prayers every Friday and to meet annually to renew their communion. In 1618 he preached the funeral sermon for Richard Rogers.<br>
<br>Knewstub died at Cockfield and was buried there on 31 May 1624. In his will (drawn up on the 20th) he left gifts to Henry Sandes of Boxford, Ezekiel Culverwell, Samuel Ward of Ipswich, John Wilson of Sudbury, and others. He left &pound;20 to buy a house or land whose revenue should be yearly distributed to the poor of Cockfield; if that annual income was not disposed of as directed, the money could be claimed by St John's College to supplement the two exhibitions which Knewstub had founded in 1620 to enable both a native of Kirkby Stephen and a youth of Cockfield to study there. Knewstub was not married, but left money to three nephews and several other relatives. The supervisors of his will were headed by his &#145;worshipfull good friend&#146; John Winthrop of Groton, the son of Knewstub's ally Adam Winthrop and himself the future governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.<br>
<br>Knewstub often preached what might be called a social gospel, urging his listeners to exercise charity towards their neighbours, and contemporary testimony indicates that he practised what he preached. Richard Rogers in his diary referred to his friend Knewstub as &#145;in prayer unwearyed&#146;, and a man of &#145;rare humility, joined with great knowledge and wisdom&#146; who was noted for &#145;his bearing of wrongs&#146; and &#145;bountiful liberality with mercifulness&#146;  (Knappen, 95&#150;6). In <span class="italic">The Real Christian</span> Giles Firmin records an episode that bears this out. Rogers and Knewstub were travelling together when they encountered a noted reprobate. Rogers moved to pass on, but Knewstub conversed with the man courteously and then reproved Rogers, saying that his friend's indifference &#145;is not the way to win wicked men to a liking of the Gospel and the way of God, but rather to beat them off&#146;  (Firmin, 67&#150;8).<br>
