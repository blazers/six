<span class="headword">Weiss,  Roberto</span>  (1906&#150;1969), <span class="occ">Italian scholar and author</span>, was born in Milan on 22 January 1906, the only son of Eugenio Natale Weiss and of Rita Fattori; his family was of Austrian origin and had settled in Italy. He received a classical education in Rome at the <i>Liceo</i> E. Q. Visconti and the <i>Liceo</i> Umberto I. After his final school examinations, he went, on the advice of his father, to England to read law and prepare himself for a diplomatic career; in 1928 he matriculated at Oxford as a non-collegiate student (later St Catherine's Society) and was awarded an honours degree in jurisprudence in 1932. But the study of law had not appealed to him, and, having worked as temporary assistant in the department of Western manuscripts of the Bodleian Library in 1932&#150;3, he began in 1934 postgraduate studies in the faculty of modern history. His DPhil thesis, submitted in 1938, was published in 1941 (<span class="italic">Humanism in England during the Fifteenth Century</span>; rev. edns, 1955, 1967). Sometimes styled count (probably of the Holy Roman empire), he was naturalized a British subject on 30 May 1934; on 18 July 1936 he married at St Aloysius Roman Catholic Church, Oxford, Eve (<i>b</i>. 1907), daughter of William Raymond Cecil, with whom he had four children.<br>
<br>In 1938, Weiss joined the Italian department of University College, London, as assistant lecturer, and apart from his military service in the Royal Artillery from 1942 to 1945 he taught at University College until his death. From 1946 he was professor of Italian and head of department. Through his teaching and his many contacts with British and Italian scholars, he made his department a leading centre of Italian studies. In 1969 the British Academy awarded him the Serena medal for Italian studies.<br>
<br>When Weiss wrote his book on humanism in England, aspects of the subject had been dealt with by historians of fifteenth-century England, and a comprehensive survey based on printed sources had recently been published. Weiss, however, not only used a wealth of manuscript material, but also broke new ground by studying early English humanism in the context of the classical revival in Italy and by examining both the influence of Italian humanists on English intellectual life, and the careers of English students at Italian universities, who thus participated in the humanist movement in Italy.<br>
<br>It was this movement which after Weiss's return to London in 1945 came to occupy the centre of his scholarly work, but with a shift back to the early fourteenth century. His pioneering inaugural lecture, <span class="italic">The Dawn of Humanism in Italy</span>, mapped out in 1947 a new direction of his studies, which was again to prove innovating. Only scant attention had hitherto been paid to what came to be called Italian prehumanism, and his studies on Lovato Lovati, Geremia da Montagnone, Geri d'Arezzo, and Albertino Mussato opened new perspectives; but he also published in 1950 an unknown version of a chapter of Petrarch's <span class="italic">Trionfo della fama</span> which he had discovered in the British Museum. It was the most spectacular of his innumerable discoveries in the manuscript collections of British and Italian libraries, the former in the footsteps of his mentor Cesare Foligno. He told the author of this biography that many of his discoveries went back to his systematic reading, on the train journeys between Henley-on-Thames, where he lived, and London, of Mazzatinti's massive inventories of manuscripts in Italian libraries. But it was only his vast and profound knowledge of the contemporary literature which made these discoveries possible. At the same time, Weiss became increasingly interested in a hitherto little explored field, the knowledge of Greek and the translations from Greek in fourteenth-century Italy, as well as in France and England; his essays on this subject, mainly from the years 1951 to 1953, were republished in 1977 under the title <span class="italic">Medieval and Humanist Greek</span>, which also included a bibliography of his publications.<br>
<br>Ever since his schooldays, Weiss had collected ancient coins and medals; by the time of his death, his Renaissance medals formed a scholarly private collection unrivalled in Britain, which he used for his pioneering studies of Renaissance collectors and collections. While studying the life and writings of humanists, he had taken notes on the humanists' interest in classical antiquities and their survival in Renaissance Italy; during the last years of his life, he drew on the vast amount of material he had gathered for yet another groundbreaking work. Completed in 1968, <span class="italic">The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity</span> (1969; 2nd edn 1988) constitutes a unique synthesis. While earlier studies of this subject, many of them by Weiss, had concentrated on a few towns, foremost among them Rome, and on single humanists, the book embraces the whole of Italy within a span of time which stretches from the early fourteenth to the sixteenth century. Combining consummate scholarship with economy of exposition, it discusses the rise of classical archaeology and epigraphy, the development of the topography of ancient Rome, the collections of Roman and later also of Greek antiquities, and other aspects of the new and enthusiastic interest in the surviving remains of classical antiquity.<br>
<br>Like his other writings, this book testifies to one of the pervasive traits of Weiss's scholarship, his insistence on the absolute priority of contemporary sources. Another was his reluctance to attack other scholars. This absence of polemic in his writings, together with his endless generosity in sharing his knowledge, were among Weiss's most striking and endearing characteristics. He writes of Pope Pius II, the humanist Enea Silvio Piccolomini, that &#145;he bore lightly his massive erudition&#146;. The same judgement could also be applied to him.<br>
<br>Notwithstanding his complete integration into English ways of life and his absorption of the cultural traditions of his adopted country, Weiss remained mindful of his intellectual roots in Italy, cemented by his many friendships with Italian scholars&#151;a dual bond which he chose to indicate, in his lapidary style, by alternatively signing, in his publications in England, his name as Roberto, in those in Italy, as Robert. He died on 10 August 1969 at his home, 44 St Andrews Road, Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, of a heart attack. He left his papers and offprints to the Warburg Institute, University of London; his collection of Renaissance medals is on long loan to the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.<br>
