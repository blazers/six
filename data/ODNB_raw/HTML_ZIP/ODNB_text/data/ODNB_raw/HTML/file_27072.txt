<span class="headword">Taylor,  Polycarpus</span>  (1706/7&#150;1781), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, whose parentage and upbringing are unknown, was promoted second lieutenant in the <i>Augusta</i> with Sir Chaloner Ogle on 21 June 1739. He appears to have gone out with Ogle to the West Indies, and in June 1741 was moved by Edward Vernon in to the <i>Boyne</i>, his own flagship. On 2 May 1743 he was promoted captain of the frigate <i>Fowey</i> on the Jamaica station and he continued in her until 1747 when he was moved by Rear-Admiral Charles Knowles to the <i>Elizabeth</i> (64 guns). Later, following the abortive attempt on Santiago de Cuba, he moved to Knowles's flagship, the <i>Cornwall</i>.<br>
<br>As flag captain Taylor took part in the engagement off Havana on 1 October 1748 and his conduct was clearly well regarded by his commanding officer. Writing to Lord Anson on 25 January 1749, Knowles included Taylor among several seamen who &#145;are good&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 15956, fol. 169). He was then appointed commander of the <i>Ripon</i> and senior officer on the station at Knowles's return to England. He was recalled soon afterwards, arriving at Spithead early in January 1750. In 1756 he was appointed to the <i>Marlborough</i> but then moved (7 June) to the <i>Culloden</i> with orders to take Sir Edward Hawke and join her new ship at Gibraltar.<br>
<br>Taylor appears to have brought the <i>Culloden</i> to England in 1757 and to have had no further active service. He is sometimes wrongly credited with the command of the <i>Ramillies</i> in 1758&#151;in fact held by Wittewronge Taylor, who was no relation, who also served on the <i>Cornwall</i> with Knowles on the Jamaica station. Taylor was superannuated with the rank of rear-admiral five years after his retirement in 1762, and passed the rest of his life at Norton, co. Durham. Details of his family life are scant, though a son, also Polycarpus, was baptized at Norton on 20 July 1753. The elder Taylor died aged seventy-four at Durham in January 1781, and was buried at St Mary the Virgin, Norton.<br>
