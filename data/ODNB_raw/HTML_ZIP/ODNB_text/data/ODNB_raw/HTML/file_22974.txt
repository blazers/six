<span class="headword">Radcliffe <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ward]</span>,  Ann</span>  (1764&#150;1823), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 9 July 1764 in London, where she was baptized on 5 August 1764 in St Andrew's, Holborn, the only child of William Ward (1737&#150;1798), a haberdasher with premises at 19 Holborn Street, and Ann Oates (1726&#150;1800) of Chesterfield.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandmarriage"></a>Early life and marriage</h2>In 1772 the family moved to Bath, where William Ward managed a showroom for the firm of Wedgwood and Bentley in the Westgate buildings before moving to the more fashionable Milsom Street in 1774. Thomas Bentley was Ann Ward's uncle, having married Ann Oates's sister Hannah in 1754, and played an important role in her upbringing. After Hannah's death in 1759 her elder sister Elizabeth kept house for Bentley until he was married a second time, to Mary Stamford, in 1772. From 1768 until his death in 1780 Bentley was a partner in Joseph Wedgwood's pottery business. He moved to Little Cheyne Row, Chelsea, in 1769, to 13 Greek Street, Soho, in 1774, and to Turnham Green in the summer of 1777. After William Ward's haberdashery business collapsed at the beginning of the 1770s Ann appears to have spent long periods with the Bentleys, where her playfellow was Susannah Wedgwood, the future mother of Charles Darwin.<br>
<br>Ann Ward married William Radcliffe (1763&#150;1830) on 15 January 1787, at St Michael's Church, Bath. A graduate of Oxford, and for a time a student at the Middle Temple, William Radcliffe was primarily a journalist, an occupation he pursued for most of the 1790s. A brilliant linguist with a formidable memory and a flair for reporting parliamentary business, William Radcliffe was much in demand during a period in which there was a keen appetite for news from, and debates about, France. William survived his wife, and it is from him that most of the information about Radcliffe derives. In the obituary he wrote of his wife William Radcliffe omits reference to the Wards, &#145;nearly the only persons of their two families not living in handsome, or at least easy independence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Biography</span>, 98), in order to concentrate on his wife's illustrious maternal relatives, such as the famous de Witts of Holland, William Cheselden, surgeon to George II, and her maternal grandmother, Ann Oates, the sister of Dr Samuel Jebb of Stratford, who included among her nephews Samuel's son Sir Richard Jebb, the king's physician, and Dr Samuel Hallifax, the bishop of Gloucester. However, he does not mention Hallifax's cousin Dr John Jebb, the radical Unitarian and distinguished theologian, who for much of Ann Radcliffe's childhood lived nearby in London.<br>
<br>The omission is of a piece with another of William Radcliffe's economies. In the obituary notice he describes himself as the proprietor of the <span class="italic">English Chronicle</span>, with which he was associated from 1796. Before that, he was a journalist working for, and then editor of, the <span class="italic">Gazetteer and New Daily Advertiser</span>, the most radical of the London newspapers, from 1790 to 1793. Apart from enthusiastically welcoming the French Revolution, the <span class="italic">Gazetteer</span> staunchly supported the impeachment of Warren Hastings, the campaign to free dissenters from the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span>, the freedom of the press, and the illegality of duelling. According to Ann Radcliffe, her husband was responsible for the political sentiments expressed in her travel book; if so, the Radcliffes were still supporting the <span class="italic">Gazetteer's</span> politics in 1794, as can be seen from the following response to a monument celebrating the revolution of 1688 in Kendal:<blockquote>At a time, when the memory of that revolution is reviled, and the praises of liberty itself endeavoured to be suppressed by the artifice of imputing to it the crimes of anarchy, it was impossible to omit any act of veneration to the blessings of this event. (A. Radcliffe, <span class="italic">A Journey Made in the Summer of 1794</span>, 1795, 389)</blockquote>In a notebook entry from 1797, Joseph Farington relates how Giuseppe Marchi had recently dined with the Radcliffes, noting that William was &#145;democratically inclined&#146;  (Rogers, <span class="italic">Bio-Bibliography</span>, 43).<br>
<br>Thomas Noon Talfourd reports that Radcliffe regularly attended the Anglican church. Although there is no reason to disbelieve Talfourd, the statement misleads as much as it informs. While it is probably true that Radcliffe attended the Anglican church in the last decades of her life, it is not at all certain that she did so in the 1790s. Even if she did throughout her lifetime, this is not the same as saying that she was Anglican in belief, outlook, or family background. Like the 150 Anglican clergyman who subscribed to John Jebb's collected works, dissenting sympathizers who stopped short of breaking cover, she appears to have taken a liberal view of doctrinal matters. Similarly, both the <span class="italic">Annual Biography</span> and Talfourd relate that the years she spent visiting Thomas Bentley were the future novelist's most formative period. Besides her uncle's improving company, she encountered such luminaries as Elizabeth Montagu, Hester Piozzi, Mrs Ord, and Athenian Stuart. However, both sources neglect to mention that Bentley was one of the country's most prominent dissenters, who as a founder and trustee of the dissenting academy at Warrington included among his friends and acquaintances Joseph Priestley, Dr John Aikin, and his sister Anna Laetitia, later Mrs Barbauld. The appointment of Talfourd as Ann Radcliffe's biographer may signify the enduring nature of the Radcliffes' dissenting affiliations, as Talfourd was a Unitarian, a fringe member of Leigh Hunt's &#145;cockney school&#146;, and a passionate advocate of William Godwin.<h2>
<a name="Writingandachievement"></a>Writing and achievement</h2>According to her husband, Ann Radcliffe began writing as a means of amusing herself during the long evenings when William was away reporting parliament. She published five novels in her lifetime, though she always called them &#145;romances&#146;. They were <span class="italic">The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne</span> (1789); <span class="italic">A Sicilian Romance</span> (1790); <span class="italic">The Romance of the Forest</span> (1791); <span class="italic">The Mysteries of Udolpho</span> (1794); and <span class="italic">The Italian</span> (1797). Her travel book, <span class="italic">A Journey Made in the Summer of 1794</span>, appeared in 1795. A final novel, <span class="italic">Gaston de Blondeville</span>, was published posthumously in 1826. Her first romance was barely noticed; the second caused a stir; the third made her famous. At the time of her death in 1823, she was hailed as the &#145;great enchantress&#146; and the &#145;Shakespeare of Romance writers&#146;  (Miles, 7, 10), and was generally esteemed as one of the pre-eminent novelists of her generation  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 93.87). Several volumes of poetry appeared under her name during her lifetime, but these were pirated collations of the verse she had published interspersed with her romances.<br>
<br>Radcliffe's historical settings vary considerably, from pre-Reformation (<span class="italic">The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne</span>), to the recent past (<span class="italic">The Italian</span>), with the rest falling somewhere in between. Despite these differences all her romances contain a heroine with a modern sensibility who finds herself imperilled by the forces of feudalism. Generally speaking, her plots turn on the inheritance of property. Her first romance, set in Scotland, features a heroine who is nearly blackmailed into marrying the murderer of her father and the usurper of the family castle, a threat he prosecutes by holding the heroine's brother at knife-point. Predictably, the comely peasant youth who rescues the heroine himself turns out to be a usurped nobleman. The melodramatic plot and hectic pace is continued in <span class="italic">A Sicilian Romance</span>. The Marquis Mazzini wishes to trade his daughter, Julia, to a friend. Escaping, Julia wanders through the scenic landscape of Sicily, thus creating the opportunity for a form of graphic travelogue that Radcliffe was to make famous in her subsequent romances. Featuring rocky crags and precipitous cliffs interspersed with Arcadian retreats, her style was repeatedly characterized as a verbal equivalent of Salvator Rosa and Claude Lorraine. Julia eventually stumbles on her mother, who had been buried alive in an abandoned wing of the family palazzo after the marquis had faked her death, a piece of marital brutality that comes to loom large in the imagination of Catherine Morland, the heroine from Jane Austen's <span class="italic">Northanger Abbey</span>, who suffers from having read too much Radcliffe. <span class="italic">The Romance of the Forest</span> features an incest theme that appeared again in <span class="italic">The Italian</span>. In these romances a heroine is menaced by an uncle who has dispossessed her of both family and property. In <span class="italic">The Mysteries of Udolpho</span> Emily is held prisoner in a castle in the Apennine mountains by Montoni, who has already murdered her aunt, and threatens her with much the same unless she surrenders the rights to her estates. The heroine escapes once again to embark on her picturesque and sublime travels. In <span class="italic">The Italian</span> Radcliffe broke new ground by featuring the Roman Inquisition, until then an untried source of Gothic horror.<br>
<br>Although Radcliffe was studiously apolitical as a novelist, her works are permeated with the progressive Enlightenment values that were commonplace before the terror in France, and which were staunchly held by her uncle Bentley and by her husband William. All her novels, save the first, are set in periods transitional between feudalism and modernity; and while her happy couples are themselves well born, their attitudes are distinctly bourgeois, especially as regards companionate marriage. The religious attitudes displayed in her romances are also deistical. Her heroines evince a deep interest in natural religion, in the hand of creator that lurks behind the veil of nature, and no enthusiasm whatsoever for revealed or codified religion. These values are most pronounced in <span class="italic">The Romance of the Forest</span>, which, in the figure of La Luc, also pays warm homage to the vicar of Savoyard in Rousseau's <span class="italic">&Eacute;mile</span>.<br>
<br>Radcliffe's romances contain numerous innovations. She was understood to have brought landscape description to a new peak of perfection, an expertise particularly evident in the way in which she interweaves the sublime and picturesque into the fabric of her narratives. Her style of romance was understood to be &#145;poetic&#146;, by which reviewers meant, apart from the beauty of her scenery, her ability to evoke moods of melancholic introspection and enchantment. Her earlier romances are interspersed with poetry, while her chapters bear epigraphs, principally from Shakespeare and the pre-Romantics, itself an innovative practice. Perhaps the innovation with which she was most associated was the so-called &#145;explained supernatural&#146;. While she was universally admired for the ingenuity with which she escaped the guesses of the reader, before revealing the sublunary causes of her supernatural mysteries, the device was understood to be subject to the law of diminishing returns, and she was criticized for using it, especially by Sir Walter Scott. The criticisms were certainly unfair, as the device is integral to Radcliffe's narrative practice of balancing symbolic and literal meanings, where the symbolism generated by supernatural appearance takes on its significance precisely because it is fantasized, rather than &#145;real&#146;. Despite being attacked for working in a formulaic genre, Radcliffe rarely repeats herself but attempts something new in each succeeding romance, often in response to her critics. Thus her penultimate novel, <span class="italic">The Italian</span>, makes very sparing use of the explained supernatural, while her final, posthumous one, <span class="italic">Gaston de Blondeville</span> (1826), dispenses with it altogether, a fact which may partially explain the lack of critical interest in it.<br>
<br>Radcliffe was unquestionably the dominant romance writer of the 1790s. Her influence on the fiction of the decade, and on what has subsequently come to be known as the Gothic novel, was formative and deep. Her position is reflected in the unprecedented sums she received for her last two novels: &pound;500 for <span class="italic">Udolpho</span>, and &pound;800 for <span class="italic">The Italian</span>. To put these figures in perspective, &pound;80 was the average payment for the surrender of copyright, a figure including Radcliffe's distorting remuneration, while her nearest competitor was Frances Burney, whose highest figure, before 1797, was the &pound;250 she received from Payne and Cadell for the copyright of <span class="italic">Cecilia</span> (Raven and others, 52). Radcliffe's rising stock is also reflected in her publishing career: from Hookham, who was associated with a circulating library, to Cadell and Davies, who were at the prestigious end of the publishing market. Before <span class="italic">The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne</span> only a handful of Gothic novels had been published; by the time <span class="italic">Udolpho</span> appeared, the genre accounted for roughly a third of all new novels. Although Horace Walpole's <span class="italic">The Castle of Otranto</span> (1764), Clara Reeve's <span class="italic">The Old English Baron</span> (1777), and Sophia Lee's <span class="italic">The Recess</span> (1783&#150;5) were Radcliffe's acknowledged models, critics were united in saying that Radcliffe had transformed her &#145;meagre&#146; materials into a new, powerful and &#145;enchanting&#146; form. Among her critics there was virtual unanimity that she stood at the head of her own school of romance. At the peak of her career, much imitated, much lauded, and very richly rewarded, Ann Radcliffe suddenly stopped publishing. She had produced five romances and a travelogue in eight years and had become one of the country's most famous novelists and was still only thirty-three.<br>
<br>Radcliffe's contemporaries were mystified by her silence. In the absence of any hard information wild rumours circulated about her, some alleging her death, others arguing that she had been driven mad by her propensity for terror. According to one story, she was confined, insane, at Haddon Hall in Derbyshire, while in 1810 the anonymous &#145;Ode to Horror&#146; represented Radcliffe as &#145;having died in that species of derangement called &#147;the horrors&#148;&#146; (Talfourd, 95; Norton, 211). Radcliffe declined the opportunity of correcting these exaggerations.<br>
<br>William Radcliffe advanced reasons for the abandonment of his wife's career. According to Talfourd, Ann Radcliffe was so much the gentlewoman that nothing other than the direst necessity could force her to assume the indecorous mantle of woman author. Her husband claimed that an inheritance relieved her from the burden of writing, an apparent reference to the legacy left her by her father after his death, on 4 July 1798, of &#145;interests in the rents of property in Houghton-on-the-hill, near Leicester&#146;  (Rogers, <span class="italic">Bio-Bibliography</span>, 11). There was also property left to her after her mother's death on 14 March 1800. Given that the same sources indicate that Ann Radcliffe began writing for pleasure, it hardly seems credible that she stopped because of her wealth. Nor is there any evidence from early on in her career that she was shy about publicity. After the success of <span class="italic">The Romance of the Forest</span>, she broke the anonymity that was still customary for novelists by appending her name to the third edition.<br>
<br>Ann Radcliffe's sensitivity to criticism appears to provide a more likely explanation. When her third romance was published in 1791, her style of writing was still relatively novel; by the mid-1790s, the market was awash with Radcliffe's imitators. Although Radcliffe herself was untouchable, those who followed her were subject to a great deal of derision. Moreover, the reviewers began to undermine Radcliffe herself, through insinuation, innuendos, and faint praise. While they did not attack her on political grounds, apart from the Jacobinical smear of being at the head of &#145;terrorist novel writing&#146;, critics did accuse her of subverting norms of gender and genre and of making such basic errors as suspending tripods from ceilings  (<span class="italic">Spirit of the Public Journals</span>, 223).<br>
<br>Although Radcliffe ceased to publish after the appearance of <span class="italic">The Italian</span> she did not stop writing. As can be seen from the book she based on her journey down the Rhine with her husband in the summer of 1794&#151;the only occasion on which she left Britain&#151;she was an inveterate travel writer. With the Napoleonic wars making foreign expeditions difficult, the Radcliffes confined their journeys to Britain, largely to the south coast. It is from the notebooks she kept to record her travels that Talfourd extracted material for his memoir.<br>
<br>Ann Radcliffe died at her home, 5 Stafford Row, Pimlico, at 2 a.m. on 7 February 1823, attended by her physician, Charles Scudamore, who cited as the cause of death the inflammation of the cerebral membranes, which he in turn linked to the asthma Radcliffe periodically suffered during the last twelve years of her life. On the basis of her commonplace book Rogers and Norton both infer that Radcliffe died of a bronchial infection exacerbated by Scudamore's prescriptions. She was buried at St George's Church, Hanover Square. No will survives, but Norton claims that William Radcliffe left a fortune of &pound;8000 on his death in 1830 at Versailles. He was attended by his second wife, formerly the Radcliffe's housekeeper, who he married in 1826.<h2>
<a name="Afterlifeandreputation"></a>Afterlife and reputation</h2>There were several posthumous works: <span class="italic">Gaston de Blondeville</span> (1826), with a prefatory memoir by Talfourd; <span class="italic">St Albans's Abbey</span>, a &#145;metrical romance&#146; (1826); and the important &#145;On the supernatural in poetry&#146; (1826). Written in dialogue form, and originally intended as an introduction to <span class="italic">Gaston de Blondeville</span>, &#145;On the supernatural in poetry&#146; is Radcliffe's fullest statement on her aesthetic practices.<br>
<br>It was only with Radcliffe's death that more information began to emerge about her, but for her modern biographers, this is where the problems begin. Two biographical sketches appeared: Talfourd's &#145;Memoir&#146;, and another in the <span class="italic">Annual Biography and Obituary, for the Year 1824</span>. The latter includes material written by William Radcliffe, while the former was produced under his close supervision, to such an extent that Talfourd complained to Mary Russell Mitford that his trouble &#145;exceeds anything that can be imagined&#146;  (Norton, 248). Both sources contain William's recollection of his wife's appearance:<blockquote>This admirable writer, whom I remember from about the time of her twentieth year, was, in her youth, of figure exquisitely proportioned; while she resembled her father, and his brother and sister, in being low of stature. Her complexion was beautiful, as was her whole countenance, especially her eyes, eyebrows, and mouth. (<span class="italic">Annual Biography and Obituary</span>, 99)</blockquote>The accounts report that Radcliffe's old-fashioned education, although good, did not include the classics, and that she delighted in having Latin and Greek works read out to her before being translated. They also relate that she was passionately fond of music and that she liked to attend the opera; she preferred to sit in the pit, where she enjoyed protection from draughts as well as from the gaze of curious onlookers. Her morbid fear of being thought forward, as regards her literary fame, preoccupies both memoirs. Indeed, the greater portion of William Radcliffe's contribution to his wife's obituary notice concerns two slights on her character that preyed on her mind throughout her life. The first was that she was thought to have claimed authorship of Joanna Baillie's <span class="italic">Plays on the Passions</span>, when these works were still anonymous; the other was that Mrs Carter, the famous bluestocking, had snubbed her. Apart from rectifying these slights, the main consequence of William Radcliffe's intervention was to protect his wife's fame by tightly controlling the information that appeared about her.<br>
<br>It is unclear whether William's management of his wife's reputation extended to the destruction of her papers. As the excerpts in Talfourd's memoir show, Radcliffe was an inveterate journal writer, yet none of her private papers survived, apart from a commonplace book covering the last period of her life, and the contract for <span class="italic">The Mysteries of Udolpho</span>. In the 1880s Christina Rossetti abandoned her attempts to write Radcliffe's life for want of material. The scarcity of information has hindered all subsequent biographies of Radcliffe. Adeline Grant wrote a substantial life of Radcliffe in the 1950s, but as it was unsupported by any evidence, its claims must be viewed with caution. Deborah D. Rogers's <span class="italic">Ann Radcliffe: a Bio-Bibliography</span> (1996) keeps scrupulously to the known facts, and is correspondingly brief. Only with the publication of Rictor Norton's <span class="italic">Mistress of Udolpho</span> has any new light been shed on Ann Radcliffe. Norton's discoveries about Radcliffe have been limited, but he has produced additional information on the career of her husband, William, and on the relatives William had omitted from his wife's biography.<br>
