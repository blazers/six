<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Anderson, Sir  (Warren) Hastings</span>  (1872&#150;1930), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at the barracks, Aldershot, on 9 January 1872, the eldest son of Lieutenant-General David Anderson, governor of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst (1886&#150;8), and temporary commander of the Aldershot garrison, and his wife, Charlotte Christina, daughter of David Anderson of St Germains, East Lothian. Hastings Anderson was educated at Marlborough College and Sandhurst. He was gazetted to his father's regiment, the Cheshire, in October 1890. Both Anderson and his father were colonels of the regiment, the son attaining that honour in 1928. Anderson served with the 2nd battalion as adjutant throughout the South African War, except for a short period in 1900 when he was appointed deputy assistant adjutant-general under the military governor of Johannesburg. He passed out of the Staff College, Camberley, in 1905, and spent four years from January 1906 at the War Office in the mobilization and training and staff duties directorates. Thereafter his career seems to have stalled. Anderson's capacities as a staff officer were never in doubt. But he never commanded soldiers in war; he did not command the Cheshire regiment. Hastings Anderson's distinguished career was spent entirely on the staff.<br>
<br>During Anderson's nine years as staff captain and major he met and then, on 16 February 1910, married Eileen Hamilton (<i>b</i>. 1887/8), the only daughter of Hamilton Osborne of Chippenham, Wiltshire. The marriage was a happy one, but there were no children. In February 1914, after three years at southern command, Anderson joined the directing staff of the Staff College as a general staff officer, grade 1 (GSO1) instructor, with the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel. In August, on the outbreak of the First World War, he went with a number of the students to France in order to finalize the details for the transport by rail of the British expeditionary force (BEF) to Mauberge. He returned to England and was posted to the western front in November as GSO1 (colonel), with the 8th division formed of regular troops from abroad under Major-General Francis Davies. In October 1915 Anderson was promoted brigadier-general, general staff in the 11th corps commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir Richard Haking. He remained with the 11th corps until September 1916, when he was transferred to 15th corps. Five months later Anderson was promoted major-general, general staff, First Army. As effective chief of staff, it was his responsibility to complete the final preparations for the attack on Vimy Ridge in April 1917. Anderson was rewarded for his part in this action with the CB in February 1918.<br>
<br>During Ludendorff's offensive in March 1918 the First Army front was held by tired divisions from the Third and Fifth armies and some Portuguese troops. The staff at headquarters in Ranchicourt were placed under great pressure, but Anderson's cool head and capacity for hard work ensured that they worked efficiently and their morale remained high. Some shells actually fell on Ranchicourt at this time, but the headquarters (unlike many others) did not retire. By July&#150;August 1918, when the initiative was seized back by the allies, Anderson, in his gentle but determined way, had forged a most efficient staff, and the advance of the First Army was continuous throughout the Last Hundred Days (September&#150;November 1918). This series of successes, so often overlooked, constitutes one of the signal triumphs of British military history.<br>
<br>It was appropriate that a soldier of Anderson's staff experience should be chosen as commandant of the Staff College on its reopening in March 1919. He held this important post for three years. Throughout his tenure he set a conservative tone to the college. Anderson was not an innovator by nature, and as a dedicated infantryman he was sceptical of the claims made by the new &#145;mechanical&#146; arms. He dedicated himself to restoring the Staff College to what he remembered were its glories before 1914. He revived social life and the drag hunt, and coped admirably with the results of four years of neglect: not least with the Staff College's perverse and troublesome hot-water system. Consequently, although Anderson was a much liked commandant, he had little impact on the staff course. The first three staff courses after the war were dull and lacklustre, and have been much criticized (especially by Field Marshal Viscount Montgomery, who was a student in 1920). This is not to suggest that Anderson was a plodding reactionary&#151;he was not. He had a real interest in military history, and gave lectures on this subject to the staff course. His later book, based on his lectures, <span class="italic">Outline of the Development of the British Army</span> (1920), reveals his strengths and limitations. It is very strong on fact, and weak on interpretation and extrapolation. Anderson's <span class="italic">Outline</span> is very typical of his unadventurous pre-1914 caste of mind.<br>
<br>In 1922 Anderson was created a KCB and appointed chief general staff officer to General Sir Charles Harington, general officer commanding-in-chief the allied army of the Black Sea. Anderson's great experience and shrewdness were valuable during the Chanak crisis. The British forces avoided war with Turkey by patience, tact, and diplomatic skill, to which Anderson contributed. The following year he was appointed deputy quartermaster-general at headquarters army in India. In March 1924 he was posted to Quetta as commander of the Baluchistan military district. He returned to England in March 1927 and received the appointment of quartermaster-general to the forces, with the rank of lieutenant-general and a seat on the army council. Anderson thus became involved in the pressing issues of mechanization and structural reform. He veered towards the conservative side of the argument. Like many senior officers of his generation he regarded the conserving of the regimental system as of a higher priority than the creation of a doctrinal revolution, based on new and unproven weapons technology. He was looked upon by some as a &#145;safe pair of hands&#146;, and a potential chief of the Imperial General Staff before his death, after an operation for appendicitis, in Queen Alexandra's Military Hospital, Millbank, London, on 10 December 1930. At the time of his death he was nominated to command Aldershot.<br>
<br>Hastings Anderson was essentially a late-Victorian gentleman, unruffled, understated, and moderate in all things. He was dignified but not pompous, and he never lost the grace which led him always to observe a gentle and chivalrous attitude towards those who worked for him. He was very fair-minded, and had an engaging sense of humour. He was devoted to the Cheshire regiment, and published <span class="italic">The History of the 22nd Cheshire Regiment, 1689&#150;1849</span> (1920). In 1927 he became a vice-president of the Society for Army Historical Research, and contributed to the first issue of its journal.<br>
