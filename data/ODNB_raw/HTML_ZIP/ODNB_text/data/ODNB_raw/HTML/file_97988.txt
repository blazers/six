</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dew,  Walter</span>  (1863&#150;1947), <span class="occ">police officer</span>, was born at Far Cotton, Northampton, on 7 April 1863, the third son among the ten children of Walter Dew (<i>c</i>.1822&#150;1884), railway guard, and his Irish-born wife, Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fisher (<i>c</i>.1832&#150;1914). The Dew family moved to London when Walter was ten years old. He left school aged thirteen, taking work in a solicitor's office and as a seed-merchant's clerk before fulfilling his ambition to work on the railways when he became a porter.<br>
<br>Dew had an &#145;instinctive dread&#146; of London policemen  (Dew, 2), but when it was suggested that he became one, he successfully applied to join the Metropolitan Police in 1882, despite his slim frame and boyish looks. After drill training at Wellington Barracks he was posted to Paddington Green in June 1882. On 15 November 1886 he married Kate (1866&#150;1927), daughter of John Morris, coachman. They had six children (one died in infancy).<br>
<br>In June 1887 Dew joined the criminal investigation department (CID), where he acquired the nickname Blue Serge on account of the suit he habitually wore. He was transferred to the dangerous Whitechapel division, and as a detective constable he was involved in the Whitechapel murders investigation. Dew suffered from insomnia and loss of appetite, the result of long working hours, the sight of the victims' remains and lack of success in catching the killer. He was only too pleased to leave the district in December 1888, never to return, and frankly admitted that he had no idea of Jack the Ripper's identity, but believed there were seven victims.<br>
<br>Dew proved to be a dependable, clever, and successful detective, steadily rising through the ranks, eventually becoming a detective chief inspector at Scotland Yard in 1906. It was suggested that his appearance and quiet, unassuming manner had contributed to his success. Soft-spoken, with a lisp and kindly eyes, he did not look like a typical policeman. He was one of the five chief inspectors at the Yard who were always available to investigate serious provincial cases. When he arrested Flora Fanny Haskell for the murder of her son in Salisbury in 1908 he was convinced of her guilt but she was acquitted after a retrial in 1909. He was more successful when Mary Robinson was imprisoned for perjury, in 1908, for her involvement in the Druce&#150;Portland inheritance case of 1907.<br>
<br>Already considering retirement in 1910, Dew took on his final and most famous case. Cora Crippen, an unsuccessful music-hall artiste, was reported missing. Her husband, Hawley Harvey Crippen, an American doctor who worked as a dentist in London, had told her family and friends that she had returned to America where she died. Cora's friends were dissatisfied with the story and Dew took up the case. He interviewed Crippen, who stated that his wife had left him for another man and the story about her dying was a lie to avoid any embarrassment. Furthermore, he admitted to having an affair with his much younger secretary, Ethel Le Neve, who was now living with him at 39 Hilldrop Crescent, Camden Town.<br>
<br>Dew searched the house but found nothing suspicious. On returning three days later, he found Crippen and Le Neve had gone. A more thorough search of the property on 13 July led to the discovery of human remains in the cellar. The missing person case was now a murder investigation. Crippen and Le Neve had fled to Belgium where they boarded the steamer <i>Montrose</i> to Canada, masquerading as father and son, with Le Neve dressed as a boy. The ship's captain, Henry George Kendall, suspected that the couple were the wanted pair and sent a wireless telegram message back to Liverpool conveying his suspicions. When Dew was informed he instinctively sensed that they were the fugitives. Taking a huge gamble he decided to pursue the <i>Montrose</i> in a faster ship, the <i>Laurentic</i>, which he boarded at Liverpool under the pseudonym Mr Dewhurst.<br>
<br>The <i>Laurentic</i> reached Canada first and on 31 July 1910 Dew boarded the <i>Montrose</i> in disguise with two Canadian police inspectors who arrested Crippen and Le Neve. Crippen was taken to the captain's cabin, where Dew met him with the salutation (subsequently quoted in many slightly varied forms of words), &#145;Good morning, Dr Crippen; I am chief inspector Dew&#146;  (Young, 42). Dew spent much time with Crippen on the return voyage, recalling &#145;there was something almost likeable about the mild little fellow&#146;  (Dew, 8). The detective was sometimes accused of being too sympathetic towards Crippen but, as he told the home secretary, Winston Churchill, &#145;I have always made it a practice to treat prisoners with courtesy &amp; consideration no matter what their position in life&#146;  (TNA: PRO, MEPO 3/198). Despite the superficially amicable relationship with the well-mannered Crippen, Dew always believed him to be guilty and &#145;a callously calculating murderer&#146;  (Dew, 8). Le Neve described Dew as &#145;a very nice man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Thomson's Weekly News</span>, 16 Oct 1920): he thought she was innocent of any involvement in the murder of Cora Crippen.<br>
<br>Having captured the couple and safely delivered them for trial at the Old Bailey under the scrutiny of the world's media, Dew was accused by the crown prosecutors, Richard Muir and Travers Humphreys, of not working hard enough in helping them prepare the case against Crippen. Dew was not surprised when Crippen was found guilty of killing his wife and executed. Le Neve was acquitted of being an accessory.<br>
<br>The worldwide press coverage of the Crippen case had made Dew possibly the most famous detective in the world and he embraced the celebrity status that remained with him for the rest of his life. He retired from the Metropolitan Police in December 1910, having been awarded an exemplary conduct certificate and around 130 commendations during his career.<br>
<br>Always sensitive to criticism, Dew successfully sued nine newspapers for libel over false claims that he had made statements to the press about the Crippen case when in Canada, and with regard to attacks on his character and conduct during the investigation. For the next seventeen years Dew worked as a confidential enquiries agent but retired soon after his wife's death in 1927. He moved to Worthing, Sussex, to a small bungalow called the Wee Hoose. On 10 December 1928 Dew married a widow, Florence Idle (1876&#150;1966), daughter of Charles Beedle, and became stepfather to her daughter Iris.<br>
<br>Dew spent his retirement years gardening and writing. Still remembered as the man who caught Crippen, Dew was sometimes asked by national newspapers to comment on high-profile crimes. Between 1934 and 1936 his memoirs were serialized in the tabloid <span class="italic">Thomson's Weekly News</span>. They were divided into three parts: the Crippen case, Jack the Ripper, and a selection of his other cases, including the arrests of international jewel thief Harry the Valet and the fraudster and bigamist Conrad Harms. In 1938 the memoirs were published in book form as <span class="italic">I Caught Crippen</span>.<br>
<br>Old age did not mellow Dew, who still sent angry letters to those who found fault with his conduct in the Crippen investigation. He died at the Wee Hoose, 10 Beaumont Road, Worthing, on 16 December 1947 from heart failure. He was buried three days later at Durrington cemetery, Worthing. His eldest son, Walter, became a special branch inspector, while another son, Stanley, was killed in the First World War.<br>
