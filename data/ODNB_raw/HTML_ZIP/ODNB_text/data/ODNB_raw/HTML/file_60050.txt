<span class="headword">Harben,  Philip Hubert Kendal Jerrold</span>  (1906&#150;1970), <span class="occ">television chef and writer on cookery</span>, was born on 17 October 1906 at 40 Perham Road, Fulham, the son of Leonard Hubert Storey Harben (1878&#150;1941) and his wife, Mary Jerrold Allen (1877&#150;1955). His parents were both actors, known as Hubert Harben and Mary Jerrold. His sister, Joan Harben, often appeared on the West End stage and was best-known for her role in the BBC radio series <span class="italic">It's that Man Again</span>, where she played the part of the lugubrious Mona Lott, famous for her catch-phrase, &#145;It's being so cheerful that keeps me going.&#146; Educated at Highgate School, Harben then went on the stage himself, and later worked with John Grierson on the documentary film <span class="italic">Drifters</span> (1929), and with Egidio Scaioni doing studio and fashion photography. On 19 July 1930 he married Katharine Joyce Kenyon (<i>b</i>. 1906/7), and they had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Far from being a chef, Harben never had a formal cookery lesson, but learned to cook because his parents were so often absent while on tour, leaving him to fend for himself in the kitchen. He developed a curiosity about the processes of cooking, and was technically so proficient that his friend Raymond Postgate, the author of the original <span class="italic">Good Food Guide</span>, referred to him for answers to most technical questions. A member of the avant-garde intellectual left, in 1937 Harben was cooking and running the kitchen at The Isobar, in the basement of the Isokon building, Wells Coates's architecturally advanced block of flats in Lawn Road, Hampstead.<br>
<br>Harben and Postgate founded the Half Hundred Dining Club, &#145;a poor man's food and wine society&#146;. The club had twenty-five members each of whom could bring one guest, hence the half-hundred. The club's aim was to combine &#145;good dining with economy&#146;. Members, who included Julian Huxley, Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer, Ernst Freud, and Francis Meynell, took it in turn to &#145;direct&#146; the dinner, which could involve anything from planning the menu and getting someone else to cook it, to doing the whole task&#151;buying the ingredients and wine and cooking and serving the meal. A &#145;blurb&#146; was required from the director, and could be anything from a simple menu to a full-blown mission statement. As each member and guest paid a strictly budgeted total of only 10<i>s</i>. (2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. for food, 5<i>s</i>. for wine, and 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. for service), anything over had to come from the director's own pocket. Harben and Postgate laid down serious criteria for membership: election had to be unanimous and candidates had to profess that they were seriously interested in food and drink with &#145;no religious or other taboos or unsociable characteristics which may impede conversation&#146;  (www.lib.uea.ac.uk/libinfo/archives/pritchard/pp39ch.htm). The club ceased in 1940, though there was a failed attempt to revive it after the Second World War. When the war was over he was canteen manager for British Overseas Airways Corporation, where he came to the attention of the BBC. His first broadcasting work was radio cookery demonstrations after the eight o'clock news.<br>
<br>When BBC television resumed in June 1946 Harben was chosen to front a cookery programme. He was not the first cook on British television (that distinction went to Marcel Boulestin in 1937), but he was generally thought of as the first of the British breed of that hybrid creature&#151;part entertainer, part teacher. Plump, bearded, and genial, with a racy delivery, his initial BBC television series, <span class="italic">Cookery</span>, ran from 1946 to 1951. The most bizarre turn required of him was on a programme celebrating Boulestin, when a 1939 sound recording was played of the Frenchman preparing his speciality, the Boulestin omelette. Harben, &#145;the new culinary star, mimed in vision, with split-second timing&#146;, as the eggs were whisked and the butter sizzled in the pan. This was followed by &#145;verbal homage from a master of the Science of cookery to the master of its Art&#146;, wrote Mary Adams, in a postscript to Harben's obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span>  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 April 1970).<br>
<br>In 1950 Harben presented <span class="italic">Cookery Lesson</span> for the BBC. There were several one-off cookery shows in 1952&#150;3, including one late in 1953 called <span class="italic">An Evening's Diversion of Elizabethan TV</span>, in which, instead of wearing his usual stout butcher's apron, he cooked in a costume that featured a white ruff, doublets, and hose. In 1956 he had another series, <span class="italic">What's Cooking?</span> Rationing ended in 1954; before that, it had been difficult even for television cooks to provision their programmes, and it was said that he had sometimes used his own rations to make the programme. Audiences were drawn by his professional-looking skill, his assurance, and his evident pleasure in preparing good food, as well by his clubbable personality.<br>
<br>Harben was not a fraud, like Fanny Cradock, who soon followed him on the television screen, or a mere entertainer, like so many later television cooks; but he had his own lighter moments. Television shows were, of course, live in these years. One well-attested story has him going to the oven to retrieve a dish and saying, &#145;Well, they're not quite ready yet. Goodbye everybody.&#146; Asked why he'd finished the programme when there were still several minutes to go, he explained, &#145;It wouldn't have done any good. I forgot to switch on the oven&#146;  (www.bbc.co.uk/thenandnow/wac_snippets).<br>
<br>As a journalist Harben achieved an unusual stature for a writer of recipes. Along with Correlli Barnett and Katharine Whitehorn he wrote in the post-war <span class="italic">Women's Own</span>. According to Harry Diamond, the sub-editor who handled his copy, his recipes were &#145;eagerly awaited each week by countless breathless housewives&#146;. Once Diamond had to cut &#145;three or four completely superfluous words&#146; from a Harben recipe to make the copy fit the layout, and &#145;an irate Mr. Harben phoned to speak to the &#147;stupid fucking idiot&#148; who had ruthlessly reduced his recipe to unintelligible rubbish&#146;. The editor consequently relieved Diamond of responsibility for the recipe column  (www.geocities.com/henry_diamond).<br>
<br>In 1955 Harben was appointed &#145;cookery ambassador extraordinary&#146; to the government, and even sent to America to praise British cooking. (This was an era before Britain had got its bad reputation for food and cooking, a time when an American publisher could still sell copies of Samuel Chamberlain's nearly 600-page 1963 gastronomic vade-mecum, <span class="italic">British Bouquet</span>.) His Penguin book, <span class="italic">Cooking</span> (1960), explained the subject from what was then thought to be a scientific angle. In his last years he lived at 81 Albion Gate, on the Bayswater Road in west London. Harben died on 27 April 1970 at St Mary's Hospital, Harrow Road, Paddington, from cerebral softening due to cerebral atherosclerosis. His wife survived him. He was buried in Highgate cemetery.<br>
