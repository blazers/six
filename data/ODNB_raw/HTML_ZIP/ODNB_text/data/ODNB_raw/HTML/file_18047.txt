<span class="headword">Margaret</span> <span class="st"> [Margaret of Scotland]</span>  (1424&#150;1445), <span class="occ">dauphine of France</span>, was the eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14587/', "James I (1394&#150;1437)")</script>, king of Scots, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14646/', "Queen Joan (d. 1445)")</script>. Her parents were married in February 1424 and her birth can be assigned to the latter part of the same year. In 1428 she and her sisters were given into the care of Michael Ramsay, the keeper of Lochmaben Castle, Dumfriesshire, while the king and queen travelled to Inverness. At the age of three she assumed significance in her father's diplomacy. An embassy arrived from Charles VII of France in July 1428 to renew the alliance with Scotland. It was empowered to ask for Margaret's hand in marriage for the dauphin, Louis (1423&#150;1483), himself born only in July 1423. In return the French wanted an army of 6000 men. The prospect of an alliance with the French royal house raised the status of James and the Stewart dynasty, but the king was not prepared to commit himself to Charles VII for nearly eight years, while Charles too hesitated after his increased success against England from 1429. Meanwhile James used the proposed alliance to negotiate from strength with both England and France, and the possibility of a match between Henry VI and either Margaret or one of her sisters was also mooted. It was not until 1435, after this threat of an Anglo-Scottish alliance had been raised, that the marriage of Margaret to the dauphin was finally agreed. In March 1436 Margaret departed from Dumbarton with an escort of major lords, a 140-strong household in royal livery, and an &#145;army&#146; of 1200. She sailed in a French fleet, arriving on the &Icirc;le de R&eacute;, near La Rochelle, on 17 April. From there she made a formal progress to Tours, where she married the dauphin on 25 June in the chapel of the castle.<br>
<br>As dauphine, Margaret was committed to the keeping of Queen Marie of France, wife of Charles VII. After the wedding her Scottish household and following were sent home, the French perhaps remembering the demands and disruption arising from earlier Scottish forces in France. Margaret was allowed just a few Scottish attendants, and may have been provided with her own household only in 1437, when her marriage to the dauphin was consummated. The murder of her father in the same year meant that until her death she was heir presumptive of her young brother, James II. The active role of the dauphine in France was limited. Contemporary accounts of her poor relations with her husband probably have some basis. Comparisons of her beauty with his ugliness may be offset by remarks&#151;admittedly made by English chroniclers&#151;about the dauphin's being unable to stand her &#145;evil-savoured breath&#146;. One of the dauphin's complaints in his revolt of 1440 against his father was the lack of revenue assigned to his wife, but Margaret seems to have remained on good terms with the king and to have received grants directly from him rather than her husband. She acted as a mediator between King Charles and the city of Metz, and in 1444&#150;5 attended the celebration of the marriage of Margaret of Anjou and Henry VI of England. Her public role in France was restricted to these formal interventions and appearances at court ceremonial. Attempts to place her in court politics overplay the evidence.<br>
<br>However, the dauphine became the subject of criticism, instigated, according to later speculation, by her husband. Suggestions that she deliberately prolonged her childlessness through her diet and clothing, and accusations of immorality with members of her household, were made at the French court, and in July 1445 Margaret's relations with Queen Marie became strained in a dispute over the arrangements for their households. In this atmosphere Margaret became ill on 7 August with what was diagnosed as a brain infection which led to ulceration of the lungs. Her reported comments during her illness suggest that her health had been affected by the criticisms, and she was heard to say that she regretted coming to France. On 16 August 1445, at the age of twenty, Margaret died at Ch&acirc;lons-sur-Marne and she was buried in the cathedral of St &Eacute;tienne in the city. Her wish to lie at the abbey of Thouars, where she had founded a chapellany, was fulfilled by her husband, now Louis XI, only in 1479.<br>
<br>Much of Margaret's significance derives from her role as a patroness of poets and, reputedly, as a poet herself. One later account ascribed her death to the strain of too many poetic vigils. Although nothing survives which can be proved as her work, as dauphine Margaret was surrounded by a group of poets in her household, including the viscount of Blosseville and one of her ladies, Jehanne Filleul, whose extant works do survive. Margaret's father, James I, certainly shared an interest in literary pursuits, and two of her sisters, Isabella and Eleanor, were similarly patrons and artists within the European princely houses. Margaret's influence is suggested by the existence of three different laments for the dauphine, all composed shortly after her death. One was written by de Blosseville, while another appears in the possession of, and was possibly written by, her sister Isabella. The third account, found in a French manuscript, was incorporated into the <span class="italic">Liber pluscardensis</span>, a Scottish chronicle, pointing to Franco-Scottish cultural ties.<br>
<br>Margaret's importance apart from literature lay in her position as the crucial link between the Stewarts and continental royalty. Her marriage related her brother and sisters to the house of Valois, and from 1440 the Scots exploited this fact. A whole range of prestigious unions followed. Isabella was married to Fran&ccedil;ois, duke of Brittany, in 1442, Mary to the lord of Veere in Zeeland in 1444, and Eleanor, initially proposed as a second wife for the dauphin, married Sigismund, count of Tyrol, in 1447. The Scots relied on the French to make matches for Margaret's sisters, and sent out Eleanor and Joanna for this purpose in 1445. Scotland was able to enter the international marriage market, its efforts culminating in James II's wedding to Mary of Gueldres, niece of Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, in 1449. If Margaret's marriage produced no half-Scottish kings of France, it raised the prestige of the Stewarts as a dynasty of European consequence.<br>
