<span class="headword">Mandeville,  Bernard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1670, <em>d.</em> 1733), <span class="occ">physician and political philosopher</span>, was baptized in Rotterdam on 20 November 1670, the second child of Michael de Mandeville (<i>bap</i>. 1639, <i>d</i>. 1704/5) a leading physician in Rotterdam, and his wife, Judith, daughter of Bernard Verhaar, captain in the Rotterdam admiralty.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandeducation"></a>Early life and education</h2>Notwithstanding the particle (which Bernard dropped when he settled in England), no French ancestry has been traced for the de Mandevilles. They were an established Netherlandish professional family. At least some members of each generation were university-educated back to the sixteenth century. Bernard's great-great-grandfather Johannes de Mandeville can be traced to Leeuwarden in Friesland about 1580. His great-grandfather Michael de Mandeville studied medicine at the University of Franeker; he was appointed city physician and rector of the Latin school in Nijmegen in 1601. His grandfather Immanuel de Mandeville studied law at Leiden, nevertheless succeeding his father as city physician. Bernard's father, Michael, having studied law as well as qualified in medicine at Leiden, was appointed plague doctor in Nijmegen in 1666. After his marriage to Judith Verhaar in July 1667, the couple moved to Rotterdam. Michael established a (successful) medical practice and held the offices of city physician, regent of the hospital (1679&#150;87), lieutenant of the Rotterdam militia (1673&#150;5, 1686&#150;91), and a minor judicial position in the dependency of Schieland.<br>
<br>The young Mandeville attended the Erasmian School, Rotterdam; he is likely to have heard the two notable French protestant exiles, Pierre Bayle and Pierre Jurieu, appointed professors of the Illustrious School in Rotterdam. In <span class="italic">De medicina oratio scholastica</span> (1685), he announced his intention of studying medicine. Matriculating in October 1685 at the University of Leiden, he studied philosophy and medicine until 1690. His doctoral thesis in philosophy, <span class="italic">Disputatio philosophica de brutorum operationibus</span> (1689), adopted the Cartesian view of animals as automata which he later rejected. He returned briefly in 1691 to present his medical thesis, <span class="italic">Disputatio medica inauguralis de chylosi vitiata</span>, which dealt with the process of digestion and its effects on the brain&#151;hypochondria and hysteria were Mandeville's medical specialism.<br>
<br>In the preface to the revised versions of his <span class="italic">Treatise of the Hypochondriack and Hysterick Diseases</span> (1730, xiii), Mandeville claimed that he went to London to learn English, found it agreeable, and stayed. But it seems likely that there were other reasons for his decision to emigrate. In 1690 he and his father (who had connections with the anti-Orangist, republican states party) had been involved in the Costerman riot in Rotterdam. The city bailiff, Jacob Van Zuijlen van Nievelt, had prosecuted and executed Costerman, a citizen member of the militia, for killing (with his sword) a tax agent who had discovered a group drinking untaxed wine. On 5 October, verses written by the de Mandevilles, denouncing the bailiff as a hypocritical &#145;sanctimonious atheist&#146; and petty tyrant, were posted at the merchants' exchange. This ridicule was concerted with an attack upon and partial destruction of the bailiff's house. The city government dismissed Van Zuijlen from his office the following day. But the provincial government and then the stadholder, William of Orange, intervened. Van Zuijlen was restored to office (1692) and took revenge on his enemies. In 1693 Michael de Mandeville was banished; he moved to Amsterdam to set up in practice there. Bernard would have found his prospects adversely affected by having to establish himself in the very competitive medical environment of Amsterdam. By 17 November 1693 he was sufficiently known in London medical circles to have been summoned to appear by the Royal College of Physicians for practising without a licence. Latin verses, &#145;In authorem de usu interno cantharidum scribentem&#146;, contributed to <span class="italic">Tutus cantharidum in medicina usus internus</span> (1698), by Johannes Groenevelt, a Dutch physician and surgeon prosecuted for malpractice by the college, indicate Mandeville's continued hostility to its authority. (He remained unlicensed.) On 1 February 1699 he married Ruth Elizabeth Laurence (<i>b</i>. 1673/4), who was twenty-five years of age, at St Giles-in-the-Fields, Westminster, London. Their first child, Michael, was born on 1 March 1699; the date of the birth of their daughter, Penelope, is not known.<h2>
<a name="Earlywritings"></a>Early writings</h2>Mandeville seems to have wished to establish himself as an author, first attempting to launch a career through verse; <span class="italic">The Pamphleteers</span> (1703), which defended William III's memory against his (tory) detractors, was followed by translations of La Fontaine's fables (<span class="italic">Some Fables after the Easie and Familiar Method of Monsieur de la Fontaine</span>, 1703; enlarged to <span class="italic">Aesop Dress'd</span>, 1704) and a burlesque epic, <span class="italic">Typhon</span> (1704), after Paul Scarron. <span class="italic">The Grumbling Hive</span> (1705), a 423-line verse fable deprecating the grumbling of the English (incorporated into <span class="italic">The Fable of the Bees</span> in 1714) followed. The wealthy, powerful bees of a hive discontentedly grumbled about the prevalent vices&#151;these disgruntled bees being themselves as guilty of the deceits in their own callings as those of which they complained. Granted their prayers, the bees become virtuous. Consequently their wealth and numbers decline. The moral is that vice is beneficial when it is restricted by justice:<blockquote>
<div>they, that would revive<br>
</div>
<div>A Golden Age, must be as free<br>
</div>
<div>For Acorns, as for Honesty<br>
</div> (Mandeville, <span class="italic">Fable</span>, 1.37)</blockquote>These efforts being (apparently) unsuccessful, Mandeville turned to prose. <span class="italic">The Virgin Unmask'd</span> (1709) consisted of dialogues between &#145;an elderly maiden aunt&#146; and her niece. The initial suggestion of a pornographic content quickly disappeared as the discussion turned to the undesirability of marriage and the harmful effects of child bearing on women, two proto-novels, and a discussion of the dangers posed by Louis XIV to Europe's peace and security. Next Mandeville disguised himself as sisters, Lucinda and Artesia, who were members of the &#145;Society of Ladies&#146; which took over the <span class="italic">Female Tatler</span> (1709&#150;10), an imitator of Richard Steele's <span class="italic">Tatler</span>, from its original author, Mrs Crackenthorpe (probably Thomas Baker). Mandeville wrote thirty-two issues from November 1709 to the end of March 1710. These papers foreshadowed his later works in asserting that the main engine of social development had not been those who pursued virtue, learning, and the public interest (as Steele claimed in <span class="italic">The Tatler</span>), but rather those &#145;who by the Sollicitous Care they take of their Backs and Bellies, make Money Circulate, and are the real Encouragers of every useful Art and Science&#146;  (Mandeville, <span class="italic">Society of Ladies</span>, 105). Other issues discussed &#145;honour&#146; and the eligibility of a life devoted to money-making. Perhaps most notable are eight issues, again responding to <span class="italic">The Tatler</span>, devoted to contending that women are as capable as men of achieving the cardinal virtues, leading armies, and governing states. To support this view Mandeville cited numerous examples, modern as well as classical, biblical, and mythical, many derived (without acknowledgement and often nearly verbatim) from the English translation of Pierre le Moyne's <span class="italic">La gallerie des femmes fortes</span> (1647) as <span class="italic">The Gallery of Heroick Women</span> (1652).<br>
<br>Mandeville returned to his professional specialism for his next work, <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Hypochondriack and Hysterick Passions</span> (1711). In a set of dialogues between a physician and several patients, Mandeville used a classically educated hypochondriacal patient, Misomedon, to describe the history of his ailment and the (failed) attempts to cure it by physicians addicted to various speculative theories. He gave details of and criticized the remedies prescribed by apothecaries as well as by physicians. The medical practitioner, Philopirio, reveals an adherence to &#145;medical materialism&#146;, denigrating theoretical medicine while praising extensive, careful empirical observation, in opposition to the training in the traditional English universities. The book presumably illustrates Mandeville's own practice, with its extensive &#145;talking cure&#146; of the patient backed by the recommendations of exercise along with moderation in food and drink. Part of the point of the book's publication was to advertise Mandeville's practice&#151;that itself was a rejection of the authority and standards of the Royal College of Physicians. (Of all his publications in England, it was only in this work, and in its 1715 reissue as a &#145;second edition&#146;, that he subscribed himself &#145;de Mandeville&#146;, presumably to enhance his social status.) A variant title-page of the 1711 edition reveals that Mandeville was then living in Manchester Court, Channel Row, Westminster. A letter written by Mandeville to the well-known physician Sir Hans Sloane (after 4 April 1718) suggests that Mandeville achieved a reasonably successful practice. Philopirio's remarks on his own supposed character in <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Hypochondriack and Hysterick Diseases</span> (the enlarged and retitled 1730 printings, pp. 351&#150;2) may depict Mandeville. If so, he presents himself as too devoted to his enjoyments and diversions to &#145;slave at an Employment&#146;  (ibid.) as well as not being especially acquisitive.<h2>
<a name="TheFableoftheBees"></a>The Fable of the Bees</h2>At least one of Mandeville's diversions remained writing and publishing. A small collection of verses in English and Latin appeared as <span class="italic">Wishes to a Godson</span> (1712). It was followed by his notorious <span class="italic">The Fable of the Bees, or, Private Vices, Publick Benefits</span> (1714). This first edition of the <span class="italic">Fable</span> was composed of a short preface, &#145;The Grumbling Hive&#146; of 1705, a very brief introduction, &#145;An enquiry into the origin of moral virtue&#146;, and twenty &#145;remarks&#146; which purported to annotate and explain various lines in the verse fable.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Fable</span> anatomizes human nature, alleging that their &#145;vilest and most hateful Qualities&#146;, their passions, render humans sociable animals and make them &#145;fit for the largest, and according to the World, the happiest and most flourishing Societies&#146;  (Mandeville, <span class="italic">Fable</span>, 1.3&#150;4). Here Mandeville explicitly refers to Montaigne and apparently relies on exponents of the French Augustinian tradition, such as Pascal, La Rochefoucauld, Jacques Esprit, Pierre Nicole, and Pierre Bayle, who emphasized the worldly benefits of the passions. While claiming that almost every profession and calling is marked with its peculiar vices, that the vile ingredients result in a wholesome mixture, and that wealth, power, and politeness are incompatible with innocence and virtue, Mandeville denied (as he was repeatedly to do throughout his works) that he was commending vice. On the contrary, he claimed that he did not recommend vice to individuals, that he exhorted governments to punish crimes and regulate trade, and that he was deprecating the implicit hypocrisy of those who desired a flourishing society but grumbled about its concomitant conditions. Only if London were less flourishing would the streets be cleaner; their dirtiness was a necessary evil. Mandeville admitted that he would prefer to walk in a garden or a grove rather than a &#145;stinking&#146; London street; and &#145;true Happiness&#146;, he conceded, was more probable in a &#145;small peaceable Society&#146; than in a great warlike commercial nation. But this was so only if one laid aside considerations of &#145;the interest or happiness of the city&#146; and all worldly greatness  (ibid., 1.6&#150;13).<br>
<br>The &#145;Enquiry into the origin of moral virtue&#146; reiterates the <span class="italic">Female Tatler</span>'s rejection of the distinctiveness and dignity of human nature, with its emphasis on rationality, which Mandeville continued to attribute to Richard Steele. Its version of the origin of morality and society transmutes the discussion in the <span class="italic">Female Tatler</span>. There Mandeville had pitted an Augustinian-Hobbesian view, which emphasized the inherent strife that resulted from conflicting desires, against one that attributed the improving of mankind to public-spirited benefactors. Both were then trumped by the &#145;Oxford gentleman&#146;, who credited civilization to those who invented new luxurious desires as well as seeking to satisfy existing ones. The Augustinian-Hobbesian self-interested element of human nature is retained in the &#145;Enquiry&#146; which opens the <span class="italic">Fable</span>. But Mandeville now suggested that &#145;skilful Politicians&#146; (moralists, lawgivers, and philosophers) had persuaded humans to sacrifice their selfish desires for the praises of others, thus enhancing their good opinions of themselves as virtuous superior beings: &#145;This was (or at least might have been) how Savage Man was broke&#146;  (Mandeville, <span class="italic">Fable</span>, 1.46). The &#145;first Rudiments of Morality, broach'd by skilful Politicians&#146; had resulted from distinguishing vice, that is, indulging one's appetites, from virtue: &#145;every Performance, by which Man, contrary to the impulse of Nature, should endeavour the Benefit of others, or the Conquest of his own Passions out of a Rational Ambition of being good&#146;  (ibid., 42&#150;9). Thus &#145;the Moral Virtues are the Political Offspring which Flattery begot on Pride&#146;  (ibid., 51). The procedure can be observed in the training of children into proper behaviour, whether it be Miss Mollie being taught to curtsy or a boy learning the manners of a gentleman; the results can be equally observed in the ambitions of heroes like Caesar and Alexander  (ibid., 53&#150;5). Ultimately, in order to judge human conduct, it is necessary to reveal the motives and passions that produce it.<br>
<br>The &#145;remarks&#146; further illustrate Mandeville's main contentions (remarks are here denoted by the letters in editions from 1723 rather than those of 1714). Pride, the desire to be thought well of, features in several of them. For example, remark R examines honour and in particular courage. Natural courage occurs when the passion of anger overcomes that of fear. Sociable relations, however, require that fear be strengthened in order to inhibit aggression and at the same time that a substitute for natural courage be provided so that society can be defended. Thus the passions of pride and shame are harnessed to produce &#145;Artificial Courage&#146;. More generally, Mandeville contrasted &#145;ancient&#146; and &#145;modern&#146; honour. Ancient honour was a &#145;massy&#146; chivalrous compound of courage, honesty, justice, and other virtues. By contrast, modern honour was new-minted on the basis of pride; with the same weight of courage, half the quantity of honesty, and a very little justice, but not a scrap of any other virtue. Modern honour was much more &#145;portable&#146; than ancient had been. Yet &#145;such as it is there would be no living without it in a large nation&#146;: a man of honour may never go back on his word; he must pay his gambling debts but may put off other creditors; he must protect any woman entrusted to his care but may act as he pleases toward others. He must also fight if insulted; and the resulting practice of duelling, Mandeville pointed out, had effectively curtailed verbal abuse. Honour may be contrary to religion, but it is far easier to achieve than virtue&#151;that requires restraining many passions with little apparent reward; honour requires less restraint and is immediately recompensed by pride  (Mandeville, <span class="italic">Fable</span>, 1.198&#150;223).<br>
<br>Pride is also a passion that promotes luxury. If everything beyond bare subsistence is luxury, then even &#145;naked Savages&#146;, having made some improvement in their way of life, are luxurious&#151;&#145;in one Sense every Thing may be call'd [luxurious], and in another there is no such Thing&#146;. What is thought to be luxurious is relative to a person's position. Far from being a danger to society, luxury is inseparable from a wealthy, flourishing nation. Moreover, whatever the situation of the rich, the &#145;working slaving People&#146; will be sufficiently hardy for soldiering  (remark L, Mandeville, <span class="italic">Fable</span>, 1.107&#150;23). Continuous refinement in dress, diet, habitation, and ornament is driven by pride, for humans will aspire to emulate their betters, who will in turn adopt new fashions  (ibid., remark M, 124&#150;34; see also D, 80&#150;81). The famous frugality of the Dutch, Mandeville argues, actually stems from their paucity of natural resources and the heavy taxes they pay in order to protect themselves from the sea. Moreover, the virtue of frugality is not apparent in their extravagant expenditure on untaxed goods, while the government actually encourages the luxury and extravagance of seamen arriving in port after long voyages  (ibid., remark Q, 181&#150;98). The other great example of a virtuous simplicity and hardiness, Sparta, provides a model not desired by the English  (ibid., remark X, 246&#150;7).<br>
<br>Remark P explicitly elaborates the suggestion that there has been a gradual evolution of human society from simplicity to opulence, that luxuries formerly available only to the very rich, such as a white linen shirt, have become common even among the poorest. Many distinct operations must be combined to produce such items. Humans have developed such processes as brewing and baking, even without full knowledge of the chemistry involved  (Mandeville, <span class="italic">Fable</span>, 1.169&#150;73). Among those luxuries now enjoyed even by the poor is eating meat, which clearly requires pain and suffering to animals structurally similar to humans  (ibid., 172&#150;6). This leads Mandeville to an attack on human pretensions to superiority over animals in a dialogue between a lion and a Roman merchant  (ibid., 176&#150;81).<br>
<br>Many of the remarks explain how contraries are mutually dependent. Avarice and prodigality, prostitution and chastity, protestantism and Roman Catholic reform, the Church of England and learning in the sects, all depend on each other. Society itself is like a punch: a mixture balancing individually unpleasant elements  (remark K, Mandeville, <span class="italic">Fable</span>, 1.105&#150;6). Every calling and trade exhibits the human vices of self-interest and pride. Decio, the sugar dealer, vies with Alcander, a West India merchant&#151;each seeking to get the best of the bargain by relying on information not known to the other  (ibid., remark B, 61&#150;3). Merchants rely on secret marks, hiding the real cost of goods from their customers  (ibid., remark D, 80&#150;1). The apparently lazy porter who refuses to take a letter to Bow for a penny is astonishingly the messenger willingly to rise from his bed on a stormy winter night to run to Hackney and back with a bill of exchange for a crown  (ibid., remark V, 240&#150;1). Self-denying virtue is a pretence: the real human pleasures are sensual and worldly ones. John claims he loves pudding, but eats as little as possible while devouring the beef. Mandeville asserted he could outdo the Stoics in contemning riches for a tenth of Seneca's wealth, as well as teaching &#145;the way to his <i>Summum bonum</i> as exactly as I could my way home&#146;  (ibid., remark O, 147&#150;68). Mandeville's claim to anatomize human nature and society meant tracing human actions to their motivating passions and showing how luxury and even such evils such as drunkenness, theft, and prostitution contributed to the wealth, power, and worldly happiness of a trading society. Not only moral but also natural evils like the great London fire (1666), it was suggested, produced some good.<h2>
<a name="TheFablesnotoriety"></a>The Fable's notoriety</h2>The <span class="italic">Fable</span>, notwithstanding its having two printings in 1714, attracted little immediate attention. Later in the year Mandeville published <span class="italic">The Mischiefs that Ought Justly to be Apprehended from a Whig-Government</span> (1714), a minor, anonymous pamphlet defending the Hanoverian succession. In 1720 a more substantial work, <span class="italic">Free Thoughts on Religion, the Church, and National Happiness</span> urged toleration while objecting to priestcraft and exhibiting anti-clerical attitudes: the clergy, and especially those of a state church, had an interest in inciting hostility between religious denominations. In the book Mandeville relied heavily on Pierre Bayle, in fact transcribing substantial passages. <span class="italic">Free Thoughts</span> maintained a moderate whiggish position. While passive obedience was required to the sovereign authority in all states, in Britain this authority was the triune king, lords, and commons. The book was reissued in 1721 and 1723 with a second edition in 1729; it was also published in French (1722, 1723, 1729, and 1738), in Dutch (1723), and in German (1726).<br>
<br>In 1723 Mandeville published a second edition of the <span class="italic">Fable</span>, enlarging the remarks, including for example in remark G the contention that even thieves contribute to the public good as well as both a denunciation of gin (&#145;this Liquid Poison&#146;) and a demonstration of its benefits by &#145;a sharp-sighted good humour'd Man&#146;  (Mandeville, <span class="italic">Fable</span>, 1.86&#150;93). He also added &#145;An essay on charity and charity schools&#146; (hostile to them and their sponsors) and &#145;A search into the nature of society&#146; (against the third earl of Shaftesbury's moral and aesthetic philosophy and its contention that virtue is natural to humans). His notoriety and his success as an author was guaranteed by the presentation of this edition by a Middlesex grand jury for denigrating virtue and religion as harmful to society and recommending vices as beneficial to it. Middlesex grand juries were selected by London sheriffs, themselves elected by the City's livery companies. The sheriffs involved, elected unopposed in 1722, were both tories. Accordingly the grand jury was predominantly tory and crypto-Jacobite. On 3 July, at the height of a shrieval election hotly contested between tories and opposition whigs, the grand jury had presented the letters of Cato (John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon, &#145;country&#146; whigs) in the <span class="italic">British Journal</span>. Trenchard had attacked high-church charity schools as being Jacobite. He was censured for reflecting on the government and the Church of England. Presenting the <span class="italic">Fable</span> on 8 July along with Cato (for a second time) appears to have been an attempt to reconcile &#145;country&#146; whigs with tories in attacking the existing Walpole ministry by denouncing a &#145;court whig&#146;. Mandeville replied with &#145;A vindication of the book&#146; in the <span class="italic">London Journal</span> (10 August 1723)&#151;a government-supported newspaper. The &#145;Vindication&#146; reproduced the grand jury's presentment, along with what Mandeville labelled &#145;An abusive letter to Lord <i>C</i>&#146; which denigrated the <span class="italic">Fable</span>, before defending the book by reiterating many of its themes and quoting some of its most offensive passages, while denying that it advocated vice rather than exposed its ubiquity in the world. The &#145;Vindication&#146; was immediately reissued in a format matching that of the <span class="italic">Fable</span> and then incorporated in subsequent editions.<br>
<br>Mandeville's immunity from prosecution in 1723 and when the <span class="italic">Fable</span> was again presented in 1728 may well have been due to his political connections. He is known to have been on good terms with Thomas Parker, earl of Macclesfield (1666&#150;1732); a letter from Mandeville to the former lord chancellor (in 1726) reports details of Mandeville's son's illness and refers familiarly to Macclesfield's family  (Mandeville, <span class="italic">Fable</span>, 1.xxvi&#150;xxvii; letter reproduced facing p. xxvii).<br>
<br>There were further editions of <span class="italic">The Fable of the Bees</span> during Mandeville's life in 1724, 1725, 1728, 1729, and 1732. <span class="italic">A modest defence of publick stews, or, An essay upon whoring as it is now practis'd in these kingdoms</span> (1724), which advocates a scheme of public houses of prostitution, is generally attributed to Mandeville, partly on the basis of remark H of the <span class="italic">Fable</span>, which notes the wisdom of the Amsterdam authorities in tolerating &#145;Temples of Venus&#146; complete with organ music. Nevertheless the attribution has not been firmly established, especially since the <span class="italic">Modest Defence</span> was entered in the Stationers' register (13 July 1724) to Lawrence Lefever, who signed &#145;Law Lafevre&#146;  (Goldsmith, <span class="italic">Private Vices</span>, 149&#150;50). Mandeville also published some short essays in the <span class="italic">St James's Journal</span> (20 April, 1 May 1723) and the <span class="italic">British Journal</span> (27 April&#150;4 May 1725). The latter were collected and published as <span class="italic">An enquiry into the causes of the frequent executions at Tyburn, and, A proposal for some regulations concerning felons in prison, and the good effects to be expected from them</span> (1725).<h2>
<a name="Laterworks"></a>Later works</h2>
<span class="italic">The Fable of the Bees, Part II</span> (1729) &#145;by the Author of the First&#146;, was in fact an entirely new work. In six dialogues Mandeville has Cleomenes persuade Horatio that the <span class="italic">Fable</span> is an entirely moral and religious work which has been grossly misrepresented. In addition to explaining and defending the <span class="italic">Fable</span> and quoting a number of passages from it, the work develops an extensive &#145;conjectural history&#146; of how human beings developed from savagery to civilization. Now postulating two basic instinctive drives, self-love (the desires aiming at self-preservation) and self-liking (replacing pride and shame), Mandeville explained how society, language, and the arts and sciences gradually developed over a long period of time. Humans came to live together to defend themselves against wild animals; they then developed restrictions on their actions to control the conflicts arising from their striving for superiority over each other; the third step to society was the invention of written language. It turns out that the material arrangements and social institutions at which humans have arrived have been the result of the &#145;joynt Labour of many Ages&#146; rather than of the literal machinations of &#145;skilful politicians&#146;  (Goldsmith, <span class="italic">Private Vices</span>, 63&#150;77). Both Cleomenes' account of the development of civilization from savagery and his naturalistic explanation of the origins of religion implicitly undermine the literal truth of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Horatio challenges Cleomenes, Mandeville's designated spokesman, to explain how there can be savage peoples if all humans originated from a single source  (Mandeville, <span class="italic">Fable</span>, 2.196&#150;9) and accuses him of inconsistency in accepting Moses's divine inspiration and the miracle of Adam and Eve, created as perfect humans with language, while rejecting the equally fabulous pagan myths  (ibid., 306&#150;12). There were further editions of <span class="italic">Part II</span> in 1730 and 1733. After that the <span class="italic">Fable</span> and <span class="italic">Part II</span> were published as if they were a single work in two volumes.<br>
<br>Mandeville went on to produce a further set of dialogues between the same interlocutors: <span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Origin of Honour, and, The Usefulness of Christianity in War</span> (1732). In the book Mandeville repeated his view that the passions of pride and shame are both forms of self-liking. Honour and (worldly) religion are treated as devices that are useful for socializing humans. Honour is discovered to be even less demanding than virtue or the artificial courage discussed in the <span class="italic">Fable of the Bees</span>. The work again reveals Mandeville's anti-clericalism in his account of how a perverted version of the truly peaceful doctrine of Christianity can be used to motivate soldiers.<br>
<br>Mandeville's last work was a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">A Letter to Dion, Occasion'd by his Book call'd &#145;Alciphron&#146;, or, &#145;The Minute Philosopher&#146;</span> (1732). In the second dialogue in his <span class="italic">Alciphron</span> (1732), George Berkeley had lampooned Mandeville through Lysicles, a conceited but intellectually shallow, antinomian freethinker and atheist. Not only did the <span class="italic">Letter</span> contend that Berkeley was mistaken about the views expressed in the <span class="italic">Fable of the Bees</span>, which Mandeville reiterated, contending that they were entirely consistent with strict morality and true Christianity, but also it maintained that a person of Berkeley's intelligence and character could only have so mischaracterized the doctrine of the <span class="italic">Fable</span> because he had accepted common reports of the work rather than actually having read it himself.<h2>
<a name="Death"></a>Death</h2>On 21 January 1733 Mandeville died in Hackney, possibly of influenza. His will, dated 2 April 1729  (reproduced in Mandeville, <span class="italic">Fable</span>, 1, after p. xx), left 20 shillings to his daughter for a ring, &pound;100 out of &pound;500 of South Sea annuities to his wife, and the remainder of the annuities and the rest of his estate to his son. An annotation on the will indicated that he had been living in the parish of St Stephen's, Coleman Street. He requested that he be buried &#145;as near by and in as private a manner as shall be consistent with the cheapest Decency&#146;.<br>
<br>There are no known portraits of Mandeville and the only authentic contemporary personal report about him we have is by Benjamin Franklin: Dr Lyons (a surgeon and author of <span class="italic">The Infallibility of Human Judgment</span>) &#145;carried me to The Horns pale ale house in &#151; Lane, Cheapside, and introduc'd me to Dr Mandeville, Author of the <span class="roman">Fable of the Bees</span>, who had a Club there, of which he was the Soul, being a most facetious entertaining Companion&#146; (<span class="italic">Franklin's Memoirs</span>, 110; Mandeville, <span class="italic">Fable</span>, 1.xxix).<h2>
<a name="ResponsestotheFable"></a>Responses to the Fable</h2>Mandeville's <span class="italic">Fable</span> evoked a number of responses (see references to Mandeville's works up to 1923 in <span class="italic">Fable</span>, 2.418&#150;53). Robert Burrow seems to have been the earliest of Mandeville's contemporary critics to publish, preaching against the <span class="italic">Fable</span> in a sermon before the lord mayor in September 1723, <span class="italic">Civil Society and Government Vindicated</span> (1723), alluded to in Mandeville's preface. Sermons and essays by William Barnes (preached March 1724, published 1727), William Hendley (1725), Samuel Chandler (1728), and Isaac Watts (1728), specifically defended charity schools, claiming that they promoted loyalty and religion or that they did not educate children beyond their stations. But many replies to the <span class="italic">Fable</span> also objected more generally to its denigration of rational morality, irreligious tone, or apparent justification of vice. William Law, in <span class="italic">Remarks on a Late Book</span> (1724), Richard Fiddes, in the preface to his <span class="italic">General Treatise of Morality</span> (1724), and John Thorold, in <span class="italic">A Short Examination of the Notions Advanc'd in a Late Book</span> (1726), all attacked the <span class="italic">Fable</span> in defence of religion and morality. John Dennis, in <span class="italic">Vice and Luxury Publick Mischiefs</span> (1724), saw the <span class="italic">Fable</span> as attack on virtue, liberty, and religion. George Bluet's extensive <span class="italic">Enquiry whether a general practice of virtue tends to the wealth or poverty, benefit or disadvantage of a people?</span> (1725) disputed many of Mandeville's contentions. <span class="italic">The True Meaning of the &#145;Fable of the Bees&#146;</span> (1726) did not defend the book but claimed that Bluet had missed the point: the <span class="italic">Fable</span> really favoured domination by a select few who reaped the benefit of others' vices.<br>
<br>There were other substantial replies in addition to Berkeley's caricature of Mandevilleans in <span class="italic">Alciphron</span>. Alexander Innes's <span class="italic">Arete-Logia</span> (1728), a plagiarized version of Archibald Campbell's <span class="italic">Enquiry into the Original of Moral Virtue</span> (1733) with his own preface challenging Mandeville to burn his book, as he had promised, should it be shown to be immoral. Innes's advertisements falsely reported that Mandeville had actually done so.<br>
<br>Francis Hutcheson's title-page to his <span class="italic">Inquiry into the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue</span> (1725) purported to defend Shaftesbury and oppose the <span class="italic">Fable</span>, but only a few passages were explicitly concerned with Mandeville. Hutcheson, a Presbyterian and a member of the &#145;old whig&#146; Molesworth circle, extended his attack on the <span class="italic">Fable</span> in the following year in the <span class="italic">Dublin Journal</span>. He identified five distinct meanings of Mandeville's paradox and contended that the social affections and virtues were natural, conducive to happiness, and consistent with prosperity. The criticism was republished in James Arbuckle's edition of <span class="italic">A collection of letters and essays on several subjects, lately publish'd in the &#145;Dublin Journal&#146;</span> (1729) and again in <span class="italic">Reflections on Laughter and Remarks on the &#145;Fable of the Bees&#146;</span> (1750); the basic view is repeated in Hutcheson's posthumous <span class="italic">A System of Moral Philosophy</span> (1755).<br>
<br>Mandeville's views were so widely known in the eighteenth century that there is scarcely any intellectual at the time who did not at least mention them. His conjectural history of society and language, emphasis on the role of the passions rather than reason, and claims that progress and commercial civilization were founded on necessary and beneficial vices set the terms for further moral, historical, and economic discussion in the Enlightenment. At the beginning of his <span class="italic">Treatise of Human Nature</span> David Hume named Mandeville among significant moral philosophers, while denying in the <span class="italic">Enquiry into the Principles of Morals</span> as well as in the <span class="italic">Treatise</span> that moral distinctions were entirely the artifice of politicians. His essays &#145;On refinement in the arts&#146; (originally &#145;Of luxury&#146;) and &#145;Of the dignity or meanness of human nature&#146; explore Mandevillean themes. Adam Smith devoted a chapter of <span class="italic">The Theory of Moral Sentiments</span> to rebutting Mandeville's moral theory but adopted some of his descriptions of commercial society in the <span class="italic">Wealth of Nations</span>. The defence of luxury by Voltaire in <span class="italic">Le mondain</span> and by Jean Fran&ccedil;ois Melon in his <span class="italic">D&eacute;fense de &#145;Le mondain&#146;</span> relied on Mandeville. In the <span class="italic">Discours sur les sciences et les arts</span> and the <span class="italic">Discours sur l'origine et les fondements de l'in&eacute;galit&eacute; parmi les hommes</span>, Jean-Jacques Rousseau accepted that material progress coincided with a shift in morality away from primitive simplicity, treating the change as moral decline. Later in the century Mandeville's accounts of human nature and historical development were also used in the work of Immanuel Kant.<br>
