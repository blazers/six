<span class="headword">Morland,  Egbert Coleby</span>  (1874&#150;1955), <span class="occ">physician and writer on medicine</span>, was born in Croydon on 3 September 1874, the seventh of the fourteen children of Charles Coleby Morland JP (1839&#150;1908), an umbrella maker, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fryer (1843&#150;1923). Of a Quaker family Morland was sent in 1889 to Bootham School, the Friends' institution at York, where he distinguished himself in science, languages, and mathematics. He enrolled at Owens College, Manchester, and gained a London BSc degree in zoology (first-class honours); he was then old enough to study medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, whence he graduated in 1898 with the gold medal in physiology.<br>
<br>In his working life Morland suffered two serious reverses. At first he seemed destined for a career in London medicine, but the usual succession of junior hospital appointments was interrupted after three years when he developed tuberculosis. Recovering after lengthy treatment in Switzerland under the devoted eye of his fianc&eacute;e, Mary Windsor Latchmore (1873&#150;1948), he decided to remain in that country and become a specialist in tuberculosis. He married Mary in 1903 and returned to student life, and received an MD degree (Bern) in 1907. The Morlands then moved to the isolated mountain resort of Arosa, Switzerland, where he built up a sizeable practice, mainly of British patients. They adopted the first of their three children in 1912. Then, two years later, came the second blow: the beginning of the First World War caused Morland's British clientele to melt away, and in 1915 he returned to England, pausing for a few months to assist the Friends' war victims' relief committee on the Marne. While in Arosa he had made several contributions to <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>; so, once in London, he called on the editorial office. The editor, Squire Sprigge, was short-handed and invited him to stay and help.<br>
<br>The editor of a general medical journal, it might be thought, should be a good communicator with a broad vision of medicine and a strong commitment to scientific truth. Whatever his character in 1915, Morland diverged increasingly from this model as his <span class="italic">Lancet</span> years went by. Though skilful in stripping the work of others to its essentials, his own conversation and writing displayed an enigmatic quality that continually perplexed his acquaintances. His reasoning was characterized by alarming leaps&#151;the knight's move in thought. His most lucid pronouncements were to be found on postcards and on the edge of office documents. Colleagues were sometimes dismayed by his habit of adding creative touches to the work of others&#151;especially when coupled with the dictum, &#145;Better be wrong than dull&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, 1955, 974&#150;6). Morland always needed someone on hand to say, &#145;think again&#146;. Abjuring anything in the nature of an editorial mission or policy, he was himself a mass of contradictions&#151;a pacifist who favoured conscription; an idealist deeply tinged with cynicism; and a man of high intelligence who was often content to indulge in wishful thinking. These characteristics were apt to frighten and exasperate people who did not know him well, and some who did. A fellow Quaker confessed that he seldom knew whether Morland's words were intended in jest or in earnest  (Braithwaite, 475&#150;6).<br>
<br>Before and after taking the chair as editor Morland's work depended inseparably on the efforts of others. Under Sprigge his oblique way of thinking was catalytic:<blockquote>At the central table sat Sir Squire, small, urbane, aquiline, in black coat and striped trousers; a cultivated man of his world; beloved but irascible. Behind a vast mahogany desk was Morland, tall, solemn, gaunt, with noble brow, in a grey tweed morning coat like a coachman's; surer of his worth than his welcome; overworked and often maddening. (<span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, 1955, 974&#150;6)</blockquote>For all the friction between them, Morland and Sprigge made a good partnership, the latter preserving continuity and good sense while Morland gave the journal life. But by the time Morland took the chair his eccentricities, coupled with a sharpening tongue, were less of an asset. Closer to <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> prophet than to commander, he inspired fear as well as affection, and loyal assistants were needed to preserve continuity and balance. They were hard-pressed. Morland's editorship, if ever there had been a right time for it, had come too late.<br>
<br>The Morlands spent much of their later years in Wooldale, Yorkshire, where they lived at Pellcroft, beside the ancient Friends' meeting-house. Mary died in 1948, and Egbert Morland died at Nunthorpe Nursing Home, York, on 26 April 1955. In the annals of medical editing, what was his special contribution? In the years of his editorship his personal enthusiasms are reflected in a notable emphasis on maternal and child health and the new subject of social medicine. But his best work was done earlier. For the editors who followed, his most lasting bequest was a tradition of good writing and gentle wit. The editor of <span class="italic">Nature</span> remarked, &#145;Having found <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> humane, he left it human&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, 1944, 633&#150;4).<br>
