<span class="headword">Strutt <span class="st"> [<em>other married name </em>Byron]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1783, in or after 1863), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born at Hull, Yorkshire, where she was baptized on 20 February 1783, the daughter of Thomas Frost, a solicitor in the town, and his wife, Elizabeth. The antiquary <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10193/', "Charles Frost")</script> was her brother. She was first married to John Byron (1780&#150;1805), a Hull physician, who died aged twenty-five. Her early works as Mrs Byron include <span class="italic">Drelincourt and Rodalvi, or, Memoirs of Two Noble Families: a Novel</span> (1807), a three-volume tale of tragic love set in England and Florence. In the preface Byron states:<blockquote>To amuse without injuring, and to instruct without offending, is the highest aim of the following pages &hellip; The approbation of the wise and good is &hellip; always valuable, and they must be undeserving of it, who are insensible of its worth.</blockquote>The style is reminiscent of Ann Radcliffe's late eighteenth-century romances, and her protagonists demonstrate sensibility worthy of Radcliffe's heroines. Byron was anxious to instruct as well as delight her readers, and her texts are all concerned with morality and virtue. Her epistolary novel <span class="italic">Anti-Delphine</span> (1806), for example, is a response to Germaine de Sta&euml;l's tragic tale of adulterous love. Predictably, in Byron's version the suffering wife uses patience and virtue to reclaim her husband, who has been seduced. <span class="italic">The Borderers</span> (1812), another historical romance in an international setting, takes place in the fourteenth century and includes various transformations: a knight who becomes a hermit, Moorish women who convert to Christianity, and a girl who dresses as a page. She married in London, on 8 November 1813, the artist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26682/', "Jacob George Strutt")</script>, with whom she had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>As Mrs Strutt she wrote further novels, such as <span class="italic">Genevieve, or, The Orphan's Visit</span> (1818) and the later <span class="italic">Chances and Changes: a Domestic Story</span> (1835), which combine the romance plot with overtly moral themes, and conclude with the marriages of the scrupulously virtuous heroines to their worthy suitors. Travels through France, Italy, and Switzerland led to European travel guides: <span class="italic">A Spinster's Tour in France, the States of Genoa etc. During the Year 1827</span> (1828), <span class="italic">Six Weeks on the Loire with a Peep into La Vendee</span> (1833), and <span class="italic">Domestic Residence in Switzerland</span> (1842). Aimed primarily at the unaccompanied female traveller, these include practical advice on choosing hotels. Her travel books are straightforward accounts, providing insight into the character of Strutt herself, who comes across as refined and possessed of a keen eye for the beauties of the landscape.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Strutt also wrote devotional works. Like some of her moral novels, her religious texts testify to her orthodox Christianity and keen sense of morality. For a period up to 1832 she and her husband lived at Butterwick House, Hammersmith, where she ran a boarding school for girls. The preface of her <span class="italic">The young Christian's companion, or, Manual of devotion for the use of schools and young persons</span> (1830) makes clear her pedagogical aims:<blockquote>The object in the following selection has been to produce a form of prayer, and of devotional exercises, concise enough to insure the attention of the young, and sufficiently impressive to excite the reverence of their hearts, toward the Divine being, whom they are too commonly accustomed to approach with the mere worship of their lips.</blockquote>Her <span class="italic">Book of the Fathers</span> (1837), which drew on materials which she had consulted in libraries in Geneva and Lausanne, was a collection of exemplary lives from the period of the early church. <span class="italic">The Hermit of Dumpton Cave</span> (1823) is a biography of a modern hermit, Joseph Croome Petit, and is subtitled &#145;<i>devotedness to God, and usefulness to man</i>&#146;, while <span class="italic">The Feminine Soul</span> (1857), written when she and her husband were living in Great Ormond Street, London, presents a heartfelt argument for spiritual equality between the sexes. <span class="italic">The Curate and the Rector</span> (1859) satirizes the Reverend Mr Plufty.<br>
<br>In June 1863 Strutt was awarded a civil list pension of &pound;70 &#145;in consideration of her straitened circumstances at a great age, and after 58 years of contributions to literature&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 June 1863). She was one of the nineteenth century's most prolific women of letters, but it is not known when she died.<br>
