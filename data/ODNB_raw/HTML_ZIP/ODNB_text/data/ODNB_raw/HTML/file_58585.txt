<span class="headword">Ganzoni,  (Francis) John Childs</span>, first Baron Belstead  (1882&#150;1958), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at The Cottage, Clapham Common, on 19 January 1882, the only son of Julius Charles Ganzoni (<i>d</i>. 1949), a colonial broker and later chairman of C. Czarnikow Ltd, and his wife, Mary Frances Childs, daughter of Major James Childs of the 3rd Royal Fusiliers. John Ganzoni, as he was known, had the opportunity to see the world in his youth as his grandfather, who was Swiss but became a naturalized British subject, was in the sugar trade. His travels instilled in him the ambition to bond the dominions and the United Kingdom, and in later life he travelled widely to this end, becoming a fellow of the Royal Geographic Society. These overseas trips interrupted his formal education; he never attended in the spring term when at Tonbridge School, and did so only from his second year at Christ Church, Oxford, where, as an undergraduate from 1900 to 1904, he was more interested in sport than in public speaking. After graduating with a third in modern history in 1904, he was called to the bar (Inner Temple) in 1906, and joined the south-eastern circuit, but came to dislike legal practice.<br>
<br>In 1911 Ganzoni was adopted as the Unionist parliamentary candidate for Ipswich, which traditionally had been a Liberal seat and with which he had no connection. In May 1914 a by-election was called, following the death of Charles Silvester Horne, one of the sitting Liberal members; C. F. G. Masterman was &#145;carpet-bagged&#146; into Ipswich by the Liberals, but Ganzoni won, to his own surprise. It was during this campaign that he earned the name Union Jack Ganzoni. He had been in the Commons for only three months when the First World War began, and he was commissioned in the 4th battalion of the Suffolk regiment, serving in France from 1914 to 1916 with the rank of captain, then at the quartermaster-general's services in York in 1917, returning to the British expeditionary force in 1918 as a staff officer. He was gassed twice, but was at home on account of frostbite when many of his relatives died at the Somme. He claimed that the tin helmet that he wore was responsible for his early baldness; a more significant result of his experiences in the trenches was to generate a genuine interest in people, which assisted him in his political career.<br>
<br>In the general election of 1918 Ganzoni won with almost twice the number of votes as his long-standing opponent from the Labour Party, Robert Frederick Jackson. For the next three contests Ipswich followed the &#145;Right, left, right&#146; swings of government that knocked out the Liberal Party. He retained the seat in 1922, lost it in the unexpected election of 1923, when protection was rejected in both country districts and the cities, but recovered it in 1924 as a result of one of several Unionist&#150;Liberal pacts in East Anglia. Ganzoni himself spoke out for co-operation between opponents of socialism. From 1924 until 1929 he was unpaid parliamentary private secretary to the postmaster-general. Knighted in 1921, he was created a baronet in March 1929.<br>
<br>Ganzoni married, on 31 May 1930, Gwendoline (Gwen) Gertrude (1893/4&#150;1962), the elder daughter of Arthur Turner, a partner in an Ipswich leather manufacturing firm. She became president of the Royal Midwives' Society. After their late marriage both devoted much time to their son, John, and daughter, Jill.<br>
<br>Ganzoni's majority of 12,292 in 1931 was the biggest in Ipswich during the twentieth century. His final victory, with Jackson still the opponent, was in 1935, and he remained an MP until December 1937. He encapsulated the successful Conservative adaptation to a democratic electorate: like Baldwin, he was moderate, charming, and an unpolitical animal, and at ease with MPs of all parties.<br>
<br>In his late fifties Ganzoni said that he would not fight another election, and accepted a peerage as Baron Belstead of Ipswich in January 1938, forcing MPs to find a new chairman for the kitchen committee of the Commons, a post that he had enjoyed for six years, and for which MPs would remember him. A gourmet who later possessed a large figure, he introduced MPs to exotic dishes, and was proud that they began to drink more empire wine; in 1932, when asked if the Tabasco pepper sauce might be obtained from Yorkshire rather than the United States, Ganzoni replied, amid much laughter, that no more would be purchased after the present supply was exhausted. The dining rooms were often called Chez Ganzoni.<br>
<br>From 1939 to 1942 Belstead was a local army welfare officer (AWO) in Ipswich, and his organization of activities for army camps meant that his house was full of dartboards; he continued as the county AWO until 1949, with rank of lieutenant-colonel. From 1940 he served as the chairman of the private bills committee in the Lords, having carried out the same duties in the Commons from 1923 until 1937. He also became a magistrate and deputy lieutenant for Suffolk.<br>
<br>Ultimately Ganzoni's interests were local, and he was active in every branch of Ipswich life. He indulged his main sporting interests as the president of Suffolk County Cricket Club and a founder director of Ipswich Town Football Club. But the sport at which he excelled was tennis, and he was president of the Suffolk Lawn Tennis Association from 1929; he had been a member of the Lawn Tennis Association Council from 1910 until 1923, and a member of the House of Commons team. In his later days, he was frequently an umpire at local tournaments, and his enthusiasm lives on in the many trophies that were donated to clubs and schools in his name.<br>
<br>Ganzoni was not disappointed that he never held higher office: he lived according to his motto, <i>Fidelitas vincit</i> (&#145;faithfulness conquers&#146;) by loyally serving the constituents of Ipswich, where he died at Ipswich Nursing Home, 57 Fonnereau Road, on 15 August 1958. He was succeeded as second Baron Belstead by his son, John Julian Ganzoni (<i>b</i>. 1932), who held office in Conservative governments between 1970 and 1992.<br>
