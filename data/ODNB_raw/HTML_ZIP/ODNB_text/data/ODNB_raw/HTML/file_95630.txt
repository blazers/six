<span class="headword">Stanford,  John Montague  Benett-</span>  (1870&#150;1947), <span class="occ">cinematographer and landowner</span>, was born at the family estate of Pythouse, West Tisbury, Wiltshire, on 5 February 1870, the only legitimate son of Vere Fane Benett-Stanford (1839&#150;1894), landowner and Conservative MP for Shaftesbury (1873&#150;80), and his wife, Ellen (<i>d</i>. 1932), daughter and heir of William Stanford of Preston Manor, Brighton. He attended Eton College until the age of sixteen and, although he had passed his army examinations, was apprenticed to the London, Brighton, and South Coast railway because his father thought him too young for a military career. In his youth he lived the life of the archetypal late Victorian gentleman&#150;adventurer, exploring and mapping parts of Kenya and central Africa at the age of twenty-three, and shooting in South Africa and India. He served as a young officer in the Royal Dragoons until 1892, when he resigned his commission. From 1892 to 1900 he held the rank of lieutenant in the Royal Wiltshire yeomanry. On 4 July 1893 he married Evelyn (1868&#150;1957), daughter of Captain Burchall Helme of Broadfield Court, Leominster, and had two children: a son, Vere (1894&#150;1922), and a daughter, Patience (1899&#150;1904).<br>
<br>Benett-Stanford worked as a war correspondent and cinematographer in the Sudan campaign and the South African War. How he first acquired a movie camera and practised &#145;living picture&#146; production is unclear. However, in 1898 he embarked for the Sudan with a Prestwich camera to report General Kitchener's final battle with the Mahdists at Omdurman, and took the first ever combat footage, a 75 foot film entitled <span class="italic">Alarming the Queen's Company of Grenadier Guards at Omdurman</span>. That film, his later <span class="italic">The Seaforth Highlanders' Return to Cairo after the Fall of Omdurman and Khartoum</span>, and <span class="italic">The Sirdar's Reception at Guildhall</span>, were all widely shown throughout England during the Sudan sensation of 1898&#150;9. All three films were printed by George Albert Smith of Brighton; <span class="italic">Alarming</span> was distributed by Phillip Wolff, and <span class="italic">The Seaforth Highlanders</span> and <span class="italic">Sirdar</span> (produced by Robert Paul's Animatograph works) were distributed by the Warwick Trading Co. Early in 1899 Benett-Stanford made at least two films near Quinta Vigia, his family's home in Madeira: <span class="italic">Panorama of Madeira</span> and <span class="italic">Oxen Hauling up Surf Boats at Madeira</span>. In England that same year he filmed <span class="italic">The Shamrock: after the Launch</span>, <span class="italic">Feeding the Pigs</span>, <span class="italic">Horses</span>, <span class="italic">Express</span>, and <span class="italic">Coaches</span>; all seven films were printed by Smith and distributed by Warwick.<br>
<br>In October of 1899, armed with a Bioscope camera and an agreement with the Warwick Trading Co., Benett-Stanford set out to film the South African War. In the short period that he worked in South Africa (he left in early 1900 because, according to a contemporary account by Victor Cook, he had been injured during an engagement), he sent back at least five films, each running for about one minute: <span class="italic">The Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers Digging Entrenchments: the Passing of the Armoured Train</span>; <span class="italic">Lancers Crossing the Modder River</span>; <span class="italic">Troops Passing over Modder River by Train</span>; <span class="italic">The Ambulance Corps at Work</span>; and <span class="italic">4.7 Gun</span>. Like his Sudan films, the South African films earned a considerable following and were shown in town halls, music halls, and other venues throughout England. After the South African War, however, he apparently gave up cinematography and rarely spoke of it again. It has been suggested that he may have felt that it was not the activity of an officer and gentleman; the fact that Philipp Wolff used his name in his advertising in 1898 (certainly a showman's advertisement in the <span class="italic">Era</span> was not a place for an officer and gentleman's name to appear) supports this speculation. An interest in motor cars seems also to have absorbed his energies.<br>
<br>Because he so thoroughly embellished accounts of his early life, Benett-Stanford's real accomplishments outside his films remain obscure. Beneath his portrait at Pythouse was a case of medals, many of which he apparently awarded to himself. He always claimed that he had participated in the 1897 Tirah campaign in India, but since he was no longer in the regular army at that time (having retired from the dragoons), his claims must be received with some scepticism. He also claimed to have been made a fellow of the Royal Geographical and the Royal Zoological societies as a result of his African treks in the early 1890s, but these claims cannot be verified either. He was an officer in the Territorial Army and served with the motor volunteer corps in First World War; he retired with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, but his major contribution to the war effort seems to have been lobbing rocks at conscientious objectors from the back seat of his Rolls-Royce.<br>
<br>After the First World War Benett-Stanford pursued the activities of a country squire: as well as serving as a justice of the peace and a county councillor he rode to hounds, shot, entertained, feuded, and wrote occasional pieces for <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>. Perhaps in part because he was crushed by his son's untimely death from tuberculosis (probably a result of his being gassed on the western front), he did not age gracefully; he battled with neighbours, his mother, and stepfather (his father died in 1894, and his mother remarried in 1897), the trustees of his estate, and various acquaintances, and was referred to variously as Mad Jack and Roaring Jack. In 1904 he had been fined for assaulting a carter who had blocked the path of his motor car; and in 1910, while on Territorial Army manoeuvres, he was involved in an altercation with a publican, which also resulted in court action. His business interests in the motor industry involved him in litigation in 1905 and 1911. There were sales of the contents of his Wiltshire home in 1919 and 1935. Although he was the last lord of the manor of Preston, his mother's estate in Brighton, a long-running feud with his mother (which included his threat to turn Preston Manor into a girls' school) finally persuaded her to leave it to the municipality of Brighton. He regularly claimed to have exercised the right of <i>droit de seigneur</i> on the girls in the neighbourhood, undoubtedly another of his embellishments.<br>
<br>Benett-Stanford's retreat into Blimpishness as he grew older may be marked by the accounts of two contemporaries. In 1906 it was said of him: &#145;While the country gentry of England can show us such sterling representatives of their class as Major Benett-Stanford they will still form the backbone of social order, and may safely disregard those who prate so dolefully of the decadence of our land&#146;  (Gaskill, 70). An obituarist concluded: &#145;He was out of tune with present times and tendencies &hellip; John Benett-Stanford was born 300 years too late&#146;  (Beevers 35). Benett-Stanford died from heart failure at his home, Pythouse, Tisbury, Wiltshire, on 18 November 1947, and was buried at Norton Bavant.<br>
