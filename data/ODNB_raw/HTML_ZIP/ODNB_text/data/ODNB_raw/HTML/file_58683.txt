<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bennett, Sir  Ernest Nathaniel</span>  (1865&#150;1947), <span class="occ">politician and journalist</span>, was born on 12 December 1865 (though in later life he gave his birth year as 1868) in Colombo, Ceylon, the only son of the Revd George Bennett (1830&#150;1897), a Church of England clergyman and schoolmaster, and his wife, Eliza (<i>bap</i>. 1830, <i>d</i>. 1911), daughter of Captain Thomas Fewson of the East India Company and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mapleton. George Bennett was the second son of Thomas Bennett, a cobbler or shoemaker of Roseacre, near Kirkham, Lancashire, graduated from Trinity College, Dublin (BA, 1849), and was rector of Rede, near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk (1885&#150;96). He was described as being &#145;strongly Tory&#146;.<br>
<br>Ernest Bennett was educated at Durham School (1881&#150;5), becoming a king's scholar, a school monitor, and captain of the rugby fifteen. Briefly at Wadham College, Oxford, in 1885, then scholar (1885) of Hertford College, Oxford, he gained firsts in classical moderations, <i>literae humaniores</i> (BA, 1889), and theology (1890), and won the senior Hall-Houghton Greek testament prize. He became a fellow of Hertford (1891&#150;1915), and was a lecturer of Wadham, Pembroke, Lincoln, and Hertford colleges. In 1900 he published <span class="italic">Christianity and Paganism in the Fourth and Fifth Centuries</span>, a short book based on his lectures to honours theology men.<br>
<br>Bennett travelled in Palestine and elsewhere, and in 1896 he explored the island of Socotra with James Theodore Bent (1852&#150;1897). An ambitious man, Bennett wanted to make his name as a journalist before entering politics. In 1897, as a <span class="italic">Times</span> assistant correspondent, he reported the insurrection in Crete. In his February 1898 <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span> article &#145;Amongst the Cretan insurgents&#146;, Bennett, in the tradition of Victorian war correspondents, described his adventures and narrow escapes from death under fire. He praised the Turks, and condemned the Cretan insurgents as barbaric &#145;ruffians&#146; who massacred their prisoners of war. He also, in what was to be a recurring theme of his writings, denounced wartime &#145;alleged atrocities&#146;.<br>
<br>In the 1898 long vacation Bennett went as correspondent of the Liberal <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span> to report the Sudan reconquest. He described himself as a &#145;non-journalistic amateur, who, in order to go through the campaign, has secured a permit to act as a correspondent&#146;  (Bennett, <span class="italic">The Downfall of the Dervishes</span>, 77). He reported the battle of Omdurman (2 September 1898) and its immediate aftermath. Like other correspondents, he rushed out a book on the campaign, <span class="italic">The Downfall of the Dervishes</span> (1898). As an imperialist, he condemned the Mahdist regime and praised the reconquest. However, he criticized the killing of wounded Mahdists. He also criticized, unnamed but identifiable, Bennet Burleigh, the veteran <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> war correspondent. Bennett in his January 1899 <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> article &#145;After Omdurman&#146; condemned the killing of Mahdist wounded, looting, and the treatment of the Mahdi's corpse and tomb as &#145;a return to the barbarism of the Middle Ages&#146;. His allegations &#145;created such a stir&#146;  (Churchill, 1004), made him &#145;one of the most talked of men in England&#146;  (Gaskell, 85), and provoked rebuttals from (among others) Burleigh in the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> and <span class="italic">Khartoum Campaign, 1898</span> (1899). Burleigh denounced Bennett's allegations as &#145;unwarranted and untruthful libels &hellip; inaccuracy and sensationalism&#146;  (Burleigh, 337, 339). The hostile response apparently surprised Bennett. He hoped to stand as a Liberal parliamentary candidate at the next election, and he wrote to C. P. Scott that he feared no constituency would listen to someone who by Burleigh's and others' &#145;disgraceful&#146; attacks had been misrepresented as a &#145;traducer&#146; of British imperial forces  (Spiers, 122). When, in 1899, the government proposed a money grant to Kitchener, Scott opposed it on the issue of the Mahdi's remains and the treatment of the wounded. Bennett gave Scott information, but asked him not to quote him in the house.<br>
<br>In 1899 Bennett went to the South African War and joined, as an orderly, a Royal Army Medical Corps volunteer ambulance train attached to Lord Methuen's command. Like some other volunteers he donated his pay to the Widows' and Orphans' Fund. He witnessed the aftermath of the battles of Belmont, Graspan, and Magersfontein. He left in 1900 and later that year published <span class="italic">With Methuen's Column in an Ambulance Train</span>, a short, impressionistic, and opinionated work, bound in the fashionable khaki, in which he criticized Uitlanders, especially &#145;German Jews&#146;, Kipling, and &#145;amateur critics at home&#146;, and praised the British soldiers. In May 1900 he was commissioned second lieutenant in the 1st (Oxford University) volunteer battalion, Oxfordshire light infantry, and in 1902, as temporary lieutenant, he commanded the Oxfordshire Volunteers in the Orange River Colony. By 1912 he shared the view that the war had been engineered by &#145;cosmopolitan financiers&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1906, asserting his belief in &#145;the creed of Radicalism&#146; and campaigning largely on the free trade issue, Bennett was elected Liberal MP for the Mid or Woodstock division of Oxfordshire. He was especially committed to the cause of Congo reform, though he also spoke on the auxiliary forces and other issues. In 1909 he was appointed parliamentary private secretary to Sir Edward Strachey, bt, of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. Bennett was defeated in both 1910 elections. Relatively radical, he favoured land reform and criticized Grey's conduct of foreign policy. In <span class="italic">Problems of Village Life</span> (1914) he attacked the &#145;chains of Feudalism&#146; and the drink trade, and demanded land nationalization. He was honorary treasurer of the Land Nationalization Federation. Meanwhile he continued part-time soldiering with the volunteers of the Oxfordshire light infantry, as a lieutenant from March 1903 and a captain from August 1904. He was an Oxfordshire JP from 1909 to 1936.<br>
<br>In 1911, with authorization as a <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> reporter, Bennett visited the Turkish army during the Turco-Italian war in Libya, leaving in 1912. His reports and his <span class="italic">With the Turks in Tripoli</span> (1912) were pro-Turkish and anti-Italian. In the First Balkan War of 1912 he accompanied the Turkish army, and acted as press censor in Thrace. In the first year of the First World War he was a British Red Cross commissioner in Belgium, France, and Serbia. Later he was attached to the staff of 11th (reserve) infantry brigade, admiralty intelligence division, headquarters of 9th army corps (1917) and headquarters of the army of the Rhine (1919). On 4 October 1915 he married Marguerite Wilhelmina, eldest daughter of H. G. Kleinwort, of Wierton Place, near Maidstone, Kent. They had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Bennett was one of the first former Liberal MPs to defect to Labour, joining the Independent Labour Party in 1916. He unsuccessfully contested West Wiltshire (1918), Banbury (1922 and 1923), and South-West St Pancras (1924). Apparently sharing the leftist reaction against Versailles and the war, in 1921 he translated <span class="italic">The German Army in Belgium: the White Book of May 1915</span>, German propaganda attempting to justify their killing of Belgian civilians. In May 1929 he was elected for Central Cardiff, and in 1930 he was knighted. Opinions of Bennett differed. Hugh Dalton wrote in 1930 that Bennett was &#145;a talkative and unatmospheric fool&#151;audibly and visibly half a Liberal who, by his continual intervention, creates suspicions against himself&#146;  (Pimlott, 109&#150;10). In 1931 he supported Ramsay MacDonald's National Government and became one of thirteen <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95547', "National Labour")</script> MPs. In 1932 he went to India as a member of the (Lothian) Indian franchise committee, and in 1933 he was a British delegate to the League of Nations assembly. From October 1932 to December 1935 he was assistant postmaster-general. He was on various committees, including (from 1939) the select committee on national expenditure, and was chairman of the Near and Middle East Association. He was a member of the archbishops' committee on church and state, and of the governing body of the Church in Wales. By 1937 he had acquired his home called Cwmllecoediog, Aberangell, Montgomeryshire, and had an entry in Burke's <span class="italic">Landed Gentry</span>.<br>
<br>Bennett had three predominant political concerns: anti-communism, improving relations with Germany, and a pro-Arab, anti-Zionist policy for Palestine. A member of the Anglo-German Fellowship, in letters to the press and elsewhere he condemned the Versailles treaty as &#145;harsh, vindictive, indefensible&#146;  (Griffiths, <span class="italic">Fellow Travellers of the Right</span>, 256), advocated appeasement of Nazi Germany, and condemned the Franco-Soviet pact (1935), and he voted in support of the Munich agreement in October 1938. In 1937 he condemned Italian reprisals in Abyssinia. His predominant political concerns led him in 1939 to associate with extreme right-wing and antisemitic groups, and to join Captain Archibald Maule Ramsay's clandestine Right Club. He deplored the British declaration of war in 1939, and voted for Chamberlain at the Norway debate (May 1940). In late 1939 and early 1940 he was prominent among those MPs advocating a negotiated peace with Germany, and he worked with the parliamentary peace aims group. On 22 May 1940 he was one of a delegation of MPs who asked Lloyd George to appeal for a negotiated settlement: Lloyd George refused. Bennett retired from parliament in June 1945.<br>
<br>At Oxford Bennett was influenced by the psychical research of F. W. H. Myers, &#145;a veritable inspiration&#146;  (Bennett, <span class="italic">Apparitions</span>, xviii). In 1894 he joined the Society for Psychical Research and from 1901 he was on its council. He attended s&eacute;ances and investigated various alleged paranormal phenomena, sometimes exposing fraud. He believed that, despite fraud and trickery, there were genuine paranormal phenomena, including &#145;telepathy from the dead&#146;  (ibid., 376), and called for further research. He claimed that he once witnessed at a s&eacute;ance &#145;the production of a complete, visible and tangible figure&#146;  (Bennett, <span class="italic">Apollonius</span>, 79). He published <span class="italic">Apollonius, or, The Present and Future of Psychical Research</span> (1927) and <span class="italic">Apparitions and Haunted Houses: a Survey of Evidence</span> (1939). His interest in the field continued: early in 1942, for example, he investigated for the society an alleged poltergeist case at the Clarence Nursing Home, Malvern, in which, reportedly, a kitchen poker detached itself from its hook, rose in the air, and flew some 10 or 12 feet. Bennett died at Amberfield, Chart Sutton, near Maidstone, Kent, on 2 February 1947, and was buried in Oxford. He was survived by his wife.<br>
