<span class="headword">Cornwall <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Cornewall]</span>,  Charles</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1669, <em>d.</em> 1718), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was baptized on 5 August 1669 at Eyre, Herefordshire, the son of Robert Cornewall (1646&#150;1701) of Berrington, and his wife, Edith Cornwallis (<i>d</i>. 1696). He entered the navy in 1683, commanded two prizes in 1691&#150;2, and on 19 September 1692 was made post captain of the sloop <i>Portsmouth</i>. In 1693 he commanded the <i>Adventure</i> (44 guns), and accompanied Admiral Edward Russell to the Mediterranean; he remained there until 1696, at about which time he married Dorothy Hanmer; they had eight sons and seven daughters. This was Cornewall's second marriage; details of his first wife are unknown. On 18 January 1695 he shared in the capture of the French ships <i>Trident</i> and <i>Content</i>. Captain James Killigrew of the <i>Plymouth</i>, the senior officer present, was killed in the action, and Cornewall was promoted to command the <i>Plymouth</i>.<br>
<br>Cornewall left the navy after the treaty of Ryswick (1697), having latterly commanded the <i>Kent</i>, and in 1701 he attempted unsuccessfully to enter parliament for Herefordshire, at which time it was said that he possessed an estate of &pound;10,000&#150;&pound;12,000 and an annual income of &pound;500&#150;&pound;600. He returned to naval service in command of the <i>Shrewsbury</i> in 1701, but resigned after a few months in order to settle the complicated family affairs caused by the sudden death of his father. Although appointed to the <i>Exeter</i> in 1702, he was unwilling to serve in her if he was to be effectively a &#145;second captain&#146; under John Leake, who was appointed to command the Newfoundland station; Cornewall protested that &#145;their sending a private captain to command &hellip; me in my own ship [was] a modest way of terming me a blockhead&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 8.102), and he rejected a proposed transfer to a smaller ship. Because of the chequered nature of his recent career, and his uneasy political relationship with Robert Harley, he was finding it difficult to obtain suitable employment, despite regular requests to leading ministers. However, in 1705 he was appointed to command the <i>Orford</i>.<br>
<br>In the <i>Orford</i> Cornewall again went out to the Mediterranean, where he remained for the next two years, under the command, first, of Sir Cloudesley Shovell, and afterwards of Sir Thomas Dilkes. In the autumn of 1707 he commanded a detached squadron on the coast of Naples. In March 1708 he returned to England, and in 1709 he changed his name to Cornwall in an attempt to distinguish between different branches of his family. He sat as a whig MP, first for Bewdley&#151;1709&#150;10&#151;and later for Weobley, from 1715 until his death. In December 1709 he was appointed to command in the Downs and off Dunkirk; and in October 1710 he left England in command of the <i>Dreadnought</i>, in charge of the trade for the Levant. This he escorted safely to Smyrna, and by December 1711 he was again in England where his strong political leanings excluded him from further employment under the tory administration.<br>
<br>At the accession of George I Cornwall was appointed comptroller of storekeeper's accounts at the Navy Board; he retained this post until promoted rear-admiral on 16 June 1716. In the following October he became commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, with instructions to take appropriate measures to prevent the depredations of the Sal&eacute; corsairs, and to enter into a treaty with the emperor of Morocco. In this work he was occupied for the next year, residing at Gibraltar, where a quarrel&#151;one which was to become increasingly bitter&#151;sprang up between Cornwall and the governor; it arose out of the soldiers' unwillingness to admit the admiral's authority even in matters relating to the ships in the port. The blame for this may have lain chiefly with the governor, who maintained that either he or Cornwall was &#145;the vilest fellow upon earth&#146;, and permitted, if he did not encourage, his officers to &#145;drink damnation to the admiral and the negotiation he was conducting&#146;. Cornwall too may have used strong language, for he seems to have been a man of hot temper; but the correspondence between the two ended in the admiral's expressing determination to refer the matter to the king or to the speaker of the Commons. He seems to have been prevented from doing so by his being called away from Gibraltar on active service. He had been promoted vice-admiral in March 1718, and in June he hoisted his flag in the <i>Shrewsbury</i>, as second in command of the fleet under Sir George Byng, before playing a prominent part in the victory off Cape Passaro on 31 July. Afterwards he shifted his flag to his former ship, the <i>Argyle</i>, convoyed the prizes to Port Mahon, and sailed for England. His health had been poor for some time, and after putting into Lisbon on the homeward passage he died there on 7 October 1718. He was buried in Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>Among Cornwall's sons, Jacobs was the father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6335/', "Charles Wolfran Cornwall")</script>, who was named after Charles's uncle, another naval captain, Wolfran Cornwall, who had been a prominent Williamite agent during the revolution of 1688. Cornwall's younger brother, Frederick (<i>d</i>. 1748), vicar of Bromfield for forty-six years, was the grandfather of Folliott H. W. Cornewall, bishop of Worcester.<br>
