<span class="headword">Hill,  Nicholas</span>  (1570&#150;<em>c.</em>1610), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was born in Fleet Street, London, and was educated first at Merchant Taylors' School, then as a scholar at St John's College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 21 July 1587 as <i>plebei filius</i>. His parents are unknown. On 30 June 1590 he was admitted as a fellow of the college, but within a year he had been deprived (<i>amotus</i>), probably on account of his conversion to Roman Catholicism. Thereafter college records state that he &#145;went away, applied himself to the Lullian doctrine, and published certain questions in philosophy&#146;, and that he was dead by 1621 at the latest. The philosophical questions here mentioned are set out in his only published work, <span class="italic">Philosophia epicurea democritiana theophrastica</span> (Paris, 1601).<br>
<br>So much may be stated confidently. For the rest of his personal life there is only hearsay evidence collected sixty years after his death. This consists of two independent and incompatible accounts uncritically combined by Anthony Wood in his <span class="italic">Athenae Oxonienses</span> (1691&#150;2). One of these, supplied to him mainly through John Aubrey, by Thomas Henshaw (who afterwards disclaimed it), rests ultimately on London gossip and statements ascribed to Edmund Sheffield, first earl of Mulgrave (1564&#150;1646), whose qualifications as a source are unclear. It contains some demonstrable absurdities. The other account came through intermediaries at Oxford&#151;Joseph Maynard and Obadiah Walker&#151;from the scientist Robert Hues. Since Hues moved in the same circles as Hill and had spent his last sixteen years at Oxford, his testimony has much greater weight and, though indirectly reported, deserves respect.<br>
<br>From this it appears that, after leaving Oxford, Hill was for some time associated with Henry Percy, ninth earl of Northumberland, the patron of Thomas Harriot and afterwards of Hues himself, and so was to some extent involved in the &#145;atheist&#146; or &#145;deist&#146; circle of Northumberland and Sir Walter Ralegh, with whom Aubrey independently describes him as &#145;intimate&#146;. Although a professed Catholic, Hill shared the unorthodox views of this circle. According to Hues &#145;he professed himself a disciple of Jordanus Brunus&#146;. This is clearly true: the &#145;Lullian doctrine&#146; to which he had applied himself was what Bruno had taught in Paris, and in his own writings Hill supports the main cosmological ideas of Bruno&#151;a heliocentric system, atomism, the eternity of matter, the infinity of the universe, and the plurality of worlds. Hill had probably discovered Bruno's ideas in Oxford where Bruno's visit to the university in June 1583 was well remembered, especially in St John's College. Such ideas were acceptable in the Northumberland&#150;Ralegh circle: Northumberland himself was interested in Bruno and acquired his works.<br>
<br>However, by the late 1590s Hill had apparently found a new patron. According to Hues, he then &#145;joined himself to Mr Basset, who, after Queen Elizabeth's death pretended some right for the crown; but King James being admitted, and possessed, he fled and lived in Rotterdam &hellip;&#146;. This statement has been dismissed by C. J. Robinson in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> as &#145;a gossiping story&#146;, but it is very specific and the episode itself is authentic. Sir Robert Basset, a restless Devon partisan of Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, was reported in 1598&#150;1600 to be turning to popery under the influence of &#145;one Hill&#146;, &#145;a lewd fellow Hill&#146;, and in 1600 he conceived a wild plan to seize Lundy island and declare himself heir to the throne. In 1603, on the queen's death, he actually attempted to carry out this plan, but the result was a fiasco and he fled abroad. It may be that Hill, on learning of this project in 1600, took fright and himself fled abroad&#151;perhaps to Paris, where he published his book in 1601. The book contains some curious passages compatible with such a scenario, and Hill's eccentric dedication of it to his own infant son Laurence provided him with a pretext to denounce previous patrons who, he implied, had betrayed him. This obscure episode, never publicized at the time but confirmed by the state papers, would have been known to Hues through his then patron Ralegh, a Devon man familiar with the Basset family.<br>
<br>Hill's <span class="italic">Philosophia epicurea</span>, a sequence of 509 propositions in natural philosophy, is topical in another respect too. In 1600 Giordano Bruno had been burnt at the stake in Rome, and it has been suggested, by Jean Jacquot, that Hill's book was a tribute to his memory. But if so, Hill was careful to cover himself: he cites Bruno (as &#145;Nolanus&#146;) explicitly in a marginal note only; he states, in the title and in the dedicatory epistle, that he is offering hypotheses only (&#145;proposita simpliciter, non edocta&#146;); and he declares that if any of them is contrary to the Catholic faith, &#145;igni illud et inferis mando&#146; (&#145;I commit it to the flames and hell&#146;). And if he published the book in Catholic Paris, the centre of Lullian studies, he sought safety for himself in protestant Rotterdam.<br>
<br>According to Hues, Hill died in Rotterdam, from taking poison because of distress at the death of his own son. Henshaw told Wood that Hill died &#145;in or about 1610&#146;, a detail which he may have derived, indirectly, from Hill's widow, who was living in London &#145;behind Bow church&#146; about 1637. Like her husband, she was a Roman Catholic, but her identity is unknown.<br>
<br>Hill's book made no impact in contemporary England except as a butt for the Jacobean wits. Ben Jonson tilted at his &#145;atomi ridiculous&#146;  (<span class="italic">Epigrams</span>, no. 133). Reprinted in Geneva in 1619, it was violently attacked by Mersenne in his general onslaught on Bruno and the deists in 1623&#150;5. But later, when heliocentric and atomist ideas had been made acceptable by Galileo and Gassendi, Hill was occasionally remembered as an erratic precursor, and in the 1660s he was described by Aubrey as &#145;one of the most learned men of his time, a great mathematician and philosopher and traveller and poet&#146;, whose unprinted works had by then unhappily been lost.<br>
<br>These unprinted works are said to have included a treatise&#151;clearly Brunian&#151;&#145;De infinitate et aeternitate mundi&#146; and another, &#145;mighty paradoxical&#146;, &#145;on the essence of God, etc., light, proving that there is a God, in 10 or 12 articles&#146;. In the Bodleian Library, MS Wood F 42 fol. 174 seems to be a translation of part of the former, and MS Tanner 306 fols. 110&#150;12&#151;a Latin poem of eighteen lines&#151;probably formed part of the latter. Another short Latin poem, inscribed and signed by Hill himself, is in the <i>album amicorum</i> of Sir Francis Segar in the Huntington Library  (MS HM 743, fol. 82). A manuscript commonplace book now in the Brotherton Library of Leeds University (MS Lt 52), which contains a note, &#145;written by my cosen Mr Nicolas Hill&#146;, may be by him. If so, it is presumably an early compilation: it shows an interest in a hermit life and Catholic mysticism but no Lullian or Brunian ideas.<br>
<br>From his writings Hill seems to have been a crotchety, difficult, and reclusive man, with few friends, his affections being concentrated on his little son, whose &#145;thousand pretty tricks&#146; enabled him to forget his personal resentments and whose death &#145;of a pestilential disease&#146; in Holland precipitated his own.<br>
