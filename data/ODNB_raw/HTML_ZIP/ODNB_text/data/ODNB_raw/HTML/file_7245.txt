<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Davies, Sir  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1569, <em>d.</em> 1626), <span class="occ">lawyer and poet</span>, third son of Edward Davies (<i>d</i>. 1580), a Welshman settled at Chisgrove in the parish of Tisbury, Wiltshire, and his wife, Mary, daughter of John Bennett of Pitt House, Wiltshire, was baptized at Tisbury on 16 April 1569. He is described by Anthony Wood as the son of a &#145;wealthy tanner&#146;. At his entry to Middle Temple it was recorded in the register that his father was a gentleman. Apparently first educated at Winchester College, Davies matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford, on 15 October 1585. It does not appear that he graduated. After a brief spell at New Inn, London, he was admitted to the Middle Temple on 3 February 1588, and was called to the bar in July 1595.<h2>
<a name="Poeticworks"></a>Poetic works</h2>In the previous year Davies had registered with the Stationers a poetic work entitled <span class="italic">Orchestra, or, A Poeme of Dancing</span>, the earliest extant edition of which is dated 1596. It was dedicated to Richard Martin, Davies's contemporary at the Middle Temple. At Bridgewater House 100 years ago was preserved a copy of the first edition, with a manuscript dedicatory sonnet to Sir Thomas Egerton, written by Davies in 1600 on the death of the lord chancellor's second wife. About the same time as he wrote and published <span class="italic">Orchestra</span>, Davies went into print with a number of epigrams, notorious for their &#145;roughness, even coarseness&#146; which their modern editor ascribed to &#145;the &#147;Wild Oats&#148; sowing, of the Poet's youthful period&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Poems</span>, 1.21). Manuscript transcripts of certain &#145;Gullinge Sonnets&#146;, addressed to Sir Anthony Cooke and kept in Chetham's Library, Manchester, were probably also written by Davies the lawyer. <span class="italic">Nosce teipsum</span>, a poem on the immortality of the soul and its relation to the body, much commended by contemporaries and modern critics alike, was written about 1594. A manuscript copy was preserved at Holkham Hall, Norfolk, as late as 1888, with dedicatory verses &#145;To my honorable patron and frend Ed. Cooke, Esq., her Maties Attorney-Generall&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Another manuscript copy has a dedication to the earl of Northumberland. In 1594 Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy, presented Davies at court, where the queen had him sworn as servant-in-ordinary. Davies then went as one of the official party sent to the baptism of Prince Henry in Scotland, where he first came to the attention of James VI as the author of a poem already well regarded.<br>
<br>Although clearly an able student of the law, Davies was evidently no model citizen. His &#145;flamboyant and tempestuous personality&#146; is attested by numerous infractions of the disciplinary code at the Middle Temple, not all of which can be adduced to the ritualized &#145;misrule&#146; of Candlemas  (Pawlisch, 16). He and his friend Richard Martin were temporarily expelled in 1591 for unruly behaviour. In February 1598 Davies was disbarred permanently from the society for a violent assault on the same Martin, and he returned to Oxford, apparently spending some time at New College, where it was once believed he composed <span class="italic">Nosce teipsum</span> in a fit of remorse. In Trinity term 1601 Davies secured the support of no lesser personages than Sir Robert Cecil and Sir Thomas Egerton for his readmission to the Middle Temple, which was secured by his public apology to Martin. In the same year he was returned to parliament as one of the representatives for Corfe Castle. He attained prominence in the Commons by his insistence on legislative redress to the abuse of the queen's prerogative of monopoly, much to Cecil's distaste. Yet by this time Davies's talents seem to have commended themselves to the secretary of state. When Cecil entertained the queen in 1602 at his new house in the Strand, London, Davies composed for the occasion <span class="italic">A Contention betwixt a Wife, a Widdow and a Maide</span>.<br>
<br>On the queen's death in March 1603 Davies may have accompanied Sir Robert Carey in his journey to the Scottish court, and he was certainly recorded as present during the new king's progress south. The tale that James now took Davies to his bosom as the author of the much admired <span class="italic">Nosce teipsum</span> is almost certainly apocryphal.<h2>
<a name="SolicitorgeneralforIreland"></a>Solicitor-general for Ireland</h2>Although nine years earlier James had indeed delighted to meet the author of the <span class="italic">Nosce teipsum</span>, Davies was not among the 906 new knights created in the first month of the reign. On 18 September 1603 the king did, however, write to Lord Mountjoy to cause a grant of the office of solicitor-general for Ireland to be passed under the great seal to Davies, and in the following November Davies arrived in Dublin to assume the office; he received his knighthood there at the hands of the lord deputy the following month. A few days after his arrival he sent to Cecil a graphic account of the state of Ireland. Pestilence and famine were raging, and &#145;the face of things appeared very miserable&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). But his first gloomy impressions were dissipated when he observed that the law courts were commanding respect. &#145;I conceave&#146;, he wrote, &#145;a very good hope that after a parliament wherein many mischiefs may be removed and prevented, and after the people ar acquainted with the forms of justice &hellip; this kingdom will grow humane and civile&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>This view of the civilizing power of the law and its institutions was one by which Davies set great store throughout his association with Ireland. On 20 February 1604 he sent to Cecil from Castle Reban another long letter, in which he complained of the slothfulness and ignorance of the protestant clergymen, whom he described as &#145;meer idols and cyphers, and such as cannot read their neck-verse if they should stand in need of the benefit of their clergy&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He found churches ruined and preaching neglected, and he asked that commissioners might be sent from England to inquire into these abuses. He also protested at the ease with which royal pardons were obtained in cases of robbery and murder, recommended the holding of quarter sessions, and condemned the debased quality of the coinage. That spring he went on the Leinster circuit. In April 1605 he travelled to England with Sir Richard Cooke, chief baron, to report on the state of Ireland, taking with him a letter to the lords of the council in which his &#145;industrious pains&#146; and &#145;toilsome travels through most part of the kingdom&#146; were highly commended by the lord deputy, Sir Arthur Chichester  (ibid.). He returned to Dublin in July 1605, the lords of the council showing their own appreciation of his services by ordering that Chichester pay the arrears of his allowance. In 1606, on the elevation of Sir Charles Calthorpe to the bench, Davies succeeded to the post of attorney-general for Ireland, and was afterwards called to the degree of serjeant-at-law.<h2>
<a name="LandreforminIreland"></a>Land reform in Ireland</h2>Davies firmly believed that the successful government of Ireland could not be achieved through military conquest alone, but depended instead on laying the legal foundations for a civil society. He once wrote to Cecil saying that &#145;the multitude was ever made conformable to edicts and proclamations&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). From 1606 he was busy with the management of the work deriving from the establishment of the commissions for defective titles and the implementation of arrangements for the surrender and regrant of lands by tenants of the crown. This was a crucial element in his long-standing campaign to entrench the full-scale operation of property law in Ireland as the bulwark of English rule, and was designed specifically to undermine and finally to abolish Gaelic para-legal forms of land tenure and inheritance which were much more fluid, based on kinship and the sept, and the tribal allegiances underpinning them. Religious reform was also integral to the &#145;new English&#146; project of establishing &#145;civility&#146; in Ireland, and Davies was a strong advocate of the expulsion of Catholic priests from Ireland and the firm establishment of the protestant religion. The punishment of recusancy was a political football in early seventeenth-century Ireland, but Davies was consistent in his support for the levying of penal exactions on those who failed to attend protestant churches. He also agitated for the reconstruction of the Irish polity from the ground upwards, recommending that reform of the Dublin corporation, and in particular the proscription of Catholics from the government of the city, would serve the purpose of encouraging reform in urban centres across the kingdom. Davies showed immense energy in the task of legal administration in Ireland, in the conduct of which his lifestyle was highly peripatetic, in and out of term. In May 1606 he was in Munster on assize. That summer he travelled through Monaghan, Fermanagh, and Cavan, recording observations in a long letter to Cecil. In 1607 he went on circuit through the counties of Meath, Westmeath, and Longford, and King's and Queen's counties, and reported to Cecil that it was almost a miracle to see the quiet and conformity that everywhere prevailed.<br>
<br>All was not equally well everywhere else. In September Davies sent Cecil a full report of the flight of the northern earls, and the following January he went himself to Ulster to indict Tyrone and Tyrconnell. In July he returned thither, this time with the lord deputy and the other commissioners appointed to view the escheated lands in the province. A letter from Davies to Cecil, dated 5 August 1608, gives a picturesque account of the journey, describing how the &#145;wild inhabitants&#146; of the remoter districts &#145;wondered as much to see the king's deputy as the ghosts in Virgil wondered to see &AElig;neas alive in hell&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Davies was long absorbed in the establishment of the new plantation, which made at least one false start, and profited not a little by it as one of the principal servitors in the only category (councillors of state) permitted also to undertake for estates. In all he obtained 5500 acres. It was also his counsel that secured the seizure of the upper Bann fishery, the richest in Ulster and a key means for the enticement of investors in the province.<blockquote>In the absence of fully adequate common law precedents, Davies fortified his brief &hellip; by citing &#145;divers rules of the civil law and the customary law of France agreeablee to our law in this point&#146; &hellip; Although the dictates of natural geography tell us that rivers flow towards the sea, Davies' application of the civil law led to the government's seizure of the Bann fishery because the sea flows into rivers. (Pawlisch, 173)</blockquote>It is open to question whether Davies ever really saw his posting in Ireland as anything more than a means to the advancement of a legal career in England. As early as 1610 he petitioned his patron, Salisbury, for a new appointment elsewhere. In doing so he detailed aspects of his record of reform in Ireland, citing &#145;the assimilation of the autonomous gaelic lordships to the crown, the reduction of medieval corporate liberties, the implementation of religious conformity and the reinvigoration of the Irish revenues&#146;  (Pawlisch, 30). There may have been personal reasons for his staying there, however. About March 1609, probably while in England on business connected with the Ulster plantation, Davies married Eleanor Touchet (<i>d</i>. 1652), the fifth daughter of George, Baron Audley, future earl of Castlehaven. This was not a felicitous match. The attorney-general's in-laws enjoyed unsavoury reputations. He died five years before the family's ultimate disgrace, the execution of the second earl for gross sexual misconduct against his wife the countess and her daughter, his own stepdaughter. But his own married life had been less than happy. His wife's religious exuberance was frequently aimed aggressively at her husband, the exact timing of whose demise she cheerfully prophesied. &#145;From that time until his death in 1626, Davies suffered the uncomfortable experience of staring across the breakfast table at a hopelessly insane wife dressed in mourning&#146;  (ibid., 29). The marriage produced no surviving male heirs, two sons, one an idiot, having died in minority. Davies's daughter, Lucy, was married at the age of eleven to Ferdinando Hastings, the sixth earl of Huntingdon, on condition that his estate pass to Lucy rather than his somewhat unpredictable wife. Perhaps partly in avoidance of her, Davies remained in the thick of things in Ireland for some years yet. In 1610 he defended at law the crown's plantation of Cavan against counsel under instruction from dispossessed natives. In 1612 he published his <span class="italic">Discoverie of the true causes why Ireland was never entirely subdued nor brought under obedience of the crown of England until his majesties happie reigne</span>, which argued for the full establishment of a system of law based on land rather than blood.<h2>
<a name="IrishandEnglishparliamentaryduties"></a>Irish and English parliamentary duties</h2>In 1613 the king himself picked Davies as the best-qualified candidate to take the speaker's chair when parliament opened at Dublin in May. Davies played a crucial role in contriving the first ever protestant majority in the Irish parliament, based on the enfranchisement of new boroughs created during the plantation of Munster and Ulster. The Catholic Old English disputed the validity of many returns, and contested the election of the speaker. Nominated by Sir Thomas Ridgeway, Davies, who sat as knight of the shire for Fermanagh, was chosen by the protestant majority. Thereupon Sir James Gough, as champion of the Catholic party, proposed Sir John Everard, former second justice of the king's bench, whom Davies had forced to resign on grounds of his recusancy. Everard was installed in the chair, which he then refused to vacate to make way for Davies. Therefore, Ridgeway and Sir Oliver St John &#145;took Sir John Davys by the arms, lifted him from the ground, and placed him in the chair, in Sir John Everard's lap, requiring him still to come forth of the chair&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Eventually Everard was ejected, and he and his party withdrew, angrily insisting that they would seek redress at the hands of the king himself. However, the commission of inquiry that arrived the following September confirmed Davies's election. In 1615 the attorney-general published <span class="italic">Le primer discours des cases et matters in ley resolues et adiudges en les courts del roy en cest realme</span>, translated in 1762 as <span class="italic">A Report of Cases and Matters in Law</span>, &#145;elaborating step by step the innovative judicial measures he had employed to consolidate the Tudor conquest of Ireland&#146;  (Pawlisch, 31). If it was written in the same trumpet-blowing spirit as the letter Davies had sent Salisbury in 1610, then it had precisely the same effect. A few years later Davies petitioned Buckingham for leave to lay down his commission in Ireland. On 30 October 1619 he was finally replaced by Sir William Ryves.<h2>
<a name="Kingsserjeant"></a>King's serjeant</h2>During his Irish service, Davies had spent a lot of time in England on business, and evidently maintained important political contacts. He is said to have been elected to sit for the borough of Newcastle under Lyme in the 1614 parliament, and he certainly represented the Staffordshire town in 1621. Back in 1609 the king had conferred on Davies the dignity of king's serjeant, and it was in this capacity that he now continued his professional practice in England, where he also went on circuit as a judge. The historian of his legal career in Ireland has said that Davies's charge to the jurors at York in 1620 &#145;represents a classic contemporary exposition of the jurisprudence on assize justice&#146;  (Pawlisch, 32). In 1622 Davies published a revised edition of his three major poems, <span class="italic">Nosce teipsum</span>, <span class="italic">Astrea</span>, and <span class="italic">Orchestra</span>. At some point he also abridged Coke's reports, although his labours were not published until 1651. In 1624 he translated the <span class="roman">Psalms</span>; a manuscript copy, with several poems appended, was noted by the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> as being in the Laing collection in Edinburgh University Library. These, like all his other writings, were published by Alexander Grosart in three volumes for the <span class="roman">Fuller Worthies' Library</span> between 1869 and 1876, dedicated, with his permission, to William Gladstone. The accession of Charles I in 1625 cheered Davies, who wrote that he believed the new king was &#145;like to restore the glory of our nation by his wisdom and valor&#146;  (ibid.). The author of a manuscript tract, not published until 1656, on the prerogative right to levy impositions without parliamentary consent, building his argument on the Roman-law concept of <i>ius gentium</i>, or the law of nations, Davies evidently also commended himself to the new king. In 1626 Charles appointed him chief justice of the king's bench in place of Randolph Crew, who had refused to declare the legitimacy of the forced loan.<br>
<br>Early in December 1626 Davies prepared for his new judicial appointment by purchasing the robes of office. On the night of 7 December he was at a supper party given by Lord Keeper Coventry in Westminster, and on the following morning he was found dead of apoplexy; this was the very day he was due to be installed as chief justice&#151;an act of God, wrote the English judge James Whitelocke, that prevented &#145;so inconvenient an intention to the commonwealth&#146;  (Pawlisch, 33). The funeral oration was preached by John Donne, and on 9 December Davies was interred in St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster. His wife survived him and remarried, visiting on her new husband, Sir Archibald Douglas, sufferings almost identical to those undergone by her first, who himself failed to elude her for very long, she being buried beside him in 1652.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>Davies's contemporary and posthumous influence was signal. As well as a poet noted in his time, he was an enthusiastic antiquary, and in 1592 had travelled to Leiden to meet the famous Dutch jurist and professor of civil law Paul Merula, with letters of introduction from William Camden. Davies, Sir Robert Cotton, and others were jointly engaged in re-establishing the Society of Antiquaries early in the seventeenth century. Davies's immersion in civil- and canon-law traditions was no doubt deepened during his brief association with New College, Oxford, and possibly by continental study under Merula (printed editions of Davies's youthful epigrams having allegedly originated at Middleburg). It has been cited as prima facie evidence for the need to question the hegemonic grip of common-law insularity and the ancient constitution over the minds and imaginations of early modern English lawyers. Davies's view, expressed only fleetingly, but forcefully, during the 1621 parliament, that &#145;Ireland is a member of the crown of England &hellip; [and] that this kingdom here cannot make laws to bind that kingdom, for they have a parliament of their own&#146;, raised a problem which recurred at different stages, and in differing guises, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. But it is his contribution to English &#145;imperialism&#146; in Ireland which constitutes the most substantial portion of his legacy, and in particular his expansion of the use of civil law there in an attempt to justify and consolidate English sovereignty. His assertion of an English title to Ireland by right of conquest after the conclusion of Tyrone's rising in 1603 effectively reduced the entire kingdom to the condition of virgin territory over which none but the crown could claim any proprietary right, and simultaneously eradicated the jurisdiction of ancient Brehon law. This later proved a pivotal stage in the collapse of Gaelic society in Ireland. It did much to help provoke both the flight of the northern earls and the rising of Sir Cahir O'Doherty (the first of which Davies seems to have connived at quite deliberately), events which themselves cleared the way for the plantation of Ulster. Conquest doctrine continued to serve as a justification for English sovereignty over Ireland until shortly before home rule. But Davies had an altogether more subtle impact on Anglo-Irish legal institutions and culture than his pronouncements on the extirpation of Gaelic traditions might suggest. Aspects of the Brehon code he effectively attempted to assimilate to the customary practice of the Tudor kingdom. And given the insistence of his campaign to reduce Ireland to protestant conformity, it is ironic to note, for example, that his application of canonical law in cases such as the right of ministers to hold plural livings <i>in commendam</i> had the effect of ascribing to the popish canons of Catholic Europe the status of English customary law. In this, Davies perfectly embodied some of the more fruitful contradictions of his age.<br>
