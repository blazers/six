<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Collier,  John Payne</span>  (1789&#150;1883), <span class="occ">literary editor and forger</span>, was born on 11 January 1789 in New Broad Street in the City of London, the second of five children of John Dyer Collier (1762&#150;1825) and his wife, Jane Payne (1768&#150;1833), the spirited and artistic daughter of a London sugar refiner.<h2>
<a name="Familybackgroundearlycareerandmarriage17891828"></a>Family background, early career, and marriage, 1789&#150;1828</h2>John Dyer Collier, talented, headstrong, and luckless, was the son of a prosperous London apothecary, whose capital stake of &pound;10,000, given him at his majority, he dissipated in the Spanish merino wool trade. Subsequently he tried farming in Essex, but was bankrupted in 1802; he studied law briefly and in extremes turned to journalism. He edited the <span class="italic">Monthly Register</span> for Charles and John Wyatt (1802&#150;3), translated fiction, and published an <span class="italic">Essay on the Law of Patents</span> (1803) and a <span class="italic">Life of Abraham Newland</span> (1808); in 1804 he joined the staff of <span class="italic">The Times</span> as a law and parliamentary reporter, and later moved on to the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> (1808&#150;15). In 1816 he embarked on his final literary venture with the purchase of the moribund <span class="italic">Critical Review</span>, which he converted from tory to liberal in its politics, and from post-Augustan to Romantic in its literary predilections. This he edited, with the assistance of his son, until its final collapse eighteen months later. John Payne, educated at home and taught shorthand by his father, had himself joined <span class="italic">The Times</span> by 1806, and also participated largely in the family enterprise of supplying, by subscription, handwritten newsletters to provincial papers.<br>
<br>Many details of Collier's early life are recorded in the diaries and correspondence of Henry Crabb Robinson, who lodged with the family from 1806 to 1813 and remained devoted to most of them&#151;but especially to Jane&#151;thereafter. A religious nonconformist and a liberal idealist, John Dyer Collier numbered among his acquaintances William Godwin, Thomas Holcroft, William Hazlitt, and Leigh Hunt, and through Robinson the Colliers became intimate with Charles and Mary Lamb and friendly with the Wordsworths and S. T. Coleridge. When in 1811&#150;12 Coleridge gave a series of lectures on Shakespeare and Milton, John Payne Collier took down several in his professional shorthand, to which alone they owe their preservation. Encouraged by Robinson, Collier took up the study of law and was admitted to the Middle Temple on 31 July 1811, but journalism continued to dominate his working hours. In 1812 he left <span class="italic">The Times</span> for the rival <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, but was back at <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1815 for a second stint as parliamentary reporter; after being dismissed in mid-1823 by his old comrade Thomas Barnes (1785&#150;1841), Collier returned to the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span>, where he remained until 1847. In the 1830s and 1840s he also served as theatre critic for <span class="italic">The Observer</span> and wrote, anonymously, for other periodicals.<br>
<br>On 20 August 1816 Collier married a cousin of his mother, Mary Louisa Pycroft (1787&#150;1857), the daughter of William Pycroft, a Whitechapel sugar refiner; their first child, a daughter, born in 1817, was followed over the next ten years by two sons and three further daughters. By the time of his marriage Collier had begun to collect early English literature on a modest scale but with considerable discrimination, and to publish both verse and antiquarian essays, first in the <span class="italic">British Lady's Magazine</span> (1815). He was responsible for more than forty literary reviews in his father's <span class="italic">Critical Review</span>, for which he also wrote a series of sixteen essays on pre-Restoration literature, under the heading &#145;Bibliotheca antiqua&#146; (1816&#150;17). In 1818&#150;19 Collier temporarily succeeded Frederic Shoberl (1775&#150;1853), a family friend, as editor of Ackermann's <span class="italic">Repository</span>, to which he also contributed numerous articles and poems under a variety of pseudonyms; nine essays &#145;On the English dramatic writers who preceded Shakespeare&#146; appeared in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Magazine</span> (1818&#150;21). A series of mildly indiscreet sketches of leading barristers and magistrates, signed &#145;Amicus Curiae&#146; and first published in Leigh Hunt's <span class="italic">Examiner</span>, were collected by Collier as <span class="italic">Criticisms on the Bar</span> (1819), and proved an embarrassment to his legal career&#151;&#145;foolish, flippant, and fatal to my prospects, if ever I had any&#146;, he remarked of it later  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Almost simultaneously he suffered a &#145;scrape&#146; with the House of Commons over an episode improperly reported in the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, and while he was pardoned, and even praised for his candour and courage in response, the long-term professional effect was again negative. He was not called to the bar until 6 February 1829, and never seriously practised.<br>
<br>Collier's two-volume <span class="italic">Poetical Decameron</span>, a series of informative but arcane dialogues on early English popular literature, appeared in 1820, and in 1822 he brought out, privately and anonymously, <span class="italic">The Poet's Pilgrimage</span>, a laboured Spenserian allegory, which in old age he believed his own best claim to remembrance; it was reissued under his name in 1825, and drew tempered praise from Charles Lamb, its dedicatee. His first editorial work (1825&#150;7) was the completion of a new edition of Robert Dodsley's <span class="italic">Select Collection of Old Plays</span>, begun by Octavius Gilchrist; Collier's notes, signed &#145;C.&#146;, appear throughout the twelve volumes, and he added six plays previously unedited. Five further plays edited by Collier were separately published by Septimus Prowett in 1828&#150;9 and reissued as <span class="italic">Five Old Plays</span> in 1833. The same publisher in 1828 engaged Collier to provide the text for a series of engravings by George Cruikshank illustrating the popular Punch and Judy puppet show. By 1881 at least eight English editions of the resulting <span class="italic">Punch and Judy</span> had appeared; Collier's play-text, based loosely on a performance by Piccini, remains standard, and his introductory history of puppet theatre is still often cited.<h2>
<a name="Literaryachievementandliteraryforgery18281837"></a>Literary achievement and literary forgery, 1828&#150;1837</h2>By the late 1820s Collier was at work on his most important, if flawed, work of scholarship, a <span class="italic">History of English Dramatic Poetry and Annals of the Stage</span> (to about 1660), which John Murray published in three volumes in 1831 (<i>HEDP</i>). Although some whimsical fictions and slight literary impostures had found their way into Collier's earlier works&#151;from the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span> in 1819 to verse by &#145;Lord Byron&#146; in <span class="italic">Punch and Judy</span>&#151;here, for the first time <i>in extenso</i>, fabrications of historical evidence and documentary text are interspersed in an otherwise meticulous and original scholarly work. Some twenty instances of fakery have by now been identified in <span class="italic">HEDP</span>, mostly involving text for which no source has ever come to light, but several are based upon physical forgeries in the British Museum manuscript collections, the State Paper Office, and among the Alleyn and Henslowe papers at Dulwich College. Collier's personal responsibility both for the unsubstantiated reports and for the forged handwritten material in public repositories was long disputed, not least by himself, but the accumulation of subsequent evidence seems to rule out the agency of any other mischievous perpetrator. Why he should thus have marred a work of great merit, and blighted a literary career already successfully advanced, has always vexed his biographers, but whatever the reason or reasons, once indulged, his propensity for invention never subsided. For decades, however, no one suspected <span class="italic">HEDP</span> of corruption, and it served most Victorians as a blameless authority and the principal guide to its subjects.<br>
<br>Collier dedicated <span class="italic">HEDP</span> to William Spencer Cavendish (1790&#150;1858), sixth duke of Devonshire, the leading private collector of old English drama, who had befriended him and commissioned him at &pound;100 a year to be his part-time librarian in London. For a time Devonshire's patronage made the lucrative appointment of Examiner of Plays, in succession to George Colman the younger, seem a possibility, but this came to nothing. Collier oversaw for the duke a fine facsimile of an Inigo Jones sketchbook in 1831, organized his old plays, and procured for him many significant additions, including quartos from the Richard Heber dispersal of 1834&#150;6; he also contributed valuable catalogue notes to part IV of that sale, the richest portion of Heber's early poetry and popular prose (1834), and on the day bought what he could for himself, as well as for Devonshire.<br>
<br>Under Devonshire's sponsorship Collier became in 1832 the twelfth member of the new Garrick Club, long to be a favourite haunt, although he was later passed over for the Athenaeum. In December 1830 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, put forward by Francis Douce and Thomas Amyot; he later served as treasurer (1847&#150;9) and vice-president (1849&#150;56), and recycled at least one youthful invention, originally aired in the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span>, in the society's <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>. Following the publication of <span class="italic">HEDP</span> he gained access to the largely uninvestigated collection of books and manuscripts kept at Bridgewater House by Lord Francis Leveson Gower, afterwards Lord Egerton (1833) and earl of Ellesmere (1846). Collier produced an elaborate printed catalogue of the rarer English books in the Bridgewater collection (1837), and in 1840 edited a selection of <span class="italic">Egerton Papers</span> for the Camden Society. The family muniments, particularly those relating to James I's chancellor, Sir Thomas Egerton, yielded material for three Shakespearian tracts, published by Collier through the learned bookseller Thomas Rodd: <span class="italic">New Facts Relating to the Life of Shakespeare</span> (1835), <span class="italic">New Particulars etc.</span> (1836), and <span class="italic">Farther Particulars etc.</span> (1839). Alongside genuine material, however, Collier again printed a number of forgeries and fabrications, including &#145;antique&#146; ballads of his own composition, as well as several &#145;contemporary&#146; letters and documents referring to Shakespeare that he claimed to have found among Egerton's uncatalogued papers.<h2>
<a name="Shakespeareandotherstudies18371851"></a>Shakespeare and other studies, 1837&#150;1851</h2>In 1837 Collier became a sub-editor at the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, and for the next two or three years was responsible for many of the paper's political columns and leading articles. By 1841, however, he was displaced and his salary cut, and he returned to the tedious routine of the parliamentary gallery. He now projected and advertised (in <span class="italic">Reasons for a New Edition of Shakespeare</span>, 1841) an elaborate eight-volume edition of Shakespeare, which was published by Whittaker in 1842&#150;4 and embodies some spurious &#145;contemporary&#146; annotations from a <span class="roman">First Folio</span> at Bridgewater House. A few new details in the life of Shakespeare included there are also spurious, and many old impostures are repeated. In 1838 Collier participated in founding the Camden Society, devoted to reprinting &#145;materials for the Civil, Ecclesiastical, or Literary History of the United Kingdom&#146;, and, in 1840, the Percy and Shakespeare societies (ballads and popular literature; drama and theatrical history). For the Camden Society he produced four volumes, including the first edition of John Bale's <span class="italic">Kynge Johan</span> (1838), prepared from the manuscript he had purchased on Devonshire's behalf, and for the Percy Society he was responsible for ten more little volumes over the years 1840&#150;44. In addition to serving as director of the Shakespeare Society and editing four volumes of its papers, Collier wrote or edited a further twenty-two volumes under its imprint (1841&#150;51). These included a life of Edward Alleyn (1841) and an edition of Philip Henslowe's diary (1845), both based upon manuscripts at Dulwich College, and both valuable in part, but again riddled with fabricated material, some of it based on forged interpolations in the Dulwich originals. Two volumes of extracts from the registers of the Stationers' Company (Shakespeare Society, 1848&#150;9), and a continuation in <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> (1861&#150;3), are likewise contaminated: several forged additions to the original registers, especially those attributing authorship, have been blamed upon Collier, as well as a large number of otherwise unknown &#145;contemporary&#146; ballads published as illustrative matter in the extracts.<br>
<br>In 1847 a royal commission was appointed to inquire into the management of the British Museum, and through the influence of its chairman, Lord Ellesmere, Collier was named secretary at a stipend of &pound;300 a year for the limited duration of the inquiry; he thereupon resigned from the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, which paid him less for more work. In two privately printed tracts addressed to his patron, and in appearances before the commission as an expert witness, Collier determinedly opposed Sir Anthony Panizzi (1797&#150;1879), then keeper of printed books, by advocating a printed rather than a manuscript catalogue of the library. His views were publicly ridiculed by Panizzi, and the final report of the commission (1850) endorsed Panizzi's original plan. Collier was unsuccessful in an attempt to rejoin <span class="italic">The Times</span>, but was granted a civil-list pension of &pound;100. He left London for good in the spring of 1850, taking his wife and four daughters to Holyport, Berkshire; at the end of 1853, following the death from consumption of the two eldest daughters, the family moved for the last time, to Riverside, Maidenhead.<h2>
<a name="ThePerkinsfolioandColliersexposure18521862"></a>The Perkins folio and Collier's exposure, 1852&#150;1862</h2>In <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> for 31 January 1852 Collier announced his discovery of a <span class="roman">Shakespeare Second Folio</span> (1632) extensively &#145;corrected&#146; in a mid-seventeenth-century hand. In 1853 he published the annotations, mostly providing plausible new readings, as a volume of notes and emendations to his 1842&#150;4 Shakespeare, and gave in the preface an account (later somewhat adjusted) of his purchase of the volume from the bookseller Thomas Rodd the younger (<i>d</i>. 1849). This was followed in the same year by a one-volume edition of Shakespeare incorporating the emendations, and in 1858 by a new six-volume critical edition; the folio itself, usually called the &#145;Perkins folio&#146; from an ownership inscription on its cover, was presented by Collier to the duke of Devonshire in 1853.<br>
<br>Over the next years the emendations of Collier's anonymous &#145;Old Corrector&#146; were attacked on textual grounds by a wide range of commentators, including his young friend J. O. Halliwell, later Halliwell-Phillipps (1820&#150;1889), his former friend Alexander Dyce (1798&#150;1869), and his professed adversaries S. W. Singer (1783&#150;1858), Howard Staunton (1810&#150;1874), C. M. Ingleby (1823&#150;1886), and A. E. Brae (1800/01&#150;1881). Brae alone, in newspaper articles and in <span class="italic">Literary Cookery</span> (1855), suggested the possibility of forgery, and simultaneously cast doubt on the shorthand transcripts of Coleridge's 1811&#150;12 lectures, which Collier had announced in 1854; this provoked Collier to an unsuccessful libel action against the publisher of the pamphlet, John Russell Smith. Other of Collier's &#145;discoveries&#146; were questioned in the 1850s, chiefly by Halliwell, who condemned some of the Bridgewater papers in 1853, never suggesting, however, that Collier had forged them. Collier himself continued his editorial labours, preparing a volume of Michael Drayton's poems for the Roxburghe Club (1856) and beginning an elaborate new edition of Spenser, which finally appeared, in five handsome volumes, in 1862. His patrons Ellesmere and Devonshire died in 1857 and 1858, and on 10 December 1857 his wife, Mary Louisa, of cancer.<br>
<br>Continued speculation about the &#145;Perkins folio&#146; led Sir Frederic Madden, keeper of manuscripts at the British Museum, to request a sight of the book, and in May 1859 the seventh duke of Devonshire placed it on loan there, where Madden, his assistant N. E. S. A. Hamilton, and Nevil Maskelyne, keeper of the mineral department, examined it carefully. Hamilton and Maskelyne published their findings in three letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span> (2 and 16 July), asserting that the annotations in ink were recent forgeries in a mock seventeenth-century hand, frequently corresponding (in content) to pencilled notes in an undisguised modern hand, found elsewhere in the margins; furthermore, microscopic analysis by Maskelyne showed that in some cases &#145;old&#146; ink notes had been penned over similar pencillings, likewise undeniably modern. Collier replied on 7 and 20 July, again testifying that all the ink notes had been present when he purchased the book, and declaring&#151;although he had not yet been accused of it&#151;that he had inserted none of the suspect pencil or ink annotations. Hamilton, aided and encouraged by Staunton, Ingleby, and Madden, continued to pursue the matter, and to work up a case against Collier himself. Early in 1860 Hamilton published an inquiry into the Perkins affair that also questioned some of the Bridgewater and Dulwich papers, as well as a petition in the State Paper Office, naming Shakespeare, which had first surfaced in <span class="italic">HEDP</span>. Collier immediately published a reply in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> (6 Feb 1860), expanding it to a pamphlet in the following weeks, but Hamilton's attack was soon followed by others, including a review of the controversy by T. D. Hardy of the State Paper Office (1860) and a lengthy <span class="italic">Complete View</span> by Ingleby (1861).<h2>
<a name="Rarebooksrevisionsanddeath18621883"></a>Rare books, revisions, and death, 1862&#150;1883</h2>Collier's steadfast refusal to comment further on the various accusations&#151;of forgery in person, of complicity in deceit, or even of sustained carelessness&#151;convinced many of his guilt, but by 1862, when he published his long-delayed Spenser to critical approval, public interest in the Perkins controversy was all but extinct. Unwilling to remain idle, in May 1862 Collier projected a scheme of reprinting rare English works of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in limited editions offered only by subscription. Through 1871 no fewer than eighty-one volumes appeared, ranging from pamphlets of a few pages to substantial texts such as <span class="italic">England's Parnassus</span> and <span class="italic">Tottell's Miscellany</span>. At the age of seventy-four Collier began work on his <span class="italic">Bibliographical and Critical Account of the Rarest Books in the English Language</span>, a compilation of old and new notes on minor Tudor and Stuart literature, published in two stout volumes by Joseph Lilly in 1865; it was immediately reprinted in New York and remains valuable for the out-of-the-way material it describes, despite its perpetuation of fabricated report. In the 1860s and 1870s Collier privately published several other books, including a romanticized autobiography for the years 1832&#150;3 (<span class="italic">An Old Man's Diary</span>, 1871&#150;2) and selections of ballads both from the seventeenth century (<span class="italic">Broadside Black-Letter Ballads</span>, 1868) and of his own composition (<span class="italic">A Few Odds and Ends</span>, 1871); he described his <span class="italic">Twenty-Five Old Ballads</span> (1869) as &#145;taken&#146; from a seventeenth-century manuscript, but all the ballads were in fact written by Collier himself.<br>
<br>Between 1875 and 1878 Collier published his final edition of Shakespeare, issued to subscribers in forty-three parts, purporting to offer &#145;the purest text and the briefest notes&#146;. On its completion he revised, very lightly, his <span class="italic">History of English Dramatic Poetry</span> for George Bell (1879), modifying only a few of the suspect entries of 1831. Now aged ninety, increasingly frail and nearly blind, Collier seldom left his home at Maidenhead, where an unmarried daughter kept house for him. He died there on 17 September 1883, and was buried in Bray churchyard three days later, survived by two sons and two daughters. Many of his rare English books had earlier been sold to J. O. Halliwell or to Frederic Ouvry (1814&#150;1881), Collier's nephew by marriage, and the bulk of his remaining books and papers were offered by Sothebys on 7&#150;9 August 1884, when they made &pound;2105 16<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. At that sale the British Museum acquired one of Collier's forged volumes of ballads (lot 214, now Add. MS 32380) and Dulwich College purchased a transcript in Collier's hand of Edward Alleyn's diary (lot 200), examination of which confirmed the case for his having forged interpolations in the original manuscript. Other papers remained in the family, but most, including Collier's late diary (1872&#150;82), his 1811 shorthand notes of Coleridge's lectures, an incomplete autobiography, and the so-called Hall commonplace book, containing ballads in a faked seventeenth-century hand, have now found institutional homes, principally at the Folger Shakespeare Library, Washington, DC.<h2>
<a name="Personallifeandreputation"></a>Personal life and reputation</h2>Collier's personal life, although dogged by overwork and ill health, was not overall an unhappy one. Despite the falling away of old friends such as Frederic Madden and Alexander Dyce in the mid-century, he was cherished in old age as &#145;the Nestor of all living Restorers of our Old Literature&#146; by Edward Arber  (<span class="italic">Transcript of the Registers of the Stationers' Company</span>, 1875, 30), flattered by Swinburne, and courted by such new friends as J. W. Ebsworth (1824&#150;1908) in England and H. H. Furness (among many others) in America, where his following remained loyal. His critical and editorial achievement over seventy years would ensure him a high place between Edmond Malone and the moderns, had not much of it been tainted by fraud or caprice, or by the contagion of doubt that exposures have fostered. Countless genuine and acute scholarly observations&#151;many of them still held in suspicion, unjustly&#151;will always be overshadowed by a minority of impostures. Even his 1862 Spenser, regarded by G. F. Warner as &#145;an excellent edition&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) and widely employed by Collier's editorial successors, incorporates fabricated emendations by Michael Drayton&#151;forged in Collier's own copy of the 1612&#150;13 folio&#151;and the task of sorting out Collier's true from false scholarship, in literally hundreds of questioned or questionable instances, has continued for a century and more.<br>
