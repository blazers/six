<span class="headword">Eyton,  Robert William</span>  (1815&#150;1881), <span class="occ">historian</span>, born at Wellington vicarage, Shropshire, on 21 December 1815, was the fourth son, and seventh of ten children, of the Revd John Eyton (1778&#150;1823) and his wife, Anna Maria (1787&#150;1825), only child of Edmund Joseph Plowden (1756&#150;1838), of Plowden, and his wife, also Anna Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Burton. The Plowdens were Roman Catholic, but the future Mrs John Eyton was brought up in her mother's faith, that of the Church of England. Eyton thus descended from two of Shropshire's oldest families; his father's family, seated at Eyton upon the Weald Moors by the mid-twelfth century, he considered to be a probable cadet branch of the Norman Pantulfs, barons of Wem.<br>
<br>Orphaned young, Eyton lived at first with his Plowden grandfather (who left his grandchildren very well provided for), probably at Tong Castle in Shropshire and later at Haughton Hall near Shifnal, also in Shropshire; after 1830 he was generally with his great-uncle Robert Burton, of Longner near Shrewsbury. He was entered at his father's school, Rugby, in 1829; the following year, however, he was moved to Bridgnorth grammar school, then flourishing under Thomas Rowley. In 1835 he matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, where he was a Fell's exhibitioner; having graduated BA (with second-class honours in <i>literae humaniores</i>) in 1839, he proceeded MA in 1845. Also in 1839 he was ordained deacon, became curate of Morville and Aston Eyre, Shropshire, with Tickwood House as his residence, and on 26 September married Mary Elizabeth, also known as Eliza (<i>d</i>. 1883), daughter of the Revd James Watts, vicar of Ledbury, Herefordshire. Eyton was ordained priest in 1840, and in 1841 he was instituted to Ryton rectory, near Shifnal, a good living in his own patronage. Between 1840 and 1850 he and his wife had three sons and four daughters, and in 1844&#150;5 Eyton built a very large new rectory at Ryton.<br>
<br>Eyton was assisted in his small parish by successive curates; one, appointed in 1852, stayed until about 1861. Those years saw the appearance of his <span class="italic">Antiquities of Shropshire</span>, issued to subscribers in forty-eight parts between 1853 and 1860 and forming twelve octavo volumes. With Eyton's brother Walter as business manager, the work paid its way. Its quality was quickly recognized. Sir William Hardy placed Eyton far ahead of all county historians, and Chester Waters acknowledged that he stood alone in their company. Among them Eyton was pre-eminent in the critical use of original records to trace the descent of feudal estates and delineate the genealogies and public lives of their lords. <span class="italic">Antiquities of Shropshire</span> remains &#145;the most important single work ever devoted to the history of Shropshire&#146;  (Mason), and Eyton's single-handed completion of it was ensured in part by the practical elimination of topographical and architectural description but mainly by his limitation of the work to the 250-odd years between the conquest and the reign of Edward II, a period of which he &#145;was peculiarly the master&#146;  (<span class="italic">VCH Shropshire</span>, 1.xxi). Eyton corresponded widely with scholars and others who shared his interests: Hardy and Colonel George Wrottesley may be instanced, and also Sir Thomas Phillipps, whose invitation to Middle Hill he adroitly avoided. In 1857 he wrote disinterestedly&#151;not wishing to do the work himself&#151;to suggest materials for inclusion in the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span>.<br>
<br>Eyton left Ryton in 1863, disposed of the advowson there, and spent his remaining years in the south of England. He had sold his library (which he was later to regret), but he kept his manuscript collections (most of which, after his death, were bought by the British Museum) and soon returned to his favourite studies, which claimed him until a few weeks before his death. Important works appeared, notably the <span class="italic">Itinerary</span> of Henry II (1878) and <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> studies of Dorset, Somerset, and Staffordshire (1877&#150;81); and there were contributions to the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Shropshire Archaeological Society</span> (a full list of his works is in volume 10, 1887, 6&#150;7) and the William Salt Archaeological Society's <span class="italic">Collections</span>. A Lincolnshire Domesday study remained unpublished. In his leisure Eyton bred pheasants; &#145;his notes&#146;, according to his grandson, &#145;on their pedigrees and performances are as painstaking and meticulous &hellip; as any on the fortunes of FitzAlan or Le Strange&#146;. He also produced fine petit point pictures. All his occupations were consistent with frequent moves: after residing at Calehill Park, Ashford, Kent (1863&#150;7), Eyton lived at Ripple Court near Dover (1867&#150;71) and then at Albury House near Guildford, Surrey (1871&#150;3). He lived from 1873 until about 1877 at Iwerne Minster, Dorset, and then until 1879 at Cattistock rectory, Somerset. Thereafter he lived at Winchfield House, near Basingstoke, Hampshire, where he died on 8 September 1881, having suffered from cancer and asthma for some time. He was buried on 13 September at Winchfield parish church.<br>
