<span class="headword">Robertson,  Muriel</span>  (1883&#150;1973), <span class="occ">protozoologist and bacteriologist</span>, was born on 8 April 1883 in Glasgow, the seventh child and fourth daughter of Robert Andrew Robertson (1842&#150;1899), a distinguished engineer, and his wife, Elizabeth Ritter (<i>b</i>. 1851), originally from Limavady, co. Londonderry. Her early education at home, with tutors and governesses, stimulated a lively interest in languages, literature, philosophy, and travel, which she maintained throughout her life. Her formal education started in 1901 at the University of Glasgow, where she studied for an arts degree. However, it was the preliminary science course which introduced her to the pleasures of research. While she was still an undergraduate Graham Kerr, the professor of zoology, gave her a bench in the laboratory to work on protozoa. In 1905 she was awarded her MA and published her first scientific paper.<br>
<br>Robertson continued her researches at Glasgow until 1909, visiting Ceylon in the summer of 1907 to study the trypanosomes (protozoan parasites) of reptiles. In 1909 she joined Professor E. A. Minchin at the Lister Institute in London and, although officially retired in 1948, continued to work there until 1962. In 1911 she took up a temporary appointment as protozoologist to the protectorate of Uganda, working with Lyndhurst Duke on the trypanosomes causing sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis). She succeeded in elucidating the life cycle of <i>T. gambiense</i>, both in blood and in its insect vector, the tsetse fly. This work resulted in several papers, the most important of which appeared in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span> (203, 1913, 161&#150;84). In the papers the soundness of her scientific observations was matched by the elegance of her illustrations.<br>
<br>In the 1930s Robertson started a collaboration with W. R. Kerr of the Veterinary Research Laboratories in Belfast, investigating infertility and abortion in cattle resulting from infection by <i>Trichomonas foetus</i>. Once a year Kerr spent a week at the Lister Institute and once a year Robertson spent a week in Belfast; in between they maintained contact by exchanging weekly protocols. During both world wars she was asked to work on pathogenic bacteria infecting war wounds and made major contributions to the identification of <i>Cl. welchii</i>, <i>Cl. septique</i>, and <i>Cl. oedematiens</i>, the causative agents of gas gangrene. Her name is remembered by many bacteriologists by &#145;Robertson's cooked meat medium&#146; which she developed for growing anaerobic bacteria.<br>
<br>Those who knew Robertson described her as a patrician intellectual, and commented that throughout her life she maintained the bearing and outlook of an Edwardian gentlewoman. Although her manners were impeccable she could be ruthless in scientific discussion and did not suffer fools gladly. Autocratic in the laboratory, she insisted on a high standard of work from students and co-workers but nevertheless inspired admiration and affection from younger colleagues. During her seventies and eighties her slight, grey-haired figure still continued to be seen at scientific meetings. In all, her career continued for over fifty years. A member of many scientific societies, she was elected to the Royal Society in 1947, and on her eightieth birthday she gave the Marjory Stephenson memorial lecture of the Society for General Microbiology. In the late 1950s her health began to fail, and she moved from London to Cambridge. In the 1960s she returned to Limavady, where she lived with her sister Dorothy in the old family home. She died, unmarried, on 14 June 1973 at Altnagelvin Hospital, Londonderry.<br>
