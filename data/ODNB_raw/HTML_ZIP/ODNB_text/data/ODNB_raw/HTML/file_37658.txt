<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Laughton,  Charles</span>  (1899&#150;1962), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 1 July 1899 at the Victoria Hotel, Scarborough, the eldest of the three sons (there were no daughters) of Robert Laughton, a prosperous hotelier, and his wife, Elizabeth Conlon. He spent a childhood largely tormented by a glandular problem which made him constantly overweight and therefore unpopular at school and indeed at home, where his early determination to become an actor met severe parental opposition.<br>
<br>Brought up as a Catholic, Laughton was educated at Stonyhurst College, where even one of his few schoolfriends described him as &#145;the ungainliest of boys with a huge head&#146;. He was sent, against his wishes, to study the hotel trade at Claridge's in London before being called up at the end of the First World War, but he was rapidly invalided out of the army after being gassed on the western front in 1918.<br>
<br>On returning to his parents in Scarborough, Laughton continued to train in hotel management until in 1925 he at last defied the family and enrolled as a drama student at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, where two years later he won the gold medal and was immediately given his start in the professional theatre by one of his teachers, the Russian director Theodore Komisarjevsky. His earliest stage roles at Barnes and the Everyman in Hampstead in 1926 were in classic Russian plays, but in 1928, at the Little Theatre in London, he first made his name in the type of role which was to become his hallmark: that of the neurotic, greedy, sinister villain in <span class="italic">A Man with Red Hair</span>, by Hugh Walpole. From there Laughton progressed to two more familiar roles, Poirot and Pickwick, before scoring another big success as the Chicago gangster loosely modelled on Al Capone in <span class="italic">On the Spot</span> (1930), by Edgar Wallace. He made his New York d&eacute;but in 1931 as the squalid murderer in <span class="italic">Payment Deferred</span> before accepting a Hollywood offer, which took him to California for <span class="italic">The Old Dark House</span> (1932) and his first Nero in <span class="italic">The Sign of the Cross</span> (1932).<br>
<br>It was back in England for Alexander Korda in 1933 that Laughton made his screen name in <span class="italic">The Private Life of Henry VIII</span> at the start of a sequence of major cinema biographies&#151;<span class="italic">The Barretts of Wimpole Street</span> (1934), <span class="italic">Mutiny on the Bounty</span> (1935), <span class="italic">Rembrandt</span> (1936), and the unfinished <span class="italic">I, Claudius</span> (1936)&#151;which were to see him at the very peak of his reflective, anguished talent for larger-than-life monsters of reality.<br>
<br>In 1933 Laughton joined the Old Vic Company for an impressive range of stage work (<span class="italic">Henry VIII</span> again, <span class="italic">The Cherry Orchard</span>, <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span>, <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>), and in 1936 he was the first English actor ever to be invited to appear at the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise in Paris, where he played Moli&egrave;re's <span class="italic">Le m&eacute;decin malgr&eacute; lui</span>. He then settled in California, where, despite occasional returns to the theatre (notably in the first production of Bertolt Brecht's <span class="italic">The Life of Galileo</span> in 1947, which he also adapted), he focused mainly on such films as <span class="italic">Jamaica Inn</span> (1939), <span class="italic">The Hunchback of Notre Dame</span> (1939), <span class="italic">Witness for the Prosecution</span> (1957), <span class="italic">Spartacus</span> (1960), and <span class="italic">Advise and Consent</span> (1962), returning only rarely to Britain and only notably for David Lean's <span class="italic">Hobson's Choice</span> in 1954.<br>
<br>In the following year Laughton made his only picture as director, <span class="italic">Night of the Hunter</span>, with Robert Mitchum, which is now regarded as one of the best <i>films noirs</i> ever made in Hollywood; but then, as if aware that his time was running out and his film career waning, he returned to Britain to make one last West End appearance in <span class="italic">The Party</span> (1958), for which he discovered the actor Albert Finney straight from drama school.<br>
<br>The following summer Laughton went to Stratford upon Avon in a remarkably starry season which also featured Paul Robeson, Edith Evans, Laurence Olivier, and Sam Wanamaker, working for such directors as Tony Richardson, Glen Byam Shaw, and the man who was immediately to succeed Shaw at Stratford and create the Royal Shakespeare Company, Peter Hall. Laughton played Bottom in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> (Finney and Vanessa Redgrave were among the young lovers) and Lear in <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, but it was already apparent that he was having trouble with his memory, and he never again appeared on stage or in Britain.<br>
<br>&#145;With Charles&#146;, said Laughton's first great producer, Alexander Korda, &#145;acting was a kind of childbirth; what he needed was a midwife, not a director&#146;, and it is arguable that the performances that might have been, such as the abortive <span class="italic">I, Claudius</span>, were almost as important as those he actually gave. Of those performances he did give, it is the biographical (Rembrandt, Henry VIII, Captain Bligh of the <i>Bounty</i>) that stay in the memory, as well as those in which he was able to convey some aspect of the double life he had always been forced to lead on account of his homosexuality. Back in 1929, on 10 February, he had married the <span class="italic">Bride of Frankenstein</span> actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57311/', "Elsa Lanchester (1902&#150;1986)")</script>, herself also always more attracted to her own sex, and although they remained married until his death it was inevitably a relationship of convenience to them both, rather than of lifelong happiness for either. Elsa was the daughter of James Sullivan, an Irish worker in a black-lead factory, and his wife <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56471/', "Edith Lanchester")</script>, an active member of the Social Democratic Federation. They had no children, but remained united by a shared belief in social revolution and the desire to push out the barriers of pre-war Hollywood tolerance as far as they could safely be pushed without ruin to either career or immigrant status.<br>
<br>Throughout this long marriage, Laughton's homosexuality undoubtedly caused him great unhappiness, and if there was any one key to his always theatrical greatness on screen it was perhaps this lifelong sense of being a misfit, uneasy in his own skin, and forever on the outside of social, sexual, and familial demands on his upbringing and conditioning. An American citizen from 1950, Laughton died at his Hollywood home on 15 December 1962; some years later, the Scarborough hotel that had been the root of his family fortune was washed away to sea in a cliff collapse. &#145;You don't direct Laughton in a picture,&#146; noted Alfred Hitchcock, &#145;all you can do is referee it.&#146;<br>
