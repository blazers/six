<span class="headword">Trelawny,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1699, <em>d.</em> 1754), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was baptized on 9 July 1699 at Trelawne, near Looe, Cornwall, the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27689/', "Sir Jonathan Trelawny, third baronet (1650&#150;1721)")</script>, bishop of Winchester, and his wife, Rebecca Hele (1670&#150;1710), daughter of Thomas Hele of Babcombe, Devon. He was educated at Westminster School, where he was a queen's scholar, from 1713, and Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 27 June 1717, but did not take a degree. His father had consolidated and extended the Trelawny family's electoral influence in Cornwall, and in 1723 he was returned to parliament as member for West Looe, one of the family boroughs. He supported Sir Robert Walpole's ministry, and was commissioner of victualling from 21 October 1725 until 1732. After Walpole appointed him a commissioner of customs at Edinburgh, he vacated his parliamentary seat in December 1732. He held the Edinburgh position until 1737, but in 1734 he left Scotland to join the British army's campaigns against the French in the War of the Polish Succession. In his absence he was elected MP for East and West Looe, but was disqualified because of his customs position. The next year his brother Sir John Trelawny, bt (1691&#150;1756), transferred the family estates to him in return for Trelawny taking over his brother's debts. To pay the sum Trelawny had to mortgage the Cornish estates to Sir Charles Wager. Details of his first marriage are unknown. His second marriage, on 8 November 1737, was to Amoretta, daughter of John Crawford, with whom he had one son, who died in infancy and was buried with his mother in St Catherine's Church, Jamaica, in November 1741.<br>
<br>In August 1736 Trelawny was offered the position of governor of Jamaica; he was formally appointed in June 1737, and assumed office on 30 April 1738. Involved in the War of Jenkins's Ear and the War of the Austrian Succession, Trelawny favoured attacks on the Spanish <i>guarda-costas</i> to counter their depredations on English shipping. He raised Jamaican independent companies and slaves for the ill-starred attack on Cartagena in 1741. He accompanied Vice-Admiral Edward Vernon and Brigadier-General Thomas Wentworth in the attack on Panama in 1742, a scheme he backed. In the same year he quarrelled with Rear-Admiral Sir Chaloner Ogle over methods of pressing seamen at Jamaica. In 1743 Trelawny was appointed colonel and captain of the 49th regiment of foot in Jamaica. In 1748 he joined Admiral Sir Charles Knowles in the capture of Fort St Louis on Hispaniola.<br>
<br>Trelawny was a successful governor of Jamaica; even though he had little prior administrative experience, he proved to be a tactful, moderate negotiator with various political factions on the island. He consolidated his governorship as early as 1739, when he agreed a settlement with the maroons that helped to secure internal peace in Jamaica. He avoided serious clashes with the planter-dominated assembly, and usually supported them in their disputes with the judiciary and the council. But he considered that the assembly held too much power and advocated changes to imperial governance, notably that parliament should intervene to resolve squabbles between governors and assemblies. Metropolitan authorities did not pursue this suggestion.<br>
<br>In 1751 Trelawny asked to be relieved of his governorship on grounds of ill health. He was by this time a wealthy man. He had paid off the mortgage on the Cornish estates by 1744, and in addition to his salary as governor and the revenues of the estates enjoyed payments from the Pelham ministry, whose candidates he regularly returned at East and West Looe. His financial situation was still further improved when he married, on 2 February 1752, Catherine Penny, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Douce, widow of the former Jamaican attorney-general Robert Penny, from whom she had inherited a fortune estimated at between &pound;30,000 and &pound;40,000 in Jamaican currency. Retirement could now follow. In September 1752 his successor, Charles Knowles, arrived and Trelawny left Jamaica on 25 November. He took with him the gratitude of the house of assembly for his sound administration in Jamaica. Delayed in his homecoming by being shipwrecked off the Isle of Wight, he arrived in London on 28 April 1753. He died at Hungerford Park on 16 January 1754. He bequeathed his Cornwall properties for life to his brother Sir John, and afterwards to Harry Trelawny, his cousin and brother-in-law, who eventually succeeded as fifth baronet.<br>

<a name="cosubject_27690"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Trelawny</span>, sixth baronet  (1722/3&#150;1772), <span class="occ">colonial governor and naval officer</span>, was the first son of Captain William Trelawny, Edward Trelawny's first cousin, and his wife, Mary, eldest daughter of William Bisset of Westminster. Educated at Westminster School, where he was admitted in 1733 aged ten, William married his cousin Laetitia (<i>d</i>. 1772), daughter and heir of Sir Harry Trelawny, at some time in or before 1755. They had two children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48167/', "Harry Trelawny (bap. 1756, d. 1834)")</script> and Laetitia Anne (<i>d</i>. 1845), who married Paul Trehy Ourry MP. William joined the navy early in life, and was appointed lieutenant in 1743, master and commander in 1754, and post captain in 1756. He served in the navy during the Seven Years' War, and was MP for East and West Looe from 16 May 1757 until June 1767. He succeeded Sir Harry Trelawny as baronet in 1762. As head of the Trelawny interest he uneasily co-operated with his cousin James Buller, whose influence in the Looe seats was increasing. In the Commons he usually supported the government of the day. He vacated his seat on being appointed governor of Jamaica, a position he held from 1768 to 1772. Though he knew little about Jamaica before taking up his appointment, he earned the respect of the creole &eacute;lite in that island for steering a sensible political course at a time when the assembly and council of Jamaica were frequently at loggerheads. He died at Spanish Town from a fever on 11 December 1772, a few months after his wife, who had died on 24 August; the assembly voted him a public funeral at a cost of 1000 guineas, which took place on 13 December 1772 in Spanish Town. The Jamaican parish of Trelawny was named after him.<br>
