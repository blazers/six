<span class="headword">Livingstone,  John</span>  (1603&#150;1672), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister in the Netherlands</span>, was born on 21 June 1603 at Monyabrock, Kilsyth, Stirlingshire, one of three sons of William Livingstone (<i>c</i>.1576&#150;1641), minister of Kilsyth and afterwards of Lanark, and his wife, Agnes (<i>c</i>.1585&#150;1617), daughter of Alex Livingstone, portioner of Falkirk and brother of the laird of Belstane. He was educated from 1613 at Stirling grammar school and graduated MA in 1621 after four years' study under Robert Blair at the University of Glasgow. Despite his father's wish for him to live as a country gentleman, he decided to study theology at St Andrews and was licensed to preach in 1625. He acted as assistant in the parish of Torphichen from 1626 until told by the presbytery to leave in October 1627, and was afterwards chaplain to the earl and countess of Wigtown until August 1630. He was in great demand as a preacher: famously in June 1630 his sermon at Shotts, Lanarkshire, was said to have affected five hundred people.<br>
<br>Despite his popularity Livingstone's steadfast refusal to promise obedience to the five articles of Perth prevented his receiving ordination in Scotland, so in 1630 he travelled to Ireland, a country with which he was to keep close links during the following two decades. Livingstone was ordained by some Scottish ministers under the presidency of Andrew Knox, bishop of Raphoe, and he became minister at Killinchy in co. Down. In May 1632 he was suspended for nonconformity by the bishop of Down, but according to his memoirs was restored in May 1634 on the intervention of the lord deputy, Viscount Wentworth. In November of the following year Livingstone was deposed again and subsequently excommunicated. He turned instead to America, leaving Ireland in September 1636 with a number of Scots and English presbyterians and independents, but this venture was soon forced to turn back because of severe weather in the Atlantic.<br>
<br>Livingstone often returned to Scotland during the 1630s, and in Edinburgh on 23 June 1635 he was married by his father to Janet (<i>d</i>. 1693), eldest daughter of Bartholomew Fleming, a merchant, and his wife, Marion Hamilton. Although necessity often meant they were separated in the years ahead, theirs seems to have remained a close marriage. They had eight sons and seven daughters, of whom three sons and four daughters survived childhood.<br>
<br>When the national covenant was signed in March 1638 Livingstone was sent to London with copies for friends at court. In July of that year he was inducted to the parish of Stranraer, where his preaching proved as popular as it had been in the 1620s. He was a member of the Glasgow general assembly of 1638, and of all subsequent assemblies until 1650 with the exception of 1640, when he travelled as the earl of Cassillis's regiment chaplain to Newcastle.<br>
<br>Livingstone participated most actively in national church affairs in the 1640s and 1650s. He and others who had been in Ireland formed the core of an extreme party, which demanded the abolition of some traditional forms of worship. In 1648 the general assembly sent him to try to dissuade Scottish troops in Ulster (where he had continued to officiate during summer months) from joining the army then being raised in support of the engagement. In August of that year he was translated to the parish of Ancrum, Roxburghshire.<br>
<br>Livingstone was one of the commissioners appointed by the church to treat with Charles II at Breda in 1650 and he received the king's oath of fidelity to the covenants before Charles was permitted to land in Scotland. Despite having performed this office, Livingstone soon afterwards joined the party who opposed the king's coronation. In October 1651 he was elected moderator of a meeting of protesters (who rejected the government's view that those who had taken part in the engagement might be allowed to serve in the army), but he withdrew from their discussions when he found he could not modify their extremist views. In 1654 Cromwell sent for Livingstone and two other protesters in an attempt to secure co-operation in introducing a new system for managing the Scottish church.<br>
<br>After the Restoration Livingstone was called before the privy council, on 11 December 1662, and on refusing to take the oath of allegiance was banished. In April 1663 he arrived in Rotterdam, and he spent the remainder of his life there, occasionally preaching in the Scottish church and devoting himself to theological study and correspondence with Dutch theologians. He also met other exiled presbyterian stalwarts, such as Robert McWard, John Brown, and Robert Traill. His wife and two of their younger children (one of whom died in Rotterdam) joined him in exile.<br>
<br>While in Rotterdam, Livingstone did not shirk involvement in religious disputes. In February 1670 the Quakers John Swinton and George Keith attempted to speak to a number of exiled ministers. Livingstone was the only one who would speak to them, though he refused to allow them to enter his house and denounced them for their lack of respect and &#145;blasphemous&#146; writings. He continued to exhort his former congregation in Ancrum to avoid contact with the Quakers in a letter written from Rotterdam in October 1671, and also dipped into the debate about indulgences. He was more humble than his fellow exiles McWard and Brown, however, admitting that &#145;None of us who are here, and seem to be dissatisfied with some things at Home, want conviction of our own grievous miscarriages&#146;  (Livingstone, <span class="italic">Letter</span>, 15&#150;16). Most of Livingstone's diverse writings&#151;including his autobiography, written in Rotterdam&#151;were gathered together and published by the Wodrow Society in 1845. A noted linguist, Livingstone worked on Latin biblical texts while in exile, but he never published them. He also assisted McWard and the Dutch theologian Matthias Nethenus with the publication of Samuel Rutherford's <span class="italic">Examen Arminianismi</span> in 1668.<br>
<br>Despite his continuing interest in theological debate, Livingstone was by this time clearly in poor health. He complained of gravel in the bladder from 1667 and it became so severe that he had to take a house nearer the church so that he could attend the services on Sundays. He died aged sixty-nine in Rotterdam on 9 August 1672 and was buried there five days later in the &#145;French Church&#146; (probably the chapel of St Sebastian, where the Scots worshipped). His wife went back to Edinburgh; and herself a strong supporter of the presbyterian cause, in 1674 presented with others a petition to the Scottish privy council asking that nonconforming ministers should have greater liberty to preach. She returned to Rotterdam in 1679 to live with their daughter Janet (<i>d</i>. 1696), who had married the notable Rotterdam merchant Andrew Russell, and died there in 1693. Most of her children went into the merchant trade, including William (1638&#150;1700), a merchant in Edinburgh who moved to Rotterdam in 1682 and was appointed clerk to the Edinburgh kirk sessions after the revolution of 1688, and Robert (1654&#150;1725), an American merchant who established the merchant dynasty of Livingston Manor, New York.<br>
<br>Livingstone was remembered by contemporaries as a gifted presbyterian preacher and theologian. Matthias Nethenus described him as &#145;most learned, most industrious and most zealous in the cause of God&#146;  (S. Rutherford, <span class="italic">Examen Arminianismi</span>, 1668, preface), and Robert McWard affectionately recalled his fellow exile as a &#145;burning and shining light, worthy and warme&#146;  (MS, Scot Church, Rotterdam).<br>
