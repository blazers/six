<span class="headword">&Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in,  Amhlaoibh</span> <span class="st"> [Humphrey O'Sullivan]</span>  (1783&#150;1838), <span class="occ">poet and diarist</span>, was born in Killarney, Kerry, Ireland, on 1 May 1783, the son of Donncha &Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in 
    (Denis O'Sullivan; 1738&#150;1808)
  , a hedge schoolmaster, and his wife, M&aacute;ire N&iacute; Bhuachalla 
    (Mary Buckley; 1748&#150;1827)
  , described in 1821 as a &#145;hugster&#146; (small shopkeeper). He had at least three brothers and two sisters, and the family left Killarney in 1789, moving first to Waterford and then in 1790 to Rogerstown, a crossroads outside Callan, co. Kilkenny, where his father erected a schoolhouse in a single day. They finally settled in Callan where Amhlaoibh spent the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Amhlaoibh &Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in owes his place in literature to <span class="italic">C&iacute;n Lae Amhlaoibh u&iacute; Sh&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in</span>, his Gaelic diary or <i>c&iacute;n lae</i> (it was edited by Michael McGrath and published in 1936&#150;7 in four volumes). Use of Gaelic for contemporary writing at that time was unusual, although not unknown. &Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in derived his proficiency in written Gaelic from his father who taught him. The diary covers the years 1827 to 1835, and began in English as &#145;observations on the weather, herbs, plants, trees etc.&#146;, but the language soon changed to Gaelic (although practical, financial, and administrative details are often given in English).<br>
<br>The original interest in nature was maintained, but the diary expanded into a significant record of the lives of those provincial middle-class Catholics who supported the campaigns of Daniel O'Connell and aspired to replace the ruling &eacute;lite of the established church as the dominant class in Irish society. A local leader of O'Connell's political campaigns, &Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in made a speech in Irish at a &#145;monster meeting&#146; in favour of Catholic emancipation in 1828. He also collected local contributions to the O'Connellite campaigns (the &#145;Catholic rent&#146;), and in 1828 led the Catholic side in an agitation to wrest the charitable Callan dispensary from protestant control.<br>
<br>The diary is equally valuable as a record of Gaelic intellectual life. &Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in's themes include popular pastimes, Irish and international politics, protestant extremism, the campaign against the payment of tithes to the established church, relief schemes for the poor, foreign wars, legal issues, local agrarian rebellions, medical matters, and traditional festivals. The extravagant meals enjoyed by the leading Catholics of Callan at the home of the parish priest are described in detail.<br>
<br>It is less forthcoming on the details of &Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in's personal life: a single sentence on 1 July 1829 records the death of his wife, M&aacute;ire N&iacute; Dhulachanta (Mary Delahunty). She probably came from the Kilkenny city area. The diary, however, makes occasional reference to his surviving children, Donncha (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1814), Anast&aacute;s (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1820), Amhlaoibh&iacute;n, and S&eacute;amas, as well as to three children who died. It describes in detail an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a second marriage (27&#150;9 December 1829), and also includes details of presumed paternity payments to a servant, Maraed Soinse&aacute;n, to whom a daughter M&aacute;ire was born on 10 July 1831.<br>
<br>&Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in maintained a school in Callan, with some breaks, until 1831 when its closure coincided with the establishment of a state system of education, but more particularly with the growth of his business as a &#145;linen draper&#146; and shopkeeper. He travelled regularly to wholesalers in Dublin, which allowed him to keep abreast of contemporary intellectual developments, in particular those associated with the Royal Irish Academy. He copied, compiled, and collected manuscripts, wrote stories and poems, and maintained contact with an extensive intellectual network, comprising scholars, artists, antiquarians, medical practitioners, and Catholic clergy. None of his work was printed in his lifetime; instead it forms part of the Gaelic manuscript tradition. &Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in died in 1838 and was buried at Kilbride, Callan, co. Kilkenny.<br>
