<span class="headword">Quin,  Edward</span>  (1794&#150;1828), <span class="occ">cartographer</span>, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22957/', "Edward Turnly Quin (1762&#150;1823)")</script>, a newspaper editor of Irish protestant descent, and his wife, Ann Delhoste, matriculated from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, on 26 November 1812, graduated BA in 1817, and proceeded MA in 1820. He was admitted to King's Inns on 13 June 1817 and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1823.<br>
<br>Quin practised as a barrister but is remembered chiefly for his <span class="italic">Atlas in a Series of Maps of the World as Known in Different Periods</span>, published posthumously in 1830. It consists of an unremarkable text by Quin and twenty-one maps, engraved by Sidney Hall. The maps begin with one of 2248 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>, &#145;The deluge&#146;, and end with one of 1828, &#145;At the general peace&#146; (after the Napoleonic era). The first map shows the garden of Eden sited in Mesopotamia, and occupies little more than a square inch, geographically isolated near the middle of the plate. It is surrounded by clouds that darken away from the small map to the four edges, making nine-tenths of the plate black. In each successive subsequent map the geographical area gradually extends and the clouds roll slowly back as knowledge of the world increases until at last they disappear. The maps are line-engraved on copper, but the clouds themselves are aquatint. The effect of both the individual maps and of the succession of maps is striking and dramatic, and credit for the innovation, widely attributed to the engraver Sidney Hall, lies in fact with Quin himself. An important technical attribute is Quin's use of the same scale for each map. His aim thereby was to represent the world as known in earlier periods but always in comparison with the world as known in his day. In the revealed portion of the world each empire was differently coloured so that:<blockquote>every successive map thus combines, at a single glance, both the Geography and History of the age to which it refers; exhibiting by its <i>extent</i> the boundaries of the known world and by its <i>colour</i> the respective empires into which that world was distributed. (preface)</blockquote>It is his artistic device of the clouds, however, which marks out the atlas. The critical reception of Quin's work was narrow but positive. Later commentators have noticed that his idea of the world's gradual revelation had a forerunner in two atlases by the Prussian Friedrich Benicken. There is no evidence that Quin knew of Benicken's atlas, though a German connection is possible, as his father is said in some sources to have served in the army in Germany. Whatever the origin of the idea, Quin's execution was far superior to Benicken's and the succession of maps is compelling, though the text plods. Quin has rather simplistically been accused of Eurocentrism  (Black), but Goffart points out that his clouds have no moral quality. They do not re-advance if an area is lost to civilization, for example in the dark ages that followed the fall of the Roman empire. <br>
<br>A second edition with Hall's plates was issued in 1836, and a third edition published in 1846 has plates by William Hughes. This edition contains the atlas only, without the text. Hughes redrew the maps on a hemispherical projection which somewhat undermines the dramatic effect. Fourth and fifth editions (1850 and 1856) also have Hughes's plates. The text was also published separately. Quin's work was copied by the American educator Emma Willard in her educational works but was not directly taken up by any British successor. <br>
<br>The atlas was Quin's only known cartographic work, and why a barrister should have produced such a striking work is unclear. Quin died, unmarried, at Hare Court, Inner Temple, London, on 4 May 1828.<br>
