<span class="headword">Mayor,  Flora Macdonald</span>  (1872&#150;1932), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 20 October 1872 at Queensgate House, Kingston Hill, Surrey, the youngest of the four children of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56421/', "Revd Joseph Bickersteth Mayor (1828&#150;1916)")</script>, professor of classics and later of moral philosophy at King's College, London, and his wife, Alexandrina Jessie (1831&#150;1927), daughter of Andrew Grote of the Indian Civil Service and his wife, Isabella. Flora's mother was a remarkable linguist, and Flora is said to have spoken thirteen languages. The family was comfortably off: like her character Henrietta Symons, Flora &#145;was always cursed with her tidy little income&#146;. Flora was educated with her identical twin Alice at Surbiton high school and in Switzerland, then read history at Newnham College, Cambridge (1892&#150;6). A lively girl, she threw herself so fervently into Cambridge pleasures that despite earlier academic achievement at school, she got only a third. For the next seven years she thrashed about in search of an occupation. Despite having asthma, and to the horror of her family who wanted her to be a &#145;daughter at home&#146;, she attempted to become an actress. Her experiences in the theatre were unpleasant and degrading, and she got only tiny parts. She also published a novel, <span class="italic">Mrs Hammond's Children</span> (1901), under her stage name of Mary Strafford.<br>
<br>In March 1903 Flora became engaged to an old friend, Ernest Shepherd (1871/2&#150;1903), but they had only a few weeks together. Ernest had accepted a job with the architectural survey of India so that he could afford to marry, and Flora allowed him to go there ahead of her. He died of fever at Simla on 22 October 1903, aged thirty-one. The shock made her a semi-invalid for years. Flora wrote that up to then, &#145;I instinctively put happiness as what I was aiming for and expecting as my right in life. Since then I have also quite instinctively given up expecting it&#146;  (Oldfield, 136). Outwardly the second half of her life appeared a long sad postscript to the adventurous years. She never again attempted to leave her family, living at various times with her brothers in London, or Bristol, or with her elderly parents at Kingston Hill. Inwardly she was preparing to write two great novels about the buried, intense emotions of spinsters like herself.<br>
<br>About one in four women never married, and there was much discussion before 1914 about what society should do with them. Flora's contribution to this debate was <span class="italic">The Third Miss Symons</span> (1913), a novel about an unloved and useless woman. It carried a preface by John Masefield, and narrowly missed winning the Polignac prize. The war years were spent unhappily keeping house for her brother Henry, a master at Clifton College. She then began work on her masterpiece, <span class="italic">The Rector's Daughter</span> (1924). This is a longer and more complex novel, concentrating on the inner life of a middle-aged spinster, Mary Jocelyn, her unconsummated love for a married clergyman, and her lonely death. With such unfashionable subject matter she had difficulty finding a publisher, until Leonard Woolf and Virginia Woolf offered to take it on a commission basis for the Hogarth Press. It was modestly successful and won praise from Masefield, E. M. Forster, and Rebecca West, but Flora Mayor was never recognized as an important novelist.<br>
<br>Afterwards Flora's health and powers declined. Her mother died in 1927 and she moved with Alice to Hampstead. She wrote some supernatural and other stories and an inferior novel, <span class="italic">The Squire's Daughter</span> (1929), which laments the decay of post-war England. She died at her home at 7 East Heath Road, Hampstead, on 28 January 1932 of pneumonia complicated by influenza, and is buried in Hampstead cemetery. A collection of stories, <span class="italic">The Room Opposite</span>, appeared posthumously in 1935.<br>
<br>Flora Mayor was undervalued during her life and for many years after her death because she appeared to have been born out of her time. She belonged in the tradition of Jane Austen, Charlotte Bront&euml;, and Mrs Gaskell&#151;her work was described by Sylvia Lynd as &#145;a bitter <span class="italic">Cranford</span>&#146;  (Oldfield, 241)&#151;but unlike them, she did not allow her spinsters to achieve happiness, and was a woman of the early twentieth century, very much aware of feminism, agnosticism, and the lifestyle of Bloomsbury. Her novels are valuable as the only serious, full-length studies of a vast group of despised and rejected women, English spinsters. Celibacy, damaged family relationships, and the tension between modernism and tradition are the materials from which she built two extraordinary books. <span class="italic">The Rector's Daughter</span> was reprinted in 1973, <span class="italic">The Third Miss Symons</span> in 1980.<br>
