<span class="headword">Shaw,  Thomas</span>  (1694&#150;1751), <span class="occ">traveller</span>, son of Gabriel Shaw, shearman-dyer of Kendal, Westmorland, and his wife, who was probably called Agnes, was born on 4 June 1694 at Kendal and baptized there on 18 June. Having attended Kendal grammar school, he matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford, on 5 December 1711, graduating BA in 1716 and MA on 16 January 1720. Later that year he was appointed chaplain to the English factory at Algiers at a salary of &pound;100 per annum. During his time there he travelled widely, to Egypt, Sinai, Cyprus, and the Holy Land in 1721&#150;2 and to Tunis and Carthage in 1727, as well as making various excursions into the interior of Barbary (Algiers, Tripoli, and Morocco). In Barbary travel was comparatively safe, but in &#145;Aqabah he was stripped naked by robbers, and while travelling with 6000 pilgrims to Jerusalem he was seized and held to ransom. However, with &#145;a body capable of bearing the fatigues of travelling united to a mind rich in most kinds of human learning&#146;  (<span class="italic">European Magazine</span>, 19, 1791, 83), in all these regions he made careful observations of the geography, natural history, customs, and antiquities. In 1733, having married Joanna, the widow of his friend and benefactor, Edward Holden, consul at Algiers, Shaw returned to England. Elected a fellow of Queen's in 1727, he became doctor of divinity in 1734 and was presented to the vicarage of Godshill, Isle of Wight. He was also elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 13 June 1734, having contributed to their <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> of 1729, through Sir Hans Sloane, with &#145;A geographical description of the kingdom of Tunis&#146;.<br>
<br>Four years later Shaw published <span class="italic">Travels, or, Observations Relating to Several Parts of Barbary and the Levant</span> (1738), which included maps, plates, lists of animals, plants (about 640 species), fossils, coins, and inscriptions, and a copious index. He had engaged the botanist Johann Jakob Dillenius to catalogue his flora. Dedicated to George II, the book also acknowledged the generous patronage of Queen Caroline. The bibliophile Thomas Dibdin called the work &#145;a safe inmate&#146; of a well-chosen collection and exhorted &#145;Fly, fly, to secure it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Library Companion</span>, 1824, 2.48). It was especially admired for the illustrations of natural history, of classical authors, and of the scriptures. Gibbon honourably excepts him from the crowd of &#145;blind&#146; travellers  (E. Gibbon, <span class="italic">The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</span>, chap. 24), while his scrupulous veracity was vindicated by James Bruce and later African explorers.<br>
<br>Academic acrimony, however, arose when Richard Pococke, in his <span class="italic">Description of the East</span> (2 vols., 1743&#150;5) took issue with Shaw on some, mainly geographical, statements. From his observations in Egypt, Shaw theorized that originally the delta of the Nile was part of the sea, while to the south was a valley bounded by mountains. Gradually over the centuries the soil brought down by the inundations had built up the banks until, while the delta became cultivable, the land to the far south was raised too high to be flooded, causing it to become barren. Pococke disagreed  (1.39), believing the channel of the Nile was always augmented in proportion to its banks, and therefore nothing changed. Shaw's explanation is interesting in that it is based on firsthand observation and in that it admits of the possibility of landscape change through the operation in the past of presently observed processes. Elsewhere in his work, however, with references to &#145;the deluge&#146;, Shaw shows his adherence to traditional views of the earth's history.<br>
<br>Wounded over the Nile disagreement by being &#145;in so unexpected a Manner &hellip; drawn into a Controversy&#146;  (Shaw, 15) by a man he considered a friend, Shaw issued a supplement to his <span class="italic">Travels</span> in 1746, &#145;wherein some objections lately made are fully considered and answered&#146;, and in 1747 <span class="italic">A Further Vindication in a Letter to R. Clayton, Bishop of Clogher</span>. Both supplements were incorporated into the second and most valued edition of Shaw's <span class="italic">Travels</span> (1757), which, although published after his death, had been prepared by himself. A third edition, in two volumes, was published in 1808. The work was translated into German, Dutch, and French.<br>
<br>When on 18 August 1740 Shaw became principal of St Edmund Hall, Oxford, he found &#145;every Part of it in Ruins, and without an Inhabitant&#146; and immediately set about repairs. He restored the eastern end of the north range of the front quadrangle in 1741, paying for this with &#145;the whole Profits I received from my Book of Travels&#146;, about &pound;400  (Shaw to Robert Tomlinson, letter 3d; Cowdrey, 58). Through a fund-raising appeal, he was able to restore the western half of the range in 1746&#150;7.<br>
<br>Shaw was appointed regius professor of Greek in 1741 and presented by Queen's College to the vicarage of Bramley, Hampshire, in 1742. He died there on 15 August 1751 &#145;in high reputation for knowledge, probity, and pleasantry&#146;  (Nicholson, 429). He was buried at Bramley in September, where a memorial monument was erected in the church by his widow; a commemorative tablet was also placed in the English church at Algiers. He left to the university the manuscripts of his travels, with other papers, his collection of natural curiosities, and some antique coins and busts, three of which were engraved in <span class="italic">Marmoria Oxoniensa</span>. Forster named a botanical species <i>Shawia</i> in his honour. Portraits of him at St Edmund Hall and Queen's College show &#145;a stout and fierce, but not ill-tempered looking man&#146;  (note from Provost Magrath, <span class="italic">DNB</span>) with a countenance &#145;grotesque, but marked most strongly with jocularity and good humour&#146;. An etching from a portrait then belonging to Sir William Musgrave, bt, prefixes an article in the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> which bears the appearance of authorship by someone who knew him. He was, it says:<blockquote>Good, humane, temperate, sociable and cheerful to the highest degree, as long as any of his contemporaries exist, the infinite humor of his conversation will never be forgotten; which was heightened by a peculiarity of figure and countenance &hellip; his humor was chiefly exerted in the innocent conviviality of the Common Room, where his wit was provoked and sharpened by the raillery of his surrounding friends. (19, Feb 1791, 85)</blockquote>
