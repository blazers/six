<span class="headword">Story,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1681), <span class="occ">Quaker schismatic</span>, was &#145;descended of Christian parents&#146; of Preston Patrick, Westmorland, where they &#145;lived honestly, (having land, goods and trade) in good repute&#146;. He received a good education and &#145;was never seen inclinable to any evil vice, but against all such things from his youth&#146;. At the age of twelve he began to wonder &#145;where to find a place and people that sought the Lord&#146;, finding the answer when he met and joined with Gervase Benson, Francis Howgill, Edward Burough, and John Audland  (Wilkinson, 4). At the age of fourteen he preached in the &#145;public assemblies&#146; in Westmorland and the surrounding area. George Fox recorded in his journal entry for 1652 that he had met Story at Crosslands near Preston Patrick and &#145;looked upon him to be a forward bold lad&#146; who had &#145;a flashy empty notion of religion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of George Fox</span>, 1.44). Upon his conversion to Quakerism, Story was apparently &#145;struck silent for the space of a whole year&#146;, feeling himself unfit to preach  (Wilkinson, 5).<br>
<br>About 1654 Story joined <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69144/', "John Wilkinson")</script> to spread the Quaker message and the two became travelling companions for a period of three years. In 1654 they wrote to George Fox from Cinderhill Green about their meetings in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, and a further letter reveals they had &#145;drawings&#146; towards Cumberland and Durham. In 1655 they were in Wiltshire which became the centre of their early work and where many Baptists received the Quaker message. The same year saw them imprisoned in Gloucester gaol. Other letters reveal they spent time in Bristol, while in 1660 Story suffered in Salisbury gaol for a year under the sentence of <i>praemunire</i>, but was released at the king's coronation.<br>
<br>Story appears to have initially been highly thought of among Quakers for he was described as &#145;being well read in holy scriptuer, and had a large undrstanding &amp; Memory and a grave Carriage, by which he was more Qualified for the service&#146;. In these early years he was viewed as &#145;very servisable, Espechally in the defence of truth against opposers thereof, in sevrall disputes&#146;  (Penney, 256). Indeed Wilkinson noted that Story's efforts contributed to his weak health for he suffered from &#145;great colds, after much heat in meetings impaired his health, besides his concern with many opposers in the breaking forth of truth&#146;  (Wilkinson, 6). Story wrote two defences of Quakerism: the first <span class="italic">Babylon's Defence Broken Down</span> (1660), an answer to William Brownsford's <span class="italic">The Quaker Jesuit</span>, defended the movement against the charge of popery; the second, <span class="italic">A Short Discovery of Certain Truths of God</span> (1664), was a response to John Batchiler's anti-Quaker tract, <span class="italic">Christian Queries to Quaking Christians</span>, and upheld Quaker beliefs about the inner light, the role of scripture, oaths, and social deference. Story's early importance can also be seen from his invitation to a special meeting of Quaker ministers in London in May 1666 called to deal with the problems caused by John Perrot and followers regarding the issue of authority within the movement.<br>
<br>In the early 1670s Story began to be critical of mainstream Quakerism and gradually led a group of dissatisfied Westmorland Quakers centred around Preston Patrick into a separation, first in their business meetings and then in worship. According to the mainstream Quaker movement, Story had &#145;[grown] proud of his gifts, and exalted in his spirit&#146; with the result that &#145;he Grew to be Contentious, Espechally against good ordr and govrmt in the Church&#146;  (Penney, 256). Initially the Preston Patrick Quakers had, in response to the second <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span> of 1670, met in woods and other places rather than openly in Friends' houses, a decision which had incurred the disapproval of their Quaker meeting. Their activities developed into a general attack on authority, organization, and leadership within the movement, particularly George Fox's setting up of separate women's meetings (except for those in large towns and cities, where it was thought more appropriate) and the consequent submission of marriages before the women's meetings as well as those of the men. Further issues concerned the practice of recording papers of condemnation against errant Quakers, and the insistence that tithe testimonies be upheld even if Friends did not feel moved to do so. Some insight into Story's own beliefs is given by the Quaker Elizabeth Stirredge who described how he had upset two Wiltshire women Friends by &#145;bidding them go home about their business, and wash their dishes, and not go about to preach &hellip; and sent them crying home&#146;  (Stirredge, 73). She also related how he advised Friends to meet together privately for worship to avoid disturbance, and if necessary to alter the time and place of their worship. No doubt referring to these very issues, Wilkinson, who had joined his former companion at the end of 1672, wrote that &#145;because he [Story] could not receive some prescriptions of men's, with all its formalities, therefore was he proceeded against &hellip; as one of a wrong spirit, and out of the unity&#146;  (Wilkinson, 6). He noted however that Story &#145;rendered not evil for evil, by opposing his opposers in meetings for public worship&#146;  (ibid., 7).<br>
<br>In January 1675, supported by Thomas and Ann Curtis of Reading, Story and Wilkinson met George Fox at Worcester Castle. Thomas Lower who accompanied Fox at the meeting, wrote that the two men were well-apparelled, Story wearing &#145;his extraordinary broad-brimmed beaver hat and his periwig and broad belt with silver buckles and great hose&#146;. Lower also noted Story's popularity, adding that he &#145;hath great obeisance rendered to him in the country where he comes by those that know him not&#146;  (Braithwaite, <span class="italic">Second Period</span>, 297).<br>
<br>However, no agreement could be reached and shortly afterwards Wilkinson and Story set up a separate business meeting, confirming an open separation from the rest of the movement. The 1675 yearly meeting issued a condemnation against Story and Wilkinson, and they were asked by Westmorland Friends to attend two further meetings, both of which they refused&#151;the first because the charges had not been put in writing, and the second because they did not feel adequately represented. While in Bristol with William Rogers, who later wrote <span class="italic">The Christian Quaker</span> (1680) in their defence, Story and Wilkinson were asked to attend a meeting at Draw-well in April 1676 with leading Quakers such as George Whitehead in order to try and heal the breach. During this encounter the two maintained their reasons for separation, although they admitted some fault in opposing Friends &#145;in the practice of those things that they testify are commendable in the Church of God&#146;  (ibid., 306). The two then visited George Fox at Swarthmoor but a lasting reconciliation failed to emerge because of their resentment at mainstream Friends' version of events at Draw-well and the portrayal of the pair's admissions as tantamount to a condemnation against themselves. Following this, Story travelled south to garner more support. After the 1677 yearly meeting a paper was issued which strongly condemned the so-called Wilkinson&#150;Story separation and had the effect of galvanizing the Westmorland quarterly meeting into removing meetings for worship from the homes of separatist Friends: the breach was now complete.<br>
<br>In 1678 Story was present at a meeting attended by Fox in Bristol, concerning separatists in that city (chiefly William Rogers) and others from Wiltshire. He appears to have kept travelling in the west and south towards the end of his life for Wilkinson noted that in the years after 1676 that &#145;God gave him strength, and carried him hundreds of miles in his service; afterwards he was very weak&#146;  (Wilkinson, 8). In 1679 he went to London where the second-day morning meeting acquired confirmation from him of the paper of regret drawn up at Draw-well, an act that was interpreted as a move on Story's part towards reconciliation. Story's final meeting was at Kendal on 16 October 1681 and was attended by Thomas Camm, who later criticized Story's testimony and behaviour at the meeting.<br>
<br>According to <span class="italic">Antichristian Treachery Discovered</span> (1683), Story died some weeks after the Kendal meeting (his death having been prophesied by the Quaker Solomon Eccles a few years earlier, much to the embarrassment of Friends). He fell ill about a week after the meeting, and he died about 24 November 1681 apparently from distemper; he was said to have been aged between forty and fifty. While his critics inevitably viewed him as &#145;a man that caused strife, division and discord in his later years&#146;  (Camm, 2), Wilkinson in his personal testimony to him in <span class="italic">The Memory of that Servant of God, John Story, Revived</span> believed that &#145;he fulfilled a great time, if wisdom be grey-hair, and undefiled life, old age&#146;  (Wilkinson, 8).<br>
