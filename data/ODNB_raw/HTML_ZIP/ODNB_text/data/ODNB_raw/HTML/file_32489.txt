<span class="headword">Coleridge,  Bernard John Seymour</span>, second Baron Coleridge  (1851&#150;1927), <span class="occ">judge</span>, of the distinguished Devon family, was born at the family seat at Ottery St Mary, Devon, on 19 August 1851, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5886/', "John Duke (afterwards first Baron) Coleridge (1820&#150;1894)")</script>, lord chief justice of England, grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5887/', "Sir John Taylor Coleridge")</script>, judge, and great-grandnephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5888/', "Samuel Taylor Coleridge")</script>, the poet and philosopher. His mother was Jane Fortescue, daughter of the Revd George Turner Seymour, of Farringford, Isle of Wight. Coleridge was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1875 with a second class in history and was captain of the college boat club. He was made an honorary fellow of Trinity in 1909. In 1876 Coleridge married Mary Alethea, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17547/', "John Fielder Mackarness")</script>, bishop of Oxford; they had one son, Geoffrey Duke (1877&#150;1955), who succeeded his father as third baron, and two daughters.<br>
<br>Coleridge read in chambers with the well-known special pleader, Baugh Allen, and was called to the bar in 1877 by the Middle Temple, of which he was bencher in 1894 and treasurer in 1919. He joined the western circuit where he acquired a large local practice, mainly in criminal cases. He was counsel for the defence in the Winford (1883) and Newton St Cyres (1888) murder cases. He shared his father's Liberal political outlook and was elected member of parliament for the Attercliffe division of Sheffield in 1885, holding the seat as a Gladstonian Liberal for nine years. In 1892 he became queen's counsel.<br>
<br>Coleridge succeeded to the peerage in 1894 but continued to practise at the bar, the first peer of the realm to pursue a regular forensic career. He also spoke in debates in the House of Lords: he strongly attacked Lord Milner's colonial policy and the employment of Chinese indentured labour in the Transvaal, and he supported the <span class="roman">Trades Disputes Bill</span> of 1906. The Liberal landslide at the general election of 1906 gave him the opportunity for early promotion, and in 1907 Lord Loreburn appointed him a High Court judge in the King's Bench Division. The Coleridge family was the first to see father, son, and grandson successively appointed judge.<br>
<br>Coleridge was neither a brilliant nor an erudite judge, but he had bearing, was careful and fair-minded, and his decisions were seldom reversed on appeal. He was at his best in jury cases, both civil and criminal. The prosecution of the famous murderer J. A. Dickman at Newcastle upon Tyne assizes in 1910 was one of his more famous cases (a full report of the proceedings, edited by S. O. Rowan-Hamilton, was published in 1914). Coleridge also presided at the trials of the suffragettes, Mrs Emmeline Pankhurst in 1912 and the Pethick-Lawrences in 1913. In 1917 he and the archbishop of Canterbury together heard the first appeal under the <span class="roman">Benefices Act</span> of 1898 (<i>Rice v. Bishop of Oxford</i>).<br>
<br>Coleridge had many outside interests. He was chairman of Devon quarter sessions and served regularly even while he was a judge. From 1912 to 1918 he was chairman of the coal conciliation board of the federated districts. He was a zealous humanitarian, a strong anti-vivisectionist, and an opponent of flogging, although he favoured retention of the death sentence for the most serious crimes. He was founder and first president of the Old Ottregian Society (so called after his family home at Ottery St Mary) and wrote &#145;The Ottery Song&#146;, which was sung at its gatherings. He also published <span class="italic">Ottery St Mary and its Memories</span> (1904), <span class="italic">The Story of a Devonshire House</span> (1905), and <span class="italic">This for Remembrance</span> (1925).<br>
<br>Coleridge retired from the bench because of illness in 1923. He lived out his retirement at his Devon home, the Chanter's House, Ottery St Mary, where he died on 4 September 1927.<br>
