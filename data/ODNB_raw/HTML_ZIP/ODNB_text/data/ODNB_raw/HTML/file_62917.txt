<span class="headword">Roberts,  Thomas</span>  (1765/6&#150;1841), <span class="occ">author</span>, was baptized at Llwyn'rhudol Uchaf in the parish of Aber-erch, near Pwllheli, Caernarvonshire, on 16 August 1767, the son of William Roberts (<i>d</i>. 1777/8), a lawyer, and Jane, his wife.<br>
<br>Thomas Roberts was well educated, but it is not known where, and the details of his youth are also unclear. He went to London before he was fourteen, and he may have practised as a lawyer. In 1791 Roberts married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1829), from a prosperous Warwickshire Quaker family, and through his wife's connections he was able to become a London goldsmith. By the time of the birth of their first child, Hannah, in October 1791, they were members of the Devonshire House meeting of the Society of Friends. They had five daughters and a son, Maurice, and lived successively in or near the City of London, at Aldgate, Clerkenwell, and Poultry. Roberts went to Jersey on business in 1820 and paid a cultural visit to Brittany at the expense of the treasurer of the Welsh School, London. The following year he visited Ghent, on business, where he stayed until the beginning of 1823. Mary Roberts died in March 1829 and was buried on 5 April in Bunhill Fields.<br>
<br>Wales continued to feature in Roberts's life: he and his family paid frequent visits there; he brought up his children to speak Welsh (his son showed promise as a writer of Welsh); and he corresponded with men of letters in Wales. A collector of folk-verse, he particularly admired <i>penillion telyn</i> (verses for the harp).<br>
<br>As an active member of London-Welsh society he held, at one time or another, all the major offices of the Gwyneddigion Society. It is probable that he, along with others, was instrumental in setting up a branch of the Gwyneddigion, the Cymreigyddion, in 1794. This was a Welsh-language debating society which touched upon the controversial issues of radical London politics at a time of insecurity and censorship. One of the characteristics of the London Welsh societies was their boisterous <i>bonhomie</i> and Thomas Roberts, although a Quaker, made a lively contribution. An attempt in 1840 to prohibit smoking at meetings (as a degrading habit) was defeated by Thomas Roberts's casting vote: he argued that the object of the Cymreigyddion was the maintenance of the Welsh way of life (which evidently included smoking).<br>
<br>Roberts wrote in both English and Welsh. His best-known work in Welsh, <span class="italic">Cwyn yn erbyn gorthrymder</span> (1798), was a satirical and radical piece which attacked various forms of oppression in Wales, chiefly the tithe of the established church, but also Methodists, doctors, lawyers, and the deference of the peasantry. His radicalism was associated with his dissent. Although Thomas Roberts was not a supporter of the Methodists, he spoke in their defence. He wrote under the pseudonym Arvonius against the libellous anti-Methodism of a fellow London-Welshman, the Anglican Edward Charles. His defence was inspired by a Quaker dislike of the established church and a radical distaste for &#145;old corruption&#146;.<br>
<br>Roberts's English works mediated between the cultures of England and Wales. He published an <span class="italic">English and Welsh Vocabulary</span> (1827) and a pocket book of Welsh phrases with their English equivalents. <span class="italic">The Welsh Interpreter</span> (1831) was designed, according to its subtitle, to help English tourists &#145;make themselves understood by the peasantry during their rambles through Wales&#146;. He was equally concerned to ensure that the Welsh benefited from works of self-help previously available in English, and therefore published a Welsh version of Benjamin Franklin's <span class="italic">Poor Richard</span> in 1839. He also published Welsh versions of English devotional material. Towards the end of his life, Roberts lost much of his wealth (owing, so it was said, to the loss at sea of a shipload of bullion) and lived latterly on a pension from the Goldsmiths' Company. He died on 24 May 1841 at 7 Bond Street, London, the home of his sole surviving daughter, Keturah. He was buried on 30 May with his wife in Bunhill Fields.<br>
