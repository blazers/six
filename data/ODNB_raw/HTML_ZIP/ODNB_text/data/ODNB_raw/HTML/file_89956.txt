<span class="headword">Baines, Sir  George  Grenfell-</span>  (1908&#150;2003), <span class="occ">architect and town planner</span>, was born George Grenfell Baines on 30 April 1908 at 11 Cecilia Street, Preston, the elder son (there were no daughters) of Ernest Charles Baines (1882&#150;1950), railway clerk, and his wife, Sarah Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Grenfell (1885&#150;1979), from a family of Methodist lay preachers. He was educated at Roebuck Street council school but left at fourteen to become a junior clerk to the Preston and district rating surveyor. His drawing ability was quickly recognized, and his boss suggested that he become an architect. However, it was three years before he secured a draftsman's position in the Lancashire county architect's department and began studying architecture at the Harris Institute, Preston.<br>
<br>In 1930 Baines joined the firm of Bradshaw Gass and Hope in Bolton, specialists in winning competitions for town halls and commercial buildings. Unusually, the practice employed its own engineers and quantity surveyors but, already experienced in the importance of involving all the professions at an early stage in a building's design, Baines regretted that they were seen as subservient to the architects. He enrolled at the Manchester College of Technology, and when his teachers declared they had no more to teach him, he secured a scholarship to Manchester University. There he was introduced to modern architecture, admiring the multi-disciplinary Bauhaus school, Le Corbusier, and the group-working methods adopted by the young Tecton practice in London.<br>
<br>For his RIBA diploma Baines persuaded the university to accept a competition project for a new parliament building in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia. When he came third, with a prize of &pound;250, he was able to set up his own practice. His first office was his parents' living room, before he found accommodation with George Henry Broadbent, pooling skills and sharing a secretary. Baines designed bungalows for local builders and a hotel conversion, and with the build-up to war he was approached in 1938 by English Electric to convert premises in Preston, Sheffield, and elsewhere into armament factories. During the Second World War he remained a civilian, being in a reserved occupation. He designed runways, hangars, aircraft factories, and armaments factories for English Electric and other companies, and his practice expanded rapidly. Baines and Broadbent were joined by another architect, Harry Walters, and in 1941 they formed the Grenfell Baines Group with the architects John Ashworth and Tom Mellor. The first quantity surveyor partner was recruited in 1942, followed in 1949 by a structural engineer. In accordance with Baines's socialist beliefs, all the partners and staff took a share of the profits on a points system, as Baines explained in a lecture to the RIBA in 1944. Baines completed his town planning qualifications at Manchester in 1944, and became consultant to the new towns of Newton Aycliffe (1948) and Peterlee, where he succeeded Berthold Lubetkin in 1951. By then Baines had a family, having on 28 March 1939 married Dorothy Hodson (<i>b</i>. 1916), shop assistant, and daughter of William Stuart Hodson, engineer; they had two daughters.<br>
<br>The Grenfell Baines Group dissolved into five practices in 1950, Grenfell Baines (as by now he was known) forming a partnership with Thomas Hargreaves, a friend from student days. This practice also expanded rapidly, opening offices in Blackpool, Manchester, Derby, and London by 1959. Grenfell Baines and Hargreaves built extensively in the north-west, but were best known for the power and production pavilion at the Festival of Britain in 1951, developed from an idea by the disabled architect H. J. Reifenberg. Grenfell Baines's first marriage was dissolved in 1952 and on 24 April 1954 he married Milena Ruth Fleischmann (<i>b</i>. 1929), a Czech refugee, daughter of Rudolf Fleischmann, merchant; they had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>In April 1961 Grenfell Baines formed the Building Design Partnership (BDP), the first of many multi-disciplinary practices founded in the 1960s. The practice was highly successful at winning commissions for both public sector projects (such as hospitals) and industrial work. By the time of Baines's retirement in 1974 BDP had fourteen architect partners, six quantity surveyors, and eight mechanical, two electrical, and eight structural engineers, with 723 staff and seven offices. When in 1984 as non-executive chairman he visited all the offices, he encouraged still stronger communications between them and between disciplines. He was also interested in architectural education. In 1966 he suggested to the RIBA that BDP and a school of architecture should together open an office where students could get real practical experience. He revived the idea when in 1972 he was asked to suggest a new professor of architecture at Sheffield. Grenfell Baines was persuaded to take the job himself, and founded a new practice with young architects and students. After a promising start it foundered in the recession of 1979&#150;80 and was taken over by BDP.<br>
<br>Grenfell Baines was appointed OBE in 1960 and knighted in 1978; after this time he used the form Grenfell-Baines, but without complete consistency. The Salisbury competition may have been the high point of his career as a designer. Thereafter he put his exceptional talents for management and organization to the fore, and transformed the way large commercial practices operated. But he retained a deep concern for humanity and the way buildings were used, and for egalitarianism and profit sharing within his practices. For relaxation he loved dance music and fast cars, and in 1953 he competed in the RAC rally. In old age he remained trim and dapper, and attributed his longevity to his belief in holistic healthy eating and complementary medicine. He died on 9 May 2003 at his home, 60 West Cliff, Preston, of a chest infection. He was survived by his second wife, Milena, and his four children.<br>
