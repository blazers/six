<span class="headword">Oram,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1777), <span class="occ">painter and architect</span>, was educated as an architect, and, through the patronage of Sir Edward Walpole, obtained the position in 1748 of master carpenter in the office of works, a post he held until his death. He designed a triumphal arch in Westminster Hall for the coronation of George III, of which he published an engraving by Anthony Walker. His posthumously published <span class="italic">Precepts and Observations on the Art of Colouring in Landscape-Painting</span> (1810) records only one building designed by Oram, a house in Lancashire. Walpole noted that he &#145;was bred an architect, but taking to landscape painting arrived at great merit in that branch&#146;  (cited in Colvin, <span class="italic">Archs</span>., 716). He painted in the style of Gaspar Poussin and also of John Wootton, under whom he may have studied. His works were often applied to decorative purposes and inserted over doors and mantelpieces. He designed and painted the staircase at Buckingham House, and was employed to repair the paintings on the staircase at Hampton Court. He published an etching of Datchet Bridge in 1745. In the same year he proposed a similar set of eight views in Yorkshire and Derbyshire, one of which, <span class="italic">Knaresborough</span>, engraved by Edward Rooker, was published by Oram in 1745  (Clayton, 159, plate 174). Clayton records that in advertising his views Oram had taken great pains:<blockquote>in the Choice of Prospects as well as in the Points of View, in order to render them the most Picturesque that have hitherto appeared: the whole not considered with Respect only to any one Object, as a Town, Bridge or River; but to such only as would make beautiful Pictures. (<span class="italic">General Advertiser</span>, 19 March 1745, 12 Aug 1745)</blockquote>&#145;Thus&#146;, Clayton observes, &#145;fifteen years before Gilpin first examined &#147;the face of the country by the rules of picturesque beauty&#148;, Oram was explaining the rules of picturesque composition to subscribers&#146;  (Clayton, 158).<br>
<br>In 1765 Oram was elected a member of the Florentine Academy. In 1766 he exhibited three landscapes at the Society of Artists exhibition. Oram, who was generally known as Old Oram, to distinguish him from his son, had died by 17 March 1777, leaving a widow and a son, <a href="#cosubject_20802">Edward Oram [<i>see below</i>]</a>. In his will, dated 4 January 1776, and proved on 17 March 1777, Oram describes himself as of St John's, Hampstead, and leaves everything to his wife, Elizabeth. His widow gave Oram's manuscripts to his near relative, Charles Clarke FSA, subsequently published as <span class="italic">Precepts and Observations on the Art of Colouring in Landscape-Painting</span>.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_20802"></a><span class="headword">Edward Oram</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1799), son of the above, also practised as a <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>. He exhibited landscapes at the Royal Academy from 1775 to 1790, and again in 1798 and 1799. He was also engaged in scene-painting as assistant to Philip James de Loutherbourgh, and painted scenery for the Royalty Theatre in Wellclose Square. He was one of the artists patronized, like John Flaxman and William Blake, by the Revd Henry and Mrs Mathew, and he assisted Flaxman in decorating their house in Rathbone Place, London. In 1799 Oram was residing in Gresse Street, Rathbone Place. All later trace of him is lost.<br>
