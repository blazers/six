<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Snagge,  John Derrick Mordaunt</span>  (1904&#150;1996), <span class="occ">radio broadcaster</span>, was born at 72 Burton Court, Chelsea, London, on 8 May 1904, the second of three sons of Sir (Thomas) Mordaunt Snagge (1868&#150;1955), barrister, and later county court judge, and his wife, Gwendaline Rose Emily, younger daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32510/', "Sir John Charles Ready Colomb")</script>, of Dromquinna, co. Kerry, Ireland, one of the founders of the Imperial Federation League. His paternal grandfather was Judge Sir Thomas William Snagge. After an undistinguished education at Winchester College and Pembroke College, Oxford (where he rowed for his college, but did not gain a blue), he started work in 1924 as assistant director of the BBC's relay station in Stoke-on-Trent. He made the tea, announced, was an Uncle in <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span>, organized programmes, wrote scripts, and sang duets on the air with the engineer-in-charge. In 1928 he became an announcer at the Savoy Hill headquarters of the BBC. With a robust manner and a clear, authoritative voice&#151;a voice that gradually mellowed into polished mahogany&#151;he was a natural choice as an announcer in an era when it was taken sufficiently seriously for those who practised it to wear dinner jackets for the evening bulletins. He also showed a growing aptitude for outside broadcasts, then in their infancy.<br>
<br>Professionally competent and knowledgeable about rowing, Snagge was regarded as the obvious candidate to take over the Oxford&#150;Cambridge boat race when Gerald Cock, the BBC's first director of outside broadcasts, decided in 1931 that it needed fresh blood. Cock said in a private letter that recent commentaries had been &#145;rotten&#146;&#151;they had neglected to tell listeners who was leading, or what the winning margin was&#151;and that &#145;violent efforts&#146; were needed to improve matters  (Cock to Charles M. Pitman, 10 Nov 1930, BBC WAC, R30/138). Snagge was put on board the motor yacht <i>Magician</i>, following the progress of the crews from Putney to Mortlake, and provided a live running commentary. He was deemed to have been a success and continued to be hired every year (except 1940&#150;45, when the boat race was not held) until he bowed out in 1980. The race was televised from 1938, though it was still Snagge's commentary that was used. Some felt he spoke too quickly and chanted the strokes (&#145;in-out, in-out, in-out&#146;) too much. In the intensely exciting 1949 race, when Cambridge won by a few feet, he genuinely did not know and could not see who was ahead because his BBC launch, badly piloted, slid broadside-on into the wash of another launch. His on-air comment, &#145;I don't know who's ahead&#151;it's either Oxford or Cambridge&#146;  (<span class="italic">75 Years of the BBC</span>, CD2, track 4) was subsequently acclaimed as a classic of its genre. There were other dramas, too: in 1948 the press and BBC launches collided and several people fell into the Thames, and in a snowstorm in 1952 the BBC boat ran out of petrol and narrowly avoided being rammed by pursuing vessels.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Snagge was the BBC's presentation director, running an area that embraced continuity and newsreading and which he aptly described as the shop window of the BBC. He also read many (though by no means all) memorable bulletins. It was Snagge who told the nation about the invasion of north Africa, the fall of Rome, Arnhem, the D-day landings in 1944 (in which year he was appointed OBE), and VE-day. He read many of Winston Churchill's great speeches and announced the deaths of both George VI and Queen Mary.<br>
<br>The year 1953 provided the pinnacle of Snagge's career, when he was the main commentator at the coronation of Elizabeth II. High up in a soundproof box in the triforium, he described the rite and pageantry unfolding under his eyes&#151;the shining gold of the Westminster Abbey plate, the dazzle of the crowns&#151;for four hours. Complementing the words and music of the service that listeners could hear for themselves, his commentary was relayed all over the world. &#145;John Snagge's description, with those of Howard Marshall and Audrey Russell, had many Americans damp-eyed before their radio sets&#146;, reported one newspaper the following day  (<span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, 3 June 1953). Though the event was a watershed in turning Britain from a nation of listeners into a nation of viewers, it was still via radio that most people worldwide were able to follow it. Snagge's contribution was vital to their enjoyment and understanding. &#145;Mr Snagge's interjections had the economy, the precision, and at times, it may be added, almost the dignity, of liturgical stage direction&#146;, said <span class="italic">The Times</span>. &#145;None will regret the one intrusion of human interest which he permitted, a brief reference to the expression of the Duke of Cornwall [that is, Prince Charles, aged four] as he watched the ceremony&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 June 1953). Snagge himself summarized the event as &#145;once in a lifetime&#146; and added: &#145;After that, one is quite content if one never broadcasts again&#146;  (<span class="italic">Desert Island Discs</span>, broadcast 31 Aug 1959).<br>
<br>Snagge did, of course, broadcast again, despite administrative tasks as head of presentation for the Home Service until 1957, and head of presentation for all BBC radio thereafter. After his retirement in 1965 he was busy freelancing for another fifteen years, taking modest jobs such as reading the <span class="italic">Epilogue</span> on Radio 4 for &pound;10. He even did a voice-over for a Sex Pistols track, &#145;Pistols propaganda&#146;, the B-side of &#145;Stepping stone&#146;, which reached number twenty-one in the British chart. Very occasionally he appeared on television, including once with Noel Edmonds, though radio was his first love. He was nearly seventy when he began a series called <span class="italic">John Snagge's London</span> on BBC Radio London, making more than 100 editions over a period of seven years. He also did much for the Lord's Taverners, the charity he helped found in 1950 and of which he was three times chairman.<br>
<br>Snagge, who enjoyed fishing and rowing, was twice married: first, on 19 September 1936, to Eileen Mary Josceylyne (<i>c</i>.1905&#150;1980), daughter of H. P. Josceylyne, a dentist, and second, on 6 January 1983, to Joan Mary Wilson (<i>c</i>.1921&#150;1992), a retired contracts assistant whom he had known at the BBC, and daughter of William Wilson. There were no children of either marriage. Snagge died of throat cancer on 25 March 1996, at Thames Valley Nuffield Hospital, Wexham Street, Wexham, Buckinghamshire, not far from his home in Dorney, near Windsor. He was survived by a brother.<br>
