<span class="headword">Lyall,  George</span>  (1778/9&#150;1853), <span class="occ">shipowner and merchant</span>, was the eldest son of John Lyall (1752&#150;1805), a merchant and shipowner of London and Findon, Sussex, and his wife, Jane Camming or Comyn (<i>d</i>. 1867). On his father's death in 1805, he took over the business. Lyall married, and he and his wife, Margaret Ann, had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>The peace of 1815 brought a deep and long depression. Lyall believed that reforms were needed if prosperity was to return, and supported the &#145;liberal&#146; wing of the tory (later Conservative) persuasion. In 1821 he was elected a member of the newly formed Political Economy Club, a discussion society made up of eminent economists and select businessmen, who regarded Adam Smith's <span class="italic">The Wealth of Nations</span> as the starting point of their discourse. Lyall questioned the usefulness of the <span class="roman">Navigation Acts</span>. These were imposed in the seventeenth century to protect trade and shipping; but by the 1820s they seemed to Lyall, and a coterie of like-minded people, detrimental to British enterprise. His commercial experience, and broad outlook, enabled him to give valued advice to William Huskisson who, as president of the Board of Trade (1823&#150;7), made the first dent in the <span class="roman">Navigation Acts</span> by negotiating reciprocity treaties with European states and reducing duties on imports.<br>
<br>The 1832 <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> promised further change, and Lyall sought a place in parliament to be part of it. Unsuccessful at first, he filled a vacancy in 1833 for the City of London but, defeated in 1835, he did not stand again until 1841. By this time, free trade had become a hotly contested topic. By bringing it to a select committee in 1844, Lyall hoped that his views would prevail. Though he chose its members and briefed witnesses, the committee ended without a report because there was no consensus between free traders and protectionists. Two years later, in 1846, however, the repeal of the corn laws (of which Lyall approved) paved the way for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Navigation Acts</span> in 1849. Illness prevented his seeing his work come to fruition; he retired from public life in 1846. During his active years, in and out of parliament, he sat on a variety of select committees: foreign trade (1820, 1824), wrecks (1843), joint stock companies (1844), and the merchant seamen's fund (1845).<br>
<br>In 1823 Lyall, as chairman of the Shipowners' Society (1823&#150;5), presided over a meeting at The London tavern to press for reform in Lloyd's system of registering ships, because it was inefficient and corrupt. No progress could be made before 1833 when he and his colleague George Palmer (1772&#150;1853) formed a provisional committee to bring together the various interests, and in 1834 the New Lloyd's Register of Shipping came to life under strict rules and supervision of a permanent committee, of which Lyall was an original member. He promoted the important Marine Indemnity Company at Lloyd's, and the London Docks and Guardian Insurance companies. In 1830 he was elected a director of the East India Company, and was chairman in 1841&#150;3 and 1844&#150;6.<br>
<br>Again, in 1833, and in conjunction with Palmer, Lyall was a founder member of the General London Ship Owners' Society. It replaced the earlier society, and was much more effective as a lobby for the shipping interest, though many members were staunch protectionists and did not agree with Lyall's views.<br>
<br>Lyall had a sharp mind but he was a poor speaker. With his shy and unobtrusive habits, it was perhaps surprising that Lyall occupied so many important posts. Through his sound judgement, high principles and clear objectives, however, he exercised great influence, and, on occasion, could speak very winningly: in 1834, he persuaded the house to repeal statutes that taxed merchant seamen, and deprived their widows, and orphans, of their tiny pensions; he argued that the maintenance of the Greenwich Hospital, the object of the tax, was the responsibility of the nation.<br>
<br>An honourable man, grave in manner and gentle in temperament, Lyall was respected in the public sphere and loved by his friends. Nutwood Lodge in Reigate, Surrey, was his country retreat. He died at his London home, 17 Park Crescent, Portland Place, Regent's Park, on 1 September 1853.<br>
