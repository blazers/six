<span class="headword">Kettle, Sir  Rupert Alfred</span>  (1817&#150;1894), <span class="occ">industrial arbitrator</span>, was born at Birmingham on 9 January 1817, the fifth son of Thomas F. Kettle of Suffolk Street, Birmingham, a glass-stainer, fancy button and military ornament maker, and gilder. The family was descended from Henri Quitel, a Huguenot of Milhaud or Millau in Languedoc, who emigrated to Birmingham on the revocation of the edict of Nantes, and practised there the trade of glass-stainer. Rupert left Birmingham early in life and, after attending Wolverhampton grammar school, was articled to Richard Fryer, a Wolverhampton attorney. Resolving to qualify as a barrister, he entered the Middle Temple on 2 June 1842, was called to the bar on 6 June 1845, and soon obtained a large practice on the Oxford circuit. On 18 December 1851 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 13 July 1884), only child and heir of William Cooke of Merridale, Wolverhampton. They had four sons and three daughters. At the general election of 1857 Kettle, who was a Liberal of conservative inclinations, was requisitioned to stand against one of the two sitting Liberal MPs for Wolverhampton, but he decided not to pursue his candidature.<br>
<br>In 1859 Kettle was appointed judge of the Worcestershire county courts, and subsequently he acted as chairman of the standing committee for framing the rules for county courts. His position as a judge and the owner of a substantial establishment in an area much affected by industrial disputes led him to take a particular interest in settling conflicts between employers and workers. In 1865, after a strike in the building trade at Wolverhampton had lasted seventeen weeks, Kettle, on invitation from both sides, succeeded in reaching a settlement based on a set of written working rules for the building trade in the town. The essential principle of the new system was that if the delegates of the contending parties could not agree, an independent umpire should have power to make a final and legally binding award between the delegates of the contending parties. The scheme found favour with the building employers and with the unions, whom Kettle came to see as helpful in securing workers' adherence to arbitration awards, and was rapidly extended to other towns, eventually including a large part of the English building trade.<br>
<br>Describing his schemes in two pamphlets, <span class="italic">Strikes and Arbitrations</span> (1866) and <span class="italic">Masters and Men</span> (1871), Kettle gave evidence on their working to the royal commission on trade unions in July 1867 and publicized them at meetings of the Social Science Association. Boards were set up on these lines in the Staffordshire potteries (1868), and subsequently in the coal and iron industries. Although an innovator, Kettle was not a radical: he insisted on applying commercial principles to wage-bargaining, and in particular sought to link wages to the selling price of commodities. He viewed arbitration as an efficient means of determining the market for skilled labour, and tried to place the awards on a legally enforceable basis: but an act of parliament of 1872, which he drafted with lukewarm endorsement by the Trades Union Congress, proved a dead letter. While his methods were more legalistic than those developed by the other contemporary promoter of collective bargaining, A. J. Mundella, the two shared a belief that participation should be voluntary, a founding principle of British industrial relations over the next century. Kettle was much in demand as an arbitrator, presiding over the midland iron trade wages board, and arbitrating in the Teesside iron industry (1869 and 1873) and in the Northumberland coalfield (1875). He was commonly styled the &#145;Prince of Arbitrators&#146;, and on 1 December 1880 he was knighted on Gladstone's recommendation &#145;for his public services in establishing a system of arbitration between employers and employed&#146;. In 1890 the postmaster-general, Henry Cecil Raikes, consulted Kettle during the strike of the Post Office workers. By 1892 arbitration work was taking up so much of his time that he resigned his county court judgeship.<br>
<br>On 24 November 1882 Kettle was elected a bencher of the Middle Temple. He was one of the senior magistrates and a deputy lieutenant of Staffordshire, and he was assistant chairman of quarter sessions from 1866 to 1891. A supporter of church schools, in 1870 he was elected a member of the first school board for Wolverhampton. He was a watercolour artist of some ability, and several of his pictures were publicly exhibited. Kettle died at his residence, Merridale Hall, Wolverhampton, on 6 October 1894, and was buried on 9 October in the Wolverhampton cemetery.<br>
