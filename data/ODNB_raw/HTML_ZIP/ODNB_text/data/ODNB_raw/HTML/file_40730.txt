<span class="headword">Mary Adelaide, Princess</span> <span class="st"> [Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge]</span>, duchess of Teck  (1833&#150;1897), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was born Mary Adelaide Wilhelmina Elizabeth on 27 November 1833 in Hanover, the youngest of the three children of the seventh son of George III, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/169/', "Adolphus Frederick, duke of Cambridge (1774&#150;1850)")</script>, and his wife, Princess Augusta (1797&#150;1889), the daughter of the landgrave of Hesse-Cassel. When she was four, her family moved to Kew, where she had the conventional training of a princess, strong on female accomplishments and the history of the royal family. A lively, imperious girl, she was highly conscious that she derived from the Hanoverian line&#151;the &#145;old royal family&#146;&#151;and not the Saxe-Coburgs.<br>
<br>The first duty of a princess is marriage, but Princess Mary's obesity must have alarmed prospective suitors (the American minister estimated that she weighed 250 pounds). In 1856 she declined a proposal from the widowed king of Sardinia. Just as she was becoming reconciled to remaining a &#145;jolly old maid&#146;, the prince of Wales (later Edward VII) discovered a handsome young officer in the Austrian army, Prince Francis of Teck (1837&#150;1900), the son of the duke of W&uuml;rttemberg. Queen Victoria, perhaps remembering the prince consort's wish to introduce &#145;strong dark blood&#146; into the royal family, approved of the match. After a brief courtship, the couple married at Kew on 12 June 1866. They lived in Kensington Palace, but in 1870 moved to White Lodge in Richmond Park. They had three sons, among them <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32255/', "Alexander Cambridge, earl of Athlone")</script>, and a daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34914/', "Princess Victoria Mary (Princess May)")</script>, who married George, duke of York, later George V. The penniless Prince Francis, who became the first duke of Teck in 1871, lacked employment but found distractions in gardening, feuding over questions of precedence, and arranging the jewels on his wife's dresses. The duchess had a passion for objects but little idea of how to pay for them, although Angela Burdett-Coutts helped out in emergencies. It was a volatile marriage.<br>
<br>The duchess of Teck was remarkable for her benevolence, and she increased her overdrafts by giving away at least 20 per cent of her annual allowance of &pound;5000 granted by parliament. She came from a notable philanthropic background (her father had been the patron of about thirty institutions), but few other members of the royal family so happily transformed good works into a career. A devout Anglican, her charity, like her jewellery, was highly polished and ready to be worn at a moment's notice. Appeals and begging letters bombarded her daily at White Lodge, and though discriminating, she obliged a large number of supplicants each year. Caught up in the craze for bazaars, she had as many as six of them on the go at any one time. The public loved to see her acting as a shop-woman. She enjoyed the part, but often stipulated that if she attended a sale, she could not be expected to purchase the goods.<br>
<br>With the years, the duchess was often on charitable parade opening schools, visiting orphanages, and laying foundation stones. She was highly visible in philanthropic causes associated with the queen's jubilee year, 1887. In her prime, she was arguably the hardest working member of the royal family. Her many charities included Dr Barnardo's, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, the Royal Cambridge Asylum, the St John Ambulance Association, the Young Women's Christian Association, and a dozen or so London hospitals. She was particularly assiduous in her work for the Needlework Guild, which recruited large numbers of middle-class women to make clothes for the poor. Although she had the common touch with the working classes, she could be sharp with ladies who obstructed her charitable administration. As a frequent visitor to the East End, where she was known as &#145;Fat Mary&#146;, she sought to reduce social distress while encouraging deference in the poor.<br>
<br>The duchess of Teck was a pillar of the monarchy's policy of cultivating civil society. Her association with good causes, like that of other members of the royal family, brought the crown and the middle classes into alliance. It raised the prestige and reaffirmed the importance of the monarchy in a time when it was retiring from national politics. Not the least of her services to the crown was the inculcation of charitable habits in her daughter, later Queen Mary, who further expanded the monarchy's welfare role. The duchess's last public appearance was a visit to the Royal Hospital, Chelsea. She died of heart failure at White Lodge on 27 October 1897, after an operation for a strangulated hernia, and was interred in the royal vault at Windsor Castle on 3 November.<br>
