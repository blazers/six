<span class="headword">Vernon,  Thomas</span>  (1654&#150;1721), <span class="occ">law reporter and politician</span>, was born on 25 November 1654, the only son of Richard Vernon (<i>c</i>.1615&#150;1679), a clergyman, of Hanbury Hall, Worcestershire, and Jane Carter (<i>d</i>. 1697). He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 11 May 1672 and called to the bar on 20 May 1679. He was licensed on 5 January 1680 to marry Mary (<i>d</i>. 1733), one of the many daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15235/', "Sir Anthony Keck")</script> of Bell Yard in Chancery Lane, the pre-eminent chancery counsel of his day. This match could only have furthered Vernon's career, as he in turn became a leading practitioner in chancery cases. With judicious investment of his earnings Vernon was able to build up a substantial country estate in the neighbourhood of Hanbury in Worcestershire. Between 1685 and 1717 he spent &pound;62,000 on land, mainly in Worcestershire, and erected a new house at Hanbury which he began to build about 1710. The concomitant of this wealth was increased social prestige and political power. By 1707 he was engaged in Worcestershire politics on the whig side, and in 1715 he was elected knight of the shire. In the House of Commons he supported the government, apart from voting against the <span class="roman">Peerage Bill</span>, which may have been a sign of family ambition, despite having no children.<br>
<br>Vernon may have been financially stretched by his estate-building for he returned to the law. Lord Cobham described to Alexander Pope &#145;Counsellor Vernon retiring to enjoy himself with &pound;5,000, a year which he had got, and returning to Chancery to get a little more when he could not speak so loud as to be heard&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). However, in 1720 he was still very active in chancery, standing thirteenth in the list of most busy practitioners. Vernon died on 5 or 6 February 1721 and was buried in Hanbury church, where a monument was erected to his memory. His wife survived him until 6 July 1733.<br>
<br>Ironically, Vernon's will was the subject of some contention in chancery, a dispute arising over the fate of his manuscript notes on chancery cases between 1681 and 1719. His widow claimed them as part of the &#145;household goods and furniture&#146; which she had been left; the trustees claimed them as part of the residuary estate, as they had been left &#145;the residue of my personal estate&#146;; and the heir, Bowater Vernon, claimed them as the guardian of the reputation of the testator. Lord Chancellor Macclesfield decided the case by retaining the manuscripts in order to have them printed under the court's direction without making any profit. Under the direction of Macclesfield and then Lord King they were published as <span class="italic">Cases argued and adjudged in the high court of chancery, published from the manuscripts of Thomas Vernon</span> in 1726&#150;8 under the editorship of William Melmoth, the elder, and William Peere Williams. This edition was found to be so full of errors and discrepancies that, at the suggestion of Lord Eldon, a new and far superior edition was brought out in 1806&#150;7 by John Raithby. A further edition appeared in 1828.<br>
