<span class="headword">Pye,  William George</span>  (1869&#150;1949), <span class="occ">scientific instrument and radio manufacturer</span>, was born at Battersea, London, on 27 October 1869, the eldest son and the third of the eight children of William Thomas Pye and his wife, Elizabeth. Trained as a scientific instrument maker by his father, who was associated with the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company, he joined the staff of the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University at the age of twenty-three. In the same year, 1892, he married Annie Eliza, the daughter of John Atkins, a joiner. They had four children: William John (who died in infancy), Donald Walter, Marjorie Irene, and <a href="#cosubject_51847">Harold John [<i>see below</i>]</a>, who later assisted in his father's business.<br>
<br>Pye started his own company in 1896. He worked at first on a part-time basis assisted by his wife, his father, and his brothers Henry and Frederick. In 1899 he left the Cavendish Laboratory to devote himself full-time to the business, by then known as W. G. Pye &amp; Co. The company prospered, moving into larger premises in 1899 and again in 1913.<br>
<br>The outbreak of war in 1914 brought a sudden large demand for optical and electrical instruments for the armed services. In addition to its normal ranges of equipment, the company produced such specialized items as precision gunsights and the first Aldis signalling lamps. Pye's staff more than doubled to meet these orders during the war years.<br>
<br>After the war the market contracted almost as quickly as it had grown. In 1922 the company sought new business, and produced panels which could be connected together to make various items of radio apparatus. Intended as teaching aids for schools and colleges, they were soon popular with radio hobbyists as well. After the formation of the BBC at the end of the year, the company decided to produce complete radio receivers. However, its sets of the &#145;500&#146; series, though well made, were less sensitive than those of its competitors, and consequently unpopular.<br>
<br>William's son, <a name="cosubject_51847"></a><span class="headword">Harold John Pye</span>  (1901&#150;1986)<span class="occ"></span>, born at 19 Humberstone Road, Chesterton, Cambridgeshire, on 27 November 1901, joined the company after graduating from St John's College, Cambridge, in 1923, and was made a partner in 1924. He was an energetic salesman and a skilled engineer. His receivers of the &#145;700&#146; series, designed to meet customers' needs, were the first really successful Pye sets. With careful attention to the styling of the receivers' cabinets, demand increased rapidly. The radio side of the company expanded to occupy the whole of the original factory site by 1927; the instrument business was again obliged to move into new premises. Harold's former tutor, Sir Edward Appleton, was technical adviser to the company at this period.<br>
<br>Apparently disturbed by the dominance of what he had intended to be no more than a subsidiary, William Pye sold the radio business to Charles Orr Stanley in 1929. It continued to trade under the name of Pye Radio Ltd at first, then in 1937 changed to Pye Ltd. The original company, W. G. Pye &amp; Co., continued under William's leadership, successfully surviving the depression of the 1930s.<br>
<br>William Pye retired and sold his interest in the business to Harold in 1936. He moved to Bexhill, Sussex, where he was able to indulge his interest in sailing. He died at his home, Stepaside, 5 Beaulieu Road, on 13 October 1949.<br>
<br>Harold Pye ran the company from 1936 to 1947, concentrating again on the design and manufacture of military equipment during the Second World War. He then agreed to sell the company to Pye Ltd. The radio and instrumentation businesses were reunited but no longer controlled by the Pye family. Having ensured that his employees' careers were adequately protected, Pye retired at the early age of forty-six.<br>
<br>Pye had married Jennie, the daughter of Clowes Garner Milson, on 1 March 1927. They had no children. After Jennie's death in 1948 he moved to Burnham-on-Crouch in Essex and started a second career as a farmer. He remarried on 20 December 1955; his second wife was Edith Pinney, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Flight, a widow, who brought him two stepchildren, Janet and John. Edith died in 1969; Harold then sold his farm and, like his father, devoted his time to sailing. He died at 40 Westerfield Road, Ipswich, Suffolk, on 20 January 1986.<br>
