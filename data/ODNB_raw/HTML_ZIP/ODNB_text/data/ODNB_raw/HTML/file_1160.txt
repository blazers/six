<span class="headword">Baldwin</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1097), <span class="occ">abbot of Bury St Edmunds</span>, was born in Chartres and became a Benedictine monk at St Denis, Paris, before serving as the prior of one of the abbey's daughter houses at Leberaw in Alsace. He came to England as Edward the Confessor's physician, and he received the church of Deerhurst in Gloucestershire and the manor of Taynton in Oxfordshire from the king, which he held as a dependency of St Denis. His royal and continental connections made him the ideal successor to Leofstan, abbot of Bury St Edmunds, in 1065.<br>
<br>With the appointment of Lanfranc as archbishop of Canterbury in 1070, the ecclesiastical landscape changed dramatically as he wished to implement the plans of the reforming papacy, which called for sees to be located in the major towns and for abbots to be subject to diocesan control. To protect Bury from this threat Baldwin travelled to Rome in 1071 where he secured a privilege which placed his abbey under the protection of the papacy. Neither letters of criticism from Lanfranc nor the testimony of jurors from nine counties persuaded Herfast, the bishop of Thetford, to abandon his claim to Bury. According to the <span class="italic">Liber de miraculis sancti Eadmundi</span>, when Herfast damaged his eyes in a riding accident, Baldwin agreed to save his sight only if he agreed to give up his claim. Orders from Rome, oral memory, and oaths made under duress did not, however, resolve the dispute, and at Easter 1081 the rival parties assembled in front of the king and the royal council in London. Baldwin defeated his opponent by producing four spurious charters in which English kings forbade the bishop of East Anglia from interfering with Bury Abbey in any way. Subsequent attempts to move the see to Bury were easily disposed of, as Baldwin not only kept the writ which enforced this decision but also had the foresight to forge a diploma in which William I expressly forbade Herfast and his successors from seeking to revive their claim to Bury. Baldwin's actions ensured that Bury was not chosen as the new ecclesiastical capital of East Anglia, and the documents which he collated guaranteed the monastery's independence until the dissolution.<br>
<br>One of the problems which many abbots faced during the Norman conquest was the hostility of Norman lords towards their founding saints, which was often the prelude to seizing these houses' wealth. As late as 1095 the nobles of William II's court recommended that the king should seize the wealth from Edmund's shrine as they argued that the saint was buried elsewhere. Baldwin responded with a programme of hagiography which quashed these dangerous rumours and justified the Bury version of events. Scribes interpolated &AElig;lfric's life of St Edmund to establish that Edmund was buried at Bury. Baldwin also commissioned Hermann, the archdeacon, to write the <span class="italic">Liber de miraculis sancti Eadmundi</span>. In this work it was claimed that the saint had made himself &#145;as heavy as a mountain&#146; in order to avoid being buried elsewhere, and that Abbot Leofstan had conclusively proved during Edward the Confessor's reign that Edmund was buried in the abbey's shrine. Baldwin worked with English monks and continental scholars to establish a new past in order to protect the abbey from episcopal and baronial aggression.<br>
<br>Norman barons also posed a threat to abbeys by occupying the latter's estates and seeking to exercise lordship over their men. At some time between 1066 and 1070, Baldwin received two writs which ruled out such enterprise. The first guaranteed his right to retain the lands which had formerly been leased out to his subtenants who had died while fighting against William I, and the second excluded royal tax collectors from the eight and a half hundreds in western Suffolk, confirming the fiscal privileges which the abbey had received <i>c</i>.1043&#150;1044. The best means by which land could be transferred to Norman barons, namely through forfeiture for treason and failure to pay the geld, were expressly ruled out by these privileges. Baldwin also commissioned the feudal book which, by listing all the abbey's human and arable capital, made it extremely difficult for other lords to exploit the ambiguities between soke, commendation, and tenure in order to gain control of the monastery's property. This inventory drew upon the accounting techniques introduced by his predecessor, Abbot Leofstan, and was used until the late twelfth century by the Bury monks.<br>
<br>Baldwin continued to have connections with the region of his birthplace, as many of the post-1066 tenants in the eight and a half hundreds came from the Chartres region. In the town of Bury St Edmunds, Baldwin cleared arable land to make way for 342 new houses, and it is possible that some of the burgesses who abandoned 328 dwellings in Ipswich about that time may have moved to Bury, attracted by the extremely low rents offered by Baldwin. The <span class="italic">Liber de miraculis</span> records that Abbot Baldwin sat in silence for three days as he pondered how to pay for the building of a new abbey church, and he actively encouraged both English and French to settle on the abbey's estates. The abbey choir was built in the new Gothic style and, with its splendid carved vaulting, was thought by contemporaries to rival the temple of Solomon. When it was completed in 1095, St Edmund was translated to the new shrine. Baldwin died in January 1097 and was buried at Bury St Edmunds. He defended his abbey's rights against the ideals of a reforming episcopate and the avariciousness of the Norman aristocracy by drawing upon his medical knowledge, the skills of his monks, and connections with both the royal and papal courts. Contemporaries observed that Baldwin &#145;renewed everything within and without&#146;  (<span class="italic">De gestis pontificum</span>, 156) and that &#145;he was the true father and the illustrious restorer of his house&#146;  (Hermann, 58).<br>
