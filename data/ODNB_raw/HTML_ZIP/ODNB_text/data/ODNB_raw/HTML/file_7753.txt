<span class="headword">Dods,  Marcus</span>  (1786&#150;1838), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and theologian</span>, was born on 7 December 1786 near Gifford, Haddingtonshire. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh and was ordained as a minister in the Church of Scotland at Belford, Northumberland, in 1811. On 6 May 1818 he married Sarah Palliser (<i>d</i>. 1859); the couple had seven children of whom the most significant was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32850/', "Marcus Dods (1834&#150;1909)")</script>, the Free Church minister and professor of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> at New College, Edinburgh. Dods was a distinguished scholar, and used his knowledge of biblical languages, oriental literature, and patristic studies in both his preaching and his writing; the evangelical leader Thomas Chalmers described him as &#145;being at once rich in the scholarship of a varied and extensive erudition, and yet possessed in no ordinary degree of massive and original powers of his own&#146;  (T. Chalmers, &#145;Recommendary notice&#146;, in M. Dods, <span class="italic">On the Incarnation of the Eternal Word</span>, 2nd edn, 1841, v). Dods was a frequent and distinguished contributor to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Christian Instructor</span>, the principal organ of the evangelical party in the Church of Scotland, and became its editor after the death of Andrew Thomson (1779&#150;1831), the celebrated evangelical whose biography he was planning to write at the time of his own death. In the 1820s Dods was actively involved in the <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span> controversy, strongly opposing the inclusion in <span class="roman">Bibles</span> of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span>. He wrote a humorous but forceful statement of his position called <span class="italic">Anglicanus Scotched</span> (1828) and in the same year produced <span class="italic">Remarks on the Bible</span>, described as &#145;perhaps as good a statement as the age saw of the case put forward by those who stood for an undiluted and a thoroughly inspired Canon of Scripture&#146;  (Macleod, 261).<br>
<br>Dods was a prominent and committed opponent of Edward Irving's views on the doctrine of the incarnation of Christ, and penned a particularly devastating review of Irving's <span class="italic">The Doctrine of the Incarnation Opened</span> in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Christian Instructor</span> in January 1830. In that review Dods caustically remarked that Irving &#145;contradicts himself more frequently than any other writer probably ever did. With Mr Irving a single idea is spread over many a turgid page&#146;  (M. Dods, &#145;Review&#146;, <span class="italic">Edinburgh Christian Instructor</span>, Jan 1830, 2&#150;3). A late twentieth-century biographer of Irving described Dods as &#145;Irving's sternest and most theologically erudite critic&#146;  (Needham, 476). Dods expanded his own views on the incarnation in his most famous work, <span class="italic">On the Incarnation of the Eternal Word</span> (1831), a powerful and closely argued statement of the doctrine of the sinlessness of Christ, which according to the writer of his obituary in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Christian Instructor</span> &#145;will remain a permanent monument of his research, learning and strength of intellect &hellip; as well as of his warm, fervent and rational piety&#146;  (<span class="italic">Edinburgh Christian Instructor</span>, 544). Dods died on 29 September 1838 after more than six months of illness and was buried in Belford, where his epitaph concludes that &#145;he captivated his friends by his rich converse, and edified the church by his learned and eloquent pen&#146;.<br>
