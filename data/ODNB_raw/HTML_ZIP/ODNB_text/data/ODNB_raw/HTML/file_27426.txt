<span class="headword">Thynne,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1546), <span class="occ">literary editor</span>, is of obscure origins. His family bore the alternative surname of Botfield or Boteville and he is also cited as &#145;Thynne alias Boteville&#146;. The claim that he was the younger son of John de la Inne, with his wife, Jane Bowdler, seems to lack evidence  (Round, 193&#150;5). Wood asserts that he was from Shropshire and educated at Oxford. He may be the William Thynne who is described in 1518 as &#145;chief clerk&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 2, pt 2, app. 58). He is first certainly recorded in February 1524 when he is described as second clerk of the kitchen in Henry VIII's household. By October 1526 he was chief clerk of the kitchen and the recipient of an annuity of &pound;10. In July 1528 he became bailiff and keeper of the park of Beaudley, and in July of the following year he was appointed customer of wools, hides, and fleeces in the port of London. In October that year he was made receiver-general of the earldom of March and keeper of Gateley Park.<br>
<br>Further indications of royal favour followed. In March 1532 Thynne received, with others, an annuity of 100 marks, and in May 1533 he was almoner and surveyor of the dressers at the wedding of Anne Boleyn. By April 1537 he was Henry's clerk controller. By 1543 he was one of the two masters of the household for the king, and in the year of his death he appears to have been the sole master. In 1544 he had also become one of the officers of the counting house.<br>
<br>Thynne's career as a courtier was conducted simultaneously with his literary activities, particularly his interest in Chaucer, which led to the publication by Thomas Godfray of his first collected edition of <span class="italic">The Workes of Geffray Chaucer</span> in 1532. This edition was clearly the outcome of sustained research and editing. Thynne's son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27420/', "Francis Thynne")</script>, reports that his father had owned a number of manuscripts of Chaucer's works &#145;of whiche written copies there came to me after my fathers deathe some fyve and twentye, whereof some had moore and some fewer tales&#146;  (Thynne, 11&#150;12). Several manuscripts survive that Thynne used in the preparation of his edition. These include a manuscript of the Middle English <span class="italic">Romaunt of the Rose</span>  (Glasgow University, MS Hunterian V. 3.7), and Longleat MS 258 which provided the source for six other poems. In addition, a copy of Caxton's edition of Chaucer's <span class="italic">Boece</span>, also at Longleat, the Thynne family seat, again contains printer's marks, which indicates that, like the manuscripts, it was used as setting copy for the 1532 edition. For other works Thynne seems to have used Pynson's 1526 editions of Chaucer as his copy-texts. It seems that in some instances he undertook careful comparison of different versions of texts to establish his own editions of Chaucer's works.<br>
<br>In his 1532 edition Thynne provides the first printed editions of a number of Chaucer's major works in verse and prose, including <span class="italic">The Book of the Duchess</span>, <span class="italic">The Legend of Good Women</span>, <span class="italic">Boece</span>, <span class="italic">The Treatise on the Astrolabe</span>. He also printed a large number of works not by Chaucer, including poems by John Lydgate, Thomas Hoccleve, Richard Roos, and Robert Henryson. The introductory materials to the edition, which include the first life of Chaucer and a genealogy, are prefaced by an unsigned dedication to Henry VIII by Bryan Tuke, the king's secretary. (Tuke's authorship is established by a note in his hand in the copy of Thynne's edition in Clare College, Cambridge.)<br>
<br>Thynne evidently had more extensive literary interests. His son, Francis, reports that the poet John Skelton wrote most of his poem &#145;Colin Clout&#146; at Thynne's house in Erith, Kent  (Thynne, 10). Francis also records that his father had wished to include the anti-Catholic <span class="italic">Plowman's Tale</span> (which Francis appears to confuse with a mid-sixteenth-century poem, &#145;The Pilgrim's Tale&#146;) in the 1532 Chaucer but was thwarted by Wolsey  (ibid.). A separate edition was issued by Godfray (<i>c</i>.1533). (There is no direct evidence that Thynne himself was involved in this printing, but its publication by a printer with whom he had other associations at this time is suggestive.) The <span class="italic">Plowman's Tale</span> was added to the 1542 reprinting of Thynne's edition of Chaucer and appeared in subsequent sixteenth-century editions of his works.<br>
<br>Thynne died on 10 August 1546, and was buried in the church of All Hallows Barking by the Tower, where there is a brass to his memory. His will, dated 16 November 1540, was proved on 7 September 1546. His wife, Anne, daughter of William Bond, clerk of the green cloth, was sole executrix and chief legatee.<br>
