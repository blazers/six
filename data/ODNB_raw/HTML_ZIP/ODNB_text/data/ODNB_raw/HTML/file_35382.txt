<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Parker,  Charles Stuart</span>  (1829&#150;1910), <span class="occ">politician and biographer</span>, born at Aigburth, Liverpool, on 1 June 1829, was the eldest son of Charles Stewart Parker of Fairlie, Ayrshire, a partner in the prosperous Liverpool firm of Sandbach, Tinne &amp; Co., merchants for the West Indies. His mother was Anne, eldest daughter of Samuel Sandbach of Hafodunnos, Denbighshire. Thomas Chalmers, a friend of his paternal grandparents, was one of Parker's godfathers, and he was throughout life influenced by the evangelical temper of his home training. On 13 August 1838 his father's sister Annie married Edward (afterwards Viscount) Cardwell, whose political views he came to share. Parker was at Eton College from 1842 to 1847, and in 1846 won the prince consort's prize for German. On 10 June 1847 he matriculated from Brasenose College, Oxford, but the next year migrated to University College where he had won a scholarship. There he began a long and close association with the college and formed friendships with A. P. Stanley, Goldwin Smith, John Conington, Arthur Gray Butler, William Bright, and T. W. Jex-Blake. Friends at other colleges included A. W. Peel (afterwards speaker of the House of Commons), G. C. Brodrick, T. H. Green, G. J. Goschen, W. H. Fremantle, Frederic Harrison, and Grant Duff. In 1852 he joined Goschen, Brodrick, and others in starting the Oxford Essay Club, and he frequently attended the club dinners in later life, at Goschen's house and elsewhere.<br>
<br>In Easter term 1852 Parker was placed in the first class in <i>literae humaniores</i>, and in the second class of the mathematical school, graduating BA and proceeding to MA in 1855. He was a fellow of his college from 1854 until 1868, and lived in Oxford until 1864, throwing himself with vigour into the work of both college and university. He was college tutor from 1858 to 1865, and was one of the first lecturers in modern history. He was examiner in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1859, 1860, 1863, and 1868. He won the confidence of undergraduates, and introduced them to men of note from the outer world, whom from an early date he entertained at Oxford. He organized the university volunteer corps and did much while major of the battalion (1865&#150;8) to improve its efficiency, especially in shooting. The main recreation of his university days was mountaineering. He preferred climbing without guides, and it was without guides that he, with his brothers Sandbach and Alfred, made the second and fourth attempts on the Matterhorn in 1860 and 1861 respectively. Subsequently Parker's climbing companions included W. H. Gladstone and Stephen Gladstone, sons of the statesman, who was a friend of Parker and his family.<br>
<br>Like Brodrick, Goldwin Smith, and other Oxford men, Parker was a contributor to the early issues of the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> in 1855, but he soon withdrew owing to his dislike of the cynical tone of the paper, and a characteristic impatience of its partisan, tory spirit. He gradually concentrated his interest on liberal reform of the university. He especially urged a prudent recognition of the claims of science, modern history, and modern languages in the academic curriculum, and the throwing open of scholarships to competition. He was an early supporter of a national system of elementary education which should be efficient and compulsory, rather than voluntary. In 1867 he published two essays, one on &#145;Popular education&#146;, in <span class="italic">Questions for a Reformed Parliament</span>, arguing that only a reformed parliament would pass an adequate elementary education measure, and the other on &#145;Classical education&#146;, in F. W. Farrar's <span class="italic">Essays on a Liberal Education</span>.<br>
<br>In 1864 Parker, who inherited ample means, diversified his academic duties by becoming private secretary to his uncle, Edward Cardwell, who was then colonial secretary, working for him until he went out of office in 1866. At the wish of Gladstone, with whom his relations steadily became closer, Parker stood for Perthshire in 1868 as a Liberal. He gained a startling victory over the former Conservative member, Sir William Stirling Maxwell, who regained the seat from him at the general election of 1874. Parker was however elected for the city of Perth in 1878, and retained the seat until 1892, when he was defeated in a three-cornered contest. He failed to win a seat in West Perthshire in 1900. He was a competent back-bencher but a poor speaker. He never held ministerial office, nor appears to have been offered it. But he was quite close to the Peelites among the Liberal leadership, and prepared for publication Gladstone's Midlothian speeches of 1879&#150;80.<br>
<br>It was on educational policy that Parker exerted his chief influence. Joining the public schools commission (1868&#150;74), he proved one of its most active members, urging that the public school curriculum should be modernized in sympathy with a progressive policy at the universities. He also sat on the commission for military education in 1869, and advocated the linking up of the public schools with Sandhurst and Woolwich, so as to ensure a broad general culture before technical and professional training. Again, as a member of the Scottish educational endowments commission in 1872, he argued persistently that the benefits of endowments should go &#145;not to the most necessitous of those fairly fitted intellectually, but to the most fit among those who were fairly necessitous&#146;. His views greatly stimulated the development of secondary education in Scotland: he wished the Scottish elementary schools to form a &#145;ladder&#146; to the university, and he sought to protect them from the evil system of &#145;payment by results&#146;. He was in 1887 chairman of a departmental committee on higher education in the elementary schools of Scotland, and wrote its report with Sir Henry Craik.<br>
<br>Parker, whose wide interests embraced a precise study of scientific hypotheses, in his later years became an important historian of the Peelites. His <span class="italic">Sir Robert Peel from his Private Papers</span> (3 vols., 1891&#150;9), for which he was given special access by Gladstone and others, remains an important source, as does his <span class="italic">Life and Letters of Sir James Graham</span> (2 vols., 1907). He was elected honorary fellow of University College in 1899, and was made honorary LLD of Glasgow and honorary DCL of Oxford in 1908. In 1907 he was sworn of the privy council.<br>
<br>Parker died unmarried at his London house, 32 Old Queen Street, Westminster, on 18 June 1910, and was buried at Fairlie. He bequeathed &pound;5000 to University College, Oxford, where two Parker scholarships for modern history were established but later discontinued.<br>
