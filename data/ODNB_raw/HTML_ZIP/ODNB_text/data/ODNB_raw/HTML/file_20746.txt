<span class="headword">O'Loghlen, Sir  Colman Michael</span>, second baronet  (1819&#150;1877), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20747/', "Sir Michael O'Loghlen, first baronet (1789&#150;1842)")</script>, master of the rolls in Ireland, and Bidelia, daughter of Daniel Kelly of Dublin, was born on 20 September 1819. He was educated at private schools in England and at University College, London, and graduated BA at London University. He had entered the Middle Temple in 1837, and in 1840 he was called to the Irish bar and went on the Munster circuit. As a junior he took a number of briefs in the state trials at Dublin and Clonmel in 1848, at which a number of Young Irelanders were tried in the wake of their failed insurrection. His performances drew compliments from bench and bar alike, and as one of his clients was to write, &#145;He resolutely refuses fees. In fact he spends money in our behalf instead of making money by us.&#146;<br>
<br>O'Loghlen took silk in 1852. From 1856 to 1859 he was chairman of Carlow quarter sessions, and from 1859 to 1861 he held the same position in co. Mayo. In 1863, standing as a Liberal, he was elected MP for County Clare, and he held the seat until his death. In 1865 he was made a third serjeant-at-law for Ireland, and he became second serjeant in the following year. He was appointed judge-advocate-general in Gladstone's ministry and a member of the privy council in December 1868; he held the former office until November 1870. O'Loghlen also introduced and carried the bill of 1867 which enabled Roman Catholics to obtain the position of lord chancellor of Ireland.<br>
<br>A member of the Stephen's Green Club (Dublin) and the Reform Club (London), O'Loghlen's unassuming manner and good nature made him universally popular. He died suddenly, on 22 July 1877, on board the mailboat while crossing from Holyhead to Kingstown. He was buried in the family vault in co. Clare. He was unmarried, and his brother Bryan succeeded to the title.<br>
