<span class="headword">Clark, Sir  (John) Grahame Douglas</span>  (1907&#150;1995), <span class="occ">archaeologist and prehistorian</span>, was born on 28 July 1907 at 5 Scotts Avenue, Shortlands, Beckenham, in Kent, the elder son of Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Douglas Clark, a stock jobber, and his wife, Maude Ethel Grahame Shaw. He was educated at Marlborough College, where his early interest in prehistory was soon fuelled by the rich archaeological monuments of the Wiltshire downs, and where he published his first articles on prehistoric flint implements in the reports of the school natural history society between 1923 and 1926. From Marlborough he went on in 1926 to Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he studied history before transferring to the newly created archaeology and anthropology tripos, and secured a first-class degree in 1930. He went on to take a PhD degree, under the supervision of Miles Burkitt, on the mesolithic industries of Britain. He became an assistant lecturer in the faculty of archaeology and anthropology in 1935, a full university lecturer in 1946, and eventually, on the retirement of Dorothy Garrod in 1952, the Disney professor of archaeology, a position he held until his own retirement in 1974. Clark had been elected a bye-fellow at Peterhouse in 1933 and a full fellow in 1950, and from 1973 to 1980 he served as master of the college. On 18 July 1936 he married Gwladys Maud (Mollie) White, herself an archaeologist with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, and a source of both personal and professional support and inspiration throughout his life. They had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>The impact of Grahame Clark on the development of British and indeed world prehistory was profound on several different levels. In the organization of the discipline he was one of the leading figures in the creation of the influential fenland research committee in 1932, and then in 1935 was largely responsible for transforming the Prehistoric Society of East Anglia into a fully national society for prehistory. He edited the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society</span> from 1935 to 1970 and was president of the society from 1958 to 1962. Following his war service in aerial reconnaissance, his headship of the department of archaeology at Cambridge was notable above all for the string of distinguished undergraduates and research students who subsequently went off to major academic positions and research careers in various parts of Africa, Australia, New Zealand, North America, and elsewhere, as well as in Britain itself. He chaired the archaeology section of the British Academy (to which he was elected in 1951) from 1974 to 1978, and was at various times a member of the Ancient Monuments Board, the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments (England), and many other academic and management committees. Possibly his most significant achievement was his central role in creating (through the combined efforts of the British Academy and the Royal Society) the science-based archaeology committee of the Science Research Council in 1975, a committee which provided a major impetus, as well as substantial funding, for the development of archaeological science research in Britain, and for which he himself served as the first chairman. He was equally influential in creating in 1966 the British Academy major research project into the early history of agriculture, which, under the direction of Eric Higgs, placed Cambridge in the forefront of international research into the origins of farming communities.<br>
<br>Clark's contributions to the study of European and world prehistory are hard to overestimate. His initial achievement was to place for the first time the study of the mesolithic (that is, immediately pre-farming) period in Britain onto a proper footing&#151;mainly through the publication of <span class="italic">The Mesolithic Age in Britain</span> (based on his own doctoral research) in 1932. He went on to provide a more comprehensive and very differently structured synthesis of the Scandinavian mesolithic in <span class="italic">The Mesolithic Settlement of Northern Europe</span> in 1936. In the interval between publishing these two books Clark had been greatly inspired by the potential contributions of the natural sciences to archaeology, reflected in his involvement in the fenland research committee and the associated excavations at Shippea Hill and his close contacts with Harry Godwin (later professor of botany at Cambridge) and the recently developed technique of pollen analysis as a means of both the relative dating of archaeological sites within a climatic framework and the reconstruction of their environmental setting. His close contacts with Scandinavian prehistory had opened his eyes to the immense potential of waterlogged sites as a source of organic (especially bone and wood) artefacts and their associated palaeoenvironmental evidence, and this culminated between 1949 and 1951 in his classic excavations at the early mesolithic lakeside settlement of Star Carr in Yorkshire, published promptly as a handsome monograph by Cambridge University Press in 1954.<br>
<br>The same influences also contributed to Clark's major turn of interest towards the specifically economic and social, as opposed to typological and chronological, aspects of prehistory&#151;an approach also fostered by his contacts with Michael Postan and other economic historians at Peterhouse. His book <span class="italic">Prehistoric Europe: the Economic Basis</span>, published in 1952 and based on his Munro lectures at Edinburgh University in 1949, is generally regarded as Clark's greatest academic achievement, and displayed an impressive command not only of the relevant archaeological data across a broad range of subjects and periods but also a wide range of comparative ethnographic and ethnohistorical material. It is now clear that much of this work in archaeological science and related economic and ecological studies underlay much of the development of the so-called new archaeology of the 1960s and 1970s, skilfully developed in Britain by two of Clark's own students, Colin Renfrew and David Clarke.<br>
<br>Clark's other outstanding achievement was to champion world prehistory as a truly global academic enterprise, which was essential to a proper understanding of both the origins and the present condition of mankind. Supported by his own extensive travels and his massive command of the international literature, he published in 1961 the initial version of <span class="italic">World Prehistory: an Outline</span>. This was further updated in 1969 as <span class="italic">World Prehistory: a New Outline</span>, and again in 1977 (after further travelling in Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, the Philippines, North America, and elsewhere) as <span class="italic">World Prehistory in New Perspective</span>, and was eventually translated into over a dozen languages, including Korean and Serbo-Croat. While no work on this scale could be without occasional errors, it represented a breathtaking achievement in synthesis which no one subsequently has attempted to match. In all he published more than twenty books, as well as numerous articles and reviews.<br>
<br>Clark's contributions to scholarship were recognized in many different ways. He held three honorary doctorates and was a member of numerous foreign academies of humanities and science; he was also awarded several medals. He held visiting appointments at the universities of Harvard, Berkeley, Uppsala, and Otago, and at the Australian National University. The greatest honour perhaps was the award of the Erasmus prize by the Praemium Erasmianum Foundation of the Netherlands in 1990. With characteristic generosity he donated the proceeds of this prize to the Prehistoric Society, to establish an annual Europa prize and associated lecture by leading European prehistorians. He also endowed a biennial medal for prehistory, administered by the British Academy. Appointed CBE in 1971 and knighted in 1992, Clark died at his home, 36 Millington Road, Cambridge, on 12 September 1995.<br>
<br>Clark was a tall, impressive figure, who commanded respect in his chairing of meetings and in his mastership of Peterhouse by his rapid and balanced grasp of issues and the clarity of his thinking. He was by temperament rather reserved and quietly spoken, and he certainly never attempted to join the public arena of television and media presentations in the way embraced by some of his contemporaries, such as Glyn Daniel or Sir Mortimer Wheeler. Politically he was some way to the right of centre, an inclination perhaps reflected in one of his later books, <span class="italic">Symbols of Excellence: Precious Materials as Expressions of Status</span> (1986). He was above all a totally committed and dedicated scholar, who put his research and writing commitments at the top of his agenda and was unfailingly helpful and generous to others, whether colleagues or students, who shared the same passions. He was also something of an art connoisseur, with special interests in modern art and early oriental ceramics, of which he built up a substantial personal collection. Together with gardening, and sailing from his country home in Aldeburgh, these occupied some of the few moments in life which were not devoted, passionately and with great effect, to the pursuit of prehistory.<br>
