<span class="headword">Bessell,  Peter Joseph</span>  (1921&#150;1985), <span class="occ">politician and businessman</span>, was born on 24 August 1921 at Elm Bank Nursing Home, Bath, the only son of Joseph Edgar Bessell, tailor, and his wife, Olive Simons Hawkins. His parents divorced in 1926 and Bessell was brought up by his father. Educated at Lynwyd School, Bath (1928&#150;37), he took on his father's business at the latter's death in 1940. Having commenced a career as a Congregational lay preacher in 1939 he registered as a conscientious objector at the outbreak of the Second World War, only to de-register in 1942 and lecture for the Ministry of Information. He married Joyce Margaret Thomas in 1942; she died five years later.<br>
<br>Bessell married Pauline Colledge, with whom he had two children, in 1948; he sold his father's business and moved to Paignton, Devon, where he established his own dry cleaning firm. He became prominent in the Torbay area, particularly through organizing Paignton's coronation pageant, which led to his selection as Liberal candidate for Torquay for the 1955 general election. Bessell had first joined the Liberals in 1945, probably as a natural consequence of his religious nonconformism, but had no political experience before his selection. He saved his deposit and within months raised the Liberal vote by 10 per cent at a by-election, his brash showmanship making a significant contribution to the Liberals' best English by-election performance since the war.<br>
<br>Bessell moved to Bodmin in 1956 and was quickly adopted as the constituency's Liberal candidate. His organizational ability and modern, go-ahead image reinvigorated the Liberal Association and broadened its appeal beyond its traditional, nonconformist support. He cut the Conservative majority in Bodmin in 1959 and won the seat by more than 3000 votes in 1964. Despite this success the contradictions which destroyed his career were already becoming evident. He cultivated the support of Isaac Foot, symbolically visiting his grave after his election was declared in 1964, and continued his preaching and his membership of the Brotherhood Movement, of which he was president in 1967&#150;8. Behind his public image, however, his private life was shambolic. His Paignton business had collapsed and Bessell used his parliamentary office to try, unsuccessfully, to broker an ambitious range of Anglo-American business deals. Senior Liberals ensured that he did not lose his seat through bankruptcy as he lurched from one financial crisis to another. Self-confessedly a promiscuous womanizer, he boasted of affairs with his parliamentary secretaries.<br>
<br>Bessell was a hard-working MP, speaking for the Liberals on a wide range of economic and industrial issues and sitting on select committees on procedure, estimates, and agriculture. Nevertheless, he was not a popular figure within the party. His views on capital punishment, the Rhodesian situation, and the American intervention in Vietnam, which he had witnessed at first hand as part of a parliamentary delegation in 1967, were decidedly illiberal. He was ridiculed for a television interview in 1965 during which he predicted that Jo Grimond would be elected speaker and that he would gladly accept the Liberal leadership. His majority was reduced in 1966, and two years later he announced that he would not contest the next general election, in order to concentrate on his business career.<br>
<br>When he moved to the United States in 1970 Bessell's financial position worsened, and by 1974 he was bankrupt. He divorced in 1978 and immediately married his intimate friend, Diane Miller, spending the last decade of his life living modestly in California. His notoriety was to be enhanced by one further episode, however. A friend and ally of Jeremy Thorpe, Bessell was closely involved in the events which culminated in Thorpe's trial for the attempted murder of Norman Scott. Bessell was chief witness for the prosecution, but his credibility was systematically destroyed by George Carman QC; he wrote his memoir of the trial, <span class="italic">Cover up</span>, in 1981. A chain-smoker, Bessell died of emphysema on 27 November 1985, in Oceanside, Los Angeles, California.<br>
