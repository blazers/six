<span class="headword">Coutts,  William Lehman Ashmead Bartlett  Burdett-</span>  (1851&#150;1921), <span class="occ">philanthropist and politician</span>, was born in Plymouth, Massachusetts, on 20 June 1851, the second son of Ellis Bartlett (<i>d</i>. 1852) and his wife, Sophia, daughter of John King Ashmead of Philadelphia. His grandparents on both sides of the parental line were British subjects. His mother was widowed in 1852 and she moved to England with her two sons, William (who was known as Ashmead for much of his life) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30627/', "Ellis Ashmead Bartlett (1849&#150;1902)")</script>. She settled in Torquay and met one of its most distinguished residents, the wealthy philanthropist Angela Georgina (from 1871 Baroness) <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32175/', "Burdett-Coutts (1814&#150;1906)")</script>. Angela Burdett-Coutts was charmed by the intelligence and quick wit of the younger son, sympathized with Mrs Bartlett's predicament, and paid for William's education, privately in Torquay and later at Highgate School. In 1870 he entered Keble College, Oxford, recently founded to provide an inexpensive education on Anglican lines for men of limited means, and held the first scholarship to be endowed at the college. After graduating with third-class honours in modern history (1874), he read for the bar at the Inner Temple, but moved into the baroness's secretariat and became increasingly involved in her philanthropic activities. In 1877 she dispatched him as voluntary special commissioner to organize the Turkish Compassionate Fund, founded to provide relief to Turkish villagers displaced during the Russo-Turkish War. Even though Bartlett succumbed to typhus, these moneys were administered efficiently. In 1879&#150;80 Bartlett, having recovered, travelled to Ireland to organize charitable relief among Irish fishermen.<br>
<br>The most important event of Bartlett's life was his marriage to his mentor, the baroness, at Christ Church, Down Street, London, on 12 February 1881. The marriage of a young impecunious American, not yet thirty years old, to a wealthy woman in her late sixties provoked much gossip casting doubt on the veracity of Bartlett's motives. Queen Victoria herself referred to &#145;the <i>mad</i> marriage&#146;  (Healey, 213) and tried to dissuade the baroness from plighting her troth. A Miss Shirley came forward and claimed that Bartlett had had an affair with her, but the baroness was not deflected. What Edith Wharton called in her novel <span class="italic">The Buccaneers</span> (1938) a &#145;feeling of affinity with this new band of marauders&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Buccaneers</span>, 103) renewed the baroness's philanthropic energies, and she gained much happiness from the marriage. Yet there can be little doubt that Bartlett gained most. Henceforth he assumed his wife's name by royal licence. In 1885 he was elected Unionist MP for Westminster. Acting on the baroness's behalf, he secured the passage of the <span class="roman">Hampstead Heath Act</span>, which added Parliament Hill and 300 acres to those areas granted public access. He was a competent back-bencher, who acted as his wife's political agent. But he also took part in reorganizing the City of Westminster under the <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span> of 1899.<br>
<br>That same year Burdett-Coutts travelled to South Africa as the <span class="italic">Times</span> correspondent concerned with inquiring into the conditions endured by the sick and wounded during the South African War, where his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56814/', "Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett")</script> was serving. His graphic account of their suffering spurred the setting up in 1900 of a royal commission of inquiry (chaired by Sir Robert Romer), which resulted in the reform of the Army Medical Services.<br>
<br>The baroness's fortune was reduced by three-fifths as a result of the legal action taken by her sister when she married an alien. Nevertheless, Burdett-Coutts did not manage his wife's financial affairs with acumen. Her wealth enabled him to pursue expensive hobbies, such as racing and horse breeding, and he founded the Brookfield stud; this went out of business in 1910. The baroness died in 1906, but Burdett-Coutts continued much of her charitable work. He helped found, and then served as treasurer of, the Great Northern Central Hospital; he was twice master of the Turners' Company, and was a governor of Christ's Hospital. Burdett-Coutts also busied himself with railway reform, contributing to the passage of the <span class="roman">Railway (Accounts and Returns) Act</span> of 1910. During the debates on parliamentary reform in 1917&#150;18 he founded the Anti-Proportional Representation Committee. At the 1918 general election he was elected unopposed for the Abbey Division of Westminster and was sworn of the privy council in April 1921, but died suddenly at his home, Holly Lodge, Highgate, Middlesex, on 28 July 1921. He was buried at Frant, Sussex.<br>
