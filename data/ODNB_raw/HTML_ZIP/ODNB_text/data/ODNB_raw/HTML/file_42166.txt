<span class="headword">Dennis,  George</span>  (1814&#150;1898), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, was born on 21 July 1814 in Ash Grove, Hackney, Middlesex, the fourth child of John Dennis (1779&#150;1864), an official in the Excise Office, and his wife, Mary Hull. In 1828 Dennis was sent to Charterhouse School, but in the following year his father took him away from school and put him to work in his own office as a clerk, and he received no further formal education. Feeling the urge to travel, he went on a walking tour of Scotland in 1834. In 1836 he sailed from London to Portugal and southern Spain. The result of this trip was his first book, <span class="italic">A Summer in Andalucia</span>, which was published anonymously by Richard Bentley and received favourable reviews. Dennis left home again in July 1839 and travelled to Switzerland, Milan, and Venice; he returned via Z&uuml;rich. In July 1840 he went to Paris and on to northern Spain, where he visited Madrid, Toledo, and Saragossa. In 1841 he decided to begin exploring ancient Etruria, and he left England in April 1842. His most constant travelling companion through Etruria was the artist Samuel Ainsley (<i>c</i>.1810&#150;1874). They made three tours together between June 1842 and July 1843, exploring Tarquinia and most of the other important Etruscan sites, as well as spending a considerable time in Rome. Ainsley made many other visits to Italy without Dennis, and held two exhibitions of his paintings at the Royal Academy. Dennis himself was also a competent artist of pencil drawings. In 1845 Dennis published a short book, <span class="italic">The Cid: a Short Chronicle, Founded on the Early Poetry of Spain</span>. More lengthy visits to Italy were carried out by Dennis between 1844, when he obtained the agreement of John Murray to publish his book, and 1848, when it at last appeared. <span class="italic">The Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria</span>, in two volumes, consisted of 114 plus 1085 pages of text, and gave the most detailed descriptions that had yet appeared in any language of all recorded Etruscan sites. It was heavily illustrated with Dennis's own drawings.<br>
<br>Dennis's humble post at the Excise Office having come to an end, he was interviewed by the Colonial Office and offered a position as private secretary to the governor of British Guiana, a part of the world which was destined to be most uncongenial to him. He sailed from England in January 1849 and was in Georgetown from the following month until the winter of 1862, though he made several return trips to Europe on leave. At some time during this period of his life he married a woman whose first name was Honoria or Nora: nothing more is known about her and there were no children. The only piece of writing from his pen concerning South America was a lecture given by him many years later, in 1892, entitled &#145;The Aborigines of South America and speculations on their origin&#146;.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1863 Dennis and his wife arrived in Sicily, his fourth visit to the island. He carried out archaeological research at Girgenti and Gela, and from then on he was hard at work on a <span class="italic">Handbook for Travellers in Sicily</span>, a book of over 500 pages published by Murray in 1864.<br>
<br>Dennis was then appointed vice-consul at Benghazi, where he arrived in February 1864. He hated the place, and his official duties there were uninteresting, but he made every effort to carry out at least some archaeological excavations in the neighbourhood, at Teucheira, Cyrene, and Ptolemais. In these he was in the main disappointed. He and his wife were able to leave Benghazi about the end of April 1868, having been transferred to Smyrna. In Turkey between 1868 and 1870 Dennis threw himself with renewed vigour into archaeological research, at Sardis, but he never produced a book on Turkey. As far as possible he worked for the British Museum, sending back consignments of terracotta figurines and other objects. He always enjoyed the support of Charles (later Sir Charles) Newton, keeper of Greek and Roman antiquities at the museum, but he frequently expressed his frustration at what he considered the lack of financial aid offered him by the trustees. In 1869 he was promoted consul for the island of Crete, but did not go there, and in 1870 he moved on to Palermo, a much happier posting. He resumed excavations in Sicily and Etruria, and in 1878, thirty years after its first appearance, a revised edition of <span class="italic">The Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria</span> was published, this time with a dedication to Sir Henry Layard, whom he had known since 1839, and to whom he often wrote asking for advice or assistance. Having been appointed to Smyrna as consul in June 1879, he arrived there with his wife in May 1880, and whenever possible worked at Sardis and Bin T&eacute;p&eacute;. From time to time on these sites he met and entertained the archaeologists Sir W. M. Ramsay (1851&#150;1939) and Professor A. H. Sayce (1845&#150;1933), both from Oxford, and the Frenchman Salomon Reinach (1858&#150;1932), with whom he exchanged many letters. In 1885, on a visit to England, Dennis received the honorary degree of doctor of civil law at Oxford, arranged for him by Sayce.<br>
<br>Mrs Dennis died in Smyrna on 1 April 1888, and Dennis officially retired a month later, being in the same year appointed CMG. His last, lonely years were spent between London and Rome, with visits to Spain and Tangier. In Rome he gave several lectures on his past experiences in various countries. He died on 15 November 1898, in South Kensington, and was buried in Hampstead cemetery. In 1888 there was a reissue of <span class="italic">The Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria</span>, and in 1907 the great work was again published by Dent in a cheap edition as part of <span class="roman">Everyman's Library</span>. The book has been translated into Italian, but so far only a few extracts from it have been published in that language.<br>
<br>Dennis's younger brother John Dennis (1825&#150;1911), with whom he kept on permanently good terms, was a prolific author and critic of English literature. Dennis had seven sisters, most of whom continued to write to him with family news during his long life spent mainly overseas.<br>
