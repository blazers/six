<span class="headword">Rumsey,  Henry Wyldbore</span>  (1809&#150;1876), <span class="occ">medical practitioner and writer on sanitary reform</span>, was born on 3 July 1809 in Chesham, Buckinghamshire, the eldest of five children of Henry Nathaniel Rumsey, surgeon, and his wife, Elizabeth Frances Catherine, daughter of Sir Robert Murray. Rumsey's early education was conducted by various tutors. At the age of sixteen he began formal medical studies with John Attenburrow at Nottingham Hospital. Rumsey completed his training at St George's Hospital, London, where he was a house pupil of the eminent surgeon Caesar Hawkins. He became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1831 and a fellow in 1844.<br>
<br>In 1831 Rumsey briefly worked as physician to Lord Dillon in Oxfordshire before returning to Chesham to take over his father's practice. There, in 1835, he married Frances Sophia Langston, who survived him. In 1838 Rumsey took up a practice in Gloucester, and also served as surgeon to the town dispensary. In 1851, partly to recover from a breakdown in his health brought on by his work as a cholera inspector, Rumsey moved to Cheltenham, where he built up a select practice.<br>
<br>Rumsey made his intellectual reputation, though not his fortune, through public health. His unique talent in sanitary reform was to grasp the need for rational organization at a time when old paternalist mechanisms for health care through charity and the old poor law had broken down and were being replaced by the ruthless efficiency of the new poor law, and while piecemeal public health legislation struggled to keep up with the problems posed by an industrial urban environment. His lifelong concerns were clearly expressed in his first sphere of interest, the provision of health care to the poor.<br>
<br>Rumsey was involved with a self-supporting dispensary&#151;a form of friendly society through which the poor could pay for medical services by small, regular subscriptions&#151;early in his career. His first publication, <span class="italic">Medical Relief for the Labouring Class on the Principle of Mutual Insurance</span> (1837), set out a model of best administrative practice for such institutions, which prevented patients or practitioners from abusing the system to acquire unnecessary care or inflated fees. In 1835 Rumsey became honorary secretary to the sick poor committee of the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association, one of the largest and most influential professional societies. In this post he gathered materials for a series of reports on medical relief for the poor which provided the basis for an unsuccessful bill for the better regulation of medical relief. By 1838 his expertise was such that he was called as a witness before the poor-law committee of the House of Commons. He also testified before the 1844 select committee on medical poor relief.<br>
<br>By the 1850s Rumsey's interest in health care provision had broadened to encompass comprehensive government control of medical services. He published widely on the subject, and his ideas were drawn together in his most famous work, his <span class="italic">Essays on State Medicine</span> (1856). Rumsey made unfavourable comparisons between the rational organization of state medicine in continental Europe, especially Germany and France, and the English lack of system which bred piecemeal and often ill thought out legislation and overlapping systems of government inspection, and gave substantial public health responsibilities to an unpopular autocratic lay poor-law board. Instead, Rumsey advocated that all medicine should be controlled through a central council of health, and operate through evenly sized districts rather than the existing patchwork of parish and civic authorities. The council would oversee the content and standards of medical education and determine the appropriate number of practitioners. It would supervise systematic medical care for the poor, funded through local taxes (a system partly modelled on the Irish dispensaries), and the application of comprehensive programmes of action against epidemics. Rumsey continued to criticize poor-law medical relief, arguing that medical care was in no way pauperizing, and should be made readily available. An address to the British Medical Association in 1867, later published as <span class="italic">On State Medicine in Great Britain and Ireland</span> (1867), succinctly reiterated his criticisms of the lack of system in public health and demanded a rational, national organization of trained state physicians to oversee the health care and the accurate registration of deaths&#151;the inadequacies of the system and the problems of basing policy on the statistics derived from this source became one of Rumsey's favourite topics in his later years. This paper inspired the formation of a joint committee of the British Medical Association and the Social Science Association to call for a reorganization of sanitary administration. Rumsey was duly appointed to the resulting royal sanitary commission in 1868.<br>
<br>Rumsey's work brought him considerable recognition in his own lifetime. Obituarists ranked his skills in sanitary theory as second only to those of John Simon and William Farr. In 1863 Rumsey was nominated a member of the General Medical Council, in 1867 he received an honorary MD from Trinity College, Dublin, and in 1874 he was elected to the Royal Society. Rumsey was also an honorary member of the Metropolitan Association of Health Officers and a fellow of the Royal Medico-Chirurgical Society. Towards the end of his life Rumsey got into financial difficulties; these were eased in 1875 by a testimonial fund, chaired by William Farr, which raised over &pound;1000 and obtained a civil-list pension of &pound;100 per annum. By this time Rumsey was too ill to receive the grant in person. He suffered a stroke in January 1875 and died on 23 October 1876, at 1 Tatchley Villas, Prestbury, near Cheltenham.<br>
