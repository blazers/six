<span class="headword">Arthur,  Archibald</span>  (1744&#150;1797), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and university teacher</span>, was born on 6 September 1744 at Abbot's Inch, Renfrewshire, the eldest son of the farmer Andrew Arthur and his wife, Jean Snodgrass. After being taught at home by his parents, he attended Paisley grammar school, and matriculated at Glasgow University in 1758. Encouraged by the humanist George Muirhead and the professor of Greek, James Moor, he flourished at the college. He won a prize for his essay &#145;On the importance of natural philosophy&#146;, which was deeply indebted to the ideas of his moral philosophy professor, Adam Smith. Having graduated MA in 1763, he studied divinity at Glasgow, and supported himself by finding employment as a family tutor near Paisley.<br>
<br>Arthur was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Paisley on 6 October 1767, apparently despite questions about his orthodoxy raised by a phalanx of local evangelicals, led by John Witherspoon, who were probably suspicious of his affiliations with liberal clergymen and his advocacy of greater tolerance within the kirk. He soon returned to the more congenial atmosphere of academe when he was appointed a chaplain at Glasgow University, and his ties with the moderate clergy in Glasgow were strengthened when he was chosen to assist Principal William Leechman's close associate William Craig, the minister of St Andrew's Church. Arthur again supplemented his limited income by serving as a family tutor in Kintyre and Glasgow, but his finances improved when he was appointed university librarian on 10 June 1774. His position (from which he eventually resigned on 28 October 1794) was renewed by the town council on 25 October 1775, six days after he was made a burgess and guild brother.<br>
<br>About the time he first became librarian, Arthur joined the Glasgow Literary Society. The university library catalogue that Arthur published in 1791 (modelled on Thomas Ruddiman's catalogue of the Advocates' Library in Edinburgh) had its distant origins in a meeting of the society on 4 April 1777, and three of his early discourses from the society on religion, language, and the historical development of the fine arts, appeared in the anonymous collection <span class="italic">Original Essays and Translations</span> (1780), edited by the minister of Kinfauns, George Chapman. During the 1770s Arthur was also active in a club frequented by divinity students and ministers. Essays on natural religion, aesthetics, and the study of the classics read before the two societies were later included in his posthumous <span class="italic">Discourses on Theological and Literary Subjects</span> (1803), which was assembled at the request of his surviving siblings by his friend and colleague the professor of the humanity class, William Richardson. Outside Glasgow, Arthur was elected a fellow of the newly founded Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783.<br>
<br>On 18 May 1780 Arthur was elected assistant and successor to the professor of moral philosophy, Thomas Reid, who had nominated him as his replacement. Arthur had impressed Reid with his ability as a preacher, and had made his mark as a substitute lecturer in botany, logic, and the humanity class. Moreover, he shared Reid's taste for the natural sciences and the anatomy of the mind. Over the next sixteen years Arthur taught for Reid, though he served only one session as professor after Reid's death in 1796. His public classes, which owed much to Reid and Smith, covered three main areas: natural theology, ethics, and a combination of natural jurisprudence and politics. Like Reid, Arthur was consistently critical of the writings of David Hume in his lectures, but showed more independence in his private class, where he concentrated on aesthetics and <i>belles-lettres</i>. After a sharp decline in health during the spring of 1797, Arthur died in Glasgow on 14 June, a bachelor and reputedly wealthy.<br>
