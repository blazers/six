<span class="headword">Lockwood, Sir  Joseph Flawith</span>  (1904&#150;1991), <span class="occ">businessman</span>, was born on 14 November 1904 in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, one of the four sons of Joseph Agnew Lockwood (1883/4&#150;1910/11), miller, and his wife, Mabel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Caudwell, the daughter of his employer, the fifth generation in a long line of millers. He was educated at Newark grammar school and left in 1920 to train at his grandfather's mill, but as his two older cousins were in line to run the business he went to Chile in 1924 and became manager of a flour mill in Santiago. He returned to England in 1928 and joined Henry Simon Ltd, a company which designed and built mills, in Manchester. As technical manager of the company's operations in Brussels and Paris he worked there until 1933, when he was appointed a director. He was also made a director of Henry Simon Ltd in Buenos Aires, and chairman of the Australian subsidiary, Henry Simon (Australia) Ltd. As a result of a visit he made to Minneapolis, Henry Simon Ltd won a contract to modernize a number of mills in the United States and Canada. Just before the war Lockwood published <span class="italic">Provender Milling&#151;the Manufacture of Feeding Stuffs for Livestock</span> (1939).<br>
<br>During the war Lockwood was in charge of the protection of factories, warehouses, docks, and other key installations in the north-west civil defence region, under the regional commissioner Hartley Shawcross, and from 1944 he was part of a working party planning food supplies for Europe after the war. As a civilian officer attached to the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force from 1944 to 1945, Lockwood was in charge of the rehabilitation of flour mills that had been damaged during the war, and the transport of wheat in liberated Europe. He returned to Henry Simon Ltd in 1945 and was appointed chairman and managing director in 1950. He published <span class="italic">Flour Milling</span> (1945), which became a standard text, with four editions by 1960 and in several languages. While still at Henry Simon Ltd he was appointed a director of the National Research Development Corporation (1951&#150;67).<br>
<br>Lockwood left Henry Simon Ltd and the milling business in 1954 to become chairman of EMI (Electrical and Musical Industries Ltd), the gramophone company formed in 1931 with the merger of HMV, Columbia, and Parlophone. EMI had been losing &pound;0.5 million a year, in part because of a decision by the board, led by the chairman, Sir Ernest Fisk, in 1952, not to develop the long-playing record, pioneered in the United States by CBS and first made by Decca in 1950. The directors were happy with the existing 78 r.p.m. records, with a maximum playing time of 4 min. 45 sec. per side, believing that no one would want to endure the tedium of a long-playing record. They were also worried about the capital expenditure that would be involved. One of the first things Lockwood did at EMI, realizing that there was a future in long-playing records, was to reverse this decision. EMI already had a good reputation for classical music recording, thanks to Walter Legge, producer of classical music at Columbia, who had brought in such internationally famous musicians as Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau (from 1951 to 1960) and Herbert von Karajan (from 1946 to 1959). Lockwood was the first to try to persuade Legge that this was not enough, and that the classical music side must also be commercially viable. He realized that the company must also expand its popular music department in order to succeed, and he appointed George Martin, a popular music producer at Parlophone since 1950, as head of the Parlophone label in 1955. At the EMI recording studios in Abbey Road, St John's Wood, London, Martin brought in popular artists including Ruby Murray, Dickie Valentine, and the trumpeter Eddie Calvert, whose &#145;Oh mein Papa&#146; in 1954 was the first EMI single to top the charts after twenty-three years of making records.<br>
<br>Lockwood was very much involved with the Abbey Road studios in his early days at EMI, though he was unpopular at first because of his ruthlessness. Realizing the importance of the American market, in 1955 he bought Capitol records, a small American company, which went on to record Frank Sinatra and to become the largest music company in the United States in the 1960s. Although his own preference was for classical music, especially Mozart, Lockwood encouraged the Beatles, signed up by George Martin in 1962; that decade they became the leading recording group in the world. In 1963, as &#145;Beatlemania&#146; swept Britain, Lockwood entertained the Beatles to lunch at the EMI headquarters in Manchester Square in central London. He gave them an increasingly free hand, while they always respected him, affectionately calling him &#145;Sir Joe&#146;. &#145;She Loves You&#146; (1963) became the first single to exceed sales of 1.5 million in the United Kingdom, and in one week in 1964 the Beatles held the top five positions in the hit parade. By 1966 they had earned eleven gold LPs. The government realized their importance for Britain's balance of payments, and created them MBEs in 1965.<br>
<br>Despite the value of the Beatles to EMI, records were only part of the company's operations, and it was less successful in other fields. Although it had been in the forefront of developing television sets, it relinquished making HMV televisions to Thorn, and in the early 1970s EMI made a large loss in marketing the CAT (computerized axial tomography) body-scanner it had developed for use in hospitals. Lockwood retired as chairman of EMI in 1974, but remained as a non-executive director until 1979. The company was taken over by Thorn in 1980, becoming Thorn-EMI.<br>
<br>Lockwood served on several public bodies, including the Engineering Advisory Council of the Board of Trade in 1959, the Export Council for Europe from 1961 to 1963, the Export Credits Guarantee Advisory Council from 1963 to 1967, and the Industrial Reorganization Corporation from 1966 to 1971 (as chairman from 1969 to 1971). He was knighted in 1960. A director of several large engineering companies, including the Hawker Siddeley Group, Smiths Industries Ltd, and the Laird Group, he was also involved in racecourse management as a director of Sandown Park Ltd, United Racecourses Ltd, and Epsom Grandstand Association from 1969 to 1983.<br>
<br>Lockwood's great passions were ballet and the theatre, and as chairman of the Royal Ballet from 1971 to 1985 and a member of the South Bank Theatre Board from 1968 to 1984 (chairman, 1977&#150;84), he was very influential, especially in the building of the National Theatre, which opened on the South Bank in 1976. He was also chairman of the governors of the Royal Ballet School from 1960 to 1977, chairman of the Central School of Speech and Drama from 1965 to 1968, chairman of the Young Vic Theatre Company from 1974 to 1975, and a member of the Arts Council from 1967 to 1970. As with the recording activities at EMI, Lockwood took a detailed interest in all the activities with which he was involved, visiting the institutions, attending performances, and talking to performers and students. In addition, as treasurer of the Cancer Research Campaign from 1962 to 1967, he helped to build up a &pound;1 million reserve fund, enabling the campaign to guarantee scientists continuous funding for at least three years, instead of the previous one-year funding. He died at his home, Hatchet Wood Farm, Skirmett, Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, on 6 March 1991. He was unmarried.<br>
