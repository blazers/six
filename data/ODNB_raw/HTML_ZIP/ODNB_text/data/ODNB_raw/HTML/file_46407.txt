<span class="headword">Cox, Sir  Richard</span>, first baronet  (1650&#150;1733), <span class="occ">lord chancellor of Ireland and author</span>, was born at Bandon, co. Cork, on 25 March 1650, the only child of Captain Richard Cox (<i>d</i>. 1651), an officer in the royalist army during the confederate wars, and his wife, Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1652), daughter of the recorder of Clonakilty, Walter Bird, and formerly wife of Captain Thomas Batten. Although his grandfather Michael Cox (<i>d</i>. 1659) had owned substantial property near Kilworth, co. Cork, the family estate was much reduced by the rebellion of 1641 and subsequent warfare. The younger Richard Cox inherited from his grandfather &#145;an interest&#146; near Kilworth, which he sold for &pound;150; following the Restoration he received land in Galway worth &pound;26 per annum in settlement of his father's arrears of army pay. He was brought up by his grandfather Michael Cox, and later by his uncle John Bird, attending a school at Bandon and then that kept by Thomas Barry at Clonakilty. After leaving school at fifteen he &#145;spent three years idly&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 9) before beginning to practise as an attorney in the manor courts of the earl of Burlington and Cork, where his uncle was a seneschal. In September 1671 he travelled to London with the earl of Burlington and Cork and entered Gray's Inn, where he was called to the bar on 9 August 1673. After returning to Ireland he spent seven years living quietly at Clonakilty before, by his own account, I &#145;roused myself from that lethargy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 11) and moved to Cork city to develop his legal practice. He was elected recorder of Kinsale in 1680, built up a profitable practice, and bought land. In 1685 he wrote an optimistic account of conditions in co. Cork for the proposed volume of topographical surveys organized by William Molyneux, celebrating the pacification of the region and its social and economic progress.<br>
<br>In April 1687 Cox fled the Catholic dominated Ireland of Tyrconnell, where he claimed to be in danger on account of a charge he had given as chairman of the quarter sessions at Bandon in April 1679, upholding the claim of a popish plot. He settled at Bristol, where he practised law and completed his <span class="italic">Hibernia Anglicana, or, The history of Ireland from the conquest thereof by the English to this present time</span>. This appeared in two parts, in 1689 and 1690, the first part dedicated to William and Mary, the second to William. He was the probable anonymous author of <span class="italic">Aphorisms Relating to the Kingdom of Ireland</span> of January 1689, comprising twenty-eight propositions addressed to members of the convention in England and arguing the case for immediate and substantial military intervention. When Sir Robert Southwell, whom he had come to know at Bristol, was appointed King William's secretary of state, Cox accompanied him to Ireland as one of his secretaries. He was appointed recorder of Waterford and on 15 September 1690 was sworn in as second justice of the common pleas. On 1 May 1691 he was appointed governor of the county and city of Cork. In the months that followed he presided over a brutal local war, using a greatly expanded local militia to defend an 80 mile frontier and suppress Jacobite irregulars operating within his territory. By his own account his men &#145;killed and hanged not less than 3,000 of them&#146;  (TCD, MS 1180, p. 159, Cox to &#151;, 8 Oct 1691). Following the end of the war Cox was admitted to the privy council on 13 April 1692 and knighted on 5 November.<br>
<br>On 10 February 1694 Cox became one of the commissioners for the administration of forfeited lands. In June 1695 he was removed from the privy council, according to himself because of his anticipated opposition to the proposed enactment of a toleration bill for protestant dissenters. He became chief justice of the common pleas on 16 May 1701 and was restored to the privy council a few days later. In the intensifying party rivalry of Queen Anne's reign he emerged as a leading tory. Having initially sought the patronage of the Boyle family he now became closely associated with the second duke of Ormond, becoming one of the trustees for his estate. He travelled to London in April 1703 for consultations about the forthcoming meeting of parliament, returned to Ireland with Ormond, and was sworn in as lord chancellor on 6 August. He served as lord justice 1705&#150;7 and was created a baronet on 21 November 1706. When the other lord justice, Baron Cutts, died in January 1707 Cox risked impeachment by refusing to issue writs for the election by the privy council of a new chief governor on the grounds that this would have conflicted with Ormond's patent as viceroy.<br>
<br>When Ormond was replaced by the earl of Pembroke in June 1707 Cox was removed from the lord chancellorship as one of a series of dismissals intended to facilitate the admission to office of some of the former whig opposition. He returned to office under the next tory ministry, but in the lesser position of chief justice of the queen's bench (5 July 1711). Following the accession of George I he was again removed, in September 1714, and was subsequently censured by the House of Commons for his role in two political trials: the proceedings against Dudley Moore, who had defiantly delivered a suppressed eulogy of William III during a theatrical performance, and against the corporation of Dublin, which had refused to accept a tory mayor. He spent the rest of his life in retirement on his property at Dunmanway.<br>
<br>Cox was an unwavering supporter of the revolution of 1688. <span class="italic">Hibernia Anglicana</span> dismissed as groundless the distinction between <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto</i> monarchy. Later he unhesitatingly supported the Hanoverian succession. However, he derided the notion of &#145;Revolution principles&#146; and described himself as &#145;an anti-Whig. I hate their canting, lying and hypocrisy and I know too many of them aim at mutiny and schism&#146;  (Cox to Edward Southwell, 13 Aug 1714, BL, Add. MS 38157, fol. 108). In the same way he saw Catholics as irreconcilable opponents of the English and protestant interest in Ireland, while at the same time refusing to overstate the threat they posed. He believed that former Jacobites were entitled to the concessions agreed in the treaty of Limerick, and complained that the willingness of the forfeiture commissioners to do common justice was misrepresented as partiality. Later, in the tense summer of 1714, he refused to join in the general panic over the activities of French recruiting agents. He was also firmly hostile to dissent. In 1695 he opposed a toleration bill for protestant dissenters &#145;by saying I was content every man should have liberty &#147;of going to heaven&#148;, but I desired nobody might have liberty of coming into government, but those who would conform to it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 15). Later he condemned whig attempts to promote the repeal of the sacramental test by talking up the Catholic threat, where in fact &#145;five in six of the Irish are poor insignificant slaves, fit for nothing but to hew wood and draw water&#146;, insisting at the same time that dissenters could never be admitted to power, &#145;because assuredly if they were in, they would put us out&#146;  (Cox to Southwell, 24 Oct 1706, BL, Add. MS 38154, fol. 86).<br>
<br>The other great tenet of Cox's political life was his commitment to the English interest in Ireland. His <span class="italic">Some thoughts on the bill &hellip; for prohibiting the exportation of the woollen manufactures of Ireland to foreign parts</span> (1698), addressed to the House of Lords, argued that the proposed legislation would damage England itself, as well as Irish protestants, who were &#145;Englishmen sent over to conquer Ireland, your countrymen, your brothers, your sons, your relations, your acquaintance&#146;  (17). In 1714 he referred to plans, apparently never realized, to write a reply to William Molyneux's statement of Irish constitutional rights. He was also prepared to make some distinction between Catholics of English and of Irish descent. His contribution to Irish history, <span class="italic">Hibernia Anglicana</span>, is generally dismissed as a hasty compilation. It depicts pre-conquest Ireland as a violent and underdeveloped society, and traces the history of succeeding centuries in terms of the opposition between English government and Irish barbarism and treachery, complicated from the sixteenth century by the conflict between popery and protestantism. However he did not dismiss the native Irish as racially inferior. His <span class="italic">An Essay for the Conversion of the Irish</span> (1698) argues that the Gaelic Irish were in fact of the same ethnic origin as the people of Great Britain, and offers an optimistic account of the virtues they might display once liberated from popery. The allegation that he had the Gaelic poet Hugh MacCurtin imprisoned for having criticized <span class="italic">Hibernia Anglicana</span> appears to have originated, in 1749, with Charles Lucas, then engaged in controversy with Cox's grandson, and is most probably unfounded.<br>
<br>Cox married Mary Bourne (<i>c</i>.1658&#150;1715), the daughter of John Bourne, a minor landowner in co. Cork, on 26 February 1674. She died on 1 June 1715. Cox died at Dunmanway on 3 May 1733, following a fit of apoplexy some months earlier, and was buried there. In 1699 he had noted the birth of his twenty-first child. On his death, however, his successor was his grandson <a name="cosubject_46407"></a><span class="headword">Sir Richard Cox</span>, second baronet  (1702&#150;1766)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 23 November 1702, the son of Cox's eldest son, Richard (<i>c</i>.1678&#150;1725), MP for Tallow (1703&#150;15) and Clonakilty (1717&#150;25), and Susanna French (<i>d</i>. 1716). Cox matriculated at Oxford on 4 May 1720. As MP for Clonakilty (1727&#150;66) he opposed the government in 1737 but subsequently took a leading part in the proceedings against Charles Lucas, for which he was rewarded in 1750 with the collectorship of customs for Cork. He was one of Henry Boyle's strongest supporters during the money bill dispute of 1753&#150;6, and one of the last of the party to be reconciled with the castle. However his appointment in 1758 to a seat on the Irish revenue board confirmed his return to full favour.<br>
<br>Cox was an improving landlord, praised for promoting the manufacture of linen round Dunmanway. He published several works on economic development, including <span class="italic">A letter from Sir Richard Cox to Thomas Prior, esquire, showing from experience a sure method to establish the linen manufacture</span> (1749). Using the pseudonym Anthony Litten he also wrote a series of pamphlets attacking Lucas under the title <span class="italic">The Cork Surgeon's Antidote Against the Dublin Apothecary's Poison</span> (1749). Though mainly concerned to defend the existing Anglo-Irish connection as beneficial to both kingdoms, and to attack Lucas as an irresponsible rabble-rouser, these included an effective critique of Lucas's autodidactic obsession with ancient grants and charters, arguing that texts and precedents from the remote past must be read in their historical context. Cox married Catherine Evans, daughter of a co. Limerick landowner, on 13 September 1725, and died in February 1766.<br>
