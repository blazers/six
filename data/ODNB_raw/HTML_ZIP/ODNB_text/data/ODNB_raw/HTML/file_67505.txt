<span class="headword">Campbell,  Alexander, of Fonab and Monzie</span>  (<em>c.</em>1660&#150;1724), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born in Perthshire, was the second but eldest surviving son of Robert Campbell, minister of Moulin, who had bought the Fonab estate, and his wife, Jean, second daughter of Duncan Menzies of Weem. His grandfather was Archibald Campbell of Lagvinshoch and Monzie, son of Sir Duncan Campbell of Glenorchy, a powerful member of the clan Campbell &eacute;lite. There is no record of his early life or education but we know from his tombstone at Edinample (no longer extant) that he was in Belgium in 1690 as a member of the earl of Argyll's regiment of foot. In 1693 he is recorded as receiving a commission as captain in the same regiment, and is known to have been in Flanders in 1695, and in Holland in 1697, before being reduced to half pay the following year.<br>
<br>Some time between 1692 and 1699, having inherited his father's estate, Alexander Campbell, known as Fonab, married his cousin Susan Menzies of Weem, widow of Lord Neil Campbell of Ardmaddie, with whom he had a daughter, Jean. It was at this period in his life that he established himself as a hero in a time of national outrage and humiliation. In October 1699 he was appointed a counsellor of the Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies&#151;a company which Scots investors hoped would challenge the English trade monopoly and revive the depressed Scottish economy by establishing Scotland's own trading colony in the Americas. He immediately proceeded to New Caledonia, Panama, to help establish the second expedition by defending it against Spanish attack. Arriving in New Caledonia on 2 February 1700, and hearing of the proposed Spanish attack on the colony by both land and sea, three days later, Fonab, along with Lieutenant Robert Turnbull, 200 Scotsmen, and sixty native Indians marched through almost impenetrable forests, jungle, and swamps to confront the Spaniards at Toubacanti. Although greatly outnumbered, and despite being wounded in the shoulder, Fonab led the Scots to victory thanks to his leadership and courage. Notwithstanding this moment of glory, misfortune continued to dog the colonists, and New Caledonia was shortly afterwards abandoned by the Scots. Fonab returned to Scotland in July 1700 where he was honoured as a national hero. The Company of Scotland commissioned a gold medal to be struck for him with the company's arms on the obverse, and a classical figure leading an attack upon the Spanish stockade on the reverse. In addition, his coat of arms was overlaid by that of the Company of Scotland, the only person to receive this distinction.<br>
<br>Fonab continued his career as a soldier. He was appointed captain of an independent company of foot for preserving the peace in the highlands in July 1701. He was a commissioner of supply in 1702 and 1704, and one of the duke of Argyll's five dependants who managed his estates in Scotland. He was appointed a brevet lieutenant-colonel in 1703. At the time of the Jacobite rising of 1715 Fonab is listed as a freeholder and heritor of Argyll; as a protestant and a member of the clan Campbell, he fought on the government side to support the Hanoverian succession. His dislike of fighting fellow Scots and neighbouring clansmen led to his part in the 'Fifteen being misconstrued by the earl of Ilay as displaying conflicting loyalties.<br>
<br>On 1 March 1719, his first wife having died, Fonab married Mary Home, daughter of Sir John Home of Blackadder, and with her had three children. He died on 16 September 1724 and was buried at Kilmun, Argyll. His son and heir by his second marriage, Robert, later removed Fonab's remains to Edinample on Loch Earn, Perthshire, where he erected a tombstone; his widow was still living in 1739.<br>
