<span class="headword">Digby,  Robert</span>  (1732&#150;1814), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 20 December 1732, the son of Edward Digby (<i>c</i>.1693&#150;1746), MP for Warwickshire, and Charlotte, daughter of Sir Stephen Fox and sister of Stephen, first earl of Ilchester, and Henry, first Baron Holland. Robert's grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7634/', "William Digby, fifth Baron Digby of Geashill")</script>, and his elder brother was Henry, first Earl Digby. Robert Digby first went to sea in 1744 in the <i>Edinburgh</i> (74 guns), and was promoted lieutenant in October 1752. On 5 August 1755 he was promoted captain of the frigate <i>Solebay</i> and in the following year he was advanced to command the <i>Dunkirk</i> (60 guns), in which he continued until the peace, serving for the most part on the home station, and being present in the abortive expedition against Rochefort in 1757. In 1758 he took part in the successful attack by Commodore Augustus Keppel on Goree and in 1759 in Sir Edward Hawke's victory in Quiberon Bay. In 1760 he was ordered to join the Mediterranean Fleet and served under Captain Hugh Palliser in the pursuit of the Toulon fleet. Following the treaty of Paris in 1762 he retired from active service, though he was appointed colonel of marines on 4 April 1775.<br>
<br>In 1778, with the outbreak of war, Digby was appointed to the <i>Ramillies</i> (74 guns), which he commanded in the indecisive battle of Ushant (27 July 1778) under the immediate command of his friend Palliser (now an admiral). This led to his being summoned by Palliser as a witness for the prosecution at Keppel's court martial. However, Digby's evidence tended distinctly to Keppel's advantage, as indicated in Edmund Burke's letter to Frances Pelham of 12 January 1779  (<span class="italic">The Correspondence of Edmund Burke</span>, vol. 4, 1778&#150;82, ed. J. A. Woods, 1963, 37).<br>
<br>Upon promotion to rear-admiral of the blue (19 March 1779), Digby was ordered at once to hoist his flag on the <i>Prince George</i>, so that he might&#151;as was affirmed by the opposition&#151;sit on Palliser's court martial. During the summer of 1779 he was second in command of the Channel Fleet under Sir Charles Hardy, and in December he was second in command of the fleet which sailed under Sir George Rodney for the relief of Gibraltar. It was at this time that he was first appointed the governor of Prince William Henry, who began his naval career on the <i>Prince George</i>. Digby had previously received warm praise from George III, who in November 1778 described him as &#145;a most excellent officer, sensible, prudent, and discreet&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. Fortescue, 4.225). When, after relieving Gibraltar, Rodney, with one division of the fleet, went on to the West Indies, Digby, with the other, returned to England, having the good fortune on the way to disperse a French convoy laden with military stores for the &Icirc;le de France. Three merchant ships and the <i>Proth&eacute;e</i> (64 guns) were captured. After being advanced to rear-admiral of the red he continued as second in command of the Channel Fleet during the summers of 1780 and 1781, and in the second relief of Gibraltar by Vice-Admiral George Darby. In August 1781 Digby was sent as commander-in-chief to North America. He arrived just as his predecessor, Thomas, Lord Graves, was preparing to sail for the Chesapeake in hopes, in a second attempt, of effecting the relief of Cornwallis; and, courteously refusing to take on himself the command at this critical juncture, Digby remained at New York while Graves sailed on his vain errand. Afterwards, when he had assumed the command, he removed into the <i>Lion</i>, a smaller ship, in order to allow the <i>Prince George</i>, as well as most of his other ships, to accompany Sir Samuel Hood to the West Indies. The tide of the war rolled away from North America, and in any case Digby had no force to undertake any active operations. His command was therefore uneventful, and he returned home at the peace in 1783. He held no further appointment, though duly promoted vice-admiral four years later and admiral in 1794, and living to see the end of the French Revolutionary Wars.<br>
<br>Digby married in 1784 Mrs Jauncy, the daughter of Andrew Elliot, brother of Sir Gilbert Elliot, third baronet, and Admiral John Elliot. Digby died on 25 February 1814; his wife died on 28 July 1830, leaving no children.<br>
