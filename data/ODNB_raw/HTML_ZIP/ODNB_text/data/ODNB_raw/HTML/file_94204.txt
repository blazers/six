<span class="headword">Kydd,  Frances Ruth Burke  Shand</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Frances Ruth Roche; <em>other married name </em>Frances Ruth Spencer]</span>  (1936&#150;2004), <span class="occ">voluntary worker</span>, was born on 20 January 1936 at Park House, Sandringham, Norfolk, the second of two daughters of (Edmund) Maurice Burke Roche, fourth Baron Fermoy (1885&#150;1955), and his wife, Ruth Sylvia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gill (1908&#150;1993), the youngest daughter of Colonel William Smith Gill of Bildside, Aderdeenshire. Her first encounter with royal life occurred before she was born, when Queen Mary deflected her own anxiety and impending grief by enquiring about &#145;Ruth Fermoy's baby&#146;; her birth coincided exactly with the death of George V, in the &#145;big house&#146; at Sandringham. The Fermoys enjoyed living in the King's Lynn area because of its proximity to the royal family. Many years later, in 1960, Ruth Fermoy became a lady-in-waiting to the queen mother. Frances had a brother, later fifth Baron Fermoy, who committed suicide in 1984, and an elder sister, Mary, who married three times, her first husband being Sir Anthony Berry, who was assassinated in the IRA's bombing of the Grand Hotel, Brighton, in 1984 (some years after their divorce).<br>
<br>Frances Roche was educated at Downham School, Hertfordshire, and emerged as a confident seventeen-year-old, &#145;forcible, dynamic, energetic and very intelligent&#146;, as one friend put it  (private information). The queen mother attended her coming-out ball in 1953, and soon Frances was engaged to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51325/', "(Edward) John Spencer, Viscount Althorp (1924&#150;1992)")</script>, heir to the seventh Earl Spencer. He served as acting master of the household on the queen's Commonwealth tour of 1953&#150;4, during which Frances undertook finishing courses in Florence and Paris. On 1 June 1954, at Westminster Abbey, Frances and Althorp were married. The royal family attended in force, led by the queen and Prince Philip, the queen mother, and Princess Margaret. After the death of Frances's father in 1955 the Althorps settled at Park House, Sandringham, their lifestyle supported by Frances's American inheritance (her paternal grandmother was the New York heiress Frances Work). They had two daughters, Sarah (<i>b</i>. 1955) and Jane (<i>b</i>. 1957), a son (born and died the same day in 1960), a third daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68348/', "Diana")</script>, in 1961, and then the eventual heir, Charles (later ninth Earl Spencer) in 1964.<br>
<br>For some years the Althorps enjoyed a happy family life, Frances helping the local branch of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and the parochial church council. Connections with the royal family remained strong. Relations with Althorp's father were poor, but Cynthia, Countess Spencer, another lady-in-waiting to the queen mother, liked to visit her grandchildren when in waiting at Sandringham. The tragedy of these years was the loss of the hoped-for heir in 1960. He was buried in the churchyard at Sandringham.<br>
<br>In 1966 Frances met Peter Shand Kydd (<i>d</i>. 2006), a farmer, son of Norman Shand Kydd, and heir to a wallpaper fortune, at a dinner party. In the following year she eloped with him, taking Diana and Charles with her, until their father insisted on having custody of them. Shand Kydd's wife cited her in a divorce action in June 1968 and, in December, Frances lost a case for legal custody of her children, Althorp's side being supported by the children's headmistress and Frances's own mother, on account of Lady Fermoy's wish to dissociate herself in royal circles from the disgrace her daughter was bringing upon herself. Frances's own divorce case was heard in April 1969; she accused Althorp of cruelty and he cited her adultery. She was allowed access to her children, but they continued to live with their father, while Frances was branded a &#145;bolter&#146;. On 2 May 1969 she married Shand Kydd and they moved to the Sussex coast, living as privately as possible. Then in 1972 they settled on a farm on the island of Seil in Argyll, breeding Shetland ponies and running a gift shop in Oban. The Shand Kydds also owned a 1000 acre sheep station in New South Wales, Australia.<br>
<br>All this might have remained private but for the marriage between Frances's daughter Lady Diana Spencer and the prince of Wales in 1981. During the courtship she made a public plea that the press would not harass her daughter, in a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, on 2 December 1980. She sought to put &#145;truth and reality&#146; into the newspaper reports, she said, confirming that Diana had not had an assignation with Prince Charles on the royal train. With some prescience she wrote:<blockquote>May I ask the editors of Fleet Street whether, in the execution of their jobs, they consider it necessary or fair to harass my daughter daily, from dawn until well after dusk? Is it fair to ask any human being, regardless of circumstances, to be treated in this way?</blockquote>No heed was taken of these words, however, and press interest grew after the engagement in February 1981 and the wedding at St Paul's Cathedral in July, after which Frances accompanied the duke of Edinburgh in the carriage procession back to Buckingham Palace.<br>
<br>Any joy Frances Shand Kydd experienced at the birth of her two grandchildren, princes William and Harry, was paid for in full by the suffering imposed on her as their parents' marriage disintegrated. Media intrusion and strained relations with her daughter caused her considerable unhappiness, her strength of character being further tested when Peter Shand Kydd left her in 1988; the couple were subsequently divorced. In later life she was active in a number of local charities and causes including the Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival, and the Mission for Deep Sea Fishermen (Scotland). She was a counsellor for the bereavement counselling charity CRUSE from 1996.<br>
<br>In 1994, two years after the Waleses separated, Frances sought solace in the Roman Catholic church. In 1997, in order to raise money for a prayer house on Iona, she gave an interview to <span class="italic">Hello</span> magazine in which, inevitably, she expressed her opinions about Diana's marriage and her daughter's lack of wisdom in giving an interview to BBC television's <span class="italic">Panorama</span> programme in 1995. As a result of this there was no further communication between her and Diana, and they remained estranged at the time of Diana's death in August 1997. The last occasions on which Frances impinged on the public conscience were her dignified attendance at Diana's funeral, and then, in the autumn of 2002, when she gave evidence in the trial of Paul Burrell (Diana's butler, accused of the theft of her belongings) in London. By this time her health had declined and she appeared a frail, elderly woman. She was generally respected for her kindness and ultimately the unfortunate role into which she had been propelled. She died of pneumonia at Callanish, Clachan Seil, near Oban on 3 June 2004. She was survived by her three remaining children. Her funeral took place at St Colomba's Cathedral, Oban, on 10 June and she was buried in the nearby Pennyfuir cemetery.<br>
