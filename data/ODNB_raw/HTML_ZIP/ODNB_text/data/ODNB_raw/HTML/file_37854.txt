<span class="headword">Pilcher,  Percy Sinclair</span>  (1867&#150;1899), <span class="occ">aeronautical engineer</span>, was born in Bath on 16 January 1867, the youngest in the family of three sons and two daughters of Thomas Webb Pilcher (1799&#150;1874), formerly curator of the British Museum picture gallery in Rome, and his second wife, Sophia Robinson, a very young and energetic Scottish lady. In 1874 Pilcher's father died, leaving less than &pound;600. Sophia took her four surviving children (one son had died in childhood) to Celle, near Hanover in Germany, where she died in 1877. Thomas David Pilcher, the head of the family at nineteen, brought his sisters and brother back to England and sent them to school. In 1880 Percy entered the Royal Navy as a cadet. In 1887 he resigned at his own request to go to Glasgow to begin an apprenticeship in the engineering department of Randolph, Elder, shipbuilders, of Govan. For a short time in 1890 he attended classes at University College, London, as an unmatriculated student. In the same year he published <span class="italic">Gliding</span>, which was reprinted as number 5 of the <span class="roman">Aeronautical Classics</span> in 1910. He then worked for eighteen months in the Southampton naval works before returning to Glasgow late in 1891 as an assistant lecturer in naval architecture and marine engineering at the university, and it was soon after this that his intensive study of the design of birdlike gliders began.<br>
<br>In 1895 Pilcher began to build his first full size glider, the <i>Bat</i>; the wings were at a pronounced angle to the horizontal and it was fitted with a rudder but no tailplane. In April 1895 he discussed the construction of the <i>Bat</i> with Otto Lilienthal, the German hang-gliding pioneer, and learned a great deal about the practical problems of controlling hang-gliders in the air. Pilcher's first trials with the <i>Bat</i> in the summer of 1895 showed that Lilienthal had been right to insist that a horizontal tail surface was essential, and after modifications Pilcher succeeded in making a number of short downhill glides, but the angle of the wings was still too great for lateral stability. The goal for which he was striving was clearly shown in his remarkable patent of 1896, which described the world's first practical design for a powered aeroplane developed from gliders which had actually flown.<br>
<br>In the winter of 1895&#150;6 Pilcher built the <i>Hawk</i>, equipped with the world's first sprung-wheeled undercarriage, in which, often with the assistance of a towed take-off, he made many flights including his record glide of some 750 feet on 20 June 1897. By 1899 he had completed and tested a 4 hp engine weighing only 40 lb and had built a triplane in which to mount it. At a demonstration on 30 September 1899, at Stanford Hall, near Market Harborough, he flew <i>Hawk</i>, but crashed to the ground. Pilcher was severely injured and never regained consciousness; he died two days later, on 2 October 1899, at Stanford Hall. He was buried at Brompton cemetery in London. He was unmarried. Some historians have speculated whether, had Pilcher lived, he might have achieved proper powered, sustained, and controlled flight before the Wright brothers did so in December 1903.<br>
