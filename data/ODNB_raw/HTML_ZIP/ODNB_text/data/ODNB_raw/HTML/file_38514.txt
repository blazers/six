<span class="headword">Bell,  Julia</span>  (1879&#150;1979), <span class="occ">geneticist</span>, was born on 28 January 1879 at Sherwood, Nottinghamshire. She was tenth of the fourteen children of James Bell, printer, and Katherine Thomas Heap. She was educated at Nottingham Girls' High School and in 1898 entered Girton College, Cambridge, to study mathematics. Illness prevented her from taking the exam and in 1901 she was awarded an aegrotat degree. At that time women were permitted to take courses at Cambridge but not to graduate. This anomalous situation meant that in 1907 Julia Bell went to Ireland to receive her MA from Trinity College, Dublin, which from 1904 to 1907 offered this facility to Cambridge women.<br>
<br>From 1902 until 1908 Bell was a postgraduate student at the Cambridge observatory where she worked on the solar parallax under A. R. Hinks. During this period she was also doing mathematical calculations for the Revd Osmond Fisher on the physics of the earth's crust. It was Bell's skill as a mathematician which brought her to the attention of Karl Pearson, professor of applied mathematics and director of the Galton Laboratory for National Eugenics at University College, London. In 1908 he appointed her as one of his assistants. Bell did her calculations from home in Nottingham for a while but eventually settled in London. She had a connection with the Galton Laboratory lasting over fifty years.<br>
<br>Her appointment by Pearson was fortunate in a number of ways. Pearson espoused women's rights and in 1885 had been a co-founder, with Olive Schreiner, of the Men and Women's Club which promoted contact between the sexes on the basis of social and intellectual equality. His laboratory employed a number of distinguished women working in science both before and after Julia Bell joined it. Pearson was interested in the application of statistical methods to the study of heredity, and this was to become the dominant scientific interest in Bell's life. However, Pearson was hostile to the Mendelian theory of discrete and particulate inheritance. Instead he held to the theory of small, continuous variations which he believed better accorded with the Darwinian theory. Thus, while statistical techniques at the Galton Laboratory advanced considerably, an increasingly arid dispute with Mendelism prevented the full flowering of heredity studies.<br>
<br>From 1908 until 1914 Bell was involved in a series of mathematical investigations linked to heredity. These helped further the science of statistics but, based as they were on Pearson's biometrical theory of heredity, their value as contributions to the study of inheritance can be questioned. Bell was involved in the Galton Laboratory's most ambitious project, <span class="italic">The Treasury of Human Inheritance</span>, which collected and recorded pedigrees of human hereditary diseases and anomalies. This project took several decades and ran to five volumes of observations (published 1909&#150;58), each volume containing several distinct monographs. Bell contributed to volumes 2 (1922&#150;33), diseases of the eye; 4 (1934&#150;48), diseases of the nervous system; and 5 (1951&#150;8), digital abnormalities. The <span class="italic">Treasury</span> proved an invaluable source of information for students of heredity, and contained several pertinent interpretations of the data by Bell.<br>
<br>It was Bell's increasing interest in the more observational side to the study of heredity that led her to train as a doctor. In 1914 she entered the London School of Medicine for Women at the Royal Free Hospital, qualifying MRCS LRCP in 1920. She returned to the Galton Laboratory to continue her studies of heredity, and throughout the 1920s she practised medicine one day a week. She was awarded membership of the Royal College of Physicians in 1926 and elected fellow in 1938. She always retained an interest in the professional status and intellectual concerns of the medical world and at the age of eighty, in 1959, published an article in the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> on the effects of rubella in pregnancy.<br>
<br>Bell was employed as a full-time research worker by the Medical Research Council (MRC) until 1944. From 1926 to 1944 she was Galton research fellow at University College, London. In 1936 she also joined the MRC neurological unit at the National Hospital, Queen Square. During the 1930s she assembled family pedigrees on, among other conditions, ataxia, Huntington's disease, and haemophilia, travelling considerable distances to track down family pedigrees. The first stage of Bell's professional life during the 1920s was not without its frustrations. She was constrained by the necessity to get her grants renewed and to bargain up her salary with the MRC. Her position reflected the insecurity of many women in science on short-term research contracts.<br>
<br>In 1932 the most significant decade of Bell's scientific career began with her appointment to the genetics committee of the MRC. She accepted the appointment with characteristic diffidence although it was clearly in recognition of both her statistical skill and medical knowledge. Between 1933 and 1944 she became a permanent member of the MRC scientific staff. Serving with the committee gave her the opportunity to work with the foremost geneticists in Britain, including R. A. Fisher who in 1933 replaced Pearson as director of the Galton Laboratory, and J. B. S. Haldane who from 1933 to 1936 was professor of genetics at University College. Fisher was a Mendelian and his appointment to the laboratory signalled the decline of the influence of the biometrical school of heredity there.<br>
<br>Bell was now in a position to bring her unique qualities to overtly Mendelian studies of heredity. Her collaboration with Haldane, whom she regarded as being a great stimulus, was particularly fruitful. While collecting material for <span class="italic">The Treasury of Human Inheritance</span> in 1936 Bell came across evidence of a linkage between haemophilia and red&#150;green colour blindness in males. A notice of this was sent by Bell and Haldane to <span class="italic">Nature</span> on 15 October 1936 and a full-length exposition, written jointly, appeared in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society</span> in 1937. The paper detailed one of the first actual pedigrees confirming a significant male genetic linkage.<br>
<br>Bell continued work on linkage, publishing in the <span class="italic">Journal of Neurology</span> in 1943, with J. P. Martin, evidence of a link between mental retardation in males and the X chromosome. In 1940 Bell produced another important paper in <span class="italic">Annals of Eugenics</span> on the rate of consanguinity in England and Wales.<br>
<br>Bell's formal position in academia never matched her achievements, probably because of a combination of gender bias and limited opportunities in genetics. She was, however, in a unique position, with both statistical and medical training, to make a significant contribution to the development of genetic science. She was one of the pioneers who laid the foundations for the mapping of human chromosomes.<br>
<br>In 1941 Bell's career in statistics was rewarded by the presentation of the Weldon memorial prize and medal for biometry by Oxford University. In 1944 she retired from the Galton Laboratory but was appointed honorary research associate and, until 1965, remained on its staff. She continued to be an active researcher, helping prepare the fifth volume of <span class="italic">The Treasury of Human Inheritance</span> for publication in 1958. Relations with Lionel Penrose, who took over directorship of the Galton Laboratory in 1945, were good and it was on his initiative that her eightieth birthday in 1959 was celebrated by a reception at University College.<br>
<br>Julia Bell never married. She had a large circle of friends and family. Her numerous letters to colleagues reveal a talent for friendship and wide interests outside science which she listed in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> as music, plays, and reading. She remained independent until, at the age of ninety-seven, she was obliged to enter St George's Nursing Home, 61 St George's Square, Westminster, where she died on 26 April 1979 aged 100.<br>
