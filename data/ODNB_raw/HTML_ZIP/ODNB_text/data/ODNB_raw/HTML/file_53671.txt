<span class="headword">Harding,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1601, <em>d.</em> 1665), <span class="occ">alchemist and translator</span>, was baptized on 8 November 1601 at Great Haseley, Oxfordshire, eldest of the three sons and four daughters of John Harding (<i>c</i>.1562&#150;1610), rector of Great Haseley, and his wife, Isabel, whose former married name was Clarke. As regius professor of Hebrew at Oxford University, Harding's father was one of the appointed translators of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and was president of Magdalen College in 1607&#150;8. Harding matriculated at Magdalen on 25 October 1616; he graduated BA in 1620, held a fellowship in 1622&#150;8, and proceeded MA in 1623. He held the offices of bursar in 1625 and of vice-president in 1626. In or after 1628 Harding married Martha (<i>d</i>. 1682); they raised at least two sons, John (<i>d</i>. 1690), who graduated at Magdalen in 1650, and Edward (<i>d</i>. 1679), who graduated at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1653 and practised medicine at Northampton.<br>
<br>From 1642 Harding was rector of Brinkworth, Wiltshire. In pursuit of his interest in science he had become an avid follower of Paracelsus, and while at Brinkworth he became a significant translator and disseminator of Paracelsian works. His first collection, issued in 1659, was entitled <span class="italic">Paracelsus his Aurora &amp; treasures of the philosophers, as also the water-stone of the wise men</span> (the third text taken from Johann Siebmacher's <span class="italic">Der Wasserstein der Weisen</span>). The second and more important collection, <span class="italic">Paracelsus his Archidoxes</span>, together with many smaller treatises, was published in 1661 and reissued in 1663 as <span class="italic">Paracelsus his Archidoxes, or Chief Teachings, Comprised in Ten Books</span>. Harding had drawn mainly on Huser's German edition, but incorporated material from other German sources. A third work, <span class="italic">The Triumphant Chariot of Antimony</span> (1660), was supposedly translated from the fictional Basil Valentine. All Harding's publications were identified simply as &#145;by J. H. Oxon&#146;.<br>
<br>In the <span class="italic">Archidoxes</span> Harding alludes to the frustration he was experiencing with his self-imposed task of translating and publishing Paracelsian and other medical texts which formed the canon of a more empirically orientated school than the traditional one of medical practice. Its innovative element was the wedding of chemistry with medicine, wherein the body was seen as an extension of the chemical cosmos. Harding's prefaces show him to be an advocate of empirical studies. Alchemy was a tradition dominated by the search for gold and the elixir of life. With his translation of <span class="italic">Archidoxes</span>, Harding indicated his broad knowledge of Paracelsian works as well as his own wish to guide English alchemical and medical practice away from Galenic traditionalism and towards specific cures, founded on chemical substances and knowledge. In publishing these works, Harding had more than personal and academic difficulties to surmount; in the preface to <span class="italic">Archidoxes</span> he mentions his pleasure at publishing the tenth book of the work, its having previously been suppressed. Paracelsians were not popular figures in established medical or academic circles because they accused medical practitioners of ossification, callousness, and downright charlatanism.<br>
<br>Harding's declared intention to publish a complete translation of Paracelsus's <span class="italic">Paramirum</span> came to nought when in 1662 he was ejected from his living &#145;as a most violent presbyterian&#146;. He retired to Northampton where his nephew Edward, son of Edward Reynolds, bishop of Norwich and Harding's sister Mary, held the rectory of St Peter's. He died in April 1665 and was buried at St Peter's on 19 April.<br>
