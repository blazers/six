<span class="headword">Coombes,  Robert</span>  (1808&#150;1860), <span class="occ">oarsman</span>, was born at Vauxhall, Surrey, and was apprenticed at an early age as a waterman on the Thames. His first sculling victory came in July 1836 and during the next fifteen years he established himself as one of the principal professional scullers of his time. Although he was only 5 feet 7 inches tall and his rowing weight was normally under 9 stone, his skill often allowed him to beat men of greater strength and weight. Coombes's greatest achievements as a sculler were in the professional championship of England, a race held at infrequent intervals whenever a suitable challenger emerged. He was beaten at his first attempt on 1 November 1838 by the holder, Charles Campbell, but he defeated Campbell easily on 19 August 1846, the first time the championship was rowed over the Putney to Mortlake course on the Thames in London. He won the title twice more, beating Robert Newell on 29 September 1847 and Tom Mackinnery on 7 May 1851. He lost the championship to Thomas Cole, a younger man, on 24 May 1852 by only half a length. He challenged Cole again on 14 October of that year but lost once more; it was his last important sculling race.<br>
<br>Coombes also excelled in fours. He stroked a Thames four that beat Henry Clasper's crew on the Tyne on 16 July 1842, a race that prompted Clasper to develop the first keelless, outrigged boat. Two years later, on 21 June 1844, Coombes's crew lost to Clasper's at the Royal Thames regatta in London, although it won the fours championship on the final day. Using a boat similar to that designed by Clasper, Coombes won the championship for a second time in 1846 and again in 1849. On the latter occasion Clasper was the stroke, and this was the only time Coombes sank his differences with his Tyne rival. It was claimed in the press at the time &#145;that circumstances, not inclination exactly, conduced to this union&#146;.<br>
<br>Coombes's expertise attracted the attention of the university oarsmen. He trained the losing Oxford crew for the 1840 boat race and the victorious Cambridge boat in 1846. There were two races in 1849, and Coombes coached Cambridge on both occasions: Cambridge won the first but lost the second. When he was asked to coach the 1852 Cambridge crew, Coombes found himself at the centre of a fierce argument about the use of professional watermen in the training of university oarsmen. Oxford had expressed disquiet on the issue in 1846 and 1849 but on this occasion T. S. Egan, for many years the mentor of Cambridge rowing, was also concerned at Coombes's presence and defected to Oxford, where he trained a crew that won the boat race with ease. It was a decisive moment for certain amateur oarsmen, mainly those from the universities and the more important metropolitan clubs, who subsequently tried to distance themselves from the professionals and any oarsmen of working-class origin. Coombes was never again involved with a boat race crew but he explained his training methods at the end of a small volume published in 1852, <span class="italic">Aquatic notes or sketches of the rise and progress of racing at Cambridge by a member of C. U. B. C.</span>
<br>
<br>Later in life Coombes fell into poverty and began to suffer various mental disorders, and in 1859 he was admitted to the Kent Lunatic Asylum at Barming Heath, Maidstone. He died there on 25 February 1860. He was buried at the expense of his friends in Brompton cemetery on 7 March; the funeral was attended by the leading London watermen.<br>
