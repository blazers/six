<span class="headword">Babington,  William</span>  (1756&#150;1833), <span class="occ">physician and mineralogist</span>, the son of a clergyman, was born on 21 May 1756 at Portglenone, near Coleraine, co. Antrim, Ireland. After being apprenticed to a practitioner at Londonderry, he completed his medical education at Guy's Hospital, London, but did not take a medical degree. In 1777 he was made assistant surgeon to the Haslar naval hospital in Portsmouth, and held this appointment for four years. He then became apothecary to Guy's Hospital, and also lectured on chemistry in the medical school attached to the hospital. He published <span class="italic">Syllabus of a Course of Lectures at Guy's Hospital</span> in 1789. William and Martha Elizabeth Babington were married before 1794, and had four sons and four daughters between 1794 and 1810. The family lived in Cornhill, London, until about 1796, in Basinghall Street until 1801, and then in a large house in Aldermanbury until 1830.<br>
<br>Babington resigned the post of apothecary, and, gaining his MD from the University of Aberdeen in 1795, was elected assistant physician to Guy's Hospital in the same year. He was elected to the post of full physician in 1802. In 1811 he and James Curry published <span class="italic">Outlines of a Course of Lectures on the Practice of Medicine as Delivered</span> [at Guy's]. Babington resigned from his post at Guy's in the same year because of the pressures of private practice; however, within a week the hospital governors persuaded him to serve once again as an assistant physician, which he did until 1813. He had also been admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians in 1796 and he remained so until 1827, when he received the unusual honour of being elected fellow by special grace. In 1831 he was made honorary MD by the University of Dublin.<br>
<br>Babington was a very able and successful physician, whose skill and knowledge were confirmed by his contemporaries. He was a patron of the Royal Jennerian Society and a dominant figure in the Hunterian Society in the 1820s, being president of the latter in 1824 and orator in 1827. However, his chief interests were in chemistry and mineralogy, rather than in medicine. He lectured on chemistry at Guy's Hospital for many years, and published some memoirs in <span class="italic">Nicholson's Journal</span>. He was friendly with chemists such as Humphry Davy and Joseph Priestley, and he lectured on the application of science at the Chapter Coffee House Society in the 1790s. His interest in mineralogy was even greater, and he achieved more. While apothecary to Guy's Hospital he acquired the valuable collection of minerals which had belonged to John Stuart, earl of Bute. Babington made an elaborate catalogue of the collection, which served as the foundation of his <span class="italic">Systematic Arrangement of Minerals</span> (1795) and his <span class="italic">New System of Mineralogy</span> (1799). Babington was a member of the short-lived British Mineralogical Society (1799&#150;1806), and joined the Askesian Society in 1801. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1805, being described as &#145;a gentleman eminently learned in chemistry and mineralogy&#146; in the citation.<br>
<br>Babington did more by encouraging science than by his own work, and has some claim to be regarded as the founder of the Geological Society. The circumstances are recorded by G. B. Greenough:<blockquote>With a view to enable Count Bournon, of whom he had been a pupil, to publish his elaborate monograph on the carbonate of lime, Dr. Babington in 1807, invited to his house a number of gentlemen the most distinguished for their zeal in the prosecution of mineralogical knowledge. A subscription was opened and the necessary sum readily collected. The object having been accomplished, other meetings of the same gentlemen took place, for the joint purpose of friendly intercourse and mutual instruction. From such small beginnings sprang the Geological Society, and among the names of those by whose care and watchfulness it was supported during the early and most perilous crisis of its history, that of Dr. Babington must always stand conspicuous. (Greenough, 42&#150;4)</blockquote>Babington was president of the society in 1822, but he did not contribute to its <span class="italic">Transactions</span>. After this he took lessons in geology from Thomas Webster, and he attended the chemical lectures at London University in the year before his death. He was also appointed by the government to be one of the referees to put a price on the Greville collection of minerals, bought by the nation and preserved in the Natural History Museum.<br>
<br>Babington had acquired a large and lucrative medical practice, and continued with his medical and scientific work until within four days of his death, which occurred from influenza, at his home in Portland Place, London, on 29 April 1833. He was buried in the church of St Mary Aldermanbury. Four years after his death a monument was erected to him in St Paul's Cathedral by public subscription. He left a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/968/', "Benjamin Guy Babington")</script>, also physician to Guy's Hospital, and a daughter, Martha, who married the physician Richard Bright.<br>
