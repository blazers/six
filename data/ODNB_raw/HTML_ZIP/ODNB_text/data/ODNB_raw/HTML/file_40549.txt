<span class="headword">Hastings <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Stanley]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>, countess of Huntingdon  (<em>bap. </em>1587, <em>d.</em> 1633), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was baptized at Knowsley, Lancashire, on 6 January 1587, the third and youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26269/', "Ferdinando Stanley (1559?&#150;1594), fifth earl of Derby")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47391/', "Alice Spencer (1559&#150;1637), later dowager countess of Derby")</script> (her second husband was Sir Thomas Egerton). Elizabeth Stanley married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40548/', "Henry Hastings, later fifth earl of Huntingdon (1586&#150;1643)")</script>, on 15 January 1601, and bore him four children. Educated with her two sisters, Anne (later Lady Chandos) and Frances (later first countess of Bridgewater), in the households of the Stanley and Egerton families, Elizabeth was widely recognized as highly educated and deeply religious. Lucius Cary described her as<blockquote>
<div>Born learneder than Hippatia<br>
</div>
<div>And might be called the philosophos truer than she.<br>
</div> (Weber, 287)</blockquote>Her only extant writings, a series of devotions drawn largely from the works of Joseph Hall and Arthur Hildersham, show her piety, and she and her sister, the countess of Bridgewater, shared theological books. As she spoke French she may also have shared her sister's passion for French theology and romances. From the musical associations of both the Egerton and the Hastings families it is likely she also had some musical education, and she danced in at least one court masque, as an unidentified queen in &#145;The Masque of Queens&#146; (1609).<br>
<br>The importance of her sisters and mother in the countess of Huntingdon's patronage cannot be overstated. Writing in 1610 Gainsford described mother and daughters as moving &#145;together like fair planets in conspicuous orbs&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of Trebizond</span>, sig. L4<i>r</i>). The dowager countess had literary connections with Spenser, and potentially to Shakespeare (she took over patronage of her husband's players), and she was later celebrated by Milton. Her daughters wrote religious works, exchanged books, and employed poets and writers, augmenting their husband's intellectual and political networks. The countess of Huntingdon is no exception, and it seems that she continued this tradition of female learning and patronage through the education of her son Ferdinando's wife, Lady Lucy Davies.<br>
<br>In 1607 John Marston represented the countess as Selas, the &#145;grace of the Muses&#146;, in his &#145;Entertainment&#146; (Hunt., EL 34 B9), a masque designed to mark her husband's coming of age but which also celebrated the joint dynastic inheritance of the couple. (The masque's central image combines the Stanley eagle with symbols of Huntingdon's royal forestry offices.) This event, typically, brought together such local poets and gentry as Sir William Skipwith and the family's national literary connections. Donne addressed two verse epistles (of uncertain date) to her, and Thomas Pestell (perhaps when serving as household chaplain) sent her poetic tributes comparing her to Elizabeth I and Elizabeth of Bohemia. John Fletcher (who dedicated his <span class="italic">Faithful Shepherdess</span> to members of her Leicestershire circle) complimented Ashby's Edenic hospitality and the countess as having &#145;the apple still to know what 'tis&#146;  (Hastings MSS, HA 13333). Indeed, Fletcher's envoy alludes to books to be sent from London, suggesting her national links, and Sir Henry Goodyer, an important figure in the circulation of literary and political texts, seems to have facilitated her patronage of Donne. Perhaps because of shared support for Elizabeth of Bohemia (strengthened by the links of the fifth earl's aunt and uncle to the princess) the countess established correspondence with Sir Thomas Roe. Roe wrote to her from Adsmere in India celebrating her &#145;goodness&#146; and &#145;virtue&#146; and looking forward to Christmas and conversation at Ashby  (Hastings MSS, HA 10561).<br>
<br>The evidence suggests that Lady Huntingdon was a significant patroness even within her limited means, respected by writers and intellectuals for her &#145;judicious conceit and masculine understanding&#146;  (Hastings MSS, HA 5515). Her funeral sermon praises her &#145;understanding&#146; and &#145;perspicacity&#146;, notably in &#145;occasions and affairs&#146;  (I. F., <span class="italic">A Sermon</span>, sig. E3<i>v</i>). She was used as an intermediary by the Leicester councillors during their quarrel with her husband in 1607 and she was heavily involved in the management of her husband's estates and finances. Furthermore, during the 1630s she engaged in an extensive lobbying campaign, persuading the earls of Bridgewater, Manchester, and Worcester to support her husband, and single-handed she re-established the Huntingdon links with Whitehall &#145;to advantage and sustain the estate of her house&#146;  (ibid.). The fifth earl's re-engagement with Whitehall affairs in the 1630s was her crowning political achievement. She died, probably of uterine cancer, at Whitefriars, London, on 20 January 1633 and was buried at Ashby-de-la-Zouch on 9 February.<br>
