<span class="headword">Oldfield,  John</span>  (1626/7&#150;1682), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born near Chesterfield, Derbyshire. He was educated at the grammar school at Dronfield, Derbyshire, and though of no university, was justly reputed an able scholar. In 1647 he obtained the vicarage of Crich, Derbyshire, but left two years later, with the approval of the assembly of divines, to become rector of Carsington in the same county. He regularly attended the Wirksworth classis from December 1651 until its last recorded session in November 1658, serving as moderator fifteen times. Leading Derbyshire presbyterians, such as Robert Porter, Thomas Shelmerdine, and the Hieron brothers, John and Samuel, highly esteemed Oldfield, and invited him to preach before them on several occasions, including the first ordination held by the classis in January 1652. They approved his sermon of July 1655 as &#145;seasonable and orthodox&#146;, and, in January 1656, appointed him to deliver a lecture against Socinian errors  (Cox, <span class="italic">Minute Book</span>, 186). Oldfield married Porter's sister, Ann; their eldest son was born on 1 November 1654, their youngest about 1673. Despite Calamy's claim that Oldfield won the affection of a peculiarly &#145;ticklish and capricious&#146; flock, the fact that he had to request the assistance of lay elders from outside Carsington suggests his own parishioners were either unwilling or unfit to serve in that capacity  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.172). Nevertheless, he declined a more lucrative offer of the perpetual curacy of Tamworth to remain with his people. Oldfield's nonconformity cost him his living in 1662. Following his ejection he settled at Alfreton, Derbyshire, where, though occasionally attending public worship, he preached in conventicles. In 1672 he took out a licence to preach in the house of John Spateman at Road Nook, as well as in his own house and at Derby.<br>
<br>Between 1663 and 1671 Oldfield published three works. His &#145;Stumbling at the Sufferings of the Godly&#146;, printed in <span class="italic">England's Remembrancer</span> (1663), a collection of farewell sermons by ejected ministers, reveals his sense of having been abandoned at the Restoration. He expected the profane multitude to hail the ejections as well-deserved retribution, above all for the presbyterians' obnoxious attempts to restrict access to the sacrament. But it stung to hear even the godly whisper about their pastor as &#145;an ignorant, scrupulous, or obstinate fool&#146;. Though it looked indeed as if God had &#145;spit in our faces&#146;, Oldfield reminded his hearers (and himself) that Christians were called to a life of suffering; besides, he added with more gusto, providence would eventually vindicate the godly ministers  (Oldfield, &#145;Stumbling&#146;, 245, 241). He also defended his reluctance to submit to reordination and his refusal to accept ceremonies he deemed not only unedifying, but positively forbidden in scripture. A particularly full account of Oldfield's objections to conformity survives because, in addition to this sermon, Calamy printed lengthy extracts from his private deliberations drawn up in the agonizing months prior to August 1662.<br>
<br>As befitted one who &#145;knew well the inside of Religion&#146;, Oldfield's two later books grappled with the problem of formalism, or the tendency to rest in outward performances, devoid of grace  (Porter, 51). In 1666 he published <span class="italic">The First, Last, or the Formal Hypocrite Further from Salvation &hellip; than the Prophane Sinner</span>. In his treatise on prayer, <span class="italic">The Generation of Seekers</span> (1671), he positioned himself in the tradition of Jacobean puritanism, recalling the practical works of John Brinsley the elder, Robert Bolton, and Daniel Dyke. He hoped his exposition of the Lord's prayer would &#145;help to improve that which &hellip; is turned at this day into a piece of formality, by so frequent repetition in public&#146;  (Oldfield, <span class="italic">Generation</span>, epistle).<br>
<br>Oldfield died in Alfreton on 5 June 1682, aged fifty-five, and was buried in Alfreton church, where there is a brass plate to his memory. With his wife, Ann Porter, he had four sons who became clergymen. The eldest son, John (<i>b</i>. 1654), received presbyterian ordination in September 1681, but afterwards conformed. The others adhered to their father's principles: the presbyterian minister and nonconformist tutor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20681/', "Joshua Oldfield (1656&#150;1729)")</script>; Nathaniel (<i>d</i>. 1696), who was minister at Maid Lane, Southwark; and Samuel, who was pastor at Woolwich, Kent, and from 1719 at Ramsbury, Wiltshire.<br>
<br>Oldfield's reflections as he faced his crisis in the summer of 1662 were to echo into the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. They were drawn on in the 1770s by the unitarian Theophilus Lindsey when he found that his beliefs meant that he could no longer in conscience retain his Anglican living, and Lindsey's writings are quoted by Elizabeth Gaskell in <span class="italic">North and South</span>. Facing the same hard choice between conscience and retaining one's living, the Revd Hale takes inspiration from the &#145;soliloquy&#146; of John Oldfield, &#145;a clergyman in a country parish, like myself &hellip; His trials are over, he fought the good fight&#146;:<blockquote>When thou canst no longer continue in thy work without dishonour to God, discredit to religion, foregoing thy integrity, wounding conscience, spoiling thy peace, and hazarding the loss of thy salvation; in a word, when the conditions upon which thou must continue (if thou wilt continue) in thy employments are sinful, and unwarranted by the word of God, thou mayest, yea, thou must believe that God will turn thy very silence, suspension, deprivation, and laying aside, to His glory, and the advancement of the Gospel's interest. (E. Gaskell, <span class="italic">North and South</span>, 1855, chap. 4)</blockquote>
