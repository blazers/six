<span class="headword">Ranyard <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>White]</span>,  Ellen Henrietta</span>  (1810&#150;1879), <span class="occ">home mission worker</span>, was born on 9 January 1810 in the district of Nine Elms, London, the eldest daughter of John Bazley White, maker of cement. She was a member of the Congregational church in Walworth, and after attending a <span class="roman">Bible</span> meeting at Wanstead when she was sixteen she accompanied her friend Elizabeth Saunders on a mission to supply <span class="roman">Bibles</span> to poor families. The two discovered that thirty-five families were without <span class="roman">Bibles</span>, and they collected 35 pennies towards supplying each family with the scriptures. She recollected:<blockquote>I came home having seen for the first time how the poor live; their ignorance, their dirt, their smells. &hellip; She [Elizabeth] spoke to them, but the spirit of God carried the message home to <i>me</i>. &hellip; When I went to bed at night I took up my <span class="roman">Bible</span> to read my usual chapter with a new feeling for it &hellip; my hard young heart was softened, and a quiet new affection drawn out to this new and gentle friend. (Alldridge, 106&#150;7)</blockquote>Both girls caught typhoid fever after their missionary visit. Elizabeth died; but Ellen recovered and believed that she had found her life's work. &#145;I remember thinking&#146;, Ellen wrote a few years later, &#145;that the <span class="roman">Bible</span> work was the one work to which I had been called by God, and to which I must keep faithful as one who had been baptised for the dead&#146;  (Alldridge, 108). Once recovered from typhoid, Ellen returned to the thirty-five homes, collected the remaining money, which amounted to &pound;6, and took it to a women's <span class="roman">Bible</span> committee meeting at the British and Foreign Bible Society, of which her grandmother was president, and from which the thirty-five <span class="roman">Bibles</span> were procured and distributed by Ellen. She eventually became a secretary of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> committee, and canvassed other districts in addition to her own.<br>
<br>In her early twenties Ellen and her family moved to Swanscombe in Kent, where she met Benjamin Ranyard of Millibank Street, Westminster. They married at York Street Chapel, in Surrey, on 10 January 1839. They had two sons and two daughters, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23141/', "Arthur Cowper Ranyard")</script>. Ellen Ranyard combined her maternal responsibilities with philanthropic ones, primarily her work with the Bible Society. In her spare time she painted in oils as well as creating woodland scenes out of dried seaweed and watercolour. She also wrote edifying poems with titles such as &#145;Bear ye one another's burdens&#146; and &#145;On Self-Regulation&#146;, which were collected and published in 1855 in <span class="italic">Leaves from Life</span> and in <span class="italic">The Border Land and other Poems</span> under the pseudonym LNR. She also wrote texts for the Bible Society, the first of these being a children's book about the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, <span class="italic">The Book and its Story</span> (1852), to celebrate the society's jubilee. Two years later she edited the society's journal, <span class="italic">The Book and its Missions, Past and Present</span>.<br>
<br>In 1857 the Ranyards left Kent for Bloomsbury, London. They settled at 13 Hunter Street, not far from slum areas which Ellen Ranyard, after visiting with a retired physician friend, decided to &#145;civilize&#146;. She planned to accomplish this, as did many a Victorian philanthropist, by bringing the inhabitants both spiritual and material assistance since, as she remarked in a later publication, &#145;If Jesus makes our hearts clean, our homes will soon be clean too&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life Work</span>, 108). Her prime concern was how to supply London's poor with <span class="roman">Bibles</span> and she decided that this would best be accomplished not by city missionaries, but by working-class women. She asked St Giles's resident missionary in Bloomsbury whether he could recommend a suitable candidate; he suggested a woman named Marian, and so the Biblewoman movement, formally called the London Bible and Domestic Female Mission, was born. Characterized by its reliance on the poor as the dispensers as well as the recipients of charity and missionary endeavour, the movement spread not only to other English towns, but also to south-east Asia, Australia, and North America.<br>
<br>Over the years Ellen Ranyard expanded her operations to include mothers' meetings, at which working-class mothers would listen to <span class="roman">Bible</span> readings, sew, and converse; bed and clothing clubs; a dormitory for young watercress-sellers and needlewomen; a rescue home; and, in 1868, a district nursing scheme. Like the Biblewomen, the nurses dispensed spiritual aid and were expected to carry a <span class="roman">Bible</span> with their medical supplies. The combination of spiritual and medical assistance, which the Ranyard nurses dispensed, continued well into the mid-twentieth century.<br>
<br>Ellen Ranyard wrote extensively on her mission and its workers. Principal among her publications were <span class="italic">The Missing Link, or, Bible-Women in the Homes of the London Poor</span> (1859); <span class="italic">Life Work, or, The Link and the Rivet</span> (1861); <span class="italic">London and Ten Years' Work in it</span> (1868); and <span class="italic">Nurses for the Needy, or, Bible-Women Nurses in the Homes of the London Poor</span> (1875). She also edited the mission's journal, the <span class="italic">Missing Link Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>Ellen Ranyard died from bronchitis at her home, 13 Hunter Street, on 11 February 1879, and was buried in Norwood cemetery. Her husband survived her.<br>
