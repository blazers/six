<span class="headword">Montefiore,  Claude Joseph  Goldsmid-</span>  (1858&#150;1938), <span class="occ">scholar and founder of Liberal Judaism</span>, was born in London on 6 June 1858, the youngest of four children born to Nathaniel Mayer Montefiore (1819&#150;1883), medical practitioner, and his wife, Emma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Goldsmid (1819&#150;1902). On his father's side Montefiore was a nephew of Sir Moses Montefiore; on his mother's he was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10920/', "Isaac Lyon Goldsmid")</script>. His roots were thus firmly planted within some of the wealthiest Anglo-Jewish families. A delicate, thoughtful child, his early ambition was to enter the rabbinate. Educated privately and then at Balliol College, Oxford, where he graduated BA with a first in classics (1881), he came under the influence of liberal ideas, particularly the religious liberalism of the then master of Balliol, Benjamin Jowett. In 1881&#150;2 he studied Jewish subjects in Berlin, at the Hochschule (later Lehranstalt) f&uuml;r die Wissenschaft des Judentums, where he met, and from which he brought to England as his tutor in rabbinic literature, the Romanian-Jewish academic Solomon Schechter, later reader in rabbinic and Talmudic literature at Cambridge. Schechter was a thoroughly Orthodox Jew, but one who was not afraid of approaching Jewish texts in a critical manner.<br>
<br>Montefiore's own religious leanings had already veered away from the nominal orthodoxy of his father and were at this time heavily influenced by the Reform Judaism of his mother. Montefiore, like her, questioned and found wanting the eternal truths of Orthodox Judaism. In 1886 he married, at the West London Synagogue of British [Reform] Jews, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se (<i>d</i>. 1889), daughter of Lazar Schorstein of Reuter's agency, London. Three years later Th&eacute;r&egrave;se died in childbirth. Montefiore abandoned plans to become a rabbi, and instead used the leisure his private wealth secured to deepen and broaden his religious studies, which were now taking him well beyond the modest radicalism of the West London Synagogue. In 1891, at Jowett's invitation, he delivered the Hibbert lectures at Oxford, entitled &#145;The origins of religion as illustrated by the ancient Hebrews&#146;. In these he set out the prospectus for a new form of Judaism, the doctrine of which he developed to maturity over the next decade.<br>
<br>The essence of Montefiore's theology was to be found within an entirely de-nationalized and de-ritualized Judaism. He rejected the central tenet of Orthodox Judaism, that the Hebrew <span class="roman">Bible</span> was the revealed word of God, and he rejected the claim that the <span class="roman">Talmud</span> represented the definitive interpretation of that word. What was left was simply an amalgam of moral and ethical values, based on a vague monotheism: the good Jew was the good citizen, charged with the task of bearing witness to &#145;righteousness in action and truthfulness of the heart&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jewish Quarterly Review</span>, 1/2, 152). Such were the intellectual origins of Liberal Judaism, the founding tenets of which Montefiore proclaimed from the pulpit of the West London Synagogue on 1 February 1896. The condemnation of him, and his philosophy, from the world of Orthodox Judaism was almost without qualification. However, he found a number of kindred spirits, especially in Lily Montagu, a daughter of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish banker and MP, Sir Samuel Montagu. Lily's rebellion against the oppressive Orthodox observance which she had to endure in her father's house could not have been more complete or more public. Lily warmed to Montefiore; in truth she wished to marry him, but was rebuffed. She formed the idea of founding an organization to promote his religious views, and hers. On 16 February 1902 the Jewish Religious Union (from 1909 the Jewish Religious Union for the Advancement of Liberal Judaism) was born. Montefiore was its president and philosopher-in-chief from its foundation until his death.<br>
<br>Scarcely less important to Montefiore than his Liberal Judaism was his anti-Zionism. In common with most members of the emancipated Anglo-Jewish gentry, Montefiore harboured and articulated a strong aversion to Jewish nationalism, which he regarded as quite incompatible with his status as a Briton of the Jewish persuasion. In his capacity as president of the Anglo-Jewish Association from 1896 to 1921 he was one of the two signatories of a letter published in <span class="italic">The Times</span> of 24 May 1917, which argued that Jews were not &#145;a homeless people&#146; and had &#145;no separate national aspirations&#146;. The appearance of the letter created a sensation within Anglo-Jewry: Montefiore's co-signatory, David Lindo Alexander, was compelled to resign as president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews. But at the Anglo-Jewish Association, a self-appointed body whose membership reflected the views of like-minded British Jews, Montefiore was assured of support. Later that year, following the promulgation of the Balfour declaration, he became a founder member of the League of British Jews, dedicated to resisting the allegation that Jewish people constituted a separate political entity. In his anti-Zionist faith Montefiore was unshakeable, even when Nazism cast its shadow across Europe. Under his influence the Liberal Jewish Synagogue in London became a bastion of anti-Zionist propaganda. Montefiore blamed Zionism, in part, for Hitler's rise to power.<br>
<br>Montefiore was a prolific writer, especially on biblical subjects and in popularizing the Jewish origins of Christianity. From 1888 to 1908 he served as joint editor of the <span class="italic">Jewish Quarterly Review</span>. In 1909 he published <span class="italic">The Synoptic Gospels</span>, the following year <span class="italic">Some Elements of the Religious Teaching of Jesus</span>, and in 1914 <span class="italic">Judaism and St Paul</span>. His <span class="italic">Bible for Home Reading</span>, a work of some 1400 pages, first published in 1897, went into three editions. He received honorary degrees from Manchester University in 1920 and Oxford University in 1927, and in 1930 he was awarded the British Academy medal for biblical studies. Montefiore was also deeply interested in educational matters and in social welfare. For a few months in 1888 he served as a co-opted member of the London school board. He was instrumental in the establishment of the Froebel Institute at Roehampton and in 1913 he became president of Hartley College, precursor of Southampton University.<br>
<br>Montefiore assumed the additional surname of Goldsmid by letters patent in 1883. In 1902 he married his first wife's tutor, Florence Fyfe Brereton (<i>d</i>. December 1938), daughter of Richard James Ward; she had been a vice-principal of Girton College, Cambridge, and underwent a formal conversion to Judaism. He died at his London home, 42 Portman Square, on 9 July 1938 and was survived by Leonard (1889&#150;1961), the son of his first marriage.<br>
