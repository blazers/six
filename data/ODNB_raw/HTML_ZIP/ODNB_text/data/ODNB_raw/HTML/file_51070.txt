<span class="headword">Khan,  (Mohammed) Masud Raza</span>  (1924&#150;1989), <span class="occ">psychoanalyst</span>, was born on 21 July 1924 at Jhelum in the Punjab in pre-partition India, the second of the three children of the fourth marriage of his father, Fazaldad Khan (<i>c</i>.1846&#150;1943). Khan's father, a wealthy landowner, was seventy-six years old with several middle-aged children by the time he married Khan's mother, Khursheed Begum (1905&#150;1971), a beautiful, illiterate singing-and-dancing-girl of seventeen, who had already borne a son out of wedlock before she met Fazaldad Khan. Due to his mother's background Khan's nuclear family became an alienated offshoot of a respected family in the established hierarchy of what later became Pakistan.<br>
<br>Masud Khan was brought up as a devout Muslim on his father's vast feudal estates. He had an elder brother, Tahir (1923&#150;1983), and a younger sister, Mahmooda (1926&#150;1942). He was a solitary child, very handsome, but had to contend with a slight deformity, a disfigured right ear. At home the family spoke Punjabi but the household had an Oxford educated governess, possibly in an attempt to lift the status of the children and cleanse them of the putative stigma of their mother's reputation. Masud Khan grew up in an isolated, stigmatized yet privileged world; a world of polarities as to his parents' ages, social class, education, and demarcated sexual roles, a world where his leisure time was spent with horses and playing polo. From about 1942 to 1945 he went to the University of the Punjab at Lyallpur (Faisalabad) and Lahore, where he gained his BA and MA degrees.<br>
<br>In 1946 he went to England and was due to attend Balliol College, Oxford, but was accepted for training at the Institute of Psycho-Analysis. He was a tall young man, remarkable for his good looks and elegant bearing, when he entered a world so different from that of his cultural heritage. At twenty-six, however, he became one of the youngest analysts ever to qualify. His psychoanalysts were Ella Sharpe, John Rickman, and, after each of them had died, Donald Winnicott. He was supervised by both Anna Freud and Melanie Klein. When he undertook the further specialist training in child psychoanalysis his supervisors were Donald Winnicott, Clifford Scott, and Marion Milner.<br>
<br>Khan was a maverick in the analytic world. An omnivorous reader with an impressive library, he had a distinctive style and literary flair. With his concept of cumulative trauma, he established himself as one of the major contributors to psychoanalytic theory. That trauma could operate silently with its effect not becoming manifest until later in adolescence was an arresting thought. He, more than any other clinical writer since Freud, managed to convey the very texture and quality of what a true analytic encounter could achieve, the relief of being understood, of feeling knowable, particularly for those patients who were unable to use the more orthodox analytic situation in a meaningful way. However, this attempt to meet the vulnerability and resourcelessness in his patients by, at times, ignoring the accepted conventions governing the patient&#150;analyst relationship, led Khan into repeated clashes with the psychoanalytic establishment. Increasingly his life aroused much comment and criticism particularly among his English colleagues. He had a more wholehearted following in France, Germany, and the United States.<br>
<br>Despite a contemptuous disregard for many of his colleagues, Khan sponsored several new analysts in his successful term as editor of the <span class="roman">International Psychoanalytical Library</span> and also in his role as associate editor of both the <span class="italic">International Journal of Psycho-Analysis</span> and the <span class="italic">International Review of Psycho-Analysis</span>. A frequent contributor to the <span class="italic">Nouvelle Revue de Psychanalyse</span>, he was also its foreign co-editor. He was particularly proud of his active role in editing Winnicott's work and was instrumental in publishing it and making him available to a wider public. Consequently Khan was devastated when he was not made Winnicott's literary executor on his death.<br>
<br>Khan published papers extensively in the United States, France, and England. Concerned with the patient's experience of self, he had four books published on this theme; <span class="italic">The Privacy of the Self</span> (1974), <span class="italic">Alienation in Perversions</span> (1979), <span class="italic">Hidden Selves</span> (1983), and finally and unhappily his controversial book containing some antisemitic passages, <span class="italic">When Spring Comes</span> (1988), which caused his expulsion from the British Psycho-Analytical Society shortly before his death.<br>
<br>A few months after Winnicott's death in January 1971 Khan's mother died. He had always had a difficult relationship with her. This double death was a repetition of an earlier trauma for Khan when, in his adolescence, his younger sister died, followed soon after by his feared but idealized father. Khan's whole style of being, both private and professional, seemed to be based on his caring and cruel father. Both brilliant and learned, Khan remained in essence an Eastern potentate. More than likely this was the self-same style of feudal rule that Khan's father exerted on his family and retainers.<br>
<br>Since the mid-1970s Khan had been dogged by cancer and severe ill health, which, together with an increasing problem with alcohol, led to his removal from the position of training analyst and gradually forced him to give up his thriving practice and concentrate on writing.<br>
<br>Although Khan had numerous affairs in his lifetime, he married only twice. On 26 July 1952 he married Jane Shore (<i>b</i>. 1928/9), a modern dancer, daughter of Bernard Shore, a well-known viola player, but the marriage did not last long. On 23 January 1959 he married the ballerina <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71241/', "Svetlana Beriosova (1932&#150;1998)")</script>, daughter of Nicholas Beriozoff, director of a ballet company, a marriage which was dissolved in 1974. There were no children from either marriage. Although Khan was treated mainly at the London Clinic throughout his last years of illness, he died in St Mary's Hospital, Praed Street, London, on 7 June 1989. His body was returned to Faisalabad, Pakistan, for burial in the family graveyard.<br>
