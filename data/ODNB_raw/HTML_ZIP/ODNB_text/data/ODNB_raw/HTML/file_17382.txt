<span class="headword">Maccarthy,  Robert</span>, styled fifth earl of Clancarty  (<em>d.</em> 1769), <span class="occ">Jacobite sympathizer and Royal Naval officer</span>, was the eldest son of the scandalous union between <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17378/', "Donough Maccarthy, styled fourth earl of Clancarty (1668&#150;1734)")</script>, and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1704), the second daughter of Robert Spencer, second earl of Sunderland, who was aged between eleven and thirteen years at their marriage on 31 December 1684. Lord Clancarty left his wife without consummating the marriage and returned to Ireland, where he participated in James II's unsuccessful invasion attempt of 1689. A decade after his marriage Clancarty returned from exile against the wishes of Sunderland and was rearrested by government troops. Clancarty was finally pardoned by William III (though his estates and title were forfeited to William, earl of Portland), and he and his wife went to Hamburg, where they lived on a government pension.<br>
<br>After his mother's death in 1704 Robert Maccarthy (styled Viscount Muskerry) returned to England and, with his sister Charlotte, was befriended by Sarah, duchess of Marlborough, a former associate of the countess of Clancarty. While the duchess did not approve of a Stuart restoration, she kept many in her circle who, like Robert, maintained a Jacobite connection. A profligate youth who combined hard drinking with a rough temper, Muskerry lost the sight of an eye during a drunken brawl at a tavern. His sister once remarked that &#145;his judgement is not his brightest side&#146;  (Harris, 326). On 14 December 1722 he married his first wife, Joanna (1693&#150;1759), daughter of Henry Player of Alverstone, Hampshire.<br>
<br>Through his association with the duchess, Muskerry received a commission in the British navy, and at the time of his father's death in September 1734 he commanded a ship off Newfoundland. Muskerry now assumed his father's title as fifth earl of Clancarty, but failed to have it recognized in Britain. At this date the British government also cancelled his father's pension, but in lieu the duchess of Marlborough granted Clancarty an annuity of &pound;400 and provided him with an apartment in the courtyard of Marlborough House. From 1733 to 1735 Muskerry served as governor of Newfoundland. On his return to England he attempted to recover the family estates, which had made his ancestors some of the wealthiest and largest landholders in Ireland. The suit provoked severe disruption within the Irish aristocracy. John Boyle, fifth earl of Orrery wrote to Jonathan Swift that &#145;Lord Clancarty's Thunderbolt will destroy half of our most wealthy Neighbours&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Jonathan Swift</span>, 5.360). Clancarty continued to draw heavily on support from the duchess of Marlborough, who allegedly paid the legal bills for his suit. In addition the French minister, Cardinal Fleury, pleaded Clancarty's case with Sir Robert Walpole. Despite their backing, the claim proved unsuccessful. Having failed in his efforts, Clancarty returned to sea, rising to command the <i>Adventure</i> at the outbreak of the War of Jenkins's Ear (1739) before leaving the navy in 1741. At the death of Sarah, duchess of Marlborough (18 October 1744), he received a gift of &pound;1000 and a further &pound;1000 a year, as well as a manor in Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>However, Clancarty left England to join the ranks of adventurers who travelled to Paris to support Charles Edward Stuart, the Young Pretender, and the Jacobite forces planning to invade Scotland. Clancarty did not accompany the prince, and after the uprising's collapse he was to be found, often drunk and dishevelled, unsuccessfully scheming for the Jacobite cause in France. Excluded from the 1747 <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span>, Clancarty never returned to England. After the death of his first wife in January 1759, he married Elizabeth Farnelly (<i>d</i>. 1790). Granted a pension of &pound;1000 a year by Louis XV, Clancarty had by now retired to Boulogne. There he gained a reputation as a pleasant storyteller and generous host who &#145;generally finished the evening in an oblivion of all former cares&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Jonathan Swift</span>, 18.412). A heavy drinker his whole life, apparently he finally drank himself to death on 19 September 1769. He was survived by two sons, who took commissions in the French army. Clancarty's life was chronicled in the July and August editions of <span class="italic">Walker's Hibernian Magazine</span> (1796)&#151;a portrait of a minor, ineffective, but certainly colourful champion of the ill-fated Stuart cause.<br>
