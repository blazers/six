<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Logan,  John</span>  (1747/8&#150;1788), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and writer</span>, was born in late 1747 or early 1748 in Soutra, in the eastern Edinburghshire parish of Fala. The second son of George Logan, a farmer, and Janet Waterston of Stowe, he was sent to the grammar school in Musselburgh; it was probably there that he made the acquaintance of the local minister, Alexander Carlyle, who would remain a lifelong confidant. Some time during his youth the family moved to Gosford Mains, along the northern coast of Haddingtonshire. Although his parents frequented the congregation of the Revd John Brown of Haddington, the foremost minister of the Burgher branch of Presbyterian seceders, Logan gradually shifted his allegiance to the moderate party in the Church of Scotland. From November 1762 he was a student of arts, and subsequently divinity, at the University of Edinburgh, where his classmates included Thomas Robertson, later minister at Dalmeny and an intimate friend to the end, and Michael Bruce, whose <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> Logan would publish in Edinburgh in 1770, three years after Bruce's untimely death. At the university Logan came under the influence of Adam Ferguson and Hugh Blair, both moderates in the Carlyle circle. On Blair's recommendation he travelled in the summer of 1768 to Caithness, in the far north of Scotland, to serve as tutor to fourteen-year-old John Sinclair, later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25627/', "Sir John Sinclair")</script> of Ulbster, the famous agricultural improver, who remained a friend and patron for life. Logan received his licence to preach from the presbytery of Haddington on 27 September 1770, and the following year was called to the second charge at South Leith, near Edinburgh, although a dispute over a competing presentation provoked a heavy-handed satirical drama entitled <span class="italic">The Planters of the Vineyard</span> (1771) and delayed his ordination until 2 April 1773. He possessed a versatile intellect and in his early years at South Leith was supposedly an attentive pastor. Appointed in 1775 to a church committee charged with revising paraphrases and hymns for use in public worship, he was the largest contributor to the volume that the committee produced in 1781. Logan held strong whig views in politics, and in the general assembly of 1782 he broke with the moderates by delivering a powerful speech in support of an unsuccessful motion to congratulate the king on the recent change of ministries, from North to Rockingham.<br>
<br>During the 1779&#150;80 college session, and again the following year, Logan delivered at St Mary's Chapel, Edinburgh, lectures on universal history which were, according to the recollection of Adam Smith, &#145;approved and even admired by some of the best and most impartial judges&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Adam Smith</span>, 290). Logan hoped the lectures would establish his credentials for the chair of civil history at Edinburgh; when he heard that Principal William Robertson was supporting Alexander Fraser Tytler, who was appointed to the chair on 16 February 1780, he grew hostile to the principal, whom he subsequently called &#145;that impudent fellow Robertson&#146;  (letter to Carlyle, 12 April 1786, Logan MSS, Edinburgh University). On 10 November 1781, as he prepared to give his course of history lectures for a third time, Logan published, for the benefit of his hearers, <span class="italic">Elements of the Philosophy of History: Part First</span>, an extended outline of his views on the scientific nature of history and the progress of the ancient Greeks and Romans. He intended to add lectures on modern European history (the projected second part of his course), but the third lecture series was abruptly cancelled and the entire enterprise abandoned. In 1787, however, his brief <span class="italic">Dissertation on the Governments, Manners, and Spirit, of Asia</span> appeared in London, with a prefatory advertisement by William Creech (signed W. C.), a co-publisher of both works, identifying it as one of the lectures Logan delivered in Edinburgh in 1780, which Creech had taken down in shorthand on account of &#145;the high approbation which they met with, from a learned and respectable audience&#146;. Like the <span class="italic">Elements</span>, the <span class="italic">Dissertation</span> is highly Eurocentric and dismissive of Asian culture, which it considers conducive only to despotism.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Logan's personal life was unravelling. Always prone to depression, he had also developed a serious drinking problem and had impregnated a servant girl, one Catharine Rogers, who gave birth to a son in 1781  (Donald Grant to Carlyle, 4 Dec 1788, Logan MSS). In March 1781 he went to London to escape the wrath of his parishioners and to arrange for the publication of a volume of poetry. Letters to Carlyle on 18 May and 22 June reveal him to be in a state of suicidal despair as he tries to explain away his alcoholism. Under these circumstances Logan must have received some satisfaction from the success of his <span class="italic">Poems</span>, published by Thomas Cadell in July 1781 and reissued in a second edition the following spring, but that work touched off an intense controversy centring on charges of plagiarism, particularly in regard to the celebrated &#145;Ode to the Cuckoo&#146; which Logan placed at the head of his book. &#145;Cuckoo&#146; had also appeared in the 1770 volume of <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> by Michael Bruce, whose family and friends were adamant that it was his. In the course of an unsuccessful attempt to block the sale of a reprint edition of Bruce's <span class="italic">Poems</span> in 1782, Logan, or his lawyers, claimed that he was the real author of &#145;Cuckoo&#146; and a number of other poems in the 1770 volume, and this point was later supported by Thomas Robertson and Henry Mackenzie, among others. Several pamphlets and articles supporting Logan's authorship of &#145;Cuckoo&#146; also appeared during the 1870s, when the controversy was at its height, but since then the weight of scholarly evidence and opinion has favoured Bruce.<br>
<br>On 2 October 1781 Logan became a member of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, and on 12 June 1782 he donated to that society a copy of his <span class="italic">Poems</span>. The next year he completed a play, <span class="italic">Runnamede</span>, adapted from Voltaire's <span class="italic">Tancr&egrave;de</span>, which Robert Anderson called &#145;the greatest effort of his genius&#146;  (Anderson, 1033), but which Henry Mackenzie considered flawed (though he penned an unused epilogue to it), and which Adam Smith did not admire &#145;in the least&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Adam Smith</span>, 257, 290). It was banned from the stage at Covent Garden because the government considered its speeches on behalf of liberty too inflammatory. Although published in 1783 in London, and the next year performed in Edinburgh, the play proved to be another disappointment to Logan, who donated a copy of the London edition to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland on 27 January 1784.<br>
<br>Authorship of a stage play added to Logan's list of offences in the eyes of pious parishioners, as did the news that he had impregnated a second woman in the parish. Logan found it prudent to leave Scotland in October 1785 for a short-lived career of hack journalism in London, where Old Slaughter's Coffee House was &#145;his common resort of an evening&#146;  (Thompson, 153). Using Hugh Blair as an intermediary he arranged to demit his parish on 27 December 1786 in exchange for an annuity of &pound;40  (<span class="italic">Extracts</span>, 91). In London he worked with Gilbert Stuart on the <span class="italic">English Review</span> and wrote <span class="italic">A Review of the Principal Charges Against Mr. Hastings</span> (1788), a pamphlet so strident in its defence of Warren Hastings that the publisher, John Stockdale, was tried for libel (though acquitted). It is believed that Logan revised his Edinburgh lectures on ancient history from the Egyptians to the Greeks for publication in London in 1788 (second volume, 1791), by the Uxbridge schoolmaster William Rutherford, as <span class="italic">A View of Antient History</span>, which would be, Logan slyly assured Adam Smith on 20 August 1787, &#145;the very best [book] on the Subject&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Adam Smith</span>, 307). In a letter to John Douglas, then bishop of Carlisle, on 9 November 1787, Carlyle recommended Logan for service in the Church of England, but the bishop, having heard stories of his conduct, made it clear in his reply of 25 November that this could not be. Meanwhile Logan's health was deteriorating. On 4 December 1788 the Revd Donald Grant, who would be one of the two executors of his estate, reported to Carlyle from London that Logan was in the last stage of a consumption, and on 6 January 1789 he wrote again to say that &#145;Your poor friend is now freed from all his trouble. He died on Sunday 28th Decr., &amp; was decently &amp; genteely buried under my direction on Friday 2d. Janry&#146;  (Logan MSS). He was just forty years old, and unmarried.<br>
<br>In his will Logan optimistically left &pound;600 for his friends and his two illegitimate children against the sale of his manuscripts, which are listed in a published letter from Thomas Robertson, the second of his executors  (Anderson, 1029). In April 1790 a volume of his <span class="italic">Sermons</span>, including the programme for an entire Lord's supper celebration, was published in Edinburgh by Bell and Bradfute. A second edition was called for before the end of the year, and the following spring a second volume appeared, containing religious lectures as well as sermons; the two-volume set continued to be among the more popular works of its kind in early nineteenth-century Scotland. Both volumes of Logan's <span class="italic">Sermons</span> identify the author as a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh on the title-page, since he had become a fellow at its inception in 1783, and he appears as a non-resident fellow in the first volume of the society's <span class="italic">Transactions</span> (1788). On 14 May 1791 Donald Grant sent Logan's other manuscripts to Bell and Bradfute for evaluation, and on 26 November 1793 Thomas Robertson accepted an offer from that firm, giving the estate two-thirds of the profits in exchange for publication rights. The plan was for Blair (who had edited the <span class="italic">Sermons</span>) and Mackenzie to locate what Blair called &#145;sparks of the Loganic Genius&#146;  (Drescher, 1.166) and produce two large volumes of &#145;Miscellanies in Prose and Verse&#146;, followed by &#145;Lectures on Roman history&#146;. In 1795 Robert Anderson announced that Robertson was planning to publish &#145;a full and candid representation of [Logan] and his writing&#146; in an edition of his &#145;miscellaneous works&#146;  (Anderson, 1027). But none of these publications ever appeared, and it is not known what became of Logan's manuscripts after Mackenzie obtained them following Robertson's death in 1799. Mackenzie's final judgement of the unpublished poetry, plays, and periodical essays was that only the essays &#145;seem to possess enough general merit to entitle them to publication&#146;  (Drescher, 2.196). However, sales of Logan's <span class="italic">Sermons</span>, along with early nineteenth-century editions of his <span class="italic">Poems, and &#145;Runnamede&#146;</span> (first published in 1805 with a biography that is believed to be by Logan's friend, the Revd Robert Douglas of Galashiels), brought the estate enough money to enable Grant to pay out all the legacies specified in Logan's will, including &pound;200 to each of his children when they came of age.<br>
