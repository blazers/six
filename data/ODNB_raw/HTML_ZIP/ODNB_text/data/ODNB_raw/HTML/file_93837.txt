<span class="headword">Ewbank <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ekeblad]</span>,  Inga-Stina</span>  (1932&#150;2004), <span class="occ">literary scholar and translator</span>, was born in Baltak, near Tidaholm, Sweden, on 13 June 1932, the daughter of Gustav Ekeblad (1889&#150;1974) and his wife, Ingeborg, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lindstr&ouml;m (1891&#150;1953), both schoolteachers. She went to school and university in Tidaholm and G&ouml;teborg before in 1950 winning a scholarship to Carleton College, Minnesota, where she took her first degree and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Though she spoke only Swedish until attending Carleton College, she soon became an accomplished linguist who read widely in English, German, and French as well as in the Scandinavian languages that came to her by birth. On graduating she returned to Sweden to take her degree at the University of G&ouml;teborg. During her course it was hinted that some senior members of her faculty thought that it was somewhat inappropriate that a native-born Swede, taking an English and literary history degree, should present herself at her final, entirely oral, examination while speaking English with a pronounced American accent. She took a year <i>in absentia</i>, went to Sheffield, and took an MA under William Empson. As her talents came to be recognized she obtained research posts, first at Liverpool, where she was William Noble fellow from 1955 to 1957, and then at the Shakespeare Institute of Birmingham University, from 1957 to 1960. During the later part of this period she also taught at the University of Munich at the invitation of the doyen of German Shakespeare scholars, W. H. Clemen. In 1959 she married Roger Ewbank (<i>b</i>. 1931), a distinguished vet with special interests in animal behaviour. They had three children, Jane, Christopher (Kit), and Emily.<br>
<br>Inga-Stina Ewbank's early research centred on Elizabethan and Jacobean drama. She wrote notably on George Peele and Thomas Middleton, and was the author of seminal articles on John Webster. But she read widely. Her interest in women's literature was demonstrated in her pioneering (and only) book, <span class="italic">Their Proper Sphere</span> (1960), a study of the Bront&euml; sisters as early Victorian female novelists. She returned to Liverpool as lecturer in 1960, becoming senior lecturer in 1970. In 1972 she became reader in English at Bedford College, London, where she took up the prestigious Hildred Carlile chair in 1974, becoming dean of arts and vice-principal. A distinguished predecessor was Una Ellis-Fermor, an expert on Ibsen whose work, along with Shakespeare's, figured prominently in Ewbank's intellectual life. Her inaugural lecture, &#145;Shakespeare, Ibsen and the unspeakable&#146;, linked these interests, and the move to London facilitated involvement with the theatre. She held strong views on the failure of many translators to render the essentially poetic qualities of Ibsen's language, and was delighted to collaborate with Peter Hall on a translation of <span class="italic">John Gabriel Borkman</span> (1974, published 1975) for the National Theatre, and to work with Dame Peggy Ashcroft and Sir Ralph Richardson on its production. Later she and Hall jointly translated Ibsen's <span class="italic">The Wild Duck</span> (Phoenix Theatre and published, 1990) and she collaborated with John Barton on Ibsen, Katie Mitchell on Strindberg, and Adrian Noble on Ibsen's <span class="italic">Brand</span>.<br>
<br>Deeply unhappy about the merger of Bedford and Royal Holloway colleges, in 1985 Ewbank accepted a chair at the University of Leeds, where she served as head of the school of English. In spite of continuing to live in London she accomplished a prodigious amount of work, much of it in the small (and not so small) hours, some of it on trains. She was famous for her ability to go without sleep as she marked essays and prepared lectures. In great demand as a lecturer and at overseas conferences, she travelled widely, with spells as a visiting scholar at Harvard and other American universities, as Alexander lecturer at Toronto in 1987, and from 1982 to 1997 as a member of the University Grants Committee for Hong Kong. She received an honorary doctorate from Lingnan University, Hong Kong, and the governor's Bauhinia silver star in 1999. Indefatigable in the service of others, she was a working member of the board of the journal <span class="italic">Shakespeare Survey</span> (published by Cambridge University Press) and of the International Shakespeare Conference, editor of several volumes of essays and a contributor to numerous learned journals, and a member throughout her career of innumerable university and other committees. Her distinction as an Ibsenite was recognized by election to the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters in 1991 and the award of honorary doctorates by the universities of Oslo in 1998 and G&ouml;teborg in 2001. She worked increasingly on Ibsen in both England and Norway during her later years and had agreed to edit a volume of his plays for Penguin books at the time of her death.<br>
<br>As a teacher Inga-Stina Ewbank was unsurpassed. She dedicated herself to her students' welfare, personal as well as intellectual, with an unselfconscious generosity that won their affection. She could entrance audiences at every level with the Swedish lilt of her voice, her gentle smile, her confidingly humorous manner, and her ability to convey complex thoughts with total clarity. A compulsive and unrepentant smoker who needed constant potations of strong black coffee, she was thin and nervy, a wittily articulate talker, and a sensitive listener. With her fair hair tied back, her sunken cheeks, and her big eyes, she looked a little like Virginia Woolf. Her admirers might have wished her to take more time off to write the books, especially on Shakespeare's language and the Jacobean drama, for which she was uniquely qualified, but her utter unselfishness stood in the way of personal ambition. Amusing and amusable, irredeemably optimistic, totally without self-importance, unsentimentally charitable, capable of suffering fools with at least apparent equanimity, she enhanced the lives of these who encountered her. After retiring as emeritus professor in 1997 she edited <span class="italic">Catiline</span> for the Cambridge edition of Ben Jonson. She died of cancer at her home in Ealing, London, on 7 June 2004, and was survived by her husband, Roger, and their three children.<br>
