<span class="headword">Dawber, Sir  (Edward) Guy</span>  (1861&#150;1938), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born at King's Lynn, Norfolk, on 3 August 1861, the younger son of John Stockdale Dawber of King's Lynn and his wife, Lois Ellen Edwards. He was educated at King's Lynn grammar school, and was then articled for four years to William Adams, an architect practising in that town. He subsequently moved to Dublin, where he became an assistant in the office of Thomas Deane. There Dawber spent his spare time measuring and sketching the fine Georgian buildings of the city. He had been there only a year when political troubles caused an interruption in building, and so he moved to London to join the office of Ernest George. George had a reputation as a designer of imposing mansions in the country and picturesque houses in the West End of London; and his office was noted as a nursery of genius. In his evenings, at this period, Dawber attended the Royal Academy Schools. In 1887, however, overwork strained his eyes, and George sent him to be clerk of works on a great house at Batsford in Gloucestershire. This apparent interruption to his career proved, in fact, to be his opportunity; for he applied himself with his usual zest to an intensive study of the beautiful but then little-known architecture of the Cotswolds. Soon he decided to begin practice on his own account there, and for his office hired a room in the village institute at Bourton on the Hill, at a rent of 9<i>d</i>. a week. Small commissions began to come to him at once, and in 1891 he opened an office in London. From that date up to the time of his death a steady stream of attractive designs, especially (although not exclusively) for country houses, flowed from his versatile and painstaking pencil. A complete list of them is given in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects</span> for 9 May 1938; typical examples include Nether Swell Manor, Burdocks, and Eyford Park in Gloucestershire, Hamptworth Lodge in Wiltshire, and the Foord almshouses at Rochester.<br>
<br>Honours came freely to Dawber in later life. He was elected ARA in 1927 and RA in 1935; he served as president of the Royal Institute of British Architects between 1925 and 1927, having been elected an associate in 1889 and a fellow in 1903; and he was awarded the royal gold medal for architecture in 1928. He was knighted in 1936. He took a prominent part in establishing in 1926 the Council for the Preservation of Rural England, of which he became vice-president and chairman. A friendly, genial man, looking more like a country squire than an artist, he seemed to typify in his person the spirit of rural England which he understood so well; and his charming country houses and gardens invariably melted into their natural surroundings.<br>
<br>Apart from his consummate skill in the English tradition and his sensitive handling of all the building crafts, Dawber was a talented painter in watercolour, whose sketches showed a luminous quality far removed from prosaic architectural drawing. He contributed notes and sketches to two books illustrating <span class="italic">Old Cottages and Farm-Houses in Kent and Sussex</span> (1900) and <span class="italic">Old Cottages, Farm-Houses, and other Stone Buildings in the Cotswold District</span> (1905).<br>
<br>In 1896 Dawber married Mary, daughter of Alexander Eccles, of Roby, near Liverpool, who survived him. They had no children. He died at home at 64 Hamilton Terrace, London, on 24 April 1938.<br>
