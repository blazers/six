<span class="headword">Bishop,  John</span>  (1797&#150;1873), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, the fourth son of Samuel Bishop, of Pimperne, Dorset, was born on 15 September 1797 and educated at the grammar school at Childe Okeford in Dorset. It was originally intended that he should have a career in the legal profession, but this came to nothing and for many years he led the life of a country gentleman. When he was about twenty-five years old he was persuaded by his cousin, John Tucker, a surgeon of Bridport, to enter the medical profession. After a short time working with Tucker at Bridport, he moved to London and studied at St George's Hospital under Sir Everard Home. He also attended the lectures of Sir Charles Bell, George James Guthrie, and George Pearson, and he was a regular attendant at the chemistry courses which were delivered at the Royal Institution. Bishop became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1824 and an honorary fellow in 1843. He was an elected member of the college council (1849&#150;61), and in 1852 he became president of the Medical Society of London.<br>
<br>Bishop soon acquired a reputation as a careful and skilled observer. This secured him the offices of senior surgeon to the Islington Dispensary and surgeon to the Northern and St Pancras dispensaries and to the Drapers' Benevolent Institution. In 1844 he contributed a paper to the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span>, on the physiology of the human voice. In the same year he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and he became a corresponding member of the medical societies of Berlin and Madrid. The Royal Academy of Science of Paris awarded him two prizes for his memoirs entitled &#145;The human and comparative anatomy and physiology of voice&#146;; <span class="italic">Experimental Researches into the Physiology of the Human Voice</span> appeared in 1836. Bishop was also the author of <span class="italic">On Articulate Sounds</span> (1851) and <span class="italic">Researches into the Pathology and Treatment of Deformities in the Human Body</span> (1852). These works were considered remarkable for their careful examinations and for the mathematical demonstrations given of each theory advanced. Bishop contributed the articles &#145;Larynx&#146;, &#145;Motion&#146;, and &#145;Voice&#146; to Robert Bentley Todd's <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology</span>. He delivered the Hunterian oration at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1861, but was not considered to be an eloquent or fluent speaker.<br>
<br>Bishop was a man of varied attainments; he was knowledgeable about continental as well as English literature, and up until a few months of his death he was deeply interested in the progress of science. In later years his health began to fail: he lost an eye, and broke an arm while trying to apprehend a pick-pocket in London's Regent Street. Bishop, who was married twice, died on 29 September 1873 at Strangeways House, Marnhull, Dorset, within a few miles of his birthplace; he left a widow, Sarah Hilton Bishop, but no children.<br>
