<span class="headword">Williams,  Charles Frederick</span>  (1838&#150;1904), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born at Coleraine on 4 May 1838. He claimed descent on his father's side from Worcestershire yeomen (of Tenbury and Mamble), on his mother's from Scottish settlers in Ulster. Having been educated at Belfast Academy under Dr Reuben Bryce and at a Greenwich private school under Dr Goodwin, he went for his health to the southern states of America, where he took part in a filibustering expedition to Nicaragua, saw some hard fighting, and reportedly won the reputation of a daring blockade-runner. On his return to England he became in 1859 a keen volunteer, and was engaged as leader writer for the London <span class="italic">Evening Herald</span>. In October 1859 he began a connection with <span class="italic">The Standard</span> that lasted until 1884. From 1860 to 1863 he was the first editor of the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>, and from 1881 to 1884 was the first editor of the <span class="italic">Evening News</span>.<br>
<br>Williams did his best work as a war correspondent. For <span class="italic">The Standard</span> he was at the headquarters of the French army of the Loire at the beginning of the second phase of the Franco-Prussian War (1870), and was one of the first two correspondents in Strasbourg after its fall. In the summer and autumn of 1877 he was correspondent on the staff of Ahmad Mukhtar Pasha, who commanded the Turkish forces in Armenia. Williams remained almost constantly at the front, and his letters were the only continuous series to reach England. He published them in a revised and extended form as <span class="italic">The Armenian Campaign</span> (1878), which, though pro-Turkish, was a largely accurate record. He followed Mukhtar to European Turkey, and described his defence of the lines of Constantinople against the Russians. He was with General Skobelev at the headquarters of the Russian army when the treaty of San Stefano was signed in March 1878, and he reported the Berlin Congress. At the end of 1878 he was in Afghanistan reporting the war, and in 1879 published <span class="italic">Notes on the Operations in Lower Afghanistan, 1878&#150;9, with Special Reference to Transport</span>.<br>
<br>Williams accompanied the Gordon relief expedition in the autumn of 1884 for the Central News Agency. When his boat capsized in the Nile he and Frederic Villiers narrowly escaped being drowned, or killed by crocodiles; they were rescued by a naval pinnace. A truculent controversialist, Williams was, according to Aaron Watson, &#145;in the habit of hitting out very savagely and remorselessly against his opponents &hellip; a man of restless, stormy and combative temperament, always driving at full speed&#146;  (Watson, 201). While in the Sudan he quarrelled with Henry H. S. Pearse of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, and later unsuccessfully sued him. The failure to save Gordon was an emotive and bitter issue. In May 1885 Williams published a polemical article in the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>, &#145;How we lost Gordon&#146;, exonerating Wolseley and blaming primarily Sir Charles Wilson, who, he alleged, was unfit for command, lost his nerve, disobeyed Wolseley's orders, and fatally delayed sending the steamers to Khartoum. Wilson replied in the press. Both he and Williams were then criticized in an anonymous <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> article, which alleged Williams had acted in a manner prejudicial to army discipline and should have been punished, &#145;tied by the wrists to the tail of an ammunition waggon&#146;  (27 June 1885, p. 844). Williams sued the proprietor and was awarded &pound;300 in damages.<br>
<br>After leaving <span class="italic">The Standard</span> in 1884, Williams was for some time connected with the <span class="italic">Morning Advertiser</span>, but soon became war correspondent of the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span>. He was the only British correspondent with the Bulgarian army under Prince Alexander in the brief war with Serbia in 1885. In the Graeco-Turkish War of 1897 he was attached to the Greek army in Thessaly. In an article in the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> (June 1897) he attributed the Greek defeat to the disastrous influence of politics. His last war reporting was on Kitchener's Sudanese campaign of 1898. He accompanied General Gatacre up the Nile on his way to join the British brigade in January, and sent the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span> a vivid account of the battle of Omdurman and the recapture of Khartoum in September 1898. He protested against the military censorship of war correspondents. His health did not permit of his going to South Africa, but he wrote in London a diary of the South African War for the <span class="italic">Morning Leader</span>.<br>
<br>Williams was a strong adherent of Wolseley's military views and policy, and had considerable military knowledge. According to his friend Sir John French, Williams was &#145;as fine a judge and critic of military operations as it is possible for any man who is not a professional soldier to become&#146;  (Herbert, vi). He published much on military subjects in the <span class="italic">United Service Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">National Review</span>, and other periodicals. In 1892 he published a controversial <span class="italic">Life of Sir H. Evelyn Wood</span>, in which he defended Wood's action after Majuba in 1881. In 1902 he published a substantial pamphlet, <span class="italic">Hushed Up</span>, in which he protested against the proposed limited official inquiry into the South African War and called for a thorough investigation. A bitter Wolseleyite polemic, it attacked the government, Kitchener, and especially Roberts&#151;alleging <i>inter alia</i> that &#145;his indifference to the feeding and clothing of his men and his neglect of sanitary precautions were the main causes of the loss of life &hellip; from enteric and dysentery&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hushed Up</span>, 100)&#151;and praised Wolseley and Buller (partly anticipating late twentieth-century revisionist historians).<br>
<br>Williams also tried his hand at fiction, and wrote &#145;Songs for Soldiers&#146;. He wrote on ecclesiastical questions, and contributed articles and stories to <span class="italic">Temple Bar</span> and other periodicals. He was a zealous churchman, and, as a thank-offering for his safe return from Khartoum, presented to Bishop Creighton an ivory and gold mitre designed by himself. A right-wing tory, in 1886 Williams stood unsuccessfully as a Conservative candidate against Herbert Gladstone in the largely working-class and Liberal West Leeds constituency. Although of irascible temper, Williams was chairman of the London district of the Institute of Journalists in 1893&#150;4, and was president in 1896&#150;7 of the Press Club, of which he was founder. He died in lodgings at 70B Hackford Road, Brixton, London, on 9 February 1904.<br>
