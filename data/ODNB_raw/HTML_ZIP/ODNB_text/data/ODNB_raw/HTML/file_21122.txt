<span class="headword">Paget,  William</span>, fifth Baron Paget  (1572&#150;1629), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21118/', "Thomas Paget, fourth Baron Paget (c.1544&#150;1590)")</script>, and Nazareth, widow of Sir Thomas Southwell of Norfolk and youngest daughter of Sir John Newton of East Harptree, Somerset, and Barre's Court, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Sir Anthony Poyntz. His father was attainted for treason in 1586 and in 1587 the conviction was confirmed by statute, whereby the barony and family estates were forfeited. On 27 April 1587 Elizabeth I, &#145;of her gracious favor and princely care for the good educacion of yonge William Pagett&#146;, made him a ward of Sir George Carey, her kinsman  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1586&#150;7</i>, 352). In 1587 he matriculated at Oxford, where he attended Christ Church; he graduated BA on 25 February 1590. He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 20 February 1611. Paget married, before 19 June 1602, Lettice Knollys (<i>d</i>. 1655) of Kingsbury, Warwickshire. They had three sons&#151;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21123/', "William Paget")</script> (who was to succeed his father as sixth Baron Paget), Henry, and Thomas&#151;and four daughters, one of whom was called Anne [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70274/', "Waller, Anne")</script>].<br>
<br>During the 1590s Paget was knighted, saw active military service on the earl of Essex's Cadiz expedition of 1596, and was one of the gentlemen who accompanied Sir Robert Cecil on his embassy to Paris in 1598. When Cecil returned to England, Paget travelled to Italy, which troubled his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21103/', "Charles Paget")</script> because it &#145;may prejudice him&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1598&#150;1601</i>, 43). In 1597 William Paget petitioned to rent his attainted father's forfeited lands, and in July he and his heirs were granted lordships and manors in Middlesex and Buckinghamshire and other lands in Staffordshire, all of which had belonged to Thomas Paget and which had a rental value of &pound;1053 19<i>s</i>. 10<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub><i>d</i>. Paget and other Staffordshire gentlemen, &#145;frequenters to the earl of Essex&#146;, were suspected of complicity or at least sympathy with his rebellion in February 1601  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 11.34). No action, however, seems to have been taken against them.<br>
<br>Paget was restored in blood and honours by James I and this was confirmed by statute in 1604. Not everyone approved. Ralph Fetherstonhalgh wrote, in November 1603, &#145;What! say they, hath not the King restored Arundel, Westmoreland and Paget, all of them known favourers, if not professors of the Romish religion&#146;. Lord Saye and Sele wrote, &#145;I gave no consent to Mr. Pagett's bill&#146;, because of &#145;my duty to God&#146; and his remembrance of the late queen  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 15.283; 16.63). From 5 November 1605 to 1628 Paget was summoned to parliament as Baron Paget. He was one of those peers who protested against the creation of a large number of baronets (1618) and of Scottish and Irish nobles (1621). In May 1628 he also spoke at length in the House of Lords against a proposed saving clause to be added to the petition of right.<br>
<br>Paget was widely involved in the promotion of colonial trade, through the East India Company, and in colonial projects: as a councillor of the Virginia Company (1612) and of the Amazon River Company until the surrender of its charter (1620), and as a commissioner of the new board for Virginia in June 1624. He was also a founder member of the Bermudas Company (1614) to colonize the Somers Islands, where his name was given to a fort and a people. Despite these endeavours he appears to have been in a permanent state of indebtedness. In 1620 he called himself &#145;the poorest man of his rank &hellip; endeavouring to pay off great debts to the King&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1619&#150;23</i>, 196). He died at West Drayton, Middlesex, on 29 August 1629 and was buried there the next day. His will required that his younger children &#145;be instructed to serve God after the rule of the Religion professed at this daie in the Church of England and in no otherwise&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/154, sig. 110).<br>
