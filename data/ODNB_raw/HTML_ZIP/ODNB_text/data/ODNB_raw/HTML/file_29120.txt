<span class="headword">Weston,  Elizabeth Jane</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1581?, <em>d.</em> 1612), <span class="occ">Latin poet</span>, was born in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, on 2 November 1582 according to information on her tombstone; but an undated record of her baptism appears in the parish register between records dated 4 March and 31 October 1581, respectively, and a date within this period would accord better with her statement (in a poem on the death of her mother) that she was some six months old when her father died. She was the second of two children of John Weston (identified only as &#145;clark&#146; in the record of his burial on 6 May 1582) and Jane Cooper (<i>bap</i>. 1563). Her mother subsequently married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15289/', "Edward Kelley")</script>, associate of Doctor John Dee, and accompanied him in 1583 to Poland and eventually to Prague, where Kelley was appointed alchemist to the emperor, Rudolph II. Elizabeth and her brother John Francis (1580&#150;1600) apparently remained behind with their grandmothers before joining their mother and new stepfather in Prague a few years later.<br>
<br>Weston was later to thank a John Hammonius, or Hammond, for teaching her Latin (this may be the John Hammond whom John Dee had employed as tutor in Trebon in 1588), but beyond this nothing is known of her formal education, though her brother was schooled locally at the Clementine College and then sent to the University of Ingolstadt in 1598. Kelley prospered at first in Rudolph's service, receiving the title of <i>eques aureus</i>; but his fortunes turned for the worse after a duel in 1591 when he killed a member of the court. A series of prison stays ensued, with rumours of attempts at escape and even of a suicide in prison with the assistance of his family.<br>
<br>Kelley's death some time about 1597 left his family destitute, with their properties in the hands of creditors. At this point Weston began to compose the many letters and lyrics (all of them in Latin; no document has survived in any of the modern languages that she was said to have mastered) which she addressed to members of the court and to other learned members of the international republic of neo-Latin letters who might be able to intercede for her with Rudolph.<br>
<br>The pathos of Weston's position&#151;as an orphaned &#145;Virgo Angla&#146; with widowed mother and sickly brother away at university&#151;awakened enthusiastic responses of chivalric empathy from a wide range of European humanists. That she was able to express her anguish clearly and simply in elegiac distichs that generally avoided straining after arcane allusions suited her maidenly image and led her to be acclaimed as a tenth Muse, a fourth Grace, a new Sappho or Theano. The librarian at Heidelberg, Paul Melissus, sent her a laurel wreath and thereby formally welcomed her into the circle of laureated humanist poets. A Silesian aristocrat, George Martinius von Baldhoven, undertook to edit and collect her writings, first in a two-book volume, <span class="italic">Po&euml;mata</span> (1602), and subsequently (<i>c</i>.1607) in an expanded three-book collection of her poems and letters which he entitled <span class="italic">Parthenica</span>, or &#145;Maidenly writings&#146;, even though in the meantime (April 1603) she had married the jurist Johannes Leo, an agent of the duke of Brunswick and prince of Anhalt.<br>
<br>Manuscript verses, addressed to the reader and signed &#145;Elisabetha Joanna, Uxor Joannis Leonis in Aula Imperiali Agentis, ex Familia Westoniorum, Angla&#146; and dated 16 August 1610, appear in two copies of <span class="italic">Parthenica</span>, one in Prague and the other in the British Library. In them Weston complains that all her writings have been categorized as &#145;maidenly&#146; even when written after her marriage, and she hopes that a more accurate edition, purged of the many errors that have crept into this one, may emerge with the passage of time.<br>
<br>Kelley's disgrace at the time of his death presumably accounts for Weston's almost total failure to mention him by name in her writings; references to her nobility have been taken to link her with a noble line of Westons (one of whom presumably, recusant and/or spendthrift, died in Prague), when in fact they must refer to Kelley's Rudolphine title. It was not until Karel Hrdina discovered a unique copy of the pamphlet lamenting the death of her mother and reported it in 1928 that Weston's connection to Kelley became known to readers of Czech; and not until 1990 that J. W. Binns made this information more readily available to readers of English.<br>
<br>Baldhoven's addition of letters to and from Weston in <span class="italic">Parthenica</span> gives a fuller picture of Weston's position in the humanist world than is seen from the poems alone in the 1602 volume. Poems to influential men in the Rudolphine court usually appear without answering poems or letters, or are sent with a letter to a mutual friend who is asked to intercede on her behalf. Her correspondents outside the court, on the other hand, are typically seen responding to requests (often from Baldhoven himself) for poems to include in the forthcoming volume, and they usually ask for similar poems by her in return, for the same reason. Some of these correspondents are connected to Paracelsian circles and may have been associated with Kelley, such as Oswald Croll who asks for a poem to include in his forthcoming <span class="italic">Basilica chymica</span> (1609). Weston's possible involvement in her stepfather's alchemical projects is hinted in letters to her brother; and the esotericism of Rudolph's circle may have been part of her appeal to scholars outside Prague, who could also understand her anxious dependence on a patronage that continued to elude her.<br>
<br>In one of her poems Weston develops parallels between her condition and that of Ovid in his <span class="italic">Tristia</span>, rejected by his emperor and forced to live far from his native land, all because of some mysterious scandal. The conflicting explanations of Ovid's own exile&#151;whether because of his scandalous <span class="italic">Art of Love</span> or because of his knowledge of some scandal at court&#151;are deftly echoed to hint at Weston's own fate, as a victim of her stepfather's disgrace or perhaps blamed for her own &#145;art&#146; that speaks out against envious courtiers who begrudge her mother and herself their rightful property. In this way, Weston makes her own position (with its need for prudent suppression of details) expressive of the hopes and frustrations of life at the centre of an imperial court.<br>
<br>Although her correspondents frequently ask Weston to send a portrait of herself, few images of her have been identified. An engraved portrait by Balzer appears in F. Pelcel's biography of her  (<span class="italic">Abbildungen b&ouml;hmischer und m&auml;hrischer Gelehrten</span>, 1777, 3.77); a more reliable contemporary likeness may be the anonymous portrait bearing her name in the Hessisches Landesmuseum, Darmstadt (inventory number Hz.1696).<br>
<br>Weston died of consumption in Prague on 23 November 1612, having borne seven children, three daughters who survived her and four sons who did not. Her tomb in the church of St Thomas in Prague bears a eulogistic epitaph along with the date of her death and a precise (if mistaken) statement of her age as being thirty years and three weeks.<br>
