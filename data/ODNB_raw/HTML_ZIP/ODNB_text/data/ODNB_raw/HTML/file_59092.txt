<span class="headword">Lade,  Michael</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1737, <em>d.</em> 1799), <span class="occ">racehorse owner and miser</span>, was baptized at St Peter and St Paul's church, Boughton under Blean, Kent, on 10 July 1737, the son of Michael Lade and his second wife Elizabeth Dadd, the daughter of Thomas Adams, and widow of David Dadd of Boughton. From 1748 he was educated at King's School, Canterbury, and after April 1755 at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1759. On 1 April 1757 he was admitted to the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the bar on 6 February 1761. On 10 November 1773 he married Sophia, Lady Cranstoun (<i>d</i>. 1799), the widow of James Cranstoun, sixth Baron Cranstoun, and daughter of Jeremiah Brown of Abscourt, Surrey. Seven years later he stood as MP for Canterbury but polled just 28 votes. In May 1787 he took the lease of Cannon Park, Kingsclere, Hampshire. He was soon racing horses, but only at nearby meetings to save money. His first appearance in the sporting press in 1794 set the tone for most future comment. His racing groom and jockey, John Scott, had sued for unpaid wages, an action which Lade, as a lawyer, stopped by an injunction in the exchequer. Scott had to have this put aside at Hampshire assizes, where an agreed arbiter ordered the payment to Scott of the considerable sum of &pound;165 as damages and all legal costs.<br>
<br>Lade made two excursions to Newmarket, where he enjoyed his one and only major success as a racing man by winning the important Oatland Stakes in 1797 with his bay colt by Dungannon out of Letitia. There then followed an impressive list of failures&#151;at Ascot Heath, Stockbridge, Burford, Egham, and Reading. Newmarket in the following year proved equally disastrous and Lade died some months later with his stable completely neglected and his horses looking so wretched at auction that many went for only 2 or 3 guineas.<br>
<br>Personally, Lade was as unattractive as his horses. He appeared to have few if any friends, and was reported as seldom seen in company on the racecourse or anywhere else; he was also said to be &#145;cynically rigid and innately parsimonious&#146;. His obituary in the <span class="italic">Sporting Magazine</span> pulled no punches and referred both to his titled wife who brought him some &pound;5000 a year but who was mentally incapacitated, and to the ladies he kept in Pall Mall and at Turnham Green, though &#145;he was a total stranger to the powers of attraction and we may safely presume that <i>his amours</i> were regulated much more (on the part of the ladies) by interest than affection&#146;. His will (proved 7 February 1800) referred to his relationship with Bevilia Gordon (<i>d</i>. 1816) to whom he left property and with whom he had a daughter Anne Maria Gordon. In short, &#145;he <i>lived</i> without regard, so he <i>died</i> without <i>regret</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sporting Magazine</span>, vol. 15). His wife, Sophia, died on 26 October 1799; Lade died, probably at his London address, Stamford Brook, Hammersmith, in late November and was buried with his wife at St James's Church, Westminster, on 2 December 1799.<br>
