<span class="headword">Brame <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Law]</span>,  Charlotte Mary</span>  (1836&#150;1884), <span class="occ">novelist and benefactor</span>, was born on 1 November 1836, at Rosary House, 35 Castle Street, Hinckley, Leicestershire, the eldest of the nine children of Benjamin Law (1814&#150;1859), superintendent registrar and clerk to the Poor Law Union, and his wife, Charlotte (1814&#150;1877), sister of Robert Heathcoat. Charlotte Brame's parents were devout Roman Catholics, and at Charlotte's birth they were master and matron of the workhouse. Although well-to-do by most standards, the family never forgot the poor; Charlotte's father was a generous benefactor and she followed his example throughout her life. Her father was also the local correspondent for the <span class="italic">Leicester Journal</span>, and encouraged his daughter to write; she published her poems in the local press from an early age. Initial fears for Charlotte's health prompted a baptism by a lay person which was regularized a year later, and poor health was to dominate the rest of her life. Early education in Hinckley was followed by convent schools in Bristol and Preston and by a finishing school in Paris. On her return to England, Charlotte secured positions as a governess in Dover, Brighton, and then Leicestershire. It was at this time that she wrote and submitted stories to the Roman Catholic periodical <span class="italic">The Lamp</span>.<br>
<br>Charlotte's character was described at her death as<blockquote>one of the brightest, best and most estimable of women, purely noble and charming to a fault. She possessed a cheerful mind, a vivid poetic imagination, was gifted with a wonderful memory and had keen perception and insight into character. She had a glowing passionate love of flowers and had in society a marvellous conversational power and charm. (<span class="italic">Leicester Chronicle</span>, 29 Nov 1884)</blockquote>On 7 January 1863 Charlotte married Phillip Edward Brame (1839&#150;1886), a London-based jeweller and the son of John Brame, a Baptist minister. He was never an astute businessman, however, and his business fortunes declined along with his health and sanity. He was given to drinking and his behaviour became increasingly erratic, so that Charlotte was impelled to write, in order to support the family. Her stories appeared in popular weekly publications such as <span class="italic">Bow Bells</span>, the <span class="italic">London Reader</span>, and the <span class="italic">Family Herald</span>. She was incredibly prolific, writing somewhere in the region of 130 novels during her lifetime. Charlotte Brame's fiction was invariably set in English country houses, and her characters were beautiful and wealthy heiresses, eligible bachelors, and aged and wise matriarchs. Against this milieu, she reworked the theme of love in all of its multifarious aspects&#151;old love, young love, jealousy, suspicion, misalliance, and improvident marriage. High morals such as honour, a sense of duty, and self-sacrifice are lauded as the greatest of virtues. The books also contain strong descriptive passages, some of which are drawn from her associations with Leicestershire.<br>
<br>The Brame family settled at 1 Albert Street and 42 Delancey Street, Camden Town, London. Charlotte had nine pregnancies, but only four of her children lived to maturity, all of which took a toll on her own already less than robust health. She secured a permanent position on the staff of the <span class="italic">Family Herald</span>, but business failure forced the family to move to Cheetham, Manchester, where they lived first at 68 York Street and then 47 Elizabeth Street. For health reasons the family then moved to Brighton. The only existing handwriting by Charlotte Brame are three letters in which she describes fears over failing health, worries about family finances, and expressions of loneliness. The family returned to Rosary House, Hinckley, in 1879. Charlotte continued to write, sending manuscripts to the London editors, and, in spite of her domestic concerns, she performed many acts of charity.<br>
<br>Charlotte Brame's death at Rosary House, on 25 November 1884, was unexpected and painful. Large numbers attended her funeral before interment in Ashby Road cemetery, Hinckley. She died owing money and all her children were taken into guardianship at her death. As a tragic sequel, Phillip Brame committed suicide in May 1886. A commemorative blue plaque was set on her house and a brass memorial plaque was placed in St Peter's Church, Hinckley.<br>
<br>During her lifetime, Charlotte Brame did not receive the income to which she was entitled because her stories were shamelessly pirated in America, especially in the <span class="italic">New York Weekly</span>, many appearing under imposed pseudonyms such as Bertha M. Clay, Caroline M. Barton, and Mrs Florence Norton. Her books were extremely popular, and continued to attract a worldwide audience into the twentieth century. Translations were made into Spanish, Polish, and Arabic. Several of the works were dramatized, and two of the Bertha Clay titles were used as the basis for films; <span class="italic">Wife in Name Only</span> (1923) starred Tyrone Power. A contemporary contributor to the <span class="italic">Family Reader</span>, Charles Garvice, reproduced some of Charlotte Brame's works, and during the 1940s and 1950s Wright and Brown reprinted a large number of the titles. The Lythway Press, in the 1960s, also reprinted several of the stories, and other editions have appeared. Her enduring if unobtrusive presence is indicated by a passing reference in Frank McCourt's <span class="italic">Angela's Ashes</span> (1996):<blockquote>Mam says she wants to join the Library too, but it's a long walk from Laman's house, two miles, and would I mind getting her a book every week, a romance by Charlotte M Brame or any other nice writer.</blockquote>In her short lifetime, Charlotte Brame was one of the unsung women authors of the nineteenth century. Her literary endeavours, in a male-dominated field, her works of charity, and her personal stamina and resilience, in the face of family tragedy and ill health, represent a triumph in adversity.<br>
