<span class="headword">Baxter,  Richard</span>  (1615&#150;1691), <span class="occ">ejected minister and religious writer</span>, was born in the village of Rowton, Shropshire, on 12 November 1615, the son of Richard Baxter (<i>d</i>. 1663) of Eaton Constantine, Shropshire, and his wife, Beatrice Adeney (<i>d</i>. 1635). He was baptized in the parish church at High Ercall the following Sunday, 19 November.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducation"></a>Early years and education</h2>Baxter described his father as &#145;a mean Freeholder (called a Gentleman for his Ancestors sake, but of small Estate)&#146; and &#145;entangled by Debts&#146; as a result, at least in part, of his &#145;having been addicted to Gaming in his Youth, and his Father [also Richard] before him&#146; (Baxter, <span class="italic">Breviate</span>, 1; <span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.1). These impoverished circumstances may help to explain why Baxter was brought up until the age of ten or eleven not at Eaton Constantine but by his maternal grandparents in their home at Rowton. &#145;The bare reading of the Scriptures in private&#146;, however, led his father to reform his manner of life so thoroughly that he came to be &#145;reviled commonly by the Name of <i>Puritan</i>, <i>Precisian</i> and <i>Hypocrite</i>&#146;. Even before he moved to his parents' home, Baxter was deeply affected by his father's &#145;serious speeches of God and the Life to come&#146;. He afterwards acknowledged his father as &#145;the Instrument of my first Convictions, and Approbation of a Holy Life&#146;. That his father, who &#145;never scrupled Common-Prayer or Ceremonies, nor spake against Bishops&#146;, was reviled merely &#145;for reading Scripture &hellip; and for praying &hellip; in his House, and for reproving Drunkards and Swearers, and for talking sometimes a few words of Scripture and the Life to come&#146;, persuaded the young Baxter that hostility to puritanism was bred of &#145;mere Malice&#146; and that &#145;Godly People were the best&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.2&#150;3).<br>
<br>Baxter gives a dismal account of his education. At Rowton, each of a succession of four &#145;readers&#146; at the chapel was ignorant, and two led immoral lives. At Eaton Constantine the school was taught by ill-educated, dissolute, and uninterested curates, one of them holding forged orders. However, when Baxter transferred to Wroxeter (afterwards Donnington) grammar school, then only recently founded in 1627, he at last received some regular tuition from the schoolmaster John Owen. His fellow pupils included Richard Allestree, afterwards regius professor of divinity at Oxford and provost of Eton College, and Francis and Andrew Newport, sons of the school's patron Sir Richard Newport, afterwards first Baron Newport of Eyton-on-Severn, Shropshire. At the age of sixteen Baxter was persuaded by Owen not to pursue his studies at university but instead to put himself under the instruction of Owen's friend Richard Wickstead at Ludlow, where Wickstead was chaplain to the council in the marches of Wales. The arrangement was not a success. Baxter found Wickstead negligent and ill-equipped for advanced tuition, and he did not care for the town, &#145;full of Temptations, through the multitude of Persons, (Counsellors, Attorneys, Officers, and Clerks), and much given to tipling and excess&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.4). When after eighteen months Baxter returned home, he for three months supplied as schoolmaster the place of Wickstead, sick with what proved to be a fatal consumption, and then, perhaps at Sir Richard Newport's suggestion, he journeyed to London and was introduced to society and to court life by Sir Henry Herbert, the <i>de facto</i> master of the revels, a first cousin of Newport. Baxter found London no more congenial than Ludlow and returned to the midlands after only a month to attend his mother during the winter of 1634&#150;5 in what proved to be her final illness. She died on 10 May 1635.<br>
<br>After the death of Baxter's mother his father married in 1636 Mary Huncks, daughter of Sir Thomas Huncks and sister of Sir Fulke and Sir Henry Huncks, respectively royalist governors of Shrewsbury and of Banbury during the civil war, and a first cousin of Edward, second Viscount Conway (<i>d</i>. 1655), and his sister, Brilliana Harley. Baxter regarded his stepmother with great affection and admiration, speaking of her as &#145;a Special Blessing to our Family&#146; and a woman of &#145;extraordinary holiness&#146; who lived &#145;in the greatest Mortification, Austerity to her Body, and constancy of Prayer and all Devotion, of any one that ever I knew&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.12, 3.189). In the later 1650s she and his father lived with Baxter for a time at Kidderminster when the house at Eaton Constantine was let to a tenant. As a widow she lived in the house at Eaton Constantine, and then, in the 1670s, with Baxter in Totteridge and in London; she died of cancer in August 1680 at the age of ninety-six.<br>
<br>Baxter's own &#145;vehement desires&#146; had been to proceed from school to university to achieve &#145;Academick Glory&#146;, and throughout his life he regretted his lack of a university education and pointed to his &#145;wanting Academical Honours&#146; as a mark of his insufficiency as a minister (Baxter, <span class="italic">Poetical Fragments</span>, 42; <span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.85). In 1681 he wrote in reply to an enquiry from Anthony Wood that his &#145;faults are no disgrace to any University; for I was of none, &amp; have little but what I had out of books, &amp; inconsiderable helpes of Country tutors&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 2.225). Nevertheless, though lacking in formal qualifications and without the benefit of educational supervision, through omnivorous reading Baxter became one of the most learned of seventeenth-century divines. As a youth it was through books that he realized his vocation. Baxter underwent no single life-transforming moment of spiritual regeneration. In such later writings as <span class="italic">The Right Method for a Settled Peace of Conscience</span> (1653) he was to caution against depending for evidence of election upon a profound conversion experience, such as many contemporary guides to godliness held to be an essential mark of grace. As a young man he was himself troubled that he could not &#145;distinctly trace the Workings of the Spirit upon my heart in that method which Mr. [Robert] <i>Bolton</i>, Mr. [Thomas] <i>Hooker</i>, Mr. [John] <i>Rogers</i>, and other Divines describe nor knew the Time of my Conversion, being wrought on by &hellip; Degrees&#146;. This experience convinced him that &#145;<i>Education</i> is God's ordinary way for the Conveyance of his Grace&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.6&#150;7). For Baxter, reading was the means of conveyance. His father encouraged him as a child to read the historical books of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and, when at school, it was through &#145;an old torn&#146; copy of Edmund Bunny's protestant revision of the Jesuit Robert Parsons's <span class="italic">A Booke of Christian Exercise Appertayning to Resolution</span> (1584), which was lent to his father by &#145;a poor Day-Labourer&#146;, through <span class="italic">The Bruised Reede and Smoaking Flax</span> (1630) by Richard Sibbes, which his father purchased from &#145;a poor Pedlar&#146;, and through a servant's copy of &#145;a little Piece of Mr. [William] <i>Perkins's</i> Works&#146; that &#145;without any means but Books&#146; God was &#145;pleased to resolve me for himself&#146;  (ibid., 1.3&#150;4). Subsequently Ezekiel Culverwell's <span class="italic">Treatise of Faith</span> (1623):<blockquote>did me much good, and many other excellent Books, were made my Teachers and Comforters: And the use that God made of Books, above Ministers, to the benefit of my Soul, made me somewhat excessively in love with good Books. (ibid., 1.5)</blockquote>The excitement of reading and of intellectual discovery led Baxter to engross himself in the medieval schoolmen and in contemporary doctrinal debate: &#145;I was quickly past my Fundamentals, and was running up into a multitude of Controversies, and greatly delighted with metaphysical and scholastick Writings&#146; because &#145;I thought they narrowly searched after Truth, and brought Things out of the darkness of Confusion&#146;. Subsequently, however, he came to lay &#145;smaller stress &hellip; upon these Controversies and Curiosities&#146; and to value most highly &#145;the fundamental Doctrines of the Catechism&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.126). He always afterwards maintained that a person of true devotion and practical faith who &#145;yet never heard of most of the Questions in <i>Scotus</i>, or <i>Ockham</i> or <i>Aquinas</i>'s sums, is far richer in knowledg, and a much wiser man, than he that hath those Controversies at his fingers ends&#146;  (Baxter, <span class="italic">Directions</span>, 1.106&#150;7). And yet, though he felt himself &#145;much better in [George] <i>Herberts</i> Temple: Or in a heavenly Treatise of <i>faith</i> and <i>Love</i>&#146; than engaged in controversial divinity, he was repeatedly drawn into disputation and he retained all his life a good deal of the schoolman's fondness for nice distinctions and multiplying subdivisions: &#145;I could never from my first Studies endure Confusion!&#146;, he wrote  (Baxter, <span class="italic">Knowledge and Love Compared</span>, 9). One side of him remained inveterately bookish. His recommendations of particular titles often developed into extended reading lists. In <span class="italic">A Christian Directory</span> (1673) he lists somewhere in the region of 1000 authors and works to make up &#145;The <i>Poor mans Library</i>, which &hellip; cometh short of a Rich and Sumptuous Library&#146;  (Baxter, <span class="italic">Christian Directory</span>, bk 3, question 174, pp. 921&#150;8). As might be expected, he himself assembled an extensive and dearly prized collection which, even after losses due to removals and distraints, still numbered more than 1400 volumes at his death.<br>
<br>Though books played such a large part in his early life, Baxter does acknowledge also the influence upon him in these formative years of four local Shropshire ministers: Humphrey Barnet, curate of Uppington; George Baxter (no relation), rector of Little Wenlock; Francis Garbett, vicar of Wroxeter; and &#145;especially old Mr. <i>Samuel Smith</i>&#146;, curate of Cressage  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.9). The churchmanship of these men was subsequently of a presbyterian temper, but, with the exception of Barnet, they conformed in the 1630s to the ceremonies of the established episcopal church. At Shrewsbury, however, Baxter, now in his early twenties, encountered men far less willing to tolerate the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>: they included Walter Cradock; George Fawler, in 1643 appointed chaplain of Bridewell Hospital, London; Michael Old, whose house at Sheriffhales, on the Shropshire&#150;Staffordshire border, was licensed for nonconformist worship in 1672; and the schoolmaster Richard Symonds. Baxter was not convinced by their arguments against conformity, and he came to disapprove strongly of enthusiasm such as Cradock's (&#145;a gross Antinomian&#146;, he afterwards called him), but the &#145;fervent Prayers and savoury Conference and Holy Lives&#146; of these &#145;very zealous godly Nonconformists&#146; greatly inspired him (Baxter, <span class="italic">Catholick Communion Defended</span>, &#145;Account&#146;, 28; <span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.13), and his confidence in episcopal authority was shaken by its opposition to such Christian commitment and its determination to pursue, and to silence, such devout men. He was struck, too, by the fact that, like himself, both Fawler and Old had been first &#145;awakened &hellip; to a serious resolved care of their Salvation&#146; by reading Bunny  (Baxter, <span class="italic">Against the Revolt</span>, 540).<br>
<br>Having, then, &#145;no Scruple at all against Subscription&#146; and thinking &#145;the Conformists had the better Cause&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.13), Baxter was ordained deacon at Worcester on 23 December 1638 by John Thornborough, the elderly bishop of the diocese. (That, by the late 1630s, it was highly unusual to be ordained without a university training in part explains Baxter's sensitivity on this point.) There is no record of a subsequent ordination, though the probability is that Baxter did proceed to the priesthood. It was, by Baxter's own account, his friend James Berry, afterwards one of Cromwell's major-generals, who persuaded him to enter the ministry. Baxter came to disapprove strongly of Berry's Cromwellian sympathies and of his patronage of sectaries and Quakers, but in the late 1630s the two men were very close: Berry lived with Baxter, he may have been one of the Shrewsbury nonconformists who so impressed him, and he secured Baxter's appointment as master of the school founded at Dudley, Worcestershire, by the ironmaster Richard Foley (<i>d</i>. 1657) of Stourbridge. Though Baxter held this position only briefly, he lived with Richard Foley and his wife, &#145;a Gentlewoman of &hellip; extraordinary Meekness and Patience, with sincere Piety&#146;, who was to die two years later  (ibid., 1.14), and thereafter he enjoyed a lifelong connection with the Foley family: he had a high regard for all three of Foley's sons, and was in particular to enjoy the friendship and patronage of Thomas Foley until his death in 1677.<h2>
<a name="Civilwaryears"></a>Civil war years</h2>Baxter was nine months at Dudley, during which he preached his first public sermon at the parish church of St Edmund, before moving in the autumn of 1639 to Bridgnorth, Shropshire, where he lived in the house of the schoolmaster, Richard Swaine, and served as assistant to the vicar, William Madstard, &#145;very honest and conscionable, and an excellent Preacher&#146;. He found the parishioners there &#145;a very ignorant, dead-hearted People&#146;, unlike the &#145;poor Tractable people&#146; of Dudley, and he was to leave deeply disappointed by his inability to penetrate their &#145;obdurateness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.15). By then Baxter's churchmanship had assumed a distinctively puritan character, but, because Bridgnorth was exempt from episcopal jurisdiction as a royal peculiar, this led to no confrontation with ecclesiastical authority. At Dudley he had begun &#145;a serious impartial Trial of the whole Cause&#146; of nonconformity by undertaking a sustained course of reading. His conclusion was that a prescribed liturgy was lawful and that, though the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> had &#145;much <i>disorder</i> and <i>defectiveness</i> in it&#146;, it might be used. However, to subscribe that it contained nothing contrary to the word of God &#145;was that, which if it had been to do again, I durst not do&#146;. Though he did not object to the use of a ring in marriage, nor to kneeling to receive the sacrament, he never wore a surplice, or made the sign of the cross in baptism. At this time he had grave misgivings about the sacrament of baptism itself, only resolved (in favour of paedobaptism) five or six years later. Above all, he regretted the lack of church discipline and was opposed to the &#145;<i>promiscuous giving of the Lord's Supper to all Drunkards, Swearers, Fornicators, Scorners at Godliness &amp;c.</i>&#146;  (ibid., 1.13). His resolution, and his sympathies, were sufficiently declared when in 1639 he refused to pray against the invading Scots. And it was at Bridgnorth that he made his first public stand on a matter of ecclesiastical policy when, at a meeting of ministers in 1640, he spoke against the &#145;et cetera&#146; oath. Its notoriously loose wording and apparently limitless applicability hardened opposition to episcopacy, and to the ecclesiastical policy of William Laud, archbishop of Canterbury, in Baxter, as it did in many throughout the country. At Dudley he had read books on ecclesiology lent to him by &#145;godly honest&#146; nonconformists and he continued to be troubled by the &#145;Sufferings from the Bishops&#146; which they endured. He pursued his reading at Bridgnorth, and his growing disquiet at &#145;the English Diocesan frame&#146; was further sharpened by what appeared to him to be this act of ecclesiastical tyranny  (ibid., 1.13&#150;14, 1.15&#150;16).<br>
<br>In March 1641 Baxter was invited to Kidderminster, Worcestershire, as a preacher or &#145;lecturer&#146;. Having grown deeply dissatisfied with the conduct and ministry of their vicar, George Dance, and his curates, the parishioners of Kidderminster had resolved to report them to the committee for scandalous ministers, to prevent which Dance agreed to allow &pound;60 p.a. from his stipend to provide for a preacher (formally his assistant or curate), chosen by fourteen representatives of the parishioners, in the place of one of his curates, John Dide. This arrangement, reached through the mediation of Sir Henry Herbert, now MP for neighbouring Bewdley, was sealed with a bond for &pound;500 signed by Dance on 26 February 1641. The fourteen feoffees first approached Anthony Lapthorne, afterwards rector of Sedgefield, co. Durham, but they were dissatisfied with his preaching. They then invited Baxter to visit Kidderminster to deliver a sermon, which he did on Sunday 4 April 1641. A certificate electing him to the position was signed the next day and Baxter moved shortly thereafter.<br>
<br>There is no doubt that Baxter was relieved to leave Bridgnorth, but his initial experiences at Kidderminster were not wholly encouraging. Many were offended by the forcefulness of his preaching and by his insistence on the need for church discipline and controlled admission to the Lord's supper. When in 1642 the churchwarden sought to implement a parliamentary order for the destruction of any remaining images of the persons of the Trinity or of the Virgin Mary, Baxter, whom they supposed responsible, became the target of &#145;a Crew of the drunken riotous Party of the Town&#146;, putting him in fear for his life  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.40). The tensions and hostilities surrounding the outbreak of civil war further heightened feelings: &#145;a violent Country Gentleman&#146; passing Baxter in the street &#145;stopt and said, <i>There goeth a Traitor</i>&#146;; &#145;if a Stranger past &hellip; that had short Hair and a Civil Habit, the Rabble presently cried, [<i>Down with the Round-heads</i>]&#146;  (ibid.). In these circumstances Baxter decided it would be prudent to withdraw from Kidderminster for a while. He went for a month in early 1642 to Gloucester, where he stayed with &#145;Mr. <i>Darney</i> the Town Clark&#146; and first met his lifelong friend John Corbet. After his return to Kidderminster &#145;the Fury of the Rabble was so hot&#146; that he withdrew again, and, being &#145;with one Mr. <i>Hunt</i> near Inkborough&#146; (Inkberrow, Worcestershire), he witnessed the first engagement of the war, at Powick Bridge, near Worcester, on 23 September 1642. During a sermon he was delivering the next Sunday at the parish church of Alcester for the rector, his friend Samuel Clarke, &#145;the People heard the Cannon play&#146; at the battle of Edgehill, the scene of which he and Clarke visited the next day  (ibid., 1.42&#150;3). With the outbreak of hostilities, Baxter, with no close friends in Kidderminster and feeling still more vulnerable, decided to stay with his friend Simon King, Swaine's successor as schoolmaster at Bridgnorth in 1640&#150;41 but now curate at Trinity Church, Coventry.<br>
<br>Baxter expected the war to end within a few weeks, but he did not in fact return to Kidderminster until 1647. Coventry was a parliamentarian garrison, and there he was joined by &#145;the Religious part of my Neighbours &hellip; that would fain have lived quietly at home&#146; but who were &#145;forced &hellip; to be gone&#146; from Kidderminster and by those he describes as &#145;the most religious Men of the Parts round about&#146; more generally. A number of puritan ministers from the central counties of England also sought safety in the town. These included men already known to Baxter, such as Cradock; men who would become his firm friends, such as Obadiah Grew, Richard Vines, and &#145;my special Friend&#146; Robert Morton, curate of Bewdley, the father of Richard Morton; and men whom he admired but with whom he afterwards engaged in theological controversy, such as Anthony Burgess  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.44, 1.45). After a month with King, Baxter, though he did not become chaplain to the garrison regiment, accepted an invitation to lodge in the house of the governor, John Barker, and to preach weekly to the soldiers of the garrison and once every Sunday to the people at large, &#145;not taking of any of them a Penny for either, save my Diet only&#146;. He found there &#145;a very Judicious Auditory&#146; containing &#145;many very godly &hellip; Gentlemen&#146;, including Sir Richard Skeffington, fourth baronet, &#145;a most noble, holy Man&#146;, and the writer George Abbot  (ibid., 1.44).<br>
<br>In autumn 1643 Baxter accompanied a party to establish a parliamentarian garrison at Wem, Shropshire, in order that he might visit his father, who had been plundered by royalist soldiers and imprisoned at Lilleshall Abbey. Baxter succeeded in securing his father's release. When Shrewsbury was captured by the royalists, Baxter's father enjoyed the protection of the new governor, his brother-in-law Sir Fulke Huncks, though he was again to be imprisoned before the town was recaptured by the parliamentarians. When Sir Fulke left upon the appointment of Sir Francis Ottley as governor in 1643, his mother remained behind, living with Baxter's father and her daughter, Mary, Baxter's stepmother, in whose house she died in 1645 or 1646, aged between eighty and 100 years. (Her bequest to Baxter's stepmother of &pound;50 led to a protracted dispute between the Baxters and her executor, Edward, second Viscount Conway, and his successor, Edward, third viscount, afterwards first earl of Conway; it was still occasioning correspondence in 1680.) Baxter himself continued undisturbed at Coventry until summer 1645, living &#145;in safety in a City of defence &hellip; seeing no enemy while the Kingdom was in Wars and Flames&#146;  (Baxter, <span class="italic">Dying Thoughts</span>, 224&#150;5). However, when after the battle of Naseby he visited the parliamentarian army quarters at Leicester, he was appalled to discover &#145;a new face of things which I never dreamt of&#146;. While &#145;We that lived quietly in <i>Coventry</i> did keep to our old Principles, and &hellip; were unfeignedly for King and Parliament&#146;, anticipating that the king would be brought to a reconciliation with his parliament and to consent to a reformation of the national church, Baxter now encountered in the New Model Army a body of men among whom radical and enthusiastic ideas were eagerly embraced and officers among whom &#145;hot-headed Sectaries had got into the highest places&#146; and were Cromwell's &#145;chief Favourites&#146;. Their intentions Baxter took to be no less than &#145;to subvert both Church and State&#146;: they &#145;were far from thinking of &hellip; any healing way between the Episcopal and the Presbyterians&#146;; &#145;they took the King for a Tyrant and an Enemy, and really intended absolutely to master him, or ruine him&#146;. Baxter's puritanism valued order, tradition, and authority; the revolutionary and radical wing of the movement, as represented by Anabaptists and, later, Quakers, disclosed to him a prospect of anarchy. Though he had encountered Anabaptists at Coventry, disputing with Benjamin Cox, he had given no credence to the reports that there were &#145;Swarms of Anabaptists&#146; in the army. He now realized how far prevailing opinion had moved during his secure residence at Coventry and he reproached himself for having in 1642 or 1643 declined an invitation from Cromwell to act as chaplain &#145;with that famous Troop which he began his Army with&#146;, an invitation perhaps initiated by Berry:<blockquote>These very men that then invited me to be their Pastor, were the Men that afterwards headed much of the Army &hellip; which made me wish that I had gone among them &hellip; for then all the Fire was in one Spark. (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.50&#150;51)</blockquote>Realizing his mistake, Baxter now agreed to act as chaplain in the regiment commanded by Edward Whalley, but with the express intention of countering the spread of radical ideas among the troops, which, not surprisingly, drew upon him &#145;the discountenance of <i>Cromwell</i> and the chief Officers of his Mind&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.56). Baxter deplored the influence of such Independent ministers as Hugh Peters and, among Cromwell's officers, of sectaries and enthusiasts such as Thomas Rainborow. Levellers and Diggers he regarded as the tools of &#145;Anabaptists&#146;, a term by which he encompassed all shades of enthusiastic opinion. It was, it may be supposed, his experiences in the army which resolved those early doubts about the sacrament of baptism. Similarly, his army experiences gave to Baxter's theology its characteristic emphasis upon continuing moral commitment, growth in grace, and the conditionality of justification. He became convinced that the antinomian emphasis which resulted from the exclusive stress upon free grace characteristic of Ranters and other radicals, and which Baxter detected also in the Calvinist theology of such Independents as John Owen, far from exalting divine mercy or constituting Christian liberation, was antithetical to the moral life. In his first publication, <span class="italic">Aphorismes of Justification</span> (1649), Baxter argued for a process of justification involving human co-operation with grace. This apparent retreat from predestinarian orthodoxy embroiled Baxter in prolonged controversy, with Owen among others, but he would maintain his position throughout his life, repeatedly drawing upon himself charges of Arminianism, popery, and even Pelagianism.<br>
<br>With Whalley's regiment Baxter followed the New Model Army westwards as it successively reduced the royalist strongholds of Bridgwater, Sherborne, Bristol, and Exeter, and then, in 1646, Banbury and Worcester. On the advice of the physician Sir Theodore Mayerne, whom he consulted in London, Baxter took the waters at Tunbridge Wells for three weeks in the later summer of 1646, but later that year his health declined until, in February 1647, having caught a chill riding in snowy weather, and having suffered for a week from constant bleeding from the nose, he was compelled to remain in his quarters with Sir John Coke of Melbourne Hall, Derbyshire. He then went for three weeks to the house of Verney Noel of Kirkby Mallory, Leicestershire, and then for three months to Rous Lench Court, the Worcestershire home of Sir Thomas and Lady Rous. It was at Kirkby Mallory that he began the composition of perhaps his most famous book, <span class="italic">The Saints Everlasting Rest</span> (1650), and he continued it at Rous Lench.<br>
<br>Poor health was a permanent feature of Baxter's life. As a child he suffered from catarrh, colds, and a prolonged cough. In the early 1630s he was &#145;in expectation of Death, by a violent Cough, with Spitting of Blood, <i>&amp;c.</i> of two years continuance&#146;; &#145;From the Age of 21 till near 23, my Weakness was so great, that I expected not to live above a year&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.5, 1.12). He did not expect to survive the publication of <span class="italic">Aphorismes of Justification</span> long enough to produce another book; when <span class="italic">The Saints Everlasting Rest</span> appeared, it was addressed to its reader as the legacy of a dying man. The thirty or more different physicians Baxter was to consult during his life were unable to prescribe any sustained relief from &#145;the same Symptoms as most men have about Fourscore years of Age&#146;. Baxter suffered chronically from flatulency and gastric problems, &#145;incredible Inflammations of Stomach, Bowels, Back, Sides, Head, Thighs, as if I had been daily fill'd with Wind&#146;; from scurvy and from repeated haemorrhaging from &#145;Eyes, and Teeth, and Jaws, and Joynts, so that I had scarce rest night or day&#146;; he was prone to catch colds and chills, and he suffered regularly from headaches, from &#145;terrible Toothach&#146;, and from gallstones, in later life the severity of the pain leaving &#145;scarce any part or hour &hellip; free&#146;  (ibid., 1.9&#150;10, 1.80&#150;83, 3.173&#150;4, where he also details the various remedies he tried). If there was something of the hypochondriac in his disposition (one diagnosis he was given was &#145;that my Disease was the Hypocondriack Melancholy&#146;, another that it was &#145;nothing but Hypochondriack Flatulency, and somewhat of a Scorbutical Malady&#146;), he had good cause anxiously to attend to his bodily condition: physical indisposition at best, pain at worst, were his constant experience. This, coupled with his lifelong expectation that death was imminent, led him to value time intensely and to expatiate on the traditional puritan theme of the sinfulness of time-wasting with particular forcefulness; as he wrote in the autobiographical poem &#145;Love Breathing Thanks and Praise&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>
<i>A Life still near to Death</i>, did me possess<br>
</div>
<div>With a deep sense of Time's great Preciousness.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>To this preoccupation with the efficient management of time may be attributed Baxter's quite extraordinary industry and voluminous literary output:<blockquote>
<div>The frequent sight of Death's most awful face,<br>
</div>
<div>Rebuk'd my sloth, and bid me mend my pace.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>&#145;Expecting to be so quickly in another World&#146; also lent urgency to Baxter's evangelistic and pastoral ministry: as he aphoristically put it:<blockquote>
<div>I Preach'd, as never sure to Preach again<br>
</div>
<div>And as a dying man to dying men!<br>
</div>(Baxter, <span class="italic">Poetical Fragments</span>, 38&#150;40; <span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.86)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Kidderminsteryears"></a>Kidderminster years</h2>It was five months before Baxter was sufficiently recovered to visit Kidderminster in the summer of 1647. In May, while still at Rous Lench Court, he had received an invitation to return to Kidderminster. Its 265 signatories (including a number who had fought for parliament) are evidence that, despite the hostility Baxter had experienced in 1641&#150;2, he had made his mark with many of the parishioners. While with the army Baxter had considered himself committed to his position at Kidderminster and had not entertained any other pastoral appointment. During his absence, however, the parish had reinstituted its proceedings against Dance and the living had been sequestered by the committee for plundered ministers. What Baxter was now offered was consequently the position of vicar. This he declined, agreeing only to take up his old lectureship for a salary of &pound;80&#150;90 per annum. The parishioners then offered the position to Oliver Bromskill, curate at Sheriffhales, whom Baxter had known at Coventry, but he declined the invitation, as did Baxter again when, soon after his return to Kidderminster, he was &#145;vehemently urged &hellip; to take the Vicaridge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.79). However, unbeknown to Baxter, in March 1648 the parishioners proceeded to secure his appointment as vicar. Only in 1651 did they disclose what they had done. Baxter nevertheless allowed Dance to continue living in the vicarage, on an allowance of &pound;40 per annum from the parish revenue, while he himself lodged in rooms on the upper floor of a house in the High Street; and he raised no objection to Dance conducting prayer book services for the lord of the manor, Sir Ralph Clare. He similarly took no steps to prevent the remaining curate from reading the common prayer to adherents of the episcopal church at the chapelry at Mitton.<br>
<br>Many of those who had opposed Baxter in 1641 and 1642 had fought and died for the royalist cause, which, together with the changed political situation, prevented any recurrence of the earlier hostility upon his return. It was during the ensuing years at Kidderminster that Baxter became a figure of national renown and it is upon his pastorate there that his enduring reputation in part rests. During the 1650s he effected a remarkable transformation: &#145;When I came thither first, there was about one Family in a Street that worshipped God and called on his name&#146;, but &#145;when I came away there were some Streets where there was not past one Family in the Side of a Street that did not so&#146;; &#145;on the Lord's Day &hellip; you might hear an hundred Families singing Psalms and repeating Sermons, as you passed through the Streets&#146;. The parish of Kidderminster then comprised the market town and twenty surrounding villages, some 800 families in all, or 3000&#150;4000 inhabitants, of whom rather more than 1800 were adults. Of these, about 600 were full communicants under Baxter's ministry, &#145;of whom there was not twelve that I had not good hopes of, as to their sincerity&#146;. Those who were not full church members, among whom Baxter believed were many of sincere faith &#145;kept off by Husbands, by Parents, by Masters, and some dissuaded by Men that differed from us&#146;, did not oppose or obstruct Baxter's ministry  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.84&#150;5).<br>
<br>The church order and worship at Kidderminster followed a moderate line between the enthusiasm of radical puritanism and the prescriptiveness of both strict presbyterianism and prayer book worship. Baxter was not opposed to a written liturgy or to forms of prayer, though he himself used extempore prayers. He administered the sacrament to seated communicants, but would refuse it to none who wished to kneel. He administered infant baptism (though with parents, not godparents, taking the vows), and engaged in oral and written disputation with the famed Baptist John Tombes, curate at neighbouring Bewdley, Worcestershire. <span class="italic">Plain Scripture Proof of Infants Church Membership and Baptism</span> (1651) arose out of these debates and was the first of several titles on this subject. Baxter did not observe Christmas, regarding it as a spurious festival of late institution, but he was far from the (false) stereotype of the puritan killjoy. He delighted in the singing of psalms, and, himself the author of poems which have since become such well-known hymns as &#145;Ye holy angels bright&#146; (from &#145;A Psalm of Praise&#146; in <span class="italic">Poetical Fragments</span>, 84&#150;8), he advocated the composition of hymns for congregational singing at a time when praise in worship was limited to the words of the psalms. He was similarly a keen advocate of aesthetic and sensory aids to devotion: &#145;God would not have given us, either our Senses themselves, or their usual objects, if they might not have been serviceable to his own praise&#146;; hence, it is &#145;a point of our Spiritual Prudence, and a singular help to the furthering of the work of Faith, to call in our Sense to its assistance&#146;  (Baxter, <span class="italic">Saints Everlasting Rest</span>, 757).<br>
<br>Baxter held that church discipline and controlled admission to the Lord's supper were fundamental to the being of a true church, but he did not conceive of this in rigid or mechanistic terms. His own conditions for church membership were liberal. In <span class="italic">Certain Disputations of Right to Sacraments</span> (1657) he argued that a credible &#145;<i>Profession</i> of a <i>Saving Faith</i>&#146;, with which the quality of their lives is consistent, is a sufficient condition &#145;of Mens title to Church-Communion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.113). Recognizing that &#145;God breaketh not all Mens hearts alike&#146;, Baxter did not ask potential church members for a rehearsal of spiritual experience such as was required by many Independent and separatist churches. He was hostile to their prescriptiveness and, as one committed to a parochially organized national church, to their exclusivity. However, although he rejected the Independents' strictness (he would not &#145;with Independants, un-church the Parish-Church, and gather a Church out of them anew&#146;), Baxter was equally dissatisfied with episcopal laxity and its &#145;meer Mock-shew of Discipline&#146;; the outward holiness of church society must be maintained if it is to be recognizable as a church  (ibid., 1.91, 1.7). Full communicants were therefore required to submit to church discipline, accepting admonishment for sins in private or, in extreme cases, public confession of wrongdoing and resolution to reform at a parish meeting for discipline held every first Wednesday of the month. Excommunication was the ultimate sanction. Baxter recognized that such discipline is mere tyranny unless it is accompanied by a commitment to instruction and pastoral oversight. Parishioners were given the opportunity to understand Christian duties and obligations, and encouragement to fulfil them. It was Baxter's promotion of catechetical instruction which was the truly distinctive feature of his Kidderminster ministry and at the root of his success. He devoted the afternoons of every Monday and Tuesday, and his assistant the mornings, to an hour's &#145;private Catechising and Conference (he going through the Parish, and the Town coming to me)&#146; with fourteen families each week until they had seen every family in the town and its environs. The rota then began again. (Baxter's assistants in this work, of whose &#145;honesty and diligence&#146; he speaks very highly, included Thomas Baldwin, Joseph Read, Richard Sargeant, and Humphrey Waldron, all of them nonconformist ministers following the Restoration.) Only a half-dozen families refused to participate; &#145;And few Families went from us without some tears, or seemingly serious promises for a Godly Life&#146;  (ibid., 1.83, 1.85, 1.88).<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Gildas Salvianus: the Reformed Pastor</span> (1656), a book which, either as a full text or in abridged form, has been available ever since its first publication, Baxter gave impassioned expression to both his pastoral ideals and his pastoral zeal. <span class="italic">The Reformed Pastor</span> arose out of Baxter's dismay at, and determination to rectify, pastoral neglect in the west midlands such as he had experienced as a young man. It is a permanent contribution to the literature of pastoral theology and perhaps the finest product of the practical concern of puritanism for the well-being of souls. Despite its emphasis on catechizing, the book is instinct with the awesome seriousness of the preacher's office. Baxter himself was a powerful and committed evangelistic preacher, with a puritan's characteristically clear-sighted grasp of the needs of his hearers. He set himself firmly in the line of puritan plain preaching addressed to the needs of a &#145;popular auditory&#146;: he had no patience with such preaching as that of Lancelot Andrewes, which &#145;did but play with holy things&#146;; &#145;it was the plain and pressing downright Preacher, that onely seemed to me to be in good sadness, and to make somewhat of it, and to speak with life, and light, and weight&#146; (R. Baxter, <span class="italic">Treatise of Conversion</span>, 1657, epistle to the reader; Keeble and Nuttall, 1.255). His preaching enjoyed great success, both in Kidderminster, where five extra galleries had to be added to the parish church, St Mary's, and during a visit to London in the winter of 1654&#150;5, when, on the occasion of his preaching at St Lawrence Jewry the sermon published as <span class="italic">Making Light of Christ and Salvation</span> (1655), Roger Boyle, Lord Broghill, afterwards earl of Orrery, with whom Baxter lodged during his visit, and James Howard, earl of Suffolk, who had taken Baxter by coach, could not gain entrance to the church such was the crush, and the vicar, Richard Vines, Baxter's friend from Coventry days, &#145;was fain to get up into the Pulpit, and sit behind me, and I to stand between his Legs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.112).<br>
<br>Baxter was in London in the winter of 1654&#150;5 at Broghill's instigation to serve as one of the divines charged to draw up a statement of religious fundamentals which the subcommittee set up to advise Cromwell and the grand committee on religion could put forward as a definition of tolerable religious orthodoxy under the &#145;Instrument of government&#146;, the protectorate's constitution. Broghill, a member of the committee, first nominated Archbishop James Ussher; when, because of advanced age, he declined to serve, Broghill named Baxter in his place. It was during this visit that Baxter met Ussher, the man whom, of all his contemporaries, he perhaps most admired. Ussher's <span class="italic">Reduction of Episcopacie unto the Form of Synodicall Government used in the Antient Church</span>, published anonymously in 1656 but circulating in the 1640s, shaped Baxter's thinking on episcopacy and church government throughout his life. In his <span class="italic">Five Disputations of Church-Government and Worship</span> (1659) Baxter argued that &#145;the English Diocesane Prelacy is intollerable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.117) and proposed a scheme of modified episcopacy, consisting essentially of parochial bishops, which, he maintained, was consistent with, and preserved the best aspects of, the church polities of presbyterians, Independents, and moderate episcopalians alike.<br>
<br>Baxter's growing national reputation derived in part from the establishment during these years of the Worcestershire Voluntary Association of Ministers, a genuinely innovative movement initiated in 1652 which by 1659 had come to be imitated in many other counties. Its seventy or so members (from Staffordshire, Shropshire, Gloucestershire, and Oxfordshire, as well as Worcestershire) included some of Independent and episcopalian persuasion, but its membership was predominantly presbyterian, though not in a sense which implied commitment to the details of that church polity. Baxter consistently maintained that the term &#145;presbyterian&#146; was in common usage merely a synonym for &#145;puritan&#146; and that, while &#145;Presbytery generally took in <i>Scotland</i>, yet it was but a stranger here&#146;; those in England known as presbyterians in fact &#145;addicted themselves to no Sect or Party at all&#146;. He claimed to know only one presbyterian strictly so-called in all Worcestershire (Thomas Hall, curate of King's Norton). The members of the association he characterized as &#145;meer Catholicks; Men of no Faction, nor siding with any Party, but owning that which was good in all&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.97, 2.146). Just over half would conform at the Restoration.<br>
<br>The association adopted the confession of faith published in <span class="italic">Christian Concord, or, The Agreement of the Associated Pastors and Churches of Worcestershire</span> (1653). Its members agreed to pursue a regular programme of catechizing within their cures: <span class="italic">The Reformed Pastor</span> was originally written to encourage members in this work and the association published its <span class="italic">Agreement for Catechizing</span> in 1656. And they undertook to meet monthly, at Bromsgrove, Evesham, Kidderminster, Upton upon Severn, and Worcester, with quarterly meetings at Worcester. The monthly meetings at Evesham and Kidderminster were regularly held, on the first Thursday of every month at Kidderminster, where, after a meal, there was a disputation on a previously agreed topic, and on occasion discussion of cases of discipline. (Some members also attended Baxter's weekly Thursday lecture, joining him afterwards in his home.) A number of these disputations appeared in Baxter's publications, some are among extant Baxter papers, and correspondence on behalf of the association is among Baxter's surviving letters. These &#145;comfortable&#146; meetings Baxter held among the most rewarding and enjoyable experiences of his life, and the work of the association in uniting men in pastoral commitment he regarded as a shining example of true Christian fellowship and charity. In 1660, when its day was done, <span class="italic">Universal Concord</span> published to &#145;the World &hellip; what our Religion and our Terms of Communion were&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.85, 1.119).<br>
<br>In the creation of the Worcestershire Association, Baxter's commitment to pastoral service combined with his passionate desire for unity among Christians of differing persuasions. &#145;God hath possessed my heart with such a burning desire after the peace &amp; unity of the Churches that I cannot forget it, or lay it by. I feele a supernaturall power forceing my zeale, &amp; thoughts that way&#146;, Baxter wrote in a letter of February 1652  (Keeble and Nuttall, 1.92). In addition to the formation of the association, throughout the 1650s this zeal inspired a number of attempts to secure national church unity. In 1652&#150;4 Baxter was in correspondence with the international ecumenist John Durie, an admirer of the association project, seeking to convene, with parliamentary support, a conference of representatives from the main ecclesiastical parties to reach an agreement upon a comprehensive national church settlement. It was a scheme which, Durie reported, enjoyed the support of the lord protector, who was &#145;forward in the worke&#146;. Baxter himself remarked that the protector &#145;is noted as a man of a Catholike spiritt, desirous of the unity &amp; Peace of all the servants of Christ&#146;, and in April 1658 his friend John Howe, then Cromwell's chaplain, reported that the lord protector &#145;expressed great willingnesse&#146; to promote the association movement throughout England  (Keeble and Nuttall, 1.128, 300, 302). In 1652 Baxter was responsible for the publication of <span class="italic">The Humble Petition of many Thousands &hellip; of the County of Worcester</span>, presented to the Rump Parliament on 22 December 1652 by John Bridges, patron of the Kidderminster living, and Thomas Foley. It asked that &#145;godly, prudent, peaceable Divines of each party&#146; might be summoned to a national conference to determine &#145;a meet way for accommodation and unity&#146;, as well as for financial support for the ministry and a university education for all ministers. Baxter's <span class="italic">The Worcestershire-Petition Defended</span> (1653), written against the published objections of the Quaker Benjamin Nicholson to these petitions, was handed out to MPs at the door of the house, but the next day the Rump was turned out. In 1655, in the preface to <span class="italic">True Christianity</span>, Baxter urged the first protectorate parliament to pursue church unity. One of the sermons he preached during his visit to London in 1654&#150;5 was published as <span class="italic">Catholick Unity</span> (1660) and during that same visit, through the good offices of Broghill and Robert Rich, second earl of Warwick, he preached to Cromwell &#145;on <span class="roman">I. Cor.</span> i.10 against the Divisions and Distractions of the Church&#146;. Cromwell afterwards twice sent for Baxter for several hours' discussion, but to little avail: &#145;I saw that what he learned must be from himself; being more disposed to speak many hours, than to hear one&#146;, was Baxter's assessment  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 2.205).<br>
<br>Baxter's experience at the 1654&#150;5 London conference was itself equally disappointing. Owen, a leading member of the group, had been responsible for drawing up and publishing fifteen fundamentals of belief (<span class="italic">Proposals for the Furtherance and Propagation of the Gospel in this Nation</span>, 1653). In contrast, Baxter, who &#145;knew how ticklish a Business the Enumeration of Fundamentals was&#146;, &#145;would have had the Brethren to have offered the Parliament the <i>Creed</i>, <i>Lord's Prayer</i>, and <i>Decalogue</i> alone as our Essentials or Fundamentals&#146;, responding to the objection that papists or Socinians might subscribe these with the startling words &#145;So much the better, and so much the fitter it is to be the Matter of our Concord&#146;. For Owen and the &#145;over-Orthodox Doctors&#146; this was an unacceptably broad and loose formulation  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 2.197&#150;9). Baxter's meetings with Ussher, however, were an inspiration: the two agreed &#145;in halfe an Hour&#146; on a form of modified episcopacy sufficient for &#145;Concord &hellip; in matters of Church-Government&#146; among &#145;moderate Men&#146; of all ecclesiastical persuasions  (ibid., 2.217). In 1655 Baxter reported this to Ralph Brownrig, deprived bishop of Exeter, when commending to him terms of reconciliation between episcopalians and presbyterians. In September 1656, when asked by Edward Harley, newly elected to the second protectorate parliament, how best to serve the interests of the &#145;distressed Church&#146;, Baxter, again referring to the ease with which he and Ussher had &#145;agreed in halfe an Hour&#146;, advised him, first, to &#145;take heed of being too forward in imposing on others&#146; and to confine any required profession of faith to Scripture fundamentals, else it would merely exclude and divide; &#145;In a doubtful case, I had rather erre in grantinge too much liberty, than too little&#146;. Second, he urged the calling of a conference of &#145;two of the most moderate &amp; best esteemed&#146; representatives of the episcopal, presbyterian, and Independent traditions. And third, he recommended that one version of the psalms should be authorized nationally for use in churches  (Keeble and Nuttall, 1.222&#150;6). In 1657 Baxter was recommending to the New England evangelist John Eliot as &#145;an excellent worke&#146; a proposal that the Congregational New England churches should propound terms of reconciliation between Independents and presbyterian churches in England  (ibid., 1.240). On this same business he corresponded also with such episcopalians as Thomas Good and Henry Hammond, with Independents such as Philip Nye, and, during the last years of the interregnum, with two former Independents, now Baptists, Thomas Lambe (or Lamb) and William Allen, whom he so effectively convinced of the lamentable consequences of disunity that after the Restoration he was to find them as hostile to nonconformity as once they had been committed to separatism.<h2>
<a name="TheRestoration"></a>The Restoration</h2>Looking back after the Restoration, Baxter was to acknowledge that, under &#145;an Usurper whom I opposed&#146; he had enjoyed &#145;Liberty and Advantage to preach [the] Gospel with Success, which I cannot have under a King to whom I have sworn and performed true Subjection and Obedience&#146;. He never modified his political opposition to Cromwell, and regretted what he took to be the corrupting effect of power upon him (his famous summary characterization is in <span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.98&#150;100). During the 1650s &#145;I did seasonably and moderately by Preaching and Printing condemn the Usurpation, and &hellip; in open Conference declare <i>Cromwell</i> and his Adherents to be Guilty of Treason and Rebellion, aggravated with Perfidiousness and Hypocrisie&#146;. Nevertheless, &#145;I perceived that it was his design to do good in the main, and to promote the Gospel and the Interest of Godliness, more than any had done before him&#146;, and, on the basis of his experience of that &#145;incredible Age&#146;, Baxter passionately rebutted the Restoration opinion that &#145;all Religion was then trodden down, and Heresy and Schism were the only Piety&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.71, 1.86&#150;7). Baxter especially admired, and commended, the work of the Triers in approving ministers.<br>
<br>Of Cromwell's son, Baxter had great hopes as a man who, having &#145;never had any hand in the War&#146;, nor having sought power, and who seemed &#145;to own the Sober Party&#146;, might &#145;be used in the healing of the Land&#146;. Here was a godly magistrate under whom a national reformed church might flourish. In October and November 1658 Baxter dedicated to Richard Cromwell <span class="italic">A Key for Catholicks</span> (1659) and <span class="italic">Five Disputations of Church Government and Worship</span> (1659), in the second expressing the hope that the new protector might &#145;be the happy instrument of <i>taking away</i> the divisions of the <i>Godly</i>&#146; (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.100; Keeble and Nuttall, 1.358). Early in 1659 Baxter wrote his most controversial book, <span class="italic">A Holy Commonwealth</span> (1659), a retort to the model of a &#145;<i>Heathenish Commonwealth</i>&#146; given in James Harrington's <span class="italic">Oceana</span> (1659), broken off in despair when the army ousted the protector in April  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.118). It contains as an appendix Baxter's understanding of the issues which led to civil war and a justificatory account of his own actions and allegiance at that time. Following the Restoration, charges that Baxter (and nonconformists generally) were seditious repeatedly cited this text as evidence that, as a man who would not rule out resistance to the supreme governor, Baxter was a potential traitor and threat to the safety of the state. After ten years of this, in a statement dated 15 April 1670 published in the second edition of <span class="italic">The Life of Faith</span> (1670, sigs. b3&#150;b3<i>v</i>), Baxter withdrew the book and repented of having published it, though &#145;without recanting any particular Doctrine in it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 3.71&#150;2). In 1683 it was one of the books publicly burnt as seditious by a decree of 21 July of the University of Oxford.<br>
<br>In the last years of the interregnum Baxter had had increasing contacts with men of royalist persuasion, including, rather unexpectedly, John Maitland, earl (afterwards duke) of Lauderdale, with whom he was in correspondence. In the summer of 1659 he was informed by Sir Ralph Clare of the impending rising of George Booth. Clare, who, through Hammond, claimed to know the mind of the king, assured Baxter that &#145;all Moderation was intended&#146; were the monarchy to be restored  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 2.208). In March 1660 Baxter was invited by Lauderdale to London, where he arrived on 13 April, to receive from Lauderdale expressions of the king's &#145;Favour and Acceptance&#146;  (Baxter, <span class="italic">Penitent Confession</span>, 43). Having been identified as an opinion-maker whom it was well to secure for the cause of monarchy's restoration, Baxter was visited also by Sir William Morice, newly appointed secretary of state, and by James Sharpe, afterwards archbishop of St Andrews. Baxter's disappointment at the overthrow of Richard Cromwell, his bitterness at the peremptory actions of the army, and his dismay at the constitutional instability of 1659 all combined with his innate respect for tradition and order to confirm his support for the royalist cause. Though he was far from thinking Charles I a martyr, he certainly did not approve of the regicide and he had served with parliament not with a view to redrafting the constitution but in order to secure true religion.<br>
<br>On 30 April Baxter preached before the Convention at St Margaret's, Westminster, <span class="italic">A Sermon of Repentance</span> (1660), and, following the Convention's vote to recall Charles II on 1 May, on 10 May he preached at St Paul's before the lord mayor a sermon, <span class="italic">Right Rejoycing</span> (1660). On 25 June he (with other presbyterians) was appointed a chaplain to the king, and on 22 July he preached before Charles <span class="italic">The Life of Faith</span> (1660). His standing, and the anxiety of the restored regime to secure his unqualified allegiance, was evidenced further by the offer to him of the bishopric of Hereford made in October by Edward Hyde, earl of Clarendon. This offer Baxter declined in a letter of 1 November, for the characteristic reason that to accept would inhibit him from promoting church unity. As this indicates, in the ecclesiastical negotiations which accompanied the Restoration, his aim remained what it had been during the interregnum. In his <span class="italic">Sermon of Repentance</span> he had spoken of church unity and had again mentioned his agreement with Ussher. This prompted &#145;many moderate Episcopal Divines&#146; to request further details from him and had led to a series of meetings. Reconciliation was the theme not only of <span class="italic">Universal Concord</span> but, in that same year, 1660, also of both <span class="italic">Catholick Unity</span> and <span class="italic">The True Catholick and Catholic Church Described</span>, written:<blockquote>for Catholicism against all <i>Sects</i>; to shew the Sin and Folly and Mischief of all Sects that would appropriate the Church to themselves, and trouble the World with the Question, Which of all these Parties is the Church? as if they knew not that the Catholick Church is that which containeth all the Parts, though some more pure, and some less. (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 2.218, 1.112)</blockquote>It was, he affirmed, never the intention of the so-called presbyterians to argue for a presbyterian system: rather, their aim was as comprehensive a national church settlement as possible.This Baxter and other presbyterian delegates, including Simeon Ashe, Edmund Calamy, Thomas Manton, Edward Reynolds, William Spurstowe, and John Wallis, pursued in the late summer at a meeting (or perhaps meetings) with the king at the London lodgings of Edward Montagu, second earl of Manchester, who, with Broghill, had been instrumental in securing Charles's participation. The king, professing &#145;his gladness to hear our Inclinations to Agreement, and his Resolution to do his part to bring us together&#146;, invited a written submission of the presbyterians' preferred terms. Drawn up chiefly by Calamy and Reynolds, this included Ussher's <span class="italic">Reduction</span> as grounds for agreement. The presbyterians had hoped to discuss these terms with episcopalian divines but instead were advised that the king &#145;would put all that he thought meet to grant us&#146; in a royal declaration  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 2.231, 2.259). When on 4 September the presbyterians received from Clarendon a draft <span class="italic">Declaration on Ecclesiastical Affairs</span> they were disappointed to find that it &#145;would not serve to heal our Differences&#146;. Consultation with Manchester, &#145;our sure Friend&#146;, Denzil, Lord Holles, and Arthur Annesley, first earl of Anglesey, persuaded Baxter to moderate the paper of criticisms he drew up, which was then submitted to Clarendon  (ibid., 2.265), but at a meeting between, on the one side, Reynolds, Baxter, and Calamy, and, on the other, George Morley, John Cosin, and Humphrey Henchman, then all bishops elect, it nevertheless proved impossible to reach agreement. However, a further conference between presbyterian and episcopal representatives, held on 22 October at Worcester House, Clarendon's residence, in the presence of the king, led, three days later, to a far more conciliatory final <span class="italic">Declaration</span> than Baxter had anticipated, &#145;such as any sober honest Ministers might submit to&#146;, as he gratefully told Clarendon. He told Clarendon also of his resolution to do all that he could to persuade all &#145;to Conform according to the Terms of this Declaration&#146; and to &#145;promote our happy Concord&#146;, looking forward to &#145;the Day that Factions and Parties may all be swallowed up in Unity&#146; (though he was not a named subscriber to the published address of thanks <span class="italic">To the King's most Excellent Majesty</span>, 1660). Unhappily, however, Baxter's fear that the <span class="italic">Declaration</span> &#145;was but for present use, and that shortly it would be revok'd or nullified&#146; was realized when, in a vote on 28 November, the Commons failed to pass the <span class="italic">Declaration</span> into law  (ibid., 2.279, 2.281).<br>
<br>On 24 March of the following year, 1661, a conference was convened at Savoy House, in accordance with an undertaking in the <span class="italic">Declaration</span>, to discuss revisions of the prayer book. Baxter took a leading part in the proceedings. His position was that, though he himself could readily admit as lawful such practices as kneeling to receive the sacrament, he could not accept as lawful the imposition of such indifferent matters upon those who conscientiously judged them inadmissible; still less could acceptance of them be elevated into a condition of communion. He hence argued strenuously for extensive revision of the prayer book and for sufficient latitude to accommodate those who on conscientious grounds could not conform to some of its rites. Baxter's determination to debate every point in detail clearly exasperated episcopalian delegates. Izaak Walton reports that Robert Sanderson, bishop of Lincoln, exclaimed in exasperation that &#145;<i>he had never met with a man of more pertinacious confidence, and less abilities in all his conversation</i>&#146;  (Walton, 404). Clarendon reproved Baxter for being &#145;severe and strict, like a Melancholy Man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 2.365). Despite his tenacity, however, Baxter was in his own mind convinced that the case was now hopeless and that sincere intentions to accommodate tender consciences were wanting: &#145;we spoke to the Deaf&#146;, was his judgement; &#145;I perceived that they intended no Abatements&#146;  (ibid., 2.336, 2.345). Even so, he was determined that presbyterian arguments and aspirations should not go by default, and he was especially anxious that they should be available for the subsequent judgement of history. This led him to assemble a collection of papers presented to the conference, which, with his own proposed reformed liturgy, was published without his authorization as <span class="italic">A Petition for Peace: with the Reformation of the Liturgy</span> (1661). It led him also to compile a detailed record of the conference's proceedings in the <span class="italic">Reliquiae</span>, with full documentation  (ibid., 2.303&#150;72).<br>
<br>Baxter claimed that at the Savoy he &#145;foreknew and foretold them what they were about to do&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 2.345). This would not have required exceptional prescience. A bill for religious uniformity was making its way through the Commons even as the conference was in session. Ever since the Restoration, the episcopal church of England had been re-establishing itself at parochial level, and, from late 1660, its bench of bishops began to be replenished. And as its liturgy and practices were reintroduced, so the reaction against puritanism gathered apace. As a leading figure, Baxter attracted the hostile attention of such partisan episcopalians as Thomas Pierce and Thomas Tomkins and of such vitriolic royalist pamphleteers as Sir Roger L'Estrange. Informers attended his sermons and, so he believed, misreported them: &#145;I scarce ever preached a Sermon in the City, but I had News from <i>Westminster</i> that I had preached seditiously, or against the Government&#146;; &#145;the daily Clamours of Accusers even wearied me&#146;  (ibid., 2.301, 2.302). It was even rumoured that he was to lead a rebellion in the north. By the <span class="roman">Act of Confirming and Restoring of Ministers</span> he was in the autumn of 1660 deprived of his Kidderminster living in favour of Dance, and George Morley, then bishop of Worcester, took strenuous measures to ensure that Baxter would neither return to the parish nor preach within his diocese, even as an unpaid lecturer, which he offered to do. Clare, whom Baxter saw as the chief opponent of his return to Kidderminster, stood ready to support Morley, with &#145;his Troop to apprehend me&#146; if need be  (ibid., 2.374). So far was he from reciprocating Baxter's consideration towards him that Dance would not tolerate Baxter's returning even to preach a farewell sermon at Kidderminster. (What he would have preached was published years later as <span class="italic">Richard Baxter's Farewel Sermon</span>, 1683). Baxter gave an account of these dealings in an epistle of 11 November 1661 to his Kidderminster people prefaced to <span class="italic">The Mischiefs of Self-Ignorance</span> (1662), which led to a retort from Morley in <span class="italic">The Bishop of Worcester's Letter to a Friend</span> (1662) and to a controversy involving, on Baxter's side though without his approval, Edward Bagshaw and, among others in defence of the bishop, L'Estrange. The increasing hostility Baxter experienced led him in 1662 to consider, as it did others, emigration &#145;to live and end my days in quietness, out of the noise of a Peace-hating Generation&#146;. His want of languages, his ill health, and the possibility of future service in England, urged by friends, combined to dissuade him  (ibid., 2.383).<br>
<br>During these two years Baxter preached at several locations in London. For a year he preached as invited, his sermons including a series delivered at Westminster Abbey (<span class="italic">The Vain Religion of the Formal Hypocrite</span>, 1660). He then joined with William Bates at St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street, preaching once a week, delivering there between May and August 1661 the sermons published as <span class="italic">The Mischiefs of Self-Ignorance</span> (1662). He preached also at St Bride's, Fleet Street, and at St Anne Blackfriars, where John Herring and John Gibbons, both ejected in 1662, were respectively vicar and rector. The sermons published as <span class="italic">A Saint or a Brute</span> (1662) and <span class="italic">Now or Never</span> (1662), and in parts of <span class="italic">The Divine Life</span> (1664), were preached at St Anne's. Concurrently, at St Mary Magdalen, Milk Street, where Thomas Vincent was rector, he gave a lecture on weekdays, sponsored by his friend Henry Ashurst. On 19 May 1662 the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> received the royal assent, and it became effective on St Bartholomew's day, 24 August 1662. From that date, only ministers who had received episcopal ordination, who had published their unfeigned assent and consent to all in the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, and who repudiated the solemn league and covenant, could hold benefices in the Church of England. None of these prescriptions necessarily excluded Baxter: he was episcopally ordained, he accepted the lawfulness of set forms of prayer, and he had never subscribed the solemn league and covenant. Nevertheless, the exclusivity of these terms was abhorrent to him. A church which insists upon compliance with a particular liturgical or ecclesiological form has elevated incidental matters of external performance above the essentials of Christian faith. Any church&#151;even the national church&#151;which demands the suppression of conscientious scruples as the price of membership is, he argued, sectarian: he would not subscribe to a church established on such divisive principles. He delivered his farewell sermon on <span class="roman">Colossians</span> 2: 6&#150;7 at St Anne Blackfriars on 25 May, well before the last Sunday before 24 August, in order to &#145;let all Ministers in <i>England</i> understand in time, whether I intended to Conform or not&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 2.384). It was included in the various collections of farewell sermons published in 1662 and 1663, but without Baxter's authorization and in an imperfect text, &#145;mangled so both [in] Matter and Style, that I could not own it&#146;  (ibid., 2.303); Baxter himself published an authorized text in <span class="italic">Directions for Weak Distempered Christians</span> (1669).<h2>
<a name="Nonconformity"></a>Nonconformity</h2>During the years 1660&#150;62 Baxter lodged first, for about a year, at Thomas Foley's house in Austin Friars, and then for another year in the house of Dr John Micklethwaite in Little Britain. Following his marriage on 10 September 1662 to <a href="#cosubject_67877">Margaret Charlton [<i>see below</i>]</a> he and his wife lived in a house in Moorfields until, &#145;All Publick Service being at an end&#146;, they moved on 14 July 1663 to a house in the country, at Acton, Middlesex, &#145;that I might set my self to writing, and do what Service I could for Posterity, and live as much as possibly I could out of the World&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 2.440). Among the works written during these years was the first part of the autobiographical narrative posthumously published by Matthew Sylvester as <span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span> (1696), and much of the massive work of casuistical divinity, <span class="italic">A Christian Directory</span> (1673). At Acton he developed a close friendship with his neighbour, Sir Matthew Hale, afterwards lord chief justice, with whom he enjoyed long conversations on metaphysical divinity. Baxter's great admiration for this &#145;Pillar of Justice, the Refuge of the subject who feared Oppression, and one of the greatest Honours of His Majestie's Government&#146;  (ibid., 3.47) informs his <span class="italic">Additional Notes on the Life and Death of Sir Matthew Hale</span> (1682), a companion piece to the biography of Hale by Gilbert Burnet. When the plague broke out in London, Baxter went to stay with his friend Richard Hampden, in Great Hampden, Buckinghamshire, where he completed the second part of the <span class="italic">Reliquiae</span> (dated 28 September 1665).<br>
<br>At Acton it was Baxter's habit, after joining in common prayer at the parish church on a Sunday, to preach in his home to his household and some neighbours. When the first <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span> expired on 1 March 1669, the numbers of those attending greatly increased until, at the instigation of the rector, Bruno Ryves, Baxter was arrested on 12 June 1669 under the <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span> of 1665 and imprisoned in Clerkenwell, though he was released within a few days on an error in the warrant. It is characteristic of Baxter to have continued his ministry despite the prescriptions of the Clarendon code, but equally characteristic was his determination to do so without disturbing parish worship. During the years 1660&#150;63 he had attended parish churches in London, particularly those where John Wilkins and John Tillotson preached, and he regularly attended the parish church at Acton. Baxter was always a reluctant nonconformist, seeking ways to bridge the gulf between nonconformist and conformist and aspiring to the creation of a more liberally established national church which could comprehend within it a much broader range of ecclesiological and theological opinion. To this end he continued to argue for church unity in such books as <span class="italic">The Cure of Church-Divisions</span> (1670) and <span class="italic">The True and Only Way of Concord</span> (1680), to discountenance separatism in such works as the series of tracts against Edward Bagshaw beginning with <span class="italic">A Defence of the Principles of Love</span> (1671), and to advocate occasional conformity to the Church of England in, for example, the series of tracts beginning with <span class="italic">Catholick Communion Defended</span> (1684). He was also concerned in negotiations with latitudinarian episcopal divines aimed at effecting comprehension. In 1668 the lord keeper, Sir Orlando Bridgeman, instigated meetings between Baxter, William Bates, and Thomas Manton on the one side (Baxter also informally consulted Owen), and John Wilkins, now bishop of Chester, and his chaplain, Humphrey Burton, on the other. These discussions led to Hale's drawing up a comprehension bill which, however, the Commons refused to entertain. In 1670 Baxter had discussions with Lauderdale, who offered him, with the king's consent, whatever ecclesiastical or academic position in Scotland he might desire, even a bishopric. At the invitation of Broghill, now earl of Orrery, in December 1673 Baxter drew up a paper summarizing what would unite all English protestants against the papists, but the draft was much criticized by George Morley, now bishop of Winchester, to whom Orrery passed it. In 1675 there was a new round of negotiations between Baxter, Manton, Bates, and Matthew Poole and the episcopalians Tillotson and Edward Stillingfleet, encouraged, so it was reported, by Morley, Seth Ward, bishop of Salisbury, Charles Howard, first earl of Carlisle, and George Savile, then Viscount Halifax. These negotiations again came to nothing.<br>
<br>After his brief imprisonment in 1669, Baxter and his wife moved to Totteridge, near Barnet in Hertfordshire. It was there, &#145;in a troublesome, poor, smoaky, suffocating Room, in the midst of daily pains of the Sciatica&#146;, that Baxter wrote his Latin work of systematic divinity, <span class="italic">Methodus theologiae Christianae</span> (1681), intended to make up with <span class="italic">A Christian Directory</span> &#145;one Compleat Body of <i>Theologie</i>, The <i>Latin</i> one the Theory, and the <i>English</i> one the Practical part&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 3.70, 3.190). There he enjoyed the companionship of John Corbet, his friend from the 1640s, who, with his wife, in the summer of 1670 went to live in the Baxters' house. When, in March 1672, Charles II's declaration of indulgence was issued, Baxter hesitated before applying for a licence to preach. In common with many, he suspected that the papists were the beneficiaries chiefly intended; he had misgivings about the legality of the indulgence and doubted it would be confirmed by parliament; he was chary of any expedient as arbitrary as the exercise of the royal prerogative; but above all, toleration of dissenting religious opinion and practice as a national policy would spell the end of his hopes of a comprehension which could accommodate that diversity within a national church: it would institute nonconformity within the religious life of the nation. Nevertheless, on 25 October Baxter did eventually apply for a licence, provided that it were issued to him as &#145;a mere Nonconformist&#146;, rather than in the name of a particular sect or denomination. The licence was issued to him as &#145;a Nonconforming Minister&#146; on 27 October, and, unusually, it authorized him to preach &#145;in any licensed or allowed Place&#146;  (Turner, 1.575). He preached publicly for the first time since 1662 on 19 November 1672.<br>
<br>Although parliament compelled the king to withdraw the indulgence on 7 March 1673 Baxter's period of retirement was over. For the rest of his life he preached and ministered as and where he could (though never gathering a congregation of his own and always with respect to parishioners' obligation to their parish church). He was first invited to become one of the Merchants' lecturers at Pinners' Hall, though after delivering four lectures claims that he opposed congregationalism and that he &#145;Preached up <i>Arminianism</i>, and Free-Will, and <i>Man's Power</i>&#146; led him to withdraw  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 3.103). At Easter 1673 he and his wife moved to a house in Southampton Square (now Bloomsbury Square). With her active and resourceful encouragement, rooms were hired over St James's market house in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields where Baxter preached each morning. He preached also, with the assistance of Joseph Read, in a meeting-house built at his wife's instigation in Dyott Street, Bloomsbury. On Thursdays he preached at a meeting-house in Fetter Lane, off Fleet Street in Holborn. These activities led to prosecutions under the second <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span>, which were ineffective, but in June 1675 he had to submit to a warrant for the distraint of &pound;50 worth of goods. He and his wife then moved from Southampton Square to a house in Oxendon Street, running parallel to Haymarket, where his wife built a meeting-house, but after Baxter had preached there only one day, Sir Henry Coventry, secretary of state, whose house was adjoining in what became Coventry Street, had a warrant issued for Baxter's arrest. Baxter eluded the officers and retired to the house of his friend Richard Beresford at Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire. During this visit in the second half of 1675 he engaged in a seven-hour public debate with the leading Quaker William Penn, followed by an exchange of letters. When he returned to London, Baxter refrained from public preaching, such was the closeness of the watch kept upon him by the authorities. On 16 April 1676 he began to preach again at a meeting-house hired by his wife in Swallow Street, off Piccadilly. On 9 November 1676, however, he had to desist since constables with a warrant set guard upon the door to the meeting-house. When, after this incident, Baxter, on the recommendation of Lauderdale, spoke to Henry Compton, bishop of London, about his situation, there was an outcry that the bishop, who &#145;spake very fairly, with peaceable words&#146;, &#145;was Treating of a Peace with the Presbyterians&#146;  (ibid., 3.178). Margaret Baxter then recommended that Baxter should preach each Sunday to a congregation in Globe Alley, Southwark, whose minister, Thomas Wadsworth, had died on 26 October 1676, which he was able to do throughout 1677 without disturbance by law officers.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsanddeath"></a>Last years and death</h2>During the 1680s Baxter sustained a series of trials and adversities. The decade opened with a succession of bereavements, including, in 1680, the deaths of his friends John Corbet and Henry Ashurst, for both of whom Baxter preached and published funeral sermons (1681), and, most grievously, on 14 June 1681 of his wife, of whose life he published <span class="italic">A Breviate</span> (1681). It was under the emotional pressure of his grief at her death that he published his <span class="italic">Poetical Fragments</span> (1681). In October 1682 constables executed warrants to distrain goods to the value of &pound;195 in fines for preaching, taking all his possessions, &#145;even the bed that I lay sick on&#146;, and &#145;threatned to com upon me again&#146;, so that Baxter had &#145;utterly to forsake my House and Goods and all, and take secret Lodgings distant in a stranger's House&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 3.191). In November 1684 he was again arrested, and bound over to good behaviour in the sum of &pound;400. And then, at the instigation of L'Estrange, so Baxter believed, he was arrested on 28 February 1685 and imprisoned in the king's bench prison, Southwark, to be brought before Judge George Jeffreys to answer the charge that passages in his <span class="italic">Paraphrase on the New Testament</span> (1685) were seditious. (To the second edition of 1695 is appended Baxter's own account of the cause of his imprisonment, with the accused passages  (see Keeble and Nuttall, 2.283&#150;4).) Even within the records of proceedings conducted by that intemperate and partisan judge, Jeffreys's behaviour towards Baxter was a scandal and a disgrace to his profession. Among the extant Baxter letters there is an eyewitness account, written ten years later, of Baxter being supported at the bar by Henry Ashurst (1645&#150;1711), the son of Baxter's old friend, created a baronet in 1688, while Jeffreys was &#145;driveing on furiously, like that Great Hanebal, makeing his way over the alps with fire and vinegar, pouring all the contempt and scorn upon him, as if he had ben a link boy or rak kennel&#146; (a rake-kennel was a scavenger)  (ibid., 2.331). Baxter's bearing under this onslaught so impressed Tillotson that he later wrote to Sylvester &#145;Nothing more honourable than when the Reverend Baxter stood at bay, berogued, abused, despised&#151;Never more great than then&#146;  (ibid., 2.330). Baxter was found guilty, fined 500 marks, and imprisoned until it was paid. He returned to prison, though he passed at least some of his term of confinement in a nearby private house. During these eighteen months he devoted himself to sustained study of the book of <span class="roman">Revelation</span>, engaging in a correspondence with the millenarian Thomas Beverley, with whose confident predictions of the apocalypse he was to disagree in <span class="italic">The Glorious Kingdom of Christ</span> (1691) and <span class="italic">A Reply to Mr. Tho. Beverley's Answer</span> (1691).<br>
<br>Through the good offices of William Herbert, then marquess of Powis, Baxter's fine was remitted on 24 November 1686 and he moved to a house in Charterhouse Yard (now Charterhouse Square) in Finsbury. There he assisted Sylvester to minister to his congregation in Rutland House, preaching, when his health allowed, every Sunday morning and alternate Thursdays. He welcomed the revolution of 1688 and the accession of William in an unpublished paper, &#145;King James his abdication of the crown plainly proved&#146;  (Thomas, 24b), and in <span class="italic">R. Baxters Sence of the Subscribed Articles of Religion</span> (1689) gratefully accepted the provisions of the <span class="roman">Act of Toleration</span>. He had not, however, abandoned his old hopes: in <span class="italic">An End of Doctrinal Controversies</span> (1691) he published &#145;a Summary of <i>Catholick</i> reconciling <i>Theology</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 3.182); in <span class="italic">Church Concord</span> (1691) he supported the Happy Union of Presbyterians and Independents; and he looked still towards a comprehensive national protestant church, whose reformed character he defended <span class="italic">Against the Revolt to a Foreign Jurisdiction</span> (1691), that is, of Rome. Still, too, he sought to safeguard protestant doctrine from antinomianism in <span class="italic">The Scripture Gospel Defended</span> (1690), a piece provoked by the republication of the sermons of Tobias Crisp, though by so doing he exacerbated the doctrinal differences within nonconformity which were to lead to the breakup of the Happy Union in 1692.<br>
<br>Baxter died on 8 December 1691, in Charterhouse Yard, after a steady decline during the previous months. He was buried, like his wife, in Christ Church Greyfriars. The funeral sermon was preached by William Bates and published in 1692. By his will of 27 July 1689, proved on 23 December 1691, Baxter left property in Eaton Constantine to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1739/', "William Baxter")</script>, his first cousin once removed. He left to Sylvester his books, with directions that they should be distributed among young students, and his manuscripts, with instructions that they were to be published only with the approval of William Lorimer, Thomas Doelittle, Roger Morrice, or Daniel Williams. Five works were posthumously published (most notably the autobiographical <span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1696, edited by Sylvester), but a great mass of papers remains unpublished&#151;held, with Baxter's letters, in Dr Williams's Library, London.<h2>
<a name="Literarycareer"></a>Literary career</h2>Even in the Kidderminster years, amid association and parochial business, Baxter's &#145;Writings were my chiefest daily Labour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.84). He was a quite exceptionally prolific writer, the author of more than 130 books (the exact figure depends upon how works published in a variety of forms are counted), several of them folios over 1 million words in length, as well as of hundreds of letters and unpublished papers and treatises. The majority of his published works are exercises in homiletic, catechetical, practical, or controversial divinity, but he essayed also meditative works, biblical commentary and paraphrase, poetry, historiography, biography and autobiography, and, in <span class="italic">The Poor Mans Family Book</span> (1674), a dialogic fiction in the manner of Arthur Dent. These works enjoyed an unprecedented popularity, many titles&#151;notably <span class="italic">The Saints Everlasting Rest</span> and <span class="italic">A Call to the Unconverted</span> (1658)&#151;going through repeated printings. Puritanism had always utilized the press, but there had never been a literary career like this, either in scale or in success: Baxter was the first author of a string of best-sellers in British literary history.<br>
<br>Baxter received nothing for his publications. It was his custom to receive from his publisher copies of the published text in lieu of a fee; these he gave away  (see Keeble and Nuttall, 2.287&#150;8, for an account of these arrangements). Until 1681 his publisher was the Kidderminster bookseller Nevill Simmons; he was succeeded by B. Simmons, probably his widow, who had perhaps to give up the business as a consequence of having published the <span class="italic">Paraphrase on the New Testament</span>, her last known imprint. Thereafter Baxter used booksellers such as Thomas Parkhurst who specialized in nonconformist writing. After the Restoration he had the provisions of the <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span> with which to contend. It was his rule not to evade the law by surreptitious printing without licence, but in order to procure licences he had several times to excise passages which offended the censor. Marvell's antagonist, Samuel Parker, refused to license the manuscript of <span class="italic">The Cure of Church Divisions</span>. What was withheld as unpublishable became evident when, with the lapse of the act in 1679, Baxter published within two years a succession of defences of nonconformity, beginning with <span class="italic">The Nonconformists Plea for Peace</span> (1679). There followed its <span class="italic">Second Part</span> (1680), its <span class="italic">Defence</span> (1680), <span class="italic">An Apology for the Nonconformists Ministry</span> (1681), <span class="italic">A Second True Defence of the Meer Nonconformists</span> (1681), and <span class="italic">A Third Defence of the Cause of Peace</span> (1681).<br>
<br>This literary career was not planned or premeditated. Baxter himself maintained that every one of his titles was &#145;<i>extorted</i>&#146; from him by &#145;<i>sudden unexpected occasion</i>&#146; and written &#145;by the unexpected conduct of Gods urgent Providence&#146; (<span class="italic">Right Method for a Settled Peace of Conscience</span>, 1653, prefatory epistle, sig. b2<i>v</i>, and <span class="italic">Paraphrase on the New Testament</span>, 1685, sig. A3; Keeble and Nuttall, 1.97, 2.267), and many were addressed to a pressing need; but Baxter was ready with his pen upon even slight occasion. He wrote with extraordinary facility and at great speed. Tillotson &#145;oft pressed him to let his books lie by him some time, &amp; to review them again &amp; again, but could never prevail with him, who said, they must come forth so, or not at all&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 2.329). Baxter's wife was of a similar mind, believing he would have &#145;done better to have written fewer Books, and to have done those few better&#146;  (Baxter, <span class="italic">Breviate</span>, 9), and privately Baxter himself came to agree &#145;that fewer well studied and polished had been better&#146;. Written &#145;in the crowd of my other Imployments, which would allow me no great Leisure for Polishing and Exactness, or any Ornament&#146;, they had no literary pretensions  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.124). Their business was pastoral: &#145;the Writings of Divines are nothing else but a preaching the Gospel to the eye, as the <i>voice</i> preacheth it to the ear&#146;  (Baxter, <span class="italic">Christian Directory</span>, 1.2.60). Nevertheless, though he published too much, and can be both prolix and repetitive, Baxter is a very considerable writer, remarkable for the unaffected directness of his style, the intimacy of his address to the reader, the interest of his autobiographical and anecdotal digressions, the range of his curiosity, his gift for effective imagery, and his frequently moving homiletic rhetoric.<br>
<br>Five works stand out from the mass of his publications: <span class="italic">The Saints Everlasting Rest</span> has a permanent place within the canon of devotional literature; readers continue to be inspired by the pastoral fervour of <span class="italic">The Reformed Pastor</span>; the <span class="italic">Call to the Unconverted</span> (1658) is a classic of puritan evangelism; the <span class="italic">Breviate</span> is one of the most affecting of seventeenth-century biographies, unique in its intimate record of a marital relationship; and, above all, the <span class="italic">Reliquiae</span>, which, despite the muddle of its organization, the inaccuracies of its text, and its omission of passages from Baxter's manuscript (much of which is still extant in Dr Williams's Library), is one of the outstanding achievements of early autobiographical writing and an indispensable historical source for the later seventeenth century. Although Sylvester's inadequacies as an editor have been frequently lamented, no one has yet undertaken a full scholarly edition of this work. It is known chiefly through the abridgement first published by J. M. Lloyd Thomas in 1925 which presents a coherent text but at the expense of the extraordinarily compendious character of the original, its comprehensive account of current affairs, its wide-ranging curiosity, and its vital engagement with contemporary controversies, political and ecclesiastical. It is both a greater and more idiosyncratic work than any abridgement could represent.<br>
<br>Both that curiosity and that disputatiousness are much in evidence in Baxter's correspondence. He was an indefatigable and voluminous letter-writer, as willing to answer the least query from a troubled parishioner as to argue a theological case with a university professor, or to respond to an unsolicited enquiry from a reader of one of his books as to approaches from peers and politicians. The 1200 or so extant letters exchanged with some 350 correspondents afford a richly varied insight not only into Baxter's own thinking and relationships, but also into the culture of the times as it was lived and experienced at every level (or, at least, every literate level) of society. The largest single group among Baxter's correspondents consists of some seventy men who became nonconformist ministers at the Restoration, but the interest of the letters is not confined to the history of nonconformity, ecclesiastical affairs, or theological controversy. Baxter was an acute enquirer into matters arcane and mundane, inveterately interested in both public affairs and individuals' experience, encyclopaedically industrious in establishing the grounds for the opinions which, for over half a century, he freely discussed in letters with persons of every walk of life, from peers, the gentry, and members of the professions, to merchants, apprentices, farmers, and seamen. The result is not merely a rich historical archive: the range of this correspondence, the vitality of its engagement with a great variety of topics, the immediacy of its expression, and the unpredictabilities of its mood and tone make this collection a record of felt experience unique among early epistolary archives.<h2>
<a name="Baxterianism"></a>Baxterianism</h2>Though he was very chary of prophetic radicalism, Baxter could respond to intimations of the divine as enthusiastically, even mystically, as any Quaker. He was equally sensitive to more disturbing supernatural phenomena, believing in witchcraft and in ghosts: one of his last works was a collection of evidences of <span class="italic">The Certainty of the Worlds of Spirits</span> (1691). Nevertheless, and despite his inveterate disputatiousness and a temperament which could be impatient, irritated, and severe, Baxter valued reasonableness, good sense, and moderation. Works such as <span class="italic">The Unreasonableness of Infidelity</span> (1655) and <span class="italic">The Reasons of the Christian Religion</span> (1667) demonstrate affinities with the Cambridge Platonists and set Baxter in the line of developing rationalism which was to lead to John Locke and the deists. In all the century's ecclesiological and doctrinal disputes, he sought a middle way. On church order, &#145;You could not (except a Catholick Christian) have trulier called me, than an <i>Episcopal-Presbyterian-Independent</i>&#146;  (Baxter, <span class="italic">Third Defence</span>, &#145;Answer to Hinckley&#146;, 110). In doctrine he followed Amyraldus (Mo&iuml;se Amyraut) in developing a mean between Calvinism and Arminianism which maintained the decree of election but rejected predestined reprobation and a limited atonement. <span class="italic">Richard Baxter's Catholick Theologie</span> (1675) sought to reconcile the opposed doctrinal camps. Similarly, as a nonconformist Baxter refused to separate wholly from the established church and practised occasional conformity.<br>
<br>This repeated transgression of partisan boundaries makes Baxter a subtle and elusive figure; but it also testifies to an almost visionary consistency and simplicity (in the best sense) in his thought. He declined to accept any denominational label, always describing himself as a &#145;meer Christian&#146; (a term later taken up by C. S. Lewis), &#145;catholick Christian&#146;, or &#145;mere Catholick&#146;:<blockquote>the Church that I am of is the Christian Church, and hath been visible wherever the Christian Religion and Church hath been visible: But must you know what Sect or Party I am of? I am against all Sects and dividing Parties: But if any will call <i>Meer Christians</i> by the name of a <i>Party</i> &hellip; I am of that Party which is so against Parties: If the Name of CHRISTIAN be not enough, call me a CATHOLICK CHRISTIAN. (Baxter, <span class="italic">Church-History</span>, &#145;What history is credible&#146;, sig. b1)</blockquote>To his application for a licence under the 1672 indulgence he appended a statement of &#145;My Case&#146; which began:<blockquote>My Religion is meerly Christian &hellip; The Church which I am a member of is the universality of Christians; in conjunction with all particular Churches of Christians in England or elsewhere in the world, whose communion according to my capacity I desire. (Keeble and Nuttall, 2.140)</blockquote>When asked to define this &#145;mere Christianity&#146; he referred to the creed, decalogue, and Lord's prayer, refusing further elaboration. To his mind, confessions of faith were invariably divisive because invariably troubling to some sincere consciences. In any case, words are never adequate to express the divine will and nature. With remarkable boldness, at the meetings in London in 1654&#150;5 he had argued that &#145;no particular Words in the World are <i>Essentials</i> of our Religion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 2.198). Such liberalism was at once infuriating in its vagueness and intolerable in its laxity to more doctrinaire contemporaries, be they Independent or episcopalian.<br>
<br>Baxter might allow only that he adhered to the belief and practice of the primitive church, but within his own lifetime the emphases of his thought and ministry were recognized as constituting a distinctively Baxterian position. Baxter records having heard the adjective &#145;Baxterian&#146; in 1680, but as early as 1653 it was used by John Crandon in the prefatory epistle of his <span class="italic">Mr. Baxters Aphorismes Exorcized</span> and in 1659 by the Fifth Monarchist John Rogers  (J. Rogers, <span class="italic">A Christian Concertation with Mr. Prin</span>, 1659, 6). For Baxter's critics the term denoted confused thinking: &#145;<i>Baxterianism</i> &hellip; is a meer Gallimophery, Hodg-podg Divinity&#146;  ([S. Young], <span class="italic">Vindiciae anti-Baxterianae</span>, 1696, 111). By the end of the century, however, those sympathetic to Baxter's desire to moderate differences constituted a recognizable strand in dissent to which belonged, for example, Manton, Bates, Howe, and, in the next generation, Daniel Williams and Edmund Calamy. It was Calamy who, in his 1702 abridgement of the <span class="italic">Reliquiae</span> and its successive enlargements, transformed Baxter's autobiographical papers into a history of nonconformity and a comprehensive record of the lives of ejected ministers; and in his <span class="italic">Defence of Moderate Nonconformity</span> (1703&#150;5) he passed the Baxterian tradition to the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>Baxter was especially admired by Philip Doddridge and by John Wesley and he continued to be revered by nineteenth-century dissent for his combination of commitment with catholicity, of zeal with reasonableness, qualities which commended him to Church of England clergy quite as strongly as to nonconformists. The list of those who have written admiringly of him crosses all shades of ecclesiastical and theological opinion: William Blaikie, John Brown, Coleridge, Alexander Gordon, Hensley Henson, William Magee, Geoffrey F. Nuttall, John Ryle, Arthur Stanley, John Stoughton, Richard Trench, John Tulloch. In its interdenominational character this list (which could easily be extended) is a fine and fitting testimony to the genius of Baxterianism.<br>

<a name="cosubject_67877"></a><span class="headword">Margaret Baxter <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Charlton]</span></span>  (<em>bap. </em>1636, <em>d.</em> 1681), <span class="occ">religious nonconformist and wife of Richard Baxter</span>, was born in Apley Castle, near Wellington, Shropshire, the second daughter of Francis Charlton (<i>d</i>. 1642) and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1661). She was baptized in Wellington parish church on 18 September 1636. The Charltons were long established gentry, &#145;one of the Chief Families in the county&#146;  (Baxter, <span class="italic">Breviate</span>, 1). After her husband's death on 22 November 1642, Mary Charlton married Thomas Hanmer, to protect her family in time of war and to prevent the estate's heir, Margaret's younger brother Francis (1639&#150;1698), from becoming the ward of his uncle Robert Charlton, the &#145;next heir&#146;, whom she distrusted  (ibid., 2). Hanmer was a royalist and in March 1643 he agreed to a demand from the lord lieutenant of Shropshire, Arthur Capel, first Baron Capel, that Apley Castle should be fortified and garrisoned, but in 1644 it was won by parliamentarian forces, plundered, and Hanmer taken prisoner. The children, including Margaret, witnessed this engagement. It appears that Robert Charlton then took charge of the children, but that some time later Mary Hanmer, &#145;by great wisdom and diligence, surprised them&#146; and conveyed them &#145;to one Mr. <i>Bernards</i> in <i>Essex</i>&#146;  (ibid.). She then managed the estate until the marriage in 1655 or 1656 of Francis to Dorothy, daughter of Oliver St John.<br>
<br>In 1655 or 1656 Mary Hanmer rented a house in Kidderminster and moved there in order, it appears, to be under Richard Baxter's ministry. Her son Francis Charlton believed that Baxter exerted an undue influence over his mother, turning her against him. Margaret Charlton stayed for a time in Oxford with her sister, Mary (<i>b</i>. 1631), wife of Ambrose Upton, canon of Christ Church, where a sermon by Henry Hickman &#145;much moved her&#146; and induced &#145;serious thoughts on her present state, and her salvation&#146;  (Baxter, <span class="italic">Breviate</span>, 4). By early 1658 she had joined her mother in Kidderminster. The next year she endured a prolonged spiritual crisis and also a period of serious ill health. Passages she extracted from letters of counsel received from Baxter during this period, together with extracts from her own papers of self-analysis and meditation, which Baxter saw only after her death, were printed by him in the <span class="italic">Breviate</span>. Her recovery of good health she attributed to Baxter's prayers, and of faith to his ministerial care. On 10 April 1660 a service of thanksgiving was held for her. The preceding night she reaffirmed her covenant with God in a paper  (ibid., 10&#150;21) which in <span class="italic">Poetical Fragments</span> Baxter versified in a poem from which derives the hymn &#145;Lord, it belongs not to my care&#146;  (Baxter, <span class="italic">Poetical Fragments</span>, 81&#150;3).<br>
<br>Two days later Baxter set out for London, and, probably in the summer, Margaret Charlton and her mother followed, taking rooms in Sweetings Alley (now Aldersgate Street), off Threadneedle Street, close to Baxter's accommodation with his friend Thomas Foley in Austin Friars. In January 1661 Mary Hanmer died. Baxter preached her funeral sermon at St Mary Magdalen, Milk Street, and, though no copy is known, apparently published it, since in 1682 it was &#145;reprinted at the desire of her Daughter, before her death&#146; as <span class="italic">The Last Work of a Believer</span>. A relationship between Baxter and Margaret Charlton was rumoured in London in 1661. On 29 April 1662 a licence was granted for their marriage, which took place on 10 September at St Benet Fink, performed by Baxter's old friend Samuel Clarke. The difference in bride and groom's ages and social status occasioned much comment (she brought a dowry of &pound;1650). For the remainder of her life Margaret Baxter was to sustain her husband with emotional, spiritual, and material support without which, it may fairly be conjectured, he could hardly have survived the adversities of the years ahead. To his deep affection for her, and indebtedness to her, he gives moving testimony in the <span class="italic">Breviate of the Life of Margaret Baxter</span> (1681).<br>
<br>From the <span class="italic">Breviate</span> it appears that Margaret Baxter, though a truly devout woman, remained prone to misgivings and doubts about her own sincerity. Her &#145;too timerous and tender a nature&#146; and her vulnerability to &#145;a diseased fearfulness&#146; her husband attributed in part to her childhood experience of the war  (Baxter, <span class="italic">Breviate</span>, 9, 76). She was, nevertheless, of resolute character, full of initiative and resourcefulness, which, with her willingness to expend her estate on his behalf, enabled her repeatedly to secure London properties for her husband to preach in. She accompanied him to Clerkenwell prison in 1669 and &#145;was never so chearful a Companion&#146; as then, having brought with her &#145;so many Necessaries, that we kept House as contentedly and comfortably as at home&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 3.50&#150;51). He &#145;never knew her equal&#146; in practical divinity: she was, in her husband's view, &#145;<i>better at resolving a case of conscience than most Divines that ever I knew in all my life</i>&#146;, so that he came &#145;to put all, save secret cases, to her&#146;  (Baxter, <span class="italic">Breviate</span>, 67, 68); it may be conjectured that in its directions and resolutions <span class="italic">A Christian Directory</span> preserves something of Margaret Baxter's advice.<br>
<br>John Corbet's wife, Frances, who had returned to live with the Baxters after the death of her husband in December 1680, was with Margaret Baxter when she died on 14 June 1681. Margaret was buried on 17 June in her mother's grave in the chancel of Christ Church Greyfriars. John Howe, her husband's friend since the 1650s, preached and published the funeral sermon. From her will of 10 February 1670 it appears that prior to her marriage Thomas Foley, Richard Hampden, and John Swinfen had been appointed trustees of her estate; they were required after her death to disburse the (unspecified) remainder of her estate as she had signified to her husband.<br>
