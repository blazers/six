<span class="headword">Stevenson,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1719&#150;1783), <span class="occ">physician</span>, born in Ireland, was first cousin to Andrew Thomas Stewart, sixth Baron Stewart of Stewart Castle, co. Tyrone. The Stewarts moved to Scotland at the beginning of the eighteenth century, and it may be for this reason that Stevenson received his medical education at the University of Edinburgh. Here he studied under Alexander Monro (1697&#150;1767) and his son, also called Alexander Monro (1733&#150;1817), John Rutherford (1695&#150;1779), Robert Whytt, and William Cullen. He graduated MD with the inaugural thesis &#145;De diab&egrave;te&#146;, and remained in the city for two more years, partly to study medicine further and partly for instruction in divinity. He was one of the earliest members of the Edinburgh Medical Society, founded in 1737, and he appears to have served for a time in the army, for he says that he &#145;was formerly commander of one of his majesty's forts&#146;. He practised for some time at Coleraine in Ireland, and then moved to Wells in Somerset, where he was practising as a physician in 1779. He lived for a short time at Bath, but moved to Newark, Northamptonshire, at the end of May 1781.<br>
<br>A Presbyterian in religion and a Jacobite in politics, Stevenson in his later years was constantly at variance with his surroundings. He hated the apothecaries, he despised the Royal College of Physicians, and he abhorred the therapeutic measures adopted by his contemporaries. His pen was venomous, and he spent his life lampooning and being lampooned. He appears to have been a shrewd physician, magnifying his calling, disbelieving in the efficacy of drugs or of bleeding, but with an abiding faith in the curative value of blisters and issues. He took the opportunity to attack the views of his contemporaries, his reviewers, and the colleges of medicine in his works, which were: <span class="italic">A successful method of treating the gout by blistering, with an introduction consisting of miscellaneous matter</span> (1779); <span class="italic">Cases of medicine interspersed with strictures occasioned by some late medical transactions in the town of Newark</span> (1782); <span class="italic">Dr Stevenson's reply to a letter addressed to Dr Stevenson of Newark by Ed. Harrison</span> (1782); <span class="italic">Candid animadversions on &hellip; a singular gouty case, to which are prefixed strictures on royal medical colleges, likewise a summary opinion of the late disorder called the influenza</span> (1782); and <span class="italic">Considerations on the dangerous effects of promiscuous blood-letting and the common preposterous administration of drugs, with other coincident subjects, medical and moral</span> (1783). The last work was left incomplete, and was published after Stevenson's death.<br>
<br>Stevenson's contemporaries regarded him as a malignant quack, who endeavoured to destroy their lucrative practice by explaining away the remedial action of the Bath waters in gout. Stevenson died at Newark on 13 April 1783.<br>
