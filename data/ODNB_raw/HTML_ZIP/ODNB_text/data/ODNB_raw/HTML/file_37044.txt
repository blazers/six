<span class="headword">Wroth,  Warwick William</span>  (1858&#150;1911), <span class="occ">numismatist</span>, was born on 24 August 1858 at Clerkenwell, London, the eldest son in the family of four sons and four daughters of Warwick Reed Wroth (1825&#150;1867), vicar from 1854 to his death of St Philip's, Clerkenwell, and author of <span class="italic">Sermons, Chiefly Mystical</span> (ed. E. Vaux, 1869). His mother, Warwick Reed's second wife, was Sophia, youngest daughter of Thomas Brooks, of Ealing, Middlesex.<br>
<br>Wroth was educated at the King's School, Canterbury (1867&#150;76), where he was a king's scholar and where he received a sound classical training. He joined the staff of the British Museum as a second-class assistant in the department of coins and medals on 22 July 1878. He was promoted to first-class assistant on 2 August 1887 and became assistant keeper (deputy to the keeper) on 27 July 1906. Promotion being almost invariably by seniority, Wroth was then in line for the keepership, but according to G. F. Hill he was unwilling to accept the restrictions attached to the post, such as residence in the museum. During his career he mainly devoted his energies to a study of Greek coins, and achieved a high reputation both in the UK and on the continent by his continuation of the catalogues of Greek coins at the museum.<br>
<br>Wroth's first four volumes were compiled under the supervision of R. S. Poole and dealt with coins of eastern Greece, beginning with those of <span class="italic">Crete and the Aegean Islands</span> (1886), and continuing with those of <span class="italic">Pontus Paphlagonia, Bithynia and the Kingdom of Bosporus</span> (1889); <span class="italic">Mysia</span> (1892); and <span class="italic">Troas, Aeolis and Lesbos</span> (1894). His two subsequent volumes, <span class="italic">Galatia, Cappadocia and Syria</span> (1899) and <span class="italic">Parthia</span> (1903), were produced by Wroth alone. He then worked on Byzantine coinage, producing <span class="italic">Imperial Byzantine Coins</span> (2 vols., 1908) and the coins of the <span class="italic">Vandals, Ostrogoths and Lombards and of the Empires of Thessalonica, Nicaea and Trebizond</span> (1911). Before his death he returned to Greek coinage, and was preparing to catalogue the coins of Philip II and Alexander III, and the later kings of Macedon and Thrace. He also worked on the Roman, medieval, and English series of coins and the collection of medals, developing a wide general knowledge of the museum's collections.<br>
<br>Between 1882 and 1907 Wroth also contributed to the <span class="italic">Journal of Hellenic Studies</span>, the <span class="italic">Numismatic Chronicle</span>, the <span class="italic">Athenaeum</span>, and the <span class="italic">Classical Review</span>. He co-operated with Barclay Head in 1911 in a new edition of Head's <span class="italic">Historia Numorum</span> (1887). Wroth also contributed memoirs of numismatists, medallists, coin engravers, and others to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> from its inception in 1885 until his death. He is said to have had &#145;a remarkable memory and a genuine artistic taste&#146;  (Hill and Allan, 107). While he is now regarded as an extremely competent cataloguer, he is not considered to have been a great scholar. His work tended to attract such contemporary comments as &#145;exact&#146;, &#145;scientific&#146;, and &#145;orderly&#146;. He is described as &#145;being of a somewhat retiring disposition&#146;  (Hill and Allan, 108) and &#145;in consequence little known except to those who came into contact with him in his official capacity&#146;  (ibid.). He was, however, &#145;courteous but genial&#146;  (ibid.) to museum visitors. His spare time was spent &#145;extending his acquaintance with old London&#146;  (ibid.), on which he was an authority, especially as regards the eighteenth century. He owned a good collection of prints of London. With his brother Arthur Edgar Wroth he published in 1896 <span class="italic">The London Pleasure Gardens of the Eighteenth Century</span>, which embodied many years' research. This was supplemented by a paper on &#145;Tickets of Vauxhall gardens&#146;  (<span class="italic">Numismatic Chronicle</span>, 3rd ser., 1898, 73&#150;92) and by <span class="italic">Cremorne and the Later London Gardens</span> (1907). He had a wide knowledge of English literature. He was elected FSA on 7 March 1889 but had little involvement in the affairs of learned societies.<br>
<br>Wroth did not marry. He died unexpectedly on 24 or 26 September 1911 at Charing Cross Hospital, London, after an operation for peritonitis and was buried on 30 September 1911 after a funeral service at St Andrew's, West Kensington.<br>
