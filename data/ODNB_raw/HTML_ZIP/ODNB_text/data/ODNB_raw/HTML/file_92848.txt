<span class="headword">Hancock,  Norman</span>  (1916&#150;2003), <span class="occ">naval architect</span>, was born on 6 March 1916 at 5 Home Park, Plymouth, the only son of Louis Everard Hancock, a ship fitter in Devonport dockyard, and his wife, Rose Violetta, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bowden. He attended Plymouth grammar school, joining Devonport dockyard at sixteen as a shipwright apprentice. He shone academically and gained a national cadetship to study naval architecture at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, as a probationer in the Royal Corps of Naval Constructors. After achieving near-record marks in all subjects, he was appointed in 1940 to the Admiralty's hydrodynamic test tanks at Haslar, Gosport. On 15 June 1940, in Bath, he married Marie Eva Bow (1916&#150;2003), shorthand typist, and daughter of William Ernest Bow, examiner of dockyard work for the Admiralty; they had two sons, Robin and Mark.<br>
<br>After four years at Haslar, Hancock moved to Bath on promotion to constructor to work under Sir Stanley Goodall, the director of naval construction. His duties required him to examine hundreds of warships damaged in action. When the battle cruiser <i>Hood</i> blew up Hancock disagreed with his superiors about the cause; his claim that the explosion was caused by a shell penetrating an ammunition store amidships was proved right in 2001 when the wreck was filmed for a television programme. At the end of the Second World War he travelled to Germany and Japan to inspect damaged German ships and their designs and to assist the United States Navy in its study of the Japanese fleet. In 1946, acknowledged as an international authority on action damage, he was a British observer at operation Crossroads, the American atom bomb tests at Bikini atoll in the Pacific.<br>
<br>From 1949 to 1952 Hancock was based at Singapore dockyard, before returning to Bath to work on the design of the Salisbury and Leopard class frigates. He introduced large-scale layout drawings and full-scale mock-ups of operational spaces, innovations that became standard practice. Early promotion to chief constructor followed in 1954, in charge of warship research and development. In 1957 he began a five-year appointment as professor of naval architecture at Greenwich, where he quickly gained a reputation as a modernizer, as hard on his lecturers as on his students. After returning to Bath as assistant director of naval construction in 1963 he took charge of all conventional and nuclear fleet submarine design. The Swiftsure class of nuclear submarine was his greatest technical achievement. He rigorously controlled every aspect of the design, introducing innovations in hull form, structural design, sonar, propulsor, machinery, layout, and detailed design to enable major improvements in operational capability, particularly in diving depth, enemy detection, and quietness. Swiftsure was laid down in 1969 and once in service proved to be well in advance of contemporary American and Soviet designs. Six of the class were built, followed by seven Trafalgar class boats developed from Hancock's design.<br>
<br>In 1969 Hancock was appointed director of warship design (the post formerly named director of naval construction), based in Bath. Over the next seven years he was responsible for all Royal Navy surface ship design and procurement, and acted as project director for the introduction of two notable classes of gas-turbine-powered warship. The design of HMS <i>Invincible</i>, the first of three carriers, was largely complete by the end of 1970, although the build contract was delayed by political distractions until 1973. This was the first jump-jet carrier, with an innovative &#145;ski jump&#146; for launching Harrier aircraft. The Broadsword class anti-submarine frigates, whose construction began in 1974, carried two Lynx helicopters, the Seawolf anti-missile system, and advanced electronics. Ships of both classes played a vital role in winning the Falklands campaign of 1982 and made major contributions in the later Gulf conflicts.<br>
<br>Hancock was appointed CB on retirement in 1976. He then spent ten years as a consultant to Marconi on the Stingray torpedo design. He was a liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights and a member of council of the Royal Institution of Naval Architects from 1970 to 1976. He was a keen amateur cabinet maker and an enthusiastic organ player both for his local church and at home, and he and his wife were intrepid travellers. He cared for his wife through a long illness before dying at his home, 41 Cranwells Park, Bath, on 5 August 2003, of ischaemic heart disease. His wife died a few days after him. They were survived by their two sons.<br>
<br>Hancock was a strong-minded man with great drive and determination, combined with an eye for detail. He had little time for those unable to meet his own high standards and could berate less capable staff in front of their peers. With his reputation, high intelligence, pebble glasses, and strong presence, he could make even top civil servants and admirals nervous. However, he pressured staff to achieve great things, and his obvious ability, dry sense of humour, and honest integrity led all who knew him to hold him in great respect. His contribution to the design of Royal Navy warships of the second half of the twentieth century was immense.<br>
