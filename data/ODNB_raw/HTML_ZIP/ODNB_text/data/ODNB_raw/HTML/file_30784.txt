<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Baker, Sir  Geoffrey Harding</span>  (1912&#150;1980), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Murree, India, on 20 June 1912, the only son and youngest of the five children of Colonel Cecil Norris Baker CIE (1869&#150;1934) and his wife, Ella Mary Hutchinson. His father was in the Northamptonshire regiment but bad health restricted his later career to staff appointments. He had been chief paymaster in China during the Boxer uprising. Baker was educated at Wellington College, Berkshire, and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, where he was senior under-officer and won the sword of honour. Tall and fair-haired, he was called George the Swede by his friends: thereafter he was George.<br>
<br>Commissioned into the Royal Artillery in 1932, Baker went with the 11th field brigade from Aldershot to Meerut in 1935. In 1937 he was given his &#145;jacket&#146; in F (Sphinx) battery, Royal Horse Artillery (RHA), at Risalpur. As part of the 4th regiment RHA the battery went to Egypt on mobilization. After attending the Middle East Staff College Baker became brigade major Royal Artillery, 4th Indian division, which fought against the Italians in Eritrea. He was at the battle of Keren and won the MC (1941) for his services in the field. After instructing at the Staff College he was promoted lieutenant-colonel GSO1 at the headquarters of the Eighth Army. He was heard to criticize the failure to concentrate artillery for maximum fire effect, and welcomed the change of policy at El Alamein. He remained on the staff until the Sicilian campaign when he commanded the 127th field regiment, 51st Highland division.<br>
<br>Baker was posted home in 1944 to headquarters, twenty-first army group, as brigadier, general staff, and remained in this demanding post until the end of the war. In 1946 he married Valerie Stirling Hamilton, army officer, daughter of Major John Leonard (Ian) Lockhart, of the Royal Hampshire regiment; they had two sons and a daughter. After commanding the third RHA at M&uuml;nsterlager in the British army of the Rhine (1950&#150;52), he was promoted director of administrative planning in the War Office. When Field Marshal Sir A. F. Harding became governor of Cyprus in 1955 he selected Baker to be chief of staff and director of operations against the dissident organization EOKA. Baker had to operate at many levels, including general headquarters, Middle East, and as well as working with Foreign and Colonial Office staffs oversaw subordinate district security committees which co-ordinated the work of all agencies. Baker showed flair for getting a variety of people to work together on agreed priorities and for evolving sound plans. Although his task was complicated by the Suez operation in 1956 Baker's contribution to pacifying Cyprus, involving twelve major army units, was considerable.<br>
<br>While serving as major-general, chief of staff, southern command, in 1961 Baker was selected for the new post of chief of staff contingencies (Liveoak) at Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers in Europe (SHAPE). Liveoak was set up to deal with the four-power confrontation in Berlin; there the Russians supported, by a surprise show of force, East German measures to restrict emigration to the West. Baker's task was complex and internationally delicate, for stakes being played for over Berlin in 1961&#150;3 were high.<br>
<br>Baker returned to the War Office in 1963 as vice-chief of the Imperial General Staff and lieutenant-general, and his tour was prolonged owing to the abolition of separate service ministries in 1964. He helped to evolve new staff procedures in the Ministry of Defence. After a brief respite as general officer commanding-in-chief, southern command (1966&#150;8), Baker was appointed chief of the general staff in 1968. By then, general retrenchment in defence was following the financial crisis of 1967, and garrisons overseas were being reduced. Baker proved an excellent choice. Trusted and liked, he commanded complete loyalty in the army. In the higher councils of defence he helped to heal the divisions between the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force over the carrier controversy. His sound advice was given in the best way. He was a complete master of committee procedure. Modest, always approachable and courteous to subordinates with problems, he radiated confidence through the sound and sensible advice he gave. Otherwise he let his staff get on with their work without interference.<br>
<br>When the army was committed in Ulster in August 1969, Baker's experience in Cyprus gave him a sure touch. His advice to politicians was sound and he guided commanders on the ground in a constructive way. His visits to Ulster did much to sustain morale and support the troops in carrying out often distasteful duties in the glare of television publicity. Baker was the first of a new type of senior officer, expert in his own field, and enjoying the respect of civil servant, diplomat, politician, and journalist alike. Always calm and capable of sound compromise, he was a man for the time, bringing the army through a period of change yet preserving the best of the past.<br>
<br>On retirement in March 1971 Baker was made field marshal, having been master gunner, St James's Park, since 1970 and colonel commandant Royal Artillery since 1964. He had been appointed OBE (1943), CBE (1946), CB (1955), CMG (1957), KCB (1964), and GCB (1968). He became constable of the Tower in 1975 and was a freeman of the City of London. He was a governor of Wellington and Radley colleges. Baker died at Wellington College on 8 May 1980.<br>
