<span class="headword">Boyce, Sir  (Harold) Leslie</span>, first baronet  (1895&#150;1955), <span class="occ">businessman and politician</span>, was born at Taree, New South Wales, Australia, on 9 July 1895, the third son of Charles Macleay Boyce (1868&#150;1936) and his wife Ethel May Thorne (<i>d</i>. 1943). Boyce attended Sydney grammar school from 1911 to 1913 and maintained links with the institution thereafter. In 1924 he established the London branch of the Old Sydneian's Union and in 1952 he was host at a banquet of London members.<br>
<br>In 1915 Boyce joined the Australian Imperial Force and served as a second lieutenant in the 27th battalion in Egypt and Gallipoli. Promoted to lieutenant in the 27th battalion, he was seriously wounded in July 1916 while fighting on the western front and almost buried alive after being taken for dead. After a lengthy period of convalescence in Britain, he returned to Australia and made a deal with the minister of defence that if he personally raised an infantry unit within six weeks he would be allowed to return with it to active service in France. This he did.<br>
<br>Early in 1919 Boyce entered Balliol College, Oxford, as a colonial military student, supported by a Huth scholarship and scholarships from the Rhodes Trust, and graduated in 1921 having completed the shortened course in modern history. In 1922 he was called to the bar by the Inner Temple and between 1923 and 1926 he worked in commercial law, dealing mainly with cases of damage to British goods and property in the Middle East during the First World War. In 1922 he acted as technical adviser to the Australian representative before the permanent mandates commission of the League of Nations in Geneva. He was later appointed a substitute delegate and legal adviser to the Australian delegation at the third assembly of the league. On 16 July 1926 he married Maybery Browse Bevan (<i>d</i>. 1978), daughter of Edward Philip Bevan of Melbourne. They had three sons.<br>
<br>In 1931 Boyce became managing director and chairman of the struggling Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company. He implemented a plan of reorganization with &#145;energy and vision&#146;  (Amery, 132), economizing in key areas and recruiting his friend Leopold Amery onto the board of directors. The firm gained large orders for railway rolling stock from Canada and Queensland. Profitability was restored and expansion soon followed. Boyce remained managing director of the company until 1945 and chairman until his death. He also held positions with several other companies, sat on the executive committees of various national trade associations, and was chairman of the all-party parliamentary railway group.<br>
<br>In May 1929 Boyce was elected a Unionist MP for Gloucester, his adopted home. He was also high sheriff of Gloucester (1941&#150;2). During the turmoil created by Lord Beaverbrook's empire free trade campaign, he played a minor part in attempts to conciliate the different factions within his party. Sharing a platform with Beaverbrook in Gloucester in February 1930, he stressed the possibilities for a <i>rapprochement</i> between Baldwin and the rogue press baron. In private he suggested a referendum to resolve the issue  (Barnes and Nicholson, 16, 64, 65). In 1930 he accompanied the empire parliamentary delegation to Northern Rhodesia.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Boyce joined the Palace of Westminster company (35th London battalion) of the Home Guard. He also sat on the advisory committee of the Ministry of War Transport and in 1946 led a UK trade mission to China. He lost his Gloucester seat to a Labour opponent at the general election of 1945 and did not sit in parliament again.<br>
<br>As a successful barrister, politician, businessman, and financier, Boyce naturally also developed strong links with the City of London. He was elected alderman for the ward of Walbrook (1942&#150;54), having stressed in his campaign the task of reconstruction that faced the war-ravaged City and the need to &#145;meet modern requirements, and yet preserve inviolate all the ancient rights and privileges, and our immemorial customs&#146;  (Guildhall Library, MS 14809). He was a liveryman of the Loriners' and Carpenters' companies and became master of the Loriners in 1951. He acted as sheriff of the City of London from 1947 to 1948 and lord mayor of London from 1951 to 1952.<br>
<br>Boyce's elevation to the ceremonial pinnacle of the City establishment elicited a variety of responses. The <span class="italic">Gloucester Journal</span> (17 November 1951) was keen to claim him as a son of the town, drawing parallels with his illustrious Gloucestershire predecessor, Dick Whittington. The London <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> (9 November 1951) meanwhile dubbed the event the &#145;austerity Lord Mayor's Show&#146;, owing to a shortened procession that reflected Britain's post-war economic difficulties. For others imperial sentiment distracted attention from budget cuts. Boyce was widely acclaimed as the first dominions-born lord mayor of London, an association further cultivated when the lord mayor's day procession stopped at Australia House to receive an address of congratulation sent by Robert Menzies, the Australian prime minister. At his inaugural banquet Boyce claimed that the City of London remained &#145;the very heart and centre of the British Empire&#151;still the greatest Empire the world has ever known&#146;  (lord mayor's day book, 1951). His Australian origins were later deemed especially significant when he presided over the presentation of the freedom of the City of London to Menzies on 4 June 1952. His career demonstrated the continuing strength of the imperial bond between Britain and the dominions during the decades that followed the Second World War.<br>
<br>Boyce was created KBE in 1944 and a baronetcy was conferred on him in November 1952 at the end of his year of office as lord mayor. His interests included freemasonry (he was senior grand deacon from 1948 to 1949 in the grand lodge of English freemasons) and the St John Ambulance Brigade. He was also one of his Majesty's lieutenants and a JP for the City of London, and sat as a commissioner of the central criminal court, a governor of the Royal Hospitals and chairman of the executive committees of the King George VI Memorial Fund and the King George VI Foundation. He died of heart failure on 30 May 1955 at the Royal Hospital, Southgate Street, Gloucester.<br>
