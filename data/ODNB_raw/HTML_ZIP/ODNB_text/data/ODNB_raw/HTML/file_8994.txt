<span class="headword">Eveleigh,  John</span>  (1748&#150;1814), <span class="occ">college head and university reformer</span>, was born on 22 February 1748, and baptized on 17 March 1748 at Winkleigh, Devon, the eldest of the three sons of John Eveleigh (1716?&#150;1770), rector of Winkleigh, and his wife, Martha, daughter of John Scobell of Nutcombe, Devon. Having matriculated from Wadham College, Oxford, on 15 May 1766 he was elected Goodrich and Pigott exhibitioner of his college in the same year and admitted scholar on 25 September 1767; he was again elected Goodrich exhibitioner, in 1767 and 1769, and was Hody exhibitioner from 1767 to 1770. He graduated BA on 19 January 1770 and was elected fellow of Oriel College on 30 March; he proceeded MA on 25 November 1772, BD on 17 November 1782, and DD on 7 May 1783.<br>
<br>Eveleigh served as vicar of St Mary the Virgin, Oxford, from 1778 until 1781, when he was elected provost of Oriel College on 5 December, in succession to John Clarke. As head of house he also became prebendary of Rochester Cathedral. On his election as college head Eveleigh was released from the statute that prevented college fellows from taking a wife, and married Dorothy, daughter of William Sanford (<i>c</i>.1711&#150;1783), sometime fellow of All Souls. They had a daughter, Jane Dorothy, who was baptized on 14 June 1788 at Lechlade; she married John Heathcote Wyndham, rector of Corton, on 26 April 1813.<br>
<br>Eveleigh proved to be a highly successful provost, and under him the college entered its most illustrious period. Keen to raise its intellectual standing, and frustrated by the restrictions on some fellowships, Eveleigh invited the brilliant young scholar Edward Copleston to accept a vacant fellowship in 1795, even though Copleston did not conform to the stipulation that the candidate should be a native of Wiltshire. Copleston's election and the subsequent method of examining candidates set the pattern for open competition and election on intellectual merit that was soon adopted by other colleges. Furthermore this reform enabled Oriel to attract many other high-calibre fellows, such as John Keble, Richard Whately, and Edward Hawkins, who guaranteed the college's intellectual pre-eminence in Oxford into the mid-nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Eveleigh's innovation at Oriel of selecting fellows by setting them four days of examinations prompted him to suggest that the university should adopt a similarly rigorous system to examine undergraduates. Together with Cyril Jackson, dean of Christ Church, and John Parsons, master of Balliol, Eveleigh secured the examination statute of 1800. This stipulated that candidates for the degree of BA should undergo public examination in grammar, rhetoric, logic, moral philosophy, mathematics, physics, and the Christian religion, notably the doctrinal articles of the Church of England. An additional examination was established for those undergraduates who wished to compete for an honours degree, and the best twelve candidates were ranked according to merit. The new examinations succeeded and a further university statute, of 1807, abolished the list of the twelve best candidates and instead listed candidates alphabetically in two classes, the origins of first- and second-class degrees.<br>
<br>Vicar of Aylesford from 1782 to 1792, Eveleigh delivered the Bampton lectures in Oxford in 1792, which were published as <span class="italic">Eight Sermons</span> in the same year; a second edition, with four additional sermons, appeared in 1794, a third edition, in two volumes, in 1814. He also brought out <span class="italic">The Doctrine of the Holy Trinity</span> (1791) and a few separate sermons. In failing health, Eveleigh spent the summer of 1814 in Brighton, and died at Oxford on 10 December 1814; he was buried in St Mary the Virgin six days later. In his funeral sermon Copleston, who succeeded him as provost, praised Eveleigh's achievements as a university reformer and hailed him as &#145;one of the most strenous originators of the present system of classes and honours&#146;  (Copleston, 28).<br>
