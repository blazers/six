<span class="headword">Balmer,  Robert</span>  (1787&#150;1844), <span class="occ">United Secession minister and theologian</span>, was born at Ormiston Mains, in the parish of Eckford, Roxburghshire, on 22 November 1787, the eldest of four children of Thomas Balmer and Margaret Biggar (<i>d</i>. 1839). Sickly as a child, he later enjoyed tolerably good health apart from problems with his eyesight. His parents were both seceders although they adhered, quite amicably, to different congregations. His father, a land steward, died when Robert was about ten. He attended school, latterly at Morebattle and Kelso, before entering Edinburgh University in 1802. In 1806 he continued his studies at the Associate Synod Divinity Hall at Selkirk, under George Lawson (1749&#150;1820), while also attending divinity classes at Edinburgh University. Thus qualified, he could have opted for the ministry of the established church, and the delay after completing his studies caused some to think that he was contemplating this course. However, he was eventually licensed in August 1812. Ordained minister at Berwick upon Tweed in March 1814, he remained with the congregation at Golden Square for the rest of his ministry. He married Jane, daughter of Alexander Scott of Aberdeen, in 1826.<br>
<br>In 1834 Balmer became professor of pastoral theology to the United Secession church, rapidly exchanging this chair for that of systematic theology. His duties required him to be absent from his congregation for two months each year. In 1840 he was awarded a DD by St Andrews University. A man of liberal instincts both in church and secular affairs, Balmer latterly came under attack from a fellow minister and controversialist, Andrew Marshall (1779&#150;1854). In the course of the atonement controversy, occasioned by James Morison's suspension and deposition for arguing a universalist position, Marshall had formed the view that the church's professors were not only sympathetic to Morison but the very source of his views. Balmer's particular offence was to contribute a recommendatory preface to an unfortunately timed edition of Edward Polhill's <span class="italic">Essay on the Extent of the Death of Christ</span> (1842). Balmer patiently and reasonably explained his position to the satisfaction of his church, though he did not live to see the final resolution of the controversy. In 1843 he distinguished himself at a meeting in Edinburgh to mark the bicentenary of the Westminster assembly, at which he made a powerful speech on Christian union. Beset by a brief but painful illness, he died on 1 July 1844 at Berwick upon Tweed. His funeral there on 9 July attracted some 5000 mourners.<br>
<br>Scrupulous, thoughtful, and unsectarian, Balmer was a man of mild nature and modest bearing. An effective teacher rather than a brilliant scholar, &#145;His views &hellip; were more comprehensive than acute&#146;  (Henderson, 66), as one colleague put it. He published little in his lifetime, but a two-volume <span class="italic">Academical Lectures and Pulpit Discourses</span> (1845) appeared posthumously.<br>
