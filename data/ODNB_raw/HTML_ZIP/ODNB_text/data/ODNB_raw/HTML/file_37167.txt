<span class="headword">Baynton family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1508&#150;1716), <span class="occ">gentry</span>, claimed direct descent from a courtier of Henry II. The quintessential county family, their local significance is still given visible expression in the Baynton chapel in Bromham church, with its tombs and memorials. In the early modern period the head of the family almost always played a leading part in the government of the county&#151;during Elizabeth's reign one of the administrative divisions was known as &#145;Sir Edward Baynton's division&#146;. Their ascent to eminence was launched as much by luck as by merit, however, when John Baynton (<i>d</i>. 1526) inherited Bromham from his cousin Richard Beauchamp, seventh Baron St Amand (<i>d</i>. 1508), and was thereby raised to great riches. Bromham, between Calne and Devizes, thenceforward formed the basis of the wealth and influence which eventually made the Bayntons probably the most prominent gentry family in north central Wiltshire. Court connections under Henry VIII helped them to augment their estates after the dissolution of the monasteries. Some prudent marriages, too, brought more lands. The women of the family are generally little recorded, however, apart from bare details of marriages and passing mention in a few deeds.<br>
<br>John's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_37167"></a><span class="headword">Sir Edward Baynton</span>  (<em>c.</em>1495&#150;1544)<span class="occ"></span>, inherited all his father's estates. Probably knighted in 1522 he was an astute courtier who served in the royal household (he was vice-chamberlain to all save the first of Henry VIII's wives) and on military expeditions to the Scottish borders and France, as well as in local affairs. He sat in the parliaments of 1529 and 1539 as a knight of the shire for Wiltshire, and in that of 1542 as a burgess for Wilton. Probably during his association with Thomas Cromwell he began the family tradition of strong protestantism, and at the dissolution he gained much former monastic land in and near Wiltshire, especially the site of Stanley Abbey and sixteen of its manors. He built an imposing manor house at Bromham, which was said to be almost as large as the king's new court at Whitehall, and which remained the family's chief residence until demolished during the civil war. Edward married, first, Elizabeth Sulyard, and they had four daughters and three sons, Andrew, Edward, and Henry. The second and third sons had the same mother, a fact emphasized in the wills made both by Sir Edward before his death on 27 November 1544 and by his son Edward in 1592. There has been confusion over this, as Sir Edward's second marriage to Isabel Leigh, whom he had married by 1531, produced two sons, one named Henry.<br>
<br>Sir Edward's heir, <a name="cosubject_1784"></a><span class="headword">Andrew Baynton</span>  (<em>c.</em>1516&#150;1564)<span class="occ"></span>, was a scholar who threatened to cut short the family's rise by losing all its land, and left his heirs difficulties and lawsuits which lasted for four decades. Brought up at court he was educated there by the distinguished linguist John Palsgrave. After travels on the continent he entered the service of Thomas Cromwell, while in the early 1540s he served the crown on missions to France and the empire. Between 1545 and 1559 he was five times returned to parliament as MP for Wiltshire or Sussex boroughs, but his later career was dogged by financial anxieties. His father's legacies from the estate, his own debts, and perhaps hopes of further court favour, may explain why he made an extraordinary exchange in 1545, whereby Sir Thomas Seymour was to hold all the Baynton properties, and vice versa, but without security for Baynton heirs. Worse, when Seymour was executed for treason in 1549 both men's property went to the crown. The family's ruin was temporary, as Queen Mary returned his former lands to Baynton. But the latter also negotiated sales of manors to other Wiltshire gentry, including Nicholas Snell and the notorious Gabriel Pleydell. Pleydell and the corrupt Sir William Sharington appear in his will as executors, with his lands assigned to them, probably as a result of deceit or forgery. Further complications surround Andrew's marriage to Phillipa Brulet; debts to her father are mentioned in his successful suit for annulment in 1562 on the grounds of her pre-contract; his brother Edward encouraged his suit. Andrew then married Frances Lee, and they had one daughter, Anne. She did not inherit, for to keep the property in the name of the Bayntons, in 1560 he had entailed the remaining estates on his brother <a name="cosubject_75525"></a><span class="headword">Sir Edward Baynton</span>  (<em>c.</em>1520&#150;1593)<span class="occ"></span>.<br>
<br>This Edward was much embroiled in lawsuits over land. His first wife, Agnes, daughter of Sir Griffith Rhys, whom he married about 1553, had been left an interest in lands belonging to William, Lord Stourton, whose mistress she had been. Stourton's heir tried, but eventually failed, to counter Agnes's claim to Stourton lands, and she and Edward held them from 1557. It is somewhat surprising that Baynton married her: there were rumours that she and Lord Stourton had actually married, and although unfounded they worried the Bayntons. So a memorial brass to Edward Baynton's two wives insisted that Agnes, who died in 1574, was &#145;his first trew wife&#146;  (Kite, 63). Their eldest son, William, died in 1564, allegedly the victim of witchcraft. Their surviving children, out of thirteen, were one son and two daughters. Baynton's second wife was Anne (<i>d</i>. 1578), daughter of Humphrey Packington. Further lawsuits stemmed from his brother Andrew's presumably forged assignment and sales of property to Pleydell, Sharington, and Snell, which conflicted with the previous entail to Edward. Eventually Baynton gained possession by law, and by numerous deeds secured his holdings in Stanley Abbey, Bremhill, his parcels in Chippenham, and other property. He continued to increase his estates by purchase, and became a vital member of the county administration. Knighted in 1574 he represented Wiltshire in the 1563 parliament, and sat twice more for boroughs. He was one of the county's most active JPs, attending quarter sessions very regularly in the 1570s and 1580s, even sending in material until a few months before his death in 1593, and he held other posts from time to time.<br>
<br>Sir Edward's eldest surviving son, <a name="cosubject_75526"></a><span class="headword">Sir Henry Baynton</span>  (1571&#150;1616)<span class="occ"></span>, purchased further lands worth perhaps &pound;3000 from Sir William Throckmorton and Sir Thomas Tracy. He was appointed a deputy lieutenant, and became a JP briefly in 1592 and continuously from 1594. He followed his father's example of hard work in running the county, attending several quarter sessions each year, or sending in recognizances, until eighteen months before his death on 14 October 1616. He was four times a member of parliament, sitting as knight of the shire in 1597. A survey begun in 1612 listed a large tenantry on his manors: he exercised great influence around Bromham, Stanley, Chippenham, and also Bremhill, where he had another substantial house. Bromham was an important weaving centre, but the weavers suffered severely during depressions in the cloth trade. Baynton was a man of conscience: he founded a hospital or almshouse in 1614, probably intended for impoverished weavers, and in his will in 1616 he left significant sums to the vicars and the churches where he held property, as well as &pound;5 to the preacher at Steeple Aston, and money for the poor in several parishes. His executors were other Wiltshire gentry. He had married Lucy, daughter of his father's very good friend Sir John Danvers, another fortunate alliance, for she inherited property through her grandfather. They had two children. Lucy's will left money and rings to her daughter Elizabeth, who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75377/', "John Dutton")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72340/', "Dutton family")</script>], and to her Danvers relations, including an &#145;ashcolour&#146; velvet gown and satin waistcoat and petticoat, and also money for a minister to say the service in Foxham Chapel, in Bremhill parish; she died in 1621 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>Their son <a name="cosubject_75527"></a><span class="headword">Sir Edward Baynton</span>  (1593&#150;1657)<span class="occ"></span> matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 27 April 1610, but is not recorded as taking a degree. He was knighted in 1613, before his father died. Sir Edward played a major role in the county's politics, but was a more quarrelsome man than his ancestors and made many enemies. He married, first, Elizabeth Maynard (<i>d</i>. 1635), with whom he had a son, Edward, and second, Mary Bowell, with whom there were sons, Henry and Nicholas, and a daughter, Mary. His executors were his wife and son Robert. But he was not a faithful husband, and in 1629 he was charged in the court of high commission with neglecting a woman with whom he had had two illegitimate children; King Charles pardoned him for these adulteries and any others.<br>
<br>Office also brought trouble: Baynton was a deputy lieutenant, but in 1632 the sheriff complained that he neglected his duties. As sheriff himself in 1637&#150;8 he clashed with other leading gentry over his harsh tactics in collecting ship money, yet he was also in trouble with the privy council over his accounts in 1639. He had not immediately followed his father as a JP, but was appointed in 1619. He was very active in that capacity, usually attending at least three sessions a year. Like his forebears he dealt with the tiresome between sessions work as well, such as orders for bridge repairs when Calne inhabitants would not pay as requested, and disputes between Bromham cloth workers. He was listed at the head of the Wiltshire JPs in October 1640, though it is not clear whether he was present at quarter sessions in January 1641 when they made a resolution that ship money was contrary to the laws and statutes of the realm.<br>
<br>Baynton sat in every parliament but one up to 1653, having been first elected for Devizes in 1614. He was MP for Chippenham throughout the Short and Long parliaments. By 1640 he supported the parliamentary side, and although wounded in a duel with another MP he commanded Wiltshire parliamentary troops when the civil war began in 1642: ironically his experience as a deputy lieutenant in the king's militia was to help in the fight against the king. In 1643 he had a violent quarrel with his fellow Wiltshire parliamentary commander Sir Edward Hungerford, and this possibly led to Baynton's temporary move towards the king in 1643. His return to the parliamentary cause came at a high cost for his family: in 1645 royalist soldiers destroyed the great house at Bromham. Sir Edward adhered to the more radical group in the Commons, and as an independent retained his seat after Pride's Purge in 1648, sitting to the end of the Rump in 1653; he had been named as one of the king's judges. One of his sons was a royalist.<br>
<br>Like his forebears Baynton sought to add to his family's wealth, making purchases in Wiltshire, so that along with lands inherited from his mother he passed on an increased estate worth nearly &pound;2000 p.a. to his eldest son. Following the destruction of Bromham House he built another house nearby, at Spye Park (described disparagingly by Evelyn in 1654). His will, made in 1657 shortly before his death, has a long religious preface, expressing fervent hopes for redemption&#151;perhaps he regretted his tumultuous personal life.<br>
<br>The eldest son, yet another <a name="cosubject_75528"></a><span class="headword">Sir Edward Baynton</span>  (1618&#150;1679)<span class="occ"></span>, shared his father's commitment to the parliamentary and puritan cause. Like his father he went to Oxford, this time to St John's College, where he matriculated on 15 January 1636, but again like his father cannot be shown to have graduated. He became MP for Devizes in 1640, so that he sat in parliament along with his father up until Pride's Purge in 1648, and assisted his father on committees and in the parliamentary army; captain of horse in 1642 he was a major by 1644. He sat in five further parliaments; defeated in the 1661 election he was returned again in 1675. Although made a knight of the Bath in 1661 he was deeply critical of Charles II and his government; in 1677 he was dismissed as a JP. Bayntun, as he spelt his name, kept a commonplace book between 1657 and 1679 into which he copied political lampoons. The commonplace book also records his activities in local government and his dealings concerning the Baynton lands. He did not marry until 1661, when he married Stuarta, sister of Sir Thomas Thynne of Longleat: they had two sons, Henry and Thomas, and two daughters, Ann and Lucy. But he fell out with his wife, and left her nothing in his will made in 1670, directing that she and her relations were to have no part in his children's education, nor to meddle with their estate.<br>
<br>Sir Edward had a great estate to pass on. He recorded his rents in his commonplace book, which shows that in the 1660s, as in the past, the family's wealth was based upon land. The annual rents from Stanley manor and its dependencies alone amounted to around &pound;730, while those from Bromham, Bremhill, and the smaller estate of Rodbourne added much more, bringing the total of rents and renders (for items like loads of hay) to a little over &pound;2000 per annum for most years in this decade. Income fell slightly in the 1670s, but still amounted to a very substantial yearly revenue. Moreover there are very many tenants named in the lists, a pointer to the influence the Bayntons could normally expect to exert among the surrounding population. They were to encounter unforeseen problems after Sir Edward's death, however. His elder son and heir, <a name="cosubject_75529"></a><span class="headword">Henry Baynton</span>  (1664&#150;1691)<span class="occ"></span> maintained the family tradition of firm protestantism, and also that of representing Wiltshire boroughs (Calne and Chippenham) in parliament, but times had changed&#151;a tory, in contrast to his father and grandfather, he nevertheless feared the threat posed by James II's Catholicism. He would not agree to the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>, and was dismissed from the Wiltshire commission of the peace and deputy lieutenancy in 1688, remaining excluded until the end of James's rule.<br>
<br>In 1685 Henry Baynton had married an heiress, Lady Anne Wilmot, daughter of John, second earl of Rochester, an alliance which promised further increase of the family's estate. Henry was eager to continue the Baynton family name and made hopeful provision for sons and their male heirs for 500 years to come. But his careful plans were doomed; for on 11 July 1691 he died aged only twenty-seven. His son John apparently had problems and had no children, dying in his twenties in 1716; his memorial in Bromham church sadly proclaims that he was the nineteenth in lineal descent from Sir Henry Baynton. But he was the last in direct line. John's will of January 1716 bequeathed the major estates to his sister Anne Rolt's second son, his nephew Edward Rolt, the will specifying that Edward and his heirs take the name of Baynton Rolt. Heads of the Baynton family had struggled for centuries to ensure an unbroken father-to-son hold on Bromham, and the influence this conferred in Wiltshire, but they had been foiled by demographic fate.<br>
