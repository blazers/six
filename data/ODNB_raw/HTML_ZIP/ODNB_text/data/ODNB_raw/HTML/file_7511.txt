<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dent,  Arthur</span>  (1552/3&#150;1603), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious writer</span>, was born at Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, son of William Dent. William's brother John was a London merchant whose widow married Sir Julius Caesar. Having matriculated as a pensioner at Christ's College, Cambridge, in November 1571, Dent graduated BA in 1576 and proceeded MA in 1579. He was ordained deacon at Peterborough in March 1577 and priest, by John Aylmer, bishop of London, the following May, when he gave his age as twenty-four.<br>
<br>Immediately engaged as curate by George Withers, rector of Danbury, Essex, and archdeacon of Colchester, Dent was in the curious position of being protected by one of Aylmer's officials while subject to the unfriendly authority of another, John Walker, archdeacon of Essex. He was cited before Walker for refusing to church women in December 1577, and for conducting an irregular marriage in May 1578, but both charges seem to have been dropped. He received Aylmer's licence to preach throughout London diocese in October 1579.<br>
<br>On 17 December 1580 Aylmer instituted Dent to the rectory of South Shoebury, Essex, on the presentation of Robert, second Lord Rich, who had been showing increasing sympathy towards radical preachers since the mid-1570s. Yet when Rich and Aylmer clashed during the following months over quasi-congregational meetings at Rochford Hall, orchestrated by Robert Wright, Dent appears to have been unsympathetic towards his patron's proceedings.<br>
<br>Thus the evidence for Dent's involvement in the politico-religious agitation of the 1580s is conflicting. During Aylmer's visitation of 1583 he produced his preaching licence and was not further troubled. Yet in March 1584 he was one of seven preachers, including George Gifford, whom Aylmer interviewed about Whitgift's demand for unqualified subscription to the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. Given fourteen days to deliberate, Dent was one of twenty-seven Essex ministers who petitioned the privy council for protection. In July 1584 he was again before Archdeacon Walker on charges of ritual nonconformity, and it was later claimed that he had been &#145;sundry times troubled for omitting the cross and the surplice&#146;  (Peel, 2.164). Yet he escaped prosecution during the visitation of 1586, is not found among those Essex clergy suspended during Aylmer's &#145;last visitation and since for the surplice&#146;  (ibid., 2.261), and was appointed one of six commissioners to oversee exercises for the instruction of the less able clergy in Rochford deanery. Not until 1589 did his persistent failure to wear the surplice receive attention at an episcopal visitation, but again that charge, and the lesser one of omitting weekday services, appears to have been dropped after a routine period of excommunication.<br>
<br>Altogether, once Whitgift had been forced to moderate his original demand for unqualified subscription, Dent was not singled out, like Gifford, as one of the &#145;ringleaders&#146; against whom further measures were to be taken. Yet a ringleader in some sense Dent certainly was: he was involved in discussions about the <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span> (1585&#150;7), and was nominated one of seven Essex delegates to the proposed provincial synod designed to follow the setting up of &#145;presbytery in episcopacy&#146; during the winter of 1586&#150;7.<br>
<br>Aylmer's leniency was no doubt dictated in part by the belligerent support which Dent could expect from his patron, but also, perhaps, by the fact that Dent's temperament was essentially eirenic. His ability to edify rural congregations was legendary, and, like many who abandoned political for pastoral courses after 1590, he translated this skill into print, becoming one of the most popular protestant authors of his generation. His <span class="italic">Sermon of Repentance</span>, preached at Leigh in March 1582, was reprinted at least twenty-two times up to 1638. Dent's third published work, <span class="italic">The Plaine-Mans Pathway to Heaven</span> (1601)&#151;&#145;wherein every man may clearly see whether he shall be saved or damned&#146;&#151;was dedicated to Julius Caesar and enjoyed unparalleled success. Reaching a twenty-fifth edition by 1640, it thus became one of the most frequently reprinted English books of its time. A forty-first edition appeared as late as 1831. It profoundly influenced John Bunyan and also Richard Baxter, who recast it in 1674 as <span class="italic">The Poor Man's Family Book</span>, abandoning Dent's homely dialogue for connected prose.<br>
<br>Dent's fourth work, <span class="italic">The Ruine of Rome, or, An Exposition upon the Whole Revelation</span>, was with the printer when its author succumbed to fever, dying within three days, on about 10 January 1603. His will, dated 7 January, is thus a brief document which left everything to his wife, Margery, &#145;for the education of all my children&#146;  (DL/C/359, fol. 389<i>r</i>). Ezekiel Culverwell, one of its witnesses, saw <span class="italic">The Ruine of Rome</span> through the press, adding a dedicatory epistle to Robert, third Lord Rich. Although his reference to his &#145;near conjunction&#146; with his &#145;late brother&#146; led to the erroneous assumption that Margery Dent was Culverwell's sister, it is possible that the first Mrs Culverwell (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1597), otherwise unidentifiable, was the sister of Dent.<br>
<br>Culverwell extolled Dent's &#145;diligence, yea extreme and unwearied pains in his ministry publicly, privately, at home and abroad for four and twenty years at least&#146;. <span class="italic">The Ruine of Rome</span> appeared only days before Elizabeth's death in 1603, reached a tenth edition by 1656, and seems to have found favour with the eighteenth-century evangelical movement: it was reprinted five more times between 1798 and 1841. Seven posthumous works bearing Dent's name were in print by the end of 1614, some perhaps representing spurious attempts by unscrupulous printers to profit from his popularity.<br>
<br>In 1979 Dent was paid the curious tribute of providing the name of the anti-hero&#151;just as his most influential work informed the title&#151;of Douglas Adams's <span class="italic">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</span>.<br>
