</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Haydn,  (Franz) Joseph</span>  (1732&#150;1809), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 31 March 1732 in Rohrau, Lower Austria, the second of six surviving children of Mathias Haydn (1699&#150;1763), wheelwright, and his wife, Anna Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Koller (<i>bap</i>. 1707, <i>d</i>. 1754), a cook; the third surviving child, Johann Michael Haydn (1737&#150;1806), also pursued a career as a composer.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Haydn's forebears had lived in the area as artisans for several generations and he grew up in a supportive environment in which music was a favoured social recreation. At the age of five or six he moved to Hainburg, also in Lower Austria, to live with a distant relative, Johann Mathias Franck (1708&#150;1783), who as head of the local school and music director at the church developed the young boy's talents as a singer, harpsichord player, and violinist. His musicianship caught the attention of Georg Reutter (1708&#150;1772), kapellmeister of St Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna, who was searching for new recruits for the choir school. In 1739 or 1740 Haydn moved to Vienna where for the next ten years he was immersed in the ritual and rich musical legacy of the Catholic church, nurturing a simple unquestioning piety, the distinctive <i>pietas austriaca</i>, that was to characterize the composer's outlook for the rest of his life. His formal education was patchy&#151;some Latin, religion, arithmetic, and writing, but only minimal theoretical training in music.<br>
<br>At the age of eighteen Haydn's voice broke and he spent most of the 1750s as a freelance musician in Vienna. At the end of his life Haydn liked to imply that he suffered a hand-to-mouth existence but the extent and regularity of his various musical employments suggest that it was a viable and stimulating existence. He met the librettist Pietro Metastasio (1698&#150;1782), the composers Christoph Willibald Gluck (1714&#150;1787) and Georg Christoph Wagenseil (1715&#150;1777), and especially profited from the experience of the Italian composer Nicola Porpora (1686&#150;1768) who, according to Haydn, taught him &#145;the true fundamentals of composition&#146;  (Robbins Landon, 2.398). He played the violin at court balls during carnival, was an occasional singer at the imperial chapel and at St Stephen's, played the organ and violin in various church services, taught the keyboard, took part in the local tradition of instrumental serenading, and composed music for a German theatre company. As the range of patrons expanded so did Haydn's compositions, which by the end of the period embraced church compositions (including organ concertos), keyboard sonatas and trios, string trios and quartets, and a variety of works for mixed ensembles of wind and strings.<br>
<br>In 1757 (perhaps a year later) Haydn received his first full-time position, as kapellmeister to Count Carl Joseph Franz Morzin (1717&#150;1783) who, like many members of the aristocracy, spent the winter season in Vienna and the summer in a country palace, in his case at Lukavec (Doln&iacute; Lukavice) in the Bohemian countryside south of Pilsen. It was for Morzin that Haydn wrote his first symphonies, perhaps a dozen or more. On 26 November 1760, at St Stephen's, Haydn married Maria Anna Aloysia Apollonia Keller (<i>bap</i>. 1729, <i>d</i>. 1800), the daughter of a wig maker. It was never a happy marriage. Haydn stated that she was not interested in music, and was excessively religious and a spendthrift. There were no children. At about the same time as the wedding Haydn must have become aware of the increasing financial difficulties at the Morzin court; these led in the following months to the disbandment of the musical retinue.<h2>
<a name="EngagementbyPrinceEsterhzy"></a>Engagement by Prince Esterh&aacute;zy</h2>By a stroke of good fortune, Prince Paul Anton Esterh&aacute;zy (1711&#150;1762), one of the richest and most influential aristocrats in the Austrian dominions, had heard some symphonies by Haydn and engaged him in April 1761 as vice-kapellmeister, an assistant to the Esterh&aacute;zys' long-serving but infirm kapellmeister, Gregor Werner (1693&#150;1766), with the promise that he should succeed to the senior position in due course. In one of the most extended and fruitful patronages in the history of music, Haydn was to serve the Esterh&aacute;zy family for the rest of his life, nearly half a century; Prince Paul Anton would be succeeded by his brother Nicolaus (I) (1714&#150;1790), Nicolaus's son, Anton (1738&#150;1794), and, finally, Anton's son, Nicolaus (II) (1765&#150;1833).<br>
<br>Of the four princes Nicolaus (I) was the most enthusiastic in his support of music at his court and of Haydn's development as a composer. As full kapellmeister from 1766 Haydn had an orchestra of between fifteen and twenty-two players at his disposal (the norm for a court orchestra in the Austrian territories) for whom he wrote over sixty symphonies, works that challenged their musical imagination as well as their technique. Rather than follow the typical routine of winters in Vienna and summers in Eisenstadt, a small town near the western border of Hungary, 26 miles south-east of Vienna, Prince Nicolaus preferred to reside in Eisenstadt in the winter and in a new, sumptuous palace named after the family, Eszterh&aacute;za, a further 27 miles to the south-east, deep in the Hungarian countryside; visits to Vienna were typically restricted to a few weeks either side of Christmas. Nicolaus built two opera houses at Eszterh&aacute;za, one for Italian opera, the other for marionette opera in German; as kapellmeister Haydn was responsible for the smooth running of these two establishments and between 1776 and 1790 prepared and directed over 1300 performances of 100 operas, including several of his own composition.<br>
<br>Among the singers at the Esterh&aacute;zy court was Luigia Polzelli, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Moreschi (1749/50&#150;1832), a mezzo-soprano who joined the Esterh&aacute;zy company in 1779 with her husband, Antonio, a violinist. She and Haydn became lovers, and Haydn was probably responsible for the reinstatement of the Polzellis when both were dismissed for not meeting the musical standards of the court in December 1780. Haydn was widely regarded (though apparently never by himself) as the father of Polzelli's second son, Alois Anton Nikolaus, known as Antonio (<i>b</i>. 1783). The relationship endured beyond Haydn's move to London in 1791.<h2>
<a name="Wideningfame"></a>Widening fame</h2>Haydn said of his period at the court of Prince Nicolaus Esterh&aacute;zy, &#145;I was set apart from the world, there was nobody around to confuse and annoy me in my course, and so I had to be original&#146;  (Griesinger, 24&#150;5). While it is easy to exaggerate Haydn's isolation it is also true that he was, until his late fifties, one of the least travelled of major composers. Gradually, however, and with increasing momentum towards the 1780s, Haydn's instrumental music became known throughout Europe. His symphonies were first published in Paris in 1764 and his earliest quartets were available in imported editions in London in the following year. In these two cities in particular Haydn's music by the 1780s dominated concert life; there was hardly a concert that did not feature a work by him. Eager to capitalize on the enthusiasm of the public for Haydn's music, the English publisher William Forster (1739&#150;1808) in 1781 established direct contact with the composer, which effectively gave him the English rights for many of Haydn's latest symphonies and quartets. From this popularity arose regular invitations in the 1780s to visit London, where it was envisaged that Haydn would write an opera for the King's Theatre as well as new symphonies. But Haydn's duties as kapellmeister at the Esterh&aacute;zy court obliged him to turn down these invitations. More frustrating for the composer was the limited time he was able to spend in Vienna, whose burgeoning salon culture he valued. Although contact with Mozart was, consequently, rather sporadic it was firmly founded on mutual admiration and affection; in 1785 Mozart dedicated a set of quartets to Haydn, the pre-eminent master of the genre, &#145;celebrated Man and my dearest Friend&#146;  (published letter of dedication, 1 Sept 1785, Robbins Landon, 2.673).<br>
<br>In September 1790 Prince Nicolaus died. His successor, Prince Anton, wished to curtail the expenditure of the court and disbanded most of the musical retinue, but out of affection and loyalty retained Haydn in what was now a sinecure position. For the first time for over forty years he was a free agent. Offers of employment were received from Ferdinand IV of Naples and Prince Nicolaus's son-in-law, Prince Anton Grassalkovics, but Haydn's imagination was captured by the proposal of the London impresario and violinist Johann Peter Salomon, who had travelled especially to Vienna to secure his services. By mid-December, Haydn had agreed to visit London to become the central attraction in a hastily arranged subscription concert season, and to compose an opera for the King's Theatre. For London audiences the visit was a natural enhancement of the central position that the composer already enjoyed in the city's musical life. Haydn was to respond with a notable expansion of his musical style and, no less remarkable for this dutiful kapellmeister, a willingness to assume the role of a social celebrity.<h2>
<a name="FirstLondonvisitJanuary1791June1792"></a>First London visit, January 1791 &#150; June 1792</h2>Haydn arrived in London on 2 January 1791 and was soon introduced to members of the London musical world, including the music historian Charles Burney. Within a few days he had taken lodgings at 18 Great Pulteney Street, which remained his main London residence during his stay, although in spring 1791 he lived for a while in Lisson Grove. He made his first appearance at court on 18 January, at the ball for Queen Charlotte's birthday. The following day he performed for the prince of Wales (afterwards George IV) at Carlton House; he became a regular participant in the prince's private concerts, where he no doubt welcomed the opportunity to converse in German. The subscription series known as Mr Salomon's concert, after several postponements, began on 11 March in the concert room at Hanover Square; Haydn and his compositions were the principal attractions. Following Haydn's d&eacute;but the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> remarked &#145;It is not wonderful [not to be wondered at] that to souls capable of being touched by music, Haydn should be an object of homage, and even of idolatry; for like our own Shakespeare, he moves and governs the passions at his will&#146; (<span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, 12 March 1791; Robbins Landon, 3.49). The detailed coverage of musical matters in the London newspapers was novel to Haydn; it promoted the image of the composer as a celebrated artist and offered descriptive comment on his music that pointed to the nature of its appeal.<br>
<br>The outstanding product of Haydn's two visits to England were his twelve &#145;London&#146; symphonies (nos. 93&#150;104), a major chapter in the history of the genre, but, while in London, Haydn also composed quartets, piano trios, piano sonatas, English songs (canzonettas), and settings of Scottish folk-songs. He completed the commissioned opera, <span class="italic">L'anima del filosofo</span>, based on the Orpheus story, but it was never performed, as the manager of the King's Theatre, Sir John Gallini, was unable to renew the licence for opera performances there. The concert season ended in June, giving Haydn ample opportunity to recover and prepare for the following season, as well as to travel. In July 1791 he visited Oxford, where he gave a series of three concerts and on 8 July received the degree of DMus. In November he visited Cambridge, where he observed that &#145;The students bear themselves like those of Oxford, but it is said they have better teachers&#146;  (Robbins Landon, 3.112). This was one of many impressions of life in England that Haydn entered in the four notebooks he kept while living in the country: subjects ranged from the drinking habits of the British aristocracy to the price of oranges. November also saw Haydn invited to spend two days at Oatlands, the Surrey seat of Prince Frederick, duke of York, and his new wife, Princess Frederica of Prussia; the duchess became one of Haydn's principal British patrons. Following this visit the prince of Wales commissioned a strikingly robust portrait of the composer from John Hoppner. Haydn wrote to an acquaintance in Vienna that &#145;The Prince of Wales is the most handsome man on God's earth; he has an extraordinary love of music and a lot of feeling, but not much money&#146;  (Robbins Landon, 3.118). This na&iuml;ve remark about the prince's finances foreshadowed a pressing issue a few years later, when a fee of 100 guineas owed to Haydn featured in the business of the parliamentary commissioners charged with settling the enormous debts of the prince.<br>
<br>By late 1791 Haydn had become distant from Luigia Polzelli; despite the presence of her sister Theresa Negri on the London stage Haydn never sent for Polzelli to join him. In June he had met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76342/', "Rebecca Schroeter, n&#233;e Scott (bap. 1751, d. 1826)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76341/', "Schroeter, Johann Samuel")</script>], the wealthy widow of a German-born composer and pianist; their correspondence suggests that by the start of 1792 they were almost certainly having an affair. In addition to providing Haydn with a domestic life away from his lodgings, she acted as copyist for some of his London compositions. Meanwhile, the second series of concerts at Hanover Square began on 17 February 1792. The first concert saw the first performance of symphony no. 93. The review in <span class="italic">The Times</span> ran through a lexicon of attributes important in eighteenth-century aesthetics: &#145;Novelty of idea, agreeable caprice, and whim combined with all Haydn's sublime and wonten grandeur, gave additional consequence to the soul and feelings of every individual present&#146; (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 20 Feb 1792; Robbins Landon, 3.134).<br>
<br>During this season Haydn complained of overwork and in March he was bled. By April he had decided to return to Europe, although it was expected he would return for a third season in January 1793: it was even reported &#145;that he has declared his intention of concluding the finale of his days, with the &#147;Roast Beef of Old England&#148;&#146; (<span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span>, 12 April 1792; Robbins Landon, 3.153) and it is probable that Haydn did contemplate settling in London. Haydn left in June after visiting William Herschel at Slough, and after narrowly dissuading his friend John Hunter, the surgeon, from performing an operation to remove his prominent nasal polyp.<h2>
<a name="SecondLondonvisitFebruary1794August1795"></a>Second London visit, February 1794 &#150; August 1795</h2>Haydn spent eighteen months in Vienna from July 1792. His activities included teaching Ludwig van Beethoven, an experience less financially lucrative than taking private pupils had been in London, and spiritually rewarding for neither party. Haydn's compositions included twelve minuets and twelve dances for a charity ball. His decision not to return to join Salomon for the 1793 season was blamed on his nasal polyp but probably reflected a wish to recover from the pressures of performing in London and to concentrate on composition. In addition the onset of the Revolutionary War with France made travel dangerous. Haydn may also have feared a Jacobin rising in London; he was politically conservative, although his London acquaintances included the radical writer Thomas Holcroft.<br>
<br>Haydn eventually returned to London in February 1794 to fulfil his arrangement with Salomon, taking up residence at 1 Bury Street, St James's, near Rebecca Schroeter's house, and beginning a third season at Hanover Square. In addition to three new symphonies by Haydn, the season saw the publication of six canzonettas with words by Anne Hunter, widow of Haydn's friend the surgeon; six more followed in 1795. 1794 also saw Haydn gain the accolade of being the only living composer to have his work included in the concerts of the Society of Antient Music, alongside composers from the early part of the century such as Handel. Encountering the music of Handel, which at events such as the Handel commemoration concerts in Westminster Abbey would be performed by forces of several hundred, thrilled Haydn; he told an early biographer that &#145;He meditated on every note and drew from those most learned scores the essence of true musical grandeur&#146;  (Carpani, 167).<br>
<br>Haydn intended to see out a further season in London, but by summer 1794 it was apparent that he would then return to Austria; the new Prince Esterh&aacute;zy, Nicolaus (II), had decided to reassemble the family's musical household, with Haydn restored as kapellmeister. Meanwhile Haydn visited Portsmouth, the Isle of Wight, and Winchester in July, and Bristol and Bath in August, where he stayed with the castrato Venanzio Rauzzini. In late 1794 he was commissioned to write a patriotic ode by Willoughby Bertie, fourth earl of Abingdon, a leading music patron who was Gallini's brother-in-law. The work was not finished, perhaps because the text, by Marchamont Nedham, was of poor quality or because of Abingdon's disgrace following his conviction for libel in 1795.<br>
<br>Salomon abandoned his own concert series in 1795, because of the difficulty of securing new singers from war-torn Europe, and joined forces with the management of the King's Theatre to present a series termed the opera concert, given in the concert room that abutted the main stage. Haydn went with him and, though he nominally shared the role of resident composer with three others&#151;Francesco Bianchi, Muzio Clementi, and Vincente Martini&#151;he was the central attraction of the series. The orchestra, with about sixty players, was the largest Haydn had worked with. He presented his three final symphonies in London, as well as composing a variety of other work. Haydn maintained his connection with the royal family; he mediated a settlement between the leading musicians in the royal household over who should conduct the orchestra at the marriage of the prince of Wales, and performed several times for members of the royal family. He told Griesinger that George III and Queen Charlotte asked him to remain in Britain, and offered to give him summer accommodation in Windsor and arrange for his wife to be brought over from Austria; the devoted royal couple were presumably ignorant of the unhappy state of Haydn's marriage.<br>
<br>Haydn's final benefit concert took place on 4 May 1795, a fortnight before the end of the original scheme of subscription concerts. It included the first performance of what was to be his last symphony, no. 104, and elicited a valedictory, if rather gauche, comment on Haydn's legacy:<blockquote>for fifty years to come Musical Composers would be little better than imitators of Haydn, and would do little more than pour water on his leaves. We hope the prophecy may prove false; but probability seems to confirm the prediction.(<span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, 6 May 1795; Robbins Landon, 3.308)</blockquote>Haydn lived quietly for a few months, composing, and left London in the middle of August 1795.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoVienna"></a>Return to Vienna</h2>Plans for a third visit to London in 1796 were mooted, but Haydn, conscious of advancing age, chose to concentrate on the revival of musical life at the Esterh&aacute;zy court. Unlike his grandfather, Prince Nicolaus (II) liked to spend the entire winter season in Vienna, moving to Eisenstadt in the summer months. Apart from administrative duties, Haydn's responsibilities were largely focused on the annual celebrations in September of the name-day of Nicolaus's wife, Princess Marie Hermenegild Esterh&aacute;zy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> von Liechtenstein, for which five masses were specifically composed. Haydn's continuing employment and the substantial money he had accrued in London (over &pound;1500 according to one source) had enabled him to purchase and renovate a comfortable house in the Viennese suburb of Gumpendorf, much later to become Haydngasse 19, into which he and his wife moved in 1797. For the first time since the 1750s Haydn became a truly Viennese composer. His ready patriotism was demonstrated by the extraordinary success of &#145;Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser&#146;, a national anthem commissioned in autumn 1796 by the Habsburg court, to encourage pro-dynastic sympathies and a sense of Austrian patriotism in the face of revolutionary nationalism spreading from France to the German-speaking lands. It was directly inspired by &#145;God Save the King&#146;, and was first performed on 12 February 1797, at the birthday of Francis II, with words by Lorenz Haschka. With changes to its text, Haydn's composition remained the Austrian anthem until after the Second World War; as &#145;Deutschland, Deutschland &uuml;ber alles&#146; it became popular in nineteenth-century Germany before being formally adopted as the national anthem in 1922. As early as 1801 it was adapted in Britain as a hymn tune, later usually entitled &#145;Austria&#146;.<br>
<br>Haydn's most substantial works in the late 1790s were both inspired by his admiration for Handel's music. On his departure from London, Salomon had apparently given him a libretto, &#145;The Creation of the World&#146;, supposedly written for Handel. With the sponsorship of a group of noblemen, the Gesellschaft der Associierten, led by Baron Gottfried van Swieten, this led to the composition of Haydn's oratorio <span class="italic">The Creation</span>, first performed in March 1798. Haydn published it himself, by subscription, in both English and German versions&#151;it has been claimed as the first bilingual composition&#151;promoting its arrival with the help of London friends including Burney. The Gesellschaft also sponsored a further oratorio, <span class="italic">The Seasons</span>, with a libretto based on the cycle of poems by James Thomson, which premiered in April 1801. The first performances of both were private, but later ones were associated with charitable causes, and promoted the composer as a public figure of esteem.<br>
<br>Despite the travails of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, Haydn maintained his profile as Europe's leading composer, mainly through contact with publishers in Paris, London, and Leipzig. To the doctorate from Oxford University were added membership of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music (1799), and medals from the Paris Conservatoire (1805) and the Philharmonic Society in St Petersburg (1808). In 1803 he received a medal of honour from the city of Vienna for his services to charity. Haydn's response to the last-mentioned was typical in its directness and humility: &#145;vox Populi, vox Dei&#146;. He was made an honorary citizen of Vienna in 1804.<br>
<br>Haydn's last major composition was completed in 1802, the <span class="italic">Harmoniemesse</span>, though he continued to forward some settings of national folk-songs to the publisher George Thomson in Edinburgh for a further two years. Although virtually housebound from 1806 Haydn's last years were comfortable ones, sustained by regular visitors and an inner contentment. He became noticeably weaker in the early months of 1809 and died peacefully in his sleep at his home in Gumpendorf, Vienna, on 31 May 1809. The official cause of death was given as &#145;debilitation&#146;. He was buried in the cemetery in Gumpendorf on 1 June. Most of his remains were transferred to the crypt in the Bergkirche in Eisenstadt in 1820; Haydn's head, however, was missing, having been stolen from the grave in Gumpendorf to aid the work of the Viennese phrenologist, Franz Joseph Gall. Only in 1954 was it finally reunited with the rest of his remains.<h2>
<a name="Posthumousreputation"></a>Posthumous reputation</h2>In the nineteenth century, in Britain as in Europe generally, Haydn's reputation was soon eclipsed by that of Beethoven, and his historical significance was that of a necessary precursor, an attitude that was aggravated by a romantic sensibility that interpreted his life-long position as kapellmeister as a lack of ambition and creative individuality. Haydn had been affectionately called Papa Haydn by many of his acquaintances; for much of posterity evoking this sobriquet was a convenient way of belittling his musical mastery. Johannes Brahms was a rare admirer, and his musical thought processes owe a great deal to Haydn. Although the composer became known as the &#145;father of the symphony&#146; and the &#145;father of the quartet&#146; full understanding of his <i>&#339;uvre</i> was not possible until the last decades of the twentieth century, when most of his music finally became available in modern editions.<br>
<br>Scholars have long established that this alleged father did not invent the symphony or the quartet but he was certainly the first composer to appreciate their potential and it is undoubtedly true that Beethoven's achievement would not have been possible without Haydn's example. In his quartets and symphonies, as well as other instrumental works such as piano sonatas and the piano trios, Haydn projected an unequalled mastery of the language of music, to the extent that his music often seems to be about the very power of the language itself. Opinions on his status as a composer of vocal music remain mixed. His operas have never figured in the standard repertory, and while his Catholic church music has always been a mainstay of liturgical services in his native Austria, elsewhere his masses in particular are most usually encountered as concert works. His two late oratorios, <span class="italic">The Creation</span> and <span class="italic">The Seasons</span>, especially the former, have enjoyed continuous popular acclaim from the end of the eighteenth century to the present day, though often blighted by patronizing sentiment rather than a recognition of the remarkable certainty and beauty of Haydn's vision.<br>
<br>Although Haydn spent only a small part of his long life in Britain, his role in its musical life was a dominant one from about 1780 until the 1820s. For many commentators he was the modern equivalent of Handel, a German composer whose greatness was nurtured by the rich and progressive musical life of Georgian Britain. For that reason the provocative view that London was as important as Vienna in developing Haydn's artistry has much to commend it.<br>
