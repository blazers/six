<span class="headword">Cautherley,  Samuel</span>  (<em>c.</em>1747&#150;1805), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was rumoured to be a love child of the great actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10408/', "David Garrick")</script>. Malicious gossip claimed Peg Woffington as his mother. A more plausible candidate is <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13358/', "Jane Hippisley (1719&#150;1791)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13359/', "Hippisley, John (1696&#150;1748)")</script>], who had played Ophelia to Garrick's Hamlet at Goodman's Fields and who, in 1747&#150;8, adopted the married name of Mrs Green without known recourse to a husband. The 1775 edition of <span class="italic">Theatrical Biography</span>, which published the rumour of this productive liaison between Garrick and Hippisley, is not, however, reliable, and Cautherley's parentage remains a mystery. What is clear is that, after his marriage in 1749, Garrick assumed the responsibilities of a guardian towards the boy.<br>
<br>Cautherley made his first appearance at Drury Lane on 28 April 1755, when Garrick's farce <span class="italic">Miss in her Teens</span> was given a novelty airing with a cast of children, but his serious d&eacute;but came on 23 October 1755, when he played the boy Duke of York to Garrick's Richard III. The fact that he made a handful of appearances in 1756 and 1757 suggests that Garrick considered him less than outstanding. We know from surviving letters that Cautherley was sent to board at a school in Bromley in 1759, and that Garrick had cause for concern about his charge's slow academic progress. The educational experiment was short-lived, and on 9 October 1760 Cautherley was billed as Prince Edward to Thomas Sheridan's Richard III at Drury Lane, where he made sporadic appearances during the next three seasons. From June 1763 to November 1764, at Garrick's expense, he was in Paris, probably with a tutor in attendance, but on 26 September 1765 he made his adult d&eacute;but at Drury Lane as George Barnwell in George Lillo's <span class="italic">The London Merchant</span>. The small theatrical success that Cautherley had over the next ten years at Drury Lane was owed to Garrick's indulgence. He was given his chance as Hamlet on 23 September 1766 and as Romeo seven days later, and failed to seize it. He was handsome, unintelligent, and vain enough to resent Garrick's wise decision to cast him in no more leading tragic roles.<br>
<br>On 4 July 1771, from Garrick's home in Hampton, Cautherley married Susanna Blanchard, the daughter of George III's wealthy cardmaker. Buoyed up by the new independence his wife had brought him, he began to pester Garrick for better parts. Eventually the exasperated actor&#150;manager wrote a stinging letter, dated 7 October 1773, attacking Cautherley for his unjustified self-importance and desiring him to &#145;do your business or to leave it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2.902). Frightened into apology, Cautherley contained his bitterness for two years, but on 27 September 1775, the day after what proved to be his last appearance at Drury Lane, he sent Garrick a letter of resignation. Garrick's third-person response, dated 2 October 1775, ends chillingly: &#145;Mr Garrick said in a former letter, that Mr Cautherly [<i>sic</i>] could confer no favour upon him, which he now retracts; for he confesses, Mr Cautherly has found a Way to confer a very great one&#146;  (ibid., 3.1037).<br>
<br>The remaining ten years of Cautherley's undistinguished theatrical career were spent in provincial playhouses; he is known to have acted in Bristol, Hull, Dublin, Edinburgh, and York. There is no record of his response to Garrick's death in 1779, but in 1800 he wrote to Garrick's widow: &#145;The Gratitude I shall ever feel for the many kindnesses confer'd on me, while under your Hospitable Roof (for almost Twenty years) can never be effaced&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.305). Cautherley died at his home in Richmond, Surrey, on 15 November 1805. The affluence he owed to his wife now reverted to her as his widow. When she died, on 22 March 1820, her will listed South Sea annuities, Bank of England stock, various securities, and several properties. She was survived by three of their children. Two others had died in infancy.<br>
