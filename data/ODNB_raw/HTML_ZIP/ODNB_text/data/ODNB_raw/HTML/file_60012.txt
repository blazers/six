<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bolan,  Marc</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Mark Feld]</span>  (1947&#150;1977), <span class="occ">musician and poet</span>, was born on 30 September 1947 in Hackney, London, the second child of Simeon Feld, cosmetics salesman (1920&#150;1991), and his wife, Phyllis Winifred, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Atkins (1927&#150;1991). The energy of 1950s rock'n'roll captivated the young Mark Feld, prompting him to take up the guitar. He left school at fourteen, worked as a model, and wrote reams of prose and poetry in his characteristic dyslexic hand. He released several solo records in the mid-1960s, changed his name to Marc Bolan, and joined the group John's Children for a short spell. Their hit single &#145;Desdemona&#146; (1967) was banned by the BBC for what were regarded at the time as risqu&eacute; lyrics. When the band broke up shortly afterwards, Bolan found himself adrift in London with no musical equipment.<br>
<br>During the &#145;summer of love&#146; of 1967 Bolan formed an acoustic duo, called Tyrannosaurus Rex, with <a name="cosubject_60012"></a><span class="headword">Steve <span class="st"> [Peregrine]</span> Took</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Stephen Ross Porter]</span>  (1949&#150;1980)<span class="occ"></span> on bongoes, percussion, and backing vocals. Took was born in Eltham, London, on 28 July 1949, the son of Leonard Henry Porter, bakery manager, and Betty George. They recorded three albums, <span class="italic">My People were Fair and had Sky in their Hair</span> (1968), <span class="italic">Prophets, Seers, and Sages</span> (1968), and <span class="italic">Unicorn</span> (1969), all produced by Tony Visconti. With the help of the disc jockey John Peel, Tyrannosaurus Rex became a successful &#145;underground&#146; act. Bolan's other vital support was his wife, June Ellen Child (1943/4&#150;1995), a record company receptionist, whom he married on 30 January 1970. She provided vital organization and a stable domestic life where the creativity of the less firmly grounded Bolan could flourish.<br>
<br>The acoustic, whimsical songs of Tyrannosaurus Rex (T. Rex) contrasted with much of 1968's high-volume rock-blues and revolutionary stances; at their best, these albums have a childlike innocence. Sung with an inimitable vibrato and steeped in a Tolkienesque mythology, Bolan's songs evoked a gentler pastoral world of wizards, queens, fauns, and unicorns. This mythology also shaped <span class="italic">The Warlock of Love</span> (1969), a best-selling collection of poetry, and other writings published posthumously. Bolan's verse shows a lack of literary awareness, yet demonstrates an instinctive sensitivity to rhyme and rhythm, and the romanticized imagery which made his song lyrics original.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">A Beard of Stars</span> (1969) saw Mickey Finn (1947&#150;2003) replace the increasingly unreliable Steve Took, who went on to join the Pink Fairies and Shagrat. Took died, after choking on a cherry stone, on 27 October 1980. Much of his music was unreleased at his death, but has since gained a cult following. On <span class="italic">A Beard of Stars</span> Bolan introduced electric guitars into the music and, like Bob Dylan before him, faced cries of &#145;sell-out&#146; from part of his audience. Dreaming of mainstream success, Bolan spent the summer of 1970 listening to old rock'n'roll records and recorded <span class="italic">T. Rex</span> (1970), an evocative and distinctly English-sounding record that struck an excellent balance between the acoustic and electric elements.<br>
<br>These sessions produced his first hit, &#145;Ride a white swan&#146;, which spent five months in the UK top forty, and reached number two. In March 1971 the follow-up &#145;Hot love&#146; went to number one for six weeks. Steve Currie (bass) and Bill Legend (drums) were hired to make T. Rex a functioning rock quartet. Once glimpsed on television, Bolan's androgynous beauty, wild corkscrew hair, lurex jackets, and glitter make-up seized the imagination of a generation of post-1960s teenagers looking for a figurehead. Along with David Bowie, Bolan was the epitome of the &#145;glam rock&#146; phenomenon. A third single, &#145;Get it on&#146;, went to number one for four weeks. T. Rex embarked on an autumn UK tour to promote <span class="italic">Electric Warrior</span>, one of the best-selling albums of 1971. &#145;Jeepster&#146;, released as a single against Bolan's wishes, went to number two, his fourth hit of the year. The music press heralded a new &#145;Beatlemania&#146;. Bolan had taken elements of 1950s rock'n'roll but filtered them through a 1960s post-Dylan, post-Hendrix sensibility. It was as though Chuck Berry had collided with <span class="italic">Lord of the Rings</span>. Sexy, commercial, yet imaginative, T. Rex seemed a breath of fresh air in the otherwise over-serious &#145;progressive&#146; music scene. As a guitarist and song-writer, Bolan was self-taught and had a limited technique and no knowledge of theory. But T. Rex records of 1970&#150;72 are full of simple but elegant lead guitar, and fine rhythm guitar playing.<br>
<br>Now a teenage idol, Bolan signed with EMI, set up his own label&#151;the T. Rex Wax Company&#151;and had four more hits in 1972: &#145;Telegram Sam&#146;, &#145;Metal guru&#146; (both number ones), &#145;Children of the revolution&#146;, and &#145;Solid gold easy action&#146;. <span class="italic">The Slider</span> was a patchy but strong album overall, and Bolan's biggest ever UK gigs came with two shows in March at the Wembley Empire Pool (later Wembley Arena). These were filmed by Ringo Starr and given a cinema release as <span class="italic">Born to Boogie</span>.<br>
<br>By the end of 1972 Bolan had passed his commercial and artistic peak. The music became formulaic, and stardom brought the usual problems of ego-inflation and drug abuse. Much to his frustration, America stubbornly refused to find any virtue in T. Rex, with only &#145;Get it on&#146; managing to be a moderate hit, while in the UK he was eclipsed by Slade, David Bowie, and Roxy Music. By 1973 Bolan had parted from his wife June (though apparently they never divorced), and became estranged from supporters such as John Peel and his fellow disc jockey Bob Harris. Later T. Rex albums such as <span class="italic">Tanx</span> (1973) are not without some good songs, but pretentious arrangements often overwhelm simple ideas. In 1976 Bolan regained some credibility by re-positioning himself as the &#145;godfather of punk&#146; and showcasing new bands on a Granada television series entitled <span class="italic">Marc</span>.<br>
<br>On 16 September 1977, just before his thirtieth birthday, Bolan was killed when the Mini driven by his girlfriend, the singer Gloria Jones (<i>b</i>. 1947), crashed into a tree on Barnes Common, west London. Despite filling his songs with references to cars, Bolan never learned to drive, believing that like Eddie Cochran he would die in one. Bolan was survived by Rolan (<i>b</i>. 1975), the son he had with Jones. He was cremated on 20 September at Golders Green, London.<br>
<br>Along with David Bowie, Marc Bolan is remembered as the leading light of early 1970s popular music in the UK, revitalizing the singles charts with records that paid homage to and successfully updated 1950s rock'n'roll.<br>
