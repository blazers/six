<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hay,  William Thomson <span class="st"> [Will]</span></span>  (1888&#150;1949), <span class="occ">comedian and actor</span>, was born on 6 December 1888 in Stockton-on-Tees, the second of the three sons and third of the six children of William Robert Hay (<i>d</i>. 1919), engineer, of Inverness-shire, and his wife, Elizabeth Ebden (<i>d</i>. 1910), the daughter of a Barnsley fish merchant. He was educated at local authority schools in Lowestoft, Hemel Hempstead, and London, and in evening classes in Manchester. While working as a commercial correspondent in Manchester he married, on 7 October 1907, Gladys, the eighteen-year-old daughter of Thomas Perkins, postmaster of Broughton, Salford. They had three children: Will junior and Gladys (both of whom went on the stage), and Joan. The marriage broke down in 1934, but the couple never divorced; Hay subsequently formed a relationship with Randi Kopstadt, a Norwegian showgirl.<br>
<br>Soon after his marriage Will Hay embarked on a music-hall and concert-party career (he tried several times to enlist for active service in the First World War but was rejected on medical grounds; he served instead with the voluntary training corps, a forerunner of the Home Guard). His initial sketch, &#145;Bend Down&#146;, was based on the anecdotes of his schoolteacher sister, Elspeth. After obtaining valuable experience with the Fred Karno troupes during the war he concentrated on developing his character of the Schoolmaster Comedian. From about 1920 he performed his main sketch, &#145;The Fourth Form at St Michael's&#146;, which soon became something of a national institution and was featured in the royal command variety performance of 1925 (he also appeared at the royal command shows in 1928, 1938, and 1945). After years of apprenticeship, Hay's triumph came suddenly and comprehensively. His first overseas tours, to Australia and New Zealand in 1923&#150;4 and to the USA (where British comedians usually failed) in 1927, were successes, and by the early 1930s &#145;The Fourth Form at St Michael's&#146; was featured on radio, on record, and in the children's comic <span class="italic">Radio Fun</span>.<br>
<br>Cautious with money, and often intimidatingly caustic as a theatrical overseer, Hay was more respected than loved by his fellow professionals. His private life was conservative, austere&#151;even niggardly&#151;with little of showbiz glitter about it. He was largely self-educated, with a particular interest in astronomy. He was a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society; he built his own observatory, and in 1933 discovered a white spot on the surface of Saturn. He published <span class="italic">Through my Telescope</span> in 1935. Having entertained the troops in the First World War with Fred Karno, he was more likely to have been found in the Second World War offering them lectures on astronomy.<br>
<br>Such private endeavours were far removed from the seedy, blustering, and ineffectual teacher of Hay's stage creation, and the potency of his prototype was so vivid that for decades his name remained a byword for hapless teaching. With a small company of three or four &#145;boys&#146;, he topped variety bills across the country for many years. The verbal character of much of his comedy promoted its transfer to radio; he became a noted broadcaster, among whose other characters was the failing academic Dr Muffin.<br>
<br>Hay transferred his mastery of comic timing and expression to film more successfully than many other British comedians. Most famously in concert with Graham &#145;Albert&#146; Moffatt (1919&#150;1965) as the impertinent fat boy, and Moore &#145;Harbottle&#146; Marriott (1885&#150;1949) as the resilient ancient, he made some seventeen films between 1934 and 1944, many of them directed by Marcel Varnel. Nine were made by Gainsborough Pictures. Hay was adept at ringing the changes on his characterization of grudging, evasive, and inadequate authority, playing, <i>inter alia</i>, a prison governor, a fire chief, a civil servant, a sea captain, a disbarred solicitor, and a police sergeant, as well as a schoolmaster. <span class="italic">Oh, Mr Porter!</span> (1937), with Hay as the troubled stationmaster of Buggleskelly, is regarded as both the popular and critical pick of the genre, and, together with <span class="italic">Good Morning, Boys</span> (1937), <span class="italic">Ask a Policeman</span> (1939), <span class="italic">The Ghost of St Michael's</span> (1941), and <span class="italic">My Learned Friend</span> (1944), this, his best work, has been favourably compared with the screen antics of the Marx brothers.<br>
<br>Hay played his pathetic, seedy characters with a firm sense of their background and personal histories. This made for three-dimensional portrayals, which, temporizing between guile and befuddlement, led his audiences to feel sympathy as well as disdain. The tilted mortarboard, the crumpled gown, the wispy hair, the devious countenance, the slightly husky voice, the deprecating cough, the disapproving sniff, and above all the pinched eyeglasses which provided a focus for a wide range of facial reactions, from foxiness via smugness and irascibility to dismay, were the physical keynotes of his performance. Like the American comedian Jack Benny he was the master of the slow and silent double take, a skill which was to stand him in glorious stead on film. His fictitious school, Narkover, was adopted from Beachcomber's log of its adventures in the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>. It is an interesting cultural reflection that vast audiences, most of whom had no experience of minor private boarding-schools, comprehended every last nuance of Hay's presentation, a tribute to the lengthy popular appeal of the Billy Bunter school of popular literature. Will Hay suffered a stroke in 1946 from which he only partially recovered; another stroke led within hours to his death in the early hours of Easter Monday, 18 April 1949, at his London flat, 16 Chelsea Embankment. He was buried in the garden of remembrance, Streatham.<br>
