<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Heath,  Ambrose</span>  (1891&#150;1969), <span class="occ">writer on cookery and journalist</span>, was born Francis Geoffrey Miller (the second forename was later changed to Gerald) on 7 February 1891 at 16 Broadhurst Gardens, Hampstead, London, the son of Francis Miller (1866&#150;1935), electrical engineer, and his wife, Rose Margaret Bockett. Possibly because his parents thought journalism an unrespectable career, he became known as Ambrose Heath professionally. The decision not to use his real name was taken, he told an interviewer in 1966, because his father was a gentleman. It is hard to believe that he changed his name (and he seems to have used the name Ambrose Heath in most of his dealings; it was not a mere <i>nom de plume</i>) because his parents disapproved of the subject of his writing; but he went on to say that &#145;my parents were supremely uninterested in food&#146;  (Bateman, 167).<br>
<br>Heath enjoyed his schooldays at Clifton College (1905&#150;9), &#145;though I was what you might call&#151;unorthodox &hellip; They didn't know what to do with me. I didn't like the formality of ordinary education. I was interested in special things&#146;  (Bateman, 167). He spent a lot of time in the company of the masters, but failed the scholarship examination for Christ Church, Oxford. When his father's connections failed to secure him a place in publishing, he escaped to Newlyn, Cornwall, where his father made him an annual allowance of &pound;150 for four years, and he wrote a novel and a children's book, both of which he destroyed. For a time he worked for the Hudson's Bay Company, then in the India Office. He spoke fondly of frequenting Marcel Boulestin's restaurant in the 1920s and 1930s, and in 1933 was a co-founder of the Wine and Food Society, but he had a quarrel with the then secretary and resigned. His journalism began with the &#145;casual pieces&#146; he submitted to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>, the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, and the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>; and he finally became cookery correspondent for the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>.<br>
<br>Heath was prodigiously productive; he wrote his first four cookery books in 1933, and had added another eleven by the time the Second World War started, including <span class="italic">Madame Prunier's Fish Cookery Book</span> (1938), a translation, for which he was best-known. During the war he drew the &#145;Patsy cookstrip&#146; for the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, and should be given the credit for inventing the genre. He also drew the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror's</span> Saturday gardening strip, &#145;Digwell&#146;, which was still appearing in the late 1960s, though most of the staff of the newspaper did not know the identity of the artist.<br>
<br>Heath wrote more than 100 cookery books. Many of them contained the word &#145;good&#146; in their titles: &#145;good food&#146; obviously, but also &#145;good&#146; potato dishes, savouries, soups, sweets, and ices, to name but a few. They provided directions for cooking almost every conceivable foodstuff, from squirrels&#151;&#145;the recipe does not sound very convincing to me&#146;  (Bateman, 201)&#151;to turtle. About the latter he wrote that &#145;it is not likely that private houses or indeed many establishments will ever want, or be in a position to make turtle soup, but, for the curious, here are details of the way to make it,&#146; starting with a hair-raising passage detailing &#145;the slaughtering of the turtle&#146;  (ibid., 202). He was a very thorough researcher: in a piece he called &#145;Country dishes&#146;, written during the Second World War, he catalogues the eating properties of various birds &#145;of edible size&#146;, common and uncommon, beginning with &#145;coot: as inedible, I understand, as it appears to be&#146;, and ending with a recipe for sparrows  (ibid., 200). His other wartime recipes, in such books as <span class="italic">The Good Cook in Wartime</span> and <span class="italic">From the Kitchen Front</span>, were more homely, however. His writing was graceful, with an old-fashioned turn of phrase, but with an occasional shaft of self-mockery or irony that makes it enjoyable to read.<br>
<br>Heath was not a very good businessman, and in the 1960s was earning only &pound;1000 a year, surprising for an author with so many titles to his credit. He said that he had sold the copyright in his books for &pound;50 each, with no royalties. Near the end of his life he seemed a little bitter about his poor pay, aware that other cookery writers were getting much larger payments for their books and journalism. He was sacked from <span class="italic">Queen</span> magazine when he was already elderly, which meant a loss of &pound;900 a year. Aware that copyright in recipes is a difficult matter, he complained that people stole his recipes, but admitted, &#145;I steal from Escoffier&#146;  (Bateman, 173). He had some ambivalence about his subject, and said with reference to a wartime recipe for cod's head soup: &#145;What I write is dull, very dull. But I don't write dully&#146;  (ibid., 170).<br>
<br>Heath's later years were spent at Grange Cottage, Holmbury St Mary, an idyllic house near Dorking&#151;&#145;It's like Walt Disney, isn't it?&#146;  (Bateman 170)&#151;with an Aga cooker, and a flower garden but no vegetable garden. He made his own elderberry and other fruit wines. His much younger wife, Violet May, who survived him, called him Loo, and he called her Pooh. They had a daughter, Susan. Heath died at his final home, Pratsham Grange Cottage, Wotton, Surrey, on 31 May 1969.<br>
