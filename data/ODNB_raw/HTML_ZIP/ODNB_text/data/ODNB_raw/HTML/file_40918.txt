</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Moores, Sir  John</span>  (1896&#150;1993), <span class="occ">businessman and philanthropist</span>, was born on 25 January 1896 at the Church Inn, Eccles, Lancashire, the first son and second among the eight children of John William Moores (1871&#150;1919) and his wife, Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fethney (1873&#150;1959), a millworker. On the birth certificate his father's occupation is registered as &#145;licensed victualler&#146;, but John William had been trained as a bricklayer, and before long he was back in the building trade again. He was a hard worker, but his health was poor and he had started to drink too much. The family had difficulty making ends meet. Young John Moores's ambition was born: he wanted to look after his mother and to make the family fortune.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>Louisa, a highly intelligent woman, had recognized her son's potential early. He left his higher elementary school at thirteen to become a Post Office messenger boy, but the front room at home, otherwise sacrosanct, was opened up for him every evening so that he could work there in peace: he was doing a correspondence course for the civil service. He also went to night school to learn telegraphy, which finally led to a job as trainee telegraphist with the Commercial Cable Company. In 1916 he volunteered for the navy and was posted to a shore station in Aberdeen as a telegraphist. He was demobilized in 1919. His father had died earlier that same year, and John was now head of the family.<br>
<br>Moores returned to the Commercial Cable Company again, first in Liverpool, then to a posting in Ireland. The Waterville cable station was an isolated base in co. Kerry, where the cable came out of the Atlantic. There was a nine-hole golf course nearby, but no library or sports shop for miles, and very soon Moores had embarked on his first business venture. In his spare time he formed the Waterville Supply Company, to import bulk-purchased books; before long it also became Dunlop's &#145;sole agent in Waterville for the supply of golf requisites&#146;. John had discovered that there was a good profit to be made on golf balls, and he wanted some to practise with himself; sport of all kinds always interested him. Eighteen months later he was moved back to Liverpool.<h2>
<a name="LittlewoodsPools"></a>Littlewoods Pools</h2>Now Moores had another plan. He had heard of a football pool being run by a man in Birmingham, and he persuaded two friends to join him in starting a football pool of their own. They risked the sack if found out, as the Commercial Cable Company's rules did not permit outside employment: they used the name Littlewood (the birth name of one of the trio) to disguise their identities from their employer.<br>
<br>A few months earlier Moores had married: major steps in his career often coincided with important happenings in his private life. Ruby Knowles (1894&#150;1965), a waitress, was the daughter of the family where he was in digs. Her father, William Albert Knowles, was a clerk in a shipping firm, but the family came of fairly prosperous farming stock and had once owned a sizeable acreage near Chester. Ruby's qualities were warmth and kindliness and, even more importantly, strength of character. It would be needed in the risky times that lay ahead. The couple were married on 19 September 1923.<br>
<br>Littlewoods Pools&#151;a system of betting on the outcome of football matches&#151;was to be run on the French <i>pari-mutuel</i> system, in which 10 per cent of the total stake is subtracted for management costs. The three young men had to lay out their own money to rent an office, engage a typist, and pay for the coupons to be printed. Of those first 4000 coupons distributed in 1924, only thirty-five were returned. They had 10,000 coupons printed for a big match in Hull. Only one came back. By Christmas each of them had put &pound;200 of his own money into the kitty, and the two friends had had enough. John had not, and Ruby backed him, saying: &#145;I'd sooner be the wife of a man who has gone broke than a man who is haunted by regret&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). He took on overtime for the Commercial Cable Company, working on Sundays; he also paid back each former partner his &pound;200, stopped renting the office, dismissed the typist, and called on the family. From now on coupons were marked by his brothers and sisters, who came over to his house every weekend, while Ruby cooked meals for them. She was still doing this the following season, as well as looking after a small baby; their first child, a daughter, had been born at the beginning of June. And the enterprise was still losing money. John decided to drop the <i>pari-mutuel</i> system. Instead he deducted expenses, plus a commission, before paying out, and the business began to take off. He rented an office again, took on staff, and devised a security system to prevent cheating. In 1928&#151;the year in which his second child, a son, was born&#151;he acquired his own printing firm to produce the pools coupons. By the 1990s it had diversified and become one of the largest printers in the north of England.<br>
<br>The world slump from 1929 to 1934 caused mass unemployment everywhere, but Littlewoods continued to engage more staff and acquire more buildings. And as their incomes increased the family began to enjoy life: they took up golf, shooting, and fishing, and started to travel abroad. The seeds of Moores's two lifelong interests, languages and painting, were sown now, although he did not have time to indulge them fully for many years. What he did do was to make sure that his workforce, in many ways his extended family, was also benefiting. Canteens were installed, with good food at subsidized prices; there was a medical welfare department, a contributory pension scheme, a social club for activities such as ballroom dancing and snooker matches, and a staff sports ground.<br>
<br>Moores was now a millionaire, at thirty-six. But he had to prove to himself that his success had not just been a matter of luck: he would start a new and entirely different business, from scratch. And on 23 January 1932, three months before the birth of his second son, Littlewoods Mail Order Stores was incorporated.<h2>
<a name="Themailorderbusiness"></a>The mail-order business</h2>The idea may have come from the little mail-order firm Moores had started years earlier in Ireland, and he knew that the enormous mailing list which pools had built up would be very helpful; but it was also inspired by the hardship and poverty prevalent everywhere in the bleak depression years at the beginning of the 1930s. And he could remember only too well the difficulties with which his mother had to cope when feeding, clothing, and bringing up a large family on a small income. There had for some time been institutions in existence, such as the Co-operative Society, and the tallyman of the north, which enabled the poorer members of society to buy things they needed. Moores's originality lay in applying a mix of these schemes to a large-scale business enterprise.<br>
<br>As usual all the family were involved. They researched and planned catalogues and helped to choose the merchandise, and Moores visited the United States to get information from big American mail-order firms such as Sears Roebuck. At the end of the first year the turnover was &pound;100,000. A year later, in 1934, it had risen to &pound;400,000; and by early 1936 mail order was grossing &pound;4 million a year. Moores had made his second million.<br>
<br>It was not enough to satisfy him. Moores wanted to do more for Liverpool, the city to which he had given his abiding loyalty. For seven years, from 1933 to 1940, he served as a Conservative city councillor. He also stood twice for parliament, on each occasion fighting a safe Labour seat, and so failing to get in. But he still had another major business success ahead, the Littlewoods chain stores.<br>
<br>Moores's timing was impeccable: the economy had begun to pick up in the second half of the 1930s, and the firm already had buying experience and supplier contacts. On 4 July 1937 his fourth and last child, a daughter, was born. And on 6 July the first store was opened in Blackpool. Three years later, in 1939, there were twenty-five stores in operation, and further sites had been acquired. Then war was declared.<h2>
<a name="Thewaryearsandausterity"></a>The war years and austerity</h2>Moores had seen it coming. After the Munich conference in September he had already started to consider air-raid precautions, and had organized an ambulance division at his own expense. Less than forty-eight hours after the outbreak of war the new pools building, complete with all office equipment, was handed over to the government censorship department, and a great many of the Littlewoods vehicles were donated for use as ambulances. But Moores wanted the whole organization converted to war work.<br>
<br>The first contract was for parachutes. A Littlewoods warehouse was transformed into a factory; groups of pools girls were instructed by experts in the techniques of cutting, sewing, rigging, and assembly. The first parachute was produced on 11 December 1939, only a month after work had started on the building conversion. One month after that the first 20,000 parachutes were delivered to the Air Ministry.<br>
<br>It seems extraordinary that a paperwork-based firm such as Littlewoods could switch to mass production, often of a very technical nature, in the way that it did. But the records show that its sixteen factory conversions, employing 14,000 workers, produced among other things 12 million shells, 5 million parachutes, 50,000 dinghies, 20,000 barrage balloons, and more than 40,000 pontoons and storm boats. It could be put down to Moores's leadership, to the research he had done into time study on his visits to the United States, to his organizing ability. But his own explanation was simpler: &#145;The ordinary man or woman can do anything if they want to badly enough&#146;  (private information). He always regarded himself as an ordinary man.<br>
<br>When victory was finally won it brought little respite on the work front. Moores's businesses had to adapt to a new and changing world. The pools building which had been handed over in 1939 was not returned for nearly ten years. There was an acute paper shortage, so pools coupons could not be produced. The mail-order business had difficulty finding enough manufacturers, let alone enough paper for catalogues. The stores took the longest to recover. Building restrictions were not relaxed until October 1945, and not lifted completely for a further nine years. All the sites which had been acquired before the war lay undeveloped, and some were even compulsorily purchased by the government, having been first valued as &#145;derelict&#146; land.<br>
<br>In spite of the difficulties, by buying up old properties and shops Moores had managed to get six new stores going by the end of 1947. But the non-stop work involved took its toll. He was fifty, and was driving himself hard. There was panic throughout the organization when, at the beginning of that year, he became seriously ill with meningitis.<br>
<br>Moores had recovered in time for his eldest daughter's wedding in April, but the specialists were far from satisfied with his condition and prescribed a good rest and some sunshine. Moores and his wife went to Bermuda. During the holiday he came across an enormous disused hotel on the island's best ocean beach, and before long he had decided to buy it himself and build it up into a profitable concern. (As a follow-on, Littlewoods also became involved in the hotel business for a time, acquiring two in Harrogate and a loch and fishing lodge in Scotland. The family had to pay to take holidays there, but groups of long-serving employees who needed a break were sent free of charge.) Moores's initial action had not been entirely due to business acumen; he had an ulterior motive. Should anything happen to him, the Bermuda hotel could be sold and the proceeds used to pay off his death duties on Littlewoods. His concern was to keep the business intact for his descendants, and his recent illness had made him only too aware of his own mortality. A great many of his shares were put in trust for his offspring at this point.<br>
<br>The 1950s saw a resurgence in all three core businesses. New catalogue titles were created in mail order; more stores were opened (there were now more than sixty in the chain). Moores had produced a formula which could withstand almost any economic conditions: the cash flow from the pools was continuous; in good times the stores thrived; if there was a recession, then mail order got the benefit. Two of the divisions were always able to support the third when necessary.<h2>
<a name="Philanthropicwork"></a>Philanthropic work</h2>Moores's charitable works increased at an equal rate. In 1956 he became chairman of the Liverpool Motorists' Outing for Handicapped Children. In 1957 the John Moores Liverpool Art Exhibition was founded, a biennial competition with a top prize of &pound;20,000. Moores had taken up painting himself, and wanted to do what he could to assist young and aspiring artists. Those the competition helped to launch included David Hockney, Peter Blake, and R. B. Kitaj.<br>
<br>After his mother's death from cancer in 1959, the pace of Moores's activities grew even more hectic. In 1960 he became chairman of Everton Football Club, attending nearly every match: he even left for one in the middle of his younger daughter's wedding reception. In 1963 he funded a school of business management studies at Liverpool University. He became involved in the funding and building of boys' clubs and youth clubs. And his charities went on growing.<br>
<br>What few people knew, even within the family, was that Ruby, like John's mother, had suffered from cancer herself. She had had a mastectomy two years before Louisa's death, going into hospital under an assumed name, and timing it carefully so that two weeks later she could attend a family party without anyone realizing. She never liked a fuss. Now the cancer was recurring. Moores resigned his chairmanship of Everton to be with her as much as possible, but she died in 1965, seven weeks before her seventy-first birthday. At first Moores seemed almost stunned; they had been married for nearly forty-two years. Then he forced himself back to work again.<br>
<br>A few weeks later Moores had a bad fall. His hip gave him considerable pain for the next year or two, which restricted his fishing and shooting activities. But nothing could make him restrict his workload. In 1966 he had an IBM computer installed. In 1967 Littlewoods took over Sherman's Pools. New stores were being built and bought every year: there were eighty-four by the end of the 1960s, and three years later the number had grown to more than 100. Then Moores decided on a hip replacement operation. Artificial hip joints were still a recent development, but the operation was a great success. He was not allowed to ski again, or to water ski (a sport which he had taken up at the age of sixty-nine), but otherwise he was back to normal.<h2>
<a name="Lateryears"></a>Later years</h2>In 1970 Moores was made a freeman of the city of Liverpool, the honour, probably, which gave him the greatest pleasure of all. A year later he was appointed CBE. In 1980 he received a knighthood and chose as the motto for his coat of arms &#145;Opportunity made, not found&#146;.<br>
<br>On doctor's orders Moores was beginning to take more holidays. He was enjoying his great hobby, painting. But, even after resigning the chairmanship and handing over to his younger son in 1977, he still went in to his office every day and continued his flying visits to stores all over the country. Three years later he was back at the helm: handing over was something he always found difficult to do. When he did finally resign the chairmanship, he was elected president for life, remaining involved until 1986. In that year he had two operations, one after another, first on his Achilles tendon, and then for an enlarged prostate. He was never quite the same again.<br>
<br>Sir John Moores died on 25 September 1993 at his modest four-bedroomed home, Fairways, Shireburn Road, Formby, Liverpool, at the age of ninety-seven, and was cremated on 1 October at Southport crematorium, Scarisbrick; his ashes were interred in Dove Glade on 11 May 1994. He was reputedly one of the wealthiest men in Britain, and left an estate valued at over &pound;10 million. Moores was the archetype of the self-made man, in the paternalist, Victorian manner: his business acumen was matched by a concern for his workforce, and, while his family was at the centre of his world, he had a practical interest in the welfare of other young people. Liverpool Polytechnic was renamed Liverpool John Moores University in 1992, a testimony to his success, his philanthropy, and his devotion to the city of Liverpool.<br>
