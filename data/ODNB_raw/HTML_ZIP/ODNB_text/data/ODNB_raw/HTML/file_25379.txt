<span class="headword">Sherlock,  Richard</span>  (1612&#150;1689), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Oxton, a township on the Cheshire Wirral on 11 November 1612, and was baptized at the parish church of Woodchurch four days later. He was the third son of John Sherlock (<i>d</i>. 1613) and his wife, Cicely, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fells, who later married William Wilson and had two other sons, the elder of whom, Nathaniel (1626&#150;1702), was himself father of the bishop of Sodor and Man, Thomas Wilson. Sherlock's mother was determined to give him a good education. A stint at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, when he was aged only fourteen, proved both premature and expensive, and he was transferred to Trinity College, Dublin, where he proceeded MA in 1633. He remained in Ireland as minister of several small parishes until the rebellion of 1641. In September 1643, when the royalist leader the marquess of Ormond made a truce with the confederates and sent over some regiments to help Charles I against the parliamentarian forces, Sherlock returned to England as an army chaplain, but was soon captured in the royalist defeat at Nantwich, Cheshire. When released he returned to Oxford, where he became chaplain of the governor of the royal garrison and then a chaplain of New College, and in 1646, for sermons he had preached at court or before the royalist parliament at Oxford, he was awarded the degree of BD.<br>
<br>Ejected from the university by the parliamentary visitors about 1648 Sherlock became chaplain to Jasper Mayne in nearby Cassington, where he lodged with the mother of Anthony Wood, the antiquary. When Mayne in turn was ejected Sherlock returned north, in 1652, and became chaplain to Sir Robert Bindloss, a royalist baronet who lived at Borwick Hall, near Lancaster. There he was active on two fronts: reproving his patron for his &#145;love of company and many of the evils that attend it&#146;  (Wilson, xxiv) and engaging in debates with the local Quakers. In 1654 Sherlock published <span class="italic">The Quakers wilde questions objected against the ministers of the gospel &hellip; with brief answers thereunto</span> and a discourse on the operation of the Holy Spirit. After a reply by Richard Hubberthorne, Sherlock reprinted this work late in 1655 (though the title page says 1656), with two additional discourses on divine revelation and error, and thus incurred the wrath of George Fox (who attacked him in <span class="italic">The Great Mystery of the Great Whore Unfolded</span>, 1659, 242&#150;3).<br>
<br>Sherlock was introduced to Charles Stanley, eighth earl of Derby, who made him his chaplain at Latham, and at the Restoration nominated him to Winwick rectory in Lancashire. The earl also placed Sherlock on an eight-man commission to settle all matters ecclesiastical and civil on the Isle of Man. Having done so &#145;to the entire satisfaction of the lord and people of that island&#146;  (Wilson, xxvi), and been awarded a DD by Trinity College, Dublin, Sherlock finally gained full possession of Winwick, one of the richest livings in England, in 1662, and held it to his death there on 20 June 1689.<br>
<br>Sherlock repaid his patron's generosity by a long ministry of exemplary piety, diligence, and charity that is described fully by two who knew him well, Thomas Wilson (future bishop of Sodor and Man) and Thomas Crane (a friend and local minister). Sherlock's dedication is also revealed in the text of his publications and his will. He was personally very abstemious, fasted regularly, prostrated himself in his private chapel, prayed almost constantly, even in the middle of the night and in company, and daily contemplated death and eternity (leading to his <span class="italic">Practical Meditations upon the Four Last Things</span>, published posthumously in 1692). For nearly thirty years he was almost perpetually in residence, reading morning and evening prayer daily in church, and constantly preaching &#145;plain and practical sermons&#146;. He kept at least three curates for the service of the church and chapels in his large parish, so that Winwick &#145;became a very desirable place for young divines to improve themselves in the work of the ministry&#146;  (Wilson, xxvi&#150;xxvii). He was a &#145;pattern of good works&#146;  (Crane, 26), daily ministering to the needy, prisoners, and those in distress. He contributed much to the setting up of a stock of bread and cloth for the poor of his parish, the capital for which was topped up to &pound;300 on his death. His will and inventory show that he had regularly lent sums to the &#145;miserably poor&#146; with little or no prospect of repayment; he also bequeathed over &pound;100 to the poor of various parishes with which he had been associated, and money to finish the setting up of a free school at Warrington. The only personal item of value listed in the inventory was his library, valued at &pound;64 14<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>. He commissioned his own gravestone for Winwick church, describing himself as &#145;the most unworthy rector of this church&#146;, and ordered it to be placed in the chancel where it would be regularly trampled under foot  (will and inventory, Lancs. RO, WCW Richard Sherlock 1689). With no wife and children to look to, Sherlock's bequests to individuals were largely spread among his cousins, nephews, brothers-in-law, and steward and their families.<br>
<br>Two other features struck contemporaries. One was Sherlock's very strict observance of the established church's canons and his insistence on full and decent uniformity in public worship, which were reflected in his <span class="italic">The Irregularitie of a Private Prayer in a Publick Congregation</span> (1674) and <span class="italic">Several Short, but Seasonable Discourses Touching Common and Private Prayer</span> (1684). The other was his constant campaign to raise the levels of knowledge and commitment of his parishioners through catechizing and handing out free copies of his own publications. <span class="italic">Principles of Holy Christian Religion</span> had been written for the Bindloss household in the 1650s and consisted of a paraphrase of the prayer book catechism with extra questions and answers, and prayers. But it proved so useful not only in Winwick but elsewhere too that it sold nineteen editions in England between 1656 and 1699, and was also published in Welsh and in America. <span class="italic">Mercurius Christianus</span> (1673) or as it was thereafter called <span class="italic">The Practical Christian</span> was designed as its successor for his Winwick parishioners&#151;the practice to go with the doctrine, explained in plain words that all could understand. Much enlarged in later editions, this work consisted of prayers, meditations, psalms, and hymns, and a treatise on how to examine oneself for sin. To the sixth edition, published in 1713, Thomas Wilson added a life of his mentor, and noted that the impact of the works on Winwick had been visible in the great number of &#145;constant, devout communicants, as at that time were hardly to be seen in any parish in England&#146;  (Wilson, xxvi).<br>
<br>A portrait of Sherlock, in cap, bands, and gown, holding a copy of his <span class="italic">Practical Christian</span> in his right hand, still hangs in Winwick church. An engraving from this was inserted in some copies of this work.<br>
