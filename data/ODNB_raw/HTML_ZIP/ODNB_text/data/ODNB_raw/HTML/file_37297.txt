<span class="headword">Cocks, Sir  Richard</span>, second baronet  (<em>c.</em>1659&#150;1726), <span class="occ">parliamentary diarist and religious controversialist</span>, was the eldest son of Richard Cocks (1633&#150;1669) of the Middle Temple and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1669), daughter of Sir Robert Cooke of Highnam, Gloucestershire. Cocks was only ten years old when his father and mother both died, leaving him heir to his paternal grandfather's baronetcy and estate at Dumbleton, Gloucestershire, and the remainder of his upbringing seems to have been entrusted to the strict guidance of his elder sister, Dorothy, who regulated the family to her own pattern of godliness. Cocks was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1667, while still a child, but he does not appear ever to have taken up residence. In 1677 he matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford, where he spent at least a year, and where he later claimed to have suffered a worthless and drunken tutor. Cocks married Frances (1663&#150;1724), daughter of Richard Neville of Billingbear, Berkshire, in October 1688, the godly daughter of a family with strong puritan traditions. On his grandmother's death in 1690, he came to reside at Dumbleton and inaugurated an extensive programme of improvement, involving the construction of an entirely new manor house and the creation of fashionable gardens in the Dutch style.<br>
<br>Cocks's taste for public speaking was frequently indulged as chairman of the Gloucestershire quarter sessions, and in 1698, after several unsuccessful attempts to enter parliament, he secured election as knight of the shire. Various family connections, including his father's friendship with the lord chancellor, John, Baron Somers, drew him to the whig side in politics, despite his grandfather's support for the royalist side in the civil war. But he was no slavish follower of a party. Indeed, his stern morality and adherence to the ideals of classical republicanism, as mediated through such writers as Algernon Sidney and his own uncle by marriage, Henry Neville, made him into an archetypal &#145;country&#146; member, and he was quickly to the forefront in the agitations against a standing army, the presence of placemen in the Commons, and political corruption in general. At the same time his pathological detestation of &#145;popery&#146; guaranteed that he would vote with the whigs over other great questions of policy, such as the settlement of the Hanoverian succession and the resumption of war with France. So deep-rooted were his political principles and prejudices, and so pronounced his self-importance in pursuing them, that he came to be regarded in some quarters as not merely an individualist but something of a crank.<br>
<br>Cocks was not re-elected in the general election of 1702, nor thereafter, despite trying again more than once. Out of parliament he retired to his study and began to write&#151;fragments of history, religious meditations, political satires, in prose, verse, and even in dramatic form&#151;none of which were published, though some circulated in manuscript among his friends. From notes and other materials he was also able to construct in retrospect a diary of his parliamentary career, covering in particular detail the sessions of 1701&#150;2, which, surviving in manuscript form, now constitutes his chief claim to fame. Not until 1717 did he appear in print, with a grand jury charge denouncing Jacobites. Then in 1721&#150;2 he waded into the paper war over the so-called &#145;Bangorian controversy&#146; initiated by the sermon on church government by Benjamin Hoadly, bishop of Bangor.<br>
<br>In rapid succession Cocks produced four pamphlets promoting an Erastian view of ecclesiastical authority and a comprehensive religious settlement designed to include presbyterians: <span class="italic">A Perfect Discovery of Longitude</span> (1721), <span class="italic">The Church of England Secured</span> (1722), <span class="italic">Over Shoes, Over Boots</span> (1722), and his <span class="italic">Farewel Sermon</span> (1722). Their violently anti-clerical tone, occasionally stooping to scurrilous abuse, provoked sharp replies from churchmen, some of whom themselves descended to the level of personal insults, mostly on the score of Cocks's diminutive size and renowned eccentricity. To Thomas Hearne, for example, he was &#145;a whimsical, crazed man&#146;; to another high tory he was a &#145;peevish elf&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parliamentary Diary</span>, xiii). Undaunted, Cocks hit back with yet another tract, <span class="italic">A True and Impartial Inquiry &hellip; into the Late Bloody Execution at Thorn</span> (1727), though this was no more than a stale reprise of past polemic, and was published only posthumously.<br>
<br>Within a few months of the death of his first wife, in 1724, Cocks took as his second wife Mary Bethell (<i>d</i>. 1765), daughter of William Bethell of Swindon in Yorkshire and sister of Hugh Bethell MP. There were no children of either marriage, so that on his death, about 21 October 1726 at Dumbleton, where he was buried at St Peter's Church, the baronetcy passed to his brother Robert, rector of Bladon, in Oxfordshire. The estate at Dumbleton was, however, willed directly to his nephew, Robert's second surviving son and namesake. In characteristic style, Cocks's will included a political valediction which gave expression to his resolute whiggism. He adjured his &#145;friends and relations&#146; to<blockquote>serve God in a manner worthy of Him, and not to disturb the peace of their country with party and idle distinctions, which in weak persons is only the effect of their folly in cunning of private interest and ambition. I desire them to love one the other, to be kind to their neighbours, and be faithful and loyal to King George and to have more regard to the Protestant interest than to any private views whatever. (<span class="italic">Parliamentary Diary</span>, lix)</blockquote>
