<span class="headword">Vidal,  Alexander Thomas Emeric</span>  (1792&#150;1863), <span class="occ">naval officer and hydrographer</span>, was the youngest of the three sons (there was also a daughter) of Emeric Vidal, a naval officer who served as secretary to three distinguished admirals (Sir Robert Kingsmill, Sir John Ross, and Robert Duff), and his wife, Jane Essex. The Vidals came originally from the Basque country. Vidal entered the Royal Navy as a first-class volunteer on the <i>Illustrious</i> in 1803. On 22 May 1807 he joined the Royal Naval College in Portsmouth for eighteen months, after which, as a midshipman, he served in the <i>Lavinia</i> in the Mediterranean and north Atlantic for more than three years.<br>
<br>In 1814 Vidal sailed in the <i>Conway</i> for the North American station, and later was detached to work under Captain W. F. Owen on a survey of the Canadian Great Lakes. Here he learned surveying, and on 6 February 1815 was promoted lieutenant. When Captain Owen commissioned the ship-sloop <i>Leven</i> (24 guns) and the brig <i>Barracouta</i> (10 guns) in 1821 for his survey of the east coast of Africa, Vidal was appointed first lieutenant in the <i>Leven</i>. When the <i>Barracouta</i>'s captain died in 1823 Vidal was placed in command and confirmed in the rank of commander from 15 May 1823. Two years later, when Owen brought his ships home, Vidal was advanced to captain (4 October 1825).<br>
<br>In the summer of 1830, as a consequence of a number of reports and unsuccessful searches for Aitkin's Rock, which was said to lie about 70 miles off the north-west coast of Ireland, two ten-gun brigs were placed under Vidal's orders to make a final search. In three months the area covered by the several reports was closely examined and this potential danger to shipping erased from the charts.<br>
<br>In December 1835 Vidal sailed in command of the converted bomb-vessel <i>Aetna</i> with twelve chronometers to measure the meridian distances from the Cape Verde Islands to a number of places on the west coast of Africa, and afterwards to carry out surveys of the coast. It was unpopular but useful work, which he completed despite ill health. From 1841 to 1846, closely associated with the authorities in Lisbon, he surveyed the Azores in the <i>Styx</i>. He was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and contributed papers on hydrographic matters to its journal. He became rear-admiral on 27 January 1854 and vice-admiral on 17 June 1859. He published a chart of the Salvage Islands, thirteen charts of the Cape Verde Islands, a chart of the coast of England, and one of Vidal Bank off the north-west coast of England.<br>
<br>In October 1839, in Canada, Vidal married Sarah Antoinette (<i>d</i>. June 1843), the daughter of Henry Veicht of Madeira; they had two sons, one of whom died at an early age and the other, Beaufort, became a general in the Canadian army. Vidal died at 13 Sion Hill, Clifton, Gloucestershire, on 5 February 1863. Several features in the different parts of the world he surveyed bear his name, notably Cape Vidal on the east coast of Africa.<br>
