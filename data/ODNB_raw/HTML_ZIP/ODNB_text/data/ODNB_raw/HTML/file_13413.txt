</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hoby, Sir  Philip</span>  (1504/5&#150;1558), <span class="occ">diplomat and administrator</span>, was the first son of William Hoby (<i>d</i>. after 1532), landowner, of Leominster, Herefordshire, and his first wife, Katherine Foster. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13414/', "Sir Thomas Hoby (1530&#150;1566)")</script>, the courtier and translator, was his half-brother. He came from a Welsh family that settled in Leominster during his father's time. Nothing is known of his education but he was proficient in several foreign languages and was clearly well educated, having probably travelled through Europe as a young man.<br>
<br>Hoby was by 1538 identified as one of the grooms of the privy chamber and probably had a strong connection with Sir Thomas Cromwell, who identified him as a friend sharing the same interest in religious reform. His career was advanced through service to Cromwell, probably going back to the early 1530s. He served Dr Nicholas Hawkins, resident ambassador to Charles V, between 1532 and 1534, learning his craft as a diplomat. His first formal overseas assignment came as a special mission for Cromwell. Between about 28 February and about 1 April 1538 he accompanied Hans Holbein the younger to obtain portraits of potential marriage partners for Henry VIII. He seems to have received a total diet of &pound;46 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. Hoby was instructed by Cromwell to visit the household of Claude de Lorraine, first duc de Guise, to examine his two daughters. Before this Hoby and Holbein went to the Low Countries, where they had an audience with the regent about 11 March, the artist making the drawing for his famous portrait of Christina of Denmark the following day. While not a diplomatic mission, it certainly added to Hoby's qualifications to undertake royal business abroad.<br>
<br>Hoby had experience in a working embassy, had the advantage of skill in languages and foreign travel, and enjoyed Henry VIII's confidence and Cromwell's patronage. He was the quintessential Tudor lay diplomatic representative, when his first formal assignment came on 10 October. His instructions were to join the resident ambassador, Sir Thomas Wyatt the elder, to advise Charles V, with whom he had an audience on 1 November, on various foreign policy matters as Henry saw them, all intended to promote peace in Europe. His mission, one of no great consequence, was concluded by 17 December. He was appointed woodward of Ashwood, Leominster, from 25 March 1538 to 28 April 1546 in reward.<br>
<br>Hoby continued as a leading courtier, who was often entrusted with military duties, until the end of the reign. He was part of the reception for Anne of Cleves in 1540, an understandable assignment since he had been special ambassador to the Cleves court in a poorly documented mission between about 8 and 25 November 1539, when he probably negotiated her marriage to Henry and apparently obtained a painting of her. No disadvantage seemed to attach to him in the Cleves divorce and the fall of Cromwell. Instead, he was given a more prominent role in government. By 1540 he had married well, to Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1500&#150;1560), daughter of Sir Walter Stoner of Stoner, Oxfordshire. Holbein probably produced the drawings of the couple about this time. They had no children. Elizabeth Hoby was part of the protestant court circle surrounding Katherine Parr and this connection reinforced her husband's position. On 4 February 1542 Philip Hoby submitted to the privy council the books containing examinations and inventories of the goods of Jews who had been arrested under his commission. He was in trouble himself over his own religious beliefs, being committed to the Fleet prison on 18 March 1543 for having maintained the cleric Thomas Parson, whose &#145;evill opinions&#146; regarding the sacrament of the altar were well known  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1542&#150;7</i>, 101). Hoby was released six days later and appointed gentleman usher of the black rod and to the Order of the Garter on 3 November, as well as being a member of Katherine's council between 1543 and 1548. It took military service at Boulogne to secure his knighthood on 30 September 1544. He subsequently served in the invasion of Scotland led by Edward Seymour, earl of Hertford, in September 1545, in which he was master of the ordnance northward. He was appointed on 12 May Katherine's steward for foreign receipts and steward for her husband, Thomas Seymour, Lord Seymour, in 1548. Hoby was remembered in Henry VIII's will with a bequest of &pound;133 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. and benefited from royal land grants, acquiring former monastic property in Worcestershire in 1541 and in Lincolnshire in 1544.<br>
<br>Edward VI's reign was the high point of Hoby's diplomatic career. He served in the parliament of 1547 as an MP for Cardiff Boroughs, having probably been advanced by Sir William Herbert, Katherine's brother-in-law, but seemingly missed the majority of the sessions due to service abroad. He was also appointed JP for Middlesex and for Worcestershire in May 1547 (of the quorum from 1554). He was resident ambassador to the emperor from about 15 April 1548, with specific instructions to secure military assistance in countering a presumably impending French invasion. His secretary was John Bernardino. Charles's peripatetic court moved between the Low Countries and parts of Germany, with Hoby dutifully following. His residency was punctuated with a brief return home in autumn 1549 to pursue private patronage objectives, during which Hoby earned some notoriety. He apparently played a key role in the capitulation of Hertford, now duke of Somerset, to the privy council and John Dudley, earl of Warwick. Hoby, trusted by both sides, and previously a strong supporter of Somerset, served as a skilled negotiator between 6 and 13 October as both factions manoeuvred to avoid civil war. He was well aware that the London councillors intended to strip Somerset of his power. It is notable that Hoby guaranteed the duke's life, being instrumental in gaining his surrender on 11 October through his careful diplomacy, and his thoughts at the ultimate d&eacute;nouement may be imagined. Hoby's resumption of resident responsibilities in Brussels, this time accompanied by Sir Thomas Cheyne, included an explanation to the emperor of recent events in London and a repeated request for imperial troops to assist the English at Boulogne. This residency formally ended on 20 November 1550. Charles praised his diplomatic skills upon Hoby's return.<br>
<br>Hoby was a member of the entourage of William Parr, marquess of Northampton, when he was sent to France from 25 April to 12 August 1551. This was a major embassy that was designed to impress and even overawe the French court, leaving England with a large train that included Thomas Goodrich, the bishop of Ely, Henry Manners, second earl of Rutland, William Somerset, third earl of Worcester, Thomas Butler, eleventh earl of Ormond, and several barons, among a great many others. Hoby alone provided for thirty retainers and servants in his retinue, with a diet of &pound;3 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. per day to support this. The purpose of the embassy was to convey the Garter to Henri II, to negotiate the marriage of Edward to a French princess, and to cement the Anglo-French amity. In this mission Hoby was presumably a strategic negotiator, for he carried unusual status&#151;the third-ranking envoy among a group of luminaries&#151;but his specific role remains obscure. He was rewarded with appointment to the privy council on 16 August. His importance as a privy councillor and master of the ordnance (26 March 1547 to 11 May 1554) was such that, when the court departed London for the country in autumn 1552, he was required to remain at the Tower of London with half the privy council to continue the business of royal government. Shortly thereafter he secured the former abbey at Bisham, Berkshire. This site is closely identified with him, his half-brother Thomas Hoby, and his highly literate sister-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13411/', "Elizabeth Russell, n&#233;e Cooke (1528&#150;1609)")</script>, who constructed a magnificent monument there to both Philip and Thomas Hoby.<br>
<br>Yet another diplomatic assignment came between 13 February and about 5 March 1552. Sent to the regent in the Low Countries in company with Sir Thomas Gresham, it was Hoby's responsibility to secure a renegotiation of English loans from the Fuggers, and also to protest various imperial infringements on English naval and commercial rights in the area. A final, formal diplomatic duty was carried out from 2 April 1553, when Thomas Thirlby, bishop of Norwich, and he went to the emperor. Thirlby remained as the resident ambassador, while Hoby assumed a similar role with the regent in the Low Countries, receiving an audience on 18 May. He remained until 1 September, when he was recalled by Mary I. Hoby's sojourn in the Low Countries allowed him to avoid more direct involvement in the attempt to alter the succession, although he continued to comply with orders from the privy council after being informed of Edward's death. The source of Professor A. F. Pollard's speculation about whether Lord Guildford Dudley would receive the crown matrimonial or not is a letter from Hoby and Sir Richard Morison to the privy council of 15 July in which they informed them that rumours to that effect were current in the Low Countries. Although he supported Mary's marriage to Philip of Spain and was named capital burgess of Leominster on 28 March 1554, Hoby's importance diminished sharply, especially in the paranoid atmosphere in the wake of the rebellion of Sir Thomas Wyatt the younger.<br>
<br>Simon Renard, the imperial ambassador, identified Hoby as one of the craftiest heretics in England but no other indictment is known. Philip and Thomas Hoby nevertheless felt it prudent to go into exile, although the queen was willing to appoint the elder brother as resident ambassador to the regent in the Low Countries at the outset of his travels. Sir Philip Hoby's announced specific purpose for going abroad was to take the waters at Li&egrave;ge and Aix-la-Chapelle in order to try to gain some relief from recurrent illness. He visited the regent in July 1554, and then continued on to Italy. There he consorted with various exiles, some of whose activities were actually treasonous. In fact, Renard voiced the suspicion that Hoby was abroad only to plot against the regime with various dissidents. Both Hobys are noted as spending considerable time with Sir John Cheke at Padua in 1555. It may also be at this time that Hoby began a friendship with the artists Titian and Pietro Aretino.<br>
<br>The Hobys made their way back to England in January 1556, but not before securing assurances of safety from Philip in the Low Countries. Philip pursued a policy of currying favour with important Englishmen whose future usefulness might prove valuable. Sir Philip Hoby's next two years at Bisham were ones of declining health, culminating in his death at his London home in Blackfriars on 9 May 1558, aged fifty-three. His will was written on 1 May and proved on 2 July. In it, his ties to Sir William Cecil, Sir John Mason, and Sir Henry Paget are clear. The bulk of his property went to his half-brother. His body was later moved to Bisham, where a magnificent monument is still to be found, the inscription on which gives his date of death as 31 May.<br>
