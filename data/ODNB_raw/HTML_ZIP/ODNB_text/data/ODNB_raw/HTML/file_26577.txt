<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stone,  Nicholas</span>  (1585<span class="mult">x</span>8&#150;1647), <span class="occ">sculptor, master mason, and architect</span>, was born in Devon, probably at Woodbury near Exeter, the son of a quarryman&#151;possibly John Stone (<i>d</i>. 1618). By his own account he served for two years as an apprentice and for a further year as a journeyman under the London sculptor Isaac James. It seems likely that in 1607 he met the distinguished Dutch architect and sculptor Hendrick de Keyser who was then visiting London and that de Keyser took him back to Amsterdam and employed him as a workshop assistant. While still there, on 14 May 1613, he married de Keyser's daughter Mayken 
    (Mary; 1592&#150;1647)
  ; in the same year the couple returned to London and settled in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, where Stone is listed as a ratepayer from 1613/14 until the end of his life.<br>
<br>After he had finished his training, Stone quickly established a successful workshop in London. He received important commissions from 1614 onwards and from 1616 he was intermittently in the royal service. In 1626 he was appointed master mason and architect at Windsor Castle and in 1632 he succeeded William Cure the younger as master mason to the crown. He was much involved in the affairs of the Masons' Company of London of which he was twice warden and twice master. Eleven people were apprenticed to him under the company's auspices.<br>
<br>Stone's work is chiefly recorded in two documents, both preserved in Sir John Soane's Museum, London. They are his autograph notebook which covers the years 1614&#150;41 and an account book which was kept for his workshop from 1631 to 1642. These reveal not only what he did but when and for whom, a wealth of information which cannot remotely be matched for any other sculptor or master mason working in the England of his day. Because of this factual disparity his importance is easily exaggerated, but it is clear that by the end of the 1620s he had become England's leading sculptor in stone and marble and that by the following decade he had achieved a similar position in the building trade. He retained this pre-eminence until the end of his working life.<br>
<br>Stone's busy workshop could supply whatever sculpture the market demanded in the materials he used: garden statuary, busts, and full-length figures for the interiors and exteriors of secular buildings, chimneypieces, and, above all, monuments to the dead for churches. Apart from the monuments most of this work has perished. A figure of Elizabeth I which was commissioned for the Royal Exchange in the City of London <i>c</i>.1622 escaped the great fire because it was deemed unsuitable for its purpose and never erected (Guildhall Art Gallery, London). Of the chimneypieces all that is known to survive is an elaborate overmantel supplied to Newburgh Priory, North Riding of Yorkshire, in 1616 with a mythological bas-relief flanked by standing deities. Two ill-preserved statues at Blickling Hall, Norfolk, and a series at Wilton House, Wiltshire, which has fared rather better, testify to Stone's work as a sculptor for gardens.<br>
<br>Stone's sculpture must, therefore, be judged largely by the memorials he made. These are of great variety and, at their best, of extremely high quality. He conformed to traditional types when nothing more was required of him but he was also capable of giving creative expression to his patrons' personal interests and he was highly responsive to new artistic influences from the continent of Europe. The collections of Graeco-Roman sculpture that were being imported by wealthy courtiers in the early Stuart period find an echo in the figures of the cardinal virtues from the tomb of Henry Howard, ninth earl of Northampton (1615&#150;16; Trinity Hospital, Greenwich), and in the cross-legged, standing effigies of John and Thomas Lyttleton (1635; Magdalen College chapel, Oxford). At Chilham in Kent, Mary, Lady Digges, is commemorated by a column surmounted by an urn with allegorical figures seated at the base, a composition which is of French origin, deriving from the tomb of the heart of Anne de Montmorency by Barth&eacute;lemy Prieur (<i>c</i>.1570&#150;80; Paris, Louvre). Stone's most celebrated and influential memorial is that of John Donne in St Paul's Cathedral, London (1631&#150;2). It shows the famous poet and divine in his graveclothes, rising from an urn at the sound of the last trumpet. This was Donne's own idea and he posed for a painting which served as a model for the effigy.<br>
<br>In his capacity as a master mason Stone built the Banqueting House at the royal palace of Whitehall to Inigo Jones's designs (1619&#150;21) and Goldsmiths' Hall in the City of London to designs of his own (1635&#150;8). He was also his own architect for a partial rebuilding of Cornbury House, Oxfordshire (1631&#150;3), and probably for three monumental gateways at the botanical gardens in Oxford which were undertaken at the same time for Henry Danvers, first earl of Danby, his patron at Cornbury. He remodelled the north front of Kirby Hall, Northamptonshire, for Sir Christopher (later first Lord) Hatton (1638&#150;40; in ruins) and erected a chapel at Chilham church in Kent to contain the Digges memorial (1631&#150;2; rebuilt). Balls Park, Hertfordshire (1638&#150;40), and Lindsey House, Lincoln's Inn Fields in London (<i>c</i>.1640), are convincingly attributed to him. Stylistically his buildings fall midway between the learned classicism of Jones and the uncouth &#145;Artisan Mannerist&#146; work of his own master mason contemporaries.<br>
<br>Stone's career came to an end with the outbreak of the English civil war. Though prosperous at the close of his working life he was later &#145;sequestred, plundered and imprisoned&#146;, supposedly on account of his loyalty to the crown (petition submitted by his son <a href="#cosubject_26575">John [<i>see below</i>]</a> to Charles II in 1660; Stone, 28). He died at Long Acre, London, on 24 August 1647 and was buried at the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields on 28 August. His facial features are recorded in a drawing of his monumental effigy which was formerly in the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields.<br>
<br>Stone had four children of whom three survived into adult life and became sculptors, although none achieved his father's distinction. <a name="cosubject_26573"></a><span class="headword">Henry Stone</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1616, <em>d.</em> 1653), the eldest son, baptized on 18 July 1616, was a <span class="occ">painter as well as a sculptor</span>. According to the epitaph on his memorial he became highly proficient in foreign languages and spent most of his life abroad in Holland, France, and Italy. It appears that by 1632 he had gone to Amsterdam and joined the family of his maternal uncle, the painter and architect Thomas de Keyser, perhaps working under him as a pupil or assistant. In April 1638 he met up with his younger brother Nicholas in Paris and accompanied him on his tour of the continent of Europe which lasted at least until July 1642. On his father's death Henry inherited most of his property and he seems to have continued the family business in sculpture with his brother John. The parish register at the time of his death, on 24 August 1653, distinguishes him by the title of &#145;gentleman&#146; and he was perhaps too genteel to have done much work: little by way of either painting or sculpture can now be assigned to him. There is, however, a fine portrait of Thomas, Lord Leigh, at Stoneleigh Abbey, Warwickshire, which bears an old inscription with his surname, initial, and the date 1649.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_26578"></a><span class="headword">Nicholas Stone</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1618, <em>d.</em> 1647)<span class="occ"></span>, the second son, baptized on 8 September 1618, had a career which began with great promise but then faded out; like his elder brother, he died an early death. It is said, on good authority, that he learned all his father could teach him about carving marble, but that he was dissatisfied with his training &#145;being an ingenious youth, and desirous to learn some more art in Italy&#146; (letter, Sir Thomas Roe to Samuel Boothouse, 29 March 1638; White, 138). In March 1638 he set off on a European tour in the course of which he was able to draw and model from the Medici art collections in Florence; later, in Rome he met the papal sculptor Gianlorenzo Bernini who discussed his own work with him and advised him on the art of drawing. All this experience appears to have gone entirely to waste, for in the few years that remained to him after he returned to England he seems to have done nothing but trade in stone. Models which he made were said to &#145;pass for the works of famous Italian artists&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 1.90). They are not known to survive, though a sketchbook which he used on his travels is extant (Sir John Soane's Museum, London). He died on 17 September 1647 and was buried three days later at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_26575"></a><span class="headword">John Stone</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1620, <em>d.</em> 1667)<span class="occ"></span>, the youngest son, was baptized on 27 September 1620 and is said to have been &#145;brought up&#146; at Oxford and destined for a career in the church  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 1.89). There is good evidence that he spent part of his career as a soldier and he is alleged to have fought on the royalist side in the civil war. By November 1652 he had become involved in the administration of his father's business and on the death of his brother Henry in the following year he appears to have taken it over entirely. In the back of his father's notebook he listed sixteen church monuments which he claimed to have made. At the restoration of the monarchy he was appointed to his father's old office of master mason at Windsor Castle though ill health seems to have prevented him from carrying out his duties. His cousin Charles Stoakes believed him to have been an &#145;Exelent Architectt&#146;  (&#145;Note-book&#146;, 138). It is very likely that he designed Chesterton House in Warwickshire for which he is known to have drawn out an ornamental detail and supplied other decorative components (<i>c</i>.1655&#150;<i>c</i>.1662; dem. 1802). He died, unmarried, in 1667, and was also buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 11 September.<br>
