<span class="headword">Wilkin,  Simon Wilkin</span>  (1790&#150;1862), <span class="occ">publisher and literary scholar</span>, was born at Costessey (Cossey), Norfolk, on 27 July 1790, the second of the three children of William Wilkin Wilkin (1762&#150;1799), a Norfolk flour miller, and his wife, Cecilia Lucy (<i>d</i>. 1796), daughter of William Jacomb of London. On his father's death Wilkin moved to Norwich to live with his guardian, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15610/', "Joseph Kinghorn")</script>, who educated him at home. At twenty-one Wilkin was an expert entomologist, a fellow of the Linnean Society, and a member of the Wernerian Society of Edinburgh. His niece Cecilia Lucy Brightwell quotes her father's description of him as &#145;a good scholar &hellip; attractive in manner, and agreeable in personal appearance&#146;.<br>
<br>Two major crises affected Wilkin's life: having inherited substantially in 1811, he lost everything in 1816, when the paper mill in which he was a partner failed, and in 1832 his guardian's death was a severe blow. Bankruptcy compelled him to sell his outstanding entomological collection, which was purchased by the Zoological Society. Soon after, however, he established a well-respected printing and publishing business in Norwich, his authors including Harriet Martineau, Amelia Opie, George Borrow, and William Taylor. On 18 July 1825 he married Emma, daughter of John Culley of Costessey, and they had two daughters and a son.<br>
<br>In 1834 Wilkin moved with his family to London, increasingly estranged from the Baptist church to which he had been a generous benefactor, through disagreement with its policy on communion. He had played a major role in the development of the Norfolk and Norwich Literary Institution and Norwich Museum, but once he left Norwich, much of his energy seems to have faded.<br>
<br>Wilkin's greatest achievement was his four-volume edition of the works of the seventeenth-century physician and author Sir Thomas Browne (1836; reissued 1852). He collated manuscripts and early editions meticulously so as to produce the best possible text, exhaustively researching Browne's vast correspondence in the British Museum and Bodleian Library. Geoffrey Keynes saw his work as the foundation of all subsequent editions, praising him as &#145;the ideal editor for Browne&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>). Wilkin also wrote a textbook on the use of the globes (1823&#150;6), and contributed to his son Martin Hood Wilkin's biography of his guardian, <span class="italic">Joseph Kinghorn of Norwich</span> (1855).<br>
<br>Wilkin's London years, spent at Cossey Cottage, Pilgrim Lane, Hampstead, were saddened by doctrinal disputes with the Norwich Baptists. He died at home on 28 July 1862, and was buried in his native village of Costessey.<br>
