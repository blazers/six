<span class="headword">Balliol,  Bernard  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1154<span class="mult">x</span>62), <span class="occ">baron</span>, was the leading member of the second generation of his family in England, having succeeded to the estates of his uncle Guy by 1130&#150;33. He is referred to as &#145;senior&#146; in the Durham <span class="italic">Liber vitae</span>. Guy de Balliol had been established in England in the 1090s by William II on lands partly carved out of the forfeited earldom of Northumbria and almost certainly in return for support rendered in William's campaigns on the eastern frontier of Normandy in 1091 and 1094. Of the several families of the Balliol name (or its derivative forms) in medieval Britain and France, Guy and his successors originated from Bailleul-en-Vimeu near Abbeville in the county of Ponthieu, outside the boundary of the duchy of Normandy, in an area which later became part of the <i>d&eacute;partement</i> of the Somme. Their Picard associations remained strong throughout the eight generations of the family's history down to the death of Edward Balliol in 1364.<br>
<br>A somewhat less shadowy figure than his uncle, Bernard de Balliol was one of the two barons&#151;the other was Robert (I) de Brus&#151;sent from the English royal camp to negotiate with David I, king of Scots, before the battle of the Standard in 1138. Having failed to dissuade David from crossing the River Tees into Yorkshire, Balliol publicly renounced the personal oath of fealty he had sworn to David on an earlier occasion, possibly in 1135, while Brus retracted the homage he owed the king for lands held of him in Scotland. Unlike the Brus family the Balliols did not at that date have any possessions in the northern kingdom. As a continuing supporter of King Stephen, Bernard de Balliol shared in his defeat at Lincoln in 1141, and suffered depredations at the hands of William Cumin, the pretender and usurper of the see of Durham, from 1141 to 1144.<br>
<br>Four of Bernard de Balliol's charters provide the earliest evidence of the family's Picard origins. His name is commemorated in the castle and &#145;new town&#146; of Barnard Castle (<i>Castrum Bernardi</i>), co. Durham, although a ringwork fortification probably already existed there before 1130 and the actual date of his eponymous foundation of the borough is not known. The eldest of at least four other brothers&#151;Ralph, Ingram, Hugh, and Joscelin&#151;Balliol himself had four sons and a daughter with his wife, Maud: Ingram, Guy, Eustace, Bernard, and Hawise. But the third generation of the family came to be represented in the male line in Britain by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1205/', "Bernard de Balliol &#145;junior&#146; (d. c.1190)")</script> alone. Ingram predeceased his father, who was succeeded, probably fairly briefly, for a period between 1152&#150;3 and 1161 by his second son, Guy.<br>
