<span class="headword">Stout, Sir  Robert</span>  (1844&#150;1930), <span class="occ">lawyer and premier of New Zealand</span>, was born at Lerwick, in the Shetland Islands, on 28 September 1844, the eldest of the six children of Thomas Stout, a merchant and landed proprietor of Lerwick, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith. He was educated at the parish school, where he was appointed a pupil teacher at the age of thirteen. After qualifying as a teacher and as a surveyor, he decided in 1863 to emigrate to New Zealand. He arrived in Dunedin on 8 April 1864. Having failed to get employment as a surveyor on the Otago goldfields, he taught at John Shaw's Grammar School and then at the North Dunedin district school, before he was articled to a legal office in Dunedin in 1867. He completed his articles in three years instead of the customary five and was called to the bar in July 1871. That year he was one of the first students at the new University of Otago, where he gained first place in the mental and moral science and political economy examinations. Between 1873 and 1875 he was the university's first law lecturer: he became one of Dunedin's leading lawyers, an accomplished and forceful debater, and a formidable pleader before a jury. He was a tall, striking man with, in later years, a large white beard.<br>
<br>Stout became involved in Dunedin's public life, in particular as a leader of free thought. He often engaged in religious and theological debates and became well known for his strong support for secular education. Keenly interested in politics and contemporary political theory, he was well read in such authors as Herbert Spencer and John Stuart Mill. On 20 August 1875 he was elected to the house of representatives representing Caversham, as an opponent of the <span class="roman">Abolition of Provinces Bill</span>, and on 20 December 1875 he was returned at the general election for the City of Dunedin. On 27 December 1876 he married <a href="#cosubject_53927">Anna Paterson Logan [<i>see below</i>]</a> in Dunedin.<br>
<br>The <span class="roman">Abolition of Provinces Bill</span> was enacted in 1876, but Stout remained in politics, and on 13 March 1878 was appointed attorney-general in the ministry of Sir George Grey, who had led the fight against abolition. He drafted much of the legislation put before the house by the Grey government. From 25 July 1878 he was also minister for lands and immigration. He resigned from the ministry on 25 June 1879, ostensibly to devote more time to his legal career, but also because of conflict with Grey over his own involvement and that of other ministers in the promotion of land and railway companies. He returned to the house in July 1884 as member for Dunedin East and in August formed a ministry with Julius Vogel as colonial treasurer. Stout was premier, attorney-general, and minister of education. The ministry lost a vote of confidence almost at once but returned in September and lasted until defeated in the general election of September 1887, when Stout himself lost his seat. Stout was premier only because of Vogel's physical disabilities. The two ministers and other colleagues were linked&#151;unbeknown to the public&#151;by the need for legislation to deal with the continuing problems of companies with which they were involved. Vogel's prestige waned as the ministry proved unable to lift the country out of depression. Stout was responsible for the <span class="roman">Civil Service Reform Bill</span>, intended to eliminate political patronage from appointments, and the <span class="roman">Hospitals and Charitable Institutions Act</span> of 1885. The conferment on him of a KCMG in 1886 caused controversy, as he had not so far had a very lengthy political career.<br>
<br>Stout returned to politics in June 1893 as member for Inangahua. The Liberal premier, John Ballance, who had died that April, had favoured Stout to be his successor, but Stout was outmanoeuvred by, and lost the leadership to, Richard John Seddon. From November 1893 to 1898 Stout was member for the City of Wellington. He was an influential champion of women's suffrage, and was largely responsible for the <span class="roman">Married Women's Property Act</span> (1884) which empowered married women to acquire, hold, and dispose of property. After 1893 he grew increasingly critical of the development of party politics, which offended his strong individualism. Marginalized and frustrated in the new Seddon-dominated political atmosphere of the 1890s, he left politics in 1898 to devote more time to his family and his legal career. On 22 June 1899 he was appointed chief justice of the supreme court, a position which enabled him to concentrate on the law while continuing in public life at a high and influential level. He held this post until his retirement on 31 January 1926.<br>
<br>As chief justice Stout decided more than 1400 cases, 450 of them as a member of the court of appeal. He consistently applied a liberal construction of statutes. While he was opposed to excessive government regulation, he saw a need to protect the public interest against the effects of monopolies. He did important work on the consolidation of statutes, and showed particular strength in the areas of criminal law, procedure, and cases involving the <span class="roman">Family Protection Act</span>. He also took a leading role in the framing of the <span class="roman">First Offenders' Probation Act</span> (1886).<br>
<br>Stout made a major contribution to the development of New Zealand's university system. He served on the senate of the University of New Zealand from 1884 to 1930 and the council of the University of Otago from 1891 to 1898, and was chancellor of the University of New Zealand from 1903 to 1923. He was one of the prime movers in the establishing of a university college in the capital in the late 1890s and served on the council of Victoria University College, Wellington, from 1900 to 1915. Honorary degrees were conferred on him by the universities of Oxford, Edinburgh, and Manchester.<br>
<br>In 1921 Stout was admitted a privy councillor. He served on the judicial committee of the privy council and was a member of the New Zealand legislative council from his retirement as chief justice in 1926 until his death, at his home, 238 The Terrace, Wellington, on 19 July 1930. He was buried at Karori, Wellington. Stout contributed to New Zealand's development in a remarkably wide range of spheres, gaining the highest office in politics, the law, and university education. His career exemplified the opportunities open to a person of ability and initiative in a new society such as New Zealand in the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Stout's wife, <a name="cosubject_53927"></a><span class="headword">Anna Paterson Stout <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Logan]</span></span>, Lady Stout  (1858&#150;1931)<span class="occ"></span>, was born in Dunedin on 29 September 1858, the daughter of John Logan, a public official in Otago. Her parents had emigrated from Scotland and settled in Dunedin in 1854. She married Robert Stout in 1876 and between 1878 and 1894 she gave birth to four sons and two daughters. She shared with her husband many progressive political views. Anna became a strong advocate of equal rights for women, but for some time the priority she attached to her family life meant that she had little opportunity to give effect to these ideals. In the 1890s she became more active in women's and temperance movements, though her activism was limited by the restrictions imposed by her husband's career when in 1899 he became chief justice. However, when the family went to England for a visit in 1909, and Anna stayed on until 1912 while her children were studying, she became involved in the British suffrage movement, in particular the Women's Social and Political Union. Her views were listened to as one of the leading suffragists from a country where, since 1893, women had had the vote. This was a brief but intense period of personal liberation after the years of self-effacement in the interests of her husband's career. In later years Anna Stout was active in a range of organizations. Throughout her life she supported the social purity movement, which contested the double standard in the enforcement of laws relating to sexual morality. She suffered from ill health for some years before her death, at Hanmer Springs on 10 May 1931. She was buried at Karori, Wellington, on 12 May.<br>
