<span class="headword">Austen,  John Archibald</span>  (1886&#150;1948), <span class="occ">artist and book illustrator</span>, was born on 5 January 1886 at 19 George Street, Buckland, Kent, the son of Walter John Clement Austen, a journeyman joiner, and his wife, Priscilla Jane Hooker. He initially trained as a carpenter, but in 1906 he moved to London, where he studied art, including life drawing, and, according to Dorothy Richardson, became &#145;a long-haired studio exquisite&#146;  (Richardson, 22). He was much influenced by the work of Aubrey Beardsley, and to begin with his art was very imitative; his first illustrations were decorative and &#145;stylish&#146;, with a tendency to exaggeration in the drawings of figures. His early work was in pen and ink, but he later also employed wood-engraving and pencil and wash.<br>
<br>Soon after the First World War, Austen became acquainted with Austin Spare, an artist of unusual gifts and of an even more unusual personality, who produced some fine figure drawings as well as some rather strange &#145;psychic&#146; drawings. With Alan Odle and Harry Clarke, Austen contributed drawings to Spare's sumptuously produced but short-lived quarterly, the <span class="italic">Golden Hind</span> (1922&#150;4), and in 1925 Austen, Spare, Odle, and Clarke exhibited at St George's Gallery in London. In the late 1920s illness forced Austen to leave London and return to Kent, to Jesson, near Canterbury. In London he was &#145;the perfect aesthete, precious, even in appearance, to the finger-tips; and a trifle cynical&#146;  (Richardson, 22), but back in the country he combined more simple rural pursuits such as gardening with his continued artistic work, including teaching at the Thanet School of Art. In 1937 his book <span class="italic">The ABC of Pen and Ink Rendering</span> was published by Pitman.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1920s Austen refined his style and, although his illustrations were still mannered and showed his lingering fascination with patterns, by the 1930s they became much simpler. His illustrations for Disraeli's <span class="italic">Ixion in Heaven</span> (1925) may well show his final escape from Beardsley's influence, even though throughout his career he was perhaps more of a decorator than an illustrator and often took an active part in designing many of the books he illustrated. Over his lifetime he illustrated some forty books, among them many classics of English literature such as <span class="italic">Moll Flanders</span>, <span class="italic">The Pickwick Papers</span>, and <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, for publishers Bodley Head, Oxford University Press, and William Jackson. His humorous, bold, and simple wood-engravings for Aristophanes' <span class="italic">The Frogs</span> (1937), issued by the Limited Editions Club, were followed by other work for that publisher, and culminated in a commission to illustrate and design a large two-volume edition of Spenser's <span class="italic">The Faerie Queene</span>, with wood-engravings made to resemble Elizabethan tapestries. Austen began work on the book in 1939 and continued through the early years of the war, but he died before it could be finished. Agnes Miller Parker completed it after his death, which took place on 27 October 1948 at his home, Rose Cottage, Burmarsh Road West, Hythe, Kent. He left a widow, Ruby Florence.<br>
