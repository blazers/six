<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wainwright,  Alfred</span>  (1907&#150;1991), <span class="occ">walker and writer</span>, was born on 17 January 1907 at 331 Audley Range, Blackburn, Lancashire, the fourth and last child of Albert Wainwright (<i>b</i>. 1870), a stonemason, and his wife, Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Woodcock (1873&#150;1942), daughter of an ironmonger. Although baptized Alfred, he never used his first name, and preferred to be known as A. Wainwright or A. W., which is how he became known to millions of Lake District lovers for his walking books. If asked what the A. stood for, he replied &#145;it isn't for Aloysius, if that's what you're thinking&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 22 Jan 1991). He was brought up in a terraced house, surrounded by cotton mills belching out their smoke and mill girls clip-clopping in their clogs along the cobblestones to work. His father was not always in work, partly because of his drinking problem, and the family suffered periods of poverty. Wainwright went to Blakey Moor higher elementary school, Blackburn, but left at the age of thirteen in 1920 to begin work as an office boy at Blackburn town hall. After three years he became a clerk in the borough treasurer's department, where it was pointed out to him that he would never be promoted unless he had passed the appropriate professional exams. For most of the next seven years he studied accountancy by correspondence and evening classes, before eventually qualifying as a municipal accountant. In any spare time he followed the fortunes of Blackburn Rovers, and later helped to found their supporters' club in 1939.<br>
<br>Wainwright's first visit to the Lake District was in 1930, at the age of twenty-three. This was rather late, in some ways, as rambling in Lakeland had become very popular with young men from industrial Lancashire. In <span class="italic">Ex-Fellwanderer</span> (1987) he described his first impressions on looking over Lake Windermere: &#145;It was a moment of magic, a revelation so unexpected that I stood transfixed, unable to believe my eyes. Those few hours on Orrest Head cast a spell which changed my life.&#146; From then on he spent his leisure time walking, either locally in Lancashire or on visits to Lakeland, determined to find a job there if he could. He managed it in 1941, when he joined the borough treasurer's department in Kendal, taking a drop in salary. Meanwhile he had married Ruth Holden (1909&#150;1985), a cotton weaver and daughter of William Holden, at Furthergate Congregational Church, Blackburn, on 24 December 1931. They had one son, Peter (1933&#150;1998). According to Wainwright, it very soon became an unhappy marriage. Rather unfairly, he felt his wife had not kept pace with his rising professional status and that he had little in common with her. They kept up appearances in view of his august municipal position&#151;he became borough treasurer of Kendal in 1948&#151;but at home they hardly talked to each other.<br>
<br>Wainwright's passion for walking became even more intense once he moved to Lakeland, partly to escape from his unhappy home life. In 1952 he began the self-created task of walking every fell in Lakeland and recording his walks, with pen-and-ink drawings, for his own amusement, so he said, to read by his fireside when he was too old to walk. He divided Lakeland into seven regions and took thirteen years over the project, climbing 214 fells, travelling on foot or by public transport from his Kendal home. He never learned to drive a car. On completing the first book, he decided to publish it himself. He wanted his own handwriting, his own drawings, his own page layouts to be reproduced the way he had done them, without an ounce of printer's type. <span class="italic">The Eastern Fells</span>, the first in his <span class="roman">Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells</span>, came out in 1955 and the final one, <span class="italic">The Western Fells</span>, was published in 1966. The early editions of the first five books in the series had the name of a colleague, Henry Marshall (borough librarian of Kendal), as the publisher. Later they were all published by the <span class="italic">Westmorland Gazette</span>.<br>
<br>Wainwright retired as borough treasurer of Kendal in 1967 and threw himself into writing and walking full-time. In all he published fifty-nine books on walking, in Wales and Scotland as well as Lakeland. The <span class="roman">Pictorial Guides</span> were the best-known and best-loved, along with <span class="italic">Pennine Way Companion</span> (1968), and <span class="italic">A Coast to Coast Walk</span> (1973). By 1985 over 1 million of his <span class="roman">Pictorial Guides</span> had been sold&#151;yet Wainwright had given no interviews, done no publicity or signing session, and no biographical details ever appeared on his guidebooks. He was appointed MBE in 1966. His first marriage was dissolved in 1968 and on 10 March 1970 he married Betty McNally (1922&#150;2008), a state-enrolled nurse, and daughter of John Hayes, public works contractor. Her first marriage had also been dissolved. They had twenty years of an exceedingly happy marriage together.<br>
<br>Wainwright was 6 feet 3 inches tall and burly, with thick hair which originally was carrot red, much to his embarrassment as a young man. Even when, in later years, his hair had turned a more distinguished white, Betty, his second wife, always referred to him as Red. He avoided all publicity until the 1980s, when his devotion to Animal Rescue Cumbria&#151;an animal refuge which he and Betty had helped to set up, and to which he was very soon giving away almost all his royalties&#151;led him to agree to a series of walking programmes for BBC television with Eric Robson. These turned him, aged eighty, into a national figure. He also did a series of glossy photographic walking books for Michael Joseph, in order to help the same charity. He was not naturally sociable, disliked public occasions, and could be gruff and short with strangers, but on paper, and in private, he was amusing and engaging. His <span class="roman">Pictorial Guides</span> were considered little masterpieces&#151;philosophical strolls rather than mere guidebooks, with his own personal feelings and observations, written and drawn by a master craftsman. Wainwright died at the Westmorland County Hospital, Kendal, on 20 January 1991, of cardiac failure. He was cremated at Kendal four days later, and his ashes were scattered on Hay Stacks, above Buttermere, one of his favourite fells. In <span class="italic">Fellwanderer</span> (1966) he wrote: &#145;If you dear readers should get a bit of grit in your boots as you are crossing Haystacks in the years to come, please treat it with respect. It might be me.&#146;<br>
